    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset mentor podcast i am your host\nrob dial and if you have not yet done so\nhit that subscribe button so that you\nnever miss another episode of this\npodcast\n[Music]\nwe spend the majority of our lives our\nwaking hours\nat a job that's a fact the majority of\nthe time that we spend awake we do\nnothing else more than work\nso that's the first thing that i want to\nset\nwe spend more time working than doing\nanything else that we do and here's the\nsad fact 85\nof people in the united states don't\nenjoy what they do this is a recent\ngallup poll 85 percent of people do not\nenjoy what they do in america and in\nchina and japan that number is 94\nso between 85 to 94 of people\ndon't love what they do\nbut they spend the majority of their\nlife doing it so if you're at a job that\nyou hate\nit is a complete\nabsolute waste of your life\nnow let's dive in a little bit deeper\nmost people do that even though they\nhate doing it and they think themselves\nall right well you know what\ni'm just gonna work until i get to 65\nand then i can finally retire\nthat's what people think i'm gonna just\nput my head down i'm gonna work it's\nokay if i hate my job i'm gonna do it so\nthat i can eventually get to my\nretirement age and then i can live the\nlife i've always wanted to live but\nlet's be real once you get to 65 you\ndon't have as much energy you don't have\nas much time you don't have as much\nvibrancy for life in most cases as you\nwould if you were in your 20s 30s 40s\ngoing out and traveling and living the\njob that you want and doing the\neverything that you want to in your life\nthat's just a fact but here's the crazy\nthing the majority of people get to 65\nand they're not able to retire because\nthey were working a job that they hated\nthey didn't save enough money and now\nthey can't retire so now they get to\nwork till 70 72 years old\nand let's just say for instance if you\nlook at the average person gets their\nfirst real job around the age of 20 to\n22 years old\nand then they have you know until let's\njust say they do get to retire at 65.\nwell then that means if they're lucky\nthey'll get to 80 years old only about\n80 percent of people actually 65 percent\nof people live to 80 years old so that\nmeans 15 years so they spend from 20 to\n65 that's 45 years working a job that\nthey probably don't enjoy so that they\ncan have 65 to 80 years old which is\nsmaller only 15 years or 65 to 80 i\nguess you could say is actually fit yeah\n15 years\nthey spend that time\nliving it up enjoying life that's what\nthey think right but then they don't\nhave the money that they want to if they\ndo have the money they want to have as\nmuch energy as they want to and so\nthat's why i think that you should quit\nyour job\nif you dread mondays now let me preface\nthis a little bit don't quit and put\nyourself in crazy terrible financial\nstrain i don't want you to do that but\nwhat i do want you to do is start to\nactually think about what it is that you\nwant to do i understand that you might\nnot be able to leave your job today\nbut if you know that you hate your job\nand you're not listening to this podcast\nnow you have to realize\nyou don't have to know exactly what you\nwant to do right now\nbut if you're not in constant search and\nmake that the mission to do what you\nwant to do then it's an issue you need\nto start thinking about what is it that\ni want to do what is it that makes me\nfeel alive what is it that i absolutely\nlove\nand some of you i get it you have\nchildren you have a mortgage you have a\nfamily you have bills to pay\ni understand\ni hear you\nbut you have to realize this\nyou're raising your children they're\nwatching everything that you do\nthey're going to become a lot like you i\ndon't know if you're if you're like me\nbut i look at some of the things i do\nand i'm like damn\nthat was basically my mom like i am\nliterally a lot in a lot of aspects i do\na lot of things exactly the same\nso in the same case if you're working a\njob that you hate just to provide for\nyour family\nyour children are going to grow up and\ndo what\nthe same thing that you've done and if\nthey're doing the same thing that you've\ndone\nthey're going to probably get a job that\nthey hate just so they can pay the bills\nbecause if they see\nmom or dad working a job that they hate\nso they can pay the bills they\nautomatically think that's the way that\nthe world works oh job is just something\nthat you hate you just have to pay the\nbills and so what happens they grow up\nand do the exact same thing that you did\nthen what happens they raise their\nchildren your grandchildren to do the\nexact same thing and as uh as alan watts\nlikes to say it's all wretched no vomit\nlike there's no change there's no i'm\ngoing to step out and do something\ncompletely different\nyou know i think that i was lucky enough\nbecause\nmy mom was a was worked on her own so i\nsaw she was self-employed i saw her be\nself-employed so for me it was an easy\nroute to be like screw it i'm not going\nto do it i'm not going to i dropped out\nof school i was like i don't want to go\nto college and get a job that i hate by\nthe time i was in college i was making\nmore money than i would have if i had\njust gone the college route because i\nwas in a sales position and my mom was\nactually the one that said hey you know\nwhy do you go to school in the first\nplace i was like to make money she goes\nwhat are you already doing i was like\nmaking money she goes so why do you need\nto be there she was like the little i\nkind of needed her permission to leave\nschool is the way i felt it and she was\nkind of that permission she's like well\nif you don't love it you don't want to\nbe there then just go but so many people\nthey're raising their children to do the\nexact same thing now once again i don't\nwant you to put yourself in financial\nstrain but i want you to think if i hate\nmy job right now and it doesn't fulfill\nme can i eventually leave\nto do something that i love i'm not\nsaying don't have a job and just live on\nthe streets i'm saying can you change\njobs into doing something that you love\neven if you make less money isn't that\nstill more fulfilling isn't it better to\nwake up and be excited about what you do\nversus hate what you do\nthink about that for a second i would be\nokay making less money but loving what i\ndo\nas long as i wasn't doing something that\ni hated and wasting my life away at it\nhere's what's really interesting though\nthis is the kind of like the paradox\nthat people don't realize whenever you\nleave your job and you do something that\nyou love you love it so much\nthat you're willing to work harder at it\nand when you work harder at it you\nbecome better and you become better and\nyou become better and you can eventually\nbecome world class at something\nand charge a premium for whatever your\nservices are so what's crazy is that you\nmight leave a job that pays you sixty\nthousand dollars a year in year one of\ndoing what you truly love you might make\nforty thousand then you move up to forty\ntwo thousand you move up to forty eight\nthousand you start getting better and\nbetter and better because you love what\nyou do you're willing to work hard at it\nbecause it doesn't feel like work and\nyou actually truly want to do it and\nthen what happens you get better and\nyou're better and better seven years\ndown the road you're making 65 000 then\nyou're making 70 you're making 80. and\nin the long run you make more money\ndoing what you love\nbecause you love to do it and you're\npassionate about it and you don't see it\nas work you just see it as something\nthat's a part of you versus working this\njob that you stayed at for security now\nthere's one thing that we do know if you\nsee what's going on in the world right\nnow\nwhat people thought were secure jobs you\nknow they went the secure route the safe\nroute\nyou know a lot of things came in\ncompletely stripped them of it and now\nthey're looking for a job even though\nthey were working in jobs they hated now\nthey're looking oh that was secure it's\nnot secure as i thought it was the most\nsecure job that you can have in the\nworld\nis being really really good at what you\ndo so that you're unfireable\nor number two is to do something where\nyou're your own boss the most secure job\nin the world is working for yourself\nbecause nobody can fire you that's the\nreally interesting thing about we always\nthink secure is like going the secure\nroute the traditional route you go to\nschool you get a job you go and get\npromoted you get promoted no a company\ncan just get rid of you as soon as they\nwant to and the way that i realize this\nand the person i think says it the best\nis jim carrey he was talking about a\ncommencement speech and he mentions his\ndad\nand the thing he says about his dad is\nthat his dad was an incredible saxophone\nplayer he was the funniest guy that he\never met and he wanted to be a saxophone\nplayer and a comedian but he had a\nfamily\nand he had this family and he ended up\nbecoming an accountant instead and he\nwatched his dad go to a job that he\nhated every single day and then his dad\nlike 15 20 years later got fired from\nthat position that he hated\nand then they became homeless because he\ndidn't have a backup plan he became\nhomeless and they lived in their car for\na little while and jim carrey says this\nquote i learned a lot of things from my\ndad but not the least of which is that i\ncan you can fail at something that you\nhate so you might as well take a chance\nat doing something that you love\nlet me say that again he watched his dad\nget fired\nfrom a job that he hated\nso he saw that as a failure at doing\nsomething that you hated and so he\nthought to himself if you can fail and\nwhat you hate doing i might as well take\na chance at something that i love\ndoing\nyou have to live a fulfilled life even\nif you make less\nbecause would you rather have your\nchildren be happy or successful\nright so you know and here's the thing\nthey might not even be successful just\ngo to a job and just make 60 65 000 a\nyear but for me for my children i would\nrather have them even if they make less\nmoney i'd rather have them be fulfilled\nand love the life that they have and so\nyou got to think what am i teaching my\nchildren even if i'm not teaching it to\nthem directly what are they seeing me do\nbecause they're going to follow in my\nfootsteps once again i'm not saying quit\nyour job\ni'm just saying that if you don't love\nyour job you need to get out of it at\nsome point in time it's okay for right\nnow to be working a job that you don't\nlove because you're now waking up to the\nfact that maybe you don't love it but\nit's not okay to be in constant pursuit\nof that which is something that you love\nit's not it's fine to work a job for a\nlittle while it's not fine to work there\nforever\nif you hate it\nyou know maybe you have to\nyou don't have to get a bigger house or\na newer car all of the time or or feel\nlike you have to keep up with the\njoneses or have that really special job\ntitle so that you think people respect\nyou\nno\nwhat it is about is not getting stuck in\nthe rat race not feeling like you have\nto keep up with the joneses and buy\nthings that you it's like the the uh the\nquote we buy things we work jobs that we\nhate to buy things uh that we don't want\nto impress people that we don't like\nright it's like\nwhy don't we just do what we want to do\ninstead of having to buy that new car\nyou know maybe what we do is we say\nscrew it i'll save that money and what\ni'll do is i'll work a job that i love\nsomething that makes me feel fulfilled\ninside because the best that we know\nguys we only get one life\nmaybe there's reincarnation maybe\nthere's not i'm not smart enough to know\ni've never died to be on the other side\nuh not that i know of and so you have to\nrealize to the best of our knowledge we\nget one of these things\nand if you're not living a fully 100\nfulfilled life\nand you hate what you do\nit's a waste\nand i don't know about you but my\nbiggest fear is getting to the end of my\nlife and wishing that i could have done\nsomething more wishing that i could have\ndone something i loved wishing that i\ncould have brought more to the world\nmore joy to the people around me to my\ncommunity to my family to children\neveryone else that's around me\nyou have to realize we're caught up in a\nsociety where you are taught you need to\ngo the safe route right we wake up\nat what three four five years old and\nwe're like all right we gotta go to\nschool we go to school we're stuck\ninside of a box\nwe stay inside of that box for the\nlongest time what happens they say oh\nyou're in kindergarten make sure you do\nreally good so you can get to first\ngrade and make sure you do really good\nso you get to second grade and third and\nfourth and so on and you get to high\nschool and they say make sure you do\nreally good in high school so that you\ncan get into a good college and then\nwhen you're in college they say make\nsure you do really good in college so\nthat you can get a good job and then\nwhen you get into a good job they say\nmake sure you do really good so you can\nget promoted so you can make more money\nso you can get promoted so you can make\nmore money so you can get promoted so\nyou can make more money and you wake up\nat 45 50 years old and you're like what\nthe hell have i been doing with my life\nthere's a reason why there's a phrase\ncalled a midlife crisis\nis because people wake up wake up and go\nwhat the hell am i doing with my life\nwhose life am i living is this what i\nwanted to do\nand then what happens it's a crisis\nbecause they feel stuck they don't know\nhow to get out of it because the box\nthat they were raised in is now the box\nthat they feel stuck in into now try to\nreprogram yourself to leave a job to\nthink completely different to get out of\nyour comfort zone\nis scary as hell and i get it\ni used to have a client that would call\nthem the golden pellets every two weeks\nto get those golden rat pellets this\ngolden rat pellets are his paycheck\nthose are what keep him they're golden\nbut they're rat pellets they're poison\nas well and it's what keeps you inside\nof that loop it's a reason why they call\nit the rat race\nand some people most people will stay\ninside of that rat race forever some\npeople maybe you this might be a spark\nthat gets you going that goes you know\nwhat maybe i can't leave right now but\ni'm leaving this there's no way in hell\nthat i'm going to continue down this\npath\ni'm leaving this and i'm going to go\nahead and create the life that i want to\nit might take me six months it might\ntake me a year it might take me two\nyears but i'm going to leave i will not\nstay at a place that i don't love i will\nnot waste my waking hours doing\nsomething that i don't want to do\nyou weren't born to just pay the bills\nand die\ntake that one in for a second\nyou were not born to pay the bills and\ndie you were born to thrive you were\nborn to live this life with as much joy\nand passion and love as you possibly can\nand if you're going to a job and\nspending the majority of your hours\ndoing something that you hate\nthat's going to restrict your joy your\npassion for life you're going to come\nhome you're not going to be able to\nbecause you're so spent on mentally\nexhausted from being at work when you\ncome home and interact with your kids\nyou're not gonna have the energy and the\njoy and the love and the passion and\nguess what\nthey're not gonna get all of you\nbut when you come home from something\nthat you love and you're excited about\nlife you give more to your children and\nthe people around you so not only is it\nyour your actual self that's being\naffected by the job that you have it's\neveryone around you it's something to\nconsider\nand it's with great love and respect\nthat i want to tell you this we're all\ngoing to die we're all going to end up\nas dust\nbut you are in charge of what you do\nwith your waking hours if you don't love\nwhat you do find some way to leave and\ndo something that you love and be able\nto get paid doing that thing that you\nlove\neven if you make less money even though\nhere's a secret like i said in the long\nrun you will eventually make more money\ndon't worry about keeping up with the\njoneses don't worry about the bigger\nhouse don't worry about being judged\nworry about living the life that you\nwant doing something that you love with\nthe people that you love so that you can\ndeliver and be the best human the best\nfather the best\nbrother sister mother father\ncousin\neverything that you can be for the\npeople around you\ni'm going to talk about why 90 of people\nend up living their lives and then dying\nwith regret i'm going to talk about it\nso that you don't have to\nthat's an important thing you have to\nlearn from other people so that you can\nimprove your life and there's an\nincredible book called five regrets of\nthe dying in the number one regret\nactually before i go about the number\none regard let me tell you about what\nthe book's about the book is a lady who\nlives in hospice or works in hospice for\npeople who she's a nurse there and she's\naround people who are dying all the time\nand she starts to notice that there's\nfive really common regrets that people\nhave as they're dying and the number one\nregret which is what we're going to talk\nabout today the number one regret of\npeople who are on their death beds\nthey've lived their entire lives and\nthat they're at the very end there is no\nway out their number one regret is that\ni wish i lived a life that was true to\nmyself and not the life that others\nexpected of me\nlet that sink in for a second\nthe number one thing that people regret\nwhen they're at the end of their lives\nis that they wish they lived a life that\nwas true to themselves and not the life\nthat others expected of them and there's\na couple reasons why\nthis exists and i'm going to talk about\ntwo reasons number one is our absolute\nneed for acceptance from other people\nthat holds us back i'm gonna talk about\nthat and number two is i feel like most\npeople don't know who they truly are and\nif you don't know who you truly are then\nyou don't know what you truly want and\nso let's go over the first one first\npeople's need for acceptance\nholds them back from everything that\nthey want there's an incredible quote\nthat jim carrey has when he's giving a\ncommencement speech and he says your\nneed for acceptance will make you\ninvisible in this world we learn from a\nyoung age whether it's our parents or\nsociety or our family or our friends we\nlearn that we have to act a certain way\nand we have to fit in into society and\nso from a young age we develop what's\ncalled a personality now just so you\nknow personality comes from the greek\nword persona the greek word persona is\nactually the mask that people would wear\nwhen they were acting on stage back in\nancient greece\nso that personality that you have is a\nmask that you're wearing so that you can\nfit in with what you think you should be\nor what you have been raised to be\nso ultimately what happens from a young\nage is we make ourselves into a\ncharacter of who we think other people\nwant us to be whether that's our parents\nwhether that's society whether that's\nfitting in with our friends whatever it\nis\nwe make ourselves into a character of\nwho we think other people want us to be\nit starts off as everything does with\nour parents if you had\ngreat parents or terrible parents we\nstill as children mold ourselves into\nwhat we feel like our parents want us to\nbe\nhow they want us to act how they act and\nsometimes it's not even what they\nspecifically say to us it's also what we\nwatch them doing have you ever noticed\none time where you're just doing\nsomething you're like oh my god that was\nexactly like my mom oh my god that was\nexactly like my dad it's not that they\nforce that onto us it's that we learn\nthe world by learning from what they say\nto us but actually more than anything\nelse is watching them\nso if your parents have a personality\na persona a character that they've\ndeveloped\nchildren tend to take on their parents\ncharacter as well\nand so what happens is when we act a\ncertain way as we're young we figure out\nwhat we're supposed to do what we're not\nsupposed to do right we learn it from\nour parents\nand we start to develop that personality\nand then what happens\nwe start to hang out around other\nchildren and we want to be around other\nchildren we want to be accepted by other\nchildren it's built into us to be tribal\nbeings so we want to be accepted we\ndon't want to be kicked out of the tribe\nbecause a hundred thousand years ago to\nbe kicked out of tribe meant certain\ndeath and so it's built into our brains\nto have the need for acceptance from\nothers around us so it starts with our\nparents and then we get older and then\nas we're you know five six seven eight\nyears old we start to develop a\npersonality a character a mask a persona\nof what we think other people want us to\nbe\nand then what do we do we start acting a\ncertain way so that we fit in i still\nremember i still feel bad i'm 30 about\nto be 35 years old i still feel bad for\ncalling a girl named tracy on the bus on\nthe way back from school in middle\nschool on anne marie island a name that\ni thought was really really harsh and\nafter those words came out of my mouth i\nwas like\nthat wasn't me i can't believe i said\nthat but i can't take it back and the\nonly reason why i said it was because i\nremember that i thought other kids would\nthink it was funny\ni developed a i said something that was\ncompletely out of my character to her\nand i still feel bad about it like 28\nyears later 20 years later whatever 25\nyears later i still feel bad about it\nbecause that's not who i am\nbut it's who i thought i needed to be to\nbe accepted so let me take a step back\nwho did you need to be\nor who did you think you needed to be in\norder to be accepted by your parents\nhave you ever thought about that for a\nsecond who did you need to be or who did\nyou think you needed to be to be\naccepted by other children when you were\nyounger\nwho did you need to be or who did you\nthink you needed to be to be accepted in\nhigh school\nin college in your first relationships\nyou develop a persona and a lot of times\nwhat happens is we do what we think\nother people think that we should do so\nwe go to college when in reality some of\nus don't want to go to college because\nwe feel like that's just\ni don't know i'm 17 years old i'm 18\nyears old i don't know what the best\ndecision is but it seems like what\neveryone's telling me is that i have to\ngo to this college and so we go to\ncollege even though sometimes we might\nnot want to go to college or maybe we go\nto college and we get a degree or start\nstudying\nfor a degree that we don't truly want\nbut it's what our parents tell us is the\nsafest route or we get it because we\nknow that that that job's going to make\nthe most money\nand so we go on a pursuit of not what we\ntruly want not what we truly desire but\nwe go on a pursuit of what we feel other\npeople want from us or what we feel will\nget us accepted or what we feel will\nmake us more money which should make us\nmore successful which would then change\nother people's perception of us make us\nfeel a certain way\nthen we keep going\nwe get out of college\nwe get a job\nand sometimes we get a job just because\nwe want other people to think of us in a\ncertain way oh i want to get this job i\nwant to be a doctor so that people think\nof me in a high way they think that i'm\na great person whatever it is and we get\na job and we do what we think other\npeople want us to do when in reality we\nstill don't know what the hell we want\nto do\nand then what happens there's something\ncalled a midlife crisis for a lot of\npeople some people have theirs in my\nmidlife crisis at 24. i had a quarter\nlife crisis some people have it 30 40 50\n60.\nand we wake up\nfrom this\nthis sleep that we've been in this\nautopilot that we've been working on and\nwe're we get the feeling of this isn't\nwhat i want\nbut am i too far down the road to turn\nback now i can't tell you how many\nmessages i got from people that are 40\nyears old 35 years old 30 years old 50\nyears old and they want something\ncompletely different than what they have\nthey have awoken from the dream that\nthey have been in\nthe autopilot\nbut they say i don't think i can turn\nback now i'm too far down the road\ni have a family to support i have this i\nneed to do\nand what happens is that they stay in a\njob a lot of times that's slowly killing\nthem\nthey're too far down the road is what\nthey feel\nright i've invested too much time\ni don't want to get out of this now i've\ninvested way too much i'm so far down\nthe road you might be 40 years old right\nnow and you might feel like you've\ninvested so much time into your career\ninto your college into your degree\ninto everything but it's not fulfilling\nyou it's not what you want but you might\nthink it's too late i've missed my shot\nright so many people feel that way if\nyou're 40 years old the average person's\nliving to about 85 years old you're not\neven halfway through with your life so\nyou're going to waste the next 85 well\nif we do 85 minus 40 45 years of your\nlife doing something that you don't want\nto do because simply you made a decision\nwhen you were 17 years old to do\nsomething and to go study something and\nyou got a job in it\nthat's freaking bonkers if you think\nabout it\nyou're not too old it's not too late you\ncan change at any time and you don't\nhave to change right now but can you\nstart to make a transition plan over the\nnext two years i'm gonna leave my job\ni'm gonna do this make sure my family's\nset up make sure financially i'm good to\ngo i'm not saying just leave at this\nvery moment but you can make a\ntransition plan i understand some people\nlistening to me have a have people\nmouths to feed\nsometimes they just up and leave and\nquit and go become an artist but\nwhatever it is you want to do it's truly\npossible for you to make money doing it\nand for you to be fulfilled and to live\nyour passion and to still feed your\nfamily what would that transition plan\nlook like it's not too late stop selling\nyou're telling yourself you're too late\nyou have now woken up from the slumber\nthat you're in don't go back to sleep\ndon't go back to sleep\nso that's the first thing is that people\nhave the need for acceptance\nand so they they do all of these things\nto be accepted for so long and then\nsometimes they wake up\nand that's one of the number one reasons\nthat's number one reason why people\nobviously hold themselves back and they\nget into this life that we're talking\nabout and the second reason why is\nbecause people don't know who they truly\nare\nand what they truly want\nso we rarely ask ourselves what do i\nwant what if you started waking up every\nsingle morning to ask yourself a\nquestion what do i want\nwhat is it that i want what is my dream\nlife what is this dream job this dream\nprofession this dream family the stream\nhappiness this dream\nmindset\nwhat do i want\ndo you ever ask yourself that what do\nyou want what do you want in life\nwhat do you want\ngo for it\nand then what happens is some people\nwill wake up to what they want and they\nstill don't go for it\nright\nso we live a life based on what we think\nother people want from us\none of the scariest moments of my entire\nlife was leaving my job that i felt like\ni had worked forever at you know i was\n26 years old when i got the job 29 when\ni was leaving the job i was making over\nsix figures base salary plus commission\non top of it that's a lot of money for a\n29 year old\nand i remember i was like i felt\nliterally i felt like my\nmy\ni felt like my soul was dying like i\nfelt like i could feel myself slowly\nslipping into a depression like i was on\nthe edge of going into a depression i\ncould feel myself slipping into habits\nthat i didn't want to have in habits\nthat i\nrealized would not create the life that\ni wanted to and so what happened was i\ncreated this podcast i started a\nbusiness and\nit didn't go really well for a while\nthat's what i i don't talk a whole lot\nabout like i wasn't making much money i\nwasn't you know like oh my gosh i'm\nsuper successful from the very beginning\nand i was terrified because i left my\njob to make a business out of it\nterrified scaredless right and i went\nback home and uh this was in november of\n2015. i'm sorry december of 2015. i went\nback home and my sister asked me a\nquestion she goes hey have i ever shown\nyou the box of dad's stuff\ni was like i don't know what you mean\nshe's like i have a box of dad's stuff\nmy dad had died 14 years ago she still\nnever showed me all this and she finally\nbrings out this this box and it's got\nlike old shirts it's got his glasses\nit's got his watch and it's got these\nletters my dad was when i was younger my\ndad was in jail for a little while for\nmultiple dui's and he wrote us letters\nand he wrote a letter to my my sister on\nher 19th birthday and it was this\nbeautiful letter he was a great writer\nand then at the end\nuh he said i hope you live your life\nwith courage love and laughter and then\nit was a little bit more and i was like\nholy i feel like he's speaking to me\nright now like this is a letter from my\nsister in 2000 and\nwhen i'm in 2000 he wrote this letter to\nher and in 2015 i'm reading the letter\nand it says i hope you live your life\nwith courage love and laughter and the\nnumber one thing that i was feeling at\nthat moment from starting a business is\nshould i shut down my business and go\nback to sales go back to doing what i\nwas doing because i knew that that money\nwas guaranteed i had so much fear inside\nof me and the opposite of fear is\ncourage\ni needed some courage and on it it said\ni hope you live your life with courage\nlove and laughter and i had never had\nany tattoos in my entire life for that\nmoment\nbut i was like i feel like i'm about to\nslip into massive amounts of fear and\nanxiety around not having the money that\ni want to coming in with this business\nand i'm going to burn the ships this is\nthe only thing that i'm going to do and\ni'm going to get this tattooed on me and\nso if you guys you guys are on video can\nsee it it's literally on my arm it's my\ndad's handwriting that has blown up on\nmy arm and it's in his handwriting it\nsays live your life with courage love\nand laughter and i made myself look at\nit every single morning of i'm\nscared\nlist that list list of\nlosing everything that i have but i know\nthat this is what i truly want to do so\ni'm not going to give up so i have to\nlive my life with courage right so i\nliterally had felt my soul dying at this\njob had to leave i felt myself slipping\ninto depression i left there\nwhich was scary as hell and it wasn't\ngoing the way that i wanted wanted to\nfrom the very beginning\nbut then what happened was i was like\nscared and thinking about going back and\ni had to get a tattoo on my on my arm to\nshow me\nthis is stop like stop living in fear\nstop making your decisions out of fear\nstart making your decisions out of a\nplace of power versus a place of\nscarcity\nand luckily i was able to make it work\ndid it take time yes is it working\nbetter than i could have ever possibly\nimagined yes but i almost went back to\nwhat was killing my soul\nbut i didn't\nthink about that in your situation that\nyou're in does that hit home in any sort\nof way\nwhat do you want\nif money were no object what would you\nbe doing\nwhat makes you feel the most alive in\nthis world what makes your soul smile\ndo you know\nif you do know follow it\ndo it\nput every waking ounce of energy that\nyou have into it if you have a full-time\njob a nine-to-five whenever you get home\nput every ounce of energy after that\ninto it don't use your job as an excuse\nas to why you don't have enough energy\nto follow your dreams after your job\nsure you can pay the bills but then\nfollow your dreams until your dreams can\nthen pay your bills\nso if you do know what it is follow it\nif you don't know what it is search for\nit if you've been listening to my\npodcast long enough i always say this\nit's okay not to know your true purpose\nright now but it's not okay to not be in\nconstant search for it\nit's okay not to know your true purpose\nright now but it's not okay to not be in\nconstant search for it wake up every\nmorning and ask yourself what do i want\nwhat do i want what do i want set your\nreticular activating in your system to\nfind what it is that you want you might\nwake up today and you might say what do\ni want that answer might come to you\nright away probably not going to though\nit might take a week it might take a\nmonth it might take\n10 months it might take a year it might\ntake five years before you finally get\nthe answer as to what it is that makes\nyour soul come alive\nit's not okay\nto not be in constant search for what\nthat is if you don't know what it is\nso what do you want in your life stop\ndoing what you feel like you're supposed\nto be doing stop following what other\npeople say that you should be doing\nbecause what happens is if you do stay\nin the route that you're in if you don't\nlove what you're doing if you're not\nfollowing your purpose if you're not\nfinding your dream if you're not doing\nexactly what you want to do\nthen the worst thing that could happen\nis that you could be like 90 of people\nlike they say in this book they get to\nthe end of their life they're on their\ndeath bed and they wish they lived a\nlife that was true to themselves and not\nthe life that others expected of them\nwhat do you want in your life\nall that matters is what you want not\nwhat other people want\nwhat do you want figure it out find it\nfollow it and don't stop\nuntil you get it\none of the questions that i get asked\nmore than anything else on social media\nis how do i find my passion how do i\nfind my purpose how do i find\nthe way that i can come alive and what\nit is i need to do and and i think it's\nan important question i think it's\nsomething that people need to think\nabout uh every freaking day if i'm being\nhonest with you because you only get one\nlife that we're aware of maybe we do get\nmore maybe we don't but nobody has any\nactual physical proof that there's\nanything after this so then i'm gonna\ntry to make this the best life that i\npossibly can and i'm gonna give you some\nstories about my life and how all of\nthis relates to me and why hearing the\nquestion what if money was no object\ncompletely changed the way that i saw my\nlife so before we start i want to tell\nyou this when i was 27 years old the\nfirst 27 years of my life by the time i\nhad 27 was all focused on how i can\naccumulate and make as much money as i\npossibly can my life\nbesides hanging out with people and\ndoing other things like my life the core\nof it was how can i make more money how\ncan i make money how can i be successful\nand i know i'm not alone in this i know\nthis is most people's number one goal\nthere was a study i said this a couple\nepisodes ago that 80 percent of\nmillennials number one goal was to\nbecome rich so i'm not the only person\nwho really just was their goal was to\nmake money\nmany people live the exact same way that\ni lived and um what happened with me\nwhen i was 27 years old was super\nimportant for the story that i'm going\nto tell you\nat 27 i was working a high paying sales\njob i was making about 200 000 a year so\nfor a 27 year old pretty damn good money\nand um\nin my the company i was with decided to\njust get rid of their sales department\nright so their sales department for the\ncompany that i was with they're just\nlike hey we're just going to go ahead\nand get rid of everybody so there's only\nfive of us at the time they got rid of\neverybody and what happened with me was\nthey gave me the opportunity to stay at\nthe company but take a massive pay cut\nand switch to a different position and\nso i had to sit down with\nyou know the head person of my\ndepartment and i had to sit down with\nthe ceo\nand\nthe ceo gave me some really good advice\nand he basically said it seems like\nyou're more passionate about this other\nthing that you're doing i had a podcast\nthat i just started i'll dive into that\nit seems like you're really passionate\nabout that why don't you pursue that\nand i already knew in my heart that's\nwhat i wanted to pursue but i didn't\nreally have the confidence to go ahead\nand pursue it and you know i was making\n200 000 a year i had to make a big\ndecision i could go find another job\nlike in sales they always say if you're\nin sales you always have a job i could\nhave easily found another job and made\npretty good money right\nbut there was something inside of me\nthat told me that i should do something\nelse and this was six years ago just so\nyou know and podcasts were not what they\nare now\nthey weren't even close to what they are\nnow nobody really knew what podcasts\nwere when i used to tell people that i\nwas a podcaster\nthey would i would get three responses\nnumber one what is a podcast that was my\nnumber the number one response number\ntwo i've heard of podcasts but i don't\nknow how to listen to them that was a\nnumber two response and number three was\noh i love podcasts and that was very\nrare right so\nsix years ago podcasts are not what they\nwere\nback then what they are now in my\npodcast the exact same podcast it's not\nnow called the mindset mentor obviously\nback then was called mwf motivation came\nout monday wednesday friday like it\nstill does\nand i was making zero dollars on the\npodcast let me say that again\nzero dollars i decided to not go and get\nanother high-paying job and i decided to\npursue my passion\neven though at that point i was making\nzero dollars i had no advertisers on the\npodcast nobody was paying me any money i\nwasn't getting enough downloads for that\nnumber two i had no products in my own\nbusiness that i could sell people i had\nno coaching services i had nothing\nliterally zero dollars was how much\nmoney i made off my podcast in all of my\nservices\nbecause the services actually didn't\neven really exist but\ni didn't know how to make any money\nonline\ni didn't know i knew that people did and\nto be honest with you i didn't know if i\ncould make money off my podcast i didn't\nknow if i could make money off of\ncoaching services i didn't know if it\nwas possible but i had this feeling\num deep down inside of me\nthat this is what i should do\nand i had at least a little bit of money\nin the bank account i was like you know\nwhat i've got a little bit of money i\ncan try this out for six months to a\nyear if it doesn't work i can always go\nback to making money again and being a\nsalesperson\nbut there's something in my heart that\ntells me like this is what i'm supposed\nto be doing and i'm going to figure it\nout and i i felt like this was my\ncalling i felt like this is my passion\num\nand it logically didn't make any sense\nbecause logically you look at you say\nmaking zero dollars versus making a\ncouple hundred thousand dollars\nthe average person is going to go just\ngo make the money right\nthat's what the logical side of it but\nwhen you think about it from like what\nmy heart was telling me what my passion\nwas telling me it was hey\nyou should go and pursue this thing\nbecause it seems like it's the right\nthing like this feels right it feels\nlike something that you'd actually love\nto do so logically it made no sense but\nit just felt right it felt something\nfelt right i don't know what it was but\nit was something that lit up inside of\nme that had never lived inside lit up\ninside of me before and it was this\nfeeling of like yep\nthis is in full alignment with who i'm\nsupposed to be and what i'm supposed to\ndo right and i'm bringing this up and\ni'm telling you this story because now\nobviously\nif people come out to me like hey i want\na successful podcast like you and i'm\nlike well you got to do 900 episodes\nthat's what i've done you've got to go\nfor six years that's what i've done you\nknow you've got\nit you look at it and it's like we have\nyou know 10 employees now and between\neverybody who's who works for the\ncompany about 15 people across the board\nyou know and we've got a multi-million\ndollar coaching business but it came\nfrom literally\nzero\nno followers you know people see they're\nlike oh i want 2.5 or 3 million\nfollowers whatever we have at this point\ni want a big podcast all of these things\npeople want it i understand it but most\npeople are not willing to step out into\nthe unknown into what seems illogical\nto follow their heart\nand so i want to ask you that question\nyou know is there something inside of\nyou that logically does not make sense\nas far as on spreadsheets how much money\nyou're gonna make all of that stuff but\nit just feels right is there\nthink about that for a second let it set\nin is there something inside of you that\nsays i should go follow this passion\nright because that's what we're going to\ndive into i wanted to give you my story\nto to make you realize it can go from\nzero to\nmillions of followers and millions of\ndollars quite quickly if you're\nfollowing the thing that is actually\nyour passion right so when i'm talking\nabout this i want you to think to\nyourself what is it that i want to do\nright um and sometimes following your\ndream doesn't logically make sense\nit doesn't\nbeing a painter might not quote unquote\nlogically makes sense being a musician\nmight not being a creator might not make\nsense whatever it is it might not make\nsense\nto the average person but for some\nreason there's something inside of you\nthat goes yeah this makes sense\nright when i told everybody i was gonna\nnot go back and not take a pay cut and\nnot do any of those things and not go\nback to the company or try to find\nanother job because i was gonna find my\npassion people like you're crazy and i\nwas like i know\nbut watch\nand now they're like oh you were right\nso is there something inside of you that\nfeels right\nright let's dive into that\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject\nif money did not exist there was no\nmoney what would you do with your free\ntime and i asked myself this question\nthis is a question posed by alan watts\none of my\ntop two favorite philosophers in the\nentire world him and ramdas right he\nsays what would you do if money were no\nobject i remember seeing that video and\nthinking what would i do if money were\nno object\nand what i do now i am obsessed with\nbefore i started the podcast i was\nalready obsessed with neurology\npsychology early childhood development\nwhat makes people tick watching people\nin conversation and watching people and\ntrying to to figure out why they are the\nway that they are based off of their\nchildhood based off of their parents i\nwas already obsessed with all that stuff\nand i'm still obsessed with it but\nwhat's cool is i'm obsessed with it and\nnow i can teach it to people and make\nmoney in different ways as a teacher as\na coach as a facilitator as a speaker\nall of these things so\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject if money was not something if you\ndidn't have to worry about paying the\nbills and all of your bills are just\npaid for\nyou could eat your family is taking care\nof you or taking care of all that stuff\nwhat would you do with your free time if\nyou had to do something besides just\nsitting on the couch hanging out with\nyour kids on instagram whatever it is\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject right\nthink about it\nwhat is that thing what makes you come\nalive what makes you tick what makes you\nfeel like this is the reason why i'm\nhere what gives you energy just thinking\nabout right what gives you energy by\ngoing and doing\nyou feel better you feel more alive you\nfeel like that's something that just\nfeels good we live in a society\nwhere we think too much\nwe think about things and that's why i\nsay logically it made sense for me to go\nback and just get another sales position\nlogically it makes sense that's a\nthinking thing but it didn't feel like\nthat was the right thing for me so what\nis it that feels right for you inside of\nyour body right and i understand that\nsome of you out there that are listening\nyou have children you have families you\nhave mortgages you have to pay i\nunderstand you can't just go you know\nwhat i'm going to quit my job today and\ni'm going to go and become a painter or\nwhatever the hell that makes you come\nalive\nmaybe you can't do that but can you\nstart to think of some sort of a\ntransition plan\nright if you have bills to pay i get it\nbut can you go okay over the next two\nyears\nyou know i'm gonna go\ntwo years from today\ni'm gonna leave my job what do i need to\ndo to make that happen all right i\nshould probably start saving money\nprobably started saving money okay i\nshould probably start building an online\nfollowing i should probably start\npainting more probably start making more\nmusic whatever it is that you're that is\nthat lights you up right i should\nprobably start connecting with other\npeople who are in the same industry\nright try to figure out what would be an\ne what would make it easier for you to\ntransition out of what you do now into\nwhat it is that you truly want to do one\nof the problems is that people want\nimmediate gratification and they think\nyou know what if i want to do this thing\nthat is my passion i have to leave my\njob today and i have to start making\nmoney at the thing that i that is my\npassion tomorrow no you need to be smart\nand say if i had to leave two years from\ntoday\nwhat would my transition plan look like\nand start to plan it out\ni can't tell you how many people i've\ntold this to and they've quit their jobs\nand they've built their own businesses\nthey followed their passions because it\ntakes so much pressure off when you say\nokay i've got a year i've got two years\ni've got three years to figure this out\ni've got to connect with the right\npeople i've got to get better at my\nskills i've got to better my knowledge\ni've got to start learning how to make\nmoney online whatever it is that you\nwant to do and when you have that\ntransition time it allows you to pay\nyour bills\nlive your life\nfeed your family\nkeep the mortgage all of that stuff but\nat the same time it allows you to start\nto learn and grow and the light at the\nend of the tunnel starts to become a\nlittle bit brighter and a little bit\nbrighter a little bit brighter and by\nthe end of the two years people like\ni've got this i've got it under control\ni'm already making a little bit of cash\nand this this thing that i'm doing on\nthe side it's providing me the life that\ni want to whatever it is come up with a\ntransition plan if you have a job\nand you've got a family and you've got a\nmortgage you've got bills can you come\nup with some form of a transition plan\nwhat would you do if money were no\nobject okay\nsome people say oh i can't do it because\ni have children right\num\nthe thing i want to tell you about your\nchildren is this if you haven't realized\nalready which you probably have your\nchildren are going to follow in your\nfootsteps they're not going to do what\nyou say that they should do they're\ngoing to do what they see you do so you\nmight say hey honey follow your passion\nand follow your dreams and become a\ncreator and be a painter musician\nwhatever it is you want to do you can do\nanything that you want to but if they\nsee you going to a job that you hate\njust to pay the bills they're going to\nthink to themselves subconsciously oh\neven though i can be a creator and make\namazing things i'm supposed to hate my\njob i'm supposed to just pay the bills\nso your children will follow in your\nfootsteps if they see you work a job\nthat they hate there's a pretty good\nchance guess what they're going to do\nwork a job that they hate just to pay\nthe bills\nso\nwhat do you want them to see you do\nbecause whatever you do they're most\nlikely going to do as well they learn by\nwhat they see not by what they hear\nso wouldn't you rather your children do\nsomething that they love like if i were\nto ask you would you rather your your\nyour child be successful or happy what's\nthe answer to that would you rather be\nsuccessful or happy\nright there's a pretty good chance that\nif if\nthey don't have to choose either one a\nlot of times when they start on a path\nof going to do something that they're\nhappy with they also become successful\nas well so it's not either or\nbut i guarantee you probably want your\nchildren to be happy right and if you're\nworking a job that you don't love or it\ndoesn't light you up\nwhat if they were to go do the same\nthing what if you were to fast forward\n20 years and see your children stuck in\nthe exact same position that you're\nstuck in what would that feel like\nthink about that\nyou can't tell them to build their\ndreams when you're staying in your\nprofessional prison prison because\nthey're going to see the exact same\nthing right\nso next thing you spend most of your\nwaking hours working\nso this should be something that is\nextremely important to you you spend\nmost of your waking hours doing work\nsome form of work right so is it a\npassion\nis it a purpose for you or is it a waste\nthink about that the thing that you\nshould do is listening to this podcast\nis take a good long look at yourself in\nthe mirror\nand i always say this if you've listened\nmy podcast on if you've heard me say\nthis\nit's okay not to know what your purpose\nis right now on this planet it's okay\nyou don't have to know at this very\nmoment\nbut if you don't know what it is it's\nnot okay to not be in constant search\nfor what your purpose is\nlet me say that again it's okay not to\nknow what your purpose in this world is\nit's not okay to not be in constant\nsearch for what that purpose of yours is\nso if you're sitting there and listening\nthis you might know what your purpose is\nyou might have a feeling\nright once again go with the feeling go\nwith the gut your gut always knows your\ngut is your emotional compass your brain\ntries to talk you out of everything\nthat is outside of your comfort zone\nyour gut feeling is your emotional\ncompass it always knows what you should\ndo the problem is your gut only speaks\nto you in feelings it doesn't speak two\nin words so you've got to feel your way\ninto this what do i feel is the right\nstep for me what is it that lights me up\nwhat would make me so excited to do this\nthing\nthat's you've got to ask yourself\nsame way i understand\nit's scary as hell it's so freaking\nscary to leave what it is that you're\ndoing that's paying your bills that is\nsafety in order to basically jump off a\ncliff and think that as you're jumping\neventually a parachute will build itself\nright\ni had a i remember and i told this story\na few weeks ago i remember uh when i was\nterrified when i first left the job the\nmonth i left the job i was like i got to\ngo back to getting another job i got i\nwas so used to getting the uh the golden\nrat pellets as we call them the golden\nrat pellets is the paycheck every two\nweeks right it's this golden rat pellet\nuh and and so basically it's this thing\nthat you're so used to getting and when\nyou stop getting it kind of scares the\n out of you right and i remember\nbeing terrified and i said this a few\nepisodes ago like i said but i went home\nand my sister gave me a box that was my\ndad's stuff and one of them was a letter\nthat was in there that he wrote to my\nsister about a year before he passed\naway and at the end of it it said i hope\nyou live your life with courage love and\nlaughter\nand i was so terrified that i needed\nthat this whole thing wouldn't work\ni was in so much fear\nand the opposite of fear is courage and\nin this letter said courage love and\nlaughter and so i literally got it\ntattooed on my arm it says live your\nlife with courage love and laughter it's\nmy dad's handwriting it's tattooed on my\narm because i needed a constant reminder\nwhen i was scared this every single day\nthat what i was doing was the thing that\ni was supposed to be doing it's the\nthing that the reason was put on this\nplanet right and i needed the courage\nevery time i felt the fear and so every\ntime i'd be like should i go back to\nworking a job should i go back to\nworking a job should i go back to those\nrat pellets i look in my arm and be like\nnope that i'm not going to do it i'll\nfigure it out if i go broke if i live on\nthe streets whatever it is i'll figure\nit out\nright\nthe beautiful thing about it though\nit'll work out for you if you get the\nfeeling the gut feeling that is what\nyou're supposed to do it will eventually\nwork out\nso\ni'm gonna pose the same question to you\nthat i posed to at the beginning what\nwould you do if money were no object\nfigure out what it is\nfollow it follow your heart do it is do\nwhat it is you think that you should do\nif you don't know what it is right now\nit's okay but it's not okay to not be in\nconstant pursuit for what that thing is\ni don't mean to offend anybody but\nsome of your foundations of what you\nbuild your life upon i promise you might\nget rocked i'm going to challenge your\nbeliefs i'm going to challenge the\nfoundation of what you built your life\nupon and show you\nhow\nwe use cognitive biases to\ni guess you could say take over our own\nbrains and you know how the brain is\nactually playing tricks on us before we\neven realize it so let's dive into it\ni'm going to go over a couple different\nbias with you guys so the first one is\nsomething called confirmation bias\none of the things that's really funny\nabout being a human is we have this\nincredibly complex piece of machinery\nbetween our ears that is working without\nus ever trying to use it without us ever\nthinking about it without us\never trying to take control of it it's\nworking at all points in time and it's\ndoing what it's doing and if you don't\nknow how it works\nit could\nmess you up a little bit that's why you\nhave to understand the way that we work\nwe think that our opinions\nare a result of years of rational and\nobjective analysis right like if i say\ntell me your beliefs tell me your\nopinions and tell me why those are your\nbeliefs and your opinions you think the\nreason why is because they're a result\nof years of rational thinking and\nobjective analysis as to how the world\nworks and how you operate in it right\nnothing could be further from the truth\nthe truth is that your opinions are the\nresult of years of paying attention to\ninformation that confirmed how you\nbelieve while ignoring the information\nthat changed your would have changed\nyour perceptions so this is just all\npsychology these are all facts it's\ncalled confirmation bias you're\nliterally seeing the world seeing\neverything you're only seeing what makes\nyou feel like you're right and you're\nmissing what can prove you wrong another\nproblem with this is that you hang out\nwith people who only think exactly the\nsame as you\nbecause it's really hard to hang out\nwith somebody who has a completely\ndifferent opinion on the world like if\nyou think of your top five friends they\nthink exactly the same way that you do\nthey have the same beliefs they're\nprobably around the same weight they\nprobably eat the same as you they work\nout around the same amount of time that\nyou work out they probably have the same\npolitical affiliations as you we hang\nout with people who only think exactly\nthe way that we think which then\nconfirms even more of our bias of yes\nthe way that we work in this world is\nright so the friends that we hang out\nwith\nthat's the first thing the people we\nsurround ourselves with\nhere's another thing that's really hard\nabout it the news that you watch if you\nwatch the news your only way i promise\nyou that if you're of a political\naffiliation or certain beliefs you're\nonly watching the news that is going to\ntalk to you the way that you believe and\nto watch news on the other side really\nrocks the foundation for a lot of people\nand the third thing is online you're\nprobably only following people who think\nthe same as you which then confirms that\nthe way that you think is right because\nyou can see how many people think this\nway this isn't necessarily a negative\nthing it's not a positive thing either\nit just is the way that it is but when\nyou understand this you start to think\nto yourself are my beliefs actually my\nbeliefs or is it a little bit of nature\nand nurture is it the way that i was\nraised you know my parents told me this\nthis this this and then i just started\nhanging out with people who literally\nhave the same beliefs as my parents in\nsome sort of way or you could have maybe\nnot enjoyed your parents in the way that\nthey were so you started hanging out\npeople that were the exact opposite of\nthem that confirm the way that you\nbelieve very rarely do i hear people\ngoing yeah i love to hang out with\npeople that don't think the same as me i\nlove to hang out people of a different\npolitical party of different opinions of\ndifferent thoughts and feelings and all\nof that stuff and there was actually to\ngive you an idea of of how people read\nin 2009 ohio state did a study that\nfound that people people read\nor excuse me spent 36 more time reading\nessays that aligned with their opinions\npeople want to read what is going to\ntell them that they they are correct now\nwhy is this really bad\nbecause there's another side of the\nstreet and you never really see the\nother side of the street now this was\nbad before social media the reason why\nsocial media ends up being worse than\nwhat makes this worse is because there's\nalgorithms you know if you look at\ninstagram and you look at facebook and\nyou look at youtube and twitter and\nlinkedin all of those things are they're\njust computers there's not people\nrunning those there's people that build\nthese things called algorithms an\nalgorithm is a computer that just you\nknow a line of code that says if this\nperson clicks like on this person's post\nshow them more of their posts and so\nwhat happens is we create with with\nalgorithms with the people that we hang\nout the news that we watch the\nalgorithms that exist we create an echo\nchamber of only hearing our beliefs\nbecause here's the way that facebook\nworks let me just give you a real quick\nexample right i understand the\nalgorithms at a very deep level\nonly because i think of everything on a\ncomputer all of these social medias and\nalgorithms that's the way that i was\nable to build a following of over three\nmillion people between instagram and\nfacebook is i was always thinking\nalgorithmically and i was always\nthinking psychologically if i can\nunderstand the way people think and i\ncan understand the way that computers\nthink i can then put out information\nthat people want to see and then also it\ncan start to go viral facebook only\nmakes money when you stay on facebook\nbecause then you see the ads the only\nway they're making money is through the\nads that's it there is no other way that\ni'm aware of i mean there might be other\nthings that are outside of it but\nfacebook as a company makes their money\nby selling\nselling advertisements and putting those\nadvertisements in front of you they make\nmoney when you stay on facebook so they\nwill give you what you want so if i'm of\na specific political party and i start\nto like certain things which i'm not i'm\nnot a part of any political party but if\ni was and i start to like a certain\nperson stuff facebook is then going to\nshow me more people who i might not even\nfollow who have the same political\naffiliation as me why because i want to\nread things that confirm that i'm right\nso you're seeing even more of what makes\nyou think that you're right all of those\nthings firm up the belief that anything\ndifferent than what you believe is\nabsolutely incorrect and you can feel it\nphysically can't you when someone\nchallenges your beliefs you can feel it\nphysically inside of your body as if\nyou're getting attacked that's why you\nsee so many adults acting like children\nin the comments section of youtube and\nfacebook and instagram is because they\nare literally feeling physically\nattacked by other people because they\ndon't\nthey don't like seeing things outside of\nwhat they think is right to them so you\nonly like to be told what you already\nknow how ridiculous is that though to\nthink that we already know everything in\neverything that we know is right right\nlike how how ridiculous is it for me to\nbe like i already know everything and\neverything that i believe is actually\ncorrect that's ridiculous isn't it and\nconsciously i think everybody who's\nlistening right now knows how insane\nthat sounds for me to go i'm right on\neverything that i think and everything\nthat i believe and everything that i\nknow is correct and i already also\nalready know everything and we can\nconsciously think that like wow that\nsounds ridiculous that sounds i would\nnever think that way\ni'm not like that no way but if i were\nto bring up a big issue that you believe\nin whatever that big issue is and tell\nyou that you're wrong then we can really\nsee how you react then there's usually a\ntrigger and that trigger shows you where\nyou're not free any trigger that\nanything that triggers you shows you\nwhere you're stuck in life if\nsomeone comes up to me and brings up\nsome big issue\nand i get pissed it's showing me where\ni'm still stuck in life that's in the\nmoment you know how you spend your time\nwith people\nwho you spend your time with what you\nspend your time learning we will only\nsearch for things that teach us not\nalways and i want to say always but most\nof the time unless you're aware of it we\nwill search for things that are going to\nshow us that what we believe in is\ncorrect what about when something you\nbelieve ends up being bad\nor you voted for somebody and they did\nsomething bad now we roll into what's\ncalled another cognitive bias and it's\ncalled choice supportive bias first off\nwe have confirmation bias which means\nthat i'm only going to\nread the news that supports my beliefs\nor i'm only going to hang out with these\npeople that support my beliefs and it's\nnot just political beliefs but it's all\ntypes of beliefs it could be religious\nbeliefs it could just be spiritual\nbeliefs it could be whatever it is\nthere's so many different beliefs that\nwe have i want to be around people who\nsupport my beliefs so now we roll into\nanother cognitive bias which is called\nchoice supportive bias when you make a\ndecision\nwhatever that decision is\nwe will only see the positives this is\nso crazy when you actually start to\nthink about it we will only see the\npositives in that decision most of the\ntime and not see the negative let me\ngive you a real good example right i\nhave an iphone i had an iphone for i had\na samsung for the longest time and i\nswitched about five years ago four years\nago to a an iphone and uh and then you\nnotice that people on the samsung side\nhates iphones and they'll tell you why\niphones are the worst and people on the\niphone side will hate samsung and\nthey'll tell you why those are wrong so\nlike let's say i have an iphone right\nwe'll make it something just\nsilly and simple that does happen right\ni have an iphone and overnight\nit decides and wants to update and then\nthere's a bunch of bugs and it starts to\nfail and my friend allen who has a\nsamsung i do have a friend of mine he\nhas a samsung we we always talk about\nthis and we always make fun of them\nbecause we're like hey i'm going to air\ndrop you some photos alan oh\ni can't right and so we always make\nthese jokes with him but he's hardcore\nhe will not switch because he's just so\nhardcore in it and uh and so let's say\nmy phone updates\nand something fails\nand my friend allen comes over and he's\nlike well yeah of course it did because\nthat would never happen with the samsung\nright what's gonna happen with me i need\nto then back up my choice to have bought\nan iphone right this is this is the the\nperfect example of choice supportive\nbias i\nmade a choice\ni need to now support that choice and\nshow why that choice was right so i need\nto back up my choice for the iphone oh\nyeah well you know maybe it messed up\ntoday but alan we know that the pictures\nare so much better on the iphone we know\nthat the ecosystem makes it so much you\nknow what i don't care if it fails\nbecause eventually when the bug gets\nfixed i'm at least going to have the\necosystem the ecosystem is the best part\nof it we see this happening all of the\ntime with political parties don't we\ndemocrats versus republicans one party\ndoes something wrong and you know let's\nsay i'm a part of a political party x\nand my my political party does something\nabsolutely wrong i'll just look over it\nand explain why my party's still better\nand then political party y does\nsomething wrong and my friend who's part\nof political party y is oh yeah but you\nknow that's okay because we're still\nbetter in this way and what happens is\nif i'm part of political party x\nand political party y does something bad\ni'll only see they're bad but i won't\nsee any of the good stuff that they do\nbecause i have to prove to myself why my\ndecision to vote for political party x\nwas the correct decision then person of\npolitical party y will only see all of\nthe bad and political party acts and\nthey won't see any of the good because\nwe have to confirm\nand we have to show that our choice was\nthe right choice\neven if it's blatantly obvious that\nsomething's wrong we see people do this\nall the time with presidents that they\nvote for and no matter what country\nthat's your i'm sure you see this right\nyou vote for a president the president\ndoes something\nand the person who voted for him will\ncompletely miss it and explain why he's\nstill better even though it's blatantly\nobvious to the thing that he did you\nknow how even though it's blatantly\nobvious that maybe their party did\nsomething or maybe that person sucks why\ndo we do this why do we have to feel i\nmean if you really think about it it's\nit's a frail ego is really what it is we\nas humans\nwant to feel like we're really\nconcrete in who we are what we believe\nin what we do a lot of times we don't\neven like knowing that we're wrong\nand we don't like being told that we're\nwrong and we don't like someone proving\nthat we're wrong and we'll do anything\nto see ways that we're not wrong so we\ntend to rationalize our choices\nespecially when they're bad why because\nwe have to tell her oh my gosh that was\na bad person to vote for oh my gosh\nthat's a bad political party to vote for\noh that was a bad you know purchase of\nmy iphone we have to show ourselves why\nthat thing that we decided to do in our\npast was correct so we have to know who\nwe are\nnothing makes a\nand i've worked with thousands of people\nnothing will shake a person up more than\nwhen their beliefs of who they think\nthey are are foundationally shook up\nit's so hard for them to do it it causes\nsomething called cognitive dissonance\ncognitive dissonance means i believe\nthat the world is this way i believe\nthat this is right and this is right and\nthis is right and we can get facts on\nfacts on facts as to why that's wrong\nand you can literally see somebody\nattack\nbefore listening\nto going um\ni might have actually really been wrong\nit causes cognitive dissonance the way\nthat i think that the world is is\nactually not the way that the world is\nso what's the solution\ni know that nobody listening to this\nconsciously\nyou know wants to consciously be stuck\nin their way\nunopened to hear other people's sides\nand other people's stories because if we\ndon't open ourselves up to hearing other\npeople's opinions\neventually we're going to get old and\nsenile and stuck like you've seen people\nwho have been stuck in their ways for a\nlong time and it gets more and more hard\nand concrete the longer that they live\nthat way so what can we do\nchallenge ourselves when you have a\nbelief\nask yourself first off is this my belief\nor is this a belief that was put into me\nas a child is this what my parents\nbelieved is this what society told me to\nbelieve is this what my friends believe\nso i just kind of followed the group\nchallenge your beliefs start asking\nyourself is this what i truly believe in\nis this belief right\nchallenge your thoughts\nchallenge your past decisions and be\nopen to the fact that maybe we're not\nright a lot of times maybe we're wrong a\nlot of times it's okay\nand be open to other sides of the road\nother sides of street other people's\nopinions thoughts and just think maybe\ni'm not always writing everything that i\nbelieve do different things push\nyourself outside of your comfort zone go\ntalk to someone who doesn't think the\nsame as you allow yourself to be\nchallenged in ways that you've never\nbeen challenged nothing is worse than\nsomeone who thinks that they're right\nstays in that decision for the rest of\nyour life and gets old and hard and\nsenile and oh i'm concrete and who i am\nthat's called a fixed mindset i don't\nknow about you i want to have a growth\nmindset of i can change i can be\ndifferent i want people to come in and\nbe like you're wrong and this is why\nyou're wrong and i want them to piss me\noff so i can find my triggers right this\nis why a lot of people get older and\nthey get ridiculously firm in their\nbeliefs\nwe see it all of the time and so you\nhave to realize\nwe have to be open\nto not being right all the time we have\nto be open to learning to the fact that\nwhat we believe in isn't correct we have\nto be open to the fact that you know\nwhat the way that i see the world is\nactually not correct and we have to be\nokay and not have a small small ego that\nthat just gets shook so easily to go you\nknow what\ni'm learning i'm growing i made a\ndecision my past it wasn't good i'm\ntrying to improve i'm trying to get\nbetter this belief that i have let me\nchallenge let me figure out where it\ncame from let me see if it's actually\nwhat i believe in\nbecause i don't know about you i\nconstantly want to try to learn and grow\nand when i understand that these biases\nexist i understand why i think the way\nthat i think i understand why i act the\nway that i act and so if you can\nunderstand these two cognitive biases\nnumber one is confirmation bias be\naround people and do things that that\nmake you think different that are\noutside\nof the way that you think matu is choice\nsupportive bias maybe my decisions in\nthe past weren't right maybe that\npurchase wasn't right maybe that vote\nwasn't right whatever it is and realize\nthat to get into something called\ncognitive dissonance where my world view\nis flipped over on top of its head and\nnow i have to start to you know pick up\nthe pieces and put it together is a good\nthing the more that i can get my brain\nblown\ninto shreds and then try to pick up all\nthe pieces and put it back together the\nstronger that i feel my mind gets it's\nthe same way with growing a muscle the\nonly way to grow a muscle is to go in\nand\nlift really heavy and destroy that\nmuscle for it to grow and destroy that\nmuscle for its grown destroy that muscle\nfor it to grow it's the exact same way\nwith your brain and with your mind\nconstantly be challenging yourself\nconstantly to be challenging your\nbeliefs constantly challenging your\nthoughts and constantly challenging your\npast decisions so that you don't allow\nyourself to get stuck so that your brain\nisn't always playing tricks on you there\nare studies that have been done that\nfound out that up to 50\nof the memories that you have in your\nhead are not accurate\nthey're not true\nup to 50 of them and a lot of times\nyou're actually not even remembering the\nactual event you're remembering the\nmemory of the actual event so it's kind\nof like playing telephone right where\nyou know somebody says something in\nsomeone's ear and it goes around and by\nthe time it gets to the other to the\nlast person it's a completely different\nphrase or it's also kind of like if\nyou've ever used a copy machine like if\nyou take a copy machine and you you\nplace it on on the copy you know take a\npicture you put on the copy machine you\ncopy it and then you take that copy not\nthe original picture but you take that\ncopy and put on the copy machine and you\ncopy it you take the next copy and you\nput it you copy it and you copy it and\nyou copy and you copy and copy it and\nyou look at the original photo and then\nyou look at 15 copies in you're looking\nat you're like that this doesn't even\nlook the same that's how a lot of our\nmemories are now this is not done in a\nmalicious way in any sort of way it's\njust the way the human brain works and\nso you might have a memory\nbut it might be completely different\nthan actual truth because of how many\ntimes you've gone through it\nalso though people that you talk to\npeople that you work with people that\nare your employees people that you're\nclose to have this exact same thing and\nso there's three different types of\nthings that people do when they remember\nsomething and they tell you about it so\nif i'm remembering a memory\nan event whatever it is\nand then i'm going to tell you about it\nthe reason why this is interesting is\nbecause i can do one of three things\ni can generalize i can delete or i can\ndistort and i coach i teach coaches how\nto grow coaching businesses and part of\nthat you know i teach them\nhow to coach other people i teach them\nhow to grow the business but i also\nteach them how to coach other people and\ni tell everybody when you're coaching\nsomebody be very aware that they're\ngoing to delete they're going to distort\nand they're going to generalize the\nstuff that they tell you and once again\nit's not their their fault it's not\nmalicious they're not doing it on\npurpose they don't even know that\nthey're doing it most people are not\neven i would say 99.9 of people\nare not even aware this is going on but\nit's important for you to understand\nbecause number one you need to\nunderstand this about yourself and\nyou're going to find out why that's\nimportant in just a little while but\nit's also really important for you to\nunderstand other people as well now\nbefore we dive into these three\ndifferent things\nthere is something really important to\nbring up before i talk about\ngeneralizing deleting and distorting\nthere's one really important thing to\nbring up everybody is viewing the world\ndifferently so you and i can be in a\nroom and we could you know be looking at\nthe exact same room but we're all seeing\nsomething differently it's like we're\nall wearing different colored glasses\nlike if i'm wearing red glasses and i'm\nlooking at the world\nand you're right next to me and you're\nwearing green light glasses and you're\nlooking at the world we're going to be\nseeing all of the exact same stuff the\nsame bushes the same cars the same sun\nsky leaves we're going to see all the\nsame stuff but it's all going to look\ndifferent simply because we're wearing\ndifferent colored glasses and that's the\nequivalent of people who are filtering\nthe their reality\nthrough\nall of their programs through their life\nthrough their past through their\njudgments through their traumas through\neverything that's ever happened to them\nso i'll give you an example let's say me\nand you are walking down the street\nright\nwe're walking down the street and uh we\nwalk by a dog that's on the other side\nof a fence and maybe the dog runs up to\nthe fence doesn't even bark just runs up\nto the fence\nand let's say that when you were younger\nyou were attacked by a dog and i wasn't\nand then later on in the day you might\nsay something oh yeah what about like\nwhat about that dog when we're on the\nwalk\ni might be like i don't i don't remember\nany dog what are you talking about but\nyou might remember it\nand you might remember it simply because\nthe sight of the dog\nthat you saw running clicked into your\nhead reminded you of an event a trauma\nit put your body into a heightened state\nof emotion it brought all of your\nattention to that dog to make sure is\nthis a threat do i need to run do i need\nto fight do i need to flee what is it\nthat i need to do and so even if i\ndidn't notice a reaction from you\nyour body did a ton of different things\nbio like bio biologically\nneurobiologically all of those things\ndid a ton of different processing and it\nwas a super heightened state you need to\nmake sure you didn't get attacked\nbecause simply you were attacked when\nyou were a child but let's say at that\nexact same moment that the dog was there\ni was looking at some palm trees and the\nreason i was looking at palm trees was\nbecause i've been thinking about putting\npalm trees on my property so i've been\nin the market for buying palm trees i've\nbeen talking to\nlandscapers where they've designed where\nthe palm trees are going to go i've been\nfiguring out how much you know they're\ngoing to cost me and i'm like oh my god\nthey're going to cost so much money just\nget a freaking palm tree on my property\nso we're in the exact same moment at the\nexact same place but you're seeing a dog\nbecause of the way that the world is\nfiltering through your brain i'm seeing\npalm trees because of the way that the\nworld is filtering through my brain\nwe're seeing the exact same thing but\nwe're both seeing something different\nthat's why memories a lot of times oddly\nenough it's hard to say can't always be\ntrusted because i was completely unaware\nof something that was happening and you\nwere completely aware of something that\nwas happening as well we're both walking\non the same street but we're both seeing\nand remembering two completely different\nthings so that's the first thing to know\nbefore we dive into the three different\nways that the world changes right let's\ndive into it generalizing so people will\ngeneralize what's going on so when i\nused to work in a sales company i had\nyou know i had trained a couple thousand\nsales reps under me and my sales reps\nused to come in and they used to do\nthese things called phone jams where\nthey'd sit down and they'd want to make\na bunch of phone calls to set up\nappointments so they could you know set\nup their demonstration and go sell their\nproducts every single phone jam this\nwould happen someone would come in to\nwork\nand then they'd work for about an hour\nand a half two hours and i'd walk up to\nthem i'd be like hey john how's it going\nsomething along these lines would happen\nevery single time\noh i've made so many phone calls but\nnobody's home\nand i would say\nnobody's home yeah nobody's home and i\nwould say we used to be in fort\nlauderdale is where i have my office so\nthat's broward county i would say john\nthere's 1.7 million people in broward\ncounty in the surrounding areas\nwithin 30 minutes of our location 1.7\nmillion people and you're telling me\nthat nobody\nis home\nnobody there's not one person have 1.7\nmillion people and they go oh well it's\nnot that it's not a nobody's home\nit's just you know the people that i've\nbeen around and i've been calling\nhaven't been home i'm like okay how many\nphone calls have you made oh i've been\nmaking a ton i've been here for two\nhours okay how many of you made i don't\nknow i haven't been tracking it okay\njohn give me your phone real quick and\ni'd have them give me their phone i look\nat and i go john you've literally been\nhere for two hours you've made seven\nphone calls how many of those people\nare not home uh well three of them\ndidn't pick up and four people said no\nokay so john do you realize what\nhappened here\nyou called three people who weren't home\nand then you generalized that 1.7\nmillion people would not be home\ndo you see how when you speak in\nabsolutes of nobody is home how that is\ngoing to change the actions that you're\ngoing to take because think about this\nlet me take myself out of this this\nsituation just talk directly to you guys\ndon't you see how if you speak in an\nabsolute nobody's home nobody likes me\nthere's never any opportunities for me\ni've whatever your absolutes are when\nyou have an absolute it's really hard to\npull yourself out of that absolute it's\nlike digging a ditch that you can't get\nout of so when someone says nobody is\nhome\ndoes that motivate them to make more\nphone calls no of course not it actually\ndemotivates them from making any more\nphone calls because why would they keep\nmaking calls if nobody's home and so\nwhat happens is in this case this is\njust a simple example but i want you to\nthink of how many times in your life you\ngeneralize\nin in place an absolute over something\nthat is not absolute nobody's home is an\nexample\nor you know you've been on a couple bad\ndates and there's no good guys left\nright or you've had a couple girls cheat\non you and you say all women are\ncheaters right and you're putting an\nabsolute and you're generalizing an\nentire population of 3.75 billion people\nby placing an absolute on top of it\nright so people tend to generalize\nwhenever they retell a story this is\nimportant for you to know so that you\ncan work on your own personal and start\nthinking about how you generalize but\nit's also important for when you talk to\nother people and people are telling you\nthe story you can go oh yeah that's\nthat's a generalization no big deal i\ndon't need to call the person out but i\ncan hear them speaking absolutely i can\nhear them generalizing what they're\ntalking about so that's the first thing\npeople do is they will generalize the\nsecond thing that people do is they will\ndelete\nthey will take an actual story\nand they will remove pieces of the story\nto fit their narrative or to fit how\nthey currently feel\nright so they'll remove pieces of the\nstory or they'll remove pieces of the\nreality so that it fits their story and\nit fits their narrative\nso\nhow often do you delete\nthink about that for a second how often\ndo you go through and you delete\ninformation\nfrom a story when the story was there it\nwas right in front of you but you\ndeleted it\nright how often do you hear other people\ntake bits and pieces of stories and\ndelete certain aspects of it\nright where someone's like oh yeah you\nknow\nlike somebody\npeople have done this before right oh\nyeah i just can't find a good guy all\nguys are cheaters but they forgot to\ntell you that they cheated on him first\nright\nsomething like that could happen where\nthey delete a piece of the story so that\nthe story fits the narrative that they\nhave\nso\nhow often do you delete the information\nand not necessarily\ntell the truth\nbut you just remove a couple pieces that\nare\nkind of important for people to know\nright so that's the second thing people\ndo is they will delete good for you to\nknow for yourself but also for other\npeople\nand the last piece of what they'll do is\nthey will distort\nright and this happened with one of my\nteam members one of my my people that\nare on my team\nand we were talking about important\nappointments this is actually this\nmorning and uh he didn't have his week\nfully booked up\nright today's thursday so\nit was this morning so we're talking\nmonday tuesday wednesday today was\nthursday and which means he only has\ntoday and tomorrow to get the rest of\nhis appointments booked up and so he\nsaid\nhe was going to come up short for his\nweekly goals and he said i did\neverything i could do which is you know\nonce again\ntaking all of the blame off of himself\nand putting his blame ex externally and\ni was like okay you did everything you\ncould do which is a form of deletion i'm\nsorry distortion i said you did\neverything you could do and he's like\nyeah and i said everything\nand he's like yeah and i said okay\nis there a possibility\nthat you could have stayed up until\nmidnight and i don't want him to say up\nto midnight but i just you know gave\nthis example that you could have stayed\nup until midnight trying to book up the\nrest of your week and he's like yeah and\ni go so did you do everything you could\ndo he's like well no and i was like\nlisten i don't want you to work until\nmidnight but i want you to become aware\nof the fact that you just spoke and said\neverything i could do which means that\nyou're taking all of the blame off\nyourself and you're blaming it\nexternally when you blame on something\nexternally it takes all of your power\naway because you don't have power or\ncontrol over anything externally the\nonly thing you have power control over\nis yourself another example i gave him i\nsaid okay\nlet's say\nthat on monday let's say that he wanted\nto do 20 appointments i'm just going to\nuse an example right he want to do 20\nappointments that was his goal and today\nhe's short of those 20 appointments he's\nnot going to hit that number what if on\nmonday i would have said listen i don't\neven want you to work till midnight i\nwant you to work just working hours just\nnine to five and if you get these 20\nappointments booked up i will pay you\none million dollars cash\nbut you have to get those 20 points\nbooked up you have to complete the 20\nappointments\ndo you think that if i would have\nbrought that to your attention and told\nyou that that you would have gotten your\nappointments booked up and he's like\nyeah i would have and i said so\nis it true that you did everything that\nyou could\nand he's like no i guess it's not and i\nwas like do you see how that's a form of\ndistortion you distorted the story and\nthere's no judgment i'm just trying to\nmake him aware of it so that he can now\nhave power over his own life and his own\nnarrative because i want him to hit his\ngoals i want him to make the money he\nwants to make but what i have to make\nhim understand is how this narrative of\ndoing everything that i could do is\ncomplete and once he is aware\nof that the next time it pops up he's\nable to change his narrative to fit so\nthat he can hit his goals so you know if\ni would have given him a million dollars\ncash\nand i said complete 20 appointments he\nwould have probably completed 40\nappointments just in case he heard me\nwrong right don't you think he would be\nlike i got to make that million dollars\ni'm gonna do 40 appointments just in\ncase maybe i heard him maybe he said\nsomething maybe i didn't completely\nunderstand if i do 40 though i know i'm\ndefinitely going to hit that number so\nyou can distort reality\nbecause did you do everything you could\ndo no that was a distortion so when you\nlook at these things you have to realize\nthat all of the memories of your past\nyou've got to look back at them and\nrealize that we give a lot\nof power to our past we get a lot of\npower to our story and we are the way\nthat we are because of our past how\noften do we think that how often do we\nsay that i am the way that i am because\nof my pastor i am the way i am because\nof my mom or because of my dad because\nof my sister because of whatever\nhappened to me but how true is that if\nup to 50 of what we remember could be\nfalse maybe we are the way that we are\nbecause of our perception\nor could be false perception of what\nhappened to us in our past so maybe\nwe're giving out all of our power away\nto something that isn't even actually\ntrue and might be completely false maybe\nwhat we're doing is we're basing our\nlife off of a past that isn't even\nactually true\nmaybe what we should do is we should\nstart thinking deeper about everything\nthat we do and go you know what if\nthat's the case if maybe a lot of stuff\nthat i see and hear and\nheard in my past and all these things\nmight not be true\nmaybe i can take my own power back and\ngo it doesn't matter what happened in\nthe past because half of that isn't even\ntrue in the first place what matters is\nwhat i do right now what matters is that\ni'm going to take all of the blame all\nof the responsibility i'm going to put\nit on myself and say you know what no\nmatter what goes on no matter what\nhappens i'm going to\ndo what needs to be done to create the\nlife that i want to create because at\nthat moment you take your power back and\nyou say it doesn't matter if i delete it\ndoesn't matter if i distort it doesn't\nmatter if i generalize it doesn't matter\nwhat happened to me in my past it\ndoesn't matter what color glasses i wear\ni'm going to let go of all of that bs\nand what i'm going to do is i'm going to\nstep into a powerful version of myself\nbecause my past isn't 100 true\nthen the only thing i know is true is\nwhere i'm sitting right now and the\nactions that i take right now and the\nactions that i take right now will then\ncreate the future that i want because\nyour memories aren't necessarily true so\ndon't base your life on the past base\nyour life on the future of what it is\nthat you're going to create this is\ngoing to be kind of groundbreaking and\nmind-blowing for a lot of people 99 of\npeople listening to me right now or\nwatching me however you're consuming\nthis content\nyour perception of yourself is\ncompletely false and let me explain to\nyou why that is there's a quote that's\nreally good that i'm going to give you\nfrom a guy named charles cooley and the\nquote summarizes all of this perfectly\nand he says i'm not who i think i am i'm\nnot who you think i am i am who i think\nthat you think i am\nnow what the hell does that mean let me\nsay one more time i'm not who i think i\nam i'm not who you think i am i am who i\nthink that you think that i am so what\nexactly does this even mean well let's\ndive into it most people think that they\nare who they are through their own\nperception\nof what they think other people think\nthey are so i think\nthat i am the person that i see that you\nthink that i am now this is a really big\nproblem because we're dealing with a\nperception of a perception right so not\nonly is all of this completely false\nit's so far from who you truly are but\nso many people i'm going to tell you why\nthis is but so many people have built\ntheir entire lives their entire identity\neverything that they know about\nthemselves that they love about\nthemselves that they hate about\nthemselves off of a perception of what\nthey think that they actually are and it\nall starts off because in reality the\nway that we learn the world and how to\nnavigate through the world\nis through our parents but we also learn\nwho we are\nthrough our parents we start off and we\nbecome who we think our parents think we\nare that's the reason why parents need\nto be so careful with what they say\naround their kids and what they do\naround their kids because the children\nare literally going to build themself up\nbased off of what they see what they\nthink what they hear children become who\nthey think their parents think they are\nright and you know it's it's terrible\nbut some children are verbally abused\nwhen they're younger it's a terrible\nthing and a lot of people never get over\nit why because even though a lot of\npeople consciously know as adults once\nthey grow up they consciously know that\nthe things that may have been said to\nthem when they were not when they were\nyou know little tiny children and they\nwere just a sponge they might\nconsciously know those things are false\nbut in their subconscious their\nsubconscious is still holding it as true\nbecause they're not consciously thinking\na lot as a child if an adult comes up to\na child and says you are stupid the\nchild a lot of times is you know two\nthree four years old is not sitting\nthere and actually saying well is this\ntrue is this false is this true is this\nfalse it's like a big human just came up\nto me and told me i'm stupid they're\nsmarter than i am i don't know how to\nnavigate this world perfectly still so\nthey must be right i must be stupid and\nsome people will be told something by an\nadult as a child\nand they take that as their truth and\nthey act like it's their truth for the\nrest of their life but the problem\nwith that is that we're living our lives\nthrough what we see in other people and\nwe also have a\nreally\nbig problem and the big problem is that\npeople who are talking to you\nas a child\nas you're growing up as a teenager and\neven right now every single person has a\nskewed perception based off of their\nchildhood so looking\nto somebody else\nfor information on who you are is like\nlooking into a broken mirror to see what\nyou look like let me say that again\nlooking to someone else for information\nabout who you are is like looking into a\nbroken mirror to see what you look like\nyou'll never see the true picture\nbecause everybody who you talk to has\ndifferent paradigms and different\nperceptions of the world around them and\nso you're going to be seeing yourself\nthrough this broken perception which\nisn't true and so if you if you base off\nyour if you base your entire life based\noff of someone else's perception you're\ngoing to be living something that's\ncompletely false\nimagine this real quick and i'll bring\nthis together so it makes more sense and\nit's not as abstract let's imagine that\nyou remind someone of their dad\nright maybe you look like him maybe you\ntalk like him\nmaybe you know you uh you have the same\ntype of personality whatever let's just\nsay that they loved their dad\nhe was an amazing man he did everything\nthat he could he's still around he loves\nthe hell out of this person and you\nremind that person of their dad then\nthey are going to have amazing feelings\naround you and that's going to show when\nthey are around you and when someone has\namazing feelings towards you and they\nlet that show\nwell what's going to happen it will make\nyou feel good about yourself and you'll\nthink man i must be a good person i must\ni must you know you feel good when\nsomeone feels good around you right so\nif they love if you remind someone of\ntheir dad\nwhatever it is that reminds them\nthen you're going to have this\nperception of yourself through that\nperson who love their dad and be like\ndamn i must be really awesome because\nthat person really liked me okay now\nlet's flip it\nlet's say that you just happen to look\nlike their dad or you look like their\nmother if you're a female let's say\ntheir dad or their mom was a terrible\nperson and you just happen to look just\nlike him\nthen what are they gonna think of you\nit has nothing to do with you and who\nyou are it has everything to do based\noff of their perception of another\nperson in their childhood that they're\nbringing to them now they're not going\nto like you not because it's your fault\nbut simply because of their own\nperception of what you remind them of\nand it might make you feel worse about\nyourself because you don't even know\nthat you remind them of their dad\nneither one of those situations whether\nthey like you or whether they don't like\nyou based off of whether they like their\ndad or whether they don't like their dad\nneither one of those has anything to do\nwith you and that's why this is so\ndangerous that's why it's so important\nto find out who you are\nand decide who you're going to be\nyou know if i ask you right now\nlet's play a game let's do this together\nif i ask you who are you\ni want you to answer right now answer it\nin your head who are you\nanswer it think about that for a second\ntake a few seconds who are you say it\nout loud bring as many things into your\nconscious awareness that are you that\nsay who you are\nright\nand so you know some of you might say\nyour name oh i'm rob dial some of you\nmight say i am a mother of two i'm a\nfather of three i am 35 years old i am\nfrom florida i am a brother i am a\nsister i am a cousin i have i am a ceo\nof a beverage company i am a janitor at\nthe beverage company whatever it is\nyou're going to say these things i'm a\ncollege graduate i went to the\nuniversity of florida when i asked you\nwho you are you're going to start naming\noff\nexternal things\nbut none of those are actually who you\ntruly are\nnone of those things your name\nthe fact that you're a mother or father\nyour age where you're from if you're a\nbrother sister if you went to college if\nyou dropped out of college if you've got\na degree if you've got multiple degrees\nnone of those things are actually who\nyou truly are i'll give you an example\nthat makes let's let's just really try\nto dumb this down as much as possible so\ni can just like make it so it's as\nsimple as i possibly can i drive a 2018\nford raptor i am not a 2018 ford raptor\nright now you might be like oh yeah no\nthat makes complete sense of course\nyou're not why would i ever think that\nyou're a car\nwell i bought the car which means that i\nhave quote unquote achieve the buying of\na car\nso then why would you if i'm not a ford\nraptor\nthen why are you a college graduate why\nare you a mother why are these are all\nthings that you have done and some of\nyou think that you're a mother or father\nwhich you are but at the deeper level\nright at the deepest sense\nyou were someone else before you birthed\nchildren\nweren't you\nwho were you\nbecause you're always looking to the\nexternal to figure out who you are\nyou're always looking to other people or\nyour accomplishments or your pay or your\njob or what is it you do or your name\ntag to figure out who you actually are\nbut at your core level that's not who\nyou are\nright if i say i'm rob dial that's just\na bunch of you know\nsounds that were put together and given\nto me at birth i wasn't rob dial when i\nwas born though so who am i oh let's get\nreally deep right at a core level who\nare you this is why so many people have\nso much trouble when their children\nleave and they become empty nesters\nis because they are they're like\nfor years for 18 20 25 30 40 years\nsometimes they have identified\nthemselves as a parent well then when\ntheir their children leave and they\ndon't have somebody to parent they're\nalways like well who the hell am i\nit becomes this big wake-up look i don't\nknow who i am because people base who\nthey are based off of the external not\nthe internal we base it off of other\npeople's perceptions as well\nwe base everything off of other people's\nperceptions or the external but none of\nthose things are actually who you truly\nare you weren't a parent when you were\nfour years old were you\nhmm\nso being a parent is something that\nyou've done it's something that you've\naccomplished i'm not saying there's\nanything wrong with being a peer but you\nweren't a parent when you were four\nyears old\nso who are you\nyou know i wasn't a ford raptor driver\nwhen i was four years old either these\nare all just external things that we've\naccomplished over time or gotten over\ntime so you have to stop basing\nwho you are\noff of other people's perceptions of you\nor external accomplishments or things\nabout you now\nthis might be really messing with some\nof your minds but when you really get it\nyou can actually see how powerful it is\nbecause if you are none of those things\nthat you actually think that you are\nthen what are you\nyou know are you just a spiritual being\nor a soul or whatever you want to call\nit that's just inhabiting this meat suit\ncalled your body right think about that\nand this is why it's so messed up and\nthis is why we could go so deep into it\nright i'll give you a really good\nexample through a story and how this can\nchange how this this little tiny mini\nperception can completely change your\nlife right there's a story about\nthis kid and he's uh in the 11th grade\nand he's been failing all of his class\n9th grade 10th grade barely getting into\nthe next grade and his parents are\ncalled in because he has this you know\nhe's about to have to probably redo the\n11th grade he's getting terrible grades\nhe's not showing up at school he's not\nhanging out with the right kids all of\nthat stuff then his mom forces him to go\ntake the sat because she's like i really\nwant to get education i really want you\nto turn your life around and he's like\nit doesn't make any sense i'm stupid i\nfeel all of my tests i've never gotten\ngood grades i'm barely getting by and\ni'm not showing up to school because i\nknow how stupid i am she's like just go\nand take the sat so he goes and takes\nthe sat and for those of you guys that\nare in america\nsat is just a test that you have to take\nin order to get to college and he takes\nthe sat this stupid kid quote unquote\nstupid kid\nfailing in school not showing up not\nhanging without the right people\ngets a 1480 out of 1600 which is that's\nlike the top 5\nhe gets a 1480 out of 1600 he gets such\na good grade to show him how smart he is\nhis mom actually thought he cheated but\nhe didn't cheat and he realized he\ndidn't cheat he knew he didn't cheat and\nhe went oh my god\ni'm actually smarter than i thought i\nwas what the hell have i been doing and\nso he looks at this and says i'm smarter\nthan i thought i was maybe i if i did so\nwell in the sats imagine what would\nhappen if i started studying so he\nstarts waking up earlier so that he can\nstudy he starts changing who he's\nhanging out with he starts showing up to\nschool more because he's like oh my gosh\nif i'm smart maybe i can actually do\nbetter and he changes his entire life\naround starts getting amazing grades\ngets into an ivy league school becomes a\nsuper successful entrepreneur\nright and here's the crazy thing about\nit every 12 years the sats what they do\nis they review all of their tests and\nthey go through them\nand when they went back through this\nguy's test he got something in the mail\nthat that said that he actually didn't\nget a 1480 what he got was a 740.\nwhat happened was the machine\naccidentally doubled his score so he got\na 740 out of 1600 which is not good\nbut he thought he got a 1480. but\nbecause of the fact that his little\nliterally a couple numbers on a piece of\npaper changed his entire perception of\nwho he thought he was he started showing\nup differently he started realizing that\nhe was smart he started taking you know\ntime to wake up earlier he changed the\npeople he was around he started studying\nfor his exams he started going to school\nand paying attention more and taking all\nof the notes that he needed to his\nperception of himself changed based off\nof seeing a few numbers on a piece of\npaper and what happened because his\nperception of his self changed he\nchanged\nnow think about how powerful that is\nfor that person to change their life\ncompletely based off of literally four\nnumbers on a piece of paper think about\nall of the things in your life that\nyou've been basing your life off what\npeople have said about you what people\nhave done the things that you've done\nthe accomplishments that you have or\nhaven't had you can be\nliterally whoever you want to be if this\nkid is failing out of school and can get\ninto an ivy league school and become a\nsuccessful entrepreneur based off of\nfour numbers on a piece of paper you can\nbe literally whoever the f you want to\nbe\nso who do you want to be\nbecause this entire episode all i've\nbeen talking about how all of the things\nthat you think you are are complete bs\nso if that's the truth then who do you\nwant to be you can wake up every single\nday and decide who you want to be and i\ndon't mean i want to be somebody who's a\nmillionaire i want to be somebody who\nhas you know accomplished this i want to\nbe somebody who's driving a ferrari i\nwant to be someone who's got an amazing\nfamily i want to be an amazing parent\ni'm not talking about any of those\nthings those are all still external and\nthis is why it can be hard because we\nbase our literally our entire perception\nof everything based off external i want\nto turn it to internal who do you want\nto be before you walk out of your door\nget out of your bed who do you want to\nbe internally before any of those things\ncome up to you do you want to be kind do\nyou want to be loving do you want to be\nhumble do you want to be sweet do you\nwant to be generous who do you want to\nbe at every single moment of your life\nand how do you want to show up for other\npeople before the accomplishments before\npeople see before people decide who you\nare you decide who you want to be no one\nelse\nwhat you do is the same way that when\nyou get in your car and go to a place\nthat you've never been before you get\nyour phone out and you set your gps\nyou want to figure out how to go from\nwhere you are to where you want to be\nyou set your gps so if you wake up every\nsingle morning and you say who do i want\nto be today i want to be kind i want to\nbe loving i want to be sweet i want to\nbe generous i want to be giving i want\nto stop judging people i want to think\nthe best of people that i possibly can\nand you set your gps your mental gps\nyour internal gps for who you want to be\nit changes how you show up in the world\nand you realize that other people's\nperceptions of you have literally\nnothing to do with you but you've been\nbasing your entire life based off of\nyour accomplishments and other people's\nperception and when you're so firm into\nwho you truly are other people's\nperceptions mean nothing to you outside\ncircumstances mean nothing to you they\ndon't change you in any sort of way so\nwhat you need to do is you need to get a\npen and paper out and say who do i want\nto be\nyou decide who you want to be and then\nevery single morning you mentally set\nyour gps to become that person and see\nwhat happens in your life and how your\nlife starts to change the exact same way\nthat when that little boy got a piece of\npaper that said four numbers on it it\ncompletely changed the trajectory of his\nentire life imagine if you didn't get\nthat imagine if you got the real results\nwhere you could be the exact same thing\nis true for you what you see on that\npiece of paper of who you want to be how\nyou set your gps is going to change\nwhere your life goes from this moment\nforward something that holds so many\npeople back\nsome people that are that are just\ncompletely terrified of this thing in\nthis thing\nthey're so terrified of it that it holds\nthem back from creating a life that they\nabsolutely love and also absolutely\ndesire and deserve more than anything\nelse and that is the fear of rejection\none of the things i hear the most\nwhenever i'm giving speeches or i'm on\nyou know zoom calls and i'm asking\npeople their biggest fear one of the\nbiggest fears that i hear almost every\nsingle time when the top two or three\nfears is the fear of rejection so if you\ncan overcome the fear of rejection in\nyour head you can go and create what is\nit you want to because in my opinion the\ngraveyard is full of hopes dreams\ndesires\nall of that from people who never fully\nstepped into who they wanted to be and\nwhat they wanted to do and the lives\nthey wanted to impact simply because\nthey were afraid of being rejected so if\nwe can figure out a way for you to get\npast that fear of rejection then you can\ncreate the life that you actually want\nto and it's sad to think that millions\nif not billions of people have died\nwithout doing what it is they truly want\nto do because they're just afraid of\nbeing rejected by other people\nisn't that crazy to think about if you\njust take a second and think that the\ngraveyard's just full of hopes and\ndreams and desires and things that were\nnever created because people are just\nafraid\nof other people's opinions and\nrejections of them\nso let's talk about that\nto get to the end of your life to be on\nyour deathbed and go man i wish i would\nhave brought more out of myself man i\nwish i would have done this i wish i\nwould have impacted more lives i wish i\nwould have written that book i wish i\nwould have played more music in front of\npeople and brought my music out to\npeople for them to see i wish i would\nhave painted more i wish i would have\nput my paintings on walls for people to\nsee\nand brought my creativity to the world\nthat's got to be the worst feeling in\nthe world to get to the end of your life\nand know that you didn't even scratch\nthe surface of your potential\nand a lot of that comes from the fear of\nrejection and so we're going to talk\nabout that now why does the fear of\nrejection exist now i'm going to tell\nyou that the fear of rejection is\nliterally built into us and it makes a\nlot of sense but it doesn't need to hold\nus back anymore why do we have the fear\nof rejection it's built into us it's\nbuilt into our genes we are tribal\nbeings which means if you go back uh you\nknow 500 000 years ago\nand you were to see all of your\nancestors all of our ancestors together\nthey had to stick together in tribes for\nsafety\nfor food for water for shelter for\neverything we had to if we were alive\n500 000 years ago we had to stay in the\ntribe\nif we happen to be kicked out of the\ntribe or rejected from the tribe\nthat's basically certain death you're\ngoing to die if you're not part of the\ntribe so of course we want to make sure\nthat we fit in\nof course we want to make sure that we\ndon't get kicked out of the\nquote-unquote tribe\nbut nowadays\nfitting in is one of the worst things\nthat you could do\nthere's a quote that jim carrey has that\nsays uh\nyour your need to fit in will make you\ninvisible in this world\nif you think about everybody that you\nlook up to\nevery big actor or inventor or business\nperson or ceo or creator or scientist\nthey're always somebody who had to\nget out of the system out of the box\nthink differently act differently in\norder to create what they created so if\nthey're your biggest if you're if\nthey're the people that you look up to\nwhy would you want to not be like them\nwhy would you want to stay inside of a\nbox because you're afraid of the\nrejection\nnow you have to realize if you go and\nyou think about it\nif we're talking about humans being\ntribal beings i'll give you an idea of\nhow ingrained in us it actually is there\nwas a terrible study let's start by\nsaying this it was it was a terrible\nidea first off in 1944\nthere was a study where they took 40\nnewborns and they were just curious if\nhumans would be able to thrive\nwithout\nhuman contact without other human\ncontact right so they they were just\ncurious you know would humans be able to\nthrive or is it so necessary we're such\ntribal beings even contact with another\nhuman skin to skin is that something\nthat we need and so what they did in\nthis study they took 40 newborns and the\nonly times that they were only touched\nwas when they were changed had the\ndiapers changed when they fed them and\nwhen they bathed them and they had to\ncancel the study four months into it\nbecause half of the babies died in four\nmonths\nit's a terrible study absolutely\nterrible but it shows you how ingrained\nin us that we actually have to be in\ncontact whether that's physical contact\nor close contact with other humans\nit shows you it's ingrained in us it's\npart of who we are so it makes sense\nthat we don't want to be rejected right\nit makes sense also they found that\nthere's a studies that were done and\nresearchers have found that being lonely\nis the equivalent and as lethal as\nhaving 15 cigarettes per day being\nlonely is the equivalent of having as\nlethal as 15 cigarettes per day lonely\npeople are 50\nmore likely to die early and prematurely\nthan those who have healthy\nrelationships\nso when you think of it yes\nof course it makes sense that we're\nafraid of being rejected because being\naround other people\nfrom the moment that we're born\nis something that is super important it\nis something that is ingrained into our\nbodies and to have physical contact with\nother people is something that is\nnecessary in order for a child to to\nlive\nso\nif you think about it all of this makes\nsense\nbut we're not going to die\nnow from somebody rejecting us the same\nway that we would die\n500 000 years ago if we were rejected\nfrom the tribe\nso does it make sense that we don't want\nto be rejected absolutely it makes sense\nbut it doesn't have to be the thing that\nholds you back from bringing out your\npotential from bringing your art to the\nworld from being creative from stepping\nout from creating the company that you\nwant to\ncan we override the system inside of our\nhead to create what it is that we want\nto the answer is yes hell yes we\nabsolutely can and that's what we're\ngoing to talk about i'm going to teach\nyou the first thing we have to do is we\nhave to build the awareness of when we\nare being held back by the fear of\nrejection because a lot of times people\njust feel physical feelings of fear but\nthey don't ask themselves what am i\nfeeling why am i feeling this and they\nnever actually take themselves out of\nthe jar to read the label what does that\nmean you take yourself out of the out of\nyour head and say what is actually\nhappening here they just feel physical\nfeelings of fear\nthey shut down\nversus going okay i feel fear what is\nthis fear that i'm feeling why is it\nthis way you know\nand then you you go through it and you\ngo you know i don't want to do this\nthing right\nbecause i'm afraid of being rejected\nlike i don't want to make this cold call\nif you're a salesperson you know this\nfeeling i don't want to make this cold\ncall because i'm afraid of being\nrejected i don't want to ask this person\nout because i'm afraid of being rejected\ni don't want to start this company\nbecause i'm afraid of other people's\nopinions and them rejecting me and\nmaking fun of me i don't want to\nmake this youtube account i don't want\nto start i don't want to put my videos\nup because i'm afraid of what could\npossibly happen i'm afraid of being\nrejected but then when you look at it so\nyou say number you look at you go okay\nso what's the worst that could actually\nhappen\nright because our brain immediately if\nyou don't pay attention to it will\nimmediately go to fear fear fear and\nfears attached to death which means you\nknow if you make a youtube video you're\nnot gonna die for making a youtube video\nunless you're one of those stupid people\nthat jumps off of buildings and you know\ndoes all the parkour on tops of\nbuildings you could die if you're making\nyoutube videos off that one but if\nyou're making a youtube video about like\nyou know how to get better at yoga or\nmindset or\ncoaching or fitness or whatever it is\nyou're not gonna die from creating those\nvideos right so\nyou ask yourself what's the worst that\ncould happen and you start to actually\nassess what the worst thing could happen\nis okay if i'm making a cold call\nand i'm afraid of being rejected i'm\nafraid of this and i'm gonna go okay\nwhat's the worst that could happen in\nthis situation maybe the person like\nabsolute worst thing could happen in a\ncold call they scream at me they yell\nthey call me a pos and then they\nhang up the phone on me that's the worst\nthat can happen am i gonna die\nno\nwhat are the chances of that happening\nreally really small one of a thousand\nmaybe\nokay\nwell\nit seems like there's more upside\nthan downside so i might as well go\nahead and try it\nbecause what'd you do you took yourself\nout of the jar to read the label perfect\nokay let's go ahead and make this cool\ncall maybe you're afraid of asking\nsomebody out like we said right what's\nthe what's the worst that could happen\nif you ask somebody out\nthey say no\nokay are you gonna die\nnope not gonna die\nbut\nthey could say yes\nand wouldn't that be pretty awesome if\nthey did say yes so it seems like once\nagain the upside is better than the\ndownside so should i do it hell yeah\ngo for it ask that person out\nokay what if i start this company what's\nthe worst that could happen\nit could fail and then i have to go get\na job\nokay\nwhat's the opposite of that it could be\nmassively successful i could create the\nlife that i want to for myself my family\nto be able to travel the world and have\nthe abundance that i want to\nonce again seems like the upside is\nbetter than the downside okay\nyoutube video\nwhat's the worst that could happen well\nyou could get some hater they exist\nwhat's the best that could happen people\ncould start watching it could go viral\nyou could impact millions of lives you\ncould start a business from youtube you\ncan make money doing it\nseems like once again the upside is\nalways better than the downside so\nshould i do it yes will you die from\nmaking a cold call asking somebody out\nstarting a business or putting up a\nyoutube video absolutely not and that's\nwhat you need to bring to the forefront\nof your mind and tell yourself i'm not\ngoing to die there is much more upside\nthan there is downside so if i'm smart\ni'm a betting person i'm going to go\nokay there's if there's if i'm looking\nat a stock and i say this stock has\nway more upside than downside\nwell then i should probably invest in it\nright and that's usually how most things\nare we end up making\nmountains out of out of ant hills more\nthan anything else it's just like we\nmake things to be so much worse\nrejection is 100\nsafe you're not going to die from being\nrejected unless somebody rejects you you\nknow unless you ask somebody out on the\nedge of a mountain and then they say no\nand then they decide to push you off the\nedge of the mountain that's the only way\nthat it's not really safe rejection is\nsafe you won't die from someone hanging\nup on you and and yelling at you on a\ncold call you won't die from someone not\ngoing on a date with you you won't die\nfrom starting a company and you won't\ndie from creating a youtube video and\nsome haters saying that your stuff sucks\nyou won't it won't happen and so if you\ncan look at it from that standpoint and\ngo there's so much more upside than\ndownside i might as well do it and the\nreason why i have to do this is because\nyour brain is really sneaky if you\nhaven't noticed your subconscious is\nsuper sneaky it's very sneaky in keeping\nyou in your comfort zone\nright like it's it's good at keeping you\nin your comfort zone your brain\nautomatically goes to rejection is bad\nbad i could starve if i starve i die\nright like that's kind of the whole the\nwhole flow of what your brain actually\ngoes through but in reality none of that\nstuff's gonna actually happen\nright you get rejected not a big deal\nyou'll live\nyou will live let me say that one more\ntime you will live you will not die and\nif you have gone through this process\nand you've realized okay i will not die\nthen what should i do\ntake action\nnow will you still have feelings of fear\nwhile you're taking action\nyes will you still have feelings of fear\nbefore you take action yes but the good\nthing is you can kind of turn the dial\ndown on the fear because you know that\nyou're not going to die because\nultimately when we feel fear the thing\nabout fear that's really interesting is\nthat when you feel fear like the fear of\nrejection of somebody saying no to you\nit's a physical feeling you can feel it\ninside of your body it's the same\nphysical feeling that you have when you\nknow\nthat there's something that could\npossibly be approaching you you know\nit's i'll give you a perfect example\nhere's what it is it's the same physical\nfeeling as if you've ever been in the\nmiddle of the ocean and you think to\nyourself oh there could be a shark\naround here right that same physical\nfeeling is the same physical feeling\nthat you fear of like i don't i don't\nknow if i want to put this youtube video\nup like i put so much time into creating\nit but i don't want people to say that\nit sucks i don't want to find haters\nright it's the same feeling inside of\nyour body and if you're not paying\nattention if you're not intellectually\ndiving into your own head and creating\nawareness around it it's going to hold\nyou back but the beautiful thing is if\nyou're listening to this podcast episode\nyou want to change yourself and one of\nthe if not the very first step to\nchanging yourself is self-awareness so\nwhen you feel these feelings of fear\nthat's when you once again take yourself\nout of the jar you read the label and\nyou're like is this going to kill me\nabsolutely not i will live if the worst\nthing happens right now i will live\nthrough it if i fail in a business if\nthis person rejects me if my youtube\nvideo ends up sucking and people make\nfun of it i\nwill live because our brain tends to\nmake it so much worse than it actually\nis so that we stay inside of our comfort\nzone because our brain only cares about\nour survival that's what it's designed\nto do it is a survival mechanism that's\na beautiful thing but if you don't pay\nattention to it it will ruin your life\nand ruin your potential and everything\nthat you could do in this world and so\nyou've got to become very self-aware and\nyou've got to start to think about those\nand then\nwhen you take action\nand you realize you don't get the\nterrible result that you're originally\nfearing\nwhat does it do it builds confidence so\nif i'm going up and you know let's say i\ngo up and there's someone i go i want to\ngo ask them out let's use that as an\nexample i'm terrified\nsame physical feelings that i feel if\ni'm swimming in the middle of the ocean\ni start thinking oh my god there could\nbe a shark around here it's a physical\ndeath feeling it is because that's the\nonly feeling that your body can pull up\nfor fear right pulls it up\ni'm like all right am i going to die if\nshe says no i'm not all right let me go\nahead and i'm just going to do it\nanyways i'm going to approach her what's\nthe worst that could happen she could\nsay no i woke up to her maybe she's\nreally nice maybe she's super sweet\nmaybe she doesn't say yes but she says\nshe has a boyfriend\nokay well\nthat at least gives me a little bit of\nconfidence because number one i stepped\nout of my comfort zone number two she\nwasn't you know to me\nnumber three she was really nice\nnumber four\nthere's other fish in the sea okay what\ndoes that do that builds a little bit of\nconfidence let's go to the youtube video\nlet's say that i post up a youtube video\nwhat's really interesting about haters\nis you'll get haters every once in a\nwhile i mean i have\nlike 1.5 to 2 billion views online i\ndon't know how many it is with somewhere\nin that number right\nfor every hater you have a like 150\npeople who are super nice super\nsupportive and super sweet but for some\nreason you always focus on the haters\nlike that's just the way that it goes\nright\nbut if i put up a video and i have a\nhater\ni can look at that hater and i could go\nokay that's that's one person who hated\nmy stuff\nand they're just projecting the hate\nthat they feel for themselves on top of\nme and if i can be aware of that then i\ncan go\nwell look there's one hater and 150\npeople who loved my stuff and if 150\npeople even if there's just five people\nthat loved your stuff with one hater you\nstill impacted five people's five times\nmore people's lives than the people who\nwere the haters and so what happens is\nwhen you put yourself out there and you\nfeel the fear but do it anyways and you\nput yourself out there and do what you\nwant to do and what needs to be done\nand you get a little bit of a result\nthat you want to it starts to build your\nconfidence to do it again but you can't\nbuild your confidence unless you step\noff of the ledge then just do it anyways\nand so what you have to realize people\nare always like oh i wish i was more\nconfident i wish i was confident like\nyou i wish i was better public speaker\nconfidence isn't something that people\nare born with i say it all the time\nconfidence is something that you get\nfrom results and the only way that you\nget results is by taking action so the\nonly way to take action is if you're\nfeeling fear to do it anyways and that's\nthe way that you have to do it so you're\nnot going to die from rejection which is\na beautiful thing\nbut\nwhen you feel the feelings of fear you\nfeel the feelings of fear of rejection\nyou have to take yourself out of that\nfeeling and go okay i'm not going to die\nthere's a lot more upside than there is\ndownside and you know\nthis is something i truly want to do\nand if you do that\nand you put it out there whatever it is\nthat you want to put out there\nyou put that thing out there and get a\nlittle bit of a good result\nyou start feeling better about yourself\nyou get a little bit of confidence and\nconfidence or like confidence is like\nlike stacking blocks\non top of each other and your confidence\ngrows and it grows and it grows and it\ngrows but your confidence cannot grow\nunless you put yourself out there so you\nwill feel the feeling\njesus\nyou will\nfeel the feelings\nof\nrejection and fear inside of your body\nyou will fear other people's opinions\nbut don't let that hold you back from\ndoing what it is that you truly want to\ndo because the worst thing that could\nhappen is that you join all the people\nin the graveyard with hopes dreams and\ndesires that didn't come out of you and\npotential that wasn't seen in your\nlifetime\nthe issue with fear is that fears are\nholding you back from creating the life\nthat you want at its simplest form\nthat's really what it is so fears are\none of the worst things in the entire\nworld because they're holding you back\nfrom the life that you truly truly want\nand so learning how to work with your\nfears is probably one of the biggest\nskills that you can learn and it is an\nactual skill and you'll realize why that\nis as i start to dive in in most people\nthey never learn how to get past their\nfears they never do get past their fears\nand then i would assume a lot of people\nget to their lives and like damn i wish\ni could have done more i wish i could\nhave impacted more people's lives i wish\ni could have done more in the world i\nwish i would have created the art that i\nwanted to but i was too afraid to i wish\nthat i would have spoken up more about\nwhat i truly believed in but i was too\nafraid to\nso in this episode we're going to talk\nabout how to get past your fear so that\nit doesn't hold you back anymore so that\nyou can ultimately go out stop being\nafraid and create the life that you\ntruly want to because most people i\ndon't want to say most i guess most\npeople probably will do almost anything\nto avoid their fears almost anything\nto the point where they'll live a life\nthat they don't truly want\nevery waking moment of their life they\nhave the opportunity to go out and do\nsomething great whatever greatness looks\nlike to you and so most people will try\nto avoid fear and people have this this\npreconceived notion that successful\npeople have no fear or they're fearless\nwe always say oh this is the fearless\nleader no and i've said this before many\ntimes in the podcast\nthis is the truth is it successful\npeople fear as much as people who are\nquote unquote unsuccessful but the\ndifference is successful people don't\nlisten to their fear and they go and do\nit anyways that's the truth of the\nmatter in the the fact of the matter is\nthat most fears today\nare not life-threatening\nnow when you understand what fears are\nused for and why they actually make\nsense you kind of respect them a little\nbit more but there's only two fears that\na human is born with that's it number\none is the fear of falling\nnumber two is the fear of loud noises\nthe fear of falling in the fear of loud\nnoises everything else this is very\nimportant listen to this everything else\nis absolutely learned\nfrom our upbringing whether that's our\nparents whether that's society brothers\nsisters people that we know every other\nfear besides the fear of falling and the\nfear of loud noises are learned by a\nhuman\nand fears aren't real because ultimately\nas you may have heard it's like an\nacronym false expectations appearing\nreal how often and i would guess you\nknow probably pretty often have you\nfeared something that never even\nactually happened have you worried so\nmuch about something that could possibly\nhappen in the future and it never\nhappened how often does that happen\nwell in case you're curious there was a\nstudy that was done on this and found\nout that 85\nof what humans fear and worry about\nnever even actually happens\nso 85 of the stuff that's holding you\nback from the dreams that you truly want\nwill never happen\nthat's crazy if you actually start to\nthink about it\nand why i say that they're not\nlife-threatening is this is because\nthe the ultimate thing that you have to\nrealize about the brain\nis that\nfear is put into us for our survival and\ni'll talk about that a little bit more\nin just a few minutes but fear is the\nsignal that we're about to get out of\nour comfort zone we're about to leave\nsafety we're about to get out of our\ncomfort zone and that potential death\ncould be coming now you know that if you\ngo and ask your boss for a raise and you\nfeel that feelings of fear he's not\ngoing to kill you right i hope not girls\nyou probably need to get a new boss but\nultimately you know that's not going to\nhappen but the feelings that you feel of\nfear are the same types of feelings as\nif you're walking in the middle of the\nnight and you hear sounds in a bush it's\nthe same physical feelings of fear\ninside of your body\nso fear is telling you that you're\ngetting out of your comfort zone here's\nthe really important thing to realize\nthough getting out of your comfort zone\nyou know if you're listening to this or\nif you're watching this you know that\nfeeling like getting out of your comfort\nzone and getting out of your comfort\nzone is ultimately a good thing you need\nto get out of your comfort zone you know\nthat\nso if you feel fear\nand fear\nis the\nthe thing that's telling you you're\nabout to get out of your comfort zone\nthat means that that feeling is not bad\nthat feeling is actually good so if you\ncan switch your brain around to realize\nthis feeling is good that i'm feeling i\nshould lean into this\nyour life will be completely different\nbecause ultimately you have two choices\nwhen you feel fear number one you can\ngive in\nand you could just give in to the fear\nor number two you can lean into the fear\nand go you know what okay\nnow if i think about it my brain is\ntelling me right now it's sending the\nsignals of i'm about to get out of my\ncomfort zone i know that this thing that\ni'm about to do is not going to kill me\nthat's a fact\nand so if i think about it i should\nactually know that these feelings are\ngood because it's telling me that growth\nis on the other side it's telling me\nthat i'm about to get out of my comfort\nzone because ultimately i know getting\nout of my comfort zone is a really good\nthing and where your fear comes from is\na little tiny part of your brain in the\nback of your back your brain is called\nthe amygdala and they call it the\nreptilian part of your brain and it\ngenerates fear in order for you to get\naway from danger which\nis incredible so it's an incredible tool\nbecause it kept our species alive for\ntwo million years\nbut\nyou have to realize there's no potential\ndeath for most of the people that are\nlistening this you don't have potential\ndeath when you're walking outside every\nsingle day right so when the amygdala\nwas\nfirst around and we were you know a\nmillion two million years ago all of\nthat\nyou have to realize if we heard a\nwrestling in the bush the amygdala would\nclick on and say hey there's something\nto fear there okay do something\ndifferent we need to get out of this\nplace we need to run fight or flight\nwhatever it is that we need to do\nnow you're not going to leave your house\nand be attacked by a lion\nso\nyou still have those physical feelings\nthough that part of your brain still\nexists which means\nit's going to be used at some point it's\ngoing to click on so even though our\nexternal world has changed\nvastly even just in the last 100 years\nwe're still working with the exact same\nhardware that we've had for hundreds of\nthousands if not millions of years and\nso we're working with the same hardware\nthat kept our species alive that kept us\naway from lions and kept us you know\nfrom everything that we needed to fear\nbecause it meant potential death but now\nif you're going to go ask your boss for\na raise you're not going to die and you\nknow that but that part of your brain\nstill exists so it generates fear to get\nyou away from danger potential danger\naka getting outside of your comfort zone\nnow in modern day the difference is it\ndoesn't know the difference between a\ngood fear and a bad fear and yes i said\nthat correctly a good fear\nbecause most people listeners probably\nthink that all fears are bad no there's\nbad fears which is potential death on\nthe other side of that fear someone\ncomments comes at you with a knife\nthere's going to be a fear mechanism\nthat's clicked on to get you to go to\nyour fight or flight to either run or to\nattack that person to make sure you\ndon't get stabbed right fend for\nyourself whatever it is you need to do\nthat's a bad fear a good fear is like i\nsaid\nfeeling it\nand not giving in but leaning in going\nokay i know what my body's doing i know\nwhy it's doing this but i'm not going to\ndie so i need to lean in because it's\nactually telling me rob you should lean\ninto this because this is outside of\nyour comfort zone and i know outside of\nmy comfort zone is where i grow in\neverything that i want is outside of it\nso it's it's incredible if you actually\nstart to realize that this is how you\ncan use it when you understand it you\ncan use it and when you can use it you\ncan change your life and so it doesn't\nknow the difference between good or bad\nfears or good or bad risks it just wants\nto avoid all of them\nthat's it\nbut you\ncan consciously think is this something\ni should be incredibly afraid of or is\nthis something just telling me that i'm\nabout to step out of my comfort zone and\ni need to lean in so you know the\namygdala amazing for for fear and it's\namazing for avoiding danger but it's\nterrible if you want to grow a business\nor if you want to ask somebody out or if\nyou want to ask for a raise if you want\nto create content on the internet and\nput it out there and be judged by\neverybody or make a shift in the world\nor stand on stage and speak publicly to\nimpact people it's not good for that but\nit's really really good for avoiding\ndeath and danger\nso\nit's like will smith said will smith\nsaid fear is not real the only place\nthat fear can exist is in our thoughts\nof the future it's a product of our\nimagination causing us to fear things\nthat are not present and may never exist\nthat fear that is near insanity do not\nmisunderstand me danger is very real but\nfear is a choice\nfear is a choice you can't remove the\namygdala it's in your head so you got to\nfigure out a way to work with it\nyou got to figure out that's just the\nway it goes and that's why i love\nteaching you about the brain that's why\ni'm writing a book about the brain\nthat's why i have a course coming out\nabout the brain is because i just love\nthe brain because if you can understand\nthe hardware that we're given then you\ncan understand why it's there and how it\nworks you can then use your brain to\nyour advantage to then create the life\nthat you want to\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nso we need to feel the fear that's a\ngood thing\nbut we can't let it stop us we've got to\nlet us we've got to lean in and continue\nmoving forward and so you really have to\nto start thinking about and breaking\ndown your fears and thinking about them\ni remember that\nlong time ago i used to run a company\nand i have you know hundreds of sales\nreps under me i had a few thousand that\ni trained uh and this was when i was\nyounger so it was about 15 years ago and\nthey used to be really afraid my sales\nwere really afraid of making cold calls\nand so what they it would happen all the\ntime and so i'd have to make their fears\nsilly and so i would sit down with them\nand i would say okay so tell me what's\ngoing on oh i'm just afraid to make\nphone calls okay what are you afraid of\ni'm just afraid it's it's it's just the\nthe fear is coming up every time i pick\nup the phone okay so are you afraid of\nthe phone\nuh yeah i guess i am kind of afraid of\nthe phone and so i would go okay hey do\nme a favor go ahead and pick up your\nphone real quick and they'd go and they\npick up their phone i said they say here\nit is and i say okay\ni want you to look at your phone look at\nyour phone i say okay i want you to look\nat that phone and say i am afraid of you\nand they go wait what i s you know i\nwant you to look at your phone and i\nwant you to say i am afraid of you\nand they're like why i'm like just do it\nand they're like i\nam afraid of you i'm like do it again i\nam afraid of you i'm like do it again i\nam afraid of you okay do it in a deeper\nvoice i am afraid of you okay do it in a\nhigher voice i am afraid of you and what\ni'm trying eventually i started laughing\nand what i tried to make them do is try\nto take their fear\nthat really was a ridiculous fear of\njust pushing buttons that's all that it\nwas a fear of just pushing buttons and\ntalking to another human on their side\nphone taking that fear and making it\nridiculous and seem ridiculous because\nif you can make it seem ridiculous to\nthe brain the brain can release it and\ngo oh\nthere's no death on the other side of\nthis phone this customer's not going to\ncome through with a knife and and stab\nme\nso you got to kind of make it make it a\nlittle bit silly because it's either\nscary which you can allow it to be or\nyou can go this is ridiculous this fear\nmakes no sense this is silly and that's\nhow you start to get past it so\nthe good thing is luckily we're the ones\nthat make our fears up we're the ones\nthat are afraid of the phone calls we're\nafraid of you know going up and talking\nto that person because of what they\nmight say we're afraid of being on stage\nbecause ultimately we're afraid of\nmessing up and people making fun of us\nor whatever it is so we make our fears\nup so\nthe difference is we have to figure out\na way if we're thinking of those fears\nwe've got to think differently about the\nfears that pop up in when we feel the\nfear it's a good thing once again i'm\ngoing to say it a million times this\npodcast episode\nlean in\nlean in lean in you have to push past\nthe point of comfort because ultimately\nthat's where the change happens\nso how do you remove the fear\nfrom your body you can't but i'm going\nto go ahead right now and give you a few\ntips to help you work with the fear to\nmake it a whole lot better so the first\none\nis you got to change your mindset around\nfear you've got to change your mindset\naround fear\nhow do you change your mindset around\nfear well\nyou know the the phone example is a\nperfect example you make it silly so\nthat it's you're like oh that's\nridiculous why do i need to hold on to\nit or you have to show your brain\nwhy it's wrong or why it's ridiculous\nand the best way to do this is to take\npen to paper not to type it out on your\ncomputer not to type it on your phone\nbut take pen to paper and write it out\nand to ask yourself some questions so\nyou write them down\nand you ask yourself what am i afraid of\nyou write that question down and you\nanswer that question what am i afraid of\nand you write it down and then you look\nat it and you say it out loud here's the\ninteresting thing the reason why you\nwant to say it out loud because not only\nare you saying it but then also what's\nhappening is you're hearing it and so\nhave you ever thought something before\nand then you say it out loud you're like\noh my god that was ridiculous have you\never feared something and you say it out\nloud and you realize with saying it it\nalmost turns ridiculous right away and\nyou're like oh my gosh why am i fearing\nthat well that's what we're trying to do\nright here we're trying to actually make\nthis ridiculous so you can say it out\nloud to yourself you should say it out\nloud to yourself so you write it down\nwhat am i afraid of and then you say i\nam afraid of getting up in front of\npeople and speaking because i'm afraid\ni'm a mess up\nand then you just say it out loud to\nyourself okay\nthe next question you want to ask\nyourself is what good\ncan come\nfrom doing xyz whatever it is let's say\nit's the fear of public speaking what\ngood can come up\nfrom me going up on stage and speaking\nin front of people and then you answer\nit what good can come from it i'm trying\nto find more positives in the speaking\nthan the negatives i'm trying to make my\nbrain weigh out the options and go oh\ni'm not going to die by hopping on stage\nand i could possibly help this person\nthat person this person that person and\nthen your brain starts to go all right\nmaybe i should let go of this and let\nrob hop on stage\nso what good can come from this next\nquestion\nwhy should i not\nbe afraid of this why should i not be\nafraid of getting on stage and speaking\nin front of people well because i\nultimately do want to do some more\npublic speaking i know that you can\nreally impact people from stage it is\nsomething that i'm passionate about i\nlove watching public speakers and if i\nlove watching them i love to be one and\nyou could go on and on and on and on so\nyou know what good can come from this\nand why should i not be afraid of this\nanother reason why you shouldn't be\nafraid is because people aren't going to\nmake fun of you they're going to\nunderstand everybody's afraid of public\nspeaking so if you're afraid of people\nmaking fun of you they're not going to\nbe making fun of you they're going to\nunderstand if you do happen to mess up\nokay and then the next question\nis what action do i need to take right\nnow\nthis is the the last question what\naction do i need to take right now and\nthen you answer okay what i need to do\nis i need to plan out my talk even\nbetter and i need to practice and\npractice and practice because practice\nmakes perfect so if i practice more i'll\nbe more confident and i'll probably\ndeliver a better speech if i'm not\nfumbling around and i'm not you know\nlooking through the papers and trying to\nfigure out what i'm supposed to say i'll\npresent more confidently if i have all\nof this memorized right why do you want\nto take action here's the reason why is\nbecause we\nultimately have programmed into us when\nwe feel fear to basically lock up\nto not do whatever it is to give in to\nthat fear you know it's the same way\nwhere if you know you hear rustling in\nthe bush you're going to run or\nsometimes you're just going to lock up\nand you're going to stare and sit there\nfor a second you're going to look around\nand see if you can see any lions right\nso a lot of times what we've we've\ntrained ourselves to do\nover 20 30 40 years 50 years of your\nlife is that when you feel fear you give\nin when you feel fear you give in when\nyou feel fear you give in\nright now you've got to retrain yourself\nteach an old dog new tricks now you've\ngot to train yourself when you feel the\nfear you've got to take action\nyou feel the fear you take action feel\nfree to take action if you do this long\nenough\nand you're conscious enough doing this\nif you continue to keep doing it over\nand over and over again fears won't hold\nyou back anymore you've ultimately used\nclassical conditioning on accident to\nyourself and if you want to know what\nclassical conditioning is you can look\nit up but you've used classical\nconditioning on yourself\non accident for when you feel fear to be\nparalyzed by it\nthat's what you've trained yourself the\nsame way you train a dog you've trained\nyourself\nto not take action when you feel fear\nwhy do you think it's so damn hard to\nnot take action now because you feel the\nfear and you lock up you've trained\nyourself to do that same way that you\ntrain a dog sit you say sit and they sit\nbecause they get used to it it's just an\naction they get used to so now you've\ngot to retrain yourself to when you feel\nfear\nyou got to take action you got to go and\nthen what you say is for each one of\nthose you say them out loud because\nthere's power in writing it down there's\npower in saying it and then there's\npower in hearing it because you're\ntrying to program these things into your\nsubconscious you're trying to get your\nbrain to realize that your fear is\nridiculous and it needs to release it\nbecause your brain wants to conserve as\nmuch energy as possible if it doesn't\nneed to worry about whatever this thing\nis it'll let go of it okay\nwhat's the next thing that we need to do\nin order to get rid of our fears we need\nto make our goals or the things that\nwe're going for a little bit more bite\nsize so instead of saying hey i want to\nmake a hundred thousand dollars this\nyear if you've never made a hundred\nthousand dollars what you can do is you\ncan take that number and break it down\nand say i want to make 8 33 this month\nright\nthat number seems much more digestible\nthan the entire hundred thousand dollars\nand so you take your numbers then your\ngoals and chop them into bite-sized\npieces have little check marks along the\nway because the bigger that something\nfeels to you\nthe less likely you are to take action\nif you can chop it up into smaller sizes\nyou're more likely to take action which\nmeans you're more likely to do what you\nneed to do which means you're more\nlikely to hit your goal and then when\nyou do 8 33\nin a month you're like i can do this\nagain and it gets you excited then you\ndo it\nit's just important to make sure that\nyou chop them up so that they don't seem\nas large as they are and then the last\nthing is this learn to dance with your\nfear\nthat's what i always say dance with your\nfear you're going to feel it once again\nas i said in the beginning successful\npeople and unsuccessful people all feel\nfear the difference is what they do when\nthey feel it\nif you train yourself long enough you'll\nrealize that people that don't take\naction have trained themselves not to\ntake action\nthey've trained themselves you've\ntrained yourself not to take action when\nyou feel fear but if you can use these\nsteps if you can write them down if you\ncan become self-aware and next time you\nfeel the fear go what am i feeling okay\ni'm a little terrified right now okay\nwhy is that what am i afraid of right\nnow because ultimately when when you're\njust thinking things\nwhen things are in your brain it's very\nabstract when it's in your head it's\nsuper abstract when you write it down on\na piece of paper you can get very clear\non what things are going on and so you\ncan feel it what am i feeling right now\nokay i'm feeling fear\nokay what should i do okay i'm gonna go\nahead and write down what am i fearing\nyou start to write it down you look at\nit and you go\nthat's not as bad as i thought it was\ngonna be\nit's not that bad i think i can deal\nwith this i think i can work through\nthis\nand then ultimately what do you do then\nyou take time go through this whole\nprocess you say what action do i need to\ntake right now\nwhat action you need to take right now\nwhatever it is take that action because\nyou've trained yourself not to take\naction\ntrain yourself to take action because\nfear is a good thing\nyou'll never conquer fear you'll never\novercome fear\nbut what you will do is you'll learn how\nto dance with the fear\nyou'll feel it you'll understand it\nyou'll know why it's there and you can\neither give in or you can lean in what\nyou want to do is lean into that fear\nbecause it's showing you that you're\nabout to step out of your comfort zone\nand you know that everything that you\nwant is on the outside of that comfort\nzone the things that are holding you\nback from this amazing beautiful\nincredible life that you want are\ncomplete\nbs that's what we're going to be talking\nabout today and you might be listening\nto me and you're like that doesn't make\nany sense of course they're real no\nthey're not the only thing that's\nholding you back\nfrom the life that you want the money\nthat you want the family that you want\nthe happiness that you want the joy that\nyou want the peace the love the success\nthe traveling the abundance the\nlack of stress the environment that you\nwant every single little thing that you\nwant in your life the only thing that's\nholding you back from that is your fear\nof\nsomething that's it and we're going to\nbe diving into those today and what i\nwant you to think about i want you to\nask yourself\nis what is your biggest fear think about\nthat for a second i don't mean fear of\nlike spiders or fear of heights what is\nyour number one fear that's holding you\nback from creating the life that you\nwant i want you to think about that in\nyour mind real quick what is it\ndo you have it\ndo you know what it is\nnow i have to i want you to realize this\ni\nmy job is basically to talk about fear\nwith people and have them see how\nridiculous their fears are so i'm going\nto take a guess that i probably know\n95 percent of you that are listening to\nthis what your fear is here's the ones\nthat i hear the most often the fear of\nrejection the fear of failure the fear\nof success the fear of running out of\nmoney the fear of being a terrible\nparent the fear of your spouse leaving\nyou the fear of not living up to your\nparents expectations a fear of being\nunlovable whatever it is there's so many\ndifferent fears that are out there but i\njust probably covered about 95 percent\nof the people listening right now by\nsaying those\nout of all of those things\ni'm going to ask you this question\nhow many of those can kill you\nhave you ever thought about that before\nhow many of those fears will cause you\nto stop breathing will cause your heart\nto stop beating how many of them\ni know the answer to it the answer is\nzero\nit's zero i got about 95 percent of the\npeople who are listening to this in the\nactual fears that are holding you back\ncannot kill you because the fact is\nwe're actually born with only two fears\nthe fear of loud noises and the fear of\nfalling those two are actually born into\nhumans every other fear outside the fear\nof loud noises in the fear of rejection\nis learned\nyes you heard me correctly the fear\nthat's holding you back from the life\nthat you want from everything that you\ntruly want in your life\nis learned you either learn it from your\nparents you learn it from your brother\nand sister\naunt uncle family society\nadvertisements you're learning your\nfears from you've learned your fears\nlike how crazy just just let that sink\nin for a second you have learned to fear\nthat thing that is holding you back\nwhich means that it's actually not real\nnow i know some of you out there like\nbut rob it is real like the fear of that\nthat's inside of me i physically feel\nthat fear yes you can physically feel it\nbecause your thoughts create emotions\ninside of your body your thoughts happen\nthey send a chemical messenger called a\nneuropeptide from your brain down to\nyour body which then creates hormones\nand actual feelings inside of your body\nso you can feel\nthe feelings of fear\nbut they don't exist they're not real so\nyou've learned the fear of rejection\nyou've learned the fear of failure\nyou've learned the fear of success\nyou've learned the fear of running out\nof money you've learned the fear of your\nspouse leaving you you've learned the\nfear of being a bad parent you've\nlearned the fear of not living up to\nyour parents expectations you've learned\nthe fear of being unlovable\nyou have learned those fears none of\nthem are actually real they're not real\nthey don't exist you can't physically\nhold them in the world right and really\nwhat it boils down to is this it's a\nthing that one of my friends and i came\nup with and it's primal fears versus\nintellectual fears and let me explain\nthe situation if you listen to my\npodcast a couple weeks ago i actually\ntalked about this friend of mine who\nwent and actually lived with a native\nbrazilian tribe in the middle of\nabsolute nowhere in brazil like\nliterally lived inside of a teepee slept\nwith a machete next to him because\njaguars were known to roam in in the\nmiddle of the night and hunted anacondas\nfor them to be able to live i'm talking\nabout like native brazilian tribe like\nthey are native people they don't have\nroads they don't have cars any of those\nthings\nand one of the things that he said to me\nthat was super super interesting\nhe was talking about how when he walked\naround in the forest he always had to\nhave a machete with him because you\nnever know when a jaguar would run up on\nyou you just never knew and that was\nalways prominent in his mind like he's\nwalking through the forest he's got to\nhave some form of protection on him at\nall times to make sure that he doesn't\nget attacked by something because one\nthing that he said that was really\ninteresting is he said if you see a\njaguar you're pretty much done and the\nreason why is because it's not them just\nseeing you they've been seeing you for a\nlong time if you're just now seeing that\nthey've been watching you they've been\nstalking you if you can visually see a\njaguar\nthey've been looking at you for a while\nand what he said to me that was really\ninteresting is he goes it really makes\nyou understand the primal fears that we\ndon't feel anymore in society we don't\nhave to worry about you know an animal\ncoming out and attacking us most of us\nthat are listening to this podcast you\nknow i can see all the places this is\ndownloaded like 190\n190 different countries listen to this\npodcast\nin the majority of people who are\nlistening to this you don't have to\nworry about an animal coming out and\nattacking you i don't have to worry\nabout walking down the street here in\naustin texas in an animal coming out and\nattacking me\ni don't really have to worry about\nrunning out of food like even if i\nlost all of my money\nand i was homeless i would still be able\nto figure out a way to get food right so\nthat's also not really something that i\nhave to worry about those are primal\nfears primal fears\nmeans that there is death attached to it\nso if you can attach death to something\nit's a primal fear\nand of course that makes sense we should\nbe afraid of things that could possibly\nkill us because our brain\nis designed to keep us alive and so we\nshould have a mechanism that creates\nfear inside of our bodies inside of our\nbrains to make us avoid anything that\ncould have possible death attached to it\ncompletely makes sense\nmakes sense i get it\nthat's a primal fear something that has\ndeath attached to it\nall of the other fears that don't have\ndeath attached to it we call\nintellectual fears they're fears of the\nmind\nall of the fears that you have that are\nholding you back from this life that you\nwant are all fears of the mind\nthere's no death attached to them\nthere's no death attached to the fear of\nrejection\nif you get rejected by somebody whatever\nit is\nyou're not going to die\nit's not going to happen\nyou know if somebody gives you their\nopinion they don't think something great\nof you and that's a fear\nyou know if sally in accounting rejects\nyou or doesn't like what you do or you\nknow talks trash about you you're not\ngonna die from that\nif you fail at running this business\nthat you want to you know start if you\nwere to possibly fail at it would you\ndie\nno i mean would you have less money\nmaybe but would you actually\ncease to breathe\nno\nso that's an intellectual fear how about\nthe fear of success if you were to\nbecome successful would you die\nno if you were to lose everything\nyou know if you were to become\nsuccessful and lose everything would you\ndie\nno\nif you were to\nyou know\nraise your children not perfectly\nbecause one of the things i hear from\nparents the most is that i'm so terrible\ni'm so afraid that i'm going to raise my\nchildren in you know they're not going\nto be what i want them to be if you\naren't the best parent in the world\nbecause obviously you're trying to get\nbetter are you going to die\nno\nif you are you know would bring up\nanother fear if you are have the fear of\nbeing unlovable if you're unlovable are\nyou going to die no it's not going to be\nawesome if you're not in love with if\nyou're unlovable but it's you're not\ngoing to die from it if you don't live\nup to your parents expectations are you\ngoing to die no if your spouse leaves\nyou are you going to die no all of these\nthings i understand listen i don't want\nto say that i don't understand\nnot wanting them to happen i understand\ni wouldn't want to be rejected i\nwouldn't want to fail i wouldn't want to\nyou know run out of money or be a\nterrible parent or my spouse to leave me\nor be unlovable or you know not live up\nto my mom's expectations of course i\nunderstand\nthe fact of not wanting these things to\nhappen but you can't justify fearing\nthem because they're not something to\nfear because they will not kill you\nso what you really have to do is you\nreally have to take a step back when\nyou're starting to feel the feelings of\nfear and to start to self-assess one of\nthe things that i always say is that if\ni could give everybody in the world a\nsuperpower it would be extreme\nself-awareness for people to take\nthemselves out of their current\ncircumstances look at themselves as if\nthey're looking at somebody else and\nactually self-assess what's going on\nright there hey if you're enjoying this\nvideo do me a favor and hit that like\nbutton down below it helps with the\nyoutube algorithm so that more people\ncan see this message because it helps us\nget it out organically so hit that like\nbutton and i appreciate you\nyou sit there and you go okay\nall right i'm feeling fear i'm feeling\nfear right now\nam i going to die i'm not okay so is it\na primal fear no it's not a primal fear\nit's an intellectual fear how do i know\nonce again a primal fear is where death\nis possibly attached to it i could\nactually die\nlike\ncease to breathe i could completely stop\nbreathing an intellectual fear your ego\nor your embarrassment\nisn't attached to it so if you get\nrejected you're not going to die but\nyour ego might hurt you might get\nembarrassed\nif you fail at something you're not\ngoing to die but your ego might hurt you\nmight be embarrassed about it and so on\nand so forth and so what you do\nis you have to prove to your brain how\nridiculous this fear actually is so that\nit starts to release it because at this\npoint if you don't\nreally start to self-assess it feels in\nyour body the same as if you're about to\nbe attacked by a lion like you can\nphysically feel inside of your body fear\nyou can and it's the same physical\nfeeling that you're feeling if your life\nis you know possibly on the line but you\nhave to prove to your brain that the\nthing that you're feeling is really not\nsomething that should be feared at this\npoint not something that's going to hold\nyou back not something there's going to\nbe a death attached to it and so in a\nway you almost have to prove to your\nbrain how ridiculous your fear is so\nwhen you're feeling these feelings\nyou've got to self-assess think about\nthe fear and then you've got to prove to\nyourself how ridiculous holding on to\nthis fear actually is\nso how do you do it all right let's go\nahead and walk you through exactly how\nto do it and so\nthe first thing that i like to do is i\nlike to prove to my brain how ridiculous\nthe fear is and i don't even call it a\nfear\ni refuse to call an intellectual fear an\nactual fear right a primal fear yes i\ncan call that a fear but an intellectual\nfear i don't call a fear\ni made up a word that i like to call it\nbecause i like to make myself realize\nhow dumb it is and i'm trying to\ndiminish\nthe\nseverity of these fears quote unquote\nfears in my brain and i call them\nscaries\nscaries\nbecause it doesn't sound scary when you\ncall something as scary so it's like oh\nyou know i've got this scary inside of\nmy head that i might be rejected by\nsally in accounting because she doesn't\nlike the work that i do oh i've got this\nscary that i you know i've got this\nscary that possibly my my wife could\nleave me i've got this scary that i'm\ngonna fail at my business i've got this\nscary that i might fail at this other\nthing i've got this scary that i i might\nbecome successful and i've never been\nsuccessful i don't know what that feels\nlike i've got these scaries like that's\nthe way that i think of it in my head of\nlike it's so\nit's so ridiculous to hold on to these\nthings because you can do something to\nmake these things better you can make\nsure you don't feel you can make sure\nyou don't get rejected you can make sure\nthat your spouse doesn't leave you can\nmake sure that you are an incredible\nparent you can make sure of all of these\nthings so they're not fears because when\nyou say fear it's like\ni could die that's what fear means in my\nhead\nscaries are\njust a little bit scared like that's the\nway that i feel scaries are and that's\nwhat i try to make them feel in my brain\nof like these are not on the same level\nthis primal fear is not on the same\nlevel as these intellectual fears these\nintellectual fears are so much smaller\nthere's so much diminished and i'm not\ngoing to allow these things to hold me\nback from the life that i want because\nhow ridiculous would it be if i didn't\nlive the life that i want because i was\nworried about sally and accounting's\nopinion of me how ridiculous is that if\nyou actually think about it and so\nthat's what i'm trying to do i'm trying\nto actually diminish it in my brain so\nthat i can see how dumb it is to\nactually hold on to it because it's\nholding me back to the freaking life\nthat i want and i only get one of these\nlives so why would i let sally's opinion\nof me or the fear of rejection the fear\nof failure the fear of success whatever\nthe fear is hold me back from doing the\nthing that i truly want to do\nright and so what i'm going to do is i'm\ngoing to self-assess figure out what\nthis thing is and i'm going to freaking\nget past it because it's not going to\nhold me back anymore so then i ask\nmyself these questions number one\nis this a primal fear or is this an\nintellectual scary\nis this a primal fear that i'm feeling\nin my body or is this an intellectual\nscary\nthink about that for a second which one\nis it\nokay and this is the self-assessment i\nwant you to go on and you can do it\nright now and you can do it any time\nthat you start to feel fear\nand you write it down is this an\nintellectual fear or is this a primal\nscary\nright which one is it for you\nnumber two\nam i going to die\nam i going to die\nthis will really help you figure out\nwhich one it is am i going to die\nno i'm not\nokay cool i got that and then number\nthree\nand here's the key\nthe key is to shift your focus because\nyou're focusing on the wrong thing when\nyou're focusing on these scaries\ni want to be more afraid of what i'm\ngoing to lose\nthan to be afraid of this intellectual\nscary i want to be afraid of what i'm\nnot going to have in my life and what\nit's what i'm going to be missing out on\nif i listen to this intellectual scary\nthan if i allow it to actually control\nmy life\nso here's what i do\nokay if i if i look at this intellectual\nscary over here\nthe question i'm gonna ask myself is\nwhat am i missing out on\nif i listen to this intellectual scary\nwhat am i missing out on if i listen to\nthis thing i want to think about what am\ni missing out on i want to think about\nwhat are my children going to miss out\non i want to think about what is my\nfamily going to miss out on i want to\nthink about what is the world going to\nmiss out on i want to figure out why i\nshould be scaredless\nof not taking action then why i should\nbe afraid of this intellectual scary i\nwant to diminish the intellectual scary\nin my mind so much\nthat i have to take action because i'm\nmore afraid of not taking action than\ntaking action\nand so what are the three questions\nnumber one is this a primal fear or is\nthis an intellectual scary number two am\ni going to die and number three shift\nyour focus what you're focusing on to\nwhat am i missing out on\nif i listen to this intellectual scary\ni'm trying to diminish that fear to seem\nso miniscule\nversus thinking about when i think about\nwhat i'm missing out on if i listen to\nthat intellectual scary if i\nthink about what my family is missing\nout on what my kids are missing out on\nwhat travel i'm missing out\nmoney i might not be making the life i\nmight not have i'm going to start to\ndiminish the feeling inside of my body\nand i'm gonna go wow that i just went\nfrom from anxious\nfearful if i don't feel for of of taking\naction to i actually feel anxious if i\ndon't take action i'm actually afraid of\nwhat my life looks like if i don't start\ntaking action because it looks way worse\nif i don't take action than if i do\nand so that's the key is you've gotta\nyou've got to number one identify is it\na primal fear or is it an intellectual\nfear or intellectual scary and you've\ngot to identify\nwhat you need to do to get past it by\ndiminishing that fear that scary that\nyou have and making you realize you\nshould actually fear\nnot taking action\nversus fearing taking action because of\nthis intellectual scary we're going to\ntalk about why negative thoughts exist\nin the first place uh i've got a lot of\nopinions on this i've also got some i\nguess some\ni wouldn't say it empirical data but\ni've got a lot of data from working with\nthousands of people and i would say it's\na little bit of nature it's a little bit\nof nurture as to why our negative\nthoughts exist and i actually think that\nas we get older as we have more\nresponsibilities that people actually it\nis more natural to be negative so that's\nthe first thing i want you to realize if\nyou're negative as hell it might\nactually not be your fault it might just\nbe natural but it doesn't mean that you\ncan't change it it doesn't mean you have\nto stay that way\nthe reason why i think that it's natural\nis because your brain is always\nsearching for what is wrong so that it\ncan keep you safe because think about\nthis for a second\nif your brain is sitting out there and\nit's saying okay\nyou know what's wrong what's wrong\nwhat's wrong it's wrong it's wrong it's\ntrying to figure out what's wrong around\nyou so that it can keep you safe at all\npoints of time your brain is just a\nproblem-solving mechanism that's all it\ndoes it's constantly looking for what is\nwrong so that it can solve it so that it\ncan keep you alive because something\nthat's wrong\nautomatically needs to be solved and\ntherefore you're safe the thing about it\nthough is that you're safe right now\nlike as you're listening to me right now\nyou are safe there's nothing that is\nimmediate danger that's right in front\nof you right we we all know that when\nthere's no immediate danger that's right\nin front of you your brain is going to\nsearch for something still and i always\nsay a brain that is left up to its own\ndevices is going to find something wrong\nwe've all done this before you've been\nsitting around nothing's wrong you're\njust hanging out\nand immediately you start getting these\nbad thoughts these bad feelings and it\nbecomes a\ncyclone of you could call it right where\nit's just like things are you get you go\nfrom everything's amazing to oh my god\nthis is wrong this is wrong this is\naround this room your brain starts\nsearching for what's wrong because it\nthinks that it needs to keep you safe a\nbrain left to its own devices will find\nsomething that's wrong finding something\nthat's wrong and searching for something\nthat's wrong we would call\nnegative right it searches for what is\nnegative and so i you know when you look\nat a child\nchildren aren't really negative but as\nyou tend to get older you got more\nresponsibilities you got to pay for your\nbills you got to keep yourself alive\nyou're not when you're a child you're\nnot in charge of your safety there's\nsomebody that's really taking care of\nyour safety so you can kind of just be\nfree but as you get older safety is\nsomething that you become in charge of\nso you have to start focusing on okay\ni've got to start finding ways to be\nsafe to protect myself and as you do\nthat your brain starts looking for\nthings that are negative now that we\nknow\nwhy you're negative and know that you're\nnot weird if you're negative and know\nthat it's natural know that it can be\nchanged how do we change this knowing\nthat all of this the case we can let it\nrun rampant and we can let our brain go\ncrazy and just be negative and get\nanxiety and stress and worry and fear or\nwe can decide that we want to control it\ni always give people an example it's it\nkind of blows my mind when they think\nabout it but you know if i'm sitting\nhere for those of you guys that are\nwatching through video those guys on the\npodcast listening you're not gonna be\nable to see this but if i'm sitting here\nand my arm starts flying all over the\nplace and moving all kinds of crazy\nyou'd be looking at me going what the\nhell is wrong with rob's arm like he\nneeds to control it right simply because\ni should be controlling my arm why\nbecause it's part of my body like if my\narm was just we had just arms that were\njust going all weird and crazy that'd be\nkind of odd wouldn't it because we\ncontrol our body what's the difference\nbetween me not being able to control my\narm and me not being able to control my\nbrain the difference is we think that\nour brain isn't something that can be\ncontrolled let's talk about how to not\nlet your mind run rampant and how to\nactually change the negative thoughts\ninside of your head two ways to do it\ntwo ways and if you can master these two\nways it's going to help you out a lot\nnumber one is you've got to do it\nthrough your mind\nmy favorite\nis thinking as your mind as a garden\nthere's a book called as a man thinketh\nlike a hundred years old at this point\nand he gives this example as your mind\nas if your mind is a garden an easy way\nto think of is this let's say that your\nmind is a garden and you're the only\nperson that can tend to this garden\nthere's nobody else in the world that\ncan tend to this garden except for you\nyou know\nthat if you had strawberry seeds and you\nwent and you planted these strawberry\nseeds in all of their perfect places and\nyou watered them and you make sure they\ngot sun if you planted like strawberry\nseeds they start to grow you see the\nlittle green guys come out of the ground\nand eventually like oh my gosh it's\ngonna it's gonna happen you would never\nexpect that you're gonna get tomatoes\nfrom that right you never expect that\nyou know if you plant strawberry seeds\nyou're going to get strawberries you're\nnot gonna get tomatoes so\nhow could you possibly think that if\nyou're thinking negative thoughts\nnegative thoughts negative thoughts all\nday long that you're just gonna\neventually have a beautiful positive\nmind beautiful positive life that your\nfirst thought isn't going to be negative\nhow crazy would it be for me to have\nnegative thoughts all day long and then\nsomething happens to me and then i get\nmad\nand surprised that i have a negative\nfirst thought no it's like i planted\nthose negative thoughts i'm going to\ngive more negative thoughts i'm going to\nreap what i sew same way that i can\nnever expect to just think negative all\nday long and then just have beautiful\npositive thoughts that just come out of\nit right same way that i can't expect\nthat if i plant strawberries i'm going\nto get tomatoes so imagine that you're\nthe only one that take control of this\ngarden right\nthe other thing to think about is this\nif you're the only one that's in control\nof this garden eventually you know it's\ngoing to grow right anybody who's ever\nplanted anything if you have property\nwe have property here\nfreaking weeds they just grow right grow\nweeds are going to grow but you're the\nonly one that can tend to this garden so\nyou can let those weeds grow more\nnegative thoughts by themselves just\npopping up that's the equivalent of\nnegative thoughts coming up or you can\npluck them as soon as they start coming\nup you start pulling all of those weeds\nyou're the only one that control it so\nif the weeds pop up and it starts over\nflowing and you get too many weeds\nthat's your fault there's no one else\nthat can do it so when the weed pops up\nyou pull it throw it away pops up pull\nit throw it away same exact thing for\nthe negative thoughts that pop up your\nhead whenever a weed does grow you've\ngot to get rid of it weeds are going to\ngrow in any garden\nof course\nbut you can either pull them or you can\nleave them and you have to make sure if\nyou're the one that keeps control of\nyour garden you must keep it as clean as\nyou possibly can anytime a negative\nthought or a weed pops up you've got to\nget rid of it as soon as you possibly\ncan if you're somebody who judges people\nyou've heard me say this before\ni've had this problem for years where\nit's just like i don't even know where\nthat thought came from who the hell made\nthat thought i don't want to judge this\nperson in front of me so if i notice\nmyself judging i've immediately got to\nthat first thought\npops up as judgment\ni've got to look at that person i've got\nto in my head i've got to say three\npositive things about them why it's like\npulling a weed right if i get cut off in\na car i can't get pissed off and i've\ngotten pissed off many times i need to\nimmediately notice when those feelings\nstart to arise to switch my mindset\naround it and what do i usually do try\nto make it funny and i go ah that\nperson's probably gotta poop so i go\nfrom being pissed to he's got poop and\nit makes me laugh and i'm like ah\nwhatever i just what am i doing i'm\nchanging my state i'm changing my\nmindset around what happened versus like\nthis person cut me off that's so\ndangerous what are they doing as if i've\nnever cut somebody off in my entire life\nwhat a freaking you know what a uh a\nliar i am in my own head of like oh that\nperson put me in danger that's what i'm\nthinking as if i've never cut somebody\noff if we've never cut somebody off\nright we're always perfect in our own\nheads when there's someone else doing\nsomething wrong so if someone cuts me\noff instead of being pissed off i gotta\nswitch my mindset i've got to pull that\nweed uh maybe they got a poop right your\nmind is like a wild monkey just jumping\naround breaking\nand they're gonna jump around and break\nstuff until you decide that you're going\nto put in a cage so when you notice that\nyour mind is doing stuff that you don't\nwant it to do you are the person that\nhas to put in cage it can continue to\nkeep breaking glass and throwing stuff\nall over the place and taking its poop\nand throwing it at people that walk in\nor you can take that monkey you can put\ninside the cage and you can say i am the\none in control and that is when you\nstart to take your power back so that's\nthe first thing you've got to\ntake your mind and you've got to focus\non getting the negative thoughts out\nthrough your mind the other way of how\nto change your negative thoughts\nsecond thing is through your body so\nreally interesting study that harvard\ndid found that when people change their\ntheir physiology their thoughts and\ntheir feelings change as well simply\nchanging the way i want you to be aware\nof this right now how are you sitting\nare you sitting\nin in your state the way that you're\nsitting you're now aware of it aren't\nyou literally side to camera chris my\nvideographer just shifted her body\nbecause she became aware of the fact\nthat she was slouching a little bit now\nyou got to ask yourself we all slouch\nall of us do it's we're on computers\nwe're driving with all those things but\nif us if we're slouching as often as we\nare is that is slouching a a weak or a\npowerful position we all know it's a\nweak position right so we've got to\nbecome aware of our physical body our\nphysical body will actually change the\nchemicals in our body and the chemicals\nin our brain they found at harvard that\nif you put your hands in a it's called a\npower position you've heard of power\nposition most likely put your hands on\nyour your waist\nand you stand there and breathe deep for\ntwo minutes it will actually lower the\ncortisol which is a stress hormone\ninside of your body it will actually\nrelease dopamine which is the motivation\nchemical inside of your body right so it\nwill lower the bad chemicals it will\nraise the better chemicals so how do we\nstart to change our thoughts we start\nchanging how we feel we also change our\nbody let me give an example let's say\nthat i want you to think of somebody who\nis depressed right not somebody that you\nknow but i want you to see what somebody\nlooks like that's depressed think of him\nas a cartoon there's a depressed cartoon\nit's a human what does he look like wow\ni bet i bet we could all say the same\nthing shoulders are down the head is\nprobably down if you think of how\nthey're talking they're probably talking\nslow\nthey're probably talking low and they're\nthey're slumped over and that's just the\nway that they look and we all know the\nphysiology of depressed bodies right a\ndepressed or anxious person or sad\nperson we know the physiology of what\nthat person would look like now if i\nsaid describe somebody that's walking\ninto a room confident what do they look\nlike and see that person inside of your\nhead they're standing straight their\nchin is up their shoulders are back\nthey're probably talking louder they're\nprobably talking with confidence you can\nhear it the boom in their voice right we\nknow the difference between looking at\nsomebody who is sad and depressed and\nlooking at somebody who is confident and\nyou know excited we know the difference\nbetween the two of those so when you\nthink about your physical body and\nwanting to shift your thoughts\nyou can shift your thoughts your mind\nyes but you also need to shift your body\nto realize that your body is actually\ncontrolling the way that you think the\nway that you feel the chemicals that are\ngoing on inside of your body explain to\nme if i were to say hey take a pen and\npaper write down everything that you\nwould see\nin a happy person\nright what would it be they would be\nstanding up straight they'd probably\nhave their shoulders back there'd be a\nsmile on their face why is that\nimportant why is this important because\nyour physiology\nwill literally change the chemicals in\nyour brain so\nwhen you notice yourself i always notice\nmyself and i'm like dude my posture\nsucks why am i sitting like this right\nimmediately i'm like all right this\nposture is not a power posture\nlet me try to put myself into a powerful\nposition knowing that when i do this and\nstay there and breathe\ndeep i'm actually going to change the\nchemicals in my brain i'm going to\nchange the chemicals in my body which\nthen puts me into a place of power and\nwhen i'm in a place of power am i\nthinking negative no i'm thinking\npositive i'm thinking powerfully i'm\ngoing to dominate this task that i have\nto do i'm going to go up and i'm going\nto give this talk and give the best talk\nthat i possibly can if you notice you're\nabout to if you're really nervous about\nsomething you're about to go give a\nspeech in front of your company and\nmaybe you have to present something\nlook think of your physiology what's\nyour physiology like you've got to\nchange it change your state will change\neverything about you so you're like all\nright\nlet me get into a power posture let me\nget my chin up let me get my back\nstraight let me get my shoulders back\nlet me talk a little bit louder let me\nbreathe deeper\nleave my hands on my hips and let me\nbreathe for two minutes and you know\nwhat i'm gonna do i'm also gonna talk\npositively to myself i'm gonna look\nmyself in the mirror as i do this i'm\ngonna look myself dead in the eyes and\nbe like you're a badass you're amazing\nyou have so many great accomplishments\nyou're so great whatever it is you need\nto say you don't usually feel like after\na great workout do you no you're\nmotivated you're inspired you've got\nideas running through your head you\nusually feel like when you've been\nsitting on the couch all day long not\nmoving your body not making your\nphysiology not making something happen i\nwas listening to an interview because\ni'm interviewing george st pierre pretty\nsoon which you guys will be hearing\nwhich is awesome he is the ex-ufc\nfighter who is a\nactual champion in multiple divisions\nmultiple weight classes considered one\nof the best fighters that's ever lived\nand the interesting thing about is he\nsays he hates fighting he would get\nreally anxious and really fearful right\nbefore he's about to go into a fight\nbecause he doesn't know what's about to\nhappen he's about to go into a fight in\na cage this guy could knock him out they\ncould break his nose he could be covered\nin blood he doesn't know there's so much\nunknown going into a cage fight where\nsomeone's just there to try to knock you\nout that is the most unknown situation\npossibly for all of mankind right so\nthere's a lot of fear and anxiety he\nwould feel and so he said he had to\nliterally before he would go and walk in\nhe would have to look himself in the\nmirror he'd have to fix his physiology\nyou have to look himself dead in the\neyes and you have to start giving\nhimself affirmation start talking\npositive to myself you're faster than\nthis guy you're more powerful than this\nguy you've been training harder than\nthis guy you're going to win you're\ngoing to win you're going to win he had\nto literally start to talk to himself\nand as he said become a different person\nand he would be that person up until the\nbell the final bell was done and\nsomeone's hand was raised he would make\nhimself become a different person\nmentally through his mind and physically\nthrough his body so next time you start\nto feel negative thoughts you start to\nfeel down you start to feel unmotivated\nchange your mind change your thoughts\nand then number two change your body\nchange your physiology\nall too often i see people\nsit back and say my life is the way that\nit is\nbecause of\nsomething and that something always\ntends to be something outside of them\nand then they're like oh\nyou know it's my circumstances it's my\nparents it's the way i was raised it's\nmy family it's my past it's my\nchildren's fault it's the president's\nfault it's the government's fault and\nthey blame everything on something\nexternally and one of the biggest things\nthe biggest thing that i learned from my\nvery first mentor when i was 19 years\nold is that if i want to change my life\ni need to take everything that's\nhappening\nand just blame it on myself in a good\nway\nnot in a bad way not in a way to make me\nfeel bad but in a way of going you know\nwhat if everything is my fault it then\nempowers me to know that i am the one\nthat's fully in control of my life\nbecause what you think in your head you\nwill get in reality\nso if you're a negative person you have\nnegative thoughts all day long\nwhat you think in your head you will get\nin reality if you are negative all day\nlong i guarantee you you are going to\nfind more negative things in your life\nall day\nyou literally create your reality let me\ngive you an example of what i mean\nthere's a part of your brain called the\nreticular activating system if you've\nnever heard me talk about this this is\nsuper interesting the reticular\nactivating system is your brain's\nfiltering system and so at one point in\ntime there's approximately two trillion\nbits of information per second that your\nbrain could latch on to and have come\ninto its awareness but your brain\nfilters out everything except for 200\nbits of information per second this is\nwhy if you go and you buy a new car you\nnever see that car and then you buy it\nyou're like holy crap this car is\neverywhere\nright i had an experience not too long\nago someone that i knew from middle\nschool passed away and i went back onto\nhis facebook and i was looking through\nsome of his pictures and seeing what he\nwas doing and see what his life was and\ni didn't know anything about i haven't\ntalked to him like 17 18 years\nand i saw a picture of somebody that i\nhaven't seen in a while his name's ryan\ni was pretty good friends with ryan back\nin middle school and i hadn't thought\nabout him in like 17 18 years and then\nthe very next day i was at a coffee shop\nand i was working getting my stuff done\nand i look up and i see a guy with a dog\nwalking into the coffee shop i was\noutside the coffee shop and i was like\noh my god that's ryan i haven't seen him\nin so long and then i he turned around\nand i saw his face again i was like oh\nthat isn't ryan and i was so surprised\nbecause i realized that my reticular\nactivating system because i had seen a\npicture of ryan the day before saw him\nthat day in somebody that wasn't\nactually him even though i hadn't\nthought about him in 17 18 years so what\nhappens is the same way that i'm going\nto start seeing a car\nthat i haven't seen before the same way\nthat i'm going to see somebody that i\nhaven't seen in 17 18 years and someone\nthat's actually not them if i'm setting\nmy reticular activating system on what\nsucks in my life if i'm setting it on\nall of the things that are negative in\nmy life i'm gonna start to notice more\nnegative things which means like i said\nyou literally create your own reality if\ni'm waking up\nand immediately going to what sucks i'm\nnegative this day sucks i don't want to\nbe awake then i'm going to create\nmore negative things by just having\nnegativity in my awareness if that\nnegativity is circling in my awareness i\nwill find more of that what you\nfocus on you will get more of that's\nwhat happens with the articulating\nsystem so if i'm thinking about negative\nthoughts all day long how in the hell am\ni going to figure out a way to be\npositive\nhow am i going to be positive that's\ngoing to be really freaking hard isn't\nit\nbecause if i'm waking up and immediately\ngoing to negativity i'm going to find\nmore negativity and so before i give you\ntips real quick on how to actually\nchange that let me give you a couple of\nexamples of the way negativity or\npositivity or anything works in your\nbrain let me give you a couple of\nexamples\nthink about it this way\nlet's say that i have a big old bucket\nof water and to the right i have\na a flower bed into the left i have a\nflower bed on the right hand side is all\npositivity on the right hands on the\nleft hand side is all negativity i have\nan option of taking the water that's\ninside of the bucket and pouring it into\none of the two of them\nwhichever one i put my water into\nit will grow those flowers or those\nweeds\nbased off of how much water i put into\nit the water is the equivalent to your\nenergy and your focus if i'm putting my\nenergy and my focus into the negative\nstuff that's around me in my day that\nwill grow i will grow negativity weeds\nif that's what i'm putting my energy\ninto\nif i'm putting my energy into the flower\nbed and my water into the flower bed\nthat is what's going to grow you will\nnot have something grow unless you water\nit but the water is your energy what are\nyou putting your energy to are you\nwaking up and saying woe is me and oh my\nlife is this way because of my parents\nbecause of the government because of my\ncircumstances because of this because of\nthis because of this or are you going\nhey these are my circumstances but i'm\ngoing to take my energy i'm going to\ntake this water and i'm going to pour it\ninto positivity and find something that\ni'm grateful for find something that i'm\npositive for and something that i can\nappreciate because i know that what i\nappreciate appreciates\nso i'm gonna focus on finding the things\nthat actually i'm i'm happy with and\nthat are going well for me\nthe reason why this is important because\nyou have to realize that humans are\ninherently negative let me explain why\nthat is\nhumans are inherently negative because\nnegativity is bad\nour brain wants to search for things\nthat are bad and the reason why is\nbecause our brain wants to solve the bad\nbecause bad a hundred thousand two\nhundred thousand years ago meant death\nand so our brain wants to our brain the\nthing that it does more than anything\nelse is its job is to keep us alive our\nbrain cares about survival more anything\nelse so our brain is kind of like\na negativity searching mechanism it's\nalways looking for what is negative and\nwhat is bad around us because it wants\nto stay away from those things or pay\nattention those things so therefore we\ndon't fall into that trap in die now i\nknow that if you wake up and you start\nthinking about how you know you lost\nyour job you're not going to die\nthat you're gonna you're gonna you're\ngonna hate what's going on that's for\nsure but what happens is your brain will\nseek out what is negative the reason why\nit seeks out what is negative so that\ntherefore it can make sure that it\navoids that thing because negativity\nmeans bad bad means death your brain\nwants to avoid anything that's bad and\nnegative because therefore it means\ndeath so your brain\nwill find the negativity automatically\nthat's why if you want to be positive\nyou better make sure that with every\naction that you take you're trying to\nfind something that's positive because\nyou're automatically most likely going\nto go to the negative and so people like\nwhy am i why do i have these negative\nthoughts that pop in my head\nautomatically without me even thinking\nabout them\nbecause that's what your brain is\ndesigned to do so if you want to be more\npositive you have to realize hey i got\nto do everything that i possibly can to\nbe positive knowing that my brain is\ngoing to go towards a negative now when\nmy brain does go towards the negative\nwhat do i have to do i do everything\nthat i can to pull myself out of that\nnegativity knowing that that's just\nwhat's going to happen\nmake sense\nyour brain is naturally going to be\nnegative if you're like most people\nwhich means that you're going to have to\nwork harder to be positive but it\ndoesn't mean that positivity is\nimpossible\nit just means a positivity and being\npositive and finding things you're\ngrateful for takes work\nso you're gonna have to put the work in\nyou also have to realize that sometimes\nwhat you're doing is you're actually\nsearching for the negative things within\nyourself this is where it gets really\ndifficult because what do a lot of us do\nwe talk to ourselves in our head and we\nsay things that's not positive we say\nthings that's not motivating and we say\nthings that we would never say to\nsomebody that we love\nthink of all of the negative things that\nyou've said to yourself all of the you\nlook fat in these jeans you're ugly look\nat that pimple on your face you're\nstupid all the things that you might\nhave said to yourself and realize that\nyou probably would never say any of\nthose things to someone that you love\nright like if your friend called you\nand she had a really bad first date\nshe's like yeah you know i was really\ninto the guy\nand you know he said that that he he\nthought it would be we'd be better off\nas friends\nyou wouldn't go yeah well stacy it's\nbecause you're you know you probably\nneed to lose 15 pounds probably because\nyour haircut probably because you don't\nlook too good probably because you're\nnot too smart like you'd never say that\nto your friend you'd be there and you'd\nbe there to support her right\nso why would you do that to yourself\nbecause how many people go on to a date\nor have something happen and go oh you\nshouldn't have said that that was stupid\nyou shouldn't have spoke up at that\nmeeting you're always so stupid you say\nthe stupidest\nbe quiet don't start don't say anything\nanymore oh that's why no one's\ninterested in you because you're need to\nlose 15 pounds because your hair looks\nstupid because that zit on your face how\noften do we talk to ourselves that way\nhow often do we hold ourselves back from\nall of the amazing things that we could\ndo in this world because we're too busy\ntalking trash to ourselves you would\nnever talk to someone that you love the\nway that you talk to yourself\nso why would you talk to yourself that\nway\nbecause ultimately\nthe one person that you should love more\nthan anybody else in the world is\nyourself\nbecause the more that you love yourself\nthe better that you're you are the\nbetter that you leave the world the\nbetter that you interact with everyone\nelse that's around you\none video that i absolutely love that's\nthat has to do with this my friend jay\nshetty made a video and he went you know\nsat down with some women who were in\ntheir late 20s early 30s and he said hey\nwhat i want you to do with the pen and\npaper is write down all of the negative\nstuff that you know you say to yourself\nall of the crappy things that you say\nstuff write it all down so they have a\npen and paper and they're writing it all\ndown they're writing it they're writing\nit\nand he goes okay\nwhat i want you to do is this come with\nme and he takes them into another room\nand they didn't know this but in the\nother room are there little sisters like\n10 to 16 years old and he goes i want\nyou to go ahead and say everything\nthat's on that sheet of paper to your\nlittle sister\nand these women are like\nthere's no way i can't do that he goes\nwhy not he's like because that's\nwhy would i say that to a 10 to 16 year\nold girl like how bad is it to say\nsomething like that to them\nand then you realize\nthat you're still that 5 10\n16 year old person deep down inside and\nyou're saying that to your little self\nall day long\nyou would never talk to someone that you\nlove the way that you talk to yourself\nso why would you talk to yourself that\nway what benefit has ever come from\ntalking down to yourself\never\nwhat benefit has ever come from seeking\nout the negative in everything that's\nhappening so what you have to do is you\nhave to become very self-aware of when\nyou start to do this you have to become\naware number one that you might have a\nproblem we all have problems in\ndifferent ways but a lot of people have\nproblems with the negativity side so if\nwe're trying to destroy negative\nthoughts we need to first become very\nself-aware that we have a lot of\nnegative thoughts\nand we need to pay attention to every\nsingle thought because what happens is a\nlot of times thoughts will come up\nwe just act like they're just reaction\nthey'll just pop up there's pop up kind\nof like you know bubbling to the surface\nand we're not in control of them and\nthen when they come up then we react to\nthem so what do we need to do we need to\nbecome very self-aware of these thoughts\nif we want to change something we need\nto become aware of when this something\nthat we want to change comes up and\nhere's a tip that i'm going to give you\nto help you out with this try this for\none week i know the majority of people\nout here listening to me right now won't\ndo this but if you're serious about\nbecoming better at self-love about\nbecoming better at appreciating yourself\nand finding more positive things and\ngetting rid of the negative self-talk\nthis is a challenge i want to give you\ngo to\na store walgreens cvs whatever it is\nwherever you live in the world and get a\nlittle notebook like one of the ones\nthat's like you know the size of your\nhand basically the one that'll fit in\nyour pocket\nand i want you to for a week straight\ndon't do this on your phone do it on\nwith pen and paper\nevery single negative thought that pops\ninto your head i want you to write it\ndown with pen and paper don't type it i\nwant you to write it down\nevery single negative thing that you say\nand the reason why is because you're\ngoing to start to build awareness you\ncan't change anything that you're not\naware of and so i want you to take them\nfrom inside of your head to on a piece\nof paper\nand you're going to build this awareness\nand you're going to start to notice that\nwhen i do certain things i start to talk\nto myself this way when this happens to\nme i start to talk to myself this way\nand you'll notice\nand listen the thing i'm going to tell\nyou is this if you're going to be doing\nthis don't attach any emotion to this\nlook at it as if you're just\nwriting stuff down because the worst\nthing that can happen and i know that\nsome people do this if i don't preface\nit this way you're going to write\nsomething down and then what are you\ngoing to do you're going to start to\njudge yourself for it you're going to\nstart to shame yourself for you're going\nto start to guilt yourself for don't do\nthat you're just going to take\nwhatever's going on your head and you're\ngoing to put it down on a piece of paper\nand you're going to start to build\nawareness around all of the things that\nyou say to yourself that are negative\nevery single day because when it's in\nyour head\nwhen it's in your head it doesn't seem\nreal it does it's not tangible it's not\nsomething that you can hold on to in\nthis world but when you take it and you\nactually write it down going from your\nhead and putting it on a piece of paper\nand it's physical and you can hold it it\nbecomes real and then you look at it and\ngo wow yeah i don't i don't want to do\nthis anymore i don't want to talk to\nmyself anymore you start to realize\nnumber one the negative stuff that\nyou're saying number two what makes\nthese negative thoughts come up maybe\ncertain actions or certain feelings or\ncertain people that you're around\nthroughout the day make it come up and\nnumber three what you realize is that i\ncan change this\nand writing it down makes it real and\nyou're like you know what this is\nsomething that i'm going to take i'm\nlooking i said 17 negative things in\nmyself today these are all the things\nyou look fat in that you look stupid you\nknow you shouldn't speak up because you\nyou got a lisp whatever it is you say\nall of these negative things to yourself\nso the first tip i'm going to give you\nis write down every single negative\nthought for a week just the awareness\nwill start to have you change your mind\nin the way that you are then what\nhappens is you start to change that\nnegativity and turn into positivity so\nthat's the second tip\nwhenever i notice a negative thought pop\nin my head that's one negative thought\ni'm gonna write it down my job is to now\nsay three positive things\nto basically\ntake that one thing and trump it was\nsomething that's even bigger so it's\nlike if i have one negative thought i'm\ngonna have three positive thoughts and\ni'm gonna do this over and over and over\nand over again and by doing this you're\nactually starting to rewire and\nreprogram your brain you're not going to\nbe the most positive person within seven\ndays but if you do this for a while over\nand over and over and over again you're\ngonna start to notice you're a lot more\npositive a person because you're\nstarting to re-wire yourself to be more\npositive and less negative\nso that's the second tip i'm gonna give\nyou about it first one write every\nsingle negative thought down number two\nwhenever you get a negative thought you\ngotta go ahead and take it and make\nthree positive thoughts out of it after\nyou write it down and number three\nis to program yourself\nwith gratitude and positivity from the\nbeginning of your day\nthe same way that if i were to get into\nmy car right now i live in austin texas\nand i were to go you know what i'm gonna\ngo to houston texas what am i gonna do\ni'm gonna take my phone out i'm gonna\nget my gps and i'm gonna say okay here's\nmy friend's address this is my intention\nis to go from austin texas to my friend\nmike's house\nin houston and it will take me there i\nwant to program myself in the morning\nset my gps every single morning\nto then get me to how i want to feel\nmy morning routine\nis not just a checklist my morning\nroutine\nis actually gearing me up for how i want\nto feel for the day and so what do i do\nthe first 15 minutes the very first\nthing that i do i wake up i go to the\nbathroom i drink water i brush my teeth\nand then what do i do the first 15\nminutes of my day 10 to 15 minutes i\nfocus on what can i be grateful for and\ni just find things to be grateful for\ni'm not trying to find things to be\ngrateful for just be grateful i'm trying\nto program gratitude into my brain what\nyou appreciate appreciate so if i'm\ngonna find more things to be grateful\nfor i'm going to set that reticular\nactivating system first thing in the\nmorning then i'm going to find\nthroughout the day\nmore things that i'm grateful for i'm\ngoing to feel better and i'm going to\ncreate more things to be grateful for so\nthe same way that if you wake up and\nyou're me like i don't want to be\nawake i don't want to be here i wish i\ncould just keep sleeping in i don't want\nto go to my stupid job\nyou start off on negativity you're going\nto be more negative throughout the day\ni'm going to program myself knowing that\nmy brain is naturally going to gear\ntowards negativity to actually program\nmyself and set myself up set my gps up\nto how i want to feel to be grateful and\npositive throughout the day\nso the third thing is to start every day\nwith gratitude set your mental gps for\nhow you want to feel because negativity\nis what you will geared towards\nbut if you start setting your if you\nturn your ship and go i want to go this\nway instead and you start focusing on\nthings that you could be grateful for\nyou'll find more things to be grateful\nfor you'll be more positive and within\nsix months a year two years three years\nyou notice that you're not the same\nperson and the reason why is because\nyou've changed yourself you've rewired\nyour brain and you've changed yourself\nto find things to be grateful for and to\nmake positive out of negative then you\nbecome an optimistic person when you\nused to be a pessimistic person so that\nis how you rewire yourself to destroy\nyour negative thoughts to become a\npositive person\nhow to always be positive and i don't\nmean it from a standpoint of like oh my\ngosh man let's just let's just be\npositive all the time and from a woo-woo\nstandpoint or any of those types of\nthings i'm talking about from an actual\npractical standpoint how can i make sure\nthat no matter what happens to me in my\nlife that i build the mental fortitude\nto be able to handle it no matter what\nit is because ultimately that's what\nwe're really trying to build an\nincredible mind for is to be able to\nhandle\neverything that life can throw at us in\nin reality we know that you know there\nare some beautiful moments of life there\nare some terrible moments of life and we\nwant to build a mindset that can handle\nall of those it's like the phrase a\nskilled sailor didn't stay inside of the\nharbor you have to go out and actually\nliterally go through and take some bumps\nand some bruises and you have to get out\nof the harbor in order to actually\nbecome a skilled sailor\nyou know a smooth sea never made a\nskilled sailor i think is actually the\nbetter phrase there's i think i just\ntook two phrases and put them together\nfor the first one uh and so whatever who\ncares you know what i'm trying to say\nand i mean from a practical standpoint\nhow can we make sure that no matter what\nhappens to us we are positive and i want\nyou to know this from the very beginning\ni'm not talking about how can we just\nignore all of the negativity i'm\nactually talking about more than\nanything else besides ignoring the\nnegativity is actually focusing more on\nthe negativity to extract the positive\nfrom the negative and so people are out\nthere like well i don't want to just\nignore the negative because positive\nthinking is a bad thing you shouldn't\njust think positive all the time i'm\nactually going to be talking about and\nteaching you how to extract positivity\nfrom all of the negative stuff that\nhappens around you and we're going to go\ndive into two aspects of your life the\nfirst one is your internal negativity\nwhich is just 100 you\nand then the second side is going to be\nyour external negativity which is also\nyou but it's also other people that\nmight be around you as well and the goal\nof today is for you to mentally sit\nthere maybe even with a pen and paper\nand to see how you can clear house in\nall of the different pockets of your\nlife and pull the negativity out of it\nso you can have as much beauty and joy\nas possible\nso we're talking about the internal\nnegativity you may have heard me say\nthis before but i always like to talk\nabout your mind as if it was a garden it\ncomes from a book as a man thinketh and\nhe says imagine that you're the gardener\nof this garden you're the only one that\nhas access to this garden it's\nimpossible for you to plant strawberry\nseeds and expect that tomatoes are\nsomehow going to grow because you can't\nplant strawberry season expects tomatoes\nthey're gonna it's not gonna happen same\nway that you can't have negative\nthoughts negative thoughts negative\nthoughts negative thoughts and then just\nautomatically you're just positive all\nthe time\nand so what happens is you have to\nnotice the negativity and just as if\nyou're a gardener see that that weed\ngrows you have to go pull the weeds as\nsoon as they pop up\nthe secret to it though is that you're\nthe only one that actually has access to\nthis garden there's no one else\nand so you can't allow that negativity\nto creep in when you do you have to\nimmediately identify that negativity go\nand pull it like a weed that's inside of\nyour garden and the reason why i say it\nonce you notice it\nis because you can't always control your\nfirst thought you have to rise up until\nthe moment that you're listening to this\nright now or watching it however you\nhappen to be consuming this piece of\ncontent\nyou have a lot of patterns and habits\nand traits that were built into you as a\nperson so you might immediately have a\nthought of judgment against somebody\nthat might not be the thought that you\nwant to have\nbut it's your first thought and a lot of\ntimes because of your programming\nbecause of your subconscious thoughts\nand everything that's been happening to\nyou up into the first 20 30 40 years of\nyour life whatever it is that the age\nthat you are that is your immediate\nfirst thought and you can't control your\nimmediate first thought right now but\nyou can always always always choose your\nsecond thought\nand so if you notice that a first\nthought comes in that is not the thought\nthat you want the same way that you\nwould pull the weed you got to pull it\nand immediately replace it with the\nthought that you do want the way that\nyou start to re-pattern yourself is to\nmake sure that you notice the things you\ndon't want and replace them with the\nthings that you do want now here's\nanother thing that you have to realize a\nlot of times people will have a judgment\nthought or\na negative thought or a thought that\nthey don't want to have and then instead\nof pulling that weed they now judge\nthemselves for having that negative\nthought that does nothing for you to\njust judge yourself for that negative\nthought that you now have\nit doesn't help you in any sort of way\nand in fact it makes it worse so it's\nlike looking at the weed and going oh my\ngosh weed why are you there i don't want\nyou to be there that's not gonna do\nanything to the weed get off your ass go\nand pull the weed that's what you need\nto do in your mind don't judge yourself\nfor it don't get emotional over it you\nlook at it and you say that weed is\nthere i need to pull that weed so you\ncan't control your first thought but you\ncan always control your second thought\nand the other thing that makes\nmakes it beautiful about life\nis realizing that negativity is going to\nhappen no matter what things are going\nto happen that you don't want to happen\nyou know\nfailures are going to happen people that\nyou love are going to die at some point\nin time not trying to get more but i'm\njust being very practical and realistic\nhere people that you love are going to\ndie relationships are going to end\npeople are going to be fired you know\nthings are going to happen in life that\nyou don't want to happen at some point\nin time\ninstead of allowing those things to get\nyou to go down a path of negative\nthinking or judgment or fear or worry or\nanxiety why don't you look at them\nknowing that it's going to happen\nthere's nothing you can do to avoid it\nand say what can i learn from this what\ncan i learn from every aspect of it i'll\ngive you an example my grandparents\npassed away a few years ago within 17\ndays of each other\ntragic sucks they have beautiful lives\nthough and so what i wanted to do\ninstead of getting sad and depressed\nabout it i'm not saying don't grieve is\nwhat i did was i actually sat down and i\nplanned out what i loved about them and\nhow i could put that into my personality\nso i can look at a death and something\nthat i didn't want to happen but did\nhappen\nand i can try to figure out some form of\npositivity from it because ultimately\nyou're either looking at the world one\nof two ways as if it's happening to you\nwhich is like oh what was me you know\nthis just happened this person broke up\nwith me this person died i'm so sad for\nmyself that's woe is me or you look as\nif something is happening for you\nimagine as if you're in the truman show\nyou know the show with jim carrey from\nyears ago in every single event every\nsingle challenge every single thing that\nhappens to you is a perfectly crafted\ncurriculum for the life that you are\ntrying to live as if somebody up there\nis just like okay now make it rain okay\nnow make this person break up this\nperson now make this person get fired\nwhatever it is because you have to go\nthrough those things in order to get to\nthe next level of life imagine as if\nit's just a giant game and life is just\na perfectly crafted curriculum for your\ngrowth\nif you thought of life that way how\ndifferently would you approach every\nsingle thing that happened to you every\nsingle challenge every single uh\nbeautiful thing and every single\nnegative thing that happens to you as\nwell\nlife is happening to you\nis a negative way of thinking of it life\nis happening for you is a beautiful\npositive way of thinking of it it's your\nchoice\nyou are the one that's able to decide\nwhich one it is because it's never about\nwhat happens in your life it's your\npercept\nperspective and perception of what\nhappens to you in your life and so you\ncould say okay yeah these things are\nhappening to me or these things are\nhappening for me so things are going to\nhappen it's never the event it's your\nperception of the event and how you're\nactually putting it into your life\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\none of the things that people really\nstruggle with the most when it comes to\nnegativity and positivity\nis that when these things do happen\nthey are almost resisting reality like\nthey don't want this negative thing to\nhave happened and so they're almost\nresisting it and trying to fight it even\nthough it's already happened they're\ntrying to fight it because they don't\nwant it to be that way and i will always\nsay this the amount of stress and\nanxiety and worry and fear and all of\nthose things that you feel around\nsomething or that you're currently going\nthrough will be in direct proportion to\nhow much you are resisting the way that\nthe world is\nlet me say that again the amount of\nstress anxiety worry fear all of those\nbad feelings that you don't want that\nyou're going through or will go through\nthroughout life will be in direct\nproportion to how much you are resisting\nthe way that the world is the world is\ngoing to happen people are going to die\nrelationships are going to end people\nare going to get fired people are going\nto run out of money all of these things\nare going to happen probably at some\npoint in time there's a chance that they\ncould happen to you or someone that you\nlove\nand if you resist it it's going to put\nyou into more stress anxiety fear\nwhatever\nbut if you accept it then you can\nrealize that now it's time to move on\nand see this as a challenge in life and\nnow you can go into it with an open mind\nmore positive in seeing it as a learning\nlesson you know if somebody passes away\nif you try to resist that you're going\nto put yourself into a torture chamber\nin your mind of resisting because you\ncan't bring that person back it's\nimpossible to bring them back\nso what can you do you can grieve but\nyou have to accept that's part of the\ngrieving process is to accept it\nand then try to take the beautiful\naspects that that person put into your\nlife\nif a relationship ends\nyour stress and anxiety will be higher\nif you are resisting that and wishing\nthat it were different than it currently\nis\nso\nyou have to realize we can't control all\nof those problems that happen to us but\nwe can always control our reaction to\nevery event in our life\nso that's talking about the internal\nnegativity that's your job is to clean\nhouse in your mind\nnow when we're talking about the\nexternal negativity let's dive into all\nof the different aspects of it first\nthing that we think about and i hear all\nof the time is rob what do i do if\npeople around me that i love are\nnegative and we have two options and\nreally two options that you have either\nnumber one you let them go and let them\nlive their life the way they want to or\nnumber two you have to figure out some\nway to spend less time with them\nit's that simple\nif you want to truly grow into the\nperson that you can become and someone's\nbringing you down either they need to be\nreleased and let go or you need to spend\nless time with them if you truly want to\nbecome the person that you can become\nright\nthose are the two options and you know\nwhichever one you choose is your choice\nand that's beautiful but ultimately you\nhave to realize if there's external\nnegativity around you it's crazy to\nthink that the external does not affect\nthe internal\nso if it's really important to you to\nbuild a big beautiful life that's\npositive that you love full of joy peace\nhappiness all of that\nit's going to be really hard to do when\nyou have people that are bringing you\ndown all of the time\nso i'm not saying that you need to just\nleave your parents and never see them\nagain what i'm saying though is can you\nspend less time with them if your mom\ncalls you and throws all of her worries\non top of you can you tell her to stop\ndoing that can you t and you have to\nread this you teach people how to talk\nto you so if that's happening for\ninstance where your mom's calling you\nand throwing all of the negativity and\nall of her worries on top of you just\nsay mom stop\ni don't want to listen to this don't\ncall me call somebody else anytime you\nwant to be negative right you teach\npeople how to talk to you and you're an\nadult now so teach people how you want\nto be talked to you have to realize that\nbecause the top five people that you\nspend the most time with you will be the\nmost like i always say if you want to be\na millionaire hang out with five other\nmillionaires you'll probably be the\nsixth if you want to be fit hang out\nwith five people who are really fit\nif you're hanging out with five\nalcoholics you're probably gonna be the\nsix if you're hanging out with five\npeople that are overweight you're\nprobably gonna be the six you are the\naverage of the five people that you\nspend the most time with you need to\nstart paying really close attention to\nwho the people are that you're hanging\naround with and how they\naffect your internal environment\nbecause ultimately\nyou might start to realize go through\nyour top five and say okay number one\ntwo three four five these are five\npeople i spend the most time with\nokay three of them are really great\nthree of them are really supportive two\nof them\ni need to spend some less time with\nthese two okay so let me drop these two\nout of my top five i can still hang out\nthem every once in a while and see them\nat family events or whatever it is but\nnow i can replace two other people that\ni know will support me and push me and\nallow me to think better and have them\nin my top five so that i can grow\nand expand into the person i know that i\ncan be\nnow some people say but rob i still live\nat home with my parents my mom is so\nnegative then what do i do well\nsee it as another challenge once again\nlike the truman show like i said a few\nminutes ago everything that happens to\nyou is a perfectly crafted curriculum\nfor you to become the best version of\nyourself so if you are in the truman\nshow and you're just bloop you're given\na negative mother as an example then how\ncan you see that as a challenge for you\nto become more positive in that\nenvironment\nright how can you see it as if it's a\ngame in order to get to the next level\nof life you have to eventually get past\nthis level that you're on and that might\njust have a really negative mother is\nthe example that you have in this level\nright and you have to think about it\nit's like a um it's like walking into\nyour house and it's fully negative if\nthat's what you have and there's nothing\nyou can do about it right now\nit's like walking into the gym for your\nmind right how can i go and lift as much\nweight as i possibly can to get my\nmuscles as big as possible that's how\nyou grow if you want to get bigger\nbiceps you do heavier bicep scrolls\nright if you want to get more positive\nand build a strong mental fortitude\nyou're gonna have to put it under some\nstrain here's your challenge if you\nchoose to accept it go into there and\nrealize that you're gonna be surrounded\nby negativity and you need to build this\nmental fortitude of positivity because\nthat's what you're that's what you're\ngiven you gotta figure it out so who do\nyou surround yourself with who do you\nspend the most time with on a day-to-day\nbasis and do you need to shift your top\nfive a little bit because you're going\nto become the people that you surround\nyourself with it's just the way that it\nworks you will hold yourself to the same\nstandards that everybody that you\nsurround yourself with as well do\nas well do i don't know that wasn't even\nright you're going you're going to\nyou're going to hold yourself to\nstandards that everyone else around you\nholds themselves to\nso you have to think about that so\nthat's part of externals the people that\nare around you other aspects of external\nthat you might not think of\nwell number one how about the music that\nyou listen to\nthis is a big one for me i didn't really\nrealize was was actually affecting the\nway that i feel like i have music that i\nlisten to now i have music that i used\nto listen to and i don't listen to as\nmuch anymore sometimes i'll indulge you\nknow when i was younger\nreally didn't like hardcore metal then i\nmoved in and had a roommate and we were\nboth musicians and i started to really\nappreciate it because\nhardcore metal like they're the best\nmost talented musicians in the world\nincredible but for me i've come to\nrealize that music makes me really\nanxious and it's super negative and\nabout killing and death and all of this\nstuff\ni can appreciate them from afar but i\ndon't listen to it anymore right i've\njust realized that that music and that's\njust me it might not be you it's okay\ni've just realized that that music the\nexternal of that music affects me some\nof the music i used to listen to hip hop\nrap music it's not the way that i live\nmy life and i don't want to say out loud\nsome of the things that they say because\nanything that i say out loud is an\naffirmation and going into my\nsubconscious and if i don't want to\ntreat people the way that they treat\npeople i'm probably not going to listen\nto that music do i still indulge every\nonce in a while yes as much as i used to\nabsolutely not so i try to literally\nlisten to music that i can feel inside\nof me is raising my\nvibration i guess you could say because\nmusic is a vibration you are a vibratory\nbeing and so you have to realize that's\ngoing to come into your body and make\nyou feel a certain way the words will\nthe music will the vibration well all of\nthat stuff well i'm not trying to be\nweird and woo of like your vibrations\nbut really essentially music is a\nvibration you are a vibratory being\nthere's no way around that so that music\nis affecting you in some sort of way so\nthink about that\nwhat else external affects you what\nabout the stuff you watch on tv\nthe news stop watching it it doesn't it\ndoesn't really inform you it doesn't\nkeep you informed it keeps you conformed\nthat's really what it does\nright there's other ways to get your\nnews\nthe news stations probably not the best\nespecially if you live in america right\nso news\nreality tv oh\nand some people like oh but i just watch\nreality tv because it's just mind\nnumbing and it's just fun to to watch\nwhat people do no you're watching people\ni've seen a lot of reality i've walked\nin the room when it's on\nscreaming treating people that you would\nnever want to treat that external you're\nyou're that's coming into your eyes it's\ncoming into your ears everything you are\nconsuming it the same way that if you\nwere to eat your shoe it's going to in\nsome form of\nsome way come into your body and make\nyou not feel good you're still consuming\nall of the stuff that you see in here\nthink about it that way what about games\nyou play do you play video games that\nare\nhardcore shoot-'em-up games that make\nyou anxious that are keeping you on the\nedge of your seat\ni had a friend that literally he was on\nthis podcast where he was playing video\ngames that were just hardcore games that\nkept him anxious and it clicked a part\nof his brain over and he wasn't able to\nsleep for a year and a half because of\nall of the anxiety that it created that\nwasn't just the video games but that was\nthe straw that broke the camel's back\nwhich shows you\nthose things come into your internal\nenvironment so if you're not going to go\nup and honestly like think about it if\nyou're not going to go out and shoot a\nbunch of people on the street why would\nyou want to do it on a tv\nreally deeply think about that and start\nto reassess it what you do is your own\nprerogative but really start to think\nabout these things that you do\nyou know i was playing vr the other day\nplayed it like for a few hours with one\nof my friends\nso much fun so incredible but when i was\ndone i realized my level of anxiety was\nso high because i was literally in vr in\nreality\nshooting things and it was just like\nthings were popping up and it was\nscaring me it's keeping on my seat it\nliterally raised my anxiety i was like i\ncan't do that again was it fun hell yeah\nit was fun but it literally made me feel\nbad after\nsomething to think about just think\nabout the games that you're playing\nhow about people you follow on social\nmedia\num\nthink about that just think about all of\nthe external pieces of your life because\nultimately everything that you consume\nis going to affect you in some form of a\ndifferent like whatever it is that you\ndo no matter what it is if you drink\ncyanide it's going to affect you because\nyou're consuming poison think about how\nmany forms of poison that you're\nconsuming that's not you know actual\ncyanide but stuff that you're seeing\nstuff that you're hearing people that\nyou're surrounding yourself with and\nthoughts that are going on inside of\nyour head ultimately the best thing for\nyou to do is take a pen and paper out\nright now and actually plan out\nwhat your life looks like the positive\nside the negative side and what you need\nto do to clear house of every aspect of\nthat negativity because ultimately\nthere's nobody in control of your life\ninternally and externally except for you\nyou need to sit down and actually plan\nit out as if it was a business and you\nwere creating a business plan because\ninternal and external environment are\ngoing to affect you in some form\nthat's just the truth\nyou have to see if it's something that\nyou want to be consuming or if it's\nsomething that's poisonous to you\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video have you ever\nwalked up to somebody\nand you just have a bad feeling around\nthat person like there's just a feeling\nof something's not right this can be a\nrich episode just so you know"
