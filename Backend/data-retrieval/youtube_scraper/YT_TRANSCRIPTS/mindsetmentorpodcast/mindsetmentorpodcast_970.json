    "transcript": "some of your foundations of what you\nbuild your life upon i promise you might\nget rocked 250\nof the memories that you have in your\nhead are not accurate so many people\nhave built their entire lives their\nentire identity everything that they\nknow about themselves that they love\nabout themselves that they hate about\nthemselves off of a perception of what\nthey think that they actually are\ni don't mean to offend anybody but\nsome of your foundations of what you\nbuild your life upon i promise you might\nget rocked i'm going to challenge your\nbeliefs i'm going to challenge the\nfoundation of what you built your life\nupon and show you how\nwe use cognitive biases to\ni guess you could say take over our own\nbrains and you know how the brain is\nactually playing tricks on us before we\neven realize it so let's dive into it\ni'm going to go over a couple different\nbias with you guys so the first one is\nsomething called confirmation bias\none of the things that's really funny\nabout being a human is we have this\nincredibly complex piece of machinery\nbetween our ears that is working without\nus ever trying to use it without us ever\nthinking about it without us\never trying to take control of it it's\nworking at all points in time and it's\ndoing what it's doing and if you don't\nknow how it works\nit could\nmess you up a little bit and that's why\nyou have to understand the way that we\nwork we think that our opinions are a\nresult of years of rational and\nobjective analysis right like if i say\ntell me your beliefs tell me your\nopinions and tell me why those are your\nbeliefs and your opinions you think the\nreason why is because they're a result\nof years of rational thinking and\nobjective analysis as to how the world\nworks and how you operate in it right\nnothing could be further from the truth\nthe truth is that your opinions are the\nresult of years of paying attention to\ninformation that confirmed how you\nbelieve while ignoring the information\nthat changed your would have changed\nyour perceptions so this is just all\npsychology these are all facts it's\ncalled confirmation bias you're\nliterally seeing the world\nseeing everything\nyou're only seeing what makes you feel\nlike you're right and you're missing\nwhat can prove you wrong another problem\nwith this is that you hang out with\npeople who only think exactly the same\nas you\nbecause it's really hard to hang out\nwith somebody who has a completely\ndifferent opinion on the world like if\nyou think of your top five friends they\nthink exactly the same way that you do\nthey have the same beliefs they're\nprobably around the same weight they\nprobably eat the same as you they work\nout around the same amount of time that\nyou work out they probably have the same\npolitical affiliations as you we hang\nout with people who only think exactly\nthe way that we think which then\nconfirms even more of our bias of yes\nthe way that we work in this world is\nright so the friends that we hang out\nwith\nthat's the first thing the people we\nsurround ourselves with\nhere's another thing that's really hard\nabout it the news that you watch if you\nwatch the news you're only what i\npromise you that if you're of a\npolitical affiliation or certain beliefs\nyou're only watching the news that is\ngoing to talk to you the way that you\nbelieve and to watch news on the other\nside really rocks the foundation for a\nlot of people\nand the third thing is online you're\nprobably only following people who think\nthe same as you which then confirms that\nthe way that you think is right because\nyou can see how many people think this\nway this isn't necessarily a negative\nthing it's not a positive thing either\nit just is the way that it is but when\nyou understand this you start to think\nto yourself are my beliefs actually my\nbeliefs or is it a little bit of nature\nand nurture is it the way that i was\nraised you know my parents told me this\nthis this this and then i just started\nhanging out with people who literally\nhave the same beliefs as my parents in\nsome sort of way or you could have maybe\nnot enjoyed your parents in the way that\nthey were so you started hanging out\npeople that were the exact opposite of\nthem that confirm the way that you\nbelieve very rarely do i hear people\ngoing yeah i love to hang out with\npeople that don't think the same as me i\nlove to hang out people of a different\npolitical party of different opinions of\ndifferent thoughts and feelings and all\nof that stuff and there was actually to\ngive you an idea of of how people read\nin 2009 ohio state did a study that\nfound that people people read\nor see me spent 36 percent more time\nreading essays that aligned with their\nopinions people want to read what is\ngoing to tell them that they they are\ncorrect now why is this really bad\nbecause there's another side of the\nstreet and you never really see the\nother side of the street now this was\nbad before\nsocial media the reason why social media\nends up being worse then that work makes\nthis worse is because there's algorithms\nyou know if you look at\ninstagram and you look at facebook and\nyou look at youtube and twitter and\nlinkedin all of those things are they're\njust computers there's not people\nrunning those there's people that build\nthese things called algorithms an\nalgorithm is a computer that just you\nknow a line of code that says if this\nperson clicks like on this person's post\nshow them more of their posts and so\nwhat happens is we create with with\nalgorithms with the people that we hang\nout the news that we watch the\nalgorithms that exist we create an echo\nchamber of only hearing our beliefs\nbecause here's the way that facebook\nworks let me just give you a real quick\nexample right i understand the\nalgorithms at a very deep level uh only\nbecause i think of everything on a\ncomputer all of these social medias and\nalgorithms that's the way that i was\nable to build a following of over three\nmillion people between instagram and\nfacebook is i was always thinking\nalgorithmically and i was always\nthinking psychologically if i can\nunderstand the way that people think and\ni can understand the way that computers\nthink i can then put out information\nthat people want to see and then also it\ncan start to go viral facebook only\nmakes money when you stay on facebook\nbecause then you see the ads the only\nway they're making money is through the\nads that's it there is no other way that\ni'm aware of i mean there might be other\nthings that are outside of it but\nfacebook as a company makes their money\nby selling\nselling advertisements and putting those\nadvertisements in front of you they make\nmoney when you stay on facebook so they\nwill give you what you want so if i'm of\na specific political party and i start\nto like certain things which i'm not i'm\nnot a part of any political party but if\ni was and i start to like a certain\nperson stuff facebook is then going to\nshow me more people who i might not even\nfollow who have the same political\naffiliation as me why because i want to\nread things that confirm that i'm right\nso you're seeing even more of what makes\nyou think that you're right all of those\nthings firm up the belief that anything\ndifferent than what you believe is\nabsolutely incorrect and you can feel it\nphysically can't you when someone\nchallenges your beliefs you can feel it\nphysically inside of your body as if\nyou're getting attacked that's why you\nsee so many adults acting like children\nin the comments section of youtube and\nfacebook and instagram is because they\nare literally feeling physically\nattacked by other people because they\ndon't\nthey don't like seeing things outside of\nwhat they think is right to them so you\nonly like to be told what you already\nknow how ridiculous is that though to\nthink that we already know everything in\neverything that we know is right right\nlike how how ridiculous is it for me to\nbe like i already know everything and\neverything that i believe is actually\ncorrect that's ridiculous isn't it and\nconsciously i think everybody who's\nlistening right now knows how insane\nthat sounds for me to go i'm right on\neverything that i think and everything\nthat i believe and everything that i\nknow is correct and i already also\nalready know everything and we can\nconsciously think that like wow that\nsounds ridiculous that sounds i would\nnever think that way\ni'm not like that no way but if i were\nto bring up a big issue that you believe\nin whatever that big issue is and tell\nyou that you're wrong\nthen we can really see how you react\nthen there's usually a trigger and that\ntrigger shows you where you're not free\nany trigger that anything that triggers\nyou shows you where you're stuck in life\nif\nsomeone comes up to me and brings up\nsome big issue\nand i get pissed it's showing me where\ni'm still stuck in life that's in the\nmoment you know how you spend your time\nwith people who you spend your time with\nwhat you spend your time learning we\nwill only search for things that teach\nus not always and i want to say always\nbut most of the time unless you're aware\nof it we will search for things that are\ngoing to show us that what we believe in\nis correct what about when something you\nbelieve\nends up being bad\nor you voted for somebody and they did\nsomething bad now we roll into what's\ncalled another cognitive bias\nand it's called choice supportive bias\nfirst off we have confirmation bias\nwhich means that i'm only going to\nread the news that supports my beliefs\nor i'm only going to hang out with these\npeople that support my beliefs and it's\nnot just political beliefs but it's all\ntypes of beliefs it could be religious\nbeliefs it could just be spiritual\nbeliefs it could be whatever it is\nthere's so many different beliefs that\nwe have i want to be around people who\nsupport my beliefs so now we roll into\nanother cognitive bias which is called\nchoice supportive bias when you make a\ndecision\nwhatever that decision is we will only\nsee the positives this is so crazy when\nyou actually start to think about it we\nwill only see the positives in that\ndecision most of the time and not see\nthe negative let me give you a real good\nexample right i have an iphone i had an\niphone for i had a samsung for the\nlongest time and i switched about five\nyears ago four years ago to an iphone\nand uh and then you notice that people\non the samsung side hates iphones and\nthey'll tell you why iphones are the\nworst and people on the iphone side will\nhate samsung and they'll tell you why\nthose are wrong so like let's say i have\nan iphone right we'll make it something\njust\nsilly and simple that does happen right\ni have an iphone and overnight\nit decides and wants to update and then\nthere's a bunch of bugs and it starts to\nfail and my friend allen who has a\nsamsung i do have a friend of mine he\nhas a samsung we we always talk about\nthis and we always make fun of him\nbecause we're like hey i'm going to air\ndrop you some photos alan oh\ni can't right and so we always make\nthese jokes with him but he's hardcore\nhe will not switch because he's just so\nhardcore in it and uh and so let's say\nmy phone updates\nand something fails\nand my friend allen comes over and he's\nlike well yeah of course it did because\nthat would never happen with the samsung\nright what's gonna happen with me i need\nto then back up my choice to have bought\nan iphone right this is this is the the\nperfect example of choice supportive\nbias i\nmade a choice\ni need to now support that choice and\nshow why that choice was right so i need\nto back up my choice for the iphone oh\nyeah well you know maybe it messed up\ntoday but alan we know that the pictures\nare so much better on the iphone we know\nthat the ecosystem makes it so much you\nknow what i don't care if it fails\nbecause eventually when the bug gets\nfixed i'm at least going to have the\necosystem the ecosystem is the best part\nof it we see this happening all of the\ntime with political parties don't we\ndemocrats versus republicans one party\ndoes something wrong and you know let's\nsay i'm a part of a political party x\nand my my political party does something\nabsolutely wrong i'll just look over it\nand explain why my party's still better\nand then political party y does\nsomething wrong and my friend who's part\nof political party why is oh yeah but\nyou know that's okay because we're still\nbetter in this way and what happens is\nif i'm part of political party x\nand political party y does something bad\ni'll only see they're bad but i won't\nsee any of the good stuff that they do\nbecause i have to prove to myself why my\ndecision to vote for political party x\nwas the correct decision then person of\npolitical party y will only see all of\nthe bad and political party acts and\nthey won't see any of the good because\nwe have to confirm\nand we have to show that our choice was\nthe right choice\neven if it's blatantly obvious that\nsomething's wrong we see people do this\nall the time with presidents that they\nvote for and no matter what country\nthat's you and i'm sure you see this\nright you vote for a president the\npresident does something\nand the person who voted for him will\ncompletely miss it and explain why he's\nstill better even though it's blatantly\nobvious to the thing that he did you\nknow how even though it's blatantly\nobvious that maybe their party did\nsomething or maybe that person sucks why\ndo we do this why do we have to feel i\nmean if you really think about it it's\nit's a frail ego is really what it is we\nas humans\nwant to feel like we're really\nconcrete in who we are\nwhat we believe in what we do a lot of\ntimes we don't even like knowing that\nwe're wrong\nand we don't like being told that we're\nwrong and we don't like someone proving\nthat we're wrong and we'll do anything\nto see\nways that we're not wrong\nso we tend to rationalize our choices\nespecially when they're bad why because\nwe have to tell her oh my gosh that was\na bad person to vote for oh my gosh\nthere's a bad political party to vote\nfor oh that was a bad you know purchase\nof my iphone we have to show ourselves\nwhy that thing that we decided to do in\nour past was correct so we have to know\nwho we are\nnothing makes a\nand i've worked with thousands of people\nnothing will shake a person up more than\nwhen their beliefs of who they think\nthey are are foundationally shook up\nit's so hard for them to do it it causes\nsomething called cognitive dissonance\ncognitive dissonance means i believe\nthat the world is this way i believe\nthat this is right and this is right and\nthis is right and we can get facts on\nfacts on facts as to why that's wrong\nand you can literally see somebody\nattack\nbefore listening\nto going um\ni might have actually really been wrong\nit causes cognitive dissonance the way\nthat i think that the world is is\nactually not the way that the world is\nso what's the solution\ni know that nobody listening to this\nconsciously\nyou know wants to consciously be stuck\nin their way\nunopened to hear other people's sides\nand other people's stories because if we\ndon't open ourselves up to hearing other\npeople's opinions\neventually we're gonna get old and\nsenile and stuck like you've seen people\nwho have been stuck in their ways for a\nlong time and it gets more and more hard\nand concrete the longer that they live\nthat way so what can we do\nchallenge ourself when you have a belief\nask yourself first off is this my belief\nor is this a belief that was put into me\nas a child is this what my parents\nbelieved is this what society told me to\nbelieve is this what my friends believe\nso i just kind of followed the group\nchallenge your beliefs start asking\nyourself is this what i truly believe in\nis this belief right\nchallenge your thoughts\nchallenge your past decisions and be\nopen to the fact that maybe we're not\nright\na lot of times maybe we're wrong a lot\nof times it's okay and be open to other\nsides of the road other sides of the\nstreet other people's opinions thoughts\nand just think maybe i'm not always\nwriting everything that i believe do\ndifferent things push yourself outside\nof your comfort zone go talk to someone\nwho doesn't think the same as you allow\nyourself to be challenged in ways that\nyou've never been challenged nothing is\nworse than someone who thinks that\nthey're right stays in that decision for\nthe rest of your life and gets old and\nhard and senile and oh i'm concrete and\nwho i am that's called a fixed mindset i\ndon't know about you i want to have a\ngrowth mindset of i can change i can be\ndifferent i want people to come in and\nbe like you're wrong and this is why\nyou're wrong and i want them to piss me\noff so i can find my triggers right this\nis why a lot of people get older and\nthey get ridiculously firm in their\nbeliefs\nwe see it all of the time and so you\nhave to realize\nwe have to be open\nto not being right all the time we have\nto be open to learning to the fact that\nwhat we believe in isn't correct we have\nto be open to the fact that you know\nwhat the way that i see the world is\nactually not correct and we have to be\nokay and not have a small small ego that\nthat just gets shook so easily to go you\nknow what\ni'm learning i'm growing i made a\ndecision my past it wasn't good i'm\ntrying to improve i'm trying to get\nbetter this belief that i have let me\nchallenge let me figure out where it\ncame from let me see if it's actually\nwhat i believe in\nbecause i don't know about you i\nconstantly want to try to learn and grow\nand when i understand that these biases\nexist i understand why i think the way\nthat i think i understand why i act the\nway that i act and so if you can\nunderstand these two cognitive biases\nnumber one is confirmation bias be\naround people and do things that that\nmake you think different that are\noutside of the way that you think matu\nis choice supportive bias maybe my\ndecisions in the past weren't right\nmaybe that purchase wasn't right maybe\nthat vote wasn't right whatever it is\nand realize\nthat to get into something called\ncognitive dissonance where my world view\nis flipped over on top of its head and\nnow i have to start to you know pick up\nthe pieces and put it together is a good\nthing the more that i can get my brain\nblown\ninto shreds and then try to pick up all\nthe pieces and put it back together the\nstronger that i feel my mind gets it's\nthe same way as growing a muscle the\nonly way to grow muscle is to go in and\nyou know lift really heavy and destroy\nthat muscle for it to grow and destroy\nthat muscle for its grown destroy that\nmuscle for it to grow it's the exact\nsame way with your brain and with your\nmind constantly be challenging yourself\nconstantly to be challenging your\nbeliefs constantly challenging your\nthoughts and constantly be challenging\nyour past decisions so that you don't\nallow yourself to get stuck so that your\nbrain\nisn't always playing tricks on you there\nare studies that have been done that\nfind out that up to 50\nof the memories that you have in your\nhead are\nnot accurate\nthey're not true\nup to 50 of them and a lot of times\nyou're actually not even remembering the\nactual event\nyou're remembering the memory of the\nactual event so it's kind of like\nplaying telephone right where you know\nsomebody says something in someone's ear\nand it goes around and by the time it\ngets to the other to the last person\nit's a completely different phrase or\nit's also kind of like if you've ever\nused a copy machine like if you take a\ncopy machine and you you place it on on\nthe copy you know take a picture you put\non the copy machine you copy it and then\nyou take that copy not the original\npicture but you take that copy and put\non the copy machine and you copy it you\ntake the next copy and you put it you\ncopy and you copy it and you copy and\nyou copy and copy it and you look at the\noriginal\nphoto and then you look at 15 copies in\nyou're looking at you're like dad this\ndoesn't even look the same that's how a\nlot of our memories are now this is not\ndone in a malicious way in any sort of\nway it's just the way the human brain\nworks and so you might have a memory\nbut it might be completely different\nthan the actual truth because of how\nmany times you've gone through it\nalso though people that you talk to\npeople that you work with people that\nare your employees people that you're\nclose to have this exact same thing and\nso there's three different types of\nthings that people do when they remember\nsomething and they tell you about it so\nif if i'm remembering a memory\nan event whatever it is\nand then i'm going to tell you about it\nthe reason why this is interesting is\nbecause i can do one of three things\ni can generalize i can delete or i can\ndistort and i coach i teach coaches how\nto grow coaching businesses and part of\nthat you know i teach them\nhow to coach other people i teach them\nhow to grow the business but i also\nteach them how to coach other people and\ni tell everybody when you're coaching\nsomebody be very aware that they're\ngoing to delete they're going to distort\nand they're going to generalize the\nstuff that they tell you and once again\nit's not their their fault it's not\nmalicious they're not doing it\non purpose they don't even know that\nthey're doing it most people are not\neven i'd say 99.9 of people\nare not even aware this is going on but\nit's important for you to understand\nbecause number one you need to\nunderstand this about yourself and\nyou're going to find out why that's\nimportant in just a little while but\nit's also really important for you to\nunderstand other people as well now\nbefore we dive into these three\ndifferent things\nthere is something really important to\nbring up before i talk about\ngeneralizing deleting and distorting\nthere's one really important thing to\nbring up everybody is viewing the world\ndifferently so you and i can be in a\nroom and we could you know be looking at\nthe exact same room but we're all seeing\nsomething differently it's like we're\nall wearing different colored glasses\nlike if i'm wearing red glasses and i'm\nlooking at the world\nand you're right next to me and you're\nwearing green glasses and you're looking\nat the world we're gonna be seeing all\nof the exact same stuff the same bushes\nthe same cars the same sun sky leaves\nwe're gonna see all the same stuff but\nit's all going to look different simply\nbecause we're wearing different colored\nglasses and that's the equivalent of\npeople who are filtering the their\nreality\nthrough\nall of their programs through their life\nthrough their past through their\njudgments through their traumas through\neverything that's ever happened to them\nso i'll give you an example let's say me\nand you are walking down the street\nright we're walking down the street and\nuh we walk by a dog that's on the other\nside of a fence and maybe the dog runs\nup to the fence doesn't even bark just\nruns up to the fence and let's say that\nwhen you were younger you were attacked\nby a dog and i wasn't and then later on\nin the day you might say something oh\nyeah what about like what about that dog\nwe're on the walk\ni might be like i don't i don't remember\nany dog what are you talking about but\nyou might remember it\nand you might remember it simply because\nthe sight of the dog\nthat you saw running clicked into your\nhead reminded you of an event a trauma\nit puts your body into a heightened\nstate of emotion it brought all of your\nattention to that dog to make sure is\nthis a threat do i need to run do i need\nto fight do i need to flee what is it\nthat i need to do and so even if i\ndidn't notice a reaction from you\nyour body did a ton of different things\nbio like bio biologically\nneurobiologically all of those things\ndid a ton of different processing and it\nwas a super heightened state you need to\nmake sure you didn't get attacked\nbecause simply you were attacked when\nyou were a child but let's say at that\nexact same moment that the dog was there\ni was looking at some palm trees and the\nreason i was looking at palm trees was\nbecause i've been thinking about putting\npalm trees on my property so i've been\nin the market for buying palm trees i've\nbeen talking to\nlandscapers where they've designed where\nthe palm trees are going to go i've been\nfiguring out how much you know they're\ngonna cost me and i'm like oh my god\nthey're gonna cost so much money just\nget a freaking palm tree on my property\nso we're in the exact same moment at the\nexact same place but you're seeing a dog\nbecause of the way that the world is\nfiltering through your brain i'm seeing\npalm trees because of the way that the\nworld is filtering through my brain\nwe're seeing the exact same thing but\nwe're both seeing something different\nthat's why memories a lot of times oddly\nenough it's hard to say can't always be\ntrusted because i was completely unaware\nof something that was happening and you\nwere completely aware of something that\nwas happening as well we're both walking\non the same street but we're both seeing\nand remembering two completely different\nthings so that's the first thing to know\nbefore we dive into the three different\nways that the world changes right let's\ndive into it generalizing so people will\ngeneralize what's going on so when i\nused to work in a sales company i had\nyou know i trained a couple thousand\nsales reps under me and my sales reps\nused to come in and they used to do\nthese things called phone jams where\nthey'd sit down and they'd want to make\na bunch of phone calls to set up\nappointments so they could you know set\nup their demonstration and go sell their\nproducts every single phone jam this\nwould happen someone would come in to\nwork\nand then they'd work for about an hour\nand a half two hours and i'd walk up so\nwe might be like hey john how's it going\nsomething along these lines would happen\nevery single time\noh i've made so many phone calls but\nnobody's home\nand i would say\nnobody's home yeah nobody's home and i\nwould say we used to be in fort\nlauderdale is where i have my office so\nthat's broward county i would say john\nthere's 1.7 million people\nin broward county in the surrounding\nareas\nwithin 30 minutes of our location 1.7\nmillion people and you're telling me\nthat nobody\nis home\nnobody there's not one person 1.7\nmillion people\nand they go well it's not that it's not\na nobody's home\nit's just you know the people that i've\nbeen around and i've been calling\nhaven't been home i'm like okay how many\nphone calls have you made oh i've been\nmaking a ton i've been here for two\nhours okay how many of you made i don't\nknow i haven't been tracking it okay\njohn give me your phone real quick and\ni'd have them give me their phone i look\nat it and i go john you've literally\nbeen here for two hours you've made\nseven phone calls how many of those\npeople\nare not home uh well three of them\ndidn't pick up and four people said no\nokay so john do you realize what\nhappened here\nyou called three people who weren't home\nand then you generalized that 1.7\nmillion people would not be home\ndo you see how when you speak in\nabsolutes of nobody is home how that is\ngoing to change the actions that you're\ngoing to take because think about this\nlet me take myself out of this situation\njust talk directly to you guys don't you\nsee how if you speak in absolute\nnobody's home nobody likes me no\nthere's never any opportunities for me\ni've\nwhatever your your absolutes are when\nyou have an absolute it's really hard to\npull yourself out of that absolute it's\nlike digging a ditch that you can't get\nout of so when someone says nobody is\nhome\ndoes that motivate them to make more\nphone calls no of course not it actually\ndemotivates them from making any more\nphone calls because why would they keep\nmaking calls if nobody's home and so\nwhat happens is in this case this is\njust a simple example\nbut i want you to think of how many\ntimes in your life you generalize\nin in place an absolute over something\nthat is not absolute nobody's home is an\nexample\nor you know you've been on a couple bad\ndates and there's no good guys left\nright or you've had a couple girls cheat\non you and you say all women are\ncheaters right and you're putting an\nabsolute and you're generalizing an\nentire population of 3.75 billion people\nby placing an absolute on top of it\nright so people tend to generalize\nwhenever they retell a story this is\nimportant for you to know so that you\ncan work on your own personal thumb and\nstart thinking about how you generalize\nbut it's also important for when you\ntalk to other people and people are\ntelling you the story you can go oh yeah\nthat's\nthat's a generalization no big deal i\ndon't need to call the person out but i\ncan hear them speaking absolutely i can\nhear them generalizing what they're\ntalking about so that's the first thing\npeople do is they will generalize the\nsecond thing that people do is they will\ndelete\nthey will take an actual story\nand they will remove pieces of the story\nto fit their narrative or to fit how\nthey currently feel right so they'll\nremove pieces of the story or they'll\nremove pieces of the reality so that it\nfits their story and it fits their\nnarrative\nso\nhow often do you delete\nthink about that for a second how often\ndo you go through and you delete\ninformation\nfrom a story when the story was there it\nwas right in front of you but you\ndeleted it\nright how often do you hear other people\ntake bits and pieces of stories and\ndelete certain aspects of it\nright where someone's like oh yeah you\nknow\nlike if somebody\npeople have done this before right oh\nyeah i just can't find a good guy all\nguys are cheaters but they forgot to\ntell you that they cheated on him first\nright\nsomething like that could happen where\nthey delete a piece of the story so that\nthe story fits the narrative that they\nhave\nso\nhow often do you delete the information\nand not necessarily\ntell the truth\nbut you just remove a couple pieces that\nare kind of important for people to know\nright so that's the second thing people\ndo is they will delete good for you to\nknow for yourself but also for other\npeople\nand the last piece of what they'll do is\nthey will distort\nright and this happened with one of my\nteam members one of my my people that\nare on my team\nand we were talking about important\nappointments this is actually this\nmorning and uh he didn't have his week\nfully booked up\nright today's thursday so it was this\nmorning so we're talking monday tuesday\nwednesday today was thursday and which\nmeans he only has today and tomorrow to\nget the rest of his appointments booked\nup and so he said\nhe was going to come up short for his\nweekly goals and he said i did\neverything i could do\nwhich is you know once again\ntaking all of the blame off of himself\nand putting his blame ex externally and\ni was like okay you did everything you\ncould do which is a form of deletion i'm\nsorry distortion i said you did\neverything you could do and he's like\nyeah and i said everything\nand he's like yeah and i said okay\nis there a possibility\nthat you could have stayed up until\nmidnight and i don't want them to stay\nup to midnight but i just you know gave\nthis example that you could have stayed\nup until midnight trying to book up the\nrest of your week and he's like yeah and\ni go so did you do everything you could\ndo he's like well no and i was like\nlisten i don't want you to work until\nmidnight but i want you to become aware\nof the fact that you just spoke and said\neverything i could do which means that\nyou're taking all of the blame off\nyourself and you're blaming it\nexternally when you blame on something\nexternally it takes all of your power\naway because you don't have power or\ncontrol over anything externally the\nonly thing you have power control over\nis yourself another example i gave him i\nsaid okay\nlet's say\nthat on monday let's say that he wanted\nto do 20 appointments i'm just going to\nuse an example right he want to do 20\nappointments that was his goal and today\nhe's short of those 20 appointments he's\nnot going to hit that number what if on\nmonday i would have said listen i don't\neven want you to work till midnight i\nwant you to work just working hours just\nnine to five and if you get these 20\nappointments booked up i will pay you\none\nmillion dollars cash\nbut you have to get those 20 points\nbooked up you have to complete the 20\nappointments\ndo you think that if i would have\nbrought that to your attention and told\nyou that that you would have gotten your\nappointments booked up and he's like\nyeah i would have and i said so\nis it true that you did everything that\nyou could\nand he's like no i guess it's not and i\nwas like do you see how that's a form of\ndistortion you distorted the story and\nthere's no judgment i'm just trying to\nmake him aware of it so that he can now\nhave power over his own life and his own\nnarrative because i want him to hit his\ngoals i want him to make the money he\nwants to make but what i have to make\nhim understand is how this narrative of\ndoing everything that i could do is\ncomplete and once he is aware\nof that the next time it pops up he's\nable to change his narrative to fit so\nthat he can hit his goals so you know if\ni would have given him a million dollars\ncash\nand i said complete 20 appointments he\nwould have probably completed 40\nappointments just in case he heard me\nwrong right don't you think he would be\nlike i gotta make that million dollars\ni'm gonna do 40 appointments just in\ncase maybe i heard him maybe i said\nsomething maybe i didn't completely\nunderstand if i do 40 though i know i'm\ndefinitely going to hit that number so\nyou can distort reality\nbecause did you do everything you could\ndo no that was a distortion so when you\nlook at these things you have to realize\nthat all of the memories of your past\nyou've got to look back at them and\nrealize that we give a lot\nof power to our past we get a lot of\npower to our story and we are the way\nthat we are because of our past how\noften do we think that how often do we\nsay that i am the way that i am because\nof my pastor i am the way i am because\nof my mom or because of my dad or\nbecause of my sister because of whatever\nhappened to me but how true is that if\nup to 50 of what we remember could be\nfalse\nmaybe we are the way that we are because\nof our perception\nor could be false perception of what\nhappened to us in our past so maybe\nwe're giving out all of our power away\nto something that isn't even actually\ntrue and might be completely false maybe\nwhat we're doing is we're basing our\nlife off of a past that isn't even\nactually true\nmaybe what we should do is we should\nstart thinking deeper about everything\nthat we do and go you know what if\nthat's the case if maybe a lot of stuff\nthat i see and hear and\nheard in my past and all these things\nmight not be true\nmaybe i can take my own power back and\ngo it doesn't matter what happened in\nthe past\nbecause half of that isn't even true in\nthe first place what matters is what i\ndo right now what matters is that i'm\ngoing to take all of the blame all of\nthe responsibility i'm going to put on\nmyself and say you know what no matter\nwhat goes on no matter what happens i'm\ngoing to\ndo what needs to be done to create the\nlife that i want to create because at\nthat moment you take your power back and\nyou say it doesn't matter if i delete it\ndoesn't matter if i distort it doesn't\nmatter if i generalize it doesn't matter\nwhat happened to me in my past it\ndoesn't matter what color glasses i wear\ni'm going to let go of all of that bs\nand what i'm going to do is i'm going to\nstep into a powerful version of myself\nbecause my past isn't 100 true\nthen the only thing i know is true is\nwhere i'm sitting right now and the\nactions that i take right now and the\nactions that i take right now will then\ncreate the future that i want because\nyour memories aren't necessarily true so\ndon't base your life on the past base\nyour life on the future of what it is\nthat you're going to create this is\ngoing to be kind of groundbreaking and\nmind-blowing for a lot of people 99 of\npeople listening to me right now or\nwatching me however you're consuming\nthis content\nyour perception of yourself is\ncompletely\nfalse and let me explain to you why that\nis there's a quote that's really good\nthat i'm going to give you from a guy\nnamed charles cooley and the quote\nsummarizes all of this perfectly and he\nsays i'm not who i think i am i'm not\nwho you think i am i am who i think that\nyou think i am\nnow what the hell does that mean let me\nsay one more time i'm not who i think i\nam i'm not who you think i am i am who i\nthink that you think that i am so what\nexactly does this even mean\nwell let's dive into it most people\nthink that they are who they are through\ntheir own perception\nof what they think other people think\nthey are so i think\nthat i am the person that i see that you\nthink that i am now this is a really big\nproblem because we're dealing with a\nperception of a perception right so not\nonly is all of this completely false\nit's so far from who you truly are but\nso many people i'm gonna tell you why\nthis is but so many people have built\ntheir entire lives their entire identity\neverything that they know about\nthemselves that they love about\nthemselves that they hate about\nthemselves off of a perception of what\nthey think that they actually are and it\nall starts off because in reality the\nway that we learn the world and how to\nnavigate through the world\nis through our parents but we also learn\nwho we are\nthrough our parents we start off and we\nbecome who we think our parents think we\nare that's the reason why parents need\nto be so careful with what they say\naround their kids and what they do\naround their kids because the children\nare literally going to build themselves\nup\nbased off of what they see what they\nthink what they hear children become\nwho they think their parents think they\nare right and you know it's it's\nterrible but some children are verbally\nabused when they're younger it's a\nterrible thing and a lot of people never\nget over it why because even though a\nlot of people consciously know as adults\nonce they grow up they consciously know\nthat the things that may have been said\nto them when they were not when they\nwere you know little tiny children and\nthey were just a sponge they might\nconsciously know those things are false\nbut in their subconscious their\nsubconscious is still holding it as true\nbecause they're not consciously thinking\na lot as a child if an adult comes up to\na child and says you are stupid the\nchild a lot of times is you know two\nthree four years old is not sitting\nthere and actually saying well is this\ntrue is this false is this true is this\nfalse it's like a big human just came up\nto me and told me i'm stupid they're\nsmarter than i am i don't know how to\nnavigate this world perfectly still so\nthey must be right i must be stupid and\nsome people will be told something by an\nadult as a child\nand they take that as their truth and\nthey act like it's their truth for the\nrest of their life but the problem\nwith that is that we're living our lives\nthrough what we see in other people and\nwe also have a\nreally\nbig problem and the big problem is that\npeople who are talking to you\nas a child\nas you're growing up as a teenager and\neven right now every single person has a\nskewed perception based off of their\nchildhood so looking\nto somebody else\nfor information on who you are is like\nlooking into a broken mirror to see what\nyou look like let me say that again\nlooking to someone else for information\nabout who you are is like looking into a\nbroken mirror to see what you look like\nyou'll never see the true picture\nbecause everybody who you talk to has\ndifferent paradigms and different\nperceptions of the world around them and\nso you're going to be seeing yourself\nthrough this broken perception which\nisn't true and so if you if you base off\nyour if you base your entire life based\noff of someone else's perception you're\ngoing to be living something that's\ncompletely false\nimagine this real quick and i'll bring\nthis together so it makes more sense and\nit's not as abstract let's imagine that\nyou remind someone of their dad\nright maybe you look like him maybe you\ntalk like him\nmaybe you know you uh you have the same\ntype of personality whatever it is let's\njust say that they loved their dad\nhe was an amazing man he did everything\nthat he could he's still around he loves\nthe hell out of this person and you\nremind\nthat person of their dad then they are\ngoing to have amazing feelings around\nyou and that's going to show when they\nare around you and when someone has\namazing feelings towards you and they\nlet that show\nwell what's going to happen it will make\nyou feel good about yourself and you'll\nthink man i must be a good person i must\ni must you know you feel good when\nsomeone feels good around you right so\nif they love if you remind someone of\ntheir dad\nwhatever it is that reminds them\nthen you're going to have this\nperception of yourself through that\nperson who love their dad and be like\ndamn i must be really awesome because\nthat person really liked me okay now\nlet's flip it\nlet's say that you just happen to look\nlike their dad or you look like their\nmother if you're a female let's say\ntheir dad or their mom was a terrible\nperson and you just happen to look just\nlike him\nthen what are they going to think of you\nit has nothing to do with you and who\nyou are it has everything to do based\noff of their perception of another\nperson in their childhood that they're\nbringing to them now they're not going\nto like you not because it's your fault\nbut simply because of their own\nperception of what you remind them of\nand it might make you feel worse about\nyourself because you don't even know\nthat you remind them of their dad\nneither one of those situations whether\nthey like you or whether they don't like\nyou based off of whether they like their\ndata whether they don't like their dad\nneither one of those has anything to do\nwith you and that's why this is so\ndangerous that's why it's so important\nto find out who you are\nand decide who you're going to be\nyou know if i ask you right now\nlet's play a game let's do this together\nif i ask you who are you\ni want you to answer right now answer it\nin your head who are you\nanswer it think about that for a second\ntake a few seconds who are you say it\nout loud bring as many things into your\nconscious awareness that are you that\nsay who you are\nright\nand so you know some of you might say\nyour name oh i'm rob dial some of you\nmight say i'm a mother of two i'm a\nfather of three i am 35 years old i am\nfrom florida i am a brother i am a\nsister i am a cousin i have i am a ceo\nof a beverage company i am a janitor at\nthe beverage company whatever it is\nyou're going to say these things i'm a\ncollege graduate i went to the\nuniversity of florida when i asked you\nwho you are you're going to start naming\noff external things\nbut none of those are actually who you\ntruly are none of those things your name\nthe fact that you're a mother or father\nyour age where you're from if you're a\nbrother sister if you went to college if\nyou dropped out of college if you got a\ndegree if you have multiple degrees none\nof those things are actually who you\ntruly are i'll give you an example that\nmakes let's let's just really try to\ndumb this down as much as possible so i\ncan just like make it so it's as simple\nas i possibly can i drive a 2018 ford\nraptor i am not a 2018 ford raptor right\nnow you might be like oh yeah that makes\ncomplete sense of course you're not why\nwould i ever think that you're a car\nwell i bought the car which means that i\nhave quote unquote achieve the buying of\na car\nso then why would you if i'm not a ford\nraptor\nthen why are you a college graduate why\nare you a mother why are these are all\nthings that you have done and some of\nyou think that you're a mother or father\nwhich you are but at the deeper level\nright at the deepest sense\nyou were someone else before you birthed\nchildren\nweren't you\nwho were you\nbecause you're always looking to the\nexternal to figure out who you are\nyou're always looking to other people or\nyour accomplishments or your pay or your\njob or what is it you do or your name\ntag to figure out who you actually are\nbut at your core level that's not who\nyou are\nright if i say i'm rob dial that's just\na bunch of you know\nsounds that were put together and given\nto me at birth i wasn't rob dial when i\nwas born though\nso who am i oh let's get really deep\nright at a core level who are you this\nis why so many people have so much\ntrouble when their children leave and\nthey become empty nesters\nis because they are they they're like\nfor years for 18 20 25 30 40 years\nsometimes they have identified\nthemselves as a parent well then when\ntheir their children leave and they\ndon't have somebody to parent they're\nalways like well who the hell am i\nand it becomes this big wake up life i\ndon't know who i am because people base\nwho they are based off of the external\nnot the internal we base it off of other\npeople's perceptions as well\nwe base everything off of other people's\nperceptions or the external but none of\nthose things are actually who you truly\nare you weren't a parent when you were\nfour years old were you\nso being a parent is something that\nyou've done it's something that you've\naccomplished i'm not saying there's\nanything wrong with being a peer but you\nweren't a parent when you were four\nyears old\nso who are you\nyou know i wasn't a ford raptor driver\nwhen i was four years old either these\nare all just external things that we've\naccomplished over time or gotten over\ntime so you have to stop basing\nwho you are\noff of other people's perceptions of you\nor external accomplishments or things\nabout you now\nthis might be really messing with some\nof your minds but when you really get it\nyou can actually see how powerful it is\nbecause if you are none of those things\nthat you actually think that you are\nthen what are you\nyou know are you just a spiritual being\nor a soul or whatever you want to call\nit that's just inhabiting this meat suit\ncalled your body right think about that\nand this is why it's so messed up and\nthis is why we could go so deep into it\nright i'll give you a really good\nexample through a story and how this can\nchange how this this little tiny mini\nperception can completely change your\nlife right there's a story about\nthis kid and he's uh in the 11th grade\nand he's been failing all of his class\n9th grade 10th grade barely getting into\nthe next grade and his parents are\ncalled in because he has this you know\nhe's about to have to probably redo the\n11th grade he's getting terrible grades\nhe's not showing up at school he's not\nhanging out the right kids all of that\nstuff and his mom forces him to go take\nthe sat because she's like i really want\nyou to get education i really want you\nto turn your life around and he's like\nit doesn't make any sense i'm stupid i\nfeel all of my tests i've never gotten\ngood grades i'm barely getting by and\ni'm not showing up to school because i\nknow how stupid i am she's like just go\nand take the sat so he goes and takes\nthe sat and for those of you guys that\nare in america s.a.t is just a test that\nyou have to take in order to get to\ncollege and he takes the sat this stupid\nkid quote unquote stupid kid\nfailing in school not showing up not\nhanging without the right people gets a\n1480 out of 1600 which is that's like\nthe top five percent he gets a\n80 out of 1600 he gets such a good grade\nto show him how smart he is his mom\nactually thought he cheated but he\ndidn't cheat and he realized he didn't\ncheat he knew he didn't cheat and he\nwent oh my god\ni'm actually smarter than i thought i\nwas what the hell have i been doing and\nso he looks at this and says i'm smarter\nthan i thought i was maybe i if i did so\nwell in the sats imagine what would\nhappen if i started studying so he\nstarts waking up earlier so that he can\nstudy he starts changing who he's\nhanging out with he starts showing up to\nschool more because he's like oh my gosh\nif i'm smart maybe i can actually do\nbetter and he changes his entire life\naround starts getting amazing grades\ngets into an ivy league school becomes a\nsuper successful entrepreneur\nright and here's the crazy thing about\nit every 12 years the sats what they do\nis they review all of their tests and\nthey go through them\nand when they went back through this\nguy's test he got something in the mail\nthat that said that he actually didn't\nget a 1480. what he got was a 740.\nwhat happened was the machine\naccidentally doubled his score so he got\na 740 out of 1600 which is not good\nbut he thought he got a 1480 but because\nof the fact that his little literally a\ncouple numbers on a piece of paper\nchanged his entire perception of who he\nthought he was he started showing up\ndifferently he started realizing that he\nwas smart he started taking you know\ntime to wake up earlier you change the\npeople that he was around he started\nstudying for his exams he started going\nto school and paying attention more and\ntaking all of the notes that he needed\nto his perception of himself changed\nbased off of seeing a few numbers on a\npiece of paper and what happened because\nhis perception of his self changed he\nchanged\nnow think about how powerful that is\nfor that person to change their life\ncompletely based off of literally four\nnumbers on a piece of paper think about\nall of the things in your life that\nyou've been basing your life off what\npeople have said about you what people\nhave done the things that you've done\nthe accomplishments that you have or\nhaven't had you can be\nliterally whoever you want to be if this\nkid is failing out of school and can get\ninto an ivy league school and become a\nsuccessful entrepreneur based off of\nfour numbers on a piece of paper you can\nbe literally whoever the you want to be\nso who do you want to be\nbecause this entire episode all i've\nbeen talking about how all of the things\nthat you think you are are complete bs\nso if that's the truth then who do you\nwant to be you can wake up every single\nday and decide who you want to be and i\ndon't mean i want to be somebody who's a\nmillionaire i want to be somebody who\nhas you know accomplished this i want to\nbe somebody who's driving a ferrari i\nwant to be someone who's got an amazing\nfamily i want to be an amazing parent\ni'm not talking about any of those\nthings those are all still external and\nthis is why it can be hard because we\nbase our literally our entire perception\nof everything based off external i want\nto turn it to internal who do you want\nto be before you walk out of your door\nget out of your bed who do you want to\nbe internally before any of those things\ncome up to you do you want to be kind do\nyou want to be loving do you want to be\nhumble do you want to be sweet do you\nwant to be generous who do you want to\nbe at every single moment of your life\nand how do you want to show up for other\npeople before the accomplishments before\npeople see before people decide who you\nare you decide who you want to be no one\nelse\nwhat you do is the same way that when\nyou get in your car and go to a place\nthat you've never been before you get\nyour phone out and you set your gps\nyou want to figure out how to go from\nwhere you are to where you want to be\nyou set your gps so if you wake up every\nsingle morning and you say who do i want\nto be today i want to be kind i want to\nbe loving i want to be sweet i want to\nbe generous i want to be giving i want\nto stop judging people i want to think\nthe best of people that i possibly can\nand you set your gps your mental gps\nyour internal gps for who you want to be\nit changes how you show up in the world\nand you realize that other people's\nperceptions of you have literally\nnothing to do with you but you've been\nbasing your entire life based off of\nyour accomplishments and other people's\nperception and when you're so firm into\nwho you truly are other people's\nperceptions mean nothing to you outside\ncircumstances mean nothing to you they\ndon't change you in any sort of way so\nwhat you need to do is you need to get a\npen and paper out and say who do i want\nto be\nyou decide who you want to be and then\nevery single morning you mentally set\nyour gps to become that person and see\nwhat happens in your life and how your\nlife starts to change the exact same way\nthat when that little boy got a piece of\npaper that said four numbers on it it\ncompletely changed the trajectory of his\nentire life imagine if you didn't get\nthat imagine if you got the real results\nwhere you could be the exact same thing\nis true for you what you see on that\npiece of paper of who you want to be how\nyou set your gps is going to change\nwhere your life goes from this moment\nforward\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well is\nthat not\nmind-blowing to anybody else and nobody\ntalks about how the is literally"
