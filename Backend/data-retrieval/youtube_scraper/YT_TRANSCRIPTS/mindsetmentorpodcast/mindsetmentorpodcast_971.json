    "transcript": "the graveyard's just full of hopes and\ndreams and desires and things that were\nnever created because people are just\nafraid\nof other people's opinions and\nrejections of them most fears today\nare not life-threatening my job is\nbasically to talk about fear with people\nand have them see how ridiculous their\nfears are\nsomething that holds so many people back\nsome people that are that are just\ncompletely terrified of this thing in\nthis thing\nthey're so terrified of it that it holds\nthem back from creating a life that they\nabsolutely love and also absolutely\ndesire and deserve more than anything\nelse and that is the fear of rejection\none of the things i hear the most\nwhenever i'm giving speeches or i'm on\nyou know zoom calls and i'm asking\npeople their biggest fear one of the\nbiggest fears that i hear almost every\nsingle time when the top two or three\nfears is the fear of rejection so if you\ncan overcome the fear of rejection in\nyour head\nyou can go and create what is it you\nwant to because in my opinion the\ngraveyard is full of hopes dreams\ndesires\nall of that from people who never fully\nstepped into who they wanted to be and\nwhat they wanted to do and the lives\nthey wanted to impact simply because\nthey were afraid of being rejected so if\nwe can figure out a way for you to get\npast that fear of rejection then you can\ncreate the life that you actually want\nto and it's sad to think that millions\nif not billions of people have died\nwithout doing what it is they truly want\nto do because they're just afraid of\nbeing rejected by other people\nisn't that crazy to think about if you\njust take a second and think that the\ngraveyard's just full of hopes and\ndreams and desires and things that were\nnever created because people are just\nafraid\nof other people's opinions and\nrejections of them\nso let's talk about that\nto get to the end of your life to be on\nyour deathbed and go man i wish i would\nhave brought more out of myself man i\nwish i would have done this i wish i\nwould have impacted more lives i wish i\nwould have written that book i wish i\nwould have played more music in front of\npeople and brought my music out to\npeople for them to see i wish i would\nhave painted more i wish i would have\nput my paintings on walls for people to\nsee\nand brought my creativity to the world\nthat's got to be the worst feeling in\nthe world to get to the end of your life\nand know that you didn't even scratch\nthe surface of your potential\nand a lot of that comes from the fear of\nrejection and so we're going to talk\nabout that now why does the fear of\nrejection exist now i'm going to tell\nyou that the fear of rejection is\nliterally built into us and it makes a\nlot of sense but it doesn't need to hold\nus back anymore why do we have the fear\nof rejection it's built into us it's\nbuilt into our genes we are tribal\nbeings which means if you go back uh you\nknow 500 000 years ago\nand you were to see all of your\nancestors all of our ancestors together\nthey had to stick together in tribes for\nsafety\nfor food for water for shelter for\neverything we had to if we were alive\n500 000 years ago we had to stay in the\ntribe\nif we happen to be kicked out of the\ntribe or rejected from the tribe\nthat's basically certain death you're\ngoing to die if you're not part of the\ntribe so of course we want to make sure\nthat we fit in\nof course we want to make sure that we\ndon't get kicked out of the\nquote-unquote tribe\nbut nowadays fitting in is one of the\nworst things that you could do\nthere's a quote that jim carrey has it\nsays uh\nyour your need to fit in will make you\ninvisible in this world\nif you think about everybody that you\nlook up to\nevery big actor or inventor or business\nperson or ceo or creator or scientist\nthey're always somebody who had to\nget out of the system out of the box\nthink differently act differently in\norder to create what they created so if\nthey're your biggest if you're if\nthey're the people that you look up to\nwhy would you want to not be like them\nwhy would you want to stay inside of a\nbox because you're afraid of the\nrejection\nnow you have to realize if you go and\nyou think about it if we're talking\nabout humans being tribal beings i'll\ngive you an idea of how ingrained in a\nsin actually is there was a terrible\nstudy let's start by saying this it was\nit was a terrible idea first off in 1944\nthere was a study where they took 40\nnewborns and they were just curious if\nhumans would be able to thrive\nwithout\nhuman contact without other human\ncontact right so they they were just\ncurious you know would humans be able to\nthrive or is it so necessary we're such\ntribal beings even contact with another\nhuman skin to skin is that something\nthat we need and so what they did in the\nstudy they took 40 newborns\nand the only times that they were only\ntouched was when they were\nhad the diapers changed when they fed\nthem and when they bathed them and they\nhad to cancel the study four months into\nit because half of the babies died in\nfour months\nit's a terrible study absolutely\nterrible but it shows you how ingrained\nin us that we actually have to be in\ncontact whether that's physical contact\nor close contact with other humans\nit shows you it's ingrained in us it's\npart of who we are so it makes sense\nthat we don't want to be rejected right\nit makes sense also they found that\nthere was a studies that were done and\nresearchers have found that being lonely\nis the equivalent and as lethal as\nhaving 15 cigarettes per day\nbeing lonely is the equivalent of having\nas lethal as 15 cigarettes per day\nlonely people are 50\nmore likely to die early and prematurely\nthan those who have healthy\nrelationships\nso when you think of it\nyes of course it makes sense that we're\nafraid of being rejected because being\naround other people\nfrom the moment that we're born\nis something that is super important it\nis something that is ingrained into our\nbodies and to have physical contact with\nother people is something that is\nnecessary in order for a child to to\nlive\nso\nif you think about it all of this makes\nsense\nbut we're not going to die\nnow from somebody rejecting us the same\nway that we would die\n500 000 years ago if we were rejected\nfrom the tribe\nso does it make sense that we don't want\nto be rejected abso freaking lutely it\nmakes sense but it doesn't have to be\nthe thing that holds you back from\nbringing out your potential from\nbringing your art to the world from\nbeing creative from stepping out from\ncreating the company that you want to\ncan we override the system inside of our\nhead to create what it is that we want\nto the answer is yes hell yes we\nabsolutely can and that's what we're\ngoing to talk about i'm going to teach\nyou the first thing we have to do is we\nhave to build the awareness of when we\nare being held back by the fear of\nrejection because a lot of times people\njust feel physical feelings of fear but\nthey don't ask themselves what am i\nfeeling why am i feeling this and they\nnever actually take themselves out of\nthe jar to read the label what does that\nmean you take yourself out of the out of\nyour head and say what is actually\nhappening here they just feel physical\nfeelings of fear they shut down\nversus going okay i feel fear what is\nthis fear that i'm feeling why is it\nthis way you know\nand then you you go through it and you\ngo you know i don't want to do this\nthing right\nbecause i'm afraid of being rejected\nlike i don't want to make this cold call\nif you're a salesperson you know this\nfeeling i don't want to make this cold\ncall because i'm afraid of being\nrejected i don't want to ask this person\nout because i'm afraid of being rejected\ni don't want to start this company\nbecause i'm afraid of other people's\nopinions and them rejecting me and\nmaking fun of me i don't want to\nmake this youtube account i don't want\nto start i don't want to put my videos\nup because i'm afraid of what could\npossibly happen i'm afraid of being\nrejected but then when you look at it so\nyou say number you look and you go okay\nso what's the worst that could actually\nhappen\nright because our brain immediately if\nyou don't pay attention to it will\nimmediately go to fear fear fear and\nfears attached to death which means you\nknow if you make a youtube video you're\nnot gonna die for making a youtube video\nunless you're one of those stupid people\nthat jumps off of buildings and you know\ndoes all the parkour on tops of\nbuildings you could die if you're making\nyoutube videos off of that one but if\nyou're making a youtube video about like\nyou know how to get better at yoga or\nmindset or\ncoaching or fitness or whatever it is\nyou're not going to die from creating\nthose videos right so\nyou ask yourself what's the worst that\ncould happen and you start to actually\nassess what the worst thing happened is\nokay if i'm making a cold call\nand i'm afraid of being rejected i'm\nafraid of this and i'm gonna go okay\nwhat's the worst that could happen in\nthis situation maybe the person like\nabsolute worst thing could happen in a\ncold call they scream at me they yell\nthey call me a pos and then they\nhang up the phone on me that's the worst\nthat can happen am i gonna die no\nwhat are the chances of that happening\nreally really small one of a thousand\nmaybe\nokay\nwell\nit seems like there's more upside\nthan downside so i might as well go\nahead and try it\nbecause what'd you do you took yourself\nout of the jar to read the label perfect\nokay let's go ahead and make the school\ncall maybe you're afraid of asking\nsomebody out like we said right what's\nthe what's the worst that could happen\nif you ask somebody out\nthey say\nno okay are you gonna die\nnope not gonna die\nbut\nthey could say yes and wouldn't that be\npretty awesome if they did say yes so it\nseems like once again the upside is\nbetter than the downside so should i do\nit hell yeah\ngo for it ask that person out\nokay what if i start this company what's\nthe worst that could happen\nit could fail and then i have to go get\na job\nokay\nwhat's the opposite of that it could be\nmassively successful i could create the\nlife that i want to for myself my family\nto be able to travel the world and have\nthe abundance that i want to\nonce again seems like the upside is\nbetter than the downside okay\nyoutube video what's the worst that\ncould happen well you could get some\nhater they exist\nwhat's the best that could happen people\ncould start watching it could go viral\nyou could impact millions of lives you\ncould start a business from youtube you\ncan make money doing it\nseems like once again the upside is\nalways better than the downside so\nshould i do it yes will you die\nfrom making a cold call asking somebody\nout starting a business or putting up a\nyoutube video absolutely not and that's\nwhat you need to bring to the forefront\nof your mind and tell yourself i'm not\ngoing to die there is much more upside\nthan there is downside so if i'm smart\ni'm a betting person i'm going to go\nokay there's if there's if i'm looking\nat a stock and i say this stock has\nway more upside than downside\nwell then i should probably invest in it\nright and that's usually how most things\nare we end up making\nmountains out of out of ant hills more\nthan anything else it's just like we\nmake things to be so much worse\nrejection is 100\nsafe you're not going to die from being\nrejected unless somebody rejects you you\nknow unless you ask somebody out on the\nedge of a mountain and they say no and\nthen they decide to push you off the\nedge of the mountain that's the only way\nthat it's not really safe rejection is\nsafe you won't die from someone hanging\nup on you and and yelling at you on a\ncold call you won't die from someone not\ngoing on a date with you you won't die\nfrom starting a company and you won't\ndie from creating a youtube video and\nsome haters saying that your stuff sucks\nyou won't it won't happen and so if you\ncan look at it from that standpoint and\ngo there's so much more upside than\ndownside i might as well do it and the\nreason why i have to do this is because\nyour brain is really sneaky if you\nhaven't noticed your subconscious is\nsuper sneaky it's very sneaky in keeping\nyou in your comfort zone right like it's\nit's good at keeping you in your comfort\nzone your brain automatically goes to\nrejection is bad bad i could starve if i\nstarve i die\nright like that's kind of the whole the\nwhole flow of what your brain actually\ngoes through but in reality none of that\nstuff's gonna actually happen right you\nget rejected not a big deal you'll live\nyou will live let me say that one more\ntime you will live you will not die and\nif you have gone through this process\nand you've realized okay i will not die\nthen what should i do take action\nnow will you still have feelings of fear\nwhile you're taking action\nyes will you still have feelings of fear\nbefore you take action yes but the good\nthing is you can kind of turn the dial\ndown on the fear because you know that\nyou're not going to die because\nultimately when we feel fear the thing\nabout fear that's really interesting is\nthat when you feel fear like the fear of\nrejection of somebody saying no to you\nit's a physical feeling you can feel it\ninside of your body it's the same\nphysical feeling that you have when you\nknow\nthat there's something that could\npossibly be approaching you you know\nit's i'll give you a perfect example\nhere's what it is it's the same physical\nfeeling as if you've ever been in the\nmiddle of the ocean and you think to\nyourself oh [ __ ] there could be a shark\naround here right that same physical\nfeeling is the same physical feeling\nthat you fear of like i don't i don't\nknow if i want to put this youtube video\nup like i put so much time into creating\nit but i don't want people to say that\nit sucks i don't want to find haters\nright it's the same feeling inside of\nyour body and if you're not paying\nattention if you're not intellectually\ndiving into your own head and creating\nawareness around it it's going to hold\nyou back but the beautiful thing is that\nif you're listening to this podcast\nepisode you want to change yourself and\none of the if not the very first step to\nchanging yourself is self-awareness so\nwhen you feel these feelings of fear\nthat's when you once again take yourself\nout of the jar you read the label and\nyou're like is this going to kill me\nabsolutely not i will live\nif the worst thing happens right now i\nwill live through it if i fail in a\nbusiness if this person rejects me if my\nyoutube video ends up sucking and people\nmake fun of it i will live because our\nbrain tends to make it so much worse\nthan it actually is so that we stay\ninside of our comfort zone because our\nbrain only cares about our survival\nthat's what it's designed to do it is a\nsurvival mechanism that's a beautiful\nthing but if you don't pay attention to\nit it will ruin your life and ruin your\npotential and everything that you could\ndo in this world and so you've got to\nbecome very self-worth and you're going\nto start to think about those\nand then\nwhen you take action\nand you realize you don't get the\nterrible result that you're originally\nfearing\nwhat does it do it builds confidence so\nif i'm going up and you know let's say i\ngo up and there's someone i go i want to\ngo ask them out let's use that as an\nexample i'm terrified\nsame physical feelings that i feel if\ni'm swimming in the middle of the ocean\ni start thinking oh my god there could\nbe a shark around here it's a physical\ndeath feeling it is because that's the\nonly feeling that your body can pull up\nfor fear right pulls it up\ni'm like all right am i going to die if\nshe says no i'm not all right let me go\nahead and i'm just gonna do it anyways\ni'm gonna approach her what's the worst\nthat could happen she could say no i\nwoke up to her maybe she's really nice\nmaybe she's super sweet maybe she\ndoesn't say yes but she says she has a\nboyfriend\nokay well\nthat at least gives me a little bit of\nconfidence because number one i stepped\nout of my comfort zone number two she\nwasn't you know to me\nnumber three she was really nice\nnumber four\nthere's other fish in the sea okay what\ndoes that do that builds a little bit of\nconfidence let's go to the youtube video\nlet's say that i post up a youtube video\nwhat's really interesting about haters\nis you'll get haters every once in a\nwhile i mean i have\nlike 1.5 to 2 billion views online i\ndon't know how many it is with somewhere\nin that number right\nfor every hater you have a like 150\npeople who are super nice super\nsupportive and super sweet but for some\nreason you always focus on the haters\nlike that's just the way that it goes\nright\nbut if i put up a video and i have a\nhater\ni can look at that hater and i could go\nokay that's that's one person who hated\nmy stuff\nand they're just projecting the hate\nthat they feel for themselves on top of\nme and if i can be aware of that then i\ncan go well look there's one hater and\n150 people who loved my stuff\nand if 150 people even if there's just\nfive people that loved your stuff with\none hater you still impacted five\npeople's five times more people's lives\nthan the people who were the haters and\nso what happens is when you put yourself\nout there and you feel the fear but do\nit anyways and you put yourself out\nthere and do what you want to do and\nwhat needs to be done\nand you get a little bit of a result\nthat you want to it starts to build your\nconfidence to do it again but you can't\nbuild your confidence unless you step\noff of the ledge then just do it anyways\nand so what you have to realize people\nare always like oh i wish i was more\nconfident i wish i was confident like\nyou i wish i was better public speaker\nconfidence isn't something that people\nare born with i say it all the time\nconfidence is something that you get\nfrom results and the only way that you\nget results is by taking action so the\nonly way to take action is if you're\nfeeling fear to do it anyways and that's\nthe way that you have to do it so you're\nnot going to die from rejection which is\na beautiful thing\nbut\nwhen you feel the feelings of fear you\nfeel the feelings of fear of rejection\nyou have to take yourself out of that\nfeeling and go okay i'm not going to die\nthere's a lot more upside than there is\ndownside and\nyou know this is something i truly want\nto do\nand if you do that and you put it out\nthere whatever it is that you want to\nput out there\nyou put that thing out there and get a\nlittle bit of a good result you start\nfeeling better about yourself you get a\nlittle bit of confidence and confidence\nor like confidence is like like stacking\nblocks\non top of each other and your confidence\ngrows and it grows and it grows and it\ngrows but your confidence cannot grow\nunless you put yourself out there so you\nwill feel the feeling fear\njesus\nyou will feel the feelings of\nrejection and fear inside of your body\nyou will fear other people's opinions\nbut don't let that hold you back from\ndoing what it is that you truly want to\ndo because the worst thing that could\nhappen is that you join all the people\nin the graveyard with hopes dreams and\ndesires that didn't come out of you and\npotential that wasn't seen in your\nlifetime\nthe issue with fear is that fears are\nholding you back from creating the life\nthat you want at its simplest form\nthat's really what it is so fears are\none of the worst things in the entire\nworld because they're holding you back\nfrom the life that you truly truly want\nand so learning how to work with your\nfears\nis probably one of the biggest skills\nthat you can learn and it is an actual\nskill and you'll realize why that is as\ni start to dive in and most people they\nnever learn how to get past their fears\nthey never do get past their fears and\nthen i would assume a lot of people get\nto their lives and like damn i wish i\ncould have done more i wish i could have\nimpacted more people's lives i wish i\ncould have done more in the world i wish\ni would have created the art that i\nwanted to but i was too afraid to i wish\nthat i would have spoken up more about\nwhat i truly believed in but i was too\nafraid to\nso in this episode we're going to talk\nabout how to get past your fear so that\nit doesn't hold you back anymore so that\nyou can ultimately go out stop being\nafraid and create the life that you\ntruly want to because most people i\ndon't want to say most i guess most\npeople probably will do almost anything\nto avoid their fears almost anything\nto the point where they'll live a life\nthat they don't truly want\nevery waking moment of their life they\nhave the opportunity to go out and do\nsomething great whatever greatness looks\nlike to you and so most people will try\nto avoid fear\nand people have this this preconceived\nnotion that successful people have no\nfear or they're fearless we always say\noh this is a fearless leader no and i've\nsaid this before many times in the\npodcast\nthis is the truth is it successful\npeople fear as much as people who are\nquote unquote unsuccessful but the\ndifference is successful people don't\nlisten to their fear and they go and do\nit anyways that's the truth of the\nmatter in\nthe the fact of the matter is that most\nfears today\nare not life-threatening\nnow when you understand what fears are\nused for and why they actually make\nsense you kind of respect them a little\nbit more but there's only two fears that\na human is born with that's it number\none is the fear of falling\nnumber two is the fear of loud noises\nthe fear of falling in the fear of loud\nnoises everything else this is very\nimportant listen to this everything else\nis absolutely learned\nfrom our upbringing whether that's our\nparents whether that's society brothers\nsisters people that we know every other\nfear besides the fear of falling and the\nfear of loud noises are learned by a\nhuman\nand fears aren't real because ultimately\nas you may have heard it's like an\nacronym false expectations appearing\nreal how often and i would guess you\nknow probably pretty often have you\nfeared something that never even\nactually happened have you worried so\nmuch about something that could possibly\nhappen in the future and it never\nhappened how often does that happen\nwell in case you're curious there was a\nstudy that was done on this and found\nout that 85\nof what humans fear and worry about\nnever even actually happens\nso 85 of the stuff that's holding you\nback from the dreams that you truly want\nwill never happen that's crazy if you\nactually start to think about it\nand why i say that they're not\nlife-threatening is this is because\nthe the ultimate thing that you have to\nrealize about the brain\nis that fear is put into us for our\nsurvival and i'll talk about that a\nlittle bit more in just a few minutes\nbut fear is the signal that we're about\nto get out of our comfort zone we're\nabout to leave\nsafety we're about to get out of our\ncomfort zone and that potential death\ncould be coming now you know that if you\ngo and ask your boss for a raise and you\nfeel that feelings of fear he's not\ngoing to kill you right i hope not girls\nyou probably need to get a new boss but\nultimately you know that's not going to\nhappen but the feelings that you feel of\nfear are the same types of feelings as\nif you're walking in the middle of the\nnight and you hear sounds in a bush it's\nthe same physical feelings of fear\ninside of your body\nso fear is telling you that you're\ngetting out of your comfort zone here's\nthe really important thing to realize\nthough getting out of your comfort zone\nyou know if you're listening this or if\nyou're watching this you know that\nfeeling like getting out of your comfort\nzone and getting out of your comfort\nzone is ultimately a good thing you need\nto get out of your comfort zone you know\nthat\nso if you feel fear\nand fear\nis the\nthe thing that's telling you you're\nabout to get out of your comfort zone\nthat means that that feeling is not bad\nthat feeling is actually good\nso if you can switch your brain around\nto realize this feeling is good that i'm\nfeeling i should lean into this\nyour life will be completely different\nbecause ultimately you have two choices\nwhen you feel fear number one you can\ngive in\nand you could just give in to the fear\nor number two you can lean into the fear\nand go you know what okay\nnow if i think about it my brain is\ntelling me right now it's sending the\nsignals of i'm about to get out of my\ncomfort zone i know that this thing that\ni'm about to do is not going to kill me\nthat's a fact\nand so if i think about it i should\nactually know that these feelings are\ngood because it's telling me that growth\nis on the other side it's telling me\nthat i'm about to get out of my comfort\nzone because ultimately i know getting\nout of my comfort zone is a really good\nthing\nand where your fear comes from is a\nlittle tiny part of your brain in the\nback of your back of your brain it's\ncalled the amygdala and they call it the\nreptilian part of your brain and uh it\ngenerates fear in order for you to get\naway from danger which is incredible so\nit's an incredible tool because it kept\nour species alive for two million years\nbut\nyou have to realize there's no potential\ndeath for most of the people that are\nlistening this you don't have potential\ndeath when you're walking outside every\nsingle day right so when the amygdala\nwas\nfirst around and we were you know a\nmillion two million years ago all of\nthat\nyou have to realize if we heard a\nrustling in the bush the amygdala would\nclick on and say hey there's something\nto fear there\nokay do something different we need to\nget out of this place we need to run\nfight or flight whatever it is that we\nneed to do\nnow you're not going to leave your house\nand be attacked by a lion\nso\nyou still have those physical feelings\nthough that part of your brain still\nexists which means\nit's going to be used at some point it's\ngoing to click on so even though our\nexternal world has changed\nvastly even just in the last 100 years\nwe're still working with the exact same\nhardware that we've had for hundreds of\nthousands if not millions of years\nand so we're working with the same\nhardware that kept our species alive\nthat kept us away from lions and kept us\nyou know from everything that we needed\nto fear because it meant potential death\nbut now if you're gonna go ask your boss\nfor a raise you're not going to die and\nyou know that but that part of your\nbrain still exists so it generates fear\nto get you away from danger potential\ndanger aka getting outside of your\ncomfort zone now in modern day the\ndifference is it doesn't know the\ndifference between a good fear and a bad\nfear and yes i said that correctly a\ngood fear\nbecause most people listeners probably\nthink that all fears are bad no there's\nbad fears which is potential death on\nthe other side of that fear someone\ncomes at you with a knife there's going\nto be a fear mechanism that's clicked on\nto get you to go to your fight or flight\nto either run or to attack that person\nto make sure you don't get stabbed right\nfend for yourself whatever it is you\nneed to do that's a bad fear a good fear\nis like i said\nfeeling it\nand not giving in but leaning in going\nokay i know what my body's doing i know\nwhy it's doing this but i'm not going to\ndie so i need to lean in because it's\nactually telling me rob you should lean\ninto this because this is outside of\nyour comfort zone and i know outside of\nmy comfort zone is where i grow in\neverything that i want is outside of it\nso it's it's incredible if you actually\nstart to realize that this is how you\ncan use it when you understand it you\ncan use it and when you can use it you\ncan change your life and so it doesn't\nknow the difference between good or bad\nfears or good or bad risks it just wants\nto avoid all of them\nthat's it\nbut you\ncan consciously think is this something\ni should be incredibly afraid of or is\nthis something just telling me that i'm\nabout to step out of my comfort zone and\ni need to lean in so you know the\namygdala amazing for for fear and it's\namazing for avoiding danger but it's\nterrible if you want to grow a business\nor if you want to ask somebody out or if\nyou want to ask for a raise if you want\nto create content on the internet and\nput it out there and be judged by\neverybody or make a shift in the world\nor stand on stage and speak publicly to\nimpact people it's not good for that but\nit's really really good for avoiding\ndeath and danger\nso\nit's like will smith said will smith\nsaid fear is not real the only place\nthat fear can exist is in our thoughts\nof the future it's a product of our\nimagination causing us to fear things\nthat are not present and may never exist\nthat fear that is near insanity do not\nmisunderstand me danger is very real but\nfear is a choice\nfear is a choice you can't remove the\namygdala it's in your head so you got to\nfigure out a way to work with it\nyou got to figure out that's just the\nway it goes and that's why i love\nteaching you about the brain that's why\ni'm writing a book about the brain\nthat's why i have a course coming out\nabout the brain is because i just love\nthe brain because if you can understand\nthe hardware that we're given then you\ncan understand why it's there and how it\nworks you can then use your brain to\nyour advantage to then create the life\nthat you want to\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nso we need to feel the fear that's a\ngood thing\nbut we can't let it stop us we've got to\nlet us we've got to lean in and continue\nmoving forward and so you really have to\nto start thinking about and breaking\ndown your fears and thinking about them\ni remember that\nlong time ago i used to run a company\nand i have you know hundreds of sales\nreps under me i had a few thousand that\ni trained uh and this was when i was\nyounger so it was about 15 years ago and\nthey used to be really afraid my sales\nreps were really afraid of making cold\ncalls and so what they it would happen\nall the time and so i'd have to make\ntheir fears silly and so i would sit\ndown with them and i would say okay so\ntell me what's going on oh i'm just\nafraid to make phone calls okay what are\nyou afraid of i'm just afraid it's it's\nit's just the the fear is coming up\nevery time i pick up the phone okay so\nare you afraid of the phone\nyeah i guess i am kind of afraid of the\nphone and so i would go okay hey do me a\nfavor go ahead and pick up your phone\nreal quick and they'd go and they pick\nup their phone i said they say here it\nis and i say okay\ni want you to look at your phone look at\nyour phone i say okay i want you to look\nat that phone and say\ni am afraid of you and they go wait what\ni s you know i want you to look at your\nphone and i want you to say i am afraid\nof you\nand they're like why i'm like just do it\nand they're like i\nam afraid of you i'm like do it again i\nam afraid of you i'm like do it again i\nam afraid of you okay do it in a deeper\nvoice i am afraid of you okay do it in a\nhigher voice i am afraid of you and what\ni'm trying eventually i started laughing\nand what i tried to make them do is try\nto take their fear that really was a\nridiculous fear of just pushing buttons\nthat's all that it was a fear of just\npushing buttons and talking to another\nhuman on their side phone taking that\nfear and making it ridiculous and seem\nridiculous because if you can make it\nseem ridiculous to the brain the brain\ncan release it and go oh\nthere's no death on the other side of\nthis phone this customer's not going to\ncome through with a knife and and stab\nme so you got to kind of make it make it\na little bit silly because it's either\nscary which you can allow it to be or\nyou can go this is ridiculous this fear\nmakes no sense this is silly and that's\nhow you start to get past it so\nthe good thing is luckily we're the ones\nthat make our fears up we're the ones\nthat are afraid of the phone calls we're\nafraid of you know going up and talking\nto that person because of what they\nmight say we're afraid of being on stage\nbecause ultimately we're afraid of\nmessing up and people making fun of us\nor whatever it is so we make our fears\nup so\nthe difference is we have to figure out\na way if we're thinking of those fears\nwe've got to think differently about the\nfears that pop up in when we feel the\nfear it's a good thing once again i'm\ngoing to say it a million times this\npodcast episode\nlean in\nlean in lean in you have to push past\nthe point of comfort because ultimately\nthat's where the change happens\nso how do you remove the fear from your\nbody you can't but i'm going to go ahead\nright now and give you a few tips to\nhelp you work with the fear to make it a\nwhole lot better so the first one\nis you got to change your mindset around\nfear you've got to change your mindset\naround fear\nhow do you change your mindset around\nfear well\nyou know the the phone example is a\nperfect example you make it silly so\nthat it's you're like oh that's\nridiculous why do i need to hold on to\nit or you have to show your brain\nwhy it's wrong or why it's ridiculous\nand the best way to do this is to take\npen to paper not to type it out on your\ncomputer not to type it on your phone\nbut take pen to paper and write it out\nand to ask yourself some questions so\nyou write them down and you ask yourself\nwhat am i afraid of you write that\nquestion down and you answer that\nquestion what am i afraid of and you\nwrite it down and then you look at it\nand you say it out loud here's the\ninteresting thing the reason why you\nwant to say it out loud because not only\nare you saying it but then also what's\nhappening is you're hearing it and so\nhave you ever thought something before\nand then you say it out loud you're like\noh my god that was ridiculous have you\never feared something and you say it out\nloud and you realize with saying it it\nalmost turns ridiculous right away and\nyou're like oh my gosh why am i fearing\nthat well that's what we're trying to do\nright here we're trying to actually make\nthis ridiculous so you can say it out\nloud to yourself you should say it out\nloud to yourself so you write it down\nwhat am i afraid of and then you say i\nam afraid\nof getting up in front of people and\nspeaking because i'm afraid i'm a mess\nup\nand then you just say it out loud to\nyourself okay\nthe next question you want to ask\nyourself is what good\ncan come\nfrom doing xyz whatever it is let's say\nit's the fear of public speaking what\ngood can come up\nfrom me going up on stage and speaking\nin front of people and then you answer\nit what good can come from it i'm trying\nto find more positives in the speaking\nthan the negatives i'm trying to make my\nbrain weigh out the options and go oh\ni'm not going to die by hopping on stage\nand i could possibly help this person\nthat person this person that person and\nthen your brain starts to go all right\nmaybe i should let go of this and let\nrob hop on stage so what good can come\nfrom this\nnext question\nwhy should i not\nbe afraid of this why should i not be\nafraid of getting on stage and speaking\nin front of people well because i\nultimately do want to do some more\npublic speaking i know that you can\nreally impact people from stage it is\nsomething that i'm passionate about i\nlove watching public speakers and if i\nlove watching them i'd love to be one\nand you could go on and on and on and on\nso you know what good can come from this\nin why should i not be afraid of this\nanother reason why you shouldn't be\nafraid is because people aren't going to\nmake fun of you they're going to\nunderstand everybody's afraid of public\nspeaking so if you're afraid of people\nmaking fun of you they're not going to\nbe making fun of you they're going to\nunderstand if you do happen to mess up\nokay\nand then the next question\nis what action do i need to take right\nnow\nthis is the the last question what\naction do i need to take right now and\nyou answer okay what i need to do is i\nneed to plan out my talk even better and\ni need to practice and practice and\npractice because practice makes perfect\nso if i practice more i'll be more\nconfident and i'll probably deliver a\nbetter speech if i'm not fumbling around\nand i'm not you know looking through the\npapers and trying to figure out what i'm\nsupposed to say i'll present more\nconfidently if i have all of this\nmemorized right why do you want to take\naction here's the reason why is because\nwe\nultimately have programmed into us when\nwe feel fear to basically lock up\nto not do whatever it is to give in to\nthat fear you know it's the same way\nwhere if you know you hear rustling in\nthe bush you're gonna run or sometimes\nyou're just gonna lock up and you're\ngonna stare and sit there for a second\nyou're gonna look around and see if you\ncan see any lions right so a lot of\ntimes what we've we've trained ourselves\nto do over 20 30 40 years 50 years of\nyour life is that when you feel fear you\ngive in when you feel fear you give in\nwhen you feel fear you give in\nright now you've got to retrain yourself\nteach an old dog new tricks now you've\ngot to train yourself when you feel the\nfear you've got to take action\nyou feel the fear you take action feel\nfree to take action if you do this long\nenough and you're conscious enough doing\nthis if you continue to keep doing it\nover and over and over again fears won't\nhold you back anymore you've ultimately\nused classical conditioning on accident\nto yourself and if you want to know what\nclassical conditioning is you can look\nit up but you've used classical\nconditioning on yourself\non accident for when you feel fear to be\nparalyzed by it\nthat's what you've trained yourself the\nsame way you train a dog you've trained\nyourself\nto not take action when you feel fear\nwhy do you think it's so damn hard to\nnot take action now because you feel the\nfear and you lock up you've trained\nyourself to do that same way that you\ntrain a dog sit you say sit and they sit\nbecause they get used to it it's just an\naction they get used to so now you've\ngot to retrain yourself to when you feel\nfear\nyou got to take action you got to go and\nthen what you say is for each one of\nthose you say them out loud because\nthere's power in writing it down there's\npower in saying it and then there's\npower in hearing it because you're\ntrying to program these things into your\nsubconscious you're trying to get your\nbrain to realize that your fear is\nridiculous and it needs to release it\nbecause your brain wants to conserve as\nmuch energy as possible if it doesn't\nneed to worry about whatever this thing\nis it'll let go of it okay\nwhat's the next thing that we need to do\nin order to get rid of our fears we need\nto make our goals or the things that\nwe're going for a little bit more bite\nsize so instead of saying hey i want to\nmake a hundred thousand dollars this\nyear if you've never made a hundred\nthousand dollars what you can do is you\ncan take that number and break it down\nand say i wanna make eight thousand\nthree hundred thirty three dollars this\nmonth\nright\nthat number seems much more digestible\nthan the entire hundred thousand dollars\nand so you take your numbers then your\ngoals and chop them into bite-sized\npieces have little check marks along the\nway because the bigger that something\nfeels to you\nthe less likely you are to take action\nif you can chop it up into smaller sizes\nyou're more likely to take action which\nmeans you're more likely to do what you\nneed to do which means you're more\nlikely to hit your goal and then when\nyou do 8 33\nin a month you're like i can do this\nagain and it gets you excited then you\ndo it\nit's just important to make sure that\nyou chop them up so that they don't seem\nas large as they are and then the last\nthing is this learn to dance with your\nfear\nthat's what i always say dance with your\nfear you're going to feel it once again\nas i said in the beginning successful\npeople and unsuccessful people all feel\nfear the difference is what they do when\nthey feel it\nif you train yourself long enough you'll\nrealize that people that don't take\naction have trained themselves not to\ntake action they've trained themselves\nyou've trained yourself not to take\naction when you feel fear but if you can\nuse these steps if you can write them\ndown if you can become self-aware and\nnext time you feel the fear go what am i\nfeeling okay\ni'm a little terrified right now okay\nwhy is that what am i afraid of right\nnow because ultimately when when you're\njust thinking things\nwhen things are in your brain it's very\nabstract when it's in your head it's\nsuper abstract when you write it down on\na piece of paper you can get very clear\non what things are going on and so you\ncan feel it what am i feeling right now\nokay i'm feeling fear\nokay what should i do okay i'm gonna go\nahead and write down what am i fearing\nyou start to write it down you look at\nit and you go\nthat's not as bad as i thought it was\ngonna be\nit's not that bad i think i can deal\nwith this i think i can work through\nthis and then ultimately what do you do\nthen you take time go through this whole\nprocess you say what action do i need to\ntake right now\nwhat action you need to take right now\nwhatever it is take that action because\nyou've trained yourself not to take\naction\ntrain yourself to take action\nbecause fear is a good thing\nyou'll never conquer fear you'll never\novercome fear\nbut what you will do is you'll learn how\nto dance with the fear\nyou'll feel it you'll understand it\nyou'll know why it's there and you can\neither give in or you can lean in what\nyou want to do is lean into that fear\nbecause it's showing you that you're\nabout to step out of your comfort zone\nand you know that everything that you\nwant is on the outside of that comfort\nzone the things that are holding you\nback from this amazing beautiful\nincredible life that you want are\ncomplete\nbs\nthat's what we're going to be talking\nabout today and you might be listening\nto me and you're like that doesn't make\nany sense of course they're real no\nthey're not the only thing that's\nholding you back\nfrom the life that you want the money\nthat you want the family that you want\nthe happiness that you want the joy that\nyou want the peace the love the success\nthe traveling the abundance the\nlack of stress the environment that you\nwant every single little thing that you\nwant in your life the only thing that's\nholding you back from that is your fear\nof\nsomething that's it and we're gonna be\ndiving into those today and what i want\nyou to think about i want you to ask\nyourself\nis what is your biggest fear think about\nthat for a second i don't mean fear of\nlike spiders or fear of heights what is\nyour number one fear that's holding you\nback from creating the life that you\nwant i want you to think about that in\nyour mind real quick what is it\ndo you have it\ndo you know what it is\nnow i have once you realize this i\nmy job is basically to talk about fear\nwith people and have them see how\nridiculous their fears are so i'm going\nto take a guess that i probably know 95\npercent of you that are listening to\nthis what your fear is\nhere's the ones that i hear the most\noften the fear of rejection\nthe fear of failure the fear of success\nthe fear of running out of money the\nfear of being a terrible parent the fear\nof your spouse leaving you the fear of\nnot living up to your parents\nexpectations a fear of being unlovable\nwhatever it is there's so many different\nfears that are out there but i just\nprobably covered about 95 of the people\nlistening right now by saying those\nout of all of those things i'm going to\nask you this question\nhow many of those can kill you\nhave you ever thought about that before\nhow many of those fears will cause you\nto stop breathing will cause your heart\nto stop beating how many of them\ni know the answer to it the answer is\nzero\nit's zero i got about 95 percent of the\npeople who are listening to this in the\nactual fears that are holding you back\ncannot kill you because the fact is\nwe're actually born with only two fears\nthe fear of loud noises and the fear of\nfalling those two are actually born into\nhumans every other fear outside the fear\nof loud noises in the fear of rejection\nis learned yes you heard me correctly\nthe fear that's holding you back from\nthe life that you want from everything\nthat you truly want in your life\nis learned you either learn it from your\nparents you learn it from your brother\nand sister aunt uncle family society\nadvertisements you're learning your\nfears from you've learned your fears\nlike how crazy just just let that sink\nin for a second you have learned\nto fear that thing that is holding you\nback which means that it's actually not\nreal now i know some of you out there\nlike but rob it is real like the fear of\nthat that's inside of me i physically\nfeel that fear yes you can physically\nfeel it because your thoughts create\nemotions inside of your body your\nthoughts happen they send a chemical\nmessenger called a neuropeptide from\nyour brain down to your body which then\ncreates hormones and actual feelings\ninside of your body so you can feel the\nfeelings of fear\nbut they don't exist they're not real\nso you've learned the fear of rejection\nyou've learned the fear of failure\nyou've learned the fear of success\nyou've learned the fear of running out\nof money you've learned the fear of your\nspouse leaving you you've learned the\nfear of being a bad parent you've\nlearned the fear of not living up to\nyour parents expectations you've learned\nthe fear of being unlovable\nyou have learned those fears none of\nthem are actually real\nthey're not real they don't exist you\ncan't physically hold them in the world\nright and really what it boils down to\nis this it's a thing that one of my\nfriends and i came up with and it's\nprimal fears versus intellectual fears\nand let me explain the situation if you\nlisten to my podcast a couple weeks ago\ni actually talked about this friend of\nmine who went and actually lived with a\nnative brazilian tribe in the middle of\nabsolute nowhere in brazil like\nliterally lived inside of a teepee slept\nwith a machete next to him because\njaguars were known to roam in in the\nmiddle of the night and hunted anacondas\nfor them to be able to live i'm talking\nabout like native brazilian tribes like\nthey are native people they don't have\nroads they don't have cars any of those\nthings\nand one of the things that he said to me\nthat was super super interesting\nhe was talking about how when he walked\naround in the forest he always had to\nhave a machete with him because you\nnever know when a jaguar would run up on\nyou you just never knew and that was\nalways prominent in his mind like he's\nwalking through the forest he's got to\nhave some form of protection on him at\nall times to make sure that he doesn't\nget attacked by something because one\nthing that he said that was really\ninteresting is he said if you see a\njaguar\nyou're pretty much done and the reason\nwhy is because it's not them just seeing\nyou they've been seeing you for a long\ntime if you're just now seeing that\nthey've been watching you they've been\nstalking you if you can visually see a\njaguar\nthey've been looking at you for a while\nand what he said to me that was really\ninteresting is he goes it really makes\nyou understand the primal fears that we\ndon't feel anymore in society we don't\nhave to worry about you know an animal\ncoming out and attacking us most of us\nthat are listening to this podcast you\nknow i can see all the places this is\ndownloaded like 190\n190 different countries listen to this\npodcast\nin the majority of people who are\nlistening to this you don't have to\nworry about an animal coming out and\nattacking you i don't have to worry\nabout walking down the street here in\naustin texas and an animal coming out\nand attacking me\ni don't really have to worry about\nrunning out of food like even if i\nlost all of my money\nand i was homeless i would still be able\nto figure out a way to get food right so\nthat's also not really something that i\nhave to worry about those are primal\nfears primal fears\nmeans that there is death attached to it\nso if you can attach death to something\nit's a primal fear\nand of course that makes sense we should\nbe afraid of things that could possibly\nkill us\nbecause our brain\nis designed to keep us alive and so we\nshould have a mechanism that creates\nfear inside of our bodies inside of our\nbrains to make us avoid anything that\ncould have possible death attached to it\ncompletely makes sense\nmakes sense i get it\nthat's a primal fear something that has\ndeath attached to it\nall of the other fears that don't have\ndeath attached to it we call\nintellectual fears they're fears of the\nmind\nall of the fears that you have\nthat are holding you back from this life\nthat you want are all fears of the mind\nthere's no death attached to them\nthere's no death attached to the fear of\nrejection\nif you get rejected by somebody whatever\nit is\nyou're not going to die it's not going\nto happen\nyou know if somebody gives you their\nopinion they don't think something great\nof you and that's a fear you know if\nsally in accounting rejects you or\ndoesn't like what you do or you know\ntalks trash about you you're not going\nto die from that\nif you fail at running this business\nthat you want to you know start if you\nwere to possibly fail at it would you\ndie\nno i mean would you have less money\nmaybe but would you actually cease to\nbreathe\nno\nso that's an intellectual fear how about\nthe fear of success if you were to\nbecome successful would you die\nno if you were to lose everything\nyou know if you were to become\nsuccessful then lose everything would\nyou die\nno\nif you were to\nyou know\nraise your children not perfectly\nbecause one of the things i hear from\nparents the most is that i'm so terrible\ni'm so afraid that i'm going to raise my\nchildren in you know they're not going\nto be what i want them to be if you\naren't the best parent in the world\nbecause obviously you're trying to get\nbetter are you going to die\nno\nif you are you know would bring up\nanother fear if you are have the fear of\nbeing unlovable if you're unlovable are\nyou going to die no it's not going to be\nawesome if you're not in lovable if\nyou're unlovable but it's you're not\ngoing to die from it if you don't live\nup to your parents expectations are you\ngoing to die no if your spouse leaves\nyou are you going to die no all of these\nthings i understand listen i don't want\nto say that i don't understand\nnot wanting them to happen i understand\ni wouldn't want to be rejected i\nwouldn't want to fail i wouldn't want to\nyou know run out of money or be a\nterrible parent or my spouse to leave me\nor be unlovable or you know not live up\nto my mom's expectations of course i\nunderstand the fact of not wanting these\nthings to happen but you can't justify\nfearing them because they're not\nsomething to fear because they will not\nkill you\nso what you really have to do is you\nreally have to take a step back when\nyou're starting to feel the feelings of\nfear and to start to self-assess one of\nthe things that i always say is that if\ni could give everybody in the world a\nsuperpower it would be extreme\nself-awareness for people to take\nthemselves out of their current\ncircumstances look at themselves as if\nthey're looking at somebody else and\nactually self-assess what's going on\nright there hey if you're enjoying this\nvideo do me a favor and hit that like\nbutton down below it helps with the\nyoutube algorithm so that more people\ncan see this message because it helps us\nget it out organically so hit that like\nbutton and i appreciate you\nyou sit there and you go okay\nall right i'm feeling fear i'm feeling\nfear right now\nam i going to die i'm not okay so is it\na primal fear no it's not a primal fear\nit's an intellectual fear how do i know\nonce again a primal fear is where death\nis possibly attached to it i could\nactually die\nlike\ncease to breathe i could completely stop\nbreathing\nan intellectual fear your ego\nor your embarrassment\nisn't attached to it\nso if you get rejected you're not going\nto die but your ego might hurt you might\nget embarrassed\nif you fail at something you're not\ngoing to die but your ego might hurt you\nmight be embarrassed about it and so on\nand so forth and so what you do\nis you have to prove to your brain how\nridiculous this fear actually is so that\nit starts to release it because at this\npoint if you don't\nreally start to self-assess it feels in\nyour body the same as if you're about to\nbe attacked by a lion like you can\nphysically feel\ninside of your body fear you can and\nit's the same physical feeling that\nyou're feeling if your life is you know\npossibly on the line but you have to\nprove to your brain that the thing that\nyou're feeling is really not something\nthat should be feared at this point not\nsomething that's going to hold you back\nnot something there's going to be a\ndeath attached to it and so in a way you\nalmost have to prove to your brain how\nridiculous your fear is so when you're\nfeeling these feelings you've got to\nself-assess think about the fear and\nthen you've got to prove to yourself how\nridiculous holding on to this fear\nactually is\nso how do you do it all right let's go\nahead and walk you through exactly how\nto do it and so um\nthe first thing that i like to do is i\nlike to prove to my brain how ridiculous\nthe fear is and i don't even call it a\nfear\ni refuse to call an intellectual fear an\nactual fear right a primal fear yes i\ncan call that a fear but an intellectual\nfear i don't call a fear i made up a\nword that i like to call it because i\nlike to make myself realize how dumb it\nis and i'm trying to\ndiminish\nthe\nseverity of these fears quote-unquote\nfears in my brain and i call them\nscaries\nscaries\nbecause it doesn't sound scary when you\ncall something is scary so it's like oh\nyou know i've got this scary inside of\nmy head that i might be rejected by\nsally in accounting because she doesn't\nlike the work that i do oh i've got this\nscary that i you know i've got this\nscary that possibly my my wife could\nleave me i've got this scary that i'm\ngoing to fail at my business i've got\nthis scary that i might fail at this\nother thing i've got this scary that i i\nmight become successful and i've never\nbeen successful i don't know what that\nfeels like i've got these scaries like\nthat's the way that i think of it in my\nhead of like it's so\nit's so ridiculous to hold on to these\nthings because you can do something to\nmake these things better you can make\nsure you don't fail you can make sure\nyou don't get rejected you can make sure\nthat your spouse doesn't leave you can\nmake sure that you are an incredible\nparent you can make sure of all of these\nthings so they're not fears because when\nyou say fear it's like\ni could die that's what fear means in my\nhead\nscaries are\njust a little bit scared like that's the\nway that i feel scaries are and that's\nwhat i try to make them feel in my brain\nof like these are not on the same level\nthis primal fear is not on the same\nlevel as these intellectual fears these\nintellectual fears are so much smaller\nthere's so much diminished and i'm not\ngoing to allow these things to hold me\nback from the life that i want because\nhow ridiculous would it be if i didn't\nlive the life that i want because i was\nworried about sally and accounting's\nopinion of me how ridiculous is that if\nyou actually think about it and so\nthat's what i'm trying to do i'm trying\nto actually diminish it in my brain so\nthat i can see how dumb it is to\nactually hold on to it because it's\nholding me back from the frickin life\nthat i want and i only get one of these\nlives so why would i let sally's opinion\nof me or the fear of rejection the fear\nof failure the fear of success whatever\nthe fear is hold me back from doing the\nthing that i truly want to do\nright and so what i'm going to do is i'm\ngoing to self-assess figure out what\nthis thing is and i'm going to freaking\nget past it because it's not going to\nhold me back anymore so then i ask\nmyself these questions number one\nis this a primal fear or is this an\nintellectual scary\nis this a primal fear that i'm feeling\nin my body or is this an intellectual\nscary\nthink about that for a second which one\nis it\nokay and this is the self-assessment i\nwant you to go on and you can do it\nright now and you can do it anytime that\nyou start to feel fear\nand you write it down is this an\nintellectual fear or is this a primal\nscary\nright which one is it for you\nnumber two\nam i going to die\nam i going to die\nthis will really help you figure out\nwhich one it is am i going to die\nno i'm not\nokay cool i got that and then number\nthree\nand here's the key\nthe key is to shift your focus because\nyou're focusing on
