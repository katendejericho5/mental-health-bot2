    "transcript": "there is always good that's waiting for\nyou down the line the question is are\nyou waiting to receive it\nwere you sitting there with your hands\nout waiting for something bad to happen\nto you\nand today we're going to talk about how\nto stop\nworrying and stop thinking that\nsomething bad is going to happen to you\nand this came from a conversation that i\nhad in one of my coaching groups and one\nof the people that was inside the\ncoaching group said you know\nand everything's going well like that's\nthe crazy thing he's he's talking about\nhow everything's going well like his\nbusiness is going so well this is the\nbiggest year that they've ever had he's\nlike my relationship with my wife is\ngoing so well my kids freaking love me\nwe've been traveling everything's going\namazing and i just still get this deep\nfeeling that something's about to up\nand we started having this conversation\nand as we started having this\nconversation there's other people who\nare in this coaching group as well we're\nlike oh my god i feel the exact same way\ni feel bad because this year was bad for\na lot of people but it was so good for\nme\nwhen am i going to get mine like they're\njust waiting for the other shoe to drop\nand the thing that you have to realize\nis who in the hell first off\nsaid that things can't go well forever\nwho like like it's this weird universal\nlaw that if things go well for a while\nyou're gonna get punched in the face at\nsome point in time who who said that\nlike where did that come from i think it\ncomes from the\ndeep\ninternal fears\nof always looking for something to go\nwrong or something that is bad\nas a way of survival and that's what our\nbrain looks for so it's like oh my god\ngood good good good good\nsome you know a tiger's got to attack me\nyou know if you're you're walking\nthrough the planes and it's been a\nbeautiful day you're walking by a bush\nyou're like oh my god there might be a\ntiger in there and we're constantly\nlooking for the next tiger to come out\nand attack us no matter how well it's\ngoing or how bad it's going it seems\nlike we're always waiting for the next\nthing to come kick us in the crotch\nright and so do you secretly worry that\nsomething bad is going to come up for\nyou you know i hear a lot of people i'm\nnot a parent yet\ni will be one day and i hope i don't do\nthis but i hear a lot of parents that do\nthis where they'll be watching their\nchildren\nsleep and they're in like complete joy\ncomplete bliss they have all of the love\nchemicals the oxytocin the serotonin all\nof them just flowing through their body\nand they're like this thing i love this\nthing this child\nso much\nwhat\nwould i ever do if i lost them\nand it's like this this beautiful moment\nof just being in the state of just\nabsolute\nlove\nbut\nthey think to themselves i hope i don't\never lose them i hope there's nothing\ntragic that happens i hope they stay\nhealthy forever i hope that they don't\never die before me\ni'm going to ask you this question and i\nwant you to be honest with yourself\nbecause this is a rhetorical question\nbecause i can't hear you because i'm\ntalking to a microphone but have you\never done that before\nwhere you've been in this moment maybe\nyou don't have children but maybe you've\nbeen\nwatching a movie with someone that\nyou're in a relationship with and you're\nlaughing and you're joking you're having\nthe best time and you're like oh my god\ni'm so freaking full of love\ni hope i don't this up i hope she\ndoesn't ever leave me i hope she doesn't\never find out who i truly am and then\nshe won't love me have you ever been in\nthat situation before where you're just\nlike\nplease\ndon't let the next thing happen and\nwe're just waiting for the shoe to drop\nif you're doing that\nthe worst part about that is that if\nyou're starting to think about a\npotential\nfuture that doesn't even truly exist\nit's something that you're making up in\nyour head you're literally pulling\nyourself from one of the most beautiful\npresent moments that you could have in\nyour life\nand you're destroying it you're\nliterally the most present you could be\nwith that child when you're thinking\nabout that love you're living the most\npresence you can be with this person\nwhen you're thinking about that love and\nthen your brain immediately goes to i\nhope that this doesn't get taken from me\nand that's one of the hardest parts\nabout love is that love\nthe person that we love\ncould go and leave us at some point in\ntime there could be something tragic\nthat could happen to them at some point\nin time and so we almost pull back the\nlove that we have in fear that something\ncould happen to them once again it's\nwaiting for the other shoe to drop as a\nphrase that people always talk about\nsomething bad is coming things have been\ngoing well for so long and some people\nhave had\nyear\nwhen is my you're going to come and we\nhold ourselves back from our potential\nand once again it's like it's like the\nlaw of the universe like\nit's got to happen sometimes like that's\nwhat people actually feel like there's\nevery time i hear someone talking about\npotential terrible future outcome it's\nalways like it's got to happen as almost\nlike it's it's definitely a thing that's\nhappening in the future so why do people\nfeel this way why is it that we feel\nthis way where does it come from like is\nit it has to be something that we've\nlearned a little bit it has to be\nsomething that also is part of our\nnature and inside of our brain it's\nnature and nurture as well but it comes\nfrom a scarcity mindset that there is\nnot enough good to go around all of the\ntime\nwhere did we learn that when did you\never find out that there's not enough\ngood to go around all the time why does\nit have to go bad why can't it be great\nforever it's like when people say oh\nyou're taking three steps forward and\none step back like life is just three\nsteps forward two steps back or two\nsteps forward three steps back and\nthere's always like a\nforward and in the back and then a\nforward and then the back and the\nforward and then the back and the thing\nabout that is that it's all perception\nin that situation it is all perception\nthe back the quote-unquote back that you\nfeel is all perception what seems like a\nstep back could just be a redirection in\nthe correct way that you should be going\nthat's really what it is it's a detour\non the path that you're trying to go to\nit is the universe in some sort of way\nsaying hey\ndude maybe it's time to pivot like this\nisn't the actual path let me move you\njust a slight bit\nso that you can make sure that you're\ngoing the right path that's really what\nit should be the way i like to think\nabout it is is i've been practicing a\nlot in my backyard with a bow and arrow\nright i have a compound bow and i have a\ntarget that's in the back\nwhenever i shoot that thing it is there\nis no way there's no way in physics that\ni can get that thing that bo that arrow\nto fly forward unless i pull that bow\nback so if a redirection doesn't\nnecessarily hit home with you and you're\nnot like oh yeah maybe it's not a\nredirection if that doesn't necessarily\nhit home with you what if the pullback\nthe step back is actually a way to pull\nyou back to then propel you forward\nbecause the just like an arrow the arrow\nis not going to go anywhere unless you\npull it back and then let go here's the\ninteresting thing about it as well\nthough the further that you pull it back\nthe more tension that there is on the\nstring\nthe further it's going to fly and so\nsometimes these momentary quote-unquote\nsetbacks actually are something that we\nneed to propel us further into the\nfuture\nwe can all agree and we've talked about\nthis i don't know countless times in the\npodcast where if something happens to\nyou that is quote unquote bad in your\npast\nwhen you're going through it it doesn't\nfeel amazing but then when you look back\non it five years down the road 10 years\ndown the road 20 years down the road\nyou're like i\nhated that moment but there is nothing\nthat you could pay me to take away the\nlessons that i learned in that moment\nthose lessons are the things that are\ngiven to you by the universe to then\npropel you and so maybe it's not a step\nback maybe it's just a new lesson for\nyou maybe it's a lesson so that you can\nmake a little bit of a shift in your\nlife to start to actually change\nwhat's going on what if it's just a\npivot but really what it comes down to\nis what you're focusing on the most\nso what are you focusing on\nwhen you go through your day are you\nfocusing on what you're afraid of are\nyou focusing on what you don't want to\nhappen i had an event a few months ago\nthat was in mexico\none of the women that was at the event\ncame up to me after the first day\nand she's like rob i had this massive\nbreakthrough today and i was like cool\nwhat was that breakthrough she goes i've\nrealized that i've nev my entire life\ni've almost never focused on what i want\ni focus on what i don't want\nand i go how's that working for you and\nshe goes i get a whole lot of what i\ndon't want i'm like i know and the\nreason why is because you're such a\npowerful being at your core every single\none of us is such a powerful being at\nour core that we're like a magnet\nattracting what we focus on and so if\nwe're focusing on what we're afraid of\nwe're going to get more things to be\nafraid of if we're focusing on all of\nthe bad that we want to get we don't\nwant to have in our life we're going to\nactually attract that bad into our life\nand so if you're focusing on those\nthings you're going to get those things\ni've used this example before too\nbut there was one time there was it\nreally hit home with me when i was i was\noddly enough going go-karting from one\nof my friend's birthdays and we have a\ntrack here in austin there's a guy who\nused to be an f1 driver he literally\ndrove like in lamar he drove all of all\nthe kinds of crazy cool things that he\ndid and he was a french guy he was funny\nand he was all laughing and making us\nlaugh the whole time he was talking to\nus about the carts that went like 50\nmiles an hour they were crazy fast this\nmile long track that he had he was\nmaking jokes and then he got really\nfreaking serious and it was like the\nenergy of the room shifted and he goes\nthere will be a crash at some point in\ntime when there is a crash do not look\nat the crash look past the crash to\nwhere you want to go and then everyone\nkind of chuckle a bit he's like no this\nis the most serious thing i could tell\nyou do not look at the person who who\ncrashes\nlook past it because if you look at it\nyou will absolutely hit it\nand that's exactly how life is\nwhatever you're looking at you're aiming\nat\nif you go back to the bow and arrow\nexample\nif you're looking\nat something that's the thing that\nyou're going to hit\nso are you looking at the bad are you\nlooking at what you're afraid of\nare you looking at your deepest darkest\nfears your insecurities or are you\nlooking at the place that you want to go\nthe vision that you want the life that\nyou want to create for yourself it's the\nsame exact thing with motorcycles i've\nnever driven a motorcycle but i do know\nthis from friends who ride motorcycles\nwhen we've talked about it is you're\ntaught when you go through a turn to\nlook at where you want to go you don't\nlook at the ground of where your your\nmotorcycle currently is you look at\nwhere you want to go because when you\nlook at where you want to go you will\nlean in to where and where you want to\ngo\njust makes sense doesn't it i mean when\nyou're shooting a basketball you're not\nlooking at the basketball what are you\nlooking at where you're trying to shoot\nthe basketball like there's so many\nexamples that i can give you of\nparts of your life whether it's being on\na go-kart whether it's being on a\nmotorcycle whether it's being playing\nbasketball is that you're always trying\nto look the place that you want to go\nbut for some reason our brain\njust automatically goes to what we don't\nwant and if you continue to look at what\nyou don't want you're going to get more\nof what you don't want and so how can\nyou wake up every single day\nand focus on the things that you do want\nto look at them as if you are an\narcher i went and shot i went and shot\nmy my bow and arrow today i was at the\nthe range right and there's a little\nwe're 25 yards away and there's a little\nteeny tiny it's like an inch and a half\nwhite circle there is nothing else that\ni'm looking at everything else kind of\nblurs away and i stare at the white\ncircle because if i look at anything\nelse i'm not going to hit the white\ncircle the white circle is in the center\nof the target all of the rest of the\nentire target is black and if i'm trying\nto hit it shouldn't i look at the thing\nlike that would make sense and so if\nyou're trying to to create the life that\nyou want shouldn't you look at your\ngoals as far as what is it you're trying\nto create\nso what are you focusing on most\nthat's an important thing to ask\nyourself bad times quote unquote bad\ntimes that you see in your life\nare necessary sometimes for you to pivot\nfor you to change for you to make\nadjustments in your life but what if you\nnever worried about something going\nwrong\nhow how weird would that feel like be\nhonest for a second if you just never\nactually worried about anything going\nwrong if you just believe that god or\nthe universe or your own personal power\nis going to make it happen that's going\nto it's going to get you to pay the\nbills it's going to create the life that\nyou want it's going to create the\nbusiness that you want the relationship\nthat you want the children that you want\nthe finances that you want it's just\ngoing to happen what if you woke up\nevery single day with that confidence of\ni'm going to get what i want the reason\nwhy i'm going to get what i want is\nbecause every morning when i wake up i\nwrite my goals down i write them down\neven if i wrote them down the day before\nthe day before the day before the day\nbefore i write my goals down every\nsingle day because when you write your\ngoals down every single day you are\nfocusing on that tiny little white dot\nand the target\nhow could i possibly hit that target if\ni'm not looking at it how can i possibly\nhit my goals unless i'm waking up every\nsingle day and focusing on those goals\nas if i was trying to hit that target\ni'm focusing on it because that is my\ntarget i'm focusing on it because that's\nwhere i'm going i'm focusing on it\nbecause i know that if i put all of my\nenergy into that thing\ni'm gonna get it\nand it's exactly the same for you you're\na powerful being more powerful you could\npossibly imagine and so if you're\nlooking what you don't want you're going\nto get what you don't want you are a\nfreaking\nmassive magnet\nand if you're if you're going oh man i'm\njust always poor i'm just always broke\nwe all have that friend that always\ntalks about how broke they are all the\ntime they're focusing on it and guess\nwhat i have friends like that that have\nbeen you know friends since high school\nthat have talked about how broke there i\ngraduated high school what year are we\nin i graduated high school uh\nit's been forever 15 years ago coming up\non 15 years i have a friend who is a\ngreat friend in high school he's a great\nfriend in college and he always talked\nabout how broke he is and every single\ntime i see him at some point in time i\nknow he's going to talk about how broke\nhe is and guess what he's still freaking\nstruggling why because he's literally\nsetting himself up for struggle every\nsingle day because that's what he's\nfocusing on and so if he were to want to\nmake an adjustment he would just go i'm\ngoing to make money this year i'm going\nto make money this year i'm going to\nmake money this year and he would start\nto journal every single day and guess\nwhat would happen his ideas would come\nout his ideas would come out his energy\nwould start focusing on going into the\ndirection that he wants versus what he\ndoesn't want and really what he would do\nis he would start to shift his mindset\nthis entire episode is about shifting\nyour mindset\nto waiting for something good to happen\nat all points in time there is always\ngood that's waiting for you down the\nline there's always good that's waiting\nfor you down the line it's always just\nsitting there\nwaiting to give it to you the question\nis are you waiting to receive it\nor you sitting there with your hands out\nwaiting for something bad to happen to\nyou whatever you focus on you will get\nthere is no bad that's coming for you\nthere is only good that's coming for you\nbut you have to set your sights on that\nthing every single day the same way that\nyou're only going to hit that target\nwhen you see the target the question is\nwhat target are you focusing on\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well there\nare some people\ntoday right now possibly even listening\nto this episode that are still pissed\noff about something that happened to\nthem 10 years ago what a waste\nyou"
