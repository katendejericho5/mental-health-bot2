    "transcript": "how many times have you given up on\nyourself in your life imagine if you\ndidn't give up where you would be\nnow\nimagine where you could be if you\nstarted today\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe law of 100 and i'm going to explain\nto you what that means i'm going to talk\nto you about a secret to success and\nit is extremely simple but it is also\nfor most people very difficult to do\nit's not really hard to do we just make\nit way more difficult than it needs to\nbe but even though it's super simple it\nis extremely extremely important for the\nsuccess that you're trying to build for\nyourself for your family for the world\nthe impact that you want to do and i'm\ngoing to teach you a little bit of how\njerry seinfeld the comedian actually\nused this technique to be one of the\ngreatest comedians in the wealthiest\ncomedian that has ever lived by using\nthis thing called the law of 100. so i\ncalled the lava 100. i don't know if\nthere's another name for it i just made\nit up as a law of 100. and it's very\nsimple\nthe first thing you need to do is you\nneed to decide what it is that you need\nto do so what i mean by that if you're\nlike oh i want to lose weight okay well\ndecide the one most important thing that\nyou need to do to lose weight\nmaybe it's work out\nmaybe it is eat healthier maybe it is\nstop drinking alcohol maybe it is stop\ndrinking soda stop your intake of sugar\nfind out the you know figure out what it\nis that you want to do\nand then figure out what the very most\nimportant thing that you need to do in\norder to get there don't figure out the\nthree four five things and try to be an\noverachiever figure out the one thing\none thing and one thing only that you\nneed to do to get yourself there so\nthat's step number one\nyou know in the the way that that i\nthink about it is this it could be an\naction in your business it could be an\naction in your relationships it could be\nan action that you need to take in your\nweight loss in your gaining muscle it\ncould be one action that you need that's\nall it is it's just one action that you\nneed to do and you're going to do that\nthing for 100 days in a row\nso it's very simple it's two steps so\ni'm gonna break it down through we're\ngonna go much more in depth why this\nworks how to make it easier but it's\nliterally two steps okay number one\ndecide what that action is\nthat's it what is that action so think\nabout it right now what is it that you\nwant to achieve in your life and what is\none action that you can do to help you\nget there if you are saying hey you know\nwhat\ni want to make a hundred thousand\ndollars this year and in order to do\nthat i know i need to make a hundred\nphone calls a day\nthat's just what i need to do looking at\nmy numbers looking at my closing ratio\nlooking at the amount of people who pick\nup when i call all of that all i need to\ndo is make 100 phone calls every single\nday so that is the action that's going\nto get us closest to the desired result\nthat we want so step number one is to\ndecide what that action is and step\nnumber two is to do it every\nsingle\nday\nfor 100 days so you might be out there\nand saying oh my gosh but\ni don't know if i wanna lose weight and\ni need to go to the gym is it okay for\nme to work out 100 days in a row yes\nit's okay for you to work out 100 days\nin a row\nchange what your workout is do cardio\none day do weight lifting one day do\nyoga one day whatever it is you need you\ncould do hot yoga whatever you need to\ndo do some form of working out for 100\ndays straight so step number one decide\nwhat the action is step number two do it\nevery single day for 100 days the reason\nwhy is because when you decide i'm going\nto do this 100 days\nyou take out all of the room\nthat you allow yourself to give you the\nbs excuses as to\nwhy you can't do it or yourself let me\nbelieve all of those things the excuse\nand the self-limiting beliefs are still\ngoing to come up but when you have made\na commitment and your word is worth\neverything so if you make a commitment\nand you don't follow through on it that\nis your fault that is your giving up on\nsomething so when you decide it allows\nyou to get past the self-limiting\nbeliefs it allows you to get past the\nthe excuses the self-sabotage you just\ndecide i don't give a damn what happens\nto me if i get hit by a truck i'm going\nto do this thing every single day for\nthe next 100 days and let me tell you a\nfew reasons why this is important for\nyou first thing is that successful\npeople whatever success means to you the\nthing that i've come to realize about\nsuccess is it's not really that hard we\nmake it much more more harder than it\nneeds to be\nmuch harder than it needs to be\nsuccessful people are just consistent\nthat's it they're just consistent and we\ncould take success in any way if you\ncould look at somebody who's wealthy if\nthat's what success means to you\nthey worked really hard consistently and\nthey just didn't give up\nsimple did they have struggles and\nchallenges coming up along the way\nabsolutely but they worked really hard\nconsistently and they became wealthy now\nyou might look at somebody and say okay\nwell my definition of success is\nsomebody who is extremely calm and\ncentered and is an amazing person right\nthat might be your definition of success\nokay well there's a pretty good chance\nthat that person has meditated every\nsingle day or developed something that\nthey need to and done it every single\nday so that therefore they can be more\ncalm they can be more centered so if if\nsuccess to you is joy and peace and\nhappiness and all that stuff you can 100\ncreate those things but you have to\nrealize that you need to be consistent\nwith whatever that is you might say\nwell success to me right now and what\ni'm trying to work on for this year and\nthe upcoming year and whatever it is the\nnext six months is being in incredible\nshape okay well they quote unquote\nsuccessful person and and someone that's\nin incredible shape they worked out they\nstayed consistent with their workout\nplan they stayed consistent with their\ntheir dieting they stayed consistent\nwith their water intake they stayed\nconsistent with not having so much sugar\nhaving\nless alcohol they stayed consistent the\nnumber one thing that i see among\nsuccessful people they're not the\nsmartest people in the world they don't\ncome from money all of the time\nin fact just in case you guys want to\nknow in the united states out of all of\nthe millionaires that exist in the\nunited states only uh 20 of them come\nfor money which means 80 of them don't\ncome from anything and so you can't say\noh yeah but they came for money and i\ndidn't have any money and my family was\nbroke you have to realize it's just\nabout being consistent it's showing up\nand it's working towards the thing that\nyou need to get it's just the consistent\ndaily action success comes from\nconsistency\nlet me say that again let me get it into\nyour brain success comes from consistent\nlet's see whatever that success is even\nif you want to be an incredible parent\nokay well i want you to spend an hour a\nday undivided attention with your\nchildren every single night put your\nphone away turn the tv off\nthat's going to make you a better parent\nmaybe that's what success means to you\nso you have to figure out what the\nsuccess is that you want you have to\nfigure out the number one action needs\nto be taken and you need to do it every\nsingle day this is it step number one\ndecide what the action is step number\ntwo do it every single day for a hundred\ndays success comes from consistency you\ndon't fail until you give up that's it\nfailure comes from giving up and so\nyou've got to think about that but let\nme explain to you why this is important\nas your brain just in your brain just so\nyou have an idea imagine your brain is\nlike a forest right and i'll explain to\nyou what this means eventually what\nhappens over time i'm 35 years old i\nhave 35 years of habits and things that\ni've done over the years i have neural\npathways in my brain that are strong\nthat i've done over and over and over\nand over again those habits i've done\nover and over again\na habit is just something that my brain\nhas turned on to autopilot so that it\nmakes it easier for me to consistently\ndo over and over and over again\nso we have habits that are good we also\nhave habits that are bad and we want to\nget rid of those habits and so when you\nthink about that you start to ask\nyourself the question\nokay\nif i don't have the habit that i want to\nto create the life that i want i need to\ncreate that habit of working out every\nsingle day of spending it out with my\nchildren every single day of meditating\nevery single day whatever it is that\naction is for you and it usually takes\nanywhere between 21 to 100 days to\nrewire a habit or to wire a habit into\nyour brain and so if you think of your\nbrain as a big giant forest\nyour habits are kind of like the pathway\nthat has been carved in the forest by\ngoing down it over and over and over\nagain you know when you walk a pathway\nevery single day every single day every\nsingle day every single day it starts to\nget rid of all the plants and the weeds\nand everything around it because you've\nbeen stepping in that that's what a\nhabit is in your brain in the forest\ncreating a new habit and doing this\nevery single day for 100 days is\nliterally the idea of walking into the\nforest with a machete and then just\nhacking a brand new pathway attacking a\nbrand new place inside of this inside of\nyour brain so whether that's the working\nout habit whether that's spending time\nwith your children habit whether it's\nthe meditation habit whatever it is\nyou're literally taking machete and\nhacking that new thing into your brain\nthat's what we're trying to do here\nthat's how we turn it into a habit now\nhow did seinfeld use this well seinfeld\nis actually famous for doing something\nthat they've now coined the seinfeld\ncalendar and what he would do is what he\nrealized when he was a new comedian he\nneeded to work at his craft every single\nday and so he made himself write jokes\nevery single day like there was not rain\nor shine nothing out of his way he wrote\njokes every single day and he had a\ncalendar that was up on the wall it was\none of the calendars and every single\nday was on it\nand he had a red pen that was attached\nto that calendar and he would you know\nwas just dangling from it and when he\nwould finish his jokes that he had\nwritten for the day he would walk up to\nthat calendar and he would put a big red\nx on the day which means that he\ncompleted his task for the day and so\nhow can you use this to your advantage\nthe thing that he said is that once he\nstarted and he he could consistently see\na bunch of red x's\nhe didn't want to break the cycle he\nliterally drove him to go up and do more\njokes and more jokes because he was able\nto see all of the red x's and he's like\nwell i don't wanna i don't want today to\nbe the day that i break it and so he\ncontinued to keep it going and so one\nthing you could do\nis you could say hey i want to do this\nfor 100 days straight let me mark off my\ncalendar here's day one okay today\nhere's 100 days from today and my my\ngoal my commitment is that i'm going to\nput a red x every single day for doing\nthis thing that i'm going to be doing\nfor the next hundred days that's it\nhe ended up doing this and he did it for\nthousands of days it was like\nyears and years and years that he went\nwriting jokes writing jokes and writing\njokes so when you look at him you're\nlike well he's one of the most\nsuccessful comedians ever he's also the\nwealthiest comedian ever maybe it's\nbecause the fact that he was so freaking\nconsistent when he was trying to master\nhis craft that he became better than\neveryone else because of the fact that\nhe was so so consistent success is not\nhard success is so simple we just make\nit hard it's just wake up and do the\nright things every single day wake up do\nthe right things every single day and do\nit consistently and then just don't give\nup and eventually you're going to\nsucceed in whatever it is that you want\nlike i said the most successful people\nthat i know they're not\nthe smartest people they don't know\neverything in the world they're not the\nthe most well-read people\nthey're just really damn consistent at\ndoing the right things\nevery single day and so it comes down to\nyour hard work and your dedication more\nthan anything else you know if you were\nto look at it\nand you were to say all right i'm gonna\ndo this for a hundred days\nimagine what would happen if you did\nthis for the next year imagine what\nwould happen if you do it for a hundred\ndays and then doing it for 100 days\nmotivates you to keep going and you go\nfor an entire year imagine where you\ncould be a year from today if you took\nthat action every day for the next 365\ndays your life could be completely\ndifferent now what if you fast forward\nit three years\nwhere could your life be if you said you\nknow what success in my business is the\nthing that i'm working at more than\nanything else i'm gonna put 100 days\ninto working hard in my business doing\nxyz because that's what's going to get\nmy business the furthest and then you\ndid that every single day for 100 days\nand then a year and then three years\nimagine where your life could be if you\nfast forwarded\nthree years from today\nknowing that you did that thing every\nsingle day like if i told you\nthink about this for instance i told you\nhey you know what if you do something\nevery single day for the next three\nyears\ni'm gonna pay you five million dollars\nguaranteed\nabsolutely would you go for it if you\nare 100 guaranteed to succeed i'm like\nhey just do it every single day\nfor three years and i'll give you five\nmillion dollars in cash would you do it\nis the answer yes or no answer it out\nloud to yourself\nit's probably yes right i'll give you\nfive million dollars to do this thing\nevery single day for the next three\nyears you're guaranteed success now you\nhave to think about this i can't\nguarantee that whatever that thing is\nthat you want you're gonna have in three\nyears but i can guarantee you if you\ndon't stop you will eventually get that\nthing that you want so if acquiring five\nmillion dollars was the thing that you\nwanted i can't guarantee you that if you\ntake the right action you're gonna get\nit literally in three years but if\nyou're taking the right action to make\nthat money you will eventually make the\nfive million dollars it could be less\nthan three years it could be more than\nthree years\nbut success is pretty much guaranteed\nwhen you take the right action\nsuccess is pretty much guaranteed when\nyou take the right action if you're not\ntaking the right action it's gonna be a\nlot harder you know and just don't stop\nwhat\nwhere could you be in your life if you\ndidn't give up years ago and i think\nthat was really important to you how\nmany of you listening right now have\ngiven up on something that was really\nimportant to you four years ago\nyou know that side business that you\nwanted and it wasn't bringing in as much\nmoney as you wanted to so you shut it\ndown where could you be if you just\nnever shut it down\nhow different could your life be if you\ndid not shut that business down four\nyears ago and you have continued to to\nstruggle and mess things up and figure\nit out and get a little bit better and\nstruggle and mess things up and figure\nit out and get a little bit better\nwhere could you be now if you didn't\ngive up four years ago if you didn't\ngive up seven years ago if you didn't\ngive up 17 years ago where could your\nlife be right now a completely different\nplace\ni don't say that because i want to bring\nyou down i say it because i want to put\nyour life into perspective you now know\nthat if you hadn't given up your life\nwould be in a completely different place\nwell now let's take the knowledge that\nwe have from the past let's bring it\ninto our present and then use it for our\nfuture why don't i decide what it is\nthat i want and then just decide that\ni'm not going to give up i'm going to go\nfor a hundred days and then hopefully at\nthe end of those hundred days i'm\nmotivated to keep going and i'm going to\ncreate a new habit in my brain think\nabout where your life could be it could\nbe a completely different place than it\ncurrently is sometimes we have a little\nbit of a struggle\nbuilding a business whatever it is we're\ntrying to do and we're like you know\nwhat\nmaybe this isn't for me maybe it's just\nthe universe saying hey rob this isn't\nthe right thing try something else when\nin reality that's just our ego that's\njust that little voice inside of our\nhead that little [ __ ] inside of our\nheads saying oh give up man stay where\nyou are hey give up stay where you are\nhey you know no you don't need to you\ndon't need to go and be a success you're\nprobably not good enough or smart enough\nfor any of those things and what happens\nis we talk yourself out of the thing\nthat's going to be the most fulfilling\nfor us imagine if you didn't give up\nwhere you would be\nnow\nimagine where you could be if you\nstarted today imagine where you could be\nif you started today and he said i'm\njust going to give up how many times\nhave you given up on yourself in your\nlife 1 2 5 10 20 times maybe\nwhat if you just decided\ni'm going to go full force of this thing\nfor the next three years and if it\ndoesn't work after three years then i\ncan give it up but i have no other\noptions there is no reason to have a\nplan b because the distraction plan as\nwill smith says but i'm going to succeed\nat this thing no matter what i'm going\nto give myself three years not\nnot 45 days not two months of running a\nbusiness not six months of running\nbusiness i'm gonna go for the next three\nyears i'm dedicated my life to three\nyears in building this business where\ncould your life be in three years if you\nhad that sort of mindset if you didn't\ngive yourself a back door a way to get\nout\nyou said you know if you said the the\none of my favorite lines from the great\nphilosopher of a guy named marshall\nmathers eminem success is my only mother\noption failure is not what if you had\nthat thought in your head that success\nis your only option\nfor this\nfailure's not\nbecause you only fail when you give up\nso if you just don't give up you'll\neventually figure it out you'll acquire\nthe skills the knowledge the tool belt\nto do what needs to be done to succeed\nin whatever it is so what if you had\nthat mindset\nthe way that you started is by\ndedicating the next 100 days the law of\n100 i'm going to stick to this thing i\nknow what my desired outcome is step\nnumber one figure out the action is step\nnumber two\ndon't give up just go for the next 100\ndays if you want to start a brand new\nlife figure out that action is decide\ntoday\nthat this is the first day of the rest\nof your life and do not stop for the\nnext 100 days if it makes you feel\nbetter and it makes you more excited get\na calendar put a red x on it and make\nsure that you stay consistent for the\nnext 100 days see how much different\nyour life is 100 days from today and\nthen see how much different your life is\na year from today and your life will not\nbe the same it will be measurably\ndifferent\nthree years from today than it is right\nnow just don't give up on yourself\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well there\nare some people\ntoday right now possibly even listening\nto this episode that are still pissed\noff about something that happened to\nthem 10 years ago what a waste\n[Music]"
