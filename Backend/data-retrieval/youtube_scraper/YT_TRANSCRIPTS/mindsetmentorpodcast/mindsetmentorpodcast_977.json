    "transcript": "like you can barely notch your pants\nafter you have a ton of tacos right and\nyou're trying to tell me you're trying\nto control the whole universe that makes\nno sense\ntoday we're gonna be talking about how\nto overcome\nanxiety\nbecause it seems like with all of the\nstuff that's happened in the world right\nnow there's a whole lot of worry there's\na whole lot of anxiety and there's\ni mean let's be real there is a lot of\nstuff that's happening in the world\nright now and with all of the things\nthat are happening in the world right\nnow it's very easy if you get caught up\nin all of it it's very easy for the\nentire world to feel very heavy right\nnow over the past couple years it's felt\npretty damn heavy hasn't it we can all\nagree on that no matter what side of the\nroad you're on it's pretty heavy okay uh\nyou can feel lost\nif you're not working on yourself and\nnot paying attention and you might just\nbe ready for being honest for this just\nto be over right you might be like i\njust want this to be over already i'm\ntired of this i'm tired of that i'm\ntired of being this way i'm tired of\neveryone acting this way i'm tired of\nthis happening i just want this to be\nover\ncool that's okay you can want that but\ni'm here to tell you\nwhatever happens it's all going to be\nall right\nit's going to be fine it's gonna be all\nright all right all right there's no big\ndeal there's things that are happening\nand there's always things that are\nhappening you can look at all the stuff\nthat's happening in the world right now\nit can seem like freaking chaos but then\ni go back and i listen to like bob dylan\nin in his moment in his life in the\nearly like 60s\nit felt like it was chaos and it sounds\nin his music like it was chaos and so as\nhumans i don't know if there's ever a\nmoment where we don't have some\nhappening i'm gonna help you just try to\nmake all of it a little bit better and\nthat's what i'm going to do today and\nthis whole whole idea came back so i was\ntalking with a friend of mine she was\ntalking about all of the stuff that's\nhappened with covid right and for the\nholidays she was going back to be home\nwith her parents and she was worried\nbecause she had all these things that\nwere happening and\ndoesn't know she doesn't want to get her\nparents sick she doesn't know what's\ngoing on and on top of all of that\nshe uh was was waiting for her dog's\ntest results to come back there were\nsome test results\nissues with her dog's liver and then on\ntop of that she was also thinking about\nthe economy and so we have this\nconversation she's like i'm just so\nanxious right now i'm so stressed out i\nwas like why is that she's like well\nyou know i'm about to go home for the\nholidays and you know i\ni'm traveling home i hope i don't pick\nsomething up on the on the airplane and\ngive it to my parents that would be the\nworst thing if i get sick and i give it\nto my parents and something happens to\nthem and then i also have my dog he's\ngot some issues that are going right now\nand i just want the test results to be\nback already and you know the economy\nthere's this inflation and i don't know\nwhat's going on with the economy and the\ninflation and are we in a bubble or\nwe're not in a bubble what should i do\nam i going to lose my money is going to\nbe worth nothing with this whole\nconversation and i let her get it all\nout and\nword vomit everything that she's anxious\nabout and thinking about and then i said\nhey um just curious\nout of all of those things with\neverything that's happening in the world\nright now with copen with your dog's\ntest results and waiting for those to\ncome back\nand with the economy\num how many of those can you control and\nshe's like um\nnone of them really and i was like okay\nso\nis it that you can't control them that's\nstressing you out or is it because\nyou're thinking about too much of the\nfuture that's stressing you out and\nshe's like i don't know i guess it's a\nlittle bit of both and i was like\ncorrect you can control\nliterally none of those nothing you\ncan't control what happens with covid i\ncan't i don't know what the hell is\ngoing on with all that stuff you can't\ncontrol when your dog's test results\ncome back you also can't control the\neconomy and so if something's out of\nyour control\nwhy are you stressing out over it\nbecause what you're doing is you're\nactually placing worry for a potential\nfuture that might happen and there was a\nstudy that was done that psychologists\nfound out that 85 of what we worry about\nnever even happens in the first place\nand so 85 of the time if you're worrying\nabout something you're putting yourself\nyou're putting your body you're putting\nyour your your body your mind your\nemotions you're putting your nervous\nsystem at a heightened state and through\nstress for absolutely no reason so it's\nnot that none of these things exist\nshortcode exists sure problems with her\ndog's dog exists sure the economy and\nthe um you know how stable it might be\nor might not be\nall of these things exist but it's not\nthat they exist that's stressing or\ndoubt it's that she's fighting with them\nin her mind does it make sense she's\nfighting with them in her mind as humans\none of the things that i find with\nalmost everybody\nis everybody has some level low level at\nleast if not to a high level of a\ncontrol problem and the things that are\nout of our control are the things that\nreally stress us out and make us worry\nthe most give us the most anxiety and so\nwhen you think of the things in your\nlife right now that might be causing you\nworry they might be causing you anxiety\nthey might be stressing you out ask\nyourself this question are they things\nthat you can control right now\nor\nare they things that are out of your\ncontrol and you're actually stressing\nout about the fact that you cannot\ncontrol them but you want to control\nthem the problem is not these things\nthat exist the problem is that she's not\naccepting that these things exist she's\nnot accepting that she has no control\nover these things she's resisting the\nway that the world is\nthat's the fact of matter she's\nresisting just the way that the world is\ni always say your levels of anxiety\nstress\nworry and fear will be in direct\nproportion to how much you are resisting\nthe way that the world is the world is\nthe way that it is\nbut you will have more anxiety more fear\nmore worry all of those things if you\nare resisting the way the world is your\nanxieties have come because the fact\nthat those things exist it becomes it\ncomes\nit pops up because of the fact that\nliterally you're resisting the fact that\nthose exist and you can do nothing about\nit and so\nyou know do i want me personally coveted\nto exist anymore no it'd be really\nso much easier if it didn't exist\ndoes it\nit does\nso i can either accept right now that it\ndoes exist or i can resist that it does\nexist and i can either have peace over\nthe fact that does this or i can just\nreally be stressed out about the fact\nthat it's still around and i don't know\nwhat the future is going to be the\ndecision is completely up to me i can't\nchange the thing\nbut i can change the way that i think\nabout the thing\nit makes sense with my friend she can't\nchange coven but she can change the way\nthat she thinks about it she can't\nchange her dog's test results but she\ncan change the way that she thinks about\nit she can't control\nthe economy but she can change the way\nthat she thinks about it and so\nultimately it comes down to paying\nattention to what is giving you anxiety\npaying attention what is giving you\nstress pay attention to what is giving\nyou worry very rarely do i talk to\nsomebody and they're anxious about\nsomething that's actually happening in\nthis present moment\nthat's what's crazy usually all of our\nworry and anxiety exists in the future\nit doesn't exist in this moment\nand so why would we worry about\nsomething that's in the future and\npossibly might never happen in the first\nplace because what's happening\nis that stress and worry\nand anxiety is stealing\nthe joy from this present moment what\nyou have to realize is that your your\nentire life is made up of present\nmoments that's it your entire life does\nthat there is no past there is no future\nthere is this present moment right now\nwhere you're listening to my voice and\nin this present moment\nare you okay because your life is a\ncollection of present moments that's it\nyour past is just a whole bunch of\npresent moments that aren't here anymore\nyour future is a whole bunch of present\nmoments that are coming up\nsome point in time in the future so your\nworry your stress your anxiety is\nstealing your joy that you could be\nhaving right now and so my favorite\nquestions to ask somebody\nwhen someone's dealing with a lot of\nstress a lot of worry a lot of anxiety\nas i go hey\nare you okay\nand they're like what do you mean right\nlike in this present moment are you okay\nyeah i'm okay in this moment but i've\ngot bills that are coming up i've got\nthis thing that's coming up i've got\nthis thing no no no no no shut up shut\nup shut up\nare you okay in this present moment\nuh yeah i guess i'm okay in this present\nmoment okay are you safe\nright now\nwell yeah i'm safe right now but i've\nalso got this thing coming up i've got\nthis thing no no\nright now\nare you safe they always go\nyeah i mean right now i'm safe okay\nso tell yourself this\nrepeat after me right now i am okay\nright now i'm okay right now i am safe\nright now i am safe and if you repeat\nthis to yourself over and over and over\nagain you're calming down\nthe part of your brain that's freaking\nout about the future it's like the\nanimalistic part of your brain the\namygdala that's creating all of those\nfears you're calming it down by going\nokay there's no potential threat right\nin front of me and here's the thing is\nthat if you just ask yourself am i okay\nright now am i okay yes i'm okay right\nnow am i safe\nyes i am safe you start to tell yourself\nand i i i've noticed you know i'm i am\nnot a human that doesn't have stress\nthat pops up or anxiety pops up but\nwhenever it does\ni'll say i am safe i'm safe i'm safe i'm\nsafe and just by saying it i'm literally\ntelling the deep unconscious parts of my\nbrain that are bubbling all of this bull\nto the surface\nthat i'm fine and if i can prove to my\nbrain i can prove to that animalistic\npart of my brain the deep subconscious\nthat i'm okay\nthen it usually just subsides and i'm\nlike man\nthat only took like 30 seconds for it to\ngo away and i've taught this before in\nthe podcast in the past and i get emails\nand i get instagram messages there are\npeople like holy sh this actually works\nwhen i sit and ask myself am i okay am i\nsafe and then repeat to myself i am safe\ni'm safe i'm safe it's like your anxiety\ngoes down because you realize that\nyou're not in this present moment when\nyou're being anxious you're not in this\npresent moment when you're worrying\nyou're not in this present moment when\nyou're stressed you're thinking about a\npotential outcome potential future\nand that potential future never even\ncomes in the first place so by saying i\nam safe\nyou're trying to turn off all of those\nmechanisms in your brain they're\nfreaking out and bring them to the\npresent moment and say hey right now\nyou're fine so if you've been feeling\nstressed and worried and anxiety lately\nwhat is it you're freaking out about\nwhat is it that you're resisting knowing\nthat the world is the way that it is and\nwhere our anxiety and stress will only\ncome from how much we're resisting it\nwhat are you resisting you know a lot of\ntimes when people are stressed or\nanxious or worrying and all that stuff\nmaybe a breakup they just went through a\nbreakup right and they're not accepting\nthe breakup and they're wanting to get\nback to the person and they're thinking\nabout the past and what they should have\ndone and they're thinking about how can\ni get them back oh my gosh it's friday\nnight i wonder if they're out on a date\nwith somebody else i just i wish that it\nused to be the i wish that it was the\nway that it used to be\nthey're resisting the actual the way\nthat the world is which i said your\nlevels of anxiety stress and worry will\nbe in direct proportion to how much\nyou're resisting the way that the world\nis you are resisting the way that the\nworld is too much a breakup happened\nwhat can we do about it are you safe in\nthis moment i'm safe okay\nlet's say that someone that you know\ndies\nit sucks\nbut you have to ask yourself\ncan you do anything about it no not for\nthat person maybe you could do something\nabout it and help the family something\nlike that and so you have to realize\nthat you have to literally take yourself\nyou know i always say this on the\npodcast is when you're in the jar you\ncan't read the label and what that means\nis when you're in the jar of your life\nwhen you're inside of your own head you\ncan't really see what's going on you\ncan't really\nmake you know like if you were sitting\non the therapist the therapist is\noutside of your head they can see what's\ngoing on a little bit better sometimes\nand we can so we can't really read the\nlabel so sometimes you have to literally\npull yourself out of the jar pull\nyourself out of your head and look at\nyour circumstance and look at yourself\nas if you are somebody else and start to\nsay hey\nwhat is this person resisting what is\nthis person fearing what is this person\nafraid of\nwhat are they not accepting that they\ndon't have control over because we have\nto accept that you have control over\nalmost nothing like you can barely\ncontrol your your bowels after taco\ntuesday like you can barely notch your\npants after you have a ton of tacos\nright and you're trying to tell me\nyou're trying to control the whole\nuniverse that makes no sense so if you\ncan barely troll your bowels if you\ncan't control other people you can't\ncontrol the weather sometimes you can't\neven control your own thoughts you can't\ncontrol your first thought but you can\nalways control your second thought then\nmaybe we should just chill out a little\nbit\nrelease all of the control and say hey\nwhat can i do in this present moment and\nhow can i stop letting\nthis present moment be ruined by my\nworry anxiety and stress in the future\nonce again i always say it you can't\ncontrol your first stop but you can\nalways control your second thought your\nsecond thought\nis the chance to be able to reprogram\nyourself to think a different way and\nsometimes we've been programmed\nby our parents by people that we know to\nbe afraid to be fearful there's a lot of\npeople that you know that have gone\nthrough my coaching programs and they've\nmessaged me on instagram they're just\nlike my mom is so fearful my dad is so\nfearful and they've raised me raised me\nto be afraid of the world i'm terrified\nof all the things that are happening i'm\nso scared i'm so scared i'm so scared\nand it's like okay first off number one\nwe've developed awareness which is a\ngood thing\nand sometimes if you notice once again\nyou can't control your first stop but\nyou could try a second when the first\nthought comes in\nof fear fear fear fear fear fear fear\nwhatever that fear is the second thought\ncan be hey am i safe right now\nand actually bring yourself a present\nand be like yeah i am safe\neverything is fine\neverything's beautiful everything's good\nwhat am i stressing out about\ni guess there is nothing to stress out\nabout\nokay and that's the perfect example of\nyour first thought coming through and\nchanging your first thought\nto the second thought that you actually\nwant because ultimately if you can\nchange your first thought to your sec\nchange your first thought to a second\nthought that's empowering your life will\nbe completely different so what do we do\nam i okay\nam i safe the answer is yes i'm gonna\nsay i am safe i am safe i'm safe i'm\ngoing to accept that there is very\nlittle that i can do about this moment\nand what i'm going to do is i'm going to\nsit back and i'm going to go you know\nwhat what's beautiful about this moment\nand i'm gonna start to notice the beauty\nthat is in the present moment i'm gonna\nstart to notice the beauty of everything\nthat's around me\nthat i've been refusing to see and\nrefusing to notice through my anxiety my\nfear and then what i'm going to do is\ni'm going to focus on what is good in my\nlife versus what i can be afraid of\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well they\nalways come to me and they say can you\nstop my overthinking how do i stop my\noverthinking i'm like your brain's doing\nwhat it's supposed to do the problem is\nyou're just thinking about the wrong\nthing"
