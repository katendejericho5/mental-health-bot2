    "transcript": "welcome to today's episode of the\nmindset mentor podcast i am your host\nrob dial and if you have not yet done so\nhit that subscribe button so that you\nnever miss another episode of this\npodcast\n[Music]\nthis might seem weird and woo-woo and i\ncompletely understand that because i'm a\nvery logical\nsensible person but when i go through\nthis and i'm very analytical as well\nyou're going to see what i mean by how\nthe law of attraction works whether you\nhappen to be woo wooi or whether you\nhappen to be a very analytical\nscience-based type person this is going\nto make sense to you no matter which one\nyou are i'm going to teach you how to\nuse the law of attraction to get what it\nis that you want in your life\nnow i'll tell you this i've been using\nit now for about 15 years and i can tell\nyou this no matter what your stance is\non the law of attraction it works if you\ntake notes on this if you use it i'm\ngoing to teach you how it works how to\nuse in your life and how to get what you\nwant in life as well on a basic sense\nthis is what the law of attraction says\nit says that you can attract anything\nthat you want into your life\nbut you need to believe in it to your\ncore\nand if you believe in it to your core\nevery single cell in your body then you\nwill get whatever that thing is but\nthat's the secret to it is that you have\nto you have you have 50 trillion cells\nin your body right now right you have to\nget all of those cells\nto go towards that one thing\nin the way that you control your 50\ntrillion cells is through the central\nvoice your thoughts and that's what\nwe're going to go into i'm going to go\nmuch more in depth but basically you\nwill attract into your life what you\nthink about the most that's the easiest\nway to think of the law of attraction\nbut we're going to go much more in depth\nthan just that alone\nnow you may have seen the movie the\nsecret the secret is on the law of\nattraction i think it's a great movie\nit's a great book but i think it leaves\na lot out the way that the secret seems\nto be for me is i'm gonna sit down i'm\ngonna figure out what it is that i want\ni'm gonna sit there and think about it\nall day long and it's just going to the\nuniverse is just going to bring it into\nmy life\nand i think that's part of it but it's\nmissing a lot and that's what i want to\ndive into\nand there's no real explanation of how\nit works so it makes a lot easier to\nbelieve in something when you know\nexactly how it works because then you go\nokay yeah i can get behind this idea you\nknow you can't just sit there and just\nmeditate the rest of your life and try\nto meditate a million dollars in your\nbank account without actually getting up\nand doing something right so it requires\nyou to yes the law of attraction but\nalso it requires action you got to do\nsomething so we're going to dive into\nthat and to understand the law of\nattraction we must understand our bodies\nas they are our bodies are molecular\nstructures that are vibrating at a\nmassive speed at all points in time so\nyou can look at my hand and my hand\nseems like a solid object but my hand is\nnot solid\nit is actually vibrating if you were to\nbe able to look at my hand through a\nmicroscope be able to see all of the\ntrillions of cells in my body all of\nthem moving at a specific rate whatever\nthat is if you look at anything that you\ncan see in your physical reality\neverything is a vibrating structure my\ndesk this podcasting mic the camera this\nis recording it on my computer that's\nrecording this audio everything is\nvibrating it's just that everything is\nvibrating at different speeds and we're\nconstantly vibrating everything is the\ndifference between my body and my desk\nthough\nis that my desk is one constant speed\none constant vibration my body\nchanges depending on my thoughts and my\nfeelings so you know i'll give you a\nperfect example of of how this is going\nto make sense to you have you ever\nwalked up to somebody\nand you just have a bad feeling around\nthat person like there's just a feeling\nof something's not right\nright that is your body's vibration and\ntheir body's vibration coming into\ncontact with each other and they're not\nin alignment in some sort of way that's\ncalled destructive interference if you\nwant to go deeper into it right but if\nyou ever met somebody before and you\ndon't know why but you just connect with\nthem and you get an incredible feeling\naround them that is my body and their\nbody their fields coming together i know\nit sounds weird i get it for those guys\nthat are analytical are fields coming\ntogether because your your vibration of\nyour body doesn't just stay within your\nskin right so we are in alignment if i'm\nvibrating at a certain rate that\nperson's vibrating a certain rate\ni'm going to have good feelings that's\nwhere the phrase good vibes come from\nthat's also where the phrase bad vibes\ncome from as you can tell whether\nsomething's right or right wrong you can\ntell whether someone is right or wrong\nbased on basically how you feel now in\norder to understand how the law of\nattraction works we must understand two\nseparate things number one is our\nconscious mind which is the mind that\nyou hold all of your thoughts in and the\nother one is in your subconscious mind\nso we're gonna get really deep today\ni hope you're ready right your conscious\nmind is the mind in which you think\nright your conscious mind is only about\nfive percent of your thoughts throughout\nthe day right everything you think about\nand you can only hold one thought at a\ntime\nyour subconscious mind is like your\nmind's filing cabinet it doesn't know\nthis is true this is false it just takes\nall of the information and stores it all\naway as if all of it is true it doesn't\ndecipher the information doesn't think\nabout it any of that stuff but what's\ninteresting is that your subconscious is\nin control of about 95 of your thoughts\nyour feelings and the way that you see\nthe world as well so it's really\nimportant before we dive into the law of\nattraction a little bit more in depth is\nto actually understand\nthe way your subconscious mind which\nnobody tends to talk about when they\ntalk about the secret and they talk\nabout the law of attraction how your\nsubconscious mind actually dictates the\nlaw of attraction in what rate you're\nvibrating at now\nyou have to realize this\nthe subconscious mind once again just\ntakes everything that you say and\nautomatically stores it as true so if\nyou talk negatively about yourself in\nyour head if you talk trash to yourself\nsay oh my gosh i'm so stupid\nthen it's automatically going to take\nthat conscious thought stored in the\nsubconscious as true\nso if you constantly just keep thinking\nthis and thinking this and thinking this\nthat thought of i'm stupid over and over\nand over again now becomes a personality\ntrait of somebody who is stupid and now\nyou actually believe at your core that\nyou're stupid if you think oh i'll never\nattract the right man or i'll never\nattract the right woman or you know all\nguys or players or any of those types of\nthings those thoughts will then store\ninto your subconscious and you will take\nactions that line up with what your\nsubconscious believes in so after years\nand years and years of thoughts being\naway being stored away from your\nconscious to your subconscious you will\ndevelop a paradigm a paradigm is what\nyou believe is true and it's usually the\nsubconscious you don't even think about\nit it has shaped your life throughout\nthe years this your program from your\nchildhood is where your paradigm your\nthat's actually what dictates what your\nparadigm is going to be so if your\nparadigm is as a child\nif it shapes the way that you view the\nworld as an adult\nit's everything it's what you believe\nit's what you don't believe it's what\nyou love it's what you hate it's the\nlanguage you speak if you believe in\nyourself if you don't believe in\nyourself if you talk down to yourself if\nyou're rich and successful now if you're\npoor now if you ever will be rich and\nsuccessful if you'll continue to fail in\nrelationships if you have you know a\nsuccessful one the way that you raise\nyour kids your paradigm literally\ndictates everything that you do\neverything that you think everything\nthat you feel everything your conscious\nmind everything your subconscious mind\nit dictates everything so let me give\nyou an example if you were born poor as\na kid right and your parents always got\nin fights about money and your parents\nwere always in debt and they said stuff\nlike money doesn't grow on trees and\nmoney is the root of all evil and you\nknow in order to be rich and successful\nyou have to screw people over then your\nbrain's going to take that and take that\nand take that and take that and then\nit's going to consciously\nstore it into your subconscious and now\nyou've got a paradigm just around money\nitself uh i have to screw people over\ni'm never going to be rich as successful\nyou know\ni have to do bad things to make money\nmoney is the root of all evil money\ndoesn't grow on trees now i've got a\nparadigm around money\nwhich is going to change my perception\nof the view of money of the world it's\ngoing to change my thoughts around money\nit's going to change my vibration around\nmoney and it's going to dictate the way\nthat i either attract money or don't\nattract money or the actions that i take\nto go make money or the actions i take\nnot to make money so\nif you're poor now as an example\nif you're rich now as an example if\nyou're good in relationships now if\nyou're bad in relationships all of those\nare guided by your paradigm\nand those were all programmed into at\nsome point in time when you were a kid\nnow that being said when we're looking\nat the programming really the conscious\nand the subconscious mind we're looking\nat the paradigm it's not something that\nyou can just change overnight it's not\njust something that happens quick and\neasy it takes time\nbut believe me it's worth putting time\ninto and to actually start figuring\nthese things out right so ultimately\nwhat we're trying to do is we're trying\nto\nin its simplest form we're trying to\naffect and change all of the results\nthat we have in our life we're trying to\naffect our\nour and change although the results\naround our money making more money if we\nwant our relationships having better\nrelationships our happiness our joy our\nsuccess everything and it all starts\nwith what you think\nright and what you think whether it's\ngood or whether it's bad goes into your\nsubconscious it will eventually produce\nwhatever results you want in your life\nnow if you want to change your results\nyou're going to have to change your\nthinking right and all of your results\ntypically line up with your paradigm so\nlet me give you an example\nthere's gonna be a lot i promise you i\ntold you this is gonna be a big this\ncould be a rich episode just so you know\ndo you know somebody who has all of the\neducation in the world they have you\nknow degrees falling off the walls and\nthey're getting another degree and\nanother degree and another mba and all\nthis stuff but they just can't seem to\nsucceed they just can't seem to figure\nit out do you know anybody like that\nhave you ever heard of someone like that\nwhy do you think that is\nbecause they think that education is\ngoing to change them but it's not what\nactually changes and needs to change is\ntheir paradigm because they can get all\nthe education they want to in the world\nbut their paradigm hasn't hasn't changed\nnow what does this have to do with the\nlaw of attraction your paradigm is in\ncontrol of the frequency of vibration\nthat you set off into the world the\nfrequency and the vibration that your\nbody is at so in order to change your\nvibration you must change your frequency\nin order to change your frequency you\nhave to understand how your programming\nworks how your paradigm works and what\nis stored inside of your subconscious\nand when i say change your frequency and\nyour vibration the easiest way to think\nof it is this you know if i'm inside of\nmy car and i'm going for a drive and i\nhave the am\nstation turned on in my car my car will\nnever pick up an fm station if i am\ntuned into an am station right it won't\nhappen because i'm in an am station not\nan fm station\nso the same thing happens where if\nthe law of attraction the way that it\nworks if i have a poverty mindset if i\nhave a poverty paradigm if my\nsubconscious is being run by you know\nthese poverty thoughts and money is the\nroot of all evil you have to screw\npeople over and you have to work all day\nin order to become successful if i have\nthat poverty mindset\nthen i'm going to send that it's in my\nthoughts it's in my body i'm vibrating\nas poverty mindset frequency i'm going\nto send that out into the world right\nso an example of that would be all of\nthe people places opportunities and\nthings that could get me out of my\npoverty mindset i won't even notice them\nwhy\nbecause if someone comes in that could\nchange my or an opportunity comes in\nthat says oh this could get me out of my\npoverty mindset i'm not even going to\nrecognize that it's something that could\nhelp me i'm automatically going to push\nit away\nthe same way\nthat if i meet somebody and i'm not\nvibrating at the same frequency as them\ni'm going to get bad vibes so for\ninstance i might have a poverty mindset\nand the best freaking investment\nopportunity or the best business idea\ncan come into my awareness can come into\nmy field can come into my you know i can\nliterally be sitting there and talking\nto somebody who's got the best business\ninvestment that can make me millions of\ndollars if i'm vibrating as a negative\nyou know poverty mindset i'm not even\ngoing to take that thing as an option\ni'm going to be like no this isn't right\nit doesn't feel right which is usually\nhow you can tell you know the frequency\nit doesn't feel right why because i'm\nvibrating at poverty if abundance in\nwealth comes into my life and starts to\nvibrate i'm not going to be in line with\nit there's going to be a part of my by\nit says no rob don't do this don't do\nthis don't do this therefore i will\nreject that person i will reject the\nopportunity i will reject everything\naround me that could get me into my\nabundance that could get me into my\nwealth because i am at a poverty mindset\nmake sense\nif i'm vibrating at that frequency of\npoverty then anything that's not lined\nup with that poverty i'm going to reject\nit's crazy isn't it you know so what\nhappens is we have to get ourselves on a\nquote-unquote money-making frequency we\nhave to realize that our programming of\nmoney's the root of all evil and you\nknow you have to screw people over\nwhatever it is that is your your your\nfrequency the station that you're turned\ninto the same way that if i'm on an am\nstation i won't be able to pick up an fm\nstation if i'm on a poverty frequency\ni'm not going to be able to pick up an\nabundance frequency or a wealth\nfrequency\nit's simple it makes a whole lot of\nsense doesn't it remember the difference\nbetween myself and my desk is that we're\nboth vibrating but i can change my my\nvibration i can change my frequency i\ncan change the station that i'm turned\ninto\nright so you will attract whatever\nvibration or station that you're turned\ninto and you can only listen to that one\nstation so if i'm on a poverty mindset i\nwon't be able to poverty station won't\nbe able to get the abundance and\nyou know abundance in in wealth\nfrequency if i'm on the scarcity one\nlet's go to another one if you've been\nscrewed over maybe you're maybe your\nparents divorced when you were younger\nand your mom talked about how all men\nscrew you over and men are cheaters and\ndon't trust men or you heard her maybe\nshe even say it directly to you maybe\nyou overheard her talking to friends\nabout it right and then you grow up and\nyou get into a relationship maybe you\nget cheated on you're like oh my god my\nmom was right\nyou start to actually think\nso many times over and over and over and\nover and over again men are cheaters men\nwill screw you over you can't trust men\nyou know this is just an example it\ncould go the other way for men to women\nwomen to men\nand you keep repeating that thing over\nand over and over inside of your head\nwhat's going to happen is you are\neventually going to to create a paradigm\naround that you're going to go from your\ntake it from your conscious thoughts\nstore it into your subconscious mind\nwhich is going to change the frequency\nthat you're vibrating at and that's why\nso many people like i don't know why i\nkeep dating men that are broken i don't\nknow why i keep dating men that are\n i don't know why i keep finding\npeople who are screwing me over who\ncheat on me all of this stuff is because\nwe tend to attract into our life\nwhatever it is\nthat is going to line up with what we\nbelieve is true in our conscious mind\nand our subconscious mind in our\nparadigm we are going to attract those\nthings into our life so if we even if we\nconsciously even if you're a woman out\nthere or even a man out there that just\nwants a really good man\nyou're still going to attract\nthe ones that are not good for you if\nyou're always vibrating at the frequency\nof men will screw you over\nsame way for men for women for all of\nthis stuff you know you can switch out\nall of the genders and any way that you\nwant to it just makes sense though\ndoesn't it\nso the same example if i'm a woman who\nwants a really good man but i've been\nscrewed over and my mom said things when\ni was younger when a really good man\ncomes into my life i won't even vibe\nwith them or be attracted to them any\nsort of way because they don't line up\nwith the reality of the way that i see\nthe world\ni'm only going to be attracted to the\npeople who\nreinforce my paradigm of the way that i\nsee the world so that's why you know\nsomeone comes in they could be really\ngood for them and you're like why don't\nyou see your friend maybe and you're\njust like why doesn't she like him like\nhe's perfect for her why because he\nas a really good man doesn't reinforce\nher belief paradigm consciously and\nsubconsciously of the world of men or\n men screw you over men are\ncheaters why does she always end up with\nthose types of people because that's\nwhat she believes\nat a\na thought and at a cellular level that\nmen actually are\nthis is what meditation's for this is\nwhat going on and actually becoming\naware of these things is for is so you\ncan start to reprogram yourself you\nrealize\nwhat station am i tuned into\nwhat station are you tuned into in your\nrelationships in your wealth in your\nbusiness in your life and you're\nthinking about yourself what station are\nyou tuned into because whatever station\nif i'm tuned into 98.7\nfm i'm only going to get 98.7 fm i'm not\ngoing to get\n710 am if i'm tuned in a 98.7\nfm so i've got to pay attention to man\nwhat do i actually consciously and\nsubconsciously think is true about money\nabout business about relationships about\nwealth about happiness about abundance\nabout scarcity all of these things\nbecause that's going to dictate where my\nbody is vibrating at\nand if something vibes with me which is\nusually going to you know that's called\nconstructive interference versus\ndestructive interference\nthen i'm going to actually\nunderstand that i'm only noticing and\nattracting things into my life that line\nup with the way that i actually\ntruthfully deep down at a cellular level\nbelieve the world the way that the world\nis so that's why you can consciously\nwant success but then you're not taking\nany action that's why you can\nconsciously want to have the best\nrelationship but you're screwing them\nall up or finding the wrong person\nthat's why you can consciously want to\nhave a successful business but you're\nfreaking sleeping in and you're bringing\nthe wrong business partners in and all\nof these things are happening is because\nyou have to become aware not only just\nof your conscious thoughts but of your\nsubconscious thoughts and your paradigm\naround all of that because that's 95 of\nwhat you think about and it doesn't\nhappen overnight like i can't just go oh\nmy gosh you know what\ni'm going to change my frequency and i'm\njust a different person you know you can\ntry to work on it every single day but\nyou have to res you have to literally\nbrainwash yourself into believing that\nthat's why i have an episode you know\nthat's you know brainwash your uh your\nway to success or you have to brainwash\nyourself to change your paradigm and\nthat's\nbrainwashed yourself to be successful\nthat episode that i did\ntalks about how you have to spend every\nsingle moment every down time\nbrainwashing yourself with what it is\nthat you actually truly want to do in\nthis world so if you don't see results\nright away it's not a big deal it\ndoesn't mean it's not going to happen\njust realize it takes time for you to\nreprogram yourself if you're 35 years\nold you've got 35 years of programming\nit might take more than a couple weeks\nto start to switch your programming\nstarts to switch your paradigm and\nremember that we're all programmed from\na young age so our our our job now as\nadults is to go back look at what our\npar our paradigm is look at what our\nprogramming was from a young age ask\nourselves does that line up with the\nfuture that i want for myself and if it\ndoesn't then i need to consciously\nchange it and also subconsciously change\nit because my it starts with my thoughts\nwhich is my conscious mind they're\nstored into my subconscious mind that\nchanges my vibration which then changes\nwhat i attract in my life\nthat's why if i have a poverty mindset\nonce again and a great business\nopportunity opportunity comes into my\nawareness comes into my life i will be\nlike no it just doesn't feel right\nit's not that doesn't feel already\nbecause it's not right for you it\ndoesn't feel right because it's actually\nnot vibrationally matching where you are\nit's too freaking abundant for you for\nwhere you are right now\nso if you want something in your life\nare you tuned into it\nthink about that for a second if i want\nsomething in my life i need to be tuned\ninto that freaking thing\nif you want something in your life are\nyou tuned into that station if you want\nsomething in your life you need to be\ntuned into that st that station so that\nyou can start attracting it into your\nlife you know the one thing that i don't\nlike about the secret is that it acts\nlike you know what i\nif i want to have the best relationship\nin the world and attract the best man or\nthe best woman into my life i need to\nsit there and i need to meditate it into\nmy life and meditate and meditate and\nmeditate and eventually that man will\njust show up at my door no you have to\nliterally\nafter working on yourself after working\non the programming after diving into\nwhat your paradigm is you have to get\noff your ass and actually take action\nthe the man of your dreams or the woman\nof your dreams is not gonna come\nknocking on your door while you're\nmeditating and you're just going to\nattract him or her into your life\nthe missing piece a lot of times is that\nyou have to actually get up and take\naction okay i'm going to program my\nthoughts\nmy feelings which is my head my heart my\nbody\nto go and find this person that i want\nor to find that wealth that i want to\nfind whatever it is that i want and then\ni'm going to get my physical vibrating\nbody and put it out into the world to be\nable to actually go find these things\nthat's what i always find is missing\nwhen people talk about the law of\nattraction is what i like to call the\nlaw of action you got to get your ass up\nand get moving you got to do something\nyou got your mind you're working on your\nmind but is your body out there in the\nactual physical universe\ngoing where you can talk to other people\nof the opposite sex\nright\naround people who happen to have the\nbusiness that you want so if i want to\nattract the perfect woman into my life\nright\nand and i'm sitting there if you're out\nthere you're a single guy and you're\nlike i want to attract the perfect woman\ni'm just ready to i'm ready to stop\nplaying games i want to attract her\nthat's what you're thinking right\nyou can meditate on her all day long but\nshe's not going to come knocking at your\ndoor so you got to meditate meditate you\nknow get the vibration how do you feel\nabout it are you starting to actually\nfeel that maybe a real relationship is\nsomething that you're you're going to\nsettle into like is your body at that\nvibrational frequency and it sounds\nweird i understand the vibrational\nfrequency and all that stuff but you can\nask yourself do i feel ready to attract\nthe right person do i feel ready to\nbring in the right person into my life\nand you can feel in your body the\nrelaxed state that it can get into then\nyour physical body you've actually got\nto leave your house right you've got to\nleave your house and go to places where\nyou think that person might be\nand what happens is whether you realize\nit or not\nthe same way that you're vibing with\nsomebody\nthey also need to be vibing with you so\nyou might\nmight find somebody right now and they\nmight be the perfect person for you but\nbecause you haven't changed your\nvibrational frequency\nto them it doesn't feel right\nso if you work on yourself that's why\nthey always say if you want to if you\nwant to find the perfect person become\nthat perfect person first because then\nyou're going to match them vibrationally\nand then it's going to be good vibes\nbetween the two of you constructive\ninterference versus destructive\ninterference aka bad vibes so you can't\njust meditate that person into your life\nright\nsame way that if you want to have a\nmillion dollars in a bank account\nyou need to program and consciously\nthink about this money that you want to\nmake and you've got to consciously\nbrainwash yourself into believing that\nthis is actually true\nbut then you've also got to get out and\ngo make the money the money's not just\ngoing to show up and you're not going to\njust you know ding dong fedex is here at\nyour bank you know is that your is that\nyour front door and they just drop a\nmillion dollars in cash no you've got to\nphysically and mentally working yourself\nso that your vibration is at the right\nfrequency so therefore you go out and\nwhen the right opportunity or person or\nplace or thing comes into your life you\ngo that's it right there that's the\nthing that i was working for it and it\nmight not you might not think it's right\nbut it actually feels right the reason\nwhy it feels right is because your\nvibration is lining up with that\nvibration so when they say attract\nthings into your life\nwith the law of attraction this is what\nit's talking about what you think about\nwill be stored into your subconscious\nyour subconscious will change your\nvibration that vibration is at a certain\nfrequency and you will only line up\nand get things that line up with that\nyou know only get things that line up\nwith that that frequency if you think\nyou're going to be poor your whole life\nyou're going to be poor your whole life\nif you think you're going to be wealthy\nto at a cellular level deep down\nyou'll eventually be wealthy it's going\nto come to you if you think that people\nare always there to screw you over and\nthat men are there are going to screw\nyou over and cheat on you then you're\ngoing to find a lot of those people\nbecause those people line up with the\nreality line up with the frequency that\nyou're vibrating at you're going to find\nonly those people\nbut if you switch it around\nand you truly believe that the right\nperson for you is out there as long as\nyou get yourself out there that person\nis going to find you you're going to\nfind them and when you do find you're\ngoing to match vibrationally which is\nhow the law of attraction works so i've\ndone past lessons talking about the law\nof attraction but now we're going to\ntalk about how to actually use that in\nyour life and one of the things it comes\ndown to immediately and i want to start\noff before we go any further\nis to tell you this if you want to\nattract quote unquote the life you want\nif you want to manifest the life you\nwant or if you just want to create the\nlife that you truly want the first thing\nthat you need to start doing is to stop\nfocusing on what you don't want\nso i'm gonna take a take a pause and i'm\ngonna ask you a question before you go\nany further\nwhen you were if you were to take\nyourself out of your own head\nand look at\neverything that you think throughout the\ncourse of the day between your 60 to 80\n000 thoughts that you have every single\nday which is about average for a human\nare you focusing and thinking more about\nwhat you want\nor are you focusing about more of what\nyou don't want what you fear what you're\nworried about because what you focus on\nyou will get more of and the reason why\ni'm doing this episode is because my\ngirlfriend lauren and i we were driving\nabout three nights ago we were driving\nback from dinner and we were just\ntalking about life and about how i feel\nlike basically all of my dreams have\ncome true like i don't really have a\nwhole lot of goals because i'm like damn\ni kind of checked them all off the list\nwhich is awesome\nbut i feel like i am the creator of my\nreality like i feel like i created this\nlife now obviously i've had people that\nhelped me i had mentors along the way no\nman is an island but\ni feel like i created this as if i was a\npainter that walked up to a blank canvas\nand just wrote down exactly what i want\nand i drew out this perfect life and i\ncreated it\nand one joke that my mom and i have had\nfor a really long time since i got\nstarted getting into personal\ndevelopment about 15 years ago since i\ngot into the law of attraction and\ntrying to manifest things\nis that i tell my mom and i've told her\nbecause she's always like how do you\nalways she's like you always get what\nyou want\nand i'm like most of the time i do get\nwhat i want and the reason why\nand here's a secret this is what i told\nmy girlfriend the other day\nis the opposite of what i want so first\noff actually before i say that\ni know exactly what i want i'm very\nclear on exactly what i want i'm very\nclear on the the life i've wanted to\ncreate the lifestyle i've wanted to\ncreate the traveling that i've wanted to\ndo the money that i want to make the\nperson that i want to attract into my\nlife the people that i want to be\nsurrounded by i'm very very clear on all\nof those\nthe reason why i happen to get those\nthings in my life\nis because the opposite of what i want\ndoesn't even\nexist in my reality\nin my head i never go to fear that i\nwon't get what i want worry that\nsomething could come up in the way worry\nabout other people's opinions the\nopposite of what i want doesn't even\nexist in my reality so why do i get the\nlife that i why do i have the life that\ni've created is because\nnothing else exists in my reality i'm\nwalking up to a blank canvas and i'm\npainting whatever the i want to create\nright so when you think about your life\nare you thinking of your life the exact\nsame way or are you thinking about the\nthings that you don't want are you\nfocusing on worry and fear and sadness\nand all of the negative emotions right\nso i can give you many examples in my\nlife first off since i'm already talking\nwith my girlfriend my girlfriend\ndidn't want to date me when she first\nmet me she didn't want a boyfriend at\nall she just got every relationship a\ncouple months before and i was like hey\nthat's great and all but i think i'm\npretty good i think you're pretty good i\nthink would be a good match and\neventually she was like oh i do like\nthis guy right so\nshe was like yeah she tells a story all\nthe time i didn't i wasn't i wasn't in\nthe mood i didn't want to date people i\nwas just kind of having a great time by\nmyself\nbut i was like i really like this girl\ni'm really attracted her i think that we\nfit really well and now we've been\ntogether for years\nand you know because i just feel like\nthat's what i wanted and in turn she was\nlike oh i'm starting to see who this guy\ntruly is right so the first thing i can\nthink of is is with lauren when i was\nyounger way before that\ni used to sell knives i worked for a\ncompany called cutco and i was never\nbeen in sales before but all i wanted to\ndo was be the very best\nsales rep that i possibly could be so i\nwas like you know what i'm going to be\nnumber one in the office there is no\nother option i i will not be anything\nother than that\nright\nand so i built up some coffees i built\nsome confidence and eventually became\nnumber one in the the office that i was\nin in tampa then i became a manager with\nthe company i was like i will not lose\nto anybody else because i feel like i am\nthe best that exists i'm out there and\nit was just this inward belief it's\nnever a\ncockiness or anything like that it's\njust this this confidence this inward\nbelief that i know who i am i know what\ni deserve and i know what i can do and\nmy capabilities so i'm going to go and\ni'm going to create it so then i built\nmy office someone off this united states\nright\nthen i left there because i was like i\nfeel like i've done everything that i\ncan and then i decided to you know go\ninto the corporations that i went into\nand i was the youngest sales rep in\nthose companies but still also became\nthe number one sales rep in those\ncompanies i decided to start a podcast\nbecame you know the the top motivational\npodcast on all of itunes we're going to\ndo about 50 million downloads in the\nnext year\nand and then i decided to start a\nfacebook page and have my videos start\nto go viral so i put time into figuring\nall of those things out you know we're\nabout 1.5 billion views on facebook and\ni don't say these things to brag in any\nsort of way i just say them because\nnumber one\ni know what i want\nnumber two the opposite of what i want\nfailure doesn't exist in my mind it\ndoesn't exist in my reality if it\ndoesn't exist in my reality and i am the\ncreator of my reality then there's\nabsolutely no way that i will fail\nso that's number two and the number\nthree\ni just don't give up\ni don't i don't i i don't see anything\nas failure unless you give up and so i\njust decide\nslow and steady wins the race life is a\nmarathon business is a marathon\neverything's a marathon i'm going to put\nevery ounce of energy that i have into\nwhatever this thing is that i want\nand i'm not going to do anything else\nuntil i succeed at it right\nso i don't say any of these things to\nbrag i just say because this is my\nperspective what the past 15 years have\nbeen for me\nand how i've created what i have and it\ncomes down to what i tend to focus on\nright and i say this a lot to i teach\ncoaches how to impact the world and how\nto make money and how to grow their\ncoaching businesses and one thing that i\nalways say to them is\ndon't focus on this not working out like\nif you're trying to build this coaching\nbusiness not working out should not\nexist in your reality\nright because if it does and you're\nfocusing on\nwhat if this doesn't work out what if i\ncan't pay my bills what if this person\nsays no to me what if one of my clients\ncancels you're probably going to create\nthat in your reality but if you step up\nand you say this will be the business\nthat makes me the dreams the dream life\nthat i want i'm going to impact the\nworld i'm going to do this and this and\nthis and that's the only other option\nthat exists for them then that's what\nthey're going to create right so i want\nto pause and take a step back and when\nyou hear me talk about these things the\nfirst thing i want to say is i haven't\nalways been this confident in my\ncapabilities this is 15 years of working\non myself and actually seeing how this\nworks and understanding the law of\nattraction understanding manifestation\nunderstanding even if the law of\nattraction manifestation are not things\nthat you focus on or they're not in\nreality they sound too woo-woo we for\nyou\ni think that i'm a creator\nand i'm creating my reality at every\nsingle moment with every single thought\nand with every single action\nwith that being said when you listen to\nmy story and you think back of your\nstory\nwhen you think about the things that you\nfocus on you think about the thoughts in\nyour head the 60 to 80 000 thoughts\nevery single day are they focusing on\neverything that you want\nor everything that you don't want\nthink about that for a second\nare you concentrating on building the\nlife that you want or are you\nconcentrating on i hope this doesn't i\nhope i don't fail i hope other people\ndon't judge me i hope this person\ndoesn't cancel their order i hope this\nworks out for me right and so you have\nto\nhave this internal confidence that will\nbe built it will the more that you do it\nthe more you if you try this out and it\nworks for you you'll gain a little bit\nof confidence you try it out you get\nworks for you gain a little bit more\nconfidence and more and more and more\nand over years it just compiles into i\ndon't lose and that's what you'll start\nto get to is just you won't lose winners\nwin and when you step into becoming a\nwinner and you have that winner's\nmentality\nlosing doesn't exist\nit doesn't because you just won't give\nup right\nand so\nlike i told you my mom says i get\neverything that i wanted always it\nalways she always makes a joke on it i\njust feel like i'm kind of dancing with\nthe universe like i don't know the way\nthe universe works and i don't think i\never will i don't think i'm ever going\nto be that intelligent god the universe\nwhatever is out there i just feel like\nwe're kind of in a dance\nand we're having a tango and i'm moving\nand it's moving and we're figuring it\nout together and\nand i don't even like to you know it's\nhard to use the right words because when\ni say the life that you want\ni'm also taking a step back in my head\nbecause i don't even necessarily know if\nthe word want\nis the best word because want\nis a word that comes from a place of\nlack right a place of i don't have this\nthing in order to be a powerful creator\nyou have to create from a place of\nabsolute certainty\nand pure fulfillment as to where you\ncurrently are so when i want something a\nlot of times i'm wanting something\ncoming from a place of lack\ni don't have this thing and this thing\nthat i want will complete me in some\nsort of way right that's the reason why\na lot of relationships don't work out is\nbecause people want to get into the\nrelationship because they are their\nquote-unquote better half or because\nthey complete them no it's not\nyou know this person completes me it is\nthat you are already a complete person\nthey are already a complete person and\nthe two of you together\nmake a really freaking powerful couple\nright it's not like i'm i'm incomplete\nwithout this person that person's\nincomplete without me we're we're you\nknow two halves no it's like your hole\nthey're whole and you're creating\nsomething amazing so\ni hesitate saying that this is the life\nthat you want\nbecause i feel like it comes from a\nplace of lack but i'm really running out\nof words to use here so we're just going\nto have to use those words\nbut you know it's not even it's not even\nthat you want it it's that you are\nabsolutely certain that it will happen\nyou know so how can you\nbrainwash yourself in a sense to being\nlike my future that i want is going to\nhappen and so when people usually hear\nabout the law of attraction they hear\nabout manifestation they think that\nthey're supposed to go into some\nyou know nirvana state and meditate and\nthey're going to start floating and then\nthey're going to say oh money is freeing\nfreely flowing into my life from all\nlayers of the universe and the perfect\nlover that i've always wanted my entire\nlife is going to be knocking at my door\nsoon like all that stuff's beautiful\nthat's what you want to do but i just\nhappen to be a very you know analytical\nlogical person and i'm like you know\nwhat\ninstead of actually sitting there and\njust\nmeditating on the idea i'm going to\nfully embody the idea there's nothing\nwrong with meditating on i promise you\nthat i do meditate as well but it's like\ni'm with with every action that i take i\nam going to be\nthe person that will create this life\nand i am going to create this reality\nfrom absolute certainty\nso i know that for some of you guys this\nprobably is a big step because maybe you\nhaven't\ngotten amazing results in everything\nthat you've been wanting to do in your\nlife and so to think okay i and if i\nlook in my past\ni don't have a whole lot of examples of\nmassive success from me\nright i've been there before i\nunderstand exactly what you're talking\nabout if that's sitting in the back of\nyour head\nbut you have to be able to strip away\nthe past and strip away the present say\nhey none of those things actually matter\nat all for the future that i'm going to\ncreate and so i've got to in my head\nstart from a place of absolute certainty\nwhat do i need to do to start from a\nplace of absolute certainty well i need\nto strip away the past and need to strip\naway the present need to say the future\nis being written at any moment every\nmoment everything that i do\ni've gotta number one be very clear on\nwhat it is that i want you guys have\nheard it said in ancient texts the bible\nall of them they say ask and it shall be\ngiven right\nwell if you're going to ask for\nsomething if you're going to focus on\nsomething you better be very very clear\non exactly what it is that you want\nso the first part\nof creating this absolute certainty is\nnumber one be very clear on what it is\nthat you want because when you're very\nvery clear on what it is that you want\nit makes it easier to go and hit it\nyou've heard me say it before if i were\nto take you and the number one archer in\nthe entire world and have you two line\nup and shoot a bow and arrow at\nsomething some target they're gonna beat\nyou every single time but if you\nblindfold them and spin them around so\nthey don't know what direction they're\nfacing and then you are able to you know\nliterally see the target and have\nnothing over your eyes you have a better\nchance of hitting it not because you're\nbetter simply because you can see the\ntarget so the more clear that you can be\non what it is that you want to create in\nyour life the more likely it is that\nyou're going to be able to create it\nright we are all conscious creators we\nare creating at every moment of our\nlives the exact life that we want right\nyou are creating it if you focus on what\nyou want\nyou will create more of those things\nthat you want you will notice the people\nplaces opportunities things in front of\nyou that will create that if you're\nfocusing on what you don't want you will\nnotice and create the people places\nopportunities and things that will\ncreate the reality of what it is that\nyou don't want right you've heard me\ntalk about this before there's a part of\nyour brain called the reticular\nactivating system that is basically the\nbrain's filtering system\nat any moment in time your brain could\nif it would probably explode if you were\nto be able to take all this in take in\nabout 2 trillion bits of information but\nit only takes in 200 bits of information\nper second so your reticular activating\nsystem is the filtering system and so if\nyou're going into your day and you know\nwhat it is that you want but you're\nthinking to yourself\nyeah i'm not i'm not good enough i don't\nknow if i'm going to be able to do this\nthen your reality is going to show you\nall of the places that you are not good\nenough why simply because your reticular\nactivating system the filtering system\nis going to find all of the places that\nyou're not good enough\nyour brain is basically like cosmic\ngoogle whatever you ask of it it will\nfind the answer to\nyou ever have any friends that have\nterrible relationship problems and\nthey're like why do i always find the\nguys that cheat right if you ask\nyourself that question brain's gonna go\nit's gonna pull up all of the answers as\nto why you only find the guys that cheat\nbut if someone were to ask that\ndifferent question say why do i deserve\nto have somebody who's loyal\nyour brain's gonna pull up all the\nanswers which one are you focusing on\non all of the people who are the\ncheaters and why you find them\nor on why you deserve to have someone\nthat's loyal\nright if you focus on what you don't\nwant you will get what you don't want\nbecause your reticular activating system\nis\nfocused on those things if you focus on\nwhat you do want you will get more of\nwhat you do want so if you know exactly\nwhat it is that you want and you set\nyour reticular activating system to go\nand get it once again the people places\nopportunities things will pop up in your\nlife and show you\nwhere you could possibly move forward in\nthe direction that you're looking for so\nyou have to be very clear of what you're\nlooking for a perfect example of this is\ni went a few years ago my friend it was\nhis birthday and we went on these really\nfast go-karts seem like 50 miles an hour\nand the guy who owned this track here in\naustin is an xf1 driver he used to\nactually drive an f1\nsuper funny nice french guy making jokes\nthe whole time as he's explaining\neverything to us and then he got really\nserious at one moment and he said listen\nto me looks everybody straight in the\neye he says if there is a crash which\nthere will be and my friends are kind of\ncrazy so there were a lot of them he\nsaid do not look at the crash because\nyou will hit them you've got to look at\nwhere you want to go and i was like\nthat makes so much sense that's exactly\nhow life is because if you look at the\ncrash what you don't want you will hit\nthe car in front of you\nyou ever see a car on the side of the\nroad on the interstate and they're not\nmoving but somehow some cars just end up\nhitting them even though they're not\nmoving because the person was looking at\nit so what are you looking at are you\nlooking at where you want to go or are\nyou looking at the crash where you don't\nwant to go\nif you've ever been you know if you've\nanybody who listens rides a motorcycle\nknows someone who does\nthey say look through the turn right so\ndon't look at where you are when you're\nin a turn on a motorcycle you're looking\nat where you want to go because your\nbody your brain will position you to get\nto that spot so you don't look at where\nyou don't want to go you only look at\nwhere it is that you're trying to go the\nsame way with your go-karts same with\nyour motorcycles is exactly how it works\nin life you look and you focus on only\nwhat it is that you want to go and you\ndon't have any other example that pops\ninto your head\nif you're a salesperson out there the\nthing that i teach my the the coaches\nthat i teach you know a lot of people in\nsales people say this is oh i hope this\nperson doesn't say no to me\nversus\ni'm going to have this this person is\ngoing to buy from me so instead of\nthinking i'm going this person is going\nto buy for me people think i hope this\nperson doesn't say no and if you go into\nit with the energy\nof i hope this person doesn't say no\nwhat do you think they're more likely to\ndo\nto say no\nright everything in life is energy but\nif you go into it if i if i just think\nabout the energetic state of my body of\nthis person's going to buy\nin what type of state that would put my\nbody in and how that would change my\nphysiology how that would change my\nvoice to i hope this person doesn't say\nno\nright like there's a different\nenergetic state that both of them\nput me into this person's definitely\ngoing to buy and i'm going to change\ntheir life\nor\ni hope this person doesn't say no\nand how that energy is going to\ntranslate to the other person\nthey're probably gonna say no\nright you ever you ever walked into a\nroom and started talking to someone and\nimmediately you got\num yeah this doesn't feel right it was\nbad feelings we've all been there before\nright and then something happens down\nthe road that shows you oh yeah my\noriginal feeling about that person i was\nright\nyou ever also had feelings though\nyou meet somebody and immediately you're\nlike i feel like i've known this person\nforever and become great friends\nit's the energy\nthink about how the thoughts of what i\njust said\nchange the energy of how you go in to\nwhat it is that you do it changes the\nemotion into it emotion is energy in\nmotion\ne motion energy and motion so if i think\nthoughts it's going to change my energy\nin the way that i feel it's going to\nchange the way that i act which is going\nto change my results in my physical\nworld\nbecause everything is energy\nand you can sense when energy is on you\ncan sense what energy is off\nbut the key to it is you have to think\nabout the thoughts that are going\nthrough your head at any moment in time\nevery moment in time are the thoughts\nthat are going through my head getting\nme closer to or further from my goals am\ni focusing on what i want or what i\ndon't want\nand you have to literally analyze every\nsingle thought that you have and it'll\ntake some time it'll take time to get\nused to i've been doing this now for 15\n16 years now but i have so much proof of\nhow my thoughts\nchange my energy\nchange my actions change my reality and\nso what it takes is is ultimate self\nself awareness you've got to think about\nevery single thought that's coming\nthrough you've got to think about every\nenergetic state that you get into you\ngot to think about every action that you\nhave and it takes time it takes a lot of\nmental energy when you first get into\nthis but then what happens is you start\nto change your thoughts you change your\nthoughts you change your thoughts and\nnow instead of being habitualized to\nthink negative thoughts and think about\nwhat you don't want you start being\nhabitualized to think positive thoughts\nin what is it you do want because at any\nmoment in time\nevery single thought that you have is\ncreating your reality\nbut\nyou've got to think about this\nare the thoughts that you are having\ncreating the reality that you want if\nyou change your thoughts\nyou change your reality you change your\nfuture make sure that you know what it\nis that you want\nand then make sure that every thought\nthat you have lines up with that future\nthat you want\nand\nthat will then manifest the future in\nthe life that you want today we're going\nto be talking about the incredible\nfuture that you want that seems and i\nget it sometimes when you think about\nthe life that you could have the life\nthat's in your dreams the the cars the\nhouses the love the spouse the family\nthe traveling the private jet whatever\nit is that you want you think oh my gosh\nit would be so nice to have this thing\nbut what we tend to do is by having that\nfeeling of it would be nice what we're\nactually doing is we're actually pushing\nthat thing away from us energetically\nbecause the the would be nice feeling\nactually makes it feel like ah never\ngonna happen can you relate to that\nwhere you have the feeling of\nman i would love to have that house on\nthe water it's beautiful it's amazing\nbut\nthree million dollars i don't know if i\ncould ever afford three million dollars\nright and what you're doing is you're\nactually pushing yourself further away\nfrom the life that you want from\neverything that you want because of the\nfeeling of\ni just don't know if it's possible so\ntoday we're going to talk about is how\nto normalize the feeling of the success\nthat you want and when i when i talk\nabout normalizing i'm talking about\nnormalizing energetically inside of your\nbody how it feels to think about those\nthings how it feels to think about\nowning those things and how it feels to\nthink about you being the person that\ncould\nattract all of that success all of that\nhappiness all of that love all of that\nlife that you truly want because the\nhouse the car the family the love the\ntravel all of those things the easiest\nway to get those and this is going to be\nkind of a a mind mess up for most you\nguys the easiest way to get all of the\nstuff that you want in the future\nis to have them before you have them\nand you're like what the hell does that\nmean\nto have them and to feel them\nenergetically and understand for some of\nyou guys that are analytical or you're\nlike this sounds like some mu lui bs\ntrust me on this i i get it i've i\nunderstand this i'm extremely analytical\nbut also i can dip my toes into the woo\nwooi stuff that's out there as well the\neasiest way to have the life that you\nwant is to have it before you have it\nright so for those of you that are like\ni don't get it you're gonna get it just\nfollow along with me okay\nthis is the reason why\npeople who grow up rich\nit's a lot easier for them to make money\nright because energetically\nit's just normal for them and what i\nmean energetically i'm talking about the\nfeeling inside of your body when i grew\nup and i used to look at people who had\nmoney there was a part of me that was\nlike i don't know if i'll ever have it i\ndon't know if i'll ever get there right\ncan you relate if you've if you've grown\nup not having a whole lot of money have\nyou ever had the feeling of i don't know\nif i can do it though right i've had\nthose feelings and most people have\nthose feelings as well those feelings\ninside of your body are what's holding\nyou back from actually getting it right\nit's the reason why people who grow up\nwith money\nend up usually making a lot of money not\nalways but usually it's just easier for\nthem it's not too hard it's not as much\nto struggle and the reason why is\nbecause it's not too far\ndown the road for them\nthey're already in the road they're\nalready on the road they already know\nexactly what it is that you need to do\nit's simple\nit's just\nnormal\nthat's what i mean by normalizing if\nthey grew up in a mansion well then it's\nkind of just the standard to live in a\nmansion isn't it and so when they see\nother mansions they're like oh my god\nlook at those mansions they're amazing\nit's just like oh yeah well\nyeah we have one as well it's normal it\ndoesn't feel like it's too far away but\nthis is also the reason why it's so hard\nto break free from where you currently\nare is because where you are feels\nnormal\nand then the more normal that you feel\nthe more uncomfortable it can feel to\nlook at those things that seem so far\nout of your grasp they don't seem like\nsomething that you could ever get\nright and so you have to normalize the\nfeeling\nand i'll teach you how to do that today\nand i'll give you an example of a\nfeeling that is normalized have you ever\num\ngone to a friend's house maybe maybe\nyour friend has a house you become\nfriends with someone who happens to have\na an incredible house and you walk up to\ntheir house and the first time you're in\nit you're just blown away it's beautiful\nyou love the pool you love the house you\nlove the decorating you love the view\nyou love everything about it the first\ntime you're there you're almost like\nholy crap this is just so incredible and\nthen you go to their house again and\nagain and again and again and again and\nthe more that you go to it it's not like\nyou aren't impressed by the house\nanymore but it's just like oh yeah i'm\njust going over to stacy's house i'm\njust going over to john's house i'm\ngoing over stacey and john's right and\nyou're still like wow this house is\nbeautiful but it doesn't blow you away\nevery single time it blows you away the\nfirst time and then what happens it\nstarts to become normal to go to stacy\nand john's that's really what it is\nright when i first moved into the house\nthat i have now i remember when i first\nwalked in and i saw it i was like holy\nsh i love this house it's amazing i've\nnever lived in a house like this i've\nnever\nseen a house like this with this design\nand i was just blown away by it and then\ni realized about a month into being here\ni was like this just feels normal and i\nwas outside and i was you know the dogs\nwere outside go in the bathroom and i\nlooked back and i was like i love this\nhouse\nbut it feels normal to be here now like\nit doesn't feel like oh my god it's\namazing it was just like ah it you know\nit's the house i live in which is\nawesome right i love it\nbut it feels normal\nit's a good thing normalizing the\nfeeling so i remember when i was a kid i\nwas lucky enough where even though i\ndidn't grow up with a lot of money i was\nlucky enough in my opinion to have an\naunt and uncle who my uncle made great\nmoney he had a business that was doing\nyou know 20 million dollars a year and\nhe had a nice house and a nice car he\nlived in a gated community that was on\nthe water on the the beach in florida\nsiesta key florida which is super nice\nbeach and um and it's the nicest\ncommunity the nicest gated community\nthat's on siesta key beach and you know\nyou would go into the gated community\nand he used to have a golf cart and my\ncousin and i would drive the golf cart\naround and i remember being a kid\nconsciously\n13 14 years old 15 years old whatever it\nis that we were you know younger so we\nwere driving the golf cart and we would\ngo and look at these houses and i was\nlike these houses are amazing these i'm\ngonna and i would tell myself all the\ntime when i was a kid i'm gonna live in\na house like this one day i'm gonna live\nin a house like this one day i'm gonna\nlive in a house like this one day and i\nwould just drive around and i didn't\nrealize i had no idea what the hell i\nwas doing but what i was doing is i was\nstarting to normalize the feeling of\nbeing around houses that were massive\ni was in houses that were on the beach\nwith beautiful views and ferraris and\nlamborghinis outside i was just i was\nnormalizing that feeling right so i was\nlucky enough to be around people like\nthat i was also lucky enough to see that\nmy uncle is one of the kindest people\ni've ever met and so sometimes it when\nyou're when you don't grow up with money\nand you don't see a whole lot of money\nyou can see how sometimes people with\nmoney can be demonized in the media and\npeople can talk trash about them but\ni've said it many times in my podcast\nsome of the kindest best people i've\never met in my entire life have\nboatloads of money and they're kind and\nthey're amazing and they're beautiful\npeople and that makes you realize oh\nthey're not as bad as they tend to seem\nin the media sometimes right so\ni was lucky enough to be around people\nlike that and so i think that for me\nthe transition from not making much\nmoney to making a good amount of money\nwas easier because i was around it and i\nwas normalizing myself for years now if\nyou haven't been around somebody with\nmoney or any of that type of stuff it\ndoesn't mean that you can't normalize\nthe feeling i won't even lie to you when\ni first moved to austin i used to\nthere's there's a couple areas in austin\nthat are gated and i just love driving\naround and looking at houses and i love\ni've always thought to myself i want to\nnormalize the feeling of being in houses\nlike this and being in neighborhoods\nlike this and so what i would do is no\njoke if i saw a neighborhood that i\nreally liked i would park across the\nstreet and just wait for someone to\ndrive in and i would just follow them in\nwhy because i want i love to be able to\ndream\nright i love to be able to think that\nthis could be mine not because i just\nwant to own more\nbut because i want to see\nwhat it would take from me to become the\ntype of person to get something like\nthat right think about that for a second\nwhat would it take for me to be the\nperson to be able to get that thing that\nhouse or that you know car you know i\nwas in a place the other day that i\nfollowed somebody in and they had a\nhelicopter outside of their house and i\nwas like that's pretty sick i've never\njust seen someone's helicopter sitting\noutside i thought it was amazing so\nthere's there's examples of things like\nthis\na good friend of mine\ntells this amazing story of how he he\nnormalized the house that he wanted so\nhe knew what part of town he wanted to\nlive in and this is in austin he lives\nout in the hills now and uh there was\nthis big beautiful house was being built\nand he was driving by it one day this\nbig beautiful modern house and it wasn't\nfinished and you know big houses take\ntime to to finish right they take years\nsometimes to finish he saw this big\nbeautiful house and he he was like i'm\ngoing to pull over and just see what the\nhouse looks like and it was in the\nmiddle of construction there was nobody\nthere it was like on the weekend or\nsomething like that or at night and um\nand so literally he walked into the\nhouse and he's like holy crap like i can\nsee it's got a pool i can see it starts\nto see the layout of the house i can see\nthe view of downtown austin through the\nhills and so what he did was every day\nand this is important every day\nhe will literally leave work he has his\nown business but he would leave work and\nhe would tell himself i'm driving home\ni'm driving home i'm driving home i'm\ndriving home\nevery single day he would drive to that\nhouse first\nand he would get out\npark his car in the driveway you know\nhe'd get done with work six seven\no'clock so usually the guys aren't doing\nconstruction by the time and he would\nliterally walk into the house walk into\nthe front door and say i'm walking into\nthe front door of my house he would walk\nin and he would literally\nstart to go through the house and say\nthis is my bedroom this is my and you\nknow some of you guys are like that's\nkind of creepy the guy's walking through\nthe house it's not his nah it can't be\ncreepy whatever but you know no judgment\nand then he would go to the view and he\nwould he would visualize himself sitting\nthere and drinking his cup of coffee\nevery single morning i'm gonna drink my\ncoffee this video drink this coffee this\nfood he would normalize it day in day\nout day in day out day in day out and it\nbecame normal the feeling of the house\nwent from holy crap this view holy crap\nthis house holy crap this layout too\nthis is my house i just haven't paid i\njust haven't paid for it yet right i'd\nrecommend you don't do this to anybody\nwho actually lives in a house this will\nonly be for construction right don't go\nto someone's house and be like this is\nmy house when you knock on their door\nbut you know go you can go to the house\nand you went to the house and eventually\nthe house was finished and the people\nwho actually paid for the house moved\ninto the house and then one day\nit went on the market\nand he went in to go see how much it was\nand it was over a million dollars for\nthe house and uh he went in to see if he\ncould afford it and the bank said he\ncouldn't afford the loan but he said\nthis is my house this is my house this\nmy house and over the next 30 days he\nwas able to build his business to a such\na significant number he went back into\nbecause you know this is before austin's\nmarket was just insane like it is now he\nwent back into the loan officer and\nasked them show them what his business\nwas doing it was able to make it work he\nbought that house four years after\nnormalized the feeling of that being his\nhouse you could tell me that's a\ncoincidence if you want to\nbut there's also something behind the\nscenes that i think is working right\nwhether it's the universe or god or\nwhether it's just the normalizing of the\nfeeling or maybe it is coincidence he\nwas able to normalize the feeling of\nthat being his house that being the\nhouse that he was going to now what does\nhe do he walks into his house he parks\ninside of his driveway he sleeps in the\nroom he told himself he would sleep in\nhe has coffee every single morning with\nthe view that he told himself he was\ngoing to have coffee with the viewers\nwhy because he freaking created his\nreality\nright so you got to think to yourself\nwhich reality am i creating what\nfeelings am i normalizing am i\nnormalizing the feelings of being broke\nbecause i'm hanging out with broke\npeople all of the time\nright and they're talking about how you\nknow the it's the government's fault\nit's the president's fault it's my\nboss's fault it's the the local\nauthorities faults whatever it is that's\ngoing on around them and they're like\nthey're blaming they're taking all of\nthe blame and externally putting on\nsomeone else or are you hanging out with\npeople who make you know making a decent\namount of money normal to you to feel\nthat way right\nwhat car do you want\nwhy don't you go test drive it guess how\nmuch it costs to test drive a car\nnothing so if you have a car and it's on\nthe background of your computer like\nwhen i was younger used to have cars in\nthe background my computer background my\nphone all that stuff i want to see it i\nwanted to normalize it why don't you\ninstead of having it be on a computer\nwhich seems out of reach because you\ncan't physically touch that car through\nyour computer why don't you go to the\naudi dealership or whatever it is and\ntest drive that car\neven if you can't afford it right now\nand as you're driving the car say\nthis is my car i'm driving my car i'm\ndriving my car i'm driving my car i'm\ndriving my car and then go a month later\nand do it again\nand then go a month later and do it\nagain and just keep test driving the\ncars and go to different places and\nstart to normalize the feeling if you\nhave a you know a toyota right now\nthere's nothing wrong with it but if\nyou're looking and you're like i want an\naudi well then as you're actually going\nto the audi dealership say i'm going to\npick up my car i'm going to pick up my\ncar i'm going to pick up my car and then\nyou test drive it and when you get back\ninto your toyota you're going to go damn\ni am grateful that i do have this car\nthat can drive me around but that audi\nwas amazing\nit's gonna give you internal drive to\nwork harder towards that thing that you\nsaw towards that thing that you want\nit's going to normalize the feelings\ninside of you of actually having that\nwhat if you want a great relationship\nare there people around you that have\nincredible relationships and you know\nmaybe you grew up in a house that didn't\nyour parents didn't have a great\nrelationship maybe they fought a lot\nmaybe they got divorced and all you've\never seen was turmoil in a relationship\nis there someone that you know or people\nthat you can get around that have an\nincredible relationship so that you can\ndenormalize the feeling\nof turmoil in a relationship and\nnormalize the feeling of what an\nabundant beautiful loving relationship\nlooks like if you want to be a great\nparent maybe have your first kid on the\nway\ndo you know anybody that's an incredible\nparent that you can normalize the\nfeelings of being an incredible parent\nanything that you want in this world is\nwithin reach but if you look at\nsomething and you think to yourself\ni don't know like energetically it feels\ntoo much to me it feels like it's\nimpossible that is something that needs\nto be normalized because if you feel\nlike it's impossible it is 100\nimpossible if it feels like it's out of\nreach it is always going to be out of\nreach the way to bring it into reach\nis to be able to start to to to live\nthat life to normalize the feeling of\nthat house to normalize the feeling of\nthat card to normalize the feeling of\nthat relationship to normalize the\nfeeling of being a great parent to\nnormalize whatever it is that you want\nbecause everything that you want is\nfully 100 within your reach but if you\nthink to yourself that it is out of\nreach i promise you you've already taken\nyourself out of the race before you've\neven stepped up to the line the way to\nwin in life is to figure out what is it\nyou want and to normalize those feelings\nbecause the life that you want is within\nreach that 10 years from now that\nperfect life that beautiful family that\ntravels all over the place and has the\nabundance of money to do whatever they\nwant and to give it away and give it to\ncharity all of that is within reach but\nyou have to normalize the feeling\ninternally first before you actually get\nit externally the question i have for\nyou is do you think that it's possible\nthat you are being subconsciously\nprogrammed and you're completely unaware\nof it\ndoes that scare you\nwould it make you pay more attention to\nyour surroundings and every single thing\nthat you did if you were subconsciously\nbeing programmed completely out of your\nawareness well\nyou just might be and i'm going to give\nyou a couple stories that make you\nrealize how possible it is and how\nlittle people understand what's actually\ngoing on so i'm going to give you a\ncouple stories about it one of them\nthere was a study that was done about\nsomething called unconscious priming\nunconscious priming you can google it\nyou can look it up if you'd like to but\nyale did a study to see if they could\nchange the way that somebody feels about\nsomething simply by the temperature of\nthe coffee that they're holding on to\nand so what happened was they had these\nthese uh students come in\nthey would come in and the researcher\nwould meet them down in the bottom floor\nand they would say hey good to meet you\nand then what they would do is they\nwould say they'd hop into an elevator\nand they had a lot of stuff in their\nhands and they would notice the\nresearcher would notice that their shoe\nwas untied and what they would do is\nthey would have you know they go hey can\nyou hold my cup of coffee for me real\nquick and so they would hand them the\ncup of coffee they would put their stuff\ndown they would tie their shoe they'd\npick up their stuff and then they'd get\nthe cup of coffee back from them and\nthen the person that was part of the\nresearch but didn't know that they're\npart of the research at the time that\nwas part of the study that would go in\nand they would read a one-page story\nand it was just a typical story and then\nthey were given a quiz real quick quiz\nat the end of it where they were told to\nanswer questions about the person and\nyou know so they would take one\ncharacter from the story in one page and\nthen they would answer questions about\nthem\nand you know all they would do is they\nwould you know answer the questions then\nthey would go and what they realized was\nthis\nwas that even though they had just held\na cup of coffee\nfor about 15 seconds at most it changed\nthe way that they felt about the people\nthat they were reading about about 15\nminutes later so here's what happened\nthe people that were given an iced cup\nof coffee because there was ice cup of\ncoffee that was handed to people and\nthen there was a hot cup of coffee those\nhanded people people that were given the\niced coffee felt that the character that\nthey had the questions about was much\ncolder less social and more selfish\nthe people that were handed a hot cup of\ncoffee for the researcher to be able to\ntie their shoe felt that the person was\nwarmer more social in someone that they\ncould trust\nso let me pause right there\nthese people were given a cup of coffee\none of one set of people were given a\nhot cup of coffee one set of people were\ngiven a cold cup of coffee and across\nthe board statistically the people who\nwere given the cold cup of coffee felt\nthat the person was cold less social and\nmore selfish the people that were given\nthe hot cup of coffee felt that the\nperson was warm more social and somebody\nthey could trust so if they're given\nliterally\n15 seconds of holding on to a cup of\ncoffee and it changes their perception\naround the world around them and\neverything that they think about people\nwhat is happening in your world that is\nchanging your perception\nthink about that for a second how crazy\nis that that just a simple temperature\nof something that somebody holds for 15\nseconds can change the way they feel\nabout people 15 minutes later\nall right i got some more stories i'm\nnot done\nso there was also researchers that went\nin and they had students come into a\nroom\nand they had them answer questions or\nactually come up and see how creative\nthat they could be right and what they\ndidn't realize was that some students\nwent into this room and they were they\nconstantly like three or four times they\nsaw the logo for ibm because ibm was\njust you know it's ibm is seen as a\ntypical standard company not very\ncreative but there was you know they\nsaid okay we're gonna go ahead and we're\ngonna put something up on the board and\nthey'd turn the computer on they'd see\nthe ibm logo it would be right there and\nthen they'd be okay this is what we're\ngonna do and what they had people do was\nfigure out as many uses that they could\nuse for a brick besides what a brick is\nnormally used for besides like throwing\nthrough a window to break the window\nbesides you know building a house any of\nthat type of stuff what can you how can\nyou be creative\nso they had people see the ibm logo\nthree or four times before they were\nasked the question to write down what it\nwas that they could come up with you\nknow\nnon-typical uses for a brick and then\nthey had another set of people that\ninstead of seeing the ibm logo they were\nthey saw the apple logo and it wasn't\nlike they're like hey this is an\nadvertisement for apple it was just like\nthey happened to see it it was either in\nthe room somewhere or it just popped up\nas they went to go asking the questions\nnow if you look at the two companies\nbetween ibm and apple if you were to\nlook at the two of them you say ibm is a\npretty typical company not very creative\nnot outside the box you don't really see\na lot of advertisements form any of that\ntype of stuff when you look at apple\napple tends to be a very creative\ncompany people tend to think that\nthey're a creative company they trust\nthem a lot they have creative packaging\nthey love a lot of you know there's\npeople that are hardcore about apple i\ndon't know too many people that are\nhardcore about ibm\nhere's what's crazy exact same situation\njust different logos that they saw the\npeople that saw the apple logo\nfound three times more uses for a brick\nthan the people that saw the ibm logo\nisn't that pretty crazy simply because\npeople know\nthat they're when they deal with apple\napple is more creative so when they saw\nthe apple logo they became more creative\nin all of the uses that they could find\nand the reason why it works like this is\nbecause your brain doesn't just have\nlike one part of the brain that lights\nup so the same place that the brain\nwhere apple lies inside of your brain\ncan connect other neurosynaptic\nconnections in your brain for creativity\nand it starts working together the same\nway that when you hold on to a cup of\ncoffee and you feel cold it lights up a\ncertain part of your brain and that\ncertain part of your brain has other\nneurosynaptic connections around it so\nwhen you see something it doesn't just\naffect one part of your brain it affects\nmany parts of your brain it's not just\nlike one part of your brain turns on and\nthe rest of it is off and so it depends\non what's actually lighting up inside of\nyour brain another example of how this\nis used is grocery stores\nhere's something that's really\ninteresting okay\none of the best that i've that i find as\nfar as grocery stores that deal with\npeople and uh the way they they skew and\nchange your perception around everything\nis whole foods whole foods is one of the\nfirst ones to do this when you walk into\nwhole foods what do you almost always\nhave i'm thinking of whole foods that i\nwalk into that's right down the street\nflowers\nright flowers and fresh produce\nwhy because they want you to feel that\nthis is a\na fresh place to walk into because when\nyou walk into a place that has flowers\nyou can smell the flowers you can smell\nthe fresh produce it makes you feel as a\nhuman like we are sensory organisms we\nsee a bunch of really bright beautiful\ncolors we smell a bunch of beautiful\nscents it actually turns on parts of\nyour brain to go oh yeah this is great i\nreally like this this is i feel fresh in\nhere\ni've never walked into a grocery store\nand all of the dead animals and flesh\nwas in the front\nwhy because that'd be a really weird\nplace to put it where do they put the\nmeat in every single grocery store in\nthe very back\nwhy don't they put the meat in the front\nbecause that's not how they want you to\nwalk in they want you to walk in seeing\nbeautiful colors they want you to walk\nin smelling beautiful scents they don't\nwant you to walk in and just see dead\nanimal parts right there and you know\ni'm just telling you honestly how it is\nand so what happens with the fresh\nflowers with the fresh scents everything\nis it makes you a little bit more hungry\nand at the same time makes people feel\nbetter when they see beautiful colors\nand they smell beautiful scents so\nif this is what companies are doing and\nable to do with you at all points in\ntime do you think that in your life\nthere might be unconscious priming\nthat's happening around you that you're\ncompletely unaware of absolutely a\nhundred percent the best psychologists\nin the entire world work for advertising\nagencies right and i'm not trying to be\ndoom and gloom and i'm just trying to\nmake you aware of what's happening so\nthat you can start to program yourself\nand that's what we're going to do today\nbut advertising agencies know that at\nthe core of every human fear like fear\nthat holds you back at the core of every\nsingle one of them is the feeling of i'm\nnot enough and if i won't if i'm not\nenough then i won't be loved and so\nadvertisers know this and they exploit\nyour psychological weaknesses in what\nhappens they know the feeling of i'm not\nenough is what's usually at the core of\nmost people's fears and so what they do\nis they make advertisements to make you\nfeel subconsciously like you you're not\nenough until you buy our product\nsimple it makes sense that's how they\nstart to sell more if you want to know\nmore about this there's a uh\na beautiful documentary it's like four\nhours long it will blow your mind uh\nthat's called the century of self\ni believe that's what it's called a\npretty i'm like 99 sure that's what it's\ncalled the century of self and it goes\nthrough talking about how it used to be\nbefore like the 1940s it used to be that\npeople would 1940s 1950s people would\nbuy stuff based off of if they needed it\nand then a lot of psychologists learned\nabout psychology and human behavior they\ncame into advertising agencies and they\nstarted to actually use the advertising\nand the psychology in advertising to\nmake people stop buying things that they\nneed and make them buy things that they\nwant\nand so the perfect example they give\ninside of this the century of self\nis that there was uh i'm gonna try to\nremember this because it was about two\nyears ago that i watched this is that a\npre-1950s cigarettes were seen as\nsomething that only men smoked so women\nweren't really ones who smoked this and\nso uh so there was a guy that came in\nand the guy that came in was actually\nthe uh\nthe um\nsigmund freud's nephew he's sigmund\nfreud's nephew and he came in and he's\nlike i'm gonna come in and help you with\nthe psychology behind this because if\nyou're only selling to men you're\nmissing out on an entire 50 of the\nmarket that's out there how can we\nchange the perception and start selling\ncigarettes to women so that women can\nstart you know\nstart\nstart consuming them and so what\nhappened was they came up with this big\ncampaign and they uh what they said is\nthere's gonna they they had these women\nand inside of these women were there's\nbig massive like thanksgiving parade or\nsomething like that and so they had the\nwomen\ngo and they were walking through and\nthey they went to all of the news\noutlets and they said there's going to\nbe a line of women who are going to be\nuh i think they called them suffragettes\nis what they called them and they said\nthey're going to go and um\nand have have freedom torches that\nthey're going to show to take over their\npower take their power back so they're\ngoing to have freedom torches and what\nhappened was they went to all the news\ngroups there's going to be these women\nthey're going to have freedom torches so\nthe news group is like what the hell is\ngoing to happen we got to see whenever\nthis thing happens so as soon as they're\nwalking there were these women that were\nin these these dresses they had inside\nof their uh inside their dresses they\nhad cigarettes and so all at once when\nthey got in front of all of the news and\nmedia outlets they took out their\ncigarettes they lit them in front of\neverybody and that was the way that\nwomen in this perception of what\nhappened here took back their power to\nbe able to smoke cigarettes and say it's\nnot just going to be men that are going\nto smoke cigarettes it's going to be\nwomen as well and that alone\nsparked women smoking cigarettes from\nthe 50s on and so they knew how this\npsychology worked it's mind-blowing when\nyou start to see how psychologists are\nin advertising and actually hijack your\nsystem and exploit your psychological\nweaknesses so\nonce again i'm not saying this be doom\nand gloom i'm saying this so that you\ncan understand that your mind if you're\nnot very self-aware is able to be\nhijacked very easily by people who\nunderstand how your mechanisms in your\nbrain work better than you do right and\nso you've got to start thinking about\nthese things if an advertising agency\ncan make you feel differently just by\nwatching a 30-second ad to make you want\nto buy their product if a grocery store\ncan make you feel differently based off\nof the stuff that you see in the stuff\nthat you smell if a brick can you come\nup with three times more\nuh uses for a brick simply by the logo\nthat you see walking into a room if you\nknow a company if a school can make you\nfeel differently about someone that you\nread in on a piece of paper simply by\nthe temperature of the coffee that\nyou're holding on to then there's\nmillions of these things happening\naround the place and you've got to be\nvery aware of what's going on this is\none of the reasons why i tell people not\nto watch the news because the news is\nhijacking this system like crazy right\nnow it's also why i tell people not to\nwatch stuff like reality tv you know\npeople that are yelling at each other\nand terrible people and you know the\nthe kardashians and all the shows that\nare happening where people just they\ndon't seem to treat very people very\nwell every time i've seen that and also\nwhen there's like the\nwhat the housewives of whatever place\nthey all are at now that what happens is\nwhen you're watching these things it\nmight be like oh this is just a mind you\nknow i was busy all day i just want to\nwatch something that's just entertaining\nyou've got to ask yourself is this just\nentertaining or is this making me feel\nbetter about myself and the world around\nme or worse about myself and the world\naround me you know is the news keeping\nme informed or is it keeping me\nconformed and then you also got to start\nthinking about the people that you\nsurround yourself with you've heard me\nsay before and you've heard everybody\nsay before you're the average of the\nfive people that you spend the most time\nwith you know if you hang out with five\npeople that are extremely fit you're go\neven if you're not in shape you're going\nto get in shape simply because\nthe same way that all these things get\ninto your brain all of the people around\nyou are going to get into your brain in\ncertain ways as well oh man they're fit\ni'm fit subconscious you're going to go\ni should actually start working out more\nthey invite you to go work out you start\nshowing up because you want to feel\nbetter about yourself you want to fit in\nwith the people that you're around you\nknow if you hang around five people that\nare completely out of shape you're\nprobably gonna be the sixth if you hang\nout around five millionaires you're\nprobably gonna be a six if you hang out\naround five alcoholics you're probably\ngonna be the six you know so you gotta\nthink the people that are around you\nhow are they programming you\nright\nthe people that you follow on instagram\nis it pro programming you in some sort\nof way i always tell people go through\nyour news feed go through the people\nthat you follow just now that you know\nthat this is a thing and start removing\npeople that you feel are not good for\nyour own personal psychology now\nthe reason why this is important and\nthis shouldn't be something that\ndisempowers you but something that\nempowers you is because when you realize\nthat this is how the world works this is\nhow your brain works you can take back\nyour power and you can use it the way\nthat you need to so you can go okay\nbeautiful this is how it works i\nunderstand that this is my my system\nbeing hijacked i understand that this is\ngoing to affect me this certain way the\nmusic that i listen to is it something\nmakes me feel better or something makes\nyou feel worse is this how i would talk\nto somebody in real life or is this just\nsomething that i say when i'm all alone\nand i want i don't want to say so my\nmom's around or i don't want to say it's\nwhen my girlfriend's around or i don't\nwant to say this when people that i\nrespect are around right you start\nthinking about every single thing that\nyou do you start thinking about the\npeople you hang out with the music that\nyou listen to the ads that you see the\nthe the news that you watch or don't\nwatch the food that you eat the places\nthat you shop and you start to become\nvery aware of oh that makes sense now oh\nthat makes sense now as well and it's\nnot doom and gloom it's actually\nempowering because you go you know what\ni'm going to surround myself with all of\nthe people all of the stuff all of the\nthe music all of the the podcasts all of\nthe youtube videos all of the books all\nof the people that are going to get me\nto a better level of who i want to be\nbecause if anybody can hijack the system\nwhy can't i hijack my own system\nsince i'm in the system all day long why\ncan't i hijack my own system to create\nthe life that i want to become the\nperson that i want to become because\nultimately every single thing that you\ndo is unconsciously priming you\neverything that every single thing that\nyou're around is unconsciously priming\nyou so you've got to ask yourself am i\nin control of my priming am i taking\ncontrol of it or am i just leaving it up\nto chance because when you're very\nself-aware of this and you're very\nintentional with it you realize that\neverything in your environment can\neither empower you or disempower you to\ncreate the life that you want to so\nbe very careful\nand\nmotivate yourself inspire yourself with\nevery single piece of content every\nsingle thing that comes into your brain\nevery single thing that you see hear\ninteract with all of that stuff and\neventually you're gonna realize that you\nconsciously primed yourself to become\nthe person that you want the other day\nlast week i was in the paint store and i\ndon't watch the news i don't watch tv i\ndon't even have you know any tv stations\nthat could come in got netflix and\nyoutube that's basically all i watch on\nmy tv in my house\nand i was inside of the paint store and\ni won't tell you what station it was on\nor any of this stuff but\nwhat it was on was it was on a very\npopular talk show\ni won't tell you which one it is and it\nhappened to be on a station that the\ntalk show was talking about a lot of\nthings that were very politicized\nand\nevery time i would go to the the\ncommercials the commercials would have a\nnews flash like little break that would\nhappen and it was another thing that was\ngoing on right and what i became aware\nof in this moment obviously i've known\nit but to be able to actually see it\ni was in there for about three to four\nminutes and i was like i wonder what\nthey're actually going to be talking\nabout\nand it was so blatantly obvious to me\nthat\nthis station was trying to push their\npropaganda to make you think and feel a\ncertain way now i'm not saying what\nstage was any of those things what i'll\ntell you is no matter what side it is\nwhether it's the left or the right\nwhatever it is they are trying to have a\nwar for your mind by throwing out\npropaganda in things and making the\nworld seem a lot worse than it actually\nis\nright and within three to four minutes\nof being in there i became very\nuncomfortable because i was like i can\nliterally\nfeel\nhow other people that don't know this is\ngoing on can think that the world is\nabsolutely terrible right now think that\nthe world is absolutely going to to\nthink that there's so much to be afraid\nof and\ni've got to pick a side of what side i'm\non you know i've got to be on this side\nand when i pick a side this is important\nto know when i pick a quote-unquote side\nthat puts me on one side which means\nthat there is always an enemy which is\nthe other side right and it was so\nobvious that this one side was trying to\npush their agenda and push their agenda\nand push their agenda into somebody who\nis not aware of what is going on\nthey are going to be extremely easily\ninfluenced into number one\nthinking the way this side thinks number\ntwo\nseeing that there was a side that is\nagainst them that they need to be\nfearful of and number three think that\nthis world is going to absolute crap so\nthere's a couple things i want to pack\nout you know pull out of that and unpack\nthe first thing\nwhy is the news so negative and i i've\ndone episodes on this before in the past\nthe news is so negative because as a\nhuman our brains naturally go towards\nwhat is negative aka what is wrong why\nis that important because\n10 20 30 100 000 years ago when we\nfocused on what was wrong we were able\nto fix it which then meant that we would\nstay alive because what was wrong a\nhundred thousand years ago could mean\ndeath if we don't fix it so now\nwhat happens is the news in this media\nnot even just the news now it's also\njust the media these stations then they\ndisguise them as talk shows they\ndisguise them as tv stations they\ndisguise them as all of these different\nshows they put out there are out there\nputting fear and fear and fear and fear\nand fear into people and the reason why\nis because when you're fearful you're\ngoing to watch more because you want to\nfind the solution to this problem and\nthe more that you watch these stations\nthe more money that they're going to\nmake off of ad revenue\nif you watch them you're going they're\ngoing to get more ad revenue the more\nmillions of people that watch their\nshows\ntheir tv stations their news stations\ntheir\nyou know talk shows all of those things\nthe more people that watch them\nwell they're gonna make more money so\nthat's the first thing\nso you've got to be very clear as to\nwhat you're watching and to be very\nclear is this something that is\nsupporting\nme growing into the person that i want\nto be or is this something that's\nactually holding me back and keeping me\nin a fearful state\njust simple way to diagnose just ask\nyourself this question what i'm feeling\nwhat i'm watching right now how does it\nmake me feel\nright if you're watching tv and the news\nhappens to pop up and you say how does\nthis make me feel and you're like i feel\nreally worried i feel very fearful and i\ndon't feel very positive about the\ndirection of the world\nturn it off like get it off as soon as\npossible because that's not helping you\ncreate the life that you want that's\nholding you back that's keeping you\nparalyzed that's immobilizing you versus\nmobilizing you towards what is that you\nwant to create\nright so the first thing to be very\naware of is that they are putting fear\ninto every person that's out there\nbecause it's an easy way to control\nthe second thing that you have to\nrealize is this and i'm once again\nbefore i go any further i'm not saying\nthat the world doesn't have problems the\nworld definitely has problems and the\nworld will always have some problems in\nsome sort of way there's 7.5 billion\npeople on this planet are there a few\nbad apples out there there are a few\nkooky people that are off the rails\nabsolutely there will never be nothing\nbad i don't believe that will ever get\nto that point what i'm saying is it is\nseems way worse than it actually is\nbased off of number one all of the\ncameras now exist in the world because\neverybody's got a camera inside their\npocket and number two how it can be\npushed over and over and over again\nthrough every platform through the news\nthrough social media through everything\nthat you could possibly see\nso are are\nis the world perfect no will it ever be\nno but it's nowhere near as bad as they\nmake it seem right so that's the first\nthing to to be very aware of the second\nthing as to why\nwould the media i don't even just say\nthe news anymore why would the media the\nstuff you see on tv\ntalk shows all of these things\nwhy would they put so much negativity\nand so much fear-based stuff out there\nreason why is because the easiest way to\ncontrol people\nis through fear guilt and shame\nhe said again the easiest way to control\nsomebody is fear guilt and shame think\nabout what's been going on the past year\nand how much fear guilt and shame has\nbeen put out into the media it is\ncrazy\nhow much has been put out there right\nand i'm not talking about any side i\ndon't i'm not part of any side just so\nyou guys know i don't believe in any\nspecific side i don't think that there\nis a side to just go for\nbut when somebody picks a side\nas i said earlier once you pick a side\nyou now have a side that you're against\nright if i'm rooting for one basketball\nteam if i'm watching a game and the\nmiami heat are playing and i'm a heat\nfan\nthey're playing another team that other\nteam i want to lose\nso if i'm on one side\nwhether that's the left or the right or\nwhatever it is that people believe in at\nthis point i want the other side to lose\nand when i want the other side to lose\ni'm losing and the reason why is because\nwhen you can when we're split up and\ndivided\nit's the phrase that we've all heard\nunited we stand divided we fall if we\ndivide as humans we are easy to control\nwe are easy\ni don't have a side\nright i don't i don't have a specific\nside that's that\n[Music]\nthat i believe in or that i think is\nright or wrong i think there's different\nsides of both of them but there's\nanother thing that also is very\nimportant as well that people don't take\ninto account is that you're seeing the\nworld through your lens of the world\nbased off of everything that has\nhappened to you in your past\nright\nyou're seeing the world you think the\nway that you think you believe what you\nbelieve based off of the way that you\nwere raised and circumstances that were\npresented to you in your life\nlet me say that again you think the way\nthat you think and you believe what you\nbelieve based off of the way that you\nare raised and circumstances that life\npresented you with\nso someone who doesn't believe the exact\nsame thing that you believe\nand think the exact same way that you\nthink\nis because of the way they were raised\nin the circumstances that life presented\nthem with so it's very important to\nrealize who's to say\nthat if instead of having your life you\nhad their life that you wouldn't think\nexactly the same as them\nso what i want you to realize is that we\nneed to stop looking at other people and\nsaying that's the enemy i'm different\nthan them this is my side that's another\nside the only thing that we should be\ndoing at this point is focusing on how\nwe can love the other people now this is\nreally interesting because i put up a\nvideo on instagram talking with us the\nother day\nand most people are in full agreement\nyes we need to figure out a way to love\nmore to love more to love more because\nthe opposite of love is fear think about\nhow much if i don't like the other side\nwhatever that side is it's coming from a\nplace of fear right love is the only\nthing that's going to get us through all\nof this\nright there is no other way\nbattling and picking sides will not\nsolve our problems look at our\ngovernment if you're in the united\nstates all they do is just bicker like a\nbunch of little children right oh\nthere's this side there's this side\nthere's battling all they're doing\nthere's no love at all in all of that\nright\nclosing off will not solve our problems\nthere is no other side that you can be\non the only side that you can be on\nright now or ever is human you are a\nhuman no matter where you're from no\nmatter what you look like no matter what\nyou believe in no matter any of those\nstuff none of those things\nmatter what you are is you're a human\nand everybody else that's on this planet\nall 7.5 billion of them are human as\nwell when we are divided we are easily\nconquered if you look around and you\ndon't see the things in this world that\nyou currently if there's certain aspects\nof this world that you don't like i\ncompletely understand that but fighting\nis not going to create something better\nwhat's going to create something better\nfiguring out a way to love more\nright to unite not to divide when people\nare united is when things happen\nbut when we say that's evil this\nperson's evil that side's evil\nwhat happens we get divided and when you\ndivide\nnothing's going to actually happen\nnothing good is going to hap actually\nhappen look at look at look at the past\nhundred years of how much division has\nhappened the past 100 200 years right\ndoes it look like it's going in the\nright direction well probably not if you\nwatch the news it looks like it's going\nin the wrong direction really fast\nactually right\nbut anything that you've tried to do in\nthe past and and put somebody into a box\nand anything that's happened that's put\nsomebody into a box of this is what you\nbelieve this is what i believe is what\nthey believe\ndivides people and when you are divided\nyou are easily conquered\nso what we need to do is figure out a\nway to love more\nlet me give you an example of what i\nmean\nas i said a few minutes ago\npeople believe what they believe and\nthey think what they think based off of\nwhat has happened to them in their past\nwhat life has brought to them in what\nthey were taught\nright\nso i might look at somebody and say you\nknow what i don't necessarily believe\nthe exact same things that they believe\nbut\ndoes that mean i can't love them\nor find some sort of love for them\nit might be hard sometimes but it\ndoesn't mean it's impossible it means\nit's something that we got to work\ntowards right so you look and you've\nheard the phrase love your neighbor\nright love your neighbor love your\nneighbor\nwhen we're divided nothing's going to\nhappen that's going to be going to be\ngood but when we unite and we can work\nthrough our problems we can work through\nthings that are going on that's when\nthings actually that's when things\nactually start to change right so if i\nlook at somebody and i say okay\nthis person\ni don't agree with much of what they\nsaid\nactually i don't agree with most of what\nthey say but\ni didn't have their life i didn't have\nthem their circumstances i didn't have\nany of the things that they had so if i\nwas in their exact same shoes and i went\nthrough the exact same life that they\nhad would i think the same as them and\nthere's a possibility that i would\nwhich means\nthat how can i say i'm better than them\nand that my opinion and my my stance is\nbetter than them i can look at them and\ni can say you know what i don't agree\nwith them not a hundred percent\nthere's some things that we definitely\non other sides but i can love them\neither way why can i love them because\nnumber one\ni'm an empathetic person we all have\nempathy and we can always be empathetic\ntowards other people what they've been\nthrough in their lives right\nnumber two if i want things to actually\nchange\ni need to be able to look at someone who\ndoesn't agree the same thing as me and\nsay i can still love them through this i\ncan figure out a way to to for us to\nwork together that's the only way that\nthis is going to work and i could say\nokay if i go come from a place of love\nwhen i go and speak to this person\nthey're more receptive to listening to\nme and to listening to my side if i go\nfrom a place of hate in a place of anger\nthey are way less likely to listen to me\nand what they can do they're going to\nbuild up their walls and they're going\nto push their side further\nso if we really want to have an\nintelligent intellectual you know adult\nconversation maybe i should come from a\nplace of love first and not a place from\ndivision and hatred towards them come\nfrom a place of love and that would make\nthem more receptive to actually\nlistening to what it is that i have to\nsay\nmaybe\nthat's a way that we can actually get\nthem to change\nbecause if what they have been taught\nand what they what life has presented\nthem with what if i come from a place of\nlove and present them with a different\noption\nand present them with something\ndifferent maybe then that would change\nthem in some sort maybe it wouldn't but\nin reality i know that if we come from a\nplace of love and everything that we do\nlife is going to be a lot better\nand that's the thing that the world is\nmissing so what i want you to realize is\nthat right now there seems to be a war\nfor your mind\nyou're in control of all of the things\nthat you watch all of the things that\nyou listen to all of the people that you\nhang out with the music that you listen\nto the media that you consume whether\nthat's visually auditorily the people\nthat you hang out with you know you're\nin control of all of those things and\nall of those things brainwash you in\nsome sort of way the question is is it\nbrainwashing you to become the person\nthat you want to become or is it\nbrainwashing you to hold you back and\nnot get you to move forward right all i\nknow is that when i walked into that\npaint store and i saw those three to\nfour minutes i was like oh my god i\nliterally physically did not feel good\nin my body and i was like i gotta get\nout of here as quick as possible because\nnumber one i could see what it was doing\nto me and number two i could see what\nit's doing to other people who aren't\nnecessarily paying attention and who\ndon't have this knowledge as well so\njust be\nnumber one come from a place of love be\nvery loving in everything that you do\nand number two\nrealize you're in control of the\ninformation that comes into your head\nbe in control of it be very diligent\nabout what you allowed to come in your\nhead number three\nlook at everyone else around you and\nrealize that if i pick a side and if i\nbecome divisive\nwe're easily conquered the only way that\nwe're going to change this world into\nbecoming the world that we want to be is\nwe have to first become that change if\nwe want people to get along more than\nthey're getting along\nnow\nwe need to first be the people who start\ngetting along with people if we want\npeople people to be more loving we need\nto first be the people that are more\nloving\ngandhi said it\nstill makes sense be the change you want\nto see in the world\nwhat do you need to do and change within\nyourself to be the change that you want\nto see in the world what changes you\nwant to see in the world and how can you\ntake that and put it inside of you\nthere's a war for your mind going on\nbe in control of what's actually coming\ninto your head be in control of every\nthought that you think every action that\nyou take and come from a place of love\nin every single thing that you do and i\npromise you that'll be the first step\ntowards a better world i had put up\nyesterday a\nuh instagram and facebook stories poll\nand i put up a couple different things\nand one of them said do you think aliens\nexist yes or no\nis money the root of all evil yes or no\nand then one of them said do you think\nthe world is getting better or worse and\ni was super surprised to find that 78\nof the people who follow me think that\nthe world is getting worse\nyeah i was super surprised by that and\nthe reason why is because i think that\ntypically the people who follow me tend\nto be more optimistic versus pessimistic\nand so i wanted to dive into the issue\nto talk about my viewpoints of if i\nthink the world is getting better or\nworse because i was super surprised and\nwhat i\nthink is i think the world is getting\nbetter but i think the world is going\nthrough an awakening\nso let me give you an example of what i\nmean by this let's say that somebody is\n50 years old right\nand they don't take care of their body\nthey eat whatever it is they want to eat\nthe greasy food they eat really sugary\nfood lots of caffeine just a bunch of\ncrap into their body they don't care\nabout anything that you know they just\nliterally eat whatever it is they want\nto eat nothing healthy okay let's also\nsay that they don't ever work out never\nthey've worked out in years and years\nand years and let's say they're\noverweight 30 40 50 70 100 pounds of\nweight i don't know what it is let's say\nthey're overweight because of the fact\nthey haven't been taking care of\nthemselves and they also don't get much\nsleep they don't get good sleep\nand then one day that person has a heart\nattack and the heart attack luckily\ndoesn't kill them\nbut it does\ngive them a heart like they do have a\nheart attack heart attack isn't fun i'm\nsure never had one before but i'm sure\nit probably isn't the most fun thing in\nthe world\nso you look at this and you say\nafter years and years and years of abuse\nand neglect and not treating their body\nright\ntheir body has a heart attack\nand because of that heart attack the\nperson wakes up\nand they go oh my god like i almost just\ndied i'm now becoming aware\nof how i haven't been taking care of my\nbody i haven't been treating it right i\nhaven't been giving it the right fuel\ni have been just\neating stuff for taste and not for\nactual health reasons i haven't worked\nout and god knows long how\nit's been since i've worked out\ni don't get any sleep i don't get good\nsleep i drink a lot of alcohol\nand all of that over years and years and\nyears and years has accumulated to this\none moment of me having a heart attack\nnow\ni have a choice either i can go back to\nlife as it was or i can make some\ndifferent choices based on my heart\nattack and let's say that person decides\nyou know what i want to live long enough\nto see my daughter walk down the aisle i\nwant to live long enough to be able to\nbe a grandfather that ends up being able\nto play with his his grandkids and go to\ntheir sports games and be able to\ncontinue to travel i want to live longer\nthan just past the age of 60 years old i\nwant to live to 85 90. what would it\nlook like for me to live to 90 and see\nmy grandkids get married as well\nand they start to take care of\nthemselves they start eating healthy\nmaybe they hire a nutritionist they hire\ntheir nutritionist and take care of\ntheir body they hire someone that that\nteaches them how to work out and the\nright ways to move they start figuring\nout ways to improve their sleep and they\nread books around improving their sleep\nand because of this this heart attack\ntheir entire life shifts\nbecause they now\nwoke up\nto how they have been treating their\nbody\nwhy do i bring this up why don't you\njust think about what we've been going\nthrough\nand actually before we dive into what\nwe've been going through\nif somebody were to have a heart attack\nand then switch their entire lives\naround in change for the better it lived\nlonger and was able to see their their\ndaughter walk down the island to be able\nto hang out with their grandkids and\nhave a better life and be healthier and\nhappier and better sleep and all that\nstuff\nis the heart attack still bad\nor\nwas the heart attack the thing the good\nthing that came in to awaken this person\nfrom the sleep that they were in and the\nneglect that they were giving their body\nand now\nah that's amazing because you know what\nnow i can treat my body the right way\nand that heart attack woke them up is\nwhat you can say it is their awakening\nfrom everything that they were going\nthrough now is a heart attack bad or\nwas maybe the heart attack of blessing\nwas the heart attack something that\nactually ended up being good because in\nthe long term it changed them\nand i think basically what we're in\nright now is the middle of a heart\nattack\nright\ni'm assuming that when you go through a\nheart attack it's not very fun\nno one's like holy this is great\ni'm having a heart attack it's usually\npeople are probably freaking out it\nprobably hurts a lot it's probably\nsomething that you don't want to go\nthrough\nbut\nif you think about what we're going\nthrough and the heart attack that we're\ngoing through the amazing thing about it\nis that we're now starting to wake up to\neverything that is wrong in the world\nthat we need to fix and this isn't me\nsaying this i take this side of this i\ndon't take any side\nin politics or any of that stuff in my\nopinion doesn't matter because everyone\nhas an opinion so it's just me talking\nfrom just a this is the way that i view\nthe world\nwe're now waking up to\nold oppressive and evil systems that are\nbeing brought to the surface and a lot\nof people who were not aware of them\nare now aware\nthat there's a lot of things happening\nthat maybe they weren't aware of maybe\ndifferent racial things maybe different\ngender things it's becoming apparent\nthat some people have been held down by\nsociety it's been apparent that maybe\nsome people don't get a hundred percent\nequal opportunities like group a might\nnot get the same opportunity as group b\nbased off of where they lived or where\nthey grew up in the the school that they\nwere able to go to in the education\nsystem that they had it's becoming aware\nhow our government is not set up for the\npeople's best interest but maybe their\nown\nand people are starting to become very\naware of these things like a heart\nattack that wakes you up and goes holy\n something's not right\nbut in turn now we're in the middle of a\ntime where things can start to shift\nthings can start to change so is having\na heart attack fun probably not i don't\nthink anybody's ever i've never heard of\nsomebody using the adjective as fun for\na heart attack\nbut\ndoes it seem like sometimes if you're in\nthe middle of a heart attack let's hit\nthe fan probably but if you live through\nthe heart attack you make changes you\nchange your life you change your\nlifestyle did it turn out to be a good\nthing\nmy\nrebuttal would be yes i do think my\nargument would be yes i think that it is\nsomething that helped a heart attack is\nan awakening for bad health\nin most cases obviously there's\ncircumstances outside where someone just\nhas heart problems but in most cases a\nheart attack is an awakening to bad\nhealth right civil unrest is an\nawakening to how we should look at the\nsystems\nthat we have and see if we can make them\nbetter for all people\n[Music]\nso the same way that a heart attack\nwakes up somebody who hasn't been taking\ncare of their health\ncivil unrest wakes up the public to how\nwe should be treating people and start\nto change our systems and processes\nmake sense\nanother thing that we should consider\nwhen we're talking about the\nuh\nthe the the way that the world looks\nreally bad right now is what you have to\nrealize we're seeing a lot more footage\na lot more videos a lot more pictures\nthan we ever have\nof things that are bad that are\nhappening in the world\nare there things that are bad or\nhappening world absolutely are there\nmore than there ever have been\nabsolutely not and i'm going to share\nsome statistics with you around that in\njust a little while to tell you that but\ni think what you're also really have to\nrealize is that if you were to rewind 20\nyears ago 25 years ago\n99 of people did not have a phone or\ni mean actually not even take phone they\ndidn't even have a camera to take\npictures if you would have talked to\nsomebody 20 years ago and they're like\nyeah i take pictures with my phone\nthey'd be like yeah you're crazy\nbecause that would make no sense to\nsomebody 20 years ago right a phone was\nmade to make phone calls\nbut if you just think about that\nnow every single person\nhas a camera in their pocket at all\ntimes they can take pictures of anything\nso things that were kind of under the\nsurface and hidden a long time ago are\nnow coming to the surface and they have\nto come to the surface just like a heart\nattack so that you can be able to work\nthrough them\nso that's one thing another thing i want\nyou to consider is that now there's a\nlot more cameras than there ever have\nbeen so if you're seeing more things and\nthinking that the world is worse because\nof that you just have to realize there's\njust a lot more cameras than there ever\nhappened and once again i'm gonna go\nover the statistics and just a minute i\nthink they're gonna kind of surprise you\nanother thing that has shifted a lot in\nthe past 20 30 years is that the news\nused to be something that you could\ntrust the use had no the news had no\nhidden agenda now we all know that they\nhave their own agendas that they want to\npush to you and so they're pushing them\nanother thing that you can actually\nstart to think about\nis the rise of social media\nin my opinion social media is not a good\nthing it's not a bad thing it is just a\nthing and the human condition is now\ncoming out through social media but the\ninteresting thing about social media is\nthat social media makes it easier to\nshare information\nfaster and more widespread than any time\nin humankind\nso if it was 30 years ago and you saw\nsomething with your own eyes that was\nbad that happened in front of you\nthe only people you could really tell is\nyou could i guess you could call the\ncops\nyou could tell your neighbors you could\ntell your family but right now if\nsomething were to happen bad in front of\nyour eyes and you were to videotape it\nand put up on facebook and put it up on\ninstagram it could immediately go viral\nmillions or hundreds of millions of\npeople could see it news groups could\npick it up and then it would be all over\nthe place so it's not that things are\ngetting worse it's just that\nthe darkness is coming to light because\nwe are able to share this information\nquicker than ever before\nand to dive into the statistics which i\nwant to share with you guys it's super\ninteresting\nis this so there's a\ni did my own research on this and\nthere's also a harvard psychologist he's\na cognitive psychologist named steven\npinker he's actually got a couple books\nabout in a ted talk about how the world\nis getting safer and it's better than it\never has been it just seems like it's\nnot based off of the fact that we have a\nlot of information that we can share\npictures videos immediately if you go to\ndepartment justice's website on the\ndepartment of justice's website if you\nlook at statistics firearm homicides are\ndown 39\nfrom 1993. so if you look at it you\nthink oh my gosh there's so many more\npeople dying from guns there's actually\n39 less people than there were in 1993\nyou know and it continues to go down\nyear over year i'm not here to argue\nfirearms so don't even think that that's\nwhat i'm trying to get across i'm just\ntrying to give you plain and simple\nstatistics to show you that the world is\nactually getting better right to make\nyou feel better about ah maybe it's not\nas bad as i thought it was maybe it is\nactually starting to get better uh\nnon-fatal firearm accidents are down 69\npercent\nso non-fatal firearm accidents are not\ndown 69 percent the numbers of people\nwho are murdered on a yearly basis in\nthe united states is down\nand now you might say okay well what\nabout side of the united states\ni understand there's there's places\nwhere things have gotten worse and\nthey've gotten better and things have\ngotten worse and things have gotten\nbetter but if you look at the world\ncollectively as a whole and i understand\nthere's going to be some anomalies to\nthis everybody but if you look at the\nworld collectively as a whole the number\nof people killed in war\nis one-twelfth of what it was in the\n1950s and the 1960s\nso you literally have to look at that\nand go wow\n1 12 of what it was before\n60 70 years ago so\nnow right now is the safest time to be\nalive as a human is it perfect hell no\nabsolutely not but what i think we're\ngoing through\nis a little bit of a heart attack we're\nstarting to realize some of the ways\nthat we weren't taking care of our\nquote-unquote body other people's bodies\nour system our you know the body that we\nare all a part of\nthe\ngovernments that we're a part of the\nlocal areas we're a part of the nations\nwe're a part of in the world that we're\na part of we're starting to become very\naware\nof old evil oppressive systems\nand they're very blatantly in front of\nus now and we're now able to start to\nwork through those things\nso is it the most comfortable time to be\nalive absolutely not\nwill it get better\nwill there be something good that comes\nout of all of this i tend to be an\noptimistic person so i think yes and i\nwould like to argue that with anybody i\nthink that it is getting better\nstatistically it's showing it's getting\nbetter there's books that are written on\nit getting better is everything perfect\nabsolutely not there is no way you will\never hear me say that everything is\nperfect and i don't think\nhumans are perfect therefore i don't\nthink everything ever will be perfect\nbut\ni tend to\nlean towards the side of everything is\nworking for me not against me the world\nis working for me not to me and if\nthat's the case i also feel the world is\nworking for you and not to you it's\nnever working against you it's always\nworking towards your side so is it\nperfect absolutely not\nbut what i would recommend is this\nif you're starting to feel the feelings\nof of the world being heavy of the news\nbeing heavy of stuff that's happening in\nsociety being heavy\nturn off the news\nthe news is not there to support you\nit's not there to inform you\ni promise you that i've done episodes\nbefore about how the news is literally\njust there to make you\nnot informed but conformed and they put\nout a bunch of negativity because your\nbrain is addicted to negativity because\nthat's how the human species survived so\nturn off the news if you're starting to\nfeel like the world is heavy\nturn off social media if you're starting\nto feel like things are heavy as well\ngo out and experience the world\nwalk outside look at the sun and you'll\nrealize\nman things aren't as bad as they seem to\nbe when you watch them on the news on\nthe on the screens everything seems to\nbe collapsing when you walk outside of\nyour house\nit tends to be a lot better and i'm a\nvery optimistic person so i think we're\ngoing in the right direction i think we\nhave a lot of work to do i think there's\na lot of things that still need to be\nbe worked through\nbut you have to realize that everything\nthat comes into your brain\ninfluences the way that you feel\neverything that you see influences the\nway that you feel everything that you\nhear influences the way that you feel\nevery person that you talk to influences\nthe way that you feel everything that\nyou read on social media or see on tv is\ngoing to influence the way that you feel\nand in turn that kind of brainwashes you\nto be a certain way\nso if you're thinking of it this way if\nif every single thing that comes into\nour brain in a way brainwashes us to\nfeel a certain way why don't we take\ncontrol of our our own brainwashing why\ndon't i go you know what i'm not gonna\nlook at the news today i'm not gonna\nturn on social media today i'm gonna\nread a book i'm going to watch some\nyoutube videos from some motivational\nspeakers\nor from\nsome psychologist or neurologist or\nwhatever it is you're trying to learn\nfrom and be in control of your own\nbrainwashing\nbecause i promise you this if you're not\nin control of it yourself you're still\nbeing brainwashed is it the brainwashing\nthat you want\ni would prefer to wake up and say i'm in\ncontrol of my own brainwashing i'm going\nto put on the music i like i'm going to\nlisten to podcasts i like i'm going to\nread the books that i like i'm not going\nto turn on the news i'm not going to\nturn on social media and i'm going to\nhang out the people that i like\nbecause ultimately that's the way that\nwe get better\nso is the world getting worse i don't\nthink that it is i just think that we're\nin the middle of a heart attack and i\nfeel like on the other side of this\nheart attack\nthe role will be better\npeople are going to work it out we're\ngoing to figure it out and the evil old\nand oppressive systems will be worked\nthrough and released\nand we'll be on our way towards a better\nsociety and hopefully better human\nconnection we're gonna be talking about\nsomething that i should have probably\ntalked about quite a long time ago but\nuh i talked quite a bit about anxiety\nand all of those things in march and\napril and as things were going on and\nthen i had a conversation with a friend\nuh about covet about all the things that\nare happening and i'm not going to give\nyou my world perspective because who\nneeds to hear another opinion in this\nworld so i'm not going to give you any\nopinions on anything but what i will\ntell you is how i know how to work\nthrough anxiety how i've helped myself\nget through anxiety have have my friends\nhelp get through anxiety have had\nclients get through anxiety and stress\nand depression all those\nand there's a lot of heavy that's\nhappening in the world we can admit it\nand first off we probably need to admit\nit like this has been for most people a\nheavy year uh it has been a lot of\nunknown things that we did not see\ncoming up that have come up right and\nyou can feel really heavy if you are a\nperson that's very kinesthetic you can\nfeel\nlost if you're a person very head and\nanalytical type of person\nyou might just be ready for this to\nbe over i'm actually pretty sure that\neverybody who's listening to this is\nready for this to be over but at this\npoint in time it's not\nit just isn't and so what comes down to\nis us accepting that and i'm here to\ntell you everybody it'll be all right it\nwill eventually work itself out\nand the quicker that we just accept that\nit is the way that it is right now\nand that it will eventually be all right\nthat i think the easier it'll make our\nlives until it gets to at least some\nfeeling of normalcy and i'm gonna try to\nhelp you feel better and i was having a\nconversation with a friend of mine and\nwe were talking about covet and the fact\nthat she's going home to her parents\nfor christmas and she has a lot of\nanxiety around possibly bringing kovid\nhome to her parents for the holidays\nwhich is the worst christmas gifts you\ncan give your parents but she's afraid\nof giving that to her parents uh going\nhome for the holidays completely\nunderstandable makes a whole lot of\nsense and she was talking about that but\nmore than anything else what she was\nreally anxious about is the fact that\nkovit is still around the fact that\nwe're still dealing with this thing what\nare we nine months into it and she was\njust talking about how she was anxious\nand stressed because of that\nthen the conversation went a little bit\nfurther and she was talking about you\nknow the other thing that scares me a\nlot as well is the economy like i don't\nknow what's going to happen with the\neconomy with all of the inflation that's\ngoing on with you know about 20 of the\nworld's money or the us's money was just\nprinted this year you know and just\nwhat's going to happen with the economy\nand then she went into rolling into how\nshe's also having these anxious thoughts\naround getting these test results that\nshe's waiting for her dog and you know\nthe dog the the\nthe issues that's happening with her dog\nand the fact that her dog might have\ncancer and she's just\nat this point in time it's a waiting\ngame for all of them right she so it's a\nwaiting game for the test results for\nthe dog it's a waiting game for uh\nseeing eventually if covid's ever going\nto pass or what's going to happen with\nour lives next and it's a waiting game\nto see what's going to happen with the\neconomy and i let her go through and\ntalk about it and talk about it\nand then what happened was i mentioned\nto her\nthat the things that she's having all of\nthis stress and anxiety around she has\nabsolutely no control over and that's\nwhat's giving her stress and anxiety\nright so she has no control over what's\ngoing on in covid she has zero control\nover that she also has zero control over\nthe economy and she also has zero\ncontrol over test results from blood\nwork that was done a few days ago for\nher dog zero control over all three of\nthose things now before i go any further\ni want you to think about the things\nthat are making you anxious and ask\nyourself this question do i have any\ncontrol over those things all of the\nthings that are bringing you worry and\nfear and anxious thoughts do you have\nany control over them or\ndo you have those anxious thoughts and\nfeelings around them simply because of\nthe fact that you have no control over\nthem and you want to have control but\nyou don't\nso your anxious thoughts could be coming\nfrom the fact that you want to have\ncontrol over something that you\nabsolutely will never have control over\nand you haven't just fully accepted that\nlack of control\nbecause of those things three things\nthat i mentioned to you about my friend\nnone of them literally none of them she\ncan control she cannot do anything about\nthose\nand it's not that those things don't\nexist they all exist it's that she's\nfighting them in her mind and that is\nbringing in the anxiety\nso what are you fighting\nare you fighting things\nand the other thing that she's not doing\nshe's not accepting she's not accepting\nthat they exist they are here they are\nthe way that they are she's just not\naccepting them she is resisting the way\nthat the world currently is right now\nright that's what at its simplest form\nshe is resisting the way that the world\ncurrently is she's resisting the covet\nshe's resisting the economy she's\nresisting the dog's test results she's\njust resisting and this is not uncommon\nuh that i was reading an article the\nother day says depression has gone up\nfour times 400\nfrom the exact same time last year\nand i think a lot of the reason why is\nbecause people are feeling all of these\nanxious thoughts and at the same time\nthey're they're not accepting the way\nthat the world is and they're they're\nnot allowing themselves to learn and\ngrow and get better in these times and\nbe able to work through it because they\njust so badly want the world to go back\nto quote unquote normal whatever bit of\nnormalcy that they can have again and if\nyou've listened to my podcast before\nyou've heard me say this your level of\nstress anxiety worry and fear and\ndepression\nunless you're clinically depressed\nthere's a completely different that's a\nwhole other episode that we could do but\nyour level of worry anxiety sadness fear\nall of those things anxiety all that\nyour level of it will be in direct\nproportion to how much you're resisting\nthe way that the world is so if you're\nextremely anxious right now i guarantee\nyou are extremely resisting the way that\nthe world is you're extremely resisting\nsomething that is out there in the world\nright if you're having low levels of\nanxiety and just a little bit maybe it's\njust bubbling under the surface which i\nfeel is for most people how it usually\nworks it's not that it's full-blown\nanxiety attacks it's just it's just a\nlittle bit of anxiety that's bubbling\nunder the surface all day every day and\nthe reason why is probably because you\nhave a low level of resisting the way\nthat the world is you're wishing\nall right well yeah you know it is this\nway but\ni just wish it would go back to normal\ni'm just so i just want to go back to\nwork i want to see my friends again i\nwant to be able to hug my mom and it's\nnot that it's a full-blown panic attack\nfor you might just be that you're just\nresisting versus full acceptance you\nknow there's a shaman that i've worked\nwith in the past and done psychedelics\nwith and he says just surrender harder\nright just surrender harder that's what\nwe all kind of need to do right now and\nactually what we need to do probably for\nthe rest of our lives is just surrender\nharder i'm not saying surrender to the\npowers to be if you think that the you\nknow the economy and the cove and all\nthat stuff is being put on by some\nmasterminds behind the scenes i'm not\nsaying surrender those i'm saying\nsurrender the fact that it is the way\nthat the world is right now and at this\nmoment there's nothing that i know of\nthat we can do about it so do i want\ncovet to exist anymore no hell no of\ncourse i don't\nbut what can i do about it\nwhat can i personally do about covid\nright\ni'm just a college dropout i don't know\nabout covet i don't know i think about\nall that science and stuff\ni can barely formulate words sometimes\nhow am i going to save the world from\ncovet i'm not so do i want it to be here\nno but\nit is here and i've got to figure out a\nway just to accept that\nand uh you can either resist\nor you can accept those are the two\nthings that you can really do yeah it is\nthe way that it is\nit's not what i would have chosen but it\nis the way that it is and what you have\nto realize is that's completely my\ndecision and you\ncan resist or you can accept and that is\ncompletely your decision as well it's\nfully 100 up to you and what you have to\nrealize is that the more that you're\nresisting\nthe more that you're stealing away your\njoy in the present moment your joy is\nbeing stolen from you in this present\nmoment because of your resistance\nyour joy your happiness your peace in\nthis moment is being stolen from you\nbecause you won't just fully accept that\nhey the world is the way that it is\nright if somebody breaks up with you\nyour joy is stolen from you if you're\nresisting and going god i just wish that\nwe would be back together again and\nyou're thinking about how the past used\nto be and you're thinking about your\nlove and all of the times that you hung\nout and watched netflix and chilled and\nhad all those great moments you're like\ngod i just want it to be that way again\nbut it's not and guess what the more\nthat you're resisting the fact that it\nis in the way that you want it to be\nobviously the more that it's going to be\nholding you back the more anxiety and\nstress and worry and fear you're going\nto be having around that thing\nand\nyou have to realize if your joy is being\nstolen from you in the present moment\nyour life is just a collection of\npresent moments that's all that it is\nthere is no past and there is no future\neverything that has happened to you and\nwill ever happen to you in your entire\nlife is in the present moment nothing\nhas happened to you in the past the past\nis just a present moment that has passed\nright nothing has happened to you in the\nfuture yet but when that future thing\ndoes happen that will be a present\nmoment and so if we're really serious\nabout this and trying to make ourselves\nfeel better we need to be very aware\nthat our entire life is just the present\nmoment the only thing that that does\nexist and will ever exist for us is the\npresent moment and if we're resisting\ncovet if we're resisting the economy if\nwe're resisting a breakup if we're\nresisting test results all of those\nthings we're resisting it and having our\njoy stolen from us in this moment when\nwe fully can experience the love and the\njoy and the happiness and the peace that\nwe truly want to if we were to just step\ninto it and accept stop resisting and go\nwhat is great about this moment right\nnow\nand just allowing ourselves to sink into\nthe present moment more than anything\nelse\nand the perfect question ask yourself\nand this is what i asked my friend\ni said okay\nnow that we've gone through all these\nthings i got a question for you the\nquestion is are you okay right now\nshe's like what do you mean i was like\nin this moment in this very second\nare you okay\nand she's like well yeah i mean i'm good\nyou know i've got this coming up and\nthis i was like no no no i don't care\nabout bills i don't care about anything\nthat's happening in the future i don't\ncare about any of that\nin this very second\nare you safe\nand are you okay\nshe's like yes and i was like\nnow just think about that thought just\njust marinate on that thought how does\nit make you feel like it makes me feel a\nlot better and the reason why is because\nall of the stress and anxiety that we\nhave is all for things that could\npossibly be happening in the future and\nwe make up all of these ghosts and\ndemons into the future that could\npossibly exist but in reality it's never\nabout those things it's always about\nthis present moment right now so if you\nfeel anxious thoughts if you feel like\nthere's something wrong i want you to\nask yourself in this moment right now\nam i okay\nnot oh my god i have pills i have to pay\ntomorrow or later on at five o'clock i\nhave to make sure i'm at this\nappointment no right now in this\nmoment this very second are you okay\nand the answer is yes can you sink into\nthat feeling of being okay don't sink\ninto the feeling of the anxiety of the\npossible things that could happen in\nyour future can you sink into the\nfeeling of being just fine right now in\nthis present moment feel the feelings of\nwhat it feels like to be fine in this\nmoment\nare you okay you are\nokay i feel better i feel at least a\nlittle bit better\nand if i can continue to notice when i\nfeel anxious thoughts and start to\nre-pattern myself to go am i okay right\nnow in this moment yes i am okay am i\nokay right\n99.999 of the time you're okay right now\nin this present moment and there's\nnothing to be worrying about or anxiety\nthat you should have but you're bringing\nit up and forcing it onto yourself\nright so\nif you have anxieties of anxiety or\nstress or fear or worry that you've been\nfeeling my question to you is this\nwhat are you\nresisting if you're anxious if you're\nworrying if you're fearful if you're\nfeeling those negative emotions come up\nwhat are you resisting\nthink about that for a second what is it\nwhat is it that you're resisting is it a\nbreakup are you not accepting the\nbreakup wanting it the way the world to\ngo back to the way that it used to be\nthe fact that you're not person's not in\nlove with you anymore what is it that\nyou're resisting\nand the question is are you okay right\nnow are you okay\nand the other thing we have to do is we\nhave to accept\nand that we can control almost nothing\nlike we literally can almost control\nnothing\nlike literally you can barely control\nyour own bowels after taco tuesday like\nyou can literally control almost like\nyou can't control other people you can't\ncontrol your children very well you\ncan't control the weather we can barely\ncontrol our own thoughts most of the\ntime we can't\nwe could control almost nothing and this\nis\nme telling you this as a recovering\ncontrolaholic where i realized on one of\nmy my very first psychedelic journey\nthat i did that i was a control freak i\nhad control issues and that was causing\nall of my stress and my worry and my\nanxiety in my life and so the past three\nyears three and a half years since i've\ndone it have been a complete unraveling\nof just letting go of all the control\nand noticing it when it comes up and\nrealizing that the more that i let go of\ncontrol and the more the less i try to\ncontrol everything the more amazing my\nlife becomes\nand so we can't control our first\nthoughts\nbut you can always control your second\nthought\nand so even if the first thought comes\nup is an anxious thought well then\nnotice it identify it and then go is\nthat the thought that i want no it's not\nokay what is a better thought that i\nwant to replace it with and replace that\nthought with a new thought you can't\ncontrol your second or you can't control\nyour first stop but you can always\ncontrol your second thought\nand if you change your first thought\nenough to whatever this second thought\nis enough over and over and over and\nover and over again you eventually\nre-pattern your brain in your thoughts\nand your second thought will eventually\nstart to become your first thought if\nyou're naturally a negative person\nidentify that negativity and replace it\nwith positivity and if you do this over\nand over and over and over and over\nagain all day every day hundreds of\ntimes every day depending on how much\nnegativity pops up in a year two years\nthree years five years you'll notice\nthat your new\npreferred thoughts are positive and not\nnegative anymore we can re-pattern our\nbrain by noticing it and by taking\ncontrol of it you can't control your\nfirst thought but you can always control\nyour second thought and then what do you\ndo\nit's very simple right now am i okay\nin this moment it's very second i am\nokay\nokay\ngood number two accept accept stop\nresisting the world is the way that it\nis\nthe more that i resist the worse i'm\ngoing to feel so if i can just accept\ni'm going to feel better and number\nthree ask yourself this question this is\nsomething that i had\ni was feeling a lot of it's probably\nabout five years ago i got off a plane\nand flew into austin\nand uh\nand it was like i came from florida\nand florida was hot it was amazing and i\nwas on the beach i flew back in austin\nand it was like\n19 degrees and just like it wasn't even\nsnowing it was like that really frozen\nrain and it was cold and it was hailing\nand it was just a crap day outside and i\ngot off the plane i was like oh gross\nthis is disgusting i'm waiting for my\nuber to come pick me up and it's like\nthe wind is just like howling it's like\n30 miles an hour it's cold\ni came from amazing beautiful florida to\ncold rainy windy wet austin\nand i started to notice\nmy feelings changed towards being in\naustin at that moment i didn't feel good\ni was like damn why didn't i just stand\ni started to get really kind of anxious\nabout why did i just stay in florida i\ncould have stayed in florida for an\nextra week whatever it was\nand then i made myself reframe\nwhat was going on and i asked myself\nthis question that's the question i have\nfor you is what's beautiful about this\nmoment\nand i forced myself to answer what was\nbeautiful about this moment and so i\nlooked around and i started noticing\ndifferent things that i could feel\nthey're beautiful oh my gosh i have my\nhealth i have you know people who love\nme in my life i have you know a business\nthat i love running i have things that i\nlove doing i have you know a time\ntomorrow to go work out with one of my\nbest friends and i started noticing\nwhat's beautiful about the moment and by\nnoticing that thing that i felt was\nbeautiful i was actually starting to\nunravel all of the feelings of anxiety\nand stress that i had about coming back\nin to the way that it is in the cold and\nthe rain and the sleet and snow and all\nthe crap that we had that day\nand so i think i want you to do is\nnumber number one ask yourself am i okay\nnumber two accept it and number three\nask yourself this this one question what\nis beautiful about this moment and\nreframe your thoughts in the current\nmoment the current present that's being\nstolen from you and reframe it to\nfinding what's beautiful in your life\nand what's beautiful in this present\nmoment and this right here that i'm\ngoing to share with you is a strategy\nthat i've used for tons of my clients\nbefore in the past and it's actually a\nstrategy i've used for myself and it's\nactually a strategy the reason why i'm\ntalking about it is because it's a\nstrategy i had to use for myself at 4 00\na.m in the morning a few days ago and i\ndon't know if you guys have ever done\nthis before where you wake up in the\nmorning it's early in the morning maybe\nyou have to go to the bathroom or you\nhear noise or dogs are barking or\nsomething like that and then immediately\na thought comes through of something\nthat needs to be done or something that\nyou have to do or it could be an anxious\nthought i don't know what it is for you\nbut that first thought gets your brain\ngoing and then once your brain gets\ngoing it's gone you can't you can't stop\nit and so a few nights ago we've been\nsuper super busy my business this week\nwe have an event that we're planning\nwhich we'll tell you about later we have\na mastermind that we're planning that's\ncoming up as well a three another three\nday event we have uh tons of other\namazing things that are coming up and\nit's all good stuff\nbut the problem is i woke up to go to\nthe bathroom and immediately one thing\nthat i had to do popped into my head\nand then it was a cascade of all of\nthese different things oh my gosh i'm\nbehind on doing this i've got to reach\nout to this person i got to get a quote\nfor this i've got to get this this i\nhave to negotiate this price and it\nstarted to become all of these anxious\nthoughts rolling into my head one of the\nthings that's very uh that's a huge\nmisconception is because i'm a mindset\nguy that i must have this perfect\nmindset and nothing holds me back but\nnothing can be further from the truth\nthe reason why i am the quote unquote\nmindset guys because i have to work on\nmy mindset sometimes more than other\npeople just to motivate myself to get\n done and so what happened was i had\nthe first thought i had a second thought\nthird thought and i was sitting in bed\nfor about 45 minutes so it's about four\no'clock in the morning right i'm in bed\nand i'm like i'm not falling asleep it's\nnot happening and i was like i have to\nget up and i have to use my strategy on\nmyself and i had to get up and i had to\nget my journal so i went into the living\nroom i got my journal four o'clock in\nthe morning and i started journaling\nsome of the stuff that i needed to and\ni'm gonna take you through exactly what\nit is that i did for myself and what\ni've done for many other clients as well\nyou know i've worked with a lot of\ndifferent people that have anxiety\nproblems\nand this is just one of the strategies\ni've come up with and the first thing\nis the awareness that i'm having anxious\nthoughts that's the first thing right\nlike the first thing is is now you have\nto you're inside of your head you're\nhaving thoughts you're inside your head\nyou're having anxious thoughts you've\ngot to pause\nand notice as the observer what's going\non here okay yep i've done this before i\nknow exactly where i am i'm in the\nmiddle of anxious thoughts i need to\nthen remove myself\noutside of my head you know it's like\nthe quote when you when you take\nyourself if you don't take yourself out\nof the jar you can't read the label\ninside of the jar is inside of my head i\nneed to take myself out of my own head\nbecome the observer and say what is\nactually happening here oh\ntoo many thoughts too many anxious\nthoughts\nand one of the things that about anxiety\nis that anxiety comes from your thoughts\nand when you google and actually start\nto look up and research anxiety there is\nno cure for anxiety and the reason why\nis because it comes from your thoughts\nthere's no actual hey you have anxiety\nthis is the chemical that you should\ntake now i will tell you this people do\nhave that you can go to a doctor and if\nyou have too much anxious thoughts they\nwill give you stuff to then make you\nfeel different and put different\nchemicals into your brain but it's not a\nchemical imbalance right so i've had\nanxiety attacks before in the past it's\nbeen a long time since that's happened\ni've been around many people in the\nmiddle of anxiety attacks i've worked\nwith many people who have anxiety some\nof them that have such crippling anxiety\nthey literally cannot even leave their\nhouse their social anxiety is so high\nthat they haven't left their house in\ntwo to three years\nand the reason why is because it all\ncomes from the thoughts and when\nthoughts are in your head\nthey're extremely hard to deal with\nright\nit's like trying to grab water like when\nyour thoughts are in your head and\nyou're trying to work through thoughts\nit's like trying to grab onto water like\nyou will never really grab it it's\nalways going to get away from you right\nso\nthoughts can't stay in your head because\nthoughts are too abstract you need to\nget all of your thoughts and put them on\npaper because to try to\nwrangle up your thoughts and to try to\nfigure out what's going on and figure\nout how to work through them is like\ntrying to punch somebody in the dark\nlike you're not going to see that person\nmaybe every once in a while you take\nfour five six swings and on the\nhundredth swing you might hit that\nperson but then they're gone again and\nthey move that's kind of like figuring\nout your thoughts in your own head and\ntoo many times people are trying to\nfigure out their issues they're trying\nto figure out what's going on their head\nthey're trying to figure out why they\nfeel the way that they feel they're\ntrying to figure out why they're sad why\nthey're depressed or other anxious why\ntheir life isn't going the way they want\nto but they never get a freaking pen and\npaper and write down what's actually\ngoing on\nright so i sat down with my journal and\ni wrote down a few questions right if\nyou have ever learned how to journal for\nme before in the past it's super simple\nyou just ask yourself questions and then\nyou force yourself to answer it so i was\nwriting down and i noticed that i was\nhaving anxious thoughts so i said what\nam i having anxious thoughts about and i\njust wrote them down and there was like\n17 things it was like a massive list of\nall of these things or started flooding\nthrough\nbecause i had so much i had to like so\nmuch was on my plate so many plates were\nspinning at one time\nkind of what happens sometimes when you\ngrow a business and you know the higher\nyou go the harder the wind blows right\nthe wind was blowing hard this morning\nthat morning and so the first thing i\nwrote down is what am i having anxious\nthoughts about and i wrote all the\ndifferent things down and i just you\nknow brain dumped put them all down okay\ni've got to do this for this person this\nfor this person this thing has to happen\nyou know i got to make sure that i plan\nall my podcast episodes i've got to\nrecord all the podcast episodes this\nthis this all of these things i put them\nall down on a piece of paper right then\nwhat i did is i took each individual one\nand started working through it right i\nstarted working through each individual\none\nand then helped myself come up with a\nplan and so let me show you how this\nworks so next time you feel some anxiety\nnow i this isn't going to happen in the\nmiddle\ngoing to help you in the middle of a\npanic attack i promise you that because\nby the time you're in a panic attack\nyou're already too far like you're too\nfar you just have to wait till that\ncalms down\nbut if you feel just anxious thoughts\nyou feel sad you don't feel right this\nis something that you could use so you\nwrite down and say what am i feeling\nanxious about what am i not liking what\nam i fearing right now whatever it is\nthat's there in front of you you write\nit down you take it out of your head you\nput it on that piece of paper right the\nnext thing that you ask yourself is\nwhat's the worst that could happen now\nyou might think this is not a good\nquestion to ask somebody who's in the\nmiddle of having anxious thoughts but it\nis because i'm going to show you exactly\nwhy that is right so what's the worst\nthat could happen\nthe next question is what's the best\nthat can happen\nright because i want to contrast the\nworst that can happen\nand then the last step is what last\nquestion is what is my next best step to\nmake me feel better right now\nright\nso let's go through those questions and\ntalk about why they're important and\nexactly how to work through them okay\nyou write down the question what am i\nfeeling anxious about and you write down\nall of the things that you might be\nfeeling anxious about all of those right\nwe all have things that can pop up in\nthe back your head we all have busy\nmoments we all have stressful moments we\nall have sad moments in our life but\nwhat we're doing by actually writing it\ndown and not letting it be\non the you know in our head anymore or\nputting on a piece of paper is we're\nbasically in that room trying to punch\nsomebody in the dark and we flip the\nlights on and we're like oh they're\nright there i see him\nthat alone\nninety percent of the time makes\nsomebody go\nokay it's on a piece of paper i feel so\nmuch better about it because it's not\nabstract anymore it's there it's it's\nit's literally tangible i can see it on\nthat piece of paper usually that starts\nthe relief and a lot of times people\ndon't know what's making them feel\nanxious and so when they're able to take\nit put it down and identify it it\nalready just by writing it down makes\nthem feel so much better right so that's\nthe first thing let's identify maybe\nit's one thing maybe it's 17 things like\nit was for me\nright now let's go into what's the worst\nthat could happen\nhere's why this is important\nis because when you don't put it on\npaper and you're dealing with it\nabstractly\nyour brain makes up these fears that are\ncompletely illogical and are ridiculous\nright oh my gosh if i don't you know end\nup getting this done i'm going to lose\nmy house and my kids and my family and\nlike that's where your brain immediately\ngoes to the worst possible outcome\nso i'm going to put down the what's the\nworst that could happen so that i can\nliterally see it and go oh my god that's\nridiculous that's never going to happen\nright because 99.9 of the time it never\ngets as bad as your brain actually makes\nit before you put on a piece of paper\nso when you write down what's the worst\nthat could happen and it's like oh i\ncould lose my job and my family could be\nhomeless and my kids could be homeless\nand my wife could divorce me and i could\nbe a terrible father and you look at it\nand you're like uh yeah but that's not\ngonna happen like that's that's\nridiculous\nand usually that's what happens when you\nactually take it and put it down on\npaper and you see it you identify you\nonce again flip the lights on so that\nyou can see what's going on in your head\nso what's the worst that could happen i\nwant to identify that and i want to get\nclear on what that is\nbecause then i can go ah that's not\ngoing to happen i'm not going to let\nthat happen all right let's go to the\nnext step what's the best that can\nhappen\nright so let's look at it positively\nso if i'm up all night i'm going okay\nlike for instance we have this event\nthat's coming up i have to get the event\nthe contract the av video team i've got\nto negotiate all that stuff i've got to\nget the the place figured out you know\nwe've already got it i've got to get the\ncontract signed all that stuff we've got\nto get the audio video team completely\nseparate got to get them negotiated get\nthe contract done for them then i\nstarted thinking about all the things\nthat i'm planning and the worst that\ncould happen is that it doesn't happen\nright and that would suck but it's not\nthe world's not going to end the best\nthat could happen is we have you know a\nbunch of people show up to it everybody\ngets there safely they feel amazing\nthey're able to make new connections and\n100 lives are impacted right\nthat's pretty damn exciting and so now\ni'm looking at the what's the worst that\ncould happen and going ah that's\nprobably not going to happen and then\ni'm looking at what's the best that\ncould happen and i actually feel better\nabout this thing that i was having\nanxious thoughts about that kept me\nawake for a while right\nusually it doesn't go as good as you\nthink it's going to go but it goes way\nway way way way way better\nthan the worst that could happen right\nif there's like a medium ground and and\nthe worst is all the way over to the\nright and the best is all the way over\nto the left usually in that medium\nground it's going to swing a little bit\nmuch more towards the left than is the\nright so i want to actually identify\nwhat is the best thing that could happen\nthrough this like so if you're in the\nmiddle of a divorce and that divorce\nobviously you don't want to go through\nthat sucks i can't even understand what\nthat would feel like to go through\nsomething like that right\nbut you could go what's the worst that\ncould happen you can work through and\nthey say what's the best that could\nhappen will we go through this divorce\nwe go our separate ways and i become a\nfree person and i can refine myself\nbecause i felt like i lost myself in\nthat relationship and then you're like\noh my god what can what how amazing\nwould it be for me to find myself and\nwho i truly am and who i've grown into\nbecause i grew apart from this person\nand then maybe you actually get excited\nabout divorce because you're like that\nsounds awesome i do want to get this\ndivorce right so it can take something\nthat seems positive and turn it into\nnegative right so what's the best that\ncould happen is the next question and\nthen the last question is what is my\nnext best step to make me feel better\nright now\nright what is my next best step to make\nme feel better right now what action can\ni take to make me feel better right\nso for me\nwhat it was i was like okay if i'm\nlooking at all these things i put down\nall of the action plans of exactly what\ni needed to do in all of those 17\ncategories all the stuff that that i\nneed to do i was like oh okay yeah i can\ndo this tomorrow morning once you know\nonce everybody wakes up and i can get on\nthe phone calls and i can negotiate and\ndo all the stuff i can get my team on it\nas well\nso i was like okay i'm looking at all\nthis stuff it's four o'clock in the\nmorning 4 45 in the morning i can't do\nanything about it right now for most of\nthese so what's the next best step for\neach one of these did them okay bought\nit wrote them all down now what i'm\ngoing to do the next best steps to make\nme feel better right now\ni was like what's the next best step\ni need to meditate i need to focus on\nwhat i'm grateful for because i have so\nmuch to be grateful for in my life like\nit's amazing and i'm focusing on these\nthings that are kind of trivial and you\nknow i'm not saying all of people's\nthings that they're stressing out about\nare trivial like mine happen to be but\nit's not going to ruin my life in these\ncircumstances so i was like you know\nwhat i need to focus on gratitude\nbecause if i come from a place of\ngratitude if i come from a place of love\nequanimity peace\ni'm going to\ngo into all of these 17 things and feel\nbetter\nso i was like all right i'm going to\nmeditate i'm going to focus on gratitude\nyou know maybe for you guys it might be\nlike okay i need to have a conversation\nwith this person that's the very first\nthing i need to do right now right maybe\nit's like i need to go work out i need\nto go for a run\ni need to call a friend i need to call\nmy business partner because this thing\nthat happened to us has really been\nstressing me out and i haven't had the\nconversation they need to that's why i'm\nstressed out you know what screw it i'm\ngonna have the conversation right now\nright because then what happens is i've\nidentified my anxiety culprit\nright i've shined the light on it i've\nidentified what could happen the worst\nthat could happen i've identified the\nbest that could happen\nand now i have the action that i need to\ntake in order to make me feel better\nand by doing all of this at literally 4\n45 5 o'clock in the morning made me feel\nso much better and i went from not being\nable to fall asleep to okay i've got\neverything on a piece of paper it's all\nready to go\nas soon as i can start doing work in the\nmorning i was like i'm gonna put on\nmeditation i'm gonna feel some gratitude\ni'm gonna try to make myself feel better\nand i i i consciously breathed for 20\nminutes and i was consciously\nand when i was breathing i was going i'm\ngoing to feel my body relax with every\nsingle out breath for 20 minutes i was\nlike i'm gonna consciously feel my body\nand i went from this this high\nvibrational buzzing state of like oh my\ngosh anxiety stress stress anxiety\ntwo calm peace felt amazing\nwhat happened\nfell asleep\ni was like whoa\nwake up a couple hours later on my couch\ndid my morning routine i got my journal\ni looked at all of the things\nand then one by one started knocking out\nevery single one of them and had a super\nfreaking productive day\nand all of the anxiety around everything\nwas gone all of the stress around\neverything was gone\nwhy because it was all in my head i\nneeded to take it out of my head i\nneeded to shine a light on it i needed\nto work through what's the worst that\ncould happen the best that could happen\nand what is the immediate steps that i\nneed to do right now to make myself feel\nbetter so i woke up i did my morning\nroutine i got my journal looked through\nall of the stuff that i had started\nknocking everything out\nbecause i had my action plans i had\nexactly what needed to be done\nbut the most important part was number\none identifying\nwhat was going on excuse me\nthen what did i do after that\ni actually went\nyou know what i'm gonna write it all\ndown i took it all out of my head and i\nput it down on a piece of paper\nright get it out of your head\nput it down\nso you're not not trying to grab water\nanymore so you're not trying to punch\nthat person in the dark flip the light\non see the person and go up there it is\nthat's the thing that i need to work\ntowards\nso know that when you're feeling anxious\nthoughts there is a strategy to get out\nof it this is the four steps the four\nquestions to ask yourself\nnext time you feel stressed worried fear\nanxiety any of those negative feelings i\nwant you to use this try it and i\nguarantee it'll make you feel better i'm\ngonna give you my number one tip for\novercoming anxiety\nand i'm going to be honest with you it's\nactually way more simple than you could\nthink\nbut that doesn't mean that it's easy\nit's actually even though it's so\nridiculously simple i know that for a\nmajority of people listening to this\nit's going to be really hard for you to\nactually do this to relieve your anxiety\nand i'm going to be completely honest\nwith you recently i've been so freaking\nbusy i've been spending so many plates\nwe have so many events that are coming\nup we're hiring new people we're\ncreating new programs we're making sure\nthat we give our clients who are\ncurrently paying us the best possible\nexperience that they can i'm on lives\ni'm talking to people i'm coaching\npeople all of this stuff it's literally\nlike a rocket ship and with a rocket\nship it's all good stuff\nbut if not kept at bay it can creep up\non you to be like a holy moment\nthere's a lot going on and i'm kind of\nstressed out about it and\nfor me i noticed the anxious thoughts\nstarting to creep in and so that's what\ni'm gonna tell you is what i've been\ndoing in the past couple weeks to kind\nof keep them at bay but especially not\njust me but with all of the stuff that's\nhappening in the world right now all of\nthe uncertainty of wha\nwhat's going on is the virus still here\nis it are we staying in lockdown we're\nin lockdown we're not in lockdown we're\nback and locked down again are we\nwearing masks we're not wearing masks\ncould i die from this there's so much\nanxious thoughts that are coming from\nthis this is going to help so many\npeople if you can just do this in your\nbrain even though you're trying to keep\nit at bay your brain's constantly in the\nbackground thinking is this happening is\nthis not happening am i safe am i not\nsafe how should i do this how should i\nwalk how should i am i able to walk up\nto person shake their hand are they\ngoing to be there's so many things so\nmany variables that are just all over\nthe place for people i'm going to teach\nyou how to try to keep those things at\nbay and how to calm them down so that\nyou can operate at the highest level\npossible for you and before i tell you\nmy secret there's one thing that's going\nto piss a lot of people off it's maybe\nnot piss people off it's going to make\nyou sad one thing that makes it\nabsolutely worse is caffeine\ni said it yes your coffee if you have\nanxious thoughts throughout the day if\nyou feel really way too stressed\nthroughout the day and you're drinking\ncoffee in the morning it is making it\nway\nworse way worse so i would recommend if\nyou're having anxious thoughts if you're\nhaving you know if you're getting\nanxiety if you're getting some little\nbit of feels like you're a little bit\ndepressed so that you're sad or that\nyou're super freaking stressed out wean\nyourself off of coffee for a little\nwhile right if you can't go cold turkey\nand you got to wean yourself off switch\nfrom from coffee to when you're making\ncoffee do half decaf half caffeinated\nand try that out for a little while and\nif you can't do that\ngo green tea just do something that has\nless caffeine so it you can start to not\nbe so dependent on it you'll notice your\nstress levels your anxiety levels go\ndown a ton so let me tell you what i've\nbeen doing it's super simple but it is\nridiculously profound once again just\nbecause it's easy\nand it's simple doesn't mean that it's\neasy to do and to make yourself do and\nif you're dealing with anxious thoughts\nthis definitely won't be easy but it's\nworth it and it works here's what it is\ni've been breathing\nand you guys are listening to me or\nprobably like no we all have right but i\ndon't mean just breathing i mean\nextremely intentional breathing and if\nyou've ever been on a live with me\nbefore if you've ever been on a zoom\ncall\na facebook live a live event i try to\nstart every single meeting that i do\nevery single morning when we do our team\ncalls we start off with breathing every\nsingle time that we get everyone\ntogether for our mastermind we start all\nof it with breathing and i'm going to go\nmuch deeper into what i do the reasons\nwhy i do this the science behind it for\nall of you analytical skeptics that are\nout there i'm gonna go through all of\nthese things in just a minute\nbut i want you to try this with me okay\nwe're gonna do something that we've\nnever done before in a podcast we're\ngonna breathe together and don't turn me\noff and be like oh i know how to breathe\ntrust me with this right there's a lot\nof science behind this if you're hanging\nout at home or you're in a good place\nyou can close your eyes while you do\nthis if you're driving your car don't\nrecommend closing your eyes and\nbreathing with me but you can still\nbreathe all of this will take about one\nminute okay\nhere's what we're gonna do you and i are\ngonna do six deep breaths together okay\nreason why is because there was a a\nchinese study that was done not too long\nago and they found that if you do six\nreally deep slow intentional breaths\nthat it can completely change your state\nbecause the breathing changes your heart\nrate and your heart rate changes the the\nbreathing and your heart rate both of\nthose together\nchange the hormones that are put into\nyour body so instead of cortisol and\nadrenaline which can be very stressful\nit can start to calm yourself down and\ngive you some dopamine some oxytocin\nsome serotonin the things that start to\ncalm you down and so here's what we're\ngoing to do we're going to breathe in\nthrough the nose you don't need to do it\nwith me i'll count it with you we're\ngoing to breathe in through the nose\nand when we exhale we're going to exhale\nthrough the mouth now\nwhen you do this on your own\nit's really important to try to make\nyour inhale and your exhale as long as\nyou possibly can and so when you do it\nyou could breathe in the nose you go\nand then breathe out and go\nif you wanted to but actually what you\nwant to do is you want to try to take\nyour lips and make the smallest hole\nthat you possibly can and breathe out\nand that will actually\nslow down the breathing process and\nthere's a fact it's literally a fact\nthat when you you start to do a long\nexhale\nthat it actually makes your your heart\nstart beating slower and when your heart\nstarts beating slower obviously that\nwill calm me down we're not going to do\nthat you can't do it if you want to but\nin a typical time when you're doing\nthese 60 breaths it'd be more of\nand you just let it out as slow as you\npossibly can but for time's sake just\nbreathe with me instead we're gonna do a\nlittle bit different okay so if you can\ndo it close your eyes if you can't close\nyour eyes don't close your eyes but i'm\ngoing to count you through all you got\nto do is just breathe with me so inhale\nthrough the nose exhale through the\nmouth so inhale\nexhale\ninhale\nexhale\ninhale\nexhale\ninhale\n[Music]\nexhale\ninhale\nexhale\nand last one inhale\nand exhale\nokay\nhow do you feel\ndo you feel a little bit better do you\nfeel a little bit calmer do you feel a\nlittle bit less anxious a little bit\nless stressed\nright it's literally just breathing but\nit is intentional breathing is obviously\nwhat's important now here's the\nimportant things as as you go through\nthis what we didn't do is we didn't even\ngo a little bit more advanced the more\nadvanced is when you breathe in i want\nyou to breathe in to your stillness find\nthe stillness that you can in your\nbreathing in and in your exhale what i\nwant you to do is i want you to breathe\nout the breathe out the stress\nbreathe out the worry breathe out the\nto-do list breathe out the thoughts\nbreathe out all of those things i want\nyou to just try to connect to the\nstillness that is inside of you do you\nfeel different\ni know if you did it right you probably\ndo even if you didn't do it right you\nprobably still feel different slow\nintentional breathing has been shown\nscientifically to reduce anxiety and\ndepression inside of people don't\nunderestimate the power of your\nbreathing now i'm gonna go deeper into\ntelling you guys what i've been doing\njust besides that to help you guys out\nwith the anxiety and anxious thoughts\nand stress and worrying all about stuff\nbut if you just look at what's important\nto humans right like food for instance\nyou cannot eat food for weeks you can go\nwithout food for weeks and still live\nwater\nyou can go a couple days without water\nbut breath\nmaybe a couple minutes so if we're\nranking breath water food\non the important scale what's the most\nimportant clearly breath is breath is\nthe first thing to change whenever your\nstate changes when you get excited it's\nclinically shown that the very first\nthing to change in somebody during\nexcitement is the breath inside of\nsomebody when you get anxious feelings\nwhen you feel anxiety the very first\nthing to change in you before your\nhormones before your thoughts any of\nthose things is your breath when you\nfeel fear the very first thing to change\ninside of you is your breath and so what\ndo we do is if we want to change our own\nstate we intentionally change our\nbreathing to intentional breathing\nand that's how you bring your body back\nto normal since i've been telling you\ni've been so freaking busy and a little\nbit anxious and stressed out over the\npast week how have i been using this\ni've been sitting down and forcing\nmyself to not just do 60 breaths but to\ndo this as long as possible until i can\nfeel\nthat the anxious thoughts\nthe stress the worry the fear whatever's\npopping up in my head is going away\nuntil i feel different and if i'm being\nhonest with you it usually takes about\n20 25 30 minutes to feel this way this\nis the hard part about it this is why\npeople have so much struggle\nto meditation is because there's so much\nanxiety that comes up so many anxious\nthoughts the to-do lists the fears all\nof those things come up\nand it's basically like your\nsubconscious your ego fighting against\nyou to\nyou know the easiest way to think about\nit is if you put a child to bed the\nlittle kid will fight and fight and\nfight to going to bed even though\nthere's they need to go to bed and\nthey're wanting to go to bed and they're\nangry and they're crazy because they are\nso tired\nthey fight to not go to bed and that\nfighting and staying up makes them even\nmore angry and even more emotional\nthat's exactly what happens when you sit\ndown when you're anxious and you try to\nmeditate all of the anxious feelings\nwill do everything that they can to make\nyou not sit down and meditate and so\nwhat you want to do when you sit down i\nliterally have been doing this every\nmorning for about 25 minutes and i can\nfeel myself start to get even more\nanxious\nduring the first 5 10 15 minutes of\nmeditation and then eventually my body\nkind of calms down and it's like okay\nwe're not going to do this we're going\nto chill and so what you want to do is\nyou can either feel the breath going in\nyour nose and out of your mouth in your\nnose out of mouth and just pay attention\nthat feeling or what i've been doing is\nfeeling the muscles around my stomach i\ncan feel the muscles on my stomach when\ni breathe in i can feel them go out\naround my diaphragm and when i breathe\nout i can feel them going in and all i\nsay is breathing in in my head i'm\nsaying breathing in\nand breathing out\nand breathing in and breathing out and\nyour mind will wander it'll go all over\nthe place it'll try to fight it'll try\nto say no this isn't what you should be\ndoing but just like you know like i know\nthat for for our puppy he goes crazy\nsometimes he bites toby and toby's 12\nyears old and our puppies eight years\nold eight months old and he goes crazy\non him and we have to train him not to\ndo those types of things so what we'll\ndo is we'll hold him in place and be\nlike no that's not what you do and he'll\nfight in a fight and fight in a fight\nand fight and then she's like\nand he literally does a breath if you've\never noticed when your dog goes to lay\ndown what do they do they go\nand they breathe out that's what dogs do\nto calm themselves down so you have to\nrealize that you have to sit there and\nyou have to fight through the anxious\nfeelings because you're going to feel\nmore anxious when you sit down to\nbreathe promise you that and so what i\ndo is i do this breathing\nslow in through the nose slow out\nthrough the mouth\nfor 15 20 30 minutes sometimes 45\nminutes at a time and i can feel myself\nfight it and fight it and fight it and\nfight it and fight it and fight it and\nfight it and eventually it's like\nand it just kind of gives out and what\nam i doing i'm destroying the anxious\nthoughts i'm getting rid of the anxious\nthoughts i'm getting rid of the stress\ni'm getting rid of the fear i'm getting\nrid of the worry anything that's going\nthrough my mind i'm telling my mind i\nwill not allow you to act the way that\nyou're acting because anxiety and stress\nand worry and fear all come from your\nthoughts\nthey do and so i'm telling my mind i'm\nnot going to allow you to do this i'm\nnot going to allow you to do this i'm\nnot going to allow you to do this and\nit's going to fight and it's going to\nfight it's going to fight it's going to\nfight and then it's going to go all\nright fine\nand it might take 15 to 20 minutes to\neven get to the all right fine but if\nyou don't want to feel anxious anymore\nthen that's just something that you need\nto do it's not that you don't have\nenough time it's just that you're not\nwilling to do it don't ever say that i\ndon't have enough time just say it's not\na priority right so if you're wanting\nto stop being so anxious if you're\nwanting to calm down if you're wanting\nto stop worrying it comes from your your\nbreath because your breath is in charge\nof every feeling that you have and you\nbreak through those feelings and that's\nwhat you're trying to conquer is those\nanxious thoughts the worry the stress\nthe fear the feelings\nyou're just trying to get all those to\nsubside and eventually you'll find a\nplace where you'll be in and it might\ntake you some time but you'll go you\nknow what\ni feel pretty good i feel like this\nbreathing exercise is done you don't\neven have to call it meditation because\ni guess it's not even meditation it can\nbe if you want it to be or you can just\nsay you know what i'm just going to\nbreathe i'm not going to put any time to\nit all i'm going to do is i'm going to\nwait until my anxious thoughts my stress\nmy worries my fears all of those things\nsubside and then i'm going to give\nmyself a few minutes to rest in that\npiece and know that i can always come\nback to this piece and when you do this\nyou'll realize that your day is\ncompletely different\ncompletely different so you do this when\nyou first wake up because that's usually\nwhen your cortisol is at the highest\nwhich means you're stressing out which\nmeans that you're worried that you have\nanxious thoughts that's when it's the\nhighest for me cortisol is usually\nactually what wakes you up and cortisol\nis the stress hormone so i feel it in\nthe morning so i force myself to calm\ndown i force myself i'm going to be the\none that's in charge of my brain i'm not\ngoing to let my brain be able to do\nwhatever it wants to do i'm going to\nwrangle it and i'm going to make it calm\ndown and i'm going to get rid of my\nanxious thoughts my feelings my worry my\nstress by simply going back to the\nbreath this is something that you can do\nat any moment at any time anywhere in\nthe world\nthroughout the day this is something\nthat will make you more powerful because\nwhen you can control your mind you can\ncontrol everything else around you but\nonce again it's so simple but it's not\neasy you've got to force yourself to do\nit and you've got to know\nlast thing i'll say you've got to know\nthat your mind is going to fight you for\na little while and it's going to be\nreally freaking hard to stay still\nyou've got to go against those feelings\nand eventually like a child who's just\nfighting not to go to bed eventually\nthey're gonna fall asleep and eventually\nyour feelings are gonna subside energy\nshould be one of the most important\nthings that you think about every single\nday how much energy you have because we\nonly have 24 hours every single day you\nhave 24 hours i have 24 hours everybody\nhas 24 hours the life that you have in\nthe life that you will create is\ndependent upon\nwhat you do in that time but if you\ndon't have energy it's like living your\nlife like you're driving a you know an\n18-wheeler have you ever seen an\n18-wheeler try to get going it takes a\nwhile it takes a while it takes a while\nwhen in reality if you plan a plan a\nplan and pay attention to your energy\nthroughout the day you can get your body\nto move like a ferrari so if i were to\nsay hey\nlife is a race would you like an\n18-wheeler or would you like a ferrari\nyou're probably going to pick the\nferrari right why because it goes faster\nso let's talk about i'm going to give\nyou four key topics we're going to dive\ninto pretty in-depth today as far as\nenergy goes as to why most people are\ntired but then also if you pay attention\nthese and really plan them out these\nwill all help you have more energy\nthroughout the day so\nfour key factors number one\nobviously is going to be sleep so let's\ndive into sleep uh we're going to talk\nabout ways to sleep better and we're\nalso going to talk about how to stay\nawake better as well so first thing that\nyou want to think about when you wake up\nin the morning some some of you wake up\nwhen the sun is already up some of you\nguys wake up after this before the sun\nis up some of you guys wake up after the\nsun is up and the first thing that you\nwant to do is when the sun comes out in\nthe morning you want to try to get sun\non your skin and you want to get it on\nas much of your skin as possible so if\nyou happen to live you've got nowhere\nnear you get butt ass naked go outside\nget get some sunlight make sure the kids\naren't around on your body the more that\nyou can get on you the better don't get\na sunburn or anything like that if you\nlive in downtown miami but the sun comes\nup and it hits you on your balcony don't\nget butt naked on your balcony and then\nblame it on me you know go out there in\nyour bathing suit get some sun on your\nskin there's a couple reasons why this\nis important number one the sun in your\nskin tells your brain to stop making\nmelatonin and i'm to give you another\ntip on that as well and number two it\nsets your circadian cycle which is the\nsleep cycle that you have so you want to\nget out and actually get the sun on your\nskin for just a few minutes doesn't have\nto be anything too long the second thing\nthat you want to do while you're out\nthere as well you may have heard me talk\nabout this before is to go and actually\nlook at the blue in the sky so you don't\nwant to look at the sun itself you want\nto look at the blue\nthe receptors in your eye when they see\nthat blue what they do is they stop\nmaking melatonin as well now let me give\nyou a secret uh for those of you guys\nthat are out there and you have sad\nwhich is uh seasonal effectiveness\ndisorder which i found that i have when\nit's gloomy for a while you notice like\ni can usually tell what the weather is\nwhen i wake up\nbefore because if i feel like i'm\ndragging ass and it's hard for me to get\nout of bed there's a pretty good chance\nlike it is today in austin right now\nit's kind of rainy it's not the most\nbeautiful day\nbut if i jump out of bed it's easier for\nme to go to bed usually there's not a\ncloud in the sky\nso some people are affected by this by\nthe cloud some people aren't it depends\non who you are there's a thing called\nthe philips blue light and there's other\ncompanies that make these as well but i\nknow the one that i have is called the\nphillips blue light and what you want to\ndo is if you notice if you live in a\nplace with some really long winters or\ndoesn't get a whole lot of sun what you\ndo is you take this thing you actually\nput it in the corner you don't look\ndirectly at it but if you're gonna sit\nthere and work on your computer you put\nit off to the side and your eyes will\nstart to actually see that blue which\ntells the melatonin to stop being made\nin your brain which then allows you to\nwake up and have more energy\nso another thing you want to do when you\ntalk about the blue is you want to try\nto when the sun starts to set you want\nto try to remove as much blue from your\nenvironment as possible so the first\nthing that you got to think about is\nyour phone your phone has a whole hell\nof a lot of blue there's something\ncalled night shift on iphone samsung's\nall the other phones i don't androids i\ndon't know what they're called but night\nshift when the sun starts to set it\nstarts to take the blue and turn it more\ninto red why is this important well the\nsame reason why blue makes you wake up\nin the morning is the same reason why\nblue makes you stay awake in the evening\nso you want to start removing blue from\nyour environment\nanother thing that you need to do you\nneed to start thinking about your\ncomputer if you have a macbook i have a\nmacbook there's something that's free\nit's called flux f l dot what is it f\ndot l u x flux same exact thing as night\nshift is when it is the sun starts to\nset it knows where you on the world it\nwill actually start to change the blues\nin your screen to red which then allows\nyou it makes it easier to fall asleep um\nthis is the reason why you see so many\npeople wearing blue blockers at night\nwhen they're starting to go to bed it's\nbecause if you're watching tv if you're\nwalking around your house these blue\nblockers those glasses tend to take the\nblue out of your your vision so it\nallows you to fall asleep better because\nmost of the time humans 100 000 years\nago we're not staying up at 11 30 12\no'clock at night they were going to bed\na little bit after the sun went down\nright so you have a couple different\nthings number one you have night shift\non your phone you have flux on your\nmacbook you have blue blockers as well\num you want to try to get away from your\nphone you want to try to get away from\nyour tv 30 minutes to an hour before\nyou're going to go to bed and here's one\nthing that i don't really hear many\npeople talk about is you also want to\nstay away from overhead lights so in my\nhouse we have lights literally built\ninto the ceiling right you want to try\nto stay away from those at night and the\nreason why is because you actually have\nreceptors on the bottom of your eyes\nthat actually notice that there's light\nabove your head which your brain thinks\nis what the sun and so at night you\nactually don't want to have overhead\nlighting on you want to have lamps that\nare on the ground about eye level or\nlower that are actually producing light\nthat you have at night so what you're\ndoing is you're tricking your brain into\nthinking hey you know it's about time to\ngo to bed so that you can fall asleep\nyou can get better rem sleep you can get\nbetter deep sleep as well um\nturn off the overhead lights get rid of\nall the blue as much as you possibly can\nnext thing when we dive into sleep\nitself is make sure that your room is as\nblack as you possibly can make it like\nif you can make it so you can't see your\nhand in front of your face at night\nthat's perfect you want it to be that\nway and the reason why is because you\nactually have photoreceptors on your\nskin and those photoreceptors are\nbasically like little eyes so even if\nyour eyes are closed your skin the photo\nreceptors on your skin still know that\nthere's light out there so you want to\ntry to make your room as dark as\npossible do not i know there's some\npeople out here i'm going to i'm going\nto disappoint you you probably already\nknow the answer to this anyways you are\nyou know you shouldn't be watching you\nshouldn't have the freaking tvo when you\ngo to bed it's not good for you number\none the photoreception in your eyes are\nstill noticing that there's light inside\nof the room so it's going to mess your\nsleep up and as well it's going to\nyou know it's going to\nas you're hearing it it's going to keep\nyour brain semi awake because your brain\neven when you're asleep is still\nlistening the whole time that you're\nasleep like if you're asleep deep sleep\nand you hear a loud bang in your house\nit's going to wake you up that's because\nyour brain is still awake so if you're\nlistening to if your brain is listening\nto the tv all night long it's going to\nbe keeping you out of rem sleeping out\nof deep sleep and not getting the sleep\nthat you need to therefore you're not\ngoing to have the energy that you need\nto if you have to fall asleep with\nsomething on get a fan you know get some\nwhite noise machine\nmy dog snores like crazy he snores\nlouder than the average human toby 12\nyears old snores louder than anybody\ni've ever met i have to have a white\nnoise machine or else i don't sleep when\nhe's inside the room so we have a white\nnoise machine inside of our room right\nnext thing you think about as well your\nbed your bed does it suck one of the\nthings that people don't invest enough\nmoney into is their bed\nreason why is because they're cheap i\ndon't know but but the reason why it's\nimportant is because of the fact that\nyou spend one third of your life right\nthe average person sleeps for eight\nhours a night if you sleep for eight\nhours that is one-third of the 24 hours\nthat you have in a day right so one\nthird of your life is spent on a bed\nmake sure that you have a really good\nbed that gets you into rem sleep to get\nyou in a deep sleep there's tons of\ndifferent you know apple watches now and\num beds that that measure it and or\nthere's a thing called an oral ring uh\nwhoop all of these things measure your\nsleep at night and so you can measure\nthem to actually see if you really want\nto get deep into it and see how you're\nsleeping and start to get down to it and\nget nerdy on it you can get really nerdy\non how well you're sleeping so if you\nwant to have more energy the first thing\nyou got to think about is how is your\nsleep right if you have no energy\nthroughout the day it might be because\nyou're just not taking the right\nmeasures when you fall asleep okay\nthat's the first thing i think about\nalways with energy obviously is sleep\nsecond thing obvious diet\nwhat are you eating throughout the day\nright\ndigestion is the most energy consuming\nthing that your body does there is\nnothing more that your body does it's\nmore energy consuming than digestion\nso if you're eating stuff that's very\nheavy that's very greasy it's very fatty\nthat's fast foods you're not going to\nhave energy and the reason why is\nbecause your body is using the energy\nand shutting everything else down so\nthat it can get this food out of your\nbody because it's like we got to get\nthis out right so what are you eating\nthroughout the day\nyou know if you're eating a heavy\nbreakfast if you're eating a heavy lunch\nif it's greasy if it's fast food all\nthese things that i said it's going to\nbe slowing you down another thing to\nthink about that a lot of people don't\nthink about as well is have you done an\nallergy test to see if you have any food\nallergies because if you have food\nallergies that's your body going there's\nsomething that's an emergency we've got\nto get it out and it's going to use as\nmuch energy as it can to get rid of\nwhatever it is that you're allergic to\nso what type of food you're eating\nnormally what ends up being the best for\npeople\nfood that they eat throughout the day to\ntry to give you the most energy you know\nyou can do uh leafy greens light greens\nmaybe some chicken on top of it whatever\nit is that works for you maybe some you\nknow beans and corn on top of it\nwhatever it is that that will give you\nenergy everybody's body is different so\nwhat gives me energy might take energy\naway from you and vice versa so what\ndoes your energy look like throughout\nthe day after you eat when you have\nlunch are you tired after lunch that's\nsomething that you should eliminate from\nyour diet if you're tired after lunch so\nstart paying attention to the things\nthat make you tired right\nnormally what i like to have throughout\nthe day a shake it's just easy gets down\neasy to digest i get a lot of nutrients\nfrom it i'm good to go for throughout\nthe rest of the day usually my biggest\nmeal is at dinner i just do that because\ni usually have a lot more energy\nthroughout the day if i eat less that's\njust the way it happens to be for me and\ni had an interview that's coming out\npretty soon with dr david sinclair dr\ndavid sinclair is the head of aging at\nharvard and we were talking about the\nwhole thing and you know just the stuff\nthat you ate throughout the day and he\nrecommends you skip at least one meal\nper day number one it'll make you live\nlonger and number two it'll also give\nyou a lot more energy right so if we're\ntalking about diet as well\nanother thing to think about is caffeine\nuh-oh i'm about to offend a whole lot of\npeople here we go\nin case you didn't know the half-life of\ncaffeine is seven hours what does\nhalf-life mean half-life means it takes\nthe half if if i have\na hundred milligrams of of caffeine\nright\nthe half-life would be how long does it\ntake for it to be half of the amount so\nfrom 100 milligrams to 50 milligrams\nwhat's crazy is that the half-life of\ncaffeine is five to seven hours\nso if you are a late caffeine drinker so\nlet's say i have a coffee at 4 pm\nthat means that 11 o'clock at night half\nof that caffeine is still in my body\nright so at 11 pm my 4 pm coffee half of\nthat is still in my body and hasn't\ngotten released yet so you have to think\nto yourself if i want to be able to\nsleep better i should probably start\npaying attention to the caffeine that i\nhave and the caffeine intake that i have\nonce again half-life of five to seven\nhours so i recommend and what i always\nsay is you know one o'clock is probably\nthe lace that you should have some form\nof caffeine\nif you've been listening to my podcast\nlong enough you've heard me talk about\nit i really don't drink a whole lot of\ncoffee anymore even though i love coffee\nwhat i've switched to is yerba mate the\nreason why i switched to yerba mate is\nbecause caffeine the coffee caffeine\nwhen you drink coffee there's a massive\nspike in caffeine and then you know the\ncoffee drops when you have a couple\nhours later the cof it just drops and\nyour energy drops so you might have a\nmassive spike in a massive drop and\nthat's why you don't have energy\nthroughout the day\nif you do want to have caffeine instead\nof having it in coffee if you have it in\nsomething like yerba mate and some other\ntypes of tea\nyerba mate everybody always sends me a\nmessage and asks y-e-r-b-a\nspace m-a-t-e that's yerba mate uh your\nliver digests your liver and your body\ndigests it differently than coffee and\nso instead of a massive spike and a\nmassive drop it's a massive spike and\nthen it takes about five hours for your\nbody to drop that so instead of having a\nmassive drop it's a lot easier of a drop\nso something to think about think about\nthe caffeine when you're taking it when\nyou're not taking it\nand remember five to seven hour\nhalf-life is caffeine inside of your\nbody\nso last thing i think about as well\nsorry the the third thing i think about\nsecond to last thing i think about uh is\nexercise\nthe more that you exercise even though\nit doesn't make a whole lot of sense the\nmore energy that you use inside of\nexercise the more your body will\nactually start to make more energy so if\nyou start exercising a lot a lot a lot a\nlot a lot your body will start to make\nmore energy every single day right so if\nyou're somebody who's very tired\nthroughout the day you don't have a\nwhole lot of energy one of the questions\ni'm going to ask you is how much do you\nexercise\nwhat kind of\nforce do you put through your body\nthrough and what do you do throughout\nthe day\num if you exercise more your body's\ngoing to create more energy find out\nwhen your best time to create more\nenergy is for you so for me\nworking out 9 a.m 10 a.m is usually my\nfavorite time to work out i have the\nopportunity to do so because i have my\nown business and i work from home it\nmight be the same for you it might not\nbe the same for you but when do you get\nthe most energy to work out when is your\nbest time to workout you should figure\nit out maybe it's six o'clock in the\nmorning four o'clock in the morning for\nyou maybe it's noon maybe it's 6 p.m\nfind out when the best time is for you\nto make sure that you're staying\nconsistent with your exercise if you're\ntired throughout the day there's a\npretty good chance that you're not\nworking out enough and your body runs\nmore efficiently whenever you start to\nwork out as well and it also helps you\nfall asleep and also helps you sleep\nbetter which in turn helps you get more\nenergy as well so think about your\nexercise how much you're exercising\nand the last thing i think about as far\nas why people are tired is your\nenvironment your environment will make\nyou tired as well think about the people\nthat you surround yourself with\ndo they give you energy do they strip\nenergy away from you if you're around\nthem for a half an hour do you feel more\nenergized or do you feel like crap after\nyou're done with them right so what does\nyour environment look like okay second\nthing what does your job look like if\nyou hate your job i promise you this it\nis stealing energy and sucking energy\nout of you it's also sucking your soul\naway\nprobably if you hate your job right\nthat's the way i felt when i hated my\njob is it was like just soul-sucking to\nbe\nto be there when i was younger and i was\nat a job right so the job you have can\nbe stealing your energy away from you\nmaybe your co-workers at your job are\nstealing your energy away from you right\ndo you sit all day long think about that\nuh one of the things that they recommend\nis getting up and going for a walk even\nif it's three or four minutes every\nsingle hour get your body moving if\nyou're not moving a lot throughout the\nday your body's going to make less\nenergy so if you don't have a whole lot\nof energy throughout the day are you\nsitting most of the day right let's talk\nabout how to make energy on demand real\nquick one of the things i've been doing\na lot lately\ni found it from one of my friends that\nwe did it during a workout is this thing\ncalled ski breaths and what you do is\nyou breathe in through the nose and you\nbreathe out through the mouth but when\nyou breathe in\nyou take your hands and a fist you put\nthem above your head and when you\nbreathe out\nyou breathe out and push down as if\nyou're like a skier right so\nfor those of you guys listening on the\npodcast you don't know what the hell i'm\ndoing for those you guys watching on\nvideo\nand you do it over but you do it\naggressively hands up breath breathe in\nthrough your nose hands down you breathe\nout through your mouth and you do it\nover and over and over again do that for\na minute and two minutes you're gonna be\nout of breath it'll make your heart go\nlike crazy and it will wake you up that\nis how you get your body to wake up to\nforce yourself to make more energy so if\nyou feel like you're if you feel like\nit's three o'clock and you're dragging\nass and you're not getting as much done\nyou still have a lot to do for the day\nbut you know oh my gosh i can't drink\ncoffee because i won't fall asleep\ntonight\nforce your body through movement and\nthrough breath to give you energy on\ndemand your body is a beautiful thing if\nyou need energy you can force your body\nto trick itself to create energy if like\nyou know if it was a hundred thousand\nyears ago and you and i are really tired\nand we're walking through wherever the\nhell we live a hundred thousand years\nago and uh you and i are in a walk and a\ncheetah pops out of the bush and starts\nchasing them so we won't be like oh i'm\ntoo tired you know no your body's going\nto click in it's going to force itself\nto make energy so how can you trick your\nbody to exactly the same one of the ways\nthrough these ski breaths works so well\nbreathe into the nose put your arms\nabove your head breathe out through your\nmouth push them down as if you're skiing\non you know snow\nget the heart rate up move more\nnext thing i think as well as far as\nyour environment goes how do you talk to\nyourself in your head like do you tell\nyourself you don't have energy because i\npromise you this if you tell yourself oh\ni'm so tired you say you're tired to\npeople if you say it out loud all the\ntime if you say you're a tired person\nsay you didn't sleep well all that stuff\nyou will feel more tired if you say\nyou're tired i promise you that so start\nto think about that do you say how tired\nyou are throughout the day and then also\nhow do you talk to yourself in your head\ndo you build yourself up or do you talk\nshitty to yourself if you talk trash to\nyourself if you're negative if you have\nnegative self-talk i guarantee you that\nnegative self-talk is going to make you\nfeel worse about yourself it's going to\nmake you feel worse and in turn it's\ngoing to steal energy away from you\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nthe 9 ways to naturally have more energy\ni'm going to give you some that are\ngoing to be decently obvious but i'm\ngoing to give you some tips around how\nto make them better and i'm going to\ngive you some that are just going to be\nsomething you probably never thought of\nbefore so the first one as how to have\nmore energy is to get some sleep now you\nmight be like well no well let's dive\ndeeper into sleep\nsleep is obviously extremely important\nfor your energy but there's a couple\nhacks that you can definitely have\nnumber one your room should be as dark\nas possible when you sleep you should\nfigure out how much sleep you need for\nme it's about seven and a half to eight\nhours i can sleep for 13 hours straight\nif nobody wakes me up though i just\ncan't sleep but if i'd go too long then\ni don't feel good if i go too short i\ndon't feel good so i've come to realize\nthat my natural time is about seven and\na half to eight hours which is common\nwith people right make sure your room is\nreally dark\nusually it helps if you're colder as\nwell and one of the things that that\nhelps with sleep is making sure that you\nkeep a very consistent time you go to\nbed and you wake up at the exact same\ntimes every single night every single\nmorning during the week\nand also during the weekend so it's very\nimportant to keep your circadian cycles\nexactly the same if you want to research\nmore about circadian cycles and how to\nhelp with them that is definitely one\nway to do it now one thing that helps\nwith that as well\neverybody seems to want to wake up\nearlier it's very simple to wake up\nearlier do you want to know how to do it\nyou just force yourself to wake up let's\nsay it's five o'clock and you're like\nput on the night owl i went to bed at\nmidnight all you gotta do is force\nyourself to wake up at five o'clock\nyou're gonna be more tired that night\nand you're naturally gonna start to fall\nasleep so if you wake up at five o'clock\nand five o'clock and five o'clock no\nmatter what your body will change its\ncircadian cycle and start to make you go\nto bed earlier a lot of people think\nthat they're night owls\nnobody's really a night owl very very\nfew like one out of a hundred people out\nof studies they've done and found that\nthat people are actually night owls what\nhappens is it's just the problem is that\npeople are around too many screens too\nmany screens they are keeping themselves\nup if you were to go okay when the sun\nsets i'm gonna read a book\ntry to keep yourself awake if that's\nwhat you did every single night you're\ngonna fall asleep first thing is sleep\nwhen you wake up one way that's going to\nhelp you when you break your sleep if\nyou've heard me talk about this before\nmy podcast is to walk outside you go and\nyou look at the blue in the sky because\nthe blue turns out it turns we have your\nreceptors in your eyes they tell your\nbrain to stop making melatonin and your\nbrain stops making melatonin which is\nthe thing that makes you fall asleep so\nthat you wake up earlier second thing\nthat you want to do to have more energy\nwhich goes with number one is to drink\nsome caffeine if that's something that\nyou're into now the secret is to not\ndrink caffeine within an hour of waking\nup because that's when your cortisol\nlevels are really high it's best to let\nyour cortisol levels drop and then have\ncaffeine about an hour to two hours\nafter you wake up so for those of you\nguys that have a lot of caffeine\nthis is a secret wait about an hour\nalong with caffeine is to stop drinking\ncaffeine at about noon if you really\nwant to have good sleep and have more\nenergy if you want to have a whole lot\nof energy you can stop drinking caffeine\ncompletely and eventually after about a\nmonth your body will start creating its\nown energy so caffeine is super\nimportant in this sense also what type\nof caffeine you have it's crazy i didn't\nknow there's so many different types of\nways you can get caffeine so there's\ncoffee which you could use but i'm\nstarting to drink less and less coffee\nover the past year and a half and i'm\nstarting to go more towards tea tea i\ndrink the most is called yerba mate\npeople always send me messages saying\nrob what is that tea that you talk about\nit's called yerba mate\ny-e-r-b-a-m-a-t-e yerba mate instead of\ndehydrating you like coffee does it\nactually hydrates you and it's got a lot\nmore nutrients inside of it as well it's\nalso got a lot of other stuff uh when i\nwas talking with\ndr andrew huberman who is the\nneurobiologist out of stanford he told\nme he drinks because there's a lot of\nextra things that are benefits for your\nbrain of actually taking your mate\nversus coffee so tip number two\nobviously is caffeine tip number three\ntake some b12 if you want to now i'm not\na doctor any sort of way so don't listen\nto anything that i say but i take b12\nsometimes throughout the day to get\nsomething natural without having this\nmassive spike of caffeine and then a\ndrop after so b12 is something that\ndefinitely helps as well super simple\ntip number four\nstop drinking so much alcohol actually\nif you really want to help yourself out\nstop drinking alcohol period if it's\nsomething that you could do i very\nrarely drink alcohol but this is\nsomething super interesting that\nhappened over the past week last week\nwas my girlfriend's birthday we went out\na couple times and i didn't even get\ndrunk at all i just had a couple glasses\nof wine and i wear this thing on my\nwrist when i go to sleep it's called\nduring the day mostly throughout the\nentire day and then also when i sleep\nit's called a whoop and it literally\ntracks your body the entire day and it\ntracks your recovery as well something\nreally crazy happened my recovery from\nhaving two glasses of wine completely\nplummeted even though i got more sleep\nthree of the nights we went out and we\nhad a couple glass of wine like her\nfriends were in town and then we went to\nsan antonio where she's from and then i\nhad two glasses of wine there\nmy recovery during sleep got destroyed\nfrom two glasses of wine alcohol stays\nin your system for up to 80 hours that's\nover three days it will affect you and\nso i always knew this but i was like i'm\ngonna have a couple glasses of wine no\nbig deal\nso on the days that i did not the four\nnights that i did not drink the two\nglass of wine my recovery\nwas around 90 to 94 percent which means\nthat i woke up and i had energy i woke\nup and i felt good i woke up and i\nimmediately was like cool i can work out\nno big deal what happened was\nthen i look at my whoop and i saw that\nevery day that i drank the the night\nthat i drank my sleep was around a 31 to\n35 percent which means that i didn't\nfeel anywhere near 100 those days so if\nyou want to have more energy\ndon't go home and drink a beer don't go\nhome and have a glass of wine for some\nof you guys like but hold on glasses of\nwines are actually good for your heart\nwell just so you know you can go back\nand listen to my interview that i did\nwith dr david sinclair who is the head\nof longevity at harvard and he actually\nsays that i think it's\nresveratrol i think is what it's called\nthe antioxidant that they found that's\ninside of wine red wine that they did a\nwhole article and said oh my gosh this\nis so good for you they've actually\nfound it's very small amounts and it\ndoesn't really do anything for you that\nwas just people over promoting that wine\nis good for you it's not bad bad bad for\nyou if you're going to drink just one\nglass of wine but what you have to\nrealize is this the thing about alcohol\nis that it will help you fall asleep\neasier but it will make your sleep worse\nand the reason why is because it changes\nyour respiratory rate and it also\nchanges your heart rate the other thing\nthat was interesting when i checked my\nrecovery every single night that i drank\nmy normal resting heart rate is about 50\nto 55 beats per minute when i'm sleeping\nit was literally up to 60 to 70 beats\nper minute just when i was sleeping\nafter having alcohol which means my\nheart rate went up 20 to 30 percent\nwhile i was sleeping it's not a good\nthing to have your heart rate be up\nwhile you're sleeping so\nif you want to have more energy stop\nhaving a glass of alcohol stop having a\nglass of wine stop having a drink when\nyou come home stop having beer it is\ndestroying your sleep as well number\nfive put some music in your house i'm\nreally big if you ever come over my\nhouse i'm really big on always playing\nmusic there's always energy and\nvibration going through my house at all\npoints in time for me and i don't know\nabout you guys like i have favorite\nsongs that just feel like they give me\nenergy and so one of the hacks that i\nfind with a lot of people\nthat make it super simple is just start\nputting on music that you like don't\neven put just background music put on\nmusic that you like throughout your\nhouse while you're driving while you're\nat work wherever you can listen to music\nif you have favorite songs start putting\nthose favorite songs on have the\nvibrations go through your house we're\nvibratory beings we're constantly\nvibrating at all points in time that's\njust what we do if you look at us we\nlook like we're solid beings but really\nwhat we are is we're just a vibrating\npiece of mass with 70 trillion cells\nthat are constantly moving and vibrating\nas well and so when you have energy and\nmovement and music going through a room\nyour body's gonna feel it your body's\ngonna hear it you're gonna start singing\nalong with it you're gonna start moving\nyour body a little bit more so a thing\nthat i recommend is to put music on\nwhenever you can have music on\nespecially if you can put on your\nfavorite music tip number six\ntry something called breath work there\nare many many different types of breath\nwork but this is something that we do\nwith our team every single morning we\nhave a team meeting every single morning\nall of all hands on on deck everybody\nthat's on our team comes in and we do\nbreath work every single morning\nguarantee the very first thing that we\ndo there's multiple different types of\nbreath work you can do i'll give you\nthree of them that i recommend we've\ndone all three of them with my team they\nenjoy all of them at different times one\nof them is called breath of fire breath\nof fire is where you breathe in\nand breathe out of your nose\nas fast as you can\nfor as long as you can and when you\ndon't think you can do it anymore you\njust keep doing it i like to put on\nmusic of course like i said and i'll do\nbreath of fire so it's\nand i'll do it sometimes you get some\nsnot flying out of your nose no big deal\nthat's just part of the process that\nwill literally start to invigorate your\nbody that's breath of fire another one\nthat we do is called wim hof so wim hof\nbut we also do something a little bit\nseparate another thing that i learned\nfrom wim hof so it's 30 deep breaths in\nbut then on the 30th breath you ready\nhere's a secret you breathe in as much\nyou possibly can\nhold at the top and then force yourself\nto do as many push-ups as you possibly\ncan\nbefore breathing again this is just\nsomething that i do this is not a\nrecommendation i don't need you guys\npassing out and then saying oh my god i\nheard this guy talk about this thing\nthis is what i do if you want to try it\nyou can try what i have found and here's\nwhat's crazy is if i want to just do\npush-ups right now i can do about 40\npush-ups in a row here's what's crazy if\ni want to do the breathing exercise and\nthen do my push-ups i can get about 60\nsometimes even more\nit without ever breathing again and the\nreason why is because i'm over\noxygenating my body which is what your\nbody needs and also your muscles need a\nlot of oxygen so i'm over oxygenating my\nbody and i'm doing these push-ups i'm\ndoing it to music and i'm pumping them\nout and i have literally a song that we\nlisten to every single morning it's\ncalled strobe by dead mouse we put it on\nwe just crank it out and we just do the\npush-up we do the breathing then we do\nthe push-ups every single time that's\nthe very first way that i start my\nmorning\nbefore i ever have any coffee any of\nthat stuff and i can literally feel my\nbody light up with energy and i feel\ncompletely different if i'm ever feeling\ndrained throughout the day i do one of\nthese as well and the third one i'm\ngoing to tell you i don't know what\nthey're called i just call them skis\nthat's what i call them because it\nliterally looks like so for those of you\nguys that are watching video for those\nof you guys that aren't watching video\nlisten on a podcast breathe in through\nyour nose breathe out through your mouth\nbreathe in through your nose breathe out\nyour mouth and when you breathe in your\nhands go above your head\nwhen you breathe out your hands go below\ndown to your waist it's best to stand up\nand it's\nand you literally use your entire body\nas if you're skiing down a mountain and\nyou're putting your your hands are going\nup you're going down your hands are\ngoing up going down when you breathe in\nyour hands go up when you breathe out\nyour your hands go down do this for two\nto three minutes straight\nwith music blaring as well you can go\nfrom no energy to holy sh i have so much\nenergy like that simply because you're\nusing the body the way that the body is\nmade to be used super simple so what was\nthat again breath of fire\nor wim hof\nor the skis\nall of them are different i use each of\nthem depending on what i'm doing try it\nout i promise you at some point in time\nyou're going to get a ton of energy from\nit\nsee if it works\nsee if it works if you're on your phone\nchilling out on the couch scrolling\nthrough instagram you're like oh my gosh\ni got to get up and do this thing but i\ndon't really feel like doing this thing\nforce your body to do breath of fire or\nto do the push-ups with the breath hold\nor to do the skis put on some music and\ni guarantee you it'll just rush energy\ninto your body tip number seven get\noutside take your shoes off put your\nfeet in the ground and go outside in the\nsun for me every single morning the very\nfirst thing that i do because we have a\npuppy he likes to pee all over the place\nso i gotta get him outside as soon as we\nwake up in the morning first thing i do\nis i put some shorts on i keep my my\nshirt off and i walk outside barefoot\nand i keep my feet in the grass as long\nas i possibly can and get as much sun on\nmy body as i possibly can and like i\ntold you i look up at the sky the blue\nin the sky and i try to get all of the\nreasons why i should be awake for my\nbody to go oh yeah this is the time when\nrob should be awake the sun is now\ncoming up he's outside his feet are on\nthe grass he's getting sun on his skin\nhe's looking at the blue inside so that\nmeans that the sky is you know obviously\nthe sun is up we should stop making\nmelatonin i'm trying to give my body all\nof the reasons why i'm supposed to be up\nright now get some sun on your skin also\nwith all of the stuff that's been\nhappening with viruses and everything\nvitamin d which is what you get from the\nsun is one of the things that kills the\nviruses the quickest according to\neverybody as the people that have a lot\nof trouble with it and tend to have\nvitamin d deficiencies and most people\nhave vitamin d deficiencies get outside\nin the sun more get as much of your skin\nto be able to\nmuch sun to be able on your skin as\npossible and i guarantee it'll help you\nnumber eight exercise in the morning it\nis a fact that the more that you\nexercise your body will start to create\nmore energy you know i look at my one of\nmy friends my friend amy when she lived\nhere she doesn't live here anymore when\nshe lived here in austin she was doing\nlike god she was doing like five four to\nfive cycling classes every single day\nand everyone was like how does she have\nso much freaking energy she has so much\nenergy not because she was just blessed\nwith energy\nshe has so much energy because she has\nliterally for years told her body this\nis what we do that's what we do that's\nwhat we do and so when she doesn't go\nand do four cycling classes she has a\nday off of course she's got so much\nenergy of course she can keep going of\ncourse she wants to party until late\nnight because her body knows it needs to\ncreate lots of energy if you've been in\na cycle of not working out not forcing\nyour body to move your body's learned\nthat\nyou can make it relearn and make it\nstart to create more energy so work out\nin the morning or at least even if it's\nnot in the morning just work out at some\npoint in time and force your body to\nlearn it needs to create more energy\nyour body is an amazing adaptive piece\nof machinery force it to adapt the way\nthat you want it to adapt last but not\nleast is to drink more water and\npreferably drink spring water like this\nif you're looking drink spring water\ndoesn't have to go through a filter it's\ncoming straight from the earth it's also\nin a plastic or not a plastic bottle in\na glass bottle you can do your own\nresearch on why plastic isn't good for\nyou and how plastic raises your estrogen\nwhether you're male or female but if it\ncomes from a glass bottle usually ends\nup being a lot better for you as well if\nit's spring water ends up being a lot\nbetter for you as well but just\nregardless just drink more water it's\nmind-blowing to me how little water\npeople drink considering that your body\nis 60 to 70 water one of the things that\nthey found is that most people when\nthey're tired the very first thing you\nshould check is actually if you're\ndehydrated because a lot of times the\nfirst thing to go down as soon as you're\ndehydrated is your energy your body runs\noff of water if you don't feel like you\nhave energy maybe you should see if you\ngot enough water drink a lot more water\nand your body will actually start to\nfilter out all the toxins in the same\ntime it'll run more efficiently today\nwe're going to be talking about the\neight things that you need to stop doing\nwhen you wake up because as we know the\nmost important part of your day is\nusually the morning and so if we can\nmake sure that our morning as as perfect\nas we possibly can it will set up the\nrest of the day so without further ado\nlet's dive into it the first thing that\nyou need to stop doing when you wake up\nin the morning is waking up at different\ntimes one of the things that your body\nwants to do is your body wants to have a\nroutine your body wants to have it wants\nto be in line with circadian cycles i'm\nnot going to go into what circadian\ncycles are that's just basically the\nnatural movement of yourself your body\nyour sleep the earth all of those things\nyour body wants a routine and this\nincludes on the weekends so there's a\nlot of people that will email in to me\nor they'll send me messages on instagram\nand they'll say rob i'm trying to have\nthis great morning routine and it's\ngoing really well for me the only\nproblem is it's it's really hard for me\nto wake up in the mornings and i'm like\nall right what time do you wake up in\nthe morning oh well i wake up at 5 00\na.m you know monday through friday\ncool what does your weekend look like\nwell you know i tend to go out with my\nfriends on the weekends and then i wake\nup at 9 00 to 9 30 10 o'clock sometimes\nlike well the main issue for you is not\nthat you're not able to wake up and to\nbe able to have your morning routines\nit's that when you go to bed at five\nwhen you go to bed later you wake up at\n5 00 a.m monday through friday but on\nsaturday and sunday you go to bed later\neven if you don't go out and party and\nget drunk but you're waking up at 9 10\na.m your body does not have a routine\nyour body wants to have a routine that\nit gets into that it follows that makes\nit easier for it so the very first thing\nthat i would say is stop waking up at\ndifferent times have a very consistent\ntime because once your body starts to\nget used to it after about two weeks\nafter about three weeks your body will\nbe in a routine\nmakes it super easy to wake up and\nwhen you get your body into a routine\neven for the people who are like oh but\ni'm a night owl no you're not\nis actually studies have found that\nnight owls don't exist it's just that\nthe routine of staying up late has been\naround for so long you think that you're\na night owl is that when you start\nforcing yourself to go to bed earlier to\nwake up later and come up with this wake\nup the exact same time your body will\nstart to wake itself up a lot of times\neven before the alarm i know every\nperson listening to this has had their\nbody wake up right before the alarm goes\noff it's because your body wants to be\nin a routine so that's the first thing\nthe second thing that i want you to stop\ndoing when you wake up in the morning is\nstop hitting the snooze right you have\nto think of it this way if you hit the\nsnooze you're automatically starting\nyour day off with a loss\nright because when you were a fully\nconscious being before you went to bed\nyou said you know what i'm going to wake\nup at 6 a.m\nand then you hear the alarm clock go off\nand i always say the best salesperson in\nthe entire world is you telling yourself\nwhy you need to sleep in that's the best\nsalesperson in the entire world we're\nall really good at sales we're just\nreally good sales people for ourselves\nwith excuses\nstop hitting the snooze button don't set\nmultiple alarms i had someone come to my\nevent last week in person and they were\nlike look these are my three alarms that\ni set for myself and the motivational\nthing that i put it's great to have a\nmotivational thing with each alarm but\nwhy do you have three alarms in the\nfirst place\nwhy don't you just wake up with the\nfirst one\nwake up with your first alarm\nit sets you off on the wrong foot when\nyou have multiple alarms that you go\nwith or when you're hitting the snooze\nbutton because your body gets all\nconfused oh am i asleep am i awake am i\nsleeping my way stop hitting the snooze\nbutton that is number two number three\nstop looking at your phone immediately\nstop looking at your phone immediately\nin fact get an alarm\nget a real old-school alarm\nand put it on the other side of the room\ndon't put it next to your bed it's a lot\neasier to not look at your phone when\nyour phone is not your alarm it's also a\nlot easier to not hit the snooze button\nwhen you don't have a snooze button\nthat's on your phone and you immediately\njust walk over to the other side of the\nroom and get that alarm and turn it off\nand put it on the other side of the room\nbecause it's easier to get up when\nyou've already gotten out of bed you\nhave to get out of bed you have to go\nget it so stop looking at your phone\nstop checking social media holy crap\nstop checking social media\nhow stressful is that to do that first\nthing in the morning that just sets you\noff down the wrong path stop checking\nyour text messages stop checking your\nemails don't look at your phone for as\nlong as you possibly can\nif you have an hour-long morning routine\nand your alarm goes off at six and at\nseven o'clock is when your morning\nroutine ends turn your phone off when\nyou go to bed and do not look at your\nphone until after you're done with your\nmorning routine stop looking at your\nphone i promise you it'll set your day\noff on such a better foot because all\ntoo often people get their emails they\nget their text messages they get their\nsocial media notifications and all of\nthis anxiety floods in because you're\nlike holy crap i've got so much to do\nand i haven't even gone to the bathroom\nyet i haven't even brushed my teeth i've\ngot so much i've got to do anxiety will\njust build up inside of you stop looking\nat your phone first thing in the morning\nokay step number four the fourth thing i\nwant you to stop doing is stop not\nmaking your bed\nstart with a win make your bed it takes\nwhat\n30 seconds to make your bed and it may\nnot seem like a big deal and i\ncompletely understand because for the\nlongest time i thought making my bed was\nthe stupidest thing because i don't do\nanything else in my room except for\nsleep i'm not one of those people who\ngoes in my room and hangs out and works\nand does phone calls or watches tv or\nthat stuff the only thing that i do in\nmy room is get dressed and sleep that's\nthe only two things that i do i sleep\nfirst and then i get dressed i don't get\ndressed and then sleep but it may not\nseem like a big deal\nbut think about this for a second if you\nwake up on your first alarm\nif you don't check your phone if you\nmake your bed you're starting with three\nwins before you even brush your teeth do\nyou know how much better that makes you\nfeel what happens is that your brain\nthen releases dopamine and if you've\nbeen listening my recent episodes i've\nbeen talking about how dopamine is the\nmotivational chemical inside of your\nbrain so your brain releases dopamine\nwith every single win which then makes\nyou feel more motivated to go actually\nget other wins throughout the day when\nyou wake up and you hit your first alarm\nand you're you're good you're up that's\nright there is a win when you don't\ncheck your phone boom that's another one\nwhen you make your bed boom that's\nanother one you have three wins before\nyou ever even brush your teeth that's\ndopamine dopamine dopamine you feel more\nmotivated to go do something you're\nstarting your day off on the right foot\ngoing and taking the action that you\nneed to to go towards the life that you\nwant to so if you want to start your\nlife off of the right foot make your bed\nget up on the first alarm\ndo whatever it is that you need to do to\nnot check your phone\nso number four is stop not making your\nbed\nstep number five\nthe thing i want you to stop doing this\nis gonna piss a lot of people off i've\ngot a couple of them coming up they're\ngonna piss you off as well stop taking\nwarm showers there are so many benefits\ni've been saying this for years when i\nfirst heard this about five years ago\nand i started doing cold showers there\nwas there were very few benefits it was\nlike there's benefits to it but there's\na whole lot of pseudoscience behind it\nthere is so much science as to the\nbenefits of cold showers just go to\ngoogle and type in benefits of cold\nshowers and there's so many studies that\nhave been done recently when you take a\ncold shower number one they suck number\ntwo they never stop sucking number three\nthey never get any easier but number\nfour\nthat has to do with that it is another\nwin because it is so hard to not listen\nto that little voice inside of your head\nthat says hey man just\njust skip the cold shower today\nno one's gonna know\nbut you hear that little voice inside of\nyour head that says don't do it that\nlittle voice is the same little voice\nthat says hey sleep in a little bit\nlonger hey don't worry about going to\nthe gym today hey eat that pizza don't\neat the salad it's that little voice\ninside of your head i like to call it\nthe little inner that's what i\ncall it it's that little inner\ncoming in and telling you not to do\nsomething and when you can conquer\nthat little voice inside of your head\nfirst thing in the morning that is your\nfourth win\nby the time you get done showering think\nabout that you have started your day off\nin full-on intentional proactive mode\nnot putting out fires not reactive i'm\nin control of my life i'm in control of\nmy day i'm gonna kick today's ass that's\nhow you're starting your day every\nsingle day if you do this right i hate\ncold showers i love the way it makes me\nfeel after them i don't like them when\ni'm in them i'm never like yay i'm in a\ncold shower yay i'm about to a cold\nshower don't enjoy them don't like them\nbut i do love the benefits of them the\nphysical benefits are great\nyou can google those i'm most interested\nin the mental benefits of doing what i\ndon't want to do because if i can make\nmyself do what i don't want to do in the\nmorning it makes it so much easier it's\nlike knocking over dominoes in the\nmorning it's just going to continue that\nmomentum throughout the day so that's\nnumber five the sixth thing i want you\nto stop doing is stop doing anything\nthat is not for yourself right away your\nmorning is your time your morning is the\ntime for you to work on yourself for you\nto improve for you to get better stop\nworking stop getting the kids ready\nnow i'm nice you can work later you can\nget the kids ready later but i'm talking\nabout getting up before all of that so\nthat you have some me time so that you\ncan work on yourself because what i find\nwith a lot of people as we tend to get\nolder as people tend to have kids is\nthat we are a lot of times the reason\nwhy people get so stressed out and have\nso much anxiety a lot of times is\nbecause they're trying to give from an\nempty cup they're just giving giving\ngiving giving giving\nand they're not receiving and what i\nmean by receiving is waking up and\nfilling your own cup that's your you\ntime\nyour time to meditate your time to read\nyour time to work out do yoga\njournal whatever it is that fills your\ncup that makes you feel good that is\nyour you time so stop doing things\nthat's not for you\nyou have to see the morning routine\nthose morning times as absolutely sacred\nthose are your you times so if the kids\nnormally wake up at seven\nwake up at six whatever it is that you\ngotta do and plan yourself to go to bed\nearlier one of the things that i love is\nis a couple years ago mark wahlberg the\nactor put out his morning routine and\neverybody was so blown away because his\nmorning routine starts at like i think\nit's like 4am actually i think it's like\n3am if i'm not mistaken it's it's i\nthink it's yeah i think it's 3am at 3am\nis when it when it uh you know his his\nmorning routine starts so he gets up at\n3am and he follows this whole morning\nroutine and everyone's like why would\nyou wake up at 3am\ni went to an event i'm part of a\nmastermind and he came and spoke at the\nmastermind and he was talking about his\nmorning routine and how he gets up so\nearly and everyone's like oh my god i\ncan never get up that early the secret\nto his morning routine is that his kids\ngo to bed at 7 30. and so when his kids\ngo to bed and they're asleep he just\ngoes to sleep right after them and so\nit's like oh my god he wakes up so early\nhe also goes to bed so early so he goes\nto bed at 8 a.m or i'm sorry 8 p.m so he\ngoes to bed at 8 pm he wakes up at 3\nthat's 7 hours of sleep that's what he\nfeels like he needs so you can wake up\nearlier if you just go to bed\nearlier so whatever it is that you want\nto create for your morning routine\nwhatever it is that you want it to look\nlike just plan ahead just be intentional\nthat's all you got to do so that is the\nsixth thing to stop doing stop doing\nanything that is not for yourself right\naway\nthat's what you need to make sure\ndon't do anything for anybody else fill\nyour cup right away\nspeaking of filling cups number seven\nis stop drinking coffee right away oh i\ntold you there's gonna be some that were\ngonna piss you guys off right stop\ndrinking coffee right away why there's a\nlot of studies that have found that you\nshould wait at least an hour before you\nhave any coffee and the reason why one\nof the main reasons why is because your\ncortisol levels which are your stress\nhormones are at their absolute highest\nthroughout the day when you wake up\ncortisol is usually what wakes people up\nand so i don't know if you've ever i\nfeel it all the time the moment that i\nwake up immediately it's like flooded\nwith stress\nfive out of seven days i get that it's\nlike i feel the stress immediately and\nit's like anxious thoughts it's\nstressful thoughts the worst thing that\nyou could do at that time is give\nyourself some freaking coffee because\nthat's just going to flood you with more\nstress and anxiety and get your cortisol\nlevels to go higher so usually what you\nshould do is you should wait about an\nhour at least before you have coffee the\nreason why it allows your stress\nhormones to go down it allows your body\nto calm down the first thing that you\nshould do is actually more than anything\nelse is drink water and not drink coffee\nbecause you usually lose at least a\nliter of water every single day when you\ngo to bed\nthroughout your sleeping you lose a\nliter of water so what do you do start\nyour day off with warm water lemon and\nsea salt you need to hydrate more than\nanything else because if you wake up\nthink about this if you hide if you\ndon't hydrate you wake up\nyour stress levels are at the highest\nthat they're ever going to be throughout\nthe day and you add caffeine to that and\nat the same time you're drinking coffee\nwhich is\nyou know dehydrating you\nyou're basically starting off really in\na really bad position but when you wake\nup you drink a whole lot of water with\nlemon and sea salt in it\nit allows your body to take all of that\nto rehydrate itself and then about an\nhour later after your cortisol levels\ndrop it allows your body to then be able\nto have the caffeine there's a lot of\nstudies that show you can google it if\nyou want to that if you wait an hour the\ncaffeine actually is much more helps you\nbe much more productive if you have\ncaffeine an hour after you wake up\nversus immediately after you wake up so\nthe seventh thing to stop doing when you\nwake up in the morning sorry everybody\nstop drinking coffee\nright away you can drink it later and\nnumber eight stop eating stop eating as\nsoon as you wake up in the morning try\nsomething called intermittent fasting uh\nwhy is that you guys probably know\nthere's a million studies that be coming\nout with that but if you go back and\nlisten to my podcast i had dr david\nsinclair on my podcast he is the head of\nharvard's anti-aging and uh he says eat\none less meal per day and so there's so\nmany benefits of skipping a meal and\nsince you've already fasted for eight\nhours seven eight hours because you were\nasleep for seven to eight hours and if\nyou don't eat for an hour or two hours\nbefore you go to bed you're fasting\nyou're about on a 10 hour fast just skip\nyour breakfast\nand then you can go and you can have\nyour lunch there's so many studies on\nhow intermittent fasting helps you live\nlonger helps you be healthier helps you\nobviously reduce your caloric intake and\nhe said one of the secrets if you just\nwant to live longer\njust skip a meal every single day and\nthe easiest one to skip is breakfast and\nwhat happens is if you start to read\nsome articles and start to watch some\nyoutube videos on fasting is it it takes\nabout three days for your body to get\nused to this so if you've been eating\nbreakfast immediately when you wake up\nor your body's used to it you will feel\nthe first three days\nreally really hungry but that's the\nreason the reason why is because your\nbody releases something called i think\nit's called gremin\nit sounds like gremlin whatever it is uh\nand it releases this and that is the\nhunger\nuh hormone that's released in the\nchemical that's released that tells your\nbody when to eat after about three days\nof not eating at the same time so you\ndecided like say you decide to skip\nbreakfast day four you're not really\ngoing to want your breakfast anymore\nyou're not really going to be that\nhungry so i recommend\ntry it out skip it if you want to learn\nmore about intermittent fasting and how\nit helps you live longer how it helps\nyou be healthier you can go back to my\npodcast episode with dr david sinclair\nand you can learn about it hey thanks so\nmuch for watching this video if you want\nto learn even more about master your\nmind click right here and watch this\nvideo so if you're at a job that you\nhate\nit is a complete\nabsolute waste of your life we get the\nfeeling of this isn't what i want\nbut am i too far down the road to turn\nback now people want it i understand it\nbut most people are not willing to step\nout into the unknown into what seems\nillogical\nto follow their heart"
