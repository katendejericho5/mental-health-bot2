    "transcript": "in order to succeed you're gonna have to\nfail a lot of times along the way just\ndon't let it stop you do we do the\nthings are we currently doing things in\nour life that are moving the needle\ntowards the life that we want to create\nbecause if i'm being honest with you i\nthink that goals are actually overrated\ni'm a very big believer in you don't\nhave to reinvent the wheel if someone\nelse has done it you can do it as well\nand the first time that this was brought\nto my attention it was when i was\nyounger and i read a book\ncalled think and grow rich and in think\nof girl rich i read it and realized that\nit doesn't matter what i was born with\nwhat my circumstances were what my\ncircumstances are\nwhat matters is that i put the right\npieces in place to create my life and if\ni do i will eventually get what i want\nand so when i look at people who are\nsuccessful and success\nis a very relative word it can mean\nsomething different for you that does\nfor me it could mean for you joy or\npeace or happiness or a great family or\ncars and traveling and clothes and\nfreedom or whatever it might be it's\ndifferent for everybody but when i look\nat every single thing in life i realize\nthat every single thing in life has\nsteps to be successful and so when i say\nsuccess\nit can mean a lot of different things\nfor a lot of different people but i'm to\ngo through the eight different things\nthat i've seen from people who have had\nsuccess in their life that i would see\nand i deem success is to have ultimate\nfreedom freedom to do what you want when\nyou want with who you want and so when i\nsay eight things that people do who are\nsuccessful that unsuccessful people\ndon't\nmy version of success is the ability to\ndo whatever you want whenever you want\nwith whoever you want at any point in\ntime anywhere in the world all of that\nso let's dive into it the first thing\nthat i find with a lot of successful\npeople not every single one of them but\nlike 80 to 85 90 of them is they have\nsome sort of\nconsistent waking up early and having\nsome sort of a morning routine so when i\nwas doing research on this i was like\nlet me just see\nwhat time successful people wake up and\nso i found people like richard branson\nwho's a multi-billionaire wakes up at 4\n30 every single morning tim cook who's a\nmulti-billionaire wakes up at 4 30 every\nsingle morning howard schultz who is the\nguy who started as a ceo of starbucks\nwakes up at five o'clock every single\nmorning so i'm not saying that you\nhave to wake up at those times\nbut the reason why they wake up at those\ntimes is because they have time for\nthemself whether it's to read whether\nit's to journal whether it's to work out\nthey have time for themselves to be\nintentional to grow into who they want\nto be so they have some sort of a\nroutine to growing themselves into who\nthey want to be and they do this before\nthey go into work and they have\nthousands of people that could report to\nthem they literally just work on\nthemselves first and so they wake up\nearly and the thing that that's\ninteresting is a lot of people are like\nyou know what like i don't i don't know\nif i can wake up early i'm it's hard for\nme to wake up early i'm more of a night\nowl\nand what i found is that if you want to\nwake up early you can wake up early you\njust have to start to reset your\ncircadian cycles which are now used to\ngoing to bed late if you are a late\nsleeper if you go in you go to bed late\nand then sleep in late you've just set\nyour cycles that way they can also be\nreset and so if you sit there and you\nspend\nan hour watching netflix every single\nnight imagine if you just were able to\ncut that out and wake up at least an\nhour earlier and spent that hour on\nyourself instead of watching netflix or\ninstead of watching youtube or instead\nof watching sports if you cut that hour\nout at night went to bed an hour earlier\nwoke up an hour earlier and spent some\ntime on yourself what would that look\nlike for you so ask yourself the\nquestion do you feel that you wake up\nearly enough right now to have time\nspecifically dedicated to you and your\nown growth if the answer is no i would\nrecommend building that into your life\nso that's the first thing the second\nthing that i found that's really\ninteresting is that they read almost\nevery single day there's an article that\ncame out a few years ago it says the\naverage ceo reads about 60 books per\nyear\n60 books per year which means the\naverage ceo which is at the highest of\ntheir company the highest of their\nindustry\nreads 60 books per year that is more\nthan one book per week so then you got\nto think to yourself how many books am i\nreading how much am i going out and\ntrying to learn how much am i going out\nand trying to grow myself and try to\nlearn from some of the most successful\npeople that have ever existed the\nbeautiful thing about life is that\neverything that you want to learn about\nany industry about self-development\nabout mastering yourself about religion\nspirituality all those things\nall of the books have already been\nwritten that you could want to read from\nsome of the smartest people that have\never lived why don't you just start\nreading those books\nand so ask yourself how often do you\nread and if you were to put yourself as\na as a goal how many books do you want\nto read every single month figure out\nthat number write it down and start to\nfollow it the third thing that they do\nis they exercise consistently\nthey understand that there's a mind-body\nconnection if your body is not in the\nright place there's a pretty good chance\nyour mind is not going to be in the\nright place your mind and your body have\na constant communication at all points\nin time you know a good example of this\nis you know if you eat something really\nheavy in the middle of the day do you\nget real tired after lunch do you have\nthat you know that 2 30 feeling where\nyou're like oh man now i'm really tired\ni need to get some coffee maybe it's not\nthat you just are naturally feeling that\nway maybe it's that you're eating\nsomething that is making you feel that\nway and so when i say they exercise\nconsistently is because they understand\nthat when you exercise in the morning\nconsistently or in the\nevening consistently whatever it is your\nbody will start to\ncreate more energy throughout the day\nand the more energy that you have\nthroughout the day the more energy that\nyou have to go and accomplish your goals\nwhatever your goals are and so one of\nthe things they do very consistently is\nwork out all of the time\nevery single day four times a week five\ntimes a week\ndo some movement practice they don't\nstay\nstill very often so the third thing is\nthey exercise consistently the fourth\nthing is write their goals down\nconsistently as well i've told you this\nstory before if you've heard it but in\nthe 70s\nharvard did a study on people that were\ngraduating from harvard with an mba of\nthis graduating class only three percent\nof them actually wrote down their goals\nand then 10 years later in the 1980s\nthey followed up with all of those\npeople and they found out that the 3\npercent that wrote down their goals with\npen and paper were ten times more\nsuccessful than all of the under other\nninety seven percent combined so three\npercent of people who wrote down their\ngoals were ten times more successful\nthan the other ninety 97\ncombined\nwhy is that well because it becomes real\nwhen you write it down with pen and\npaper you put it down it becomes\nphysical in this world it becomes\nsomething that you can see and something\nthat you can work through and a lot of\ntimes people will set goals and then\nthey'll never write their goals down and\nthey'll never work and they'll never\nwork through their goals to figure out\nhow to get to those goals\nwhich is usually the biggest detriment\nto why people don't hit their goals but\nthe example i would like to give is like\nif i if i gave you a multiplication\nproblem and said hey what is uh 127\ntimes 43 majority of people listening\nright now would not be able to do that\noff the top of your head but if i gave\nyou pen and paper and said the exact\nsame number what's one four one what did\ni say 147 times 127 times 43 you could\nfigure it out by doing multiplication\nthat you learned in what fourth grade\nthird grade and so when you can take\nsomething out of your head and put it on\na piece of paper and see it and start to\nwork through it takes things that seem\nvery complex and make a much more simple\nto work through and so when you write\nyour goals down consistently every day\nand work through them just the same way\nthat if you were to build a business\nplan you're not going to try to do a\nbusiness plan your head you're going to\nwrite it all down why would you make it\nany different than getting your goals\nfrom your head physical on a piece of\npaper and actually start working through\nthem so that you can get more clear on\nexactly what it is that you want so that\nyou can get a date of exactly the dates\nyou're going to hit it by and so when\nyou deal with number four and you talk\nabout writing your goals down ask\nyourself how often do you write your\ngoals down and if it's not often maybe\nyou should just develop the practice of\nwriting your goals down every single day\nof working through them every single day\nmaking it part of your journaling\npractice that's the fourth thing they do\nthe fifth thing that they do is that\nthey have mentors i read an article\nyears ago that said the average person\nwho becomes a millionaire has an average\nof seven mentors before they become a\nmillionaire in some sort of way and so\nif you're out there and you're looking\naround and you're like i don't have any\nmentors or i need some more mentors i\nhave one mentor how can you start going\nout and finding more mentors the reason\nwhy this is important is because they\ncan shorten your learning curve\nfrom you know their 20 years of\nknowledge\nto\ntwo years for you so they can literally\ncollapse time this is the importance of\nhiring a coach sometimes hiring a mentor\nis that someone who's further along in\nthe process than you are that's already\ndone what you want to do and already you\nmade the mistakes that you will\neventually make if you were to just\nlearn from them you can shorten your\nlearning curve not have to go through\ntheir mistakes and then also at the same\ntime see exactly what it is that you\nneed to do in order to get where you\nwant to go i have a friend that i've\nrecently become\nfriends with and she runs a business\nthat's in the same industry as me but\nhers does 50 million dollars a year\nmine is at five and so i'm looking at\nthat going holy sh\nshe's light years ahead of me\nwhat does she know that i don't know how\ncould i provide value to her based off\nof what i know in my business and then\nhow can i get value from her based on\nwhat she's doing in her business so that\nwe can make this something that we work\non together and if you're out there and\nyou're like well i don't have a\nsuccessful company what am i going to\noffer these people that are\nsuccessful well there's a lot that you\ncan offer and that's the thing is that\nmost people think that oh yeah\ni'm not a millionaire what would i what\nvalue could i possibly give a\nmillionaire i'm not someone who's\nsuccessful what could i possibly give\nsomebody who's successful one of the\nthings that i found is that once people\nhave hit their goals they checked all\ntheir box they've made all the money\nthey've done the traveling one of the\nthings that lights them up the most is\nhelping somebody else succeed it's\npassing it passing it along paying it\nforward for people who are in the same\nsituation so don't think that you don't\nhave any value to give your mentors\nbecause once you start getting mentors\nyou'll find\nwhat it is like to be able to help\nsomebody that's further along the\nprocess than you and also be helped by\nsomeone that's further along in the\nprocess in you you know there's two\ndifferent types of mentors that i always\ntalk about number one is paid and number\ntwo is free and you can figure out i\nthink there's value to both of them\nright so i have a lot of friends that\nare that are great mentors of mine that\ni don't pay them anything and we\nbrainstorm and i help them they help me\nand they're free mentors but they don't\nfeel obligated for me to succeed you\nknow they want me to succeed but there's\nno obligation on their side to have me\nsucceed\nbut i also have paid mentors that i pay\nand when you pay somebody there is more\nof a feeling of obligation and also more\nof a consistent meeting up process like\nwith my mentors that i pay we meet every\nsingle week so if you have a mentor or\nif you have a coach that you hire we\nmeet every single week so it's\nconsistent every seven days we're\ntalking we're working through things\neverything seven days we're talking\nwe're working through things and they\nsee it as their obligation to help me\nsucceed because i am paying them a good\namount of money to be able to do so and\nso that's the difference between a paid\nmentor and a free mentor i find value in\nboth of them so that's number five\nnumber six is positive self-talk and you\nknow we're not born\njust\nsuper positive people well actually let\nme reverse that we're born positive\npeople then the world kind of destroys\nit out of us and we have to go and\nrefine that positivity and so\nyou're not going to wake up every single\nday and just be\nsuper excited to go and take on the day\nbut how can you start talking to\nyourself in a way that motivates you to\nstart moving forward and taking more\naction how can you start talking\nyourself and building yourself up you\nknow it's it's a lot it's it's hard\nenough to succeed in this world it's\neven harder when you have someone\ntalking in your ear the entire time and\nthat's what a lot of people are doing is\nconstantly talking to themselves and so\nhow can you build up\na\na system of positive self-talk to be\nmore intentional with all of the talk\nthat you do inside of your own head you\nknow i uh i gave this example a few\nyears ago i made a video where i had a\nbig bucket of water\nand just clear glass that it was in and\nthere was a bunch of dirt that we put\ninto it and if you put another bucket of\nif you put you know a cup of clear water\ninside a bucket of dirt it doesn't\nchange it much if you put another cup of\nclear water inside a bucket of dirt with\nwater it doesn't change much but if you\ntake a garden hose and you put that\ngarden hose and it's constantly flowing\nand constantly flowing eventually the\ngarden hose is going to move the water\nso much that it eventually moves all of\nthe dirt out that dirt is equivalent to\nall the negative thoughts that are\ninside of your head and so when you look\nat it you go it's not about like\nthinking positive sometimes or having a\ncouple positive thoughts it's like how\ncan i freaking brainwash myself to be\npositive all day every single day like\nit's intentional it's all day it's all\nday it's all day it's all day when i\nnotice myself slipping and saying\nsomething negative myself i pull myself\nback so you gotta ask yourself what part\nof your self-talk needs improving\nthat's number six number seven is they\ndon't worry about failure failure does\nnot exist in the mind of a successful\nperson failure does not exist until\nyou've completely given up on something\nand that goes into number eight which\ni'll talk about in just a minute\nbut when they look at quote unquote\nfailures as most people would call them\nthey don't see them as failures they\njust see it as falling oh i messed up\nand a person that's successful they\nfailed more times than the average\nperson has succeeded and failed together\nlike it's just like they have they fail\nand they fail and they film and the\ncreator of honda says that success is\njust 99 failure so a person that's\nsuccessful looks at failure and what a\nnormal person sees failure and just sees\nit as ah it's just you know the universe\nshowing me this is in the right path\ngotta move i gotta change i gotta take a\ndetour the destination does not change\nthe route just might change a little bit\nthere might be a little bit of a detour\nto get to where i want to go and so they\ndon't worry about failure they don't\nthink about the missed shots they think\nabout how they're going to make the next\nshots you know if it's like the quote\nwith michael jordan where he says you\nknow i've\nfailed so many times i've missed\nthousands and thousands of shots i've\nhad the game on the line and i've missed\nthe shots during the game on the line\nand i failed over and over and over\nagain but that is why i succeed so how\ncan you realize that in order to succeed\nyou're gonna have to fail a lot of times\nalong the way just don't let it stop you\nwhich then\ngoes into number eight which is they\njust don't stop\nthey just don't stop they decide what it\nis they want and they decide that\nthey're either gonna get there they're\ngoing to die trying you know if you want\nto know the secret to success is just\noutlast everyone in your industry\nbecause most people are going to give up\nalong the way\nthe majority of your competitors are\ngoing to give up\ni guarantee you that so if you just\ndon't stop you'll eventually acquire the\nskills you'll eventually acquire the\nknowledge and you'll eventually acquire\nwhatever it is that you need to be more\nsuccessful than everybody else is out\nthere and so if you make the the\ndecision in your head\nit doesn't matter what happens it\ndoesn't matter how many times i fall it\ndoesn't matter how many times i talk\nnegative myself it doesn't matter how\nmany times i mess up it doesn't matter\nbecause i'm going to continue to improve\nand continue to get better and i'm not\ngoing to stop\neventually you will be successful that's\njust the way that it goes when you look\nat the list of people who have failed\nlike massive successes in this world but\nthey failed over and over and over and\nover and over again if you look at the\nlist of abraham lincoln how many times\nhe failed and all the crap that he went\nthrough in his life and then he became\npresident of the united states\nyou know you start to realize oh man a\nlot of very successful people end up\nfailing tons of times along the way the\nonly difference is they don't allow\ntheir failures to get in the way of the\nsuccess that's about to come they don't\nlet their failure stop them from going\non the path that they're on the\ndestination stays the same they just\ncontinue to make different detours so\nyou gotta ask yourself\nand this is a question i want you to\nthink of\nhow different would your life be if you\njust didn't stop\nif you know if you if you didn't give up\non that thing that you gave up on years\nago how different would your life be\nright now\nthink about that we're going to talk\nabout clearing out all of the bs all the\nstuff that's holding you back that\ndoesn't make sense in prioritizing your\nmission prioritizing your purpose\nprioritizing your passion whatever it is\nthat you're trying to do and i'm going\nto talk to you about how to\nmake your success a little bit easier\nand i'll say this before we dive in\nwe're all busy i mean if you're\nlistening to me right now have you ever\nused the phrase i'm too busy i'm so busy\nright now have you said that in the last\nweek you said in last month oh i'm just\nso busy i've said it a bunch of times\nand we all have things going on you know\nthere's work there's kids there's bills\nthere's cleaning the house there's doing\nchores there's laundry you've got to mow\nthe lawn you've got to do your clothes\nyou've got to iron you got to put them\nback on them put them away in the\ndresser you've got to hang them up\nyou've got to we have so many as humans\nwe do so many things we gotta eat we\ngotta go to the bathroom we gotta drink\nwater we've gotta put stuff inside the\nrefrigerator like we've got so many\nthings so many different actions that we\ndo as humans\nand with that\nwe all have so many excuses that we\ncould give as to why we are so busy and\nwe have too many things going on to\ncreate the life that we want to we have\nall of the excuses\nbut you have to think about this\nwe do a lot of things but the question\nis do we do the right things do we do\nthe things are we currently doing things\nin our life that are moving the needle\ntowards the life that we want to create\nthink about that for a second are you\ntaking action\nor are you taking action towards the\ndesired outcome that you want in your\nlife are you doing the needle moving\nactivities to change your life because\nif you're not your life is going to be\nexactly the same\n365 days from today as it is right now\nunless you're doing needle moving\nactivities you could still keep doing\nthe laundry and i'm not saying don't do\nthe laundry and you can start keep doing\nall the things that you need to and get\nthose things done but it's not\nneedle-moving activities there'll always\nbe\nthings that you have to do\nyou have to sleep you know you have to\nbrush your teeth you have to do those\nthings you have to do them but are you\nprioritizing\nthe things that you need to get done\nover everything else let me examine what\ni mean because\nall of us are different and we all have\ndifferent things that we need to do and\nthat's what we're going to dive into\ntoday is this conversation came up in a\ncoaching group that i run\ni teach coaches how to grow coaching\nbusinesses i teach literally coaches how\nto grow online coaching businesses it's\ncalled business breakthrough and\nsomebody asked a question a couple weeks\nago and we were talking about this\nwhere she was saying as i'm trying to\nbuild my business i'm running out of\ntime like i'm trying to do this i'm\ntrying to run run i'm trying to build\nthis but i'm running out of time and i\nhad another friend that was saying hey\ni'm trying to lose weight\nand i'm just trying to get in the shape\nthat i want to but i just don't have\nenough time once i get done with work\nand i heard this a couple times and i\nwas like huh this is an interesting\nthing that people say i should probably\ntalk about this\nso i was in this conversation with my\nfriend who's trying to lose weight\nand they were saying i don't have time i\ntry to get as much i try to work out as\nmuch as possible but i just run out of\ntime so many days and i was like that's\ninteresting and i said i said to her i\nsaid um\njust just kind of curious um\nyou know you have children you know\nthey're seven and five\num how many days have you run out of\ntime and not fed them and she's like\nwhat i was like how many how many times\nyou know let's take your seven-year-old\nfor instance over the course of the\nseven years that he's been alive what is\nthat uh\njust two twenty twenty three hundred\ndays something around there twenty two\nhundred twenty three hundred days how\nmany days have you been so busy that you\nyou're like i ran out of time i didn't i\ndidn't feed my son\nshe's like um\nnone\ni was like really\nthat's interesting there's never one day\nwhere you're like i'm too busy i can't\nfeed my son and she's like no that'd be\nridiculous and i was like oh\nso what you're telling me\nis that\nfeeding your son is a priority for you\nshe's like absolutely i said you will\nonly succeed at losing weight when you\nput losing weight and working out and\neating healthy as a priority for you i'm\nnot saying that that going to the gym is\nas important as feeding your son but\nwhat i'm saying is in your brain it\nneeds to be as important you would never\ngo to sleep with your son not being fed\nyou should never go to sleep without the\nworkout if that's what you said you were\ngoing to do you don't run out of time\nyou just don't plan your time\nefficiently to make sure that the action\nis taken to create the body that you\nwant to create the life that you want to\ncreate the business that you want so the\nproblem is it's not that you don't have\ntime for the action is that you're\nmaking up excuses as to why you're too\nbusy to actually take that action\nshe was like oh\nthat makes so much sense\nworking out hasn't been a priority for\nme\nand i was like i know there are some\npeople that working out is a priority\nand they do have two kids exactly like\nyou do\nwhat's the difference their mindset\naround the priorities i'm not saying\ndon't feed your kids that's the exact\nopposite of what i'm saying\ni'm not saying don't do the laundry i'm\nnot saying don't clean the house i'm not\nsaying don't run your business i'm not\nsaying any of those things\nwhat i'm saying is is that the most\nimportant actions the needle-moving\nactions in your life need to be as much\nof a priority as feeding your children\nfeed your children of course but also\nget your ass to the gym\nfeed your children of course if you\ndon't have children you have a dog you\nhave a cat you have a bird feed your\nanimal or feed your child whatever you\nmight have\nand go to the gym\nbuild your business and feed your child\ndo all of those things\ndon't go to bed until the action is done\nsame way that you never go to bed and\nnot feed your children is exactly the\nsame way that you should never go to bed\nand not have that action done and so i\nasked her that question\nand the reason why it was it's a it's\nsuper super important to think this is\nbecause the reason why you need to have\nthis reprioritization in your mind\nis because of the fact that if you don't\nyou're not going to do what needs to be\ndone but it needs to be that that\nimportant for you so we could all make\nto-do lists right now that could be 75\nthings long\nbut are those things going to be all\nneeded moving activities in your life\nabsolutely not so how can we look at the\nthings that we know are needle moving\nand prioritize those over everything\nelse and it's very simple you plan the\nlife that you want you figure out what\nactions need to be taken and then you\nprioritize those actions over everything\nelse you don't go to bed until they're\ndone that's how committed you need to be\nto your goals i do not go to bed until x\nis done i don't go to bed until my\nworkout is done i don't go to bed until\ni make\na hundred cold calls i don't go to bed\nuntil i have\nyou know\neating the food that i need to i don't\ngo to bed if if i uh i don't go to bed\nif i haven't told my spouse i love them\nwhatever it is you're trying i don't go\nto bed unless i've meditated for the day\nwhatever it is that you're trying to\ncreate you need to prioritize those\ngoals and they need to be that important\nto you and you don't go to bed until\nthey're done and it comes down to this\nsimple phrase if it's important to you\nyou'll find a way\nif it's not you'll find an excuse\nhow many people\nwe've seen movies on it how many people\nhave run out of money they've been on\nthe streets they haven't had whatever it\nis that they need\nbut they've done what needs to be done\nin order to feed their children maybe\nthey steal\nmaybe they borrow some stuff maybe they\nfigure out a way to make money because\nthey need to pay their kids if it's they\nneed to continue to feed their kids if\nit's important to you you'll find a way\nif it's not you'll find an excuse you'll\nnever run out of time to feed your\nchildren it's a priority it gets done\nno matter what and that's the mindset\nthat you have around it as a parent i'm\ngoing to feed them i'm going to take\ncare of them what is supposed to be done\nwill be done that's what your life is\nbuilt off of well can it also be built\noff of that can can the the things that\nare most important that move them needle\nalso be built the same way in your mind\nand so i want to ask you this question\nlet's take the next three months of your\nlife let's think about the most\nimportant activity over the next three\nmonths in your life\ndo you prioritize it just ask yourself\nand let's be honest\ndo you prioritize it is it a priority\nfor you how many times have you tried\nthat thing and given up let's say weight\nloss this thing how many times you tried\nlosing weight but you've given up how\nmany times have you tried losing weight\nyou've given them how many diets have\nyou tried but then you gave up how many\ntimes you said today's this is the year\nthis is my year to get in shape my news\nare delicious i'm going to lose weight\nand then you've freaking given up on it\nthink about that for a second\nwhat do you do on a daily basis though\nthat's not a priority and so here's what\nwe're going to do we're going to figure\nout number one what is your priority\nwrite that down with pen and paper if\nyou have your pen and paper what is your\npriority over the next three months that\nis a needle-moving activity i don't need\nyou to figure out a hundred different\nthings i just need to figure out one for\nright now what is that one thing that is\na needle-moving activity for you\nwrite it down with pen and paper now i\nwant you to think about all of the\nthings that you do on a daily basis that\nare not priorities for you\nthink about it doing the laundry\nyou know\nmaybe it's uh doing the dishes watching\ntv scrolling on instagram think of every\nsingle action that you take that is not\na priority for you and then ask yourself\na couple questions are there any of\nthese things that could be outsourced\nlike is it possible that these things\ncan be outsourced like for instance i\nhave a lawn i don't mow my lawn i did at\none point mow my lawn but i stopped why\nbecause it takes a couple hours a couple\ntimes it takes a couple hours over the\ncourse of a month i could use those\nhours doing something to that is the\npriority for me\nnow some of you are like yeah but i\ndon't have the money to pay for someone\nto mow my lawn okay\nwell is there anything else that could\nbe outsourced and if you were to\noutsource mowing your lawn and use those\nlet's call it four hours over the course\nof a month\ncould you make more than that for out\nthat more than the money that you pay\nthe person\nto be able to actually pay them so that\nyou can go and do the thing that is the\npriority for you is there stuff that\ncould be outsourced you know if we're\ntalking about cleaning the house is it\npossible for you to have someone clean\nonce a month that would at least help\nhave them come every couple weeks is\nthere a way to outsource some of the\nthings that are not a priority for you\nthat's what i want to do so you're going\nto make a list of all the things that\nyou do on a daily basis and add to this\nlist throughout the day as you do things\noh i do this oh i do this oh i do this\noh i do this that are all the things\nthat are not a priority and start to ask\nyourself is it possible for me to\noutsource these is it possible that you\ncan ask someone that you live with to\nhelp with these things you know maybe\nmaybe it's the moment you live with\nmaybe you can assign one of your\nchildren to do the laundry for the month\nmaybe just have one of your children to\ndo the dishes for the month is it\npossible for you to assign somebody that\nyou live with some of these tasks what\nabout work is it possible for you to\nassign somebody that you work with to do\nsome of the tasks that you're doing that\nyou don't need to do that are not a\npriority for you i know people when they\nget promoted\nsome people will completely change the\nthings they do some people will do do\nthe job that they don't need to be doing\nbecause they don't trust other people to\ndo it so\nif you're at work and you're doing\nthings that are not a priority for you\nto move the needle can you outsource\nthat someone else is there someone else\nthat can help you and then when you look\nat the list of things what are those\nthings that you actually need to stop\ndoing right so if you're like oh i don't\nhave enough time but then you're\nwatching netflix for an hour every\nsingle night\nwhere did that freaking time come from\nto say that you don't have time\nbut you have a netflix subscription then\nyou watch it that's bullsh you're lying\nto yourself you can keep lying to\nyourself if you want but\nthe numbers don't lie and if the the\nsuccess in your business or your on the\nscale or whatever it is they don't lie\nand so could you prioritize your life\ndifferently and say oh you know what\nyeah maybe over the next three months i\nwon't watch any netflix i'll prioritize\nthis one thing and just go for this one\nthing what would your life look like if\nyou decided to switch some things around\nand actually start doing that and then\nyou start asking yourself am i being\nbusy or am i being productive so this is\nimportant to think about we're busy all\nday long we all are because we're all\ndoing something even if we're doing\nnothing we're still doing something even\nif we're just sitting around watching\nnetflix we're still watching netflix\neven if we're just sitting on the couch\nscrolling on instagram we're still on\ninstagram we're still doing something\neven more doing nothing even if we're\njust staring at the ceiling and\nbreathing we're still just breathing\nright we're doing something always we're\nall so busy but the question is are you\nbusy\nor are you productive\nhave you ever had a day\nwhere you're just you're like a chicken\nwith your head cut off you're doing\nthings you're doing things you're doing\nthings you're doing things and then you\nget home or you lay your head down and\nyou're like man i was busy all day and i\nfeel like i got nothing done have you\never had one of those days before well\nyou're just so damn busy but for some\nreason you feel like you got nothing\ndone well do you wanna know why that is\nbecause you were busy you weren't\nproductive and so if you feel like\nyou're busy all day you're not moving\nthe needle it's because you're not\nworking on the things that are gonna\nthat are priorities for you should be\npriorities for you\nthey're going to move the needle and so\nsimple tip if you've been listening for\nlong enough that'll just help you\nconquer this real quickly it's the\nsimplest thing i tell people all the\ntime and when they actually start using\nit they're like this is so simple and it\nalso helps so much you make your to-do\nlist every single morning\nyou go through and you look at it you\nsay okay\nwhat is number one what is number two\nand what is number three that are the\nnumber one number two number three most\nneedle-moving activities that i put down\non this list you circle them okay that's\nnumber one okay that's number two okay\nthat's number three and then what you do\nis you take a three by five card\nyou write down number one you write down\nnumber two you write number three and\nyou put in your back pocket and you\ndon't go to bed\nuntil all three of those things are done\nthat's it it's that simple\nand that is how you have a productive\ndays because when you feel like you're\nbusy\nbut not productive it's because you're\nnot checking off the boxes of things\nthat are important you're just checking\noff your excuse me you're just checking\noff your to-do list and that's not going\nto do anything for you just checking off\nto-do lists and i know so many people\nbecause i say this all the time and\npeople always laugh so many people out\nthere\nyou made your to-do list in the morning\nyou wrote it all down you're like cool\noh my god i got my to-do list i've got\n32 things in my to-do list\nand then you go and do something that's\nnot on your to-do list and you come back\nto your to-do list and you write that\nthing down on your to-do list and then\nyou cross it off so you get that feeling\nof hey i did it\nthat thing was probably not a priority\nfor you it's probably not the needle\nmoving activity that you needed to take\nso when you create your to-do list every\nsingle morning and then you figure out\nnumber one number two number three and\nyou put them on a three by five card you\nsay i do not go to bed until this is\ndone i'm going to focus on these three\nthings and those are the three things\nthat are going to move the business the\nmy relationship my family my body\nwhatever it is you're trying to work\ntowards these are the three needle\nmoving activities that i need to get\ndone today and you don't do anything\nuntil number one is done\nthen you don't do anything until number\ntwo is done and then you don't do\nanything until number three is done and\nthen my question to you is do you take\nthose things and you put them into your\nschedule do you stick to a schedule in\nthe first place or you just kind of run\naround the chicken with like a chicken\nwith your head cut off these are not\nlike hey if i get time for it kind of\nthings like i was telling you about my\nfriend who's trying to lose weight if i\nget time for it i'll work out if it's\nsomething that's i get if i get time for\nit it's not a priority for you and you\ndon't really care you don't think to\nyourself\nyou know well i will feed jonathan if i\nget time to no it's like it's going to\nbe done\nso your priorities should never be a if\ni get time for it kind of thing your\npriorities are i don't care what happens\ni'm going to get it done today and if\nyou do that those are the ways that\nyou're going to move the needles the\nquickest in your life and your business\nand your body and your relationships and\nyour finances and your wealth everything\nis that you figure out what the most\nimportant things are and you crush them\nevery single day no matter what and they\nare just as high as a priority for you\nas everything else is in your life but\ni'm going to tell you what i think is\nactually not what i think what i\nactually know is more important than\nyour goals to hitting your goals so\nthere's something that's in there your\ngoals are important i don't want you to\nact like they're not important that\nthey're stupid but they are the least\nimportant part\nof achieving your goals so the least\nimportant part of achieving your goals\nis knowing what your goals are so if\nyou've been listening to my podcast long\nenough i always say the most important\nthing number one for anything else\nyou've got to be really really really\nclear on exactly what your goals are the\nmore clarity that you can have around\nyour goals the more likely you are to\nhit it but i'm going to give you a\nfour-step process to making sure that\nyou get your goals accomplished and\nknowing your goals is the first thing\nobviously but it's not the most\nimportant thing because if i'm being\nhonest with you i think that goals are\nactually overrated and not only are they\noverrated i think that a lot of times\nfor people goals are actually\ndemotivating because they think of where\nthey currently are and then they look at\ntheir goals that they have for five or\nten years in the future and the money\nthat they want in the house and the\nhappiness and the family and success and\neverything that they want and it's so it\nseems so far away that it's like\nwhy would i even do it like it's so far\naway i probably won't even get there and\nthen they don't even take any action\ntowards that goal goals can be overrated\nand today i'm going to teach you what's\nmore important than them i'm going to\nwalk you through the process of exactly\nhow to hit your goals by not making them\nthe most important thing so step number\none\nis you've got to decide what you want\nright you've got to get very clear on\nwhat your goals are the more that you\ncan see the goal the more you can\nunderstand what the goal is the more\nlikely you are to hit it simply because\nyou know exactly what it is that you're\nshooting for if you've been listening my\npodcast long enough you've heard me say\nthis many times if i were to take you\nand the number one archer in the world\nput you up next to each other and have\nyou both shoot at a target he's going to\nbeat you every single time but if i take\nhim i blindfold him and spin him around\nand he has no idea what direction he's\nshooting in you have a better chance of\nhitting that target simply because you\ncan see it not because you're skilled\nnot because you're better but simply\nbecause you can see it so a lot of\npeople\ndon't hit their goals simply because\nthey don't even know what their goals\nare they're very abstract they never put\nthem down on paper and back in the 70s\nthere was a study that was done for\ngraduating mbas of harvard and they\nfound out that only three percent of\nthose people graduating from harvard\nactually wrote their goals down they\nfollowed up with all of them 10 years\nlater in the three percent were 10 times\nmore successful than the 97 percent who\ndidn't write their goals down so simply\nwriting them down is an important piece\nof the process so the first thing you\nneed to do is you need to decide what it\nis that you want get very clear on them\nthe second thing that you need to do is\nyou need to make a plan okay now that\nwe've decided what it is that we want\nnow we've got to make a plan to get\nthere for some people this can be really\nhard because once again they still feel\ntoo detached from their goals and their\ngoals don't necessarily feel real it's\nlike yeah it's what i want it's a dream\nbut i don't know how to come up with the\nplan to hit that because it just seems\nso far away and so i've got a secret for\nyou i call it future pacing and so what\nfuture pacing is is let's say\nyou know in 10 years i want to be worth\n10 million dollars right you could use\nthis for any goal that you want to i'm\ngoing to future pace and i'm going to\nsay okay it is\naugust\n2031 and i have 10 million dollars in my\nbank account\nthis is how i got there\nthis is how i got here and i'm gonna\ntalk\nfrom the future self\nof exactly what i did oh this is what i\ndid with my the people i surrounded\nmyself i stopped hanging around other\npeople that that were demotivated me\nfound some friends that were doing this\ni started waking up at this time i\nstarted doing this i started getting\nmore knowledge around this i got mentors\nin this and what happens is it makes it\nfeel at least a little bit more real\nbecause i'm talking from the future not\nlike hey these are my goals way off in\nthe distance it's like hey i've already\ndone this this is how i did it and for\nsome people just that little switch will\nallow them to stop thinking oh it's not\npossible it will kind of silence their\nlimiting beliefs at least from a little\nwhile because it's like hey i can dream\nthat it's the future i can pretend that\ni'm four years old again that anything\nis possible then i just created this\namazing life here's how i did it and so\nthe second thing is to make a plan on\nhow to get there\nthis is what i would say the more\ndetailed that you can be with your plan\nthe better because that's going to make\nnumber three even easier so if you say\nin order to get to 10 million dollars i\nto do this this this this and this well\nnow i've got a pretty good plan of what\nwe need to do what you need to do each\nmorning in order to get there step\nnumber three\nis to figure out what daily actions\nneed to be taken in order to hit that\ngoal i'm really big on action i'm really\nbig on just stop thinking so much stop\nover thinking stop with your limiting\nbeliefs and all that [ __ ] that\ndoesn't matter because none of it's true\nyour limiting beliefs are as true as as\nyour your goals in the future you can\nbelieve in your limited beliefs you can\nbelieve in your goals in the future\nwhichever one is that you want but you\ncan't believe them both at the same time\nand neither one of them actually truly\nexists so why don't i just believe in\nthe ones that sound more exciting number\nthree is to figure out what daily\nactions you need to take in order to hit\nthose goals what daily actions so like\nthe person that would get the future\nthat i want this is what their life\nlooks like this is what time they wake\nup in the morning this is how often they\nwork out this is the type of food that\nthey eat these are the people they hang\nout with this is what they do with their\nday this is how they talk to themselves\nin their head this is their nightly\nroutine this is the type of dinner that\nthey have\nlunch you go through every single detail\nand you start to make a plan of what\nwould it look like for me to have what\nwould i have to do daily how would i\nhave to operate as a human daily in\norder to be the person that could\naccomplish goals that are that amazing\nand you start coming up with a very very\ndetailed plan and then the fourth thing\nis that you wake up\nevery morning and you make a plan for\nthat day this is something that i\nguarantee 95 percent of people listen to\nmy voice right now you don't make a\ndaily plan you might make a to-do list\nor a checklist but you don't make a\ndaily plan\nof okay you know i know where my future\nis i know where my goals are i know\nwhere it is that i'm going but now i\nneed to figure out what i need to do\ntoday because nothing else matters i\ndon't give a damn about tomorrow the\nonly thing that matters is actually\ntoday so why don't i really milk today\nfor every single thing that i can i'm\ngonna make a goal today and the easiest\nway to do this is this\nit's very simple you make a to-do list\nof everything that needs to be done\ntoday knowing that 90 of the things that\nyou put on that list are probably not\ngoing to be done today and you have to\nbe okay with that know that the majority\nof things are not going to be you know\nthat you're going to put down here to\nthis day are probably not going to be\ndone today unless they absolutely have\nto be done today you look at that to-do\nlist and you figure out what your number\none number two and number three most\nimportant goals are for that day of what\nhas to be done what action items\nare the most important action items for\nthe day and what you do is you take a\nthree by five card a cue card and you\nwrite number one and you write it down\nunder that you write number two and you\nwrite it down you write down number\nthree and you write it down you don't do\nanything\nat all\nuntil number one is done that's it i\ndon't care if you get to number two or\nnumber three as long as your most\nimportant thing gets done each day\nyou're gonna start doing really well and\nthen after number one is done now i can\nmove on to number two now i can move on\nto number three after that is done the\nreason why i want to put on a three by\nfive car is because i can take that\nthree by five card i can put it in my\nback pocket i can leave my to-do list at\nhome i can leave my phone in the other\nroom and all i have to focus on\nare these three things on the piece of\npaper and think about this if you were\nto accomplish your three most important\nthings every single day\nover the course of a year that's over a\nthousand\nof your most important things being\nexecuted every single day what i care\nabout\nfor hitting your goals is not the goal\nitself once again you need goals yes not\ntrying to make them you know to demonize\ngoals they're needed but they're not the\nmost important thing why because\nconsistent\ndaily action is the most important thing\nget off your ass stop thinking so much\nstop overthinking just freaking do it\nthe beautiful thing about your limiting\nbeliefs and your lack of belief and your\nexcuses that you don't have to believe\nin yourself in order to take action you\ndon't you don't have to believe in\nanything in order to take action you\njust got to get your ass up and moving\nyou've just got to physically move your\nbody because your mind is thinking your\nbody will do whatever you tell it to do\nand so if your mind is like oh my god i\ndon't know if i can do this oh my\nlimiting beliefs i'm not smart enough\ni'm not good enough i'm not prepared\nenough i don't know if i'm gonna be a\ngood enough parent\nyou can have all of that bs run through\nyour head the entire time that your\nbody's moving and actually taking action\nso if somebody thinks oh my limiting\nbeliefs are holding me back no your\nlimiting beliefs are not holding you\nback your thoughts about your actions\nthat need to be taken are actually\nwhat's holding you back and so if you\njust move your body in whatever it is\nthat needs to be direct the direction\nthat needs to be successful that's it it\nwill eventually work and so what you\nhave to realize\nis there's three things\nthat are the most important pieces to\nhitting a goal number one direction\nwhich is knowing what the goal is what\nthe end result is you're trying to hit\nnumber two is action and number three is\ntime it's so it's so ridiculously simple\nhow simple life is\nbut we make it so hard of like how\nsimple success is but we make it so hard\nbecause we put our mind and our mind\ngets in the equation it starts making a\nbunch of stuff doesn't matter you need\ndirection you need action and you need\ntime\nthat's it direction action time so let's\nsay for instance\ni talk about a lot because it's just a\nsimple thing because it's we can put\nnumbers to it let's say you want to lose\nweight\nokay\nlose weight let's figure out what is the\ndirection that we're going towards that\nwould be considered the goal right the\ndirection okay i want to lose 20 pounds\nso when i when i say i want to lose 20\npounds what direction would i need to be\nheading every single day\nevery single week in order to lose 20\npounds you know what i'm gonna do four\nworkouts a week that's part of my\ndirection that i'm going to okay four\nworkouts a week we got it i'm going to\nknow what meals i'm going to be eating\nfor breakfast lunch and dinner and all\nof my snacks in between i'm gonna know\nevery meal going into this next week\nthat's direction part of my direction is\ni'm going to actually decide that i'm\ngoing to remove all of the food\nthat doesn't\nserve me or isn't part of my meal plan\nit's going to be gone it's not going to\nexist in my house i'm going to get rid\nof all of the sodas only thing i'm going\nto drink is water there's not going to\nbe an alcohol there's not going to be\nany you know margaritas there's no going\nto be not going to be any beer there's\nnot going to be any wine so now i've got\na pretty good idea of the direction\nthat i need to head in\nokay now the next thing i need to do is\ni need action okay what have i decided\ni've decided that i need to work out\nfour times a week i need to figure out\nwhat days those are what times i'm going\nto be working out and i'm going to put\nin my schedule so i don't try to get out\nof it the action that i need to take\njust makes sure my ass is in the gym\nwhen i say i'm going to be in the gym\nand to make it even better if i have my\nworkouts planned all i have to do is\nshow up look at the workout that i\nalready have planned and then just\nexecute that is action what else i need\nto prep on sunday\nall 21 meals that i need to make i need\nto go to the grocery store i need to\ntake a couple hours and make sure that\nit's done because if it's important to\nyou'll find a way if it's not important\nto you'll find an excuse so i'm gonna\ntake some time on sunday when i could be\nhanging out by the pool or at the beach\nor at the lake drinking some mimosas and\nhaving brunch with my friends i could do\nall that if i wanted to but that's not\nin the direction of my goals so i'm not\ngoing to do that i'm going to go to the\ngrocery store i'm not saying don't enjoy\nyour life either enjoy your life but if\nyour goals are important you need to get\nthese things down then what i'm going to\ndo is i'm going to walk into the grocery\nstore i'm going to buy all of the food\nthat i need and i'm going to take a\ncouple hours and i'm gonna meal prep and\nput all of those meals into\nglass containers that i can just take\nwith me whenever i leave and i go to\nwork that's the action that needs to be\ntaken what's the other action remove all\nof the crappy food that i've already\ndecided i'm not gonna be eating that is\nthe action so i've got the direction now\ni've taken the action what's the last\npiece time just be patient that's it we\nthink that we're supposed to have the\nlife that we want the body that we want\nthe success they want the business that\nwe want the relationships we want like\nthat like it's just going to happen it\ndoesn't happen that way that's not how\nlife works you know\nin your head right now that going to the\ngym four times and planning out seven\ndays of meals on day seven you're not\ngonna be the in the best shape of your\nentire life you're not gonna be ripped\nand sexy and ready to hop in a bikini or\nto be in your bathing suit or have\nsix-pack abs you're not gonna have those\nin seven days\nyou know that so as long as you just\nhave what did i say earlier consistent\ndaily action\nyou're eventually going to get to\nwherever it is that you need to go\nconsistent daily action consistent daily\naction consistent daily action i don't\ncare what's going on in your mind all i\ncare about is that you move your body\ninto the direction of the goals that\nyou're working towards direction action\ntime let's say that you want to save six\nthousand dollars this year you've never\nsaved any money before you only make 30\ngrand 40 grand 50 grand and you're like\ni want to save money i want to finally\nbe able to save money okay direction all\nright i need to stop going out to eat so\nmuch okay that's a little gonna put me\nin the direction i want i need to\nautomatically deduct from my paycheck\nthat would help me if i just had an\nautomatic deduction that went into a\nseparate bank account and i need to\ncheck my bank account every day that's\npretty good direction to get me towards\nsaving that six thousand dollars of the\ncourse the year okay that's direction\naction um i need to go and actually set\nup the automatic deduction to pull out a\nhundred dollars out of my bank account\nevery single paycheck you know and\nactually out of my paycheck to put into\na separate bank account is what i mean\ni need to make sure that i go to the\ngrocery store so that i have enough food\nso that i can have the food in my house\nso that i don't feel like i need to go\nout to eat i need to make sure that i\nset up everything that i need to to make\nit as easy as possible for me to save\nmoney and i need to stop\nyou know going to the mall on the\nweekends\nbecause when i go to the mall on the\nweekends when i'm bored i end up\nspending money if i can just remove a\ncouple things and i can make sure my\ndirection is in the right direction if i\ncan make sure my action is in the right\ndirection then\ni just gotta wait\nas long as my consistent daily action is\nin the direction of where i'm trying to\ngo i'm eventually gonna get there\nthat's why they always say that\ndirection is more important than speed\nwhen it comes to your goals as long as\nyou're heading in the right direction\nyou'll eventually get there you just\ngotta ask yourself are you headed in the\nright direction with everything that\nyou're trying to do so you need\ndirection you need action and need time\nthings take time in this world nothing\nhappens right away and so you've just\ngot to learn to be patient as long as\nyour consistent daily action is headed\ninto the direction of where your goals\nare and where you're trying to go\nyou'll eventually get there that's the\nbeautiful thing about it i remember when\ni was 20\n22 25 years old i was like why don't i\nhave why am i not a millionaire why am i\nnot as successful as i want to be why\nwhy why why why and now i'm 35 and you\nknow 15 years of working on myself my\nbusiness finally happened i'm like oh i\njust needed to be patient that's it as\nlong as i woke up and i made sure that\nmy action was in the direction of the\nlife i wanted to create\neventually i'm going to wake up and i'm\ngoing to get there and it might be 35\nmight be 45 55 whatever it is\nit might take time but you just have to\nbe patient knowing that you're headed in\nthe right direction and that's more\nmotivating because you know you're in\nthe right direction then looking at your\ngoals and going oh my god it's so far\naway it's so far i don't know if i'll\never get there and now i'm not motivated\nto work no i just need to focus on what\ni need to do today so you need to figure\nout what direction you need to go into\nwhat i actually need to take and then\nyou just got to wait goals take time\nwhat's more important is is having the\nstandard of being the person who follows\nthrough having the standard being the\nperson that checks off the three things\nthat need to be done every single day i\nwant to become the person who takes the\nactions that they need to i want to\nbecome the person that doesn't listen to\ntheir limiting beliefs i want to become\nthe person that doesn't care about other\npeople's opinions i want to become the\nperson that takes consistent daily\naction i want to become the person that\ndoesn't overthink anymore you know\nthere's nothing to overthink
