    "transcript": "a lot of people think\nthat the word discipline for a lot of\npeople has a bad connotation when i'm\ntalking about self-discipline\nself-discipline is actually an act of\nself-love\ntoday i'm going to be teaching you the\nfive steps to be more self-disciplined\nand to get [ __ ] done today so we're\ngonna talk about how to build the\ndiscipline muscle the discipline habit\nthe way that i see discipline is i don't\nthink anybody is born with discipline i\nthink that it's something that is that\nis\nprogrammed into us whether it's our\nparents that program it into us or\nwhether we program it into ourselves\nand i think that i see it as a muscle i\nsee it as a habit and i see it as\nsomething that anybody can bring into\nthemselves no matter how lazy or\nunproductive they are at this moment and\ni really got into this because i was\ntalking to my fiance about it last night\nwhen i was driving my truck\nand we were talking about someone that\nthat she knows that's really disciplined\nand she goes it's really it makes sense\nthough because both of his parents are\nreally disciplined his mom's real\nsuccess real successful his dad is real\nsuccessful they're both very driven\npeople and it makes sense why he's so\ndriven and i say what about his brothers\nand sisters and she said yeah that's\ninteresting because all of them the\nentire family is driven and so it's\nsomething that you can learn whether\nit's learning it from your parents or\nsomething that you can instill in\nyourself as well and so i see it like a\nmuscle the more that you work your\ndiscipline muscle the more it's going to\ngrow the more you work a discipline plus\nthe more it's going to grow at this\npoint in time if you don't have a whole\nlot of discipline it might just be\nbecause you got weak discipline muscles\nit's like you haven't been to the gym\nmaybe your entire life but if you just\ndecide to start going to the gym and\ndecide to start lifting weights and show\nup and show up and show up and show up\nconsistently\neventually your muscles will grow your\nmuscles are just going to grow that's\nthe way that your body works it's the\nexact same way for discipline for me i\nwas a very undisciplined person for a\nlong time in my life for the first 19 20\nyears i was completely undisciplined i\ndidn't like doing any work any of that\nstuff\nand now it's hard to not be disciplined\nit's hard to not be driven to get\nsomething done and so i know\nfrom myself and from other people that\ni've worked with discipline is something\nthat can be built into you it's not\nsomething that you're born with\nbut\nit's something that can be developed you\ndon't need discipline for easy things\nthat's the funny thing about it you need\ndiscipline for the hard things you don't\nneed discipline\nfor you know sleeping in you don't need\ndiscipline for not going to the gym you\ndon't need discipline to eat a pizza you\nneed discipline to actually do the\nthings that you need to do to move the\nneedle in your life and before we dive\ninto the five tips i want to tell you\nsomething about discipline i think is\nsuper important a lot of people think\nthat the word discipline is\nfor a lot of people it has a bad\nconnotation if your child does something\nor your does something wrong you\ndiscipline them if they don't get good\ngrades or they don't act the way they're\nsupposed to if your dog poops on the\nfloor you're going to discipline your\ndog but when i'm talking about\nself-discipline self-discipline is\nactually an act of self-love it's not an\nact of doing something bad it's an act\nof self-love because you always need\nself-discipline to do the things that\nare good for you you don't need\nself-discipline like i said to sleep in\nyou don't need self-discipline to not\nwork out you don't need self-discipline\nto eat a pizza you need self-discipline\nto wake up early to work on yourself you\nneed self-discipline to eat the healthy\nfoods you need the self-discipline to\nget yourself to the gym and so\nself-discipline is an act of self-love\nit's not an act of you know something\nnegative which is the way we usually\nthink of the word of discipline so i\nwant to tell you that before we we dive\ninto it but it's also not about being\nperfect you will never be perfect and so\nyou don't need to worry about that it's\nnot about being just like this badass\nproductivity machine all day every\nsingle day it's about making sure that\nyou're the majority of the actions that\nyou take are\nthe actions that need to be taken to get\nyou to where you want to be and to move\nthe needle so it's not about being\nperfect all the time because one of the\nthings i see with people\nas they start to work themselves and\nthey start to try to get better\nis they will be really good for a couple\ndays and then they'll fall off and then\nthey start to judge themselves and they\nstart to feel guilty and then the\njudgment and the guilt and the shame and\nthe negative self-talk knocks them off\npath and they don't do it needs to be\ndone and so i want you to realize you\ndon't have to be perfect it's about\nwinning more than you're losing and\nthat's the way that you really get get\nto move the needle in your house and\nyou're in your life okay so number one\nis to challenge yourself to finish every\nsingle thing that you start challenge\nyourself to finish every single thing\nthat you start no matter what it is\nchallenge yourself to make sure that you\nget done if you make yourself a salad\nyou have to finish the salad and then if\nyou made the salad you have to put\neverything away before you can go on to\nthe next thing one of the things that's\nreally interesting that i i have a a new\ncoach i guess you could say i'm learning\nhow to fly a plane and so i have a\ncertified flight instructor it's funny\nbecause he's not teaching me life skills\nbut i see life skills coming through as\nhe's teaching me so he's kind of i like\nto call him my coach or anything else\none of the things that you have to do\nand is when you're about to pre-flight\nyour plane you're going through the\nplane you're looking at everything is\nyou have to check the fuel on the plane\nand you have to go through and in the\nplane that we have\nthere's five different places where you\nhave to literally take the fuel out so\ntwo different places where you have to\ntake the fuel out of the uh further out\non the ends of the wing further and\ncloser to the cockpit and uh the\nfuselage and then actually one actually\ncoming directly at the engine where you\nactually have to literally get the the\ngas out of\nthere and actually check to make sure\nthat it's good gas and one of the times\ni left the cup that you put the gas in\non one of the wings and he goes this is\nan important part that you need to\nlearn about aviation is you don't do\nsomething else until the thing that\nyou're doing is done and so even if\nyou're on you know where i've put my gas\naway the little cup is on the left back\nside of the plane\nthe where i always am at though is the\nright wing of the plane so the complete\nopposite side of the plane and so what\nhe says is\neven if it's on the other side of a\nplane you don't do anything else until\nit's completed so you have to walk all\nthe way to the other side of the plane\nand you have to put it away and the\nreason why i love this is because he\nsays in aviation\nyou have to make sure that the thing\nthat you're working on gets done before\nyou move to something else because if\nyou happen to forget something because\nyou go on to something else because\nyou're distracted that can be\ncatastrophic and so you've got to start\nto think about yourself in your life in\nthe exact same way and this is what i\nlove about coaches in all different\naspects of life\nis that no matter how big the thing is\nno matter how small the thing is\nchallenge yourself not to do anything\nelse until that thing is done you hear\nme say it all the time when you wake up\nin the morning make your bed when you uh\nyou know have your coffee just clean the\ncoffee mug whatever it is that you're\ndoing if you if you brush your teeth and\nyou happen to you know brush your teeth\nand get a little bit that's on the\nmirror wipe it off when you go and\nyou're deciding what you want to wear\nfor the night and you're changing\nthrough all of these different outfits\ndon't leave all of those outfits on your\nbed and then go out what you do is you\nliterally figure out what else you're\ngoing to wear put it on and then hang up\nagain and put away every single article\nof clothing you've heard me say it over\nand over and over again and i just said\nin another podcast the way you do one\nthing is the way you do everything and\nso if you can force yourself to be\nself-disciplined for the little teeny\ntiny things like making your bed putting\nyour clothes away making sure that you\nwash the dish every single thing that\nyou do\nyou're going to translate that into all\nof the big things in your life as well\nand so make sure that you're disciplined\nin getting every single teeny tiny thing\ndone and finishing what you start don't\nallow yourself to stop early because\nstopping early is also a habit and so if\nyou're trying to develop a habit what is\nthe habit you're trying to develop\nfinishing what it is that you started so\nthat's the first one step number two is\nto plan ahead if you want to just be\nmore self-disciplined and get more stuff\ndone start being better at planning\nahead it it really boggles my mind how\nfew people plan out their week\nand then they don't plan out their day\nin the morning if you take five minutes\nwith yourself every single morning and\nask yourself okay look at my schedule\nwhat i have going on today and you take\nfive minutes and you close your eyes and\nyou say hey what do i want my day to\nlook like today how do i want to feel\ni'm going to go through driving to work\nbeing at work\nthe presentation i have to give lunch\nthe conversation i want to have and you\njust visualize what the perfect day\nwould look like to you and you plan\nahead you'll be so much more productive\nand it'll it'll be so much easier to be\ndisciplined whenever you've gone through\nthat another idea of planning ahead if\nyou're trying to lose weight you're\ntrying to get into better shape why\ndon't you just start meal planning like\nplan ahead every sunday create all of\nyour meals and then you don't even have\nto think about what it is that you got\nto eat every single day you've already\ngot it made that's what planning ahead\nlooks like to be more self-disciplined\nif you've got a workout four times a\nweek and that's part of your\nself-discipline why don't you plan out\nyour\non sunday what workouts you're gonna be\ndoing day one day two day three day four\nand plan out the workouts so that when\nyou show up to the gym you don't even\nhave to think you just have to take\naction and so sometimes one of the\nbiggest resist pieces of resistance that\nwe have towards doing things is the\nmental energy that it takes to get ready\nand prepared for those things but if you\ncan make it easier by preparing ahead of\ntime and already having those things\ndone it'll make it much more easier much\neasier on yourself to execute what it is\nthat needs to be done and so make sure\nthat what you're doing is you're\nplanning ahead for all of the important\nthings that are coming up in your life\nas well that will help you be so much\nmore self-disciplined\nthat's number two number three is to\ndesign your environment what do you want\nyour environment to look like how can\nyou create an environment that makes it\neasier for you to take action or makes\nit easier for you to accomplish your\ngoals so let's say that you want to lose\nweight okay well in your environment of\nyour house in your car where you work\nall of those things how can you design\nyour environment to help you in\naccomplishing that goal of being more\ndisciplined for me\ni love sugar i think it's amazing and if\ni have sugar inside of the house it's\nbeing eaten by me and i'll probably eat\nall of it in one sitting and so what i\ndo is i don't allow any candy any of\nthat stuff to be inside the house\nbecause i know\ni i'm weak when sugar's around it's like\nthe animalistic part of my brain takes\nover and it's like go find the sugar and\njust do it so\nto make it easier on myself and to have\nmore discipline\ni just don't have sugar inside the house\nmakes it easy on me so if sugar is a\nthing for you how can you remove the\nsugar if alcohol is a thing for you how\ncan we have alcohol i had a friend that\ni just spoke to and we were on a zoom\ncall a couple hours ago and i haven't\ntalked to him about three years and i\nhopped on a zoom call with him and i\nbarely recognized him and i was like man\nwhat what happened to you like how much\nweight did you lose he's like i've lost\nabout 40 pounds i haven't seen him in\nthree years it's like i've lost like 40\npounds like you look amazing what did\nyou do he goes do you want her the crazy\nthing man i just stopped drinking\nalcohol he goes i love drinking alcohol\nnot an alcoholic sense but i just love\ndrinking it just the way it feels going\nout being with friends and stuff he goes\ni just stopped drinking alcohol and he\nlooked like a completely different\nperson you know he just decided to take\nhis environment and not have any alcohol\nin the house because if the temptation\nisn't there it makes it easier to be\nmore self-disciplined which then makes\nit easier to hit his goals so\nanother thing as far as your environment\ngoes is think about the people that\nyou're hanging out with you know don't\nbe around people who will challenge your\ndiscipline don't be around you know if\nyou want to stop drinking like my friend\ni was just talking about\nthen don't go around your friends at a\nbar because that's going to make it\nreally hard to be less disciplined and\nso you've got to design your environment\nto be the environment that you you would\nwant to help you in facilitating your\nhelp you facilitate the accomplishment\nof the goals or the action that needs to\nbe taken to get you to where you need to\nbe so number three is to design your\nenvironment\nnumber four is to work and to focus on\nprogress not perfection this is huge for\na lot of people progress not perfection\ndone is better than perfect so focus on\nprogress not perfection so you know when\nyou mess up which you will\ndon't beat yourself up make adjustments\nthat's all you have to do one of the\nthings that really holds people back the\nmost is that when they screw something\nup they literally drag themself on glass\nand and just like literally it's like\ndragging himself on glass of guilt and\nshame and negative self-talk and being\nterrible to themselves and so many\npeople\nif they would just stop guilting\nthemselves it would make it so much more\nso much easier for them to be more\ndisciplined but also get things done\nthat they need to get done right so when\nyou mess up which you will let me say it\nagain you will mess up over and over and\nover and over again that is part of\nbeing human realize that it is about\nprogress\nand not perfection when you mess up make\nadjustments take a step back and ask\nyourself what happened and what could i\nhave done better so if you look at that\nand you go okay well my goal is to not\nhave any sugar\nokay well what could i have i just ate\nsome sugar what could i have done to\nhave gotten away from that well i\nprobably could have shared my goals with\nmy wife so that she would have known\nthat i don't want to have any sugar and\nthat she probably would have bought that\nice cream and i wouldn't have you know\npounded that quart of ice cream well\nokay now we know we take a step back and\nwe look at it and say okay now what i\nneed to do is i need to share my goals\nwith her and say hey if you want ice\ncream you can get it but do me a favor\nyou know either finish it before you get\nto the house or you know hide it from me\nso i can't see it whatever it is that\nyou need like literally this i'm not\nkidding when i tell you this my fiance\nif she has candy she hides it from me\nbecause she knows that if if i find it\nit's gone like it's done it's just it's\ncached not happening it's gone and so\nshe literally will hide stuff from me\nbecause she knows that she wants to\nenjoy it later like she's the type of\nperson that can sit down and she can\nenjoy one piece of chocolate and then\nlike tomorrow come back and enjoy in one\nmore piece of chocolate i'm the purse\nwhere if i have one piece of chocolate\nand it registers my brain i'm pounding\nthe whole freaking bag and so with her\nshe hides it from me that's just our\nrelationship and i'm completely cool\nwith it why\nbecause it helps me when i don't know\nthat it's there so my environment is is\ndesigned in that way but also if i do\nhave a piece of chocolate or do have\nsomething then i i don't beat myself up\nover it because\ni would say the majority of the days i\ndon't have any and so i'm not gonna try\nto live a life that i don't enjoy and so\nit's about progress and not perfection\nor anything else so that's number four\nand number five is reward yourself like\nit's okay to reward yourself if you have\na really good week and let's just let's\njust stay on this fitness thing that\nwe're talking about and you have a\nreally good week of working out and you\nhave a really good week of eating\nhealthy\nhave a cheat meal i remember when i used\nto be really really big into i was about\n20 pounds heavier than i am now and i\nwas had way more muscle\ni'd still have it if i didn't have all\nthese injuries that i've had over the\npast few years i'm sure but i would have\none cheat meal a week and it was like\nthe most glorious cheat meal ever i\nwould look forward to that saturday it\nwas saturday evening i would have that\ncheat meal and it was like i would go\nget a pizza and i would eat the entire\npizza and then i would have a massive\nbit of ice cream and then literally\nalmost every single week i would pass\nout right after because my body was like\nshut down there's too much going on\nmy body needed to digest all of it but\nit was so glorious to literally have\nlike this one meal that i could look\nforward to and then i ate so much all of\nthose things that i didn't i didn't feel\nthe need to cheat the entire rest of the\nweek because i was like holy crap that\nwas a lot i need to kind of chill out\nand so reward yourself if you are trying\nto stay away from sugar reward yourself\na little bit of sugar once a week\nwhatever you need to do design your\nenvironment to help you be more\nsuccessful to help you get done whatever\nit is you need to get done if you need\nto make 100 phone calls every single day\nin your business okay well on the end of\nfriday when you get those 500 phone\ncalls done for the entire week how are\nyou going to reward yourself so\nenjoy your life and what you're doing\ndon't be so disciplined that it just\nbecomes\nuh monotonous and not fun you've got to\nhave some sort of way to when you do\nsucceed have a cheat meal if you make\n100 calls you get a bag of skittles\nwhatever it is that's going to help you\nto reward yourself so that therefore you\nwant to go and be self-disciplined again\nbecause you can't be self-disciplined\nall of the time but when you have a\nreward for being more self-disciplined\nit makes it easier to go ahead and be\nmore self-disciplined the next round\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well it's\nso ridiculously simple how simple life\nis\nbut we make it so hard"
