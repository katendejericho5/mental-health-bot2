you five\ndifferent keys to stop\nprocrastinating and stop being so\nfreaking lazy and this is big because we\nall know it's like life is very simple\nsuccess whatever success means to you in\nyour life it's very very simple\nall you have to do is take action\nthe only problem is we're not taking as\nmuch action as we should be and so when\ni always tell people i'm like hey do you\nknow what you need to do to be\nsuccessful\n95 of the time somebody says yes i know\nwhat i need to do to be successful i'm\nlike well why are you not doing it then\nwell it's because you know i tend to\nprocrastinate and sometimes i overthink\nand sometimes i get lazy and not really\nsure and so it's not that we don't know\nwhat we need to do to be successful\nwhatever success means to you it just\ncomes down to we're not doing it and so\nyou have to ask yourself what do i need\nto do to create the life i want what do\ni need to do stop procrastinating what\ndo you do stop being lazy and so if\nyou're lazy or you're a procrastinator\nthis episode is for you i'm going to\ngive you the five different things to\nhelp you stop procrastinating and to\nstart actually getting done step number\none is to stop lying to yourself it's\nvery simple stop lying to yourself admit\nthat you're procrastinating too much\nadmit that you're lazy admit that you\noverthink and you're not taking action\nsaid admit that you're getting paralysis\nby analysis because you're analyzing all\nthe things that you're doing instead of\nactually doing the things that you need\nto be doing it's like when you go\nthrough a 12-step program\nthe very first thing that you need to do\nis you got to admit that you're you know\nif you're going through a 12-step\nprogram as alcoholic you've got to admit\nthat you're an alcoholic before you do\nanything else because all of the rest of\nthe steps don't matter if you're not\ngoing to be admitting to yourself and\nactually saying oh i am an alcoholic so\nthe first thing you need to do is you\nneed to stop lying to yourself admit\nyes i am too lazy sometimes yes i over i\nprocrastinate yes i overthink yes i get\nparalysis by analysis now that i've\nadmitted it now i can at least start to\nwork through it instead of hiding from\nit because when i'm hiding from it i'm\nnot admitting it it makes it really hard\nto work through it because i don't\nactually admit to myself that's\nsomething that's real so you've got to\nstop lying to yourself about it you've\ngot to call it what it is and once you\nadmit it\nyou can then start to work through it\nand so here's the thing that i think i\ndon't think there's any proof in the\nworld that this exists but this is just\nmy theory i think that in humans or\nhumans are inherently lazy\ni just do i think most humans are\ninherently lazy and i think it comes\nfrom our ancestors because if you think\nabout this you know it's if it's a hot\nday outside and our ancestors are in the\nmiddle of the the serengeti and it's\nreally hot there's only two real times\nthat they're gonna be doing a lot of\nstuff that's in the morning when the sun\nfirst comes up and it's still kind of\ncool and all the animals are running\naround and they're up and awake and\nthat's what our ancestral god and they\nwould hunt and they would forage and\nthen they would have it at sunset as\nwell when it was cooling down again they\nwouldn't be doing it what's 110 degrees\nfahrenheit outside\nthey'd be doing it when it wasn't the\nhottest and it wasn't taking the most\nfrom them and so\nwhat were they doing throughout the rest\nof the day\ni have the theory that they were\nprobably just hanging out\nunder a tree in the shade\ndoing whatever they need to do eating\nthe food that they got this morning\ntaking care of their family\nputting the stuff together that they\nneed to and when they were doing the\nmost was usually in the sunset and\nsunrise so the majority of their time\nwas probably spent doing not a whole lot\ndoing a few things getting some stuff\ndone under the shade of a tree or\nwhatever it was but the majority of\ntheir work wasn't happening then and so\ni think that as a human\nwe probably have built into us\ntrying to find the path of least\nresistance\ntrying to get out of things trying to\nnot work as much and so when you take a\nhuman thinking that our ancestors 100\n000 years ago were probably hanging out\nunder the trees and just chilling and\nbeing lazy during the middle of the day\nand now you have a human you me where\nwe're sitting there and we're like well\nnow i've got to get work done i've got\nto be productive throughout the day\nmaybe\nwe've just got to come to the\nrealization that\nwe are inherently lazy now just because\nwe're inherently lazy does not mean that\nwe can't take action but we just have to\nadmit hey maybe we'll just take full\nacceptance\ni won't blame anything externally\nanymore i won't talk about how it's this\nperson's fault or this person's fault or\nthis person's fault why i'm not taking\naction i'll just say you know what\ni'm a human humans are inherently lazy\ni'm not going to be lazy forever i admit\nit i'm going to work through it i'm\ngoing to take full acceptance\nbut now i'm going to actually try to go\nthrough and create something with myself\nso the first thing that i want you to do\nis just freaking admit to yourself if\nyou're lazy call it what it is if\nthere's an elephant in the room call out\nthe elephant the elephant in the room is\nlazy so cool you're lazy now we can go\nthrough and we can actually start\nworking through it so that's the first\nstep step number two\nis to take your goals and start to make\nthem more bite-sized\nmake them easier to digest like if you\nhave a a big huge t-bone steak in front\nof you you're not going to take the\nentire steak and throw it in your mouth\nwhat are you going to do you're going to\ntake the steak and you're going to make\nbite-size pieces and then you're going\nto chew on those pieces to make the\npieces even smaller so that your body\ncan digest it and so one thing that i\nfind that's really interesting about\nhumans\nis that we'll look at like our five-year\nand our 10-year goals we'll be like i\nwant to be worth 10 million dollars and\nimpact the world on this scale and\nhave this and this and have traveled all\nover the world within the next 10 years\nand we look at those goals and sometimes\nthose goals are so big and believe me i\nlove shooting for big goals and i do\nthink there is there is value to doing\nso\nbut there's more value in making a bite\nsize and the reason why is because when\nyou look at those 10-year goals\nthey can seem so far away and they can\nseem so big that it's actually more\ndemotivating than motivating and so the\nthing that i think that you should do is\ntake your goals and make them more\nbite-sized you're not going to eat the\nentire steak at once you're going to\nhave little teeny tiny bite-sized pieces\nof that steak and so i'll give you an\nexample right\ni used to train a lot of sales reps by\ntime i was 24 i trained over 2000 sales\nreps almost every single sales rep that\ncame into my office wanted to make a\nhundred thousand dollars in a year\nbecause they never made a hundred\nthousand dollars a year and so when they\nlook at that they're like okay i want to\nmake a hundred thousand dollars this\nyear cool\nwell what does that mean for this week\nthat's what's most important and then\nwhat does that mean for today how many\nphone calls do you need to make today so\nit's good to to have big goals and stuff\nto shoot for that can be fun but if you\nlook at a hundred thousand dollars and\nthat hundred thousand dollars is 365\ndays from today\nthat can be demotivating and so what you\ndo is you take your goals\nthat hundred thousand dollars that you\nwant to make this year and you say okay\nwell if i take that and i divide it by\nyou know 12 which is 12 months which i\ncan literally divided by 12 months\nthat's about a little bit over 8 000 i\nthink it's 8 33 a month is how much you\nneed to make okay that's a little bit\nmore bite-sized so that comes out to\nabout 2 000\nabout 2075 dollars a about two thousand\nseventy five dollars a week that i need\nto make okay cool well what would i have\nto do as a sales rep to make two\nthousand seventy five dollars this week\nor whatever it might be whenever i do\nthe math right this is off top of my\nhead so i don't math isn't perfect in\nhere but you start to actually take that\nyear-long goal and go what do i have to\ndo this week what do i have to do today\nand so if you look at you're like okay\nbased off of my numbers based off my\nclosing percentage based off how many\npeople say yes how many people say no i\nhave to make 100 calls this week okay i\nwork five days this week so that means\nthat i need to make 20 calls today so i\ndon't want you to focus on the 100 000\nyou want to make all i want you to focus\non is 20 calls today and to make it even\nmore bite-sized i don't even care about\nthe 20 calls today i just care about the\nnext call you need to make that's it and\nso now you're looking at you know\nrealize how much easier this makes it on\nyou instead of focusing on a hundred\nthousand dollars you're focusing on one\nphone call and then when you're done\nwith that phone call you're focused on\nthe next phone call and then when you\nlook at that\nthat phone call you focus on the next\nphone call and so you take these big\nhuge lofty goals and you make them\nbite-size because sometimes you're lazy\nor you're procrastinating because your\ngoals are just a little bit too big and\nthey're too far in the future and it's\nnot motivating to go and search for\nsomething and to work for something\nthat's that far ahead you got to get\nsomething right now that's immediate\nthat's bite size and that's easier to\ndigest so number two is to take your\ngoals and make them bite size number\nthree the third thing is to find your\nwhy\nwhy do you want to do whatever your\ngoals are why do you want to take action\nbecause if you don't know the why behind\nwhat you're doing\ni'm gonna be honest with you it's gonna\nbe very hard to motivate yourself to\nalso do it as well my very first mentor\nlike burned this into my head he used to\nalways say if the y is strong enough the\nhow will reveal itself if the why is\nstrong enough the how will reveal itself\nso if your why as to why you're going\nfor your goals or why you're needing to\ntake action or why you're doing this\nthing that you're doing today is strong\nenough how it will get done\nis going to eventually figure itself out\nyou'll figure out how to get it done\ni'll give you an example you know if i\nsaid i always say this all the time\nbecause it really makes sense for a lot\nof people\nand this deals with your why okay if i\nwere to say to you\nthat you know if i were to ask you this\nquestion i ask this a lot of times when\ni when i speak live in front of people\nbecause i can see them raise your hands\nand everything but i say hey what is the\npercentage chance and be honest with me\ndon't lie to me don't lie to yourself\nwhat's the percentage chance of you\nmaking a million dollars this year and\neveryone's like you know i say this on\nsometimes on live lessons on zoom and\nstuff and it's like zero zero percent\nzero percent zero percent zero percent\nzero percent what's the percentage\nchance of you making a million dollars\nthis year legally\nit's like zero percent one percent two\npercent very very very very low numbers\nmajority of them are zero and i say okay\ni'm gonna ask you the same question but\na little bit different what is the\npercentage chance of you making a\nmillion dollars this year legally and if\nyou don't\nevery single person that you love\ngets murdered\nwhat's the percentage chance now what do\nyou think everybody says 100 100 a\nthousand percent 10 000 there's no way\non earth that i'm not going to make that\nmillion dollars and i'm like so what\nchanged\nthe goal didn't change\nmillion dollars the time frame didn't\nchange a year what changed your why\nbehind why you want to do it so it's\nnever a fact that you can't get it done\nit's just that you just don't give a sh\nenough at this point and so you've got\nto find something that you believe in\nand that you want so badly and you've\ngot to have a strong why behind it\nthat's the difference where if you say\nhey you know and i've told this story\nbefore\ni had a a coaching client a one-on-one\ncoaching client like six years ago and\nhe wanted to make a hundred thousand\ndollars for the year i was like why is\nthat and he told me why and i said okay\nwhy is that and he told me mine i said\nokay why is that why why why why why why\noriginally he want to make a hundred\nthousand dollars for the year because he\nwanted to make a hundred thousand\ndollars because he thought it'd be fun\nbecause he's never done it before and he\nwanted to make that much money and then\nonce we went deeper and deeper and\ndeeper and deeper and deeper and deeper\nand deeper i found out the reason why he\nwants to make a hundred thousand dollars\nthis year is because he has two young\nchildren\nhe he's divorced recently and his wife\nex-wife has custody of the children and\nshe lives in a really bad part of town\nin new york\nand his biggest fear in the world is\nthat his daughter is going to get\npregnant by the time that she's 13 and\nthen his son is going to be shot in a\ndrive-by and he wants to make a hundred\nthousand dollars so that he could put a\ndown payment on a house so therefore he\ncan get custody of his children and at\nleast put them into a safer part of town\ni said well do you think that why is a\nlittle bit stronger when he can focus on\nhis children's safety and wanting to\nmake a hundred thousand dollars and\nsucceed because of them and their safety\nand wanting to help them in their life\nor do you think it's more motivating\njust to make a hundred thousand dollars\nright it's when he finds his why\nthat's when you find someone that's\ndriven you don't have to search for\nmotivation when your why is that\nfreaking strong so you've got to figure\nout what your why is\nthat's step number three step number\nfour is to remove distractions remove\ndistractions because throughout the day\nyou can tell me that you don't have time\nand i can tell you that that's a bunch\nof bs because anybody can find time for\nsomething that's a priority for them\nbecause you're not just like\nyou know sitting there staring at the\nceiling all day long you're not just\nsitting there hanging out oh i've got\nnothing to do i'm just sitting at the\nsteel you're doing something you're\neither on your phone or you're watching\nnetflix or you're talking to people or\nwhatever it is that you're doing\nscrolling through going onto youtube\nscrolling through\ndifferent websites i don't know what it\nis that you do on a daily basis go to\nespn.com and see what your favorite\nsports teams are doing i don't know what\nyou do but you have to remove your\ndistractions\nand the thing that i recommend is if you\nreally want to get stuff done you want\nto stop being lazy don't like just\nliterally best tip i can give you take\nyour cell phone and put it in the other\nroom for a few hours don't allow\nyourself to go onto facebook don't allow\nyourself to go into social media and\nhave no other options but getting the\nthings done that you need to get done\nyou have to remove all of your\ndistractions turn off all of the\nnotifications on your computer\nall of them like if you send me a\nmessage if you were to text me right now\nthere'd be no way for me to know until i\npick up my phone later on down the road\nand actually open it and unlock it with\nface id like my phone does not light up\nwith text messages the only way that you\ncan get a hold of me is if you call me\nthat's what my phone lights up and tells\nme and so you've got to remove all of\nyour distractions you got to remove all\nof your notifications you've got to let\nsomebody know if you're working from\nhome because of all the stuff that's\nhappening tell your significant other\nwife children whatever it is whoever\nlives with you when i put the sign on\nthe door and it says this\ndon't knock don't come in give me time\nuntil i'm done you can text me and i'll\nsee the text a little bit later and what\nyou do is you actually dedicate\ntime to being ridiculously\ncentered and productive versus just\ntrying to get things done throughout the\nday and then a notification comes\nthrough and then a phone call comes\nthrough and then an email comes through\nand this comes through and that happens\nand this happens someone comes in and\nwants to talk to you all of that stuff\nwhen this sign is on the door do not\nanswer or do not come in through my door\nif you work in an office with a whole\nbunch of other people and it's open\nfloor plan put your headphones on and\nyou know people need to know around you\nhey if my headphones are on that means\ndon't come talk to me unless it's an\nemergency or something extremely urgent\nand so you have a way for people to know\noh\nrob's working i can't interrupt him\nright now oh she's doing this\ni'll i'll talk to her a little bit later\ni'll i'll make sure i make a mental note\nof it i'll talk to them later you've got\nto have some way\nto have non-distracted time to work on\nthings that need to be done whatever\nthat looks like to you that's for you to\nfigure out and so that's number five\nnumber four is to remove distractions\nand number five\njust please do this you've heard me talk\nabout it so many times you listen to\nthis podcast the pomodoro technique work\nfor 25 minutes take five minutes off\nwork for 25 minutes take five minutes\noff work for 25 minutes take five\nminutes off i don't need to tell you the\nscience behind it but i will tell you it\nhas been proven the most effective way\nto use the human brain to be the most\nproductive is to have one task that\nyou're doing for the next 25 minutes and\nyou focus on that one task and that one\ntask only for 25 minutes and then you\ntake five minutes off and you just chill\nyou just you know hang out outside look\nat the blue sky\ngo for a walk whatever it is that you\nneed to do that is completely opposite\nfrom getting the work done and then\nafter five minutes you go back in and\nget the work done again what i always\nrecommend is have a pen and paper next\nto you blank notepad and anything that\npops up into your head because usually\nwhat happens is as we're working we have\nsomething popping in my head we're like\noh my god i gotta do this and then we\nopen up a tab and we start working on\nsomething for a minute whatever pops\ninto your head in the time that you're\nworking for those 25 minutes on one task\nand one task only just write down on\nyour notepad you can get to that later\nand allow your brain to release the\nthinking about that thing so your brain\ncan focus on the one thing that you're\nworking on right now\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout master your mind click right here\nand watch this video as well we have all\nof the excuses we're all so busy oh i\ndon't have enough time to say that you\ndon't have time\nbut you have a netflix subscription then\nyou watch it that's you're\nlying to yourself"
