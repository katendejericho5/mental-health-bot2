you're\nlying to yourself\ntoday we're gonna be talking about how\nto quickly move the needle in your life\nin whatever it is that you're trying to\nwork towards we're going to talk about\nclearing out all of the bs all the stuff\nthat's holding you back that doesn't\nmake sense in prioritizing your mission\nprioritizing your purpose prioritizing\nyour passion whatever it is that you're\ntrying to do and i'm going to talk to\nyou about how to\nmake your success a little bit easier\nand i'll say this before we dive in\nwe're all busy i mean if you're\nlistening to me right now have you ever\nused the phrase i'm too busy i'm so busy\nright now have you said that in the last\nweek you said in last month oh i'm just\nso busy i've said it a bunch of times\nand we all have things going on you know\nthere's work there's kids there's bills\nthere's cleaning the house there's doing\nchores there's laundry you've got to mow\nthe lawn you've got to do your clothes\nyou've got to iron you've got to put\nthem back on them put them away in the\ndresser you've got to hang them up\nyou've got to we have so many as humans\nwe do so many things we got to eat we\ngotta go to the bathroom we gotta drink\nwater we've gotta put stuff inside the\nrefrigerator like we've got so many\nthings so many different actions that we\ndo as humans\nand with that\nwe all have so many excuses that we\ncould give as to why we are so busy and\nwe have too many things going on to\ncreate the life that we want to we have\nall of the excuses\nbut you have to think about this\nwe do a lot of things but the question\nis do we do the right things do we do\nthe things are we currently doing things\nin our life that are moving the needle\ntowards the life that we want to create\nthink about that for a second are you\ntaking action\nor are you taking action towards the\ndesired outcome that you want in your\nlife are you doing the needle moving\nactivities to change your life because\nif you're not your life is going to be\nexactly the same\n365 days from today as it is right now\nunless you're doing needle moving\nactivities you could still keep doing\nthe laundry and i'm not saying don't do\nthe laundry and you can start keep doing\nall the things that you need to and get\nthose things done but it's not needle\nmoving activities there'll always be\nthings that you have to do\nyou have to sleep you know you have to\nbrush your teeth you have to do those\nthings you have to do them but are you\nprioritizing\nthe things that you need to get done\nover everything else let me examine what\ni mean because\nall of us are different and we all have\ndifferent things that we need to do and\nthat's what we're going to dive into\ntoday is this conversation came up in a\ncoaching group that i run\ni teach coaches how to grow coaching\nbusinesses i teach literally coaches how\nto grow online coaching businesses it's\ncalled business breakthrough and\nsomebody asked a question\na couple weeks ago and we were talking\nabout this\nwhere she was saying as i'm trying to\nbuild my business i'm running out of\ntime like i'm trying to do this i'm\ntrying to run run i'm trying to build\nthis but i'm running out of time and i\nhad another friend that was saying hey\ni'm trying to lose weight\nand i'm just trying to get in the shape\nthat i want to but i just don't have\nenough time once i get done with work\nand i heard this a couple times and i\nwas like huh this is an interesting\nthing that people say i should probably\ntalk about this\nso i was in this conversation with my\nfriend who's trying to lose weight\nand they were saying i don't have time i\ntry to get as much i try to work out as\nmuch as possible but i just run out of\ntime so many days and i was like that's\ninteresting and i said i said to her i\nsaid um\njust just kind of curious um\nyou know you have children you know\nthey're seven and five\num how many days have you run out of\ntime and not fed them and she's like\nwhat i was like how many how many times\nyou know let's take your seven-year-old\nfor instance over the course of the\nseven years that he's been alive what is\nthat uh\njust two twenty\ntwenty three hundred days something\naround there twenty two hundred twenty\nthree hundred days how many days have\nyou been so busy that you you're like i\nran out of time i didn't i didn't feed\nmy son\nshe's like um\nnone\ni was like really\nthat's interesting there's never one day\nwhere you're like i'm too busy i can't\nfeed my son and she's like no that'd be\nridiculous and i was like oh\nso what you're telling me\nis that\nfeeding your son is a priority for you\nshe's like absolutely i said you will\nonly succeed at losing weight\nwhen you put losing weight and working\nout and eating healthy as a priority for\nyou i'm not saying that that going to\nthe gym is as important as feeding your\nson but what i'm saying is in your brain\nit needs to be as important you would\nnever go to sleep with your son not\nbeing fed\nyou should never go to sleep without the\nworkout if that's what you said you were\ngoing to do you don't run out of time\nyou just don't plan your time\nefficiently to make sure that the action\nis taken to create the body that you\nwant to create the life that you want to\ncreate the business that you want so the\nproblem is it's not that you don't have\ntime for the action is that you're\nmaking up excuses as to why you're too\nbusy to actually take that action\nshe was like oh\nthat makes so much sense\nworking out hasn't been a priority for\nme\nand i was like i know there are some\npeople that working out is a priority\nand they do have two kids exactly like\nyou do\nwhat's the difference their mindset\naround the priorities i'm not saying\ndon't feed your kids that's the exact\nopposite of what i'm saying\ni'm not saying don't do the laundry i'm\nnot saying don't clean the house i'm not\nsaying don't run your business i'm not\nsaying any of those things\nwhat i'm saying is is that the most\nimportant actions the needle-moving\nactions in your life need to be as much\nof a priority as feeding your children\nfeed your children of course but also\nget your ass to the gym\nfeed your children of course if you\ndon't have children you have a dog you\nhave a cat you have a bird feed your\nanimal or feed your child whatever you\nmight have\nand go to the gym\nbuild your business and feed your child\ndo all of those things don't go to bed\nuntil the action is done same way that\nyou never go to bed and not feed your\nchildren is exactly the same way that\nyou should never go to bed and not have\nthat action done and so i asked her that\nquestion\nand the reason why it was it's a it's\nsuper super important to think this is\nbecause the reason why you need to have\nthis reprioritization in your mind\nis because of the fact that if you don't\nyou're not going to do what needs to be\ndone but it needs to be that that\nimportant for you so we could all make\nto-do lists right now that could be 75\nthings long\nbut are those things going to be all\nneeded moving activities in your life\nabsolutely not so how can we look at the\nthings that we know are needle moving\nand prioritize those over everything\nelse and it's very simple\nyou plan the life that you want you\nfigure out what actions need to be taken\nand then you prioritize those actions\nover everything else you don't go to bed\nuntil they're done that's how committed\nyou need to be to your goals i do not go\nto bed until x is done i don't go to bed\nuntil my workout is done i don't go to\nbed until i make\na hundred cold calls i don't go to bed\nuntil i have\nyou know\neating the food that i need to i don't\ngo to bed if if i uh i don't go to bed\nif i haven't told my spouse i love them\nwhatever it is you're trying i don't go\nto bed unless i've meditated for the day\nwhatever it is that you're trying to\ncreate you need to prioritize those\ngoals and they need to be that important\nto you and you don't go to bed until\nthey're done and it comes down to this\nsimple phrase if it's important to you\nyou'll find a way\nif it's not you'll find an excuse\nhow many people\nwe've seen movies on it how many people\nhave run out of money they've been on\nthe streets they haven't had whatever it\nis that they need\nbut they've done what needs to be done\nin order to feed their children maybe\nthey steal\nmaybe they borrow some stuff maybe they\nfigure out a way to make money because\nthey need to pay their kids if it's they\nneed to pay because they need to feed\ntheir kids if it's important to you\nyou'll find a way if it's not you'll\nfind an excuse you'll never run out of\ntime to feed your children it's a\npriority it gets done\nno matter what and that's the mindset\nthat you have around it as a parent i'm\ngoing to feed them i'm going to take\ncare of them what is supposed to be done\nwill be done that's what your life is\nbuilt off of well can it also be built\noff of can can the the things that are\nmost important that move them needle\nalso be built the same way in your mind\nand so i want to ask you this question\nlet's take the next three months of your\nlife let's think about the most\nimportant activity over the next three\nmonths in your life\ndo you prioritize it\njust ask yourself and let's be honest\ndo you prioritize it is it a priority\nfor you how many times have you tried\nthat thing and given up let's say weight\nloss this thing how many times you tried\nlosing weight but you've given up how\nmany times have you tried losing weight\nyou've given them how many diets have\nyou tried but then you gave up how many\ntimes you said today's this is the year\nthis is my year to get in shape my new\nyear's resolution is i'm going to lose\nweight and then you've freaking given up\non it think about that for a second\nwhat do you do on a daily basis though\nthat's not a priority and so here's what\nwe're going to do we're going to figure\nout number one what is your priority\nwrite that down with pen and paper if\nyou have your pen and paper what is your\npriority over the next three months that\nis a needle-moving activity i don't need\nyou to figure out a hundred different\nthings i just need to figure out one for\nright now what is that one thing that is\na needle-moving activity for you\nwrite it down with pen and paper now i\nwant you to think about all of the\nthings that you do on a daily basis that\nare not priorities for you\nthink about it doing the laundry\nyou know\nmaybe it's uh doing the dishes\nwatching tv\nscrolling on instagram think of every\nsingle action that you take that is not\na priority for you and then ask yourself\na couple questions are there any of\nthese things that could be outsourced\nlike is it possible that these things\ncan be outsourced like for instance i\nhave a lawn i don't mow my lawn i did at\none point mow my lawn but i stopped why\nbecause it takes a couple hours a couple\ntimes it takes a couple hours of the\ncourse of a month i could use those\nhours doing something to that is the\npriority for me\nnow some of you are like yeah but i\ndon't have the money to pay for someone\nto mow my lawn okay\nwell is there anything else that could\nbe outsourced and if you were to\noutsource mowing your lawn and use those\nlet's call it four hours over the course\nof a month could you make more than that\nfor out that more than the money that\nyou pay the person\nto be able to actually pay them so that\nyou can go and do the thing that is the\npriority for you is there stuff that\ncould be outsourced you know if we're\ntalking about cleaning the house is it\npossible for you to have someone clean\nonce a month that would at least help\nhave them come every couple weeks is\nthere a way to outsource some of the\nthings that are not a priority for you\nthat's what i want to do so you're going\nto make a list of all the things that\nyou do on a daily basis and add to this\nlist throughout the day as you do things\noh i do this oh i do this oh i do this\noh i do this that are all the things\nthat are not a priority and start to ask\nyourself is it possible for me to\noutsource these is it possible that you\ncan ask someone that you live with to\nhelp with these things you know maybe\nmaybe it's the month you live with maybe\nyou can assign one of your children to\ndo the laundry for the month maybe\nbecause i have one of your children to\ndo the dishes for the month is it\npossible for you to assign somebody that\nyou live with some of these tasks what\nabout work is it possible for you to\nassign somebody that you work with to do\nsome of the tasks that you're doing that\nyou don't need to do that are not a\npriority for you i know people when they\nget promoted\nsome people will completely change the\nthings they do some people will do do\nthe job that they don't need to be doing\nbecause they don't trust other people to\ndo it so if you're at work and you're\ndoing things that are not a priority for\nyou to move the needle can you outsource\nthat someone else is there someone else\nthat can help you and then when you look\nat the list of things what are those\nthings that you actually need to stop\ndoing\nright so if you're like oh i don't have\nenough time but then you're watching\nnetflix for an hour every single night\nwhere did that freaking time come from\nto say that you don't have time\nbut you have a netflix subscription then\nyou watch it that's bullsh you're lying\nto yourself you can keep lying to\nyourself if you want\nbut the numbers don't lie and if the the\nsuccess in your business or your on the\nscale or whatever it is they don't lie\nand so could you prioritize your life\ndifferently and say oh you know what\nyeah maybe over the next three months i\nwon't watch any netflix i'll prioritize\nthis one thing and just go for this one\nthing what would your life look like if\nyou decided to switch some things around\nand actually start doing that and then\nyou start asking yourself am i being\nbusy or am i being productive so this is\nimportant to think about we're busy all\nday long we all are because we're all\ndoing something even if we're doing\nnothing we're still doing something even\nif we're just sitting around watching\nnetflix we're still watching netflix\neven if we're just sitting on the couch\nscrolling on instagram we're still on\ninstagram we're still doing something\neven more doing nothing even if we're\njust staring at the ceiling and\nbreathing we're still just breathing\nright we're doing something always we're\nall so busy but the question is are you\nbusy\nor are you productive\nhave you ever had a day\nwhere you're just\nyou're like a chicken with your head cut\noff you're doing things you're doing\nthings you're doing things you're doing\nthings and then you get home or you lay\nyour head down and you're like man i was\nbusy all day and i feel like i got\nnothing done have you ever had one of\nthose days before where you're just so\ndamn busy but for some reason you feel\nlike you got nothing done well do you\nwanna know why that is because you were\nbusy you weren't productive and so if\nyou feel like you're busy all day and\nyou're not moving the needle it's\nbecause you're not working on the things\nthat are gonna that are priorities for\nyou should be priorities for you\nthat are gonna move the needle and so\nsimple tip if you've been listening for\nlong enough that'll just help you\nconquer this real quickly it's the\nsimplest thing i tell people all the\ntime and when they actually start using\nit they're like this is so simple and it\nalso helps so much you make your to-do\nlist every single morning\nyou go through and you look at it you\nsay okay\nwhat is number one what is number two\nand what is number three that are the\nnumber one number two number three most\nneedle moving activities that i put down\non this list you circle them okay that's\nnumber one okay that's number two okay\nthat's number three and then what you do\nis you take a three by five card\nyou write down number one you write down\nnumber two you write number three and\nyou put in your back pocket and you\ndon't go to bed\nuntil all three of those things are done\nthat's it it's that simple\nand that is how you have a productive\ndays because when you feel like you're\nbusy\nbut not productive it's because you're\nnot checking off the boxes of things\nthat are important you're just checking\noff your excuse me you're just checking\noff your to-do list and that's not going\nto do anything for you just checking off\nto-do lists and i know so many people\nbecause i say this all the time and\npeople always laugh so many people out\nthere\nyou made your to-do list in the morning\nyou wrote it all down you're like cool\noh my god i got my to-do list i've got\n32 things in my to-do list and then you\ngo and do something that's not on your\nto-do list and you come back to your\nto-do list and you write that thing down\non your to-do list and then you cross it\noff so you get that feeling of hey i did\nit\nthat thing was probably not a priority\nfor you\nit's probably not the needle moving\nactivity that you needed to take so when\nyou create your to-do list every single\nmorning and then you figure out number\none number two number three and you put\nthem on a three by five card you say i\ndo not go to bed until this is done i'm\ngoing to focus on these three things and\nthose are the three things that are\ngoing to move the business the my\nrelationship my family my body whatever\nit is you're trying to work towards\nthese are the three needle moving\nactivities that i need to get done today\nand you don't do anything until number\none is done\nthen you don't do anything until number\ntwo is done and then you don't do\nanything until number three is done and\nthen my question to you is do you take\nthose things and you put them into your\nschedule do you stick to a schedule in\nthe first place or you just kind of run\naround the chicken with like a chicken\nwith your head cut off these are not\nlike hey if i get time for it kind of\nthings like i was talking about my\nfriend who's trying to lose weight if i\nget time for it i'll work out if it's\nsomething that's a i get if i get time\nfor it it's not a priority for you and\nyou don't really care you don't think to\nyourself\nyou know well i will feed jonathan if i\nget time to no it's like it's going to\nbe done\nso your priorities should never be a if\ni get time for it kind of thing your\npriorities are i don't care what happens\ni'm going to get it done today and if\nyou do that those are the ways that\nyou're going to move the needles the\nquickest in your life and your business\nand your body and your relationships and\nyour finances and your wealth everything\nis that you figure out what the most\nimportant things are and you crush them\nevery single day no matter what and they\nare just as high as a priority for you\nas everything else is in your life hey\nthanks so much for watching this video\nif you want to learn even more about\nmastered your mind click
