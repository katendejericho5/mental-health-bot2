    "transcript": "what happens you wake up at 45 and\nyou're like what the [ __ ] have i been\ndoing with my life hard work is hard\nbeing broke is hard as well first off i\ndecide what i want second off i either\nget it or i die trying there is no other\noption\ni feel that one of my duties\non this earth is to wake people up from\nthe sleep that they tend to find\nthemselves in by just doing what society\ntells them they're supposed to do and i\nhave been in the rat race for many years\nand i woke up one day and was in a i\nwould say a mild depression hated where\ni was in life even though i was making a\nbunch of money and would be deemed as\nsuccessful for my age\ni wasn't stoked about it i didn't want\nto be there anymore and so i made a plan\nto get myself free of it so if you're\nout there and you feel like you no\nlonger want to be part of the rat race\nthis episode is for you let's dive in\nand talk about how to actually free\nyourself the first thing i want you to\nrealize is this\nif you look at\nsomebody that's fully present right\nlet's say like a one-year-old a\ntwo-year-old a three-year-old they are\nthe most present people in the world\nthey don't worry about the future they\ndon't think about what might be coming\nup down the road obviously they don't\nhave bills to pay on all that stuff\nbut a one two three maybe four year old\nthey are the most present people on this\nplanet but at one time\nsomething has to happen in order for\nthem to be thrown into being i guess you\ncould call i don't want to say even\nawoken they're actually put to sleep in\nthe fact that they are thrown into this\ndream of what we're supposed to do in\nsociety and at some point in time\na\ncarrot is introduced as you could say a\nhypothetical carrot of okay you get into\nkindergarten and now you've got to be a\ngood boy be a good girl make sure you\nget some grades so you can get into\nfirst grade and so you have this carrot\nthat's now presented so if you know the\nstory of the carrot between the donkey\neither either they're motivated by the\nstick which is hitting them with the\nstick or they're motivated by the carrot\nthat's right in front of their face so\nwe're presented a carrot to kind of get\nus out of being present and now we've\ngot to stop thinking about this very\nmoment that we're in and we've got to\nstart thinking about oh first grade i've\ngot to get good grades now so that i can\nget this thing later on down the road\nand then in first grade you've got to be\na good boy and a good girl and you've\ngot to start taking some tests and\nyou've got to get better than everybody\nelse so that you can get into second\ngrade and you want to be first in your\nclass in third grade so you've got to do\nbetter than everybody and it's this this\nconstant there's something else in front\nof me then after you get out of\nelementary school then you got to get\ninto middle school when you're in middle\nschool that's when it starts ramping up\nright but you got to do good in sixth\ngrade and to get into seventh grade in\nseventh grade to get into eighth grade\nand it's a constant carrot that's put in\nfront of us and then when you're in\nmiddle school you better do really well\nso you can get into high school and you\nwant to make sure you get into high\nschool and then when you're in high\nschool every single 9th 10th 11th 12th\ngrade you better do really good so you\ncan get into college then you got to do\nreally good so you can get into a good\ncollege right are you seeing this this\ncarrot that's constantly dangled in\nfront of us at one point in time we have\nthese fully present humans that are\ntaken out of the present moment and told\nto focus on something in the future\nright so then you get into college and\nyou get into a good college because you\ndid really well because you were a good\nboy or good girl then you better do\nreally well in college why because you\nwant to get that dream job and then when\nyou get out of school and you get that\nquote-unquote dream job then you better\ndo really well so you can climb the\ncorporate ladder so you can finally have\nthat\nincome that you want and then what\nhappens you wake up at 45 and you're\nlike what the [ __ ] have i been doing\nwith my life i don't want any of this\nand i'm stressed and i don't like where\ni am and i feel stuck that's why there's\nsomething called a midlife crisis many\npeople have mid-life crisis because they\nwake up at some point in time\nand realize what the hell have i been\ndoing like this carrot that i've been\nfollowing i didn't even know was in\nfront of me i didn't even know that's\nwhat i needed to do i didn't even know\nthat's what i was following i was being\ntold what to do at all points in time\ni've got to get ahead i've got to climb\nthe ladder i've got to get ahead i've\ngot to climb the ladder i've got to get\nahead i've got to climb the ladder and\npeople wake up and they're like this\nisn't what i want but the problem is\nwe've been sold a lie\nyou've been sold a lie i've been sold a\nlot we've all been sold a lie and the\nlie is you know you're supposed to work\nso that you can get something in a\npresent\nto get out of this present moment so\nthat we can possibly have a better\nfuture and then you get to that future\nand now you have another future you've\ngot to work for and then you get to that\nfuture and then you have another future\nthat you have to work for no wonder why\npeople are so stressed is because they\ncan't enjoy this one present moment\nwhere nothing is wrong everything is\nbeautiful everything is amazing the\npresent moment that we're all in no\nmatter what life circumstances you're\nstuck in right now everything is\nbeautiful right now but we're told it's\nnot good enough because there is a\npotential better future that we always\nhave to be working for and so where\npeople are stressed and they're anxious\nand they're depressed because they're\nconstantly thinking about how this\nmoment sucks compared to what the next\nmoment could be or what i could have or\nthe car or the job or the family and\nthen what happens is people wake up and\nthen the issue is they can't get out of\nit they don't think they feel like\nthey're stuck\nthey end up getting married they end up\ngetting a mortgage\nthey ended up having a couple kids\nthey've got cars they've got to pay for\nthey've got car insurance they've got to\npay for they've got bills they've got\neverything that has to be the lights the\nelectricity the air conditioning the the\nwater in the house everything has to be\npaid for and they feel stuck like\nthey've literally dug themselves into a\nhole that they don't know how to get out\nof no wonder why people are so stressed\nis because they're stuck in a reality\nthat they do not want yeah that sounds\nlike it sucks\nso what do you do well and with the\nfeeling of being stuck the way i like to\nto talk about the rat race kevin o'leary\nthe guy from the shark tank they call\nhim mr wonderful and he calls himself mr\nwonderful on the shark tank a quote that\ni love he says salary is a drug that\nthey give you to forget your dreams\nit's a good one right your salary is a\ndrug that's given to you to forget your\ndreams to forget about what it is that\nyou truly want to do but the beautiful\nthing about it is that no matter where\nyou are no matter how stuck you are or\nhow stuck you might feel like you are is\na better way of putting it you can\nalways pull yourself out of it you can\nalways remove yourself from the rat race\nat any point in time if that's what you\nwant to do or you can stay in the rat\nrace but get a job that you actually\nenjoy\nmaybe it pays a little bit less\nwould it be better to love your life\nversus hitting your life and make a ten\nthousand dollars less a year i don't\nknow i would think that it probably\nwould be so if you're if you feel like\nyou're stuck realize you're not stuck\nyou're not a tree you can always make a\nmove now what stresses people out is\nthey think that oh my gosh i'm in this\njob i've come to realize that i don't\nwant to be here i need to get out as\nsoon as possible and they think they\nneed to get out in like a week or two\nweeks or a month and in reality if you\nhave a family if you have kids if you\nhave bills to pay you're not going to be\nable to leave\nmost of the time in the next week or two\nand so what i always recommend to people\nif you want to remove yourself from this\nbullsh rat race that we're sold into as\nif we're that's what's going to truly\nmake us happy is to come up with a\ntransition plan try to figure out how\nyou can get out of the position that\nyou're in in the next two to three years\nnow automatically if i say that to you\nguys those of you guys who are thinking\noh my gosh i leave a guy leave got to\nleave do you feel a little bit more\noh\nokay\ni don't think i could do in the next\nmonth but i think that i could figure\nout a way to get it done in the next two\nyears yeah you definitely can you come\nup with a transition plan that's why\npeople are always stressed because they\ncan't stop moving they can't stop moving\nand they think oh my gosh i've gotta\ni've gotta move immediately i've gotta\nget out of this immediately because\nwe've been sold that that idea of a\nbetter future coming to us later on down\nthe road and then we get to that\nquote-unquote better future that we are\nwaiting for and you're like this future\nisn't great this isn't the future that i\nwanted now i'm stuck here right so if\nyou look ahead to your future\nand say okay if i were to remove myself\nfrom the rat race in two years from\ntoday how would i do it and you start\ncoming up with a plan and i've done this\nwith many of my old one-on-one clients\nwhen i used to do one-on-one coaching i\ndon't do one-on-one coaching work\nbecause i don't have the time to i coach\nin groups when i used to do one-on-one\ncoaching is i would work with people who\nliterally had jobs they were stuck in\ncorporate america they were making 80\n100 150 000 a year good money 60 000 a\nyear sometimes and the idea was how do\nwe build you a business outside of that\nbusiness or outside of your current job\nthat you can start growing over the next\ntwo years because all you really need to\ndo to leave is to be able to first cover\nyour your bills so then what you got to\nthink of is how much are my bills how\nmuch of my bills that i can't move that\ni know i've definitely got is it two\nthousand a month is it three thousand a\nmonth four thousand whatever it is\nthat's the number i've got to get to and\nbe able to cover and able to in order to\nbe able to leave because then when i\nleave and i get 40 or 50 hours of my\nlife back that's when my business can\nreally start to explode you have to\nrealize that you can't enjoy\na future moment\npresently if you can't learn to enjoy\nthis present moment right now so if\nyou're constantly thinking oh my gosh\ni've gotta\ni've gotta do this i've gotta get the\nnew job i've gotta create another\nbusiness first off before you ever make\nany changes any transition plans all of\nthat stuff what you have to do\nabsolutely have to do is learn to\nappreciate and love and be grateful in\nthis present moment because that's\nwhat's really going to help you so don't\nthink oh my gosh i hate my job i've got\nto you know figure it out over the next\ntwo years and you go into your job the\nnext two years because you haven't\ntransitioned yet and you hate every\nsingle moment of it no you can still be\ngrateful you can be grateful for a job\nthat you hate\nit might take a little bit of work but\nit's possible oh my gosh what can be\ngrateful for i'm able to you know pay\nfeed my children maybe put clothes on\ntheir back i'm able to have a car that i\nenjoy whatever it is there's ways to be\ngrateful in every single thing that you\ndo so be grateful while you are\ntransitioning out of this current\nposition which is important if you're\nthinking about you know maybe i should\nleave maybe i should and i'm not really\nsure what i should do what i want to ask\nyou is this if you were to fast forward\n10 years if you were to stay where you\ncurrently are\nmaybe get a promotion or two and fast\nforward 10 years 10 years from today is\nthat where you want to be\njust think about that for a second for\nme when i decided to leave corporate\ni was\njust sick of working for someone else\nand i wasn't passionate about what i did\ni made great money but it was just like\nit was soul sucking to me the way i felt\ni was thinking okay if i fast forward\n10 years from today\ni'd probably be making 250 300 000 a\nyear i'd probably have a nice\nhouse i'd probably have a nice office\ni'd be spending 50 60 hours of my life\nunder fluorescent lights\nin a button-down shirt when i don't even\nlike dressing up and i started looking\nat it and i was like me in the corporate\nworld if i'm you know\n45 years old in a leather chair wearing\na button down\ntelling people what to do\nand spending 60 hours under fluorescent\nlights\nmaking a couple hundred grand a year\nthat's\nit doesn't sound exciting to me i'm not\nlike oh yeah that's a that's a hell yeah\nfor me and i always say in life if it's\nnot a yes it's automatically a no so if\nmy 10 years from today fast forward if\nyou're 10 years from today and whatever\njob you have if you fast forward and put\n10 years in work and see where you are\nif it's not a yes for you it's a you\nknow that means that you need to get out\nof it and try to figure out some way to\nmove so let's talk about how to escape\nthis rat race that we're talking about\nif you're being woken up if you're\nsitting there going yeah this is\ndefinitely resonating i definitely feel\nthis what's next if you don't want to be\nthere you want to think about what you\nwant to be doing\nit's okay to move to another job like\nyou don't have to run a million dollar\nbusiness so if you're out there\nyou can switch from one job that you\ndon't enjoy to one job that you do enjoy\nmaybe it pays you a say maybe it pays\nyou less maybe pitch more i don't know\nwhat it is\nbut i would rather you go and spend the\nmajority of your waking hours which is\nwhat we do working is the thing that we\ndo the majority of waking hours i'd\nrather you enjoy\nthe majority of your waking hours versus\nnot enjoy the majority of your waking\nhours and not torture yourself to go\nthere as i said i recommend creating a\ntwo year transition plan right if you\nfast forward two years what do we what\ndo you want to be doing how do you want\nto be doing it how much money do you\nwant to be making all of that stuff so\nstep number one i'm gonna give you four\ndifferent steps okay step number one is\nyou have to decide\nwhat it is that you actually want so a\nlot of times people don't know what they\nwant but they know what they don't want\nand they don't want to be where they\ncurrently are they don't want to stay in\nthis position they don't want to be in\nthis position 10 years from today so\nnumber one is you got to decide what it\nis that you want if you don't know what\nit is that you want the first question\nis how do you want to feel so when you\nwake up and you're about to go to work\nwhatever that work is either working for\nsomeone else or working for yourself how\ndo you want to feel\nthat's the first place to start do you\nwant to feel free do you want to feel\nhappy do you want to be excited to wake\nup do you want to be grateful make a\nlist of everything that you want to feel\nwhen you wake up in the morning\nfive years from today how do you want to\nfeel start there and then you start\nasking yourself what makes me feel that\nway\nhow could i create a job or move into a\njob that would make me feel that way you\nknow i'd much rather you work\nif you're making 60 grand a year right\nnow\nand you're working as an accountant and\nyou don't want to be there in 10 years\ni'd much rather you work you know if\nyou're if you love plants\nto work at a plant store you know\nworking full-time hourly and make 40 45\ngrand a year because at least you're\ngoing to be happier and here's the crazy\nthing about it i'm going to talk about\ndowngrading if it's necessary sure you\ncan downgrade if necessary but what's\nreally crazy is that once you actually\nstep into\nthis flow of doing what it is that you\nwant it's kind of like the universe\ncomes in your side and you start making\nmore money but let's just say that that\ndoesn't happen you start making less\nwouldn't it be better for your children\nto see a parent that's not exhausted\nevery single time they come home that\ndoesn't have a short temper every single\ntime they come home because they've been\npushed around at this job as an account\nthat they don't want to be anymore\nand they can see something that they\nlove doing\nwould it be better for your children to\nbe around that\ni would say so it's not worth an extra\n10 000 a year plus take you know 30\npercent out of it for taxes 7 000 a year\njust to be able to you know\nbuy a couple extra pair of shoes every\nsingle year drive a little bit nicer car\nso think about that you know decide what\nit is that you want decide how you want\nto feel and then start to figure out\nwhat it is that would make you feel that\nway so that's step number one step\nnumber two is to get on the old powerful\ngoogle\nand start actually researching some\nstuff of how to make money the way that\ni learned how to make money online is\nliterally becoming obsessed\nby about how to make money online i went\nonline i started googling it i went into\nyoutube i went to conferences i started\ngoing to networking events i started\ngoing to meetups just to meet people\nthat are like that but it all came\nbecause first off i started on google\nand said what is it that i want to\nfigure out i know how i want to feel i\ndon't know how i'm going to feel this\nway let me go ahead and google it and so\nwhat you do is you google it and then\nyou just try some of those things try\nnew things see what it is that you you\nwant to do that's step number two step\nnumber three is to connect with other\npeople in that industry so if you decide\nthat you want to be in the plant\nindustry like i'm just saying\nhow can you go to other conferences\ni'm sure there's plant conferences i\nguarantee that if you google plant\nconferences united states 2022 or 2021\nyou're going to come up with some\nthere's conferences for literally\neverything so start connecting with\nother people are there networking groups\nin your area are there places you can go\nto stores you can go to other you know\nnurseries for plants that you can go to\nand actually see what they're doing\naround there just start being around\nother people who are in that industry it\nmakes transitioning into that industry a\nlot easier when you start to know people\nso conferences\nyoutube\ngoogle\nnetworking events\nmeetups stores whatever it is that you\nwant to do figure it out that's stuff\nnumber three connect with other people\nin the industry step number four start\nmaking a plan all right now i've decided\nhow i want to feel i've decided what i\nwant to do i've come up with a little\nbit of plan on how to do it i've met\nsome people who are doing it now i'm\ngoing to sit down and i'm going to write\nmyself a detailed plan of the date that\ni'm going to be leaving my job this is\nwhat i had every one of my clients do\nwhen they used to do this with them i\nneed a definite date you're leaving that\njob no matter what hits the fan you get\nhit by a truck you're leaving\naugust 14 2023 whatever it is for you\nwhat is the date that you're gonna be\nleaving and now that you've figured out\na date start figuring out a plan okay\nyou know on the weekends i'm gonna do\nthis three times a week i'm gonna do\nthis and you start coming up with a plan\nto actually start transitioning i need\nto make four thousand dollars a month in\norder to be able to cover my bills and\nso this is how i'm going to come up with\nfour thousand dollars a month and start\ncoming up with a plan because then when\nyou see this plan\nyou realize it's not as hard as you\nthought it was because when it's in your\nhead the the thinking and the plan is in\nyour head it's very abstract it's hard\nto come up with the exact way to do it\nwhen you write it down you can see it on\npaper and you come up with a plan you go\nyou know what i can do this\nand i'm going to do this so\nultimately those are the four steps to\nremove yourself from the rat race i want\nyou to realize this don't live your life\nif you're currently in this position\nwhere you this this episode woke you up\nin some sort of way i've had so many\npeople i mean so many people message me\nand tell me that i've told them you know\ni helped them quit their job in some\nsort of way i never met them but somehow\ni quit them helped to quit their job in\nsome sort of way i've helped so many\npeople do this don't live the rest of\nyour life working for someone that you\ndon't want to work for doing something\nthat you don't want to do you spend the\nmajority of your waking hours doing that\nstart coming up with a plan and start\nextracting yourself from the rat race\nand this is a four-step plan of how to\ndo it yesterday i read a quote that hit\nme really hard and the quote was some\npeople will go broke for their kids but\nthey won't get rich for them\ni was like damn\nthat one hits hard and the reason is\nbecause i've coached thousands of\nparents\nand uh one thing that i notice with them\nactually there's quite a few things that\ni noticed with them\nbut this hits so hard because a lot of\nparents i feel are actually like this\nand i'm gonna go over the different you\nknow the different aspects of this that\nreally hit home with me as a couple\ndifferent aspects but even if you don't\nhave kids right now this still is going\nto help you because we're going to go\nover some deep psychological\nthings in today's podcast so there's a\ncouple of reasons why it hit me so hard\nnumber one so many people are locked\ninto their job because they fear not\nbeing able to provide for their family\nright so they don't get the full\nfinancial success they possibly could\nand so they're staying broke because\nthey're afraid that if they lost their\njob or if they weren't able to provide\nfor their family then you know it would\nhit the fan and so that's the first\nthing that that hits home with me the\nsecond thing is that some people love\ntheir children so much they'll spend\ntheir last dollar to get them whatever\nthey want and the third reason why is\nbecause people don't realize\nwhat their children are missing out on\nby simply them not living up to their\ntrue potential i'm not talking about\nyour kids living up true true potential\ni'm talking about you living up to your\ntrue potential so we're going to go\nthrough every one of these and here's\nthe thing that i'll say\ni've never met a parent that doesn't\nwant their children's life to be better\nthan theirs was\never not once you know parents the most\ngiving time i ever see somebody\nin their life is when they're talking\nabout their kids when they're working\nwith their kids when they're trying to\nhelp their kids in some sort of way so\neverybody first off the way i want to\nstart wants their children's lives to be\nbetter than that\nbut one thing that really holds a lot of\npeople back is they think i want to make\na lot of money and in order to make a\nlot of money i'm going to have to put a\nlot of time into it and time\nequals money to them\nmore money equals more time more time in\nmy business means less time with my\nchildren and nothing can be further from\nthe truth\nnow for some of you guys you're like\nthat's that's so foreign to me i don't\neven it's not even i'm not even\ncomprehending that right now but we'll\ndive into that as i go through it\nit's not true\nthat more money means less time with\nyour children\nthat's the first hang up some of you\nguys that our parents are out there i'm\ncompletely shifting up the foundation of\nyour life and you're in your mindsets\nbecause you think hold on but if i want\nto make more money i have to have less\ntime with my children and one of the\nmain reasons why you're not succeeding\nand what it is that you want to succeed\nin is because you think that in order to\nmake more money you're going to spend\nless time with your kids and if you\nspend less time with your kids you're\nnot going to be able to raise the way\nthat you want and so you're like you\nknow what i'll make less money because i\nlove my children that much when in\nreality\nit might be a better thing for you to\nmake more money because that would\nactually help your children out more and\ni'll tell you why we're going to dive\ninto it but but basically what it comes\ndown to is a poverty mindset\ni can tell you this because i've worked\nthrough my own poverty mindset and still\nto this day continue to work at this\npoverty mindset because took 25 30 years\nto build this poverty mindset in my head\nso now i'm working to try to unravel it\nand\ntime does not equal money money does not\nequal time i'm going to say that first\noff so\nfirst thing we're going to dive into is\nmore money does not equal less time with\nyour kids\nand if you set up your business\nif you want to set up a business or if\nyou have a business and you think\nokay if in order for me to have more\nmoney i need to work more you can do\nthat if you want you can set your\nbusiness up that way or you don't have\nto that's completely up to you\nmore money does not equal more time\nyou know if you own a business more\nmoney if you're smart means hire more\npeople hire more people means more free\ntime\nor more time to work on the things that\nyou want to so whether you have children\nand you start a successful business and\nit starts to get more successful you can\nbring people on to then do more of your\nwork for you which means more money\nequals more people which actually means\nmore free time that's foreign for a lot\nof people i definitely understand that\nyou know for me in my business we have\n12 employees in my business\ni can literally go and do all of my\nemployees work every single day but i\nwould have absolutely no time to sleep\nwho wants that life i would be working\n24 hours a day every single day the\npoint of hiring people and hiring\namazing people is so that they come in\nand help you they they're really good at\nwhat they do and they have their own\npart of the business that they basically\nin their mind own in your business which\nallows you to take time to do what you\ntruly want to do to whether that's free\ntime with your kids or whether that's i\ndon't have any kids and i just want to\nreally focus on\nyou know for me i don't have any kids\nbut what i really want to focus on is\njust coaching people you know i can have\na bunch of different coaching courses\nand that's what i want to take my time\ndoing or creating content like i'm doing\nright now creating a video for youtube\nand facebook and instagram which is also\ngoing to be a podcast episode so for me\nit's one of two things that i want to\nspend my time doing and the reason why i\nhire people because i want to create\ncontent and i want to coach people\nif you have kids maybe you just want to\nspend more time with your kids so when\nyour business is more successful\nit actually means more time with your\nkids\nand so\nyou know\ni work probably 40 50 hours on average\nper week but\ni've worked 110 hours before in old\nbusinesses\nand run them into the ground but i work\nabout 40 50 hours a week now and our\nbusiness is doing multiple seven figures\nbecause we have incredible people in\nplace that allow that to happen\ni hire them because they get to stay in\ntheir zone of genius they're incredible\nwhat they do\nand then i get to stay in my zone of\ngenius which is coaching and creating\ncontent and everybody does what they're\nreally good at so\nmore time or more money does not have to\nequal more time in your business\nthe first thing that i wanted to dive\ninto around that is so many people are\nlocked into their job mentally because\nthey fear not being able to provide for\ntheir family\ni'm gonna let that one sink in because i\nknow a lot of people listening to this\nare not doing what you truly want to do\nbecause you are afraid you won't be able\nto pay their bills\nand i get it i completely understand\nwhere you're coming from\ni understand that fear\npeople work jobs that they hate\nfor their families\nbut who said it has to be that way even\nif you don't start your own business\nwhat if you just had a job that you\nloved\nand you still were able to provide for\nyour family what would that look like\nfor some people that idea is so foreign\nbecause they've hated their job for so\nlong and they just feel like that's the\nway that it is\nand it's a novel idea\nand it's it's super selfless to do\nsomething that you hate doing every\nsingle day\nin order to do it for somebody else to\nprovide for people\nbut who says that it has to be that way\nwhat if you loved what you did and you\nstill provide it for your children\nwhether that's your own business or\nwhether it's working for somebody else\nwhat would that look like\nis that a paradigm shift for you is that\nhard for you to even accept because\nyou've always thought that you have to\nhate your job maybe you saw your parents\nhate their job\nin order to provide for you and so now\nyour working job that you hate in order\nto provide for your children what would\nit look like for you to work a job that\nyou absolutely love\nwhat would that look like let's say you\nmake sixty thousand dollars a year now\nworking a job that you hate what if you\ngot a job that paid you fifty thousand\ndollars a year but you loved it what\nwould that look like\nyou know it's an extra ten thousand\ndollars difference in income i\nunderstand that but could you still live\noff of the income if you made 10 000\nless maybe\nand if you did would you show up at home\na better person if you loved your job\nthan if you hated your job\nwould you show up a better person for\nyour kids a better father a better\nmother\nfor your children if you loved your job\nand didn't hate it\nor at least enjoyed it maybe not even\nlove it if you just enjoyed it instead\nof hating it what would that be like\nyou know so many we live in this society\nand we see people that are preaching\nhustle and preaching the struggle you\ngotta hustle you gotta stroke you gotta\nhustle you gotta struggle that sounds\nterrible\nwho wants to succeed by struggling your\nway to success that sounds like it sucks\ni know about you but i don't want to do\nthat but we think that that's what it\ntakes because that's all we see people\ntalking about people love to brag about\nthe hustle they love to brag about the\nstruggle you got to work your ass off\nsure you definitely have to work hard i\nwon't say that you don't have to work\nhard but it doesn't mean that you can't\nalso have time with your family\nsuccessful business does not mean no\ntime for family that's something that\nyou have to realize it sounds terrible\nmost successful people this is a funny\nthing\nwe look at it we think oh my gosh in\norder to to grow a successful business i\nhave to basically hate my life every\nsingle day no you don't\nmost people who are successful love what\nthey do\nand the reason why they're so successful\nis because\nthey love what they do and they don't\nmind doing it and so they sometimes\naccidentally work a little bit harder\nand maybe they do go out of balance and\nwork 80 hours a week for a month and\nthen they go way out of balance the\nother way and then they go down to 30\nhours a week because they work so hard\nfor that month\nbut they love what they do so they don't\nsee any difference between them it's\nliterally like their business is a part\nof them it's like their arm\nyou know what would it look like for you\nto love what you do\nthat's what i want you to think of what\nif\nyou could make money doing something\nthat you love i want you to think about\nthat because for some people that idea\nis so foreign it's something i want you\nto ponder on\nhey if you're enjoying this video do me\na favor and hit that like button down\nbelow it helps with the youtube\nalgorithm so that more people can see\nthis message because it helps us get it\nout organically so hit that like button\nand i appreciate you\nthe next thing is some people will spend\ntheir last dollar for their children\nwhich is also a beautiful thing it's a\nnovel idea\nbut what if you didn't have to spend\nyour last dollar\nwhat if you didn't have to spend your\nlast what if you had enough money\nto buy your children what they wanted\nwhat would it be like\nfor your children to say dad i want this\nand you went okay\nno questions asked don't even have to\nask how much it is what would it be like\nfor your children to say mom i want this\nnew playstation\ni don't even know what number\nplaystation five seven six twelve i\ndon't know a playstation number one mom\ni want playstation 12 and you're like\nall right go buy it\nnot how much does it cost\nwhat would it look like for you to just\nbe like okay\nwe're gonna go get it\nwhat would that feel like to know that\nyou built a life to say [ __ ] it let's go\nget it\nhow different would that make you feel\nhow would you feel about yourself how\nwould you feel about your family how\nwould you feel about your own success if\nyou were the person that created that\nyou don't have to have an answer i'm\njust asking these questions to try to\nshift up the foundation for what you\nactually think is real because believe\nme i lived in a poverty mindset for a\nreally long time the idea of go ahead\nand get it was foreign to me for the\nlongest time\nwhat if you could live your life going\nall right son go ahead and get it all\nright daughter go ahead and get it i\ndon't even care how much it is you know\nmaybe they turned 16 years old and\nyou're like i'm going to buy them a car\nwhat would that feel like not oh my gosh\nthey're about to turn 16. i don't know\nhow i'm gonna afford a car what if it\nwas just like okay go ahead and get it\nwhat would that feel like\ncan you lock your brain into that\nfeeling and go i want that feeling in\nreal life\ni want to know what that feeling feels\nlike what would that look like for you\nwhat would it look like for your kids to\nsay that they wanted something and you\nsaid let's go get it\nthat's all i want you to think about\ninstead of having a struggle\nand just pay the bills and just get by\nwhat would it look like on the other\nside of that to think i could get my\nkids whatever it is they want just\nsomething to dive into that i want you\nto kind of think about\nand then the next thing\nis people don't realize\nwhat their children are missing out on\nby them not making more money\nhere's a big thing\npeople\nhave children\nthat then and once again the work jobs\nthat they hate in order to provide for a\nfamily and that is\nfreaking selfless and amazing\nbut what if you were able to make even\nmore money and be able to provide for\nyour family at a really high level\nand then you could travel to wherever\nyou want to what would your children's\nlife look like\nif you could travel anywhere in the\nworld\ni remember the when i was a kid i\nremember being in like third grade\nthird grade was the very first time that\ni ever saw a picture of the coliseum in\nrome\nand i remember reading about it and\nlearning about it and being like that's\nincredible that thing is 2 000 years and\ni was blown away\nand i was like if i could just go see\nthat thing one time in my life it would\nbe amazing all i wanted to do was see\nthe coliseum\nimagine if your children felt the same\nway and you went yeah let's go ahead and\nhop on a plane next week and we're going\nto go to rome and see it what would that\nbe like for your children to not look at\nit in a book to not see it on the tv but\nto go and experience it to experience\nitaly to experience rum to experience\nthe food to experience the people to\nhear the languages to see all the\ndifferent types of people that go to\nthat place how much more rich would\ntheir life be\ni'm not talking rich in money rich in\nexperiences would their life be\nif you could do that for them\njust\nsit on that for a little while just\nthink about it\nthink about what that would be like\nit's possible everything is possible\neverything is possible you just have to\nmake it possible think about what the\ntravel would be like think about what\nthe safety could be like right\nif you don't have much money right now\nyou might not live in the best part of\ntown\nhow much more safe could your children\nbe if you're in a better part of town i\nremember i had a coaching client not too\nlong ago and we were speaking and his\nbiggest fear was that his son would be\nshot by the time he was 13 years old\nbecause he lived in such a bad part of\ntown his main job was to get his main\ngoal in life was to make a hundred\nthousand dollars so he could put a down\npayment on a house outside of where they\nlive because he wanted his son to be in\na safer place\nwhat would your children's life be like\nif you could provide them more safety\nthink about that for a second and then\nanother thing what would it be like if\nyou could afford to send them to any\nschool\nwhat would their how much different\nwould their life be if you could send\nthem to any school maybe you want to\nsend them to a private school instead of\na public school maybe you want to send\nyou know move to a different part of\ntown that's a better part of town that\nhas better schools so they can get a\nbetter education\nhow much different would their lives be\nif you made more money so you could\nprovide them a better education\nhow much better would their lives be if\nyou fast forward 20 years if you worked\nreally hard right now\nand they were able to get a better\neducation what if they get into college\nthen it doesn't matter what college it\nis you just say you're going you got in\nyou're going don't care how much it is\nwhat would that life look like for you i\nunderstand it might be foreign for you\nright now but it doesn't mean it's\nimpossible it's 100 possible but you\nhave to be the person to first believe\nit and then actually make it possible\nthat's the thing about creating stuff in\nyour life\nso think about how much richer your\nchildren's life would be and i get it i\nget it i get it you've got to provide\nbut what if you were to not quit your\njob today and go do something but if you\nwere to slowly transition over the next\nyear or two years into what is that you\ntruly want to do what is it you're truly\npassionate about what would their life\nlook like how much more rich would their\nlife be an experience if you could\ntravel where you wanted to go if you\ncould move to the part of town and put\nthem in the school that you wanted to if\nyou could say yes to any college that\nthey wanted to go to how much different\nwould their life be if you fast forward\nyou know if you if you were to go in\nthis present moment right now and you\nwere to work your ass off and work hard\nfor a year and maybe go a little bit out\nof balance and working hard for a year\nthen sets up the foundation of whatever\nit is you need to set up which then\nallows you to give you more free time\nthroughout the rest of your life with\nyour children but it also provides more\nincome for you in some sort of way\nwhich then allows you to be able to\ntravel with your children where you want\nto to be able to buy the house that you\nwant to be able to buy them the car that\nyou want to buy them to be able to put\nthem in the school that you want to put\nthem in to be able to pay for whatever\ncollege it is if you were to fast\nforward 20 years from now what would you\nputting in the work and doing what you\nwant to do\ndo for your children's lives\nnot talking about right now i'm talking\nabout over the next 20 years\nwhat would that look like i understand\nyou might be locked in a job right now\nbut what if you were to make a two-year\nplan to transition out of it and to\nstart building your e-commerce business\nstart building amazon business start\nbuilding your coaching business start\nbuilding your real estate business\nwhatever it is\nit doesn't have to be right now but what\nif you were to be able to transition and\nhave i'm gonna have my two-year plan i'm\nhaving my three-year plan a transition\nout of this to finally give my children\nand my family the life that they want\nthink about that\nbecause you either sacrifice now or you\nsacrifice later what sacrifice do you\nwant\nthere's two types of hard\nright like hard work\nto be successful sometimes it does\nrequire some hard work a little bit out\nof balance every once in a while\nyou could either be you know working\nhard\nand put the hard work in there hard work\nis hard\nbeing broke is hard as well\nbut you are the person who gets to\nchoose which hard that it is that you\nwant to choose either it's hard work or\nit happens to be the hard feeling of\nbeing broke because some people go broke\nfor their kids but they won't get rich\nfor them what would your life look like\nif you decided to get rich for your kids\nmy number one key to success is not sexy\nat all and it's probably quite\nunexpected i don't really hear a lot of\npeople talking about this so\num and in reality it might kind of\nsurprise you a little bit my number one\nkey to success here it is\nis patience\nthat's my number one key to success and\ni'm going to explain patience how to be\nmore patient but i'm also going to give\nyou some more steps after the patients\nand leading up to the patients that will\nhelp you succeed as well so there's a\nfew keys there's a few action items and\nthere's a few mindset shifts that need\nto be made in order to take your\npatients\nactualize it and create the success that\nyou want to in your life so when we talk\nabout success\nyou have to look at the world that we\nlive in first right first off before we\neven do that let's talk about what does\nsuccess mean to you right what success\nmeans to you\nmight be completely different actually\nis probably different than every other\nperson's listening to this podcast\nhundreds of thousands of different\nreasons why\nyou want to be successful in what\nsuccess means to you to someone out\nthere success might mean 10 million\ndollars net worth so some of you out\nthere might mean a house on the beach\nsome of you guys out there might need a\nhappy family some of you guys out there\nmight be no more anxiety some of the\nguys out there might be buying your mom\na house\nwhatever success means to you\nyou have to realize\nthat we live in a world of immediate\ngratification if i want food\ni can get food delivered in my house in\nthe next 30 minutes if i want groceries\ni can get groceries delivered to my\nhouse in the next couple hours if i want\nto go somewhere i can have someone come\npick me up and drive me that i've never\nmet before if i want to know something i\ncan google and i can immediately get\nknowledge we live in a world where\neverything is immediate\nexcept for success\nsuccess is not immediate success takes\ntime and a lot of times we think that\nit's very quick because what happens is\npeople just kind of pop up sometimes\nthey're like man\nelon musk for instance he's so\nsuccessful he just like came out of\nnowhere one day and that's the way that\nwe see it oh this actor is massively\nsuccessful we look at this musician oh\nmy gosh she's so massively successful\nshe just came out of nowhere how did she\nbecome so successful so fast what we\ndon't see is we don't see the 10\nto 15 years of hard work\nand knowledge\nand skill building that they have to put\nin in order to get to where they want to\ngo very rarely does somebody decide they\nwant to do something and then a month\nlater they're this massive success it's\nlike you don't just\nplant a seed in the ground and expect\nthat tomorrow it's going to be a massive\ntree\nyou know it's going to take time so what\nif you were to treat your life treat\nyour goals and treat your success the\nsame way that you would if you were just\nwaiting for a treat to grow we just\nplanted trees in my house these little\ntiny little teeny tiny trees they're\nabout a foot tall right\nand they're supposed to grow to 80 feet\nbut we got them because of the fact that\nthey just will make a border around my\nhouse because for my house there's just\nthere's nothing out of it there's just\nnature that goes off my property right\nso we wanted a little bit of privacy\ntrees so i planted these little one foot\ntrees and they've been there for about\nfour months now and they've barely grown\nbut i'm not trying to rush them to grow\nbecause i understand that it's not gonna\ngo from one foot to eighty feet tall in\ni don't know a couple days i'm not gonna\nbe like oh it's been four months what\nthe hell is going on with these trees i\nthink these trees are broken\ni know that it's going to take time so\nwhen we see someone that's a massive\nsuccess it looks like it's a meteoric\nrise but in reality it was a really slow\nburn for them to get to where they are\nfor me\ni don't know if it's just because i'm\nmore of a laid-back person i don't know\nif it's because i was race fishing and\ni'm used to being patient i'm okay with\njust\nwaiting around and doing what needs to\nbe done until eventually i get to the\npoint where i want to go and as i get\nolder\nyou know i'm 35 now i started really\nworking on myself and building my first\nbusiness when i was 19 years old so it's\nbeen 16 years and it's cool because i\ncan see\nall of the little micro decisions that i\nmade\nwhen i was 19 20 21 22 23 years old all\nthese little tiny decisions\nthat got me to where i am now but had i\nnot made those decisions and not stayed\non the path that i was on i wouldn't be\nwhere i am\nand i think it's that way for everybody\nand so one of the biggest things that\nyou can learn along your path of success\nis just to simply be patient you can\nhave the world you just can't have it\nall at once you've got to work towards\nit you know and when you see people\nthat\nare patient\nand just continue to go on the path and\ngo on the path and go on the path put\ntheir head down to work and put their\nhead down put their head down work\neventually\nyou just have this feeling that they're\ngoing to get there because if you can be\npatient if you can decide what you want\nand be patient you're going to get what\nyou want that's the first thing that i\nwant to bring in before you have to be\npatient\nyou have to decide what it is that you\nwant like when you look at your life\nten years from now what do you want\nwhat is the life that you actually want\nbecause if i'm gonna go and i'm gonna\ndrive somewhere before i get in my car\ni've got to know where i want to go\nright otherwise i'm just going to be\ndriving around\nup and down random streets so many\npeople out there live their lives just\nlike they're just driving a car around\nand taking random turns and random turn\nhere and random turn here they don't\nknow where they're going and too many\npeople live their lives as if they're\njust wandering\nthey don't have any idea of what it is\nthat they actually want so before you\ndecide\nanything else before you can be patient\nyou can't just be patient just think\nthat life is going to come to you you\nhave to decide what it is that you want\nso what do you want okay once you've\ndecided what you want\nwhat you have to do is you have to get\nrid of all other options this is\nsomething i remember when i started a\nbusiness with my best friend dean years\nago we started an amazon business and\none of our friends jj asked a question\nhe said hey why are you guys going into\nbusiness with each other like you could\ndo this on your own all this stuff and\ndean's phrase was rob's the most\nresilient person that i know he's\nbasically like a cockroach like when he\ndecides he's going to do it he's just\ngoing to do it there are no other\noptions and that's the way i've always\nlived my life is that first off i decide\nwhat i want second off i either get it\nor i die trying there is no other option\nand if you've listened to my episode a\ncouple months ago on manifestation i\ntalk about this when i decide what it is\nthat i want the opposite of what i want\ndoesn't exist in my reality so i can't\neven think to myself oh well what if\nthis doesn't work because the only thing\nthat exists in my head is this is the\nonly thing so you've got to learn to\nburn the ships you know there's a\nthere's that story of\nwhether it's true or not\nyou know there's debate on whether it's\ntrue or not but whether or not it's true\ndoesn't even matter what matters is the\nstory behind it of the spanish conqueror\nwas coming across and you could tell\nthat while he was coming across hundreds\nof years ago he could notice that his\nhis men weren't really in it\nthey're kind of uh\nthinking about turning back and so when\nthey landed they were in wooden boats\nwhen they landed\nin the americas he said all right\neverybody we're going to burn the ships\nhe's like they're all like wait what do\nyou mean what are we going to burn the\nships he goes we're going to burn the\nships\nbecause you're not turning back either\nwe succeed in this conquest or we all\ndie here trying that's the way that\nyou've got to be with the life that you\nwant you've got to decide what it is\nthat you want and all other options are\noff the table there is no other plan b\nit's like will smith says there is no\nplan b because it distracts from plan a\nthere should only be a plan a you have\nto make up your mind you have to say\nthis is what i want there is no other\noption it's like the eminem quote right\nsuccess is my only mother an option\nfailure's not that's the way that it's\ngot to be in your head there is nothing\nelse you've got to go for it this is it\nnothing else either i get it or i die\ntrying\nthat's the mindset boom okay\nnow that i know what i want\nnow that i've made that mind set up of i\nam going to get it no matter what this\nis where most people usually stop they\ndon't go much further because then they\ngo i'm all in i'm all in i'm excited\nabout this i'm gonna go\nand then they they go all in and they\nput all of their hard work into\nbuilding a brand new business and then\nthree months later\nthat business is barely doing anything\nand they're like man maybe this isn't\nfor me maybe i made a mistake maybe i\nyou know i'm putting in three months of\nhard work and nothing's happened we've\nbarely made any money in fact we've lost\nmoney over the past three months maybe\ni'm just on the wrong path i know what\nit is i'll switch to another path i'll\nfigure out that other path that i should\ngo down or to be successful because\nclearly this is the wrong one\nand then what they do is they go on that\nother path and they're all in on that\nother path yes we're gonna do it we're\ngonna burn the ships\nand then\nit doesn't work out for three or six\nmonths like damn it this must not be the\nright path either no it's not that you\naren't on the right path\nis this that you have to stop stopping\nas long as you just don't stop you'll\neventually get to where you want to be i\nremember years ago i was watching a an\ninterview with jared leto jared leto is\na\nsuper successful\nactor and he's also a super successful\nmusician so he is in two different\nfields\nthat\nmany millions of people want to be\nsuccessful millions of people want to be\nsome of the best actors in the world\nmillions of people want to be one of the\nbiggest bands in the world he's both\nwell he was uh in an interview and the\nlady was asking him said what do you\nwhat do you what do you think is your\nsuccess like why is it that you're so\nsuccessful\nwhat he said was i realized that most\npeople just don't start\nand as long as i don't as long as i just\nstart i'm already light years ahead of\nother people\nso i just have to start and then all of\nthe people who start\nmost of them give up so as long as i\njust don't give up i'm eventually going\nto beat almost everybody\nand that\nis the key to success is deciding what\nyou want doing it and then going there\nis no other option this is what i'm\ngoing to do so after three months when\nyou don't see success because you\nprobably won't\nyou keep going after six months when you\ndon't see success because you probably\nwon't you keep going after nine months\nafter 12 months after a year after three\nyears after four years it'll start to\nbuild and build and build and build and\nbuild it's like the trees that i planted\nin my backyard before they can grow up\nthey've got to grow their roots down you\nknow you've got to grow\nyour knowledge and your skills and\neverything that's the foundation that\nyou're going to build everything on\nbefore it can grow up it's got to grow\ndown you've got to put your roots down\nyou've got to say this is it\ni don't care what happens either i\nsucceed at this or the rest of my life\ni'm going to go for this so you just\ndon't give up next step\njust get moving\njust keep moving it doesn't matter how\nfast you go\nas long as you're going in the right\ndirection so if i were to get in my car\nright now\ni could drive to dallas and take about\ntwo and a half to three hours to get\nthere but\nif i were to just go on my feet\nand start heading in the direction of\ndallas\ni could walk to dallas\nand the beautiful thing about that\nis that as long as i was heading in the\nright direction\ni'm eventually going to get there it's\ngoing to take longer than it would if i\ntook a car i completely understand that\nbut the thing that i do understand\nis that as long as i'm heading in the\nright direction\nit doesn't matter the speed that i'm\ngoing at i'll eventually get there and\nthat is where the patience comes in i'm\ngonna get there one day\none day i'll be a millionaire one day\ni'll have the life i want one day i'll\nbe able to travel with my family one day\ni'll be able to\nxyz whatever it is that you want one day\ni will have it i just have to make sure\nthat every single morning i'm heading in\nthe right direction if you're heading in\nthe wrong direction don't get me wrong\nyou're not gonna get what you want\nthat's for sure you can't just have hard\nwork\npeople always well hard work i work\nreally hard i said well you can work\nreally hard at digging a hole in my\nbackyard but when you get done i'm just\ngonna have a hole in my backyard\nthere ain't gonna be anything else\naround that it's just a hole so it's\nlike you could work really hard at\nsomething that you don't want to do\nbut working really hard something you\ndon't want to do is not going to give\nyou the life that you want you've got to\nfigure out what it is that you want\nyou've got to work towards it make sure\nthat you're heading on the right path\nand realize that the direction that\nyou're heading in life is more important\nthan the speed that you're going at\nbecause\nyou're eventually going to get there\nand so that's why you've got to stop\nfocusing on the end result stop focusing\non that end result is it good to know\nwhere you're going absolutely you've got\nto know where you're going but don't\nmake that the reason why you're doing it\nlike if you're starting a business\nsimply because you want to be rich\nyou've already lost the game you have to\nenjoy the journey\nyou have to enjoy the growth process of\ngetting better and learning and failing\nand getting better and learning and\ngrowing and failing and getting better\nbecause that\nis what's eventually going to get you\nthere if you're just focused on that end\nresult i promise you this you're\nprobably not going to get there or\nyou're going to really hate your life up\nuntil you finally get there the goal is\nto go what direction am i going in like\ni'm in austin right now if i were to\nwant to go to dallas i'd have to head\nnorth so as long as i wake up every\nsingle morning and before i start\nwalking i look at my my compass and i go\nokay i'm heading north\nall right i'm just going to start\nwalking this way then wake up the next\nmorning i say okay what's my direction\ncompass says i'm heading north okay i'm\njust gonna keep walking this way as long\nas i'm going in the right direction\nnorth eventually i don't know how long\nit takes to
