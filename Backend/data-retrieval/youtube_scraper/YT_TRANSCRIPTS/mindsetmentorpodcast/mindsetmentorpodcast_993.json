    "transcript": "what would your life look like today\nwhat would your mind look like today\nwhat would your body look like today if\nyou never gave up on that thing that you\ngave up on 10 years ago your life would\nbe vastly different but the problem is\nyou gave up on it\ntoday we're going to be talking about\nhow to harness the power of momentum in\nyour life and i think that momentum is\none of the most underrated things like i\ndon't hear a whole lot of people talk\nabout momentum in their life or talk\nabout how success is so much momentum\nand so much\nof harnessing this feeling of momentum\nand i think that it's a big piece of\nlife i think that's a big piece of\nsuccess and that's what we're going to\ndive into today and you know one of the\nthings that i see with a lot of people\ni've coached thousands and thousands of\npeople is that\nmost people get really excited to start\nsomething\nand they're like oh my gosh i'm gonna\nstart this new business\nand they get excited and they make like\na business plan and they get some\nsamples and they make an idea of what\nthey're gonna do and they start doing it\nand they don't get the results they want\nto right away and start to fall off\nbecause of it and then they're like\nmaybe that was just a sign that this is\nnot the path that i'm supposed to go\nmaybe this is just a sign that this is\nnot right for me and what happens is\nthey give up before they start getting\nthe momentum on their side they give up\nbefore they get the momentum that starts\nto show them that they're on the right\npath and the way that i like to think of\nit is like pushing a car if you've ever\npushed a car before like if your car's\never broken down before i used to have\nsome beaters back in the day\nand i had a car that would break down as\nan old nissan sentra it was a complete\npos\nand it would break down and i'd have to\npush it by myself sometimes and\nsometimes somebody was nice enough on\nthe side of the road to help me push my\ncar\nthe struggles of being a college kid\nback in the day for me that's what it\nwas it was a side note it had no air\nconditioning and i lived in florida and\nit was the worst thing to have no air\nconditioning in florida especially when\nit rained and then my body heat would\nheat up the inside of it and it would\nget all foggy on the inside and i had no\nway to defrost the windows so\nuh i've i've had those days before i\nremember what those are like and when\nyou start pushing a car if you've ever\npushed a car like the physical pushing\nof a car from no movement at all to\ngetting it to move a little bit is the\nhardest part of it where you're pushing\nit and you're like i don't even know if\ni'm strong enough and it moves a little\nbit it moves a little bit it moves a\nlittle bit\nthe the starting of a business or the\nstarting of starting to lose weight and\ngoing on your your journey is like\ncoming from no momentum\nand starting to get it pushing and i\nthink most people give up before the\nmovement actually starts they're like\nthis is hard this is hard this is hard\ni'm gonna give up\nthis must mean i'm not supposed to do so\ni'm gonna go to something else and then\nthey go to something that's like oh it's\nhard it's hard it's hard i'm gonna give\nup\nbut if you've ever pushed the car it\ntakes a little while for the wheels to\nstart moving it takes a while for the\nwheels to start spinning but what\nhappens is once the car gets going it\ngets so much easier it's so much harder\nto go from zero to one mile an hour than\nit is to go from like one to two\nand then from two to three becomes\neasier and it takes a while to get it\nmoving but once it gets moving it\nbecomes so much easier to keep it moving\nand now that you get it going and the\ncar is moving what would be really dumb\nto do now that the car is moving is to\njump in front of it and try to stop it\nbecause if you have a car going even if\nit's just three miles an hour if it's\njust moving and it's got some momentum\non its side and you hop in front of the\ncar and try to stop it you're gonna get\nrun over by the car and that's how a lot\nof people's success really happens is\nthat there's a whole lot of struggle in\nthe beginning there's resistance there's\nfiguring it out they're seeing what\nworks they're seeing what doesn't work\nand it's pushing and pushing like\nit's not moving it doesn't feel like\nit's moving\nat that point in time you don't give up\nyou got to keep pushing through and\neventually whatever it is you're working\non will start to harness you'll be able\nto start to harness a little bit of\nmomentum on your side\nand it becomes easier to get it going it\nbecomes easier to get going becomes\neasier to get it going you know when i\nlook back at my business the first few\nyears was a struggle like it was years\nit wasn't like months it was years to\nfigure out what works what doesn't work\nif i look at the first three years of my\nbusiness first the last three years of\nmy business now\nthere was it was so much harder the\nfirst three years it's so much easier\nnow there's so much more momentum on its\nside but it took time to get it there\nso that's how life is the same way as if\nyou're just pushing a car and so next\ntime you decide to jump into doing\nsomething new something that you haven't\ndone before something that's brand new\nto you realize it's like pushing that\ncar it's gonna take time to get that\nthing moving\nbut once you get that moving the\nimportant thing is to not stop because a\nlot of times what will happen as well is\nwe do get the momentum on our side\nand then we self-sabotage and we stop\nand then what happens the car is\neventually going to slow down and when\nit slows down it's going to go to stop\nand then you got to do it over again and\nthen it's you got to do it over again\nyou got to do it over again\nonce you feel that momentum you have to\nkeep going and another example i always\ngive is like if we're at the top of a\nhill and i have a 15 pound bowling ball\nand i let it down and you stop it five\nfeet after it's after it starts it's\nvery easy to stop five feet after it\nstarts because it hasn't gotten all the\nmomentum but if you're at the bottom of\nthat hill and you try to stop it with\nyour hands you're gonna break a hand\nbecause it's got so much momentum on its\nside and that's what we're trying to get\ninto our life and so if you look at the\nthings that i hear a lot of people\ncomplaining about in life like\nworking out or fitness or losing weight\nmaybe you haven't been on a fitness\njourney for a long time maybe you've\nnever been on a fitness journey and\nyou're now just waking up to uh yeah i\ndon't like the way my body looks i don't\nlike the way i feel i don't like the\nsoreness that i have i don't like you\nknow the lack of energy you're gonna\nhave to harness some momentum in the\nfirst few weeks you're gonna have to\ndrag your big old butt to the gym and\nyou're not gonna wanna be there and it's\nnot gonna be fun and it's gonna be like\ntrying to push a car that's starting\nfrom zero it's gonna be hard you're\ngonna have to drag yourself\nlike getting the car moving\nbut it'll take a lot of will and showing\nup and will and showing up and just\ngoing i'm not gonna give up i'm not\ngonna give up but then what's really\ninteresting is after about a month or so\ngoing from nothing to something the\nfirst month is the hardest\nafter a month it starts to feel more\nnormal and it starts to feel more normal\nand it's not as hard to get yourself to\nthe gym it's not as hard to eat the\nhealthier stuff because your taste buds\nhave now changed you don't need all the\nsugary stuff you don't need all the\nsalty stuff healthier stuff starts to\ntaste better than it did a month ago and\nyou start to have a little bit of\nmomentum on your side it starts to feel\na little bit more natural now\nat that point you now have momentum on\nyour side things are moving in the right\ndirection the worst thing that you can\ndo\nis self-sabotage and stop because that\ncar eventually is going to come to a\nstop and then you're going to have to go\nthrough the exact same process again so\nyou have to become very aware\nto number one and when you're in the\nvery beginning of stages of anything is\nreminding yourself that you're trying to\nget the momentum on your side you're\ntrying to get the car moving and once it\ngets moving you have to remind yourself\nnot to let your foot off the gas to\ncontinue to keep going to continue to\nkeep pushing and continue to\npush harder so that the momentum becomes\neasier and easier for you and then what\nhappens is after a while those you guys\nthat have a very consistent routine of\nworking out\nsix months a year two years three years\nit becomes unnatural to not go to the\ngym like going to the gym your body\nactually starts to crave the working out\nyour body actually starts to crave the\nhealthier food because it fuels yourself\nbetter your body actually starts to\ncrave the things that you want but in\nthe beginning you don't crave it but\nwhen your body starts to crave it that\nis the momentum on your side moving you\nin the right direction and that's what\nwe're all trying to get to if you have\ngotten to the point where you work out\nmultiple times a day you eat healthy it\nbecomes so much easier and it actually\nfeels unnatural\nnot to eat healthy it feels unnatural\nnot to work out but it's not natural to\nfeel that way it's just you've been able\nto get momentum on your side\ni remember when i was really really into\nworking out i'm not this crazy anymore\nbut about seven years ago i remember i\nwas like i'm gonna work out four times a\nweek no matter what and i started doing\ni started falling loving love with and i\nwas like you know what i'm gonna go up\none more day i'm gonna do five days a\nweek cause i love it so much everybody\nstarted getting used to these endorphins\nand getting used to the feeling i was\nlike you know what i could probably do\nsix days a week i got to six days a week\nand i was like i'm gonna do six days a\nweek and one\nrest day and then my six days a week\nturned into six days a week and i went\nwell what if i just do like an active\nrest day and i still go to the gym but i\njust don't lift as heavy and so four\ndays a week went to five went to six\nwent to seven simply because it just\nfelt more natural to go and i didn't\nlike the way that i felt when i wasn't\nat the gym because i just had so much\nmomentum on my side and the only thing\nthat took the momentum away is i tore\nyou know\nold injuries in my life catching up from\nbasketball and football and baseball i\nwas younger i ended up having pain in my\nmy hips and shoulders and found out that\nthere was some old sports injuries that\nkind of as i got older they kind of\ncrept up a little bit but that was the\nuh the slowing down of my momentum for\nme\nand then after i was able to heal those\ninjuries it took a lot to get me back\ninto the gym and have it start to feel\nnatural again\nthis can also be stuff like waking up\nearly you know for some of you guys that\nare out there you're like i want to wake\nup early i want to have a morning\nroutine\nbut waking up is hard at first like if\nyou're like you know what i'm going to\nwake up at 5am\nwaking up at 5am the first morning is\nlike what it's so dark outside it's cold\ni feel like i just want to chug coffee\nright now or go back to bed and it's\njust like the first time you do it is\njust like pushing that car you're like\nthis isn't that fun i don't like this\nand then you get to the end of the day\nand you're like now i'm really tired at\nthe end of the day and you know middle\nof the day i'm really tired your body's\nstarting to get adjusted to it it takes\ntime to develop that morning waking up\nearly routine that you want and then you\ndo it a little bit more and you fight\nthrough and you fight through it you\nfight through it and then you're like\nyour body starts to adjust itself and\nyour body starts to go yeah we're going\nto go to bed earlier and your body\nstarts to shut off instead of shutting\noff at 11 o'clock now it's shutting off\nat 10 now shutting off at nine your body\nwill start to catch up and now you have\nthe momentum on your side now you have\nthe momentum to keep you going and then\nwhat happens if you've been doing a\nmorning routine for long enough you\nstart to wake up before your alarm goes\noff because it just becomes so much\neasier\nstarting a business is the exact same\nway\nwhen you're in the beginning stages of a\nbusiness it's hard it's figuring stuff\nout it's pushing it's there's a lot of\nstuff that doesn't work and you're\nfinding out what doesn't work and it\nfeels like\nmaybe i'm on the wrong path\nmaybe this is what i'm supposed to do\nmaybe i'm supposed to do something\ndifferent\nmaybe i'm in the wrong market maybe i'm\nnot passionate about this you start\nthinking of all the reasons why this\nisn't the right thing but what happens\nis and the most important thing for all\nof these things most important things\nfor all these things is to have the\ndestination in mind like a successful\nbusiness for instance\nyou know get very clear on what that\nmeans for you is it you want to make\nforty thousand dollars a year a hundred\nthousand dollars a year do you wanna\nmake a million dollars a year like what\ndoes what does that destination look\nlike that you're working towards and\nyou've got to keep that in your mind if\nwaking up early is what you want what\ndoes that destination look like my\ndestination looks like waking up at five\no'clock in the morning every single\nmorning spending an hour to myself that\ncould be working out j working out um\nuh journaling it could be reading it\ncould be whatever it is that you want to\ndo meditating all of that and you you\ndevelop it you look at what the\ndestination that you want is same thing\nwhere if you're trying to work to get\nthe body that you want what's important\nis that you have the destination in mind\nand as you're doing it there's gonna the\nroute that you thought you were going to\ngo to get to that destination is going\nto change over and over and over and\nover again you're going to be like oh\ndead end oh dead end oh dead end oh dead\nend\nbut it doesn't matter that you hit dead\nends because you're now realizing which\nthe the place that you don't want to go\nin the place that you don't want to be\nand you start to realize what doesn't\nwork\nand through finding out what doesn't\nwork you start to figure out what works\nso starting a new business it's the\nexact same way it's like all right i'm\ngoing to start doing facebook ads to\nsell my product well you're gonna find a\nlot of facebook ads that do not work for\nyou and it's gonna feel like wasted\nmoney but through feeling like you're\nwasting money you're also figuring out\nwhat doesn't work which means you'll\nnever do it again because it doesn't\nwork why would you keep doing the same\nthing that doesn't work then you start\nto take other paths and other routes and\neventually you find something that\nclicks and when it clicks that's the\nthing that brings in the money for you\nand so it's about realizing exactly what\nit is that you want\nbecause everything's every single thing\ntakes time and there's always a bit of a\nstruggle in the beginning the same way\nthat it's just struggle to push the car\nnothing new\nis easy at the beginning that i've ever\nseen\nwhether it's waking up early whether\nit's working out whether it's building a\nbusiness it's not really that easy\nbut it becomes so much easier as you do\nit over and over and over again but the\nimportant thing is to look at the\ndestination have the destination in mind\nand say i don't care\nwhat it takes i'm going to get there\neventually no matter how many dead ends\ni find i'm going to get there eventually\nand you start to find out what works and\nthat finding out of what works is a\nlittle bit of the wheel starting to\nfinally move because when you're first\npushing the car ain't moving but then it\nstarts to move a little bit and you're\nlike oh man i'm starting to see a little\nbit of a light at the end of the tunnel\nit starts to move a little bit so if\nyou're sitting there and you're\nlistening to me and your life has been\nstagnant for a while\nit's gonna take some time it's going to\ntake some effort it's going to take some\nattention it's going to take a whole\nhell of a lot of work to get you out of\nstagnation into starting to get momentum\non your side but the super super\nimportant thing is to make sure that you\nrealize when you get that momentum on\nyour side\nhow can you not stop how can you just\nkeep going because once you have action\nyou've heard me say it over and over\nagain action creates more action\ninaction creates more in action so how\ncan you start to get that moving and and\nbe very aware of what i like to call the\ni deserve it the i deserve it so when\nyou start it's when you get the momentum\non your side and then you get a case of\nthe i deserve it and then you\nself-sabotage and so a good example of\nlike\nlosing weight for instance right you\nmight be like you know what i'm on a\nweight loss journey i want to lose 30\npounds and you lose your first five 10\npounds i say you lose 10 pounds right\nand you're like man i'm doing good i'm\ndoing good\nyou're eating healthy you're showing up\nto the gym you're doing what needs to be\ndone then what happens after those 10\npounds on the journey to 30 you get a\ncase of the i deserve it and you stop\ndoing the things that were bringing you\nsuccess you ever done this before you\nstopped doing those things so you're\nlike i've lost 10 pounds\nyou know what i deserve to have some ice\ncream tonight i've been working hard\ni deserve it i deserve to have a glass\nof extra glass of wine tonight i deserve\nto have i was supposed to have a pizza\nbut i've been working i've lost 10\npounds i deserve to have some pizza\ninstead of that salad that i was\nplanning and you get i deserve it i\ndeserve it i deserve it i deserve it and\ni deserve it as one of the most common\nforms of self-sabotage and you do too\nmany damn i deserve it you realize all\nthose 10 pounds that you worked so hard\nto get off they've all come back\nand you have stopped the momentum you\nhave self-sabotage you're like you know\nwhat i was supposed to work out today\nbut i'll uh you know i'll go tomorrow\ni'll go tomorrow no big deal you know\ni've been working hard i've lost 10\npounds i deserve to take a day off\nbecause i've been working hard i'm a\nlittle bit sore right you get a casey i\ndeserve it it's just many many many many\nmany many self-sabotages and then they\nall add up and you're like\nsix months later i'm back to the same\nweight that i was before\nand that's the case of the i deserve\nit's that people will get people get it\nwith weight loss they get it with like a\nthey have a great week of sales and then\nlike you know what i had such a good\nsales week last week i mean i made more\nmoney i've ever made than that last week\nyeah i'm gonna kind of take it easy this\nweek because i deserve it i worked so\ndamn hard last week so you've got to be\nvery self-aware of the i deserve it and\nhow that leads to self-sabotage because\nthat is the the power of momentum being\nslowed down by your self-sabotage and so\nyou've got to be very aware of that so\nthe thing that i would like to think\nabout i bring this up pretty often with\na lot of people like coaches you know\nthink back\nto something that you really\nwanted to do years ago but you gave up\non\nlike working out or starting that\nbusiness or\nyou know\nwaking up early whatever those things\nmight be what is something that you gave\nthat you really wanted to do but you\ngave up on years ago think about that\nand bring that close to your mind what\nwould your life look like if you just\ndecided back then to never give up what\nwould your life look like today what\nwould your mind look like today what\nwould your body look like today if you\nnever gave up on that thing that you\ngave up on 10 years ago\nyour life would be vastly different but\nthe problem is you gave up on it now\nlet me take you to present moment what\nif this thing that you want to do you\njust decided that you're never going to\ngive up on it\nyou're not going to get a case of the i\ndeserve it and you're not going to stop\nuntil you're at the destination that you\nwant that is the mindset that you have\nto have to harness the power of momentum\nand when you do that you'll look back\nand you'll realize your life is in a\ncompletely different place years from\nnow\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well if you\nwere already the person that could\ncreate the success that you want you\nwould have already had that success so\nwhat we're getting down to\nis that it's you that needs to change"
