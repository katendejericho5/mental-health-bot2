    "transcript": "you're taking your mind off of what you\nreally need to work on to grow yourself\nmentally physically emotionally\nspiritually and you're going i'm just\ngonna watch netflix for two hours\ntoday i'm gonna talk about why you\nshould stop numbing yourself and you\nmight be sitting there going well rob\ni don't numb myself and i'm going to go\nhey\nyeah you do we all do\nbut i'm going to tell you why we numb\nourselves we're going to talk about what\nnumbing is and we're going to talk about\nhow to get past it so that we can stop\nnumbing ourselves so that we can\nactually start moving towards the\ndirection we want so let me ask you and\ni'll answer this question what is\nnumbing numbing is just basically the\neasiest way to think of it is it is\nanything to occupy your mind\nso that you're not thinking about what\nyou actually need to think about\nto overcome something that you've gone\nthrough or something that's happened in\nyour past\nso\nthe thing about it is is numbing is is a\nvery interesting thing because there are\nsome forms of numbing that are very\nobvious they're very visible and we as\npeople in our society tend to judge\nother people for the visible forms of\nnumbing so let me give you an example\ndrugs can be a form of numbing so\nsomeone who is a drug addict\ncan be and you know in turn is usually\nnumbing themselves from some form of\ntrauma or something that they need to\nwork through\nand you know i spoke about this on a\ncouple episodes ago with gabor mate\ngabor mate is a psychologist that says\nthat every trauma comes from every\naddiction comes from a trauma that has\nnot been resolved so drugs we can look\nat someone and say oh that person's a\ndrug addict you know they need to stop\nbeing a drug addict what's another\nexample alcohol right so we can look at\nsomeone and say oh that person is an\nalcoholic they need to get their\ntogether they need to get their life\nlike it's very easy to see these\nphysical forms of like they're an\nalcoholic they need to stop being\nalcoholic they need to get past it we\ncan look at somebody who is uh you know\nfood is another example of numbing right\nwe can look at someone who's severely\navoiding be like oh they're severely\noverweight they need to get it together\nbut in reality when you look at these\nforms and i'm gonna tell you other forms\nthose are just some of the physical\nforms where you can visibly see\nsomeone who's overweight you can visibly\nsee someone who's an alcoholic you can\nvisibly see someone who is a drug addict\nand you can say they need to stop doing\nthat thing what they're doing is they're\nnumbing the feeling of something that\nthey don't want to feel they're numbing\nthe\npast trauma that they have they're\nnormally the depression that they have\nthey're numbing the feelings that they\nhave through either food or alcohol or\ndrugs now that's easy to look at them\nand say that and to be oh i'm going to\njudge them for it but there's many other\nforms of numbing that are not as easy to\nsee tv is a form of numbing just\ndeciding that you're going to watch\nnetflix for two hours every single day\nis a form of numbing you're taking your\nmind off of what you really need to work\non to grow yourself mentally physically\nemotionally spiritually and you're going\ni'm just going to watch netflix for two\nhours so tv can be a form of number now\nthere's nothing wrong with watching tv\nlet me say this there's nothing wrong\nwith any of these things what's wrong is\nwhen you're using them to numb the\nfeelings that you don't want to come in\ncontact with your it's like the the\nphrase\nthe cave that you're afraid to enter\nholds the treasure that you seek\nso the cave that you're afraid to enter\nhold the treasure that you seek so going\nback into you know you were emotionally\nneglected by your parents or something\nthat's a cave that's not easy to enter\nbut your treasure that you seek the\npersonal development the growth the\nstopping the limiting beliefs the\nfinally believing yourself all of those\ntreasures come from going back into that\ncave so\ntv can be an example of it\nsex can be an example of it being a\nworkaholic can be an example of it mine\nwas workaholism like i was working when\ni was younger i was working 110 hours a\nweek every single week for three years\nstraight why because i had a bunch of\ntrauma from my childhood that i just did\nnot want to come in contact with and i\nwas working and working and working and\nworking i didn't realize it at the time\ni didn't realize until like seven eight\nyears later that what i was doing is i\nwas actually running\nfrom the things that i needed to work\nthrough and i was telling myself oh yeah\ni'm running a business i'm just too busy\ni'm running business i'm just too busy\nbut in reality what i really need to do\nis i really need to look at myself in\nthe mirror\nand start to work on myself and if i\nwould have done that my my business\nwould have become so much easier that i\nwould have actually been able to work\nless so becoming a workaholic can be\nthat way and what's interesting about\nthat people can\ncan demonize\nbeing an alcoholic and being a drug\naddict we can demonize those things but\nthen what's happening in our society\nthat's really interesting is that this\nhustle culture or the workaholic mindset\nactually is praised in our society so\nit's actually even worse because you're\npraising the thing that somebody needs\nto work through so workaholism can be it\nanother really big form of and this is\nthe reason why i think it's so big is\nsocial media now there's nothing\ninherently wrong with working there's\nnothing wrong with\nwith food there's nothing wrong with\nalcohol there's nothing wrong with\nsocial media but when they're used as a\nform of running\nfrom the actual thing that we need to\nwork through that in turn is is where it\nbecomes the issue and seeing that as\nlike oh i'm going to spend two hours a\nday on on social media instead so why do\nwe do it we do it because ultimately at\nits simplest form we're trying to either\nrun from something or we're trying to\nkeep our minds off of something and this\nisn't this isn't like a conscious\nthought to do this\nit's actually a subconscious thing that\nwe tend to literally run from something\nby being busy doing something else you\nknow i have had this issue myself and i\nhave many friends that have had this\nissue and know people who have this\nissue where\nit's hard for them to take a vacation\nbecause they're so addicted to working\nthat the downtime is\nmiserable for them because they're\nfinally coming in contact with the\nthings that they need to work through\nit's like it's like when you're working\nworking working working and then you get\ndown time and then you get sick it's\nlike your body is finally gone now we\nhave time to actually heal\nwell in that downtime is when you're\nsupposed to heal from the things that\nyou need to heal from in order to make\nyourself better so we're trying to keep\nour minds off of something you know what\nyou need to work on in your life the\ntraumas that need to be healed what's\nwrong in your life you know sometimes we\nget so busy on instagram and we get so\nbusy on social media because we don't\nwant to think about how we're working a\njob that we hate and so it's easier\ninstead of starting to figure out like\ncoming to terms with like i really\ndon't enjoy my job my job is not what i\nwant to be doing with my life and maybe\nyou don't hate your job maybe it's just\nlike you know that it's not what you're\nmeant meant to be on earth like maybe\nyou want to be a painter maybe you want\nto be a musician maybe you want to\nmake jewelry and sell it on etsy and\nthat's what makes your soul come alive\nbut you're working this day job and so\ninstead of actually looking at how can i\nget out of this day job and start to\nbuild this passion and build this life\nthat i want to instead of going through\nthose hard thoughts and those hard\nfeelings were like i'll just go on\ninstagram for a couple hours and it's a\nsubconscious thing once again it's not a\nconscious thing\nyou know it's it's what's wrong in your\nlife that you might have a job that you\ndon't love maybe you're in a\nrelationship with somebody that you\nultimately know you shouldn't be in a\nrelationship with them and you know that\nthe hard\nfeelings of having to get out of that\nrelationship with them\nare way too hard to even think about and\nso you can be finding other forms of\nnumbing it could be once again drugs it\ncould be food it could be alcohol it\ncould be\ntv it could be instagram it could be any\nof those things versus actually going\nyou know what i've got to look at this\nrelationship i've got to see if this\nrelationship is serving me at the\nhighest level and i've got to look at\nthe relationship to see if it is serving\nthem at the highest level as well and\nthose can be really tough emotions to\nstart to go through so instead of going\nthrough those emotions we're like let's\njust go ahead and watch netflix and so\ninstead of going through those emotions\nand then after going through those\nemotions knowing oh my god\ni'm now gonna have to make a really\ntough decision and have a really tough\nconversation with this person we're like\nscrew it let me just keep myself busy\nversus actually doing the thing that\nneeds to be done\nmaybe it's the fact that\nyou're living your life and you've been\nliving your life not to your full\npotential\nand you're sitting there and you know\nthat it's not to your full potential\nyour truest deepest self knows that it's\nnot to your full potential\nbut it's a lot easier just to you know\nit's like as if you're you can't see me\nif you're listening to the podcast but\nif you watch on video it's like i'm\nlooking over this way to the left and\nall to the left is all of the bad things\nthat i need not necessarily bad let's\nsay it's the bad relationship that i\nneed to get out of and it's sitting\nthere and it's sitting there it's\nsitting there so instead what i'm doing\nis i'm turning my head to the right and\ni'm looking at anything else that i\npossibly can to keep me busy so that i\ndon't look to the left because when i\nlook to left like oh\noh that's not what i want and so i'm\nlooking to the right looking to the\nright look to the right i'm looking to\nthe right through going out on the\nweekends and partying because i have\nthis relationship that i i'm ultimately\nrealizing is not for me\nit's the reason why i think a lot of\npeople like to party on the weekends and\ndo what they need to do on the weekends\nis because ultimately they don't within\ntheir downtime they don't want to think\nabout the job that's not helping them\ngrow it might be like i said that you're\nnot growing living up to your full\npotential and your full potential is\nover there it's sitting to the left it's\nlike you hate your job you hate what\nyou're doing you know that there's\nsomething better for you know there's\nmore for your life it's over the left\nit's over left it's over left and i'm\nlike screw it i'm just going to look to\nthe right and i'm going to go ahead and\nscroll on social media and do some\nmindless stuff so that therefore i don't\nhave to look over to my left\nand ultimately looking to the right is\nsome form of numbing ourselves from the\nfeeling or the thoughts that we truly\nneed to come in contact with they're\njust sitting out of our eyesight\nand sometimes we need to just take our\nhead and turn a little bit and go oh\nthere it is what do i need to do to make\nmy life better so\nwhat's the solution if we find ourselves\nin this situation we're going oh like\nthere's a lot of you that are listening\nnow they're going oh\nyeah i might be numbing in some ways\nokay well then what's the solution let\nme ask you this if let me ask you a\nquestion if you fast forward\n10 years from today\nand your life is exactly like it is\nright now would you be\nexcited about that would you feel like\nhell yes\nif it's a yes\nkeep doing what you're doing that's\namazing but if you look at it and you\nsay if i were in this relationship\n10 more years would i be excited about\nwhat we have created and what we've done\nif the answer is no\nit might not be the right relationship\nfor you or it might be the right\nrelationship for you but you just need\nto change certain aspects of the\nrelationship and you need to have a real\ncoming to god conversation with that\nperson so that you can change into the\npeople that you want to be to support\neach other for the next 10 years and if\nyou fast forward your job 10 years from\ntoday maybe you get a couple promotions\nmaybe you get a little bit of a raise\nyou get a little bit more money maybe\nget a company car\nwould you if you fast forward in 10\nyears be like yeah this job is a this\njob is a hell yes for me in 10 years if\nit is beautiful it's not sounds like\nsomething that you need to work at maybe\nit's your potential maybe you're looking\nover and you say hey if if i had only if\ni had capped out at my if today i have\ncapped out at my potential and i ain't\ngot no more potential left and i'm going\nto stay at this potential for the next\n10 years are you like hell yes that's\namazing or are you like no there is more\nfor me in this world and i don't want to\nlive this way anymore if you fast\nforward 10 years\nwould you be excited about it\nif not well now we've got to figure out\nwhat it is that we're numbing so we can\nstart to get past it you know one of the\nthings i always hear people say is i\ndon't have enough time\ntime is the biggest\ncop-out that exists oh i don't have\nenough time it's so easy just to say you\ndon't have it none of us have enough\ntime oh i don't have enough time i've\ngot this going on i've got this going\ni've got this going on i did some\nresearch so i can give you some stats as\nwe go into today's episode the average\nperson spends two\nhours a day on social media\nmaybe you spend more maybe you spend\nless but the average person spends two\nhours a day so let's just go off of the\naverage person\nthat's 730 hours a year\non social media if we fast forward 10\nyears like we're talking about that's 7\n300 hours on social media over the next\n10 years if it's just to two hours if\nyou're more than that it's more than 7\n300 hours\nit's a lot of damn hours that is 304\ndays of your life in the next 10 years\nalmost an entire year of your life over\nthe next 10 years will be dedicated to\nscrolling on social media\nis that what you want if it is cool keep\nscrolling but if it's not maybe it's\ntime for us to make a change and see how\nwe can start to find more time to make\nchange in our life the average person\nspends four hours a day\nwatching tv this is including the\nweekends i'm sure probably there's more\non the weekend so they average it out\nover the course of the entire week four\nhours per day guys that is\n608 days of your life over the next 10\nyears on watching tv if you want to keep\ndoing that keep doing it but if you're\nlooking at going man there's so much\nmore that i could do if i spend two\nhours a day on instagram and i spend\nfour hours a day watching tv on average\nthat's six hours that's a quarter of my\nentire life on instagram and facebook\nand netflix what if i were to find that\ntime because then we don't have time i\ndon't have enough time to change my life\nwhat if we were just to decide to find\nthat time to change our schedule around\nto actually work towards what it is that\nwe want and create the life we want to\nin that time what could you replace it\nwith\ncould you replace it with doing the\npainting that you want could you replace\nit with building that business that you\nwant could you replace that time with\nundivided time for your kids where you\nthrow the phone in the other room and\nit's just time that you're going to\nspend on developing the best damn humans\nthat you can undivided attention maybe\nit's time on your personal growth maybe\nit's time with reading maybe it's more\ntime\nmeditating so that you can work on your\ninner peace maybe it's time journaling\nmaybe it's any of those things to work\non your personal growth and help\nyourself become the best version of\nyourself so to say you don't have enough\ntime is a cop-out and we could go\nthrough every single person's schedule\nif i were to sit down with you and go\nthrough every 15 minutes of your life\nfor an entire week there's definitely\ntime in there for something to change\nyour life to build that business to work\non yourself more to bring out your full\npotential to get into the relationship\nor to build the relationship one that\nyou currently have into what it is that\nyou want you have time stop telling\nyourself you don't have time that is the\nultimate cop-out because you're blaming\nsomething externally versus looking\ninward and saying how can i make a\nchange so you have to become very\nself-aware of how you're spending your\ntime and how you actually are numbing\nbecause we're all doing it in some form\nof some some form of another i'm doing\nit in some sort of way you're doing in\nsome sort of way we're all numbing in\nsome way but if we want to actually\ndevelop ourselves and the people that we\nwant to be we've got to stop numbing and\ngo back and look at those things that\nmight be hard to look at so that we can\nstart making change in our life and\nwe've got to actually take the time to\ndo it and stop lying to ourselves and\nsay that we don't have time\nwe always have time you just have to\nfind it and as i always say\nyou can either you can either find a way\nor you can find an excuse completely up\nto you if you don't find a way you will\nfind excuses to why it's not happening\nso you can take out a journal you can\nread a book you can buy a course you can\nlearn something or do something new or\nwork on that passion that you've been\nwanting to master you can work out and\nthen you also have to ask yourself the\nquestion you know\nif we're always constantly constantly\ndoing stuff some people are going well i\njust don't want to be bored let's dive\ninto that for a second what's wrong with\nbeing bored people think being bored is\na bad thing being bored\nis literally the mind wanting to do\nsomething because we are addicted to\ndoing something we're all addicted to\ndoing things so if you get into a state\nof boredom and you're like this is this\nis uncomfortable it's uncomfortable it's\nuncomfortable it's uncomfortable i'm\nbored\nwhat's wrong with it you're just simply\nexisting like i don't see my dog being\nlike oh my god i'm really bored today no\nhe's just\nreally present and he's really good at\nexisting and he's really damn cute at\nexisting right so that's that's what a\ndog does and you might be like well yeah\nbut i gotta pay the bills i get it i\nunderstand that but what's wrong with\nbeing bored what's wrong with just\nsimply existing nothing there is nothing\nwrong with it the problem is that we\nhave addicted minds we're constantly\naddicted to stimuli to doing this and\ndoing this and doing this and doing this\nand eventually we have to come to a\npoint where we look at our lives and we\nsay you know what\nthis isn't what i want maybe i have been\nnumbing maybe there are some things\nmaybe there are some caves that i need\nto enter because the treasure is in\nthere i need to go seek it because\nultimately we're all numbing in some\nsort of way the question is number one\nwhy are we numbing what do we need to\novercome and number two what can we do\nto get ourselves past that numbing to\nstart to work on the future that we\nactually want to create because\nultimately\nlife is going to continue on the\nquestion is are you going to build the\nlife that you want or are you just going\nto drift from place to place and just\nhopefully maybe we'll end up being lucky\nyou've got to decide to create the life\nthat you want versus hoping that the\nlife will be created for you\nand that\nis what you need to work on a stop\nnumbing\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well there\nare some people\ntoday right now possibly even listening\nto this episode that are still pissed\noff about something that happened to\nthem 10 years ago what a waste"
