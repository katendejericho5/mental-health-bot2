    "transcript": "we want to stay in our armor\nbecause opening up makes you feel naked\nyou gain your power over it and it\nbecomes your superpower the only way to\ntruly love yourself is to realize that\nas you currently are nothing needs to\nchange\none thing we're gonna talk about very\nvery deeply today is vulnerability\nyep\nwe're gonna go there why because we're\nso afraid every human is afraid of\nvulnerability in some sort of way and\nthe reason why is because in people's\nheads we think of the word vulnerability\nand we think vulnerability as weakness\nwe think it's a dark emotion we think\nvulnerability at its core is fear and\nanxiety and shame and disappointment and\nthe most difficult emotions that exist\nbut also at the core of vulnerability is\nlove and joy and happiness and it's hard\nnowadays because we see all of the ads\non tv that tell us that we're not good\nenough we see you know little girls\nnowadays seeing magazines\nthat show them what perfectionism\nactually is people get on instagram\nchildren get on instagram teenagers get\non instagram and they see everybody\nphotoshopped in some sort of way it is\nso easy to edit yourself on your iphone\nright now and so what do we do\nbecause the fact that we look around us\nand we think oh everything everybody\nelse is so perfect that person's not i'm\nnot\nwe numb ourselves we numb vulnerability\nand we don't want to open up because we\ndon't want to be disappointed we want to\nstay\nin our armor\nbecause opening up makes you feel naked\nand it makes you feel like you're coming\nout of your skin and it's only gotten\nharder with social media because\nobviously everything's so edited and\nthen people are looking at how many\nlikes they get if they don't get as many\nlikes as somebody else and they don't\nfeel like they're good enough and all of\nadvertising and social media makes us\nfeel like we're not good enough we're\nnot good enough we're not pretty enough\nwe're not smart enough we're not fit\nenough we're not successful enough we're\nnot thin enough\nand it makes it so hard because then\nwe're looking at our imperfect selves\nbecause everybody's imperfect and we're\ncomparing ourselves to standards that\nare basically impossible to achieve\nunless you have a computer to fix it\nright women see ads and people are\nunattainably skinny and through\nphotoshop they have perfect skin\nquote-unquote perfect skin because they\ncan edit everything out so then they\nstart comparing themselves and comparing\ntheir lives to near-perfect standards\nright and then you watch movies and you\nsee marriages and love stories and\nrom-coms that have these perfect lives\nand these perfect love and these perfect\nmarriages that ours could never compare\nto to how great they are on the big skin\non the big screen so what do we do\nwe hide\nand we try to make ourselves not be seen\nbecause we're not that we're not that\nperfect person the advertisement we're\nnot that perfect person that's on\ninstagram we're not that perfect\nrelationship with that perfect love that\nwe see in all of the movies so what do\nwe do we hide from everybody\nfrom ourselves from our friends from our\nfamily from our significant others\nbecause it's easier to hide so we hide\nbehind an armor and we never let anybody\nsee the real us\nwe hide all of our blemishes women hide\ntheir blemishes behind makeup men\nhide all their bald spots but behind\nhats\nand we get into relationships and we get\ninto friendships and all of them are\njust surface level and they never grow\nand they never become deeper in really\ndeep relationships or really deep\nfriendships because everyone is just\nafraid of possibly letting somebody in\nand possibly being let down and it's\neasier just to hide than it is to in and\nto hide and to never be let down than to\ntruly open yourself up\nfor possibility in what could be and\nthen be let down\nso we don't even enter the race\nbecause we're afraid that we might lose\nit\nso we close off\nwe close off and we close off more and\nmore and more as we get older\nbut here's the problem with that\nin order to experience the best emotions\nas a human\nwe have to experience vulnerability in\norder experience true love true joy true\nhappiness true hope true authenticity we\ncan't experience those without allowing\nourselves to be vulnerable\nbut the problem is this we see\nvulnerability as weakness\nwe see vulnerability as weakness it\nshows us being weak it shows us being\nimperfect it shows us not being as good\nas everybody else\nbut when you're open and you're honest\nand you're vulnerable and completely\nemotionally naked do you want to know\nwhat people actually think of you think\nabout it for a second they think wow\nthat person's courageous i don't know\nhow they just did that i wish that i\ncould open up so what's interesting is\nthough we think courageous being\nstepping out and being\nstepping out and being vulnerable is\nweak other people view as courageous\nand i think that one of the main\nproblems with being vulnerable is that\nit leaves us open to uncertainty most\npeople are uncomfortable with\nuncertainty most people want certainty\nthey want definite in their lives\nyou know what if we love someone and we\nopen up to them we show them our true\nselves what who we truly are behind all\nthe armor and they see it and they don't\nlove us back but what if they judge us\nthat's what we worry about\nit's too risky\nwe don't want to open ourselves up and\npossibly be hurt that's just going to\nhurt even more so we stay closed we keep\nour armor up and it's not just love and\nrelationships it's many many things you\nknow vulnerability is many things\nvulnerability is starting a business\nvulnerability is finding your passion\nand following your passion vulnerability\nis\ndoing what other people think that you\nshouldn't do sharing an unpopular\nopinion\ncalling a friend who might have cancer\nthat's vulnerable\nsaying i love you first\nsaying you know that you have art that\nyou want to share with someone sharing\nyour music with somebody trying\nsomething new exercising in public when\nyou're overweight being accountable\nhaving faith\nadmitting that you were wrong at some\npoint in time asking for forgiveness all\nof those are vulnerability as well\nin the word vulnerable just so you know\nit comes from the latin word vulnerar\nwhich means capable of being wounded\nopen for attack and that's what we feel\nlike when we think of the word\nvulnerable i could possibly be wounded i\ncould possibly be attacked and we want\nto be strong we want to be courageous so\nwe don't allow ourselves to be\nvulnerable we don't allow people to see\nthat side of us and we think it will\nopen us up for some form of an attack\nwith the possibility of being\nemotionally wounded and that sounds hard\nit's emotional exposure we want to hide\nbehind that we don't want to get out\nthere and let other people see us but in\nreality\nwhen you're vulnerable you're not\nemotionally weak you actually become\nemotionally stronger no one looks down\non someone who's vulnerable they look up\nto them\nto be vulnerable is to truly be alive\nand it all starts when you're a child\nwhen we come into this world we're\nvulnerable children don't care what you\nthink about them they don't care they\ndon't care about clothes that they wear\nyou know dean's child was over here he's\na year and a half he was over here this\nweekend kid was walking around my house\nnaked did not care about anybody seeing\nhim naked didn't even pop into his head\nright children don't care they they are\nvulnerable they're the epitome of\nvulnerable\nbut then as they get older they get\nreprimanded what they should and\nshouldn't do they learn what they can\nand cannot do in the world and what\nhappens is they realize what they can't\ndo\nand what they can do and they start to\nclose off\nbecause they're like oh that's who i\ntruly am i'm not allowed to be that so\nthey close off in elementary school you\nget older you share secrets with a\nfriend thinking that they'll never tell\na soul and they tell people and then you\nget made fun of so what do you do you\nclose off\nyou learn to close off from these things\nbecause it's easier to close off than is\nto be made fun of\nthat's also why breakups are so hard\nright you find your first love you show\nthem your true self because you don't\nknow any better you allow that yourself\nto be emotionally vulnerable with this\nperson it makes you so happy it makes\nyou over the moon in love with that\nperson love and happiness and all of\nthat good\nbut then you see that person kissing\nsomeone by the locker and you feel like\nyour heart's been ripped out whatever it\nis\nright it's emotional treason is what it\nfeels like so you learn to close off i\ndon't want to show my my true self\nanymore\nright it's those raw\nemotional years that we learn to close\noff rather than being hurt\nso we're certain that if we close off\nthat we won't be hurt so we want\ncertainty\nover uncertainty a lot of times if we\nopen up it allows us to be hurt and\npossibly you know be scarred by somebody\nelse\nbut everybody has to deal with\nvulnerability at some point in time not\njust\nnot just a few people we all have to\nfigure out that vulnerability is\nsomething we need to embrace or die\nwithout truly being seen as who we are\nsee we're human we all struggle with\nfeelings of of not being good enough we\nwant to feel loved we want to feel like\nwe're good enough we want to feel like\nwe're good enough and smart enough and\npretty enough and successful and happy\nand\nthin enough and fit enough whatever the\nhell it is that you want\nwe want all that stuff\nbut to be vulnerable to be alive and to\nopen yourself up to being seen open\nyourself up to being happy open yourself\nup to being loved to open yourself up to\npossibly being hurt\nand if we want to truly be happy then we\nhave to figure out a way to embrace that\nvulnerability so how do we invasion how\ndo we how do we possibly allow ourselves\nto be open to those things well\nvulnerability\nis the only real thing that's going to\nallow us to set us free to love truly\nand to be loved\nand typically we tend to run from it so\nwe need to learn to be comfortable with\nletting our armor down it's like\nanything else it becomes hard the very\nfirst time but it becomes easier with\npractice as adults\nwe need to learn to be\ncreative and speak you need to learn to\nbe courageous\nto follow what our purpose is to find\nconnection to feel what true love is to\nsee what true love is and in\nrelationships vulnerability is the last\nthing that we want other people to see\nin us but it's the very first thing that\nwe want to see and then\nthink about that one for a second isn't\nthat interesting it's the very last\nthing they want people to see in us but\nit's the very first thing we want to see\nin them we want to know the real them we\nwant to see the person that they hide\nfrom everyone else\nbut we don't want them to think that\nwe're weak\nwe want them to think that we're strong\nright but some people have been wearing\na mask for so long that they don't even\nknow who they truly are\nthey don't know who they are because\nthey've never been that way in front of\ntheir friends in front of their family\nin front of their kids in front of their\npartner\nso they don't know who the hell they are\nbut one of the things that makes us so\nmuch more advanced than animals are is\nour emotional capacity that we can\nconstantly expand that emotional\ncapacity capacity then\nwe can't worry about not being accepted\nwe have to step out into the unknown\nthere's a quite a quote that really\nworks well with this and it's be the\nchange that you want to see in the world\nyou have to realize\nthat in order to have true deep\nconnection relationship with someone\nthat you\nactually might have to be the first\nperson to open up\nyou might have to be the first person be\nvulnerable you're the one that's\nlistening to this episode not them\nso maybe you have to be the first person\nthe first person that opens up that's\nvulnerable in the relationship that\nyou're in the first step is really being\nopen and vulnerable is to believe that\nyou are enough that you are good enough\nthat you are pretty enough that you are\nfit enough that you are successful\nenough that you are smart enough that\nyou are thin enough as you currently are\nnot to say that you couldn't get better\nbut as you currently are you have to be\nopen to just loving yourself and\naccepting yourself as you are because\nyou might not be where you want to say\nphysically but it doesn't mean that you\ncan't start looking at yourself as if\nyou are fit enough right now and tell\nyourself that you are enough\nbecause when you believe that you are\nenough it makes it easier to be\nvulnerable because you truly believe\nthat you're enough as you are and you\ndon't need someone else to accept you\nbecause you are good enough as you are\nthat you are worthy enough that you are\ncomfortable with the way that you look\nthat the way that you feel\nthat you're comfortable with that\nand you learn to be more confident\nyourself and you don't need anybody else\nto tell you how you are how you look how\nyou feel\nthat's one step to getting more\nconfident with being vulnerable is being\nconfident in yourself\nand when you look at yourself you can be\nhappy with the way that you look and\nwith the way that you would look and\nyou're happy with it you can be\nvulnerable and you're confident you can\nbe confident showing it to others\nknowing that you're perfect is the way\nthat you are you allow yourself to be\nhappy and you stop heart you stop hiding\nlike when i first started this podcast\none thing that was so terrifying for me\nwas that i remember writing down a piece\nof paper that i was going to be true\nand authentic and real and raw and\nvulnerable and that was scary for me\nbecause i never really practiced\nvulnerability like when my father passed\naway he passed away on a thursday i went\nback to school either monday or tuesday\nright i didn't tell anybody i was 15\nyears old because what 15 year old boy\nis allowed to show emotions especially\naround his friends i didn't tell anybody\nso i always struggled with opening\nmyself up and when i started the podcast\ni was like you know what i'm going to\nactually talk about it i had so many\nfriends that didn't know my father\npassed away didn't know my father's an\nalcoholic i never talked about it and i\nwent you know what i'm just going to go\nahead and start saying it to people if i\ncan be open honest and vulnerable then\npeople maybe can listen to me and go you\nknow what me too maybe i can connect\nmaybe they can connect to my story in\nsome form of a you know some way or\nanother and in turn it will help them\ndeal with whatever it is that they're\ndealing with\nright\nwhat i can tell you now that almost 900\npodcast episodes in is that having a\npodcast and saying these things out loud\nhas been one of the most cathartic\nthings that i could possibly do\nit was so hard to record podcast\nepisodes though and say some of the [ __ ]\nthat i had really gone through my life\nsay some of the really stuff that was\nreally hard because i hid it from\neverybody for years and years for 15\nyears nobody knew any of that stuff it\nwas hard for me to be vulnerable guys\naren't supposed to be vulnerable that's\nwhat we're told right\nand i was reading a book called daring\ngreatly by brene brown and i saw it\nand i was like you know what this is\nright i do need to try to actually try\nto be more vulnerable and to actually\nshare what i thought was my\nquote-unquote weakness\nand what was interesting about is as i\nshared my story i started getting so\nmany emails from people that were like\noh my gosh i love this\ni connect my story with yours thank you\nso much for being vulnerable and\ncourageous and all of this stuff and the\nfunny thing was is that people started\nreaching out to me these podcasts that i\nwas so afraid to put out so afraid to\ntalk about you know my my father's\nissues my father's death\ni did a podcast episode\nliterally a few days after my\ngrandfather passed away\nand i remember literally crying in the\nepisode and i was like i'm gonna put it\nout anyways now it's terrifying and then\ni got so many emails of people being\nlike thank you for just being vulnerable\nbecause it gives me\nthe confidence that i can go and be\nvulnerable as well it shows me that a\nconfident person can be vulnerable right\nand some people don't even let anybody\nknow that side of themselves some people\ndon't even know that side of themselves\nsome people joy is something that they\ndon't allow themselves to experience\nvulnerability is something they don't\nallow themselves to experience in\nthe happiest most amazing\nmoments in your life the happiest most\namazing feelings in and emotions that\nyou want to feel\nare all being held back you're if you\ncan't feel your lowest lows and you\ndefinitely can't feel your highest high\nso you're restricted emotionally if you\ncan't fully open yourself up ever\nright\nand some people the most joyous moments\nof their lives are held back because\nthey're still too worried about what\ncould possibly happen and they have\narmor up like a good example i always\nthink of is parents they see their kids\non the first day of school and they\nworry about when they're going to be 18\nyears old and leaving for college\ninstead\nof just fully being in that moment and\nand thinking about their child going to\nschool\nright or they see their child going to\nschool for the first first time and\ninstead of being like oh my god this is\na beautiful moment they immediately\nstarted thinking about oh my gosh what\nif they're what if they're bullied\nright or they watch their kids sleep\ni've heard this many times and they\nthink about instead of thinking about\nhow beautiful they are and how amazing\nthat child is and how lucky they are to\nhave them they interrupt those what\ncould be beautiful thoughts with\nworrying about losing them\nso instead of having a moment of joy\nthey have that moment they hold that joy\nback with worry of what could happen if\nthat person's not always around they\nruin great moments because they worry\ntoo much about being vulnerable of what\ncould possibly happen they don't enjoy\nthe moment too much because they think\nabout what could maybe possibly someday\ndown the road happen in that with that\nperson they don't let themselves fully\nexperience joy\nthey don't let themselves fully\nexperience those joyous moments and\nfully become alive because they don't\nwant the possibility of somebody leaving\nthem\ndying something happening to them\nso once again\nthey put up the armor you have to allow\nyourself to be happy you have to allow\nyourself to feel joy you have to allow\nyourself to be okay with where you\ncurrently are you have to allow yourself\nto be vulnerable stop trying to be\nperfect\nas a self-admitted perfectionist in my\npast that's a hard one for me to realize\nthat i will never be perfect\nright then as quote unquote\nperfectionists which really\nperfectionism if you heard my podcast\nepisode not too long ago perfectionism\nis just a mask that you're wearing the\ncover-up of fear and insecurity we\nbelieve that we have to do things\nperfectly so we avoid and minimize\nall of the things that could possibly\ngive us judgment or shame or any of\nthose things because we have to be\nperfect right perfectionism\nis not self-improvement at its core\nperfectionism is trying to earn approval\nfrom others by looking perfect\nperfectionism is not the key to success\nit actually hampers your success\nand it's correlated with depression with\nanxiety with addiction because we try to\nbe perfect but it's literally impossible\nto be perfect there's no way to do it\nperfectionism is self-destructive and it\nis an unattainable goal and it will hold\nyou back from being vulnerable because\nyou're like i'm not perfect so i can't\nshow people who i truly am you will\nnever be perfect nothing that you ever\ndo will be perfect nothing that you ever\ncreate will be perfect remember this\nquote done is better than perfect\njust do whatever it is you need to do\nanother thing you need to do in order to\nfeel more vulnerable and to be able to\nopen yourself up stop numbing yourself\nwhat do i mean by that i mean smoking i\nmean drinking i mean working too much\nkeeping yourself too busy to actually\nfeel the emotions that you feel\nso many people work their asses off or\nwork too much so they don't have to feel\nfeelings\nso many people drink\nso they don't have to feel feeling so\nmany people smokes they have to feel\nfeeling so many people eat so they don't\nhave to feel feelings people smoke they\ndrink they eat to minimize the feeling\nthat they have of just being this\nvulnerable object that's floating\nthrough space on an organic spaceship\nthat's going to die one day and i don't\njust mean like alcoholics i mean the\ncasual like oh\ntoday was a stressful day i need to take\nthe edge off\ntake a drink or have a smoke right\ni'll just have a glass of wine to relax\nthink about that for a second why can't\nyou just mentally relax and you have to\nhave some sort of substance to relax you\nthere's something going on behind the\nscenes or oh i'll just have a piece of\ncake to relax i deserve it after a hard\nday\nright sorry to say it but that in itself\nis hiding you're hiding from something\nyou're running from feelings you're\nrunning from emotions\nbelieve me everybody does it i do it\nmyself i'm not perfect but we need to be\naware numbing the feeling of the real\nworld because the real world is too much\nfor us to handle at the current moment\nso we can start by opening ourselves up\nif we can start with these steps we can\nstart to feel a real connection between\nus and other people because it's what\nmakes us human it's what makes us\ndifferent you know it makes what makes\nour species\ndifferent than all other species is the\nability to make real deep emotional\nconnections and we as humans we're\nhardwired to want to feel those\nconnections to feel emotion to feel\nspirituality to feel physical touch we\nwant to feel we want to be seen we want\nto feel heard we want to feel be valued\nwe want to give and receive without\nfeeling judgment but in order to do that\nwe have to learn to become vulnerable\nand realize that vulnerability is\nsomething that's going to be powerful\nfor us not something that's going to\nopen us up for harm we need to learn\nthat it's necessary it's a necessary\nthing to be truly happy to allow\nyourself to be seen\nto allow yourself to be open to allow\nyourself to be vulnerable believe that\nyou are enough believe that you have\nenough believe that you're perfect just\nthe way that you are\nin order for you to make real deep\nlasting changes in your relationships in\nyour life realize that somebody needs to\nbe the first to have courage to wake up\nto open up to step up and to be\nvulnerable and have the courage to say\nwhat needs to be said don't be afraid of\nbeing looked down on\nbeing vulnerable is never a weakness\nbeing vulnerable is always a strength\npeople always look up to someone who's\nvulnerable people always want to think\nwant to be courageous and want to be\nvulnerable as well so if you're going to\nchange your life you're going to have to\nrealize\nyou are going to have to be okay with\nletting your armor down because letting\nyour armor down is the only way that\nyou're truly going to feel what you need\nto feel in this world\nso realize that vulnerability\nis courageous vulnerability is power\nand vulnerability will never ever be\nweaknesses or not broken no matter\nwhat's happened to you in your past\nyou're not broken one of the things that\ni see a lot of in my line of work is\ni've seen every type of terrible thing\nthat could possibly happen in this world\nso many different things\nuh from murders to suicides to abuse\nto\nphysical mental emotional\nevery type of sexual abuse rape\neverything that you can think of all the\nterrible things in the world people have\ncome to me and presented to me and i've\nhad to try to help them deal with these\nthings and\none of the things that i find is very\ncommon throughout traumas\nis people have the feeling of being\nbroken they have the feeling of not\nbeing good enough they have the feeling\nof not being whole they have the feeling\nof something being wrong with them and\nwhen i talk about traumas i don't want\nyou to sit there and go well my trauma\nisn't as big as someone else's you know\nmy my life was pretty decent my parents\nwere at least around nobody abused me\nand i want you to realize this there is\nno\ngauge of how\nsevere a trauma is compared to another\none all trauma in the brain is trauma\nand so for you it might not be that you\nwere you know physically mentally\nsexually abused but maybe your dad never\ntold you that he loved you\nmaybe your dad was just working all the\ntime maybe your mom uh was so full of\nfear that she instilled all of her fear\ninto you maybe it was that uh you know\nwhenever you would do something wrong\none of your parents would pull their\nlove away from you\nand you know not give you their love and\nthat was the way they used you can use\nto control you maybe it was you know\nthat that you were just neglected\nemotionally physically spiritually\nwhatever it is from people that were\naround you there's so many different\ntypes of trauma maybe is that you were\nbullied when you were in school there's\nso many different types of traumas so i\nwant you to realize this there's a lot\nof people that have heard the worst\nthings in the world but there's also a\nlot of people that feel like their lives\nwere not that bad and so they don't\ndeserve to accept their trauma as trauma\nthey can look past it not realizing that\nthat trauma that they have is still seen\nas trauma in the brain and so that's\nwhat we're going to dive into today is\nhow to\nheal the feeling of not being good\nenough how to finally feel like you're\nenough how to finally feel like you're\nworthy of love success happiness joy\npeace whatever it is that you truly want\nin this world and\num the thing that i find that's really\ninteresting about the whole thing is\nthat\npeople feel\nlike they're broken like i said they\nfeel like they're not whole they feel\nlike they're not worthy they feel like\nthere's something wrong with them\nand the interesting thing i've i\nremember the first time i ever did this\na woman came out to me and she was\ntelling me a story about some terrible\nthings that happened to her in her life\nand i had to help her reframe what she\nhad was thinking about herself and when\nshe came up and she told me i won't tell\nyou but it was some pretty terrible\nthings and she says i feel like i'm not\nwhole\nand so to help reframe and click her out\nof her story i looked at her and i was\nlike oh interesting and i was looking at\nher legs i was looking her arms looking\nat her and i was like where\nwhat what part of you is missing and\nshe's like what do you mean i was like\nwell you just told me that you're not\nwhole what part of you is missing and\nshe's like well no it's\nand as i i repeated her story that she\nwas telling herself back to her she was\nable to kind of get herself out of the\nstory and realize wait i'm telling\nmyself i'm not whole but there's not a\npart of me that's missing there's not a\npart of me that is it's not like i'm\nmissing a finger i'm not missing a hand\ni'm repeating the story back to myself\nwhich isn't even actually true but\nbecause of the fact i continue to repeat\nthis story i am accepting it as true and\ni'm living my life that way as true as\nwell and one of my favorite things the\nentire world that kind of clicked this\nall into place\nwas three-legged dogs i love\nthree-legged dogs and the reason why\nis because number one they're cute [ __ ]\nwhen they hop around and they hobble all\nover the place right but they're they're\nnever any less happy than the other dog\nthey never are any slower than the other\ndog they never have anything holding\nthem back they they literally have a leg\nthat was chopped off a quarter of their\nlegs are gone\nbut they don't see it as not being whole\neven though physically i guess they\naren't whole right so even though they\nare missing a piece\nthey don't see themselves as less than\nany other dogs they still have the same\namount of joy they still have the same\namount of peace they still have the same\namount of spunk and happiness every\nsingle day but that's interesting\nbecause if you think about a dog that\nloses a leg somebody can have something\nhappen to them in their life and they\nautomatically feel like they're not\nwhole and they accept that pain that\ncircumstance in their life as true and\nthey live out that story forever the\nonly difference is a dog doesn't know\nhow to tell themselves the story of not\nbeing whole you have been able to tell\nyourself the story of not being whole\nand so many humans say i'm broken\nyou know this happened to me in my past\ni'm broken\ni don't feel like i'm enough i don't\nfeel like i'm worthy of happiness or\nsuccess or love or joy or peace i don't\nfeel like i deserve to make the money\nthat i want to or have the business that\ni want to i don't feel like i deserve to\nhave a spouse that loves me fully\nunconditionally and so what happens is\nwe take actions that line up with the\nway that we view ourselves and our\nidentity the way that we view the world\nand so you know someone might have this\nfeeling of i don't deserve love and they\nhave this feeling of i don't deserve\nlove and so when they get into a\nrelationship with somebody who could be\nperfect and amazing they take actions to\nruin that relationship most of the time\nunconsciously so that they ruin the\nrelationship and therefore that person\nleaves them which then lines up with\ntheir paradigm of i don't deserve to\nhave love because we take actions\nwith the identity that we feel that we\nhave whether we realize it or not most\nof the time we don't realize it and so\npeople think oh a part of me was stolen\nyou know this thing happened to me in\nthe past and there's i get it there's\ntons and tons of terrible things that\nhappen to people and i've heard all of\nthem and they're [ __ ] hideous and\nit's terrible these people can do things\nto other people like the things that\ni've heard and the things that i've seen\npeople talk about\nbut they happened and there's nothing\nthat we can do about something that has\nhappened in the past the only thing that\nwe can do is we can think about it\ndifferently and reframe it so that we\ncan then go on and have the life that we\nwant to there's either that option or we\ncan accept you know oh yeah i'm broken\ni'm never going to be whole and it's\ngoing to be like that till the day that\ni die but if you're listening this\npodcast i'm assuming you're the type of\nperson who wants to grow you want to\nimprove you want to get better at\neverything that you do and so now what\nwe need to do is we need to reframe the\nstories that we've been telling\nourselves for so long and\nthat's it all it really is is it's a\nstory\nand it's a fiction story but you're\naccepting it is true and there's a\nfamous quote by a man that says if you\ntell a lie big enough and keep repeating\nit people will eventually come to\nbelieve it\nyou know who said that hitler said that\nhitler said if you tell a lie big enough\nand keep repeating it people will\neventually come to believe it\nsome of us are like the hitlers of our\nown minds we're telling ourselves a lie\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain but we've been saying it for 10 15\n20 30 40 50 years\nso long that we believe that we are not\nwhole we believe that we are not worthy\nwe believe that we don't deserve love\nsuccess happiness and so we believe that\nthere's a part of us missing we believe\nthat we don't deserve to have what we\ntruly want in this world and nothing can\nbe further from the truth but you have\naccepted it as truth only because the\nfact that you've been saying it for so\nlong and so the first thing i want you\nto do is i want you to identify the\nstory that you've been telling yourself\nif this hits home with you if you feel\nlike there's a part of you that doesn't\nfeel like you're enough or doesn't feel\nlike you deserve happiness success love\nthat you're unworthy that you're not\nfully capable of everything that you\nwant to do what is the story that you're\ntelling yourself behind all of that i\nwant you to identify that right now\nand then what i want you to do is i want\nyou to identify how that story is not\nactually true\nfor instance somebody can be\nemotionally abused and because of that\nthey feel like they're not deserving of\nlove because their parents didn't give\nthem the love that they wanted to\nso then you look at that story and you\nidentify the story and then you ask\nyourself how is that not true well just\nbecause i don't feel like i got the love\ni needed to for my parents because i was\nneglected emotionally or physically or\nwhatever it is for my parents\ndoesn't mean that i'm not i'm not worthy\n100 of love\nand what you do is you start to figure\nout the false\npieces of the story that you've been\ntelling yourself and start telling\nyourself the true and empowering story\nthat you want to because you're not\nbroken there's not a piece of you\nmissing\nyou know you are fully whole you've got\nall your toes and fingers most likely\nmost of the people out here that are\nlistening do have all of your toes and\nfingers some of you guys are missing\nthem but you are whole exactly the way\nthat you are either way\nand it's not that you're broken it's not\nthat you're in whole it's not that\nyou're unworthy it's not that there's\nsomething missing it's that you won't\nstop repeating a [ __ ] story to\nyourself that isn't true but you keep\nrepeating it over and over and over\nagain\nand this episode is to number one\nidentify but then also to make you\nrealize i know there's a lot of people\nout there that are now for the first\ntime listening to this and going\noh my god i have been telling myself a\nfalse story my entire life or since that\nevent happened or since that person\nbroke up with me i have been living a\nlie\nand now i want to step into the truth of\nwho i truly am\nif you were to you know i'll give you a\nperfect example if you were to have a\nchild that was here in front of you\nlet's say it's a a three-year-old child\nand every night let's not even not even\nnighttime let's say every single day you\ntell them about the monsters that hide\nin the dark and you tell them the\ndetailed stories about the monsters\nevery single night every single night\nthat child will eventually believe it\nand guess what's going to happen that\nchild is going to have trouble sleeping\nthat trouble isn't that child's not\ngoing to want to sleep alone they're not\ngoing to have the lights off they're\ngoing to be afraid of something under\ntheir bed they're going to be afraid of\nsomething in their closet all because\nyou made up a story about monsters that\nare hiding in the dark how many monsters\nare hiding in the dark of your mind that\nyou need to identify and get rid of you\nneed to remove because there are no\nmonsters that are hiding in the dark of\nthat child's room\nsame way that there are no issues with\nyou you are not not worthy of love you\nare worthy of everything you are whole\nyou are complete you have nothing\nmissing inside of you\nso if you tell a lie to a child they're\ngonna eventually believe it if you tell\nthem enough if you tell a lie to\nyourself then you're eventually going to\nbelieve it if you tell it enough and\nthis is\nsomething that i noticed as much as i\nlove personal development and it's been\nthe number one thing that's changed my\nlife and the number one thing has\nchanged many people's lives that i know\non a very deep level is that a lot of\npeople live their lives very\nunself-aware they're kind of going\nthrough the motions and as they wake up\nand become somebody who gets into\npersonal development they start to\nnotice things that they need to change\nabout themselves to become better and\nwhen they look at those things that they\nneed to change they see those things\nthey need to to change as problems as\ndeficits as ways that they're not good\nenough and so instead of feeling like\nthey're normal and they're up with\neverybody else they look at all of their\ndeficits when they become self-aware and\nthey see themselves as less than\neverybody else because of all of the\nthings that make them you know not\nnormal like everyone else so they think\noh yeah i feel like i'm not worthy so\ntherefore i'm less than everybody else\ni'm not waking up when i want to so\ntherefore i'm less than everybody else\nand they put themselves mentally\nbelow everybody else and so the the\npersonal development journey now doesn't\nbecome a journey of becoming better it\nbecomes a journey of just trying to get\nto normal\nand that's not motivating nobody wants\nto just get to normal but when you\nrealize that everybody that you know has\nsomething that they're dealing with\nsuccessful people unsuccessful people\npeople that you love everybody has\nsomething that you're dealing with you\nrealize that you're on the same playing\nfield there is no difference and to have\nquote unquote because lack of better\nwords issues makes you normal not less\nthan it makes you normal and so\ntherefore when you overcome these little\ntiny things that are holding you back\nand you notice i need to wake up earlier\ni need to have a morning routine i need\nto meditate eat healthier i need to work\nout more when you notice these things\nthat's when you actually start to become\nbetter\nand so\njust just to let you know a lot of\npeople who get into personal development\ndo have those feelings of something's\nwrong with me as they start to see\nthings they need to change about\nthemselves and i want you to be very\naware there is nothing wrong with you\nthere is nothing that you need to try to\navoid there is nothing that you need to\nstay away from and all of these things\nthat you might think are the monsters\nthat are in your closet that make you\nless than you are not less than just\nwant to let you know on the personal\ndevelopment journey i see that happen\nall the time so you're normal exactly\nthat you are if you've been mentally\nphysically sexually abused you're normal\nif you've been neglected you're normal\nif you've been unloved you're normal if\nyou don't feel like you're good enough\nyou're normal if you don't feel like you\ndeserve money and success and happiness\nand joy and peace you are normal\neverybody has somewhat of that different\nit's all the same it's all ice cream\nit's just different flavors we all have\nsome ice cream that's what i want you to\nknow so now that we've identified these\nthings how do we get past it how do we\nwork to become better not to become\nnormal not starting from a deficit to\nbecome normal but to become better\nthe first thing that i'll say is this\nand this is the hardest for a lot of\npeople is to talk to someone\ntalk to someone it doesn't have to be a\ntherapist it can be a therapist it could\nbe a coach it could be a a life coach it\ncould be your fitness coach it could be\nanybody it could be your best friend it\ncould be your spouse\ntalk to somebody why because most people\nthe thing that they're most afraid the\nthing that's really holding them back\nthe most is the thing they're most\nafraid to talk about and shame breeds in\nthe dark\nwhen you bring it to light it no longer\nhas power over you and the more that\nyou're able to talk about it the less\nyou're going to stop crying the less\nyou'll cry and the less that it's going\nto have its power over you and\neventually this thing that has its power\nover you the more that you speak about\nit you gain your power over it and it\nbecomes your superpower i can't tell you\nhow many people i know that have been\nmentally physically sexually abused and\nit's in the dark they don't tell anybody\nbecause they're so afraid of being\njudged and all of these demons that they\nquote unquote demons that they have that\nare hiding in the dark and when they\nbring them to light that becomes their\nsuperpower because they're finally able\nto be open honest and vulnerable and\npeople see them as courageous by doing\nso and so what i want you to realize is\ntalk to somebody shame breeds in the\ndark but if you put light on that thing\nit will make you so much better one of\nthe biggest things for me\nis this podcast when i first started\nthis podcast i had never talked to\npeople about my father being an\nalcoholic i was super embarrassed of him\nwhen i was a child i didn't tell anybody\nwhen my dad passed away i went to school\nfour days later after the funeral didn't\ntell anybody didn't even tell my best\nfriends because i was just so there was\nso much shame around my father when i\nwas a child\nfor me that that was the story that i\nwas telling myself when i started this\npodcast i wanted to be completely open\nhonest vulnerable authentic show all of\nmy [ __ ] to everybody to make them\nrealize that it's safe to show all of\nyour [ __ ] and what i've come to realize\nis that the most therapeutic and the\nmost cathartic thing i've ever done was\ntalk about those things in this podcast\nbecause\nwhat had its power over me i was able to\ntalk about it and then gain my power and\nbecame one of my super brothers to be\nable to be vulnerable and authentic and\nwe're afraid that that if we're\nvulnerable people are going to see us as\nweak but nobody will see you weak when\nyou're vulnerable everybody will look at\nyou and see your vulnerability as\ncourage because everybody wants to\nfigure out a way to get their\ntheir their skeletons out of the clouds\nand be able to speak about it so you\nthink that by speaking about the things\nthat are really tough\nmake you\nweak but that vulnerability people\nactually see as courageous and they\nthink man i wish that i could do what\nhe's doing i wish that i could do what\nshe's doing so the first thing is to\ntalk to somebody about the things that\nyou feel are\nquote unquote not right with you or\nbroken about you unworthy about you the\nsecond thing is to tell yourself a new\nstory so you've identified the story\nyou've been telling yourself now it's\ntime to reframe and to change that story\nso that it doesn't have power over you\nanymore you know stop telling the old\none when you notice that the old one\ncomes back up and you're telling\nyourself again click yourself out of it\nin the moment and go okay hold on i\ngotta tell myself my new story over and\nover and over again and you repeat it\nall day and\nthe more that you tell yourself the new\nstory the more that you're gonna start\nto believe it and unless you're gonna\nstart to believe the other one\nokay number three\naccept it whatever happened to you in\nthe past no matter how bad it was and i\nknow there's some people out there that\nwere listening that have had some\nterrible things happen to them in the\npast i know some people that are out\nthere listening have had some decently\nbad things happen to you in your past\nsome traumatic things some\nsome things happen bullying and it might\nnot seem severe to you but whatever it\nis whatever scale you want to put it on\nwhich is not what the brain puts it on\nit's what us humans like to put some\nsort of scale or degrees of trauma on\nthem\naccept them they happened there's\nliterally nothing that you can do about\nthat right now you can't go back and\nchange what has happened to you the only\nthing that you can do is you can change\nthe way that you feel about it the story\nthat you're telling yourself and reframe\nit as the way that we were saying it so\nnumber three is you have to fully 100\naccept it if i were still sitting here\nwishing that my father were alive and\nwanting to change that story it would\nmake me anxious it would make me sad it\nwould make me frustrated it would make\nme\nfeel\nall the negative emotions that come with\nwanting to change the past and that's\nsomething that i can never do\nnumber four\nthis can be a hard one everybody you\nneed to forgive\nokay forgive whatever it is\nforgive the person that did the thing or\nforgive yourself whatever it is and and\nmost people are like i don't want to\nforgive that person for that terrible\nthing that they did to me because it\nwasn't right by forgiving you're not\nsaying that it's right by forgiving\nyou're actually relieving yourself\nfrom the attachment to that thing that's\nbeen holding you back\nforgiveness is never for that person i\ndon't need you to call them and forgive\nthem i need you to forgive them\nenergetically and mentally and release\nit because that's when you gain your\npower back forgiveness is never for the\nother person forgiveness is always for\nyou so you can release and you can move\non so that's number four and number five\nis to [ __ ] realize that you're not\nbroken you're not you're whole you're\nfully whole you're normal we've all been\nthrough some [ __ ] we've all been through\nstuff we didn't want to\nthere's a pretty good chance that\nsometime in the rest of our lives we're\ngoing to have to go through something\nelse that we don't want to but you have\nto realize that you're not broken you're\nwhole the way that you are there's power\nin going back and taking your message\nmess and turning into your message and\nthere's power in taking your power back\nand saying i'm going to make this\nsomething that's not going to hold me\nback anymore but it's going to propel me\nso many people struggle with self-love\nso many people struggle and we could be\nso cruel to ourselves and not struggling\nin the self-love category is holding us\nback from everything that we want to do\nbecause we're mentally thinking that\nwe're not good enough we don't love\nourselves enough so therefore maybe we\ndon't deserve this life that we want\nmaybe we can't create this life that we\nwant and we need to learn before doing\nanything else how to love ourselves more\nand so what might actually be a better\nphrase than self-love because so many\npeople talk about self-love and so many\npeople struggle with it\nis how can we accept ourselves more\ninstead of self-love how can we have\nself-acceptance\nright because it's not really about love\nit's about acceptance see the barrier to\nself-love\nis self-acceptance\nwe have judgment that we place on top of\neverything but if you were to just clear\nout all the judgment clear out all the\nthings you think about yourself and\nclear out all the negative things that\nyou say below it is self-love the actual\nnatural state of a human is love have\nyou ever been around a child before just\na toddler it's just love and happiness\nand joy but what happens is as we grow\nup we get judged we have you know\nsocietal pressures the way our our\nparents raise us all of these things\nthat can happen advertisements going to\nschool getting bullied and we end up\nplacing all of these judgments on top of\nourselves and the opposite of judgment\nis acceptance so instead of just\nself-love let's talk about\nself-acceptance and why it's so hard for\nus to love ourselves why it's so hard\nfor us to accept ourselves and where it\nactually came from because if we can get\nto the root of it we can start to work\non it because behind all that\nself-judgment is the love that you're\nlooking for\nthat acceptance\nis the doorway to the self-love\nso let's talk about first off why it's\nso hard to accept ourselves\nwell there's a couple things one of the\nbiggest things is the way that we're\nsocialized so you know we have to\nbe socialized by our parents now let me\nsay this before i talk about parents at\nall\neverybody your parents whether they did\nan amazing job or they did a terrible\njob they did the best with what they had\nand children also don't completely\nunderstand the world around them so they\nmight perceive things incorrectly and so\npeople always ask me how can i not screw\nmy children up like i hear that question\nall the time\ni'm going to be honest with you i don't\nknow if there's a way to not screw your\nchildren up because you might be the\nbest parent and i've heard many times\nwith these incredible parents but the\nchild's perception of the parents or the\nway the world works around them was\nactually skewed when they were younger\nand they built their own perception\nwhich took them away from self love that\ntook them away from self acceptance but\nmost of the time what happens is in\norder for us to quote unquote fit in we\nhave to be socialized as child\nas children right parents are under\npressure to socialize you to make you\nfit in right it's not okay to have a\ntemper tantrum and to scream or to run\naround\ninside and have you know you can't just\nrun around and have fun inside of a you\nknow a nice restaurant so you have to\nthat doesn't fit in with way society is\nso a child that doesn't fit in has to\nlearn our social constructs and let me\ntell you why that ends up being such a\nbig thing that really i don't want to\nsay messes people up that kind of messes\npeople up right\none of the things that people don't\nrealize\nas parents\nis that the thing that your children\nworry about more than anything else and\nreally have in the front of their mind\nconsciously or subconsciously is does my\nmom love me does my dad love me right\nand one thing that a lot of people a lot\nof parents don't realize is that\nthey will either give love to their\nchild a lot of times depending on what\nthey do if they do what they want or\nthey accidentally retract their love\nwhich is the scariest thing for a child\nthey retract their love from their\nchildren which make them feel like what\ni'm doing right now my mom doesn't love\nme what i'm doing right now my parents\ndon't love me\nand the children because of the fact\nthat you know us we were all children at\none point in time\nwe don't have any real reasoning process\nfor this the child doesn't fully\nunderstand everything it realizes\nokay the way that i'm acting right now\nwhich is my natural state is not\nacceptable right and obviously the child\na two-year-old or three-year-old is not\nsaying this themselves but subconscious\nis going on i'm playing around i'm\nhaving a whole lot of fun inside of this\nplace but my mom's yelling at me to shut\nup my mom's yelling at me because\nbecause what i'm doing right now is not\nacceptable and they think my natural\nstate\nhaving fun running around being joyful\nmaybe being loud is not acceptable and\nso we learn\nthat what we did was not acceptable so\nmy natural state is not acceptable which\ngets in the way because then we have no\nself-acceptance which turns into no\nself-love right\nan interesting statistic to kind of give\nyou guys an idea about this is that the\naverage child is reprimanded eight times\nmore than they're praised\nright\ni understand as a parent that [ __ ] is\nhard right and you're trying to keep\nyour child alive i get it it's hard\nso but if an average child is\nreprimanded eight times more than their\npraise that means that the average child\nis thinking i'm not good enough\nmore than they're thinking i'm good\nenough\nthey're reprimanded eight times more\nthan they're praised\nso the child is thinking you know and a\nlot of parents reprimand their children\nby you know not whether they're\nconscious of it or not by retracting\ntheir love from them so they're thinking\neight times more than their praise if i\nact this way my mom doesn't love me if i\nact this way my dad doesn't love me and\nso we think the way that i as a child\nthey don't consciously think this but\nthis is kind of under the subconscious\nthere right\nthe way that i am is not okay\nso i have to change the way that i\nnaturally am in order to be okay in\norder to be loved by my parents so the\nchild has to change itself\nit has to let go of certain aspects of\nitself based off of what the parents\ntell them this makes sense to everybody\nnow\nso\nas we grow up in order to be socialized\nin order to fit in we have certain\naspects of ourselves that we have to\nchange in in turn we subconsciously\nthink i'm not good enough that's\neveryone's number one fear in the entire\nworld i'm not good enough lives under\nthe surface of every single fear that\nevery single person has\nwe the reason why i think we're not good\nenough is because as a child we were\nreprimanded in order to be socialized\nbecause there's certain ways that we can\nact and there's certain ways that we\ncan't act\nand we think does my mom love me well\nwhen i do this my mom doesn't love me if\nshe doesn't love me should i love myself\nright these these aren't consciously\ngoing through a child's head but this is\nall subconsciously happening\nso we have to as adults learn to love\nourselves and to accept ourselves even\nif we didn't get it as a child right and\nonce again maybe your parents were\namazing maybe you viewed something\ndifferently because a child doesn't\nnecessarily understand everything so now\nit's our job to kind of pick up the\npieces and to rebuild the way that we\nwant you know we can think as a child oh\nmy gosh i'm having fun i'm running\naround in public and my mom yells at me\nmy dad yells at me therefore this aspect\nof myself is wrong\nthis having fun this running around this\naspect of myself is wrong and i'm not\naccepted\nthe way that i am\nand if i'm at the way that i'm acting\nnaturally is not right\nthen i must be wrong\nmake sense\nit's deep\nwhen you can fully understand this\nconcept number one it's gonna make you a\nbetter parent number two it's gonna be\nable to help you heal your past number\nthree it's gonna help you start to\naccept yourself more\nit's okay\nyour parents are the best they could\nbut also besides parents we have all of\nsociety we have all the advertisements\nwe have bullies in school all these\nthings on top of it so we learn from a\nvery young age during the socialization\nprocess that we're not good enough as we\ncurrently are\nwe realize that we think that and we\ndon't really think that consciously once\nagain it's all subconscious but we must\nact a certain way\nin order to fit in we must act a certain\nway in order to get our parents love\nand even if\nthat way isn't really me\ni'll do it because it's what my mom\nwants i'll do it because it's what my my\ndad wants\nand the result of it is unworthiness\nthe result is the way that i am\nnaturally is not enough\nand so what happens is our personality\nfrom a young age is now built upon\nrepressing who we truly are does that\nmake sense get that for a second our\npersonality from a very young age is\nabout repressing who we actually truly\nare\nat our most natural state and somehow\ni've realized that i'm bad\nand i need to look to my parents to see\nwhat is good i need to look to my\nparents to see what is to get their\nvalidation to see if what i'm doing is\nokay\nbecause in my natural state it's not\nokay\nmy running around is not okay\nand i get it if you're a parent\ni get it believe me they can be loud\nthey can put themselves in danger\nbecause they don't understand but this\nis what's happening subconsciously in a\nchild's head and this is what happened\nsubconsciously when you were younger as\nwell so as we get then we end up getting\nolder and what happens is because we\nlearn\nthat we have to learn from our parents\nwhat is good and what is bad and we have\nto seek their approval then what happens\nis as we get older\nwe have to seek other people's approval\nthe same way same way they were thinking\ndoes my mom love me does my dad love me\nthen we subconsciously think does this\nperson let me do this person let me do\nyou love me you know if i get good\ngrades will i be loved\nif i get number one in the class will i\nbe loved if i get number one on the\nbaseball team well i'd be loved if i\nbeat everybody else in the spelling bee\nwill i be loved you know if i look sexy\nenough for you as you get older will i\nbe loved\nyou know if i do this will i be loved if\ni and the strongest person here will i\nbe loved\nyou know if i get more instagram likes\nwill i be loved if i get more facebook\nlikes will i be loved and you start to\nrealize oh if i make more money will i\nbe loved if i get a nice car if i have a\nnice house if i have nice clothes if i\nspeak a certain way if i come off more\nconfident will i be loved\nand we realize that a lot of the things\nthat we're doing throughout our life\nonce we wake up to this\nis to get other people's approval\nwe're trying\nto do or become anything that will make\nus feel accepted sometimes\nthat's why school can be so hard because\nwe're trying to fit in so that we can\njust feel loved and accepted by other\npeople the issue\nis that we're seeking validation for\neverything outside of us\nand if you're seeking validation outside\nof you you're never going to find true\nvalidation because true validation comes\nfrom yourself\nin loving yourself and fully accepting\nyourself nobody outside of you so it's\nkind of like the acceptance and the love\nthat we're looking for from ourselves\nwe're actually trying to find in other\npeople thinking that that's going to\nsolve the problem that we actually have\ninside of ourselves\nnot your looks\nwill not change how you feel about\nyourself your money will not change how\nyou feel about yourself your cars will\nnot change how you feel about yourself\nyour job your title your body your\nsocial media following your social media\nlikes none of those things will actually\nchange the way that you feel about\nyourself\nand you have to realize that\nthe only way to truly love yourself is\nto realize that as you currently are\nnothing needs to change\nwhat needs to change\nhas nothing to do with you it has\neverything to do with your acceptance of\nyourself\nyou have to learn first off before you\nchange anything and before you become\nthe person that you want to become you\nhave to fully love yourself and actually\ntake that back fully accept yourself\nas you are\nif you're short if you're fat if you're\nskinny if you're broke as hell\nif you've ruined all of the\nrelationships in your life whatever it\nis you have to learn to go\nall right\ncan i love myself can i accept myself\nright now\nall of my negative thoughts can i accept\nmyself all of my short temper can i\naccept myself acceptance\nfirst no judging this is who i am\nthis is where i'm working off of this is\nmy baseline\nand i love you for who you are rob\ncan you say that to yourself\nyou know the thing that's interesting is\nthat we can judge the hell out of\nourselves and we can judge the hell out\nof other people but we don't really\njudge anything else besides ourselves\nand other people like you don't walk\ninto a forest and just start judging the\ntrees you know you got a fat one you got\na short one you got a skinny one you got\na broken one you just look at them and\nyou just accept them and appreciate them\nfor what they are right\nbut we judge ourselves and we judge\nothers ah this person's better than me\nthis person's worse than me i'm better\nthan that person and what we're trying\nto do is we're trying to\ndo that out of our own insecurities for\njust\nbeing accepted\nright we live in a state of constant\njudging whether that's judging ourselves\nor whether that's judging others am i\ngood enough am i not good enough do i\ndeserve love do i not deserve love you\nhave to allow yourself to just be a\nhuman being\nyou have to allow yourself to just be a\nhuman being be who you truly are learn\nto accept yourself as you are all of\nyour flaws all of your fuck-ups you're\nnot achieving all the things that you\nlost all the things you do the money\nthat you don't have\nall of that stuff you have to accept\nyourself for that the person that's\nunder all of the makeup the person\nthat's behind all of the edited social\nmedia posts you have to rediscover who\nyou are\nand think to yourself\nbefore i lost this innocence\nbefore i was socialized who was i\nwhat was my true heart as a child what\nwas my true soul as a child how was i\nright like if i think back to myself\nbefore you know life happened before\nbullying happened before seeing\nadvertisements that made me feel like\ni'm not enough who was i i was just a\nsweet little quiet kid\ni used to go get rocks and bring them to\nmy mom and get flowers and pick flowers\nand give it to her i was just a quiet\nkid and then i learned\nwhat was right quote unquote right what\nwas wrong\nall of that stuff\nand once again it's nobody's fault it's\nnot your parents fault it's not your\nfault any of that stuff but it's about\nrediscovering who are you\nwhat do you love maybe part of the thing\nis you've you've gone down a path of\ndoing things that you don't love because\nyou've been seeking acceptance from\nother people from your parents because\nthat's what you thought they wanted you\nto do what the ones you go to school for\nmaybe because you wanted to make money\nto impress people or to have security\nbut it's a real rediscovering of who you\nare and the question that goes to that\nis what do you love what do you love to\ndo\nwhat makes you excited what makes you\nfeel alive\nyou know children don't do anything that\ndoesn't make them feel\nalive or that they don't think it's fun\nunless they're forced to do it\nlet's take all the forcing that you've\nbeen doing for the past 15 20 30 40 50\n60 years and go\ndamn it what do i love\nwhat makes me feel alive\nand what i want you to do is make a list\nof it write all that down\nand do more of that wake up every\nmorning and look at that piece of paper\nand say how can i bring more of this\ninto my life\nthe path of self-love and\nself-acceptance is to do more of the\nthings that you actually like i don't\ngive a damn about what anybody else\nthinks about you what anybody else says\nabout you what you should and shouldn't\ndo\ndon't care about that what do you want\nto do man what do you want to do woman\nwhat makes you feel alive\ndo more of that stuff you have to learn\nto fully accept yourself there is\nnothing that you need to do there's no\none that you need to prove yourself to\nthere's no change that you need to make\nthere's no weight that you need to to\nlose in order to be loved in order to be\naccepted\nthe path to self-love\nis self-acceptance\nand at some point in time\nyou learned that as you were was not\ngood enough\nsomething happened i don't know what it\nwas\nit's different for all of us maybe it\nwas your parents maybe it wasn't maybe\nit was cool maybe it wasn't maybe it was\nsociety maybe it wasn't maybe it was\ninstagram i don't know there was some\npoint in time where you broke off and\nsaid as i currently am is not good\nenough\nyou need to go back\nthink about that think about how you\ncurrently are and say how can i accept\nmyself more because under all of the\njudgment is all of the self-love you're\nlooking for you don't have to work for\nself-love you just need to remove all of\nthe things all the judgments that are\ngetting the way of self-acceptance\nbecause when you can fully accept\nyourself\nin all of your glory\nthat's when you find that you already\nlove yourself\nhey thanks so much for watching this\nvideo if you want to learn even more\nabout mastering your mind click right\nhere and watch this video as well you\nare your abuser let me say that again\nfor everyone in the back you are your\nabuser if you talk down to yourself\nyou're your abuser you are the abuser"
