phrase lie down\nwith dogs stand up with fleas well\nimagine the world is the dog and the\nnegativity in the world the fleas being\nimmersed in so much negativity can\nimpact your mental health whether you\nthink so or not so you can protect\nyourself and your mental health here are\nsix possible Reon reasons your mental\nhealth is\ndeteriorating past trauma we've\npreviously posted some videos about PTSD\nPTSD can be caused by exposure to a\nheavily traumatic experience because of\nthe severity of this past event your\nbrain tends to react the same way to\nsimilar situations past trauma can also\nbe a cause of deteriorating mental\nhealth in 2015 a group of researchers\nfrom the University of West England did\na study to find out about the mental\nhealth deterioration of people after\ntheir home was flooded they found that\nunderstanding the individual's mental\nstate and concerns pre flooding were\nimportant to determining how their\nmental state was impacted post flooding\nultimately those who already had a\nnumber of stressors present before the\ntraumatic event occurred had more mental\nhealth\ndeterioration no mental health education\nin the past decade or so mental health\nhas gone from being taboo to so widely\naccepted that we're able to have YouTube\nchannels likey to go completely\ndedicated to mental health education\nbecause of this mental health\ninformation education has become more\navailable it's become so widely\nacknowledged that companies like Johnson\nand Johnson Google and Retail Me Not are\ncreating Mental Health Resources for\ntheir employees even high schools are\nincluding psychology courses in the\ncurriculum and have counselors available\nto students lots of free resources\nsounds amazing right according to\nJennifer dimoff and Kevin Callaway even\nthough there's an abundance of resources\navailable in the workplace a lot of\nemployees don't take full advantage of\nthese benefits when used researchers\nfound that employees could exhibit\nbehavioral changes for up to 3 months\nwhether it's therapy sessions reading a\npsychology book or watching your\nfavorite psyo video it's all mental\nhealth education not using these\nresources to learn about yourself may be\na reason for your mental health\ndeteriorating increased strange Behavior\nevery mental illness has its own\ncharacter istics this is why it's pretty\noffensive to assume someone who has a\nmental illness isn't intelligent or sane\nDr Kad gasin and Dr Gavin dagley did\nsome research for the Australian\nCommission on safety and quality and\nHealthcare through this research they\nfound that an increased loss of touch\nwith reality or even an ignorance to\nconsequences can be a huge red flag of\nmental health\ndeterioration let's say you have a\nfriend who's had the same daily routine\nfor as long as you've known them it\nmight be a bit weird if they start\ntrying High adrenaline activities like\nbunge jumping especially if they never\nshowed any interest in them maybe you\nhave a friend who's pretty rational and\none day they start talking about hearing\nthe mailbox talk to

of\nadults at some point in their lives even\nthough they are treatable anxiety\ndisorders come with their own set of\nsymptoms in Fall 2020 an internet-based\nstudy was done on self-reported physical\nand mental health deterioration due to\nthe covid-19 pandemic Not only was there\nthe concern of getting sick or dying but\nthere were people being let go from\ntheir jobs causing Financial strain some\nwere working lots of overtime causing\nburnout due to job loss or other factors\ncaused by the pandemic some people were\neven evicted these additional stress\nfactors have caused

health\ndeterioration and that it's time to PR\nprioritize where do you live take a look\nat your neighborhood is it clean what's\nthe crime rate like are there lots of\nthings to do in 2007 Daniel Krueger\nThomas Rachel and Gilbert G did a study\nto determine the correlation between\nmental health and one's neighborhood\nconditions this study's findings were\nvery similar to the findings from
