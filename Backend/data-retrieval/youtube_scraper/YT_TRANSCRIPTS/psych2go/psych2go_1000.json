    "transcript": "hey sectacores do you think that red\nflags only apply to romantic\nrelationships\nwell they can also apply to friendships\ntoo relationships are special bonds we\nform with others and these bonds are\nmodels for new relationships and teach\nus what works and what doesn't but there\nmay be times when we overlook certain\nnegative aspects because we hope that\nthe relationship will work itself out\nif so you may find it hard to let go of\na friend or partner because it means\nadmitting that you made a poor choice\nand trusting that person but if a\nrelationship is or has turned toxic it's\nbest to leave before you end up even\nmore hurt so here are a few red flags to\nlook out for in any relationship number\none they only want you around when they\nneed something from you\nyour role in a relationship is not as a\ntherapist or problem solver and you\naren't only there to fix their problems\na friend who only calls you when they\nneed something from you does not\nconsider you a friend but more like\nsomeone who fixes problems this is a red\nflag because it unbalances your\nrelationship they may expect you to\nshoulder their responsibilities and\ncould hold you accountable for the\nthings that happen in their life\nnumber two they isolate you from others\nrelationships are not an excuse to be\npossessive if a friend or partner begins\nto demand more time from you monitors\nyour activities or show signs of being\ncontrolling then that is a sure sign\nthat you should do your best to make\nsure the relationship is short-lived\nnumber three they never put in the\neffort\nhealthy relationships are reciprocal if\nyour friend or partner treats the\nrelationship like an emotional support\ntrust fund it's not a relationship it's\na business transaction that benefits\nonly them\nthere might be relationships that you\nwant to preserve because there's a lot\nof history and if that's the case talk\nto them let them know how you're feeling\nand attempt to create a space where your\nneeds are heard and met\nbut if they persist and refuse to listen\nor accept you\nmaybe it's time to walk away if you are\nhaving difficulty backing away from this\nrelationship reach out to a therapist\nnumber four\nthey're quick to complain about you\nno one likes their flaws pointed out to\nthem except maybe when it involves\nconstructive and educational criticism\nbut pointing out someone's flaws and\ntrying to make it seem like you're\ntrying to help is shady in a\nrelationship the people you enter into a\nrelationship with should not be coddling\nbut accepting and understanding of who\nyou are and what you want to achieve\npeople who only point out your\nshortcomings are toxic and monthly\nabusive so try to avoid developing a\ndeep relationship with them\nnumber five they monopolize the\nrelationship as said relationships are\nnot one-way streets two people connect\nthrough shared thoughts ideas and\nobjectives\nbut when one party begins to monopolize\nthe relationship it's a sign that\nthey're no longer interested in what the\nother person brings to the table if that\nperson chooses to remain in a\nrelationship they're doing it with the\nsole purpose of fulfilling their\npersonal needs\nmaybe try talking to the person first to\nlet them know how you feel but if they\npersist and try to monopolize\nthen you gotta leave and number six they\ndon't treat you like their friend\nthis last red flag can be a bit subtle\nbut it includes all the previous points\nrelationships including romantic ones\nhave a degree of friendship involved you\nboth should treat each other kindly and\ncare for each other and also be able to\ntrust and be vulnerable with each other\nif your friend or partner does not\nattempt to establish trust or\ncamaraderie\ntry to talk it through both of you\nshould be willing to create trust\nbetween each other but if they're\nreticent they've made their position\nclear\nand you should consider leaving you\ndon't need to be in a relationship with\nsomeone who does not respect trust or\naccept you\nrelationships can seem easy\nbut can also be unexpectedly difficult\nto maintain can you relate to any of\nthese points share with us in the\ncomments\nplease like and share this video with\nothers who may benefit from it and as\nalways the references used are listed in\nthe description below until next time\ntake care and thanks for watching"
