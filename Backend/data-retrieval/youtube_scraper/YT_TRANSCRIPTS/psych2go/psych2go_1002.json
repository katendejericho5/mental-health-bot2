    "transcript": "hey sectgoers thank you for joining us\nagain\nhave you ever been gaslip before how'd\nyou feel\nchances are you felt like you were\nlosing your mind\nyou might have been confused about\nevents or things that the other person\ndid\nmanipulators use different tactics to\nget you to believe them and abandon\ntruth and fact\nin 1987 researchers defined the six most\nused tactics by manipulators as charm\ngiving the silent treatment coercion\nreason regression and debasement\nlet's take a look at what these tactics\nare and some phrases that a manipulator\nmay use to make you feel crazy\nnumber one\noh but you're so good at it\nthink back to when you were a kid when\nyou were about to ask for something from\na parent but you knew you had to make\nsure they were in a good mood to get\nthem to say yes\nso what do you do you start\ncomplimenting them\nwow mom last night's dinner was really\ngood and your hair looks amazing today\nby the way can i go over to my friend's\nhouse on saturday\nin this situation it's innocent in the\ncontext of a manipulator they may ask\nyou to do something that you don't want\nor feel comfortable doing but when you\nresist the manipulator they may tell you\noh but you're so good at it to butter\nyou up and get what they want this is\ncalled charm and it may not always be\nsincere this can make you second guess\nwhat actually happened and make you feel\nnuts number two\nthey say nothing at all i think we're\nall pretty familiar with the silent\ntreatment this is a common manipulation\ntactic to punish the other person for\nnot going along with them\nsay you wake up on your birthday and\nyour partner doesn't say anything you\nmight be upset that they didn't say\nanything about your birthday in return\nyou might not answer any texts calls or\nspeak with them until they wish you\nhappy birthday\nyou may feel like you're getting even\nbut this is actually toxic think about\nthe other person they may be racking\ntheir brain driving themselves crazy\ntrying to figure out what they did to\nupset you so much only to come up with\nnothing\nnext time you want to get the silent\ntreatment try the complete opposite take\na moment to explain what the person did\nor didn't do that upset you number three\nyou better do it or else coercion is a\nfancy way of using threats intimidation\nor blackmail to get someone to do what\nyou want this unfortunately comes in\nmany forms and can cause all types of\nstress\nlet's say you have a friend who asks to\ncopy off you so they can pass an exam\nyou feel really uncomfortable doing this\nso you say no your friend is upset and\nsays you'd better let me copy off you or\nelse i'll tell your parents you skipped\nschool last week\nthis person is using coercion to\nconvince you to let them copy your\nanswers even though you don't want to\nin this situation the manipulator may be\nbluffing just to get what they want\ntrying to weigh the pros and cons of\neach option could make you feel like\nyou're losing it and cause you to make a\ndecision just to get it over with\ndon't let them bully you make things\nhappen on your terms\nnumber four\nyou should do it because\nmanipulators live in details\nwe saw a lot of this in the johnny depp\nversus amber heard trial\nwhen someone wants you to do what they\nwant or believe them they will tell you\nwhy you should do it and slap on a few\ndetails to make it believable\nthis manipulation tactic is called\nreason\nlet's say it's your roommate's turn to\ntake the garbage out but they don't want\nto\nthey might say i know it's my turn to\ntake the garbage out but i moved 57\nboxes of paper at work today that each\nweighed around 40 to 50 pounds i can't\ntake the garbage out could you do it\nexplaining why and adding the details\ncan really paint a picture to convince\nyou to go along with their idea and this\ncan really make you feel crazy or even\nlike you're an awful person for not\nhelping\nif this happens to you you can still be\npolite and empathize and hold your\nground\ngreat job on dodging another\nmanipulation tactic\nnumber five you still haven't done it\nhave you ever promised a young child\nsomething and forgotten about it\nof course not because they don't ever\nlet you forget\ntry telling a kid that you'll take them\nfor ice cream after school and not do it\nthey will let you know\nmanipulators tend to do the same thing\nthey use regression whining until what\nthey want happens to speed up the\nprocess almost like they're regressing\nback to their childhood phase\nsay your partner asked you to fix the\npantry door\nyou say you will but you don't do so\nimmediately\nyou might be reading when your partner\nsays\noh i see you're reading did you finish\nfixing the door\nmaybe you're playing your favorite video\ngame when they say you still haven't\nfixed the door but you have time for\nvideo games and on and on they whine\nuntil finally you just do it to get them\nto stop\nnow you begin thinking about how lazy of\na person you must be and feeling out of\nyour mind that you can't do anything\nright\nhas your parent friend or partner ever\ndone this to you\nwe suggest communication and letting\nthem know your plan this way they stop\nbringing it up\nwhat are some of your strategies to stop\nregression share in the comments below\nand number six i'm too weak i can't do\nit could you\nthe final manipulation tactic found is\nthe basement this is when the\nmanipulator makes themselves look weak\nor lesser than they actually are to\ntrick someone into doing something for\nthem a common scenario where debasement\nis used is when carrying heavy things\nlet's say you went grocery shopping and\nsomeone has two full hands of groceries\nthey might start struggling or\npretending to stumble they know if\nanyone is watching there's a good chance\nsomeone will help them\nand if you know the person putting on\nthis charade you might feel confused and\nguilty what if you're downplaying their\nstruggle you start to question your\nreality\nnope you saw the truth you're not\nresponsible for their work but if you'd\nlike to help but don't want to be\nburdened with the entire task\nyou can always offer to take a couple of\nbags for the person to make the trip\neasier you avoid being manipulated into\nthe whole task and they get some help\nit's a win-win\ndid you relate to any of these\nmaybe you thought of someone in your\nlife who uses them\nthese aren't all of the tactics that\nmanipulators use there are a lot more\nout there to make you feel equally crazy\nbut we hope this gave you a good idea of\nsome manipulation tactics if you feel\nlike you're being manipulated reach out\nto a trusted mental health professional\nor a friend to talk about the situation\nyou are important and have boundaries\nthat deserve to be respected by everyone\nif you found this video helpful like and\nshare it with friends that might find\ninsight in
