    "transcript": "a relationship a partnership you know\nyou want it\nyou know their hard work and you know\nyou want one anyhow just like any\nimportant life event though we all know\nthe hardest part is the startup\ndo i stay or do i go are we all happily\nmilling around in the friend zone or are\nwe missing obvious signs here's what to\nlook out for to see if you've moved\nbeyond buddy into the realm of interest\nnumber one\nthey really want to be around you all\nthe time\nsure we hang out with our friends we\nchat with them text with them some of\nthem you casually touch base daily\nbecause smartphones am i right but even\nwith your bestie do you really want to\nbe there with them all the time\nprobably not\nif you notice a friend's increase in hey\nlet's meet up suggestions or even that\nthey're always sitting up the next time\nyou'll hang out while you're currently\nwith them they just might have a thing\nfor you you might be thinking wait maybe\nthey're just doing this because they\nhave nothing better to do okay that\nleads us to the second point number two\nthey make you a priority over others\nit's not that they have no life it's\nthat they're putting aside other things\nso that they can focus on what's\nimportant and that means you\nlisten and observe for signs that\nthey've chosen to spend time with you\ninstead of something else you know is\nimportant to them\ndid they just bail on their weekly\ngaming session to hang with you i think\nthere might be some springtime all up in\nthe air\nnumber three they are scientifically\naffectionate\nfor science see science is always with\nus trust the science there was a study\ndone that revealed five indicators that\nwhen they were all present together it\nmeant that the person was scientifically\nin love they are\nempathy like when they're there at your\nlow point\nwanting to be around them like in all\nthose frequent hangouts\nsharing their feelings time even their\nfries\nsacrifice\ngaming session what gaming sessions they\nchose you instead\njoy\nthis should be obvious but they're\nsignificantly visibly happy being around\nyou\nwow so there is a love potion number\nnine it's just not necessarily made in\nthe lab\nthere's been a huge decline in mental\nhealth around the world which is why\nwe're so committed to creating more\ncontent than we ever have thanks for\nbeing a part of our journey number four\nthey be touchy feely and we don't mean\nthis in a creepy way\nthink more of the showbie movie way we\nknow you're thinking i don't watch\nrom-coms but you've seen this in any\nmovie where there's possible sexual\ntension\nthe pool shark offering to teach the\nperson how to hold the cube properly\nthe golf expert wrapping their arms\naround the person to make sure their\ngrip on the shaft of the club is correct\nand there was so much innuendo there you\ncan't miss it\ncome on we all know they weren't needing\nthat much instruction\nsame goes for someone who might be\ninterested a buddy might be like yo you\nhave something on your cheek and then\nkeep it moving the interested one might\nsay the same then reach over and gently\nbrush your face with their fingertips to\nwipe the smudge away number five they\nask for your opinion on things this is a\nbigger deal than you might realize\nthink of it this way would you ever\nvoluntarily ask the opinion of someone\nyou disliked didn't trust or didn't\nrespect\nprobably not they're asking you for your\nopinion means that they trust you're\nbeing honest and that your thoughts are\nvalued\nthey might even be doing some indirect\nresearch to see if you're a kindred\nspirit\nnumber six\nthey get a bit steamy around you\nno take the smoke machine away not that\nkind of steamy\nthe term hot under the collar blushing\nthe song fever that's what we mean\nblushing is a great indicator but it's\nnot always visible due to complexion\ngenetics or full coverage makeup\nbiologically there is blood rushing to\ntheir skin which means a rise in\ntemperature\nlooks like they've got a fever and the\nonly prescription is you\nand number seven they mirror your\nactions if you have a younger sibling\nwho annoyed you by copying your\nmovements and words\nmirroring is not that mirroring is\nsubconscious like attracts like it's\nwhen you're walking with that someone\nand you notice you're walking in step\nwith each other or you cross your arms\nwhile talking and notice\nthey now have their arms crossed too\nthat's their brain subconsciously\nprodding them to in an odd way\nphysically empathize with you because\nthey like you and they very likely\naren't aware of it did anyone come to\nmind when you heard these points\ndid you think of yourself doing this\ntowards someone\ndo you think you see a sign but aren't\nsure if it is\nplease comment and discuss below you\nnever know what insight you might gain\nabove all love is a good and wonderful\nthing so even if it's not showing up\nhere and now keep these signs in mind\nfor the future and carry on\nwhile you're love crusading though\nplease tap that like button on the way\nthanks for watching and we'll see you\nsoon\nyou"
