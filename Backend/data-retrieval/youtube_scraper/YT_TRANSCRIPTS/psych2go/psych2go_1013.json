    "transcript": "what was your childhood like\nwell for most of us childhood was a\nsimple and carefree time not everyone is\nlucky enough to have that some may have\nexperienced trauma at an early age\nrobbing them of their sense of safety\nand security\ndefined as the experience of a single or\nmultiple event by a child that is\nemotionally painful or distressful\nstudies show that childhood trauma often\nleads to serious lifelong damages to\none's mental and physical health\nhave you ever wondered how such\nexperiences could impact a person\nwell there are a lot of ways childhood\ntrauma can impact you here are the main\nways it can shape your view on life\nnumber one it makes you more pessimistic\nhow do you see the world\nmany studies have proven that people who\nhave experienced a traumatic event\nespecially when they were younger are\nmore likely to be pessimistic\nthey often generalize their traumatic\nexperience into a generalized negative\nexpectation of the world which makes it\nmore difficult for them to see the\npositive side of things or trust that\ngood things will happen\ninstead they internalize their unhealed\ntrauma until it manifests as either\nself-blame passive helplessness or a\npessimistic worldview\nnumber two it makes you feel more alone\na lot of research tackles the\ndetrimental effects childhood trauma can\nhave on a person's mental and emotional\nwell-being but what we don't often\nrealize is that these detrimental\neffects can trickle down to impact our\nview of not only ourselves but of the\nworld in general too\nhow well childhood trauma is known to\nincrease a person's likelihood of\ndeveloping depression and anxiety as\nwell as making them more vulnerable to\nfeelings of guilt and shame this\nnegative self-view then makes victims\nmore socially withdrawn and as a result\nsuffer from lower levels of social and\nemotional support and poor quality of\ninterpersonal relationships\nnumber three it makes you self-sabotage\nsimilar to the previous point a person\nwho's experienced childhood trauma may\nbe more likely to self-sabotage\nespecially when it comes to their\nrelationships\nin fact studies have shown that a large\nmajority of those who have suffered\nabuse or violence related childhood\ntraumas go on to develop adult\nattachment disorders\nmost of them have a hard time\nmaintaining long-term relationships be\nit platonic or romantic because of how\ntheir trauma has distorted their view of\nhuman nature\ninstead of believing in a person's\ninnate capacity for good they've learned\nto fear their capacity for evil and\ndeceit which makes them less trusting\nand more likely to self-sabotage\ncreating problems where there might not\neven be one\nnumber four it takes away from your\nsense of safety and security\nhave you ever wondered why some people\nwho've experienced trauma end up\nstruggling with it for years even long\nafter it's already over\ntrauma of any kind can have lasting\nphysiological damage and when you\nexperience it at such a formative time\nof your life such as in childhood\nit can take years to unlearn and undo\nbeing traumatized takes away a person's\nsense of safety and security which is\ncrucial to a child's development because\nit's what bonds them to the significant\npeople in their lives and encourages\nthem to explore the world and fulfill\ntheir potential\nwithout their sense of safety and\nsecurity they might grow up to become\noverly timid anxious fearful or overly\nattention and approval seeking\nand number five\nit hinders your ability for meaning\nmaking some of the most widely used\npsychological treatments given to\nvictims of trauma include cognitive\ntherapy narrative therapy and logic\ntherapy all of which focus on helping\nclients make sense of the trauma they've\nexperienced and create positive meaning\nout of it because victims of trauma\nstruggle with this the most it's often\nwhat keeps a lot of them from moving on\nand healing from their painful past\neven though traumatic experiences are\nusually unexpected uncontrollable and\nseemingly random\nwe still try to make sense of it anyway\nbut in doing so it can distort our way\nof thinking so much that victims often\neither victimize themselves where they\ntake away their own sense of agency and\nbeing able to do something about their\ntrauma or blame themselves for what\nhappened so have you or someone in your\nlife experienced a childhood trauma\nlet's change the way you view life\nif you are struggling with your mental\nhealth in any capacity please don't\nhesitate to reach out to a mental health\ncare professional today and seek help if\nyou found this video helpful be sure to\nlike subscribe and share this video with\nthose who
