    "transcript": "there has been a huge decline in mental\nhealth around the world which is why\nwe're so committed to creating more\ncontent than we ever have thanks so much\nfor being a part of our journey\nhow do you see yourself\nare you very critical of how you look or\nbehave\nwhen talking about things that can\ndestroy your self-esteem your first\nthought may be to do with the effects of\nsocial media or toxic friendships\nbut that's not all\nthe way you view and speak to yourself\ncan also play a very big role you might\nnot even be aware of some of these\ntendencies such as thinking in a\nself-deprecating manner so to help you\nhere are seven things that are\ndestroying your self-esteem\nnumber one\nassuming other people's opinions of you\ndo you always think you know how someone\nfeels about you\nlet's say you have a friend who's\nsuddenly acting differently than normal\nwould you jump the gun and believe that\nit's you who caused their change in mood\nthis form of overthinking can be\ndamaging to your mental health and\naffect how you see yourself\nremember that not every negative thing\nhas to do with you\nperhaps they were just having a bad day\nor are thinking about someone else\nassuming their bad mood is your fault\nmay be a thought process caused by bad\nexperiences in the past so don't forget\nto take it easy and reassure yourself\nwhenever the instinct and patterns\nrepeat themselves\nit may also be good to surround yourself\nwith understanding and supportive\nfriends who can reassure you in times\nwhen you feel insecure number two\ncarrying long-term emotional baggage\neveryone goes through bad experiences in\none way or another and while it's not\nthat easy to let go of them these\nunresolved mental hurdles can really\nstick with you and hinder your growth\nit's important and healthy to take your\ntime but when you're ready to take\nanother step forward it's good to start\nmaking peace with your past\nremind yourself that your previous bad\nexperiences don't define you as a person\nthey're just memories\nthrough forgiveness peace and acceptance\nyou can let go of its power and hold\nover you\nnumber three\nletting yourself go\nwhen was the last time you had a proper\nhealthy meal do you often sleep late and\nload up on junk food\nit's easy to take yourself for granted\nbut what most don't realize is that\nthese small things can add up over time\nand become habits you end up sending\nyourself a mental message that you are\nnot worth the effort then this can lead\nto hopelessness\na good tip on rewiring your mindset is\nby thinking if you treat someone you\nrespect like you've been with yourself\nis this how you would take care of your\nfriend\nif it isn't then perhaps your body is\nlacking the pampering it needs\nyou could try to adopt just one good\nhabit for yourself and stick to it take\nnote of how you feel and continue the\nprocess until it becomes a sustainable\nroutine\nultimately there is no such thing as a\nperfect lifestyle a realistic goal\ninstead is to feel better in your own\nskin and to develop a good and healthy\nmental state\nnumber four being an unforgiving\nself-critic\ndo you tend to obsess over your flaws no\nmatter how small they are\naccording to itamar shots a phd\ncandidate at cambridge university the\nact of magnifying the degree to which\nminor flaws in your appearance may be\nnoticed or judged by others is called\nthe spotlight effect\nthis near-constant habit of worrying\nover your flaws can be harmful to your\nself-confidence and self-esteem since it\ncan lead to negative thinking patterns\nthis preoccupation with your\nimperfections may also cause you to not\nfocus or do any of the activities you\nwant to enjoy\nso if you find yourself getting worked\nup over it all the time you can try to\nrecognize when you're having these\nmoments and follow up with reassuring\nand kind affirmations\nmost of the time we are our own worst\nenemies by learning how to rewire our\nself-deprecating habits we're slowly\nbuilding a better outlook on ourselves\nnumber five complimenting others while\ncomparing yourself secretly\nhow do you feel when you see others\ncelebrate their accomplishments\ndo you praise them through gritted teeth\na lot of people especially women tend to\ndo this but it can be very damaging to\nyour self-esteem\nit's a form of self-sabotage because the\nmore you're complementing their good\ntraits the more you're contrasting them\nto your own and once you feel that\nyou're not the same as them you end up\ndeveloping a negative self-image\nif you truly want to compliment someone\nbe genuine about it not everything is a\ncompetition\nif this is something you really struggle\nwith it may help to keep a gratitude\njournal\nin time you may learn to see yourself in\na kinder light\nnumber six\nyou tend to use always and never\nare you the type of person who makes\nextreme statements perhaps you say\nalways wash the dishes or never want to\nwatch that show although it sounds\ntrivial these permanent sounding words\ncan make your statement sound final and\nmake you feel like you can't do anything\nto change them\nwhat if you wanted to skip the dishes or\nwatch that show chances are you feel\nlike you can't do these things because\nit feels irrevocable which can lead to a\nloss of confidence and a sense of\nhopelessness\nit's helpful to remember that in your\nlife there are always opportunities for\nrandom spontaneous moments\nso as much as possible try avoiding\npermanent words and don't be afraid of\nopening yourself up to new experiences\nand number seven\nignoring your emotional signals\ndo you try to understand your feelings\nor avoid them\nrejection and abandonment are\ncontributing factors to a lack of\nself-confidence after all if you don't\ntry to understand where your own\nemotions are coming from chances are you\nwon't be able to cope or handle them\nproperly\nfeelings are feelings they are automatic\nand tend to happen whether you like them\nor not for this reason it's good to\nacknowledge and identify why you're\nfeeling that certain way if you're sad\ntry to give some time for yourself to\naccept understand and cope with it if\nyou're happy try to determine why and\nshow gratitude for it having a good\nunderstanding of your own emotions may\nlead to a boost in confidence\ndid you relate to any of these points\nlet us know in the comments below if you\nfound this video helpful be sure to
