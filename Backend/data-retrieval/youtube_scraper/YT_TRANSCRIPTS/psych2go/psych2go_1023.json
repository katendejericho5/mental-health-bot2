precursors for physical abuse\nthese are psychological and emotional\nabuse although intangible psychological\nand emotional abuse can greatly damage a\nperson sometimes even more so than\nphysical abuse here is a list of signs\nthat you've been emotionally abused in\nthe hopes to help with early\nidentification of abusive relationships\nnumber one withdrawal withdrawal can\nmanifest in many forms it can look like\navoiding eye contact showing fear or\nhesitancy towards others or a specific\nperson it can take the form of isolation\nwhere the person doesn't go out or speak\nto anybody emotionally abused people\nwithdraw to feel safe it may also be to\ntry to avoid or become invisible to the\nabuser in hopes that the abuse will stop\nbut withdrawal can lead to other serious\nphysical and psychological problems if\nit's done for too long it might develop\ninto another mental illness or make the\none already present worse number two low\nself-esteem and worthlessness low\nself-esteem and worthlessness can be\nexpressed verbally with phrases like i'm\nnot good enough or worthy enough i don't\nmatter nobody listens to me or some\nvariations of those to identify that low\nself-esteem or worthlessness is a\nproblem the person has to be constantly\nsaying these things another way this can\nmanifest is in a refusal to participate\nin things that they used to enjoy or not\ndoing rituals that they used to do every\nnight or every morning number three\nchanges in appetite or weight some\nabusers take control to the point where\nthey start keeping tabs on what the\nother person eats then they try to\nconvince the other person to change\ntheir diet in most cases these changes\nin diet are not healthy and keep the\nvictim in a weakened state the abused\nperson may keep this mentality even\nafter the events have transpired because\nthey are still convinced that this is\nthe right thing to do that they'll\nbecome fat and ugly if they do not\ncontinue with it or that something bad\nwill happen if they don't\ndo you relate to these three signs so\nfar let us know in the comments below\nemotional abuse is one of the most\ndifficult

to\nminimize whatever conflict they think\nmight come when the anxiety the fear or\nthe trigger becomes too much it may cry\nuncontrollably crying can also be in\nresponse to flashbacks or thinking about\nbeing punished or abused again for\nmaking further mistakes it can also be\nexpressed as anger instead of sadness in\nangry outbursts that may or may not make\nany sense this is all those suppressed\nemotions and feelings of violation\ndeveloped throughout the abuse coming\nout because they finally feel safe\nenough to let it all out number five\nblaming themselves for things is it\nnormal for you to apologize to inanimate\nobjects like a chair or a sofa after you\naccidentally bump into it do you blame\nyourself for small things or things out\nof your control the abuser often tries\nto shift all blame and guilt onto the\nvictim making them believe that it was\ntheir fault that things went wrong after\nsome time of repeating this and supposed\nreinforcement of outside

abusers know that\nwhat they're doing is wrong and they are\naware of the consequences of their\nactions which is why they look for ways\nto prevent their victims from getting\nhelp one of those ways is to make them\nbelieve that the police are bad or\nsomething bad will happen if they call\nthem it is a well-known fact that not\neverybody likes the police for different\nreasons still there is something to be\nsaid when it comes to extreme fear\ntowards them it could be possible that\nthis person could have had a bad\nexperience with the police that left\nthem traumatized but if you know
