Yeah.\nGiving food to your\npartner may just make them\nfeel something more for\nyou, according to a study\npublished in the journal\n\"Frontiers of Psychology.\"\nThe study suggests that food\noffering thus provides a way\nof coping with distress\nand empathic concern,\nas well as an effective means\nof offering social support,\nresulting in increased positive affect\nacross interaction\npartners and an increase\nin interpersonal closeness.\nBasically, buy them a burger and fries\nalong with your roses.\nIt shows them that you care.\nNumber six: Love them.\nI mean, you do love them, right?\nIt's important that you don't\nsimply just desire the feeling\nof being loved but actually\nlove your partner back.\nIf you want someone to love you,\nyou need to first ask\nyourself, \"Do I love them,\nor are you just craving the\nperks of feeling loved?\"\nReciprocated love is the best kind.\nAnd number seven: Love yourself first.\nIf you want a strong and\nhealthy relationship,\nthe best thing you can\ndo is to love yourself.\nYou want someone to love you,\nbut do you give yourself enough love?\nIt's important to practice\nself-love, self-appreciation,\nand the act of caring for yourself.\nIf you are content and\nhappy with yourself first,\nit will only give off\nconfidence and an aura\nthat will attract your perfect partner.\nSo remember, even if your partner\ndoesn't end up falling in love with you,\nyou can always fall in love with yourself.\nSo are you in love,\nand do you have a hunch\nthat your partner is in love with you too?\nTell this in the comments down below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\ndon't forget to click the Like button\nand then share this\nvideo with your partner.\nThey may just love you for it.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAs always, thanks for watching."
