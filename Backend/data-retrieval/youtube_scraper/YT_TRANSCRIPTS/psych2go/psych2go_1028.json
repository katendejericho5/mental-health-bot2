    "transcript": "so you just got your crush's phone\nnumber and the texts are starting to\nsend out and roll in\nwell\nkind of\nyou haven't received that many texts\nback from them so are they really\ninterested in you how can you tell\nthrough text\nor maybe the person you're dating\nsuddenly changes through texts\nperhaps they seem friendly or flirty in\nperson but through text you send\nsomething different\nhere are six texting signs your crush is\nnot actually into you\nnumber one their energy is off or\nsuddenly different from yours do you\ntext that person you like with great\nenthusiasm\nare you always the one with energy in\nthe conversation\nwhile everyone is different and not\neveryone has the same enthusiasm while\ntexting\nif you notice a sudden change in their\nattitude through texts this could be a\nbad sign\nit's not a bad idea to ask them about it\nif you've known each other for a while\nif there's someone new and you notice\nthey never text as much enthusiasm or\nenergy back with you they may not like\nyou as much as you like them\nor maybe they just have as much\nenthusiasm as good old cousin larry\nhe's just\nnot into texting much\neveryone shows their enthusiasm\ndifferently so it's good to get a\nbaseline for what their normal behavior\nis but generally when we like someone\nwill be pretty excited when texting them\nor setting up a time to hang out\nor at least have the same energy of how\nwe feel about each other\nnumber two they don't initiate the\ntexting you do\nare you always the one to initiate the\nconversations with them\nare they never texting you first\nthis is often a sign they aren't as into\nyou as you had hoped\nif you want to get to know someone you\ngenerally want to start to text them or\nat least set up a time to hang out to\nwell get to know them when we really\nlike someone and the texting has already\nbeen initiated we'll likely text them\nfirst with a new conversation starter a\nfew times and hopefully they'll text us\nwith some too\nnumber three they always take a very\nlong time to respond\nhow long does it take for your crush to\nrespond to your texts\nminutes\nhours\ndays\nweeks people can have busy lives and\nyour crush will likely let you know if\nthey've been busy or couldn't respond\nright away but if they generally ignore\ntheir week-long absence from their phone\nit might be that they don't view you as\na potential romantic partner that they\nwant to get to know\nnumber four their texting focus is\nalways on physical intimacy and not\nemotional\nwhen your crush texts you you can't help\nbut notice every conversation always\nleads to the topic of physical intimacy\nrather than emotional intimacy\nthe question is are they interested in\nyou as a romantic partner or as a casual\npartner\nif their techs are more focused on\ngetting to know you as a person as well\nas a bit of flirtation they probably see\nyou as a potential long-term partner\nbut if they only text about physical\nintimacy they might not be interested in\nyou seriously\nnumber five they don't text back any\nquestions and they don't keep the\nconversation going\ndoes your crush ever text you any\nquestions\ngo back and look for those question\nmarks people\ngenerally if we admire someone and want\nto be their friend or more than friends\nwe're gonna keep the conversation going\nthat means not only asking questions to\nstart up a new conversation or topic but\nalso asking follow-up questions when\nyou've said something thoughtful or\nserious\nif you've just delved into the meaning\nof life the existential questions that\nkeep you up in bed at night and they\nrespond with a good ol\nk\nthen they're not for you\nit's time to move on to brighter\npastures fresher milk attractive\nfarmhands\nnumber six their texts and replies to\nyou are short one-word responses\nremember the dreaded k\nwell they've got a cousin a bunch of\nthem the dreaded emoji response it's not\nso bad if you've been having a good\nconversation and it's now dwindling down\nyou've got lasagna in the oven and they\nhave a cousin larry coming over with a\ndeep dish pizza you can't talk forever\nbut if all they do is respond to your\nthoughtful texts or questions with an\nemoji then it's not looking too good\neven as a friend always responding with\na simple emoji when you're having a\ntexting conversation isn't the best if\nthey respond with short responses or\none-word responses\noften\nespecially to your flirt attempts that\ncould mean they're not into you\nromantically but may want to still be\nfriends who knows\nperhaps let them know how you feel or\nask them on a date and see if they feel\nthe same way about you on an emotional\nlevel\nsometimes they may just feel\nokay or have a burnt lasagna in the oven\nthey need to get to larry turn off the\noven we're getting pizza\nso does your crush seem to like you over\ntext do they respond to the emojis have\nyou ever received the dreaded k from\nthem\ndo you have a lasagna in the oven\ni wouldn't want to be texting too if i\ndid we hope you enjoyed this video
