    "transcript": "hey psych2goers there has been a huge\ndecline in mental health around the\nworld which is why we're so committed to\ncreating more content than we ever have\nthanks for being a part of our journey\nhave you ever been in a relationship and\nthought that it's too good to be true or\nhave you ever wondered if your partner\ntruly means it when they say they love\nyou these are normal things to wonder\nespecially when you're starting off in a\nbrand new relationship but how do you\nknow when it's your subconscious trying\nto tell you something is wrong let's\ntake a peek at six signs someone is\nfaking their love for you number one\nthey don't talk about or plan a future\nwith you when you're in a relationship\nyou're with that person because this is\nsomeone you can see yourself committing\nto when you find that person you want\nthem to be a part of everything\nespecially big events\nwhen they start to make plans about the\nfuture that includes you they're really\nshowing their love for you\na partner that may be faking love may\nnot include you in events future plans\nor even in their day to day\nthese actions show a clear boundary\nbeing made in the relationship to keep\nthe two partners separate this may be a\nsign that the love isn't genuine\nnumber two they can talk the dog but\nthey won't ever walk the walk\nhow do you know your partner loves you\nhave you heard the age-old saying\nactions speak louder than words you\ndon't have to say you love me just show\nme\nthe words are bonus points you can do a\nlot for each other to let the other know\nyou love them think about your partner\nwhat was the last thing you did to show\nthem you cared\nif all you can think about is the time\nthey told you or maybe even texted you a\nquick i love you this may be a sign that\nyour partner is faking their love for\nyou number three you're feeling a lot of\nnegativity from the relationship\nwhen you're in love and feeling loved by\nyour partner your brain goes crazy with\ndopamine the neurotransmitter that\nassists in feeling pleasure because your\nbrain is increasing the amount of\ndopamine created you feel happier more\nsatisfied and content but when you\naren't receiving that true love from\nyour partner you may not feel in love\nand may not be getting that on cloud\nnine vibe\nyou may start to feel insecure unhappy\nunlike you're walking on eggshells\ntrying to do the right thing to get your\npartner to like you\nrelationships should never feel this way\nand you should never have to do things\nor be a certain way to earn a person's\nlove care or affection if you're\nnoticing more negative feelings than\npositive ones around your relationship\nplease reach out to a trusted counselor\nor therapist to discuss these feelings\nnumber four your partner thinks love is\nan emotion\nmost of us grew up on disney movies then\ngraduated to rom-coms and this is where\nwe got our ideas on love that it's this\nmagical thing that feels like a warm hug\nthat never lets go\nbut that's not what love is at all\nin a study done at the university of\nlaguna in spain enrique boronot\nexplained that love is a complex mental\nfunction which has been found to\ninteract with other mental functions\nsuch as memory attention perception to\ntaste and reasoning\nit's even been shown to affect health\nlove is entangled in every other\nfunction of our brains when you are in\nlove your whole body and brain know it\nif your partner thinks that love is an\nemotion and isn't feeling anything they\nmay try the fake it till you make it\nmethod\nthis may be a sign it's time to talk to\nyour partner about the relationship and\nhow love is shown number five they don't\nmake any effort\nrelationships take two each person needs\nto put in the effort to show that they\ncare about the other person but they\nalso need to show that they're growing\nas a person independent of the\nrelationship\nif your partner doesn't show any effort\nto try in the relationship nor any\neffort to be better themselves or their\nsituation this could be a sign of them\nfaking their love for you this can also\nbe a sign of their negative feelings\ntowards themselves manifesting into\nself-sabotage\nand number six there's either no pda or\nall the pda\nwhen you're alone with your partner what\nis your body language like are you all\ncuddles all the time or are you always\nsitting on different sides of the room\nwhat about when you're in front of\npeople\nchances are it's all or nothing\nno pda that's public displays of\naffection alone paired with no pda in\nfront of people usually points to little\nor no feeling in the relationship\nanother common reaction to being around\npeople is showing an increased amount of\npda this is to convince themselves and\ntheir audience that the love is actually\nthere\nanother example would be how you're\ntreated alone versus in public a partner\nwho isn't being totally genuine might be\nloving caring and attentive to you while\nthey're around people but once you're\nalone they may start arguing with you\ndegrading you or being rude in other\nways\ndid any of these points remind you of\nyour partner do you relate to any of\nthese points yourself\nwhat are some things you'd like to do to\nshow your partner they're loved let us\nknow in the comments below the\nreferences and studies are shown in the\ndescription until next time take care\nand thanks for watching\nwant more signs of spotting fake love\ncheck out our video 8 signs of fake love"
