    "transcript": "I've been there, you've been there,\nwe've all been there.\nA big test or a\ncompetition is on the line,\nand you know you've put\neverything you had in preparation,\nand yet you still don't\nget the result you want.\nYou don't feel good.\nYou feel you've failed.\nPsych2Goers, first and\nforemost, let's define failure.\nIf you're expecting something\nsuper clean and clear,\nsorry to say, it's not.\nFailure is a subjective\nthing, as is success.\nEvery person defines it\ndifferently for themselves.\nFor example, an\ninteresting take on failure\nwas stated by Thomas Edison, who said,\n\"I have not failed 10,000 times.\n\"I've successfully found 10,000\nways that will not work.\"\nThe definition is based on\nyour values and expectations,\nand you are unique to you.\nSometimes, though, we let outside parties,\nlike friends or family, define it for us.\nDespite our very definitions of failure,\nthe one common thing that we all share\nis the initial feeling\nof failing really sucks.\nSo let's look at several ways\non how we could change our\nperspective on failure,\ntake the edge off the sting,\nand make it work for us.\nNumber one: failure is\nyour biggest teacher.\nSociety really pushes emphasis on success\nand tends to ignore failure.\nThink of all the perfect lives we see\nposted everywhere on social media.\nHowever, this does not provide\nany depth of knowledge,\nthus, benefit anyone.\nAccording to a research\nconducted by Madsen & Desai,\nfailure can be your\nbiggest teacher in life.\nThe research found that\nknowledge gained from failure\nlasts longer and is often more impactful\nthan knowledge gained from success.\nThis can be illustrated\nwith the flights of the\nSpace Shuttle Atlantis\nand the Challenger.\nIn 2002, a piece of the\nSpace Shuttle Atlantis\nbroke off and caused damage,\nbut the damage didn't hinder the mission.\nAs a result, there was little\nfollow-up or investigation\nfollowing the incident.\nA year later,\nduring the flight of the\nspace shuttle the Challenger,\nanother piece of the\nspace shuttle broke off\nthat was somewhat similar to the Atlantis.\nBut this time, disaster ensued,\nresulting in the death of the astronauts\nand violent destruction of the shuttle.\nThis tragic incident prompted\na major investigation,\nwhich resulted in 29 recommended changes\nto prevent future disasters.\nIn essence, failure can really be seen\nas an alternate term for\nlearning opportunity.\nNumber two: failure teaches\nyou to be kind to yourself.\nLet's imagine.\nWhat if your life is only made\nof a constant stream of success?\nEverything you do or try\njust falls into your lap,\nand you've known nothing but\nriches, wealth, and comfort.\nYou've never had to pull\nyourself up from an abyss\nor struggle to improve.\nWhen we never truly experience\nthe grit of failure,\nthis encourages taking\neverything for granted.\nYou don't think, you just float along.\nFailure gives us the push\nto reevaluate the important\nthings in our lives.\nWho are you, and how\ndo you define yourself?\nIt's a great chance for\nyou to be kind to yourself\nand practice self-compassion.\nInstead of judging and self-approving\nbased on the materialistic\nor what you've done,\nyou learn to accept yourself\njust for what you\nalready are at your core.\nDr. Kristin Neff, a strong\nadvocate for self-compassion,\npublished a study.\nBased on that study,\nstudents who practiced self-compassion\nafter failing in an exam\nwill proceed to study\nharder for future exams.\nNumber three: you can know success\nonly if you've experienced failure.\nThere is no light without the dark.\nWe've heard the phrase,\nbut what does it mean?\nSimilarly, by experiencing failure,\nyou will obtain a better\nperspective on success.\nThe accumulation of failures over time\ngives you an increasingly better sense\nof what will probably work\nand what probably won't work.\nAnd success is built upon this knowledge.\nThis very perspective\nmakes basketball superstar Michael Jordan\nthe athlete that he is today.\nHe says, \"I've missed more\nthan 9,000 shots in my career.\n\"I've lost almost 300 games.\n\"26 times I've been trusted\n\"to take the game-winning shot and missed.\n\"I've failed over and\nover again in my life.\n\"That's why I succeed.\"\nNumber four: failure isn't\nalways really failure.\nDid you know some of the most\ngroundbreaking inventions\nwe've had happened when the inventors\nwere researching something\ncompletely different?\nSome of these include super\nglue, microwave ovens,\npacemakers, and even penicillin.\nEssentially, they failed\nat their original goal.\nBut considering what came out instead,\ncan you really call that failure?\nAnd number five: failure\nis a step on the journey,\nnot the end of it.\nWhen you are faced with failure,\nthis usually does not mean the end.\nFailure is a real and common experience.\nHowever, barring extreme circumstances,\nit's not a termination,\nit's part of the human condition\nand a natural occurrence\nthat preps you to achieve\nsuccess in the future.\nEver shop or browse online?\nYou've probably heard of Jack Ma,\nco-founder of Alibaba Group.\nThe journey to the top\nwasn't some fairytale golden path, either.\nIn a public event,\nhe told the story of multiple\nfailures in his life,\nwhich included being the sole individual\nnot to get a job at a fast food joint,\nrejection at being a hotel server,\nand applying to Harvard 10 times\nwith a sound rejection each time.\nJack Ma reflected that the\nexperiences of these failures\nprepared him for the path\nto becoming a CEO later on.\nFailure is a chance to learn.\nAnd although it doesn't\nfeel very good at the time,\na change in perspective\ncan help turn it into a climbing hold,\ninstead of a rock blocking your path.\nWe understand, though, that sometimes\nwhen you face failures in your life,\nyou may become debilitated.\nThese can hit you hard.\nNow that you know bouncing\nback is a very real option,\nseek professional\nassistance if you need it\nso that you can continue\nonwards and upwards.\nIf you
