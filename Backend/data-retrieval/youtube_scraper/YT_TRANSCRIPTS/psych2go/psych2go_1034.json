    "transcript": "have you ever met a sociopath psychopath\nnarcissist or dark empath before\nwell this video could be the ultimate\nduel between super characters to\ndetermine who wins the title of most\nharmful\nthese personality disorders have dark\ntraits or characteristics that make them\ndangerous to the people around them in\nvarying degrees\nsome personalities are more aggressive\nthan others some conceal themselves\nbetter than others but what they all\nhave in common is their manipulative\ntraits while they all manipulate people\nto get what they want each has their\nunique way and reason behind why they do\nit so let's explore each dark\npersonality type briefly before going\ninto which one could be the most harmful\nto your mental health number one\nsociopaths\nhailing from the spectrum of antisocial\npersonality disorder which by the way is\nnot just preferring pizza over people\nand weighing in with a weak conscience\ncoupled with a weak sense of empathy we\nhave the sociopath\nthey know they're wrong yet find\njustifications instead of being good\nsociopathy is characterized by but not\nlimited to\nclearly don't care how others feel\nattachment issues unpredictable\nhot-tempered behavior\ntheir low empathy and weak conscience\nmakes lying and disregarding others in\npursuit of their own needs easier\nwhen confronted with consequences of\ntheir actions they react negatively by\nshowing spitefulness and recklessness\nsociopathy is a chronic condition that\ncan be acquired by harsh family dynamics\nsuch as parental instability or sexual\nabuse\nlet's look at our next contender\npsychopaths\nalso hailing from the spectrum of\nanti-social personality disorder and\nweighing in with zero empathy is the\npsychopath any outward justification for\ntheir actions is for performative\npurposes only psychopathy does have some\ndifferent specs from its brethren\nsociopathy where the sociopath is an\nerratic volcano the psychopath is a\nsilent black frozen abyss\nthe sociopath will show they don't care\nbut the psychopath will convince you\nthey do when they really don't\nspotting a sociopath is easy a\npsychopath makes it a point to appear as\nnormal as possible while hiding in plain\nsight the pros say that to diagnose a\nsociopath look for what's showing on the\noutside\nto diagnose a psychopath it's much more\nbased on what's happening on the inside\nand why\npsychopathic qualities like recklessness\nand aggressiveness are caused by a\nchemical imbalance in the brain not\nupbringing\none of their weapons is a non-automatic\nemotional response to others they can\nchoose to understand how someone feels\nif it benefits them\nwhile they like sociopaths are not\nnecessarily violent they lack the\nregular restraints and protections of\nempathy and conscience\nto prevent them from becoming violent\nnumber three narcissists the narcissist\nis the diva with the most ego they\nbelieve everything is about and for them\nbut snarking you're such a narcissist\nwhen someone acts kind of douchey\ndoesn't mean they have the disorder\nto a true narcissist confidence limits\nand basic affection are now\nself-superiority self-entitlement and\nthe expectation of praise and servitude\nin their minds they get extra because\nthey are extra everyone else is a tool\ntoy or toaster to be used until they're\nno benefit to the narcissist then\nthey're discarded according to one\nclinically confirmed case narcissism is\nself-defense in the pursuit of four\nprimary goals\nfuel\ncontrol\ncharacter traits and residual advantages\nthe fuel is whatever emotion they can\nevoke from you\nemotion vampires narcissists savor every\nounce\nthey enjoy having control over how you\nfeel\nthey steal character traits co-opting\naspects of another person and passing\nthem off as their own\nmoney sex and contacts are all residual\nbenefits from their supply this\nexploitative behavior stems from\nchildhood trauma\nit could have been formed by being\nsmothered in protection and placed on a\npedestal or by being in an unstable\nenvironment\nand now the surprising fourth\ndark empaths this term introduced in a\n2021 study marks this contestant as a\nyet untested newcomer\nin this study it was discovered that\nthese people tend to score high on\nempathy but also high on dark triad\ntraits like narcissism machiavellianism\nand psychopathy the dark empath could be\ndescribed as a black mirror version of\nourselves\nthey have everything the other\npersonalities lack especially empathy\nyes empathy\nbut the dark empaths empathy is\ncognitive only empathy means if you hurt\ni hurt\nthe dark empaths cognitive empathy means\nthey fully understand the pain they\ncause\nthey just don't feel it\neven if they've been directly hurt in\nthe past\nthey intuitively get how others work and\nfeel so like a thief with all the\nblueprints and passwords\ntheir manipulations are devastating\nfor them with great power comes great\nwrongness\nthere's the bell to the round and\nthe disorder that wins the title of most\nharmful to your mental health is\nhonestly between the psychopath and the\ndark empath it's a toss-up or is it\nthe psychopath has the zero empathy\nattack they have no restraints of\nconscious or empathy and take advantage\nof others without remorse\nthey relax your defenses by acting\noutwardly normal that's dangerous\nwhat about the dark empath then\nthis could be the most dangerous\npersonality type because the dark empath\ncan intuit as opposed to study what\nother people are feeling this makes\naccurate manipulation far easier for\nthem\nif you don't believe dark empaths are a\nthing\nthe singular type of personality that is\nmost dangerous would be the psychopath\nwho is unshackled by conscience\nhowever\nif you believe that the dark empath is\nan entity unto itself\nthen this is the winner\nbeware their machinations as they have\nthe ability to tune in and focus attack\nthrough empathy\ncomment down below with your thoughts on\nwhich is the most harmful and why you\nbelieve it is so\nalways remember too that despite these\npersonalities being a psychological\nphenomenon which may or may not be\nconscious choices\nif you are the target you are never\nunder any obligation to accept abuse\nstay safe and we'll see you soon"
