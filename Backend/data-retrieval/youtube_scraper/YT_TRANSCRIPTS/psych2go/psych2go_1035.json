    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hi, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to the next video.\nHave you ever wondered how\nto tell if someone is smart?\nSometimes we think they look smart,\nor it's how they act,\nor how they do their job.\nBut we can't see intelligence\nand we can't test it accurately, either.\nYou don't have to be good\nat school to be smart.\nAnd there are two main things\nthat make people smart.\nThey know they don't know everything,\nand they want to keep learning.\nWith that said, here are seven signs\nyou may be intelligent and not know it.\nNumber one, you are curious.\nOne trait of intelligence is curiosity.\nSome people are motivated\nby money, fame, or prestige,\nbut smart people wanna\nknow more about something.\nAccording to a study by\nGoldsmiths University in London,\nlearning affects your cognitive function\nand growth in a positive way.\nBut it's not enough to learn something.\nYou have to be open to\nlearning something new.\nAccording to the Journal\nof Individual Differences,\ntraits such as curiosity\ncorrelated with those who\nscored higher on IQ exams,\neven though IQ tests\naren't all that accurate.\nNumber two, you are open-minded.\nLike curiosity, open-mindedness\nis another trait\nintelligent people have in common,\nsays a 2008 study from Yale.\nOpen-mindedness and intelligence\nrefers to a willingness\nto see from different perspectives\nbefore making a judgment.\nSeeing from different perspectives\nallows you to gather more information\nso that your final\ndecision is well-informed.\nNumber three, you are messy.\nMany people would assume\nthat intelligent individuals\nare rigid and highly organized.\nWhile it may be the case for some,\nmany intelligent folks are messy.\nBut an aversion to tidiness\ndoesn't mean you are intelligent.\nThe reason messiness is\nlinked to intelligence\nis that being messy provides ideas.\nPutting things that appear\ndissimilar next to each,\nsuch as a tennis ball and a coffee pot,\ncan offer you ideas\nthat you might have not thought of before.\nNumber four, you are good\nwith being by yourself.\nMany people believe that\nsmart people are introverts.\nWhile this can be sometimes true,\nonly some intelligent\npeople are introverted.\nBut regardless of your MBTI\nor degree of comfortableness\naround others,\nintelligent individuals are content\nwith spending some time alone,\nwhich allows them to\nprioritize and to plan.\nNumber five, you talk to yourself.\nIf you talk to yourself,\ndon't worry about weird looks from others.\nIt just means you might be a bit smarter,\nas talking out loud to yourself\ncan be a sign of intelligence.\nA study by psychologists Paloma Mari-Beffa\nand Alexander Kirkham of Bangor University\nshowed that talking to\nyourself denotes self-control,\nwhich is a form of intelligence.\nWe all have thoughts\nracing through our heads,\nso speaking them out loud\nhelps to organize them\nand conveys measured concentration.\nNumber six, you are funny.\nHumor is a great intelligence indicator,\nbecause it's about\nunderstanding social events\nand distilling them into\nsomething that strikes a chord\nwith the person hearing the joke.\nA study from the University of New Mexico\nfound that comedians and comics\nscored higher in verbal intelligence.\nNumber seven, you are not convinced\nthat you are intelligent.\nLastly, many intelligent individuals\nare convinced that they\nare not that intelligent,\nmainly because they know\nthey have much more to learn.\nWhether you were able to\nfind some of these traits\nin yourself or not,\nremember, we all have\ndifferent types of intelligence\nand this isn't a fixed trait\nand it grows over time.\nCan you see yourself\nin any of these points?\nLet us know in the comments\nand share this video with\nothers who might like it.\nAs always, the references and studies used\nare listed in the description.\nUntil next time, friends,\ntake care and thanks for watching."
