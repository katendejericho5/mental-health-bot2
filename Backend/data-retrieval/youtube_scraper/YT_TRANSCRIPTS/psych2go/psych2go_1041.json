Are you a creative person?\nDo you like to adventure\nout of your comfort zone\nand have new experiences?\nThese are just a few traits in people\nwith high levels of openness.\nGenerally, people who\nare open are just that,\nthey're open to new ideas and\nlike to explore creatively.\nIf you are not a very open person,\nyou may find you're more\ntraditional, liking concrete facts\nover abstract ideas, and you like things\nto stay the way they are.\nHere are a few signs of high openness:\nYou prefer and embrace\nabstract concepts and thinking.\nYou enjoy creative\nendeavors and innovation.\nYou enjoy new activities and hobbies.\nAnd here are a few signs of low openness:\nYou're a concrete thinker\nthat prefers solid facts\nover more freeform ideas.\nYou prefer tradition and\nkeeping things the same.\nYou're rigid in routine and practices.\nUp next is C: Conscientiousness.\nAre you someone who is highly\norganized and goal-oriented\nand always on your game and\nprepared to take on challenges?\nThese are all indications of a high level\nof conscientiousness.\nConscientious people have\na good sense of control\nover themselves and their surroundings,\nand they make sure to have a\nplan for what they may face.\nPeople who are less conscientious\nmay be more unstructured,\ndisorganized, and tend to procrastinate.\nHere are a few signs of\nhigh conscientiousness:\nYou're schedule-oriented and goal-focused.\nYou have an eye for detail and\ntake care of the small stuff.\nYou plan for your future\nand are ready to take on challenges.\nAnd here are a few signs\nof low conscientiousness.\nYou're disorganized and cluttered.\nYou're careless and impulsive.\nYou leave things until the last minute.\nE is for extroversion.\nDo you find yourself more\nstimulated by social situations,\nand do you enjoy a conversation\nand having a giant circle\nof people near you?\nThese are signs of extroversion.\nExtroverted people are\nenergized by socialization\nand are happy to go out.\nPeople low in this\ntrait are more reserved,\nprefer their own company\nor smaller parties,\nand may be more thoughtful\nin what they say and do.\nHere are a few signs of high extroversion:\nYou enjoy being the center of attention.\nYou're people-oriented in\nalmost every situation.\nYou speak before thinking.\nAnd here are a few signs\nof low extroversion:\nYou prefer solitude.\nYou're drained by socialization.\nAnd you're careful with words\nand think before speaking.\nA: Agreeableness. How are\nyou with other people?\nDo you find it easy to connect with others\nand share with them?\nDo you enjoy helping\nand caring for others?\nThese are attributes of people\nwith high levels of agreeableness.\nWhile they don't have to\nbe the most extroverted,\nthey do find value in others\nand want to connect with them.\nPeople low in agreeableness\ntend to be more competitive,\nblunt and opinionated.\nHere are a few signs\nof high agreeableness:\nYou enjoy creating\nconnections with others.\nYou're empathetic and compassionate\nto other people's needs.\nYou contribute to the community.\nAnd here are a few signs\nof low agreeableness:\nYou're callous towards others.\nYou're bitter and antisocial.\nYou manipulate others\nto meet your own needs.\nAnd finally N: Neuroticism.\nHow would you describe\nyourself emotionally?\nAre you someone who tends to worry a lot\nand has difficulties dealing with stress?\nThese are indicators of\nhigh levels of neuroticism.\nPeople high in this trait\nmay be more sensitive\nand need support in hard times.\nThose low in this trait\ntend to be more relaxed,\nresilient, and collected.\nHere are a few signs of high neuroticism:\nYou're moody and emotional.\nYou have low tolerance to stress.\nYou're always on high alert.\nAnd here are a few signs\nof low neuroticism:\nYou're calm and collected,\neven under stress.\nYou're easygoing.
