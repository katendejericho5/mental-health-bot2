    "transcript": "- [Amanda] After a long day at work,\nyou receive a call from a friend.\nThis is a friend who\nwas nowhere to be found\nwhen you needed her,\nbut she constantly asked you for favors.\nYou dread these phone calls,\nbut you still pick up.\nHey, Susie, what's up?\n- Hi, I need you to send me your homework.\nI forgot to do mine.\n- [Amanda] This is the sixth\ntime that this has happened.\nEven though you're exhausted from work,\nand you hate it so much\nthat she constantly asks you for favors\nthat she is capable of doing herself,\nyou reply, yeah, of course,\nI'll send it over now.\n- Thank you.\n- [Amanda] You just wish\nthat she would grow up,\nand realize that she is\nresponsible for her own life.\nBut if you hate it so\nmuch, why did you say yes?\nIt's because you're a good person,\nand you don't wanna cause\nany conflict, right?\nThe truth is no.\nEven though you think that\nyou're doing this out of kindness\nand care for your friend,\nthe truth is you are\nbeing unkind to yourself,\nnot giving yourself the\nself-respect you deserve.\nSo now, what is self-respect?\nHere are eight pillars of self-respect.\nSee how many you cross off.\nNumber one, I'm my own best friend.\nHaving self-respect means\nknowing how to respect\nand befriend yourself.\nShowing others that you treat yourself\nthe way you treat someone you love\nis one of the strongest\nsigns that you have\na high level of self-respect.\nBeing kind and caring,\nand maintaining a healthy\nrelationship with yourself\nare all great habits to practice,\nto have more self-respect.\nOthers who see this are\nmore likely to treat you\nwith more respect,\nbecause gaining respect from others\nstarts from having self-respect.\nNumber two, I know my priorities.\nWhen faced with difficult situations,\na person with self-respect\nsticks to their priorities.\nFor example, let's say you have a choice\nbetween attending a party\nthat might heighten your social status,\nor staying home and babysitting\nyour younger sibling\nthat you promised your parents you would.\nIf keeping the family\nobligations is a higher priority\nthan increasing your social status,\nyou may choose to keep\nyour responsibilities,\nand sacrifice the fun for the time being.\nNot only would you be\nreinforcing to yourself\nthat you have self-respect,\nbut others will also respect you\nfor being confident in your decisions,\nand not being swayed\nby outside influences.\nNumber three, I respect others.\nThose with high respect\nshow respect to everyone,\nregardless of class, age,\ngender, sexuality, et cetera.\nCEOs and political leaders\nknow that showing respect\nto those in less powerful positions\nis one way to gain respect from others,\nbecause they have enough self-respect\nto know they gain others respect\nby the way they treat others,\nnot purely through their\nhigh level positions.\nNumber four, I know when I'm in the wrong,\nand can show humility by apologizing.\nOne of the best combinations\nfound in the most self-respecting leaders\nincludes both confidence and humility.\nRemember that knowing\nyou are always growing,\nand have room for improvement\nis a sign of self-respect.\nNumber five, I maintain\nhealthy boundaries.\nA self-respecting person\nunderstands that their time\nand energy are valuable.\nThey're more likely to invest\nthose things in people,\nand activities that bring\nthem true fulfillment.\nInstead of cutting out\ntoxic people from life,\nor immediately going\ncold turkey on activities\nyou know don't support you,\nfind ways to gradually create boundaries\nthat'll help bring you more inner peace.\nWith practice, you'll\nlearn to trust yourself\nin weeding out what is\ntoxic from your system.\nAnd with more self-trust\ncomes more self-respect.\nNumber six, I stand by my\nvalues, regardless of a witness.\nTrue self-respect is holding\nyourself to values, morals,\nand ethics, whether or not\nothers are there to witness.\nWhen your words and actions\nare rooted in integrity,\nyou will naturally gravitate\ntowards a self-respecting mindset.\nIntegrity is the voice within\nthat is most grounding in the whirlwind\nof tempting influences.\nFollow it wisely,\nand you'll always find yourself\nin a place of self-respect.\nNumber seven, I know I have\nreasons to love myself.\nAn easy exercise for\ndeveloping more self-respect\nis writing down characteristics and traits\nthat make you feel highly valuable,\nand worthy in your own eyes.\nMaybe it's the way you\ntreat people with kindness,\nyour consistent punctuality,\nor how you always have courage\nin the face of your fears\nthat makes you respect yourself.\nRead the list back to yourself\nwhen you need a reminder of your values,\nand practice self-respect\nevery day by sticking to them.\nAnd number eight, I\nsurround myself with people\nI know respect me too.\nOnce you've solidified a\nstrong sense of self-respect\nfor yourself,\nand have maintained distance\nfrom those who don't,\nfinding a tribe that\nloves and respects you\nwill become second nature.\nWhen you know who you are,\nand why you deserve to respect yourself,\nyou'll refuse to allow anyone\nwho wants to convince you otherwise\nto have any influence in your life.\nEveryone struggles with\nself-confidence and self-love\nfrom time to time,\nbut they aren't meant\nto be final destinations\nwhere healing and growth stop.\nWhat matters is maintaining\na consistent amount of\nself-respect for ourselves\nand one another throughout\nthe ups and downs of it all.\nThere has been a huge decline\nin mental health around the world,\nwhich is why we are so committed\nto creating more content\nthan we ever have.\nThanks for being a part of our journey.\nCan you relate to any of these signs?\nLet us know in the comments below,\nand share this with\nsomeone who might benefit.\nAs, always the studies and references used\nare listed in the description box below.\nFor more tips and resources\non how to grow respect\nfor yourself and others,\nbe sure to check out our\nPsych2Go YouTube channel\nfor more
