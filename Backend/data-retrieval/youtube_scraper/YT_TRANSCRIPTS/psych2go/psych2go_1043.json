all have our own\ninner battles to fight.\nBut if you've ever had to\nfight the same battle over\nand over again, or if you've been carrying\na burden you just don't how to shake,\nthen it's probably

guessing everything I do.\nC, I had more confidence to go after\nwhat I really want in life.\nD, if I could learn to trust\nand forgive people more easily.\nOr E, if I could handle failure better\nand stop being so hard on myself.\nOkay, I'll tally it up.\nHere is your inner demon,\naccording to the letter\nthat appears the most.\nIf A appears the most, your\ninner demon is anxiety.\nYour inner demon is like a constant weight\non your shoulders, dragging you down\nand making you worry about things\nthat aren't in your control,\nor even likely to happen.\nRestless and overwhelming.\nLiving with anxiety can feel\na lot like having a cluttered mind.\nIt becomes hard to focus,\nwind down and stay grounded.\nEspecially with that demon\nwhispering terrible things\nin your ear all the time.\nIf you answered mostly B's,\nyour inner demon is guilt.\nHaving guilt as your inner\ndemon can be crippling,\nbecause it will trick you\ninto constantly thinking\nthat you've done something wrong.\nEvery move you make will\nfeel like the wrong one\nand you'll be stuck second\nguessing yourself all the time.\nPeople haunted by guilt\nare overly apologetic,\nneurotic, self-conscious\nand easily embarrassed.\nThey struggle to move\non from past mistakes\nand are prone to beating themselves up\nover every little thing that goes wrong.\nIf you answered mostly C's,\nyour inner demon is self-doubt.\nPerhaps the easiest inner\ndemon to fall victim to\nand certainly one we've all\nfound ourselves grappling with\nat some point in our lives.\nHaving a lot of self-doubt\ncan be detrimental\nto every aspect of our\nlives, socially, personally\nand especially academically\nand professionally.\nAnd the worst part is this kind\nof inner demon will\noften try to convince you\nthat it's all for your own good,\nthat you need to be harsh on yourself\nand overly critical in order\nto push you into being better.\nDon't listen to those lies,\ntreating yourself with more\ncompassion and self love,\ncan make you flourish far more\nthan any high harsh comment\nor criticism ever could.\nIf D appears the most,\nyour inner demon is anger.\nAnger is something we all\nfeel from time to time,\nand that's not a bad thing.\nHowever, if anger becomes an inner demon,\nthen it will cause a lot of damage\nin your life and in your relationships.\nLeft unchecked and out of control,\nour anger has the power\nto blind us completely\nand turn us against even our\nclosest family and friends.\nThat's why it's so\nimportant that we learned\nto control our anger instead\nof letting it control us.\nAnd if you answered mostly\nE's, your inner demon is pride.\nLast, but certainly not least is pride.\nPeople with this kind of inner demon\nare often perfectionists\nand overachievers,\nalways pushing themselves to do more\nand be the very best that they can be.\nThey may be overly competitive\nand sometimes envious of\nthe success of others.\nBut it's only because their inner demon\nis telling them that they always have\nto prove their worth to everyone.\nAnd although they might come across\nas a bit abrasive and self important,\ndeep down inside, all they\nreally want is to be valued.\nNot for what they've done\nor what they've achieved,\nbut for who they are as a person.\nSo, do you agree with your results?\nDid you learn something new\nabout yourself after taking the test?\nWhichever result you got, it's important\nthat you acknowledge the terrible toll\nour inner demons take on\nour lives when we listen\nto them and give in to their demands.\nRecognizing which inner demon you possess\nis an important first step\nto take in conquering it\nand living a better, happier\nand more authentic life.\nDid this video provide some new insight?\nShare your results in the comments below.\nUntil next time, Psych2Goers."
