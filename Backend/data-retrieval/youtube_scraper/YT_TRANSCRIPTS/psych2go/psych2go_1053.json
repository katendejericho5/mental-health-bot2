    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nHave you been talking\nto your crush lately,\nand you're not sure if they're\nflirting or just being nice?\nFlirting can be a tricky thing.\nMany of us are often left wondering\nhow we should act around\nthe people we like\nor what the right thing to say would be,\nhow we can subtly let them know\nthat we're interested in them\nand, in turn, decipher if\nthey feel the same way.\nIt can all get real complicated real fast.\nAnd the last thing any\none of us would want\nis to possibly jeopardize\nour friendship with them\nby making things awkward.\nDon't worry though.\nHere are eight telltale signs\nthat can help you tell the difference\nbetween someone who might\nbe interested in you\nand someone who's just being nice.\nNumber one, they're nice to everyone.\nThe first thing you should\nalways take a look at\nwhen trying to figure out\nsomeone's feelings for you\nis to compare the way they treat you\nto the way they treat everyone else.\nAre they just as friendly with you\nas they are with a lot of other people?\nThere are actually a lot of people\nwho are just very friendly, chatty,\nand comfortable joking\naround with lots of people.\nBe careful not to read too much into it,\nand keep an eye out for any\nof these other signs too.\nNumber two, they never initiate anything.\nSure, you might be talking\nto this person a lot\nand spending lots of time with them,\nbut think back on the last time\nthe two of you actually made plans.\nWho was the one to initiate it?\nHave they ever actually\ngone outta their way\nto spend time with you or\nstrike up conversation with you?\nIf you're the only one doing\nmost of the initiating,\nthen it's most likely\nthat although this person\ncertainly enjoys spending time with you,\nthey're not flirting with you.\nNumber three, they don't\nhang out with you alone.\nSimilar to the points made earlier,\njust because someone spends time with you\nand talks to you a lot,\nit doesn't necessarily mean\nthat they're trying to\nstart anything with you,\nespecially if they never\nhang out with you alone.\nSo if the only time you and\nthis person ever get together\nis with a bunch of mutual friends around,\nthen they probably just wanna\nbe friends and nothing more.\nNumber four, they keep a\nrespectful physical distance.\nWhile some people may be more comfortable\nwith it than others,\ntouching and other acts\nof physical affection\ncan be completely platonic\nand appropriate with friends.\nMost people try to keep\ntheir touch respectful\nand only reciprocate\nthe touches you initiate\nor when appropriate,\nlike to comfort you when you're\nupset, scared, or anxious.\nNumber five, they're careful\nabout what they talk about.\nAnother telltale sign that\nsomeone's just being friendly\nand not actually flirting with you\nis if they're careful about\nwhat the two of you talk about.\nEven our closest friends are mindful\nnot to send mixed signals.\nThat is, they usually\nkeep your conversations\nrestricted to more friendly territory,\nlike what's going on in your lives,\nhow you're doing, how you're feeling,\nand any common interests you might share.\nNumber six, they don't open up too much.\nAgain, the simplest act\nof striking up a few\nconversations with someone\nisn't enough evidence that\nthey have feelings for you\nor are trying to flirt with you,\nespecially if they're careful\nnot to open up to you too much.\nSo think back on the last time\nyou and this person spoke.\nDid they seem guarded to you at all?\nAre there some things you sensed\nthey might have been reluctant to share\nor talk to you about?\nIt might be because they were\nworried that sharing too much\nmight give you the wrong\nidea behind their intentions.\nOf course, some people are\nnaturally more guarded,\nso that may be the case as well.\nNumber seven, they let\nconversations end organically.\nOne of the best ways we can distinguish\nbetween someone who\njust wants to be friends\nand someone who wants more\nis by looking at the way our\nconversations end with them.\nIf they like to keep talking\nto you for as long as possible,\neven about the most mundane things,\nthen they might be flirting.\nOn the other hand,\nif they just let your\nconversations fizzle out\nand reach their natural stopping points,\nthen they're likely just\nbeing friendly with you.\nAnd finally, number eight,\nthey talk about their crushes with you.\nLast but not least,\nwhile this sign might be\nthe most obvious of all,\nit's still worth mentioning here.\nIf this person is comfortable\nenough to talk to you\nabout who they like, who\nthey find attractive,\nor who they might be\nromantically interested in,\nthen that's a clear a sign as any\nthat they only see you as\na friend and nothing more.\nAfter all, when you're\nflirting with someone,\nit's particularly taboo\nto insinuate to them\nthat there might be other\npeople you're interested in,\n'cause that's just going\nto ruin your chances\nof winning them over.\nSo do you relate to any of the\nthings we've mentioned here?\nHas this list helped you figure out\nif someone is just being friendly to you\nor if they're genuinely flirting with you?\nRemember this list is not a guarantee.\nEvery situation is different.\nDid you find this video valuable?\nTell us in
