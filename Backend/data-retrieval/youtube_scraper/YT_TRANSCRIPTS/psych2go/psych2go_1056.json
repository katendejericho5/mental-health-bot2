    "transcript": "there's been a huge decline in mental\nhealth around the world which is why we\nare so committed to creating more\ncontent than we ever have thank you so\nmuch for being a part of our journey\nare you worried that someone in your\nlife may be struggling with their mental\nhealth\neven if they say they aren't your friend\nor loved one may tell you that they're\nfine but perhaps you think differently\nthey may not be aware of how deeply they\nare suffering or they may simply not be\nready to discuss how they feel or\nthey're unable to express it although\nit's important not to jump to\nconclusions regarding how others feel\nand equally important not to judge them\nyour intuition about how your loved one\nfeels can be traced to a valid concern\nworth bringing up with them so with that\nbeing said here are five signs someone\nis not actually fine\nnumber one mood changes does your loved\nones say they're all right but seem to\nhave had a drastic change in mood\nperhaps their moods shift more easily\nand more dramatically do they break down\nover what seems to be the smallest\nthings do they become sad or angry more\neasily\nwith their emotions seeming\ndisproportionate to the issue at hand\nor perhaps instead of rapid mood changes\nyou notice that their emotions are more\nextreme than usual\ndo they get excessively angry or maybe\neven violent do they appear to be deeply\nsad\nmaybe they have difficulty expressing\njoy\nperhaps they seem down most of the time\nor are they constantly anxious or their\nnervousness has reached new heights\nlately if so they may not be doing as\nwell as they say number two withdrawal\nfrom activities has your loved one been\nwithdrawing from activities they may\nhave told you that they're doing just\nfine but have you observed that they no\nlonger participate in the hobbies that\nyou know they enjoy perhaps they stopped\ngoing to the dance classes that they\nused to love or are never in the mood to\ngo to the movies when it used to be\ntheir favorite pastime\nyou also may have noticed that they\nwithdraw from social activities do they\nconstantly turn down invites or maybe\nthey accept invites but then they keep\ncancelling\nhave they been spending an unhealthy\namount of time alone before assuming\nthat they no longer want you in their\nlife consider the possibility that they\ncould be struggling with personal issues\neven if they tell you otherwise\nnumber three\ndifficulty concentrating has your loved\none been out of it or do they appear\nmore spaced out and have great\ndifficulty focusing and concentrating\nrecently you may observe this as a\nclassmate or a colleague in the tasks\nthey try to accomplish alternatively\nthey may seem to be less attentive\nduring conversations they might seem\ndistracted confused or more forgetful\nit might not be that they're\ndisinterested but if they seem\nuncharacteristically distracted in\naddition to other worries and behaviors\nand changes they may be grappling with\npersonal issues and feeling lost in\ntheir mind\nnumber four decline in ability to\nfunction\nthis difficulty in concentrating can\nalso contribute to another sign\nwhich is an unusual decrease in their\nfunctioning at school or work or in\nsocial situations and hobbies\nthey could also have a harder time\ncoping with problems and daily tasks\ngetting more stress than usual over\nday-to-day hurdles has your friend been\nfailing tasks at school or getting\nuncharacteristically low grades have\nthey been underperforming at work or in\nthe sports team you're both in\nif this drop in functioning is unusual\nfor them they could be working through\nsome personal issues at the moment and\nnumber five decline in physical health\nand personal care\nhave you noticed that your loved one has\nbeen neglecting physical health and\npersonal care such as being more tired\nthan usual due to a lack of proper sleep\nor from sleeping too much\nor you may have noticed a drastic change\nin their appetite\ndo they seem to be unconcerned with\ntheir well-being\naside from losing the will to eat and\nsleep properly they may have also begun\nto neglect their personal hygiene and\nappearance and also be engaging in risky\nbehaviors such as substance abuse this\nlack of concern for themselves\nmanifested in different ways could\nunderstandably cause you concern your\nloved one may either be simply stressed\nout or struggling with their mental\nhealth it's important to remember that\none or two of these signs alone isn't a\npredictor of mental illness but may\nindicate a need for a further evaluation\nif you suspect that your loved one may\nbe struggling with their mental health\nplease reach out to a qualified\nprofessional\ncan you relate to any of these points\nlet us know in the comments below and\nremember to like and share this video\nwith others you think it might help\nas always
