    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2goers.\nWhat do you know about depression?\nAlthough depression has been reported\nby the World Health Organization\nas the leading cause of disability,\nand the most common mental\nillness in the world,\nwith over 264 million people\non the globe suffering from it.\nThe truth is,\nthere's still a lot that\nmost people don't know\nor understand about it.\nNot only do many cases go undiagnosed,\nand many symptoms unnoticed,\na lot of people seem to\nhold a misguided belief\nthat depression looks\nthe same for everybody,\nbut that's just not the case.\nThere has been a huge decline\nin mental health around the world,\nwhich is why we're so committed\nto creating more content\nthan we ever have.\nThanks so much for being\na part of our journey.\nSo, do you wanna know more about\nwhat hidden depression might look like?\nAnd what it might make someone do?\nYou've come to the right place.\nHere are seven things\nhidden depression makes you do.\nNumber one.\nThrow yourself into your work or studies.\nWhen you think of someone\nstruggling with depression,\nyou might imagine a person\nwho can't even get outta\nbed in the morning.\nSomeone who spends all\nday just lying around\nand doing nothing,\nbecause they can't\nmuster up any motivation,\nbut that's just a common misconception.\nDepression can also\nmake you throw yourself into\nyour work or your studies\nas an escape mechanism,\nto avoid spending too much\ntime in your own head.\nNumber two.\nExpress yourself through your creativity.\nSimilar to the earlier example,\nanother way depression\nmay keep itself hidden\nis if it only manifests itself\nthrough your art and creativity.\nDo you find yourself\nwriting a lot of sad songs\nor deeply melancholic poetry lately?\nPerhaps you've been\npainting haunting images,\nor have been ending all your\nstories with sad conclusions.\nTake a good look at the art\nyou make or gravitate towards,\nand ask yourself,\n\"If this might be the reason why?\"\nNumber three.\nSpend more time with others.\nIt's no secret\nthat one of the worst\nthings depression can do\nis make you self isolate.\nCutting yourself off from your loved ones.\nBut, did you know that the\nopposite can also be true?\nSometimes depression\ncan make you wanna spend\ntime with other people,\nthough not for the right reasons.\nPeople who struggle with hidden depression\nmay always wanna have someone around\nbecause they're terrified of being alone.\nDepression can make you crave\nacceptance and validation\nfrom others, more than is healthy.\nWhich brings us to our next point.\nNumber four.\nYou feel pressured to always seem happy.\nDistinguishing between someone\nwho is genuinely happy,\nand someone who might be\nstruggling with hidden depression\nis where it really starts to get tricky,\nbecause the truth is,\nthe difference between them\ntend to be very subtle,\nespecially if you're not\nthe person experiencing it.\nAfter all, there's a\nreason why they call it\nsmiling depression.\nSince people who struggle with it\ntend to feel a lot of\nguilt for being depressed\nin the first place\nand tend to put pressure on themselves\nto always seem happy to those around them.\nThey might even try to convince themselves\nthat everything is fine\nwhen it's really anything but.\nNumber five.\nOverthink everything.\nContrary to popular belief,\nmany people afflicted\nwith depression have a lot\ngoing on in their minds.\nA lot of those diagnosed\nwith depression report,\n\"A strong tendency to overthink\njust about everything.\"\nSo much so\nthat many of them end up\nfixated on past mistakes,\nperceived personal flaws,\nor even imagined problems\nin their relationships\nthat aren't even there.\nNumber six.\nLose focus or concentration.\nHaving said that, however,\nthe opposite can still be true.\nDepression can either put\nyour brain into overdrive,\nwhere you're overthinking everything\nor crash the system completely,\nmaking it difficult to\nfocus or concentrate at all.\nSo if you've noticed yourself\nunable to think straight on most days,\nblanking out a lot of\nthe time for no reason,\nor struggling to do\nsimple cognitive tasks,\nthat used to come easily to you.\nAccording to the American\nPsychological Association,\n\"There's a real possibility\nthat this might be the reason why.\"\nAnd number seven.\nDisregard affection or\nconcern from others.\nLast, but certainly not least.\nPerhaps the worst thing depression can do\nis blind you from all the care,\nconcern, and affection you\nreceive from other people.\nAt times when your\nfriends, family, or even\nstrangers come up to you\nwhen they notice something is wrong\nor when they notice you seem down,\nyour depression may make you end up\ndisregarding their concerns,\nas simply pity or insecurity.\nSo, did you relate to\nany of the points above?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you
