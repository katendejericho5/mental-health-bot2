    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers!\nEmotions, feelings and all\nthat intangible inner turmoil\ncan be tough to deal with\nbecause dealing with\nit can feel unpleasant.\nWe often do what we can\nto draw negative attention\naway from ourselves.\nThis can take the form\nof simply distracting\nfrom our issues to\nredirecting the attention\nor even passing the blame onto others.\nWhile children commonly\nresort to such methods,\nthese behavior patterns\ncan sometimes follow\npeople into adulthood.\nAs an adult, the\nconsequences are more serious\nthan extra chores or\nbeing sent to one's room.\nNot dealing with your\nfeelings properly as an adult\nmay manifest as fear of intimacy,\nunbalanced sleep cycles,\nor angry outbursts.\nWhile the behavior may seem erratic,\nit can point to an emotional struggle.\nAs adults, you may be so used\nto using your chosen mechanisms\nthat you don't recognize them.\nKnowledge is power.\nSo let's look at some\nsigns of not dealing.\nNumber one, repression.\nA sure sign that you are\nskewing your emotions\nis if you are repressing them.\nWe tend to look at the near future\nand thus feel it's easier\nto bury these emotions\nthan to confront them head on.\nYou may have been described as stoic\nor maybe heard the description\nof being extremely laid back,\nas in laid back to the point\nwhere expression is so limited\nyou don't appear to react to anything,\neven when it is wholly\nappreciated to do so.\nPerhaps this has been portrayed\nas being too cool to care\nby acting constantly disaffected,\nlike some teen romance movie character.\nThis could also take the form\nof being the ever-joking,\nhumorous, fun person.\nYou're not bothered by the thing\nbecause you just made\na joke about it, right?\nRight?\nTruthfully, these are signs\nthat you may feel uncomfortable about\nor fear overt displays of\nemotion from yourself or others.\nNumber two, fear of intimacy.\nSpeaking of fear, another\nsign of not processing\nor handling emotions well\nis a fear of intimacy.\nIntimacy requires you to be vulnerable\nand feel all the uncomfortable feelings\nyou do not wanna feel.\nWhen you deny, deflect\nor otherwise don't deal\nwith your emotions,\nyou are not allowing yourself\nto feel them completely.\nConsequently, you will have\na hard time expressing them.\nAs has been discussed in\nother videos and articles,\nour partners, friends, and\nloved ones aren't mind readers.\nThe inability to express\nemotions leads to vague excuses\nfor how you feel, or maybe\nlies and distractions\nto cover up emotional discomforts.\nThis kind of inability to express emotions\nand allow that kind of vulnerability\nseverely hobbles effective communication,\nresulting in conflict\nand the subsequent strain\non the relationship.\nNumber three, elevated levels of stress.\nBeing dishonest or\nneglectful of your feelings\nis a denial of self.\nThis leads to elevated stress.\nEmotions usually serve as a\nrelease outlet for stress,\nboth mental and emotional.\nWhen you plug that outlet with denial,\ndishonesty and neglect,\npressure increases.\nAnd you can imagine that\ncertainly does not feel good\nand likely does not have a great outcome.\nNumber four, projection.\nProjection refers to the\nact of placing your feelings\non someone else,\nthe same way a projector\nprojects an image onto a wall.\nHowever, projecting\ninvolves more than feelings.\nWhat happens when we have a\nwhole bunch of unpleasant,\nembarrassing and painful emotions\nthat we don't wanna consciously deal with?\nWe unconsciously project our emotions\nand flaws onto other people\nso that someone else is\nresponsible for how we feel.\nPeople who have low self-esteem\nor those who do not fully\nunderstand themselves\nare susceptible to projecting.\nA common example of this\nis when a cheating spouse\naccuses their partner of\nbeing the unfaithful one.\nAnd number five, denial.\nThis is straight up lying to yourself.\nJust think of how many times\nyou've said, 'I'm fine',\nwhen you don't really mean it.\nRegardless of how many times\nyou say, 'I'm fine, I'm good',\nthis won't make it true if\nyou don't give your emotions,\nthe effort, time or space\nto properly feel and deal.\nWe are human and our actions\nsometimes even our physiology,\nwe'll put truth to the lie.\nMost of us try to put our heads down\nand bulldoze through difficult situations\nby pretending to be just fine\nAnd on the surface, although\nit may seem helpful,\nthe constant denial results\nin an erosion of self\nand increasing stress on mental health.\nWhen we understand that we\ndon't wanna deal with unpleasant\nand difficult emotions, they're\nunpleasant and difficult.\nHowever, we are complex\nbeings with complex brains\nand we owe it to ourself\nto embrace this complexity\nand flourish in our complicated selves\nto fully experience our humanity.\nAs much as it doesn't feel good\nto deal with troubling emotions,\nunderstand that neglecting\nour emotions allows festering\nand long term detrimental\ndamage to your emotional health\nand it'll feel worse later.\nCoping can be hard\nand it can be confusing\nto know where to start.\nFortunately, there is\nprofessional help out there,\njust waiting to lend a hand.\nSally forth, then be courageous.\nWe'll catch you next time.\n(gentle music)"
