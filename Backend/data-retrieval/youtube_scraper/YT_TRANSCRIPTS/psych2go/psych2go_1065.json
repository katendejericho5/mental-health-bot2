    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Seven simple\nhabits you should do every day.\nHow on earth have we survived\nliving the way we do?\nSimple answer, habits.\nWe need them or else we\nwouldn't be here for long.\nWe developed these deep-seated\nautomatic behaviors\nand shaped them in accordance\nwith what worked for our lives to survive.\nBut these habits can\neither propel us ahead\nor stifle our growth in life.\nSo let's get you set up with\nsome good everyday habits.\nNumber one, create a start-of-day routine.\nHow you start your day matters,\nregardless of whether\nyou are a morning person\nor a night owl.\nIt's the opening act, the movie trailer,\nthe first chance you get to set\nyour day up for awesomeness.\nDoing something that\nmakes you feel energized\nwill be that springboard\nthat will help launch you\ninto a satisfying day.\nBeing organized, like say\nprepping the night before,\nis also a good form of self care\nbecause you're not starting\nyour day running around\nwondering where are my keys,\nwhat did I need to take with me today.\nOh no. Did I wash that\nshirt I wanted to wear?\nNumber two, stay hydrated.\nYes, we know you've heard it before,\nbut surprisingly, this is one of those\nI keep hearing this from everyone things\nthat actually makes a difference.\nWe humans depend on water\nto make everything work.\nall your body and brain's communication\nand nutrient transport\ndepends heavily on hydration.\nWe're like Venice on the inside.\nOf course, how much is needed\nreally does depend on various things,\nlike level of activity\nor what the environment\nis like in your area, but safe to say,\nyou have to try really hard\nto over-intake on water.\nStill not sold?\nTry drinking between two to\nthree liters of water per day\nfor just one week and note how you feel.\nHint, it's good.\nNumber three, get up earlier.\nIf you are a morning person, or at least a\nI tend to get better stuff\ndone in the morning person,\npush it just a little bit extra\nand try consistently getting up early.\nEven an extra 10 to 15 minutes\ncan nudge your schedule\nin just the right direction\nthat you'll be surprised\nat how much more you can accomplish.\nOf course, to be healthy and sustainable,\nthis does mean getting good\nsleep the night before.\nThis also means practicing\ngood sleep hygiene,\nlike no caffeine within\na few hours of sleep time\nand other sleep prep, like\nnixing the electronics\nat least an hour before lights out.\nNumber four, set daily goals.\nSo you started off strong and\nnow you wanna keep stepping\nso you can get to the\nbig prize at the end,\nlike a primate swinging from a vine\nafter that first big swing.\nWell, where to now?\nYou now you see the golden banana tree\nway off in the distance,\nbut focusing on just the big thing\ncan easily make you feel\nnebulous and lost in between,\nleading to being overwhelmed.\nSo give yourself handholds\nlike small to-do lists\nso that you can visualize the next step\nand not lose your momentum.\nYou then know you're getting even closer\nto that big shiny banana tree.\nNumber five, learn to manage your money.\nThis isn't going to become a\nfinancial lecture. Don't worry.\nThis is just a basic\npay attention to what you're doing tactic.\nWe tend to spend money these\ndays in non-physical forms,\njust digital bits and bytes.\nThis makes it all too easy to\njust not look at our balance\nand think, \"Oh, what's a\nfew dollars here and there?\"\nThat stuff adds up.\nYou can even try a little\nexperiment for yourself.\nFor one week, go through\neverything you've spent,\nother than bills or rent, and add it up.\nSurprised? Yeah, we were too.\nSo a general method that can be used\nis the 50, 20, 30 rule.\nAnd that's not a football play.\nThat's talking about how\nto divvy up your income.\nSo 50% to needs, 20% to\nsavings, and 30 to wants.\nThat covers your butt in all aspects\nand still allows for a little\nwiggle room if need be.\nNumber six, have a positive outlook.\nNo, don't go into toxic positivity mode.\nToo much cotton candy will make you sick.\nBut when we ruminate\nover unpleasant things\nand expect nothing but bad things,\nit tends to become a\nself-fulfilling prophecy\nbecause we start to\nunconsciously adopt habits\nthat force those bad things to come true.\nHaving a positive outlook\ndoesn't mean ignoring what could go wrong.\nIt's a building of confidence\nthat you have the tools and\nresources to make it go right,\nbut you're a smart cookie\nand can still adapt\nif things don't go exactly as planned.\nAlso, thinking positively will eventually\nmake you unconsciously adopt habits\nthat will force things\nin a better direction.\nAnd number seven, schedule\nsome time for yourself.\nMaybe you grew up in an environment\nwhere you were scolded for being lazy\nbecause you took time to yourself\nto do something for yourself.\nFortunately, the news is out\nthat this is not being lazy.\nHaving some downtime or me\ntime is actually healthy\nand necessary in the long run.\nCarving out a small portion\nof your day every day\nto do something that's just for you,\nnot for the company, not for the family,\nnot for others, just\nyou, helps you refocus\nand keep a solid relationship\nwith your identity.\nBad habits can be broken\nand good ones can be formed.\nAnd to get yourself going,\nit's enough to start\nasking yourself simply,\n\"Why am I doing this?\"\nBe patient with yourself\nand eventually you'll notice\nlife is on the upswing.\nWhich habits do you do now?\nAre you trying, but having\ntrouble with any of these?\nPlease feel free to discuss and comment.\nMake us a habit and we'll see you soon."
