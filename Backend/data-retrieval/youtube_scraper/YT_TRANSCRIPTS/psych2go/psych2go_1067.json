    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWhen something bad\nhappens, it can sometimes\ntake us a while to get over\nthe pain and feel okay again.\nThat's why it's so\nimportant for us to let go\nand allow our psychological\nwounds to finally heal.\nBut like a lot of things in life,\nhealing from past trauma is\noften easier, said than done.\nA lot of people mistakenly believe,\nthat it's better to just\nkeep all those feelings\nshoved deep down inside of ourselves.\nBut no matter how good you think\nthat you are at denying your problems,\nunhealed trauma can still have a lot\nof devastating effects on our lives,\neven in the present day.\nHere are eight psychology\nbacked signs that your\nunhealed trauma is affecting\nyour relationships.\nNumber one, you feel drawn to\npeople who are bad for you.\nWhat we look for in our partners\nand our friends is a reflection\nof how we feel about ourselves\nand what we think we deserve.\nBut if someone has traumatized you enough\nin the past to have you\nquestioning your value and thinking\nthat you did something\nto deserve the horrible\nway that they treated you,\nthen it's likely to make you more drawn\nto the same kind of people\nagain, who treat you badly.\nNumber two, you're always looking\nfor the first sign of trouble.\nEver heard the phrase\nconstantly waiting for\nthe other shoe to drop?\nIf you're still struggling\nwith unhealed trauma from the past,\nthen it's a feeling you'll\nno doubt be familiar with.\nIn all your relationships,\nbe it romantic, familial or platonic,\nyou're always looking for\nthe first sign of trouble.\nWhy?\nBecause toxic relationships\ndon't always start\nout that way.\nAnd if you've already\nfallen victim to it once,\nyou'll constantly be on the lookout\nfor signs or risks of it happening again.\nNumber three, you have a\nhard time trusting others.\nAnother sign you may still be struggling\nwith unhealed trauma\nthat's affecting your\npresent relationships\nis if you find it hard to trust,\neven the people you're closest to.\nYou're always reading\ninto every little thing\nthey say or do.\nYou do everything yourself\nif you can help it.\nBecause you don't wanna\ndepend on anyone else,\nyou keep your secrets to yourself\nand you don't show anyone the\ndepth of your true feelings,\nwhich brings us to our next point.\nNumber four, you struggle\nwith emotional intimacy,\nsimilar to the earlier point.\nNot only do you have trouble\ntrusting people enough\nto let them in, you keep them\nat an emotional distance too.\nAnd of course you're\nnot to blame for this.\nYou've probably been hurt,\nmanipulated and betrayed\nby someone you once cared\nabout deeply in the past.\nBut until you make peace with that trauma,\nit's always going to keep\nyou from making meaningful\nemotional connections\nwith those around you.\nNumber five, you struggle\nwith physical intimacy.\nIt's also common for\npeople with unhealed trauma\nto struggle with physical intimacy,\njust as much as emotional intimacy.\nWhy?\nBecause they go hand in hand.\nHugging, kissing, handholding\nand other acts of physical affection\nare all invitations for someone to enter\ninto your personal space\nand get closer to you.\nAnd for people who still\nhaven't healed from the pain\nof their past, this can all seem too scary\nor too difficult to do.\nNumber six, you socially\nwithdraw at times.\nOne of the most telling signs\nthat someone is still\nstruggling with the trauma\nof their past is if they become\nsocially withdrawn at times.\nThey might not wanna go out as much\nor spend as much time with\ntheir friends as they used to.\nThey might also seem to be\nlosing interest in their hobbies,\nespecially if it requires social contact.\nSometimes they might even go days\nwithout a single text, chat, phone call\nor social media update.\nNumber seven, you sabotage\nyour own relationships.\nThere's an irony to being\nin a toxic relationship.\nAgain, it doesn't always\nstart out that way.\nAnd most people stay for as long\nas they do because they're\neither still waiting\nfor things to get better\nor they've gotten very good\nat convincing themselves\nthat everything is fine.\nBut the problem\nwith that is you might start\nto internalize that mindset\nand subconsciously sabotage\nyour own relationships.\nYou expect every relationship\nfrom now on to fail.\nAnd so the moment you enter\na conflict or a difficulty,\nyou don't bother to fix things\nbecause you feel it would be useless.\nAnd number eight,\nyou can't let yourself be happy.\nTo be happy now seems\nlike an uncomfortable\nand unfamiliar feeling\nto those struggling with past trauma\nand to have genuine love,\nfriendship and a healthy\npositive relationship seems\nalmost too good to be true.\nOn some level,\nmaybe you don't think you\ndeserve it, but you do.\nEveryone deserves to be happy\nand whatever the cause of your\ntrauma or however long ago\nit might have been,\nknow that help is always available.\nSo if you relate to any of the\nsigns we've mentioned here,\nif you still have unhealed\ntrauma that's hurting you\nin your relationship, please\ndo not hesitate to reach\nout to a mental healthcare\nprofessional today and get help.\nDid you find this video valuable?\nTell us in the comments below.\nPlease like and share
