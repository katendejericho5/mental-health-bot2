    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Being super\nclose in a relationship,\nyou can say whatever,\nwhenever and however.\nRight?\nRight?\nOkay, straight up,\nbeing honest is great and\nlying is definitely not great.\nHowever, that honesty doesn't\nneed to be cruel or toxic\nwhich can happen with flippant comments.\nWorse, when we're angry,\nsometimes our need to fight back\nmakes us say things that cut so deep\nthat even after the fight is over,\nthe damage can't be fixed.\nSo to help you become more aware\nof how your words may affect others,\nwe've gathered up eight\ncommon things people say\nthat could poison relationships.\nNumber one, \"You're too sensitive.\"\nOr, \"Calm down.\"\nWhen someone confides in you,\nthey're taking a big chance by opening up.\nIt's a scary gamble to let you in.\nWhen your response is something like,\n\"Just calm down.\"\nOr, \"You're too sensitive.\"\nYou effectively slam\nthe door in their face.\nThese phrases project the\nmessage that you're judging them\nand deeming their issue as unimportant.\nSo now you've shut off listening.\nIt implies that you couldn't\nbe bothered to help them\nor care about how they feel\nsince you don't feel the\nsame way about the subject.\nShowing an interest like saying,\n\"I can see that this hurts you.\"\nOr even something that\ninvites further understanding\nor explanation goes a long way\nto making the other person\nfeel heard and understood.\nNumber two, \"Just forget it.\"\nOr, \"Whatever.\"\nPhrases like these shut\ndown communication.\nThe other person feels\nlike you don't trust them\nor you don't see them as\nimportant enough to share with.\nThey're confused and they\ncan't read your mind.\nImprove communication by\nbeing more descriptive\nand honest with why you\ndon't feel like talking.\nFor example you could try saying\nthat you don't feel like\nthey're listening to you\nor that you're feeling at your limit\nand can't continue talking\nabout it right now.\nNumber three, \"I'm done.\"\nPhrases like this one threaten\nthe end of the relationship.\nLike maybe we should just break up then.\nThese kind of statements\nunequivocally confirm\nthat you feel throwing\nthe other person away\nis a better choice than\ndealing with the issue at hand.\nThis phrase is often used\nas a form of manipulation\nbecause of the devastating hurt\nof being treated like a disposable.\nThey're presented by toxic\npeople as a negotiating tool\nbut really this is outright bullying.\nA better approach would be\nto take time to cool off\nbefore making decisions\nand if it turns out\nthat you're no longer\ncompatible with each other,\nit comes from a place of\nunderstanding, not impulsive anger.\nNumber four, \"I'm sure it's not that bad.\"\nOr, \"You'll get over it.\"\nYou might think that saying\nthis is helping the other person\nrealize things can get better\nand that they have no need to be fearful\nbut what is really being communicated\nis your emotions are invalid.\nThese statements scream,\n\"I don't believe you,\nyou're wasting my time\n\"so stop talking.\"\nEven if the person does\nget over it eventually,\nat this time, they're suffering.\nHearing something like\nthis just tells them\nthat you don't care enough\nabout them to listen\nand you want them to stop bugging you.\nIf this isn't the message\nyou're trying to send\nand you really do want to help,\nyou could try using\nmore inviting language.\nExamples could be, \"That sounds hard.\"\nOr, \"We can get through this together.\"\nOr even, \"I can see why you'd feel.\"\nAnd encouraging them\nto help you understand.\nNumber five, \"You're just like\nyour insert relative here.\"\nParents, siblings, aunts or uncles.\nThis phrase is particularly insulting\nbecause of its ambiguity.\nIf it's said during a\ntime of disagreement,\nit strongly implies that you're referring\nto a really crappy trait in\nthat relative or family member.\nYeah, thems is fighting words.\nYou're using the information\nthis person has confided in you\nabout their family and\nweaponizing it against them.\nSo maybe tailor the statement\nso it's not a blanket,\neasy to misunderstand statement\nby stating the specific\nbehavior and focusing on that.\nNot inadvertently insulting\nthe whole family line.\nNumber six, \"You're crazy.\"\nWe mean when this is said in response\nto an upset or hurt being communicated,\nnot when you're laughing with\nthem about some daring stunt\nthat was pulled at a party.\nIf this person shares something upsetting\nlike a suspected stalker\nor a racist coworker,\nif you say, \"You're crazy\" or,\n\"That's so not true, you're nuts.\"\nYou're very possibly\nparticipating in gaslighting.\nYou're telling this person\nthat they're incapable\nof evaluating their own reality\nand you think they're a waste of time.\nIt makes even the most stable people\nfeel a shot of insecurity.\nIt's a sign of utter disrespect\nfor them as a person.\nWe're sure you're not trying\nto destabilize anyone.\nIf the situation is\njust that alien to you,\nyou can try to invite\nthem to explain further.\nLike, \"I haven't been\nin a similar situation.\n\"Can you explain?\"\nNumber seven, not saying anything\nor giving the silent treatment.\nStonewalling, icing someone out,\ngiving the silent treatment,\nthey are all common reactive responses\nfor those with avoidant attachment styles.\nIt's shutting someone\nout to protect yourself\nfrom the vulnerability of sharing emotion.\nMeanwhile, the other person\nfeels like they've been slammed\ninto that wall\nwhen they'd been previously\ntold that there was a doorway.\nThey feel rejected and betrayed.\nEven just a small, sincere statement like,\n\"I need to think clearly\nbut I need some time first.\"\nOr, \"It's too much\nright now but I hear you\n\"and we'll get back to this.\"\nWill both give you the\ncool off period necessary\nand prevent a massive amount of damage.\nAnd number eight, \"You\nnever\" or \"You always\".\nWe can't help it, we're gonna say it.\nOnly a Sith deals in absolutes.\nThank you Obi-Wan.\nAdmit it, you don't want\nto be a Darth anything.\nSo try to avoid the all\nor nothing statements\nlike you never or you always.\nThese generalizations put the\nother person on the defensive.\nIt implies anything good\nthey've done in the relationship\nhas been taken for granted,\ndismissed and invalidated.\nThey see you choosing\nto mischaracterize them\nby having this singular, negative\nbehavior stain everything\nthe same shade.\nFocusing on the particular\nbehavior being discussed\nwill help to avoid the nevers and always.\nIn trying to express a\ntrend that frustrates you,\ncommunicate the trend, not\ndefault to the generalization.\nLike it or not, we don't get to edit\nand cut out the rough\nbits in a relationship\nlike a film strip or a digital file.\nWe stumble, we make\nmistakes and we misspeak.\nThe great thing about being human though\nis that we have the\ncapacity to be self aware,\nlearn and evolve in\nthese complex situations\nlike relationships.\nThis lets us enrich our lives\nand become better than we\ncould have possibly imagined.\nDo you recognize any of these phrases?\nWhat have you noticed when they were used?\nHow did you feel if any were said to you?\nWe look forward to your\ndiscussion and comments.\nAlso feel free to hit that like button\nand catch you next time\nand thanks for watching."
