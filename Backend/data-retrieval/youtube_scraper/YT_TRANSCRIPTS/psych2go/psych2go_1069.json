    "transcript": "- Hello, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back.\nHave you ever met someone\nwho could fake their\nintelligence to fool everyone?\nThey dazzle others with big words\nand lofty ideas convincing everyone\nof their vast brain power,\nbut in the end it all\nturns out to be a ruse,\nleaving you, confused.\nPeople like this are pseudo intellectuals,\npseudo, meaning false,\nand intellectual meaning\nan intelligent person.\nBut how can we spot pseudo intellectuals\nbefore we get sucked\ninto their false persona.\nTo learn more about\nthis, here are five signs\nsomeone is faking their intelligence.\nNumber one, they overuse and\nmisuse advanced vocabulary.\nAre they like a walking thesaurus?\nPseudo intellectuals tend\nto always feel the need\nto inject the longest words\nand most advanced phrases\ninto every conversation.\nEven when it's unnecessary.\nInstead of inviting you to lunch,\nthey entreat you to partake\nin their midday sustenance ritual.\nThey use language as a tool\nfor intimidation and self gain.\nSo when you ask them to\nexplain, they can respond\nwith a self-satisfied\nsmirk or personal insult.\nEven worse, they often use\nthe wrong pronunciation\nor meaning for their advanced phrases\nbecause they care more about showing\noff than really understanding\nwhat they're saying.\nOn the other hand,\npeople with genuine intelligence\nwill value clear communication.\nThis means using advanced vocabulary\nonly when it's appropriate\nand being open to explaining\nthings when others don't understand.\nNumber two,\nthey brag about their\nintelligence all the time.\nDo you know someone who won't stop talking\nabout their own intelligence?\nTheir self-proclaimed\ngenius is the only part\nof their personal identity.\nAnd they don't hesitate\nto let everyone know\nabout it all the time.\nThey constantly brag\nabout their intellectual\nhobbies for no reason,\ncomplain about how their\nhigh intelligence is somehow\na curse or accuse all of society\nof being ignorant and tasteless.\nThey take every opportunity to\ncompare themselves to others\nand proclaim how they\nare mentally superior.\nBut people with genuine\nintelligence, won't be like this.\nInstead, they're comfortable\nwith their mental abilities\nand won't need to or\nwant to waste their time\nconvincing people of how smart they are.\nNumber three, they always\nrepeat profound quotes.\nAre they constantly speaking in quotes?\nFor every occasion,\nthey can cite a profound saying\nfrom a high level thinker.\nTalk about family and they cite Confucius,\nabout school detention\nand they cite Kafka.\nAnd for pop music, they'll cite Adorno.\nIt sounds quite intelligent at first,\nbut upon deeper examination,\nyou may come to realize\nthat the quotes aren't\nvaluable or even relevant\nto the conversation.\nUltimately, pseudo intellectuals\nwill exploit the credentials\nof past thinkers as a smoke\nscreen to appear knowledgeable,\nrather than having any\noriginal ideas of their own.\nOn the flip side, people\nwith genuine intelligence\nwill say a quote only when it contributes\nreal value to the discussion,\nrather than just to show\noff the big names they know.\nNumber four, they derail conversations\nwith pointless intellectual questions.\nCan they stick to the\npoint of a conversation\nwithout turning it into some\ngrand intellectual argument?\nNo matter how casual a discussion is,\na pseudo intellectual will\nalways find a way to hijack\nby asking provocative,\nbut pointless questions.\nHighly abstract questions\nthat nobody can answer\nor pedantic questions to undermine you.\nSo if you say that you had a good day,\nthey may respond with,\nwhat does it really mean to enjoy life?\nPeople would genuine intelligence,\non the other hand, will ask deep questions\nto make a meaningful contribution,\nindulge their curiosity\nand to further the main point\nof the discussion and number five,\nthey act like they have\neverything figured out.\nAre they always on about\nknowing how the world works?\nPseudo intellectuals often\nhave very rigid beliefs\nabout society, politics,\nreligion, and so on.\nThey're not open to genuine discussion.\nAnd when faced with a\ndifference in opinion,\nthey'll simply state that you're wrong,\ninsult your intelligence,\ninflate their own credentials and claim\nthat their viewpoint is\njust too obvious to explain.\nThis stands in stark contrast to people\nwith genuine intelligence\nwho are open-minded\nand who understand that the\nworld has no simple answers.\nDo you relate to any of\nthe traits we've mentioned?\nIf you've made it to the end,\ndrop an emoji in the comments below\nand let us know what you think.\nAlso, don't forget to like and share this\nif you think it will help someone else.\nThanks so much for watching\nand see you in the next video."
