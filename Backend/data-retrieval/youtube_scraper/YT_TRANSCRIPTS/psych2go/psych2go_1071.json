    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Is there\nsomeone who you think\nhas a crush on you?\nOr, do you think you may\nhave misread the signs?\nSometimes they can be difficult to know\nwhether someone is\ninterested in you or not.\nThey might be so subtle\nwith their flirting\nthat you just have no idea.\nOr, they may have been sending\nyou signals all this time,\nbut you just haven't noticed\nwhat they're trying to do.\nHmm.\nWell, to help you become\nmore aware of these signs,\nhere are eight phrases someone would say\nif they're into you.\nNumber one.\n\"Let's hang out.\"\nAre they always asking\nto spend time with you?\nThey can be overwhelming to hear someone\nconfess their attraction to you,\nespecially if you had no idea\nthat they had any interest at all.\nSo oftentimes, to make sure\nthat they don't blindside you\nin any way,\npeople who are into you\nmay try to start slow\nand build a connection by\nspending time with you,\nwhether it's grabbing a coffee\nor going for a walk in the park.\nSpending time together\nhelps you get to know each other more.\nPlus, the more you spend\nyour time with them,\nthe more you may be able to know\nwhether they're flirty\nbehavior is the one time thing\nor consistent every time.\nIf it's consistent, then\nyou'll definitely know\nwhether they're into you or not.\nNumber two.\n\"Knock, knock.\"\n\"Who's there?\"\nDo they try to make\nyou laugh all the time?\nHumor can play a huge part\nin romantic attraction.\nA study found that the more\ntimes a man tried to be funny\nand the more times a woman\nlaughed at his jokes,\nthe more likely she was\nromantically interested.\nFurthermore, they found that\ncouples who laugh together\ntend to become more\ninterested in each other.\nSo if there is someone\nin your friend group\nor colleague at work\nwho's always making a fool of themselves\nor making really bad\njokes to get you to laugh,\nthey may be secretly into you\nand trying to develop a\nstronger bond with you.\nNumber three.\n\"You look lovely today.\"\nWho doesn't like a compliment?\nSomeone who is into you,\nbut who doesn't know how to approach you\nmay start with a compliment.\nSenses can make you feel good\nand be a way to start a conversation.\nPerhaps they tell you that you\nhave a great sense of humor\nor say that you are very\nthoughtful or inspiring.\nAnd by making you feel\ngood about yourself,\nit'll put you in a positive mood\nand make it more likely for\nyou to engage with them.\nBut remember that compliments alone\nmay not be enough to know\nwhether someone likes you or not.\nAfter all, they could be someone\nwho just wants to spread\nsome positivity around.\nSo apart from paying compliments,\ntry to look for other signs as well.\nNumber four.\n\"My friends having a party.\nDo you wanna join?\"\nHave they invited you to\ntheir weekly game nights?\nSometimes the thought\nof going out one-on-one\nwith your crush can be nerve wracking.\nSo an alternative can be to\nask them to a group event.\nBy being in an environment\nwhere there are other people,\nit can take the pressure\noff of both of you\nand making directions more easygoing.\nSo if they've been asking you to hang out\nwith their friend group,\nit may be their way of\ntrying to find an excuse\nto get to spend some time with you.\nOnce you get to know each other more,\nyou may become more comfortable\nwith the idea of going\nout on a date one-on-one.\nNumber five.\n\"Let's go see the movie\nyou mentioned last week.\nDo they remember all the\nsmall details about you?\nPerhaps, you've mentioned a restaurant\nyou've always wanted to go to\nor talked about a movie\nthat you wanted to see.\nWhile you may not think\nmuch of what you've said,\nsomeone who's into you may\nremember all these things\nand make plans to do them with you.\nSimilarly, they may notice\nand remember the things you've mentioned\nlike your favorite color\nor your go-to coffee order.\nAll this goes to show\nhow attentive they were\nwhen you are talking\nand how much they wanna\nmake you feel heard,\nunderstood, and happy.\nDoes this remind you of anyone?\nNumber six.\n\"You said you were having an awful day.\nWhat happened?\"\nMaybe you've mentioned\nthat you didn't feel well\nor were having a bad day.\nSomeone who really cares for you\nand is into you may get worried\nand check in from time to\ntime to make sure you're okay.\nIf you're already close with them,\nthey may even go out of their way\nto try to bring you food, medicine,\nor a pick me up just to\nmake you feel better.\nSo if there's someone who gets concerned\nwhen you mention that\nyou're not feeling too well\nand who rushes to your aid every time,\nthen it may be a sign that they see you\nas something more than just a friend.\nNumber seven.\n\"You like the new spider movie?\nMe, too.\"\nDo you have a lot in common with them?\nAnother sign that someone is into you\nis if they're always\nbringing up the things\nthat you both enjoy or like,\nwhether it's your favorite\nbooks, movies, music, or cuisine,\nhaving similar tastes and things\ncan build up a mutual attraction.\nSo if you find yourself\nalways saying things\nlike, \"I like that, too,\"\nor \"It's the same for me.\"\nWhen they talk about their\nthoughts, interest, and passions,\nthen it's likely that your\nfondness of them will increase.\nAfter all, birds of a\nfeather flock together.\nNumber eight.\n\"Do you wanna go out with me?\"\nLast but not least.\nThough, it's quite obvious.\nIf they ask you out on a date,\nthen they're definitely into you.\nWhile most people may try to\nbe subtle with their feelings,\nbeing direct is actually\nthe best way forward.\nThis is because sometimes\nflirting can be hard to identify.\nWere they flirting with\nyou or just being friendly?\nWas there a compliment\nbecause they like you\nor because they're just being positive?\nSubtle flirting can be confusing to read,\nand sometimes just unnoticeable.\nSo being direct is always\nthe best way to go.\nIt's more clear and easier to interpret.\nIs there someone who's into you?\nLet us know when the comments below.\nIf you found this video
