I likable?\"\nRegardless of the hype\naround being a lone wolf,\ntruth be told,\nbeing likable is a natural concern\nrooted in human nature for survival.\nSure, we don't need it to survive\nbeing eaten by wild animals anymore.\nInstead, it's necessary for survival\nin the modern jungle,\nwhere professional connections\nand romantic prospects\nare at stake.\nWondering where on the\nsurvivability scale you sit?\nLet's take a look\nat some likable personality\ncharacteristics,\nso you can figure that out.\nNumber one,\nyou are genuine.\nAre your beliefs,\nideals, and curiosities your own,\nor are they directed by an outside hand?\nWhen faced with a task to tackle,\ndo you just do as you're told,\nor is the approach more,\nhow can I do this to get\nwhat I need out of it?\nIf you can honestly say,\nthat, although you may listen to others,\nyour decisions are your own,\nit's highly probable that you\nare being true to yourself\nand a genuine person.\nWhat is it about being genuine\nthat is so likable?\nIt has to do with trust.\nIf you're showing how you really feel,\nand you're comfortable in your own skin,\nothers can feel they're getting the truth.\nThis authenticity also means the person\nhas self-awareness by looking inwards\nwhile staying grounded\nin who they truly are.\nNumber two,\nyou are a good listener.\nQuick, think of a scenario\nwhere you're in a conversation,\nwhat are you doing?\nAre you actively processing\nand understanding what is being said,\nor are you muttering things like,\n\"Mm-hmm, yeah, crazy, right?\"\nwhilst being distracted\nor impatiently waiting\nto say your piece?\nListening involves empathy,\nas well as comprehension.\nWhen we listen carefully,\nwe are considering the speaker's feelings\nand intentions\nwithout interfering with our own.\nConsideration implies care,\ngiving attention and\nrespect to the speaker,\nas well as the words spoken\nis telling the other person\nthat they are cared for,\nand are worthy of that care.\nWhat can we say?\nWe like being cared about.\nNumber three,\nyou're humble.\nNo, not humblebrag or false modesty,\nwe mean truly humble,\nwhich, ironically,\nis not something a humble person\nwould usually use to describe themselves.\nA humble person has humility.\nThey understand and accept\ntheir imperfections,\nso, won't hesitate to acknowledge\nand apologize for mistakes.\nThey will learn from\nthose and try to improve.\nThis is opposed to the I'm\nalways right individual.\nAs contradictory as it may sound,\nthe pliability humility brings\nis stronger than rigid arrogance.\nSomeone with humility\nis more approachable,\nbecause they appear reasonable.\nOthers know they won't\nget brashly shut down\nif they have a different\nor new opinion.\nHaving humility also means\nincreased emotional wellness\nand resilience.\nYou know that being wrong\nisn't the end of the world,\nand you trust yourself to fix it\nand improve on it.\nHumility,\ngood for you,\ngood for others.\nNumber four,\nyou are not judgemental.\nWe all have to make\njudgements on some things,\nor else we'd never make\na decision on anything.\nWhen it comes to how people are viewed,\nthere's a little more to the story.\nBeing non-judgmental with others\nshows a sense of balance and empathy.\nYou are able to embrace differences\nand can observe without giving a grade\nand sentencing on others'\nbehavior or words.\nCertainly, you may disagree\nwith someone's ideas or way of thinking,\nbut you can still accept\nand interact with them without judgment.\nYou don't think they are bad,\nbut you might simply consider,\n\"Is this difference so impactful\n\"that we'll just go down different roads?\"\nWe can't get along with\neveryone all the time,\nand that's okay.\nNumber five,\nyou're empathetic.\nThis ties into all the\nother characteristics.\nEmpathy, as described in this context,\nmeans not only the ability to understand,\nsee, and feel from the other\nperson's point of view,\nbut also care about others.\nThis allows for compassion towards others\nand the ability to challenge\none's own perceptions\nand prejudices towards people\nwith different viewpoints.\nAnd number six,\nyou greet people by their name.\nIf asked, \"Who are you?\"\nwe wouldn't be surprised\nif you started with,\n\"My name is...\"\nNames are an integral\npart of your identity,\nit's a proclamation of your presence.\nSo, when you address\nsomeone by their name,\nit means you've noticed them,\nthat you remembered them,\nand that they hold some importance to you.\nThe resulting atmosphere of respect,\nrecognition, and consideration\nis definitely a positive.\nSo, those were some\ncharacteristics to look for,\nnotice, maybe even practice.\nLikability does involve\nother people, though,\nso, we're not solely responsible for it.\nThere may be those who will never like us,\nno matter how likable we are,\nand that's not because\nyou did something wrong,\nwe do not control other people's feelings\nor how much they allow their own biases\nto affect them.\nYou, too, may find people that,\non paper,\nseem to be the most likable people,\nyet you feel a little meh about them,\nand that's not wrong,\nit's being human.\nWe like you, though,\nand we'd really like you to like us back,\ncommenting doesn't hurt either.\nThanks for watching,\nand catch you next time.\n(bright music fading)"
