    "transcript": "- [Narrator] They love\nme, they love me not.\nThese iconic lines echo\nin the fading light\nof the golden sun as you pluck\nthat pretty rose petal by petal.\nBeen there, done that, right?\nAs time passes, you\nrealize that the question\nwhether someone likes you or\nnot is a bit more complicated\nthan the local flora can handle.\nHere are five signs that someone\nis denying their feelings for you.\nNumber one, they get jealous easily.\nDo they sometimes react weirdly\nover totally normal occurrences?\nWhat are your thoughts on the\nrecent perilla leaves debate?\nWhich BTS member do you agree with?\nIn any relationship,\njealousy can rear its head\nat some point or other.\nYou might then question why someone\nwho hasn't stated their\nintentions becomes jealous of you\nwhen they see you with other people.\nIt's pretty straightforward.\nTheir jealousy is one of the signs\nthat they are denying\ntheir feelings for you.\nTheir own feelings are all\nover the place at the moment.\nThey can't seem to figure out\nwhy they're feeling the\nway they're feeling.\nThis inner conflict makes it difficult\nfor them to control their emotions\nor give a name to their feelings.\nNumber two, they're flirting,\nbut not following through.\nDo they compliment your appearance,\nconstantly seek your opinion,\nand are generally\npleasant in your presence?\nYet they still haven't asked you out\nor told you they like you.\nThis could be because they aren't sure\nhow they feel about you,\nor because they're\nunaware of your feelings.\nSometimes, when a person likes you,\nthey'll go out of their way\nand get incredibly flirty.\nAnd then they don't do anything else.\nThere's a chance they have a crush on you\nif they compliment you and find excuses\nto constantly be around you.\nBut they don't wanna rush things\nor just aren't quite sure how\nto breach the topic with you.\nIn either case, it is an indication\nthat they're hiding\ntheir genuine feelings.\nNumber three, they give you mixed signals.\nWere they oh so sweet\nto you at lunch today,\nbut didn't wanna sit\nnext to you on the bus?\nPerhaps they said they\ndidn't like your outfit,\nbut then asked to borrow your jacket.\nWhat?\nIf you constantly find\nyourself being pulled\nin different directions with them,\nit's because they keep\ngiving you mixed signs.\nThis hot and cold attitude\nis more about them than you.\nThey're trying to fight their feelings,\nor maybe make sense of them.\nThen it's throwing them\noff their game, ouch.\nIt can be tough when you like someone\nbut don't know what to do.\nSo they might be acting very weird.\nNumber four, they talk in parables.\nYou wanna detect whether\nsomeone likes you?\nIf yes, then you can keep a check\non how they talk about\nothers in their life.\nDo they stress that they are just friends\nwith the rest of their circle,\nand the best part is you\ndidn't even ask them about it?\nAlso, the person will also inquire\nabout your relationship\nstatus in subtle ways.\nThey might inquire about\nwho you hang out with\nwhen you wanna unwind and have a good time\nto see if they fit into your life.\nThey might be using such\nreferences to gauge your reaction\nin order to gain insight\ninto your daily life,\nall the while, rallying their\nforces to take the next step.\nMaybe, who knows?\nNumber five, the what ifs.\nAre you having wholesome\nconversations with them\nand exploring the potential\nof a future relationship,\nbut suddenly, they say\nthat there is no point\nin talking about it?\nAre they quick to put a damper\non all and any discussions\nof a future together?\nThis could be a sign that they're denying\ntheir feelings for you.\nThey might be harboring\nan irrational belief\nthat things just won't work out.\nTheir conversations are often punctuated\nby a pessimistic fear of the future.\nThey think you two might\nnot end up together,\nwhich may cloud their\njudgment of commitment.\nIt can be easy to get lost in translation\nor read too much between the lines.\nThe insecurity of your\nreaction towards them\nor fear of losing a good friend\nmight be some of the many\nreasons one decides to hold back\nfrom expressing their\ntrue feelings towards you.\nIf you suspect such is the case,\nit's always a good idea for\nyou to give them assurance,\nif the feelings are mutual.\nPlease keep in mind that\nwhile someone may be denying\ntheir feelings for you,\nif the situation becomes\nmanipulative or toxic,\nit's important to set\nboundaries or even ask for help.\nDo you know someone in your life\nwho's exhibited any of\nthese signs mentioned here?\nOr on the flip side, have\nyou exhibited any of them?\nFeel free to leave a comment\nwith your experience,\nfeedback, or suggestions.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the Like button\nand share it with others too.\nDon't forget to subscribe to Psych2Go,\nand hit the notification\nbell for more new videos.\nThanks for watching."
