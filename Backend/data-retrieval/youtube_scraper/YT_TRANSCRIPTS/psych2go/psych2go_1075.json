    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Go-ers.\nToday we're going to\ntalk about manipulation.\nManipulation is defined\nas trying to control\nor influence a person,\nor a situation cleverly\nunfairly, or unscrupulously.\nWhenever we label someone as manipulative\nit has a negative connotation to it,\nbut are you a bad person\nif you are manipulative?\nLet's find out with a story, get comfy.\nSadie and Jesse had been in a\nrelationship for four months,\nwhen they first met Jesse was kind,\ncaring, attentive, and romantic.\nSadie felt like the luckiest girl\nin the world for finding Jesse.\nThey went out on dates every weekend,\nmini adventures every weekend,\nSadie was falling in love.\nOne day, Sadie was getting ready\nfor one of their adventures\nand asked Jessie what he\nthought of her outfit.\n\"You're gonna wear that? You\njust wore that two weeks ago.\"\nsaid Jessie.\n\"Oh, you're right, I did. I\ntotally forgot, I'll go change.\"\nSadie said as she ran\nback into her closet.\nAs she changed she felt a little weird\nabout the whole situation\nbut decided it wasn't a big deal.\nOver the next month\nJessie started making\nmore comments like this\nand more frequently too.\nIt started with her clothes\nthen it moved to her hair, her makeup,\nhow she went about her\nday, and who she talked to,\nSadie's head over heels\nfeeling quickly disappeared,\nand she decided to break it off with him\ndue to his controlling behavior.\nAfter the breakup, Sadie\nasked her two friends,\nJenny and Thomas, to help her move\nto make sure Jessie\ndidn't know where she was.\nHowever he showed up on her\ndoorstep two days later.\nShe didn't tell him the new address,\nso how did he know where she was?\nSadie realized that\nonly one of her friends\ncould have told Jesse\nabout the new address.\nTo find out who it was Sadie\ntold both Jenny and Thomas\nthat she was planning\non moving out of state,\ndue to a job that she had just landed.\nShe told Jenny she was\nmoving to California.\nShe told Thomas she was moving to Texas.\nShe didn't wanna lie to them,\nbut she needed to be sure she was safe.\nLater that night Sadie's\nphone started buzzing.\nWhen she took a look,\nshe had 10 missed calls and seven texts\ndemanding she call Jessie\nand stating she couldn't move to Texas\nbecause he wants to work things out.\nOnce Sadie saw where Jesse\nthought she was moving\nshe blocked his and Thomas's numbers\nand made one final move\nwhere she couldn't be found.\nThe end.\nI don't know about you guys,\nbut I was a little worried\nabout Sadie for a minute.\nLet's talk about what happened.\nOkay, Sadie and Jesse\nhad a great relationship\nwhile they were in the honeymoon phase.\nBut as the relationship progressed,\nhe began showing his true personality.\nUnfortunately, Jesse\nseemed to have controlling\nand potentially abusive tendencies.\nSadie did the absolute right thing\nby leaving and moving somewhere else,\nbut when Thomas told Jesse\nwhere Sadie had moved,\nthat was a huge overstep.\nSadie had created a boundary\nbut Thomas ignored it.\nBecause of Jesse's actions\nSadie felt so uncomfortable\nthat she thought it was necessary\nto cut all ties with him and\nanyone associated with him.\nWhen Sadie told Jenny and Thomas\nshe got a job and was moving\nout of state, it was a lie.\nYes, it was deceptive.\nYes, it was manipulative.\nBut was she bad for doing so?\nIn my humble opinion,\nI believe the definition of\nmanipulate gives us our answer.\nAgain to manipulate is to\ncontrol or influence a person\nor situation cleverly,\nunfairly, or unscrupulously.\nIf we define unscrupulous,\nit means having or showing\nno moral principles.\nThis means you have no\nconcept of right or wrong\nand are just pulling\nstrings like a puppet master\nto get what you want.\nA 2006 study found that\nmanipulation is usually used\nas a substitute for mind control.\nWhen someone manipulates,\nthey do so with the\nintent of changing the way\nothers understand information,\ncreate conclusions, or\ndecide their actions.\nIn our story about Sadie,\nshe manipulated Jenny and Thomas\nand in turn manipulated Jessie.\nHowever, she did not do this\nwith any malicious intention.\nShe did this to ensure she was safe\nfrom a potentially abusive ex\nand friends who tried to\nreconnect him with her.\nSadie had good intentions when\nshe manipulated her friends,\nshe didn't lie just to\nwatch what happened,\nor to see if Jesse got mad at Thomas.\nIt was for her own wellbeing.\nThis is also a one time\nevent that happened to Sadie.\nUnless she makes a habit\nof doing things like this,\none time wouldn't necessarily\nget her labeled as manipulative.\nSo what do you think,\ndo you think Sadie is manipulative\nor bad for what she did?\nIs there another way\nSadie could have handled\nthe situation without manipulation?\nDo you have a situation\nwhere you manipulated someone\nfor a good reason?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nAll sources used are in\nthe description below.\nAs always keep your eye on\nPsy for more Psych2Go content."
