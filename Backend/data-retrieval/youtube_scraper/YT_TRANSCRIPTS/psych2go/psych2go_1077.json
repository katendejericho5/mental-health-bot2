    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hi, Psych2Goers.\nRecently, we made a video\nabout seven things you\nshould keep private.\nSome of you shared your thoughts with us\nand today, we'd like to acknowledge them.\nYou told us about the types of situations\nin which you shouldn't keep to yourself,\nbut instead should share\nwith those you trust.\nThese may include difficulties\nin your family,\nrelationships and workplace.\nAnd while sometimes, some things\nare best kept private to\navoid unnecessary problems,\nwe do encourage you to speak up\nabout serious issues you may be facing.\nTalking about those\nproblems in a safe setting,\nlike with a mental health\nprofessional or a close friend\ncould help you take the\nweight off your shoulders.\nSo, here are four things\nnot to keep private.\nNumber one, abuse in the\nfamily or relationships.\nIt's common to have disagreements\nwith your partner, friends, and family.\nMaybe you're annoyed\nthat they don't help\naround the house enough,\nbut sometimes when your\nrelationship problems go far\nbeyond chores and minor disputes,\nit's important to tell someone.\nAs mentioned by Shagoon Maurya,\nan Australian psychotherapist,\n\"Abuse can be a taboo subject,\nmaking it very difficult\nto openly discuss it.\"\nYou may feel guilty, ashamed, confused,\nor afraid that people will judge you,\nor won't take you seriously.\nFor these reasons,\nyou may feel like you just can't open up\nand then you suffer in silence.\nBut by keeping silent,\nyou may be giving your abuser\neven more power over you.\nWhen you talk about it, you\nshift that power back to you\nand you allow others to\nhelp you with your struggle.\nSybil Cummin, a licensed\nprofessional counselor\nin Colorado, suggests that,\n\"You find someone who you feel\nis trustworthy enough for you\nto share your story with.\"\nAnd if you don't feel like people\nin your life could help\nyou with your situation,\nyou should definitely seek\nhelp from professionals\nwhose job it is to help victims of abuse\nstand back on their feet.\nNumber two, depression or\nother mental health problems.\nEven though psychology and mental health\nis now more accessible than ever before,\nit's still underestimated,\nnot understood and stigmatized.\nFor these reasons, when\nyou're feeling down,\nyou may just put on a happy\nmask and pretend you're okay.\nThis is commonly called\nbottling up your emotions.\nAnd it can be extremely damaging\nfor your mental and physical health.\nAccording to clinical\npsychologist, Victoria Tarratt,\nsuppressing your emotions\nwhether it's anger,\nsadness, grief, or frustration\ncan lead to physical stress on your body.\nIt can affect blood pressure,\nmemory, and self-esteem.\nSo, talking about your\nproblems with someone you trust\nnot only helps you get all\nthose negative emotions\nout of your system,\nbut it can also help fight the stigma\nthat surrounds the topic of mental health.\nBy sharing your experiences,\nyou can show others\nthat they're not alone.\nThis was confirmed by a new study\npublished in the \"Community\nMental Health Journal\"\nwhich found that young adults\nwho shared their stories\nabout living with mental illness\nincreased their wellbeing\nand felt less stigmatized.\nDon't suffer alone.\nThere will always be\nsomeone willing to help.\nNumber three, unequal pay or\ndifficult financial situation.\nSometimes, people are just nosy,\nespecially those you don't know well.\nThey may use your financial\nsituation to shame you\nif they think you earn too little\nor mock you out of jealousy if\nthey think you earn too much.\nWith those people, it's\nbest to just let them know\nthat your money is none of their business,\nbut there are situations\nin which talking about money\ncan actually be important.\nEven though we live in a modern society,\nwe still haven't solved\nthe problem of unequal pay.\nFor example, recent data\nfrom the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics in 2020\nsuggest that women earn\nsignificantly less than men,\neven for the same job.\nOn top of that, managers\nsometimes take advantage\nof inexperienced workers\nand may offer you less than\nwhat you should be getting.\nIf you suspect you're\nearning less than you should,\ntalking about money with your coworkers\ncould help you figure out\nwhat you should be paid\nand allow you to stand up for your rights.\nJust make sure you trust them enough,\nso they don't bad-mouth\nyou in front of your boss.\nSimilarly, if you're\nstruggling financially,\nit may be good to share your struggles\nwith someone you're close with.\nIt may be embarrassing and\ndifficult to talk about,\nbut if you're struggling so much\nthat you can barely afford\nfood or basic hygiene,\nyour friends would surely\nbe happy to help you out.\nThey may even be able\nto lend you a few bucks\nfor necessities or help\npay for your grocery trip.\nOr maybe even introduce\nyou to job opportunities.\nAnd number four, your\ngoals and future plans.\nSome studies suggest\nthat if you share your goals\nand dreams with others,\nyou might be less likely to chase them.\nThat might sometimes be true for instances\nwhere you are not really\na hundred percent sure\nif that's what you want to pursue,\nbut when it comes to something\nyou're really passionate about,\nsharing those goals\nwith others could ensure\nyou get the help, connection,\nand support you need to\nget on the path to success.\nBut when sharing those dreams,\npay attention to who you're\ntelling your plans to.\nA recent 2020 study\npublished in the \"Journal\nof Applied Psychology\"\nstates that you can have\ngreater goal commitment\nand performance if you tell\nyour goal to someone you believe\nhas higher status than you,\nor if you truly value\nthat person's opinion.\nHoward Klein, lead author of that study\nand professor of management\nand human resources at the\nOhio State University explains,\nyou wanna be dedicated\nand unwilling to give up on your goal,\nwhich is more likely\nwhen you share that goal\nwith someone you look up to.\nSo, when talking about your goals,\nmake sure you share them\nwith someone you respect.\nIn that way, you'll make sure\nit won't be just all talk and no action.\nDo you agree that these things\nshouldn't be kept private,\nbut shared with someone\nyou like and trust?\nWhat are some other things\nthat are best shared with someone?\nRemember to like, subscribe,\nand share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get
