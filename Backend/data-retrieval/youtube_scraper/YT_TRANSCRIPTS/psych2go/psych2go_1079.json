    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hi, Psych2Goers.\nIs there someone you\nthink has a crush on you?\nKnowing that someone is attracted to you\ncan make you feel happy\nand good about yourself.\nAnd naturally, you'll want\nthat attraction to last\nas long as possible,\nbut sometimes you might get carried away\nand not realize that\nyou're making mistakes\nthat are diminishing the\nattraction they have for you.\nSo to help you become more aware\nof some of your behaviors,\nhere are five mistakes\nthat kill attraction.\nNumber one.\nInsecurity.\nAre you a confident person?\nOr are you very insecure about yourself?\nWhile it's normal to doubt\nyourself from time to time,\nthe attraction that\nsomeone feels towards you\nmight start to disappear when\nyou let your insecurities\ntake over you.\nThis may include constant\nnegative comments about yourself\nsuch as, \"I'm too stupid\nto understand this.\nAre you sure I look good?\nOr, I don't think I'm good enough.\"\nWhile others may help you at first,\nthis constant self-doubt\nand need for reassurance\ncould get exhausting for them,\nespecially when they're trying to make you\nbelieve in something you\ndon't see in yourself.\nEven though it's hard to control\nhow you feel about yourself,\nit's still important to try to work\non building a positive self-image,\nand to avoid relying solely on one person\nto validate your self-worth.\nWhen you do,\nyou may start to notice\nothers respond positively\nto your new energy.\nNumber two.\nJealousy and possessive behavior.\nDo you get jealous easily?\nWhether it's always calling your partner\nto see who they hang out with,\ngoing through their phone,\nor stopping them from going out\nwith their friends or family\nso they could spend time with you?\nThese are all types of behavior\nthat may frustrate your partner\nand make them feel like you\ndon't respect them at all.\nThey may also feel\nsuffocated by the intensity\nof your lack of trust\nand decide to take a step back.\nIf you find yourself\ndealing with this a lot,\nyou may wanna work on finding\nthe core of your trust issues,\nso you can understand and\novercome that problem.\nNumber three.\nBeing overly critical.\nAre you always criticizing them\nfor doing the dishes wrong?\nOr complaining that they don't dress well?\nOftentimes it can be useful\nto hear what you did wrong\nto know how to do better next time,\nas long as it's done respectfully,\nand with good intentions,\nit's quite normal\nif you sometimes critique\nyour partner's behavior.\nHowever, if you start to\nbecome overly critical\nabout everything they do all the time,\nthen you may lose the attraction\nthat they have for you.\nNegative comments about\nhow they're not doing\nthings the right way,\nor how they constantly make mistakes,\ncan make them feel unappreciated,\nand cause them to only\nexpect the worst from you.\nSo if you try to keep things positive\nand emphasize the good things,\ninstead of the bad,\nyou could keep the spark\nbetween you going long.\nNumber four.\nSpending too much time with technology.\nIs it hard to not check your phone?\nPerhaps you say, \"That you'll\njust take a quick look.\"\nBut find yourself still typing\nand scrolling 10 minutes later.\nno matter how useful your phone is\nit can often make you\nneglect the ones around you.\nWhether it's spending\nhours playing PlayStation\nor watching TV,\nwhen you spend too much\ntime with technology\nwhile you're with someone,\nit tells them that you're\nuninterested and unavailable.\nThey might feel ignored\nand bored in your company,\nthen the attraction they felt towards you\nmight start to fade away over time.\nSo if you feel something like this\ncould be happening to you,\ntry to put your phone on silent\nwhen you spend time with your partner.\nShow them that they've\ngot your full attention.\nAnd number five.\nNegativity.\nWhat kind of aura or vibe do you put out?\nYour mood can definitely have an effect\non how the people around you feel.\nIf you're constantly negative,\nthen those around you can\nfeel it and recognize it too.\nAnd so if you're spending time\nwith someone who likes you,\nsurrounding them with negativity\ncould quickly kill their\nattraction towards you.\nAs Laurel Steinberg, PhD\nrelationship therapist,\nand professor of psychology\nat Columbia University, said,\n\"Being too negative in a relationship\ncan have many damaging\neffects on both parties,\nand on the relationship itself.\nNegativity makes other\npeople feel depressed,\nis a total buzzkill,\nand can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nNegativity also reduces libido.\"\nIt's clear you don't want\nthis in your relationship,\nso be aware of the energy you put out.\nHave you done any of these?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video with those\nwho might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe
