    "transcript": "- Hello, Psych2Go viewers.\nHere are five early warning signs\nyou should never ignore in a relationship,\nby Michelle Rivas.\nThe feeling of a new relationship can feel\nso exciting and passionate,\neven intoxicating,\n(soft music)\nespecially since there's\nalways the potential\nthat it can blossom\ninto a profound and long-lasting bond.\nHowever, it's always\nimportant to stay attuned\nto the behavioral\npatterns of our partners,\nbecause it can help us\ndetect red flags early on.\nBeing observant of toxic behaviors\nfrom the start can prevent\nus from jumping into\na serious commitment,\nand maybe even walk away\nfrom a situation that could\nbe potentially dangerous,\nsuch as domestic violence\nor narcissistic abuse.\nSo, here are five early warning signs\nyou should never ignore in a relationship.\nNumber one, love bombing.\nYou just started dating someone\nand everything seems perfect.\nThey're attentive,\ngenerous, and make you feel\nlike the most attractive\nperson they've ever met.\nBut do they come off a little too strong?\nAre they calling or\ntexting you excessively\nthroughout the day?\nDo they profess their love for you\nonly after a few days or weeks of dating?\nThis is a red flag early\non in a relationship\nthat should not be ignored.\nFor those unfamiliar with\nthe term love bombing,\nthis refers to a form\nof emotional manipulation\nthat consists of a person\nmoving too quickly at the beginning stages\nof a relationship, and\nshowering the other person\nwith praise and affection.\nTo be clear, romantic gestures\nand affection are completely\nnormal aspects of dating,\nbut it can also be a sign\nof something sinister\nif done excessively right from the start.\nNumber two, subtle coercion.\nControlling behavior and coercive\ncontrol are obvious signs\nof domestic violence\nand/or abusive behavior.\nBut the way in which they\nshow up at the beginning\nof a relationship are usually\nvery subtle and gradual.\nAccording to Emma Davey,\nnarcissistic abuse expert\nand counselor, abusers like\nto be in control all the time,\nand they do this by tracking\ntheir partner's activity.\nThey will monitor where you're\ngoing, who you're going with,\nfor how long, your social media activity,\nand who you're talking to on the phone.\nAt first, an abuser will apply\nmany subtle coercive tactics,\nsuch as needing to know\nabout your daily whereabouts,\nmaking suggestions about what\nyou should wear, et cetera,\nand masking these demands\nas altruistic by claiming\nthat they're concerned for\nyour safety and wellbeing.\nIf you notice that your\nnew partner requires\nthat you inform them of everywhere you go,\nand feels the need to\naccompany you everywhere,\nthen this could be a warning sign.\nNumber three, hypersensitivity.\nIf you've been with your partner\nfor a short period of time\nand you've noticed that\nthey're easily triggered\nby innocuous comments or harmless\njokes, then this could be\na sign of hypersensitivity,\nwhich is a common trait\namongst most abusers.\nIt's also common for these individuals\nto take unrelated or harmless\ncomments as personal attacks,\nand twist the narrative,\nsuch as claiming that\nyou're trying to disrespect\nthem when you're merely\njust disagreeing with them and\nexpressing your own opinion.\nNumber four, they dislike\nyour friends or family.\nDoes your new partner express disapproval\nevery time you go out\nwith your closest friends\nor family members?\nThey might make you feel guilty\nfor spending time with\nthose closest to you,\nand try to convince you\nthat they're bad influences.\nOr, say that you're too good for them.\nThis is a subtle tactic\nthat abusers use to slowly\nisolate you from your support system.\nSo, it's extremely important\nto be aware of this early on,\nand check for patterns\nof possessive behavior.\nAnd number five, rushing into commitment.\nIf you just started dating someone\nand you can sense that\nthey're trying to pressure you\ninto a committed relationship,\nand rush into important\nmilestones, such as meeting\neach other's families\nand moving in together,\nthen this is a huge red flag\nthat should not be ignored.\nThis is usually in\ntandem with love bombing,\nwhere the person will idealize\ntheir significant other\nand smother them with\npraise and attention.\nAnother sign of this is\nsaying the words I love you\nafter a very short period of time.\nAnd pressuring you to do the same.\nIf this sounds familiar to\nwhat you've been experiencing\nin your new relationship, you may need\nto proceed with caution.\nYou have agency over your life,\nand you shouldn't feel obligated to commit\nto a relationship if\nyou're not fully ready."
