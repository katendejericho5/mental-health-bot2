    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nIs your friend acting a\nbit more than friendly?\nDo you feel they might\nactually have a crush on you?\nYou may think it's weird,\nbut it's not unusual\nfor people to start liking their friends.\nYou became friends\nbecause you liked\nsomething about the other.\nAnd those feelings can\nsometimes cross the line\nbetween friendship and romantic love.\nBut when you suspect that\nit can be a confusing situation.\nMaybe you feel it would be too\nawkward to ask them directly.\nHere are six signs\nyour friend actually\nwishes to be your lover.\nNumber one, they wanna\nbe near you all the time.\nWhen you hang out in a group,\ndo they pull you aside to talk,\nsit next to you every time\nor walk next to you only?\nOr do they try to find\nways to hang out with you\nwithout the group?\nSpending time with someone you like\nquickly becomes a priority.\nYou always wanna be near them.\nEven sitting in silence is exciting\nif your crush is next to you.\nIf your friend is trying to spend\nmore than usual time with\nyou as much as they can,\nit could mean they wanna\nbe more than friends.\nMaybe they also text you\nmore than they text others\nand they don't seem as interested in them\nas they are in you, and they\nmight seem a bit jealous\nwhen you have plans with someone else.\nNumber two, they want to\ntake pictures together.\nDo they constantly take out their phone\nto take a selfie with you?\nWhen they wanna create a\ndeeper connection with you,\nthey won't seem to care\nabout groupfies much.\nTheir phone gallery\nmight be full of pictures\nof just the two of you.\nThis could be a sign\nthat they're so head over heels for you,\nthat they spend their days\nlooking at your pictures\nand dreaming of what could be.\nNumber three, they're\nalways there for you.\nDo they blow off everything\njust to spend time with you?\nAre they willing to\nget halfway across town\njust to meet you for a quick coffee?\nWhen somebody has deeper feelings for you,\nthey're ready to go far and beyond.\nSo, half hour walk in the rain\njust to see your loved one\ndoesn't seem so bad.\nThey listen more closely\nto what you are saying\nin order to understand you better.\nAnd most importantly,\nyou're sure they're not gonna abandon you\nwhen you need them the most.\nDo you know anyone else who\nwill always be there for you?\nWell, it's Psych2Go.\nWith so many people confused\nabout their relationship\ntroubles these days,\nwe're more committed than ever\nto making relationship content\nmore accessible to everybody.\nThank you for sticking with us.\nDid you know that subscribing to Psych2Go\nand hitting the like button\nmay make that special someone\nwant to be more than friends with you?\nJust kidding, but still\nit would mean a lot to us.\nNumber four, they notice\nchanges in your appearance.\nDid they compliment you\neven when you only trimmed your hair?\nOr when you wore that extra\nnice shirt for the first time?\nThey are quick to notice\nevery little tiny detail\nyou thought no one would notice.\nIf that description fits them,\nit means they're paying attention.\nAnd paying attention to someone\nis usually a clear sign of attraction.\nThey probably can't take\ntheir eyes off of you\nand noticing small things like the hat\nalso gives them the opportunity\nto sneak in a compliment.\nNumber five, they're nervous around you.\nAre they suddenly seeming nervous\nor awkward around you lately?\nBeing next to your crush\ncan feel so exciting\nthat you temporarily\nforget how to talk or walk.\nThey may touch their\nhair or fix their clothes\nwhile anxiously looking your way.\nThey probably feel like they\nneed to be perfect around you\nand they're scared to mess it up.\nThey want you to think they're the best\nso they're trying to be\nthe best when around you.\nSo sweet.\nAnd number six, they\navoid the topic of love.\nIt can hurt seeing your crush\nfall in love with another.\nIf your friend is interested in you,\nthey'll be hesitant about\nthe topic of love around you.\nThey avoid talking about\nlove life altogether,\nbe it yours or theirs.\nThey change the topic or act nervous\nwhen someone asks about love.\nIt's quite possible that\nthey don't have the courage\nto be open about their\nfeelings towards you.\nSo, they would rather stay\nin their little bubble\nhoping you'll notice their affection.\nLove is complicated.\nYou can never know for real\nwhat makes a person's heart beat faster.\nTry hanging out with\nthem as you always did.\nIf you like them too\nyou can encourage them\nto make the first move.\nEven if you're still confused\nabout their feelings,\ntime will tell for sure.\nOr maybe they'll tell you themselves.\nWho knows?\nSo, what do you think?\nCould there really be some sparks there?\nDo you know about some other\nsigns that weren't mentioned?\nFeel free to leave a comment\nwith your experiences,\nfeedback or suggestions.\nIf
