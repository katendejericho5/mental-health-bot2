    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nhas someone caught your interest?\nDo you feel butterflies in\nyour stomach around them?\nUnless you have a strange addiction\nto eating live winged insects,\nit's likely you have a crush.\nBut how can you tell if they\nfeel the same way about you?\nAre they at least interested in you?\nWell, here are some common\nsigns that someone likes you.\nHere are six signs someone\nis interested in you.\nNumber 1, they're awkward only around you.\nDo you get nervous around your crush?\nA lot of people can become\na bit awkward at first\nwhen someone they like talks to them.\nIf you notice your crushes behavior\nstrangely shifts when they notice you,\nthis could be a sign that\nyou make them nervous.\nThis is likely because\nthey're attracted to you.\nSo if you notice they start\nto fumble over their words\nor get lost staring into your eyes,\nthey're probably very nervous\nbeing around someone\nthey find so attractive.\nNumber 2, their voice changes pitch,\nand their tone is different around you.\nYou've been noticing\nyour crush talks to you\ndifferently than other people,\nor maybe their tone is\nsuddenly lower or higher\nwhen talking to you.\nFor women, their voice will\noften become more high-pitched,\nwhile men will often deepen their voice\nwhen attracted to someone.\nTheir tone may also change as well.\nSuddenly, they're much kinder,\nor perhaps their voice\nsounds a bit sexier.\nMaybe they sound very\ngentle or mysterious.\nEither way, unless they sound rude,\nthey may subconsciously be doing\nthis because they like you.\nNumber 3, they're engaged\nin your conversations.\nHaving a deep conversation\nwith them, look closely.\nDid they look engaged\nin your conversation,\nor are they on their phone?\nAre they scanning around the room?\nAre they looking at something else?\nIf they don't engage with you often\non an emotional level or even\nany level during your outings,\nthen it's likely they don't\nlike you on an emotional level.\nHowever, if they ask follow up questions\nand keep their focus with you,\nthen it's another good sign\nthey are interested in you.\nNumber 4, they text you often\nand comment on your social media.\nDo you and your crush\nhave each other's number?\nDo they text you often,\nor maybe they message you on social media,\ncomment on your posts.\nIf they wanna be more\nthan friends with you,\nthey'll likely want to keep\nup the conversation with you\nnot just with in-person\nchats, but online as well.\nIf they are into social media\nand are often on their phone,\nthey'll likely show their\ninterest through texts,\nfunny memes, or gifts,\nand a few flirty texts as well.\nThey could be shy, so\nthey may be trying to hint\nat hanging out with you first,\nor maybe they just go right\ninto the subtle flirting\nwith the heart emoji.\nNumber 5,\nthey keep the conversation\ngoing and ask questions.\nDo they try to keep the conversation going\nby asking questions\nand mentioning interesting\npoints of their own?\nIt can sometimes be difficult to do this,\nbut if they've been trying\nto continue chats with you,\nthis is a good sign they like you.\nThis can be through text too.\nThis could mean they bring up\nrandom things about their day,\ninteresting comments on\na show they're watching,\nor even send those funny memes.\nThey'll try to make an\nexcuse to talk to you.\nAnd once you start talking,\nthey'll generally put a bit of effort\ninto keeping the conversation going,\nbut often, for a conversation to continue,\nyou'll wanna put an effort too,\nif you don't,\nthey may be wondering if you like them\nas much as they like you.\nSo let them know you\nenjoy talking to them.\nThen your conversations\nmay become effortless.\nAnd number 6,\nthey're always hinting that\ntheir schedule is free,\nor they ask you out.\nDo they find ways to\nmention their schedule\nand how free they are this\nTuesday or a Friday afternoon?\nMaybe they randomly mention\nthey have an extra ticket to a concert\nand ask if you like the band?\nBut it flies past you,\nand you say, \"You've never\nreally heard their music.\"\nMy friend, (sighing)\nthey may be trying to hint\nthat they wanna hang out with you.\nI don't know why you can't\nboth just ask each other out,\nbut every scenario is different.\nIf they hint that they wanna go somewhere\nand are free on a certain day,\nnow's your chance to ask them.\nIf they're not putting the\neffort to even ask you out\nor at least hint at their availability,\nthey may not be into you.\nIf you have hung out before,\nbut they've grown distant\nin asking you out,\nthey may not be as interested as before.\nThe trick is, if you\nwanna hang out with them,\ngo ahead and ask them.\nThey may be trying to hint\nthat they're available\nand are waiting for you\nto make the first move.\nYou never know.\nThey could just feel\nthe same way about you\nthat you feel about them.\nSo somebody please make a move,\nbefore those butterflies in your stomach\nstart to make you sick.\nSo have you noticed any of these signs?\nWhen's the last time you got\nbutterflies in your stomach\nfrom being around someone?\nFeel free to let us know in\nthe comment section down below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video,\nand if you did, don't forget\nto click the like button\nand share it
