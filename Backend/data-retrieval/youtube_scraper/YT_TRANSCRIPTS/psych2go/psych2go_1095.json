    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, friends.\nWelcome back to another video.\n(yawning) How much sleep\ndid you get last night?\nScience recommends seven to eight hours\nfor a full night's rest.\nIt may be tempting to stay up for work,\nstudy or leisure and sacrifice some sleep,\nbut science shows you could be\nsacrificing brain functions.\nHere are five things\nthat happen to your brain\nif you don't get enough sleep.\nNumber one, you'll be less alert.\nAre you paying full attention?\nIf you didn't get enough sleep,\nyou might not be as alert as you think.\nA study from South\nAustralia gave participants\na simple hand-eye coordination task\nto measure the effects\nof fatigue on alertness.\nAfter 10 hours awake,\ntheir average performance\non the test took a downturn.\nAfter 24 hours awake,\ntheir alertness was just as impaired\nas people with a 0.10%\nblood alcohol level,\nabove the legal limit of\nintoxication in the United States.\nThe study concluded that\nonly one night without sleep\nis as mentally damaging as\nbeing too drunk to drive.\nNumber two, your reaction\ntimes will be slower.\nHow quickly do you react\nto what happens around you?\nReacting quickly is\nimportant in many tasks,\nbut research has also\nfound concerning links\nbetween sleep loss and reaction times.\nStudies asked participants\nto press a button\nas quickly as possible after random cues.\nEven a small difference\nlike sleeping for six hours a night\nproduced a significant\nslowing in reaction time.\nSome also failed to respond\nat all to some cues,\nwhich may be caused by microsleep periods\nwhere the brain temporarily lapses\nout of conscious awareness.\nNumber three, your emotions will suffer.\nHow's your mood after\na night without sleep?\nSleep deprived individuals\nreport extremely negative moods,\nhigh irritability, and volatile emotions.\nResearch shows that sleep deprivation\nfloods the body with stress hormones\nand causes you to blame others more\nand reduces the ability to solve problems\nand decrease self-esteem, empathy,\nand impulse control.\nParticipants who were forced\nto stay up for 56 hours\nhad clinically significant\nincreases in depression,\nanxiety, and paranoia,\nshowing that sleep is necessary for normal\nemotional functioning.\nNumber four, your, your, your memory,\nyour memory will decline.\nHow many of the previous\npoints do you remember?\nIn sleep deprivation experiments,\nscientists have found that REM sleep,\nthe deepest phase of sleep,\nis necessary to remember\ncomplex facts and procedures\nlearned the previous day.\nWhen you have a big test\ncoming up the next day,\nscientists recommend that\nyou spend the night sleeping\nrather than cramming.\nAnd number five, your sense\nof humor will disappear.\nDo you think you're pretty funny?\nIf you've been losing sleep lately,\nyou may wanna think again.\nIn a study by the Walter Reed\nArmy Institute of Research,\nparticipants who were deprived of sleep\nare shown some simple\nvisual and verbal jokes.\nTheir understanding of the\njokes was far below average\ncompared to healthy individuals.\nEven when given caffeine,\ntheir sense of humor was\nstill highly stunted.\nDo you relate to any of the symptoms\nmentioned in this video?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nAnd don't forget to like\nand share this video\nif you think it might help someone else.\nThe studies and references used\nare listed in the description below.\nThanks so much for watching.\nUntil next time, Psychic2goers."
