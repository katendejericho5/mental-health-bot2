    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\ndo you want some subtle tips and tricks\nthat can make you appear more attractive?\nSometimes the strangest\nthings can draw us to someone,\nand there are quite a few habits\nthat can make someone drawn to you.\nHere are five easy habits\nthat make you instantly more attractive.\nNumber one, show your androgynous side.\nA 1983 study published\nin Administrative Science Quarterly found\nthat those who have a mix of feminine\nand masculine qualities were perceived\nas more attractive by their test subjects.\nThe study states the results indicated\nthat, \"Androgynous persons\nwere favorably perceived\non the gender-linked dimensions\nof instrumentality and expressivity\nand exerts neutral desirable traits.\"\nThey were regarded as better\nadjusted, more likable,\nand as having an advantage\nin the occupational domain compared\nto masculine and feminine persons.\nThe Encyclopaedia Britannica\nexplains that in psychology,\n\"Androgyny refers to individuals\nwith strong personality traits\nassociated with both sexes,\ncombining toughness and gentleness,\nassertiveness and nurturing behavior\nas called for by the situation.\"\nSo any androgynous traits, features,\nor styles can be helpful\nwhen you're out on a date with your crush.\nNumber two, be around your\ngroup of friends at first.\nEver heard of the cheerleader effect?\nThis is when people perceive\nothers as more attractive\nwhen they're in a group.\nA 2013 study published\nin the journal Psychological\nScience tested this theory\nand their results supported\nthe cheerleader effect.\nThe authors state,\n\"Individual faces will\nseem more attractive\nwhen presented in a group\nbecause they will appear more similar\nto the average group face,\nwhich is more attractive\nthan group member's individual faces.\"\nWe tested this hypothesis\nin five experiments\nin which subjects rated the attractiveness\nof faces presented,\neither alone or in a group\nwith the same gender.\nOur results were consistent\nwith the cheerleader effect.\nSo if you're at a party,\nit might be a good idea\nto catch your crush's attention first\nwhen you're with your group of friends.\nThen, when you're alone, let\nthem know you're approachable\nby displaying some open\nbody language, a smile,\nand those flirty eyes.\nNumber three, work on your\nemotional intelligence.\nOne habit you can work\non, improving your EQ.\nEmotional intelligence is\nall about communicating\nand managing your emotions\nin an effective way.\nEmotionally intelligent people\noften have an easier time\nunderstanding their emotions\nand reflecting on them\nbefore simply acting on them\nout of instinct or habit.\nThey take a moment before\nresponding strongly\ndue to a sudden emotion\nor feeling during a heated discussion\nor intense conversation.\nThey also reflect on their feelings\nin a calm and productive way.\nThis helps them make healthy decisions\nand communicate better\nwith those around them and themselves.\nThis can help you appear more\nconfident, less insecure,\nand less defensive, which can\nbe very attractive to others.\nMake it a habit to reflect more and pause,\nand think before you respond\nor react to your emotions.\nIt's not only likely to be an\nattractive quality to others\nbut can help you in the long\nrun emotionally, anyway.\nNumber four, listen with the intent\nto really understand the other person.\nHow often do you actually listen\nto what the other person is saying\nwith an intention to understand them?\nAre you just waiting for a\nyour turn to speak again?\nCertified positive psychology\nlife coach Karen Austin\nexplained in her Psychology Today article\nthat research shows\nthat only about 10% of\nus listen effectively.\nShe also explains\nthat active listening\nis an essential skill,\nand one of the best ways to\nconnect with another person.\nThe good news is that it's a skill\nthat can be improved with some effort.\nIt also bears noting that\nthere's a distinct difference\nbetween hearing and listening.\nHearing is a psychological act.\nListening involves your ability\nto unpack the meaning of words\nand the silence in between.\nThink about it.\nWould you be more attracted to someone\nwho understood you and let you speak\nor someone who only\nfocused on their points\nwith no care to understand or\nrespond thoughtfully to yours?\nIt's not to say that you'd\nwant someone who only listens\nand never has an opinion of theirs to say.\nRemember, you have to\nlisten to them as well.\nThoughtful and active\nlistening is something\nthat can be practiced,\na habit that can be formed,\nand it's an attractive one at that.\nAnd number five, introduce yourself\nand talk to someone new often.\nHow often do you approach\nsomeone who intrigues you?\nDo you try to get to know new\npeople at your friend's party\nor do you shy away from it?\nHaving the confidence,\nand sometimes courage,\nto approach someone new is\nsomething that is often admired.\nThe more you break out\nof your comfort zone\nand introduce yourself to new people,\nstriking up conversations with\nthose you find interesting,\nthe more you'll get used to it.\nThen you may just be a bit more confident\nin your approach towards\nmeeting new people.\nYou may not only make a new friend\nin the process of doing so\nbut also appear more confident\nand attractive to them\nbecause of your boldness,\nas long as they're comfortable\nwith you continuing to\ntalk to them as well.\nApproaching someone and being unafraid\nto strike up a new conversation with them\nnot only makes you appear\nconfident, but with due time,\nyou may start improving your confidence\nand comfortability with\nnew people as well.\nSo make it a habit to talk\nto those you want to talk to.\nThey may just find your confidence\nadmirable or attractive.\nSo which of these tips will you try?\nFeel free to let us know in\nthe
