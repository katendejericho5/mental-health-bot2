    "transcript": "- [Narrator] There's been a huge decline\nin mental health around the world,\nwhich is why we're so committed\nto creating more content\nthan we ever have.\nThanks for being a part of our journey.\nThe habits you have, good and bad,\nare mostly subconscious.\nIt's not something you\noften give much thought to,\nbut these little things\nhave been dropping hints\nabout your personality all along.\nSo are you curious about\nwhat links your personality\nand your habits?\nLet's look at seven habits\nthat reveal your true personality.\nNumber one, clothing preference.\nDo you like to wear casual clothes\nor do you prefer professional attire?\nA study by Erickson and Sirgy revealed\nthat formal and business like attire\nis used by career-oriented individuals\nto reinforce self-image.\nA study from the University of Manchester\nfound that those who prefer\nto wear casual style clothes\nhave low conforming attitudes,\nas they wanna enhance\ntheir sense of freedom.\nMeanwhile, socially\nconscientious individuals\nprefer evening style outfits.\nThose with more conventional\npersonality types\nprefer to wear formal clothes\nwith a lack of color or design.\nNumber two, shopping habits.\nA new pair of shoes\nfrom your favorite brand\nhas just hit the shelves,\nwould you prefer to buy them online\nor do you go to the physical store?\nA study conducted by Breazale and Lueg,\ncomparing offline and\nonline shopping behavior,\nshowed that more extroverted individuals\nspend the most time and money at the mall,\nand the least time online.\nA different study demonstrated\nthat those who buy impulsively\ntend to have a higher tendency\nto experience psychological distress.\nThis might be due to their belief\nthat shopping can temporarily\nalleviate mental distress.\nNumber three, daily routines.\nDid you know even your\nmundane every day to-do list\ncan reveal a lot about your personality?\nA study by Chapman and Goldberg\nfound the degree of\nagreeableness in individuals\ncan be revealed by the\nkind of chores they do.\nFor those higher up on the\nscale of agreeableness,\nyou spend more time doing domestic chores,\nsuch as ironing or washing the dishes.\nYou are also highly motivated\nto keep other people happy.\nIn addition, you are more likely to sing\nwhile in the shower or in the car.\nExtroverted individuals are\nfound to spend their time\nplanning parties or talking on the phone\nmaking plans for the next adventure.\nNumber four, professional stress.\nHow would you describe yourself\nwhen you are faced with\nworkplace stressors?\nAre you more prone to\nthink of it as a challenge,\nor do you tend to view\nit from a negative lens?\nA study by Chen and Spector demonstrated\nthat personality is associated\nwith perceptions of the work environment.\nFor example, extreme conscientiousness\nor someone who is anxious about\nthe tiniest of tiny details\nis more inclined to perceive\nthe work environment\nas stressful.\nNumber five, the way you walk.\nHave you ever sat on a bench and observed\nthe myriad of ways that people walk?\nSome walk with heavy stomping,\nsome with strong lunging steps\nor some walk slowly with soft steps.\nA study published in the\nJournal of Nonverbal Behavior\nfound that individuals with\nhigh physical aggression\npossess greater relative movement\nbetween the upper and lower body.\nIn other words, an aggressive\nwalk is characterized\nby exaggerated body motion.\nApart from that,\nCesario and McDonald reported\nthat extroverted personalities\nare more likely to walk with confidence.\nOn the other hand, you're\nmore likely to be introverted,\nIf you walk slowly with soft steps.\nNumber six, hobbies\nDo you spend your free time\nlost in fictional worlds\nor do you spend your time\nsweating it out on the tennis court?\nHave you ever wondered why\nyou prefer to participate\nin certain activities\nduring your leisure time?\nAnd what does it say\nabout your personality?\nA study by Eysenck, Nias, and Cox\ndemonstrated that extrovert people\nare more likely to spend their free time\nin sporting activities.\nMoreover, a study by Wilkinson and Hansen\nreported that individuals who\nare more open to experiences\nwere more involved in\ncultural aesthetic leisure,\nsuch as cultural arts,\nliterature, and writing.\nAnd number seven, written words.\nDo you tend to write in\nlarge or small letters?\nIs the dot on your I's placed high or low.\nPsst,\nit's okay if they were tiny\nhearts instead of dots.\nAccording to a theory\nby K Amend and others,\nthe word slant, writing\npressure, connecting strokes,\nand spaces between lines\ncan convey specific\ncharacteristics of the writers.\nIf you write in a vertical slant,\nyou are someone who finds it\neasy to control your emotions,\nwhile writing with a moderate left slant,\nmay show you find it hard\nto express your emotions.\nThose who want to be in permanent control\nand have low self-esteem write\nin an extreme left slant.\nAs for those who can easily verbalize\ntheir emotions and opinions,\nthey tend to write in\na moderate left slant.\nFinally, individuals who are\nimpulsive and lack self-control\nwrite in an extreme right slant.\nContrary to popular belief,\nyour personality is not\nset and stoned by 30.\nIt was recently discovered\nthat your personality\nis quite malleable as you grow older.\nBased on a study on personality,\nthere is roughly a 25% chance\nthat your personality traits\nwill change over time.\nYou can always acquire new habits\nto be the best version of yourself.\nSo did this list help shed some light\non habits that give away\nyour personality type?\nDo you know any other habits\nthat can reveal personality?\nFeel
