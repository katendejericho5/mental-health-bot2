    "transcript": "battling depression can be exhausting\nand lonely dealing with stigma and\nstereotypes can make it even harder\npeople who deal with this illness are\noften called lazy boring gloomy\nunfriendly and lots of other hurtful\nadjectives have you dealt with this\nbefore if you've had depression for a\nwhile you may have fallen into the\nbelief that you're a bad person but\nthere's a lot of psychological research\nthat has revealed results perhaps\ncontrary to that belief in today's video\nwe'd like to present some studies that\nshow depression doesn't take away the\ngood things about you we want you to\nknow that even in your darkest days you\nare a valuable\nperson number one a helping hand\nexperiencing depression can make you a\ngreat listener and a supportive friend\nbecause you've been dealing with the\npain for so long you've gotten familiar\nwith it so when somebody opens up to you\nyou'll be able to understand them you\nknow how hard life gets sometimes which\ncan make you more warm and empathetic\nwhen someone else is struggling research\nin Psychology shows that people who\nstruggle with depression May sometimes\nshow greater empathy for others a 2017\nstudy published in the journal Frontiers\nin Psychology showed that the more\ndepressed someone is the more intensely\nthey may react when seeing people in\ndistress the authors believe that seeing\nother people's pain can make them feel\npain as well this empathy can sometimes\npush you into helping others or\nvolunteering and if you decide to invest\nyour time into volunteer work you might\nfeel a lot better a 2013 study published\nin the Journal of economic psychology\nsuggests that volunteers with low levels\nof happiness may feel happier after\nhelping others so it may just be a\nwin-win situation do people often come\nto you for advice and do you feel closer\nto those who also struggle understanding\ntheir struggles might connect you on a\ndeeper level number two no rosec Colored\nGlasses do you consider yourself a\npessimist or maybe you think you're just\nbeing realistic psychologists Lauren\nalloy and Lynn Ivon Abramson came up\nwith an interesting hypothesis called\ndepression realism they think that a\ndepressive mood can make your thoughts\nabout the world and yourself more\naccurate and realistic it could be due\nto the idea that you aren't looking at\nlife through rose-colored glasses so\nyou're more likely to see both the\npositive and negative side of a\nsituation the theory of depression\nrealism is still being researched but\nsome newer studies show that depressed\nindividuals do have more realistic views\nfor example a 2011 study published in\nthe Journal of abnormal psychology\nshowed that depressed people tend to\nmake better more rational choices\nanother study published in the journal\npsychological science suggests that\ndepression makes you focus on the\ndetails of a situation improving your\nanalytical thinking skills do you think\nit's possible that these results happen\nbecause of depression realism number\nthree judges of character struggling\nwith a depressive mood may also help you\nread people's intentions better an\ninteresting 2008 experiment published in\nthe Journal of experimental social\npsychology showed that depression can\nmake you a greater judge of character\nhappy and sad participants were shown a\nvideotape in which a person accused of\ntheft was being interrogated they had to\ndecide if the person was guilty or\ninnocent the results showed that those\nin a sad mood detected deception much\nbetter than happy participants they were\nalso better at recognizing fake facial\nexpressions when the thief tried to lie\ntheir way out the authors of the study\nbelieve that this happens because sad\npeople hold negative experiences in\ntheir memory so it's easier for them to\naccess them when they need to make a\nsocial judgment you may not be invited\nto participate in a jury but judging\nothers intentions is still important in\neveryday life you might be able to avoid\nmanipulative people fake friends or\nLiars would you say you're able to\nrecognize when someone is lying to you\nalso are you more careful when starting\nan interaction with strangers and number\nfour creative Spirit do you sometimes\nturn to Art when you're depressed\nfeeling such Deep Emotions even if it's\nsadness can Unleash Your creative Spirit\nthat's when pieces of touching and\nbeautiful art can be born out of\ndepression writing poetry singing or\ndrawing may help you deal with your\nemotions that's probably why so many\ngreat artists suffered from depression\nas well a 2010 study published in the\nJournal of effective disorders analyzed\nthe writings of the German writer and\npoet Johan Wolf Gang Von G the authors\nof the study concluded that if G visited\na therapist in today's society the\nelements of his writing wouldn't be\nconsidered just a poet's Melancholy they\nsaid the way he wrote Would in modern\nterms match a lighter constitutional\nbipolar mood disorder and that his dymic\nmoods which were described frequently\nthroughout his life were strong motives\nto work creatively what do you think\nhave you noticed depressed people to be\nhighly creative do you think they see\nthe world differently than others we'd\nlike to spark a discussion so let us\nknow your thoughts in the comments in\nthe end we need to answer a few\nquestions does this mean you have to\nsuffer from depression to have these\nqualities will you somehow change after\nyou recover not at all what makes us\ngood bad isn't determined by our mental\ncondition and it's not depression in\nitself that automatically makes you\neither good or bad the choices you make\nand the skills you develop to cope are\nwhat counts and once you recover\ncompletely you'll see that you're still\nthe same person only much happier you'll\nknow that depression never impacted your\nworth"
