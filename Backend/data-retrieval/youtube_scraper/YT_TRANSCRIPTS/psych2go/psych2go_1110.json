    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Do you ever think\nthat the way people see you\nis different from the\nway you see yourself?\nHave you ever wondered whether\nor not you were attractive?\nIf you're watching this video,\nthe answer is probably yes.\nAnd, hey, it's not always a bad thing\nto wonder about how other people see us.\nMaybe they see something good in us\nthat we don't yet see in ourselves.\nSo if you've ever wanted to know\nwhether you might actually\nbe more attractive\nthan you realize,\nhere are seven subtle\nbut psychologically backed ways to tell.\nNumber one. People pay attention to you.\nDo you ever feel self-conscious\nbecause people always seem to\nbe paying attention to you?\nHave you ever introduced\nyourself to someone\nonly for them to say,\n\"Oh, I know who you are,\"\nor be surprised that they\nremembered something about you\nthat you just casually mentioned before?\nIf the answer is yes,\nthen it means people pay attention to you.\nWhen psychology says the\nmore attractive a person is,\nthe more attention other\npeople tend to give them,\nwhich brings us to our next point.\nNumber two. People tend to stare at you.\nMaybe you're not the\ntalkative or outgoing type,\nwhich makes it harder to tell\nhow attractive other people find you\nbecause you don't really\ninteract with them that much.\nStill, you can get a pretty good idea\njust from reading their body language\nand picking up on their non-verbal cues,\nespecially eye contact.\nDo people often stare at you,\nor look you up and down\nwhenever they see you,\nor subtly try to catch your gaze?\nDo you turn heads every\ntime you walk into a room\nor look at someone only for\nthem to look away embarrassed\nat having been caught staring at you?\nDon't let it make you self conscious.\nYou're probably just more\nattractive than you think.\nNumber three. People\nwant to be around you.\nSimilar to the last point,\nif people find you attractive\nbut have little opportunity to act on it,\nthey might resort to what we\ncall hovering or benching.\nBecause even if they can't talk to you,\nthey still wanna be around you.\nSo they might just purposefully\ngo to parties or events\nthey know you'll be at,\nstalk you on social media,\nor hang around places you tend to frequent\nall for the chance of having\neven the most casual interaction with you.\nNumber four.\nPeople come to you for styling,\nbeauty, or dating tips.\nAnother subtle sign\nthat you're more attractive than you think\nis that people will often come to you\nfor advice on things like\nstyling, beauty, or dating.\nWhy? Because it means that\nthey wanna be more like you.\nAnd that in itself is\nalready such a compliment.\nThey probably think you\nlook good, have great style,\nor have no trouble\nfinding romantic prospects\nand they wanna know how you do it,\nindicating that they find you attractive.\nNumber five. People are\ncomfortable around you.\nPsychology tells us that it's only natural\nto gravitate more towards\nbetter looking people.\nAfter all, it's called\nattraction for a reason.\nSo if people usually seem\nmore comfortable around you,\nif they like joking around\nand making you laugh\nor tend to be physically\naffectionate towards you\neven if you're not that close,\nthen it's probably because\nthey find you attractive\nand are subconsciously trying to tell you.\nNumber six. Strangers\nare often nice to you.\nWhen strangers do something nice for us,\nwe tend to ask ourselves,\n\"Are they flirting or just being kind?\"\nBut the answer doesn't always\nhave to be one or the other\nbecause both could be true.\nSo if strangers tend to\nact warmly towards you,\nsmiling at you, and trying\nto strike up a conversation,\nor doing small favors, like\nletting you in front of them,\nor helping you carry your things,\nthere is a good chance it's because\nthey secretly find you attractive.\nAnd number seven. Some\npeople try to tear you down.\nIf people often try to tear\nyou down for no good reason,\neither by talking about\nyou behind your back,\ntrying to belittle you, or\nspreading false rumors about you,\nit might be because\nthey find you attractive\nor know that most people do\nand it makes them feel threatened.\nJealousy, as they say, is\nthe highest form of flattery.\nSo don't be too surprised\nif some people try to tear\nyou and your self esteem down,\neven when unprovoked.\nTake it as a sign that deep down inside\nthey actually admire you\nand wanna be more like you.\nSo do you relate to any of the\nthings we've mentioned here?\nEven if you don't, that doesn't\nmean you're not attractive.\nThey say that beauty is\nin the eye of the beholder\nand there's a lot of truth to this,\nbut what matters most\nis how you see and feel about yourself.\nSo open your eyes to\nall the wonderful things\nthat make you you and love\nyourself all the more for it.\nDo you think we missed anything?\nMention it in the comments.\nIf you found some insight\nor new ideas in this video,\nmake sure to leave a like\nand share it with a friend.\nAs usual, all the sources\nare in the description.\nThanks so much for watching.\nUntil next time, beautiful."
