    "transcript": "hey psych2goers\nmeasurements of intelligence come in\nmany different forms but the two you\nprobably hear the most about iq and eq\nwhat is an eq how does it relate to your\niq\nto better understand eq and iq we'll be\ncomparing the two and sharing the signs\nthat you have a high iq but not a high\neq\nso what is iq\niq refers to your intelligence quotient\nthis is usually derived from a test that\nassesses your overall ability to process\nand relate information recognize\npatterns and access working memory among\nother factors\niq is generally thought to be influenced\nprimarily by genetics but can increase\nor decrease slightly based on certain\nfactors hate having your intelligence\nmeasured during those timed tests\nit can be pretty stressful\nbut if you're discouraged by your iq\nscore perhaps you have a higher eq score\ninstead\nso what is eq\neq refers to your emotional intelligence\nquotient\nthis refers to your ability to\nunderstand identify and control your\nemotions\nunlike iq eq is thought to be more fluid\nand can change over time\nalso unlike iq eq is not typically\ntested in the same way\nwhile typically people with high iqs\nwill also have a high eq the two work\nindependently from one another\nso what if you have a high iq but not a\nhigh eq how would you tell well here are\nsome signs\nnumber one you feel emotions intensely\nbut have difficulty controlling them\ndo you often lash out at others do you\nfeel your emotions bottled up inside of\nyou and then react strongly due to these\nintense feelings\nhigh intelligence is associated with\nintense emotionality you may find\nyourself reacting strongly to the world\naround you and have extra perceptiveness\nto your situation while there are many\nbenefits to this including having a\nstrong sense for activism appreciation\nfor beauty and deep empathy for others\nit also comes with a number of downsides\nif you have a low eq you may find it\nharder to cope with the darker side of\nhaving intense emotions\nemotions can overwhelm you and you may\nhave difficulties managing them which\ncan lead to you lashing out at others\nturning to substances or finding some\nother unhealthy way to cope with your\nsituation\nnumber two you're a high achiever and a\nperfectionist\ndo you hope to accomplish great things\nare you a perfectionist\nhighly intelligent people often achieve\na lot and with ease especially if you\nare in an environment that allows you to\ngrow\nwhile high achievement is not\nnecessarily a requirement for all highly\nintelligent people they often find that\ntheir gifts and unique abilities can\ndrive them to do great things\nhowever if you have a low eq you may\nfind yourself getting caught up in the\nsmall details as a perfectionist\ncan slow your productivity stress you\nout and make you difficult to work with\nworking to ease this tendency can make\nprojects flow more peacefully quickly\nand collaboratively\nnumber three\nyou struggle with relationships\nwhat do your relationships look like\npeople with high iqs often report\ndifficulties in their relationships you\nmay find yourself feeling misunderstood\noverlooked and having a hard time\nrelating to others\neq can play a factor in this as well\npeople with low eq's tend to have\nsimilar issues and may find themselves\nfurther struggling with empathy keeping\na two-way conversation and maintaining a\nconnection to others\nnumber four\nyou procrastinate\ndo you procrastinate procrastination is\ngenerally associated with having a high\niq\nnot necessarily out of laziness but as a\nway to take the time to consider ideas\nbefore jumping in additionally having a\nhigher iq can mean the riskiness of\nputting something off is less than what\nsomeone else may struggle with however\nprocrastination is also associated with\nhaving a lower eq\nthis can be attributed to the added\nstress in delaying an important task\nwhich can be counterproductive in some\ncircumstances\nnumber five\nyou work hard but neglect self-care\nhighly intelligent people tend to care a\nlot about the projects they're working\non and can tirelessly pursue them\nhowever with a low eq you may find that\nproducing a solid product can come at\nthe expense of your physical and\nemotional well-being you may work late\ninto the night on an assignment while\nskipping meals and sacrificing sleep\nfinding ways to balance your hard work\nand self-preservation will be beneficial\nto you and your projects\nso it's best to work on that assignment\nnow with a snack rather than later\nunless it's already way past your\nscheduled bedtime\nnumber six you're impulsive\ndid you know that there is a correlation\nbetween impulsivity and a high iq\nthe same can be said about having a low\neq though while people with a high iq\ncan be incredibly methodical at the same\ntime they may find themselves jumping\ninto situations and winging it this type\nof risky impulsive behavior can come\nwith a plethora of consequences that\nseem counterproductive\nhaving a low eq can also contribute to\nsimilar behaviors while generally those\nwith high iqs may find improvising easy\nas they can easily navigate problems\nthat arise having a low eq as well can\nlead to even riskier impulsive behaviors\nwith increased emotional intensity\nhaving a low eq in this area can lead to\nrisk taking behaviors involving\nsubstances\nand jumping head headfirst into\nsituations without thinking about\npotential consequences so do you think\nyou have a low eq\nhigh iq\nare those timed parts on the iq test so\nstressful that you can't seem to think\nor answer correctly\nfeel free to share your thoughts in the\ncomments down below hi iq or not at\nleast we can work on your eq too\ni'm guessing those tests aren't as\ncommon some do exist though\nand some are not timed do remember that\nwhile generally having a high iq is\nassociated with a high eq this is not\nalways the case being in tune with your\nemotional state is extremely important\nfor your well-being and finding ways to\nbe more mindful and self-caring can be a\ngreat way to unleash even more of your\npotential\nwe hope you were able to find this video\ninsightful and we encourage you to share\nyour thoughts in the comments below\nif
