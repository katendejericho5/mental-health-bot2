    "transcript": "have you heard of a dark empath a dark\nempath is someone who understands the\nthoughts and feelings of others like an\nempath but then uses it to get what they\nwant from others this can be through\nmanipulation deception or even\nhumiliation\nbut what happens when one dark empath\nconnects with someone just like them\nlet's take a look number one it feels\nlike a never-ending game of 20 questions\ndark empaths use what they know about\nyou to get what they want out of your\nrelationship or friendship so the\nneutral first step to get this\ninformation is to ask questions about\nyour likes and dislikes hobbies etc dark\nempaths give a surgical almost razor\nprecision focus on another person to\nunderstand what makes them tick\nthey gather all of this intel and file\nit away for when it can benefit them\nbut when it comes to having two dark\nempaths meet it's likely that they'll\ncontinually ask each other questions but\nbe very safeguarded by what information\nthey reveal to the other they don't want\nto make themselves vulnerable but they\ndo want the upper hand\nnumber two they begin playing the tit\nfor tat game\ndark empaths often need to be at the\ncenter of attention this can mean\npointing out every little thing you do\nwrong never ever wanting to be left out\nand bringing people down to their level\nwhen not paid attention to\nit's self-importance mixed with a lack\nof regard for your feelings so when a\ndark empath finds themselves in a\nsituation where it's clear that it's not\nabout them they may purposefully act out\nand cause chaos and if there's another\ndark empath in the situation they will\nmost likely retaliate and escalate this\ntit-for-tat game until someone gives up\nnumber three\nbring on the pity party\ndo you always hear them saying bad\nthings about themselves out loud perhaps\nyou overhear them saying that they're\njust not good enough or aren't smart\nenough\nsometimes dark empaths can be overly\ncritical of themselves this can be part\nof a manipulation tactic or a way to\nmake you feel bad so you'll go out of\nyour way to cheer them up but add a\nsecond dark empath and now you have the\npity olympics\nnumber four one upping\na common way a dark empath tries to\nmanipulate others is by one-upping them\nthis is when someone has to beat or up\nwhatever you set by taking it another\nnotch to seem cooler more favorable and\nlikeable for example your friend calls\nyou and says that they're getting a\nraise at work instead of congratulating\nthem a dark empath might say oh they\ntold me i was getting mine a week ago i\nguess you were last to get yours this\nperson just made themselves seem more\nimportant and better off because they\ngot the raise first whether it was true\nor not and number five things may not\nend on a positive note\nthere's not a lot of positivity when it\ncomes to dark empaths since they tend to\njust talk about themselves and what they\nwant and so when you have two dark\nempaths interacting you're doubling all\nthat toxic behavior which will likely\nresult in causing others to feel stupid\nangry or small\nafter all a dark empath is part\nnarcissist\nremember the distinction is that the\nnarcissist does this to be number one\nand won't think of anyone else the dark\nempath however wants to be number one\nbut will calculate how they're able to\nstep on others in order to do so\ndid anything shock you let us know in\nthe comments below if you found this\nvideo helpful be sure to like subscribe\nand share this video with those who\nmight benefit from it and don't forget\nto hit the notification bell icon to get\nnotified whenever psychtico posts a new\nvideo the references and studies used in\nthis video are added in the description\nbelow thanks so much for watching and\nsee you in the next one"
