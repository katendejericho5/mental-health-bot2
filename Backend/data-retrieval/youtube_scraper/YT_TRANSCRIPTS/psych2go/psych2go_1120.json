    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Is there anyone\nin your life you've known\nfor a long time now?\nPerhaps a good friend, a close sibling\nor maybe even a long-term\nromantic partner?\nIn the sea of people who\ncome and go in our lives,\nwe have to admit that we can't help\nbut long for a special someone\nwho will finally stay in our lives,\nbe it in a romantic or platonic way.\nSo how do you know if you've found someone\nwho will be in your life forever?\nTo find out, here are eight\nthings you should look out for.\nNumber one, you feel\na near-instant feeling\nof familiarity with them.\nDo you feel drawn to them for some reason?\nWhether it's platonic or romantic,\nwhen you meet the right person,\nthe connection you make with them\ncan be felt almost instantaneously.\nYou may feel closer to them\nthan with anyone else you've met.\nAnd though you may not be\nable to put it into words,\nthere's just something about them\nthat feels familiar\nand comfortable to you.\nNumber two, you know how to\nbalance your relationship\nwith other aspects of your life.\nWhen you're in the fun\nexciting honeymoon phase\nof a friendship or a relationship,\nyou may find yourself wanting\nto spend all your time with them.\nBut what about afterwards?\nWhen you found your forever person,\nyou'll still love spending time with them\nno matter how long you've\nknown each other already.\nAnd you'll even encourage one another\nto have just as thriving\nof a separate life\noutside of your relationship too.\nSo while your relationship\nwith them is important,\nyou also know how to balance it\nwith the other important\naspects of your life,\nsuch as your family,\ncareer, passions and so on.\nNumber three, you're comfortable\nbeing vulnerable around them.\nIs it easy for them to open up to them?\nAccording to some of the\nmost well-known studies\non the psychology of\nlove and family therapy,\nemotional intimacy is one of\nthe most important hallmarks\nof a healthy, flourishing,\nand lasting relationship.\nSo if you've found your forever person,\nthen you're sure to know by the way\nyou're so much more comfortable\nbeing vulnerable with them\nthan you are around almost anyone else.\nAfter all, open communication\nabout your feelings plays a crucial role\nin sustaining long-term\nsocial relationships\nand facilitating feelings\nof love and closeness\nin one another.\nNumber four, you only have to think\nabout what you want to say,\nnot how you need to say it.\nAnother sure-fire sign\nthat you've found a keeper\nis if most of the time,\nyou only have to think about\nwhat you wanna say to them\nand not much about how to say it.\nThere's no walking on\neggshells around one another,\nputting up walls or fears\nof being misunderstood,\nall of which indicate open communication,\nwhich as you know by\nnow is a key ingredient\nto any lasting relationship.\nNumber five, you both fight fair.\nNow, you might be thinking\nthat finding someone who will\nbe in your life forever means\nthat you never have to worry\nabout getting into a fight with them.\nBut that's a common misconception,\nand a potentially harmful one at that.\nAfter all, it's only normal\nto have conflicts from time to time.\nBut what really makes\nor breaks a relationship\nisn't the arguments themselves\nbut rather how you handle them.\nIf you find that you are\nboth able to fight fair,\nthat is no name calling, no blaming,\nno attacking each other's weaknesses,\nwhere you still know how\nto respect one another\neven when you can't agree,\nthen you've definitely found a good one\nyou shouldn't let go of.\nNumber six, they don't expect\nyou to change overnight.\nEveryone struggles with their flaws\nand personal shortcomings\nbut when you find the right person,\nthey'll inspire you to become\na better version of yourself\nwithout expecting you to change overnight.\nThey accept you just the\nway you are, flaws and all.\nAnd so will be patient and supportive\nof who you are instead of judging\nor criticizing you for it.\nEven in times where\nyou're faced with an issue\nand are struggling to improve,\nthey understand that\nit's not easy to change\nand will be there to\nhelp you work through it.\nNumber seven, they never\nlet you give up on yourself.\nDo they reach out to you\nwhen they see you struggling?\nWhile they won't pressure you into doing\nwhat they think is right for you,\nthat doesn't mean that\nthey'll just stand idly by\nwhen they think that you're\nhurting or struggling\non your own.\nYour forever person is one\nof your greatest cheerleaders\nand supporters, and they believe in you,\neven when you find it hard\nto believe in yourself.\nEvery time you wanna give up\non something you really want,\nor make the same old wrong\nchoices you're always making,\nthey're there to tell you\nthat they're better than that,\nand that you deserve so much more.\nAnd number eight, being with them\nis an easy choice to make.\nLast, but not certainly not least,\nyou'll now you've found\nsomeone who is going\nto be in your life forever\nif being with them is just\nan easy choice to make,\neven when things aren't smooth sailing.\nIt's still one of the\nsimplest and surest choices\nyou've ever made and continue to make\nto keep them around.\nYou know that what the two of you share\nis so precious and hard to come by\nthat you would never wanna throw it away.\nSo no matter what lies ahead,\nyou feel a lot better in\njust knowing you'll have them\nby your side.\nDid you relate to any of\nthe signs we
