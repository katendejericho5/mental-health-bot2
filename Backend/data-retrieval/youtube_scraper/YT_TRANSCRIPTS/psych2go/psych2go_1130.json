    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Ooh, it's\nthose four little letters,\nthat by now you've\nprobably seen, encountered\nor tested for the Myers\nBriggs Type Indicator or MBTI.\nYou may simply know it\nas that personality test.\nIf your results said you're an INFJ,\nthat stands for introverted,\nintuitive, feeling and judging.\nThe title's given to INFJs\nare advocate or idealist.\nIt's also the rarest\npersonality type accounting\nfor only one to three\npercent of the population\nbased on the USA.\nAfter getting a result like this,\nwe can often wonder if it's true.\nHere are a few key factors\nthat can indicate your true INFJness.\nBefore we dive in, just wanted to mention\nthat there has been a huge decline\nin mental health around the world,\nwhich is why we're so committed\nto creating more content\nthan we ever have.\nStay tuned and thanks for\nbeing a part of our journey.\nNow let's begin.\nNumber one, you tend to take\nan all or nothing approach to life.\nGo hard or go home, am I right?\nThis phrase seems to have\nbeen created for the INFJ.\nThey really get into things,\nreally diving passionately\ninto achieving those big dreams they have\nand always valuing quality over quantity.\nThey aren't satisfied with\nthe superficial or casual.\nThey seek deeper truths and authenticity.\nThis zero to a hundred approach\ndoes unfortunately make\nthem prone to burnout,\nso they need to carefully balance\nthat drive with self care.\nNumber two, everyone tends\nto gravitate towards you.\nIn the strive for a deeper connection\nand dissatisfaction with the superficial,\nINFJs tend to draw in\nthose that want to open up.\nThere isn't a specific action or a sign,\nbut they somehow give\noff the vibe to others\nthat they are open to hearing\nother's deepest worries,\ndreams, and thoughts.\nBeing excellent listeners with\nthe ability to communicate\nin an easy to understand\nmanner doesn't hurt either.\nIronically, they themselves\nare somewhat private people.\nSo they'll often act as\nthe receiver of information\nrather than the giver while\nwarming up to the other person.\nNumber three, you have a\nnatural talent for language.\nAlone time is creative\ntime for these types.\nThat I in INFJ does stand\nfor introverted after all.\nThey find their alone time\nenriching and entertaining\nas they usually have a variety of hobbies.\nAs speaking to others\nabout their own feelings\ncan be difficult, they often\nchannel it through writing.\nTrue to form, a large number\nof legendary writers are INFJs\nlike Goethe, Dostoevsky\nand Agatha Christie.\nNumber four, you make decisions\nbased on your intuition.\nRather than clinically\ncalculating probabilities\nbased on past performance\nor track records,\nthe INFJ critiques their environment\nand scores it based on\nhow they feel directly.\nThey fly with their gut feeling,\nbut since they seek the core of any issue\nto understand it anyhow, their\ngut feeling is rarely wrong.\nNumber five, you absolutely\ndespise interpersonal conflict.\nThis has to do with the INFJ's\naltruism and insightfulness.\nWhile some enjoy some body prowling\nor find excitement in arguing,\nall the INFJ feels is upsetting\nturbulence and instability.\nThey find it easy to pick up\non people's true motivations\nand feelings and that makes the discord\neven more disturbing for them.\nThey take responsibility for it\nin trying to make sense of the argument\nlong after the immediate conflict is over\nto ensure that those they\ncare about aren't hurt.\nNumber six, you are concerned\nabout what others think of you.\nWhere do you spend your time and emotion?\nINFJs have significant\npersonal investments\nin getting to know\npeople on a deeper level.\nThey wanna make the world a better place\nand that includes those around them.\nThey want people to be\nbetter for having known them,\nso they are quite\nsensitive if they believe\nthey've not met someone's expectations.\nIt feels like a failure on their part\nto not make things better overall.\nAnd number seven, you have\nprinciples etched in stone.\nThese personality types\naren't about to waffle around\nin their beliefs and values.\nThey have standards, they have ethics.\nIf someone's trying to pull them\ninto a prison break or a bank heist,\nsome major spin doctoring\nwill have to ensue\nbecause the simple bring\nisn't going to cut it.\nThey are the ones who would argue\nwith Darth Helmet that good is not dumb\nand would go against the corrupted leader\neven if the majority is falling in line.\nThe INFJ will see themselves\ndeep within the core\nof a person or a situation,\nensuring that everything\nthey do is meaningful\nand adds to their sense\nof purpose in life.\nDespite being an introvert,\nthey'll passionately crusade\nto uphold their ethics and beliefs\nno matter the opposing\nforce, so watch out.\nThe INFJ may be rare, but\nthey sure do leave an impact.\nHow do you feel about these traits?\nWhat do you recognize, if anything?\nPlease discuss, but keep it civil\nbecause an INFJ might wish to join in.\nThanks for watching and see you soon."
