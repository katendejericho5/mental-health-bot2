    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Have you ever\nwondered how other people\nperceive you and their\nfirst impression of you?\nHere's what people think\nof you based on your MBTI.\nOne, the ENFP.\nDo people always say you\nare the life of the party?\nWhen you are an ENFP, people perceive you\nto be a free spirited\nindividual who never rests.\nOthers are attracted to\nyou by your open-minded,\napproachable and friendly\nnature wherever you go.\nBeing the campaigner MBTI,\nyou are good at understanding others.\nHowever, it's common for\nyou to start new projects\nwithout finishing them, as\nit's hard for you to focus\non one thing when the\npossibilities are endless.\nTwo, ENTP.\nAre you the curious one?\nIf innovation is your\npassion, then you are an ENTP,\nthe debater MBTI.\nYou're someone who thrives\non the battle of wits.\nYou're viewed as charming.\nYou crave a greater understanding\nof the world around you.\nRules seem limiting to you\nas you are a true maverick.\nHowever, you tend to see\nthings from a bigger picture,\nso you may struggle to\nrecall or describe specifics.\nThree, the INFP.\nAre you always willing to lend a shoulder\nwhen others need it?\nIf you nodded yes, then\nyou are the mediator MBTI.\nPeople see INFPs as highly empathetic.\nYour deep insight makes you\nstand out from the crowd.\nINFP is seen as reserved, aloof,\nand also exhibits high idealism.\nHaving a conversation\nwith you is interesting\nsince you have a broad\nknowledge of various topics.\nFour, the INTP.\nAre you the quiet and shy one\nwaiting to hear about your MBTI?\nWell, wait, no more.\nYou're the thinker MBTI.\nINTP, you love talking\nabout abstract concepts.\nIt's not your style to\npush yourself on others,\ndelegate, or control anyone.\nPeople see you as inventive\nand having a strong intellect.\nYour unique perspectives often capture\nthe attention of others.\nFive, ENFJ.\nIf you are sensitive to others'\nthoughts and motivations\nthen you are the giver MBTI.\nThat is ENFJ.\nYou're good at bringing\nout the best in people\nby understanding beyond\nwhat is being said.\nOthers often see you as\nrespectful, friendly,\ndependable and considerate.\nHowever, being too empathetic\nmay be a problem because\nyou'll unconsciously take\non others' responsibilities.\nSix, ENTJ.\nDo you desire to get the job done\nusing the fastest possible route?\nThat would make you and\nENTJ, the commander MBTI.\nENTJs are seen as someone\nwho likes to jump in\nand take charge of things.\nENTJs are viewed as\nvisionaries who always know\nwhat needs to be done.\nOn the flip side, you can\nalso be seen as controlling\nand bossy individuals who make demands\nwithout giving others\nample time to process.\nNumber seven, the INFJ.\nAre you extremely conflict diverse\nor a perfectionist default?\nIf you are born with the inner\nsense of extreme idealism,\nthen you are the in\nINFJ, the advocate MBTI.\nThe first impression of INFJs\nis that they're reserved,\ncaring, and deeply thoughtful.\nHaving a good way with words\nhas always been your best attribute.\nIf you are an INFJ people\nperceive you as a great listener.\nYou're complex and may\nappear contradictory\nso it's hard to get to know you.\nWhen you sense that your\nvalues are not respected,\nyou often withdraw.\nEight, INTJ.\nSerious and reserved.\nThat will be the first impression\nof people for INTJs, the architect MBTI.\nYou're also seen as logical,\nintellectual, and possess deep insights.\nYou critically examine any\ninformation you receive.\nYou have an objective view of things\nand an innate ability to solve problems\nand plan for the future.\nOn the flip side, most perceive that INTJs\nappear to be completely\nabsorbed in their own world,\nwhich is not the case at all.\nNine, ESFP.\nDo you always make sure\neverybody has a good time?\nIf so, you're an ESFP, the performer MBTI.\nOften the life of the party,\nESFPs are fun-loving, spontaneous\nand talkative entertainers.\nOnlookers can sense that\nESFPs have an acute awareness\nof their senses and gravitate\ntowards pleasing sights,\nsounds, smells, and\ntextures in the environment.\nEven though ESFPs are\nusually open and friendly,\nyou tend to be unwilling to\ntake yourself too seriously\nand can be difficult to get to know.\n10, the ESTP.\nDo you have excellent people skills\non par with that of Flynn\nRyder from \"Tangled\"?\nIf you are energetic,\nfun-loving and confident,\nyou belong to the entrepreneur\nMBTI, that is ESTP.\nYou're at ease with your\nphysical environment\nand eager for action or activity.\nOthers appreciate your knack for being\nobservant of details in your environment.\nHowever, people also notice that ESTPs\ncan be too focused on the fun.\n11, the ISFP.\nIf you love the process of taking in\nall the sensations around\nyou, then you belong to\nthe artist MBTI, which is ISFP.\nInitially you may appear to\nothers as distant and aloof\nbut you will step in\nquietly and lend a hand\nat precisely the right time.\nYou are gentle, unassuming and empathetic.\nISFPs have a strong aesthetic sense\nand deeply enjoy sensory experiences.\nYou are sensitive to\ntone, texture and color.\n12, the ISTP.\nDo you have an intuitive\nunderstanding of machines\nor an astounding talent for fixing things?\nThen you may be the crafter MBTI.\nYou're just like Tinkerbell.\nYou often spend time on hands-on hobbies\nlike woodworking or crafts.\nOthers perceive ISTPs as logical,\nadaptable and efficient.\nISTPs value privacy and\nare unlikely to connect\nto new people in a typical way.\n13, the ESFJ.\nIs it common for you to play\nhost at events or activities?\nIf you usually take on the concerns\nof others as if they were your own\nyou may be the caregiver\nMBTI, that is ESFJ.\nIt's in your nature to bring\norder to other people's lives\nand ensure that their needs are met.\nFamilies and traditions hold\ngreat importance to you.\nYou are a fan of rituals\ncommemorating favorite experiences,\nsuch as annual trips.\nHowever, people can also perceive ESFJs\nas extremely sensitive.\n14, ESTJ.\nDo you have a knack for handling\nprojects systematically?\nThen you are probably an\nESTJ, the director MBTI.\nESTJs highly value\nobligations and commitments.\nOnlookers may see you\nas someone who seriously\ntakes on evidence over conjecture.\nYou don't mind leading people\nto achieve shared goals.\nOn the flip side, individuals\nwith this personality type\ncan be reluctant to try new things.\n15, the ISFJ.\nIf you go above and beyond\nto meet people's needs\nat the expense of your own needs,\nyou are the protector MBTI.\nWhen interacting with new\npeople ISFJs can be reserved\nand it's uncommon for you to disclose\npersonal information quickly.\nBeing non-confrontational\nis ingrained in you\nbut you will become\ndefensive and protective\nwhen your loved ones are treated poorly.\nYou also dislike the spotlight.\nAnd 16, the ISTJ.\nIf you are an ISTJ people may see you as\nsomeone who is serious,\npragmatic and responsible.\nAs the inspector MBTI,\nyou enjoy practicing\nconsistent habits and\nan orderly lifestyle.\nIt seems as if you have a procedure\nfor everything that you do.\nThere also appears to be an\nair of calmness about you.\nYou appreciate predictability\nand use your past experiences\nas your life guidance.\nWhile we may have special characteristics\nand qualities that have\nnothing to do with MBTI,\nthere are specific criteria and features\nthat each MBTI type seems to exhibit.\nThis isn't to say you are confined within\nrigid personality boundaries\nor that you cannot share any other traits.\nThe MBTI provides a general framework\nbut does not limit your tendency to adopt\nor cultivate your own personality.\nSimilarly, others' opinions\nof you can often be\na reflection of themselves\nrather than based on objectivity.\nIt's good to take others'\nviews into consideration\nbut should not be allowed to define you.\nWe hope this video helped\nyou understand more\nabout yourself and others.\nFeel free to
