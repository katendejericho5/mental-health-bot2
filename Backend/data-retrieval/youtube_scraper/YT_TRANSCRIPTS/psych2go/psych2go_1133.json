    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you often question\nwhether someone genuinely respects you?\nNo matter how hard you try,\nnot everyone can respect\nyou, and that's okay.\nBut if you see yourself\nmaking enemies out of people\nthat you just met,\nperhaps there's a blind spot\nthat you can change for the better.\nSo with that said, let's take a look\nat six reasons why others\nmight not respect you.\nNumber one, you make everything about you.\nDo you dominate the conversation,\ntalking about everything\nyou've been doing in life\nwithout leaving the other\nperson any room to speak?\nWhile you may feel\nlike you're participating\nin meaningful conversations,\nthe other party might feel disinterested\nif they can't relate\nto what you're saying.\nThey may feel like\nthey're being talked at,\nrather than talked to.\nIf you feel that you\nconversation partner's starting\nto lose interest,\nask them their insights and\nquestions every once in a while\nto bring them back in.\nNumber two, you dismiss\nother people's ideas.\nDo you easily dismiss\nother people's ideas?\nBy doing this,\nyou many unknowingly drive\naway your acquaintances.\nA study conducted by Joanna Rajchert\nand her team showed\nthat rejection can threaten\na person's need to belong\nand further discourages\nothers to help you.\nThis means that by\nconstantly telling others\nthat they're wrong or consistently\ndismissing their ideas,\nyou may be slowly eroding\nyour relationship with them.\nInstead of criticizing their ideas,\ntry to talk in a more supportive\nand empathetic tone instead,\neven if their ideas and\nyours are different.\nHow you present yourself\ncan leave a big impression.\nNumber three, you try to control others.\nDo you try to monitor your\nsignificant other's social media?\nOr demand where someone is at all times?\nControlling behavior is one\nwhere someone tries to take charge\nof someone's life through manipulation.\nControlling behavior may\nnot be present at the start\nbut it could gradually escalate\nonce the relationship starts\nto become more intimate.\nThis can make the other party\nnot just lose their respect\nfor you but fear you as well.\nIf you exhibit controlling\nbehaviors towards others,\nit's something that should be addressed\nby both parties and a\nprofessional, like a therapist.\nNumber four, you don't\nmaintain boundaries.\nDo you let things slide way too often?\nIt can be difficult setting boundaries\nif you've never been accustomed to it.\nBut it's incredibly important\nbecause boundaries can protect\nyou mentally and emotionally.\nWhen you lack boundaries,\nyou're giving the wrong impression\nthat your identity is at\nthe will of other people.\nWith the wrong company,\nboundaries can be taken advantage of.\nTo set boundaries, you have to\ndefine and communicate them.\nThen detail the consequences\nif they don't follow.\nThis way, your relationships\ncan be healthy.\nNumber five, you apologize too often.\nDo you say sorry, even\nwhen you don't mean it?\nWhy do we over apologize\nin the first place?\nOftentimes, you may apologize\nwhen you feel uncomfortable,\ninsecure, and due to fear of\ndisappointing the other person.\nYou could also be doing it for so long\nthat it's ingrained as\na subconscious habit.\nOver apologizing signals to the other\nthat you're to blame for things\nthat aren't even your fault,\nwhich may be a sign of low self-esteem.\nIf you want people to respect you,\ntry to be careful with\nthe language you choose\nand that entails being sorry only\nwhen you think an apology is warranted,\nrather than a fallback phrase.\nAnd number six, you break promises.\nDo you say you're going\nto arrive in a few minutes\nbut haven't even left the house yet?\nOr have you told your boss, teacher\nor lecturer you'd submit an assignment\nby the deadline but failed to meat it?\nBefore contracts existed,\na verbal promise was one of\nthe oldest human behaviors\nthat showed your trust and\ncooperation with another person.\nEven if you give only a\nglimpse of that secret\nto someone else, the\nintention can already tarnish\nthe relationship you have\nwith the secret teller.\nIf you show that you're\nnot reliable enough\nto confide in, you could be showing others\nthat you're not trustworthy\nand they could disrespect you in return.\nEveryone's unique and there's no 100% way\nof pleasing everybody\nbut as long as you\npractice genuine kindness\nand empathy to yourself and others,\nyou can naturally become someone people\nwill like and respect.\nDo you do any of the things above?\nAre you planning to change?\nLet us know in the comments\nand like and share this video\nwith someone who may benefit.\nAs always, the references\nand studies are listed\nin the description.\nThanks for watching and see you next time."
