    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nIf you haven't heard\nthere is a huge trial right now\nbetween Johnny Depp and\nhis ex-wife Amber Heard.\nTo sum it up\nDepp is suing Heard for\ndefamation of his character\nstemming from an article\nin the Washington Post\nwritten by Heard\nwhere Heard makes claims\nthat she is a public figure\nrepresenting domestic abuse.\nThis article and the statements therein\nwere referencing her marriage with Depp,\nbut did not directly mention his name.\nIn this trial\nwe are seeing evidence showing that Amber\nmay be responsible for the\nabuse and domestic violence\nand not as the victim as she claims.\nSince the Me Too movement started in 2006\nit has predominantly\nbeen run, represented,\nand tagged by females.\nWhenever domestic violence\nor abuse concerns are raised\nwe as a society usually tend\nto side with the female party.\nWe often forget that men\ncan be victims of abuse\nand domestic violence too.\nLet me say it again.\nMen can also be victims of\nabuse and domestic violence.\n(soft music)\nSo with that said\nlet's look at four common\nmisconceptions about male victims\nof any type of abuse or domestic violence.\nMyth number one,\nthe statistics show that\nthere are more female victims\nof abuse and domestic violence\nthan male victims.\nAccording to a 2011\nstudy, researchers found\nthat the number of reported\ndomestic violence cases\nthat represented male victims\nmade up roughly 11.5%.\nNotice the key word, \"reported\".\nThey also found two common reasons\nfor abuse going unreported\nand why the number is so low.\nOne is due to men wanting to hide the fact\nthat this is happening.\nThis may be due to the shame\nof admitting it's happening\nor, more commonly, they may be\nafraid of receiving backlash.\nAnother reason men may not\nreport these occurrences\nmay be due to the feeling\nthat the injury or damage\nwasn't enough to warrant a report.\nAnother study from 2012\nfound that some men\ndidn't report their abuse\nbecause they believed the police\nwouldn't take them seriously\nor do anything about it.\nBut just because the\nincident goes unreported\ndoesn't mean it didn't happen.\nIt's important to know the signs of abuse\nespecially when so many\ncases are going unreported.\nCheck out Psych2Go's videos\nsuch as \"10 Red Flags of Abuse\".\nMyth number two,\nyou're not a \"real man\"\nif you can't take it.\nLet's be very very clear.\nNo one, regardless of gender,\nshould have to be able to take abuse.\nNo one is deserving of abuse\nor disrespect of any kind.\nWhen someone experiences an abusive event\nthe emotions that arise\nrange from shame to fear,\nto sadness, to anger, and\nevery emotion in-between.\nThese are human emotions,\nnot only male identifying\nor only female identifying emotions.\nWhen we as a society condemn\nthese emotions in men\nwhy would men wanna come forward\nto reveal that they're\nhaving these feelings\nor experiencing abusive events?\nMyth number three,\nshe didn't come at you for no reason.\nFirst, this statement makes the man\nthe victim of domestic violence,\nthe one at fault when wrong\nis being done to them.\nIt suggests that whatever he did\nmade the other person hit them.\nHe can't be a victim\nif he's the reason it\nhappened in the first place.\nSecondly, this stereotype insinuates\nthat if someone does something bad enough\nit's justified to respond\nwith physical abuse.\nJust like we tell kindergartners\nwe keep our hands to ourselves\nunless there's consent.\nViolence should never be\nanyone's response in a conflict.\nAnd myth number four,\nit's not abuse if she\ndoesn't leave a mark on you.\nWe left the most appalling for last.\nThere are some individuals\nthat believe all abuse\ninvolves some type of physical act.\nSome will even go a step further\nto state that a physical act is all right\nas long as a mark, bruise,\ncut, or wound isn't left.\nThis is\nsimply wrong.\nAbuse can take many forms\nand can be physical,\nsexual,\nemotional,\nverbal,\nor mental.\nYes, it can be a slap\nor throwing a glass bottle at someone.\nIt can also be gaslighting them,\nsaying things happened when they didn't\nto make them doubt themselves.\nIt can be saying derogatory\nthings to your partner\nto lower their self-esteem.\nAbuse may not leave a\nmark that can be seen\nbut it will always leave a mark\non the person's mind and heart.\nAbuse and domestic violence\ndon't apply to one gender or party.\nIf you or a loved one\nthink you are in an abusive relationship,\ntell someone.\nAsk for help.\nOr reach out to a trusted\nmental health professional.\nThere are people who will believe you\nand who are there to listen.\nPlease share this important\nvideo with others.\nThe references and studies used\nare listed in the description below.\nUntil next time friends,\ntake care, stay safe,\nand thanks for watching."
