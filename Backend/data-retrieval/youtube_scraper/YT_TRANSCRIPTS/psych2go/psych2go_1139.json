    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\n(smooth music)\nAre you having a difficult time\ntelling if someone genuinely likes you\nor if they're faking their friendliness?\nSomething may just seem\noff and you have a hunch\nthat they don't have your\nbest interests at heart.\nHow do you know that they actually\ncare about you and like you?\nHow do you know if they're\ninauthentic with you?\nWell, here are a few tips to help you out.\nHere are five signs that can help reveal\nif someone genuinely likes you.\nNumber one, they cancel plans\nversus they often hang out with you.\nDoes your new friend\ncancel plans right before\nyou're headed out the door to meet them?\nDo they do this often?\nPeople who don't genuinely\nlike you often don't care\nif they cancel at the last minute\nbecause they may often not\ncare about your feelings\nor about keeping their promises.\nNow, if you have a\nfriend who is often there\nfor you and loves to follow\nthrough with their promises\nand spend time with\nyou, then that's a sign\nthat they do actually like you.\nNumber two, they bring you down\nversus they cheer you up and support you.\nDoes your friend bring you\ndown, subtly criticize you?\nThis is a common sign they\ndon't care much about you.\nWhy else would they be\ntrying to tear you down?\nFriends wanna cheer each other\nup and support each other.\nGood friends are often\neach other's biggest fans.\nSo does your friend cheer\nyou up or tear you down?\nNumber three, they seek attention and brag\nversus they're humble and themselves.\nDoes your friend often\noverly seek out attention\nand brag to you or are they often humble\nand authentically themselves?\nAn authentic friend\noften won't feel the need\nto make themselves seem better than you.\nThey just wanna be themselves around you\nand have a good time.\nGood friends don't judge\neach other harshly.\nSo an authentic friend may feel\nas if they can be vulnerable\nand open with you, true to themselves.\nAuthenticity often brings\npositive attention anyway.\nNumber four, they're judgmental\nversus they're open-minded.\nHave you noticed that your\nfriend is very judgemental\nover any action you do\nor are they open-minded and listen to you\nbefore jumping quickly to\nharsh negative conclusions?\nPsychologist Guy Winch, PhD, explained\nin their Psychology Today article that,\n\"Being honest about their own faults\nand embracing individuality\nand differences\nleads genuine people to be less judgmental\nand more accepting of\nthe people around them.\"\nHmm, it seems like genuine\nfriends won't feel the need\nto judge you harshly.\nAnd instead keep an open mind,\nespecially if they like someone\nand wanna hear them out.\nAnd number five, they're\npassive aggressive\nversus they're communicative,\ndirect and honest.\nDo you know someone who is\nconstantly passive aggressive\nor are they communicating well with you\nby being honest and direct\ninstead of sneaky and untruthful?\nKate Balestrieri, a psychologist,\ntold Bustle in an article\nthat, \"When people speak directly,\nthey're less invested\nin impression management\nor passive aggressive behavior,\nboth of which ultimately\nlead to inauthentic\ninteractions with others.\"\nSo do you know someone who\nis often passive aggressive?\nThey could be hiding their real feelings\nabout you under the disguise\nof inauthentic kindness.\nThey may not wanna flat out tell you\nthat they don't like you.\nSo, instead, passive aggressiveness\nis the best they can do.\nWho needs a friend like that?\nSo look out for the communicative friends\nwho are truthful, kind and respectful.\nThey're the ones who like you.\nSo did you notice any of\nthese signs?
