    "transcript": "if you've ever been in a relationship\nthat's just not working out and bringing\nyou down you may have asked yourself is\nit really just incompatibility or is\nthere a deeper more serious problem here\nafter all although abuse and\nincompatibility are two distinct\nConcepts in relationships they can\nsometimes overlap or coexist covert or\nsilent abuse refers to a form of\nmistreatment that is subtle but damaging\nand unfortunately it often goes\nunnoticed because it may not leave any\nobvious sign\nmore psychological and emotional in\nnature it involves tactics of\nmanipulation control and abasement that\nerode a person's self-esteem and sense\nof well-being with that said here are\nfive crucial differences that can help\nyou identify if you're experiencing\nsilent abuse rather than mere\nincompatibility in a\nrelationship nature of the behavior when\nsomeone is covertly abusing you they\nwill use tactics of psychological and\nemotional manipulation to gain power and\ncontrol over you and your relationship\naccording to psychologist Dr Elizabeth\nScott some examples include gaslighting\npassive aggressiveness withholding\naffection guilt tripping and undermining\nyour self-esteem incompatibility on the\nother hand is not meant to hurt or\ndemean you in any way but it's just an\nunfortunate consequence of having\ndifferent interests values needs and\ncommunication Styles this might manifest\nas frequent misunderstandings arguments\nor a general sense of the feeling\nunfulfilled by the\nrelationship intent of the behavior\nalthough sometimes people can be\nunknowingly toxic for us it can cross\nthe line and turn into abuse when these\ntoxic behaviors become a consistent\npattern and are done with malicious\nintent so psychologist Dr Deborah J\nCohen by contrast incompatibility arises\nnaturally out of the fundamental\ndifferences between people and doesn't\ninvolve a purposeful attempt to harm or\nmanipulate the other simply put in an\nabusive relationship the ab user is\naware of their actions and their impact\non their partner but while an\nincompatible relationship can be\ndraining to our emotional well-being\nit's not driven by conscious intent or\neven awareness of the harm being\ncaused emotional psychological impact\nabuse no matter how silent or covert has\na profound and Lasting emotional and\npsychological impact on its victim\naccording to therapist Angela Holt it\ncan lead to feelings of fear\nhelplessness low self-esteem anxiety\ndeppression depression attachment issues\nand other mental health concerns the\nemotional Fallout of being in an\nincompatible relationship can affect a\nperson's wellbeing too but we all\nunderstand that it's just a part of\ndating and falling in love and whether\nor not we're able to resolve these\ndifferences there is no severely\ndetrimental psychological toll to being\nincompatible with someone if you're\nfinding this video

compatibility\ninvolves open and honest communication\nactive listening and a willingness to\ncompromise couples may work on finding\ncommon ground exploring shared interests\nor seeking professional
