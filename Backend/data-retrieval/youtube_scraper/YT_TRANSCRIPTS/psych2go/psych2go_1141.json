    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hi, Psych2goers.\nHave you been feeling empty lately?\nIf you're feeling agitated or confused\nabout what this lingering emptiness is,\nit could be loneliness\nand it could mean that\nyou're experiencing it\non a deeper level than you thought.\nWe'll go through a few signs\nthat may help you understand\nif what you're feeling is deep loneliness.\nNumber one,\nthe saying is,\n\" Misery loves company, not loneliness.\"\nIt's fairly logical,\nif the equation in your\nhead goes something\nlike lonely equals one person.\nSo many people together\nequals no more loneliness.\nFollowing that,\nyou'd think that a group of lonely people\ngetting together would count.\nUnfortunately, that equation doesn't take\ninto account the nuances\nof how people work\nwhich is to say feelings spread.\nWhat's actually happening is that,\nin a group,\nthe power of loneliness\nis just getting amplified\ninstead of canceled out.\nHow this works is that,\nthe lonely behaviors don't work in a group\nwhen you're lonely or generally alone,\nyou don't need to be socially adept\nbecause you're just talking to yourself.\nYou don't need to be self-aware\nbecause the only person\nwho is observing you,\nis you.\nNow think of a room\nstuffed with all these\npeople who have no idea\nhow to get along with each other,\nsuddenly thrust together and told,\nmake nice.\nThe end result is more awkwardness,\nmore hostility, and contempt.\nSo now on top of the previous feelings,\nthe lonely people feel rejected.\nWhile it is comforting to think,\nthis person gets me\nand knows what I'm going through.\nIt may be a better choice\nto start hanging with someone\nwho may have been there\nbut isn't there currently.\nNumber two, you start golluming out.\nMy precious.\nOh, don't worry.\nYou probably won't start losing your hair\nand running around in a linen cloth.\nIf you do,\nand that makes you happy.\nNo shame in that.\nWhat this point means is that,\na sign of deep loneliness\nis when you develop strong attachments\nto inanimate objects.\nCome to think of it,\ngollum was pretty lonely.\nMaterialism doesn't\nnecessarily cause loneliness.\nHowever, loneliness has a\ntendency to produce materialism.\nThis leads to retail therapy cycles.\nAs when buying that thing makes you\nfor the briefest of moments feel good.\nSo you repeat.\nAnd instead of humans to keep you company,\nyou start hoarding.\nYou can easily see how this can add up\nto debt and diminished savings,\ncompounding any stress\nyou may have already been experiencing.\nSo next time you click\nthe purchase now button,\ntake a breather.\nAsk yourself how or\nwhy you need the thing.\nAnd maybe search out less spendy ways\nto occupy your time.\nNumber three,\nyou feel alone even when you're not alone.\nThis feeling can be very disorienting\nbecause you logically\nknow you're surrounded\nby your entire friend group\nand yet still feel\nisolated and disengaged.\nAt other times, you may\nfeel alienated and alone.\nWhen you're alone,\nyou can't talk to anyone\nbecause no one is there,\nyet when you're with your friends,\nyou still feel like you\ncan't talk to anyone.\nIt's like this loneliness\njust keeps following you around\nno matter who you're with\nor who you're not with.\nThat is super frustrating.\nAs always, when you've done your best\nand you're still finding yourself\nwithout a plan or any solutions,\nreach out to someone you trust\nor even directly to a professional.\nThere could be underlying issues\nor something others have\nobserved that you haven't.\nNumber four,\nyou tend to overshare\nwhen someone is there to listen.\nWhoa, TMI.\nDo you hear that often?\nHave you stepped back and realized,\nwow, I met you literally five minutes ago\nand I'm suddenly telling you\nabout my childhood traumas.\nThis response could be a desperate attempt\nto use it or lose it,\nand points to deep loneliness.\nThink of the starving individual\nwho is finally allowed\nto sneak into the kitchen\nor being super thirsty after hiking\nthrough a desert and coming upon an oasis.\nWhen you get the resource that is missing,\nyou try to seize it\nand use it as much as possible.\nAfter all you think,\nyou never know when it'll be back again.\nSo when there's finally someone there\nwho is willing to listen\nand you've been without\na kind compassionate ear\nfor so long,\nyou gotta share.\nPeople who experience deep\nloneliness may be worried\nthat once this person leaves,\nthere may not be another chance to open up\nand connect with someone again.\nNumber five, you are gollum,\nyour friends are the one ring.\nThis ties in directly\nto the previous point.\nThis time though,\nfriends are the resource\nand the lonely person's\nresponse is to hoard\nand imprison them through obsession.\nThe source could be fear\nof losing all the friends\nor the person having low confidence\nin themselves to make new ones.\nEither way the behavior is based on,\nI have it and I'm keeping it forever.\nThis is not good and this will backfire.\nFriends are people,\npeople with their own thoughts and wants,\nand they will leave.\nBecause being hoarded and obsessed over\ndoes not mean good times.\nUnfortunately, if the only\nperson doesn't realize\nthey're performing this\nkind of lonely behavior,\nthey may simply see it as rejection,\ngrow more cynical and unpleasant.\nThus making it more difficult\nto create new friendships.\nSo you're not making it up in your head.\nIf that weird feeling is there,\ndon't ignore it.\nLoneliness can happen even\nwhen all the outside factors\nseem to be in place to combat it.\nDid you recognize any\nof these points made?\nAre you seeing any of these behaviors\nshowing up in someone you know,\nwho isn't like that normally.\nWe're all in this together truly.\nAnd if you need to reach out,\nwe encourage you to do so.\nThanks for watching and see you next time."
