    "transcript": "(calm music)\n- Do you notice\nhow easy it is to spiral into\nincreasingly more negative\nand pessimistic ways of thinking\nwhen you're feeling down?\nIf you are someone who's ever seen\nor ever been in the throes of depression,\nthen you'll know this\nvicious cycle all too well,\nand understand just how\nhard it can be to break.\nYour negative thoughts\nand feelings can spiral\nand reinforce negative ideas of yourself\nthat are just not true.\nIn these moments, it's important\nto try to remind yourself\nhow depression can cloud\nyour perception and judgment.\nTo learn more about\nthis, here our seven lies\nyour depression might be telling you\nthat you should never believe.\nNumber one, nobody cares about me.\nOne of the worst things depression can do\nis make you feel unloved and unwanted,\neven by your closest family and friends.\nIt can cause you to feel\nso terrible about yourself\nthat you become blind\nto the genuine warmth,\ncare, and kindness of other people.\nAnd while therapists will always stress\nthe need for those\nstruggling with depression\nto surround themselves\nwith a good support system,\ndepression can compulsively\nmake you isolate yourself.\nAnd socially withdraw from others\ndue to having low self-esteem,\ndifficulty communicating,\nand overwhelming feelings of emptiness,\nworthlessness, and hopelessness.\nNumber two, I'm a burden\nto everyone around me.\nSimilar to the previous point,\ndepression can trick\neven the most confident,\nmost popular, and well\nliked person into believing\nthat they're a burden that\nnobody really wants around.\nTerrifying, right?\nBut that's just all the more reason\nwhy you shouldn't believe your mind\nwhen it tells you lies like that.\nBecause the moment you do, you\nmight simply resign yourself\nto suffering in silence, when in reality,\nthere are so many people out\nthere who truly care about you\nand who wanna help make sure\nthat you're doing all right.\nNumber three, I'm no good at anything.\nThe American Psychological Association\nlists a lack of motivation to do anything\nas one of the core features of depression.\nSo it should come as no surprise\nthat the moment you try to do anything,\neven the things that used\nto come so easy to you\nor the things that used to make you happy,\nare crushed by your depression.\nAlways there to discourage you\nand tell you that you're not good at it.\nIt's, unfortunately, the\nreason why most people\nsuffering from depression\ntend to have a decline\nin their performance, be it\nprofessional or academic.\nAs well as lose interest in\ntheir passions and hobbies.\nUltimately, depression has a nasty habit\nof making you more\ncritical and hyper-fixated\non all your imagined\nflaws and shortcomings.\nNumber four, I'll never be good enough.\nAlmost everyone can relate\nto feeling like they're not good enough\nwhen they're at a low\npoint in their lives.\nBut depression can take this\ntemporary feeling of self-doubt\nand make it worse by compounding it\nwith feelings of insecurity,\nworthlessness, and inadequacy.\nBut always remember, that's\njust the mental illness talking.\nEven if you don't feel like it,\nyou are more than enough,\njust the way you are.\nNumber five, it's wrong\nfor me to feel this way.\nOne of most harmful misconceptions\nsurrounding mental illness\nis the startling lack of\nawareness people have towards it.\nA lot of people still\nthink that depression\nis all in their heads and that\nthe people suffering from it\ncan just snap out of it\nif they try hard enough.\nBut don't let your depression\nor anyone who doesn't understand\nit, shame you into thinking\nthat it's wrong for you to feel this way\nor that it's somehow your\nfault for being depressed.\nMental illness is a very serious,\nand very complicated, and very real thing.\nModern day psychologists\nstill don't have any conclusive\nanswers for what causes it,\nso it's important not to\njudge yourself too harshly.\nNumber six, they'd all\nbe better off without me.\nAccording to a recent survey conducted\nby the National Alliance\nAgainst Mental Illness,\nthe rates of suicide and\ndepression are closely linked.\nPeople who are struggling with depression\nare more likely to attempt suicide\nor experience suicidal thoughts.\nThis is because depression\ncan bring you down\nand make you think that you're worthless,\nthat your life means nothing,\nor that people would be\nbetter off without you.\nBut please never listen\nto that awful thought.\nYou wouldn't be here if the\nuniverse didn't need you.\nYour existence is wonderful and unique,\nand your life is always going\nto be worth fighting for.\nAnd number seven, there's\nno use getting help\nbecause I'll never get better.\nDealing with depression is no easy feat.\nEvery year, one out of 10 adults\nin the United States alone\nis diagnosed with depression.\nBut did you know that of\nthe 17.3 million people,\n71% experience severe impairment,\nwith only 19% of them\nactually seeking treatment.\nAside from the prevalent lack of awareness\nand stigma against mental illness,\na major barrier that keeps people\nfrom seeing a professional\nto treat their depression\nis the belief that there's no point.\nThat it's impossible to get better,\nthat they're gonna feel this way forever.\nBut really, there's always\nlight at the end of the tunnel.\nMore than 80% of those who\nseek treatment for depression,\nimprove and eventually recover.\nSo don't let your depression fool you.\nSeek help to get better.\nDid you find this video insightful?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nAlso, be sure to like,\nsubscribe, and share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nDon't forget to hit
