    "transcript": "- [Narrator] When we\nthink of mental health,\nwe can often brush aside\nany worries or concerns\nwe have on the matter.\nAnd instead, choose to only\nfocus on our physical health\nbut this can be a mistake.\nWhile some may choose to ignore\ntheir emotional wellbeing.\nOthers realize that mental health\nis an important part of\nour health as a whole.\nIt is certainly far from nothing.\nIn fact, physical health and\nmental health, often coincide.\nIf you are emotionally unhealthy,\nyou're likely to see physical symptoms\nas well as mental ones.\nIf you're physically unhealthy\nyour mental health could be affected.\nDid you know stress can\ncause your hair to thin\nand become brittle?\nOr what about chest\npains you've been having.\nThat could be a sign of stress as well.\nSo why is it that we treat\nour physical and mental\nhealth so differently\nif they're both linked closely\nin a chain reaction of symptoms?\nAccording to the 2017\nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health,\nnearly one in five American adults\nwill have a diagnosable\nmental health condition\nin any given year.\nAnd according to a comparative study,\n46% of Americans will meet the criteria\nfor a diagnosable mental health condition\nsometime in their life.\nWith half of those people\ndeveloping conditions\nby the age of 14.\nThe number of US adults\nwith a mental illness,\na whopping 44 million.\nAnd those with a mental illness\nare at higher risk of physical disease\nand have reduced access\nto adequate healthcare.\nThat's only the beginning.\nTake depression for example,\naccording to a study published\nin The Lancet Psychiatry,\nthose with depression\nhave a 40% higher risk\nof developing cardiovascular\nand metabolic disease\nthan the general population.\nPeople with serious mental illnesses\nare nearly twice as likely\nto develop these conditions.\nHm, sounds pretty important to me.\nWe wanted to let you know\nthat your love and support\nhelps us on our journey to make\npsychology and mental health\nmore accessible to everyone.\nBecause of you we can continue in our goal\nto spread awareness about\nmental health and psychology.\nThanks for the love.\nNow onto the video.\nSo why do some of us still brush off\nour mental health as nothing?\nWe all deserve the time\nand attention needed\nto address all of our\nproblems and concerns,\nmental and emotional as well as physical.\nMental health is not only\nour emotional wellbeing\nbut physiological and social as well.\nIt affects how we think feel and react.\nIt affects how we handle\nsituations and stress.\nHow we relate to others and our decisions.\nThere are many ways in\nwhich our mental health\ncan affect us.\nHere are just a few to start you with.\nI'm sure a lot of us\nsuppress our emotions.\nIt can happen without us\neven fully realizing it.\nSuppressing emotions\nis yet another example\nof how our mental health can affect us.\nIf we choose to ignore certain symptoms\nand suppress negative emotions,\nwe're only doing more harm than good.\nJust because you consciously\nsuppress your emotions\ndoes not mean they go away.\nInstead, they build up.\nYou should instead express emotions,\nsuch as sadness, anger or\nanxiety to someone you trust.\nResearch published in the APAs\nJournal of Experimental Psychology\nshow that expressive writing\nreduces suppressed and\nintrusive negative thoughts\nand can improve our working memory,\nwhich can then allow us to\nuse our cognitive resources\nto focus on what's important to us\nand improve how we handle stress.\nStill choosing to ignore\nyour symptoms or emotions?\nLet's say you haven't\nbeen feeling well lately\nand have suppressed a lot of\nanger that you've been feeling.\nYou tell yourself, you have\nmore important things to do.\nAnd what if you let that anger build up?\nWell, holding in that anger\nmeans the emotion lasts longer\nas it's hidden inside of you.\nIt can have a physical\nimpact on you as well.\nGet ready for a long list.\nAnger has been linked to obesity,\nlow self-esteem, migraines,\ndrug and alcohol addiction,\ndepression, sexual performance problems,\nincreased heart attack risk,\nlower quality relationships,\nhigher probability of abusing others\nemotionally or physically or both,\nhigher blood pressure and\nstroke, says Dr. Schinnerer,\nan anger management coach\nwho was also a consultant on\nthe Pixar movie Inside Out.\nYou know, the animated\nfilm about emotions.\nAnger can also lead to insomnia, anxiety,\nself-esteem issues and mental\nor brain fog to name a few.\nThis is just anger.\nThere are physical and mental problems\nthat can arise from any\nsuppression of emotion it seems.\nBecause if these emotions build up\nthey will eventually arise to the surface\nand likely explode out\nof you like a volcano.\nJust giving you a visual example.\nSo what are we supposed to do\nabout all of these feelings?\nWell, Schinnerer suggests,\none way to break this cycle\nand that begins with mindfulness.\nOne way to do this, he says,\nis by becoming more aware\nof when you are angry\nin the present moment,\nthan looking at the emotion\nin a nonjudgmental and curious way.\nSo instead of beating yourself up,\nacknowledge how you're feeling\nand think about ways to cope.\nStill not convinced?\nYou want another example\nof how your mental health can affect you.\nOkay.\nWell perhaps you don't\nsuppress your emotions\nbut instead let your\ninsecurities get the best of you.\nInsecurities are a perfect example\nof a small mental health struggle\nthat we can all relate to.\nAn example that not\nonly affects our health,\nbut our behavior as well.\nEveryone has insecurities.\nIt's a normal part of being human.\nBut if you're constantly\nthinking of your flaws\nand how others might judge you,\nit can be the beginning\nof a very unhealthy habit.\nEven if you want to change yourself\nfor the better and improve yourself,\ndon't beat yourself up over it.\nIt's a great goal to try to\nimprove yourself in many ways,\nperhaps starting with your mental health.\nBut telling yourself that these goals\nare the only thing that can make you happy\nis a recipe for disaster.\nBecause even if you do accomplish\nthe goals you're striving for,\nthe added weight and\nimportance you place on them\ncan make the great feeling of achievement\nand accomplishing your goals\nnot all that you thought\nit would be in your mind.\nWe tend to build things up in our heads\nand that's the reality\nwe tend to strive for.\nBut maybe the life in your head\nis not all you thought it would be.\nWhen you finally reach the mountaintop\nand take a look at your\nlong awaited vista,\nthere's always a time\nwhen you'll have to start\nthe long track back down\nbecause not every moment will feel\nas high as the mountain tops.\nAnd that's normal.\nThe point is to keep moving\nforward on your path,\non your journey.\nBettering our mental\nhealth takes patience.\nIt takes time and patience\nto heal these wounds,\nbig or small.\nAnd while others may tell you\nwhat you're feeling may be nothing,\nyou know better.\nYou know it's time to\ngive your mental health\nthe time and attention it deserves.\nSo how do you view your mental health?\nDid you learn something new?\nLet us know in the comments below\nand feel free to share this video\nwith someone who could benefit from it.\nMake sure to like and\nsubscribe to Psych2Go\nfor more psychology content.\nAnd as always, thanks\nso much for
