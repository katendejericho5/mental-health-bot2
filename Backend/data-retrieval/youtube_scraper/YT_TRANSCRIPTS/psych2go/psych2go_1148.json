the\ncomplexities of life from a negative\npoint of view\nasking yourself what the purpose of\nanything is and why things are the way\nthey are\nthey're difficult questions that have no\ndefinitive answer\nand existentialism brings this focus to\nthe forefront\nyou may feel that these overwhelming\nquestions are taking over your life and\nit's getting harder and harder to break\naway from\nif

incredible\nloneliness\nsometimes when you're caught up in\ndebunking the meanings of the world it\ncan be hard to connect with others\nwhen struggling with existentialism it\ncan be difficult to see the people\naround you\nyou might struggle to find the purpose\nof hanging out with others or to just\nfind people who can relate to your\nproblems\nwhen distant from others it's easy to\nfeel incredibly alone and isolated\nfortunately we want to remind you that\nthere are people who care and will\nlisten if you reach out to them\nnumber three\nyou feel like life is meaningless\ndo you feel like your life has no\nmeaning\ndoes everything you do seem futile in\nthe grand scheme of things\nif so you may be struggling with\nexistential depression\nyou may ask yourself what the point is\nwhen it comes to getting a college\ndegree getting married or starting a new\nproject\nwhen you have the mindset that\neverything will eventually be erased\nit can be hard to move forward\nwhile

you exhausted all the time\nperhaps your favorite activities have\nbecome less fun and the thought of\nstarting a new one feels more tiring\nthan actually doing it if you especially\nbelieve that

find that you think differently\nfrom the rest of your friends or that\nyour philosophies and views about life\ndiffer from the general crowd\nthis can be incredibly frustrating to\ndeal with and may lead to a tendency to\ndistance and isolate yourself from\neveryone\nnumber six your thoughts keep you up at\nnight sleeping can be difficult with\nexistentialism\nin the quiet moments of the night it can\nbe simple for some deep questions to\ncreep in\nthe idea of falling asleep can feel\nimpossible when so many big questions\nare on your mind\nquestions like what is the meaning of\nlife what is your purpose here what's\nthe point in doing the things you're\ncurrently doing\nthese thoughts may start plaguing your\nmind and prevent you from getting any\nrestful sleep number seven\nyou struggle
