    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Were you ever\ntold that you are gifted?\nThe term \"gifted\" usually\nrefers to individuals\nwith unique abilities that set\nthem apart from their peers.\nEven if you don't think\nyourself as gifted,\nyou may be surprised to learn\nthat you share some of the same traits.\nCurious to know what they are?\nHere are five signs that\nyou are secretly gifted.\nNumber one: you have\ntrouble with languages.\nDo you often struggle with\ngrammar or vocabulary?\nAccording to Boston College\nprofessor Ellen Winner,\ngifted individuals have a\nunique brain organization\nwhere the right hemisphere of the brain\ndominates the left hemisphere,\nsometimes even taking over its functions.\nSince the left hemisphere\nusually deals with vocabulary,\ngrammar, and comprehension,\nthis may result in an uneven\nset of mental abilities\nwhere language abilities lose out.\nProfessor Winner also noted\nthat over 12,000 students\nin the United States\nare both gifted and learning\nimpaired at the same time,\nwith most having dyslexia.\nOne of the best examples\nof uneven giftedness\nis Albert Einstein,\nas he could not speak\nuntil the age of three\nand did not speak fluently\nuntil the age of 10.\nNumber two: you are not right-handed.\nAre you left-handed or right-handed?\nIn addition to what was mentioned,\nProfessor Winner noted\nthat gifted individuals\nare more likely to be\nleft-handed or ambidextrous,\ncompared to the general\npopulation who are right-handed.\nMany researchers believe\nthat parental conditions\ncan significantly affect the development\nof the fetal brain and key\npsychological outcomes.\nRemember how the right\nhemisphere often dominates\nover the left hemisphere in gifted brains?\nThe same developmental paths\nthat lead to this brain structure\nalso frequently result\nin non-right-handedness.\nNumber three: you have immune issues.\nHow's your immune system?\nYou may not think that the immune system\nis related to the brain,\nbut there is a common factor between them.\nAs mentioned previously,\nprenatal conditions\nhave significant effects\non the development of the brain.\nThe exact same conditions\nthat lead to gifted brains\nalso affect the rest of the body,\ndisrupting the functioning\nof the immune system.\nGifted individuals are\nnoted to have a higher rate\nof asthma, allergies, and\nother autoimmune disorders.\nNumber four: you have a\nstrong working memory.\nHow many things can you\nremember at the same time?\nResearch shows that strong working memory\ncan be a sign of a gifted mind.\nThis is because gifted people\noften have a greater ability\nto solve problems in a creative way.\nThey can think out of the box\nand come up with many fresh\nperspectives and angles.\nAnd while their thought process\nmay look chaotic and uninhibited,\ntheir ability to think on\na number of different ideas\nand thoughts at the same\ntime all of the time\nreinforces and strengthens\ntheir working memory.\nNumber five: you have extreme mood swings.\nDoes your mood usually go\nup and down all the time?\nResearch has shown that\ncreatively gifted individuals\nare at a higher risk for cyclothymia,\na mental condition that\ninvolves sudden changes\nbetween periods of depression\nand periods of elevated\nmood called hypomania.\nDuring periods of hypomania,\nmental recollection may become\nsharper, emotions intense,\nand stamina virtually unlimited.\nAn investigation of high school students\neven showed that those with\nthe most hypomanic symptoms\nalso had the highest degree\nof creative achievement.\nDid you relate to any of the\ntraits mentioned in this video?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video with those\nwho might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThanks for watching, and\nsee you in our next video.\n(gentle music)"
