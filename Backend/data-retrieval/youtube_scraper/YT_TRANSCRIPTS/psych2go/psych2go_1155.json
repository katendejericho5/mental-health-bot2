    "transcript": "- [Teacher] Hey,\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nYou may have heard of ADHD.\nBut what about ADD?\nAnd what do you know about ADHD?\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\nis a behavioral syndrome\nwith characteristics\nof inattention and impulsivity.\nADHD is a general label that\nhouses three different types.\nHyperactive, inattentive, or combined.\nThese separate terms\nrefer to how the symptoms\nmanifest themselves.\nHowever, when most people think of ADHD,\nthey only imagine a hyperactive student\nrunning around a classroom.\nBut that's only one of the ways\nin which ADHD may manifest itself.\nInattentive ADHD or ADD can be associated\nwith the student who stares at the window\nor unwittingly ignores\nthe work in front of them.\nIt's a term used to describe\na neurological condition\nwith symptoms of\ninattention, distractibility,\nand poor working memory.\nTo help you learn more about\nthe less talked about hype,\nhere are five signs of inattentive ADHD.\nNumber one, often daydreaming\nor is easily distracted.\nDo you get distracted all the time?\nADHD is typically associated\nwith hyperactivity,\nbut it would be stigmatizing and incorrect\nto assume that people with ADHD\ndo not have moments of inactivity.\nInstead, inactivity is a\npredominant characteristic\nof inattentive ADHD, which at times,\nmay get misinterpreted as tranquility.\nThis inattentiveness is not\nsomething you can control,\nbut is usually a byproduct\nof lack of focus.\nThis tendency to daydream or be distracted\nall the time can be problematic\nwhen it comes to doing schoolwork.\nFor example, in a classroom setting,\na child with ADHD may\nhave trouble committing\nto an activity for an\nextended period of time,\nor with not paying\nattention when spoken to.\nIn adults, this sign can\nmanifest itself in the same way.\nNumber two, is bored quickly.\nAre you always bored?\nBoredom itself is not a sign\nof a neuro behavioral disorder.\nIn many cases, it just means your brain\nneeds more mental stimulation.\nHowever, in the context of\nADHD, frequent bouts of boredom\ncan point to difficulty\nsustaining mental effort.\nOverstimulating environments or activities\ncan produce a sense of boredom\nbecause the constant barrage of stimuli\ncan cause your brain to feel overwhelmed.\nBecause of this, it shuts down\nor becomes bored as a response.\nNumber three, does not pay\nclose attention or is careless.\nDo you struggle to pay\nclose attention to things?\nAnother symptom of inattentive ADHD\nis the tendency to overlook details.\nAnd as a result, make careless mistakes.\nPerhaps you fail to proofread documents\nor emails before sending them.\nThis can end up affecting\nyour productivity\nor quality of work and\nlead others to believe\nthat you're not serious about your tasks.\nFor children, the symptom\nmay affect them the most\nduring exams, since they\nmay accidentally skip\nentire sections of a quiz.\nIf you struggle a lot with the symptom,\nyou may wanna try telling\nyourself to slow down.\nIt might feel uncomfortable,\nbecause your brain wants\nto jump to the next thing.\nBut try to challenge yourself\nto spend a little longer\non what you're doing.\nNumber four, forgets routine chores.\nAre you always scolded\nfor not doing your chores?\nOftentimes, with inattentive ADHD,\nyour mind can feel like it's running\na thousand miles a minute,\nand you end up forgetting\ncertain things along the way.\nUnfortunately, this\nforgetfulness may present\na struggle in school or work environment.\nSince you may forget to complete\nor hand in assignments or tasks,\nthis can cause others to label\nyour behavior as laziness.\nBut that's not what it really is.\nIf this is something you\nstruggle with frequently,\nyou may wanna reach out to a\ntrusted friend or supervisor\nto let them know what's really going on.\nIt may also be helpful\nto speak to a therapist,\nas they may help you create a plan\nthat makes it easier for you\nto remember chores and tasks.\nAnd number five, avoids\ntasks that require focus.\nA final sign of inattentive ADHD\nis the tendency to avoid\ntasks that require focus.\nSince many people with ADHD experience\ndifficulty controlling their focus,\nit should not come as a surprise\nthat many will avoid tasks\nthat require a lot of it.\nHere, it's important to\nnote that we do not want\nto generalize and say that this applies\nto everyone with ADHD.\nAlso, even if it does apply to you,\nyour will and desire to\ndo what you want to do,\neven if it requires a lot of\nfocus, will eventually win out.\nA way to help with this\nis to try breaking up\nlarge tasks into smaller,\nmore doable ones.\nTo help you go through with the chore,\nyou can try coming up with something\nthat works and suits you.\nIt could be having a\nfriend or family member\nsend you reminder texts to complete tasks.\nIf you need more assistance or guidance,\nyou can also reach out\nto a therapist for help.\nDo you have a lot of trouble focusing?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video with
