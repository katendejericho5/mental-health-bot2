    "transcript": "[Narrator] - Hey Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nDid you know that 264 million people\naround the world reportedly\nsuffer from depression?\nHowever, there's still a large number\nof people who remain ignorant\nabout the nature of depression.\nA common misconception is\nthat depression looks the same\nfor everybody and is easy\nto identify in others.\nThis isn't always true.\nBefore we begin, we wanna remind you\nthat this video is for\ninformative purposes only.\nIt's not intended to diagnose\nor treat any condition.\nPlease reach out to a\nqualified healthcare provider\nor mental health professional\nif you're struggling.\nWith that said,\nhere are six of the most\noften overlooked symptoms\nof depression that you should know about.\nNumber one, overeating.\nWhile most people may associate\ndepression with weight loss\nand loss of appetite, the\nopposite can actually be true.\nOvereating is an uncommon,\nbut still significant symptom\nof depression because it\nindicates a disturbance\nin one's normal eating\nhabits and patterns,\nwhich is likely due to low mood.\nDramatic weight gain may\nbe especially telling\nof depression as well, because\nmost people tend to use food\nas a coping method when they're stressed.\nNumber two, oversleeping.\nAnother less commonly\nknown symptom of depression\nis oversleeping or hypersomnia.\nThough it is much more common\nfor people who are depressed\nto suffer from insomnia,\nthat is being unable to sleep most days,\nhypersomnia is still\nconsidered a warning sign\nthat someone may be mentally unwell, why?\nBecause a sudden desire to spend most\nof your hours asleep indicates\nemotional burnout, fatigue,\nlow energy, negative\nfeelings, lack of motivation,\nand most of all, a depressed mood.\nNumber three, substance abuse.\nThough we might not\nimmediately think that someone\nwho uses drugs or drinks a lot of alcohol\nis actually crying out for help,\nespecially if they do it\nfrequently or at parties,\nit's important to take a closer look\nat this kind of behavior,\njust to make sure.\nAfter all, just like\nsleeping or overeating,\na lot of people often\nturn to drugs or alcohol\nto help them cope with\nfeelings of intense sadness,\nemptiness, and loneliness.\nNumber four, risky behavior,\nsimilar to substance use.\nYou might think someone who drinks a lot,\nexperiments with drugs, and\ndoes risky, but exciting things\nare only having fun and\nlooking for a good time.\nHowever, it might indicate feelings\nof hopelessness, self-destructiveness,\nand suicidal ideation.\nRisky behaviors such as\nspeeding, drunk driving,\ngetting into fights, having\nfrequent unprotected sex,\nstealing, vandalizing, smoking, and so on,\nmay be deliberate attempts\nto put oneself in harm's way\nand could mean that\nsomeone is spiraling deeper\ninto their depression.\nNumber five, anger and irritability.\nWhen we think of someone who's depressed,\nwe often picture a person who's sad, down,\nand lying in bed all day doing nothing.\nBut frequent and sudden bouts of anger\nor irritability could be\nsymptoms of depression too.\nThis is particularly common among men.\nPsychologists believe\nthat this is because anger\nis meant to either suppress\ntheir emotional torment,\nor become a replacement for it.\nMany men don't feel comfortable enough\nto be open about their depression,\nor might not even realize they have it.\nSo they become angry and irritable\nas a maladaptive way of coping.\nAnd number six, uncontrollable emotions.\nAside from anger and irritability,\npeople may also become\nuncontrollably emotional\nwhen struggling with depression.\nMood swings, temper tantrums,\nincreased sensitivity\nto rejection, and hysterical crying\nare sometimes observed in\npatients who are depressed.\nForgot to mention something to them?\nIt'll likely turn into a big fight.\nMissed their call because you were busy?\nThey're probably going\nto spend hours crying\nand overthinking about it.\nThose with depression can't cope well\nwith even the slightest of stressors\nand will often get overly\nemotional about everything.\nOh, did these symptoms remind\nyou of someone you know,\nor maybe even yourself?\nPlease remember that this content\nis meant to be informational\nand is not intended\nto diagnose or treat any condition.\nBut if you do spot these warning signs\nin yourself or anyone you know,\nplease reach out to a mental\nhealthcare professional today.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nplease let us know in the comments below.\nLike and share this with friends\nthat might find this valuable too.\nRemember to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAnd all the resources used are added\nin the description box below.\nThanks so much for\nwatching, until next time."
