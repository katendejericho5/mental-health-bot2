    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey,\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nHave you ever wondered\nwhat the difference is\nbetween depression and laziness?\nDepression and laziness\nhave a lot in common.\nBoth can result in a lack of productivity\nand a general inability to function\nthrough life's challenges.\nA person who is feeling down\nafter a hard day at work\nmay come home wanting nothing more\nthan to lay in their bed all day,\nbut does feeling lethargic make you lazy\nor is it more than that?\nHere are the differences you should know\nbetween laziness and depression.\nNumber one, length of time.\nDo you feel an extreme sense\nof sadness and lethargy\nthroughout the day or does it\nonly happen every so often?\nDepression is labeled as a\npersistent feeling of being sad,\nhopeless and empty over\na long period of time.\nWhen you are depressed,\nit feels like nothing\ncan ever make you feel happy\nno matter what you try.\nYou can't find it within\nyourself to do anything,\nwhether it's good for you or not.\nLaziness is a bit different.\nUnlike depression, it isn't\na psychological disorder.\nIt's a momentary state.\nFeeling lethargy from time to\ntime is common for everyone.\nThat's just the body\nrecovering from stress\nor a lack of sleep,\nbut usually after a good night's rest\nor a moment of relaxation,\nyour body will feel refreshed again\nand can function on a day-to-day basis.\nNumber two.\nSense of control.\nDo you feel like a new\nreward can cause a shift\nin your motivation to accomplish a task?\nFor people with depression,\nworking towards a goal\nor something that brings\nthem happiness is too much.\nThey struggle to find the energy\nwithin themselves to take action\nand they often think they\ndon't deserve anything better,\nthat everything is hopeless\nand there's no point in doing things\nas they feel they have no\ncontrol over their actions.\nWhere lazy people, they\nusually lack motivation\nto do the things that\nare expected of them.\nThe reasons for this are plenty.\nPerhaps they don't like their boss,\naren't fulfilled at work or\nhave too many things to do.\nBut once a lazy person is\nplaced in the right environment,\nthey'll feel much more\nmotivated to be productive.\nFor people with depression,\ntheir mental faculties\nmake them feel largely\nindifferent towards most things,\nmaking it harder for them\nto get out of the rut.\nUsually professional\nintervention is necessary.\nNumber three, chemical imbalance.\nThe brains of people with depression\nare noticeably more\ndifferent than lazy people\nbased on FMRI scans.\nIn a study published in \"The\nJournal of Neuroscience\",\nthe hippocampus of participants\nwho had a history of depression\nreported 9% to 13% smaller size\ncompared to those without depression.\nThis means fewer serotonin receptors\nor the chemical that regulates mood.\nThis can also be linked with stress,\na major factor of depression,\nwhich can slow down the production\nof new neurons in the hippocampus.\nPeople who feel lazy however,\ndon't have as much of these\nmajor brain alterations\nas depressed people.\nWhile there could be overlaps in symptoms,\ndepression is a serious\npsychological disorder\nwhere parts of the\nbrain, like the amygdala,\nthalamus and hippocampus\nare wired differently\nand contribute to one's\ndepressive mind states.\nNumber four, excessive worry.\nDo you catch yourself having\nself-defeating thoughts\nand constant ruminations?\nRumination, the persistent\nfocus on negative feelings\nis a common symptom of depression.\nRuminating can also force\npeople to isolate themselves,\nwhich can worsen one's depressive mood.\nPeople who ruminate tend\nto be perfectionists\nand overvalue their\nrelationships with others,\neven if it's not an unhealthy one.\nPeople who are lazy\nusually don't get caught up\nby ruminations or critical thoughts\nand aren't worried about things\nthat happened in the past,\nbut may be concerned\nabout the consequences\nof their future through\ntheir lack of action.\nAnd number five, depression\naffects your physical health.\nDepression is known to not\njust affect your state of mind,\nbut also your physical\nhealth and wellbeing.\nFor instance, depressed\npeople are more likely\nto have trouble\nconcentrating and memory-loss\ndue to the rewiring in their brains,\nespecially older adults.\nInsomnia, constricted\nblood vessels, fatigue\nand weakened immune systems\nare all some of the more\ncommon symptoms of depression\nwhich can affect your overall health.\nLazy people are less likely to be affected\nby physical health issues,\nunlike people with depression.\nThey may sometimes feel fatigued\ndue to not sleeping enough\nor making poor diet choices,\nbut laziness doesn't have\na major impact on the body\nlike depression does.\nSo can you relate to any of the signs\nand symptoms mentioned?\nIf so, let us know in the comments.\nWe hope you've learned the difference\nbetween depression and laziness\nand if you like this video,\nshare it with someone who\nyou think might benefit.\nAs always, the references and studies used\nare listed in the description below.\nThanks so much for watching.\nTake care and we'll see you next time."
