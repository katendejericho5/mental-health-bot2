    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Do you sometimes wish\nyou could make a love\npotion or a magic spell\nto make someone instantly like you?\nWaiting for them to notice you\nwhile fantasizing about\nthem can be so frustrating.\nLuckily, you don't have to\nleave everything to chance.\nMaybe you can't put\nthoughts into their head,\nbut you can try out some\npsychological tips and tricks\nthat are proven to be effective\nwhen it comes to attraction.\nSo without further ado,\nhere are six attractive\nhabits to attract your crush.\nNumber one, have some jokes on you.\nSome find humor to be\nthe most important trait\nin a romantic relationship.\nAnd research has shown that people\nwho have a good sense of humor\nare perceived as more attractive\nthan intelligent people.\nWhile sharing a good laugh with somebody,\nyou're actually creating a bond\nand connection between you.\nA good sense of humor\nis sexually attractive,\nas it expresses wisdom, creativity,\nand other positive traits.\nYou can also be flirty and playful\nif used well, and not over the top.\nBy cracking a joke, you\ncould break the tension,\ncreate a positive and vibrant atmosphere\nand appear confident.\nAnd making your crush laugh\ncould definitely give\nyou some bonus points.\nNumber two, show interest\nin what they like.\nStudies have shown that people love\ntalking about themselves.\nIt makes them happy and content,\nand they especially like it\nwhen others show interest\nin what they have to say.\nSo ask your crush about\nthe band on their T-shirt,\nand if they could send\nsome songs to listen to.\nOr maybe ask about their favorite sport,\nand if they cheer for some club,\nor even their thoughts\non a recent news story.\nWhile listening, nod to\nshow you're listening,\nrepeat some things they said,\nand ask them to clarify\nif you don't understand,\nand try to remember little\ndetails for future conversations.\nThis way, they'll know they\nhave your full attention.\nThe more you ask and the more you show\nyou are actually interested\nin what they're saying,\nthe more they'll be drawn towards you.\nNumber three, take them\nout to see a scary movie.\nHave you ever watched a movie\nwhere a couple on a date\nwent to see a horror movie?\nWell, whoever of the two planned the date\nwas a real psychologist at heart.\nOur brain processes intense emotions\nlike fear and excitement\non a cognitive level.\nAnd our bodies respond\non a psychological level.\nWhen you watch a scary movie,\nall the excitement your\nmind and body are feeling\ncreates a strong emotional experience.\nBut somewhere between eating popcorn\nand jumping with fright,\nour minds can get things kind of mixed up.\nAccording to Dutton's and\nAaron's study from 1974,\nthis is called the\nmissattribution of arousal.\nWhat happens is that your mind takes\nthe signals from your\nbody, increased heart rate,\nfaster breathing, sweating, blushing,\nand instead of connecting\nit to fear from the movie,\nit connects it with attraction.\nSo if you took your crush\nout to see a horror movie,\ntheir mind and body might make them feel\nlike they're attracted to you.\nNumber four, mimic their body language.\nHave you ever heard of the\nterm mirroring behavior?\nIt's a term often used\nin social psychology,\nand it means matching your body language\nto the other person, also\nknown as the chameleon effect.\nThis psychological trick has been proven\nto increase the liking of\npeople in an interaction.\nBasically, your crush could like you more\nif you mirror their behavior.\nTo mirror or match their body language,\nfirst pay attention to\ntheir non-verbal cues.\nDo they often run their\nfingers through their hair,\nor keep their arms crossed?\nAnd then you just repeat\nit, wait for a few seconds,\nand cross your arms too,\nor also touch your hair.\nBut it's important to remember\nthat you shouldn't overdo it.\nMake it subtle to be successful.\nNumber five, surprise them\nwith a small act of kindness.\nSmall act of kindness\nare one of the best ways\nto tell someone that you care about them\nwithout directly telling them.\nYou can show them you listen to them.\nThat you're eager to know what they like,\nand that you wanna make them happy.\nMaybe you remember their\nfavorite chocolate,\nand bought it for them out of the blue.\nOr perhaps, you know their\nfavorite music genre,\nso you shared a customized\nplaylist with them.\nOr you made nice artwork\nfor no apparent reason.\nThey will surely appreciate\nthose nice gestures.\nOf course, you don't wanna overdo it.\nGetting them gifts in\nfavors every other day\nor buying expensive things\ncould scare them away.\nFind a balance and show\nthem how much you care.\nAnd number six, make it\nknown you're available.\nOf course, nobody will approach you\nif they're unsure if you're available.\nSo while trying out other tricks,\nmake it known that you're single\nand there's nobody to compete with them,\nif they ever decide to finally\ntake you out on a date.\nYou don't wanna just\nsay, \"Hey, I'm single.\"\nInstead, try to make it a joke.\nFor example, saying,\n\"I'll be taking myself\n\"for a Valentine's Day dinner this year.\"\nEven better if you say it while\ngiving them a small glance.\nAs stated, there is know\nmagical spell or potion\nto make someone like you
