    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nAre you having trouble\ndeciding if your friend\nis a real friend?\nWhat do you mean by real? You may ask.\nWell, I'm talking about a friend\nwho has your best interests at heart.\nA friend who is genuine\nwith you and not sneaky.\nIf you've had a friend for\na while and you feel unhappy\nor that something's just\noff, it may be signed for you\nto take a moment to determine\nwhether or not this friend\nis a true pal or a toxic one.\nHere are six signs they're\nnot your real friend.\nNumber one, they don't show interest\nor ask about the details of your life.\nHow much interest does your\nfriend show in your life?\nDo they ask you how your day was?\nIf they do, do they actually listen\nor look like they can't wait\nuntil they can talk next?\nA genuine friend is just that, genuine.\nSo if they ask how you are,\nit may be polite at first\nbut if you have something to say,\nthey'll be sure to\nlisten and show support.\nThey care about you and simply\nwanna get to know you better.\nHere's to hoping you show\nas much support and care\ntowards them too.\nNumber two, they're not reliable\nand they're not there when\nyou need them the most.\nFriends are there for you,\nespecially when you're having a hard time.\nIf your friend can't stop\ntalking about themselves\nand their problems while\nnot considering your own,\nthen they're likely not a real friend.\nYou may be actively listening\nto all of their worries\nand tough situations.\nI had to take the garbage out today.\nThere were so many dishes piled\nup and they smelled so bad.\nJason never called me back.\nMy ferret died.\nOkay, the last one was pretty bad.\nSo I mean, be there\nfor them but if one day\nit's then your turn to\ntalk about your worries\nand all they do is interrupt\nwith a quick, oh, I gotta go.\nOr they don't even bother to ask,\ndon't even bother with them\nunless this is an uncommon\noccurrence with them\nand they're going through something.\nThey're likely placing all\ntheir negative energy on you\nand taking all of your positive\nwhile not bothering to give back.\nIf you still wanna be friends\nand since there is something\nelse going on, bring up\nyour concerns with them,\nmention that they haven't\nbeen there for you\nas much as you'd counted on.\nIf they still won't listen,\nit's likely you're in\na toxic relationship.\nNumber three, they're\nextremely critical of you.\nSome fake friends can\nbe extremely critical\nof their friends.\nRemember, your buddy shouldn't\nbe your biggest critic.\nThey should be your biggest fan.\nSome friends can offer\nconstructive criticism\nbecause they want the best for you\nand wanna see you improve.\nThey're honest but they'll likely do so\nin a kind friendly way if\nthey are a good friend.\nIf your pal is toxic, they'll\nprobably just shame you\nrather than provide helpful critiques.\nIf they're a good friend,\nthey may just give a kind dose\nof honesty and advice.\nNumber four, if they say sorry,\ntheir apologies don't sound genuine.\nDoes your friends say\nsorry when they're wrong?\nNo? Oh-oh.\nWhat about when they do,\ndo they sound genuine?\nNo? Double oh-oh.\nIf your friend is one to\nignore your friendship concerns\nwith a look of meh,\nthen they're likely not a genuine friend.\nIf your friend does\napologize when they're wrong\nbut it's along the lines of this,\nI'm sorry you feel that way.\nThen they're not taking accountability\nfor their harmful actions and owning up\nto what they've done.\nGood friends can admit when they're wrong.\nThey'll then try to work on\ncorrecting any negative behavior\nthat affects their friendship.\nSo do you do the same?\nNumber five, they keep\nscore on how many times\nyou wrong them.\nDoes your friend hold a grudge?\nDo you hold a grudge towards them?\nToxic friendships often involve\none or both of the friends\ninvolved keeping score of\nmistakes the other has made.\nWhen you do something\nthat upsets them again\nor maybe you're in an argument,\nthey'll bring up all the\ndisappointments and negative things\nyou've said or done.\nArguments can get out of hand sometimes\nbut a toxic friend will tend to bring up\nthe toxic scoreboard only\nwhen they're confronted\nwith their wrongs.\nThey'll use all the times\nyou did something similar\nas a means of not having to\napologize or take accountability\nfor what they've done wrong.\nA good friend is honest\nand listens to the concerns\nof their buddy.\nWhile everyone can argue,\na healthy friendship\nis filled with healthy\nconstructive discussions\nrather than toxic fights.\nSo if your friend is acting\na bit harmful towards you,\nhow will you bring up the issue?\nBest to do so by having a\nhealthy, open discussion\nso things don't escalate.\nIf they still don't budge,\nthen you'll have to decide\nif they're really a good friend or not.\nAnd number six, they\nplay on your insecurities\nand make you feel unhappy.\nDo you feel unhappy around your friend?\nInsecure?\nYou don't need to feel\nyour most joyful self\nwhen around your friend, that's normal.\nAnd there can be times where\nyou feel nervous or unhappy\nas well from time to time.\nBut if your friend makes\nyou feel bad about yourself\nthen this could be another sign\nyou're in a toxic relationship.\nYou shouldn't always feel\non edge around your friend,\nafraid of their next\ncriticism or harsh words.\nMaybe they make snide remarks\nor always hold themselves\nin higher regards to you.\nA toxic friend may play\non your insecurities\nto make themselves feel better.\nBoth needs should be met in\na friendship without hurting\nthe others' feelings or\nmaking them feel unhappy.\nTake note of how you feel after\neach interaction with them.\nNext time you hang out with them,\nyou may have had a few fun\nmoments but do you come home\nfeeling discouraged,\nhumiliated or insecure?\nIs this because of something\nthey frequently say or do?\nIf so, it may just be that\nyou have a toxic friend.\nSo do you see any of these\nsigns in your friendships?\nIt's best to either openly\ndiscuss these concerns with them\nor think about letting\nthem go as a friend.\nDo you see these signs in yourself?\nIf so, know that change is possible.\nWork towards correcting\nany negative behavior\nyou recognize in yourself.\nIt may just be a small step\nyou have to take first.\nThen when you recognize\nand genuinely apologize\nfor your wrongdoing, your\nfriendship may have a good chance\nto get back on track.\nSooner or later, you may get\nback to a real friendship.\nWe hope you enjoyed this\nvideo and if you did,\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share it with your real friends.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAs always, thanks for watching."
