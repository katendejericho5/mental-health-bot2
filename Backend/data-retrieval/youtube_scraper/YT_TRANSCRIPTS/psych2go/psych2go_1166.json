    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you hate going home?\nFamily should feel like a sanctuary,\na place where you feel loved and safe.\nFor some lucky people,\nit may be just so.\nHowever for others,\na family home may be everything\nbut a sanctuary.\nAnd since you spend most of your time\nwith your family,\nyou may have become used\nto that type of environment.\nBecause of it,\nyou may be living in a toxic family\nwithout even knowing it.\nSomething might feel wrong,\nbut you're so used to living\nin a toxic environment\nthat it doesn't cross your mind\nthat other families have it better.\nFor this reason,\nhere are five differences\nbetween healthy and toxic family dynamics.\nNumber one, communication.\nHealthy.\nAre you able to communicate\nyour needs and opinions?\nIn a healthy family,\nyou're not afraid to\nsay what's on your mind\nand are happy to listen\nto your family members.\nIf there's something bothering you,\nyou know that they're always there for you\nto help you with whatever you need.\nToxic.\nBut if your family is toxic,\nthings may be a bit different.\nYour opinion and feelings\nmay be invalidated.\nYou can't even think\nabout talking to your family\nabout your problems\nbecause they'll either ignore you\nor turn it into a yelling match.\nIn the end,\nyou may learn to ignore them\nand to avoid bringing up\nany of your problems to them\nsince not communicating at all\nfeels better than being put down\nor having feelings.\nNumber two, respect.\nHealthy.\nIs respect important in your family?\nIn healthy families,\nbeing respected and respecting\nthe people around you\nis an important idea that is often\ntaught from an early age.\nParents that care for their children\nknow they are not their priority.\nThey're small people with their own minds.\nThey know their kids need validation\nand respect to grow into healthy\nand functional adults.\nAs children are shown respect,\nthey learn to also show\nit to their parents,\nother people and also to themselves.\nToxic.\nUnfortunately, some\nfamilies don't see respect\nas such a big deal.\nSometimes they may think\nit's a one sided gesture,\nwhere parents get to demand respect\nfrom their kids,\nbut don't show it to them in return.\nChildren in these types\nof households may be taught\nto not talk back,\nnot to demand anything,\nand to just listen and do as they're told.\nOften without any explanation.\nThis can have a negative effect\nwhere they end up doing things\nin fear of punishment\ninstead of in kindness.\nIn the long run,\nthey may even start to\nresent their parents.\nNumber three, criticism.\nHealthy.\nWhen you care about somebody,\nyou wanna be honest with them,\neven if the truth is not\nalways the prettiest.\nHealthy families know that.\nAnd so, are not afraid\nto give constructive criticism\nto their family members.\nWhen they critique,\nthey do it gently\nby emphasizing the good\nand giving suggestions about the bad.\nUltimately, they just\nwant their loved ones\nto be the best version of themselves\nand they wanna help them on that path.\nToxic.\nIn a toxic family,\ncriticism is often used as a weapon\nto attack and belittle\nother family members.\nIt's harsh, excessive,\nand extremely hurtful.\nIn families like these,\nyou may hear comments like,\n\"You can't do anything right,\n\"just look at yourself.\n\"You're stupid.\n\"What do you know?\"\nIn this situation,\nyou can't really grow as a person\nand it can take a toll on your feelings\nof self-worth and self-esteem.\nNumber four, privacy.\nHealthy.\nDo they respect your time and your space?\nPrivacy is an important\naspect of a child's life.\nIt helps them develop\ninto a strong, mindful person.\nSo parents in healthy families\nwill keep that in their mind.\nThis means knocking on\ntheir child's door before entering.\nNot listening in on conversations\nand never going through their things.\nIf there is a reason when privacy\nreally needs to be invaded,\nthey make sure to explain\nwhy that needs to happen\nand apologize for it.\nToxic.\nOn the other hand,\ntoxic parents won't think twice\nwhen it comes to invading\ntheir children's privacy.\nThey might ask too many questions\nand over interfere.\nFor example, they might\nread their kids' diary.\nDemand to go through their phone\nor find excuse is to stay\nin their child's room\nwhen they have friends over.\nIf a child tries to be assertive\nand ask for their\nboundaries to be respected,\nthey may just argue with them\nor pretend to do so.\nAnd number five, affection.\nHealthy.\nIs it usual for your\nfamily to show affection?\nPerhaps a kiss on the cheek, a long hug,\nor even just a word of kindness.\nIn a healthy family,\nfamily members love each other\nand are not afraid to show it.\nNo matter what happens,\nyou know you are loved\nand you will always try to make sure\nthat others know you love them too.\nWhile directly saying, \"I love you\"\nmight not be a thing for some families.\nSmall acts of kindness\nmay speak louder than words.\nToxic.\nHowever, for toxic families,\neven if you do love each other,\nyou may not know how to show it\nor even feel comfortable showing it.\nMembers may ignore the important aspects\nof family life\nor take their family members for granted.\nSince it may be rare\nfor you to get a hug or\na kiss from your family,\nyou might seek that love\noutside of your home.\nIn which category would\nyou put your family?\nDo you feel like you may not be perfect,\nbut you're still okay?\nOr do you see the signs\nof an unhealthy dynamic?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video\nwith
