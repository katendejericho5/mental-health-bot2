    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nDo you feel like your life is in a rut?\nAs the Chinese philosopher\nLao Tzu once said,\n\"Watch your habits, they\nbecome your character.\nWatch your character, it\nbecomes your destiny.\"\nSometimes we just need the right habits\nto turn our life around.\nWith that said, here are five simple\nbut powerful habits that\nwill change you forever.\nNumber one, work\nbackwards from your goals.\nDo you remember the last time\nyou set goals and failed?\nDon't worry, we've all been there.\nResearch from Oxford University shows\nthe best way to achieve a big goal\nis a method called WOOP,\nwhich stands for wish,\noutcome, opportunity, and plan.\nFirst, identify a challenging goal.\nThat's your wish.\nNext, vividly visualize the\nbest outcomes from the wish.\nThen think of the obstacles\nthat stand between you and your wish.\nFinally, plan small actions\nto achieve the goal,\nand overcome your obstacles.\nA study published\nin the Journal of\nGraduate Medical Education\ndemonstrated that the WOOP strategy\nis more effective than\nregular goal-setting,\nwhich is usually too wishy\nwashy to get results.\nNumber two, do one thing\nevery day that scares you.\nWhen's the last time you stepped outside,\nnot just your comfort zone,\nbut then did something\nthat truly terrified you?\nIt's easy to stick to what's\nfamiliar to avoid pain,\nbut life is never going to\nbe completely comfortable.\nTry to dive in headfirst,\nand embrace challenges.\nEvery day, aim to do one\nthing that scares you.\nTry making small talk with a stranger,\nand go skydiving, or ask out your crush.\nTake opportunities to\nmake the most of life,\nbut please be reasonable and keep safe.\nWe at Psych2Go don't want you\nto take up lion wrestling.\nNumber three, remember\nthe end of your life.\nHow often do you think\nabout the end of your life?\nWe know it sounds depressing,\nbut it can actually be exhilarating.\nWhen you are mentally\nstuck in the present,\ntasks seem urgent,\nsquabbles seem overwhelming,\nmistakes seem unbearable,\nand risks seem terrifying.\nInstead, imagine you're on your deathbed\nat the age of 80 or 90, looking\nback on your entire life.\nWhen you reminisce\non the most significant\nmoments of your whole life,\nwill you remember every\nlittle squabble and mistake?\nWhat will you regret more,\ntaking a big risk or staying safe\nand wondering what could have been?\nWhen you think of your life\nfrom a future perspective,\nall your problems become much smaller,\nand your purpose becomes much clearer.\nNumber four, be playful.\nLife's too short to be serious.\nHow many of the best moments\nof your life were full of joy,\nplay, and connection with others?\nProbably most of them.\nHow many of them were full of seriousness,\nchores, and routines?\nProbably not many.\nAll the weird quirks that\nmade life joyful as a child\nare still yours to nurture in the present\nif you have a playful attitude.\nWe are not suggesting\nyou neglect your duties,\nbut even these can be turned into games.\nAny task can easily become a\nfun challenge or competition\nif you're awarded points,\nand get rewarded at the end for winning.\nAnd number five, sleep well.\nAfter all the previous tips,\nit's time to close with something simple.\nHave a good night's sleep,\nand you will have a good day.\nScientists recommend\nabout six to seven hours\nof sleep each night.\nAny less, and your mental\nwellbeing will suffer,\neven if you don't realize it.\nSleep deprivation causes stress hormones\nto destabilize your mood,\nblock your problem-solving ability,\nand generally ruin your day.\nIt might be tempting to\nstay up one more hour,\nbut one more hour of sleep\nwill pay off much better.\nDo you think you'll use\nthese habits in your life?\nLet us know in the comments below,\nand don't forget to like\nand share this video\nif you think it will help someone else.\nThe studies and references used\nare listed in the description below.\nUntil next time, friends, take care,\nand thanks for watching."
