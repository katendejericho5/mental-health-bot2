    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWhen exactly does sadness\nbecome depression?\nBecause these two words are\noften used interchangeably,\nsome people get confused\nabout their distinction.\nSaying you're depressed is different\nfrom saying you have depression,\nbecause the latter is referring\nto a mental illness, not an emotion.\nWhen you're feeling down\nor have been feeling down for a long time,\nyou might wonder which\none you're experiencing.\nDepression is usually more severe in terms\nof its duration and the extent\nof how it affects your life,\nwhereas sadness is normal\nand may take less time to recover from.\nWith that said,\nthere are some differences\nbetween normal sadness\nand clinical depression,\nand we're going to talk\nabout seven of them now.\nNumber one, you're still able\nto enjoy the simple things.\nDo you still find yourself laughing\nwhile watching your favorite show?\nIf you still have the energy\nto enjoy your hobbies,\nyou're most likely going\nthrough normal's sadness,\nnot clinical depression.\nPeople diagnosed with\ndepression often find themselves\nwith an overwhelming feeling of liturgy,\nand may have no interest\nin doing things that once\nbrought them happiness.\nThis numbness can extend for long periods,\nwhich is different from normal sadness.\nNumber two,\nyou have enough energy to\ncomplete your daily tasks.\nAre you still eating all of your meals?\nDo you have any difficulty sleeping?\nDepression often comes\nwith an inability to\ncomplete regular activities\nbecause you lack the energy\nand don't see the purpose\nwhile you're unhappy.\nEven simple things like going\nto the bathroom can seem tiring to you.\nDepressed people often stay in their beds,\nlosing track of time with\na feeling of numbness.\nA sad person may be more\nsilent and inactive than usual,\nbut once the needs arise, they eat,\nuse the bathroom and\ntake care of themselves.\nNumber three, you still talk\nto your friends and loved ones.\nDo you open up to your\nfriends or rant or cry\nabout what's been going on?\nPeople with depression may be\nunable to perform these acts,\nas depression can stem\nfrom nothing at all.\nA person may live a completely normal life\nand suddenly find themselves\nexperiencing sudden feelings\nof numbness and hopelessness.\nBecause of that, some people\nchoose not to open up at all,\nwhich may prevent them\nfrom reaching out for help\nbecause they may feel that\nthey're not worth the effort.\nThis is different from normal sadness\nbecause you still welcome\nyour relationships.\nWhen you're sad, you\nmay wanna take a break\nand isolate yourself for a little while,\nbut eventually, you usually\nget back to socializing.\nNumber four, your self-esteem\nis not permanently affected.\nIt's normal for sad people\nto have negative feelings\nabout themselves and the\nthings that are troubling them.\nEmotions such as remorse,\nregret and hopelessness\nare common when you've\nexperienced an unfortunate event,\nbut they tend to fade over time,\nespecially when you know the root\nof the problem and are working on it.\nThis differs from depressed people\nwho are caught in a\ncontinuous loop of negativity\nwhich can extend to thoughts\nand acts of self harm\nor even suicide.\nBeing able to recover\nfrom a bad experience\nis a good indicator of your mental health.\nIf you know someone who harbors\ncontinuous negative\nthoughts, you can help them\nby letting them know that\nyou're available to help.\nThey may not wanna talk just us yet,\nbut your presence is just as important.\nNumber five, you're experiencing burnout.\nDo you find that being\nwith your friends no longer\nmakes you happy as it used to?\nEven though nothing's changed\nor maybe you find it difficult\nto maintain the routine you've created\nfor yourself through\nweeks, months, or years.\nEverybody needs a timeout,\notherwise they're at risk of\nburnout, which is characterized\nby feelings of energy\ndepletion or exhaustion caused\nby prolonged stress and can\nbe mistaken for depression.\nWith burnout,\nyou may find yourself unable\nto complete your tasks due\nto increased mental distance from them,\nor no energy because you're unable to cope\nwith the stress you've been\nenduring for a long time.\nIf you can relate, it might be a good idea\nto practice a good work life balance.\nTry to give time\nto every aspect of your\nlife to avoid burnout.\nYou can schedule activities\nsuch as taking an overnight\ntrip with your friends,\ngoing on a blind date, or even going\nto that dancing class you've been eyeing.\nKeep active and explore many\nthings to avoid stagnation.\nAnd if that doesn't work after some time,\na visit to a therapist\nor doctor might help.\nNumber six,\nyou feel better after letting it out.\nDo you feel lighter after a good cry?\nFeeling better after\nletting your emotions out\nis a good indicator that\nyou're sad, not depressed,\nbecause clinically depressed\npeople often don't see\nthe point in opening up about\nwhat they're experiencing,\nand tend to see themselves\nas worthless and undeserving\nof attention.\nBecause of this, their relationships,\nfriendships and careers could be at risk.\nAccording to Chocolate, talking\nabout your feelings is important\nbecause it helps you\nprocess your emotions,\ndevelop emotional awareness,\nand clear your mind.\nSo it's better to let your emotions out\nthan to keep them in.\nThat's why it's really\nhelpful to be surrounded\nby trustworthy and understanding friends.\nAnd number seven, time heals you.\nAfter a few weeks or even months,\ndo you still find yourself\nexperiencing the same situation\nor are you slowly forgetting about it?\nBeing able to bounce back is an indicator\nthat what you were\nexperiencing is normal sadness,\nnot depression.\nDepression is much more severe in terms\nof the extent of the symptoms\nand of how these symptoms\nimpair the person's life.\nAnd doctors will look for symptoms\nthat last at least two\nweeks as possible signs\nof depression.\nIt can last for months or years,\nand is more difficult to recover\nfrom than normal sadness.\nSo whenever you're sad,\ntake your time to\nacknowledge your sadness,\ntry to find healthy coping\nmechanisms, and surround yourself\nwith loving and supportive\nfriends and family.\nCan you relate to any of these points?\nPlease share your replies\nin the comments below.\nAs always, the references\nand studies used are in the description.\nUntil next time friends, take\ncare and thanks for watching."
