    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers, welcome back.\nAnd thank you so much for your support.\nDo you think everyone who\nis depressed acts the same?\nDepression is a serious medical illness\nthat can last for a long periods of time\nand negatively affect how you feel,\nthe way you think, and how you act.\nIt can cause you to hold on\nto negative thought patterns,\nwhich lead to habits\nthat can worsen your\noverall mood and well-being.\nSo to help you become more aware\nof how your depression can worsen,\nhere are sick signs your\ndepression is getting worse.\nNumber one, extreme loneliness.\nHow often do you feel lonely?\nWhile it's normal for\neveryone to feel lonely\nonce in a while,\nit can be a sign that your\ndepression is getting worse\nif you notice this feeling\nresurfacing more and more often.\nOn top of this, you may also\nbe overcome with a feeling\nof irreversibility that\ncomes with this loneliness.\nYou might feel that getting too close\nto anyone in the future is\nboth hopeless and impossible.\nIn the end, this type of loneliness caused\nby a worsening depression\ncan lead to a desire\nto further isolate yourself from others.\nNumber two, you're not sleeping.\nHave you noticed changes in\nyour sleep quantity and quality?\nChanges in your sleep\npattern can be an indicator\nof worsening depression.\nThis includes both insomnia\nand excessive sleeping.\nDepression can affect\nyour sleeping patterns\nbecause of the impact that\nit has on your energy levels\nand overall mood.\nThe cycle of having a lack of sleep\nand worsening depression is\nextremely difficult to break\nbecause of the self-perpetuating effect\nthese two behaviors have.\nAs reported by the Sleep Foundation,\nit can end up taking a heavy toll\non your overall well-being,\nmaking it one of the\nbiggest signs to look for\nwhen diagnosing worsening depression.\nNumber three, social withdrawal.\nWhen was the last time\nyou enjoyed some time\nwith your family or friends?\nWhen depression gets worse,\nyou may find it more and more challenging\nto enjoy socializing with others.\nAs we've mentioned, depression\ncan be very hard to deal with\nbecause of how each of\nthe symptoms can feed off\nof other symptoms.\nSocial withdrawal is caused and promoted\nby other symptoms of depression,\nincluding low energy levels,\nemotional numbness, and feelings\nof guilt and worthlessness.\nSo while it's okay and quite\nnormal to spend time alone,\nit's also important to\nunderstand the difference\nbetween being alone and feeling lonely,\nas the latter can very easily\nnegatively impact your mood\nand worsen your depression.\nNumber four, feelings of\nguilt and worthlessness.\nDo you often think about the past\nand the choices you've made back then?\nSince depression can make it hard\nfor you to see the\npositives about yourself,\nyour self-esteem may end\nup taking a huge dip.\nIn these moments,\nyou might find yourself\nconstantly thinking about the past\nand ruminating over situations\nwhere you made a mistake\nor were in the wrong.\nThis type of thinking can end\nup worsening your feelings\nof guilt and worthlessness,\nwhich can lead to habits\nof social withdrawal\nand create a difficult cycle\nthat negatively impacts your depression.\nNumber five, you feel numb.\nHave you recently lost interest in things\nthat you used to enjoy?\nPsychology today reports\nthat this can be attributed\nto worsening depression,\nas it's known to not only\nintensify negative emotions\nbut also make you feel\nnumb about the things\nthat you used to love.\nThis feeling of numbness\ncan make it very difficult\nto find any motivation to\ndo things like exercise,\nsocialize, or any other activity\nthat you may have enjoyed in the past.\nAdditionally, it may\nalso make it difficult\nto find the energy to do essential tasks,\nsuch as cooking meals or working.\nAnd number six,\nyour eating patterns\nhave changed drastically.\nHave you been overeating lately\nor perhaps you've lost\nyour appetite altogether?\nA drastic change in eating patterns\nmight suggest worsening depression.\nAccording to Susan Albers, PsyD,\na clinical psychologist\nat the Cleveland Clinic,\npeople who are suffering\nfrom worsening depression\nwill either turn to food\nto try to lift their mood up\nand cope with difficult feelings\nor be to exhausted to prepare\na meal for themselves and eat.\nBoth situations can lead\nto poor eating habits,\nwhich may heavily impact your mood\nand create a negative cycle\nthat fuels your depression.\nAlbers recommends\nconnecting with other people\nto avoid isolating too much,\nas others may be able to help support you\nand help you break out of these cycles.\nSo did you find
