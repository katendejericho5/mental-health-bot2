    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Dark empaths are not empaths.\nIt sounds self contradictory, right?\nBut what that means is that dark empaths\nare people who have a high\nlevel of cognitive empathy only,\nnot emotional empathy or\ncompassionate empathy.\nThey're able to understand\nsomeone's emotions well\nand put themselves in\nother people's shoes.\nYet, they don't possess the ability\nto provide wholehearted concern\nthe way full empaths do.\nThis is because despite the fact\nthat they are high in empathy,\nthey're also high in the\ndark traits of narcissism,\npsychopathy, and machiavellianism.\nOne might mistake them as psychopaths\nbecause of their similarities.\nBut here are five ways dark empaths\nare actually quite\ndifferent from psychopaths.\nNumber one.\nDark empaths show emotions\nwhile psychopaths lack them.\nHave you ever met someone\nwho seemed nice to you,\nbut later on displayed\nmanipulative behaviors?\nDid their kindness ever seem scripted?\nPsychopathy is generally characterized\nby features such as an incapacity for love\nand a lack of remorse or shame.\nThis is different from dark\nempaths who do show emotions\nno matter how fake they may seem.\nDark empaths know where to\ntake advantage of you best\nand that is through your feelings.\nThey know exactly what face\nto put on to manipulate you.\nNumber two.\nThey're empathetic while\npsychopaths just don't care.\nPsychopaths chase the\nfeeling of excitement\nwithout caring about whether their actions\nare hurting other people.\nDark empaths, on the other hand,\nare more careful about their actions.\nDo you know someone who always\nseems to say the right words?\nDark empaths can figure out\nyour emotions pretty well.\nIt's the main reason for the\nword empath in their name.\nDue to their high level\nof cognitive empathy,\nthey may even notice things\nyou're hiding from others.\nFor example, they may notice\nthat you're feeling down,\neven when others do not.\nThey may also congratulate\nyou for an accomplishment\nto make you feel good about yourself.\nHowever, they do these\nthings for harmful reasons\nand when they've gotten\nthe results they've wanted,\nthey might begin acting distant.\nSo try to be on the lookout.\nSomeone being inconsistent\nwith their behaviors\nis a telling sign of this.\nNumber three.\nThey're patient.\nWhile psychopaths are impulsive,\ndark empaths know when to strike best.\nThey're different from psychopaths\nwho often make decisions on a whim.\nThey think about a situation\nto figure out how they can manipulate it\nto their best advantage.\nHave you ever been used\nby someone you trusted?\nDark empaths can spend a long\ntime building a relationship,\njust to end up using it\nfor their own interests.\nThey like to take their time\nbecause they know how important it is\nto make themselves appear\ntrustworthy to others.\nThis is why it helps\nto be wary about people\nwhose kindness seems fake.\nIs someone being nice\nto you all of a sudden?\nAre they love-bombing you\nand spending more time\nwith you than usual?\nIt might be that they\njust wanna be your friend,\nbut if you notice that they\nengage in problematic behaviors,\nsuch as backstabbing,\ngossiping, and the like,\nthey probably won't be\nthe best influence on you.\nNumber four.\nDark empaths are careful while\npsychopaths are reckless.\nPsychopaths lack remorse and\nengage in reckless behaviors\nthat can put another person in peril.\nDark empaths, on the other hand,\ncare about how they look to others\nbecause this is the way they\ncan gain their trustworthiness.\nThey understand social cues, norms,\nand do their best to live\njust like the next person\nso as to avoid any suspicion.\nHowever, they may also be\ninclined to perform behaviors\nsuch as gossiping or bullying.\nAt times, they might even\nresort to physical aggression.\nThis is because even though\ndark empaths are sociable beings\nhigh in empathy,\nthey also have the dark\ntraits of narcissism,\npsychopathy, and machiavellianism.\nAs mentioned, they are\nhigh in cognitive empathy.\nIn short, they read your\nemotions and use them against you\nbecause they don't\npossess the innate concern\nthat full empaths have.\nNumber five.\nThey're extroverted\nwhile psychopaths show\nantisocial behavior.\nWhile psychopathy is not\na diagnosis in itself,\nmany of the characteristics of psychopathy\noverlap with symptoms of\nantisocial personality disorder.\nThey tend to stay away\nfrom social settings\nand instead act out, break rules,\nand perform uninhibited\nactivities by themself.\nDark empaths are the opposite.\nThey're usually found with other people\nbecause that is the\nenvironment they know best.\nThey have a drive towards grandiosity\nand want to receive\nattention continuously.\nThey know exactly when to\ncomfort a person in need\nor be beside someone\nwho's having a hard time.\nAnd with their charisma,\nthey have the tendency to\nmanipulate other people\nor even brew conflict\nbetween relationships\nso they look like the better person.\nDo you know anyone who could\npossibly be a dark empath?\nShare your experiences in\nthe comment section below.\nKeep in mind that if someone\ndoes have these traits,\nthey're not necessarily labeled\na dark empath immediately.\nThis applies to psychopathic traits too.\nJust because someone displays them\ndoesn't mean they're a psychopath.\nThe best thing to do\nis to visit a mental health professional\nif you or someone you know\nis displaying these signs\nin order to get an accurate diagnosis.\nDid this video give you some more insight?\nShare with a friend if you\nthink it could help them.\nDon't forget to leave a like too.\nUntil next time."
