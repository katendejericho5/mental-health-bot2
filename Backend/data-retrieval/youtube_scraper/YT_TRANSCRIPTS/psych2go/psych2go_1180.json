    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWhoever said sticks and\nstones may break my bones,\nbut words will never hurt me\nforgot about emotional wounds.\nEver stop to wonder why that\nforgotten birthday still hurts,\neven though it happened many years ago,\nor why you still stay awake at night\nwondering why someone\nbackstabbed you in high school?\nThose are emotional wounds\nthat have not healed.\nUnlike physical wounds,\nthey aren't visible,\nand we don't have a surefire\nsimple bandaid for it.\nThe good news is that healing these wounds\ntakes a few different tactics\nthat we may not have thought about before.\nSo, let's go through how to recognize\nthat you need that emotional first aid kit\nand how to use it.\nNumber one, being alive, but not living.\nSure, being alive can be\nclinically spelled out\nin cold terms.\nYour heart is beating,\nyou're able to remember your name,\nyou can perform work\nfunctions, you eat food,\nand you sleep at night,\nbut living is different.\nIt's when you follow a passion,\ndo fun things and do anything\noutside the bare necessities.\nMaybe you've lost a loved one,\nand since then, you felt\nundeserving of happiness,\nso you cut yourself off\nfrom all these things.\nAnd before you know it, you\nstart living in survival mode.\nYou're alive, but not really.\nStep back and look at the situation,\nunderstand that you\nhave a right to grieve,\nto be angry, to be hurt.\nConnecting with others\ncan help you understand\nthat living your life is not\ncausing these things to happen.\nYou may, in fact, find\nthat not living your life\nis in fact hurting those around you\nwho are still there for\nyou and care about you.\nNumber two, being disproportionately angry\nor sad or emotional or ugh.\nEmotional wounds are wounds.\nWhen wounds are still tender and raw,\na breath of fresh air can feel like fire.\nYou know yourself, you know\nwhat normally gets to you,\nand when you start getting angry at things\nwhere two seconds later you\nthink, what was that all about,\nwhy did I yell at them,\nthat's a sign of a possible\nwound that needs attending.\nYou might not even be getting\nsomething directed at you.\nYou could be looking\nat random paint colors\nand suddenly you're sobbing.\nYou're not losing your mind.\nIt's your emotions trying to\ncommunicate to you, saying,\nhey, you have some processing to do\nso we can get to healing.\nIt likely means that there's something\nthat hasn't been fully\nacknowledged and dealt with.\nIt may be perceived as embarrassing,\nor you thought you were done with it.\nBut if you're still\nemotionally everywhere,\nperhaps it's time to take a second look\nand acknowledge these emotions.\nNumber three, you can't stop replaying\nthe situation over and over.\nAdmitting the situation and\ntalking about it is good.\nYou have to admit that it's\nthere for it to be healed,\nbut if you keep talking\nabout it without direction\nor purpose and on repeat, it's\ngone from helpful to harmful.\nSo, when talking about the\nsituation or assessing it,\nalways ask yourself,\nwhat am I getting out of talking about it?\nIs there something I\nstill don't understand\nthat will help me move to the next step?\nAnd ask yourself honestly\nif you are repeating things\nbecause you are denying\nwhat you already know but hoping\nto get a different answer.\nThis is not closing a\nwound, it's reopening it\nand undoing all the hard\nwork you've done before.\nNumber four, self-growth stunted by fear.\nPart of living or experiencing life\nis continuing to grow,\nlearn and reach out.\nBeing heard emotionally\ncan make you hyper-aware\nof other intense emotional opportunities.\nFor example, if you were\nin a harmful relationship,\nyou may stop getting into relationships\nwhere you feel deep emotions,\nbut you're robbing yourself\nof the life you deserve\nif you do this.\nYou deserve to learn and grow\ndespite the ups and downs that have come.\nIt's normal to fear the\nunknown and the \"what if,\"\nbut having the courage to\ngrow anyhow is worth it.\nWe're not saying, don't\nfear, because that's inhuman.\nIt's how you deal with it that matters.\nUnderstand your fear and recognize\nthat the bad thing is not the\nonly option that will happen.\nRecall, remember and\nrecognize all the factors\nthat are on your side.\nRealize that these factors exert\njust as strong a force as anything else.\nDo what you need to to give yourself\nthe best chances possible.\nIt could be having a backup plan,\nor it could be a different approach\nfrom the one taken before,\nbut you can do this.\nAnd number five, sleep schedule.\nWhat sleep schedule?\nHave you been losing sleep,\neven when you haven't\nbeen down in caffeine\nor stay-awake meds?\nIf so, something is going on emotionally.\nIronically, getting good\nsleep is one of the things\nthat will assist with healing that wound.\nSo, tackle this by getting yourself\nan honest-to-goodness routine.\nThat's right, sleep prep.\nHere are a few suggestions\nto get you started\nmaking your own personalized routine.\nNo food or electronics one hour\nbefore your goal sleep time.\nMeditate to calm and quiet your mind.\nSip some warm tea with\nnatural calming agents\nlike chamomile.\nSleep helps your whole you recoup.\nPersistence and courage\nare required to heal\nemotional trauma.\nMany of us can agree that emotional trauma\ncuts deeper and last longer\nthan most physical injuries.\nWith something so complex,\nit's easy to feel like we have no choice\nbut to hurt forever, but that's not true.\nIf we can choose to put in\nthe time and the effort,\nwe can choose to heal, and\nwe don't have to do it alone.\nTo navigate this journey,\nit's normal and even encouraged to speak\nto the guidance of a\nseasoned professional.\nYou are worth the time and effort.\nDon't rob yourself of the\nbest life you could live.\nHow do these points resonate with you?\nPlease feel free to comment and discuss\nany methods you've tried or\nthings you're puzzling over.\nThanks so much for watching\nand we'll see you soon."
