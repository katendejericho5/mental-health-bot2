    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you believe in the\nimportance of privacy?\nSome people certainly do.\nAnd if you live a life without it,\nlike many celebrities and public figures,\nit's easy to understand\nwhy it's so important\nto keep some things in\nyour life to yourself.\nAs British author, C.S. Lewis once said,\n\"We live in a world starved for solitude,\nsilence and privacy.\nAnd therefore we are starved\nfor meditation and true friendship.\"\nBecause no matter how much\nwe may want to open up,\nand share our true selves with others,\nthe kind of connection we crave for\ncan only be satisfied\nif we respect our own privacy,\nand be careful about who we let in.\nSo here are seven things\nyou're definitely better\noff keeping private.\nNumber one, your family problems.\nSometimes you are better off keeping\nyour family problems to yourself\nbecause the truth is,\neveryone has them but no one really wants\nto hear about them.\nAnyway, the issues between you,\nand your family stay\nbetween you and your family.\nGetting other people\ninvolved will only stir up\nmore trouble than it's worth.\nSo next time someone\ntries to stick their nose\nin your family's business,\nsimply steer the\nconversation to another topic\nor tell them you prefer\nto keep it private.\nNumber two, your relationship issues.\nJust like how you should\nkeep your family problems\nwithin your family,\nit's better to keep\nyour relationship issues\nwithin your relationship as well.\nComplaining too much\nabout or significant other\nis only going to paint\nthem in a bad light,\nand although your anger,\nand frustration might pass,\nothers might not be so forgiving.\nThey might take you confiding\nyour romantic troubles to them\nto mean that they have a say\nin your relationship, which they don't.\nOf course, if you're having issues\nwith your relationship and need to confide\nin your friends,\nthat's completely understandable.\nNumber three, your income\nor financial situation.\nIt's something of an unspoken social rule,\nthat it's generally considered\nrude to talk about money\nbecause no matter how much you make\nor aren't making,\ntalking about your financial situation\nto other people is bound\nto either make them feel\njealous, uncomfortable,\nor sorry for you.\nComplaining about being broke\nor comparing how much money you make\nwith other people is never a good idea.\nAfter all,\nthere's not much they can do about it\nso what's the point?\nBetter to just keep that between you,\nand your bank account.\nNumber four,\nyour fears and weaknesses.\nTalking about our fears and weaknesses\ntakes us to a very vulnerable place.\nAnd it's a side of us,\nwe shouldn't show to just anyone.\nSome people can be incredibly two-faced,\nand might just make fun\nof you behind your back.\nWhile others might try to manipulate,\nand exploit you when given the chance.\nOthers still might not understand\nor empathize with you,\nwhich is only going to\nmake you feel worse.\nSo before you tell anyone your worries\nor past mistakes,\nyou need to be absolutely sure\nthat they can be trusted.\nNumber five, your dreams and goals.\nIt's probably for the\nbest that you keep most\nof your dreams and goals\nin life to yourself.\nThe more people you share them with,\nthe less motivated\nyou're likely to become.\nWhy?\nBecause people always\nhave something to say.\nAnd if you invite them\ninto the conversation,\nthey might try to fill your mind\nwith criticisms, doubts\nand discourage you,\nespecially if they can't understand\nwhy you want this or that.\nDon't worry too much about that though.\nIt's not for them to understand.\nYour dreams are your own,\nand you deserve to nurture them\nwith the peace of mind\nonly privacy can bring.\nNumbers six, your personal secrets.\nWhile this is something a lot of us learn\nat a young age,\nwe should always be careful\nabout who we choose to divulge\nour personal secrets too.\nDo you really know this person?\nAre you sure they can be trusted\nto keep your secrets,\nand not spread it for gossip\nor use it against you\nnext time you get into a fight?\nIf you're not careful about who you trust,\nit could lead to a lot of embarrassment,\npain and heartbreak for you down the road.\nSo make sure you trust\nwho you share your secrets with.\nAnd number seven.\nother people's secrets.\nSimilar to the previous point.\nIf someone trusts you enough\nto tell you something in confidence,\nthen it simply wouldn't\nbe right to do anything\nto break their trust\nor jeopardize your relationship with them.\nIt might not have been easy for them\nto share that with you,\nand letting other people know about it\nwithout their consent\ncould be very upsetting to them.\nJust imagine how humiliated,\nand betrayed you might feel\nif someone did that to you.\nYou wouldn't wish that for anyone else\nnow would you?\nSo what do you think?\nDo you keep these things to yourself?\nAnd what other things do you think\nare better to keep private?\nIf you have any more tips or suggestions,\nleave them in the comments down below.\nAnd remember, these are not hard rules\nthat you should always stick to.\nEvery situation is different,\nand it's important to talk about\nthings that stress you out\nas long as it's with someone trustworthy."
