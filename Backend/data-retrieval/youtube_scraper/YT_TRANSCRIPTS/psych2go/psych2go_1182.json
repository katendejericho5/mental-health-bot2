    "transcript": "- Well hello there, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back.\nDo you seek change in your life?\nMaybe things have felt\nrather dull or repetitive.\nSometimes change can be good,\nlike living someplace new,\nor taking on a new job or regimen,\nsuch as diet or an exercise plan.\nOther times, not so much.\nChanging your life in six months\ncan seem like a lifetime away.\nWhen you think about how\nlong six months feel.\nHowever, honing aspects\nof the way you chase\nand approach the things\nyou are trying to get\nis a good place to start.\nSo here's how to change\nyour life in six months.\nNumber one, defining your goals.\nHave you ever written down\nthe goals you want to achieve?\nThis may sound like a\nvery obvious first step,\nbut in a study conducted by Mark Murphy,\nit has been shown by neuroscientists\nthat by writing down your own goals,\nyou become more easily\ncapable of visualizing them,\nand thus more likely to retain\nand remember why you're doing something.\nNow, it's not possible to always have\na pen and paper lying around,\nor maybe you don't feel as\nthough you want to go find it.\nBut as you are seeing this,\nsee if you can find a pen and paper,\nor open up notes in your device,\nand write down what exactly\nit is that you want.\nOne big goal that will\nbe at the very tippy top.\nThis goal should be the biggest thing\nthat sticks out in your mind.\nThe reason you clicked on\nthis video, for example,\nif you wanna be the strongest\nperson in the world,\nyou may write three core steps,\nsuch as exercise every day, eat healthier,\nand find a trainer.\nThese on their own sound very challenging,\nand as though they may\ntake a lot of time, money,\nand effort to achieve.\nBreak 'em down a bit further.\nFor exercise every day,\nyou may make sub bullets such as,\nGoogle a good gym,\nfive crunches in the\nmorning and five at night,\nand borrow weights from a friend.\nNow write a few steps about\nhow you have to get there.\nStart with three steps.\nMake sure that these even smaller goals\nare the absolute tiniest\nsteps that you can start\nas soon as possible.\nThis may assist your\nbrain in visualizing steps\nthat are attainable,\nrather than picturing\nthem as so outta the blue\nthat they're impossible, and\nbringing them down to earth.\nYou will notice that\nwhen you break your ultimate\ngoal down into pieces,\nit gives you a starting\nplace for you to begin.\nNumber two, starting small yet forgiving.\n\"This is the time that it'll be different.\nI'm going to do it perfectly.\"\nIf you find yourself\nstriving for perfection,\ntelling yourself this can sometimes be\na detriment to your success,\neven before you start.\nOuch.\nIf you've ever started a new\nyear's resolution before,\nor known someone who has,\nburnout or fatigue can be unforgiving,\nleaving you to feel as though\nif you fall through with your promise,\nthen the entire thing is ruined.\nMaybe you're starting a new diet.\nYet you slip up once and\nfigure that you may as well\nthrow the whole thing away.\nSticking to a plan doesn't mean\ndoing the plan perfectly each time.\nKnowing your own limits\nand what you're likely\nand not likely to do\ncan help you decide for yourself.\nLet's say that you wanna wake up early.\nIt won't be very helpful\nif you set your alarm clock\nfor six in the morning,\ndespite having slept at\nmidnight the day before.\nInstead, try to be more\nunderstanding of yourself\nin the same way you would understand\na family member or friend.\nSetting an alarm for 7:50 in the morning\nmay not seem like a grand\nchange that you were expecting,\nbut the longer you wake up at 7:50,\nthe more you can inch the time back\nonce your new wake up time becomes 7:50.\nIt's 10 more minutes of success\nversus waking up at 8 a.m. dissatisfied\nthat you weren't able\nto follow your goals.\nProgress is progress.\nBe gentle with yourself.\nNumber three, celebrate your growth.\nUnderstand your hiccups.\nAll the success that you make\nshould be celebrated, right?\nBy designating a specific\nday to review your progress,\nhelps you reflect on the\nprogress you've made.\nYou will notice your daily or weekly tasks\nare turning into routines,\nand that you've made a visible change.\nAnd as the mistakes that\nyou made tend to dwindle,\nyou'll feel that you may be\nready for more challenges.\nTricking your brain into\nthinking very difficult tasks\nare part of your everyday life,\nyou are actively increasing\nthe amount of change\nthat you can introduce into your life.\nYou may find that you've\nbeen doing exercises\nfor 20 minutes instead\nof the five you promised.\nIf you notice that it's something\nthat you're able to keep up,\nthen relish in your success!\nOn the flip side, if\nyou have found yourself\nskipping daily habits\nor steps every so often,\nanalyze why they aren't quite working.\nBe honest with yourself.\nIs it too boring? Too hard?\nYou don't understand it?\nOr just don't have time.\nThe answers will help\nyou to adjust these goals\nto make them fit better for you.\nOnce the six month period has passed,\nyou will notice that instead\nof having only a few weeks\nor month of rigorous progress,\nonly for it to stop\nshort in disappointment,\nyou're making steady progress\nto a goal that you formulated, nurtured,\nand worked for all by yourself.\nWhat are some of your goals\nthat you're going to be working towards\nover the next six months?\nFeel free to leave a comment down below\nwith your thoughts,\nexperiences, or suggestions.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like button\nand share it with others\nwho need to hear this.\nDon't forget to subscribe to Psych2Go,\nand hit the notification\nbell for more new videos.\nThanks for watching!"
