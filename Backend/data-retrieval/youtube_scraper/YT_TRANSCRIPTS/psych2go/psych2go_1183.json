    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Do you often\ndream about success?\nWhat do you see in those dreams?\nPerhaps it's having lots\nof money, luxury cars,\nand a good career.\nYou might even look at someone successful\nand wish you could just\nswitch places with them,\nthinking that they have it all.\nBut take a closer look and you might find\nthat things are not as they seem.\nSuccess can come at a great price.\nSo in this video, we will be looking\nat the dark side of success.\nNumber one, loneliness.\nSometimes when you just\nfocus on chasing success,\nyou may end up finding\nyourself alienated and alone.\nWhile your friends and\nfamily are having lunches\nand dinners together, you may be working\non an assignment or a report.\nWhen they're off going on\ntrips or to the movies,\nyou may be working\novertime to meet deadlines.\nUltimately, when you pour\nall of your time and energy\ninto work, you may miss\nout on building connections\nwith the people around you.\nIn time, you may even find\nthat you don't have many people\nto turn to when things get hard.\nSo no matter how mesmerizing it sounds\nto be ultra successful, keep in mind\nthat it could end up being\na pretty lonely time.\nNumber two, greed.\nHow much money is enough?\nStaying humble when you\nare becoming successful\nis a challenging job.\nOver time, greed can take over\nand you may find yourself not\ngetting enough of everything,\nwhether it's achievements,\nmoney, or praise.\nThis might sound like persistence,\nbut chasing more than you\nneed can make you fall\ninto that dark hole of success.\nSlowly you may even come to realize\nyou don't like the person you've become.\nWorst of all,\nyou might realize that you're\nchasing the impossible,\nbecause no matter how far you\nget, it would never be enough.\nNumber three, anxiety.\nWhen you finally become successful,\nwhat do you think becomes your worst fear?\nIt's probably to fail and lose it all.\nBecause of this, your days\nand nights might be overflowed\nwith worries about the future.\nWhat will tomorrow look like?\nWhat should I do to guarantee my success?\nHow can I secure what I have even more?\nThoughts like these can\nmake your mind anxious,\nsometimes to the point\nof developing symptoms\nof an anxiety disorder.\nSleepless nights, heavy\nbreathing, and racing thoughts.\nFor many, it comes hand\nin hand with success.\nNumber four, envy.\nWhen you are dreaming of success,\nhow do you imagine people\nclose to you would react?\nYou probably think your friends\nand family would be proud\nand happy for you,\nand the ones you don't know\nso well may be impressed\nby your hard work and achievements.\nEven though that scenario is possible,\nmany successful people don't\nget such nice reactions.\nWhat they're often faced with is envy.\nThis can mean people\ntalking behind your back,\nsaying how you didn't\nreally deserve what you have\nor that you got it by pure luck.\nThey might try to turn\nmore people against you\nor even sabotage your efforts.\nSo it's not all glamorous.\nNumber five, jealousy.\nEnvy and jealousy can go both ways.\nWhile there might be people\nwho are jealous of you,\nyou could also become jealous\nof other even more successful people.\nAs a result, you may come to see everyone\nas an enemy or threat to your success.\nThis tendency to compare\nyourself with others\nand to feel as if you've come up short\ncan end up making you a\nbitter and angry person,\nwhich may ultimately cause\nothers to dislike and avoid you.\nAnd number six, physical issues.\nFinally, apart from emotional problems,\nsuccess could bring you\nphysical issues too.\nRestless nights and constant worrying\ncan make you more prone to insomnia.\nConstant stress and anxiety\nfrom work may also lead\nto a loss of appetite,\nhabits of overeating, digestive problems,\nand even a change in appearance,\nsuch as getting wrinkles or\ngray hair a little bit too soon.\nAre you willing to pay\nthe price for success?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references and studies\nused in this video are added\nin the description below.\nThanks for watching, and\nsee you in the next video."
