    "transcript": "- [Amanda] How can you tell\nif someone is intelligent?\nInitially, we think it's the person\nwho claims to be so.\nIronically, the less\nintelligent are more inclined\nto loudly and boastfully proclaim\ntheir perceived intelligence,\nwhich is usually overestimated,\nwhile the truly intelligent\ntrend towards acting and believing\nthey are no smarter than the next person.\nThat's right.\nThis is not a fake-it-till-you-make-it\napplicable scenario.\nOne of the factors\nthat makes intelligence\ndifficult to measure\nis that the true intelligence\nisn't simply a test result.\nEven IQ scores were not very well-regarded\nby some irrefutable geniuses,\nlike the late Stephen Hawking,\nwho gave a less than\ncomplimentary assessment\nof those who boast about IQ scores.\nSo, we've collected a\nfew non-test score traits\nthat could reveal the\nbrilliance within you.\nNumber one, open-mindedness and curiosity.\nSocrates, a historically\nintelligent person, said,\n\"I know that I know nothing.\"\nThis simply is a statement that reminds us\nthat we do not and cannot know\neverything there is to know.\nThere is always something to learn\nand open-minded people relish in that.\nThese lifelong learners don't fear\nand shut out unfamiliar concepts.\nRather, they explore them,\nintrigued by the new knowledge\nthat could be gained.\nThey want to understand something in-depth\nbefore forming an opinion,\nrather than making a snap judgment.\nNumber two, an ability\nto acknowledge fault.\nPart of intelligence is knowing more.\nIf you have a person who insists\nthat they're always right,\nthey're cutting off any possibility\nof receiving new knowledge,\nas intelligent people\ndon't tie their self-worth to a reputation\nor a created persona.\nBeing wrong doesn't shatter them,\nbut opens up an opportunity\nto expand their well of knowledge.\nThey also don't feel shame\nor inferior when apologizing\nbecause they understand that\neven if a mistake was made,\nthey don't become less\nvaluable as a person.\nBy admitting fault,\nthey're signaling that they\nare ready to improve themselves\nby learning how to be less wrong.\nNumber three, a strong self-identity.\nKnow thyself?\nIntelligent people do.\nDoes this mean that they override\nand force others to the my\nway or the highway method?\nNo.\nNo, they do not.\nThey simply know who they are\nand will do things their way\ndespite any peer pressure or TikTok trend\nthat might be telling them otherwise.\nTapped into their own psyche,\nthey are more self-aware than most.\nThis means that they not only know,\nbut accept all sides of themselves:\ngood, bad, and in between.\nThis knowledge allows them\nto give their best to others\nand work on their weaknesses\nwithout collapsing.\nNumber four, being witty and sarcastic...\nto a point, of course.\nThe stats don't lie,\nand they say that humor and\nintelligence go hand in hand.\nA recent study in Austria\nfound just such a correlation\nand argued that to get\nthe joke and to tell one,\nit requires both cognitive\nsmarts and emotional ability.\nYou know how the success of comedy\nis timing, timing, timing?\nWell, intelligent people have been found\nto have higher verbal and\nnon-verbal intelligence.\nSo they've got delivery on lock.\nNumber five, being sensitive\nto other people's feelings.\nIQ gets all the recognition,\nbut EQ, the emotional\nquotient, is just as important.\nHaving a solid, well-developed EQ\nallows you to be less overwhelmed,\nso you have the capacity\nand willingness to\nunderstand those around you.\nIt means being able to\nhave compassion for others\nand look through their eyes.\nThis also means you could\nrealize you messed up, not them.\nHowever, because you're\ngood with yourself,\nyou have the wherewithal\nto learn from and improve the situation.\nHaving a high IQ alone,\nhaving all the knowledge and facts\nbut no heartfelt perspective,\ncan be an isolating trait.\nAs they say, \"No man is an island,\"\nand the smart thing to do\nis to be able to connect with\nothers, at least a little.\nNumber six, taking power naps.\nAha!\nSo that time in kindergarten\nwas well-spent after all.\nDon't believe us?\nThen, believe Patrick Jane\nfrom the show \"The Mentalist.\"\nHe's a modern-day Sherlock\nand resident's smartest person in the room\nwho solved nine impossible\nmysteries weekly.\nHe also made time to nap and\nrecharge that precious brain.\nNo, we aren't claiming\nthe value of power naps\nbased solely on how it happens on TV.\nThe General Psychiatry Online Journal\nhas findings that afternoon napping\nwas linked to better mental agility,\nbetter locational awareness,\nverbal fluency, and working memory.\nIf only we could implement power naps\ninto workplaces everywhere.\nAlthough we can't take impromptu\nwork naps like Mr. Jane,\nthis doesn't negate the fact\nthat these power naps are\nlike nourishing brain snacks,\nrecharging them to take on the world.\nAnd number seven, high creativity levels.\nCreativity.\nIt's not just for artists.\nIt simply means being able\nto think outside a usual perspective,\nyour own societal expectations,\neven the one given by a group of friends.\nSo, yes, that friend who figured out\nthe rubber chicken and\nthe pulley go together\nto make a zip line handle is\nlikely pretty intelligent.\nCreativity lets a person\nexcel at problem-solving\nbecause they're willing to\ngo beyond their comfort zone.\nThey have ideas and solutions\nnot thought of by anyone else.\nThey can then make their vision\na reality using knowledge,\ngood observation skills, and curiosity.\nWith what we've observed and experienced,\nit's safe to say that\nsimply getting a high score\non a paper test\nis not the full scope of what the concept\nof intelligence is.\nIt's like an umbrella\nthat covers numerous different aspects,\nallowing different\nvarieties of intelligence.\nAt the root of it all,\nknowing who you are and\ncontinuously learning\nwhile still being a positive\nforce to those around you\nis the best, truest way to be intelligent.\nNo faking needed.\nDid you pick up on any of these signs\nor do you recognize them in others?\nPlease feel free to comment and discuss.\nWe also feel it would\nbe highly intelligent\nto give us a like,\nand we'll see you soon."
