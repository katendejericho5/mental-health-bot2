    "transcript": "- [Presenter] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWhen you hear the word\nanxiety, what do you think of?\nPanic attacks? Hyperventilation?\nWell, that's some of it some of the time.\nWhat if I told you that there are habits,\nand I mean habits,\nnot occasional one-off actions,\nthat seem normie and common,\nbut can actually be signs of anxiety.\nCertainly, anxiety isn't\nthe same for everyone,\nbut some symptoms and habits\nare still always present\none way or another.\nLet's take a look.\nNumber one, can't sleep.\nMy brain won't shut up.\nRemember that one time\nwhen the waiter said,\n\"Enjoy your meal,\" and you\nsaid, \"Thanks, you too,\"\nand then you think to yourself,\n\"What if he thinks I'm dumb?\"\nIt's already been a year\nsince this happened,\nbut it still keeps you up at night.\nAll right, breathe.\nYou've got this.\nDo you struggle with falling\nasleep and staying that way?\nIt feels like your mind\nis running endlessly,\nregardless of how quiet things have been.\nThis could be a sign of anxiety,\nespecially if it's been consistent.\nSeeing as the pros recommend\na solid seven to nine hours\nof good sleep per night,\nthis might be an issue.\nNumber two, biting your nails, fidgeting,\nor chewing the ends of your hair,\nor constantly picking\nat any piece of paper you\ncan get your hands on.\nThese all may seem innocuous,\nbut these are all repetitive,\nself-stimulating actions\ndone unconsciously\nfor stress relief.\nAny of us can do something like this\nduring particularly stressful moments,\nbut it can be a budding sign of anxiety\nif you find it happening\npretty much all the time.\nAre those nail buds almost gone,\nor are your fingertips sore\nfrom frequent nibbling?\nMaybe take some moments of self-awareness\nto see if you catch\nyourself biting your nails\nin a not a big deal situation.\nYou might have a habit, and\nit might be caused by anxiety.\nNumber three, creating\ntoo many to-do lists.\nToo much of anything is a bad thing.\nSure, being organized is great.\nLists can help you focus\nand get all the things done,\nbut you knew this was coming.\nWhen your whole life is nothing but lists\nand lists of lists, or\nyou feel restless, uneasy,\nand grouchy if you can't\nmake a list for everything,\nthis is when the too much\nprobably has stepped in.\nThe habit has gone from a good thing\nto a thing that stops you from living,\nand that is something anxiety does too.\nNumber four, did you lock the door?\nBetter check for the 20th time.\nSimilar to the previously mentioned list,\nmaking the double, triple,\nquadruple checking and structured day\ncan be a sign of anxiety.\nIt's a way for those with\nanxiety to feel more in control.\nJust like before, though,\ntoo much of a thing.\nThorough check and a once-over, great.\nObsessive checking that\ninterrupts your whole day\nand you can't live life, very\nnot great, not great at all.\nEven worse, no matter\nhow careful a person is,\nno one is 100% all the time.\nSo when something slips through,\ndespite all the checking,\nthe impact can be more\ndevastating than it should be,\nsince the anxious is gripping\nonto their thoroughness\nas their means of\ncontrol over their lives.\nNumber five, avoiding eye contact.\n\"The eyes are the windows\nto the soul,\" they say,\nbut what if you feel like your soul\nhasn't been tidied up in a while\nand it's kind of an embarrassing mess?\nOh, wait. No, maybe you\nwere thinking of our homes.\nWell, same thing really, isn't it?\nAn anxious person feels\nsomewhat exposed all the time,\njust being outside, period,\nletting someone look in\nwith eye contact just amps\nthat feeling of being judged,\nweighed, and measured.\nSo where do the eyes look?\nThey're looking for an escape.\nIf you find yourself planning\nan exit strategy fairly constantly\nand there's not really a\nsolid, tangible reason for it,\nit could be a sign of anxiety.\nNumber six, you apologize\nas a reflex, sorry to say.\nA true apology can take different forms\nand saying sorry isn't always an apology\nin the truest sense.\nIn some cultures, a quick, \"Sorry, sorry,\"\nisn't so much taking\nfault and showing remorse,\nit's more a social courtesy and manners.\nIn this point,\nwe mean that you're actually apologizing,\nthe full meal deal of taking\nblame, feeling remorse,\nand vowing to do better.\nNow, accountability is\na good, mature thing,\nand is a positive trait.\nApologies in this vein\nalso involve humility\nand quite the emotional toll,\nso they don't happen often\nand they're meaningful.\nPeople with anxiety\nalready have a baseline\nof feeling guilty about\nthings they can't control,\nso apologizing only\nlayers on even more guilt\nand exacerbates how\npersonally they take things.\nThey may feel inadequate about themselves,\nso they apologize to\nothers for being that way,\nwhich in turn layers on more guilt.\nIt's like an endless cycle.\nThen number seven,\nrelying on inanimate\nobjects as safety blankets.\nDo you have a Linus Blankie?\nRemember the comic strip\ncartoon Charlie Bbrown\nand his buddy Linus, Linus' blankie?\nYeah, Linus probably had\na bit of anxiety going on.\nNo blankie? All right.\nAny other inanimate,\nnonessential objects\nyou must have with you\nwhen you leave your home,\nplus you feel uneasy without it?\nThat's your blankie.\nIt could even be some\nchewing gum or earphones.\nIf you get an impending sense\nthat it's an omen of failure\nfor the day without this item,\nthis could be anxiety\nwhispering those worries to you.\nHey, you made it through the whole video.\nGo, you.\nWe reiterate that each of these points\nis talking about a habit,\nnot that one-time one,\nand even so, just like\nthe disclaimer said,\ndon't take our word for it alone.\nIf you're concerned, reach\nout to a professional,\nor someone who can guide you to one.\nWe hope that some\nof these info bites helped\nyou understand yourself\nor others better.\nDo you recognize any of them?\nFeel free to like, share,\nor comment if the\ninformation helps you chill.\nStick around for another\nvideo. Thanks for watching."
