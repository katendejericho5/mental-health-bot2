    "transcript": "- Hey, friends.\nWelcome back to another video.\nHave you ever wondered, are\nhumans inherently good or evil?\nAre we born altruistic saints\nwho are temporarily\ncorrupted by bad influences\nor are we born selfish sinners\nwho need taming by society?\nThe debate over human nature\nis probably as old as humanity itself.\nWhat does psychology\nsay about this question?\nHere are some studies that shed light\non whether humans are\ninherently good or evil.\nLet's begin.\nWe hurt others when ordered to,\nbut we'd rather hurt ourselves instead.\nImagine this,\nan experimenter tells\nyou that you're a teacher\ngiving a memory test\nto another participant\nwho is a learner.\nEvery time the learner\ngets an answer wrong,\nyou have to give them an electric shock\nof increasing voltage,\neven up to a fatal level.\nHow much would you hurt the other person?\nYale University psychologist,\nStanley Milgram,\ntried this experiment to\ntest obedience to authority,\nwhere the learner was really an actor\npretending to scream in\npain and plead from mercy.\nHe was shocked, pun intended,\nto find that 65% of\nparticipants went all the way\nto a fatal voltage when ordered to.\nMilgram's classic study has\nbeen often cited as proof\nthat humans are quite\nready to hurt others.\nHowever, Milgram's study\nhas been questioned\nby psychologists who have\ndone their own investigations\nand found other results.\nIn a 2014 study by\nUniversity College London,\nparticipants got cash rewards\nfor increasing the electric shock,\neither for themselves or\nfor the other participant.\nThe result were more positive\nthan Milgram's original study.\nAs participants were much more willing\nto shock themselves for extra\nmoney than shock the stranger,\nsuggesting that we still\nplace a large value\non the wellbeing of others.\nPoint two, children enjoy\nthe misfortunes of others,\nbut they also sympathize with them.\nIf you wanna see the\nnatural state of humanity,\nlook at young children.\nThey're all innocent little angels\nuncorrupted by society, right?\nWell, you may wanna think again.\nA study published\nin the \"British Journal of\nDevelopmental Psychology\"\nshowed that even four-year-olds\nexperience schadenfreude,\nthe pleasure of witnessing\nthe misfortunes of others.\nChildren judged stories of\ncharacters falling out of trees\nor into muddy puddles to\nbe entertaining and funny.\nEspecially if the children thought\nthe characters deserved it.\nA similar study published\nin \"Nature Human Behavior\"\nshowed that preschoolers\nwould rather pay to watch\nantisocial puppets being hit,\nthan spend the money on stickers.\nSadly, psychology has demonstrated\nthat even from a young age,\nhumans possess an innate\nsense of ruthlessness\nand punishment.\nHowever, psychology has also found\na natural sense of\nsympathy in young children.\nIn the previous study, the\nchildren judging the stories\nmay have felt pleasure\nabout the bad characters\nexperiencing misfortunes,\nbut they also felt sorry\nfor them at the same time.\nEven when it comes to sharing,\nyoung children go out of\ntheir way to achieve justice,\nand address misfortunes.\nIn one study published\nin the \"Journal of\nExperimental Child Psychology,\"\npaired two-year-olds were\ngiven a set of marbles\nto play with.\nIn most cases, the toddlers\nspontaneously divided\nthe marbles between themselves.\nIn another version,\nthe toddlers were each assigned\nunequal numbers of marbles.\nIn a third of the trials,\nthe more fortunate toddler gave marbles\nto the less fortunate\ntoddler without prompting,\nshowing we have the built-in capacity\nto respond to misfortunes.\nCase three.\nWe blame other people for their suffering,\nbut we help them anyway.\nDo you believe that everyone\ngets what they deserve?\nWe commonly hear that what\ngoes around comes around,\nor that successful people have worked hard\nto get where they are.\nPsychology has shown that we\ntend to believe in a just world\nwhere justice generally prevails,\nand people are eventually compensated\nfor fortunes and misfortunes.\nBut this also means that\nwe're prone to thinking\nthat the unfortunate\nmust have done something\nto deserve their fate.\nWhen study participants are asked\nto explain why there are\npoor people, rape victims,\naids patients, cancer\npatients, quadriplegics,\nand traffic accident survivors,\nthey twist facts or invent reasons\nthat people cause their\nmisfortunes themselves,\nrather than just being victims.\nResearch suggests that\nwe cling to this belief\nas a coping mechanism, even\nat the expense of others.\nHowever, research also says\nwe are predisposed to trust\nand help other people by default.\nIn a lab experiment, participants\nwere given some money,\nand they could choose how much\nto keep in a private fund,\nor contribute to a common fund\nthat was distributed\namong other participants.\nEven though the participants\nwere all anonymous,\nand the ideal strategy is\nto distrust everyone else,\nand keep everything yourself,\npeople consistently\nput most of their money\ninto the common fund.\nThe authors call this instinct.\nStrong reciprocity,\nwhere we help people\ndespite not knowing them,\nand not expecting anything in return.\nSo, there you have it.\nStudies show humans\nare both evil and good.\nSorry, there are no straightforward\nanswers in psychology.\nWhat do you think?\nLet us know in the comments below\nand don't forget to like\nand share this article\nif you think it'll help someone else.\nThe studies and references used\nare listed in the description below.\nUntil next time, take care\nand thanks for watching."
