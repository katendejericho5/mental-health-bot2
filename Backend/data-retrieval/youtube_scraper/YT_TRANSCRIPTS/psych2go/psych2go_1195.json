    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nIt's no secret that navigating\nlove and relationships\ncan certainly be a tricky business,\nbut with the help of psychology,\nwe can tell a lot about how to decipher\na person's words and actions\nto uncover their true feelings,\nand love is no exception to this.\nSo if you are someone who's been worried\nor wanna know your\npartner's true intentions,\nthen put your mind at ease\nby learning more about whether\nsomeone is genuine or not.\nNumber one, they're only\naffectionate in public.\nThink about how your\npartner shows you affection,\nbe it through a touch, a kiss, or a hug.\nNow think about when they like to do this.\nIs it usually when you're\nalone or with other people?\nWhile it's certainly\nnice to be with someone\nwho isn't afraid to display\ntheir love for you in public,\nit's another thing entirely\nwhen it's done only in public.\nThey might just be doing\nit to keep up appearances\nthat everything is fine\nin your relationship,\nto keep other men from\nmaking a move on you,\nor to make someone else jealous.\nNumber two, they prefer to\nspend their time with friends.\nDoes your partner spend more time\nwith their friends than with you?\nDo they often cancel plans\nwith you to be with them,\nor prefer to keep you and\ntheir friends separate?\nIf the answer is yes,\nthen this is unfortunately\na very telling sign\nthat while you and your partner\nmight connect romantically,\nthey don't enjoy spending time with you\nas much as with their friends.\nThat shows they might just\nbe pretending to like you.\nNumber three, they don't\nprioritize your relationship.\nIt should go without saying\nthat you should never settle for someone\nwho doesn't make you a priority.\nDoes your partner not make time for you?\nAre they not as dependable\nas you want them to be?\nDo they often break their promises\nor cancel your plans at the last minute?\nDo they act like their life\nis more important than yours?\nNo matter how much they might say\nthey love and care about you,\nit's all just empty words when\nthey can't show up for you\nand be there when you need them.\nNumber four, they don't give\nyou their full attention.\nSimilar to the last point,\neven if your partner finds the time\nto see you and be with you,\nthey're still not giving\nyou their full attention.\nTheir mind might still be at work,\ndistracted by their friend's drama,\nor constantly checking their phone.\nTheir body language could be\nclosed off and disinterested,\nand they might not be\nmaking eye contact for long.\nThey're probably not really listening\nto anything you have to say.\nNumber five, they try to\nchange things about you.\nWhen someone really loves you,\nthey'll accept you for\nthe person you really are,\nflaws and all.\nThat's not to say they would\nwillingly turn a blind eye\nto all of your faults,\nbut they certainly wouldn't\nforce you to change either.\nBut someone who's only\npretending to love you\nwill most likely try to change\nthe things about you they don't like\nso you can better accommodate\ntheir tastes and their preferences,\nwhether it's the way you look,\nwhat you do, or how you act.\nNumber six, they don't open up to you.\nHave you been dating this\nperson for a while now\nand still know nothing about them?\nDo you ever get the feeling\nthere might be a lot of\nthings they keep from you\nor hold back from telling you?\nAchieving emotional intimacy\nis one of the greatest milestones\nwe can have in a relationship,\nso if your partner doesn't\nwant to open up to you\nbut does so with other people,\nthen that's a sign that their\nfeelings may not be genuine.\nNumber seven, they don't\nask for your opinion.\nWhen someone asks for your opinion,\nespecially when it comes to\nmaking important decisions,\nit means that they truly\ncare about what you think\nand care about how their\nactions might affect you.\nThey value your opinion\nand wanna see things\nfrom your point of view\nbecause they respect you\nand view you as an equal.\nAnd number eight, they\ndon't make you feel loved.\nFinally, but perhaps most importantly,\nalways listen to your intuition.\nDoes your gut feeling tell you\nthat something's not right\nin your relationship?\nEven if everything seems\nfine at first glance,\nlisten to that feeling.\nIf your significant other\nisn't making you feel loved,\nif their words don't\nalign with their actions,\nthen it's going to bring about\na lot of confusion and\ninsecurity from you.\nAs bestselling author\nand relationship expert\nCharles Orlando once said,\n\"It's really simple: if they\nlove you, you'll know it.\nAnd if they don't, you'll\nconstantly wonder if they do.\"\nSo, do you relate to any of\nthe signs we've mentioned here?\nDid this help you see more clearly\nhow your partner really feels about you?\nIf you've found yourself in a relationship\nwhere your significant other\nisn't being honest about\ntheir feelings with you,\nthen the best thing for you to do\nwould be to talk to them about it\nand work out how to\nmove forward from there.\nDid you find this video insightful?\nIf so, don't forget to leave a like\nand a comment about your own experiences.\nShare this video with a friend\nif you think it'll help them too.\nAs usual, all references\nused are in the description.\nThat's it for now."
