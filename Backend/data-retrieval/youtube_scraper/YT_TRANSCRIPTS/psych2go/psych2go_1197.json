    "transcript": "- [Narrator] When you think of\na highly intelligent person,\nwhat do you imagine?\nWhatever your answer might be?\nI think we can all agree that\nhighly intelligent people\nare defined by more than just their IQ.\nMany of them share a lot\nof mannerisms and habits.\nThese habits probably\naren't what you think.\nHere are nine of the most common\nbut most surprising and unusual habits,\nhighly intelligent\npeople are known to have,\naccording to psychology.\nNumber one, being messy.\nFirst on the list is a tendency\nto be messy, cluttered,\nand even scatterbrained at times.\nThis might surprise you\nbecause when we think of\nwho is highly intelligent,\nwe tend to picture academic achievers\nwho rank top of their class\nand tend to be organized.\nIn reality however, a lot\nof highly intelligent people\ndon't actually fall into this category.\nThese are the type to most likely be messy\nbecause they tend to\nbe highly creative too.\nThey prefer to conformity\nand generate unique, original ideas.\nNumber two, cursing a lot.\nA lot of highly intelligent\npeople tend to curse a lot.\nNot only that, they're often more creative\nwith their curse words too,\nwhich means they have\nan extensive vocabulary.\nThey also like to think for themselves,\nnot letting in society\ntell them what they should\nand should not do,\nwhat's considered proper\nand what's frowned upon.\nAfter all, what makes\na bad word bad anyway?\nIf you don't have any\nmalicious intent behind it,\nhighly intelligent people\ndon't see anything wrong\nwith cursing, if they see fit.\nNumber three, being a night owl.\nStudies have shown that\nhighly intelligent people\nactually prefer to stay\nup later than most,\nand tend to be night owls\nwho work through the night,\nrather than sleep.\nThey're always up and about tackling\na lot of problems and challenges.\nThey prefer to do this at night,\nwhere they can think\nwith less interruptions\nand be alone with their thoughts.\nNumber four, taking cold showers.\nAnother habit that might surprise you\nabout highly intelligent people\nis that many of them like\nto take long cold showers.\nThough a lot of us like to do\nthe same to clear our heads,\ndid you know that there's actually\na scientific reason for this?\nIt's because cold showers mimic\nthe ancient practice of water therapy,\nwhich is said to benefit\nboth the body and mind\nby pumping fresh blood to our brains,\nand therefore, improving our\nmood, memory, and productivity.\nNumber five, talking to yourself.\nWhile we find it a bit\nembarrassing to admit,\na lot of us actually do have\na habit of talking to ourselves.\nThe difference is,\nhighly intelligent\npeople do it more often.\nOne possible reason why is that,\nthey might be the only\nperson in their life\nwho they can converse with\non an intellectual level.\nOr they just like to express\ntheir thoughts out loud.\nNumber six, criticizing yourself.\nHighly intelligent people tend\nto criticize themselves more\nbecause they might be\nthe only one they know\nwho's intellectually capable\nenough to challenge them.\nIn fact, one of the most\nnotable characteristics\nof a highly intelligent person\nis their humility and self-awareness.\nThey're always willing to\nadmit that they don't know,\nand don't have all the answers.\nThey're not afraid to criticize themselves\nbecause they're always\nopen to learning more\nand broadening their horizons.\nMany highly intelligent people\nalso tend to be perfectionists too.\nNumber seven, doodling a lot.\nHave you ever spaced out\nin class or a meeting\nand just started doodling\non the first piece of\npaper you could find?\nIf you do this often enough,\nit might actually be a sign\nthat you are a highly intelligent person.\nWhy?\nBecause it shows that you\nare not being challenged\nor stimulated enough by mundane activities\nlike classes and meetings,\nand that you are a highly\ncreative, deep thinker.\nNot only that, studies have also shown\nthat doodling improves our\nmemory and problem solving skills\nby allowing our brains to take a break,\nespecially after a prolonged\nperiod of intense focus.\nNumber eight, daydreaming.\nWhile we might associate\na heightened ability\nto focus and concentrate\nwith high intelligence,\nthe same can actually be said for those\nwho daydream a lot too.\nMuch like doodling and\ntalking to yourself,\nmost highly intelligent people\nhave a very rich imagination,\nand use these creative ways to improve\ntheir problem solving skills\nand get the mental stimulation they need.\nDaydreaming helps us to think\nabout things more deeply,\nand many highly\nintelligent people use this\nas a strategy to arrive at a breakthrough,\nor make an important decision in life.\nAnd number nine, wanting to be alone.\nLast but certainly not least,\na large majority of\nhighly intelligent people\ntend to be more reserved\nand less sociable,\nbecause they can get easily\noverwhelmed by lots of people.\nThey might also wanna be lot of the time\nbecause they're fiercely\nindependent personality\nmakes them more focused\non achieving long-term\ngoals and objectives,\nrather than enjoying short-term\nrecreational pleasures\nlike hanging out with their friends.\nSo do you relate to any of the\nthings we've mentioned here?\nDo you think you might be a\nhighly intelligent person too?\nRemember, there are many\ndifferent types of intelligence.\nWe're all talented in our own unique ways.\nDid you find this video valuable?\nTell us in the comments
