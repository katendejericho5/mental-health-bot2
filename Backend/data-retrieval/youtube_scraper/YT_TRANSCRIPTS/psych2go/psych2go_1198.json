    "transcript": "- [Narrator] How do you\nknow if a person likes you\nor if they're just being friendly?\nYou may be getting mixed\nsignals from someone\nand not know what to do about it.\nDoes it mean that they're\nromantically interested in you?\nOr do they just see you as a friend?\nIf this is something you're\nstruggling with, fear not.\nToday, we will be looking at 10 signs\nthat they're just being\nfriendly and not into you.\nNumber one, they don't\nreciprocate your advances.\nAre you always the one\ntrying to engage with them?\nIf you notice that you are\nalways initiating conversations\nor planning for events with them,\nthen you are probably\nstuck in the friend zone.\nSimilarly, if they're not\ngiving you the time you deserve,\nit may mean that you're not\non their list of priorities.\nWhile this may upset you\nor will cause you to do\nsomething uncharacteristic\nto get their attention,\nremember that there is\nnothing wrong with you\njust the way you are.\nNumber two, they get confused\nby the things you're doing.\nHave you ever tried to\nsuddenly ask them out?\nHow did they respond?\nIf they seemed confused,\nmildly uncomfortable,\nor like they didn't care,\nthen they probably see you\nas just another one of their peers.\nAfter all, if they really liked you back,\nthen they'd jump at any\nopportunity to get closer to you.\nSo if they seem confused by your actions,\nmaybe it would be better to\nleave them alone for the moment.\nLet them come to you first,\nand then you engage.\nNumber three, they talk about\nthe people they're seeing.\nDo they open up to you about\ntheir crushes or recent flings?\nThey may do this because\nthey genuinely like you,\nbut just not in a romantic way.\nIt's not easy to constantly be\non the receiving end of them\ntalking about their crushes.\nYou may feel jealous\nor develop a negative outlook on yourself.\nIn this case, it may be best to tell them\nthat you're uncomfortable about the topic\nand would prefer to\ntalk about other things.\nNumber four, they treat you\nlike how they treat their friends.\nFriendships are good\nfoundations for relationships,\nbut what if they're acting too friendly,\nto the point that it's\nnot even romantic anymore?\nBeing attracted to someone\ncomes with a certain pressure.\nYou may find yourself\nintentionally highlighting\nyour attractive qualities\nto gain their attention.\nSo if it seems that they're\ndoing the exact opposite of that\nand are not afraid of showing\nyou their unfiltered selves,\nsuch as by changing in front of you\nor eating with their mouths open,\nthen it's likely that they\nsee you as just a buddy.\nNumber five, when you hang\nout, they bring other people.\nHave you ever been disappointed\nbecause a supposed date\nbecame an all out mingling session?\nWhen you ask them out,\ndo they always arrive\nwith a friend or two?\nWhile you may be frustrated and annoyed\nat what they're doing, it\nmay actually be their way\nof putting boundaries\nbetween the both of you.\nPerhaps they've already\ngotten wind of your feelings\nand are trying to put some\ndistance between you two.\nThey may be bringing other people in\nto act as mediators between you.\nNumber six, they say things\nthat make you second-guess their feelings.\nDid you think that someone was into you\nonly for them to say something\nthat completely wrecked that thought?\nIt's not a secret that\nif someone likes you,\nthey'll probably compliment you a lot.\nBut sometimes you may\nmistake those compliments\nto be something more\nthan they actually are.\nThat's why it helps to\nlearn to accept compliments\nand leave it at that.\nTry not to think further\nabout what it means.\nIf they really like you, they will show\nand do more things to make you know.\nNumber seven, when you\nget teased together,\nthey laugh it off, or deny it fast.\nAre they quick to brush\noff people's comments\nthat tease you both together?\nThey may be doing this\nbecause they're uncomfortable\nwith being teased about\nthings that aren't true.\nPerhaps they just wanna be your friend\nand don't want the little\ncomments bothering you\nevery now and then.\nIt sucks, but it's probably\ntheir way of making sure\nthat there won't be any\ntension between the two of you.\nTry not to take it to heart.\nNumber eight, they ship\nyou with other people.\nDo they seem happy or excited\nto find someone for you?\nWhen they do this, it means\nthat they're satisfied\nwith seeing you being\nromantic with others.\nIf not, they would start\ndisplaying signs of jealousy\nor irritation at the sight\nof you with someone else.\nSo if they're the one leading the quest\nof finding you a partner, then it seems\nlike they just wanna make\nyou happy as a friend.\nAnd if you find it uncomfortable,\nit's best to tell them upfront,\nrather than letting it\nsnowball into a bigger problem\nfor you in the future.\nNumber nine, they ask you for favors.\nHave you ever had your hopes\nup because they messaged you\nonly to find out that it\nwas to ask you for a favor?\nIf they're often asking you\nto pick up something for them,\ngive you the answer for homework,\nor get you to take their shift at work,\nthen chances are they\nprobably only see you\nas a trustworthy friend and nothing else.\nAnd number 10,\nthey ask you to set them\nup with other people.\nHave they ever approached you and told you\nthat your friend was cute\nand asked if you could\nset them up together?\nOnce it reaches this point,\nthey most likely have no\nromantic interest in you\nand aren't aware that you\nhave feelings for them.\nBecause if they did,\nthen asking for this kind of\nfavor would be inappropriate\nand mean.\nAre you feeling
