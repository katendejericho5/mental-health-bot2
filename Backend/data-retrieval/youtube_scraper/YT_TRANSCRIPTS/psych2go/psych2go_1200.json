    "transcript": "- [Narrator] How does\nabuse affect a person?\nIs the road to healing\nas unpaved as it seems?\nThe Social Care Institute for Excellence\nhas ranked multiple forms of abuse,\nincluding physical,\ndomestic, sexual, emotional\nfinancial, discriminatory,\nand organizational abuse.\nHealing for abuse survivors of all kind\nis a highly relative process.\nWhile it is possible to move\ntowards healing the trauma\nto become whole and healthy individuals,\nat times, it may have lingering effects\nthroughout your life experiences\nand you may even blame\nyourself for the way you are.\nAcknowledging all forms of possible abuse\nhelps bring awareness.\nIf you've experienced abuse of any form,\ncheck in with yourself to see\nif you can relate to any\nof the following signs\nof lingering effects due to your trauma.\nNumber one, you have difficulty\nin navigating social situations.\nDo you exercise extreme caution\nin introducing new faces into your life?\nAs an abuse survivor,\nyour basic need for safety\nwas constantly endangered.\nThis conditioned your brain\nto be consistently on\nalert for future dangers.\nYour sudden reactions to\ncertain people or settings\nshow it reminds you of one of the mental\nor emotional abuses\nthat you've experienced.\nUsing body language cues\nis one way to self soothe\nwhen experiencing social\nanxiety due to abuse trauma.\nUsing open body language,\nwhich includes keeping your legs uncrossed\nor maintaining comfortable eye contact,\ncan help communicate your willingness\nto be open with others.\nNumber two, physical health problems.\nDoes your stomach, head,\nor other body pains\nseem to have no identifiable cause?\nMaltreatment or abuse\ncan cause physical health problems too.\nAbuse triggers extreme stress levels,\nwhich causes your immune system\nto be negatively impacted.\nA study concluded that childhood abuse\nimpairs regions of the brain\nrelated to function or growth.\nReaching out for support\ncan help you check in\nwith the aspect of you that\nfelt most hurt due to the abuse.\nNotice if you treat your\nbody, mind, or heart kindly\nand supportively.\nNumber three, body language comprehension.\nHow observant would you call yourself?\nAre you a pro at reading\nthe micro expressions\nflickering across someone's face?\nAs an abuse survivor, you grow\nto become excellent readers\nof body language and nonverbal cues.\nThis skill originates from\nyour need to protect yourself\nfrom a young age.\nYour hypervigilance allowed you\nto identify those who feel safe\nin opposition to those that felt dangerous\nto your wellbeing.\nWhen you're able to read a\nperson, the room, or a situation\nthere's a greater chance of\nfeeling secure in your standings\nand maintaining control\nover your surroundings.\nNumber four, chronic\nanxiety and depression.\nResearch found that abuse survivors\nwere two and a half times more likely\nto have major depression\nand are also more susceptible\nto emotional dysregulation.\nYour tendency to\nself-protect from early on\ncan translate into anxiety later.\nWhile depression may emerge\nfrom a deep sadness\nwithin the abuse survivor,\nyour struggle with mental health\nissues due to abuse trauma\nmay lead to having intrusive thoughts,\nfeeling stuck in a mental loop,\nor not having the motivation\nto complete task throughout your day.\nTheir presence points\ntowards an unlatched wound\nin need of tending,\nwhich might help to dissipate\nfrustration towards yourself.\nNumber five, emotional numbness.\nDo you dread opening up\nto the notion of moving forward\nemotionally and mentally?\nIn your moments of duress,\nyour body's immediate reaction\nwas to protect you from harm\nas much as it possibly could.\nYour mind helped you\ndetach from the experience\nto shield you from going into shock.\nThis represses the trauma\nfrom a conscious view,\nallowing you to continue\nfunctioning normally\neven after experiencing\nthe danger you've endured.\nBut repressed trauma can cause\na multitude of side effects.\nOne of which being emotional numbness.\nWhile it may feel safe\nto detach emotionally,\nhealing and allowing for\nemotions to come through\nis also the key to pushing\nthe negative emotions out.\nIt's okay to feel sad\nabout what happened to you.\nYou have every right to feel that.\nBut you also have every\nright to feel proud\nof how far you've come since then.\nAnd number six, low self-esteem.\nDo you put yourself down first\nto avoid conflict or confrontation?\nIf you can relate, you've likely\nmaintained low self-esteem\nas a result of the trauma\nyou've experienced earlier on.\nAnd you surely aren't at fault\nfor this mistaken understanding of self.\nYou're prone to feeling unworthy,\nundeserving due to the dysfunction\nwithin your early environment.\nSelf-esteem can be greatly\nimpacted by your environment.\nRelabeling upsetting thoughts\nhelps to focus on the positive.\nSpend time with your feel good squad.\nIndeed, the past can't be\nrewritten in physical terms\nbut that doesn't mean you're not allowed\nto rewrite the character\nyou play in your own story.\nAllow yourself to recast\nyourself as your own hero.\nAbuse has an uncanny way\nof blurring one's vision.\nWhat you experienced was never your fault.\nIt can be a difficult task\nto evade its clutches.\nIt can continue to trickle into your life\nin the most reticent ways.\nAbusers are known to use\nmanipulation tactics,\nlike gaslighting, to entrap their victims\nto believe on a subconscious level\nthat they've been at fault\nand have played a role in their trauma.\nThis negatively impacts your sense of self\nand personal growth.\nAnd even while your\nyounger or earlier self\nmay have believed these\nstatements on some level,\nknow that allowed to\nreconsider this thought.\nWhat happened to you was never your fault.\nDo you recognize any of these signs?\nIf so, do you think this video\nhelped you identify them?\nFeel free to leave a comment down below\nwith your thoughts,\nexperiences, or suggestions.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like
