time\non the things you need to do?\nDo you wish that you could produce more\nwithout suffering from burnout?\nWell, you are not alone.\nOur society pushes a culture\nthat promotes limited sleep\nand constant work, which isn't\nhealthy in the long term,\nbut having a flexible routine or schedule\ncan have you achieving your\nmarks, producing quality work,\nwhile minimizing burnout and\ncreating a more balanced life.\nHere are 12 ways to be more productive.\n(gentle piano music)\nNumber one, create a morning routine.\nA morning routine might\nsound counterproductive,\nbecause you might feel inclined\nto just jump right outta bed into action.\nThat's great, but morning routines\nactually help set the tone for your day.\nTry creating one that\nhelps you feel grounded,\nfocused, and can channel your\nenthusiasm into your work.\nMaybe try a healthy breakfast\nafter a good night's sleep,\nand a quick meditation to start.\nNumber two, initiate\nbefore you are inspired.\nWho doesn't love a good\nmotivational quote once in a while?\nThey're inspiring and really\nlight a fire inside of you\nto go out and do that thing.\nBut waiting to start something\nuntil you're motivated\nis not going to help you get motivated.\nYou'll be waiting for a long time.\nIt's better to start and let\nthat inspire you to do more.\nOnce you start, you might not wanna stop,\nbecause you'll be having too much fun.\nNumber three, break\ntasks into smaller ones.\nThe best way to eat an elephant\nis to take one bite at a time.\nYeah, it's odd imagery.\nBut when you think about the\ntasks you have to complete,\nthat you don't wanna do,\nyou feel overwhelmed, because\nit seems like too much.\nIt's easier to complete the task\nwhen you break it down\ninto small, clear tasks.\nYou may even start getting ideas\non how to do more work with\nless stress and effort.\nNumber four, do the most\nimportant task first,\nor the most boring.\nSome tasks are more important than others,\nand some tasks we'd rather not do.\nHowever, once this task is done,\nyou'll feel so much better.\nMark Twain once said,\n\"Eat a live frog first\nthing in the morning,\nand nothing worse will happen\nto you the rest of the day.\"\nWell, the frog is the\nbiggest, most important task\nthat you're most likely\nto procrastinate on\nif you don't work on it early.\nNumber five, don't multitask.\nAs good as you might think you\nare at it, try not to do it.\nYou might be successful with\nlow level tasks like chores,\nbut with tasks that require\nmore mental engagement,\nyou'll tire yourself out faster\nthan focusing on one task.\nA Stanford University study\nfound that multitasking is less productive\nthan doing a single thing at a time.\nThe study also found\nthat people who are regularly bombarded\nwith several streams of\nelectronic information\ncannot pay attention, recall information,\nor switch from one job to another\nas well as those who\ncomplete one task at a time.\nNumber six, limit distractions.\nAnything is more interesting\nwhen you have work to do,\nand you prefer not to do it.\nRandom thoughts and\nerrands pop into your head,\nlike you remember that you\nhave to go do your laundry.\nIt's normal to have distractions,\nbut you don't need to\ntend to them immediately.\nTry keeping a separate\nlist of random things\nthat come to you that\nyou think are important,\nand do them later.\nNumber seven, don't be let down by failure\nand blinded by success.\nWe all fail.\nIt happens all the time.\nWe think that the road to\nsuccess is smoothly paved,\nbut failure is the price you pay for it.\nSuccess is amazing, but it can\nironically make you stagnant\nand comfortable where you are.\nLearn from both failures and success.\nWhat led you to missing your goal,\nand how can you improve next time?\nWhat have you gained from it,\nor what helped you achieve your goal,\nand what can you do next time\nto replicate similar results?\nNumber eight, monitor\nwhere your time goes.\nFrom YouTube to Netflix, to\nvideo games and social media,\nbinges are something a\nlot of us participate in.\nYou can be preoccupied with this activity,\nand then suddenly it's 2:00 a.m.\nA better way to be more productive\nis to limit these binge sessions.\nBe aware of where your\ntime and energy goes\nand how you feel\nwhen you've participated\nin these activities.\nDo you feel energized, depleted, stressed?\nHow do you want to remedy that?\nIf you plan your time, you\ncan complete your tasks\nand still have guilt-free chill sessions.\nNumber nine, take breaks and recharge.\nOnce you get going, it's\nalmost impossible to stop.\nYour newly discovered overachiever\nwill want to do everything\nthat has ever existed,\nbut you will need to slow\ndown and take breaks.\nA great method that\nhelps incorporate breaks,\nlimit procrastination,\nand improve productivity\nis the Pomodoro technique.\nA period of 25 minutes\nof deep focused work\nis followed by a five-minute break.\nIt's very important to\nactually detach from work\nwhen you take breaks.\nMaybe do a few stretches,\ntake a short walk, or do\nsome breathing exercises.\nNumber 10, learn to say no.\nNot only is this habit good\nfor your self confidence\nand establishing authority in your life,\nit's also good for your productivity.\nYou might be tempted or forced to agree\nto doing something\nyou don't actually have the time for\nwhen your productivity\nplate is already full.\nDon't take on something that\nhas nothing to do with you.\nSaying no is a life and time saver.\n11, use the 80/20 rule.\nThe Pareto Principle, or the 80/20 rule\nstates that roughly 80% of\nyour results and outcomes\ncome from 20% of your efforts and methods.\nBasically you need to focus\non 20% of your to-do list\nthat is responsible for 80%\nof the results you need.\nLet's say you're learning\nhow to play guitar.\nInstead of learning\nstrumming or hammer-on,\nconsider learning basic\nchords and transitions.\nThat way, you get 80% of the\nresult in 20% of the time.\nAnd number 12, make fewer decisions.\nMaking decisions can be\nsurprisingly time-consuming,\nand take a lot of brain power.\nA way to solve this\nis to automate and make\nthings easier for you to do\nwithout much thought.\nDon't have enough time to cook every day?\nTry meal prep, or a food delivery service.\nDon't know what to wear?\nLook up capsule wardrobes,\nor try keeping your style\nto minimal similar clothes.\nArtist Andy Warhol was almost always\nin a black polo or turtleneck top.\nYou have many decisions to make.\nDon't let irrelevant decisions\ntake up your extremely valuable time.\nDo you wanna try any of\nthese tips in this video?\nLet us know in the comments\nbelow how you get on.\nAs always, the references and\nstudies used in this video\nare listed in the description below.\nRemember to like and share this video\nwith people who might benefit from it.\nUntil next time, thanks for\nwatching, and take care.\n(gentle piano music)"
