    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Is there someone in your life\nwho's been acting strange lately?\nEveryone's experienced\njealousy at some point,\nwhether it's being envious\nof the best student in class,\nor a friend who's gotten\nmore popular recently.\nIt's a natural feeling you\nare bound to experience.\nHowever, sometimes,\nwhen this feeling grows out of proportion,\nit can often impact\nsomeone's outward behavior\nand interaction with others.\nDoes this remind you of\nsomeone in your life?\nWell, here are seven signs\nsomeone is extremely jealous of you.\nNumber one, they're constantly\ntrying to bring you down.\nHave you ever been excited\nto share your good news with someone\nonly to be faced with a negative reaction?\nPerhaps you told your friend\nthat you've gotten that promotion\nyou've been dreaming of,\nbut they turned it into a bad thing.\nInstead of praising you for\nyour hard work and talent,\nthey may say that it happened\nbecause your boss just favored you more\nor because there was no\nother person to promote.\nAccording to counselor, educator,\nand suicidologist, Araya Baker,\n\"An envious person who\ncan't find legitimate flaws\nin their target\nwill detract from their\ntarget's likability\nor attempt to humble them\nby wielding any criticism.\"\nSo you'll know that\nsomeone is jealous of you\nif they're always going out of their way\nto make you feel guilty, undeserving,\nor invalid of your\naccomplishments and success.\nNumber two, they don't\nrespect your decisions.\nEnvious people have a tendency\nto manipulate those they target\ninto feeling like they're\nmaking the wrong choices.\nWhen in actuality,\nthey're just jealous of\nyou achieving your goals.\nOut of spite, they might gaslight you\ninto feeling like the\npositive situation you're in\nor heading towards\nis actually doing more\nharm to you than good.\nTheir goal is to criticize your judgment,\nfoster your self-doubt, and\ndiminish your self-confidence,\nso that you feel less capable\nof making the right decision.\nIn these moments, it's\nimportant to remind yourself\nthat you know yourself best.\nYou make the calls here.\nNumber three, they avoid\nyou after the good things.\nCan you recall a time\nwhen you shared a piece\nof good news with a friend\nand they didn't respond at all?\nThey may go as far as\nto distance themselves\nor disappear for a few\ndays or months from you.\nAs shared earlier,\nfeelings of envy can\nbe extremely consuming\nas it's a cry for help\nor a need for attention\ndue to insecurity, self-doubt,\nand lack of self-confidence.\nIf someone's been awfully quiet\nsince a recent celebration in your life,\nit's likely that spending time with you\nhas worsened their feelings of inadequacy\nand pain within themselves.\nThis behavior of refusing\nto celebrate your success\nis not a reflection of you,\nbut rather how they feel\nabout themselves internally.\nNumber four, they're always\nattempting to one-up you.\nHave you ever shared\npositive news with someone\nand they responded by sharing\nsomething bigger and better\nto try to outdo what you've\ngot going on in life?\nIf you got a new car, they may mention\nthat they also got the latest\nmodel of the same thing.\nIf you get a raise,\nthey may talk about how\nmuch money they earn\nat their current position.\nThe need to constantly one-up you\ncomes from an obsession\nwith class and status.\nEnvious people tend to be attracted\nby the superficial elements in life,\nsuch as material items,\nphysical features, and\nsocial status and likability.\nThey see your accomplishments as a threat\nto their social standing,\nprompting them to upstage\nyou in any way they can.\nNumber five, their\ncompliments are back-handed.\nDoes it feel fake when\nthey compliment you?\nPeople who are jealous\noften give compliments\nthat aren't very genuine.\nInstead, it can feel like\ninsults and criticisms\ndisguised as flattering comments.\nThese often come from\na place of ignorance,\nsome form of arrogance and egotism,\nand a lack of self-security.\nAccording to a series of studies\nat Harvard Business School,\nwhile people intend\nback-handed compliments\nto increase their likability\nand status at the same time,\nthe givers come across as\nless sincere, less attractive,\nmore condescending,\nand even less competent\nthan those who offer a\ntraditional compliment.\nIt's a tactic to hurt you\nwhile trying to come across\nas interested and concerned.\nNumber six, they celebrate your failures.\nEnvious people can sometimes\nbe unhealthily invested\nin keeping up with where you're at in life\nby monitoring your success\nand achievements closely.\nThis is so they can catch you\nwhen you trip or fall in life.\nAny example of your\nseemingly poor performance\nfeeds their insecurity and ego.\nSimilarly, you may also notice\nthat they won't offer any\nsupport and encouragement to you\nin an attempt to discourage you\nfrom pursuing your goals further.\nIf you notice that this so-called friend\nor loved one in your life\nis acting oddly, unaffected,\nor even happy about a struggle\nyou may be experiencing in life,\nthey're most likely jealous of you\nand are projecting this\nbehavior as a result.\nAnd number seven, they scrutinize you\nwhile imitating your admirable\ntraits and characteristics.\nEnvious people are always\npaying close attention\nto their targets,\nironically copying the very\nthings they critique them for.\nThey may express\nthat your dressing style\nis too over the top,\nbut then start upgrading their\nwardrobe to classier fits.\nThey may criticize you for\nbeing excessively hardworking\nand then try to improve their\nown work ethic to exceed you.\nAs written in Psychology Today,\nthis pre-occupancy and social comparison\nagainst their target\nultimately leads to them\nusing the target they diminish in private,\nas the same criteria for\nelevating their public\nor social image.\nThey're, in a way, your secret admirer.\nTheir goal is to be just\nlike you, if not better.\nSo is there someone who is jealous of you?\nLet us
