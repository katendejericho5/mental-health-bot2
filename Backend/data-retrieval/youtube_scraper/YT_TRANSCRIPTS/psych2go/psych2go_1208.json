    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nare you an old soul?\nAn old soul is mature, wise,\nand like the name suggests,\npeople often think there's an old soul\ntrapped inside their body.\nWell, not literally, but\nyou know what I mean?\nIf you are an old soul,\npeople may have had a hard\ntime understanding you\nand may think you're a bit weird in turn.\nBut maybe you are just\nwise beyond your years.\nWell, if you relate to these six signs,\nthen you may just be an old\nsoul trapped in a young body.\nWell, kind of.\nNumber one, you feel\nlike you are an outsider.\nDo you often feel like you're an outsider?\nOld souls may have a hard time\nin their youth making friends\nwith their peers because\nof their maturity.\nYou may find you get along\nwith older people instead\nand have deeper conversations with them.\nIn a Mind Body Green article,\nintuitive counselor Randi Merzon explains\nthat if you're an old soul\nand are still chronologically young,\nit might take a while to find your tribe.\nMerzon continued saying that\nthey might feel like an outlier\nand they may initially feel\nthat they're alone in this.\nSo what is a tribe?\nA tribe is a group of friends\nthat you feel truly at home with.\nYou get each other\nand often have similar hobbies,\npassions, and interests.\nMost importantly, your\nconversations and connections\nare deeper and more stimulating\nthan your other friends.\nThey're your tribe.\nNumber two, you like to spend time alone.\nDo you prefer to spend more\ntime alone than with others?\nThis can also be a sign\nthat you are an old soul.\nSome old souls are very sensitive\nand empathetic towards others.\nSo sometimes interacting\nwith a large group of people\nfor a while can be emotionally draining.\nOld souls can often spend a\nlot of time observing others\nand reflecting before\nimmediately responding.\nSo they don't mind spending a\nbit more time in their head.\nSpending some time alone to\nrecharge, reflect, contemplate,\nand daydream can be\nnormal for an old soul.\nNumber three, you don't\ncare for material things.\nAre you a shopaholic?\nDo you have to have the latest phone\nas soon as it comes out?\nMany people love shopping trips\nand enjoy having their\nfavorite possessions close by.\nBut most old souls aren't\nparticularly interested\nin material things.\nThey care more about other things,\nor, well, they don't\ncare for things at all.\nThey prefer learning new things,\nexpanding their knowledge and\nimproving their relationships.\nNumber four, you give great advice.\nHave you ever been told\nthat you give great advice?\nDo people say you're\nwise beyond your years?\nThis is another sign\nthat you are an old soul.\nThere's the one in your friend group\nwith the creative solutions, suggestions,\nand you often come up with\ngreat ways to help others.\nPart of this is also due to how observant\nand great of a listener you are.\nNumber five, your intentions are strong.\nOld souls make most of their\nchoices with their intentions\nat the forefront of their mind.\nWhen they sit down to create a project,\nthey're keeping the end goal in mind.\nWhen they respond to others,\nthey think before they react.\nThis is also because\nthey're very observant.\nThey also don't like\nto waste too much time.\nMost of their choices have\nstrong intentions behind them.\nIn this way, they can often be productive,\nthat is if that's their intention.\nAnd number six, you\nvalue deep connections.\nWould you rather have a few close friends\nor many acquaintances?\nOld souls value deep connections.\nSo instead of many acquaintances,\nthey'll likely have a few\nclose friends instead.\nThey can still be a people person\nand love meeting new people\nbut they value close relationships\nover simply knowing more people.\nSince younger old souls\nmay have a harder time\nmaking friends with those\naround their own age,\nthey may have a few friends\nthat they form a deep connection\nwith over time anyway.\nOld souls can also be a bit philosophical,\nso they wanna form closer relationships\nso they can have these\ndeep conversations instead\nof more casual ones with new\nfriends or acquaintances.\nWho doesn't love a good\nphilosophical conversation\nwith the best friend anyway?\nHmm.\nWhat should your next deep\nconversation be about?\nPerhaps the subconscious mind.\nGood thing, Psych2Go has\na video on the mysteries\nof the subconscious mind,\nlink in the description box.\nFeel free to invite\nyour close friends over\nand discuss the mysteries of the mind.\nSo do you think you're an old soul?\nFeel free to let us know\nin the comments down below.\nIf you enjoyed this video,\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share it with a loved\none or close friend.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAs always, thanks for watching.\nSee you next time."
