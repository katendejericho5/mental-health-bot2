    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nBe honest, how attractive\ndo you think you are?\nWithout a doubt, you are a catch,\nbut if you want that teeny tiny boost\nto up your attractiveness game,\nthen you've certainly\ncome to the right place.\nHere are eight little habits\nto make you more attractive,\nnot that you need it.\nNumber one, eat a at least\none good meal every day.\nRemember, we're talking\nabout little habits\nnot outrageous ones.\nSure, it's nice to have\na healthy diet overall.\nIt promotes heart health,\nreduces cancer risk, and improves mood,\nbut let's be honest,\ndepriving yourself of that\nice cream is not worth it.\nFood restrictions and deprivations\nare shown to have\npsychological manifestations,\nsuch as preoccupation\nwith food and eating,\nincreased emotional responsiveness\nand distractibility.\nThat's why it's better to\nstart with one hearty meal\nof carbs, veggies and fruits every day,\nto add a happy boost to your\nbeautiful attractive self.\nNumber two, substitute your bad thoughts\nwith affirming ones.\n\"I'm gaining too much weight.\nMy wrinkles are showing a lot.\nWhy can't I be more independent?\"\nHow many times do you\ncomment on your appearance\nor personality every day?\nIs it mostly good or bad remarks?\nOne large scale study\nfound that rumination\nand self-blame over negative events\nwere linked to an increased\nrisk of mental health problems.\nYou deserve so much in life\nand these unpleasant thoughts\nare not worth your time.\nWhen you say something\nnegative to yourself\nwhy not try to shift it into a better,\nmore self-appreciative direction,\nsuch as, \"Hm, I'm bigger than\nI was before, but that's okay.\nIt's a normal part of life\nand I love my body for working so hard.\nI wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.\"\nIt may feel weird at first.\nYou may not feel better immediately,\nbut you're slowly giving yourself\nthe appreciation it earned.\nThat's a step forward and it\nwill help a lot over time.\nRemember, you are\neverything you need to be.\nThat's gorgeous.\nNumber three, know your basic etiquette.\nThis means smiling, saying thank you,\nexcuse me, and being polite.\nThese actions may seem small,\nbut they help a whole lot.\nThey're powerful enough to\nbrighten a stranger's dark day.\nResearchers, Sara Algoe,\nat the University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill,\nand her colleagues studying gratitude,\nhave found that being thankful\nand expressing it to others\nis good for our health and happiness.\nNot only does it feel good,\nbut it also helps us build trust\nand closer bonds with others.\nSo don't be shy,\na person will always\nappreciate your kindness.\nAs Brittany Candau, author\nof \"Have Courage, Be Kind:\nThe Tale of Cinderella\" says,\n\"You must always remember\nthis, have courage and be kind.\nYou have more kindness\nin your little finger\nthan most people possess\nin their whole body.\nAnd it has power.\nMore than you know.\"\nNumber four, take time to reflect.\nWhen you know you've made a mistake\ndo you accept it and move\non, or find ways around it?\nLife is full of lessons and experiences\nand holds the value of the past.\nFrom the moment you were born,\nyou've created a ripple effect\nthat influenced the lives\naround you and beyond.\nThat's why it's important to look back\nand contemplate and think about today.\nWho have you helped?\nWho have you hurt?\nWhat will you do next?\nThese little self-reflections\nwill guide you\nto become who you wanna be.\nIt sounds complicated, but it's as simple\nas what you're going to do\nin the next moment or the next hour.\nBe tolerant and open in\nadmitting your mistakes.\nWith that, you're wiser and\nmore mature every step forward.\nNumber five, check up on your loved ones.\nWith life as fast paced as it is now,\npeople are often so enraptured\nwith their own lives\nthat they forget to stop for a moment\nand cherish the presence\nof those with them.\nEven the simplest, \"Hey,\nhow are you?\" will do.\nPeople appreciate being checked up on.\nIt shows them that you're thinking of them\nand care enough to leave a\nmessage or even go visit them.\nWhen was the last time\nyou spent a moment with\nsomeone gadget free?\nAccording to Griffith College,\nswitching off technology\ncan provide better sleep,\nless anxiety, and quality experiences.\nSo if your answer is, \"Fairly recently,\"\nthen congratulations, you\nare surely more attractive.\nNumber six, stand up for\nyour actions and words.\nAn attractive person\nis an assertive person.\nAssertive communicators can\nexpress their own needs,\ndesires, ideas, and feelings,\nwhile also considering\nthe needs of others.\nThe point is that confidence is sexy,\nbut too much of it may\nmake you an you egomaniac,\nand that's kind of straying\noff the attractive path.\nWhen you live up to\nyour actions and deeds,\npeople see you as trustworthy,\nand trust is a major trait\npeople seek in a partner.\nSo attractiveness, big check.\nNumber seven, listen to understand.\nAuthor and inspirational thinker,\nStephen Covey, said, \"The\nbiggest communication problem\nis we don't listen to\nunderstand, we listen to reply.\"\nHm, which one are you?\nListening to reply is the standard way\nthat most people communicate.\nWe're humans after all.\nIt's only normal to exchange words, right?\nWell, not so much.\nWhen you are listening to understand,\nyou're giving them your\nundivided attention.\nYour eyes are focused.\nYour body is leaning in.\nYou're smiling at the right moments.\nIt provides intimacy,\nwhich the other person\ncan find attractive.\nThis is because sometimes\npeople wanna have meaningful conversations\nand you can't achieve that\nby listening halfheartedly.\nBut becoming an active\nlistener takes practice.\nSo here are some tips to remember.\nListen, don't interrupt, understand,\ntry not to judge, respond.\nPlus one for attractiveness.\nNumber eight, be supportive.\nIn life, you are the main character,\nno doubt about that.\nYou're a star, but that also means\nyou're someone else's\nsupporting character too.\nWhen you are with the people you love,\nyou root for them with all your heart.\nBeing a part of someone's\nsocial support system\nhelps promote their good\nphysical and mental health.\nThe ability to show your care\nfor another person is truly attractive.\nYou're building a deep\nconnection with them\nand involving them in your life.\nIf they don't find that attractive,\nthen who knows what they will.\nI'm just kidding.\nRemember that you're\nalready so attractive.\nThese are only little tips\nto make you even more irresistible.\nOut of all these points, which\ndo you agree with the most?\nWho's the most attractive\nperson you know and why?\nShare your stories in the\ncomments section below,\nand remember to like and share this video.\nAs always, the
