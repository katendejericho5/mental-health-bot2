workplace stress\nthat has not been successfully\nmanaged, in other words.\nIt's response to prolonged job stress.\nThis applies whether your\nwork is at the office,\nin school, or at home.\nLike if housework or caring\nfor family members is your main job.\nAlthough it is an occupational phenomenon\nrather than a medical condition,\nthe struggles that come\nwith it are very real.\nIt's important

signs of trouble\nwith sleep and appetite early on.\nAnd ensure that you get\nenough rest, nutrition\nand exercise to help prevent your stress\nfrom worsening into burnout.\nNumber two, allowing\nnegative feelings to faster.\nIt's normal to sometimes\nfeel nervous, sad, or angry.\nBut it's important to take note\nof persistent anxiety,\nsadness, or hopelessness\nas well as irritability with other people.\nMild symptoms of these may\nbecome increasingly serious\nas you approach burnout.\nSimilarly, with physical\ndifficulties such as insomnia.\nIf these are left

work.\nThis may happen when you work harder\nand forget to take breaks in the process.\nMaybe pressured by external forces\nor personally driven to achieve success.\nBut if you keep working\nyour yourself to the bone\nwithout any proper breaks,\nyou may be putting yourself\nin danger of burnout.\nTaking a vacation might bring\nyou some temporary relief\nbut it's better to take\nregular breaks from work\nand try to recharge.\nNumber four, keeping your\nproblems to yourself.\nBurnout has also been\ntraced to working conditions\nthat cause stress such\nas unreasonable time,\npressure and workload expectations.\nUnfair treatment, lack of role clarity,\nand lack of communication\nand support from a manager.\nIf you feel as though you're\nbeing treated unfairly at work,\nor if expectations are\nunclear, you should discuss\nthese issues with your manager, supervisor\nor a trustworthy person of\nauthority that can help you.\nKeeping these issues to yourself\nand tolerating

wrong job.\nClarity of your current roles\ncan help you figure this out.\nYour current job might not provide\nthe right learning opportunities for you\nor the career growth that you desire.\nPerhaps it doesn't challenge you enough\nin aspects that you're\ninterested in improving on\nor maybe you're overqualified for your job\nand are simply lacking stimulation\nor a chance to flourish.\nWe might not be able\nto choose our dream job\nbut assessing your needs\nand exploring options\nmay lead to greater fulfillment\nor at least help you\nfigure out the way forward.\nAnd number six, neglecting personal life.\nBy constantly working\nhard and pushing yourself,\nyou may have neglected your personal life.\nBy directing all your time\nand energy toward work,\nyou may grow weary of the\nsame
