    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Have you\never met a narcissist?\nHow about a dark empath?\nPeople who have strong narcissistic traits\nhave an inflated opinion of themselves.\nThey also have an intense\nneed for the admiration\nand attention of others, also\nknown as narcissistic supply.\nThe type of behavior\nthat people with narcissistic\npersonality disorder portray\nmay influenced by environmental factors\nsuch as excessive parental\npampering, or childhood abuse.\nDark empaths on the other hand,\ntend to be more perceptive\ntowards other people's\nfeelings than narcissists.\nYet they also manipulate\npeople quite the same.\nThere are a lot of similar qualities\nbetween the two but they are not the same.\nIt will be quite difficult\nto differentiate them\nfrom one another,\nunless you deeply examine\ntheir patterns of behavior\nand their ability to be genuine.\nThey both like to be in control.\nSo what exactly would happen\nif they met each other?\nWould they clash or become\nthe best of friends?\nLet's find out.\nNumber one, a power duo might be born.\nWill a narcissist ever get\nalong with a dark empath?\nFor the majority of the\ntime the answer is no.\nNarcissists and dark empaths\nboth have dominant personalities\nand rely on other people\nto do their bidding.\nSo the thought of them being friends\nsounds completely absurd.\nBut while it is most\nlikely that narcissists\nand dark empaths clash\nthere times when they\ncould become best buddies.\nThis is because dark\nempaths have a high level\nof cognitive empathy.\nThey're very perceptive about\nwhat other people are feeling\nand usually know what's going on.\nFor this reason,\ndark empaths can identify a\nproud flamboyant narcissist\nand befriend them to utilize\nfor future situations.\nAnd when they team up, both\npictures of manipulation,\nself-centeredness and charisma\nthey can be quite dangerous\nfor the unsuspecting.\nNumber two, a fight for control ensues.\nBoth narcissists and dark empaths\nhave an urge to take everything\nthey want for themselves.\nThey're drawn to leadership positions\nand other people will often naturally\ngive into their desires so\nas not to spark their anger.\nBetween the both of them,\nnarcissists would be the ones\nwho will most likely stop at nothing\nto have things their way.\nThis is because they tend to lack empathy\nand have a high amount of arrogance.\nDark empaths can be\nquite stubborn as well,\nbut because as they can\ngauge other people's emotions\nthey're more likely to pull back\nto find other ways to get what they want.\nWhen the two are together\nit may seem like the narcissist\nis the more dominant one,\nbut the dark empath is more likely\nthe person pulling the\nstrings behind the curtain.\nNumber three, their language will be lies.\nHow do know whether\nthey're telling the truth?\nYou can't, narcissists and dark empaths\nhave honed their talents\nin the art of lying.\nA narcissist need for admiration\nmay cause them to boast about\ntheir false achievements,\nwhile a dark empaths\nmanipulative personality\nmay cause them to lie\nto appear compassionate.\nThey see lying as a method\nto procure their desires\nand so will continue to do so\nwithout the consequence of guilt.\nSo when the two of them meet,\nthey will probably let out\none lie after the other\njust to appear better than the other.\nNumber four, manipulation\nwill be their weapon.\nWho is more cunning?\nNarcissists and dark empaths\nare no strangers to lying\nand being in control.\nThe absence of guilt and hunger for power\nmakes the masters of manipulation.\nWhen a narcissist and a dark empath meet,\nthey may immediately try\nto bring each other down\nthrough pass of aggressive means.\nThis may mean bragging about their wins\nand trying to downsize\neach other's achievements.\nIt's also likely that they'd\nstart trouble for each other\nbehind the scenes by gossiping,\nbackstabbing and blaming\nthings on each other.\nNumber five, they will get\non each other's nerves.\nHow similar is a narcissist\nto a dark empath?\nThey do share a lot of similar qualities.\nFor instance, they're both\nnarcissistic, manipulative\nand power hungry.\nThe main difference is that dark empaths\nhave a higher understanding\nof other people's feelings\nwhile narcissists don't give\nother people much thought,\nthey just wanna barrel into\nperfection all the time.\nBut aside from that,\nbecause their personalities\nare quite reflective of one another\nthey may become annoyed\nat how difficult it is,\nto make the others submit to their wishes.\nTheir constant battle for\nsupremacy can become tiring\nand cause them great frustration.\nThey're used to having their way quickly.\nSo this new found obstacle\nmay just feel like the\nban of their existence.\nNumber six, they will\ncharm their way out of it.\nNarcissists are usually\nvery attracted to empaths,\nit's because narcissists\nwant someone who will\nconstantly praise them.\nAnd empaths or at least full empaths,\nhave enough patience and\ncompassion in their hearts\nto keep giving to others.\nThey're a good match, but\nonly for the narcissists.\nThis is because that\ntype of of relationship\nwill quickly turn toxic,\nespecially for the good\nnatured full empath.\nDark empaths and narcissists\nare pretty charismatic too.\nIt's just that they\nutilize this trait to lure\nother people into their trap.\nWhen both of them meet,\nthey will display signs of confidence\nand try to attract the\nother two their side.\nBut they're both playing the same game.\nThe narcissist may come to see,\nthat it would take a lot\nmore to manipulate them\nwhile the dark empath will befriend them\njust to end up using them later on.\nAnd number seven, they won't\nforget each other's mistakes.\nNarcissists and dark empaths hold grudges\nbecause it's their key\nto staying in control.\nFor example,\nwhen they notice that\nthere's losing an argument\nthey will quickly rattle off\nthe other person's mistakes\nto give themselves power.\nNarcissists lack patience\nand consideration for others,\nand so may sometimes outright fight others\nwhenever they do something wrong.\nThey don't like being put in a position\nthat makes them submissive.\nDark empaths on the other\nhand, tend to be malicious.\nThey can be flexible\nand choose to not start\nan argument right away,\nbut they will remember each error.\nSo when both of them meet,\nthey're probably already\nnoting down each other's moves\nand coming up with a\nstrategy to still control.\nDo you think you've ever\nencountered a narcissist\nor dark empath?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful\nbe sure to like, subscribe\nand share this
