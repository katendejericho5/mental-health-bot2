    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nDo you have a crush?\nMaybe you just can't stop thinking\nabout if they like you\nas much as you like them.\nYou notice they look at\nyou from time to time.\nYou even caught them smiling at you.\nBut is it a friendly\nsmile or something more?\nWell, here are a few signs\nthat someone likes you.\nIf you notice more than\nthree of these signs,\nthey may just like you a lot.\nNumber one, their eyebrows\nraise suddenly at you.\nNext time you approach your\ncrush, notice their eyebrows.\nDo they suddenly rise up in surprise?\nKnown as the eyebrow flash\namong many psychologists\nand body language experts,\nthis raising of the\neyebrows often expresses\nnot only that they may\nwant to approach you,\nbut it can be a sign\nof attraction as well.\nA release of the hormone dopamine\nis likely responsible for this\noften involuntary movement.\nAccording to Healthline,\nwhen you come to associate a\ncertain activity with pleasure,\nmere anticipation may be enough\nto raise dopamine levels.\nIt could be a certain food, sex, shopping,\nor just about anything\nelse that you enjoy.\nNumber two, they smile a lot around you\nand try to make you smile.\nDo you notice your crush\nsmiling a lot around you?\nWhen people are near someone they like,\nthey'll likely get a wave\nof happiness and excitement\nand be more inclined to\nsmile often around them.\nA genuine smile around you is a sign,\nat the very least, that\nthey enjoy your company.\nBut if they also try to\nmake you smile or laugh,\nthey probably like you even more.\nWho doesn't wanna make\ntheir crush feel happy?\nNumber three, they subtly touch you.\nAnother sign of attraction is when someone\noften subtly touches you.\nThis could be a light\nlingering tap on the shoulder\nas they pass by or a nudge\non the arm during a joke.\nIf they do this often\nand in a respectable way,\nit's likely they have a crush on you.\nThe extra trick is to see if they're only\nsubtly touching you.\nIf this is simply a common thing they do\nwith new friends or acquaintances,\nit could just be friendly.\nAre there eyebrows flashing as well?\nNumber four, they lean towards you often,\nsit next to you, and remove\nbarriers between you.\nYou're at a party, and you notice someone,\nin particular, keeps leaning towards you.\nThey also choose to sit next\nto you any chance they can.\nIf someone is removing any\nbarriers between the both of you\nand they often lean towards\nyou in conversation,\nthis is a good indicator they like you.\nPay close attention to the\ndirection their body is facing.\nAre their shoulders facing\ntowards you more than others?\nAre they choosing to turn\ntheir head towards you\nand smile when someone says a funny joke?\nThis is a clear sign they admire you.\nAnd number five, they ask about you\nand wanna know more about you.\nIf you like someone,\nwouldn't you wanna know more about them?\nYou'd wanna talk to them\nmore and ask questions\nabout who they are and get to know them,\nunless you're really shy.\nBut generally, if you can get\npast that initial introduction\nand have a few conversations\nwith your crush,\nyou're likely going to want\nto get to know them better\non a personal level.\nDoes your crush ask about\nwhat's going on in your life?\nDo they notice when you're feeling blue\nor acting out of the ordinary?\nDo they ask about your interests?\nHow you're doing when they see you?\nThis is a clear sign they not\nonly have an interest in you\nbut they may just like, like you as well.\nIf you like them, go make them smile.\nLean towards them and get to know them\nover a sweet dinner date.\nSo, who likes you? Do you like them back?\nWill you ask them out?\nFeel free to let us know in\nthe comment section below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did, don't forget\nto click the like button\nand share it with a friend\nor someone who could use it.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and\nhit the notification VO icon\nfor more content like this.\nAs always, thanks for watching,\nand see you next time."
