    "transcript": "so you have someone in your life who\nlikes you or at least you think they do\nbut sometimes you get a feeling that\nthey're feeling something else as well\nyour current hunch is that they might\nhave a fear of rejection\nbut how can you tell or maybe you aren't\nquite sure so you're looking for a few\nmore signs before you bring it up to\nthem well it's always great to\ncommunicate to your partner what it is\nyou're feeling or worried about but if\nyou're looking for some science as well\nhere are six signs someone is into you\nbut they're afraid you'll reject them\nnumber one they try to be their best\nself around you and preen themselves\naround you\ndo you notice this particular person is\nalways being their best self around you\nwhen compared to how they normally are\nwhen we like someone of course we're\ngoing to try to be the best we can\nbecause we want to put our best foot\nforward and perhaps show them our great\nqualities\nyou probably need to know if this person\nlikes you before you know if they're\nafraid of rejection\nif they're going out of their way to\nshow you their fantastic qualities and\nthey're trying hard to be their best\nself this could mean it's because they\nreally like you as long as it's\nrespectful kind and not too cocky it\ncould be that they genuinely like you if\nyou also notice that just before you\narrive they're fixing their hair clothes\nor checking the mirror for food in their\nteeth this is another sign they could\nlike you\npreening like this around or before a\ncertain someone approaches is a common\nsign of attraction do you do the same\naround your crush number two they were\nvery nervous on your first few dates\nhave you been out on a date with them or\nmaybe you hung out a few times were they\npretty nervous on their first date with\nyou\nthis is a common sign that they like you\nthose with the fear of rejection will\noften be a bit more anxious on the first\ndate because they really want things to\ngo well\nwill you reject their request for a\nsecond date\nif you notice they're having trouble\ntalking and their palms are sweaty\nperhaps try to ease their nerves on a\nsecond date and go somewhere that's\ncomfortable for them getting to know\neach other over their mom's spaghetti\nno okay\naccording to statistics only a small\npercentage of you who watch our videos\nare actually subscribed\nso if you haven't and at the end of the\nvideo you enjoy what you see do consider\nsubscribing it would help a lot with\nyoutube's algorithm in promoting more of\nour mental health content thanks for\nbeing here number three they don't talk\nabout commitment or how serious their\nrelationship has become\nso you've been on a few dates and you\nfeel you're ready to go official and\nbecome partners\nbut as much as they genuinely seem to\nlike you they never bring up the matter\nor even hint at it they may also never\nflat out tell you they like you because\nthen there'd be room for you to bluntly\nrespond\nthey'll slide the phrase in a\nconversation or long sentences somewhere\nand then hurriedly change the subject if\nyou don't respond right away if you have\na chance to respond\nnumber four they'll often do things to\nimpress you\ndo you notice your partner or crush will\ndo or say things in an attempt to\nimpress you\nlots of people will do this when they\nlike someone but if you notice they do\nit more often than not it could be\nbecause they're afraid you'll reject\nthem if you don't hear everything great\nabout them first\nif it's a crush they may not ask you out\nbefore for sure knowing that you like\nthem because you could always reject\nthem so instead they'll go out of their\nway to impress you or throw in hints of\nimpressive qualities they have\nthis could be in hopes you'll like them\ntoo and ask them out first\nnumber five they're a people pleaser\nwith you\nyou've noticed they never really seemed\nlike a people pleaser but with you they\nseem to go out of their way to please\nyou even when it could negatively affect\nthem you may not know it but you find\nout later they cancelled important plans\nbecause they didn't want to say no to\nyour request to hang out\nor maybe they don't express their true\nopinion because they try to keep one\nsimilar to yours\nthey always seem to nod along with your\nopinion even though you could've swore\nthey had felt different before\nwhile having common interests and\nopinions is a great thing it's important\nthat they aren't altering their opinion\njust to please you if something seems\noff a calm discussion about your\nconcerns could be a good idea for those\nin a relationship and number six they're\nsometimes very passive or don't bring up\ntheir needs\neveryone is different and has different\nlevels of energy but if you notice\nthey've been acting a bit passive lately\nand don't often bring up their needs or\ndesires they could be too afraid to out\nof fear of rejection\nmany with a fear of rejection also fear\nconfrontation\nboth partners needs and wants are valid\nand important in a relationship\nso if it seems they're holding back on\nwhat they want gently bring up the topic\nof their needs\nwhat do they want out of this\nrelationship\nare you getting what you want do they\nreally want to go to that sushi\nrestaurant but said they'll go to\nfrank's barbecue all because you really\nwanted chicken wings\nwell that's sweet but maybe casually\ntake turns on picking date locations\nor come up with a compromise\nyep goodbye sweet chicken wings but who\ndoesn't love a good spicy tuna roll yum\nso do you think someone is into you but\nhas a fear of rejection\nhow will you bring up the topic with\nthem and talk it through\nthese things can take time so make sure\nyou're both comfortable but a bit of\ncommunication and reaching out may just\nhelp your relationship become an even\nhealthier one we hope you enjoyed this\nvideo and if you did don't forget to\nclick the like button comment and share\nit with a friend loved one or someone\nwho could use it subscribe to psyc2go\nand hit the
