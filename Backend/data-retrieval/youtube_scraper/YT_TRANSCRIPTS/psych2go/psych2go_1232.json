    "transcript": "so you've read all the articles and\nwatched all those clips and yet you\nstill don't quite match up to the\nintrovert label\nyou notice that despite enjoying social\ninteraction and not feeling drained by\nthem you have a difficult time steering\nit in the right direction\nif that's so you may not be truly\nintroverted just a bit socially awkward\nlet's look at some signs that this may\nbe the case\nnumber one\nyour social avoidance is from fear of\nfailure not because it's draining\ndo you really want to talk and interact\nbut fear of embarrassing yourself or an\nimagined worst case scenario just stops\nyou cold it's the difference between\nfear and frugal with energy you have the\nenergy to spare but you're scared to\ngive it out\nintroverts are more than able to relax\nand enjoy social settings they differ\nfrom extroverts because they need alone\ntime to recharge they differ from them\nmerely socially awkward and that they're\nnot necessarily afraid it's more like\nthey have limited currency and they're\ndeciding where they can afford to spend\nit being socially awkward isn't even\nrestricted to introverts extroverts get\nit too being extroverted isn't an\nautomatic suave james bond 007 ticket\nnumber two you're anxious and\nuncomfortable in social situations\nin a social situation do you feel like\nyou can't quite get enough air and maybe\nlike the walls are closing in even when\nthere aren't any walls and darn it why\nis everyone staring at you\nand hey when that person said nice shirt\nwhat did they mean\ndarn it anxiety decided to be your plus\none again\nso how is this different from introverts\nwell although introverts don't tend to\nenjoy large groups their typical\nreaction isn't panicky suffocation\neither if they're in a group of people\nthat are in their personal worth the\nspending category they aren't anxious at\nall\nalthough as before ye old battery still\nneeds quiet recharging afterwards\nsocial awkwardness just happens\nregardless of who it is socially awkward\npeople have a mind that makes them\nbelieve they're being judged by everyone\nall the time making them tense and\npossibly defensive\nnumber three you find it difficult to\nmake conversations with others maybe you\nhave a whole lot in your head but you\ncan't spit it out the thought of\nconversation is mildly terrifying and\nyou find that when you do try to\nconverse it feels disjointed like a\nchoppy poorly cut movie\nsee introverts may present as reserved\nor quiet as they're more attuned to\nreflecting and observing however when\nneeded they can have a perfectly flowing\nconversation\ntheir natural quietness doesn't stop\ntheir ability to perform or interview\nwell\nsocially awkward people on the other\nhand find it excruciatingly difficult to\nmake small talk or new talk in any\nsituation\nthe tension they experience often has\nthem forget how to connect ideas\nverbally and what comes out is not what\nthey wanted sometimes the struggle makes\nthem cringe so hard they just avoid it\nall together so the quiet is fear of\nstruggle not one of contemplation\nnumber four\nyou're not as verbally articulate as\nyou'd like\nthis is directly connected to the\nprevious point you frequently experience\ntalk block\nit feels like you've almost got a\nmagical blocking curse on your brain\nthat stops you from finding the right\nwords and instead makes your brain\nstutter then to your horror what comes\nout sounds to you a lot like derp\nif so you may be socially awkward\nintroverts can certainly struggle with\nverbal articulation but they're more\nthan capable of speaking eloquently when\nthey need to especially if the topic is\nabout something that they're well versed\nin\nsocially awkward people often find it\nharder to articulate because it's\ndifficult for them to intake prioritize\nand organize all the external stimuli\nlike the other person's nonverbal cues\nhow they themselves sound and then how\nto respond to all of that this inability\nto filter and organize allows them to\nbecome overwhelmed so they kind of blue\nscreen\nnumber five alone time makes you feel\nmore lonely\nhere's a big one\nintroverts need that alone time as\nthat's when the battery charger actually\nworks\nthey're socially awkward though finds\nthat this alone time can make them feel\nwell\nmore alone\nintroverts see alone time as sort of a\nreward\nyes peace i can finally just reflect on\nthings i can finally binge watch the\nwitcher without interruption\nthe socially awkward can enjoy it\nsometimes but not always\nsometimes it's a relief after being\noverwhelmed but sometimes it's just a\nreminder that they were excluded or\notherwise didn't choose to be alone and\nnumber six you have twitches\nno this doesn't mean you're about to\nlose control like some movie comic book\nvillain we mean body tells you know like\nin poker\nthink if you've ever caught yourself\ndoing quick repetitive movements such as\ndrilling your hair or bouncing a leg\nthe socially awkward do these fidgeting\ntwitching physical towels when they're\nplaced in an uncomfortable situation and\ncertainly introverts and extroverts\nalike with social awkwardness may also\nhave these dilemmas\nit has to be taken as a whole though\nbecause not all introverts are socially\nawkward so did you relate to any of the\nsigns above\ndid any of this help you figure out\nsomething that has been bugging you for\na while social awkwardness is something\nthat can affect many of us and isn't\nalways consistent those of us who\nexperience it more frequently may find\nhope and that much of social awkwardness\ncan be dealt with through learning more\nabout yourself and practice being social\nfeel free to share and discuss below and\nwe'll catch you next time"
