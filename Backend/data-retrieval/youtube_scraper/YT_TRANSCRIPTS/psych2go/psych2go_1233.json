    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Have you\never been called a simp?\nWhat is a simp?\n\"Simp\" is an internet slang term\nthat's often used to describe someone\nwho gives someone they like\na bit too much attention and sympathy\nonly in hopes that\nthey'll notice them or like them back.\nThis attention is often given to someone\nwho doesn't reciprocate the same feelings\nfor the simp.\nOr in a fair amount\nof cases online,\nmay not even know they exist.\nSo are you a simp?\nHow can you tell the difference\nbetween simply crushing on someone\nor full hardcore simp mode?\nWell, here are a few subtle signs\nthat you are being a simp.\nNumber one, you're\ncourteous or kind to them,\nbut only because\nyou a expect something in return.\nWhat are your intentions\nwhen being courteous\nand kind to someone you like?\nAre you well mannered\nand kind to others in general?\nOr are you going out of your way\nto show your crush\nyou're sweet and courteous only because\nyou expect something in return from them?\nIf you're only being kind to your crush\nsimply to win them over,\nit's likely you're simping.\nYes, people can be a bit kinder\nto people they like more,\nbut it all comes down to intention.\nAre you trying to only show off\nhow great, selfless,\nand sympathetic you are?\nNot looking too good, my friend.\nNot looking too good.\nNumber two, you often defend them online\nonly in hopes that they'll notice you.\nDo you overly defend\nor comment on someone's online posts\nonly in hopes that they'll notice you?\nYou see a small injustice take place\non social media towards someone,\nbut decide not to intervene\nbecause you don't find them attractive.\nBut then you see\nsomething unfair happening\nto that extremely attractive influencer\nyou just barely followed an hour ago\nand have to immediately\ncomment in their defenses.\nPeople often want to defend\nand stick up for their\nfriends, loved ones,\nand even their favorite\ninfluencers or YouTubers online.\nThe difference lies in your intentions.\nOnce again, are you defending them\nin hopes that they'll notice your comment,\ngive you a heart or a thumbs up?\nNumber three, they don't like you back,\nbut you continue to simp.\nA classic sign of simping.\nHave you flirted with your crush,\nhinted that you like them,\nbut they seem uninterested\nor have made it clear\nthat they don't feel the same way?\nYou can still be friends,\nbut do you find yourself\ntrying a bit more to impress them,\ndefend them, be extra kind to them\nall in hopes that their\nfeelings may change?\nYeah, you are most likely simping.\nNumber four, constantly\ntrying to impress them.\nAre you constantly thinking of ways\nto impress your crush?\nAs mentioned earlier,\nif you're trying to impress someone\nwho has made it clear\nthat they're uninterested,\nit's, well, simping behavior.\nSimps are overly eager to amuse\nand entertain their crush.\nThey wanna get their attention.\nAnd one way is through\nshowing off or bragging.\nMany people want to impress\nthe people that they like,\nbut if it's the main focus of yours\nand they've already made it clear\nthat they're not interested,\nit's best to relax\nand just be yourself.\nUnfortunately for you, as a friend.\nNumber five, you're buying\nthem things, doing favors,\neven though you're not\nclose friends or partners.\nOkay, extreme simp mode.\nThat person who's made it clear\nthey just aren't into you romantically,\neven though you're not particularly close,\nor even friends for that matter,\nyou start buying them gifts\nor going out of your way\nto do favors for them.\nWhile the thought is sweet,\nit's also a sign of a classic simp.\nRemember, what's the intention here?\nOut of the kindness of your heart\nor to win over their heart?\nSee what I did there.\nPeople do favors for each other, yeah.\nBut if you're going out of your way\nto do huge favors for them\nor buying them unnecessary gifts\nthat will leave you\nin a major credit card debt,\nit's likely you're a simp.\nAnd number six, you put their needs\nway above yours\nonly because you want\nthem to like you back.\nDo you say yes to every favor or request\nfrom the person you like,\neven if these favors\nwill require you to put their needs\nway above yours?\nIt's nice to think of others\nand help out when you can.\nBut if you're going out\nof your way to help them\nand often put their needs\nbefore yours to impress them,\nthen you're probably simping.\nThis is a classic simping symptom.\nIt's best to get help early on\nand talk to someone\nabout your symptoms\nbefore they worsen,\nbut not your crush.\nSo are you a simp?\nLet us know in the comments down below.\nIt's good to be kind\nto others, respectful,\nand come to their defense\nand if someone's being unfair to them.\nIt all comes back to intentions\nwhen identifying a simp.\nYou can still be kind\nand courteous to your crush,\nbut ask yourself this.\nAre you only being kind to them\nin hopes they praise you, like you?\nHave they let you know\nthey don't feel the same way about you?\nThere is likely someone out there for you,\nbut it may not be the\nperson you're simping for.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did,\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share it with a friend or crush.\nActually, maybe not your crush this time.\nSubscribe to like to
