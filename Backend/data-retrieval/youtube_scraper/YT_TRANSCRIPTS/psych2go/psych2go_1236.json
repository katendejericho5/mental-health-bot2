    "transcript": "- [Woman] This is Psy\nand he is just like you.\nSometimes Psy feels terribly down.\nThere always seems to be something\nthat is whirling in his mind,\nsucking away his energy.\nOther times Psy feels at peace, happy.\nHe's grateful for what is around him\nand enjoys the company\nof those whom he trusts.\nThrough many challenges,\nwhether it's related to relationships,\nfamily, work or school Psy\nleaps through them head on.\nThough it may be painful\nto deal with at the moment\nthese obstacles help him grow,\nmaking him stronger every single day.\nEver wonder why there's\na plant on his head?\nWell think of Psy as us humans,\nand the plant as our mental health.\nWithout adequate nutrients and care\nthe plant withers and wilts.\nBut if we constantly water it\nin the form of mindfulness practices,\nself love, forgiveness and encouragement\nthe plant sprouts and proliferates.\nDon't forget to water your plant."
