    "transcript": "hey psych2goers have you ever wondered\nif your family is toxic\nin past videos we've outlined a few\ntraits of toxic parents but toxicity can\nalso describe family systems a family is\na group of parents and children living\ntogether as a unit in this structure the\nparents control the power dynamic and\nthey're responsible for the safety and\nwell-being of the children\nbut what if you have a dysfunctional and\ntoxic family environment in today's\nvideo we'll talk about a couple of\nexamples of toxic family dynamics number\none the picture perfect family\nthis family dynamic is all about\nappearances and paints an unrealistic\npicture of perfection by sweeping\narguments and resentments under the rug\nwhile everyone appears to be doing well\neverything is falling apart there's no\nauthenticity within this family dynamic\nand actions are performative\nfamily members are likely to curate\ntheir life to appear perfect or\nacceptable in other people's eyes this\ndynamic is toxic as it places undue\nemotional strain on those who are in it\nparents may even exercise a degree of\npsychological abuse towards their\nchildren who can grow up believing that\nlove is conditional an example of\ntoxicity in this family dynamic is when\nparents hide a serious issue such as a\ndivorce affair or financial struggle and\npressure their children to maintain the\nlie so they'll not look bad\nnumber two the disconnected family\nthe disconnected family has no\nparent-child connection\nparents are either emotionally or\nphysically absent from their children's\nlives the parent behaves more like a\nroommate providing the bare necessities\nfor their child and failing to provide\nemotional guidance and support\nthey do not nurture the child so the\nchild grows up nurturing themselves\nas a result the child grows up\nemotionally distant from others and they\nhave difficulty being vulnerable and\nstruggle to show up emotionally for\nothers an example of a disconnected\nfamily dynamic is a parent who solely\nfocuses on work and neglects to forge a\nrelationship with their child\nnumber three the chaotic family\nthis type of family system lacks\nstability which may arise from sudden\ndivorce or financial struggle thus\nburdening the parent with\nresponsibilities and distancing them\nfrom their child\nconsequently children who grew up with\nthese dynamics are incredibly\nindependent yet feel unsettled they're\naccustomed to always being ready to run\nso settling down is difficult\nas a result of living in a state of\nchaos they tend to process their\nemotions differently or not at all and\ncan default to dissociation to cope\nan example of a chaotic family dynamic\nis an abusive household where the parent\nis overwhelmed and unable to fulfill\ntheir role properly\nnumber four the child parent dynamic\nthis dynamic is also a product of an\nunstable family where the child assumes\nthe role of the parent this act of\nparentification may arise naturally\nwhere the child may notice the lack of\nstability from their parent and assume\nthat role to protect a younger sibling\nor may be enforced an example of this\ndynamic is if the parent struggles with\naddiction the circumstances in that\nfamily force the child to assume the\nrole of the parent or the parent may not\nbe emotionally mature enough to handle\ncertain situations so they leave it up\nto the child\na child growing up in this type of\nfamily becomes incredibly responsible\nbut also reluctant to lean on others and\nopen up emotionally in relationships\nthey often have a hard time expressing\ntheir emotional needs and usually assume\nblame for everything\nunfortunately the media glorifies\nparentified children as mature but this\nidea of parentified children is harmful\nbecause it undermines the reality a\nchild has been robbed of their innocence\nand childhood\nnumber five the messy split family\nthis type of family dynamic is an\nextension of the previous one and is\ncommon within divorced families\nif the divorce is not amicable it can\nquickly become messy a messy divorce can\ncreate toxicity for the child planting\nresentments or undermining the other\nparent which creates strain for the\nchild and deprives them of a sense of\nstability\nchildren who grow up in this way have\ndifficulties creating lasting\nrelationships developing trust issues\nand believe that happy and healthy\nrelationships do not exist\nand number six the codependent\nthis dynamic involves an aggressor or\nabusive parent and an enabling parent\nwho stays in the relationship out of\nfear\nthe child witnesses the power struggles\nwithin the relationship and may assume\nthat they're normal they may also grow\nup resenting their parent for not\nprotecting them\nas a result they may struggle with trust\nissues and fear being taken advantage of\nhave any of these points helped you\nlet us know in the comments
