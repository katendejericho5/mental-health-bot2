    "transcript": "- [Narrator] - Hey Psych2Goers!\nToday we'll be diving into\nthe topic of being bi-curious.\nIs it the same as bisexual?\nHas someone close to you just come\nout about their sexual orientation?\nAre you also wondering the same?\nBi-curious is yet\nanother lesser known term\non the sexuality spectrum.\nTo identify as bi-curious\nis to be actively experimenting\nor even having just begun\nto evaluate your sexual preference.\nBeing bisexual, you have it ascertained\nthat you prefer both genders.\nBut wait, if that preference\nis inconsistent or fleeting\nthen that could be a\nnudge towards bi-curious.\nNumber one, testing the waters.\nFor some people your\nown sexual orientation\ncan be an area unexplored.\nYou tend to be curious about\nyour sexual preference.\nFor example, you can be interested\nin developing relationships by searching\nfor partners that may be unusual to you.\nIn short, you're exploring your own self\nby being open to experimenting.\nThis helps you determine\nwhether you are bisexual\nor identify with another form\nof sexual attraction altogether.\nNumber two, being uncertain.\nIs your sexual preference,\na regular occurrence\nor is it only an occasional\nfleeting thought?\nThe main difference between bisexual\nand bi-curious is that\nbisexuals have already\ndetermined their identity and goal.\nWhereas, bi-curious\nindividuals may not have\nhad enough experience yet\nin order to come to a conclusion.\nYou might only have just begun\nto explore your preferences.\nFiguring out one's sexual\norientation can also be influenced\nby other factors,\nsuch as considering\nsomeone else's personality\nversus their sexuality.\nNumber three, taking time.\nIt's always okay to think\nthrough things slowly.\nNot everyone can define their\nsexual orientation right away.\nIt might look like you are\nthe only one still unsure.\nYou might feel pressured\nto reach a conclusion\nas everyone around you already has.\nHowever, you will find it's a\nprocess that needs no rushing.\nAccording to a study in\n2021, some people started out\nby focusing on a certain type\nthat they were attracted to.\nThen they connected with\nthem as an exploration.\nStill others may look\nfor a common interest\nor profiles to figure out.\nNumber four, seeking advice.\nBeing bi-curious can result\nin two different kinds of feelings,\neither feeling proud or shameful.\nConstantly oscillating\nbetween preferences can\nmake you feel confused.\nYour surroundings can also play a part\nin exerting pressure\non you, especially when\nyou seem to be the only\none going through this.\nHowever, there is\nnothing to be ashamed of.\nFor many men and women seeking help\nthrough therapy sessions\ncan be a possible way\nto regain comfort or\nconfidence in their lives.\nAnd number five, being yourself.\nIt's also possible that a\nperson may not be bisexual\nafter being bi-curious.\nA study finding suggests that\nbecause of having various ways\nto explore with other people\nsome may even end up identifying\nthemselves as pansexual.\nNo matter what conclusion\nyou come up with,\njust be yourself.\nWere you aware of this term before?\nIf so, do you resonate\nwith the points and examples mentioned?\nWhat's the biggest\nstruggle you go through?\nFeel free to leave a comment down below\nwith your thoughts,\nexperiences, or suggestions.\nIf you find this video helpful\nbe sure to hit the like\nbutton and share it\nwith those out there\nusing, or being subjected\nto these phrases.\nDon't forget to subscribe, to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more new videos.\nAs always, thanks for\nwatching, see you next time!"
