    "transcript": "hi psych2goers\nhave you ever paid attention to your\ninner voice you know that little voice\ninside of you that reminds you of your\nyounger self\nno matter how old you are you carry a\nyounger version of yourself within you\nwhich is also known as your inner child\nyour inner child is an extremely\nimportant and large part of who you are\nhow you deal with emotions and your own\nprogramming and beliefs as an adult the\nthings that have affected you as a child\nmay manifest themselves in adulthood\nif you were taught that love was\nsomething to be earned then you may stay\nin an unhealthy relationship or\nenvironment as an adult because you\ndon't believe that you deserve healthy\nand nurturing love so to help you heal\nfrom some of the wounds you may have had\nas a child here are five things your\ninner child needs to hear right now\nnumber one\nit's okay to have feelings and to\nexpress them\nas a child you may not have had\nauthority figures that placed importance\non your emotions and feelings the only\nthing that may have mattered was that\nyou were fed clothed and had a roof over\nyour head therefore any kind of honest\nemotional display may have been seen as\na challenge to their rule which could\nresult in getting your feelings hurt\ngrowing up in this kind of environment\ncan create a belief that your emotions\nare irrelevant\nthat they should not be expressed and\nthat it will only inspire anger in\nothers this cycle of shame may continue\ninto adulthood where you become unable\nto express your own anger and sadness\nand fear of being ridiculed\nfor this reason it's important you now\ncreate a safe space for yourself where\nyou can express acknowledge and accept\nhow you feel\n2.\nyou are safe\ndid you move around a lot as a kid if so\nyou may have experienced a lot of\nanxiety and worry about going to new\nplaces or about not knowing when or why\nyou were moving even if you were around\nyour family or guardians you may have\nstill felt alone unsafe and unprotected\nbecause of the uncertainty of where you\nwere going to stay\nwhile not all of your issues regarding\nsafety may come from the physical the\nmain focus is that your inner child\nneeds to feel safe\nhaving a place that won't change or\nwhere you have a say on where you're\ngoing to go provide stability and a\nsense of security sometimes because of\nthe lack of defense from the outside you\nmay find yourself needing to find safety\nin routines hobbies health practices and\nyour own emotions when you tell yourself\nthat you're safe you're also reminding\nyourself that you're worthy of\nprotection\nnumber three it's not your fault when\nother people are in a bad mood\nchildren don't really have the cognitive\nability to self-regulate or be aware of\nemotional boundaries when something\nhappens to you as a child you may\ninternalize it so if someone especially\nany authority figure was mean or lashed\nout you may have believed that it was\nyour fault for being bad this belief is\nharmful because it leads to a type of\nthinking that other people's emotions\nare your responsibility and that you\nmust tread lightly around them because\nof it and when you form a habit of\nwalking on eggshells around people's\nfeelings it leads to people-pleasing\ntendencies\nyou go along to get along because you're\nafraid to be known as someone who hurts\npeople's feelings but it can also lead\nto a lack of identity and sense of self\nas you heal your inner child learning\nabout emotional boundaries and when\nresponsibility starts and ends is a\ngreat tool for self-confidence and\nself-validation number four\ni hear you and i see you\ndid you feel invisible as a child\nif your childhood involved conditional\nlove emotional manipulation tactics and\na disregard for the individual\nthen you may have been taught that you\nmust prove that you're worthy of love by\nperforming in a certain way feeling\ninvisible to the people who love you and\nwho are supposed to love you can be\nheartbreaking especially when you were a\nchild since you may not understand why\nit's happening and believe that it's\nbecause there's something wrong with you\nso to heal from feeling unseen and\nunheard you must acknowledge and accept\nhow certain memories affected and still\naffect you and learn to value your own\nopinions and thoughts and be more\nencouraging to your younger self and\nnumber five i love you did your loved\nones tell you that they loved you when\nyou were young\nyou might have never heard that phrase\ndirected at you before as a child or you\nmight have but it came with some\ncondition or favor\nperhaps they'd say things like you know\ni love you right so can you please go\nand do this for me\nnot having been told that you're loved\nunconditionally by your guardians or\nparents or having been raised in an\nenvironment where emotions were seen as\nweakness can make any child feel like\nthey aren't lovable or worthy of love\nthis is why it's important to show that\ninner child love and to say it out loud\nit may\nmight it probably will feel\nuncomfortable and silly at first it may\nseem like you're lying to yourself at\nfirst\nbut\nover time you may start to feel a little\nmore comfortable about it and become\nmore okay with the concept of loving\nyourself unconditionally\nyour inner child needs and deserves to\nbe reminded of your love\ndid you find this video helpful let us\nknow in the comments below also be sure\nto like subscribe and share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it
