    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2goers.\nYou know the feeling,\nyou've seen the meme,\nthe dog with coffee in the flaming room.\nThis is fine.\nEven still the shot of the arm emerging\nfrom quick sand giving a thumbs up.\nYou may think, \"oh, that\nis so me right now.\"\nTruth is, society has set expectations\nthat make achieving\nthat state of happiness\nfar more arduous than it should be.\nSo we do what most do,\nput on our fake it till you make it hats,\nso often we forget it's on.\nIt's time to unveil the truth\nand stop the masquerade.\nWe're going to look at some\nsigns to help make it happen.\nNumber one, talking about\nemotions makes you squirm.\nDo you subconsciously believe\nemotions make you weak?\nThough, this myth is something\nwe're finally starting to decry,\nit's still long time ingrained\nand a tough one to beat.\nSadness and anger are normal\nemotions that are felt,\nyet many of us actively try to stop it.\nNever feeling comfortable revealing\nthis perceived loss of control.\nIf this is you, then this might be a sign\nthat you're faking your happiness.\nSome good news about feeling\nanger and sadness though,\nit's not weak, it's human.\nGenuine serenity and balance\nare achieved in large part,\nthrough the ability to let go,\nexpressing our true feelings.\nNumber two, constantly\nshowing the good times,\ninstead of living them.\nDo you know someone\nwhose entire involvement\nin any event or hangout is\nposting constant updates\nand selfies yet never doing the activity?\nThe post even reads, \"that party life\"\nor is captioned, \"hiking fills my soul.\"\nDespite you knowing they left\nthe party after taking the pic\nor they didn't even\nhike more than 10 steps.\nYou probably already you surmised this,\nbut that contentment may be put on.\nFake happy alert.\nA recent study looked across\n11 social media networks,\nwhich include the big names\nlike Facebook, Twitter\nand Instagram, and found that heavy users\nare far more likely to be lonely\nand unhappy than light users.\nIs your happiness heavily\ndependent on making envious?\nWell, constantly promoting\nor creating a sense\nof superiority online or offline,\nleaves no room for genuine joy.\nReal happiness comes from the self,\nnot by leaching envy from others.\nNumber three, you're not yourself anymore.\nYou look in the mirror\none day and realize,\nyou have no idea who you\nare, but you used to.\nMany unhappy people\ntend to lose themselves\nin the process of faking their happiness.\nThey hurdle head on into the myth\nthat happiness comes\nfrom outside validation.\nIn a relatively short period of time,\nthey strip and change everything\nfrom clothes to hobbies,\nbecause they don't fit the\nnew and improved image.\nSubsequently, they also\ndistanced themselves\nfrom old friends that remind them\nof the dissatisfactory original.\nWhat's really happened is\nthat instead of working\nwith the identity and self that\nwas given, it was discarded.\nAll that's left is an\nartificial new you persona,\ncreated in order to fit in with\nthe perceived better crowd.\nHave you ever wanted to increase your\nown level of happiness?\nOr maybe you'd like to do\nsomething in particular\nto help raise your joy and wellbeing.\nOr maybe you've always\nwanted to experience\nan Ivy league education\nwithout the commitment.\nYale university is\noffering an online course,\ncalled The Science of Well-Being.\nWhere Dr. Santos reveals\ncertain misconceptions\nabout happiness and recommends tips\nfor increasing happiness,\nsuch as savoring our everyday experiences\nand appreciating them while they happen,\nas well as encouraging\nrandom acts of kindness.\nThese are just small snippets\nof what the course has to offer.\nIf you like this video\nand wanna learn more\nabout how to go from fake happy\nto increasing your own\nwellbeing and productivity,\nthen you should check out\nthe science of wellbeing.\nDid we also mention that\nover 3 million people\nhave enrolled and it's\nthe online equivalent\nto their most popular on-campus course?\nThe course is comp completely online,\nself-paced, and the best part yet,\nyou can earn a certificate\nfrom Yale upon completion.\nSo make sure you click\nthe description box below\nto check the course out.\nNumber four, you want everyone\noff your lawn, always.\nThere's nothing wrong\nwith wanting alone time.\nSome get energy from parties,\nsome recharge in solitude,\nand that's all good.\nLong term social isolation\nthough, is too far.\nPerhaps you believe,\nI'm better off on my own\nor I don't need anyone,\nI'm happy with just me.\nReally though, this is likely more a sign\nof faking your happiness\nand avoiding being called out on it.\nMaking an effort to meet new people\nor reconnect with old friends,\nmay help you start\nfeeling genuinely content,\nby challenging yourself\nto stay more connected\nto those around you.\nHumans are social creatures.\nRemember, even if it's just being social\nwith your two closest\nfriends and a once a month,\ntwo minute chat with dog owners\nat the off leash park,\nthat's still social.\nPutting yourself out\nthere can take effort,\nbut it's well worth it.\nNumber five, you're\nexhausted all the time.\nYou're fatigued, had a rough\nday and you're stressed.\nGot it.\nIt happens.\nHowever, if this is your\neveryday, all day norm,\nit might be a sign of psychological\nor medical issues, like sleep apnea.\nMental health-wise, fatigue\nis a typical symptom\nfor individuals who are\nbattling anxiety or depression.\nSo if you find yourself\nrepeatedly claiming\nthat you're fine and cheerful,\nwhen you're near to exhaustion,\ntake a closer look at\nwhat else could be there.\nAnd number six, you are developing\nnew addictions and vices.\nIs retail therapy putting\nyou in crippling debt?\nHas drowning your sorrows with whiskey\nand wine become a\nconstant life requirement?\nIf so, you might be self-medicating\nto fake the happiness.\nThe life of the party may\nnot actually be loving life,\nand the consistent nightlife wild child,\ncould be doing it to cope with depression.\nIn these situations, excessive drinking\nor drug use may be an attempt to escape\nfrom reality and avoid feeling\nthe truth of the matter.\nAny habit that goes into excessive\nlife interrupting territory,\ncould well be a form of escapism,\nwhere you are avoiding instead of dealing.\nYou've likely heard the saying\nthat nothing good ever came easy.\nAnd part of that is admitting\nthat you're troubled\nby something more significant\nthan you're letting on.\nResolution is good and acknowledgement\nis the first step towards it.\nFaking happiness doesn't\nalways mean mental illness.\nThe most significant clue is to analyze\nand discover why you are pretending.\nWho are you deceiving?\nIs there anything deeper behind it?\nHow many of these points in\nthis video can you relate to?\nBe compassionate and honest with yourself.\nDiscovering answers to these kinds\nof questions is crucial\nto the get happy process.\nAnd no one said you have\nto go it alone either.\nReach out to anyone, from a trusted friend\nor family member, to a\nprofessional therapist,\nwho may be the right person to assist you.\nA big shout out to Coursera\nfor sponsoring this video\nand offering a Yale university\ncourse to our viewers.\nDo you relate to any of the signs above?\nDo you have more signs to share?\nLeave your comments below\nand as always, thanks\nso much for watching.\nSee you next time."
