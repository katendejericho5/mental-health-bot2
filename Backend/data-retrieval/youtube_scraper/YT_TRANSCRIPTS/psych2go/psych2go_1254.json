    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hello, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back.\nHave you ever caught yourself\nsaying something manipulative to someone\nto get what you want?\nSometimes you might not realize\nthat some of the things you\nsay and do are manipulative.\nInstead, you may notice\nfriends going distant\nand relationships being at risk.\nSo if you've been questioning\nyour own actions lately,\nhere are six signs you're\nmanipulative without realizing it.\nNumber one, you're kind of a know-it-all.\nDo you often feel that\npeople should follow you\nbecause you are the one that knows best?\nOr perhaps you have this constant urge\nto put yourself first\nin every circumstance?\nAs a result, this tendency\nmay make other people see you\nas selfish and a know-it-all,\nwhich may cause them to turn away\nand avoid spending time with you.\nFor this reason, it's good to\nlook at how you treat people.\nYou may not be aware of this behavior\nas it may have developed unconsciously.\nFor instance, having the upper hand\nmay be your way to mask your insecurities.\nOr you may be unconsciously\nimitating the behavior\nof your strict parents who made you obey\ntheir every demand growing up.\nSo take time off and focus on yourself.\nWhen you become more\nconfident in yourself,\nyou may find that you will no longer need\nto outshine everyone all the time.\nNumber two, you shower\nsomeone with affection,\nthen pull back if they do something wrong.\nHave you avoided someone after an argument\nto prove that you don't need them?\nIs it your way to tell them\nthat they should be the\none to go to you first\nif they wanna make up?\nThis is a push and pull type of behavior\nwhere you make someone feel happy\nwhen they're doing something right,\nbut then pull back to punish them\nwhen they do something wrong.\nYou might do this because it can give you\na sense of control over others,\nbut this tactic is toxic and manipulative\nand can seriously harm\nsomeone's mental health.\nNumber three, you're very adamant\nabout getting what you want.\nDo you go to extreme lengths\nto get what you want?\nLet's say you want candy,\nbut others want chocolate.\nSo what do you do?\nSomeone who is manipulative\nmay decide to throw out all the chocolate\nso nobody gets a choice.\nIn the same sense, a constant\nurge to be in control\nmay cause you to do just about anything,\nincluding lying, guilt\ntripping, and blaming\nto get what you want.\nBut whenever you catch yourself\nthinking of doing any of this,\nit may be helpful to just stop.\nBreathe and take a step back.\nGive yourself some time to think.\nThese moments of self-awareness\nand reflection can aid\nyou in moving forward.\nAfter all, changing your\nhabits may not be easy,\nbut it is doable and you\nare more than capable\nof achieving it.\nNumber four, jealousy makes\nyou do problematic things.\nHow do you respond to jealousy?\nIf you saw some friends\nhanging out without you,\nwould you feel offended and purposefully\ngo out with someone else\nto take heaps of photos\njust to flaunt them on\nsocial media for them to see?\nManipulative people have\nissues with jealousy.\nWhen you feel like you are\nnot on top of a situation,\nyou create another one\nthat you can control.\nEven if it's at the expense\nof your own relationships.\nIn moments like these, it\nmay help to give yourself\nsome time and space to\ncome to terms with the fact\nthat not everything other\npeople do is related to you.\nKnow your own self worth first\nso you won't feel threatened\nwhen others don't.\nNumber five, you never say\nwhat you want outright.\nDo you find yourself guilt tripping others\ninto doing you favors?\nAccording to Barham,\nmanipulation can arise from an inability,\nor at least a reluctance, to simply say\nwhat it is you're feeling or needing.\nThis behavior may come\nfrom underlying anxiety,\ninsecurity, or a strict\nchildhood upbringing.\nStrict parents who don't\nlet their children open up\nmay bring up people who avoid\nconfrontation completely.\nIn this case, you might find it helpful\nto contact a therapist to talk\nto and address your problems.\nTake it step by step.\nYou can handle this.\nAnd number six, you use\nrelationships as bait.\nHave you ever said to someone\nthat they should do something for you\nif they really loved and cared about you?\nIf so, then you are using\nyour own relationships\nas bait to get something you want.\nWhenever you do this,\nyou're basically saying\nthat if they don't do what you want,\nthen you'll break things off with them.\nThis is a deeply hurtful\nand unkind thing to do,\nespecially to the people who you love.\nAs mentioned earlier,\nit is highly possible\nthat you are not aware that\nyou're even doing these things.\nThat's why it's good to have\na keen sense of awareness\nabout your own actions.\nRespect others and find ways\nto build your self-esteem.\nRemember that all of this is\npart of your journey, growth.\nSo did you relate to one\nor more of these points?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share
