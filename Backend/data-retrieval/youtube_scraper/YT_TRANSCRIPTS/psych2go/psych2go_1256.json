    "transcript": "- [Lady] Hey, there's Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to another\nvideo from Psych2Go,\naiming to make everyday\npsych more fathomable.\nSo let's begin.\nEven though you might learn\nlife lessons over time\non your own,\nwouldn't you wish that\nthere is a way to see ahead\nor perhaps a future where you could just\ntell the current you how to navigate life?\nWhat are some life lessons\nthat you've experienced?\nIf you want a path to\na more meaningful life,\nthere are 10 lessons about\nlife that people feel\nthey learned a little too late.\nOne, you attract more abundance\nand joy into your life with gratitude.\nHow grateful do you feel about\nthe good things in your life?\nHave you tried noting it down?\nA gratitude journal has\nbeen reported to help many\nas noting it down\nmay make them more\naware of other positives\nor could it be some cosmic\nor spiritual force at work?\nWhatever it may be.\nIt's something worth working on.\nYou can always use more\npositives in your life.\nAnd much of that starts\nwith a grateful attitude.\nTwo, approach challenges\nwith the attitude that\nyou're already successful.\nDo challenges make you nervous?\nThat's understandable,\nthe whole definition of\na challenge is that it's not easy.\nIt's a competition.\nYou versus an unknown, like a new job,\na new skill, or a new city,\nare all normal life changes.\nWe tend to fear the unknown\nand that fear makes this\nall the more difficult.\nWhat do we fear?\nOften it's the fear of failure.\nHowever, here's a tip.\nYou can fight this with\na simple mind pack.\ntrick your brain into\nthinking, I'm confident\nand can see the potential\nto achieve my goal.\nFocusing on that will reduce your fears.\n(bell ringing)\nThree, by failing to prepare,\nyou're preparing to fail.\nWhen you hear save for a rainy day,\nwhat do you think of?\nA paycheck tucked away?\nMaybe you should lay\nout all the stuff you need\nfor a big interview tomorrow.\nThe truth is, life is unpredictable,\nwhich makes it fun,\nyet somewhat stressful.\nThinking ahead and planning\nmay help to reduce anxiety\nas it gives an answer to the questioning\nand worried anticipation\nthat anxiety often brings.\nFour, productivity\nrequires relaxing at times.\nEver seen someone boasting\nabout being busy, busy, busy?\nIt's like being busy is a badge of honor.\nAnd really it's actually\na badge of burnout.\nAn article posted by Tony Schwartz,\nin the New York Times explains\nthat we have the ability\nto recharge our energy\nstores simply by relaxing\nand that doing so is more\nvaluable than the alternative.\nBasically take some time for yourself\nand don't beat yourself up about it.\nFive, our journeys are all\nunique and incomparable.\nFOMO, or fear of missing out,\nseems to be common these days,\nmaybe too common.\nNo matter what it is specifically,\ncomparing your situation to someone else's\nor to an arbitrary societal\nnorm makes you feel bad.\nOur timelines are all personal and unique\nso you can flourish in your\nown way and at your own pace,\nyou're not missing out on anything.\nYou own your journey and no one else.\nSix, sometimes change\ncan shockingly be good.\nWanna hear something ironic?\nThe only consistency in life is change.\nAnd if you're avoiding change,\nyou're avoiding living\nlife to the fullest.\nChange can be scary,\nyet it's also necessary for growth.\nThrough change we gain new perspectives\nand bring forth new and\nexciting opportunities in life.\nSo take a deep breath, put on\na brave face and go for it.\nYou've got this.\nSeven, you're the master\nof your happiness.\nIf we were to ask someone\nwith more life experience\nthan us about happiness,\nwhat do you think they'd say?\nAn article in an Ohio newspaper\nfeaturing a 90 year old\nwoman, discussed this.\nOne of the lessons in the article was\nthat relying on external\nthings to come along\nand make us happy will only\nbring us more suffering.\n\"No one is in charge of\nyour happiness, except you,\"\nshe was quoted.\nEight, money can't buy you lasting joy,\neven though having money can\nhelp you open a few doors\nin life and make you feel secure.\nIt won't truly make you happy in the end.\nMaterial things like an\nexpensive watch or clothing\nmay make you feel momentarily happy\nbut the happiness won't last long.\nWhat makes us truly happy\nare things like family,\nfriends, community,\nauthentic connections, a\nsense of purpose and meaning.\nAnd self-actualization.\nNine, the less you care\nwhat others think, the happier you'll be.\nYou often obsess and\nworry about what others\nmight think of you.\nUsually, what other people do to you\nhas nothing to do with you,\nbut their own insecurity.\nIf someone doesn't like\nyou, that's all right\nbecause you're not living\nyour life for them.\nYou're living for yourself.\nYou alone have power\nover how you feel.\nAnd 10, be unapologetically you.\nHave you ever wished you could be\nlike someone else?\nThat put together friend?\nOr even the social media influencer\nwho makes everything look easy.\nA study by Guler Boyraz in 2014\nconcluded that those\nwho are more authentic\nto themselves showed\ngreater life satisfaction\nat a later point.\nYou know what the world is in need of?\nA unique and awesome you.\nIt may be scary to be\nvulnerable and authentic\nbut it's worth it.\nAre any of these lessons,\nyou've already applied\nin your life?\nIf not, do you plan to?\nWhat are some things you're\nworking on right now?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nDon't forget to share this\nvideo with someone who might\nbenefit from it.\nLike and subscribe to Psych2Go\nfor are more helpful videos like this.\nAnd as always, thanks for watching.\nSee you in the next video."
