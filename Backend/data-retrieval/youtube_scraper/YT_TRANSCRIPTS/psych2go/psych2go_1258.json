    "transcript": "- [Narrator] When you\nthink, \"Survival mode\",\nit's natural to think of\na sudden animal attack\nor earthquake,\nso when you find you're\nnot getting things done\nor the dishes are pulling up,\nyou usually scold yourself for being lazy,\nbecause as far as you know,\nthere really aren't\ncrocodiles in the toilet,\nbut, did you know your body\nwill go into survival mode,\nactivating the lizard part of your brain\nif anything overloads it\nto indicate your demise might be imminent?\nThis can include things\nlike prolonged grief,\nsevere abuse, or prolonged burnout.\nThis survival state is\nlike booting in safe mode,\nessential functions only.\nNot sure if you're in\nsurvival mode or just lazy?\nHere are some signs to help\nyou tell the difference.\nNumber one, lack of focus or, \"What?\nWhat happened?\nWhere am I?\"\nDid you just read that page 10 times\nand still don't know what it was about?\nPeople call your name\nand you don't hear them?\nYou are so zoned out you can't\nseem to get anything done,\neven though you're normally\npretty good with this?\nYou just might be in survival\nmode instead of being lazy.\nYour higher function\nbrain is getting shut down\nin favor of base survival,\nso that project\nor calculus homework is just\nnot getting the priority\nfor thinking juice.\nNumber two, forgetting basic needs.\nYou look at yourself\nand realize, \"(sighs) I\nhaven't brushed my teeth today\nand I haven't showered for three days.\nDid I eat today?\"\nBeing in survival mode\nleaves you feeling drained\nand unable to perform your\ndaily activities well,\ndue to a lack of physical\nand emotional resources.\nNumber three.\nYou feel more tired than\nexpected all the time.\nDo you feel exhausted,\neven though you haven't\ndone anything strenuous?\nYou haven't been to a boot camp\nand you aren't training for the Olympics,\nyet you are starting\nto relate to Han Solo,\nstuck in carbonite, both\nphysically and mentally.\nThis could well be survival\nmode trying to conserve energy.\nYou feel tired, so survival mode screams,\n\"Conserve energy!\nStay still!\nSleep!\"\nBut that ends up making\nyou feel even more tired,\nso the lizard brain continues trying\nto make you conserve energy,\nthe only way it knows how.\nNumber four.\nYou're reacting more\nemotionally than usual.\nwhether you're normally\nchill or natural manic pixie,\nyou know when you're more\nreactive than normal.\nIf you found yourself getting snappy\nor lashing out at things\nthat mean nothing to you\nor found yourself bursting out\ninto tears for no reason whatsoever,\nthere's a good chance this\nis survival brain at work.\nWhen you are in survival mode,\nour brains react impulsively\nin order to keep us alive.\nIt tries to convince us\nthat if we use executive\nfunctioning skills\nto process the information,\nsafety will not be guaranteed.\nNumber five.\nWait, what was the point again?\nOh, memory issues.\nHave you ever felt that you have no idea\nand don't even remember what\nyou were doing yesterday?\nYou might feel disconnected and foggy\nand if anyone asks you something simple,\nsomething you know you know,\nand your only response is a blank stare\nbecause you can't remember,\n♪ Dun dun dun ♪\nsurvival brain.\nTrauma can affect your memory\nand make remembering the who what wheres\nof your daily life very difficult.\nAnd number six, you can only\nconsider one task at a time.\nNormally, you are a\nmultitasking superpower.\nYou can write a paper while listening\nto an audiobook and sneak\nin regular sips of coffee,\nexcept lately, you can't.\nIn fact, the only way you\ncan do anything right now is\nconsidering one task at a time.\nGet in line, single file please.\nJust like putting your\nsmartphone on battery saving mode\nso it doesn't have\nbackground whatnots going on\nand isn't doing multiple\nthings like messages, emails\nand scheduling texts all at once,\nyour brain is going into\nbrain battery saving mode.\nSpeed has been reduced\nand multitasking is no longer possible.\nLet's sum it up with a quote\nfrom author Nakeia Homer,\n\"You are not lazy, unmotivated or stuck.\nAfter years of living in\nsurvival mode, you are exhausted.\nThere's a difference.\"\nSuperficially, being\nin a survival mode can\nresemble our perceived notions\nof being lazy.\nThis is why it's so important\nto find out why certain actions\nor inactions are happening.\nIs it really conscious avoidance\nor are they just trying to cling to life,\nperhaps not even knowing they're\ndoing what they're doing?\nWhat we do know is that being\nin constant survival mode is\nneither healthy, nor happy,\nso it's necessary to clear\nout that which ails us\nby making small changes.\nSeeing a professional can\nalso help us get started\non this journey.\nDid any of these points click with you?\nWhat kind of insight has it given\non something you've seen or heard\nin yourself or someone else?\nShare, discuss and comment,\nwe'd love to hear from you.\nThanks for watching and see you soon."
