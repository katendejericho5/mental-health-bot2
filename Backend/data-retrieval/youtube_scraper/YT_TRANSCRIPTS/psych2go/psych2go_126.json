    "transcript": "[Music]\nlook at that guy that influencer that\ncool girl does nothing affect them how\nare they Untouched by everything that's\nhappened am I defective we look at these\npeople and even if we won't admit it out\nloud we want to be that tough wouldn't\nit be great if we could be like that\njust\nall eat that problems well have we got a\nsecret to share with you don't be\nenvious of them because it's all inact\nwhat we see as tough and as mental\nstrength is usually the exact opposite\nwe can shatter that illusion with these\nobservations so you too can see what\nmental strength isn't it's just posing\nnumber one their selfworth depends\npurely on what others think of them oh\nthere's a window check hair a side\nmirror check teeth a large puddle check\nand recheck walk and posture yeah that\nperson they're always in any situation\npulling out a new act or routine to grab\nthe spotlight perhaps you thought this\nperson is awfully loud and insistent\nabout how much something doesn't bother\nthem that they don't need to prove\nanything no one even asked them come on\nyou know you've seen it that's not a\nmentally tough person that act and that\nlook are just as much to convince\nthemselves as anyone else they've made\nthemselves completely dependent on\nothers to their value the mentally\nstrong don't need to pose and Proclaim\nthat they're strong they just are\nthey're their own appraisers and don't\nneed others to tell them what they're\nworth they can fearlessly ask for help\nor appear different because they know\nthat self-improvement doesn't lessen or\nchange their value being able to intake\nKnowledge from others instead of\ndrowning it out with self aggrandizing\nstatements lets them learn and become\neven stronger number two they think that\nthey can do anything\nnow there is a difference between being\nconfident and being arrogant\nunfortunately the two are often\nmistakenly taken as one and the same no\nthey are very different essentially it's\nthe difference between those who know\nthey can do or at least learn to do just\nabout anything and then there are those\nwho only think they know everything and\nbelieve they're experts the posing tough\nactor can be recognized by the sweeping\nabsolutes that leave no room for\nimprovement M because they are the\nMasters it often sounds like I can do\nanything this overestimation of their\ntalents and underestimation of effort\ninvolved to achieve their objective will\noften have them quitting early and\nblaming others for their failures don't\nfall for it whatever happens it probably\nwasn't your fault the mentally strong\nare ready to accept that there will be\nwork and they'll have to overcome\nobstacles whether that be time Prejudice\nor their own learning curves they\nacknowledge that they do have limits and\nwork within them they can be trusted to\ndeliver what they say they can number\nthree hidden or denied insecurities so\nif they're never insecure they're like\nsuper strong right wrong nope never\ninsecure about\nanything sounds more like they're hiding\nsomething or they're exceptionally\ndelusional and unable to deserve\nshortcomings which can be harmful for\nthemselves and others the mentally\nstrong are perfectly aware and accepting\nthat they aren't infallible people are\nimperfect because things are always\nchanging and there's a need to\nconstantly evolve like the X-Men unlike\nthe X-Men though humans aren't born with\nan evolutionary jump start so the\nmentally strong identify their own needs\nImprovement areas rolls up their sleeves\nand then gets to work the ones who\nrefuse to bend at all scowl scoff sulk\nand insist on indifference are the ones\nwho deep down are terrified they're\nscared that if they admit they have\ninsecurities it'll Crush their little\nhouse of cards number four their\nemotional expressions are usually a put\non yay that cherry person who is always\nflashing that thousand watt grin is here\nwoohoo there is always a rainbow shining\nand they can make that rainbow happen at\nany time are you exhausted as we are\njust picturing them that constant overly\noptimistic Persona is false in fact if\nseen constantly we might be a little\nworried drugs are bad okay in all\nseriousness though this super strong\nperson who is grinning and ready to go\neven after traumatic events is trying\nway too hard they're denying themselves\ntheir humanity and shoving that Shield\nof happy in your face you know and we\nknow that when reality comes a calling\nthey're going to get bitten hard be\nalways happy always confident never feel\nperson leans on this fakery because they\ndon't trust themselves to have the\nstrength to deal with their emotions\nappropriately hey if they pretend it's\nnot an issue it's not an issue how often\ndoes that work we Hazard to say nearly\nnever the mentally strong will allow\nthemselves to express and feel the full\nrange of emotions keeping that balance\nof positive and and negative\nrealistically they know what they have\nto deal with isn't fun times but it's\ngot to be done so they do it and number\nfive they try to control\nothers it's easy to think of someone who\nis overbearing and demanding as strong\neven the terms used appear to indicate\nit like strong arm or Taskmaster so it\nstands to reason that we reflectively\nview bossy MC boss pants as being\nmentally strong then you would be\nmistaken relieved surprised we get that\nthey exert control on the outside\nbecause of their insecurities on the\ninside they need to visibly see a\nphysical representation or token of\nstrength it's a part of getting that\noutside validation fulfilling what they\ndon't fulfill in themselves that still\ndoesn't make it right and we aren't\nencouraging anyone to be accepting of\nthis we're just giving it some context\nmentally strong people understand and\nmake the best of knowing that they can\ncontrol only themselves and no one else\nthey are good comfortable and okay with\nthat they have their solid stability of\nidentity and Trust in themselves they\ndon't need or want to be responsible and\nin control of others they simply say to\nthe world bring it I can roll with it\nhave you recognized any of these before\ndid this video give you a different\nperspective on anything how please feel\nfree to discuss and comment below we\ncan't wait to catch with you next time"
