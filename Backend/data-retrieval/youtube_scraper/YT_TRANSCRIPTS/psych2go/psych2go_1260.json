    "transcript": "when was the last time that you thought\nabout attraction was it an hour ago five\nminutes 10 seconds\nit's likely that other people are\nthinking about it as much as you are\nhere are seven psychological things we\ndo that make us less\nnumber one acting cool and distant while\nprocrastination might feel good it isn't\nattractive in 1992 two psychologists\nnamed moreland and beech were curious\nabout the relationship between how many\ntimes you see someone and how attractive\nyou find them they had four women\npretend to be students in a large intro\npsych class at the end of the semester\nstudents in the class were asked to rate\nhow attractive they found each of the\nwomen what the researchers found was\nthat the fewer classes a woman attended\nthe less attractive they were rated by\nother students the other students\nbasically forgot about her i'll try and\nremember this study the next time i have\nto psych myself up to go to class\nnumber two acting clingy it's the\nclassic young love phenomenon constantly\nhanging out together\nthree social psychologists from the\nuniversity of california san diego\nconducted a study on the relationship\nbetween people's physical proximity and\nhow much they like each other\nthe researchers made a surprising\ndiscovery they asked students to name\nwho they liked and disliked the\nresearchers found that the students most\nliked people were those who they\nfrequently met face to face but the\nresearchers also found that the\nstudent's least favorite people were\nthose with whom they were forced to\nspend time in other words watch out that\nspending time with your crush doesn't\nend up with you getting on their nerves\nnumber three acting as if you don't like\nyour date all that much\nwhen grandma told you it always pays to\nsmile were her words backed up by\nscience\npsychologist curtis and miller randomly\npaired participants one student in the\npair was led to believe that their\npartner either liked or disliked them\nthose who thought they were liked were\nnicer and their partners ended up liking\nthem more the researchers concluded that\nso-called reciprocal liking is a\nself-fulfilling prophecy if your partner\nthinks you like them they'll be nicer to\nyou which in turn makes the whole\nrelationship better and the opposite is\nalso true if they think that you don't\nlike them they'll be meaner and the\nwhole relationship will suffer\nturns out that grandma was onto\nsomething\nnumber four revealing too much too soon\nin 2011 researchers told female\nundergrads that their facebook profiles\nhad been viewed by male students and\nthat they would now be viewing the\nprofiles of those guys you can probably\nimagine that the women were intrigued\nthe women were split into groups and\nwere told either that he liked their\nprofile or that the researchers didn't\nknow whether he liked their profile the\nwomen were most attracted to the men who\ndidn't reveal whether they liked the\nwomen why the researchers decided that\nthe more the women pondered the\nmysterious man the more he was on their\nmind and the more intrigued they became\naustin power's nickname was actually\npretty honest the magical man of mystery\ndoes get the dates\nnumber five going on boring dates\ntwo psychologists in vancouver canada\ndid a study on misattribution of arousal\nwhich is when people make mistaken\ninferences about what is causing them to\nfeel the way they do they had an\nattractive female research assistant\ngive male participants a questionnaire\nin the first group she asked them the\nquestions while they were on a scary\nsuspension bridge in the second group\nshe asked them while on a low small\nbridge those on the scary bridge were\nmore excited because of the bridge and\nwere more attracted to the research\nassistant and more likely to call her\nlater on your next date don't just get\ncoffee that's boring instead go see\nfireworks or ride go cards\nnumber six using cheesy pickup lines\npsychologists who study attraction have\nidentified three general strategies for\npickup lines cute flippant for example\nyour place or mine innocuous such as\nwhat do you think of the music and\ndirect as in can i buy you lunch a study\nasked men and women which pick up lines\nthey prefer to receive\nmost strategies work for men being\napproached by women however women tend\nto prefer innocuous and direct lines\nover cute flippant ones\nbottom line groaners aren't attractive\nso now you know asking someone did it\nhurt when you fell from heaven is\nscientifically the lamest possible thing\nto say\nnumber seven not having a wingman or\nwing woman\nsome people treat dating like a\ncompetition but did you also know that\nthere's lots of room for cooperation\namong friends\nhaving a third party make the\nintroduction may be the best strategy of\nall for guys trying to pick up women\nespecially in today's dating world where\nthere's more choice than ever daters\nhave to overcome many hurdles in order\nto catch someone's interest\nhaving someone make the introduction for\nyou automatically moves you past the\ndifficult first stage and it makes it\nclear that you're nice enough to have\nfriends\nsorry james bond but in the real world\nthe best romancers work in pairs\nin today's fast-paced dating world\npeople are quickly judged on first\nimpressions but don't worry all you have\nto do is make sure you never do any of\nthese seven unattractive things and\nyou'll do fine although bringing\nchocolates never hurts either\n[Music]\nyou"
