    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hello, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nDo you ever feel sad?\nOf course, we all feel sad sometimes\nand these feelings can come and go.\nAs children, there tends\nto be a lot of firsts,\na friend moving, a low\ngrade, a heartbreak,\nwhich can intensify the feelings\nwith each new experience.\nBut if a teenager, young person, or child\nfeels persistently sad and moody\naffecting the way they do everyday tasks,\nthey may fall into a depressive spiral\nthat goes beyond a short-term\nsituational depression.\nWith that said, here are seven signs\na young child or teen could be depressed.\nNumber one, over reliance on a smartphone.\nDo you take out your phone\nas a source of safety\nwhen you're anxious or\nduring awkward situations?\nPhones are important\nin our daily interactions with the world.\nHowever, heavy smartphone usage\nis also linked to depression.\nWhile busying yourself with your phone\ncan provide instant\ngratification at first,\nit also pulls you away from\nforming meaningful connections,\nand can worsen your mood in the long run.\nIf you spend more time scrolling\nthrough your social media\nthan with actual friends and family,\nit may be time to reassess\nyour smartphone usage.\nNumber two, withdrawal\nfrom friends and family.\nDo you distance yourself from friends\nand family and not open up?\nSocial withdrawal is a\ncommon sign of depression.\nAccording to University of\nKansas professor Stephen Ilardi,\npeople who are clinically depressed\nfeel a strong urge to pull\nback from friends and family,\nwhich can end up worsening\ntheir depression.\nCounteracting the urge\nto withdraw isn't easy\nbut it's the first step to\novercoming feelings of isolation.\nReach out and reconnect with\nyour friends and family.\nYou can do this by scheduling fun hangouts\nwith them and allowing yourself\nto be open with them again.\nIt may be hard at first,\nbut it'll help you to let\npeople in your life again.\nNumber three, difficulty concentrating.\nDo you sometimes feel\nlike you're not paying\nattention to others?\nAccording to behavioral\ntherapist Natasha Santos,\nthe processing speed to take\nin information efficiently\nis impaired when we're depressed.\nWhen parts of the brain\ninvolving memory retrieval\nface irregularities,\ndepressive symptoms like\nconcentration difficulty can occur.\nThis can lead to trouble\nin school and home,\nespecially when no one\nbelieves or supports the child,\nworsening the depressive state.\nNumber four, low energy.\nDo you complain about how\ntired you are all the time?\nAccording to research published\nby Helia Ghanean and others,\nfatigue is a very common occurrence\nfor people who suffer from\nmajor depressive disorder,\naffecting about 90% of\nthose who've been diagnosed.\nLow energy can make it hard\nfor kids to do everyday tasks,\nlike getting outta bed,\nwashing their face,\nor brushing their teeth can also worsen\nwhen the symptoms of depression\nlike failing to eat a proper diet,\nwhich can be a tough cycle to\nbreak if not properly managed.\nNumber five, feelings of guilt.\nDo you often talk about how you feel\nlike you don't deserve nice things?\nFeelings of guilt can cause\na great toll on people,\nespecially young children.\nThis can stem from a troubled\nfamily environment growing\nup, social pressure,\nculture, among a host of other factors.\nBut it doesn't have to be that way,\nand there are many ways to\novercome these feelings.\nReframing the situation with a therapist\nor someone you trust can\nhelp you move past the guilt.\nForgiving yourself and\ntaking responsibility\nalso go a long way.\nNumber six, loss of\ninterest in fun activities.\nHave you stopped participating\nin things you once considered to be fun?\nIf so, you may be experiencing\nsomething called anhedonia,\nor a loss of interest in\nonce pleasurable activities.\nIf a child rapidly develops signs\nof disinterest towards\nlife or their hobbies,\nit could be one of the key\nsymptoms of depression.\nThey could also feel\nother symptomatic signs\nshow up alongside this\ndisinterest, like anxiety,\nstress and overall feelings\nof being stuck in life.\nCombating this will\nrequire taking small steps,\neveryday tasks that make you\na little bit better each time.\nAnd number seven,\nchanges in eating habits.\nYou exhibit poor eating\nhabits, whether you are eating\nand sleeping too much or too little.\nFalling into the extremes\ncan be a sign of depression for kids.\nIn particular, overeating can be a way\nfor some kids to cope\nwith difficult feelings,\nsays clinical psychologist Susan Alberts\nof Cleveland Clinic.\nThe reason why you may look\nfor sugary food and carbs\nis that they help increase\nthe serotonin levels\nin your brain, which boosts\nour mood, temporarily.\nEating too little, on the other hand,\ncan be caused by diminished motivation.\nYou may be feeling too anxious, worried,\nor hopeless about things\ngoing on around you\nthat eating doesn't cross your mind.\nSo do you or anyone you\nknow show these symptoms?\nLet us know in the comments
