    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Do you ever feel\nlike people don't like you?\nRelationships can be incredibly\ndifficult to navigate.\nYou may find some people\nlook the other way when you're around,\nand you can't help but wonder why.\nWhile there are some things you can do\nto improve yourself and your likability,\nthere are other parts of you\nthat you just have to accept.\nWith that said, here\nare seven things you do\nthat might make people dislike you.\n(soft music)\nNumber one, being fake.\nYou've probably heard\nthe phrase be yourself\nas advice when you're meeting new people.\nThis allows you to show how\ncolorful and unique you are.\nOn the other hand, when you\ntry to be someone you're not,\nit can come across as inauthentic\nand make some people wary\nof you and your intentions.\nIt's better to be your authentic self,\nas you'll find that\npeople that do like you\nlike you for who you are.\nWhile being yourself\ndoesn't necessarily mean\nyou'll be the most popular in the room,\nyou'll find that the\nfriendships that come out of it\nare much stronger than\nthose built on a facade.\nNumber two, being one-sided.\nConversations and relationships\nshould be a two-way street.\nWhile it's no secret that being selfish,\ntaking advantage of others,\nand not letting others speak\nwill make them dislike you,\nthe reverse can be true as well.\nLetting someone else do all the talking\nand provide no input from your side\nis typically less favorable.\nHaving back-and-forth conversations,\nletting others speak their perspective,\nand you responding with your own\nis better than a one-sided interrogation.\nBasically, create dialogue\ninstead of a monologue.\nNumber three, not smiling.\nSmiling has numerous benefits\noutside of social situations,\nincluding improving your overall mood.\nDid you know that smiling\ncan make you more\nattractive to other people?\nIt can make you appear more\napproachable and friendly\nthan if you're frowning.\nWhile it can't be hard to\nknow what your face is doing,\nyou may find it makes a difference\nin how people interact with you.\nAfter all, people pay close attention\nto your non-verbal expressions.\nNumber four, getting\ntoo personal right away.\nAs social beings, we rely\non others for support,\nand the closer we are to people,\nthe more we're willing to let them in,\nbut timing is also important.\nTelling your best friend of 10 years\nsomething really personal\nis different from a person\nyou met 10 minutes ago.\nDoing this can be off-putting\nand can lead a person to judge you\nin a way that someone who\nknows your full story wouldn't.\nLet someone get to know you first\nand understand you as a person\nbefore letting them in\non all your secrets.\nNumber five, bragging.\nWhile it can be nice\nto flex some of your wonderful\nachievements on others,\nthere's a time and a place for everything,\nand bragging can be a huge turnoff\nwhen used in the wrong situation.\nTalking too much about\nyourself and your achievements\ncan come off as self-centeredness\nand create a sense of\nsuperiority that drives away.\nWhile this may seem obvious,\ndo know that this isn't\nthe only way to brag.\nHumble-bragging is\nessentially the same action,\nalthough it's veiled by self-criticizing\na positive attribute about themselves.\nFor example, if you tell someone\nthat you care too much about a project,\nand that's why your group members\nhave a difficult time\ngetting along with you,\nyou're essentially boasting\nthat you have a great work ethic,\nbut are disguising it as self-deprecation.\nNumber six, being threatening.\nA person can feel threatened by you\nfor reasons beyond the obvious.\nPerhaps you have something\nthat the other person does not,\nand jealousy comes into play.\nMaybe they're insecure about\nsomething within themselves\nand project it onto you,\nso unless you're actively doing something\nthat could potentially harm a person,\nsometimes people may dislike you\nbecause of something that they're lacking.\nBut this isn't the only way\nthat you can appear threatening.\nYour body language, tone of voice,\nand what you talk about\nare important as well.\nMaking sure you keep\nyour body language open\nand working to make your peers\nmore comfortable can help.\nAnd number seven, being yourself.\nOkay, hear us out.\nWhile this may be surprising,\nit's true that sometimes being who you are\nwill turn others away.\nThis can be through many factors.\nIn many cases, certain people\nhave different preferences\nthat may not align with your personality.\nWhile it's important to know\nthat you can improve yourself,\nespecially if you're\ndoing something harmful,\nit should not come at the expense\nof pretending to be someone else,\nas we said at the start.\nSometimes you may just be\nincompatible with certain groups,\nand that's okay.\nYou can improve what you wanna change,\nbut also accept what you cannot.\nWhen you are your authentic self,\nyou might drive some people away,\nbut you may also pull in people\nwho accept and love you for who you are,\nand you may find that it\nwill attract others to you\nand build connections much\nstronger than the other way.\nAfter all, the quality of friendships\nis more important than quantity.\nCan you relate to any\nof the things mentioned?\nLet us know in the comments\nbelow if you liked this video,\nand share it with others.\nThe references and studies used\nare listed in the description below.\nUntil next time, and take care."
