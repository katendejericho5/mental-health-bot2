    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Have you ever wondered\nhow smart or intelligent you are?\nJust because you may have failed in school\nor not done as well as expected,\ndoesn't mean you lack brains.\nYou might be a different kind of genius.\nIn 1983, in Harvard University,\nleading psychologist Dr. Howard Gardner\ncreated a new theory,\nMultiple Intelligence,\nwhich suggests that\nthere are nine types of intelligence\nthat aren't measured by standard IQ tests.\nSo you might be more intelligent\nin a non-traditional way.\nHere's a few signs that you might have\ngenius level intelligence.\nOne, you enjoy new ideas.\nAre you willing to entertain\nnew and unconventional ideas?\nApparently, this desire to try out\ninteresting new things\nis linked to high intelligence.\nPreferring new activities and variety\nover routines and trusted patterns\nis one of the ways that\nthe highly intelligent live.\nThey enjoy brain teaser, new problems,\nphilosophical arguments\nand eccentric, uncommon activities.\nFor them, variety isn't the spice of life.\nVariety is life.\nNumber two, question everything.\nDo you find yourself\nquestioning everything\nand being curious about\neverything around you?\nIs your brain always buzzing\nwith unanswered questions?\nThis might be a sign\nthat you are highly intelligent.\nA brilliant mind\nnever stops questioning.\nYou enjoy reading and researching\nto find the answers to your questions.\nYou are more observant than most\nand you enjoy delving deep into the depths\nof the questions of\nexistence in the universe.\nNumber three, you might be addiction prone\nor do mood altering substances.\nWhile you would think\nthat someone who's very intelligent\nwould stay away from illegal substances,\nthat's apparently not the case.\nIt seems that those who are geniuses\nare quite willing to indulge\nin drugs and alcohol.\nSome of history's greatest minds\nhave been known to be dependent on it.\nJean-Michel Masquiat, Steven\nKing, and Sigmund Freud.\nObviously, not all\nhighly intelligent people\npartake in these vices,\nbut there is a real correlation.\na 2011 study by Batty and White,\nwhich is based on\nthe British Cohort Study of 1970,\ntook 8,000 people\nand tested their IQ scores\nat ages five to 10.\nThey followed up with them\nat ages 16 and 30,\nand discovered that the group\nwith higher intelligence scores\nused cocaine, marijuana, ecstasy,\nand a combination of drugs.\nThe same relationship\napparently exists with alcohol.\nBut this isn't a sign\nthat you should indulge\nin these substances,\nas addictions can\nseriously ruin your life.\nWe don't condone drug and alcohol abuse.\nNumber four, you're prone to worry.\nHighly intelligent people\nare usually not laid back\nbecause of all the constant thoughts\nracing through their brains.\nAnxiety may have given early humans\na survival benefit\nin ancient times.\nUnfortunately, this trait has expanded.\nAnd for some,\nthey haven't been able to shake it off.\nThe highly intelligent\nstruggle with thoughts\nand turning them off.\nThey can't shrug off random\nexistential questions\nand sometimes overthink\nevery minute detail.\nNumber five, you enjoy being alone.\nDo you really value your alone time?\nMaybe you spend time meditating\nor working on your own hobbies.\nYou rarely need people to entertain you,\nbut you aren't antisocial\nor unwilling to socialize\nwith family or friends.\nThose with higher levels of intelligent\nexhibited a lower level\nof life satisfaction\nwhen they socialized more.\nYou may love your friends,\nbut you prefer to problem solve solo.\nIn number six, you have\na unique sense of humor.\nDo you like telling jokes\nthat others find weird and offensive?\nDo dark jokes make you\nlaugh uncontrollably?\nApparently, highly intelligent people\nhave a twisted sense of humor\nthat others don't.\nA twisted sense of humor\nis a reliable sign of high intelligence.\nThey hypothesized that the participants\nwho responded to the most offensive jokes\nor told the most offensive jokes\nwould score the highest in the IQ tests.\nAnd surely enough,\nthe participants with dark humor\nscored higher on the verbal tests.\nDid you relate to this video?\nIf you relate to most of the above,\nthen you may be smarter\nthan you give yourself credit for.\nRemember that everyone is\nsmart in their own way,\nas cliche as that sounds.\nAs similar as we all are,\nwe're also very different.\nSo remember that the next time\nyou question your intelligence.\nShare your experiences\nin the comment section below.\nWe appreciate hearing your stories.\nLeave a like and share\nthis video with a friend\nif you think it'll help them.\nAs usual, all references\nare in the description.\nThanks for watching.\nUntil next time."
