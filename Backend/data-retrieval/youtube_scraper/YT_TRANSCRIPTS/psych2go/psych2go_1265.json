    "transcript": "[Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nHave you ever wondered\nif there are other signs\nthat you're intelligent?\nYou know, besides that IQ score\nand grade on your math test.\nThere are many ways people\nmeasure intelligence in others,\nand there are some pretty common signs\nto tell if someone might be smart.\nBut what about the less obvious signs?\nHere are a few bizarre signs\nthat you're likely an intelligent person.\nNumber one, the sound of\nchewing is annoying to you.\nDo you hate the sound of chewing?\nIs your sister chewing a bacon sandwich\nwith crunchy chips right beside you\nas you scream internally?\nWell, if that chewy sound\nreally gets on your nerves,\nyou may just have a greater\nlevel of creative cognition.\nIn a study from Northwestern University,\nsubjects who often had a hard time\nfiltering out unnecessary\nsensory information\nwere tested and found to have a high score\nin creative cognition.\nThese subjects were found to\nhave what some researchers\ncall leaky sensory gating.\nAs the researchers of the study explain,\nleaky sensory gating may\nhelp people integrate ideas\nthat are outside of the focus of attention\nor getting to creativity\nin the real world.\nNumber two, you are a\nbit of a couch potato.\nAre you a couch potato?\nWell, you may be smarter than you think,\ndepending on how much\nyou spend time thinking.\nIn a 2016 study from Florida\nGulf Coast University,\nresearchers surveyed students\nby asking if they enjoyed thinking,\nor if they enjoyed activities\nthat required less though.\nSubjects were then divided into two groups\nof non-thinkers and thinkers.\nAfter a week of monitoring\nthe subject's physical activity,\nthey found non-thinkers\nwere more physically active\nthan those who are deemed thinkers.\nAuthors associate this with the idea\nthat thinkers can entertain\nthemselves mentally,\nwhile non-thinkers easily get bored\nand relate mental stimulation as negative\ncompared to how the thinkers\nsee it as a positive.\nNumber three, you like to doodle.\nDo you love to doodle\nduring class, at home?\nWell, your memory may just thank you.\nA 2009 study found that\nsubjects in a group\nthat doodled performed\nbetter on a monitoring task,\nand on a surprise memory test,\nthey recalled 29% more\ninformation than the other group.\nWhat exactly were they doodling?\nThey simply shaded printed shapes\nwhile listening to a phone call.\nSo next time you have\nto remember something\nimportant during that class lecture,\nbring the coloring\nbooks, not the textbooks.\nI'm just kidding, a little bit.\nNumber four, you are the eldest child.\nAre you the eldest child?\nWell, lucky for you,\nthis is another weird sign\nyou're likely more intelligent\nand maybe smarter than your siblings.\nResearchers from a study published\nin the Journal of Human Resources suggest\nthat firstborns may be\nsmarter than their siblings\nas they often have higher IQs.\nThey also found the oldest siblings\noften do better at cognitive tests.\nResearchers believe this is due\nto who the greater type of parenting\nthe first child experiences.\nA first born child might\nhave more mental stimulation\npresented to them.\nFirst time parents are more\nlikely to be more cautious\nwith their first pregnancy\nby not drinking or smoking.\nNumber five, you live in\na disorderly environment.\nLook around, is your room a mess?\nHow about your workspace?\nHow's the hair doing up there?\nWell, a messy environment\nmight not be so bad\nif you value creativity.\nAccording to a research experiment\nfrom the University of Minnesota,\n\"Participants in a disorderly\nroom are more creative\nthan participants in an\norderly room,\" the study says.\nWhy does creativity spark\nin a messy environment?\nResearch scientist,\nJonathan Y PhD says that,\n\"Smarter people tend to\nhave creativity as a trait,\nwhich can lead to their\nmessy lifestyle or room.\nMy guess is that it's not messiness\nthat helps creativity but creativity\nwhich may create messiness.\"\nHe can goes on to say that such people\ntend to get lost in a thought,\nfocusing on a problem or issue,\nand cleanliness becomes of less importance\nthan focusing on the problem at hand.\nWhile the messy room sounds great\nfor all the artists out there,\nit may not be great when it\ncomes to your food choices.\nIn the University of Minnesota's study,\ntheir first experiment showed that\nrelative to participants\nin a disorderly room,\nparticipants in an orderly\nroom chose healthier snacks\nand donated more money.\nTo clean or not to clean.\nThat is the question.\nAnd number six, you swear.\nHow often do you swear?\nWas the childhood swear jar often filled\nto the max due to your foul language?\nTimothy Jay PhD, a\nwell-known expert in cursing\nconducted a study with his colleagues\nand found that those who\ncame up with more curse words\ngenerally had a larger vocabulary.\nJay told Medical Daily that\ntaboo or swear word fluency\nis positively correlated\nwith overall verbal fluency.\nDr. Jay told Medical Daily\nthat the more words you generated\nin one category meant the\nmore words you generated\nin another category, orally and verbally.\nTime to bring out the swear jar\nand start counting your quarters.\nBe prepared to say goodbye\nas you test out this theory.\nHow many swear words can you come up\nwith in your head in 30 seconds?\nIn your head, in your head, not out loud.\nThe swear jar is full enough as it is.\nShare that number with us\ndown in the comments, folks,\nonly the number.\nSo which weird science do you relate to?\nAre you a thinker or do you\nprefer physical activities more?\nAre you a couch potato?\nThe oldest sibling?\nHow often do you swear?\nDo you think you're more\nintelligent because of this?\nShare with us your thoughts\nin the comments below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did, don't\nforget to click play
