class,\nB, music class,\nC, literature class,\nor D, gym class.\nOkay, all tallied up?\nHere is your learning style\naccording to the letter\nthat appears the most.\nIf A appears the most,\nyou are a visual learner.\nA visual learner is someone\nwho uses visual imagery\nto process and absorb information.\nThey're the epitome of the\ntrope \"to see is to believe.\"\nVisual learners retain information best\nwhen they're depicted\nin a form of a graphic,\nsuch as arrows, charts,\ndiagrams, and symbols.\nIf B appears the most,\nyou're an auditory learner.\nAuditory learners are\nthose who prefer listening\nto information presented to\nthem using verbal interaction.\nAuditory learners easily remember things\nthat have been said to them\nbecause they learn through auditory cues.\nThey tend to excel in group settings\nwhere verbal communication is the norm.\nThey also enjoy reading out loud.\nIf C appears the most, you're\na reading and writing learner.\nReading and writing learners\nare those who learn best\nthrough, you guessed\nit, reading and writing.\nThey derive most of their\ninformation from written words\nand rely on reading\nto retain the information\npresented to them.\nThey may have difficulty\nremembering things\nif there are no words involved,\nbut they frequently make use\nof the information given to\nthem that they can write down.\nThey love taking notes to remember things.\nAnd if D appeared the most,\nyou're a kinesthetic learner.\nKinesthetic learners learn best\nif they play an active and physical role\nin the learning process.\nKinesthetic learners are\nknown for the physical\nand tactile emphasis\nthey put into learning,\nusually engaging their senses to learn.\nThey experiment with things\nwith their hands and senses\nbefore storing the\ninformation in their memory.\nWhile they may not be the most adept\nin absorbing information\nin a seated lecture,\nthey truly excel when\ndoing physical activities,\nlike riding a bike, gardening,\nor assembling things from scratch.\nSo what's your learning style?\nDid you relate to any of\nthe learning styles above?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nAs a final word, it's important to know\nthat there's no optimal learning style.\nEveryone learns things differently.\nA Journal of Educational Psychology\nled by a Beth Rogowsky paper\nactually found no relationship\nbetween the study subject's\nlearning style preference\nand their performance on reading\nor listening comprehension tests.\nWhile it would be nice to think\nthat matching a student's\npreferred learning style\nwith a complementary teaching method\nwould do students good,\nit's ultimately up to you how you absorb\nand discern information\nwith the habits you've already formed.\nThat's all for now, Psych2Goers.\nSee ya next time."
