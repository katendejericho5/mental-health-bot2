    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey there,\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nWhen you hear the word depression,\ndo you automatically think\nof a down-turned face,\nor a person sitting alone\nin the corner crying?\nIf only it were that obvious all the time\nto see that something is seriously wrong.\nUnfortunately, it's not that simple.\nAs a double whammy,\nthat stereotype leads to\nseriously suffering depression\nsometimes being unfairly called out,\nor slandered for faking depression,\nwhen they're seen smiling,\nor leading an outwardly normal life.\nWe're going to look at\nsigns that give away\nthe underlying depression\nsuffered by that social butterfly\nor straight A student.\nThe mask may be well crafted,\nbut it's still a mask,\nand they may well need your\ncompassion and understanding.\nLet's begin.\nNumber one, their surroundings burn,\nand yet they smile.\nThink of that dog from the meme.\nThis is fine.\nThink of the lyrics to\nthat Nat King Cole, Smile.\n♪ Smile though your heart is aching ♪\nYou get the idea.\nThis is different from the\nsmirk or the grin that twinkles.\nThese are the smiles\nthat seem to not match\nthe rest of the person, where\nthe smile is curved right,\nbut there's something in\nthe eyes that seem sad,\nholding lots of pain.\nThis person is using the smile\nto bury their real feelings,\nor brush them aside.\nIt's casually named smiling depression.\nThey're the people who have the outwardly\nseemingly normal, even healthy life,\nbut are experiencing\nthe distressful symptoms\nof depression on the inside.\nAs the term smiling depression\nisn't an official diagnosis,\nit's more clinically called\nmajor depressive disorder\nwith atypical features.\nNumber two, they give\nconstant vague excuses,\nlike I'm busy, whenever\nthey're invited out.\nDepression still holds a stigma,\nand truthfully, many\nstill are uncomfortable\ndealing with or confronting\nthat their loved ones have depression.\nThe result is the depressed person feels\nthey need to hide their depressive episode\nto avoid feeling humiliated, or weak,\nor not wanting to be a\nburden to their loved ones\nwith their struggles.\nThey give the other person\na quick vague excuse,\nand then withdraw even more.\nNumber three, everything is a joke,\nand they see themselves as one too.\nSo there's a Knowledge\nBite floating around\nthat indicates many comedians\nactually suffer from depression.\nIn the light of this\nsign, that makes sense.\nPeople inject humor into their\nlives for various reasons,\nbut there are different\nways that they do it.\nIf it's the kind of joking\nwhere they're laughing\nwith others, making everyone feel at ease,\nor they just have a generally\nhumorous outlook on life,\nthat's not usually the kind of humor\nthat points towards masked depression.\nIt's when the jokes can be really unfunny\nto a group or person involved\nthat this can be an\nindicator of depression.\nOne type is aggressive humor.\nWhen one uses humor to\nput other people down,\nto manipulate, ridicule, and offend them,\nlike the bully who's\nalleviating their own anxiety\nat the expense of others.\nAnother type of humor\nthat masks depression\nis self-defeating humor.\nOne as the inclination to put oneself down\nto make other people laugh.\nThis is where you've put yourself\nin the position of the butt monkey,\nalmost encouraging others to laugh at you.\nBoth are used to hide one's true feelings\nfrom themselves and others.\nFour, they get her all\ndone during the day,\nand then utterly collapse\nonce they're home.\nDepression and mental health\nare pretty personal things.\nMost people rarely wanna disclose\ntheir struggles to others,\nespecially to their\ncolleagues or acquaintances.\nThe depressed person already feels\npretty lousy about themselves.\nSo they at least want to uphold an image\nof professionalism being\nviewed in a positive light\nby their coworkers and other outsiders.\nSo they empty their energy reserves\ncompletely into this aspect,\nleaving nothing for\nany other part of life.\nNumber five, increased empathy\nand desire to empower others,\nbecause they've been there.\nIt could be a case of\nmisery loves company,\nor it could also be an epiphany\nof I know how this feels.\nI don't want others to feel this way.\nEssentially, it's the push\nto connect with others\nthrough this shared experience.\nOften, it's the realization\nthat they need supportive people,\nand people who they can relate to,\nletting themselves and others\nknow they're not alone.\nWhat to watch out for though,\nis that the scales stay balanced\nin the realm of support and empowerment\nto work through the issues,\nand not enabling the depression.\nJumping in and fixing\nor removing obstacles\nfor a person does not help them.\nContrarily, that keeps them helpless,\nas they don't learn how to\ndeal with the issue themselves.\nAnd number six, when straight\nup asked what's wrong,\nthey always give a vague\nhand wave excuse like,\noh, I'm just tired.\nHey, we get it.\nThere are certainly days\nthat run the marathon harder than others,\nand it's normal to feel tired after that.\nWe also know that usually\nnot every day is like that.\nThat proclamation of I'm tired\ncan take a deeper meaning,\nespecially if it's starting to be a norm.\nWhen a person is struggling\nwith mental health issues,\nit's as if they're carrying a huge burden,\nwhich is likened to a battery\nthat never completely charges,\nand no wonder, as fatigue and exhaustion\nis a symptom experienced by\naround 90% of depressed people.\nSo before happily and blindly stating,\noh that person's just fine,\nyet you've heard that they're struggling,\nperhaps take a closer look.\nYou could be the helping that\nmakes all the difference.\nYou could be the one who helps someone\nstop crushing themselves with that mask,\nand truly start on the\nroad to getting better.\nWe all have our dark spots,\nand some of us just need\nto see that bit of light,\nso we can get out from under.\nIf any of this rang familiar with you,\nplease feel free to comment below.\nThanks for watching,\nand we'll see you soon."
