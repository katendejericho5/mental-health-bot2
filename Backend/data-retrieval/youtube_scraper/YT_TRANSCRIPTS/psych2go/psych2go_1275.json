    "transcript": "(bright music)\n- What makes a great friendship?\nWell, some would say it's\nhaving shared interest\nor a similar sense of humor,\nwhile others would argue it's\nloyalty and dependability.\n- Some people want a friend\nwho's fun, adventurous, and exciting,\nwhile others would rather\nsomeone who's supportive,\nempathetic, and good at listening.\n- Either way, like with any\nother kind of relationships,\nfriendships need honesty,\ntrust, care, and mutual respect\nto thrive and survive.\nBut when it comes to fake friendships,\nyou'll notice that all of these\nthings are sorely missing.\n- So do you wanna know\nif you have a fake friend\nand how you can spot them?\nDo you wanna make sure that\nthe people closest to you\nare with you for the right reasons?\nHere are seven things only\na fake friend would do.\n- [Narrator 1] First and foremost,\na true friend would never gossip\nabout you behind your back\nand spread all your secrets to everyone\nno matter how juicy the rumor would be\nor how popular it would make them.\nThey would never\njeopardize your friendship\nor humiliate you like that.\nA true friend would never stoop so low\nas to betray your trust like that.\nHave you ever spent weeks planning a trip\nonly for your friend to cancel\non you at the last minute?\nNo matter how many times you\nkeep reminding them about it\nor making them promise you they'll come,\nyour so-called friends\nnever keep their word.\nFlaky and indecisive, you've\nhad to learn the hard way\ntime and time again that\nyou can't ever count on them\nto come through for you.\n- [Narrator 2] Another way you can tell\nwhen someone doesn't care about you\nas much as you do about them\nis if they're always\nexcluding you from things.\nFake friends will conveniently\nforget to invite you\nand leave you out of everything they do.\nEven if you go out of\nyour way to invite them\nor tell them about your plans,\nthey just don't do the same for you\nbecause the harsh truth is\nthey don't really consider you\na friend.\n- [Narrator 1] Do you\nhave a friend in your life\nwho only ever calls you\nto ask for your help?\nThen they're probably a fake friend.\nFake friends thinks it's\nokay to ghost you for weeks\nonly to come back and ask you for a favor.\nAnd the moment you give\nthem what they want,\npoof.\nThey're out of your life once more.\n- [Narrator 2] While it's certainly true\nthat most of us do love\nto talk about ourselves,\nonce we come to care for someone,\nit's only natural that we'd\nwant to know how they're doing\nas well.\nIn a fake friendship,\ncommunication is largely one-sided,\nself-absorbed and inconsiderate.\nFake friends will go on\nand on about themselves\nwithout ever once letting\nyou know you get in a word\nof your own.\n- [Narrator 1] A back-handed compliment\nis something fake friends\ndo to subtly put you down\nby making it sound like praise.\nThey might say things like\nyou look so much better\nthan you usually do as\na way of criticizing you\nwithout being too obvious about it.\nThis kind of thinly veiled hostility\nshows that they are jealous of you\nand that they judge you more harshly\nthan they want to let on.\n- So did anyone in particular come to mind\nwhile you were reading this list?\nHave you ever been in a fake friendship\nor fallen prey to fake friends before?\n- While it may be a\npainful truth to swallow\nthat someone we considered a close friend\nwould try and take advantage of us,\nit hurts even more to keep\ndenying ourselves the truth\nand to stay with someone\nthat is no good for us.\n- For the sake of you\nand your mental health,\nwatch out for fake friends\nand cut them off of your life\nbefore it's too late.\n- So be mindful of these seven things\nthat only fake friends do\nand you'll have more room in\nyour life for healthy, happy,\nand loving relationships with people\nthat truly care about you.\n(gentle bright music)"
