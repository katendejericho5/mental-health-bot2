    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Have you\never felt that introvert\nor extrovert doesn't fully describe you?\nDo you feel that your\nintro-version fluctuates,\ndepending on the people around you\nor the time you interact with people?\nIf you don't fall on either\nside of the spectrum,\nyou're probably an ambivert.\nSo here are seven signs\nthat you are an ambivert.\n(upbeat music)\nNumber one, you enjoy socializing,\nyou just need downtime afterward.\nDo you like parties?\nHow'd you spend your time at a party?\nExtroverts love being\naround people at parties,\ntalking to many people\nwithout needing to take\nbreaks to recharge.\nIntroverts usually don't\nenjoy parties as much\nand prefer to stick with a familiar face\nor a group of friends the entire night.\nAmbiverts, on the other hand,\ncan channel their inner extrovert\nand talk with lots of different people\nand have fun with new and familiar faces,\nbut they may also spend some\ndowntime with their friends\nor alone to recharge\nbefore immersing themselves\nin a crowd once again.\nNumber two, you're good\nat managing people.\nDo others turn to you in times of crisis?\nDepending on the situation\nboth introverts and extroverts\ncan become good leaders.\nAccording to a study published\nin the Harvard Business Review\non a pizza delivery chain\nan extroverted leader\nwith passive employees\ntended to bring more\nsuccess to a business,\nbut lower profits when\nemployees were more proactive.\nOn the other hand, a\nbusiness had better profits\nwhen proactive employees\nwere under more introverted management.\nThis is good news for ambiverts,\nwho can show introverted and\nextroverted characteristics\nbased on their employees' needs\nand adjusting to their team.\nNumber three, you're easy to get to know.\nIs it easy for you to\nget a conversation going\nwith a stranger?\nIt's hard for introverts\nto open up immediately,\nright away, unlike extroverts,\nwho can start a\nconversation fairly easily.\nAmbiverts fall somewhere in between.\nThey don't mind starting up a conversation\nwith someone they don't know,\nbut they also aren't known\nfor being this center of attention\nor having an outgoing personality.\nAmbiverts can easily\nguide the conversation\nand make it an enjoyable\ntime for both themselves\nand their new friend.\nDoes that sound like you?\nNumber four, you work well\nin solo and group settings.\nWould you rather work alone on a task\nor collaborate with others?\nIntroverts tend to enjoy\nworking in solitude,\nbut they can often have difficulty\nsharing their thoughts in a group setting.\nExtroverts on the other hand\nwork well in group settings,\nbut they may not be as\nmotivated to perform\nwhen they're by themselves.\nAmbiverts fall in the sweet spot,\nin the middle and thrive in both settings.\nThey can make great facilitators,\nhelping introverts speak\nup in group settings,\nand they can also be great at channeling\ntheir inner focus when working alone.\nNumber five, you're a good\nlistener and communicator.\nIntroverts are known to\nbe excellent listeners,\nwhereas extroverts are great\nat articulating their thoughts.\nAmbiverts take bits of both personalities.\nThey know when to talk and when to listen\nand they can usually pick\nup on what others want\nor need to hear, making\nthem great mediators.\nNumber six, you know when to trust people.\nDo you think that your gut\nfeeling is almost always correct?\nIntroverts have a difficult\ntime open opening up,\noften distancing themselves from others\nbefore fully trusting them.\nExtroverts are sociable, but\nthey may also trust others\na bit too much at the start.\nAmbiverts tend to be more discerning\nand know how to make the\nother party feel at ease\nand also how to provide\nthe right information\nat the right moment.\nAnd number seven, you'd rather\nhave your weekends packed.\nWould you rather have your weekends filled\nwith activities or free from stress?\nWhereas introverts would\nrather do their own thing\nand relax, ambiverts enjoy\ngoing out occasionally.\nStaying home for too long,\nalthough nice every once\nin a while, can drain them.\nAnd they'll often find ways\nto socialize on the weekend.\nDo you relate to any of the signs above?\nAre there any that we've missed?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you enjoyed this video,\nplease share it with\nthose who might benefit.\nThe references and studies used\nare listed in the description below.\nThat's all for now,\nfriends, until next time."
