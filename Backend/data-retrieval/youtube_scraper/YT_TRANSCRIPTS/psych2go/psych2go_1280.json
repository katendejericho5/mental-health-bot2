keeping a healthy body\nbecause one can easily influence the\nother\nif you want to know more about good\nmental health habits here are six\nsurprising habits that make you mentally\nstrong\nnumber one you are in control of your\nemotions\ndid a recent argument with a friend to\nleave you feeling hurt or upset because\nof what they said\nhave your parents ever told you that you\nneed to do a better job on your chores\nwhen you thought you were doing a good\njob already\nin both of these situations it's\nunderstandable that you may feel upset\nanxious annoyed or even outright angry\nand that's okay\nfeeling these kinds of emotions doesn't\nmake you weak it's perfectly normal\nit's when you don't allow those negative\nemotions to take control of you that\nmakes you mentally strong\nfor example\nwhile arguing with your friend you\ndidn't take your anger out on them and\nchose to keep calm even though you were\nupset at the time\nor maybe when you're sad you don't let\nthat heaviness drag you down and keep\nyou from moving forward you try to move\npast your emotional hurdles you\nrecognize these negative emotions and\nchoose to acknowledge them\nin doing so you're able to calmly\nprocess them and work through them\nleaving you with the ability to respond\nto most situations with a clear head\nnumber two you question your thoughts\nand beliefs\nhow does questioning thoughts and\nbeliefs make you mentally strong though\nwhen you think critically about your\nthoughts and beliefs you're challenging\nyourself\nwith the internet at our fingertips\nthere is so much information to take in\nand explore\nthis can be overwhelming when you're\ntrying to keep up with what's true and\nwhat's lies or what's just a rumor it\ncan be really easy to blindly accept\neverything you hear as truth\nmentally strong people make a habit of\nquestioning or thinking critically about\nthings they come across whether it's\nsomething a close family member told\nthem or a news article they saw\nquestioning things that you read or hear\ngives you a reason to dig deeper\nallowing you to learn more and gives you\nthe opportunity to learn about different\npeople's perspectives by doing this it\ngives you control over how the\ninformation affects you\nnumber three you have healthy boundaries\nin place for yourself\ndo you feel like a doormat for people to\nwalk all over do you drop everything\nyou're doing to help out a friend or\nfamily member when they need a favor\ncreating healthy boundaries for the\npeople in your life is a good habit for\nmental strength\naccording to an article from psych\ncentral boundaries are a measure of your\nself-esteem\nwhen you create healthy boundaries\nyou're letting others know how to treat\nyou while allowing you to be your best\nself\nwhen you don't have boundaries it's\neasier to always say yes to people you\nlet your friends frequently vent all of\ntheir problems to you or you let that\none friend poke fun at you a little too\nmuch\nwhile wanting to be there for others and\nhelp them isn't necessarily a bad thing\nalways being available at everyone's\nbeck and call can put unneeded stress on\nyou you can't pour out of an empty cup\nby not setting healthy boundaries\nthere's a good chance that eventually\nyour cup will run out\nto stay mentally strong it's important\nto create boundaries with those around\nyou so that you don't drain yourself of\nall of your mental and physical energy\nnumber four\nyou actively learn from your mistakes\nhave you ever said something that wasn't\nnice born out of anger or frustration or\nhave you gotten a lower grade on a test\nthan what you were expecting\nyou might dwell on situations where you\nweren't acting your best and focus on\nthem\nobsessing over things you've done in the\npast only adds more stress to your plate\nwhen you start to think about what\nhappened figure out why it happened and\nmake a plan for how to improve on it\nnext time\nthis will make you mentally stronger\nbecause it shows that you're choosing to\ngrow and learn from past mistakes\nnumber five you limit your time on\nsocial media\nhow many hours do you spend on social\nmedia a day\nsocial media is a huge part of our\nsociety and our daily lives it can be a\ngreat way to connect with friends and\nfamily and is filled with endless memes\nand cute cat pictures\nbut there can be risks to scrolling\nthrough instagram\napps like facebook and instagram make it\neasy to compare your life to others\nthose glossy filtered photos and the\nposts about their happy lives can make\nit look like the grass is greener on\ntheir side\nand an unhealthy game of comparison can\nstart in your heart\naccording to a study prolonged use of\nsocial media sites and apps may be\nlinked to symptoms of depression\nwhen exposed to all of that social media\nyou can start to think you aren't good\nenough or be envious of the things you\nsee people doing online\nlimiting your use of social media can\nhelp you avoid this harmful comparison\ngame whether you give yourself an\nallotted amount of time to check social\nmedia each day or you only check at\nnight or in the morning limiting your\ntime on social media can help make you\nmentally strong and number six\ntaking time for yourself\ndo you have long days at school or at\nwork\ndo you often choose to do more work than\nwhat is asked of you\nare you constantly on the go and feel\nlike you have to be doing something to\nstay productive\ngoing above and beyond and keeping up on\nproductive tasks is great but if you\ndon't take time for yourself to recharge\nyour mental health can take a hit\naccording to an article from psych\ncentral downtime allows your brain to\nrestore attention and motivation\nit promotes creativity strengthens\nmemory and can even make you more\nproductive in the long run\nwhen you take a little time out of your\nbusy day to go for a walk read a book or\neven just lay on the
