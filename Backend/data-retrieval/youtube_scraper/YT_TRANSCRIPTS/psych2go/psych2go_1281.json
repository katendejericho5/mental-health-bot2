    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Have you\nbeen finding it difficult\nto get people to like you?\nDo you get flustered or awkward\nand end up pushing people away?\nSometimes it can be difficult\nto know how to get close to people.\nWhether it's trying to make\nnew friends or find a partner,\nyou may struggle with\nattracting the right people.\nSo to help you become more likable,\nhere are five habits that\nattract people the most.\nNumber one, practicing kindness.\nDo you treat others with warmth and care?\nIt's hard to dislike people\nwho are kind, giving,\nand who can make those\naround them feel good.\nA research published\nin the \"Evolutionary Psychology\"\njournal had even found\nthat when women were presented\nwith two groups of men,\none group described as altruistic\nand the other without that description,\nthey thought the altruistic\ngroup was more attractive\nand more desirable,\nparticularly for long-term relationships.\nSo do something nice for someone today.\nYou never know who you'll attract.\nNumber two, being a good listener.\nDo you talk about yourself a\nlot? It's not without reason.\nA study from Harvard University found\nthat people like talking\nabout themselves a lot.\nWhen they talk about what's on their mind,\ntheir brains get filled with dopamine,\none of the many feel-good hormones.\nHowever, while it may make you feel good,\nit may turn people away.\nSo a good way to attract\npeople is to show them\nthat you're listening and are\npaying full attention to them\nand to what they're saying.\nBe more aware of whether\nor not you're dominating\nall your conversations.\nBy being a good listener,\nyou are able to show them\nthat you care about them\nand that you are ready to give\nthem your time and attention,\nwhich is incredibly attractive.\nNumber three, smiling.\nHow often do you smile?\nA research article\nfrom the \"Cognition and\nEmotion\" scientific journal\nexplored the link between facial\nexpressions and attraction.\nParticipants were shown\ntwo photos of people\nwith varying happiness expressions,\nand the researchers found\nthat photos of people\nwith a bigger smile were\nseen as more attractive.\nSo, smiling can make you more attractive.\nIt exhibits joy,\ncontentment, and happiness,\nsomething that everyone is attracted to.\nSo make sure to have a smile on your face\nwhen you're around others.\nNumber four, spreading positivity.\nDid you know that emotions\ncan be spread around?\nPsychologists call this\nemotional contagion.\nYou can take this to your advantage\nby being as positive as you can be\nso that others can catch\nonto your positivity\nand good vibes.\nThis may be hard in\nmoments when you feel low,\nand that's okay.\nBut practicing positive\nthinking could help.\nIf you try to look for the\ngood things in the world\nand the people around you,\nand you have a positive and open attitude,\nothers will feel it too.\nYour positive energy\nwill make them feel good,\nand as a result,\nthey may find themselves\nfeeling more attracted to you.\nAnd number five, giving compliments.\nLast but not least,\npaying compliments can\nbe a good way to express\nthat you are interested.\nResearch in psychology has stated\nthat the evolution of\nlanguage may play a role\nin attracting potential partners\nand keeping their\ninterest in you going on.\nAnd one of the most important\nverbal communication strategies\nare through compliments.\nIt has also been shown\nthat people like those\nwho they know like them back.\nThis is known as the\nreciprocity of liking effect.\nSo when you compliment someone\nand show your attraction openly,\nit's more likely that they'll\nbe attracted to you too.\nBut of course, you should\nbe careful not to overdo it\nwith your compliments.\nMake sure you're not\ncomplimenting too much.\nFollow their body language to\nsee if they're feeling uneasy,\nand try focus your\ncompliments on personality\nrather than appearance.\nWhat do you think about these habits?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like and subscribe\nand share this video with those\nwho might benefit from it.\nDon't forget to hit the\nnotification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references and studies\nused in this video are added\nin the description below.\nThanks for watching, and\nsee you in our next video!"
