    "transcript": "- Hey, there's sectagoers.\nWhat kind of relationship do\nyou have with your parents?\nYour early childhood\nexperiences have an impact\non who you grow up to be.\nHow your parents treat you growing up\ncan stay with you for a long time\nbecause it tells you a\nlot about how they see you\nand in turn, how you\nshould feel about yourself.\nIt's why having a toxic\nrelationship with your parents\ncan have such a detriment long\nlasting impact on your life.\nIn this video, we'll be looking at\nfather daughter\nrelationships in particular.\nSo without further ado, here are six signs\nof an unhealthy\nfather-daughter relationship.\nNumber one, he's an absentee father.\nHas your father been\nthere for you growing up?\nWhether it's because of divorce,\nhaving his own other\nfamily or a career abroad,\nyou may have had a father who was\nnever really present in your life.\nHe may have been absent for\nmilestones, special occasions\nand for the moments when\nyou needed him the most.\nAs a result, it might have\nleft a significant hole\nin your heart.\nUltimately, a sign of\nan unhealthy father-daughter relationship\nis when your father was never there\nwhen you really need hated him to be\nor when he never made much of\nan effort to be there for you.\nNumber two, he's emotionally unavailable.\nSimilarly, even if your\nfather was actually present\nin your life, either living\nwith you or co-parenting you,\nit's still an unhealthy relationship\nif he is emotionally closed\noff and distant all the time,\ninstead of offering you\ncomfort when you're upset\nor sharing in your joy whenever\nyou accomplish something,\nhe may just show a disinterest.\nFathers like this may have no interest\nin fostering a relationship\nwith their children at all.\nThey may see their role\nas mainly to provide\nfor your family through other\nmeans such as financially.\nNumber three, he's overly controlling.\nDoes your father make\nevery decision for you?\nThe opposite of the absentee\nand emotionally distant father\nbut whose every bit just as toxic\nis the overly controlling father.\nFathers who are like this\ntowards their daughters\ntend to be strict,\nauthoritative and demanding.\nAlthough some of them might\nreally have their child's\nbest interest at heart,\nthey may have trouble\ngiving up control and\nallowing their daughters\nthe freedom they need to\nmake their own mistakes,\nexplore the world and\ndiscover who they are\nin their own terms.\nAll of which contribute\ngreatly to a person's\nsense of self-esteem,\nself-worth, mental health\nand satisfaction with life.\nNumber four, there are unclear boundaries.\nAs with any other relationship,\nclear personal boundaries\nneed to be established\nin order for both parties to feel safe,\nvalued and respected.\nHowever, oftentimes when\nit comes to parents,\nmany of them unfortunately think that\nbecause they're the\nones who had raised you\nand brought you into this world,\nthat it gives them the right\nto treat you however they want\nand with toxic\nfather-daughter relationships,\nthis might look like\ninvading your privacy,\ndisregarding your feelings and\nmaking your decisions for you\nwithout even a asking you or\ngiving you a good reason why.\nNumber five, there's a\nlack of open communication.\nAre you able to talk\nto each other honestly?\nDespite what it seems, children\narguing with their parents\ncan actually be a good thing sometimes\nbecause it shows that they feel\ncomfortable enough to share\nand express their true\nfeelings with each other.\nA lack of open communication\nin your relationship\nmay be a cause for concern\nsince it can lead to\na lot of deception, secrecy, resentment\nand passive aggressiveness\nbetween father and daughter,\nand number six, there are\nunrealistic expectations\nand constant comparisons.\nLast, but certainly not least,\nif your father sets unrealistic\nexpectations for you\nor constantly compares\nyou to other daughters,\nthen your relationship is most likely\nnot a very healthy one.\nThis demand for perfection\nfrom you at all times\nmay be because they see parenting\nas some sort of competition\nwhere they can win.\nFathers like this often don't care much\nabout the amount of effort\nyou put into something\nor how it makes you feel,\nwhat matters is how your achievements\nand failures reflect on them.\nAs a result, they may\nnever be happy with you\nuntil you're the most successful\nand most accomplished person they know,\nbut these are just unrealistic demands\nthat they somehow expect\nyou to meet in order to win\nthe love they should have\nfreely given in the first place.\nDid you relate to any of\nthe things
