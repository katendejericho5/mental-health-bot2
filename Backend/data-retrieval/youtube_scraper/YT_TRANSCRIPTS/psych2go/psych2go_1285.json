    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers, welcome back\nand thanks for taking a breather with us.\nWe know we could all use one.\nBurnout, it's finally getting recognition\nas an actual thing.\nIt's not just a buzzword,\nit's not something made up.\nIt's real and it's more\ncommon than you may think.\nAffecting people worldwide\nregardless of age or gender.\nBurnout, you might think\nof a candle's blackened,\nshriveled, worn out wick.\nIf you feel how that wick looks,\nyou can likely relate to burnout.\nThese here are some ways\nto hopefully keep that\ncandle wick conditioned,\nhelping to avoid burnout.\nThe best way to deal with it\nis to not get to that point\nin the first place.\nSo number one, figure out\nwhat is stressing you.\nWe are going to use the word, avoid\nand just clarifying, avoiding a stressor\nis not the same as\navoiding responsibilities.\nA responsibility needs to be\ndone but you don't have to go\nabout doing it in a stressful manner.\nSee what we mean?\nThe best way to reconfigure\nthis stressful process is,\nwhittle down and figure out what it is\nthat's causing the stress.\nHere's a simple example.\nIt's easy to say, \"This\nassignment is my stress,\n\"getting it done is stressing me out.\"\nBut when you step back you\nrealize this situation is more,\nI'm stressed because I feel tight on time\nand I'm tight on time\nbecause I repeatedly chose\nother activities until there\nwere only 24 hours left\nto get this done.\nSo yes, you may require some time\nto practice self-awareness.\nAs much as we never like to\nadmit it, we sometimes build\na whole lot of unnecessary\nstress for ourselves.\nSo, please don't do this to yourself.\nNumber two, complete the cycle.\nI know this sounds like we're\nsuggesting you allow yourself\nto get more stressed but we're\nnot, trust me, we're not.\nBurnout occurs because of\nprolonged unending stress.\nIt's essentially constantly\ntreading water in the worst spot\nand never swimming to shore for rest.\nThis is what we mean\nby complete the cycle.\nThe book, \"Burnout\" by\nPhD and DMA, Nagoski twins\ndescribes the cycle generally\nas, enter the stressor like\ntight turnaround times then cortisol\nand adrenaline production are\ntriggered from the stressor.\nThis activates the survival response\nof fight, flight or freeze.\nImpulsive reactive behavior\nhappens to stop the feeling\nof ah, which can be binging,\neating or streaming,\nwe're not on judging.\nAnd then completion is taking the step\nof meditative breathing,\nconnecting with others,\nor other forms of emotional release.\nBurnout happens when you get\nstuck at the binging step,\nthat impulsive action provides temporary,\nsuperficial relief.\nJust enough to fool many\nof us into thinking,\noh, we're all good now.\nTruthfully, the stress\nis still there under now\nallowing it to continue\nfrying and smoldering within.\nNumber three, sleep.\nIf you had nap time in kindergarten,\ndon't you wish that was still\na normal part of your day?\nSleep.\nSleep is wonderful.\nSleep is also important.\nA solid, healthy stretch of\nnighttime sleep is essential\nto overcoming or avoiding burnout.\nHumans are generally\nnot nocturnal by nature.\nWe know this, yet we seem\nto be all too willing\nto sacrifice sleep as\nthe first bartering chip\nwhen dealing with stress.\nWe tend to think of sleep as a reservoir,\neasily refilled with\ncatching up on the weekend\nor sleeping in on vacation.\nUnfortunately, sleep just\ndoes not work that way.\nYou can't rec on the past\nsleep you lost by sleeping more\nin the future.\nSo, get a good sleep in the now.\nWhat is good sleep anyway?\nIt's not that time you zoned\nout while reading then woke up\nwith a star when your\nforehead hit the desk.\nIt is completing a full sleep\ncycle including REM sleep.\nThe result is you wake\nfeeling refreshed and renewed.\nIf you wake up still groggy\nor wanting to throw down\nin anger, you did not\nhave a good night's sleep.\nTo help you reach this fabled good sleep,\nemploy sleep hygiene and prep.\nHygiene is basically a condition conducive\nto maintaining health.\nSo, sleep hygiene is good sleep practices\nlike no screens 30 minutes before bed\nand the room being dark, cool and silent.\nPrep is what happens before the hygiene,\nsetting yourself up\nphysically and mentally.\nSo, known norming shortly\nbefore bed and perhaps\na short session of meditation\nto quiet your mind.\nYour route is yours,\nthese are just components,\nfind ones that groove with you.\nAnd number four, release the oxytocin.\nPerform activities that\nhelp produce oxytocin.\nYes, oxytocin, the love\njug, well, hormones really.\nIt's been found that various activities\nsuch as giving to others,\ndancing, working out,\nor cuddling with your pet all\ntrigger oxytocin production.\nKnow why we suggest this?\nBasically because the activities\nnot only make you happy\nbut many of the activities\ncan help others be happy too.\nOxytocin is one of the big\nthree happy hormones after all.\nIt's been found too that\nthis hormone can decrease\nstress and anxiety.\nSo it gives happy and deducts\nstress and anxiety, win-win.\nAnd number five, know\nthat you're worth it.\nThose old shampoo commercials\nhad a point, you are worth it.\nYep, our last tip for today\nis to practice self-love.\nSelf-love can help you extend\ncompassion towards yourself,\nallowing you to perform\nself-care free of guilt\nor adding more stress.\nNever feel that tending to your own health\nis a waste of time or that\nyou could be doing something\nmore important.\nYou are the most important thing to you,\nyour existence depends on it.\nBurnout can happen to\nanyone, it does not matter\nif you're in school or\nat a job or trying to get\nyour own business going\nor a mom, or a dad.\nBurnout is a creeper that can pounce\nwhen you least expect it,\nhappening to the seemingly\nhealthiest of us.\nWe mean you're not alone\nor defective or inept.\nBurnout essentially means\nthat your own personal care\nhas been sacrificed in\npursuit of outward rewards.\nWhether that pressure has\nbeen put on you by yourself\nor by a boss, take a moment\nto realize that nothing\nis worth your health and\nthat you deserve to be happy\nno matter how much the bottom\nline is going to affect\nquarterly profits, you got this\nand we're with you on that.\nDid you see or hear\nsomething that could help you\nor someone you know?\nComment below and give us a like.\nTake a break and reach\nout to others for help\nand we hope you found\nsomething helpful here.\nMaybe we will take a breather\ntogether again next time.\nThanks for watching."
