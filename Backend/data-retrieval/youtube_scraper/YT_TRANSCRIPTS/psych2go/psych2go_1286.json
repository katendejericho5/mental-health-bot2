    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nHave you ever asked a question\nthat made everyone\nfeel awkward and uncomfortable?\nSometimes you might not be aware\nof what you say\nand end up overstepping\nor offending the people around you.\nThere are questions you may ask others\nor even yourself\nthat don't really help your situation,\nand may even worsen it.\nFor this reason,\nit's important to be aware\nof the things you say.\nTo look more into this topic,\nhere are five questions\nintelligent people don't ask.\nNumber one, \"Don't you think we should...\"\nDon't you think we should\ndo this instead of that?\nOr eat here instead of there?\nwhen you ask questions like these,\nyou're not really allowing others\nto give their thoughts\nand input on the matter.\nRather, you're already assuming\nthat your idea or plan\nis the way to go,\nand just want someone to agree\nand nod along to what you've said.\nBecause of this,\npeople who are intelligent\ntend to avoid phrasing\ntheir questions like this\nsince it doesn't allow people\nto contribute, discuss,\nand come up with different types\nof solutions to a problem.\nIt limits creativity and variety.\nSo the next time you catch yourself asking\nyes or no questions like this,\ntry to come up with more open-end ones\nthat allow people really\ngive their thoughts.\nNumber two, \"Why aren't you...\"\nWhy aren't you in college?\nin a relationship?\nOr working a job right now?\nThese questions often create\na lot of tension\nbecause they can make\nthe other person uncomfortable, offended,\nand defensive very quickly.\nBy phrasing your question like this,\nyou're implying that\nthey aren't following the same timeline\nas everyone else.\nAnd so, are not doing\nwhat they're supposed to be doing.\nFor this reason, when said,\nit can come off as\njudgmental, patronizing,\nand insulting to that person.\nDuring moments like this,\nit's important to remember\nthat not everyone\ndoes everything the same way.\nPeople come from different backgrounds,\nhave different circumstances,\npreferences, and priorities.\nAnd so, will have different timelines.\nNumber three, \"Why are\nyour eye bags so big?\"\nAny question related\nto someone's appearance\nis usually not something you should ask.\nWhether it's large eye bags,\npimples on the face,\nor a change in weight,\na person's physical appearance\ncan be a sensitive topic for some.\nAnd therefore, questions\nand comments about it\ncan come off as insensitive and hurtful,\neven if your intention is good\nand you're just worried\nand concerned for their health.\nYou never know what they're going through\nand/or experiencing.\nThey may be struggling\nwith their mental health,\nor are having a hard\ntime at work or at home,\nwhich caused their change in appearance.\nSo try to avoid questions\nrelated to someone's\nphysical characteristics\nand go for topics that\nare more interesting.\nNumber four, \"What can\nI give to this person?\"\nIs there someone you're interested in?\nDo you ask yourself this\nwhenever you like someone?\nWondering what you can\ngive to another person\nand doubting whether it's enough\nassumes that you have\nto have something to offer\nto be worthy of friendship or love.\nThis is just not true.\nA good and healthy relationship\nis not like a business agreement\nwhere you calculate what you give and take\nfrom each other,\nor about how you can earn\ntheir attention or affection.\nIt's not all about the job,\nthe looks or the money.\nInstead, what really matters\nare the qualities and quirks\nthat make you who you are.\nBe yourself and they'll come\nto appreciate and love\nthe person that you are.\nRemember that you are\nand will always be enough.\nAnd number five,\n\"Shouldn't you know what I need and want?\"\nIs this something you say\nto your friend or partner?\nSometimes when we've known someone\nfor a really long time\nor have spent a lot of time with them,\nyou may find yourself feeling\nvery in tune with them.\nHowever, even though it may feel\nlike you can read each other's minds,\nit doesn't mean that you really can.\nAs a result,\nyou may find yourself getting\nmore irritated and angry\nwhen your loved ones\ndon't know when something is bothering you\nor aren't helping you\nwhen you need them to.\nSo instead of asking them this\nand getting frustrated\nwhen they don't know\nwhat you want them to do,\ntry to remind yourself\nto communicate your needs to them\nso that they can help you\nin the way that you want them to.\nDo you ask these questions?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever Psych2Go\nposts a new video.\nThe references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThanks for watching\nand see you next time."
