    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, there Psych2Goers,\ntoday we're gonna try something new.\nIt's time for a trivia quiz. Woohoo!\nAccording to a study by Queens University,\nhow many thoughts does the\naverage person have per day?\nComment your answers below.\nA, 2,700.\nB, 6,200.\nOr C, 15,900.\nHave you picked your answer yet?\nWell, we're gonna reveal the answer\nat the end of this video, so stay tuned.\nNow back to the video.\nWe have a lot of thoughts per day\nbut we know that not\nall thoughts are equal.\nSome are useful and healthy\nwhile others are harsh and unhealthy.\nEven worse, when we\noverthink unhealthy thoughts,\nwe're at risk of mental\nconditions like depression,\nbut how can we tell if our thoughts\nare putting us at risk?\nHere are five signs overthinking\nis giving you depression.\nNumber one, you worry about problems\ninstead of looking for solutions.\nAre you bothered by a current problem,\nsomething that happened in the past\nor expectations in the future?\nIt's natural to think about\nsituations that affect us\nbut we should focus our\nattention on finding a solution.\nIf you are repeatedly\ndwelling on bad outcomes,\nemotional stress, or how\nthings are out of control,\nthis is unhealthy rumination.\nStudies show that people with depression\nclaim to be reflecting on problems\nto get a better understanding of them.\nBut when they say their thoughts out loud\nthey are clearly ruminating\non the same negative emotions\nover and over without any real goal.\nSo the next time you think\nabout a problem ask yourself,\nis this productive worry\nor is this just worrying\nfor the sake of worrying?\nNumber two, you brood on your mood.\nWhen you're in a bad\nmood, how do you cope?\nHealthy ways include\nspending time with others,\ndistracting yourself with a hobby,\nor understanding the cause\nso you can prevent it in the future.\nBut it's unhealthy to\nbrood on your bad mood\nand its consequences,\nlike wondering whether it\nwill look bad to others,\nwhether you'll get anything done today,\nor how long the negative\nemotions might last.\nDwelling on negative\nfeelings can cause them\nto spiral out of control and\nput you at risk of depression.\nSo the next time you're in a bad mood\ntry not to trap yourself\nin the same emotional state\nby dwelling on it.\nNumber three, you dwell on\nyour personal shortcomings.\nIf I asked you to picture your ideal self\nhow similar would it be\nto your present self?\nWas the comparison\ninspiring you to try harder\nor was it discouraging and negative?\nSelf-awareness is a very useful skill,\nas it helps us reflect on our\nactions and improve ourselves.\nBut dwelling only on your shortcomings\ncan lead to excessive self criticism\nand a negative sense of self.\nResearch shows that when we become aware\nof goals we've failed,\nstandards we don't reach\nand mistakes we've made,\nwe experience anxiety\nand a need to escape.\nIf we keep thinking about these things\nthe feelings can develop into depression\nand the need to escape can develop\ninto thoughts of self\nharm or even suicide.\nSo the next time you become\naware of your shortcomings\ntry to think about your strengths as well.\nNumber four, you think\nthe future is hopeless.\nDo you have hope for the future?\nAs mentioned, thinking about problems\nor personal shortcomings is healthy\nwhen it's directed towards improvement,\nbut people with depression usually feel\nthat there is no hope for the future\nand improvement is impossible.\nThey dwell on the idea that\ntheir situation is fixed.\nEverything is out of their control\nand they'll be flawed forever.\nNeedless to say, thinking that\nnothing will ever get better\nwill only make you fail more,\nmaking the problem worse.\nSo the next time you're\nfaced with problems\nfind reasons to hope for a good outcome\nor redirect your attention\nto other problems\nwhere you can make a difference.\nAnd number five, you\nengage in meta-rumination.\nNow that we've talked\nabout how negative thinking\ncan give you depression,\nlet's go up another level.\nHow often do you dwell on\nyour own negative thinking?\nResearch shows that people with depression\nnot only engage in unhealthy rumination,\nthey also engage in meta-rumination,\nwhich means they ruminate on\ntheir negative rumination.\nEvery time they catch themselves thinking\nin negative or unhealthy ways\nthey judge themselves for overthinking,\nworry about their own thinking patterns,\nand feel like their minds are doomed\nto be like that forever.\nOn top of the original negative thoughts\nthese extra ruminations add to the problem\nand further the depression.\nSo the next time you notice\nyou're thinking in negative\nways, try to deal with it\nwithout judging yourself\ntoo harshly for it.\nOkay, so remember the trivia quiz earlier?\nWe're gonna reveal the answer now.\nThe correct answer is B.\nAccording to a study by Queens University\nthe average person has\n6,200 thoughts per day.\nWhich answer did you pick?\nCan you relate to any of\nthe thoughts mentioned?\nLet us know in the comments below\nand don't forget to like\nand share this video\nif you think it'll help someone else.\nThe studies and references used\nare added in the description below.\nUntil next time in and\nthanks for watching."
