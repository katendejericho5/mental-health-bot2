    "transcript": "in previous videos we've discussed\ngaslighting and what it is to give a\nbrief recap gaslighting refers to\nemotionally abusive Behavior but not all\nemotional abuse is gaslighting\ngaslighting is a manipulative tactic\nused to invalidate someone's feelings\nAmerican Psychological association's\ndefinition is to manipulate another\nperson into doubting his or her\nperceptions experiences or understanding\nof events the manipulation can be so bad\nthat it can sometimes lead to mental\nillness in the individual being\nmanipulated many assume that lying and\ngaslighting are the same but they are\nnot intention plays a big part for\nexample you're trying on a jacket but\nyou feel insecure about it you ask your\nfriend for their opinion and they tell\nyou you look great but you still feel\ninsecure despite your insecurity and\nconcerns your friend assures you that\nyou look great dismiss your concerns and\ninsists you buy it technically this can\nbe seen as gaslighting because your\nconcerns are being invalidated but it's\nunlikely that your friend's intention is\nto cause you emotional distress\ngaslighting is less about convincing\nthan it is about shifting blame although\nthey may use lies to convince you so\nwhat are the signs that someone's\ngaslighting you someone who is\ngaslighting you will lie and insist that\nyou did something you did not do this\ndiscredit your memory or perception of\nan event call you names popular ones are\nsensitive or crazy when you express your\nneeds or concerns turn others against\nyou and make them doubt you insist that\ntheir perception is correct and yours is\nwrong let's take a closer look at these\nsigns lying lying is the most obvious\nsign that someone is gaslighting you but\nnot everyone who lies is doing so with\nthe intent to Gaslight you usually\npeople lie to protect themselves or\ncover something up however when someone\nlies in order to Gaslight someone it\nfeels very different there is an\nintention behind it according to a very\nwell article by certified professional\nlife coach and bullying prevention\nAdvocate Sheri Gordon gaslighters are\nhabitual liars and exhibit narcissistic\nTendencies meaning they lie frequently\nand for personal gain most of their lies\nare to discre at you even when you\nprovide proof of their deception because\nthey are habitual Liars their lies sound\nvery convincing thus making you second\nguess yourself their intention is\nusually to gain control over you\ndiscrediting to support their deceptions\nmany gaslighters go the extra mile they\nspread rumors about you or even give you\nfalse information they might tell you\nthat so and so Harbors negative feelings\nor thoughts against you this tactic\nserves to further isolate you from\nothers and make it easier to manipulate\nyou another common way gaslighters try\nto discredit you is by pretending they\npretend to worry about you or your\nwell-being when in reality they are\ntrying to make you worry and doubt\nyourself usually their fake concern is\ndisguised with compassionate phrases\nlike I would never do anything to hurt\nyou or I care about you so this is why\nI'm acting or saying this to you they\ntrigger the emotional aspect of the\nrelationship you formed with them and\nappealed to your compassion so that you\nbelieve them minimizing part of trying\nto discredit you involves minimizing or\ncontrolling your emotions they may tell\nyou to calm down or that you're\noverreacting to one of their deceptions\nthe intention behind this is to regulate\nyour emotional response which in turn\ncauses you to doubt your own beliefs and\nthoughts as Gordon writes in her article\nwhen you deal with someone who never\nacknowledges your thoughts feelings or\nbeliefs you may begin to question them\nyourself what's more you may never feel\nvalidated or understood which can be\nextremely isolating shaming and\ndifficult to cope with blaming a\ngaslighter always shifts blame and\nresponsibility away from themselves this\nis why they use kind words and false\nconcern to make you feel as though you\nare at fault regardless of the proof you\npresent they will never admit to their\ndeception or wrongdoings slowly you may\nstart to think that you really are the\nproblem as a result you begin to take on\nguilt blame and responsibility for every\noutcome even though it was never in your\ncontrol however while in a relationship\nwith a gaslighter you may never realize\nthis you might continue to blame\nyourself and apologize for things that\nare not your fault gaslighting may be\ndifficult to spot and to address but\nthere are ways you can regain power\nreach out to trusted family members or\nfriends who are not directly involved\nand ask for their perspective doing so\ncan give you Clarity on the situation\nalso keep a record of your activity that\nway you have solid proof in case a\ngaslighter tries to manipulate your\nperception of things lastly set clear\nboundaries in the relationship this will\nprotect you from further gaslighting\nattempts it may be difficult ult to
