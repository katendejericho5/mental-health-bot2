you notice\nthem looking at you more often are they\nextra cheerful or smile frequently and\ntalk more than usual when with you\nthe next time you're with the person in\nquestion note how often they look at you\nHarvard psychologist zik Rubin found a\ncorrelation between eye contact and love\nin his study couples deeply in love look\nat one another 75 percent of the time\nwhile talking while other people engaged\nin conversation only look at each other\nabout 30 to 60 percent of the time if\nthey want to leave a good long-lasting\nimpression by sounding enthusiastic\ninquisitive and jolly it's a dead\ngiveaway that this person likes your\ncompany and cares about your impression\nof them so it's imperative to try and\nfigure out if they are putting in a lot\nof effort this could be a sign that this\nperson is into you number four they'll\ndo things to show that they care do they\ntext you or call you after you spend\ntime together to make sure you got home\nsafe do they regularly ask your friends\nabout you do they offer to help you\nwithout you asking them first\ntheir interest in your well-being may be\nanother sign that they care about you\nand how you're doing or feeling\nhowever these subtle things could easily\nbe confused with a caring friend as well\nbut if you find that they'll go out of\ntheir way to check in with you then it\nis possible that they have a crush on\nyou or have feelings for you number five\nthey may be overly curious about you do\nyou find them asking you questions about\nyou and your life do you find that they\nwant to know more

you or that they don't like you\nsome people just don't know how to\ncompliment or might not feel comfortable\ndoing so however if you notice that they\nmay be complimenting you excessively\nthat may be a sign that a person is\ninterested in you because they want you\nto feel good this person wants you to\nlike them and give them the validation\nthat they crave the person in question\nmay be investing in you and wants you to\nfeel secure and comfortable around them\nnumber seven they may act unusual around\nyou have they ever stumbled over their\nwords or become tense or nervous when\nyou
