    "transcript": "how was your life before the pandemic\nso not to brag or anything but my life\nbefore 2020 was in freaking credible i\nwas crushing it in sports and academics\nwere my muse i had so much energy and\nlove of life that i volunteered too you\nknow to share that love\nhigh school can be a jungle but i was on\nan adventure safari with my friends and\nclassmates so it was all good\nand despite what y'all might think of\nschool i looked forward to going every\nday to expand my knowledge pool\ni think you all know what happened next\nthe pandemic was announced and the\nadventure was cut short i was in\nlockdown like the rest of you and for me\nit was like house arrest but worse at\nleast in house arrest you can have\npeople come over hanging out with\nfriends in school were now just these\nmoving images on a monitor through a\nvideo call\nvolunteering became hopeless too i mean\ni couldn't exactly teleport food or make\nobjects through a laptop screen\nnot like there were events to volunteer\nat anyhow oh and sports\ngoodbye team games hello to taking\nfurtive runs or walks around my\nneighborhood\nchoosing odd hours so i don't get too\nclose to anyone else taking a walk you'd\nthink that being able to at least talk\nto your friends would help but when it's\nrestricted to discord chats that have\nvoice delays or lockdown snapchats it\nstarts to feel unreal\nit feels cold my mental health was\nplummeting and my days became a gray\nwash of so what who cares the most\nalluring part of my days was now going\nto sleep because at least in dreams i\ncould escape this confinement\nrather than the joy of life providing\nthe wave on which i could surf\nmy only push now was more like a cattle\nprod\nand that was the pressure of university\napplications i had to do well or else\nthere really would be no hope at all for\nclimbing out of this pit\nthat's what i felt anyhow so you can\nimagine hearing about the transition\nback to actual physical classrooms i was\nelated i was nearly bursting with\neagerness to go back feeling like yes\nthis was all a nightmare and it's about\nto end\nthe result was less than spectacular we\nweren't really back in class so much as\na bunch of sheep herded into a pen\nlectured for two hours then heard it out\nso the next group could take their turn\nwe were even admonished for not\nappreciating the hurting being told we\ncould have just been told to stay home\nand online\ni tried to appreciate it i did i just\ncouldn't bring myself to like being\ngiven less in fact i hated it i hated\neverything about this whole stupid\nsituation i hated being forced to cram\nand jam a year's worth of our course\nmaterials into two months they hated the\nconsistent sanitizing while worrying\nabout being infected school was now just\nanother prison full of other unhappy\nprisoners\ni had to just get through each day\ni'm not sure i would have made it\nwithout the support of friends family\nand knowing that the entire world was\nprobably going through the same thing\nthankfully nearly two years later\nthere's a visible light to this journey\nand things have grown more optimistic\nthe school days are now full days with\nsports and volunteering but there's\nstill an underlying scar from the\nexperiences of the lockdown\ni know that the experience will never be\nforgotten and we can never just go back\nto how things were\nbut we can heal and the scar will fade\nalthough i would rather none of the\ntraumatic events had ever happened\nthey did and i learned from that\nexperience i hope that others will as\nwell"
