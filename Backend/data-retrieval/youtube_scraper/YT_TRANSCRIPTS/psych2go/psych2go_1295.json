    "transcript": "answer truthfully\ndo you think your parents your family\nand home life are perfect\nchances are you probably said no right\nbut do you still think that your parents\ndid a good job of raising you and giving\nyou a good life\nas we grow older we start to appreciate\nour parents more because we become\nmature enough to realize that what they\ndo definitely isn't easy but with that\nmaturity also comes a certain clarity\nthat some of the things they do are\nactually doing more harm than good here\nare seven telltale signs that although\nyour parents might genuinely love you\ntheir actions are still toxic\nnumber one they downplay your\nachievements\ndo you ever get excited to tell your\nparents about your good news be it a\ngood grade a promotion or an award you\njust got only for them to sour the\nexperience by shrugging it off and\ndownplaying your achievements\noh is that all you can do better they\nmay tell you it's emotionally draining\nand invalidating to never have your\nparents tell you you did a good job or\nthat they're proud of you\nnumber two they set their expectations\ntoo high\nsimilar to the last point parents will\nsometimes set their expectations too\nhigh because they think constantly\npushing their child to be the very best\nthey can be is what's best for them\nbut that kind of pressure takes a toll\non a person's mental and emotional\nwell-being and no matter how much you\nachieve or how successful you become you\nstill find yourself feeling like a\nfailure for not living up to your\nparents unrealistically high\nexpectations\nnumber three\nthey're overly controlling\nanother way parents can love you in a\ntoxic way is by smothering you with\ntheir overly controlling parenting\nsome parents want to decide everything\nfor their child and control every aspect\nof their life because they feel they\nwill always know what's best\nsometimes it's because they're just\nbeing protective and want to shelter you\nfrom the harsh realities of life\nother times parents act this way because\nthey're afraid their child might be\ngoing down the wrong path\nwhatever their reasons may be however it\nstill doesn't justify this toxic\nbehavior\nnumber four they treat you like a child\nhave you ever felt like your parents\nstill see you as a child and treat you\nlike one do they ever talk down to you\nor act like you can't take care of\nyourself that you don't know what's best\nor that you're incapable of deciding\nthings for yourself\nwell it's only natural for parents to\nfeel protective of their children and\nwant to take care of them no matter how\nold they get it's also unhealthy to keep\ninfantilizing them disrespecting their\nboundaries and smothering them with too\nmuch attention\nnumber five they taught you self-blame\nwhen something bad happens to you what\ndo you usually attribute it to\nif the answer is myself or something i\ndid then you probably struggle with a\nlot of feelings of guilt and self-blame\nand it might be because the way you've\nbeen raised has taught you to feel that\nway\nparents may make their children believe\nthat everything that happens to them is\nsomehow their fault because they didn't\ntry hard enough or they did something\nwrong number six\nthey close off communication\nhave your parents ever told you to just\nstop crying and put on a happy face\ninstead\nas well intentioned as their advice\nmight have been the truth is helping a\nchild express and deal with their\nemotions in a healthy way is one of the\nmost difficult but most crucial aspects\nof parenting and unfortunately some\nparents just aren't emotionally well\nadjusted enough to do that\nafter all how can you teach what you\ndon't know\nso instead of practicing honest and open\ncommunication at home you've learned to\nbe emotionally closed off like your\nparents taught you and instead turn to\nunhealthy coping mechanisms like denial\nand avoidance to deal with your\ndifficult emotions\nand number seven\nthey are emotionally unavailable\nlast but certainly not the least\neven if your parents were physically\nthere for you and financially supported\nyou they can still be toxic if they were\nemotionally unavailable to you and\ndeprived you of the love warmth\nvalidation and acceptance you needed\nit can be a difficult thing to accept\nbecause you feel like you should just be\ngrateful for what you have after all so\nmany more people have it worse right\nbut a parent's duty doesn't just end\nwith showing up to pay the bills or go\nthrough all the motions of parenting\nparents should be our pillars of\nstrength and support in times of\nemotional need\nso do you relate to any of the things\nwe've mentioned here did watching this\nvideo make you realize that your parents\nmight be toxic for you\njust because a person loves us doesn't\ngive them the right to hurt us\nwhether or not it's done intentionally\nso if you're emotionally or\npsychologically struggling right now\nplease do not hesitate to reach out to\ntalk to a mental health professional\ntoday\nyou"
