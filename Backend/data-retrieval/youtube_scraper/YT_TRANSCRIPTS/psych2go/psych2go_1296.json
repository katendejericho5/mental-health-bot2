    "transcript": "what greater love is there than a mother\nfor their child that feeling of safety\nwarmth encouragement\nwait\nare you wondering what we're talking\nabout does it sound strange or\nunfamiliar to you\nyou're not imagining things despite the\nsocial and media insistence that parents\nalways love their child and you owe your\nmother everything because no one loves\nyou like her\nparents can be toxic to their children\nit's not okay and no one should be\nexpected to put up with the abuse\nalthough both parents can be toxic\nmothers tend to use emotional\nmanipulations so the child grows to\nbelieve the abuse is normal deserved or\neven required for them to grow up\nproperly toxic mothers do it for control\nand to assuage their own shortcomings\nhere it's like to go we're going to\nuncover a few of those toxic bites and\nhopefully take away their teeth\nnumber one i carried you for nine months\ntoxic mothers phrase this as a you owe\nme statement\nshe's saying she suffered for you and\ngave you the great gift of life so if\nyou don't pay her back with total\nobedience you're a bad child\nand\nthat's utter hogwash this isn't like\npaying for lunch because they spotted\nyou on a few weeks ago\nthis was a conscious choice that she\nmade of her own free will\nhow could you possibly have had a say in\nyour own conception you did not choose\nto be born\nit makes absolutely no sense that you\nwould owe them regarding a decision they\nthe adult made before you existed\nif you gave someone a ticket to an event\nthey never mentioned and never wanted to\ngo to would you automatically think they\nnow owe you premium concert merch you\nare an individual with your own mind and\nthe free will that comes with it\nyou are responsible for what you choose\nto do\nnot what they chose\nnumber two\nyou're too sensitive similarly you might\nhave heard you can't take a joke or\nyou're such a cry baby or even you're so\nweak what does that even bother you\nsometimes people do get extra touchy but\nit's not constant if this berating is\nconstant this could mean she's being\ndismissive of the child's feelings and\ninvalidating them\nit's also a form of gaslighting\nand the child is young\nthey've little to no frame of reference\nto step back and determine is it really\nunreasonable to feel hurt by this\nso when everything they feel is\ndismissed or reprimanded as too\nsensitive they become conditioned to\nbelieve that their own wounds don't\nmatter\nand that they're defective for being\nhurt by the abuse\nthis allows the toxic mother all the\ncontrol\nnumber three\nmy child is smart but too lazy to try\nuh we'll say this straight up\nit is not normal nor healthy for mothers\nto insult their children\nmaternal instinct should guide the\nmother to nurture the child's emotional\nhealth\nnot attempt its destruction\nthey might say you're feeding the\nchild's determination to prove the\nparent wrong by doing well\npreposterous\nit's not normal parenting to drive a\nchild to succeed through vengeance or\nhumiliation\nthe insult and belittlement isn't even a\ntrue assessment of the child it's from\nthe mother's projection of her own\nperceived failures and her perception of\nthe child not as an individual but a\nsubservient extension of herself\nif she did not achieve life satisfaction\nit's abhorrent to her that the child\nmight succeed at or even surpass her\nshould the child show talent at\nsomething it's crushed being called\nstupid nonsense may be wasteful\nshould the child speak up then they're\nderided as prideful and shot down this\nway she will always be better and always\nbe superior number four\nyou're my child and i have the right to\nsince the child is dependent the mother\nof course must take some control and\nguidance in order to teach and raise the\nchild\nwhat's toxic is when there is absolutely\nno lesson or life skill associated with\nthe breach of trust or the demand\nan involuntary room search and clean for\nreasons of health and safety is\njustifiable\nwhen it's treated like a random prison\ncell tossing to find reasons to\ncriticize or extort the child that's\ntoxic\nimplicit dominance is often wielded as\njustification\ni as a mother overrule everything you\nsay and it's my house so your room is\nactually mine it's a way to humiliate\nthe child and take away their individual\nrights as a person\nagain this is to keep the child in their\ncontrol like a puppet rather than a\nhuman number six why aren't you as good\nas this other child\ncomparison can be a good thing and can\nso easily become a toxic thing\ntoxic mothers use comparisons to break\nthe child down ensuring their\nsubservience\nthe constant comparison is cramming the\nchild into a box of unworthiness a\ncomplete belief that they are not good\nenough as their own person\nthe instability the child feels has them\ndesperately seeking an anchor\nwhich the tox mom ensures she's right\nthere to be\nthe child latches on\ndepending on her completely and once\nagain she has total control this control\nmakes her feel superior choosing to cope\nwith her own insecurities by stepping on\nthe child\nnumber seven\nyou're going to be seen like that\nthis can certainly be said in different\nways to help the child know if what\nthey're wearing really is inappropriate\nor unsafe\nlike wearing dirty jeans with a pajama\ntop to an office job interview or\nwearing flip-flops in the snow\nbut with toxic moms it's not to help you\nthey undermine your self-confidence and\nenforce feelings of inadequacy and shame\never heard the phrase a face only a\nmother could love\nso what does the child think when even\ntheir mother dislikes their look\nthe child thinks they must be all wrong\na failure and a hopeless case\nand that is not true\neveryone has something they dislike even\nthe most popular celebrities have their\nshare of haters\npeople have different tastes and\ndifferent doesn't mean bad\nunless you are specifically trying to\ncultivate your appearance to a vision\nyour mother has created hey if your\nmom's a fashion designer and you're into\nher spring line no judgment here\ntake her comments with a grain of salt\nand do yourself up the way you like\nand number eight i don't know why i even\nbother with you\nthis is referring to the process of\nusing shame as a tool to mold their\nchild into a subservient\nit's an oft-used tactic that flies under\nthe radar due to popular parental usage\nit's not the healthiest form of\ndiscipline\nbut it's toxically wrong if used when\nthe child has done absolutely nothing to\nbe ashamed about\nconsistent undeserved shaming convinces\nthe child that they are bad and\neffective at their very core\nthis leads them to expect that no one\nwill ever care about them as they don't\ndeserve it\nhowever the worst conclusion is that\nsince toxic moms show some affection\ntheir child clings to them believing\nthat the meaker scraps of affection are\ntreasured gifts\nlooking at the future impact of these\nabusive phrases this could lead to the\nchild acting out\nmaybe becoming suicidal should the child\nlater in life come to realize what the\nmother has been doing this could also\nlead to a complete serving of the mother\nchild connection\nnone of these are happy results all of\nthem leave scars\ndid you relate to these points\nlet us know in the comments\nif you believe you or someone else is in\na toxic relation just a reminder that\nthere are mental health professionals\navailable for advice and help\nlet us know in the comments below what\nyou think and stay strong stay true to\nyourself and we'll see you next time"
