    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you know someone that\nyou think may have anxiety,\nbut you're not sure?\nAnxiety doesn't have the\nsingle face of outwardly,\nobvious signs like fidgeting\nor erratic breathing.\nThere are different types of anxiety\nand different tolerances\nor ability to hide it.\nWe're here to provide some info\nso that you may be able\nto be there for someone\nwho may be too embarrassed or fearful\nto ask for help outright.\nYou know that the surface\ncan hide many things,\nso let's peel a little bit back\nand look at some signs of hidden anxiety.\nNumber one: irritability and anger.\nPeople with anxiety\ntend to feel irritable,\nwhich can then escalate\ninto expressions of anger.\nTo the outsider,\nit can look like the\nperson is moody or testy,\nsometimes without an apparent reason.\nThis is often from the anxious person\nhiding a constant multitude\nof worries over time,\nallowing them to brew.\nWhere this moodiness turns into anger\nis when the worries start\ngetting interpreted as threats,\nanxiety does a great job\nof upping and exaggerating\nthe freak out level\nof even the smallest thing.\nThe outburst of anger could\nwell be the anxious individual\nunleashing a protective response.\nNumber two: overly conscientious.\nThis one is tricky and tends\nto be downplayed or ignored\nsince it usually benefits others.\nThe outside world gets\nthis super meticulous,\nincredibly prepared individual\nwho shows up extra early to appointments,\nfinishes their work far\nbefore the deadline,\nand all while being well\ndressed with perfect hair.\nIn fact, the work is\nfinished so efficiently,\nthe person has time to assist others.\nDoesn't that sound great?\nWait, not so fast.\nWatch out for these things\nhappening to an abnormal extent.\nSure, it's easy to wave\nit off as thinking,\nwell, if they can do it, why not?\nBut before you happily skip off\nto reap the rewards of their hard work,\nconsider what's actually happening.\nCompanies have a tendency\nto take advantage of\nand exploit the symptoms,\npiling on more work and expectations.\nUnfortunately, this is kind of terrible\nfor the person with anxiety.\nThey're still human,\nand as such, they still\nhave the same human limits.\nAll those extras they take on\nsimply fast-track them\nto burnout or a meltdown.\nThey may be overextending\nthemselves to conceal fears\nof failure and nervous energy.\nThey could be trying to live up\nto their unreasonable\nexpectations of themselves,\novercompensating in all areas\nto alleviate their failure phobia.\nThis is not sustainable.\nNumber three: endless criticism.\nThe follow up to the previous point\nabout over conscientiousness\nis the anxietist person's inner critique,\nit's loud, it's constant,\nand it's a real Karen.\nNot only do those with anxiety\napply strict criticisms to themselves,\nbut also to people around them,\nmaking those people pull away,\nleading to more anxiety.\nYou can see how this excessive worry\nreadily starts the domino effect\nof making a mountain out of a molehill.\nThey see many things around\nthem are scary or wrong,\njust as they perceive things\nthat they themselves do are wrong.\nThey believe that what\nthey do or say could lead\nto failure, rejection,\nterrible things, and so on.\nThe endlessness of the what-if worry\nand the and so on scenarios\nslide them down the slippery\nslope of hyperbolic fear\nwith hyper self-criticism as\ntheir only rope to safety.\nTo increase the feeling\nof safety or control,\nthey might start trying\nto control the environment\nby becoming hypercritical\nof friends and family.\nNumber four: codependency.\nThis one stems from the fear of losing,\ndisappointing or being\nrejected by other people.\nThe fear is such a destabilizing force\nthat they constantly are thinking\nthey'll be suddenly abandoned.\nTo alleviate this fear,\nthey cling extra tight to a loved one.\nThey might also be blindly loyal to them\nand only live life\nthrough the other person.\nThis codependency tendency\ncan display itself\nby too frequent calls,\nconstant checking in for no reason\nother than I just wanted to know.\nThey may even refuse to leave their home\nwithout the person they\nfear losing the most.\nNumber five:\nunusually overbooked or\nunderbooked social schedule.\nThis is swinging from one\nend of social busy-ness\nto the other,\ndepending on if the greater\nfear is losing people\nor other self-directed phobias.\nThe fear of losing people, in general,\ncan manifest as an unusually\noverbooked social schedule.\nTheir thoughts and feelings\nare geared and locked in\non the perception that they\ncannot refuse anyone anything,\nbecause if they do,\nthey'll be dropped or otherwise rejected.\nIf the greater, overwhelming fears\nare things like embarrassing\nthemselves in public,\nbeing trapped in certain spaces\nor other things that\nincrease in likelihood\nwith socialization,\ntheir schedule becomes a barren wasteland.\nKeep in mind too,\nthat although this can\nsound somewhat reasonable,\nthe fears are from a place\nof warped perception.\nSo embarrassing themselves in public\ncould be something no one even noticed,\nbut the person with anxiety\nfeels they've shamed themself forever.\nAnd number six: fidgety\nor restless body language.\nThis is something that\ncan be physically observed\nin the moment.\nAnxiety can make a person\nmore restless and on edge,\nsince they're already\nhyper-conscious about how they look,\nhow others see them, and so on,\nthe nervous energy has to go somewhere.\nThe nervous energy leaks out\nin subtle fidgety actions and gestures\nsuch as shifty or avoidant eye contact,\nknuckle cracking, lip biting,\nplaying with hair or clothes,\nor even nonstop rambling.\nThis physical response to\nrestlessness can become habitual,\nsuch as constantly finding\nsomething to occupy their mind\nlike social media\nscrolling or mobile games.\nIf socializing causes anxiety,\nisolating habits can also crop up,\nlike having headphones on in public,\nso that person may not be\nstandoffish or purposefully rude,\nthey could just have anxiety.\nAs we've seen, anxiety disorders\nare complex and varied,\nsymptoms can be similar\nbut not identical between the\ndifferent types of anxiety\nand can be experienced in varying degrees.\nAll that said, though,\nthere is a normal range of anxiety\nexperienced by most people.\nSo no, being anxious\nbecause of a specific event,\nlike a test or a presentation,\nis not a disorder.\nA disorder is when the anxiety\nhas gone beyond that normal range\nand is now causing clinically\nsignificant distress\nor impairment in multiple,\noften everyday aspects of life.\nIt can be difficult to\ndiscern either way though,\nand the only ones who\ncan give you a clear,\ndefinite diagnosis are doctors.\nThey're also the best\nones equipped to help,\nor at least guide a person\nto appropriate help,\nso reach out if you need it.\nDid you find this video helpful?\nLet us know in the comments.\nWe hope this video has helped\na bit to calm your nerves,\nand we'd love to see you\nat the next info byte.\nIn the meantime, comment, like, and share.\nSee you soon."
