you so please you know um\nyou know chat uh\nchat us where you're coming in from\nand\nwould love to hear from you so today i'm\nactually in california i know that i've\ndone live streams here from south korea\nbefore today i am actually in um in\nsouthern california joining in from here\nso we have italy we have colorado we\nhave iowa we have philippines bangladesh\nuk\nindia\nwow sweden\namazing\nyeah\nlook at all these people and if you guys\nare in ukraine right now watching this\nlook at all these people who've joined\nin live right now to support\nto support world peace to support y'alls\nto support\nyou know just people um who's promoting\npeace\namazing there's people from japan south\nafrica germany literally from all over\nthe world this is amazing this is so\namazing\nso\num for those of you who's just joining\nin again my name is yuri choi and the\nreason that we are doing this today\num is because\nthere's a conflict going on in ukraine\nright now\nand this isn't a political thing this is\nreally about protecting the innocent\npeople promoting peace\nand\nreally just showing up for each other\nbecause i believe that we have a\npowerful platform here on psych2go where\nwe get to do this where we get to come\ntogether\nand rise together especially during\ndifficult times like this and this is\nsomething that i'm really passionate\nabout for those of you and by the way me\nbeing an empath as well\nit's been an intense week i don't know\nabout you guys but even leading up to\nthis conflict this really intense\nconflict horrible conflict in ukraine\num\ni was like having really crazy dreams i\nwas you know just really feeling a lot\nand i was like and there was so many of\nus who are empaths who are feeling this\nway who are feeling really intense and\nwe didn't know why\nso when this happens like oh wow this is\nwhat we were feeling into\nso if you guys have been feeling this\neven prior to this um you know war\nhappening or\nyou know in the last week especially in\nthe last week with all the you know\nviolent footages and all the things\ngoing on um i'm with you\nand this is actually a powerful way\nfor us to be able to transmute this\nenergy\num\nof you know feeling\nthese intense emotions throughout this\ntime\nand one of them is to really show up for\none another\nto transmute this energy into something\npowerful to a cause that actually brings\nmore love and peace into this world\nso if you guys are hearing here right\nnow just know that this is an\nopportunity for you to do that\nyeah so i i'm just\num i'm just looking at the chat it's\ngoing by really fast i'm just really\ntrying to catch up here\nso um with that said one of the things\nthat we get to think about\nis um\nwell let's talk about it in three\ndifferent layers and we can start with\nthe individual layer\nthis is a time that we get to really\nreally focus on self-care even more um\nyou know do the things that keep you\ngrounded do the things that keep you\nyou know happy and just\ncalm and peaceful because all of this\nenergy does add up to the\ncollective you know when you are\ngrounded and when you are centered\nyou're going to get into less conflicts\non a very micro level\nand that's actually really powerful as\nwell\nthe next thing is looking at it as a\ncommunity or\neven country\nsee what you can do within your country\nwithin your community\nto seek out like who you can help\nwhether it's this particular cause or\nsomeone else\nsomething else\nit's a really powerful way for us to be\nable to transmute this energy\ninto something even more powerful\nand then obviously on a humanity level\nas\nas uh people of the earth i mean that's\nwho we really are\nwe're all connected that way\nwe are just one big you know group of\npeople who are getting through the next\nhundred years together and here we are\nyou know causing so much conflict and\ntension that's not necessary so in that\nmoment also\nyou know seek how we can potentially\nhelp people all around the world\nand how we can help each other and right\nnow\nthe thing that's really close to my\nheart\nis this conflict in ukraine i literally\ndidn't think it was gonna happen and\nthen i can only imagine how scary it was\nfor the people who woke up i actually\njust spoke to um somebody in my network\non facebook\nabout like what was really going on in\nukraine\nand\num this\nreally broke my heart you know this\nperson literally him and his family they\nwoke up to\nbombings uh like you know rockets just\nlanding in his city at five in the\nmorning and i know that this isn't the\nonly conflict that's happening in the\nworld but for some reason this is really\npulling in my heart\nit just feels so close to my heart for\nsome reason i can't believe it's\nhappening\nso um yeah i ended up having a\nconversation with this person\nabout\nwhat his experiences real time and it\nwas really eye-opening because we think\ni mean we think we see certain things on\nthe news or whatever and you know\nthere's all this talks about whether\nwhat how much of that is true or not or\nwhatever but like when you talk to an\nindividual who's actually going through\nthat\nreal time right now they're sitting in\nthe shelter sitting in fear and sitting\nin anxiety sitting wondering what is\nwrong with humanity\num you feel it too and not that you know\nthis is to bring anyone down but like\ni really promote this idea of oneness\nand that oneness isn't always going to\nbe light and love even though at the end\nof the you know at the end of the day it\nis like in the bigger picture but like\nsometimes it is just sitting with the\npain of\nwhat's really going on in the world\ntogether and that's also oneness\num and not that you guys have to sit in\nthe pain right now were you really here\nto elevate the consciousness elevate the\nfrequency here together there's actually\ni know um there's a lot of you guys who\nare questioning like what is a\nmeditation gonna do for the war were\nthere actually\num a specific\nresearch that's been done that when you\nknow enough people got together and they\ndid these kind of mindfulness exercises\nthey were actually able to\nshift into higher consciousness\nliterally decreasing the rate of crime\nby like 16\nand during you know times like this when\nthings are really really really intense\nit was actually shown that it could\num\nyou know it could have a huge huge\nsignificant impact\non you know these violent situations\naround the world so my intention today\nis for us to\nfirst of all feel that level of peace\nfeel that level of joy feel that level\nof\nharmony within ourselves and then really\nintentionally project that feeling out\ninto the world\nand sending love specifically to people\nin ukraine who's sitting there right now\npeople in any situation for whatever\nreason that they are feeling attacked or\nuh powerless let's send love to them\nas well as people of russia too i mean\nmost people from what i understand\nmost people in russia\nwho are\nyou know not a part of this they don't\nwant this either there's a ton of people\nin russia there's ton of people around\nthe world who want peace as much as\npeople in ukraine\num so this isn't about you know ukraine\nversus russia this is really about\npromoting peace\nand promoting um the love that we get to\ncreate in this world together so i just\nwant to make that super clear\ni'm just going to look at the chat real\nquick before we go into the meditation\npeople are above the government yeah\nyes i pray for all humanity as well\nfatima\num and you know someone wrote here which\ncountry made a mistake today this isn't\na discussion about that this is a\ndiscussion about how we can actually\nshift this energy of violence and\nterrorism or you know whatever you know\nis going on in the world not just in\nukraine to\nreally be able to bring this back to\npeace\nyeah\num i'm just looking at some of the chat\nhere\nso let's um\nso if you guys are here today\num go ahead and you know put in the chat\ni am here\nfor world peace i'm praying for world\npeace\ni make a stand for world peace\nlet's go ahead and put that in the chat\nlet's see how powerful it is for us to\ncome together\nand really intentionally like really\ndeclare

through\nyour nose\nfill up your lungs in three two one hold\nat the top and exhale\nlet's do a few more take a deep inhale\nand exhale\ntake another deep inhale\nand exhale everything out\nfor a moment here\ntake yourself to a time\nthat you felt complete\npeace and abundance in your life\nin your own life in your own body\nthink about a moment you felt\nso much love\nfor another person\nor you felt so loved by another person\n[Music]\nwhat did that feel like in your body\nwhat did that feel like in your heart\nwhat did that do to your breathing\nwhat did that feel like in your stomach\nto feel completely\nloved or have abundance of overflowing\ndeep\ndeep love for somebody\ntap into it and that energy tap into\nthat feeling where nothing\nmattered\nexcept for that love that you had for\nthat person or that thing the cause\nwhatever it is\nthis is the process of helping you\nremember what love really even feels\nlike\nto connect to that frequency to connect\nto\nthat feeling in our bodies\nwe can't pray for something that we\ndon't remember what it feels like so we\nget to feel that in this moment\nright now\nwhere were you when you felt so loved\nwhere were you when you just felt so\npeaceful in this love\nput yourself in that situation right now\nas if it's happening\nand allow yourself to feel this\ncompletely in your body\nnow with that loving intention and the\nfeeling in your body that feels so real\nto you in this moment because it is\nimagine that wherever you feel this love\nin your body\nthere's this bright light\nthat's radiating through\nyour body\nmaybe it is this giant ball a bright\nlight in your heart\nmaybe it's in your stomach\nmaybe it's in your head\nmaybe it's in your throat\nwherever you feel this love in your body\nenvision it with your eyes closed as if\nthere's bright light\nthat is hovering that's covering\nthat's centering you to that love\nwhere do you see that bright white light\nof pure unconditional love in your body\nwhere you feel this right now\nmaybe it's scattered throughout your\nentire body maybe it's in every one of\nyour cells maybe it's in your bones it's\nin your muscles it's in your hair\nwherever you see it just really really\nconnect to that white light within your\nbody where you feel this love\nonce you can envision it once you can\nfeel it when you can feel this energy of\nlove in your body as a white light\ngo ahead and rub your hands together as\nwe did before\nyou can keep your eyes closed here if\nyou'd like\nand go ahead\nand imagine with your eyes closed\nthat there's this bright white light\nbetween your hands\nand channel all the white light that you\nsaw and felt smelled whatever it is\nin your body\nthat pure white unconditional love\nenergy\nand imagine that you are\nchanneling that between your hands and\nyou can feel it you can see it it's this\nbright ball\nof light\nand stay here and breathe for a few\nminutes really getting connected to this\nbright white light between your palms\nyou might start to feel\nthis area between your\nhands between your palms get warm and\nhot\nas you really connect to this radiating\nlove energy\n[Music]\nand imagine that\nyou allow this bright white light energy\nto float\nand you're sending this pure white light\nenergy\nto\nthe people in this world\nwho forgot who they really are\nwho are acting out of fear\nwe're acting out a greed or ego\nand they ran out of this white light\nlove\ntake a moment to send this energy over\nto\nukraine\nany world leaders\nthat could use this love\nso that they can shift\n[Music]\ninto who they really are\nreminding them powerfully what they are\ncapable of\nwhen they really remember who they are\nsend this bright light energy\nto the people who are suffering\nwe're scared\nimagine that this light is floating into\nthe ether\ntraveling across the world\nand landing on the people who need this\nthe most\nimagine that they can receive it\nthey feel it\nmaybe it's the people who's hiding out\nin the shelters in ukraine\nmaybe it's the soldiers who get to have\na change of heart\nmaybe it's the leaders of the world\nwho are inspired to do something\nto\nbring more peace into this world send us\nlove\nto somebody\nspecific\n[Music]\nthat you can think of\nonce you've sent that over to the person\nimagine that person\nfeeling\nthat same energy that you felt in your\nown body for a moment\nor maybe for a day for an hour\nfor the rest of their life\nimagine them\nreceiving this energy and all the sudden\nthey start to feel\nthis peace\nmaybe they drop their weapons\nmaybe they change their plans\nfor any kind of further violence and\nthey decide to\nsurrender to love to surrender to peace\nwhat would that look like\nhow emotional would that feel for them\nin that moment when they decide\nto do something different\nso that they can align to world peace\nand love\n[Music]\nimagine somebody who's having that shift\nin their energy\nbecause you sent them love\nbecause you reminded them what's\npossible in this world\nhow that energy to move you as if it's\nhappening right now\ni envision a soldier who drops the\nweapon\ninstead of shooting somebody\nimagine world leaders\nsaying we can't let this happen anymore\nand calling\nthis\nconflict to an end\ni imagine people\nwho get to leave this shelter forever\nknowing\nthat even though\nthis whole violent situation happened\nthey're safe now they can rebuild now\nand they can feel the love from all\naround the world to start to rebuild\ntheir life and their country\nand they're so happy they're\nthey're\njust really\njoyful that this is over\nimagine these specific scenarios in your\nmind\nwhat would that look like what would\nthat feel like\n[Music]\nand once you can feel that energy shift\n[Music]\nallow that to inspire you allow that to\nmove you\nknowing that you did your part\nand creating this energy in this world\nand allow that\nto move\nyou oof i'm feeling so much warmth in my\nbody right now i don't know if you guys\ncan feel that\nand for those of you who's just joining\nthank you for being here\nwe are

and again continue\nto send messages of support and love for\npeople of ukraine and even people you\nknow all around the world it doesn't\nmatter where they are you know people in\nrussia who are for peace people in\nthe us who are for peace and we all want\nto help um and we feel helpless right\nnow so this is an opportunity for\nus to\ncreate that energy here and that create\nthat momentum create the ripple effect\nall right\nso these are some of the things that\ncame up for me you guys\ni allow these difficult times especially\nif you're an empath like i am um you\nguys probably felt a lot during the last\ncouple weeks couple days leading up to\nthis and hopefully you guys feel better\nnow and one of the things that i really\ntry to do is what can i learn from all\nthese different people who's showing up\nand rising above everything for example\nwhen i looked at people like people in\nukraine who are staying strong and who's\nreally stepping up to do something for\ntheir people and really fighting for\ntheir country\nit allowed me to think about like\nwhat is what is a cause that's so\npowerful that i would literally risk my\nlife for it's something that is like\nsuch a big thing in my heart that like\ni'm willing to like\ngo for it like i'm willing to let that\nfire of my soul just like lead me to\naction in that way\nand one of the things that came up for\nme was actually this to be able to step\nup\nin the space where i get to hold space\nfor you guys as well as hold space to\nyou know pray for the people who really\nneed it i mean this felt like a calling\nthat i could not ignore\nand that felt really really powerful\nso this is an opportunity for you guys\nto as you watch these you know news and\nfootages it can be really heartbreaking\nand that's okay that's normal right like\nwe're human and we're watching people um\nexperience this it's a heartbreaking\nthing and\nalso it's a great point for a moment of\nreflection of like what is something\nthat is so dear to my heart that i would\nfight for it\nand connect to that fire what is\nsomething that you're so passionate\nabout that you would do anything for it\nand if you can actually connect to that\nfire you're able to transmute that deep\nsadness into impact that's exactly what\ni did today you know i've been really\nemotional the last couple days like\ntalking to you know friends in ukraine\ntalking to\npeople about the situation watching the\nnews\nand then i just had to make a decision\ni'm like\nthis feeling is here for a reason this\nemotion is here for a reason what can i\ndo to transmute this energy of sadness\ninto impact and inspired action\nso think about that for you as well like\nwhat is something that you can do with\nthis\nanother thing that really really\ninspired me was actually\num\nwatching people in russia who are\nclearly for peace\nrise above\nand say this is not us\nlike we are here for peace we are here\nfor\nlove as much as anyone else\nright because this truly isn't about\ndifferent countries you guys this is\njust about\ntwo kinds of people people who are for\npeace and people who are not\nand we're here\nto really hold space\nand promote\nand rise with the people who are for\nworld peace\num\nhere is a link here\nthat was sent\nby somebody who's actually in ukraine\nright now so if you're feeling called to\nhelp feel free to check that out and you\nknow um do something that really feels\nlike\nsomething um that you want to help with\nthere's a bunch of different ways that\nyou can help\nso go ahead and take a look at that if\nyou'd like\nhere's the link here and i'm going to go\nahead and put this in the comments or\nanswer in the\num\ncaption as well\nand by the way you guys people who are\nthis is um\npeople who are showing up with any kind\nof violent messages\nyou will be\nnot a part of this\nlike i it's not even going gonna show up\nin this chat\num and you might potentially get blocked\nso please please\nlet's keep that intention really really\nstrong here\nand this is a place for peace and safety\nall right\nand then another way i wanted to really\ninvite you all to think about\nas we're moving through these difficult\ntimes and a lot of emotions are rising\nwhen i looked at\npeople of ukraine and what they're going\nthrough\nand then i looked at my own problems and\nthe things that i was stressing about it\nbecame truly irrelevant\nit brought me back to like what really\nmatters in this world like who are the\npeople that i would want to call today\nif there was a war that broke out in my\nown country\nand then i call them and this these are\nthe moments that we can actually\ntransmute this energy of fear and\nsadness into love\nwho are the people that i would think\ntoday right now or the people i would\nwant to sit with\nand then like what am i willing to be\ngrateful for that i totally take for\ngranted\nlike you know for a lot of us i'm sure\nnot everybody\nbut for a lot of us we have the luxury\nof safety most of us don't wake up\nthinking oh my gosh is my city going to\nbe bombed tomorrow\noh my gosh am i going to have water am i\ngonna have electricity am i gonna have\nyou know\npeople that i love around with tomorrow\nand like we forget that that alone is\nsuch a luxury\nyeah\nyeah\nso go ahead and connect to that\ngratitude and when i was able to connect\nto that gratitude\noh my gosh\nthis happened\ni was able to show up for you guys i was\nable to\ntransfer my energy of sadness and fear\ninto\nlove\nand do something with it do something\nproductive with it do something powerful\nwith it and then actually create this\nripple effect with hundreds thousands of\npeople\nto\ndo the same\nso\num\nfrom the people um of ukraine\ncan you guys hear me okay for the people\nfrom ukraine what they're telling me is\nthe first thing is we get to spread this\nawareness of what's really going on\nbecause a lot of people\num they may or may not know what's\nreally going on so do your own research\num\noh i'm sorry that it's cutting out i'm\ngonna go ahead and decrease the sound\nhere a little bit\ni hope you guys can hear me is that\nbetter okay\nokay\nawesome all right so i'm creating that\nawareness as well as\nstaying grounded\nstaying in a place of love for yourself\nas well as um\nbeing active proactive about
