    "transcript": "- [Presenter] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nSo you have a crush\nand you're pretty sure\nthey don't know you exist,\nor at least that you like,\nlike them or, well, yeah,\nthey probably don't know\nwho you are for now.\n(cackling laughter)\nHold the cackling laughter.\nNo, I'm not plotting a diabolical\nplan for world domination.\nI'm simply gonna give you some tips\nthat will get your\ncrush to know your name.\nHere are six sure-fire ways\nto get your crush to notice you.\nNumber one, don't be\nafraid to meet their gaze.\nWho doesn't love looking\nblissfully into the eyes\nof the dreamiest person in the room?\nDo you enjoy taking quick\nglances at your crush?\nWell, what if these were\nan exchange of glances?\nOften, a lot of people will turn away\nwhen their crush notices\nthem staring at them.\nBut instead of letting\nthat fear engulf you enough\nto divert your eyeballs\nas far away as possible,\nhold them there just a second longer.\nAh, good old eye contact,\ndifficult at times,\nbut very helpful in getting\nsomeone to notice you.\nYou don't need to stare your\ncrush straight in the eyes\nfor like 30 seconds,\nbut simply give them a look\nand a sweet smile once they notice you.\nDon't shy away from the inevitable.\nYeah, you were noticing them.\nNow let them notice you.\nThey'll not only be flattered,\nbut they'll think about you a bit longer\nthan if you had turned away quickly\nas if you looked their way by accident.\nNumber two, take some baby steps.\nIt can seem a bit intimidating\napproaching your crush.\nYou might think that you\nneed a huge list of topics\nto discuss in your first\nencounters with them,\nbut try taking some baby steps\nand paying them a compliment,\ncracking a witty joke, or\nasking how they're doing.\nMaybe ask a question about\nsomething they're working on,\nor their outfit, or something\ninteresting they said.\nAnother classic,\ngood old communication\nwill surely get someone\nto notice you.\nStart the engagement with them,\nso then if they like you back,\nthey won't feel as\nintimidated as you were before\nto talk to you again.\nNumber three, show them\nyour talents and skills.\nDo you have a passion you're pursuing,\na skill that you've\nmastered, a natural talent?\nWell, if your crush is around\nand you have an opportunity to show off\na bit of your personality,\ntalent, and skills, why not?\nYour crush may just be impressed\nby your creative sketches\nor your fluency in French.\nMaybe you're a stand up\ncomedian in the making\nand write your own jokes,\nshare one or two and see\nif the laughter follows,\nor embrace the awkward silence.\nConfidence, my friend, confidence.\nNumber four, show off who you really are\nin actions and style.\nOkay, so you've given them a sample\nof your talents and skills,\nbut you can also show how kind, caring,\nand gracious you are through your actions.\nOffer to help them with the\ntask the teacher assigned.\nAsk them how their day was.\nShare some of your knowledge\nto help them with a\nproject they're working on.\nAnd there are other\nways you can show a bit\nof your personality as\nwell, through your style.\nDon't be afraid to dress\nto impress, yourself.\nStaying true to yourself\nand your fashion sense\nwill only attract more people\nwho are actually attracted to you,\nnot someone you're trying to be\nthrough someone else's style.\nNumber five, use open body\nlanguage to seem approachable.\nSo maybe you've said a\nfew words to your crush,\nmaybe you haven't,\nbut one way to catch\nsomeone's full attention\nonce they already see you\nis to appear approachable.\nYou can't just be interesting\nand stylish, and that's that.\nYou need to look\napproachable and friendly,\notherwise they might shy away\nfrom saying hello to you.\nSo how do you do this?\nTry displaying open body language\nby keeping an upright posture,\nnot crossing your arms,\nand keeping your head up and looking out.\nWe may appear closed off\nand not interested in\nwhat's going on around us\nif we have our arms crossed\nand are looking down.\nWhen you can, keep that posture upright,\nthat gaze out to the world,\nand let your pearly whites show.\nAnd number six,\nshow them you care and get to know them.\nSo maybe you've shown you're\npretty kind to others,\nsome interesting skills,\nand a talent or two,\nbut now you can show\nthem you care about them.\nGet to know your crush a\nbit by asking about them,\ntheir hobbies, interests, passions.\nIf you have something in common,\ngo with it and keep\nthe conversation going.\nGrow it towards more\nthan a shared interest,\nbut a discussion about why you both love\nwhat it is you're passionate about.\nWhat about it makes it\nyour one and only passion?\nThey'll likely share what drew them\nto their passions initially too,\nor why they got into their career,\nor what's going on lately in their life.\nThe point is to show them that you care\nby actively listening\nand expressing your genuine\ninterest when possible.\nNext time you see them, mention\nyour previous conversation,\nask about something they\nwere worried about last time,\nshow you care.\nIf you show you've been\nthinking about them a bit,\nthey'll sense your authenticity\nand may just like you a bit\nmore in the process too.\nIf all else fails,\nanother one of your classic\nstand up self-written jokes\ncould work too.\nWhy did the Psych2Goer\ncross the road anyways?\nTo get to the other side?\nNo, that's the chicken.\nThis one will need some work.\nMaybe save the jokes for later,\nafter they notice you some more.\nSo do you think your\ncrush will notice you?\nWhich talent or skill will you show them?\nHow will you show that you care,\nand why did the Psych2Goer cross the road?\nDoes anyone know?\nLet us know in the comments\nsection down below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this\nvideo, and if you did,\ndon't forget to click the
