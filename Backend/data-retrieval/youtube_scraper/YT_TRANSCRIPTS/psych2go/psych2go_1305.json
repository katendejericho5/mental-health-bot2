    "transcript": "- [Presenter] Hey, have you ever thought\na certain song sounded orange?\nDo you feel like you can see music?\nIf so, you may have synesthesia,\na neurological condition that scientists\nare still trying to learn more about.\nThe word means to blend the five senses.\nPeople with synesthesia,\nknown as synesthetes,\nexperience the world differently,\nwhere their senses are\nhooked up to each other\nin ways where one sensory\nsource produces another result,\nsuch as tasting sounds or hearing colors.\nWith that said,\nhere are six interesting\nthings about synesthesia.\nNumber one, most are born with it,\nand it runs in families.\nAccording to Decoby\nBancroft on ranker.com,\nresearchers think everyone\nis born with synesthesia,\nbut grows out of it in time,\nwith some developing it later on in life.\nBoth of these are called\ndevelopmental synesthesia.\nThere are some cases\nwhere people suddenly gain these abilities\ndue to medical issues\nlike strokes, tumors,\nor brain injury, known\nas acquired synesthesia.\nThe condition can also be inherited\nwith around 40% of synesthetes having\nanother close family member with it.\nScientists have even\ndiscovered a specific gene\non chromosome 16 that causes\ngrapheme-color synesthesia.\nThough they have yet to figure out why.\nNumber two, left-handed people and women\nare more likely to have it.\nDid you know that there\nare certain members\nof the population more likely\nto have synesthesia than others?\nAgain, scientists don't know why,\nbut studies in the U.S. have shown\nthat women are three times\nmore likely to have synesthesia,\nwhile in the UK,\neight times more likely to have it.\nAnd strangely enough, more synesthetes\nare left-handed compared to the rest.\nNumber three, when sick,\ntheir abilities can change.\nWhen a synesthete comes down with a cold,\nflu or something like an ear infection,\nit can affect how they\nexperience their condition,\neither strengthening or weakening it,\nor making them feel out\nof whack and not right.\nFor example, a sound color synesthete\nwith a blocked ear may not\nonly lose their hearing,\nbut the colors they usually\nexperience may be different.\nSimilarly, if you have synesthesia\nand are diagnosed with depression,\nyou might find that it\ntemporarily leaves altogether.\nNumber four, there are over\n80 different kinds of it.\nYour senses can be linked to each other\nand with other things like personality\nin a large combination of ways.\nWhile most people with the condition\nonly have two senses like\nsight and sound linked,\nsome can have three or\nmore linked together.\nAccording to better help,\nthere's been at least one case\nwhere someone had\nconnections between all five.\nIn general, there are two\nmajor groups of synesthetes,\nprojective and associative.\nThe first one is when\nyou hear, smell, taste,\nor feel the second sense,\nlike tasting blueberries when you hear\na specific piano note.\nAssociative means that\nyou can connect a stimulus\nwith a sense in your mind,\nbut not experience it.\nInstead of tasting blueberries,\nthe piano note will only\nremind you of blueberries.\nNumber five, you can teach\nyourself synesthesia,\nthere are many benefits to synesthesia,\nsuch as boosting your\nmemory and creativity.\nAccording to psychology\nprofessor, Berit Brogaard\nwho has the condition herself,\nyou can teach yourself\nsome tricks to learn it,\nsuch as by associating two\ndifferent things together.\nIt takes practice and patience,\nbut once you start associating\ntwo things together,\nyou can build new neural\npathways in the brain.\nWe remember colors more\neasily than other things,\nso it may be helpful to associate a color\nwith something to remember it.\nYou can also use meditation\nor the practice of mindfulness to help.\nSince mindfulness is about shifting\nyour attention to your senses,\nlearning to become aware of your senses\nmay help you to better\nperceive synesthesia.\nAnd number six, ideasthesia\nvs. synesthesia.\nIdeasthesia is an offshoot of synesthesia,\nwhile synesthesia is\nwhen a sensory experience\nis associated with another sense,\nlike seeing colors when\nyou listen to music,\nideasthesia is when a concept\nlike a letter or a number,\nwhich aren't real things\nbut abstract concepts,\ntrigger a sensory experience.\nLike seeing a certain color.\nConcepts can also trigger other concepts,\nlike a letter or a number\ncan have a gender or a personality.\nThey aren't senses, but they are ideas.\nDo you think you have synesthesia?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video\nhelpful or interesting,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video with those\nwho might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon to get notified\nwhenever Psych2Go posts a new video.\nAs always, the references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThanks for watching and\nwe'll see you in the next video."
