Psych2Go's\nmission to make psychology\nand mental health more\naccessible to everyone.\nThanks again.\nNow, back to the video.\nDo you like romcoms, K-dramas,\nand teen romance novels?\nThe media we consume sets a high standard\nfor our dating life,\nand it can be easy to feel\ndisappointed or discouraged\nif you feel that you aren't achieving\nthose high standards in romance.\nIn reality, relationships aren't perfect.\nThey're frustrating at\ntimes and require work,\neffort, and patience, and\nunderstanding from both sides.\nAnd there are many common\nmindsets, behaviors,\nand habits of truly healthy relationships\nthat the movies simply don't show.\nSo whether you're wanting to improve\nyour current relationship,\nor are single and wanting to know\nhow healthy relationships work,\nhere are nine signs of a\nsuccessful relationship.\nNumber one, you're committed\nto giving your time,\nenergy, and care to your partner.\nThe word commitment might have\nyou thinking of wedding bells\nor meeting the parents.\nDon't let that scare you off.\nTo put it simply,\nevery long lasting relationship starts\nwith a basic commitment to\ngive your partner your time,\nenergy, and care.\nYou want your partner\nto care deeply about you\nand spend their time and energy on you,\nso you do the same for them.\nNumber two, you recognize\nthe importance of self-care.\nHow much do you value self-care?\nAre you aware of what\nyour emotional needs are?\nLearning about your own emotional needs\nmakes you better able to\ndetermine how to balance them\nwith another person's needs.\nIt will also help you recognize\nwhen you need some time\nto prioritize and take care of yourself.\nNumber three,\nyou have a sense of purpose\nseparate from your relationship.\nDo you have your own goals, hobbies,\nand interests outside\nof your relationship?\nThis makes you a more balanced\nand well-rounded person.\nIt also keeps you from fixating\nand obsessing over your partner,\nand your relationship too much,\nwhich can be a problem\nfor new relationships.\nBy having that sense of purpose\noutside of your partner,\nyou keep those toxic traits at bay\nand lead a more successful relationship,\nand fulfilling life as well.\nNumber four, you and your\npartner are vulnerable\nand transparent with each other.\nWhen you're open and\nvulnerable with your partner,\nit helps build your emotional connection\nand understanding of each other.\nIf being vulnerable is hard for you,\nyou go slow and build a\ntrust in your partner first\nuntil you're ready to\nbe more open with them.\nAfter all, in a successful relationship,\nboth partners are open and\nhonest with their feelings\nto foster compassion,\ncomfort, and intimacy.\nNumber five, you share\nresponsibility in your relationship.\nDo you strive for a proper balance\nbetween the two of you\nwhen making compromises?\nDo you and your partner\ntake responsibility\nfor your actions?\nWhen things go wrong,\nit can be easy to blame other factors,\nsuch as the weather, or\ncircumstances, or another person,\nand you can get wrapped\nup in the blame game.\nIt can be hard to admit when\nyou are the one at fault.\nHowever, you know that\nlearning and practicing\nhow to manage your\ndifferences is a key part\nof your relationship that both\nof you are responsible for.\nYou're aware that trying\nto make something one person's\nfault will only frustrate\nand upset both of you\nwithout solving anything.\nSo by admitting shared\nfault and responsibility\nand focusing on improvement,\ntwo people meet in the middle\nand it saves you both half the trip.\nAfter all, as iconic as Ross',\n\"We were on a break,\"\nline from \"Friends\" is,\nhaving a heated debate\nabout who's at fault\nwill ultimately solve nothing.\nNumber six, you have\nequality with your partner.\nDo you and your partner\nrespect each other?\nDoes it feel like both\nof your voices are heard\nand that there's an equal power dynamic?\nBoth of you treat each other\nwith patience, empathy,\nsupport, generosity, and forgiveness?\nIn a successful relationship,\none's needs do not\ndominate over the other.\nFor example, you don't have\nto completely change yourself\njust to be with someone.\nAnd if someone expects you to,\nthey're clearly not right for you.\nFinding someone who treats you as an equal\nin your relationship is\nexactly what you deserve.\nNumber seven, you actively\nlisten to each other\nwithout interrupting,\njudging, or correcting.\nWhen you get into an argument,\ndo you and your partner listen\nto what the other person is\nsaying and respond kindly,\nor do both of you interrupt each other\nand only focus on trying\nto get your point across?\nInterrupting them makes\nit difficult for them\nto fully express their thoughts.\nWhen you do this, it makes it\nseem like you're just waiting\nfor them to stop talking\nso you can speak your mind.\nYou aren't truly listening and\nconsidering their viewpoint,\nwhich will only make you\nboth more frustrated,\nand the situation will escalate.\nWhen you're in a successful relationship,\nyou listen to your partner fully\nbefore responding or judging prematurely,\njust like how you'd\nwant them to treat you.\nNumber eight,\nyou both are willing to seek\noutside help when needed.\nWhile you and your partner\nmay be a dynamic duo,\nthere come a point in your relationship\nwhere you two need outside\nhelp, and that's okay.\nDespite this stigma\nsurrounding couples therapy\nis something shameful,\nor a sign that you're not able\nto make your relationship work,\nneeding outside help\nis a very normal thing.\nSeeking outside help means\nyou're both committed\nand willing to try everything\nto work things out,\nand that's a good sign of dedication.\nAnd number nine, you have\nan easy sense of humor,\nplayfulness, and fun between each other.\nDo you two have a list of inside jokes?\nDo you have a similar sense of humor?\nA relationship shouldn't\nalways feel like a task\non your never ending to-do list.\nMaking each other laugh and having fun\nare some of the best parts of being\nin a successful relationship,\nit's something you genuinely\nenjoy being a part of.\nSo did you recognize any of these signs\nin your romantic relationship,\nor if you're single,\ndo you think knowing about these signs\nwill help you in your next relationship?\nLeave a comment down\nbelow with your thoughts.\nPlease like and share this\nvideo if it helped you\nand you think it could\nhelp someone else too.\nDon't forget to hit the
