    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nHave you ever heard of the\nMyers-Briggs Type Indicator?\nDo you know what the\nINFJ personality type is?\nINFJ is the rarest of the\nMyers-Briggs personalities\nand stands for introverted,\nintuitive, feeling, and judging.\nAmongst their other features,\nINFJs are mostly known\nfor their introverted behavior\nand their idealistic\napproach towards life.\nAnd while these rare behavioral traits\ncan make them very valuable for society,\nlike everyone else, it can also\nput them at a disadvantage,\nespecially for their romantic life.\nSo here are seven reasons why, as an INFJ,\nyou may still be single.\nNumber one, you won't settle for anyone\nother than your dream person.\nWould you end your\nrelationship with your partner\nbecause they're not the\nperson you've envisioned?\nAs an INFJ, you're always\nstriving to find someone\nwho can connect with you\nmentally, emotionally,\nand even spiritually, to\na very intimate degree.\nYou're always looking for\nsomeone who truly understands you\nand who you can share\nyour inner world with.\nBut the problem comes\nwhen you won't settle\nfor anyone less than\nwhat you have in mind.\nAt the same time, the\nselectiveness that you have\nwhen forming relationships\npresents itself as a barrier\nfor people who are interested\nand who genuinely want to know you better.\nHey, Psych2Goers, do you struggle\nto build deeper connections with others?\nAre you looking for ways to connect\nwith people beyond the surface level?\nToday's video is sponsored by So Syncd,\na place where we can match\npartners by personality types\nbased on the 16 personalities model.\nYou can access it by clicking the link\nin the description below.\nTwo, you stress over small things.\nAre you someone who always\nneeds things to be perfect?\nWanting everything to\nbe perfect can lead you\nto constantly stressing\nover the small things.\nAs an INFJ, you develop deeper\nideas than the usual person.\nAnd although this is an\nincredible skill to have,\nit can also make you read\ntoo much into things.\nIf you're constantly stressing\nover insignificant things\nthat you fail to look\nat the bigger picture,\nthen it could be a reason\nwhy you might find yourself still single.\nNumber three, you wait for\nothers to make the first move.\nDo you feel bad for\ninitiating conversation\nbecause you think you'd\nbecome a burden for them?\nThis is a common thought that INFJs have.\nWhether it's for them to text you first\nor to take you on a date,\nas an introverted person, you usually wait\nfor them to make the first move.\nWhile it may be that you're afraid\nto be bothersome for them,\nthis habit of waiting for\nothers to approach you\ncan also result in a lot\nof missed opportunities.\nWe talked about the importance\nof your potential partner being attentive\nand remembering the little things,\nwhich is why So Syncd could\nbe the right app for you.\nThey pair couples who\nhave the right amount\nof similarities to get each\nother and just the right amount\nof differences to create that spark\nand go for deeper, meaningful dating.\nUpon taking the personality test,\nyou discover your personality,\nsuch as INFJ, so thoughtful,\nor ENFP, so curious.\nOnce you've mutually liked each other,\nyou can start messaging.\nWe wanted to say a massive congratulations\nto Hannah and Brendan, who\ngot married in December\nafter meeting on So Syncd, the dating app\nthat matches compatible personality types.\nHannah is a Psych2Goer\nwho discovered So Syncd\nthrough one of our videos.\nShe downloaded the app, found Brendan,\nand deleted the app\nwithin a matter of hours.\nHannah is an ENFP and Brendan is an INTJ.\nThey would be a perfect\npersonality match on So Syncd.\nDownload the app for free today\nto meet that special someone\non your wavelength.\nMake sure to check out the app\nin the description box\nbelow for more details.\nWe encourage you to try it\nand give yourself a chance\nto find deeper love.\nNumber four, you can be very stubborn.\nHow strongly do you defend your values?\nOne of your main personality\ntraits as an INFJ\nis that you tend to stick\nvery closely to your values,\nbeliefs, and ideas.\nBecause of this, you might\ngive off the impression\nthat you're not willing\nto change your opinion,\neven when proven wrong.\nThis can be a very important factor\nfor potential romantic partners,\nas they may be put off\nby your stubbornness.\nNumber five, you see past fake acts.\nHave you ever gotten into a fight\nwith someone because you\nfound them faking something?\nAlthough people may tell you\nthat you're just assuming\nthings, as an INFJ,\nyou do have the ability\nto see past the surface\nand notice things that other people don't.\nUnlike others, you are very observant\nand will look out for things\nlike people's body language,\nvoice tone, and facial expressions.\nAnd being able to see past fake acts\ncan disqualify more people\nthan you might think\nwhen considering who you want\nto form a romantic relationship with.\nNumber six, you don't do casual.\nDo you commit to relationships very fast\nbecause you don't want\nit to be a waste of time?\nIf yes, then this may be\nwhy you're still single.\nOne of your personality\ntraits is that you don't like\nwasting time and effort on things\nthat are not going to work out.\nThis is also why you're so selective\nabout who you form relationships with.\nHowever, when looking at\nromantic relationships,\nthis trait may scare people off\nas most people usually\nprefer to start casually\nand not commit to too much, too soon.\nAnd number seven, dating\nis a pain for you.\nDo you have a positive\nor a negative impression\nof the dating experience?\nAlthough a lot of people\nfind dating as bothersome,\nINFJs can feel overwhelmed by it.\nAs an INFJ, one of your inferior functions\nis extroverted sensing.\nThis means that you\ndon't like it when a lot\nof sensory information\nis being thrown your way.\nSo putting yourself out\nthere and meeting new people\ncan become overwhelming and exhaustive.\nAs a result, you might find\nyourself avoiding dates\naltogether, which may be\nwhy you're still single.\nDo you recognize any of\nthese signs in yourself?\nLet us know in the
