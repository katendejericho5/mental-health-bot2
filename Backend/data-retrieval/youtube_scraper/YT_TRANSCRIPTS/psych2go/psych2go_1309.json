    "transcript": "- Do you often get confused\nbetween BPD and CPTSD?\nBorderline personality disorder, or BPD,\nand complex post-traumatic\nstress disorder, CPTSD,\nare two disorders that have\nmany striking similarities.\nBecause of the similarities,\npeople with either disorder\nare often misdiagnosed\nwhich can be problematic\ngiven that the two disorders\nare treated very differently.\nSo to help you better understand\nthe differences between the two,\nhere are some of the signs\nyou can look out for.\nWhat is BPD?\nBorderline personality disorder\nis a Cluster B personality disorder\ncharacterized by unstable moods,\nrelationships, and self-identity.\nIn many cases,\nthis disorder develops\nout of traumatic events,\nusually occurred in childhood,\nbut can be developed genetically as well.\nPeople with BPD may also experience\na fear of abandonment and rejection,\nself-harm and suicidal behaviors,\nintense and rapid mood\nswings, impulsivity,\ndifficulties with knowing who they are,\nand changing interests\nbased on who they're with.\nWhat is CPTSD?\nCompared to this, complex\npost-traumatic stress disorder\nis a type of PTSD.\nCPTSD is characterized by\nrepeated traumatic events\nhappening over a long period of time,\nwhereas PTSD is usually a\nsingle incident, or incidents,\nthat happen in a\nrelatively short time span.\nPeople with this disorder\nmay have difficulties trusting others,\ndifficulties regulating emotions,\nbeing on constant high alert,\nhaving flashbacks and\nnightmares to traumatic events.\nSo in what ways are they similar?\nBPD and CPTSD have many\noverlaps with one another.\nBoth tend to have difficulties\nregulating emotions\nand can have unstable relationships.\nThey are also characterized\nby mood swings,\na fear of abandonment, disassociation,\nand negative perceptions of self.\nHowever, here are some of the\nways that they are different.\nNumber one, BPD has an\ninconsistent self-concept.\nOne of the big overlaps\nbetween the two disorders\nis the tendency to have a\nnegative perception of self.\nThe difference lies in\nthe fact that with BPD\nthis self-concept can change dramatically\nin a short period of time.\nIt's possible for people\nto go from feeling broken\nand worthless to having an\nexaggerated sense of self-worth.\nIn comparison, the self-identity\nin those with CPTSD\nremains the same, though\nit's consistently negative,\nbroken, or worthless.\nNumber two, people with CPTSD\nusually do not have the\nsame fear of abandonment.\nFear of abandonment is often\npresent in either condition,\nbut it manifests\ndifferently between the two.\nWith BPD, this fear of abandonment\ncan lead to frantic efforts to avoid it.\nThey may threaten others,\nblock them from leaving,\nor even cut them out of\ntheir life altogether.\nCompared to this, people with CPTSD\nwill struggle more with\ntrust and avoiding others.\nNumber three, people with CPTSD\nare less likely to self-harm.\nPeople with BPD have\nan increased incidence\nof self-harming and impulsive behaviors\nthat are not typically\nseen in the same way\nas those with CPTSD.\nWhile suicide and self-harm\ncan happen to those with CPTSD,\nthose with BPD may be more\nimpulsive in their actions.\nBPD is also much more\nassociated with suicidal actions\nthan those with CPTSD.\nAnd number four, with CPTSD,\nyou are more likely to\navoid relationships.\nPeople with CPTSD are more\nlikely to avoid relationships\nand push people away\nas a defense mechanism\nthan those with BPD.\nSince people with BPD\nhave a higher tendency\nto fear being alone,\nthey'll try to find more opportunities\nto be with other people.\nWhile people with either\ndisorder may push others away,\nthose with BPD often do so\nto avoid abandonment or rejection,\nwhereas those with CPTSD will do so\nbecause they feel threatened.\nWhile the two disorders\nhave many similarities,\nthey require very different treatments\nand have different\ncauses and complications.\nDid you find this video helpful?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nAlso, be sure to like,\nsubscribe, and share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThanks for watching and\nsee you in our next video."
