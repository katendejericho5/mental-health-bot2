    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nHave you ever stopped to think\nabout how smart you really are?\nDo you wonder how you\ndetermine intelligence\nor what it means to be smart?\nOverall intelligence is the combination\nof intrapersonal intelligence,\nthe understanding of one's self.\nInterpersonal intelligence,\nthe ability to understand\nand interact well with others.\nLinguistic intelligence,\nthe ability to use,\nunderstand and communicate\nin one or more languages.\nLogical intelligence,\nintellect involving problem solving\nand critical thinking skills.\nEmotional intelligence,\nyour ability to process yours\nand others emotion, and more.\nSo let's look at six signs\nthat show how smart you truly are.\nNumber one, you have a\nstrong sense of self-aware.\nA key indicator of overall intelligence\nis having strong self-awareness.\nAccording to Healthline,\na well developed sense of self\ntypically means you feel secure\nin who you are,\nknow where your skills lie,\nand have the confidence to make choices\nthat reflect your beliefs.\nWhile it can take some time\nto establish your identity\nand make it through the journey\nof self discovery,\nfully under standing your capabilities,\nlife values, desires, dreams, goals\nand other defining characteristics\ncan lead you to sustainable\nself confidence and fulfillment.\nAs Aristotle once famously said,\n\"Knowing yourself is the\nbeginning of all wisdom.\"\nNumber two, you are a keen observer.\nDo you enjoy watching\nthe world around you?\nDo you like to listen\ninto what people say\nor notice unique pieces\nof writing in certain places?\nDistinct observation\nand remembrance skills\ncan signify various categories\nand types of intelligence.\nA study titled \"The Relationship Between\n\"Fluid Intelligence and\nWorking Memory Capacity\"\npublished on Pub Med Central\nunder the US National Library of Medicine\nand National Institutes of Health\nsuggests that a good eye for patterns\nindicates elements\nof spatial-visual intelligence\nand having a great memory\nof things you've heard somewhere\nis your verbal-linguistic intelligence\nshining through.\nNumber three, you are a natural empath.\nAre you always able to pick up\non when someone is feeling down\nwithout them even mentioning it?\nCan you absorb others' feelings\nand relate to, or almost experience,\ntheir emotions in real time?\nThese are strong signs of\nemotional intelligence.\nYou see, intelligence goes beyond\nyour quantitative understanding.\nA factor that can influence\nyour overall intelligence\nis the ability to empathize\nand process other people's\nemotions and feelings,\nand to use your available\nmental and physical resources\nto support them.\nSo if you have the natural knack\nto make your friends and loved ones\nfeel supported, needed,\ncared for and strong,\nyou definitely carry distinct\ntraits of intelligence.\nNumber four, you're good\nat managing your emotions.\nA sign of intelligence\nis not only being able\nto support others through their emotions,\nbut also about knowing how to best process\nand manage your own.\nLife has its ups and downs.\nAnd with these come real\ntime feelings and reactions\ntowards the many things you go through.\nAnd being able to handle a wide range\nof emotions with maturity\ncan say a lot about\nyour emotional wellbeing\nand how smart you truly are.\nAccording to Healthline,\npeople with high intelligence\nhave the ability to\nrecognize complex emotions,\nunderstand how those emotions\naffect choice and behavior,\nrespond to those emotions productively,\nexercise self-control to express feelings\nat appropriate times,\nand express feelings\nin safe and healthy ways.\nSo if you're good at\ndealing with your emotions,\nwhether they're unwanted\ngood, bad, or ugly,\nhave the patience to analyze your feelings\nand communicate them in a clear way\nat the right time and place,\nthen you can definitely consider yourself\nto be an intelligent person.\nNumber five, you're constantly curious.\nAre you always asking questions?\nSmart people often like\nto chase after answers\nto feed their never ending curiosity.\nThey love to learn,\nexplore, discover new things\nand to keep striving to grow.\nAccording to a study conducted\nby the Goldsmith's University of London,\nthe way that people invest\ntheir time and effort\ninto their intellect\ncan be a significant factor\nin cognitive growth.\nIf you genuinely enjoy opening your mind\nto different ideas and concepts,\nand believe that you have high curiosity\nand a willingness to accept ambiguity,\nyou can most certainly consider yourself\nto be a clever person.\nAs author and keynote speaker,\nScott Mautz puts in his article\nabout signs of intelligence with Inc.,\n\"It's not just learning more\n\"that makes you smarter.\n\"It's wanting to learn more.\"\nNumber six, you don't think\nyou are particularly intelligent.\nEver notice how people\nwho lack expertise or understanding\nare often overconfident,\nwhile those who are genuinely smart\ntend to question and doubt themselves?\nThis phenomenon of one's ignorance\ntowards their own ignorance\nis known as the Dunning-Kruger effect.\nIn comparison, it is quite common\nfor intelligent people\nto overlook their strengths\nand have more sensitive awareness\nof their weaknesses,\nlimitations, and drawbacks.\nThis is because they tend\nto push themselves\nto constantly get better\nin terms of knowledge,\nexpertise, or confidence.\nIf you tend to doubt\nyour intelligence often,\njust know that this comes\nfrom your unique trait of introspection\nand the drive for consistent improvement,\nrather than a genuine lack of ability.\nYour instinct to be able\nto reflect on yourself\nfrom an outside perspective\nis itself a praiseworthy attribute\nthat can help you get far in life.\nAre you smarter than you thought you were?\nLet us know in the comments
