    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, there's Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to the channel.\nDid you know that it takes\nabout 21 days to form a habit?\nWow, imagine how many habits\nyou might have picked up over the years.\nSome of those habits might\nbe healthy and life-changing,\nbut there might be a few\nhabits that are toxic\nand not as good for you\nor the surrounding people.\nIn today's video,\nlet's find out about\nhabits that might be toxic.\nSo with that said,\nhere are five toxic\nhabits to avoid in life.\nNumber one, gossiping.\nIf you know, you know.\nDishing or tattling,\ncall it what you want,\ngossip is idle talk or rumor,\nespecially about the personal\nor private affairs of others.\nMany may have participated in gossiping\nin some way or the other.\nAlthough it is impossible\nto never have negative thoughts\nabout something or someone,\nyou can control what you\ndo with these thoughts.\nA good alternative to\nsaying it out loud might be\nto write down all your thoughts\nin a notebook or on your phone\nor tapping into your voice recorder\nand speaking your mind out.\nA word of caution though,\ndon't let it fall into prying hands.\nNumber two, not forgiving yourself.\nUgh, everyone makes mistakes\nat some stage of life or another, period,\nbut to find happiness, you\nmust be able to let go.\nThe consequences of those\nmistakes do not define you.\nMistake being the main word here.\nForgive yourself and learn\nto walk through the pain\nof your past mistakes.\nHanging on to these harmful\nfeelings indefinitely\nnegatively impacts your mental health.\nOnly one thing is certain,\nthey leave behind lessons.\nIt's important to learn to\nlaugh when things go wrong\nbecause sometimes they will.\nSelf-forgiveness is the\nintentional preservation\nof inner peace and a reflection\nof a healthy self-concept.\nWhen you acknowledge your\nfaults, affirm your emotions,\ntake responsibility,\ndiscover your inspiration,\nconsider the lessons you've\nlearned, set clear boundaries,\ntreat yourself with love,\ncompassion, and gratitude,\nand make amends as needed,\nyou're being human.\nNumber three, blaming.\nIt's easy to blame your\nactions on someone else,\nbut is that the right way to go?\nEveryone likes to indulge\nin a good challenge every now and then,\nso why not challenge yourself\nto own up to what you\nmight have said or done?\nThe next time you find\nyourself in a situation\nwhere you wanna blame your\ndoings on someone else,\ntake a step back.\nAnalyze why you wanna blame someone else,\nrecognize why it's easier to do so,\nand then think of a way\nto own up to your doings.\nNumber four, trying to please everyone.\nDo you often find yourself doing something\njust to make someone else happy?\nSure, doing something\njust to make someone happy\nis admirable and important at times\nbut not at the cost of yourself.\nMost of the time, the issue\nis your inability to say no.\nIf you can't say no to the wrong things,\nyou won't be able to say\nyes to the ventures, people,\nand opportunities that excite you.\nSaying yes to others often\nmean saying no to yourself.\nIt's important to recognize your worth.\nRemind yourself of your goals\nand the steps necessary to achieve them.\nThe first step, however,\nis to figure out what you want to achieve.\nYou must be conscious\nof your life's mission,\nambitions, and objectives\nin order to ensure nothing\ndeters you from your own path.\nNumber five, drinking and/or smoking.\nHow often do you drink or smoke?\nWhile the long term effects\nof combining alcohol\nand tobacco are still being investigated,\npreliminary research indicates\nthat mixing the two\nsubstances can have severe\nand long-term health consequences.\nThis may be because the\nalcohol dissolves the chemicals\nin your cigarette when\nit is still in the mouth.\nCarcinogens can get trapped\nagainst the sensitive\ntissues of the throat\nas a result of this, increasing\nthe risk of fatal diseases.\nAnd there is no count\nof the amount of damage\nit has on one's daily functioning.\nExercise, meditation, or a\nhealthy diet are just some ways\nto help beat stress in a healthier way.\nBreaking out of habits\nis a behemoth of a task.\nYou can't break free in a day.\nIt would require constant\nconscious effort.\nBaby steps in the right\ndirection help you further along\ntowards your goal.\nYou may encounter frustration\nat the lack of results,\nbut that is no excuse to give up.\nYou are making the effort.\nAs they say, \"Well begun is half done.\"\nDo you have any of these habits?\nIf so, do you think this video\nhelped you recognize them?\nFeel free to leave a comment down below\nwith your thoughts,\nexperiences, or suggestions.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like button\nand share it with those out there using\nor being subjected to these habits.\nDon't forget to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more new videos.\nAnd as always, thanks for watching."
