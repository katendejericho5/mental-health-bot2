    "transcript": "- [Narrator] You're in a\nrelationship? Congrats!\nOr maybe you wanna be in one? We get it.\nHaving a partner in crime is great.\nYou know what else is\ngreat about relationships?\nHaving someone to be there for you,\nsomeone to lean on, someone to depend on.\nThis dependency can take different forms,\nfrom a phase in the forming\nup of a relationship,\nto an equal give and take.\nAnd sometimes it blasts\nright by the tipping point,\nand goes straight to Toxicville.\nWe know you wanna stay\nout of the red zone.\nSo let's look at some\ndifferent kinds of love,\nor should I say dependencies,\nto help you map out where you wanna go,\nand what you want to avoid or get out of.\nNumber one, dependency.\nThink of someone you know.\nIf you ask them, \"Who are you?\"\nWhat would they say?\nIf their life in terms of decision-making\ncan be described as,\nask someone where to go and what to do,\nand they're constantly\nclinging to others to lead,\nthey might be a dependent person\nthat creates dependent relationships.\nHaving a dependent relationship,\nif it's a parent and child\nsituation, is normal,\nas the very definition\nof child involves them\nnot being fully developed.\nThis immature development creates\na necessity for dependence\nin order to learn.\nThe problems arise when\nthe learning doesn't take,\nand the dependency persists,\neven when their chronologically,\nphysiologically adults.\nBecause the dependent person\nhas little self-agency,\nthey tend to latch\nonto healthy and solid\npresenting individuals,\nbelieving them to be able\nto take care of things.\nThe dependent person\nbasically becomes a barnacle.\nYeah, we know. Not exactly sexy.\nUnfortunately, this dependent behavior,\nwhen prolonged and intensified,\ngrows increasingly unstable.\nThe solid rock of the relationship\neventually feels\nsuffocated and controlled,\nending the relationship\nso they can breathe.\nIf, somehow, two dependent\ntypes get together,\nthat relationship\ndisintegrates even faster,\nas neither can create\neven temporary stability.\nBy the way, this barnacle\nbehavior can manifest\nin all types of relationships,\nnot just the romantic kind.\nNumber two, codependency.\nThis isn't the relationship\nbetween two dependents.\nThis is an abusive relationship\nof a vampire and their victim,\nor maybe a narcissist and their supply.\nThe narcissist believes\nthey're always right,\nand have all the answers.\nAnd the dependent is all\ntoo ready to believe that.\nTo the narcissist,\nhaving the dependent ask,\n\"What do I do?\" is like\nfeeding them candy,\nbecause now they've been\nhanded the game pad,\nand can play the dependent\nlike a penny arcade machine.\nCodependent relationships are known\nfor the unhealthy imbalance,\nwhereof the controlling abuser\nand the people-pleasing other person\nfollowing and feeding into it.\nEven if the other person\nisn't a raging narcissist,\nif one party depends on\nthe other's treatment\nto form the entirety of their\nhappiness and satisfaction,\nthis is also a form of codependency.\nAn imbalance like this means\nan inevitable fall into abuse,\nwhether that be physical,\nmental, emotional, or financial.\nThe weak link that opens\nthe doors to this is,\nagain, a lack of\nindividual self-confidence\nand awareness that you are the only one\nwho has the true power and\nright to decide who you are.\nNumber three, independency.\nIndependent is good.\nLet's get that straight\nfirst and foremost.\nIndependent means you take responsibility\nfor your own actions,\nand know yourself, so you\ncan trust your decisions.\nYou can be happy and reach out to learn,\nmake mistakes, and grow.\nYou'll get something out of it. Always.\nYet, yes, we're gonna say it again.\nBalance.\nYou actually can have\ntoo much independence,\noften because the\nindependence has been gained\nfrom an unhealthy source,\nlike trauma, or being\nfrequently hurt by others.\nIndependence at the extreme\nmeans pushing people away,\nbecause not only do you trust yourself,\nyou trust only yourself, and no one else.\nThis I'm an island and no one\nmay land here attitude leads\nto being overworked, overloaded,\nand overtaxed in every\nsingle aspect of your life,\nsince you won't allow anyone else to help.\nIn a relationship, any relationship,\nthis is like flipping the bird\nto the other person, saying,\n\"I don't need you, and I don't trust you.\"\nThe other person gets the message.\nThey aren't important to you,\nand you don't even want them there.\nThere is no other way\nfor this to end than a crash and burn,\nthe epicness of which is dependent\non how aggressive the independence is.\nWhat remains is a lonely,\nself-centered individual,\nthriving and driving for\nthemselves, and themselves alone.\nEven this is pursuing an impossible goal,\nsince we can't do everything ourselves,\nas much as we try to.\nHumans, as a species, require\nat least some social cohesion\nand interaction in order to thrive.\nWe do not advance or benefit\nfrom rejecting the expertise\nof others in favor of\nfeeding our own pride.\nNumber four, interdependency.\nFinally, a dependency type that's good.\nYou know why?\nIt's because it's defined\non a basis of balance,\nthe light and the dark,\nthe push and the pull,\nthe ebb and the flow,\nall resulting in harmony.\nYou and your friend or partner acknowledge\nand value the emotional bond you share,\nwhile still being whole\nand solid yourselves.\nThe fundamental factor for the creation\nof interdependence is you\nand the other person having\na strong sense of self,\nbasically, know thyself.\nBe confident and steadfast\nwith your boundaries.\nUnderstand clearly what\nyou like and dislike.\nKnow what you want and why you want it.\nValue yourself for being you,\nwhile also inviting knowledge,\nand recognizing the value others have.\nWhen the other person in the\nrelationship does the same,\nthe interactions encourage\ngrowth, learning,\nand strengthening of the bond.\nTo recognize interdependency,\nlook for characteristics\nlike healthy boundaries,\nactive listening, time\nfor personal interests,\nand taking personal\nresponsibility for behaviors,\nalong with being open and\napproachable with each other.\nDependency is a must in\nsmall doses due to our need,\nas humans, to socially interact.\nYou can only talk to yourself\nfor so long, after all.\nAs we pursue and\nparticipate in any activity,\nhowever, we must always\nbe aware of balance,\nlest things go awry, and make\nwhat was once an opportunity\nfor learning into a source of bad ju-ju.\nDo you relate to any of\nthe points mentioned above?\nFeel free to share and give us a Like.\nWe actually do depend on\nyour continued support\nto keep giving you quality information.\nSo thank you and catch you next time."
