    "transcript": "[Music]\nhey psych2goers welcome back to another\npsych2go video\nso\nwhat is intelligence really\nwe know it isn't as simple as an iq\nscore which is something even stephen\nhawking thoroughly denounced\nand we can likely agree that mr hawking\nwas quite intelligent\nintelligence is a complex\nmulti-dimensional construct that can\nmean a variety of things for a variety\nof different people\nso it can be hard to put into words what\nit all means\nbut no matter what definition you may\nadhere to there's one thing all of us\ncan agree on\nyou know intelligence when you see it a\nhighly intelligent person is someone\nwho's gifted at analyzing concepts and\nbuilding upon them to form a better\nunderstanding of the world and those\naround them\nhow everything is connected and why\nthings are the way they are\nthese people often have remarkably high\niqs academic achievements and go on to\nbecome successful leaders and\ntrailblazers in their fields\nwondering if you're one of them\nlet's look at eight struggles only\nhighly intelligent people will\nunderstand one\nyou get bored with small talk\nif you've ever heard the quote great\nminds discuss ideas average minds\ndiscuss events small minds discuss\npeople this is what it means\nhighly intelligent people aren't drawn\nto what they consider the unimportant\ndetails of life\nchatting about the game or the\nneighbor's newest lawn flamingo isn't\nsomething they see as a must-talk about\nitem\nrather they enjoy discussing ideas and\nconcepts in anything from art to science\nthey think in ways of the deep the\nabstract and the thought-provoking\nmeaning small talk feels exhausting and\ntime-wasting\ntwo\nyou're careful with your words\ndo people around you often describe you\nas reserved or overly serious\nmany smart people tend to think more\nthan they speak\nthis means that if they choose to share\nsomething it's highly likely they've\nconsidered it from every possible angle\nwith rationale and logic to back up the\nconclusions they've come to\nall this preparation though can mean\nlong silences while they construct the\nthought\nwhich then gives the impression of being\nreserved or overly serious which leads\nto the next struggle three you're\nsocially awkward\nhere's where the common movie trope of\nthe awkward nerd comes in\nyou've seen it\nthe wide-eyed stare as a smart person\nrealizes their response\nis awaited in silence\nor their cringe-inducing statement made\nat exactly the wrong time earned them\nthe disgust of the popular kids\nforevermore\nokay we admit it the media displays this\nin an exaggerated manner however they\naren't all wrong the awkwardness is even\nbacked up in research a study by\ndavidson in 2015 showed the people who\nhave a high iq tend to have a lower eq\nor emotional intelligence quotient which\nis what helps us form relationships and\nhone our social skills\nlife it's all about trade-offs\nfour you struggle to make good friends\nis making true friends and finding your\ncrowd somewhat of a challenge for you\nsome people are highly intimidated by\nintelligence and the perception that\nsomeone is too smart for them\nthey feel like they can't relate or\nperhaps they're not smart enough\npeople don't generally like to feel this\nway so their response is to simply not\nbefriend the smart person\nthe highly intelligent person is still\nthe person and people get lonely\nif you can relate to this you may think\nif it's my intelligence that drives\npeople away then should i dumb it down\nfor acceptance\nwell ideally you're drawn to other\npeople in the same intelligence sphere\nas you\nthey may be rare but they're out there\nfive you don't get out much\nif you're highly intelligent you'll most\nlikely struggle in social situations\nyou aren't so good at small talk and\nfind it hard to make friends\nwhat effect does this have on the bigger\npicture\nit could mean you don't get to go out\nmuch so you focus heavily on academics\nthrowing yourself into work work work\neven if you generally enjoy academic\npursuits the severe life imbalance\nbetween work and social integration\neventually leads to overwork unhappiness\nand possibly low self-esteem\n6. you're overly analytical\nhave you ever heard of paralysis by\nanalysis\nwell\nthis is a common struggle for the highly\nintelligent person it happens when\nyou're crippled by always needing to\nknow the correct answer or the most\ncorrect answer or making the best\ndecision\ndo you always struggle with\nindecisiveness\njust like how you think thoroughly of\nall the angles before saying something\nin conversation you do the same thing\nbefore you make a decision or give an\nanswer\nyou also tend to be able to find so many\nangles pros and cons that it can end up\nmaking you more indecisive\nthere is so much input that it clogs\nyour output\nseven your mind constantly craves\nexercise\nbeing a highly intelligent person means\nyou enjoy and need constant intellectual\nstimulation\nin short your mind has the munchies\nyou always want to do something that\nengages your brain skills dips you in a\nnew discovery or lets you stretch your\nthinking muscles this means simple\neveryday tasks or already solved\nproblems feel like a drag\npretty soon so many things feel being\nthere done that that the search for the\nnext thing becomes arduous\n8. you're always feeling pressured to\nsucceed\nif we may paraphrase the late great\nuncle ben\nwith great intelligence comes great\nexpectation\nif you're a highly intelligent person\nyou've probably felt that somewhat\nindirect pressure to succeed from who\nfrom everyone\nyes much of it comes from within however\nevery time your friend casually says so\nanother 4.0 this semester or drinks on\nyou for being employee of the month\nagain right\na little part of your mind nudges you\nsaying this is your place you need to be\nhere\nalways\nso you end up pushing yourself to\nconstantly prove your intelligence\nleading to exacerbated perfectionist\ntendencies and an unhealthy\ndisproportionate fear of failure\ndo you relate to any of the struggles\nmentioned in this video let us know in\nthe comments below\nwe get it feeling a bit of victory by\nknowing things others don't sound so\nincredibly good however there are always\nmany sides to a thing and being smart\nisn't always a piece of cake\nothers might try to define you by your\nintelligence seeing you simply as a\nbrain or an iq score\nstill more many may never get past that\nso they never try to get to know you\nmaybe even villainizing you out of\njealousy\nthis can leave you lonely and feeling\ndisconnected\ntruth is there's nothing wrong with you\nfor being who you are\nin the end others don't validate or\ncreate who you are only you do\nwe'd love to hear your intelligent and\nthought-provoking comments below please\nlike and share we'll see you in the next\nvideo"
