    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psy2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nOften when we have a crush,\nthere's a desire for\nthem to feel the same way\nabout you as you feel about them.\nYou may think,\n\"How can I get them to notice me?\nHow can I get them to\nview me romantically?\"\nWell, there are a few things you can do\nto increase your chances\nof them viewing you\nas more than just friends.\nHere are a few ways to\npsychologically attract someone.\nNumber one, reveal a secret of yours\nand show that you can keep one too.\nA 2009 study by researchers,\nCatherine A. Cottrell, Steven L. Neuberg,\nand Norman P. Li, found that people\ngreatly valued trustworthiness\nin their relationships.\nThe study states, \"Across\ndifferent measures\nof trait importance and different\ngroups and relationships,\ntrustworthiness was\nconsidered extremely important\nfor all interdependent others.\nThe evidence for the enhanced importance\nof cooperativeness across\ndifferent interdependent\ncontacts was more equivocal.\nAlong with trustworthiness,\nthey valued trustingness as well.\"\nAccording to researchers, trustingness,\nin particular, indicates\nthat an individual\nwill accept as true others'\ncommitments and promises.\nAn attribute that can save others\nthe costs of repeatedly\nsignaling their commitment.\nTrust is huge in any relationship.\nOne way you can show you\ntrust someone early on\nis to tell them a small secret of yours.\nThis may bring you closer,\nmore importantly, show\nthat you can keep one\nif they reveal a secret to you.\nTwo, ask out someone who is\nsimilarly as attractive as you.\nFirst approved in 1966 by\nAmerican social psychologist,\nElaine Hatfield and her colleagues,\nthe matching hypothesis is the idea\nthat people are more likely to form\na successful relationship with someone\nif they're both similar\nin how generally attractive they are.\nThe American Psychological Association\ndescribes the theory as the proposition\nthat people tend to form relationships\nwith individuals who have a\nsimilar level of social value,\noften with an emphasis on equality\nand physical attractiveness.\nResearch indicates that\nthis similarity tends\nto be greater for couples\nhaving a romantic relationship\nthan for friend.\nSo while you should definitely tell\nwhoever you like your\ntrue feelings for them,\nyou may have an easier time forming\na romantic relationship with someone\nwho is similar to how you look.\nThat is if you agree with\nthe matching hypothesis.\nNo wonder so many couples look similar,\nreally, just keep your\nmind open to all types,\nlooks and personalities.\nIf you're struggling,\nmaybe look to someone similar to you,\nperhaps not only in looks\nbut personality as well.\nAre you tired of swiping left and right?\nOr maybe you're trying to\nfind love in the wrong place.\nWe wanna thank cupid.com\nfor sponsoring this video.\nCupid's not just a regular dating site.\nIt's a site where you can be yourself.\nTheir aim is create authentic\nrelationships with people.\nWith their highly advanced user interface\nand many helpful features,\ngetting to know someone new\nwill be a walk in the park.\nUse the link below to start\nfinding your match today.\nNumber three, display confidence\nand show open body language.\nIt's great to have confidence\nin yourself for many reasons,\nand it can often pay off\nwhen getting to know others as well.\nHave you ever heard confidence is key?\nWell, showing confidence can be key\nto getting others to notice romantically.\nDisplaying a bit of confidence\nis often seen as attractive.\nWhy?\nWell, generally people\nwant to be confident.\nSo seeing someone who is can be admirable.\nOne way you can appear more confident\nis to display open body language.\nKeep your chest and torso open\nand try not to cross your arms too much.\nClosed body language can give off\nthe impression that you aren't available\nor simply don't want to talk.\nAvailability is key in making friends\nand simply giving others a chance\nto talk with you.\nSo that crush of yours,\nif they see you look approachable,\nthey may just want to approach you.\nNumber four, don't be afraid\nto show that you like them.\nDo you have a fear that your crush\nwill find out how you feel about them?\nWell, them finding out\ncan often be a good thing.\nHave you ever heard of reciprocity\nof a track or reciprocal liking?\nThis is a psychological term\nused to describe when one person starts\nto feel attraction for someone only after\nhearing that that individual likes them.\nA 1959 study published in Human Relations\ntold their group subjects\nthat certain individuals\nin the group would likely like them.\nAfter group discussions,\nobjects told researchers\nwho they liked the most.\nCan you guess who they liked?\nYeah, the subjects chose the people\nthat they were told initially liked them.\nSo if you admire someone\nand want to be friends\nor more than friends,\nkey them into the idea\nthat you like them.\nThis may get them to\nstart thinking of you more\nand therefore get them to like you back.\nNumber or five, choose a date\nlocation with dim lights.\nSo you finally asked your crush out\nand you are deciding a\nlocation for your first date.\nWord of advice, pick a\nplace with dim lighting.\nIn a significant research study published\nin the journal, Scientific American,\nresearchers showed male subjects\ntwo photographs of the same woman.\nIn one of the images researchers changed\nthe size of her pupils\nto be faintly larger\nwhile the other image was adjusted\nso she had smaller pupils.\nNone of the men reported\nnoticing this slight change.\nThe men described the woman\nwith small pupils as\ncold, hard, and selfish.\nAnd the woman with larger pupils\nwas described as soft,\nmore feminine, and pretty.\nMany furthers studies\nhave had similar results.\nWhen it comes to women's\npreferences on pupils size,\nstudies suggest that they're\nsimilar in some ways.\nFindings appears to suggest that women\nwho are attracted to nice guys\nare attracted to medium sized pupils.\nWhile those who like bad boys\nare attracted to larger pupils.\nWell, obviously we can't\ncontrol the size of our pupils,\nbut dimming the lights will expand them.\nSo that restaurant\nyou've been deliberating\nwith their romantic candlelight dinner,\nsounds like an attractive choice,\npsychologically that is.\nAnd number six, engage\nin deep conversations\nand sometimes paraphrase what they say.\nResearch from Harvard found\nthat deep conversations\nand meaningfully talking about yourself\ncan help activate the very\nsame regions of your brain\nthat delicious food or sex activates.\nThe study states that\nover a 45 minute period,\nsubject pairs carried out self disclosure\nand relationship building tasks\nthat gradually escalated in intensity.\nThe study one found\ngreater post-interaction\ncloseness with these tasks\nversus comparable small talk tasks.\nSo while small talk is\nfine, every now and then,\nwhen you're on a romantic date,\na more meaningful discussion\nmay excite them more.\nSkip all the talk about the weather\nand share something about yourself.\nWhen you both open up and\nreveal your true emotions,\nyour partner may fall\nin love with the deep,\nengaging conversations\nyou've had together instead.\nActively listening is often seen\nas attractive as well.\nIt can't just be you\ntalking on a first date.\nA way to show them that\nyou are actively listening\nand that you understand them,\nparaphrase what they've told you\nand repeat it back to them.\nThis is known as reflective listening.\nSo actively listen\nand then offer what you understood\nfrom their discussion back to them.\nIt's a great way to show\nyou empathize with them\nand brings you closer.\nFindings from a 2007\nresearch study published\nin the American Journal of Psychotherapy\nfurthered this theory.\nThe studies have found\nthat when therapists\nuse reflective listening,\ntheir patients had a higher chance\nof disclosing more\ninformation on their emotions\nand their therapeutic relationship\nwith their therapist improved.\nSo it's good for any type of relationship.\nSimply put, it brings people closer.\nSo if you engage in a deep conversation\nunder a candlelit dinner,\nit may even bring you\nand your crush closer\nto a romantic relationship.\nSo will you use any of these\ntips to attract someone?\nWhich ones will you try out first?\nLet us know in the comments down below.\nRemember that someone may find\nsome of your qualities attractive\nthe more they get to know you.\nSo it's likely worth it to simply ask them\non that first date,\nso you get the chance to show them\nthe great person that you are.\nAnd of course, actively\nlisten to who they are too.\nAs tips number one and four suggest,\nshare a secret of
