    "transcript": "ever been a little confused by someone\nyou've noticed them and maybe thought\nthe eye contact was a little longer than\nusual but nah maybe they were spacing\nout\nthey've been pretty nice to you lately\nbut it could also be because you let\nthem have the last donut in the\nlunchroom last week\nwho knows\nyou want to know maybe they are that\ninto you or maybe you're making\nsomething out of nothing\nwe don't want to jump the gun and freak\nsomeone out right\nfortunately although people can have a\npoker face they don't have poker body so\nto see if there's a good chance someone\nis into you look out for signs like\nnumber one they open up to you\nsure you talk with them but when it\nhappens are you finding that they open\nup to you talking about real and\npersonal things or maybe even asking for\nadvice\nif so that's a sign of trust which is a\npretty healthy part of the recipe to\nliking someone\nyou'd never open up a vulnerability to\nsomeone you dislike after all\nyes we know that trust is also a part of\nbeing friends but remember that being a\ngood friend is also one of the\nfoundations of a strong healthy romantic\nrelationship\nso you might simply have a good friend\nbut opening up to someone could also\nmake you fall in love with the person\neither way it's pretty sweet to know\nyou're trusted\nnumber two they don't mention or\nconverse about other people in their\nlives\ndo you find that when you're having a\nconversation with this person the only\nprotagonist in the story is either\nthemselves or you\nmaybe you've even tried to ask them if\nthey're seeing someone and they just\nveer right off the topic\nalthough you could suspect that they\nhave some sort of talk show level secret\nin their love lives a more likely reason\nis their feelings for you this exclusion\nof others in conversation is keeping\nthemselves in your focus and as\navailable to you they might even throw\nin some mild self-depreciating comments\nlike i guess it's a solo valentine for\nme this year\nyou could even gauge their reaction by\nresponding with something like\nis that a hint or\nis that a good thing\nif you're interested offer to fix the\nsituation number three\nthey clean up real nice\naround you\nif you know someone who's everyday\nuniform is a grey or black hoodie in\njeans but when they meet up with you\nthey're always wearing nice clothes\nyou've never seen before or they mention\ntheir achievements to you despite this\nnot being part of their usual\nconversation type\nbasically does it seem sometimes like\nthey're showcasing their stuff to have\nyou look at them\nit could very well be that they're doing\nit to prove their great partner material\nit could also just mean they have\nserious insecurity issues\nbut then they'd be more likely to be\nboastful in general not presenting to\nyou specifically like a peacock mating\ndance\nnumber 4. they often compliment you\ndon't get all worked out because someone\nsaid you had a nice shirt the other day\nthis is a repeated and frequent behavior\nbut subtle\nthe person is trying to hide their crush\non you so it's not going to be as\nstraightforward as you're breathtaking\nand i want to be with you\nthey'll sneak it in either consciously\nor unconsciously but it'll happen fairly\noften and often from the side\nthey might ask you new shirt and then\nfollow it up with yeah looks good\nthen when your friends want a suggestion\nfor eats they'll pipe up to volunteer\nyour expertise since you have such great\ntaste\nof course this person could just be\ncomplimentary in general so observe if\nyou're either the only one being\ncomplimented or if the niceties fall\nheavily in your favor\nnumber five they participate in your\nsocial media\nchecking on social media alone is just\neveryday life now it's not unusual to\nfollow everyone on everything\nwhat is unusual and could well be a sign\nof something more is how much attention\nthey paid to your social media and you\ncan tell by their participation in it\nthe likes and comments this is even more\napparent if you know they almost never\ncomment anywhere else or if they\nfaithfully comment and react to\neverything you post and only giving a\nrandom thumbs up to other people this\ncould mean they spend their free time\nscrolling through your feed wishing they\nwere with you in whatever stories that\nfeed tells\nif you get a notification saying they\nliked your pick from 36 weeks ago\nyou know what's up\nand they're probably mortified because\nthey think you now think they're creepy\nbe nice it happens\nand number six others tell you they\nmight like you\nemotions serve their purpose but boy do\nthey ever make things confusing\nthis is where you use your lifeline also\nknown as your friends\nothers because they aren't mired in the\nsoup of feelings can usually see more\nclearly and objectively this is\nespecially true if you and the person in\nquestion hang out together in a group\nbecause then they can observe changes to\nhow this person acts around you versus\nwhen you're absent\nalso they have a better chance at\nhearing if they ask about you or talk\nabout you\nthey can then give you a verdict\nunclouded by personal goals\nlife is complex humans are too so even\nthough the signs mentioned could\nindicate beyond platonic affection this\nlist isn't a checklist for certainty\nthey just have a higher probability\ntowards maybe something more\nso you can know if you have a solid\nreason to investigate further remember\nat the end of the day that affection\nbonding and love are all positives\nregardless of whether this person likes\nyou like that or simply likes you and\nwants to be a closer friend it's a good\nthing you can always share the love with\nus feel free to tell us how much you\nlike us in the comments and confirm it\nwith the like button see you soon"
