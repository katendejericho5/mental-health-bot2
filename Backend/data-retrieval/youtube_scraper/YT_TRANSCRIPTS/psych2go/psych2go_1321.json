    "transcript": "hey psych2goers\nclose your eyes and think of the word\nlove\nwhat comes to mind\nis it an image of you holding a loved\none close or a picture of your beloved\npet that you can see\nnow think of the word obsession instead\nyou probably imagined a pop star being\nchased by their crazed fans or maybe a\nhobby you love doing\nthe difference between love and\nobsession is often blurred due to the\nfeeling of extreme passion and emotional\nattachment to the subject being a key\ncomponent of both however obsession can\nlean towards being an unhealthy and\ndangerous expression of love when taken\nto extremes regardless of the type of\nrelationship whether it's platonic or\nromantic\nhere are eight signs to warn you that\nwhat you or someone else may be feeling\nis obsession not love number one\nthreatened by independence\na relationship thrives when both parties\nare encouraged to maintain their own\nrelationships with themselves first and\nforemost healthy relationships consist\nof two healthy individuals who\nacknowledge and accept responsibility\nfor themselves and are capable of\ncontributing to an external relationship\nfrom a grounded and centered place an\nobsessed lover would have difficulty\nallowing their significant other the\nspace to build on their independence due\nto a lack of security within themselves\nsome examples include not allowing a\npartner to pursue a hobby individually\nfeeling threatened when a partner wants\nto hang out with friends individually or\nnot allowing a partner to pursue their\nown career path without consulting them\nfirst\nnumber two\nboundaries are ignored\nthe most healthy expressions of love\nalways allow for boundaries to be\nrespected between said too\nif you choose to speak up about needing\nspace for your well-being note the kind\nof response you receive after expressing\nyour need\nis it supportive and understanding or is\nit angry and defensive\nlove involves patience and willingness\nto allow your loved one what they need\nespecially if it will benefit their\nhealth and well-being even if it goes\nagainst your own belief desire or\ndirection for the relationship\nobsession is choosing to ignore the\nneeds and boundaries of another in favor\nof your own\nnumber three\nextremely controlling behavior\naccording to psychologist holly richards\ncontrolling behavior occurs when a\nperson is feeling insecure with them\nthemselves therefore causing them to\nexert control over others to regain a\nsense of control over their environment\ndictating what you're allowed to wear\nchoosing the friends you're allowed to\nspend time with or even monitoring where\nyou go throughout your day are all\nexamples of controlling behavior in\nobsessive friendships a friend who keeps\nyou from making new friends or becomes\nupset when you hang out with other\nexistent friends might be exhibiting\nsigns of controlling behaviors as well\nnumber four\nnot engaging in other activities\nduring the early phases of a\nrelationship or newfound friendship it\nmay seem normal to be caught up in a\nhoneymoon bubble of sorts\none that disconnects you from the\nday-to-day world\nspending time with this person might be\nthe only thing on your mind and vice\nversa\nhowever losing your sense of\ngroundedness and detaching from your\nexisting support systems such as friends\nand family might be a sign of obsession\nrather than love\nnotice if you're becoming disinterested\nin aspects of your life that have little\nor nothing to do with your new partner\nor friend like school family or hobbies\nfor example\nif you find yourself distracted to the\npoint of losing care for how the rest of\nyour life is progressing be sure to\nreassess and readjust\nnumber five\nblocking out others\na supportive lover or friend could be a\nbreath of fresh air when you need time\naway from stressful family members or\nfriendship drama an obsessive lover or\nfriend however might take advantage of\nyour dependence upon their support and\nattempt to convince you that they're the\nonly one you need and that no one else\nshould matter this may seem harmless on\nthe surface but in actuality behavior\nlike this consists of controlling\nundertones with selfish motives in time\nobsessed lovers or friends want to train\nyou to believe that their attention is\nthe only one you desire which allows\nthem to keep you under their control\nwithout interference from your friends\nor family number six moving too fast in\nthe relationship\nif you notice that your new significant\nother is in a rush to progress your\nrelationship together this may be a\nwarning sign of obsession on their part\nare you feeling pressured to officiate\nyour relationship with them publicly too\nquickly or perhaps they're asking\nserious questions about the future\ninvolving marriage kids and joint\nfinances at a rate that makes you feel\nuncomfortable someone who is in love\nwith you will understand the weight of\nthe questions they're posing and won't\nrush you because they understand you\ndeserve to have the time to decide for\nyourself if they're the right one for\nyou a person that is obsessed with you\nwill attempt to bypass your logical\nreasoning and corner you into rushing in\nwith them in turn making them feel\nsecure without considering your comfort\nnumber 7. demanding constant contact\nfeeling restricted and being pressured\nto keep in constant contact with your\nfriends or significant other can be a\nred flag a person who is obsessed with\nyou might not outwardly demand that you\ntext them throughout the day or report\non your whereabouts from hour to hour\nbut they may condition you to believe\nthat it's the best thing for you to do\nfor your relationship with them through\npassive aggressive behavior they may\nconvince you that they are racked with\nanxiety for your safety or guilt-trip\nyou into feeling as if you're a bad\npartner or friend for not talking to\nthem enough throughout your day\nwhile it's normal for everyone to\nexperience separation anxiety within a\nrelationship be sure you understand the\ndifference\nand number eight\ntracking without consent on the extreme\nend of obsession behaviors that trespass\nprivacy such as keeping track of someone\nwithout their consent can be seen as\nthreatening and dangerous to the\nwell-being of the person being tracked\nif you or a loved one is concerned this\nmay be happening to yourself or someone\nyou love please be sure to notify the\nclosest help you can find\nunless you and a loved one are a super\nspy or working for an undercover agency\nknow that finding tracking devices on\nyourself your accessories or\ntransportation vehicles should not be\naccepted as normal or appropriate\nbehavior so do you relate to any of the\nsigns we've mentioned here\nobsession can be a harmless component of\na healthy relationship but honest\nassessment and reflection are required\nto determine whether extreme levels of\npassion and admiration are causing\ndiscomfort for either party\nlove without respect for another's\npersonal needs and growth is not shared\nlove but selfish and demeaning at the\ncore\nlearning to love yourself and allowing\nothers the space to grow into self-love\nis one way to help your relationship\ndevelop healthily did you find this\nvideo
