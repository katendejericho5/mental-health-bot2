    "transcript": "Isn't having a new boyfriend\nor girlfriend so exciting?\nThere are butterflies and flirty texts,\nbrushes on the arm that make you light up,\nand long conversations over the phone.\nThe beginning of a new\nrelationship can feel so heady\nand come with a head rush\nof emotions and thoughts.\nBut how can you be sure\nthat your new bae is ready\nfor a romantic relationship?\nHow do you find out if\nyou're both on the same page?\nTo help you gain more\nclarity in your situation,\nhere are five signs that\nsomeone isn't ready.\nNumber one, they're going out\nwith a lot of different people.\nHave you ever been in a situation\nwhere you're getting to know someone\nand are starting to develop feelings,\nonly to find out\nthat they're going on multiple\ndates with other people?\nIt can be jarring and disheartening\nto find out the person you\nlike is seeing other people.\nAccording to globalnews.com,\nthis is a common scenario\ndue to the popularity of dating apps.\nApps like Tinder, Bumble,\nHinge, and countless more\nhave vastly widened the\npool for potential partners.\nOnline dating expert Julie Spira,\nwhile advocating for casting a wider net,\nalso explained the darker side\nto casting such a wide net.\nShe says that if someone\ncontinues to play the field\nand doesn't take a digital\nleap of faith with one person,\nthey may end up on a merry-go-round\nand end up in a series\nof one-and-done dates,\nor dates that don't go past a few weeks.\nIf this is happening to you,\nand you're not currently\nseeing anyone else,\nElite Daily notes that having\na straightforward conversation\nabout where the two of you are\ncould be helpful in establishing\nwhat the dynamic will be\nmoving forward in a\ncommitted relationship.\nNumber two, they bring up their ex often.\nHave you ever wondered\nwhy your new partner\nkeeps bringing up their ex?\nHave you been stuck thinking\nthat it could mean something deeper?\nMaybe they mention\ntheir ex out of nowhere,\nor reach out to their\nex on their birthday,\nor still keep in touch\nwith their ex's family.\nIf you're entering into a relationship\nwith someone who is\nemotionally unavailable\nbecause they have unresolved\nfeelings for someone else,\nthis could lead to a big hurdle\nin trying to properly connect with them.\nIf they strictly engage in\npolite conversation with you,\nand don't talk to you\nabout anything deeper or more meaningful,\nand it feels like they push you away\nwhen you get too close\nto an emotional boundary,\nthen this is a sure sign\nthat they aren't ready for a\nreal relationship with you.\nNumber three, they don't\nknow what they want.\nHave you ever expressed exactly\nwhat you need from someone,\nonly to be met with an, \"I don't know\"\nfrom the other person?\nIt's hard for someone to be all in\nand ready for a relationship with you\nif he, she, or they is\nunsure of what they want.\nIt puts you in an\nunstable kind of situation\nwith little support.\nWishy-washiness and a\nshaky sense of commitment\nis never a good sign\nwhen it comes to\nestablishing a relationship.\nNumber four, they're flaky.\nDoes your partner text you last minute\nand bail on plans or dates all the time?\nOr if they do happen to show up,\nare they chronically\nlate to every gathering?\nThis is a major problem\nwhen your partner has an inability\nto follow through on\nplans or arrive on time.\nThis type of behavior\nshows a lack of commitment\nand a skewed sense of priorities.\nIf they can't or refuse\nto make time for you,\nthen you simply aren't\nimportant enough for them,\nas they'll always have better places to be\nand friends to hang out with.\nAnd number five, there's\na lack of progression\nin the relationship.\nDoes it feel like your\nrelationship is at a standstill?\nHas there been too much\ndistance between dates?\nHas it felt like there have\nbeen any steps taken forward\nin the relationship at all?\nWhen you're suffering\na lack of progression\nin your relationship,\nthere might never be a\nmention of a future together,\nor there's no immediate plans being made,\nor you're struggling to\nfeel emotionally fulfilled.\nAccording to lifestyle.com,\nthe progression of a relationship\ntypically occurs in five stages:\nattraction and romance,\nreality sets in,\ndisappointment,\nthe stage in which conflicts get resolved\nand there is growth and\na healthy partnership,\nand finally, stability and commitment.\nIf it feels like this dynamic is in limbo\nand isn't headed towards the next stage,\nit could very well mean your\npartner simply isn't ready\nto take the plunge and\nbe in a relationship.\nDid you relate to any\nof the signs mentioned?\nIf you're unsure of\nyour relationship status\nand feel like you're holding onto\na shaky sense of commitment\nfrom your partner,\nthen it's time to give things a hard look\nand choose to fix the issues or move on.\nYou'll figure out what's best for you.\nWhat other signs can you think of\nthat someone isn't ready\nfor a relationship?\nShare your thoughts with\nus in the comments below.\nPlease like and
