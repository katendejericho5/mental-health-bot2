    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Go-ers,\nare you constantly overworking yourself\nuntil you are exhausted?\nBurnout is typically characterized\nas physical, emotional,\nand mental exhaustion,\nloss of drive and motivation,\nan inability to concentrate\nat work or school,\nfeeling apathetic or lacking in emotion,\nand a decline in productivity.\nThese symptoms can even lead to depression\nand anxiety disorders when not addressed.\nSo to help you become more aware\nof whether you're\noverworking yourself or not,\nhere are seven toxic habits\nthat lead to burnout.\nNumber one, not taking or enjoying breaks.\nDo you find yourself\nconstantly buried in your work?\nWhile you may think that\noverworking yourself means\nthat you're being more productive,\nyou may actually be depleting\nyour own productivity.\nA study by the Interview Guys showed\nthat people who skipped lunch\nhad a burnout score of 73%\nand those who ate lunch at their desks\nhad a burnout score of 54%.\nEven minor breaks,\nlike taking a brief\nwalk throughout the day,\neating a healthy snack, or even\na quick meditation session,\ncan lessen your stress levels\nand decrease your levels of burnout.\nIt's good to remember\nthat when you don't use your off switch,\nyou stand a higher\nchance of having burnout.\nNumber two, perfectionism.\nHave you set that really\nhigh standards for yourself?\nPerhaps you're a high achiever\nwhose ambition won't let\nyou settle for second best.\nOr maybe you tend to work twice as hard\nas everyone around you to appear perfect.\nThis type of thinking and\nhabit can end up trapping you\nin a vicious cycle of always needing\nto maintain an image\nof perfection forever.\nBut by always trying to look good,\nyou may only end up exhausting yourself\nto the point of burnout.\nNumber three, not saying no\nor advocating for yourself.\nDo you find yourself\nagreeing to a lot of things?\nBy always saying yes,\nyou may commit yourself\nto an overwhelming and endless to-do list.\nNobody is obligated to stand\nup and speak up for you,\nwhich is why it's important\nto learn how to advocate for yourself.\nIf you don't speak up about an issue\nor mistreatment towards you\nor try to negotiate\nbetter terms for yourself,\nyour initial anger may only morph\ninto resentment and hopelessness.\nWhile it might not always\nend up in your favor,\nit's always important to stand\nup for what is best for you.\nNumber four, poor sleep.\nHow much sleep do you get?\nAs adults and young adults,\nit's recommended that you get\nseven to nine hours of sleep.\nIf you already have a\nsleep cycle that helps you\nand that you agree with,\nthen you don't need to change anything.\nDespite what many people think,\npulling all-nighters does not help\nwith your long-term performance.\nYour brain needs time to properly\nretain what you've learned\nand consolidate what you've\nbeen through during the day\nand sleep is necessary.\nIt's a necessary tool to that.\nAfter all, you don't want to be performing\nat less than half a battery\npower at school or work.\nNumber five, poor time\nmanagement and procrastination.\nDid you end up doing the things\nyou said you'd do yesterday\nor last week?\nIt's normal to procrastinate\non things once in a while,\nhowever it may become a problem\nif it becomes a lifestyle.\nYou may end up only\nheightening your stress levels\nand overwhelming yourself\nwhen you constantly put\noff tasks and projects.\nSo if you struggle with time\nmanagement and procrastination,\nit may help to do some research\non how you can avoid putting off things\nand how to better use your time\nso that you can work, play, and relax.\nIn the end,\ngood time management can help\nyou create a better balance\nin your life.\nSix, not exercising or going outside.\nBesides increasing your\nserotonin and dopamine levels,\nboosting your metabolism,\nand strengthening your immune system,\nexercise can also reduce your stress\nand hypertension levels.\nIt's recommended to\nexercise three times a week\nfor about 30 minutes.\nEven taking a short walk when\nyou've been sitting all day\ncan help to provide more\ncirculation to your legs\nand prevent blood clots from occurring.\nAccording to a study by Ewert and Chang,\nbeing in nature has the added bonus\nof reducing psychological stress levels.\nYou don't even need to\nbe outside for long.\nJust 15 minutes can do the trick.\nNumber seven, failure to\nperform self-care routines.\nDo you push yourself to keep working,\neven when you're feeling fatigued\nand are lacking the motivation to?\nWhen you don't acknowledge\nthe stress in your life\nor counter it with self-care routines,\nyou increase your burnout levels.\nIt's vitally important\nto have a balanced life.\nThis means getting\nenough sleep and exercise\nand having a healthy diet\nand good coping mechanisms for stress.\nSo never forget about\ndays off and holidays.\nIf you have paid time off,\nit benefits you to take it.\nDo activities that you enjoy\nand that soothes and relaxes you.\nAnd number eight, not asking for help.\nAre you afraid to reach out for help?\nWhether it's because\nyou're afraid of rejection\nor scared you'd be imposing\non your fellow colleagues,\nsupervisors, or professors,\nit may be difficult\nfor you to ask for help\nwhen you need it.\nBut the truth is it's hard\nand impossible to shoulder\neverything on your own,\nso when you need guidance\nor clarity on something,\nremember that it's not weakness\nto ask for help when you need it.\nHelp
