ways you can tell.\nTo help you out, here are\nsix psychological ways\nto tell if your crush likes you.\nNumber one.\nThey act flustered, silly,\nand sweat when they're around you.\nHow nervous do you get around your crush?\nOdds are, if they like you too,\nthey may just be as anxious as you are.\nMost people tend to get a bit flustered\nwhen they're around someone\nthey're attracted to.\nStammering, breaking out\nin sweats, and clammy hands\ncan be signs someone likes you so much\nthat you make them nervous.\nSometimes, attraction can make\nus a bit silly or even dumb.\nResearch has found that sexual arousal\nshuts off parts of the\nprefrontal cortex of the brain.\nThis region of the brain\nis responsible for critical\nthinking, rational behavior,\nand self-awareness.\nSo next time you're\naround someone you like,\npay close attention.\nDo they always break out in sweat?\nCan they not speak as\neloquently as they usually do?\nMaybe they simply have\na secret crush on you.\nNumber two.\nThey remove any barriers\nbetween the two of you.\nDo you notice your crush\nremoves any barriers\nbetween them as soon as you approach?\nDo they ever so subtly scoot\ncloser to you when you're near?\nDo they lean more so towards you\nthan anyone else in a group?\nWell, according to\npsychologist, Jack Schafer,\n\"People lean toward people they like\n\"and distance themselves\nfrom people they dislike.\"\nInward leaning increases\nas rapport increases,\nmeaning you may first turn\nyour head towards someone\nand then your shoulders,\nfollowed by your torso.\nThen, if you're really interested\nin what someone has to say,\nyou'll lean towards them.\nSo if someone is attracted to you,\nodds are, they may just lean towards you\nwhen they get the chance,\nnot just to be closer,\nbut because they are deeply interested\nin what you have to say and who you are.\nDr. Jack Schafer also explains\nin Psychology Today that,\n\"People who like each other\n\"remove any obstacles between them.\"\nHe continues to say that,\n\"A barrier does not necessarily mean\n\"that someone doesn't like you,\n\"but it may just show your rapport\n\"isn't as strong as you hoped it to be.\"\nTry to get to know them a bit more\nand share some interests of yours.\nYou're rapport may just increase.\nNumber three.\nThey mirror your behavior.\nHave you noticed someone\nmirroring your behaviors,\neven to the point\nthat they almost subtly your\nstyle of speaking or language?\nWell, sometimes when someone really likes\nor admires someone,\nthey'll subconsciously\nmimic their behavior.\nYou've probably done it too.\nThink about it.\nHave you ever found yourself\nadopting someone else's gestures\nor movements at a party\nor a social setting?\nIt's not that you consciously intended it,\nand hey, maybe you did,\nbut yet, here you are suddenly acting\nand speaking like your crush.\nThis psychological phenomenon\nis called the chameleon effect\nand was explored in further studies.\nPeople tend to subconsciously\nmimic other people's behavior\nin certain settings,\nthat is, if we like them.\nSo if you catch someone mimicking you,\nthey either wanna be your friend\nor they may just feel attracted to you.\nNumber four.\nTheir pupils dilate when they look at you.\nOkay, so next time you see your\ncrush, look into their eyes.\nYeah, I know, it may be difficult\nsince you get all nervous\nand sweaty around them\nand start babbling like a fool,\nbut hey, it's worth a shot.\nWhy do this you may ask?\nBecause you'll wanna notice\nif their pupils dilate.\nAccording to body language\nexpert, Patti Wood,\nauthor of Success Signals:\nA Guide To Reading Body Language,\n\"Dilation is a brain response that occurs\n\"when you like and are\nattracted to something.\"\nSo if you notice someone's pupils dilate\nwhen they look deeply into\nyour eyes, mid-conversation,\nthis could likely be a sign\nthey're attracted to you.\nAnd then if your pupils\ndilate in attraction as well,\nit's a good thing to be revealed.\nNumber five.\nTheir face is flushed when\nthey see you or talk to you.\nSomething else to pay attention to,\nalong with staring into their eyes\nthe next time you see them,\nnotice that their face becomes flushed\nwhen you look at them.\nWhen people are attracted to someone,\nthey can become anxious.\nA kick of adrenaline, and\nsuddenly, they're flushing.\nIf you notice someone\noften blushes around you\nand their face becomes red\nwhen you're talking to them,\nthey may very well like you\nas much as you like them.\nAnd number six, their\nsmile is suddenly genuine\nwhen you're near.\nAh, do you smile when you\nslip into the sweet bliss\nof daydreaming about your crush?\nIf you could only take them\nto your favorite taco stand\nand introduce them to\nyour pet turtle, Larry.\nAh, well.\nI suppose you'll have to figure\nout if they like you first.\nWell, when you're around them,\nnotice how often they smile\nand what kind of smile\nthey have on their face.\nHave you ever heard of the Duchenne smile?\nThere are a few common facial\nexpressions that can give way\nto what someone is really\nthinking or feeling.\nA Duchenne smile is one of them.\nWanna know if someone is\ngenuinely smiling in delight?\nYou can simply look out for this smile.\nAccording to Healthline,\n\"This occurs when the\nzygomaticus major muscle\n\"lifts the corners of your\nmouth at the same time\n\"the orbicularis oculi\nmuscles lift your cheeks\n\"and crinkle your eyes at the corners.\"\nBasically, it's the type of smile\nthat reaches up to your eyes,\ncausing those wrinkles by your eyes,\nknown as crow's feet to appear.\nThis type of smile appears when\nsomeone is genuinely happy,\nas opposed to a polite and kind smile,\nor even a forced smile.\nNow, are they happy to see you\nbecause you're their friend\nor because they like you?\nWell, if they have several\nof the above signs,\nit looks like you'll be introducing\nthem to Larry after all,\ntacos in hand.\nNow, ask them out already.\nYou got this, I believe in you.\nSo, do you think your crush likes you?\nHow many signs do they exhibit?\nFeel free to share with us\nin the comments down below.\nWhether you think they like you or not,\nit's likely worth it to\nask them out to find out.\nBetter to know you tried\nthan having a bit of regret,\nnot letting them know how\nyou really feel, right?\nSo go ahead, ask them out\nfor tacos, you got this.\nLarry, the turtle and\nI, we believe in you.\nYeah, he's a turtle, and so what?\nWe hope you enjoyed this video,\nand if you did, don't forget\nto click the like button\nand share it with a friend,\nor someone you
