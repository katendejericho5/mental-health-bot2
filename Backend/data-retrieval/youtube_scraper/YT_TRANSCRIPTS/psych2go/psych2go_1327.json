    "transcript": "hey psychoers welcome back to our\nchannel ah love is in the air and so is\ngreat care taken by you\nwhy because it's valentine's day which\nmeans for some partners they're\nscrambling for gifts expensive jewelry\nand last minute dinner reservations\nalong with the positive ways a\ncelebration of love can affect you and\nyour relationship there are also ways in\nwhich valentines can negatively impact\nyou single or in a relationship here are\nfive reasons why valentine's day is bad\nfor you number one\nyou may be pressured to spend lots of\nmoney\ndo you feel a bit pressured to spend\nloads of money on expensive gifts and\nflowers\nit's the thought that counts really your\ngift doesn't have to be super expensive\nto mean more to your partner but many\nfeel pressured into spending a great\ndeal of money on gifts for their partner\nduring the holiday of love\nyou may go out of your normal spending\nbudget for this holiday but if you find\nyourself pressured by that sales\nassociate to spend big on some diamond\njewelry or fancy cologne then you'll not\nonly feel the pressure during the\nholiday but afterwards when you look in\nyour wallet next\nunless you use a credit card then it's\nlike it never happened\nright\nnumber two expectations are high\nexpectations can be very high on\nvalentine's day not just for gifts but\nfor the romantic day many partners may\nstart to expect this holiday to be the\nbest of the best an amazing romance\ndriven day filled with joy and love\nbut it's not often like that for many\njonathan fader psychologist and\nassistant professor of family medicine\nat the albert einstein college of\nmedicine wrote in his article from\npsychology today that\nsetting expectations so high can set us\nup for disappointment when reality\ndoesn't match up with these unrealistic\nhopes he writes he continues explaining\nthat one study found that couples who\nenter relationships with positive\nexpectations are more likely to face\nlater disappointment and relationship\ndysfunction than couples who enter with\nmore realistic expectations\nso remember it's just a day to give your\npartner a bit of extra love and\naffection let them know how much you\ncare for them but avoid the expectations\nthat it will be the best day ever\nnumber three\nit may set off depressive thoughts\nfor those who are single valentine's day\ncan set off a stream of lonely thoughts\nand feelings if you're feeling lonely\nand desire a partner valentine's day may\nnot help with those feelings\nnot only are stores lined with little\nreminders about romance and love but\nthen you're reminded about the holiday\nonline too\nif possible avoid comparing yourself to\nothers and know that you don't need a\npartner to feel happy call a friend a\nsibling set up a galentine's day party\nhave a self-care day\nvalentine's day doesn't need to be all\nabout romance it can simply be about\nlove too for yourself or others\nnumber four\nyour partner isn't clear on what they\nwant\nso we've mentioned the pressure to buy\nexpensive gifts for your partner but\nmany couples find their partner isn't\nquite clear on what they want for the\nholiday some may not even know what they\nwant though you may have a different\ntype of pressure not to spend more money\nbut find something extra special\nwhat if they get you something very\nmeaningful but you don't know what to\nget them this is simply another way\npressure and stress can wreak havoc on\nyour mind on valentine's day\nand number five you may make comparisons\ndo you make comparisons with how other\ncouples spent their valentines or maybe\nwith your favorite romance movie\ncomparing your happiness to others can\nlead to not only stress but unnecessary\ndissatisfaction you may start to analyze\nyour relationship more than needed\nsimply because your friend had an\nover-the-top valentine's day while yours\nwas a sweet day out with your partner\nbut really you had a great time\ncomparisons may leave you feeling bad or\nworried you should have done more for\nyour partner\nyour friend might even be comparing\ntheir day to yours and feeling the same\nway\npsychologist jonathan fader explains in\npsychology today that these comparisons\ncan lead to dissatisfaction about our\nown way of celebrating even if it was\nperfectly enjoyable and satisfying in\nthe moment\nindeed they can\nyou may think that everyone else's day\nwas simply perfect and may feel a little\nput down by it all\nbut people generally like to share the\nhighlights only instead of comparing\nyour day with others focus on how your\nday was simple\nsweet or special to you it was with\nsomething you love whether that be a\nperson or a favorite movie in a bowl of\npopcorn\nrear window you're a classic\nif possible enjoy your day for what it\nis it's special to you with a loved one\nor yourself\nhey still gotta love yourself and why\nshouldn't you you're pretty amazing\nso go ahead and celebrate that and go\nahead and indulge in those delicious\nboxes of chocolates not the expensive\nones your wallet will thank you later\nso how will you spend valentine's day\nwill it be a galentine's day a good old\nday with the family a self-care day feel\nfree to comment down below we hope you\nenjoyed this video and if you did
