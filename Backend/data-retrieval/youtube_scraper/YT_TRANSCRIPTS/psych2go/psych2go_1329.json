    "transcript": "Number one, dwelling in sadness.\nDo you often find yourself\ndwelling on your negative experiences\nand the sadness they've caused you?\nWe're not saying that bad experiences\nshould just roll off your shoulders.\nIn fact, reflecting for a\nhealthy period of time is great\nand can actually make you happier,\nbut in your everyday life,\nwhen you can't bring yourself to let go\nand move on from something minor,\nyou end up holding onto anger and sadness\nmore than you need to.\nThis leads to lingering\nresentment and bitterness,\nwhich shows in your behaviors as well.\nTwo, overthinking.\nHave you ever sat in bed,\nstewing over an event over\nand over and over again,\nmaybe replaying it in your\nhead a few too many times,\ntrying to gain a new insight\nor feel a different way?\nOverthinking happens to the best of us,\nbut in chronically unhappy people,\nthis sort of pattern can\neasily become a habit.\nWhen we negatively overthink,\nwe run the risk of distorting a situation\nin a way that sends unnecessary alarms\nthrough our body and mind.\nThis can lead your temperament\nto take a turn for the worst.\nGoing back and over\nanalyzing past situations\ncan leave us with a sinking feeling\nthat can just make us unhappier.\nWhen someone shoulders too much\nof what they cannot\nsingle-handedly control,\nthey may prohibit themselves\nfrom being happy with their own lives.\nNumber three, thinking negatively.\nWhen things are going well,\ndo you relax or does it\nmake you feel oddly on edge?\nWhen you succeed, do you\nlet yourself enjoy it?\nThose who are chronic really unhappy\ntend to approach situations\nand life in general.\nwith a negative point of view.\nStudies show,\nthey may often feel\ndissatisfied with what they have\nand even fear the feeling of happiness.\nWhile this dissatisfaction\nand negative outlook\nmay not be a conscious choice,\nrecognizing it in yourself\ncan help save you from so much\nunhappiness in the future.\nIn a world filled with\nso much uncertainty,\nit's natural to wanna stay on your toes,\nbut too much pessimism can get\nin the way of your happiness.\nNumber four, isolating themselves.\nDo you find yourself staying\ninside longer than you need to?\nAre you often one to cancel plans\nor remove yourself from social situations?\nAccording to Dr. Travis\nBradberry from HuffPost,\nchronically unhappy people tend\nto give in to the temptation\nof avoiding others.\nOftentimes when we aren't happy,\nhanging out with people\ndoesn't sound too appealing,\nbut long-term isolation\ncan increase the risks\nof mental health issues,\nsuch as depression.\nFive, bottling up emotions.\nWhen you get upset, do\nyou keep your feelings in?\nIf so, do they mess with your mood?\nBottling up emotions, especially\nover a long period of time\nis a habit of chronically unhappy people\nbecause by keeping it in,\nthey don't give themselves\na chance to heal\nfrom what they're feeling.\nExpressing emotions can seem daunting,\nbut it helps you lighten\nyour burdened mindset,\ngiving you a freeing sensation.\nNumber six, getting insufficient sleep.\nLet's talk about sleep.\nDo you wake up tired in the morning?\nDo you sleep at different\ntimes each night?\nWhile none of this is uncommon,\nit can actually be a major\nfactor in your happiness.\nA 2018 study from South Korea\nexplains that poor sleep quality by itself\nis enough to negatively impact your life\nsatisfaction and wellbeing.\nSleep quality can encompass a lot,\nbut it mostly refers to how well you sleep\nthrough the night.\nNumber seven, comparing\nthemselves to others.\nAnd this is a hard one\nbecause comparisons are so easy\nto make in our daily lives.\nWhenever you get a test back,\nstart a job or go on social media,\nit's only natural to want to look around\nand see how you measure up.\nBut when we compare ourselves to others,\nwe accidentally diminish our own success.\nWe all have different likes and dislikes,\nstrengths and weaknesses.\nSo to determine your success\nbased on someone else\nleaves you with a lot of room\nfor unnecessarily criticizing yourself,\nwhich more often than not\nleaves you feeling sad.\nAnd number eight, overworking themselves.\nAre you a workaholic?\nDo you spend days at a\ntime working at your desk?\nNot giving yourself enough time to rest,\nrelax and take a break\ncan actually contribute\nto chronic unhappiness.\nAccording to an article\nfrom Passport Health,\nstudies around the world\nsite overworking as a common\nprecursor to depression,\nanxiety, and unhealthy habits\nsuch as poor food choices.\nBut that's not all people\nwho overwork themselves\nare prone to more stress and burnout,\nboth of which can have\ndetrimental effect on your mood.\nWe hope we were able to\ngive you a little insight\ninto some of the habits\nthat chronically unhappy people have.\nDid you relate to any of these habits?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like\nand subscribe button\nand share it with someone who\nmight benefit from it too.\nAs always, thanks for watching\nand we'll
