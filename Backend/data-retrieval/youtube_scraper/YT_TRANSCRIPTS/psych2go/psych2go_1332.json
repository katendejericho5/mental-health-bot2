    "transcript": "[Music]\nhey psych2go family\nif we may ask a personal question\nhow's your love life\nare you currently single or perhaps\nyou're looking for a long-term\nrelationship\nalthough we hope you found that special\nsomeone we understand that generally\ndating isn't easy\ndo you think you might be hurting your\nchances at true love\nhave you had a long list of failed\nrelationships but can't seem to figure\nout where it all went wrong\nwell\nhere are 10 things that might be keeping\nyou from finding relationships that work\n1. you have cynical views about love\nwhat's that saying again once bitten\ntwice shy\nit's common for people who have been\nstung by love before to stop believing\nin the magic of romance\nyou have every right to grieve feel hurt\nand learn from the experience\nbut being stuck in your negative ways\nand dwelling on your pain resentment and\nregret is only going to close you off\nfrom new opportunities to find the one\nwho truly loves you for who you are\ntwo you said unrealistic standards\nnowadays we see so many pictures and\nposts online about couples who are\nhashtag relationship goals that it may\nstart to cloud your judgment and give\nyou unrealistically high standards\nyou might turn down great dating\nprospects or throw away a special\nconnection you had with someone just\nbecause it wasn't everything you hoped\nit would be but the truth is sometimes\nrelationships are more about being the\nright person than finding the right\nperson\nthree\nyou've set too many deal breakers\nyou have standards you know what you\nwant and that's a good thing but\nexpecting too much of your potential\npartners too fast sets the scene for\nfailure and disappointment are you so\nquick to call it quits and run away at\nthe first sign of imperfection\njust as you deserve a fair chance so do\nthey\nin the end relationships take time and\neffort and sometimes those flaws make\nthis person uniquely tailored for your\nrelationship\nit's in the complete acceptance of an\nimperfect person that we find the kind\nof love that's meant to last 4. you have\nunresolved past trauma\nwhether it's a messy breakup a toxic\nrelationship or an unhappy childhood\nyour past can leave you with loads of\npainful memories and emotional scars\nthat you often never really get over you\nend up carrying that trauma with you\nthroughout your life unknowingly\nallowing it to ruin your relationships\nresolution acceptance and being at peace\nwith your past will not only negate most\nof the detrimental effects but also help\nyou be a better partner giving the\nrelationship its best chance to stand\nthe test of time\nfive you have low self-esteem\ni know you've heard the quote you can't\nlove someone else until you learn to\nlove yourself first\nwhen you suffer from low self-esteem\nyou tend to lose yourself and your\npartner\ninstead of developing your own sense of\nself your partner is used as a\nsubstitute\nsince you feel like you're unworthy of\ntheir love you constantly worry that\nthey'll eventually realize that and\nleave the insecurity makes this a\nself-fulfilling prophecy through things\nlike misinterpreting small actions\ncatastrophizing and constantly\nsuspecting your partner of things\nthis can be exhausting for the other\nperson and for you\nsix you have a fear of happiness\nhey don't laugh we know how it sounds\nwhy would anyone fear being happy\nwe humans are strange creatures and this\nindeed is something that happens even\nthough most of us aren't aware of it are\nyou afraid of what would happen if you\never did find the one\nso afraid that it leads you to\nsabotaging your own relationships\ndo you push people away before they can\nget too close to you because having an\nhonest emotional connection with someone\nscares you you try not to get too\nattached and suppress your desire for\nconnection so much so that others may\nmisunderstand and think you're\ninconsiderate inconsistent and not at\nall interested\n7. you have trust issues\ndo you feel jealous about your partner\nbeing close with other people does it\nmake you uncomfortable to think of them\ngoing out without you\ndo you need to read their messages and\nknow where they are all the time just to\nfeel secure\nsad to say\nnothing dooms a relationship faster than\na lack of mutual trust\nbehaving like you don't trust them will\ncause your partner to grow resentful of\nyou over time\nno one likes being constantly controlled\nand under suspicion\neight\nyou think you'll lose your independence\nby being in a relationship the rom-com\nmovies always say you complete me\nwhich isn't the healthiest of messages\nperhaps you subconsciously fear\ncommitment because you think you'll lose\nyour independence or freedom when you do\nfind a relationship\nthe truth is the opposite remember this\nin a healthy relationship you should\nnever have to sacrifice your personality\nyour independence or who you are for a\nromantic partner the hallmark of every\nstrong enduring relationship is learning\nto maintain your independence while\nstill being happily committed to someone\n9. you want someone you can't or\nshouldn't have\nmost of us are guilty of liking somebody\nagainst our better judgments probably\neven more than once whether it's because\nthey're already taken or emotionally\nunavailable it's easy to fall in love\nwith the wrong people\nobsessing over the forbidden fruit\ncloses off your ability to consider the\nmore compatible and better suited people\nfor you\nand\n10.\nyou don't learn from your mistakes\nwe all make mistakes we're only human\nbut what mistakes have you made in your\npast relationships and what have you\nlearned from them\nwhat's changed about you and how you\nlook at things because of your mistakes\nif you don't know or believe you've\nnever done anything wrong this may be\nthe most detrimental factor to your\nability to find a lasting relationship\nmistakes allow us to learn grow and be\nbetter the next time around if there's\nno learning the same mistakes occur and\nthe cycle is endless\na relationship takes more than one\nperson\nluckily enough one of those people is\nyou\nhow do you think you're doing what went\nsideways in previous relationships do\nyou relate to any of these signs in this\nvideo or perhaps you see your friend who\nhas these signs\nknowing the answers to these goes a long\nway to helping you on your quest for\nlove\nwe hope you enjoyed this video what do\nyou want to watch from us next let
