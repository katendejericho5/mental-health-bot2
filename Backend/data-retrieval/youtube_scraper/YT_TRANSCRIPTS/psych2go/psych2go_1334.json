    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, psyched goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nIf you're new here, welcome\nSex, sex, sex.\nNearly every one of us\nwill have it at some point.\nYet still, there are a lot of questions\npeople have about the topic.\nThere are also several interesting\npsychological acts about\nsex that go unnoticed.\nSimply because not many\npeople like to talk about it.\nWhat are some of those\npsychological facts you may ask?\nWell, listen up, because\nI'm about to tell you.\nHere are eight psychological\nfacts about sex.\n- Number one, some are\nwired to want more sex.\nLevels of sexual motivation vary among us.\nIn fact, a study from the\nUniversity of California,\nLos Angeles suggests\nthat the way your brain\nis uniquely wired may influence\nhow many sexual partners you will have.\nIn the study, researchers had subjects\nview images while performing brain scans.\nSome of the photographs\nwere sexually suggestive.\nResearchers then asked subjects,\nsexual behaviors within the past year.\nThose who had more sexual partners\nshowed more activity in their brains\nwhen viewing sexual images.\nNumber two, lower cholesterol\ncan boost performance.\nA 2014 study from researchers\nat Rutgers University's\nRoberts Wood Johnson Medical School\nfound that men who take statins\nor other medications to lower cholesterol\ncan often notice an improvement\nin their sexual function.\nThis does not mean you should\ntake these medications simply\nfor that purpose,\nbut keep our cholesterol in\ncheck because high cholesterol\nlevels can often contribute\nto erectile dysfunction.\nNumber three, men are\nwired to pay attention\nto their partner during sex\nand want them to orgasm.\nMaybe you've heard different,\nbut men are hardwired to pay\nspecial attention to\ntheir partner during sex,\naccording to neuroscientists.\nYou don't say.\nSuspicion and distrust can be aroused\nin a man when their partner\nis not responsive or engaged during sex,\naccording to neuroscientists,\nNumber four, men often\nfeel pressured to have\nsex quickly in a relationship.\n- Several studies have suggested\nmen aren't as obsessed with sex\nas the media suggests.\nA recent survey found that 56% of men\nsaid that they felt relieved\nwhen female partners\nexpressed their desire\nto wait to have sex.\nand 21% of men aged 15\nto 21 felt pressured\nto go further sexually than\nthey felt comfortable with.\nNumber five,\nbirth control can influence\na woman's attraction\ntowards certain types of men.\nFascinating research shows\nthat when females take\nhormonal contraceptives,\nthey show less attraction\ntowards those men\nwith masculine, physical characteristics\nand high testosterone levels.\nA Scottish study in 2012,\nfound women were less likely to separate\nfrom their partner and\nwere more financially\nsatisfied while on a birth control pill,\nthan those who weren't.\nThey also found that if a woman\nmet their partner while on the pill,\nthey would be less\nsexually attracted to them\nand not as sexually satisfied compared\nto if they were not on\nthe birth control pill.\nNumber six, sexual attraction\nis affected by ovulation.\nYou may just appear more attractive\ndepending on if you're ovulating,\naccording to several studies.\nOne study showed that men found the faces\nof women who were\novulating more attractive.\nAnother had men rate armpit odors\nfrom women at different stages\nof their menstrual cycle.\nThey found the most attractive scent\nto men in the study was\nwhen a woman was ovulating.\nFurther research has\nsuggested fertile women\npossess a stronger\nattraction to alpha males\nwhen they're ovulating\nand men find ovulation\nas an aphrodisiac\nNumber seven,\nmost Americans have an STD.\nNot so fun stat here.\nOver two thirds of healthy American adults\nare infected with at least one\nor more strains of human\npapillomavirus or HPV.\nHPV is transmitted through\nsexual intercourse and oral sex.\nThis comes from a 2014\nstudy where researchers\nat NYU Langone Medical center\ntested 104 men and women.\nOn a good note, only four\nout of the 104 people tested\nhad the type of HPV known to cause cancers\nand genital warts.\nAnd number eight,\nsex can take work for long term couples.\nMany people have heard that\nsexual satisfaction can diminish\nwith time in a long term relationship\nbut it actually just takes work.\nRecent research from the\nUniversity of Toronto\nrecognized that effort is required,\nif you wanna have a great sex life\nwith your long term partner.\nSo don't expect it to\nbe wonderful every time\nif you don't put in some\nwork every now and then.\nA healthy relationship with communication\nand effort can equal a\nhappy and healthy sex life.\nSo which sex facts surprised you the most?\nTell us in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share this video
