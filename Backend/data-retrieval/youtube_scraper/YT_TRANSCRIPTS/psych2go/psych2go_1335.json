    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Have you heard of gaslighting?\nIt's a popular term that\ndescribes manipulative behavior.\nGaslighting is detrimental\nto someone's mental\nand emotional health.\nEducating yourself on the signs\nof gaslighting can help you\nmaintain a protective boundary\nagainst those who may\ntry to take advantage\nof you in this way.\nIdentifying there are ill\nintent can help you minimize\na gaslighter's attempts to control you\nthrough stirring mistrust in yourself.\nHere are five signature signs\nthat what you think is\na simple disagreement\nmay actually be gaslighting.\n(soothing music)\nNumber one, they invalidate your feelings.\nIt's normal for disagreements\nto cause emotional distress\nin all parties involved.\nHowever, if you find that\nsomeone makes comments,\nsuch as, \"You're being sensitive,\"\nor, \"You're so weak,\"\nwhen you express your needs,\ntake it as a possible sign that\ngaslighting may be involved.\nGaslighters don't take your emotions\nand opinions into account\nbecause their goal is to mold reality\nto fit their needs best.\nBy convincing you that you're\nthe problem instead of them,\nthey get rid of the need\nto take accountability\nfor their own misbehaviors or flaws.\nWhen facing a gaslighter who\ninvalidates your feelings,\nremember first and foremost\nthat your feelings are valid.\nRecognize that your capacity to identify\nand speak out about your\nemotional needs is a sign\nof emotional intelligence.\nStick to your truth.\nNumber two, they make\nyou question yourself\nand your sanity.\nDisagreements have the potential for good.\nThey can help us shift our perspective\nand broaden what might have been a narrow\nand limiting thought process for you.\nA gaslighter, however,\nwill not only leave you worse off\nbut will create feelings\nof self doubt within you\nthat lingers long after\nthe conversation is over.\nNotice how you feel\nafter the conversation.\nDo you feel you have more clarity,\nor do you feel less sure of yourself\nand the situation as a whole?\nGaslighters can manipulate\nyour perception of yourself\nby intentionally making hurtful remarks\nabout your intelligence,\nmemory capabilities, or competence,\nwhich then allows them to brainwash you\ninto thinking their\nperception is more accurate.\nPut a stop to it by either\ndisengaging entirely\nor by refusing to react to their words\nand maintaining a strong sense of self.\nNumber three, they intend\nto make you feel small.\nGoing into a disagreement with a goal\nof gaining a better understanding\nor finding clarity can often\nbenefit a relationship.\nOn the other hand,\na gaslighter's trademark purpose\nis to make you feel small,\nundervalued, and alone.\nYou'll find that their\nwords and phrases are used\nin malicious ways that can benefit them\nby keeping you mentally\nwhere they want you to be\nand bringing gradual harm to you\nboth mentally and emotionally.\nGaining the upper hand in a conversation\nwith a gaslighter starts by\nunderstanding their behavior\nfrom their point of view.\nIn knowing their goals and intentions,\nyou're more quickly able\nto divert the discussion\nand protect yourself.\nNumber four, they don't\ntake responsibility\nfor their words and actions.\nAfter a disagreement,\nit's not uncommon for\nthere to be apologies\nand accountability taken on the side\nof all parties involved.\nGaslighters are the exception.\nInstead of taking responsibility\nfor ways they've hurt you\nor admitting to their faults,\nthey're more likely to\nlie and make statements,\nsuch as, \"I've never said that before,\"\nor, \"Your memory is terrible,\nI've never done that.\"\nIt may be difficult to\nrefute a gaslighter's lies\nwhen they appear,\nbut it's important to\nnot allow their attempts\nto skew your sense of reality to succeed.\nIf you're able to discredit them vocally,\ndo so with a sense of conviction.\nIf not, keep in mind\nthat the most important\nthing is to salvage\nyour mental well-being\nand choose to move on\neven if this means not\ngetting the apologies\nor fairness you deserve.\nAnd number five,\nyou feel anxious about\ninteracting with them.\nIf a relationship is strained enough,\nyou may both begin to feel tense\nat the thought of\ninteracting with one another.\nBut if you start to find yourself walking\non eggshells around a particular person,\nconsider that it might\nbe because of the way\nthey purposefully make you\nfeel negative about yourself\nwhen you talk to them.\nThese manipulative tendencies\nin someone else can cause you to want\nas little interaction\nwith them as possible.\nYet this can be difficult to do,\nespecially if the person\nplays a big role in your life,\nfor example, a partner,\na close friend, a family member,\nor someone at work or school.\nThink about how your gaslighter\nhas negatively influenced you in the past,\nand write down ways in which\nyou had responded instead.\nAlso remember that not all discomfort\nis because of gaslighting,\nthose uncomfortable feelings could be due\nto other reasons.\nSo did you find yourself relating\nto any of the things we've mentioned here?\nAt the end of the day,\nyou're not responsible for\nthe behaviors of a gaslighter\nno matter how much they may\ntry to make you believe so.\nIt's not up to you to make\nthem change their ways.\nAnd their inability or unwillingness\nto do so is not a reflection\nof your worth as a person.\nIf you or anyone else\nyou know is struggling\nwith mental and emotional well-being,\nplease seek help and talk\nto a mental healthcare professional today.\nGetting in touch with the right person\ncan be a great first step\nto getting back on track.\nWhat are some things you've learned?\nWhat's something you\nwish to learn more about?\nWhat has been your experience?\nWrite them down in the comments.\nAnd as always,\nthank you so much for watching.\nWe'll see you in our next video.\n(soothing music)"
