    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hi,\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nAmerican journalist Mignon\nMcLaughlin once said,\n\"A successful marriage requires\nfalling in love many times,\nalways with the same person.\"\nBut even if you're not\nthinking of settling down\nand tying the knot with someone just yet,\nit's always worth\nwondering where it's going\nand how long it's going to last.\nLuckily for you,\npsychologists have been\nuncovering the secrets\nto successful romantic\nrelationships for decades\nand figuring out what works\nbest and what doesn't.\nSo with that said, here are\neight early but good signs\nyour relationship is built to last.\nNumber one, you can\ncommunicate through conflict.\nBeing in a relationship isn't always easy.\nAnd the truth is, no matter\nhow compatible you are\nwith someone, you're bound to experience\nsome conflict with them sooner or later.\nHowever, how you handle this conflict\nas a couple speaks volumes\nabout the strength of your relationship.\nGood communication,\ncharacterized by empathy,\nhonesty, and mutual respect,\nis key to effectively\nworking out any disagreement,\nno matter how divided you\nmight be on the matter.\nAnd if you can communicate\nwith each other effectively\nthrough your conflict,\nthen you can be sure your relationship\nwill stand the test of time.\nNumber two, you share\ndecision-making and power.\nAnother sure sign your relationship\nhas a bright future ahead of\nit is if you and your partner\nhave a balanced power dynamic between you.\nThat is to say, no one is\nmore dominant or controlling\nbecause you both value each\nother's input and opinions.\nSo everyone gets a say.\nYou both know how and when to compromise,\nand you're able to talk to each other\nwhen making important decisions.\nThis also shows that you're both mindful\nof how your actions affect each other\nand are considerate with\neach other's feelings.\nNumber three, you think\nin terms of we and us.\nSimilar to the last point,\nyou know your relationship is going strong\nif you stopped thinking\nin terms of just I or me\nand start focusing more on us and we.\nWhat would your partner think about this?\nOr how would they feel if you did that?\nWhat do you think they would\nhave to say about this?\nAnd how are they affected by that?\nAsking yourself these\nkinds of questions shows\nthat you really feel your\npartner is here to stay,\nand being with them has\nhelped you move past\nyour once self-focused and\nself-serving way of thinking.\nNumber four, you completely\ntrust one another.\nDo you need to know where they are\nand who they're with all the time?\nWhile other couples\nmight have to do things\nlike go through each other's phones\nor forbid each other from\nseeing certain people,\nyou and your partner\ndon't really feel the need\nto do any of that.\nInstead you are secure in the knowledge\nthat neither one of you\nwould ever do anything\nto jeopardize what you have.\nYou trust their judgment and\nthe purity of their intentions,\nand receive their trust in return.\nNumber five, you accept\neach other for who you are.\nDo you feel comfortable being your truest\nand most open self around your partner?\nDo they feel the same way about you?\nAnother sign your relationship will last\nis when there's no longer any\npretense between you anymore.\nNo need to hide things about yourself\nor act a certain way around them\nbecause they've seen your struggles,\nknow all your flaws, and\nlove you in spite of it all.\nYou're able to tell\nthem what's on your mind\nand express yourself freely,\nin a way you never could\naround other people.\nWith them, there's no fear of\njudgment or misunderstanding.\nNumber six, you share the\nsame values and ideals.\nWhile it's true that having\na lot in common helps\nto keep the romantic spark alive,\nthe importance of having\nsimilar core values\nruns deeper than that.\nIt's the glue that holds\nall successful relationships together.\nThis is because sharing the same values\nas your partner means that\nwhile you might not always\nsee eye to eye on things,\nat least you know that\nyou want the same things\nand that your paths in life are guided\nby the same principles.\nIt also allows you to connect\nwith them on a deeper level\nand have an easier time\nunderstanding their point of view.\nNumber seven, you make\nsacrifices for each other.\nAre you willing to give up\ncertain things for them?\nMaking the necessary sacrifices\nfor the sake of your\nrelationship is essential\nto keeping it happy and healthy.\nBecause more than any grand gesture,\nlavish gift, or a solemn promise,\nthe willingness to\nsacrifice your time, energy,\nand other small comforts\nfor the sake of your partner\nshows how deeply you care about them\nand how committed you\nare to your relationship.\nAfter all, when two people\nare able to set aside\ntheir own selfish, immediate desires\nto care for the other, you know\nthey truly love each other.\nAnd number eight, you make\neach other better people.\nDo you feel like you\nand your partner make\neach other better people?\nA good sign your relationship\nwill last is when you like\nwho you are when you're with them.\nTheir unconditional love\nand support makes you wanna\nbe the best possible version\nof yourself you can be.\nYou grow and change for the better,\nnot because you feel you're\nnot good enough for them,\nbut because you wanna be the person\nthey already believe you to be.\nDo you think your relationship\nwill last forever?\nLet us know
