    "transcript": "(paper scribbling)\n(upbeat music)\n(bell rings)\n- [Instructor] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nThis topic was actually\nsuggested by one of our viewers.\nIf you have topic ideas,\ncomment them down below.\nHas anyone ever called you antisocial\njust because you decline to\nengage in social interactions?\nThat's not the correct use of the term.\nSo how should one refer to introverts?\nContinue watching this video to find out.\nHere are a few major differences\nbetween introverts and antisocial people.\nNumber one, the term\nantisocial versus asocial.\nMany people often refer\nto someone as antisocial\nwhen they decline to engage\nin social interactions\nbut that's not the correct term.\nAccording to American\nPsychological Association,\nantisocial refers to denoting\nor exhibiting behavior\nthat sharply deviates from social norms\nand also violates other people's rights.\nSo how should one refer to in introverts?\nWe should refer to them as asocial.\nAsocial refers to declining to engage\nor incapable of engaging\nin social interaction.\nNumber two, how they\nact in a social setting.\nA common misconception that we have\nis that introverts are\npeople who like to be alone.\nBut the truth is introverts\ndon't really mind company.\nIntroverts tend to have\none or two close friends\ninstead of a large social circle\nand get drained by too\nmuch social interaction.\nWhat separates introverts from extroverts\nis that after a long\nweekend of socializing,\nan introvert needs time\nto recharge on their own.\nAn antisocial person\nmay attend a party too\nand can be witty, charming,\nand fun to be around.\nHowever, they may have low or no regard\nfor right or wrong.\nThey're often antagonistic and\nfrequently act insensitively.\nThey may also resort to\nlying and exploiting others\nbehaving violently or impulsively\nand having problems with\ndrug and alcohol use.\nNumber three, their feelings.\nA study conducted by the\nUniversity of North Carolina\nshowed that introverts\nare more likely to be\ndiagnosed with depression.\nWhy introverts don't report\nhigher levels of happiness\nis unclear, but it could have a lot\nto do with how introverts\nevaluate happiness.\nIntroverts value higher\nquality friendships\nand better emotional stability.\nIt can be tough\nto maintain such a high degree\nof satisfaction all the time.\nIndividuals with antisocial\npersonality disorder\nexperience negative feelings\noften than positive feelings.\nRecent studies have found\nthat individuals with ASPD\nare able to feel anger and rage\nbut are unable to experience\nfear and dissatisfaction.\nNumber four, introverts\nand antisocial people\nhave very different personality traits.\nIntroverts need quiet to concentrate.\nThey're reflective and self-aware,\nthey take time making decisions\nand feel comfortable being alone.\nThey prefer writing over\ntalking and daydream\nor use their imaginations\nto work out a problem\nand retreat into their own mind to rest.\nThose with antisocial personality disorder\nmay begin to show symptoms in childhood\nbut the condition can't be diagnosed\nuntil adolescences or adulthood.\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic,\nantisocial people may be\nphysically aggressive,\nbehave recklessly, blame\nothers for their problems,\nmanipulate or deceive\nothers, destroy property,\nand show little to no\nremorse for hurtful actions.\nNumber five, causes.\nEveryone's personality\ncomprises a unique\ncombination of behaviors\nthat programs how people see, comprehend,\nand relate to the world around them.\nPersonality emerges during childhood\nmolded by a combination of genetic traits\nand environmental influences.\nThe actual cause of antisocial\npersonality disorder\nis unknown but genetics may\npredispose you to the illness\nand life events may trigger it.\nIt's also believed that\nduring brain development,\nchanges in the functioning of\nthe brain may have occurred.\nScientists are unsure whether introversion\nor extroversion has an exact cause.\nHowever, what they do know\nis that brains of the\ntwo personality types\noperate in some what different ways.\nIntroverts have more blood\nflow to the frontal lobe\nthan extroverts.\nThis area of the brain aids with memory,\nproblem solving and planning.\nAnd number six, relationships.\nIntroverts are perfectly capable\nof having healthy, meaningful\nrelationships with others.\nIntroverts tend to have\nclose relationships\nwith a small group of people.\nThe individuals they care\nabout get to know them well\nand form genuine connections with them.\nEven though they only have a few friends,\nit doesn't mean that they're\nsocially inept in any way.\nIt's simply a matter\nof personal preference.\nAnd those with ASPD,\nthe condition can be harmful\nto the affected person\nas well as anyone who\ncomes in contact with them.\nRisk-taking behaviors, harmful activities,\nand criminal acts are more common\nin people with antisocial\npersonality disorder.\nThose suffering from the condition\nare sometimes described\nas having no conscience\nand feeling of guilt for\ntheir detrimental deeds.\nThis may make it hard for them\nto maintain healthy relationships.\nSo, did this video help you understand\nthe difference between\nantisocial people and introverts?\nWe hope you've learned about\nthe difference between them\neven though we often lump\nboth into the same category.\nPlease like and share with friends\nthat might find value\nin this video as well.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go,\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the references used\nare added in the description box below.\nThank you for watching
