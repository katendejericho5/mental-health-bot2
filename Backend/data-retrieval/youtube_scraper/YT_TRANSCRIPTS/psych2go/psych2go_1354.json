    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Go-ers.\nThank you for your support\nand welcome back to\nanother brand new video.\nIs there someone around you\nwho has been acting strange lately?\nPerhaps they've been\nmore quiet than usual,\nor maybe they've been\nlashing out at everyone\nwho hangs out with them?\nWell, one reason that may\nbe affecting their behavior\ncould be that they're feeling down,\nbut don't want to or have trouble\nwith expressing their sadness.\nSo if you're worried about\nyour friend or loved one,\nhere are six signs that they\nmay be secretly feeling down.\nNumber one, they often\nput themselves down.\nEveryone experiences self-doubt sometimes,\nwhether it's shying away\nfrom social interactions,\nrefusing to take on an important role,\nor feeling a general lack of confidence.\nPeople may put themselves down\nas a form of defense mechanism,\nso if you see someone\nbeing really critical\nand harsh on themselves\non a regular basis,\nyou may want to check in on them\nand ask how their day,\nweek, or month has been.\nPerhaps there's a distinct reason\nbehind their self-depreciation,\none which they have been waiting to share.\nNumber two, they're often moody.\nDoes your friend lash\nout at you for no reason?\nSometimes people may\nbecome irrationally upset\nat trivial matters because they feel down.\nAlthough it's easier said than done,\ntry not to take it personally\nand understand the true\ncause of their emotions.\nConversations that start with\n\"can you tell me how\nyou're feeling lately?\"\nor \"please let me know\nif something's wrong\"\nmay help invite those you care about\nto open up about their hidden issues.\nEven if they start venting at you,\njust by speaking out their thoughts,\nthey're likely to move on\nfrom their negative emotions faster.\nNumber three, they lose interest easily.\nDo you know someone\nwho's always nonchalant about everything?\nLosing and gaining\ninspiration is a natural part\nof human behavior\nand some may feel more confident\non certain days more than others.\nHowever, if you notice someone\ncanceling all their plans\nor refusing to try anything new\nand they tend to just display\nan unusual amount of carelessness,\nthey may have given up\nthe act of seeking joy\nand passion in life.\nThis may be because they're\ntrying to suppress their sadness\nor are spending most of their time\ntrying to combat their own\nnegative thoughts and emotions.\nNumber four, they stay quiet.\nHave you noticed you're usually-talkative\nand open friend behaving\nvery quietly lately?\nThis change in how they act may be a sign\nthat they're secretly feeling down.\nTheir behavior to not speak\nmay be because they're trying\nto keep their brewing\nissues within themselves.\nAfter all, staying quiet can be seen\nas a natural defense mechanism\nfor those who are experiencing\nsadness or even depression.\nAgain, if there are severe\nsymptoms up the ladder,\nplease seek a health\nprofessional immediately.\nNumber five, they're constantly anxious.\nWhile sadness doesn't\nnecessarily cause anxiety,\nthe two emotions do often relate.\nSome of the signs of anxiety\nto look for are restlessness,\nfast breathing, heavy sweating,\nand constant trembling.\nThere might be something\nthat they truly fear,\nwhich can lead to other negative emotions\nand cause them to become really upset.\nIn these cases, it's good to let them know\nthat you care about their wellbeing\nand will be there to listen.\nWith your support,\nit's more likely that they'll\nfeel comfortable with you\nto open up about some of the\nissues that they may be facing.\nAnd number six, they lack sleep.\nHave you ever gone to bed,\nonly to be bombarded with a\nstream of intrusive thoughts\nthat keep you awake?\nUnwanted troubling thoughts often occur\nafter experiencing traumatic events\nor even a stressful day.\nWhen your mind learns that\nyou're in a safe place,\nthose intrusive thoughts\ntend to resurface.\nTherefore people who\nare secretly feeling sad\nmay experience a lot of\nrestlessness and inconsistent sleep.\nYou might want to check in\non your coworker or friend\nif you hear them talking\nabout having constant problems\ngetting a good night's rest.\nSo do you know someone who\nshows any of these signs\nthat we've mentioned?\nIf you know someone\nwho displays all of the\nabove symptoms and more,\nit may be wise to consult\na mental health specialist,\nsuch as a therapist or a psychologist,\nto check if they're depressed.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like and share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell icon to get notified\nwhenever Psych2Go post a new video.\nThe references and studies\nused in this video are added\nin the description below.\nThanks so much for watching\nand we'll see you in the next one."
