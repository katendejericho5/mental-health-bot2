    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nDo you have a crush or\nfeelings for someone?\nHow can you tell if what you're feeling\nis love or infatuation.\nOver time, a simple crash can\ndevelop into new territory,\nsomething between a\ncrash, but not yet love.\nSo what's the difference\nbetween love and a crush?\nLet's find out.\nOne, how long did it take\nyou to develop feelings?\nTypically, crushes start and end quickly.\nIn the initial stage,\nyou go through a period of idealization\nwhere your crush seems perfect.\nWhen you develop a crush on someone,\nyour brain releases\ndopamine and norepinephrine,\ntwo neuro chemicals\ndesigned to create bonds.\nThese two chemicals are\nresponsible for the sweaty palms,\nfast heart rate and giddy\nfeeling you experience\nwhenever you're crush texts you back.\nHowever, this period\ndoes not last very long.\nSo if those feelings\nmature after some time,\nthen there's a chance that\nit could develop into love.\nTwo, do you idealize the person?\nAnother way to differentiate\nbetween a crush and love\nis to ask yourself whether you\nidealize that person or not.\nIdealizing your prospective partner\nis not uncommon during the initial stages,\nbut when you fall in love with someone,\nyou look beyond those qualities\nand you no longer think in\nterms of perfect or flawless.\nYou learn to love and\nappreciate your partner\nfor who they are, including their flaws.\nThree, is your attraction just physical?\nDid your feelings for them develop solely\nbased on their physical appearance\nor the way they act around others?\nThis relationship will\nmainly be a physical one\nsince you both hardly know each other.\nYou might find yourself fussing\nover your appearance too.\nHowever, when you're in love,\nyou feel comfortable in your skin\nbecause your partner\nknows and accepts you.\nFour, do your feelings change?\nDo your feelings grow\nstronger and weaker over time?\nWhen you're in love with someone,\nyour feelings for them\ndon't disappear, they grow.\nFive, is your relationship\nfocused on desire or friendship?\nBecause crushes are rooted\nin physical appearance,\nthe relationship might only\nfocus on attraction or desire.\nYou may have completely\ndifferent personalities,\nvalues, or tastes, but you\nare attracted to each other.\nWhile attraction is\nnecessary to fall in love,\nit's not the foundation that\nbuilds lasting relationships.\nWhat creates a lasting relationship\nare common values, goals, and interests.\nIt takes time to be in love with someone.\nSo did you relate to any of these signs?\nAlong with everything we mentioned,\nthe most important indicator\nbetween crushing on someone\nand falling in love with them is time.\nWhile you will still feel butterflies\nduring the initial stages\nof your relationship,\ncrushes can mature and blossom\ninto true love over time.\nDid you enjoy this video?\nFeel free to share some of your crushes\nto true love experiences\nin the comments below.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the references used\nare added in the description box below.\nThank you for watching.\nSee you next time."
