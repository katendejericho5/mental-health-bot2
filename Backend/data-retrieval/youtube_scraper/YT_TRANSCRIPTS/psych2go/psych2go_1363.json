    "transcript": "(gentle music)\n- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nDo you ever look at someone\nand wonder what is going\non inside their head?\nMm, familiar thought?\nI'm guessing you've thought that before,\nbut more importantly, what's\ngoing on with our brains?\nHow do they work?\nThere are quite a few surprising facts\nabout our brains and how they work.\nSo to partially answer your question,\nhere are just a few things\ngoing on inside our heads.\n(yawns) Number one, your brain\nis more creative when you're tired.\nSuddenly it all makes sense now.\nThose late hours working\non your math homework,\nand all you wanna do is\nwrite poetry, or draw,\nor daydream profusely\nabout your celebrity crush.\nOur brain works more\ncreatively when we're tired,\nmeaning if you're a morning person,\nget your most demanding\nanalytical work done\nwhile you're refreshed and awake.\nWhen it comes to writing\nyour thoughts in your journal\nor creating fan art, it's\nmighty fine to go ahead\nand create it when you're a little tired.\nNumber two, you can change\nyour perception of time\nby doing new things, say what?\nYeah, turns out our sense of\ntime can feel slower depending\non the information our brains take in.\nWhen our brains receive new information,\nit has to organize it in a\nway that makes sense to us.\nThen we perceive it.\nSo our sense of time is influenced\nby how our brain presents\ncertain information.\nWhen our brains receive\ninformation that's familiar,\nprocessing that information\ndoesn't take as much time,\nbut when we receive new information,\nour brains take longer\norganizing and processing it.\nSo our perception of time is altered.\nThe longer the process,\nthe longer time will feel.\nUnlike our five senses,\nwhich are focused in a\nsingle area of the brain,\nmultiple regions of the brain\ncontrol our time perception.\nWhen we're in a\nlife-threatening situation,\nour sense of time is longer\ndue to focused attention.\nAnd because we record more\nof what we experience,\nwhen your favorite song\nplays, time seems to slow down\ndue to our greater\nattention to what we love.\nNumber three, stress can\nchange the size of your brain.\nStress can have a huge\nimpact on our brains.\nOur changes in brain\nfunction are most commonly\ndue to stress.\nStress has such an impact on us\nthat it can even change\nthe size of our brain.\nOne study used baby monkeys\nto determine the effects of stress\non development and mental health.\nHalf of the monkeys in the research\nwere looked after by their peers,\nwhile the other half\nstayed with their mothers.\nAfterwards, the monkeys\nreturned to normal social groups\nbefore researchers scanned\nthe monkeys' brains.\nEven though all the monkeys\nwere returned to normal\nenvironments afterwards,\nthe monkeys who were taken\naway from their mothers\nhad the areas of their brains\nrelated to stress, enlarged.\nIn another study conducted on rats exposed\nto chronic stress, it\nfound that the hippocampus\nin their brains, shrank.\nNumber four, brain activity\ncan power a light bulb.\nOur brains are quite powerful,\nso much so that they can generate 12\nto 25 Watts of electricity.\nThat's enough to power a small light bulb.\nAlso using glucose for energy,\nthe information traveling\nfrom our arms and legs\nto our brains move at the speed\nof 150 to 260 miles per hour.\nNumber five, your brain\nrepeats thousands of thoughts.\nAccording to research, the average human\nhas about 12,000 to\n60,000 thoughts every day.\n95% of them are the exact\nsame repetitive thoughts we\nhad the day before.\nAnd unfortunately, 80% of\nthem are negative, uh-oh.\nI mean, interesting.\nNumber six, short-term\nmemory last 20 to 30 seconds.\nOur active mind can\nonly hold small amounts\nof information for so long,\nspecifically our short-term memory lasts\nabout 20 to 30 seconds.\nMost brains can hold onto\nthe memory of numbers\nfor seven seconds, while\nletters last about nine seconds.\nAlso ever wonder why the\nU.S. telephone numbers\nare only seven digits?\nIt's because the brain can\nstore up to seven digits\nin its working memory.\nNumber seven, humans don't\nonly use 10% of their brain.\nYou may have heard this myth\nand it's completely wrong.\nHumans don't use just 10% of their brains.\nWhen sleeping, we even use more than 10%.\nSo while it's nice to imagine you\ncould have super human powers\nif you reached maximum capacity\nof your brain's percentage,\nit's simply a myth.\nNumber eight, some headaches\nare a result of chemical levels changing.\nDid you know that the chemical serotonin\nis needed to communicate\nbetween nerve cells?\nSometimes when serotonin\nor estrogen levels\nin our bodies change,\nthey can result in a painful\nmigraine or headache.\nThe nerves and blood\nvessels around your skull\ncan very well affect how\noften you get a headache.\nFor some, it may just take a\nchange in serotonin levels.\nNumber nine, it is\nimpossible to multitask.\nSo you're a multi-tasker, huh?\nI'm sorry, my friend,\nbut that's impossible.\nWhat's really going on in our\nbrains is context switching\nfrom one task to another,\nwhich isn't the best thing.\nResearch has shown your\nerror rate goes up 50%,\ntaking you to double the\ntime to complete your tasks.\nNumber 10, naps improve\nour brain's performance.\nSleep, we all needed in order to function.\nBut research has shown specifically naps\ncan be useful in other ways.\nResearch shows naps helps\nsolidify your memories\nand improve your learning.\nWhen you're asleep,\nthe left side of your brain gets to relax,\nwhile the right side organizes\nand stores memories throughout your day.\nSo if you've just studied\nfor your big history exam,\nit's not a bad idea to\ntake a quick nap before.\n11, introverts and extroverts\nhave different brain wiring.\nTurns out being\nintroverted and extroverted\nis related to how your brain recharges.\nResearch has shown that\nthere's a difference\nbetween the brains of\nextroverts and introverts.\nOne strong difference\nis that extroverts' brains respond more\nwhen a gamble pays off.\nThis is partly due to the difference\nin their dopamine system.\nAnd number 12, sleep\ndeprivation kills brain cells.\nRemember how sleep is\nvital to memory retention?\nYeah, not getting enough sleep\ncan lead to not only your\nmemory being impaired,\nbut your judgment and reaction\ntime can also be affected.\nThis is likely due to the\nfact that, I don't know,\nsleep deprivation can kill brain cells.\nSo yeah, watching this video\nat night, after the video,\ndo me a favor and go to sleep.\nAnd if you're yawning (yawns),\nresearch suggests yawning is a way\nto cool down your brain, from what?\nYup, sleep deprivation raises\nthe temperature of your brain.\nSo when you feel a yawn coming on,\ntrust the yawn, my friend, trust the yawn.\nSo what brain fact surprised you the most?\nDid you learn something new?\nTell us in the comments down below.\nAre you watching this\nat 2:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m.?\nMm, it's that's time to cool down\nand get some rest, sleep tight.\nIf you
