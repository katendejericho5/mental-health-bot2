    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back.\nDo you sometimes wish you\nhad a different family?\nAlthough, every family has its problems.\nIn a healthy home,\nthose problems can be overcome.\nBut if there's a\ndysfunctional family dynamic,\nevery new day brings a\ndifferent set of challenges.\nTo help you recognize the signs\nof a dysfunctional family dynamic,\nhere are some of the most common ones.\nNumber one, fear.\nHave you ever tried to hide\nsomething from your parents?\nMaybe a bad grade or a broken vase?\nDiscipline is important.\nAnd sometimes parents\nmay raise their voices.\nSometimes when kids make mistakes,\nsome consequences are needed.\nIf a child breaks the vase,\nthey'd have to clean the mess.\nIf they get a bad grade,\nthey'd have to spend extra time studying.\nThese are not examples\nof extremely bad things,\nbut some parents act\nlike every little mistake is terrible.\nLike screaming at their children,\ntaking away their things,\nforbidding them from seeing their friends\nor even physically punishing them.\nWhen this happens,\nchildren learn to fear their parents,\neven for mundane things.\nSo they feel like they need\nto do everything perfectly.\nSometimes the fear is so great\nthey may even run away from home\nbecause of fear of\ntheir parents' reaction.\nNumber two, codependency.\nA codependent parent has\nan unhealthy preoccupation\nwith their children\nthat makes them excessively\ncontrol their children's lives.\nThey may feel like their\nhappiness and stability\ndepends on their children\nor that their kids are responsible\nfor their health and overall wellbeing.\nThey may take care of their children,\neven with things they\nshould let their kids do\nin order to grow and learn\nlike cleaning their rooms,\neven if they're teenagers.\nThey consider their\nchildren their only friends\nand may rarely hang out with other adults.\nThey may also use guilt\ntripping and gaslighting\nto manipulate their kids\ninto doing what they want them to do.\nThis type of behavior\ncan negatively impact\ntheir kids' personality and identity,\nsince children see their\nparents as role models\nand learn about the world\nbased on the behavior\ntheir parents exhibit.\nSo they become dependent\non their parents too,\nmaking the relationship unhealthy.\nNumber three, neglect.\nNeglect is another common sign\nthat a family dynamic\nis not the healthiest.\nIt's a type of abuse.\nParents from dysfunctional families\noften fail to take care\nof their children as they should,\nsuch as washing their clothes\nor making sure their\nhair is clean and combed.\nThey don't help their kids with homework.\nAnd often don't even know\nif they go to school regularly.\nSometimes they may not even notice\nif their kids have eaten,\nthe neglect can negatively impact\ntheir children's mental\nhealth and physical health,\nwhich is dangerous for their development.\nNumber four, silence.\nIn dysfunctional families,\ncommunication doesn't happen very often.\nEach family member might be\nclosed off in their rooms,\ndoing their own thing,\nand don't even open up to each other\nor ask for advice.\nThey don't tell each other about their day\nor something they're excited about.\nSilent treatments can also happen\nas a way to handle conflict.\nAnd it can also be used as a punishment.\nThis can be especially harmful,\nif parents use the silent treatment\nas a form of discipline\nfor their children.\nIf someone tries to break that silence\nwith honesty and openness,\nother members could\nreact by humiliating them\nfor stating their feelings\nwhile the silence continues.\nAnd number five, isolation.\nFinally, dysfunctional families tend\nto keep to each other\nand avoid letting anyone,\nincluding other family members, friends,\nor neighbors into their lives.\nThey keep their distance,\nso that the secret\nof an unhealthy family\ndynamic stays hidden.\nParents may tell their children\nthat other people are bad\nand that they should avoid them\nor make up lies about\nwhy nobody ever visits.\nThis makes it hard to receive any help\nsince their problems are\nnot visible to others.\nIs your family showing\nsome of these signs?\nIf so, it's important that\nyou take care of yourself\nand seek help from a therapist\nto help you deal with everyday life.\nAnd keep in mind,\nyou won't have to deal with\nthat environment forever.\nThere is light at the end of the tunnel.\nRemember to like and share this video\nwith friends who may benefit.\nAs always, the references are shown\nin the description below.\nUntil next time, friends.\nTake care.\n(gentle music)"
