    "transcript": "- Are you currently single,\nor perhaps you're looking\nfor a long-term relationship?\nAlthough we hope you found\nthat special someone,\nwe understand that,\ngenerally, dating isn't easy.\nDo you think you might be hurting\nyour chances at true love?\nHave you had a long list\nof failed relationships\nbut can't seem to figure\nout where it all went wrong?\nWell, here are 10 things\nthat might be keeping you\nfrom finding relationships that work.\nOne, you have cynical views about love.\nWhat's that saying again?\n\"Once bitten, twice shy.\"\nIt's common for people who\nhave been stung by love before\nto stop believing in the magic of romance.\nYou have every right to grieve, feel hurt,\nand learn from the experience.\nBut being stuck in your negative ways\nand dwelling on your pain, resentment,\nand regret is only gonna close you off\nfrom new opportunities to find the one\nwho truly loves you for who you are.\nTwo, you set unrealistic standards.\nNowadays, we see so many\npictures and posts online\nabout couples who are #relationshipgoals\nthat it may start to cloud your judgment\nand give you unrealistically\nhigh standards.\nYou might turn down great dating prospects\nor throw away a special\nconnection you had with someone\njust because it wasn't\neverything you hoped it would be.\nBut the truth is,\nsometimes relationships are more about\nbeing the right person than\nfinding the right person.\nThree, you've set too many deal breakers.\nYou have standards,\nyou know what you want,\nand that's a good thing.\nBut expecting too much of your\npotential partners too fast\nsets the scene for failure\nand disappointment.\nAre you so quick to call it quits\nand run away at the first\nsign of imperfection?\nJust as you deserve a\nfair chance, so do they.\nIn the end, relationships\ntake time and effort,\nand sometimes those flaws make\nthis person uniquely tailored\nfor your relationship.\nIt's in the complete acceptance\nof an imperfect person\nthat we find the kind of\nlove that's meant to last.\nFour, when you have\nunresolved past trauma.\nWhether it's a messy breakup,\na toxic relationship,\nor an unhappy childhood,\nyour past can leave you with\nloads of painful memories\nand emotional scars that you\noften never really get over.\nYou end up carrying that trauma with you\nthroughout your life,\nunknowingly allowing it to\nruin your relationships.\nResolution, acceptance, and\nbeing at peace with your past\nwill not only negate most\nof the detrimental effects,\nbut also help you be a better partner,\ngiving the relationship its best chance\nto stand the test of time.\nFive, you have low self-esteem.\nI know you've heard the quote,\n\"You can't love someone else\nuntil you learn to love yourself first.\"\nWhen you suffer from low self-esteem,\nyou tend to lose yourself in your partner.\nInstead of developing\nyour own sense of self,\nyour partner is used as a substitute.\nSince you feel like you're\nunworthy of their love,\nyou constantly worry\nthat they'll eventually\nrealize that and leave.\nThe insecurity makes this\na self-fulfilling prophecy,\nthrough things like\nmisinterpreting small actions,\ncatastrophizing, and constantly suspecting\nyour partner of things.\nThis can be exhausting for\nthe other person and for you.\nSix, you have a fear of happiness.\nHey, don't laugh, we know how it sounds.\nWhy would anyone fear being happy?\nWe humans are strange creatures,\nand this indeed is something that happens,\neven though most of us aren't aware of it.\nAre you afraid of what would happen\nif you ever did find the one?\nSo afraid that it leads you\nto sabotaging your own relationships?\nDo you push people away\nbefore they can get too close to you,\nbecause having an honest,\nemotional connection\nwith someone scares you?\nYou try not to get too attached\nand suppress your desire\nfor connection so much so\nthat others may misunderstand\nand think you're\ninconsiderate, inconsistent,\nand not at all interested.\nSeven, you have trust issues.\nDo you feel jealous about\nyour partner being close\nwith other people?\nDoes it make you uncomfortable\nto think of them going out without you?\nDo you need to read their messages\nand know where they are all\nthe time just to feel secure?\nSad to say, nothing dooms\na relationship faster\nthan a lack of mutual trust.\nBehaving like you don't trust them\nwill cause your partner to grow\nresentful of you over time.\nNo one likes being constantly controlled\nand under suspicion.\nEight, you think you'll\nlose your independence\nby being in a relationship.\nThe rom-com movies always say,\n\"You complete me,\" which isn't\nthe healthiest of messages.\nPerhaps you subconsciously fear commitment\nbecause you think you'll lose\nyour independence or freedom\nwhen you do find a relationship.\nThe truth is the opposite.\nRemember this, in a healthy relationship,\nyou should never have to\nsacrifice your personality,\nyour independence, or who you\nare for a romantic partner.\nThe hallmark of every\nstrong, enduring relationship\nis learning to maintain your independence\nwhile still being happily\ncommitted to someone.\nNine, you want someone you\ncan't or shouldn't have.\nMost of us are guilty of liking somebody\nagainst our better judgments,\nprobably even more than once.\nWhether it's because they're already taken\nor emotionally unavailable,\nit's easy to fall in love\nwith the wrong people.\nObsessing over the forbidden fruit\ncloses off your ability to\nconsider the more compatible\nand better suited people for you.\nAnd 10, you don't learn\nfrom your mistakes.\nWe all make mistakes.\nWe're only human.\nBut what mistakes have you\nmade in your past relationships\nand what have you learned from them?\nWhat's changed about you\nand how you look at things\nbecause of your mistakes?\nIf you don't know\nor believe you've never\ndone anything wrong,\nthis may be the most detrimental factor\nto your ability to find\na lasting relationship.\nMistakes allow us to learn, grow,\nand be better the next time around.\nIf there's no learning,\nthe same mistakes occur\nand the cycle is endless.\nA relationship takes more than one person.\nLuckily enough, one of\nthose people is you.\nHow do you think you're doing?\nWhat went sideways in\nprevious relationships?\nDo you relate to any of\nthese signs in this video?\nOr perhaps you see a\nfriend who has these signs?\nKnowing the answers to\nthese goes a long way\nto helping you on your quest for love.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nWhat do you wanna watch from us next?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nDon't forget to like and share this
