    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers\nHave you noticed your\nfriend or family member\nacting kinda strange lately?\nPerhaps they've avoided\nyour calls and messages\nor have been lashing out at\nothers for no apparent reason.\nThese sudden changes in\nbehavior might be because\nthey're struggling with\na mental health problem.\nThe stigma around mental\nhealth can sometimes\nmake people afraid to reach\nout for help or support.\nThey may be struggling\nto cope with daily life\nand have no way to voice how they feel.\nSo, to help you look out\nfor some of the signs\nthat someone may be struggling,\nhere are eight signs someone is battling\nmental health problems.\nBefore we begin,\nwe'd like to mention that this video\nis created for educational purposes only.\nDo not use information in\nthis or any other video\nto self-diagnose or diagnose other people.\nIf you feel that you\nor someone close to you\nmay possess some of the characteristics\nmentioned in this and need help,\nthen please consult a licensed\nmental health professional.\nThis video is not a substitute\nfor professional advice,\nbut for general guidance.\nNumber one, fatigue or a loss of energy.\nDo you always feel tired?\nDepression and chronic fatigue\nsyndrome are two illnesses\nthat can leave you feeling\ndrained and exhausted,\neven after a full night's rest.\nIt's easy to confuse\nexhaustion with depression\nand vice-versa,\nand also quite possible to\nexperience both conditions\nat the same time.\nWhile it's common to feel\ntired after doing an activity,\nit may become a cause for concern\nif you notice yourself\nconstantly experiencing\na loss of energy.\nNumber two, feeling detached.\nHave you been feeling\ndisconnected from yourself\nand your environment?\nSome mental illnesses are characterized by\nextreme isolation,\nabandonment of friends\nand social networks,\nand emotional detachment.\nFor some people being emotionally detached\nhelps protect them from unwanted\ndrama, anxiety, or stress.\nFor others, detachment\nmay not be voluntary.\nInstead it may be the product\nof events that prevent them\nfrom being open and truthful\nabout their feelings.\nNumber three,\nmarkedly diminished interest of pleasure\nin almost all activities.\nAre you bored or uninterested in things\nyou used to really enjoy?\nPeople who experienced anhedonia,\nwhich is the inability to feel pleasure\nin normally pleasurable activities,\nmay lose interest in the activities\nthat they used to like doing,\nand have a decreased\nability to feel pleasure.\nIt's a core symptom of\nmajor depressive disorder,\nbut it can also be a symptom of\nother mental health disorders.\nNumber four, insomnia, or\nhypersomnia, excessive sleeping.\nHow much sleep do you usually get?\nSleep and mental health\nare closely related.\nSuch that sleep deficiency can end up\nharming your mental and\nemotional wellbeing.\nPeople with mental health problems\nare more likely to have insomnia,\nor other sleep disorders.\nExcessive sleeping, sleeping too little,\nbeyond usual fatigue could\nbe some signs that indicate\nmental health illnesses.\nNumber five, sudden changes\nin mood from being joyful,\nto being irritable, angry, and hostile.\nDoes your mood change a lot?\nIs it easy for you to\nget frustrated and upset?\nExtreme mood swings,\nsuch as uncontrollable highs\nor feelings of euphoria,\nas well as irritability,\ncan be indicators of mental illness.\nYou may want to notify\na medical professional\nor seek help if you or someone you know\nare experiencing these severe\nand regular mood swings.\nNumber six, repeated actions\nor checking things many times.\nIs there a routine you have to complete\nbefore leaving the house?\nDo you experience urges\nthat you have to fulfill?\nWhether it's repeatedly checking\nwhether the gas stove is off,\nconstantly hand-washing,\nor to check if the doors are locked,\nthese obsessive thoughts\ncan sometimes be unwanted\nand done out of fear that\nsomething bad will happen\nif you don't complete the routine.\nThese compulsive rituals may\nbe a way for you to cope with\nthe anxiety or fears you may be feeling.\nNumber seven, significant\nchanges in appetite.\nHas there been a large\nchange in your eating habit,\nwhether it's having a\nsudden lack of appetite\nor the tendency to overeat?\nWhere the need to eat is\nunrelated to physical hunger,\nthese changes in appetite\nmay be an indicator\nthat you're struggling\nto cope with some anxiety\nor inner turmoil that you're experiencing.\nThose who purposefully reduce\nthe amount of food they eat\nor overwork their bodies\nbecause of a deep fear of gaining weight\nmay also suffer from mental health issues.\nAnd number eight, recurring\nthoughts of death or suicide.\nHaving suicidal thoughts is\na hallmark symptom of major depression\nand depressive episodes\nin bipolar disorder,\nand several other mental health disorders.\nSuicidal ideation may be passive,\nwhere you're frequently\nthinking about death,\nbut not acting on these thoughts,\nor aggressive, where you're\nacting on these thoughts\nor making plans to act on\nyour suicidal thoughts.\nIf you're experiencing recurring thoughts\nof death or suicide, know\nthat you're not alone.\nIt's important to seek immediate help\nand professional guidance and support.\nWe've added a list of hotlines\nin the description below.\nDid you find this video helpful?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nBe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video\nwith those
