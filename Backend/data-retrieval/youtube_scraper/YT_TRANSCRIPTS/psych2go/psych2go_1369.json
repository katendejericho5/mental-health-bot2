    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWhen you likes someone, it\ncan be an exciting experience,\nbut also a frustrating one.\nIf you're not direct about your feelings,\nyou might be wondering how\nto read between the lines\nto know if they like you back.\nThey're always polite.\nThey act friendly.\nThey start conversations,\nbut are they just being nice?\nWhat if you make a move\nand it turns out they aren't as interested\nin you as you thought?\nKnowing friendly from flirty\ncan be a difficult task,\nbut there are some subtle signs\nthat could help you understand\ntheir actions better.\nHere are seven signs that\nthey're not just being friendly.\nNumber one, they give you friendly hugs.\nIt's not unusual for friends\nto meet each other with a hug,\nbut do you think that hug between you\nlast a second too long\nto be just friendly?\nOr maybe they don't\nusually hug their friends,\nunless it's you.\nIf you noticed you're getting special\n\"hello and goodbye hugs,\"\nthen you probably mean more\nto them than just a friend.\nNumber two, they remember\neverything you say.\nDo you usually remember little details\npeople tell you about their lives?\nUnless it's something that specifically\ncaught your attention,\nyou probably wouldn't\nremember it after some time.\nSo, if they randomly remember\nwhat you said about your childhood pet\nor some similar small detail,\nit means they were paying close attention.\nAnd if they pay close attention,\nthey probably like you\nand really care about\nwhat you have to say.\nNumber three, they take\ncare of their appearance.\nOf course, when you like someone,\nyou wanna look the best you can,\nin hopes they fall for your awesome looks,\nand if someone likes you, too,\nthey tend to think the same.\nWhen they're near you,\nthey will straighten up their clothes\nor comb their hair with\ntheir fingers nervously.\nAlso, they will try to always\nwear their best clothes\nwhen they're near you.\nNumber four, they try to get near you.\nMaybe you're sitting at a table,\nand they choose the turn next to you.\nMaybe you are walking next to each other,\nand they walk so close to you\nthat your arms almost touch.\nIf you notice them always trying\nto get as close to you as possible,\nit probably means they just\ncan't get enough of you.\nNumber five, they can't\ntake their eyes off of you.\nEye contact is one of the most important\nand telling signals of\nnonverbal communication,\nespecially when it comes to attraction.\nEven if looking at someone\nwhile simply talking could\nsignify just being polite,\nstealing glances from across the room,\nor even when you're not talking\ncan tell you they're not just being nice,\nand even better if they\nturn their head quickly\nwhen you notice them staring.\nThey're too shy to let you\nsee that they like you.\nNumber six, small talk is not so small.\nWhen you're being nice to someone,\nyou probably engage in some small talk,\nespecially if you don't know them well.\n\"The weather is so nice today.\nHave you been to that new restaurant?\nDid you watch that movie last night?\"\nIt's just something you\ndo to pass the time.\nBut when someone likes you,\nsmall talk will not be enough\nfor them to know everything\nthey want to know about.\nYou they'll engage in meaningful\nconversation with you,\nasking you about your\neveryday life, your interests,\nwhat you like and what you\ndon't, how your family is like,\nand, of course, they'll sneak a question\nabout your love life.\nAnd number seven, they\nput their phone away\nunless they're texting you.\nHow often do you see people\nhanging out together,\nand instead of talking,\nthey all just look down\nat their phones?\nOr they keep checking it for notifications\nevery two minutes while you're trying\nto have a conversation?\nIf a person likes you,\nthis likely won't happen.\nThey will keep it on\nsilent or in their pocket\nand focus on you.\nBut when you're not physically together,\nthey won't be able to let\nit out of their hands.\nSending you messages,\nmusic, videos, memes,\nor funny pictures will be more important.\nSo do you think anyone in your life\ndoes any of these things?\nWere you looking for these signs\nbecause you like them back?\nIf you're interested, try to play along.\nHopefully they get encouraged\nand make a direct move,\nor you can be the one who makes the move.\nIf you found this video\nhelpful, like, and share it\nwith friends that might\nfind insight in this, too.\nRemember, to subscribe to Psych2Go,\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the sources used are added\nin the description box below,\nand thank you for\nwatching.
