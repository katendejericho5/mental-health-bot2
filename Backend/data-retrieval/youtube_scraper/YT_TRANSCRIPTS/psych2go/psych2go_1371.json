    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey there, Psych2Go fans.\nWe're back to help you understand\neveryday psychology better.\nTrauma is often the result\nof an overwhelming amount of stress\nfrom a situation that exceeds\none's ability to cope,\nsuch as the death of a loved one,\nthe end of a meaningful relationship\nor the rejection of a loved one.\nDo you pretend that everything's\ngood when it really isn't?\nWhen you don't have a positive\nand healthy way of\ndealing with your trauma,\nyou end up repressing\nyour negative emotions.\nIt can be hard to\nrecognize unresolved trauma\non the surface, especially\nwithin ourselves.\nSo here are nine signs\nyou're still suffering\nfrom unhealed trauma.\nOne, you resist positive change.\nWhen something good comes into your life,\nis your first instinct\nto be suspicious of it?\nYou have an innate\nfeeling of shame or guilt\nwhenever you allow yourself\nto grow attached to someone\nor celebrate your own success?\nIf so, you might be carrying\nunresolved trauma within you.\nYou have a hard time\naccepting positive change\nand may even try to resist it at first,\nbecause deep down inside,\nyou feel like you don't\ndeserve to be happy.\nTwo, you need to plan for everything.\nDo you have a need to stay\ncompletely in control?\nDo you feel frustrated and lost\nwhenever things don't\ngo the way you expect?\nYour need for control\nis most likely rooted\nin a traumatic experience\nthat left you feeling\nhelpless and vulnerable.\nAs a result, you micromanage everything\nand worry about the things\nthat are out of your control.\nThis shows that you have\na deep seated distrust\nin both yourself and the world in general.\nThree, you have a strong fear of failure.\nBeing afraid of failure is a\nnormal part of human nature.\nHowever, a strong fear of\nfailure can be unhealthy\nif it starts to outweigh\nyour motivation to succeed.\nNot only do you miss out\non a lot of opportunities\nand stifle your creativity\nand ambition because of it,\nbut it can also lead to\nperfectionism and insecurity.\nIt might be instilled in\nyou by unresolved trauma\nthat causes you to have a\nnegative belief in yourself\nand internalize your shortcomings.\nFour, you have a strong fear of success.\nAlternately, repressed\ntrauma can also manifest\nthrough a strong fear of success.\nDid you ever hold yourself back\nfrom getting something you wanted,\nnot because you feared\nyou might not get it,\nbut because you feared what\nwould happen when you did?\nYou're afraid of losing what you'll have\neven before you achieve it.\nThe tendency to unconsciously sabotage\nyour own chances of success\nis often associated with\nthose who were abandoned\nor lost a loved one at a young age.\nFive, you have difficulty concentrating.\nTrauma has a lot of damaging\npsychological effects\nand it's not uncommon for victims\nto suddenly have difficulty concentrating.\nIf you've been having gaps in your memory,\nblacking out often\nand finding it hard to\nkeep your train of thought,\nit might be your mind\ncrying out to you for help,\nasking you to work through your trauma.\nSix, you have trouble asking for help.\nDo you have trouble opening up to others\nabout what happened to you?\nIf you've experienced some\nform of abuse or mistreatment,\nyou usually struggle with asking for help.\nYou'd rather suffer in silence\nbecause you're too afraid to\nreach out to someone else.\nYou don't want to be\nrejected, denied, judged\nor seen as weak by those around you.\nSeven, you often hurt yourself or others.\nDo you lash out at other people\nwhen you're experiencing intense emotions?\nDo you push your loved ones\naway and isolate yourself\nwhenever you have to deal with a problem?\nIf you're still hurting\nfrom unhealed trauma,\nthere are times when you might end up\ntaking it out on yourself\nor those you care about.\nYou become emotionally volatile,\nout of control and overly sensitive.\nYou lose your temper, break things\nand may even resort to self-harm.\nEight, you struggle with low self-esteem.\nThere are a lot of ways trauma\ncan skew your self-image,\nespecially if it's rooted\nin your early childhood experiences.\nAbuse, abandonment and\nneglect can all lead you\nto question your own self-worth.\nYou struggle to feel good about yourself\nif the abuse was inflicted\nupon you by someone you loved.\nStudies have shown that patients with PTSD\noften suffer from low self-esteem\nand feelings of worthlessness.\nAnd nine, you have unexplained\npsychological symptoms.\nDo you feel more anxious\nand panicky than before?\nDo you find it hard to feel happier\nor find pleasure from the\nthings you used to enjoy?\nHave you lost your appetite\nor have trouble sleeping well at night?\nAccording to research,\nanxiety, depression,\ndisassociation,\ndepersonalization, panic attacks,\nfrequent flashbacks, nightmares\nand emotional distress\nare all common in patients with PTSD.\nHave you or someone you\nlove ever experienced\na traumatic situation?\nIf so, how do you plan to overcome it?\nIf you're still suffering\nfrom any lingering psychological trauma,\nit's important that you reach out\nto a mental healthcare professional today\nand get the help you need to get better.\nHealing from trauma takes time and effort,\nbut it's worth it,\nand it's necessary in order\nto truly move forward in life\nand find some peace of mind.\nPlease do share this with those you think\nmight benefit from it.\nStay tuned and thanks for watching."
