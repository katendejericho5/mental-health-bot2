    "transcript": "- [Annoucer] Hi, Psych2Goers.\nHave you ever wondered what\nmakes a person attractive?\nIt might just be their\nmagnetic personality.\nThis means that they\nhold certain qualities\nthat instantly make\nthe people around them feel acknowledged,\nrespected, and welcomed.\nCurious to know how they do it?\n(upbeat music)\nHere are nine personality\ntraits that make you magnetic.\nNumber one, they are present.\nMagnetic people have the distinct trait\nof always being present\nand living in the moment.\nBecause of this, they\ncan make you feel seen,\nheard, important and appreciated.\nAnd according to an\narticle on FacileThings,\na person who is present is\nmore likely to have high levels\nof productivity, creativity,\nand a better ability to make decisions.\nThe article adds that people\nwho can focus their attention\non the now are more flexible,\ncan easily overcome workday stress,\nand restore order after\na chaotic situation.\nEnjoy getting things done,\nmake better decisions,\nhave better relationships\nand produce more.\nNumber two, they are vulnerable.\nHave you noticed that\nyou feel more connected\nto people who show their\nvulnerability to you?\nThis is because being\nvulnerable takes strength,\nand it shows that you're\nable to recognize,\nand accept yourself for who you truly are\nwhich is an attractive quality to have.\nOther benefits of being\nvulnerable according\nto Eugene Therapy is that\nit helps you build empathy,\nstrengthens your ability to\nwork through your emotions,\nstrengthens your resiliency,\nand it helps cultivate\nstronger bonds with others.\nNumber three, they are\ngenuine and authentic.\nHave you ever wondered why people\nwho are genuine are attractive?\nIn an article for Psychology Today,\nlicensed psychology, Guy Winch PhD,\nstates that there are\nthree reasons why genuine,\nand authentic people are more\nappealing than fake people.\nThe first one is truth and honesty.\nAccording to Winch,\n\"We are more likely to\ntrust a genuine person\nthan a fake one\nbecause we believe those\nwho are true to themselves\nare also likely to be truer\nand more honest with us.\nThe second reason is that\nyou associate being genuine\nwith being strong in character,\nand being emotionally resilient,\nand correctly so\", says Winch.\nAs being true to herself\ntakes confidence, tenacity,\nand often even bravery.\nThe final reason is that\npeople are normally attracted\nto uniqueness and individuality.\n\"Qualities genuine people usually\nhave in spades\", says winch.\nNumber four, they have\na good sense of humor.\nCan you make others laugh a lot?\nWhile laughter can open\nthe doors to people,\nand relationships by putting\nthem at ease to be more open,\nit can also depend on the type of humor.\nHumor that is self-depreciating, critical,\njudgemental and meant to humiliate others\ncan push people away as\nno one likes to be made\nto feel worthless.\nThis is why people with\nmagnetic personalities tend\nto distance themselves from\nthis type of negative humor,\nand instead focus on humor\nthat makes people feel good\nabout themselves and which\nuplifts the people around them.\nNumber five, they're creative.\nEver wonder why creative\npeople can touch others\nwith their art?\nCreative people can see\nfrom different perspectives,\nand empathize with all\nparts of different people.\nThey understand new ideas and concepts\nthat make others feel seen.\nTheir open-mindedness can also make it\nso that they don't judge others\nfor their beliefs or feelings.\nInstead, they can make you\nfeel like you're not alone\nin the world.\nThis comforting nonjudgmental\nattitude and validation,\ncreates a place where people\ncan feel safe and seen.\nAnyone with these qualities\nis automatically magnetic\nbecause of the radical acceptance\nthey offer to everyone.\nNumber six, they're naturally curious.\nAre you curious about the world\nand the people around you?\nAccording to an article in\nthe Greater Good Magazine,\ncuriosity can help foster\ncloseness and protect you\nfrom negative social experiences.\nThe article states that\npeople who are curious,\nmake other people feel closer to them,\ncan cope better with\nrejection, are less aggressive,\nand foster more positive\nsocial experiences.\nNumber seven, healthy optimism.\nOptimism usually attracts\npeople because in a sense,\nit gives hope.\nPsychologist, Elizabeth Scott PhD says\nin an article that \"For\npeople who are optimists,\nnegative events are more\nlikely to roll up their back,\nwhile positive events affirm\ntheir belief in themselves,\ntheir ability to make\ngood things happen now,\nand in the future and\nthe goodness of life.\"\nThis view of life according to Scott,\nbenefits the believer in various ways.\nFor example, studies have\nshown that optimistic people\nhave better health,\nhave more achievements,\ndon't give up easily, have\nbetter emotional health,\nare more likely to positively\nhandle futures set backs,\nlive longer and have less stress.\nNumber eight, good communicators.\nAre you good at communicating?\nMagnetic people are\nable to actively listen,\nand pay attention to others\nand what they have to say\nto make sure they feel heard.\nThe one thing states that\nmaking others feel welcomed,\nand exuding the ability to get\nthings done attracts people.\nMagnetic people do not only know how\nto communicate using words,\nbut also with their body\nlanguage and personal energy.\nThey're also good observers\nand can detect changes\nin other people's body\nlanguage and tone of voice.\nThis makes them good\npeople readers who can act\nin accordance with what they perceive.\nAnd number nine, well-versed\nand knowledgeable.\nBecause of their curiosity,\nmagnetic people tend to research,\nand know about last amounts of topics.\nThis helps them interact\nand connect with a variety\nof different people.\nHaving a vast amount of\nknowledge over a subject,\nalso signals how well-versed\nand interested they are\nin the world around them.\nIt also makes them less\nprone to fall for a lie,\nand more able to keep up with\nvarying types of conversation.\nSo do you have a magnetic personality?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like subscribe\nand
