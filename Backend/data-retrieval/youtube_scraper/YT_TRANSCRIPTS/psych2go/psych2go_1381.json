    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nYou may know about some\nof the common symptoms of depression,\nbut what about some of the things\nthat no one really talks about?\nDepression is a complex consuming illness\nthat can take over the mind and body\nfor long periods of time.\nSo it can bring about effects\nthat go beyond symptoms\nyou've already heard of.\nHere are six painful\nthings about depression\nthat no one really talks about.\n(somber music)\nNumber one, feeling like\nan observer of your life.\nHave you ever felt\nlike you were just an\nobserver of your life\ninstead of actively making choices?\nDo you find yourself surrendering\nto what goes on around you?\nFor those with depression,\nit can feel as though you are constantly\non the sidelines of your own life.\nAs much as they may wanna\ntake an active part,\nit can often feel like the\nworld continues to turn,\nleaving them behind.\nNumber two, can't get out of bed.\nHave you ever felt stuck in your bed?\nLike even if you want to\nget out, you just can't?\nSometimes with depression,\npeople may feel stuck in their bed.\nIt's not so much about being tired\nas it is the anxiety\nthat comes along with it.\nThe rumination, physical symptoms,\nor other factors that may\nmake it feel impossible\nto get out of bed despite the\ndesire to start their day.\nThe feeling of being\nstuck can be so painful\nbecause of the constant\ntension of wanting to get up\nbut simply not being able to.\nNumber three, social withdrawal.\nYou may know that social isolation\nor withdrawal is a common\neffect of depression.\nThough it may seem voluntary,\nthose who socially withdraw\nmay do so painfully.\nDepression can make people feel isolated,\nwhich can, in turn, worsen other symptoms.\nIsolation can turn painful\nwhen people lose their sense\nof belonging and purpose\nand deprive themselves of the fulfillment\nthat only social\ninteraction can bring about.\nNumber four, crippling exhaustion.\nHas your exhaustion ever\ngone past just tired?\nDid it feel difficult to do\nthings you normally enjoy?\nThe exhaustion often\nbrought about by depression\ncan overtake the mind and body.\nThis exhaustion can be debilitating,\nmaking it difficult to\ndo the simplest of tasks,\nsuch as drinking water or taking a shower.\nIf you're experiencing this,\nknow that you are not alone\nnor are you lazy or doing anything wrong.\nDepression can consume\nso much energy from you,\nand any level of exhaustion\nyou may feel is totally valid.\nNumber five, overcrowded mind.\nDo you know what it's like\nto feel scatterbrained?\nIt's almost as if your\nmind can't sit still\nand those inner thoughts keep\ncoming at an increasing speed.\nDepression can make this feeling\nfrequent if not constant.\nYou may have heard of this as\nracing thoughts or rumination,\nbut in any case, it can be painful\nto feel like you have no\nway to turn your mind off\nor allow yourself to relax.\nThe chatter can make someone\nfeel anxious, out of control,\nand helpless towards the potential torment\nof constant thoughts.\nAnd number six, stigma and guilt.\nEven now, it's almost impossible\nto talk about depression\nwithout talking about stigma.\nThough, we as a society may have grown\ninto our acknowledgement of depression,\nthat's not to say that\nstigma is fully eradicated\naround the world.\nOften stigmas can make people\nwith depression feel guilty,\nungrateful, or ashamed.\nThis could increase the negative self-talk\nthat depression already brings about\nand can make those with depression feel\nlike they have to suffer in silence.\nStigmas hurt.\nKnow that your feelings are\nvery real and very valid,\nno matter what has been\nsaid to you or around you.\nDid you relate to any of these signs?\nWe hope this helped you learn about some\nof the painful things about depression\nthat people don't often talk about.\nDid we miss anything?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nlike and share it with friends\nthat might find insight in this too.\nRemember, to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the sources used are added\nin the description box below."
