    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nOkay, so you're on a romantic first date,\nand you can't help but wonder\nif your date thinks you're attractive\nas much as you think they are.\nWhat attractive behaviors do you have\nthat you can display to your date?\nWell, here are six behaviors\nthat attract people the most.\nDo you do any of them?\nNumber one, casually touch them.\nA casual and friendly touch here and there\nmay just improve your attractiveness\nif the other person is\ncomfortable with it.\nA flirty quick nudge of the\nelbow or a tap on the shoulder\nmay just make them feel closer to you.\nIn an experiment from the\nUniversity of Mississippi\nand Rhodes College,\nresearchers had waitresses\nbriefly touch customers\non the hand or shoulders\nin a controlled yet natural setting.\nThe waitresses who casually\ntouched their customers\nwhen returning the change\nreceived a significantly larger\ntip than those who did not.\nIn another study published\nin Psychology Press,\nTaylor & Francis Group had men stand\non the corner of the street\nand attempt to talk to\nwomen who would walk by.\nThe men were more successful\nin starting a conversation\nwith a woman when they\nlightly touched the woman\non the forearm for one second.\nAs the researchers state,\nour results showed that a\nman's courtship solicitations\nare more favorably accepted by a woman\nwhen the request is accompanied\nby a light, tactile contact.\nThis isn't to say that everyone\nwould like to be touched\non there and by a stranger.\nBut a flirty brush of the\narm during a romantic date\nmight not hurt your chances of\nthem finding you attractive.\nNumber two, show you're available\nand have open body language.\nHow can you gain someone's\nromantic interest?\nShow you're open to dating them.\nDr. Monica Moore, a psychologist\nat Weber University in St. Louis\nhas conducted research on\nthe flirting techniques\nused in singles bars, shopping malls,\nand places young people\ngo to meet each other.\nAuthor Nicholas Boothman\nwrites in his book,\n\"How to make someone fall in love with you\nin 90 minutes or less\"\nnotes that psychologist Dr. Monica Moore\nfound that it's not\nalways the good looking\nwho get approached the most,\nbut the ones who signaled\ntheir availability\nand confidence through\nbasic flirting techniques\nlike eye-contact and smile.\nJust signaling your interest in someone\ngets you halfway there,\nregardless of gender.\nOne way you can appear more\nconfident and available\nis to display open body language.\nTry to keep your chest and torso more open\nand refrain from crossing\nyour arms too much.\nClosed body language can\ngive off the impression\nyou aren't available or\nsimply don't want to talk.\nAnd availability will signify to others\nthat you're willing to\ntalk and meet new people.\nNumber three, be a leader.\nWant others to notice you?\nWhen you can, be a leader.\nIn a 2014 study, researchers explored\nwhether feelings towards other people\ninfluence the perceptions\nof others attractiveness.\nHaving their subjects in groups,\nthey found subordinates\nrated their group leader\nas significantly more attractive\nthan leaders outside their group.\nSo even if there is no\nrole of group leader\nin your next project,\nbe more vocal about your\nideas, teach others.\nThere are many ways you\ncan prove you're capable\nand apparently attractive group leader.\nOn your next date, suggest\na place you know all about\nand take the lead on a romantic adventure.\nIt could be fun.\nNumber four, smile when you can.\nFeel like laughing at a funny joke,\nsmiling at a sweet comment, then do so.\nAnd don't be afraid to,\nbecause smiling is quite\nattractive according to research.\nA study published in the\nbulletin of Psychonomic Society\nfound smiling might just\nmake you more attractive.\nAccording to the study,\nwomen in the experiment\nwho smiled 70% of the time were seen\nas more interpersonally attractive\nthan a woman who seldom smiled.\nIt looks like a comedy club\ndate might be a good idea.\nNumber five, maintain good eye contact.\n(narrator sighs)\nYour date's dreamy eyes!\nWhy not look at them?\nHarvard psychologist Zick\nRubin conducted a study\nwhere he recorded how much\ntime lovers would spend\nlooking into each other's eyes?\nHe found that individuals\nwho were not in love\nlooked at each other\n30 to 60% of the time,\nwhile those couples deeply in love,\nthey stared into each other's eyes\n75% of the time when talking,\nand when someone else entered\nthe room or interrupted them,\nthey were much slower to turn away\nfrom their partner's gaze.\nA little tip to really get someone\nto consider these\nfeelings of love for you,\nlook into their eyes 75% of the time.\nThe brain remembers the\nlast time someone they loved\nstarted them in the same way.\nThey'll associate this stare\nwith feelings of love and attraction.\nWhy?\nThis lovely memory causes a release\nof Phenylethylamine, which\nis known as \"Love Drug\".\nPhenylethylamine is released in the brain\nwhen someone falls in love.\nThis chemical too mimics the\nbrain chemistry of someone\nwho is deeply in love.\nChocolates contain phenylethylamine,\nwhich is probably why it's\nhistorically been considered\nan aphrodisiac.\nSo if you want your date\nto see you as attractive,\nmaybe romantically gaze\ninto their eyes a bit\nwhen you're talking to them,\nand maybe some hot chocolate.\nMhm, chocolate.\nAnd number six, crack a joke or two.\nWho doesn't love a good joke?\nResearchers from Illinois State University\nand DePaul University found in their study\nthat when you use humor\nwhen getting to know\nan acquaintance at first,\nthat individual has a better\nchance of liking you more.\nThey even found that\nengaging in funny tasks\nmay raise romantic attraction.\nSee, I told you that comedy club\nwas the next perfect day choice.\nTake the lead on picking your next date\nand snuggle up for some good\nold comedy and hot chocolate.\nNot only attractive, but delicious!\nSo which of these behaviors\nwill you use on your next date?\nWhere will you take them?\nHot chocolate, comedy night,\nor romantic stroll hand-in-hand?\nShare with us in the\ncomments section down below.\nIf you
