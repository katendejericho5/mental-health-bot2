    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you long for that perfect match,\nthe person you know is the one for you?\nPerhaps you've leafed\nthrough pages of Cosmopolitan\nto find things that will assure you\nthat the person you're\nwith is your ideal partner.\nYou talk to family and friends\nto make sure that your\npartner gets the okay,\nbut despite the rigorous\nscreening process,\nsometimes you break up with them.\nSo how can you tell if you've\nfound your ideal partner?\nTo help you get the reassurance you need,\nhere are seven signs\nyou have found the one.\n(jaunty music)\nNumber one, the relationship is balanced.\nBalance is necessary for\na long-term relationship.\nIt needs flow.\nThe most common example is\na balance of personalities.\nOne is extroverted, the\nother is introverted,\nbut balance can also refer to chores\nand roles in the relationship.\nYou'll notice if a relationship\nis balanced or not.\nIf things go smoothly, you\ntwo naturally synchronize.\nTwo, you both communicate effectively.\nTo achieve balance in a relationship,\nyou need to know how to\ncommunicate with each other.\nCommunication extends beyond words.\nCommunication is largely about subtext.\nWhat do we say when we aren't speaking?\nYou need to clearly explain your thoughts\nin a way that the other\nperson understands,\nwhich can be harder than you think.\nProper communication\ntakes years of practice,\nbut it's achievable and becomes easier\nwhen you know your audience,\nin this case, your partner.\nThe other, perhaps more important,\npart of communication is listening,\nwhich is something we all\nneed to learn how to do.\nListening involves paying attention\nand being receptive to the\nfeedback you're receiving.\nNumber three, you trust each other.\nNo relationship, romantic or otherwise,\nworks if you don't trust each other.\nThere's no way around it.\nIf you can't trust your partner\nor your partner can't trust you,\nthe relationship won't work.\nTrust opens the door for vulnerability,\nrespect, and intimacy.\nEventually these, along with\nother aspects, create love.\nThese qualities of love\nmanifest in different ways\nfrom being supportive,\nrespecting each other's alone\ntime, and being affectionate.\nNumber four, you share the same values\nand try to achieve them as a couple.\nThis also falls under having\na balanced relationship,\nbut sharing the same\nvalues also makes it easier\nto figure out where your\nrelationship is going.\nAn ideal partner will likely be heading\nthe same direction as you are,\nand they'll want to be by\nyour side on the journey.\nYou and your partner\nshould be on the same page\nabout the big things such as\nmarriage, kids, and the future.\nFive, you also respect each\nother's differing views.\nIt's all right if neither of\nyou share similar opinions\non ice cream flavors\nor holiday traditions.\nWhat matters is that both of\nyou respect each other enough\nto agree to disagree.\nNumber six, you both value\nand keep your promises to each other.\nThis ties in with whether\nyou trust each other or not.\nTrust is vital in a relationship\nbecause it has the power to bind people,\nbut also push them apart.\nTrust is fragile,\nso it's important to keep the promises\nyou make to each other.\nYour ideal partner will strive\nto fulfill the promises they make to you.\nAnd number seven, you both\nare beyond aesthetics.\nThe last sign that you\nfound your ideal partner\nis that you're beyond aesthetics.\nSure, attraction is\nnecessary to fall in love\nand it does reemerge\nthroughout the relationship.\nHowever, when you've\nfound the ideal partner,\nyou're not with them\nbecause of their looks,\nyou're with them because\nyou enjoy being with them,\nbecause you've fallen in\nlove with who they are,\nnot what they look like.\nWe all want to find the right person\nto spend the rest of our lives with,\nwhich explains the constant\nneed for reassurance\nthat we have made the right choice.\nBut when you know, you know.\nDo any of these signs\napply to your relationship?\nDo you agree with this list?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nAnd if you liked this video,\nshare it with friends.\nAs always the references and studies\nare listed in the description below.\nUntil next time, friends.\nSee you soon."
