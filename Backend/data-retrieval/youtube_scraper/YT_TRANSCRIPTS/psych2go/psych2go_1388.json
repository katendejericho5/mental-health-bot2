    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey,\nPsych2goers, welcome back.\nAre you wondering whether you\nhave healthy relationships\nwith the people in your life?\nWhether it's romantic, platonic,\nor familial relationships,\nbuilding and maintaining\na healthy bond with others\nis a key aspect of living a happy life.\nWhilst the determining factors\nof a healthy relationship\nmay differ from person to person,\nthere is a multitude of traits\nthat are common indicators.\nWith that said,\nhere are eight signs of\na healthy relationship.\nNumber one, adaptability.\nAs with emotions,\nhuman personalities are subject to change\nand fluctuations as life happens.\nHave you ever thought someone\nin your life was changing?\nWell, whilst they are still themselves,\nthey may portray an alternate\nversion of themselves\nthrough time and experiences.\nAccording to therapist Lindsey Antin,\nbeing aware and accepting\nof this is important,\nas one thing healthy relationships\nlargely share is adaptability.\nIn order to achieve a\nbalanced power dynamic,\nboth partners in the relationship\nmust be willing to\ncompromise for each other\nand adapt to changes.\nNumber two, encouragement.\nAll of us have had\nvarious dreams and goals.\nAlthough our goals might not always align\nwith other people's goals,\npeople in healthy relationships\nacknowledge the importance\nof constant encouragement.\nEven if you don't relate to\nor fully understand a goal\nof someone in your life,\noffering encouraging words and support\nmight just help make their day.\nNumber three, comfortability.\nDo you ever notice your\nbody physically relax\nas soon as you're in\nthe presence of someone\nwho is very close to you?\nThis might involve inhaling deeply\nand then sighing in relief\nas soon as you enter the safe,\ncomfortable space with them.\nFeeling at ease is a telltale sign\nof a healthy relationship.\nIf you feel tense around someone\nyou'd like to get closer with,\ntry communicating with them,\nas opening up might help\nthe relationship progress.\nAnd it might, in turn,\nmake you feel more comfortable with them.\nNumber four, trust.\nA huge sign of a healthy\nrelationship is trust.\nImagine you get a text from your partner,\nsaying that they're going to\nthe same party as their ex.\nIf you feel calm and unthreatened by this,\nit suggests a trusting\nand healthy relationship.\nSimilarly, if you trust\nyour friends and family\nto have your back,\nit suggests a healthy dynamic.\nIf, however, you don't trust\nthese people in your life,\nthis is something you can work on\nby communicating and being\nopen and honest with them.\nNumber five, physical intimacy.\nIntimacy doesn't always mean sex.\nPlenty of research has\nshown the importance\nof physical contact for well-being,\nand it's, therefore, no surprise\nthat healthy relationships\noften involve cuddling, kissing, hugging,\nor even just being in the\nphysical presence of one another.\nIf you find yourself\nbeing physically drawn\nto a friend, partner, or family member,\nthere's a good chance that you have\na healthy relationship with them.\nEqually, however, if you\ndon't feel comfortable\nbeing physically intimate with someone,\nit's important that the\nother person respects this\nand doesn't make you feel\npressured in any way.\nNumber six, boundaries.\nOne of the fastest ways to\nbreak down a relationship\nis crossing one another's boundaries.\nOn the other hand,\nrecognizing and respecting\nthe other person's\nphysical and emotional boundaries\nis essential in forming\na healthy relationship.\nThere are three components involved\nin creating boundaries for yourself:\nidentifying what your boundaries are,\ncommunicating them to others,\nand sticking by them.\nIf people treat these boundaries\nseriously, that's great.\nIf they don't, it might be worthwhile\nhaving a serious discussion with them.\nAnd if nothing changes,\nyou might need to consider moving on.\nNumber seven, happiness.\nThis might seem obvious,\nbut healthy relationships\nwill provide both parties\nwith joy and happiness.\nDopamine and serotonin\nare feel-good chemicals,\nwhich are the hormones\nreleased from our brain\nwhen we interact with someone we love.\nDo you feel happy spending\ntime with those around you?\nDo you look forward to seeing them?\nIf so, it sounds like you have\nhealthy, fulfilling relationships.\nAnd number eight, communication.\nThis is another huge sign\nof a healthy relationship,\nwhether it's resolving conflicts,\nvocalizing each other's desires,\nor inquiring about the\nwell-being of one another.\nClear communication is a fundamental sign\nof a healthy relationship.\nIn any relationship,\nthere will almost\ncertainly be disagreements\nfrom time to time,\nbut what matters the most is\nhow you both work together\nto resolve the conflict\nin a transparent and respectful manner.\nSo there we have it,\neight signs of a healthy relationship.\nDo you relate to any of these signs?\nThere are more signs than just\nthe ones we've listed today,\nso please let us know if we've missed any\nin the comment section below.\nIf you don't relate to all of these signs,\nthat's completely fine.\nIt takes effort from both sides\nto create and maintain\na healthy connection.\nAnd if you feel as if\nthere's room for improvement,\nstart with communication.\nIf you liked today's video,\nplease like and subscribe to Psych2go,\nif you haven't already.\nAnd share this with others\nwho might also
