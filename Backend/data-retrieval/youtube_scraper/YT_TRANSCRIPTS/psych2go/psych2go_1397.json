    "transcript": "- Hey, it's Psych2Go,\nwelcome back to another brand new video.\nDo you feel lost in life?\nAre you tired of the same old nine to five\nonly for it to happen\nagain the following week?\nSometimes life can feel like a blur.\nIt might seem like a visual\ndepiction of the quote,\nEat, work, repeat.\nYou wake up early, go to school\nor work, rest and the cycle\ncontinues day in and day out.\nIf you are looking to take back\nsome control over your life,\nhere are six small habits that\ncan change your life forever.\nNumber one, a gratefulness list.\nDo you feel like you forget things easily?\nAnd that moment you try to remember them,\nit just escapes your memory?\nIt's hard for your memory to store\nevery moment of your waking life.\nTime can lead you to forget\nabout some of the things\nthat you had once cared about.\nMaybe a stranger complimented\nyour hair once a week ago,\nor your teacher commended\nyou for submitting\na great project.\nWeeks later, these things\nall fall into the recesses\nof your brain and are\nforgotten completely.\nPsychologist from the\nUniversity of California\ndid some research and it showed\nthat people who write about\nthings they're grateful for\nare more optimistic and feel\nbetter about their lives.\nIt can even lead you to take\naction more like exercising,\nwhich further improves\nmental health and wellbeing.\nNumber two, a social media detox.\nAre you aware of how much\ntime you've been spending\non social media platforms lately?\nIs it day after day of scrolling?\nIn the face of the pandemic,\nmore people than ever look\nto their phone screens\nand social media for their\nsocial fix, but alongside it,\nmany negative aspects have arisen,\nsuch as feelings of inadequacy, FOMO,\nfeelings of isolation and self absorption.\nA 2018 UPenn study found\nthat reducing social media\nto 30 minutes a day can\nsignificantly reduce feelings\nof anxiety, depression,\nand sleep problems.\nIt doesn't mean you have to\ncut back on it all at once,\nbut even just a slight time reduction\ncan already bring great benefits.\nAccording to statistics,\nonly a small percentage of\nyou who watch our videos\nare actually subscribed.\nSo if you haven't and\nat the end of the video,\nyou enjoy what you see,\ndo consider subscribing.\nIt would help a lot\nwith YouTube's algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content.\nThanks for being here.\nNumber three, clean your room daily.\nHave you tidy up your room recently?\nDoes your workspace look neatly organized\nor are things sprawled all over?\nWorking in a clean room can\ngive both your mind and body\na whole host of benefits.\nThese benefits include\nimproved sleep quality,\nincreased productivity, and\na sense of accomplishment.\nIf your room is messier\nthan you would like,\nit's advisable to try\nand divide your process\ninto more manageable chunks\nto make it feel less daunting.\nA little bit of effort can go a long way,\nthrowing some good\nmusic and you're all set\nfor the adventure.\nNumber four, the 80/20 principle.\nEver heard of the 80/20 principle?\nWilfredo Pareto first\nintroduced the 80/20 principle,\nwhich laid out the idea that\n20% of homeowners own 80%\nof the land, the same principles\napply to your daily life.\nOnly 20% of the work that you do\ncontributes to 80% of your success.\nThis means a big chunk of what you do\nis not relevant to your success.\nTo identify the 20%, you\ncould start with a list\nof everything you'd like to accomplish\nwith the most important tasks at the top.\nIt helps you recognize the top 20%\nand focus on those tasks.\nWith that, you can improve your efficiency\nand push your efforts and things\nthat truly matter most to you.\nNumber five, meditate.\nDo you know that meditation\ndates back thousands of years?\nDo you ever wonder if it\nactually improves anything?\nTo answer the question,\nmeditation or spending\na few minutes, practicing mindfulness\nhas been proven to help.\nIts primary purpose is to give you\na sense of calm and\nrestore your inner peace.\nIt doesn't require anything more,\nbut you and a nice quiet environment.\nMeditating brings down your stress levels,\ngiving you some space to be alone\nwith yourself and your thoughts.\nMeditation is also the\nultimate detoxifier.\nIt can increase your self awareness,\nhelp you focus on the present,\nand reduce negative emotions.\nNot only that, but there are\nmultiple ways to meditate too,\nsuch as Tai Chi or Yoga, take your pick.\nAnd number six, exercise.\nAre you a treadmill person\nor run around your local park person?\nNo matter what the mode is,\nit's the intent that matters.\nWhen you exercise, you're\nnot just working your muscles\nand other physical aspects of your body,\nyou're improving your mental state too.\nExercising releases endorphins,\nwhich are feel good chemicals\nthat can boost your energy\nthroughout the day.\nBy building up the habit of exercise,\nyou can boost both your\nphysical and mental wellbeing,\nwhich in turn increases your confidence,\noptimism, and decreases\nyour stress levels.\nHabits are not one-time\nescapes, they're consistent,\nrudimentary acts that can be fostered\nwith the right mindset and determination,\nstriving to cut down bad habits\nand building up good ones.\nEven if you feel like\nyour progression is slow,\nit's a great step in the right direction.\nIt will come out all for the better.\nDo you think these habits are achievable?\nWhat are some habits you'd\nlike to break out of?\nFeel free to leave comments down below\nwith your thoughts,\nexperiences, or suggestions.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like\nbutton and share it\nwith those out
