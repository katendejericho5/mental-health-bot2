    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2goers!\nThis is Part Two of\nFive myths about autism.\nIf you wanna watch Part One,\ncheck the link in description.\nWith that said, here are\nfive myths about autism\nwritten by our autistic specialist writer,\nand based on research\ninto the most common myths\namong the public.\nNumber one, The Empathy Myth.\nOn any list of autistic traits,\ncommunication and emotion\nwill be mentioned.\nUnfortunately, early researchers only saw\nthe most extreme cases and\ngot the wrong idea about\nthis seemingly flat tone of\nvoice and facial expressions.\nAnd this led to continued\nmisunderstandings about\nhow autistic people feel empathy.\nResearch shows that empathy\nactually has two components.\nCognitive empathy is the ability\nto understand another person's thoughts,\ndesires, and beliefs.\nAnd effective empathy is the drive\nto respond to another\nperson's emotional state.\nOn an average, autistic people demonstrate\na lower cognitive empathy\nthan control groups,\nbut the effective empathy is the same.\nIn other words, autistic\npeople always care about\nwhat you're feeling, but\nthey don't always recognize\nwhat emotion you're feeling or why.\nThe link between emotional feelings\nand emotional expressions\ncan be disconnected in autistic people.\nSo when they do respond to\nanother person's emotions,\nthe results can appear flat\nor unaffected on the outside,\nbut be assured they're likely\nfeeling a lot on the inside.\nNumber two, The Behavior Myth.\nWere you ever thrust into a completely\nunfamiliar setting as a child?\nThe results can be stressful for anyone\nand autistic people are no exception.\nA lack of understanding about\nautistic stress response\nhas led to continued misconceptions about\nwhat these behaviors really mean.\nIn the ignorant early\ndays of autism research,\nautism was mistakenly\nthought to be a variation\nof schizophrenia and defined\nby negative behaviors.\nSome people can be anxious\nabout unfamiliar behaviors\nand demonize what they don't understand.\nWe now understand that\nautistic people are likely\nto have other conditions\nlike sleep problems, anxiety,\nand depression, to be overwhelmed\nby their surroundings,\nor to have difficulties\ncommunicating their wants and needs.\nThis leads to constant\nstress and frustration,\nwhich can manifest in unhealthy\nand unpredictable ways.\nBut don't be fooled.\nThe real challenge of autism\nisn't the outward appearance of behaviors.\nIt's the underlying friction\nbetween the individual\nand a stressful environment.\nNumber three, The Friend Myth.\nMaking new friends can be tough, right?\nFor those who find it really tough,\nthere can be a temptation to just give up.\nThis kind of social isolation\ncan give off a misleading impression\nbut that's out of tune\nwith their real desires.\nThe misconception that autistic\npeople don't want friends,\nhas led to self-fulfilling prophecies\nwhere other people don't\nreach out to autistic people\nbecause they assume it will be unwanted.\nIn reality, many autistic people desire\nsocial relationships, but\nthey find it challenging\nto maintain stable,\nhigh-quality friendships.\nEven worse, a majority of\nautistic adults have reported\nthat their childhood interactions\nincluded traumatic events,\nexclusion, and bullying,\nwhich can lead to\nself-isolation out of fear.\nAutistic people feel\nloneliness like everyone else,\nbut creating meaningful\nconnections requires support\nof friends with a true understanding\nof autistic differences and needs.\nNumber four, The Intimacy Myth.\nIf making new friends is tough,\nfinding a partner is even tougher.\nThere's a similar misconception\nto the previous one\nthat can lead to even more ignorance\nof autistic people's wants and needs.\nAnd the misconception that autistic people\naren't interested in\nintimate relationships\nis another form of a\nself-fulfilling prophecy.\nUnfortunately, some parents\nof autistic children\nwho face daily challenges,\ncan be anxious about the\nfuture and be in denial\nthat they will become adults\nwith even more challenges.\nThey can deliberately\nignore any possibility\nof intimate relationships\nas a way of insisting\nthat they'll be children eternally.\nBy refusing to give them\nany awareness or guidance,\nthese parents set them up for failure\nand sabotage any possibility\nof adult relationships,\nwhich gives off the wrong impression.\nIn reality, autistic people\ndesire intimate relationships\nlike everyone else,\nbut they're exhausted and confused\nby the complex expectations\nand interactions involved.\nThe uncertainties can be overwhelming\nand can also lead to\nwithdrawal and self-isolation.\nAnd number five, The Life Trajectory Myth.\nCharities aimed at helping\nautistic individuals often\nemphasize the most sympathetic cases.\nWhile this practice is well-intentioned,\nit can lead to some people\ngetting the wrong idea.\nIf I asked you to picture\nthe typical autistic person in your mind,\nwhat kind of person do you envision?\nIs it a young child?\nAlthough children can be autistic,\nthere's a false impression\nthat only children can be autistic,\nwhich leads to the misconception\nthat autism can be outgrown.\nThis false impression is caused by\nthe availability heuristic,\na mental shortcut where people think\nthat more memorable cases are\nmore typical or important.\nIn reality, autism can be found\nacross the entire lifespan,\nbut that all cases are not publicized\nas often as childhood cases,\nthis affects funding and\nadds to the challenges\nof autistic people growing up\nas they often become an\neligible for support services,\nonce they become legal adults,\nbut even when support\ngoes away, autism doesn't\nas it's a core part of a person's being.\nSo there you have it,\n10 myths about autism.\nThe next time you see a claim about autism\npause for a second and reflect on\nwhether it might be a\nmisconception before deciding\nto accept it or not.\nEven better, like and share this video\nto help spread correct\nand respectful knowledge\nabout autism in society.\nResearch shows that\npre-bunking misinformation\nis more effective than debunking it,\nmeaning that it's best to\nspread corrections throughout\nthe public before the\nmisconceptions reached them.\nAnd you can help us with that.\nThanks so much for watching,\nand we'll see you next time."
