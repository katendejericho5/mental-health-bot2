    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psyche2Go-ers,\na taboo topic in our society\nis speaking ill of our parents.\nWhen we bring up our own traumatic events\nregarding our parents, we're shushed\nand shunned with phrases like,\n\"They did the best they could.\n\"They did everything\nfor you.\" or the usual,\n\"You're ungrateful.\"\nWhile our parents might have meant well,\nit's undeniable that\nsome are highly toxic.\nThe consequence of this\nlifetime of toxic parenting\nis an adult who continues to suffer from\nan unhealthy perspective\nof love and relationships,\nand a lack of understanding\nof their own emotional\nand mental needs.\nSo with that said,\nhere are 10 characteristics\nof highly toxic parents\nand how they affect you.\nNumber one, they're hyper-critical.\nCriticism from parents is normal.\nWell-adjusted criticism\ncan help you see the flaws\nin a plan and make better\nchoices for yourself.\nHowever, if your parents\nare overly critical of you\non a regular basis, this is a toxic trait.\nThat it constant criticism,\nand sometimes comparison\ncan make a child feel like\nthey aren't good enough or at fault\nfor their parents'\nconstant attacks on them.\nThis result is an adult who\nhas a harsh inner critic\nas a constant companion.\nThis inner critic can actually sound like\nyour parents' voice telling\nyou detrimental things\nall the time.\nNumber two, they don't\nallow you to express\nyour true feelings.\nHealthy parents are\naware that their children\nhave emotions and opinions too.\nThey welcome the expression\nand discussion from their children.\nHighly toxic parents\ndon't have this awareness.\nHighly toxic parents take a\nchild expressing their confusing\nand difficult emotions as\nattacks on their character.\nThere are no individual feelings,\njust a few collective emotions.\nParents being dismissive of\ntheir children's emotions\ncan result in depression,\naccording to the American\nPsychological Association,\nbecause their true self\nis being suppressed.\nThis results in a child who\ncan't express or identify\ntheir own needs as an\nadult, who suffers the same\nand aims to please everyone,\nbecause that's what they know.\nAre you having trouble staying productive?\nIs stress and anxiety stopping you\nfrom getting a good night's sleep?\nWe'd like to thank Endel,\nour sponsor for this video.\nHelping you sleep, relax and\nfocus is what Endel does best,\nwith their personalized soundscapes,\nthey can create feelings\nof comfort and safety,\nboost your

offer.\nNumber three, they compete with you.\nBeing competitive is a good\nthing that can help you\nbecome more resilient and\nconfident about making our dreams\na reality.\nHaving parents that inspire you to exceed\nin what you want to do is a blessing.\nToxic parents seem to view\ntheir children as competitors.\nThey might derail your success\nor goals by using sabotage\nand belittling your dreams\nand accomplishments.\nYou end up not feeling confident\nin reaching your own goals.\nSome highly toxic\nparents are quite jealous\nof their children and the\nopportunities that they have.\nSo they might overtake you in your goals\nor force you to live their\nown long gone dreams.\nNumber four, they don't see\ntheir children as individuals.\nHighly toxic parents, or HTPs,\nsee their children as\nextensions of themselves only.\nThey want their kids to\nfollow in their footsteps\nor live out the dreams they\nnever got to accomplish,\nbecause they see their kids as\nsmall versions of themselves,\nthey fear the kids being\nautonomous and leaving them,\nso they prevent them from being themselves\nand functioning as an individual.\nAny undesirable behavior\nthat can make them look bad\nis ridiculed both publicly and privately.\nThe child becomes an\nadult who doesn't have\na separate identity, nor\ndo they know who they are.\nNumber five, they control\ntheir children using guilt\nand money.\nHealthy parents can\ngive gifts, affirmation,\nand physical affection without\nexpecting anything in return\nbecause they know it's not a business deal\nthat requires reciprocity to make it work.\nThey do it because they\nwant to and love to.\nHTPs will give a child all these things\nand demand something in return.\nIf the child doesn't,\nthey're reminded of the\nsacrifices that the parent made\nand everything they've done.\nChildren become afraid to ask for help\nand for things that they do need,\nbecause they'll be asked\nto give something back\nthat they don't want.\nThey may turn into\nsuspicious distrustful adults\nwho question kindness and\ndoubt people's intentions.\nNumber six, they always\nput their feelings first.\nPutting your feelings first isn't bad.\nBut if you do it often and\nat the expense of others,\nthat is a toxic trait.\nParents who do this in\na family environment,\ndon't create positive\nrelationships with their children.\nBy not considering the family's feelings\nand opinions about family matters,\nthese parents force their kids\nto hide their true feelings\nto please and soothe the parent.\nThis can result in an adult\nwho lies and hides who they are\nand downplays their\nown needs and feelings.\nNumber seven, they demand\nyour attention and praise.\nToxic parents can't live\nwithout attention and praise.\nThat has to be positive, of course,\nand you must give it often.\nWell adjusted parents know\nthat their kid needs to be\ntheir own person, away from them to grow.\nHTPs constantly demand your\nattention and interaction.\nThis forced bonding is\ntiring and time consuming\nfor children.\nThey may turn into adults\nthat struggle to say no\nand suffer through things\nthey really don't wanna do\nbecause of leftover guilt.\nNumber eight, they withhold\nlove as a form of punishment.\nBeing punished by your\nparents is necessary to learn\nthat consequences exist for actions.\nHowever, healthy punishment options exist.\nHTPs will often use the silent\ntreatment on their child\nto discipline them, instead of\nexpressing their displeasure\nin a productive way.\nThis passive aggressiveness\nmakes the child feel pressured\ninto solving a problem that\nthey didn't even cause.\nThey may tell their kids that\nthey don't love or like them,\ngive them short, rude\nanswers and dirty looks\nand refuse physical touch.\nThis manifests in children\nwho hide the truth\nfrom their parents or\nengage in worse behavior\nif they believe that their\nparents don't care about them.\nNumber nine, they give no\napologies and take no blame.\nWell rounded parents aren't perfect people\nand they're aware of this.\nThey know that their\nactions can and do have\nunpleasant consequences\nand they communicate\nthis with their children,\nwhen they hurt them\nunintentionally or intentionally.\nHTPs are not in that group.\nThey are not self-aware or\nfocused on self-improvement.\nThey always see themselves as the victim.\nThey're too preoccupied\nwith judging people\nand blaming everyone\nelse, even their own kids.\nThey refuse to give an\napology because they believe\nthat children aren't worthy of them.\nThis makes the child feel\nlike the wrongs done to them\ndon't matter or need correction.\nSo they become adults who\ndon't voice any grievances\nand suffer in silence.\nThen number 10, they\nignore healthy boundaries.\nWell-rounded parents know\nthat having boundaries is good\nfor themselves and their\nchildren because it teaches them\nself-respect.\nThey will knock on the door first,\nallow you privacy and\nencourage general communication\nwithin the family.\nHTPs don't know what boundaries are,\nat least not in regard to their kids.\nThey give little to no privacy.\nThey trample all over boundaries and force\nan immeshed dynamic in the family,\nwhere you can't tell where you start\nand the rest of the family ends.\nParents who display this toxic trait,\nmake it difficult for\nchildren to recognize, set,\nunderstand, and maintain boundaries.\nThis child becomes an adult\nwith little understanding\nof healthy boundaries\nand respect for others.\nSo do you relate to any of the\nthings we've mentioned here?\nIf you come from a home\nwhere you didn't receive\nunconditional love, affirmation, security,\npracticing independence and\nindividuality can help you\nbreak this cycle and be\na better, more adjusted,\nsecure person.\nIt takes a long time and a lot of work,\nbut it's rewarding in the long run.\nWhile it may not be simple or possible\nfor some people to leave their\ntoxic parents and guardians,\naction does need to be\ntaken to start healing.\nIf you are a victim of toxic parenting,\ntherapy is extremely important\nand helpful long-term.\nIf you're a parent who\nsees these characteristics\nin yourself, help from a\nmental health professional\ncan help you break\nthese negative patterns.\nDid you find this video valuable?\nTell us in the comments below.\nPlease like, and share it with friends\nthat might find use in this video too.\nMake sure to subscribe to
