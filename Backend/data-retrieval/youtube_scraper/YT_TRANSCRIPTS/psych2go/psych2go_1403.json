    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers.\nHave you ever felt broken?\nThe feeling of being overwhelmed by work,\nor when life deals you blow after blow,\nand it doesn't seem like\nthings will ever get better.\nThe feeling that you'll\nnever reach your goals\nno matter how hard you try,\nand that everyone can see\nand is focused on your\nfaults and failings.\nBut when all seems hopeless,\nwhat can you do to change it?\nWhat can you keep in mind\nso you can keep going and be prepared\nfor when this happens next?\nHere are some points to keep in mind\nto maintain the tenacity to keep going.\nIt can be a long, hard road\nthat leads out of dark times,\nbut the path out can be found.\nLet's begin.\nNumber one, remember to accept\nand anticipate change.\nOne of the reasons humans\nhave not only survived\nbut thrived for so long\nis because we have the\nability to adapt to change.\nOur world is constantly changing\nfrom technology to trends\nand everything in between.\nIt's important to remember\nto stay true to yourself\nwhile accepting, and\neven embracing, change.\nPrepare as best as you can,\nbut accept that some factors\nare out of your control,\nso it might be good to\nset up a backup plan\nor two or three.\nTalking to others can also help you\nput the changes into perspective,\nsince our own minds often distort them.\nNumber two, remember that your emotions\nand experiences are valid.\nToo often society attempts\nto brush struggles with mental health away\nwith phrases such as just smile,\ngood vibes only, or,\nwell, it could be worse.\nEven the most optimistic people\nwill struggle and feel down sometimes.\nEven the most successful people\ngo through defeat and failure.\nEven though it could be worse,\nthat doesn't make what you're\ngoing through any easier.\nAllow yourself to go\nthrough these emotions\nin a healthy way,\nwhether through talking\nto others or journaling,\nbecause trying to bury them\noften leads to worse effects.\nNumber three, remember to ask for help.\nAsking for help goes hand in hand\nwith validating your emotions\nand accepting change.\nWhen you ask for help,\nyou validate your emotions\nby sharing them with others,\nwho may have felt the same way you do.\nThe earlier you reach out for help,\nthe more prepared you can be\nfor future changes as well.\nThe better connections\nyou build with people,\nwhether at work, school,\nor in your personal life,\nthe easier it will be to reach out to them\nin a time of need.\nEven though it may be nerve-wracking\nto ask for help at first,\nmost of the time, you will find someone\nwho is patient enough and understanding.\nNumber four, and this is huge,\nremember to be present in the moment.\nOftentimes that feeling of brokenness\nstems from regrets about the past\nor worries about the future.\nHowever, we can't change the past,\nand we have little\ncontrol over the future.\nStaying aware of and being\nfocused on the present\nwill help change your outlook on life.\nHigh and low journaling can\nhelp you become more present.\nAt the end of every week,\nyou can briefly write down\nat least one positive\nand one negative thing\nwhich occurred that week.\nFocusing on a positive teaches gratitude,\nwhile acknowledging the negative\nhelps gain perspective and patience.\nNumber five, remember to\nfocus on being the best you.\nEven though change in life is constant,\nthat doesn't mean you\nhave to change yourself\nevery time someone else wants you to.\nFocus on building upon your strengths\nand improving yourself,\nrather than wishing you\nwere someone you're not.\nThese feelings of self-doubt\noften stem from comparing\nyourself to others.\nFor this reason, it can be helpful\nto limit the use of social media,\nwhere you constantly only see the perfect,\ncurated images of other people's lives,\npeople you don't know.\nInstead, you can gain inspiration\nfrom friends and family\nand compare yourself to your past self,\nsince self-improvement\nis what truly matters.\nFinally, remember that\nprogress and improvement,\nespecially related to mental health,\nis a continuous journey.\nEvery day you may have to work on\nreminding yourself of these points.\nAnd some days, it might\nbe harder, others easier.\nStill, the most important\nlesson you can learn\nis that breaking the cycle of\nfeeling broken is possible,\nand positive change will come with time.\nHowever, if these feelings of brokenness\nlead to symptoms of mental illness\nor thoughts of harming yourself or others,\nplease reach out to a\nmental health professional\nas soon as possible.\nCan you relate to any of these feelings\nmentioned in this video?\nI bet we all can,\nso feel free to share with the fam\nin the comments below.\nRemember to like and share this video\nwith people who might benefit.\nAs always, the resources and studies used\nare listed in the description below.\nThanks for watching, take care,\nand we'll see you soon."
