    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hi, Psych2Goers.\nDo you have times where\nyou just feel out of touch\nwith yourself, your\nfriends, or your passions,\nor all of the above?\nEverybody has off days.\nBut do you get the sense that these events\nare happening a little\nmore than you'd like?\nIf so, you may be experiencing burnout.\nBurnouts are your body's\nway of telling you\nthat you're getting exhausted\nemotionally, physically, and mentally.\nIt's usually caused by\nextreme and prolonged stress.\nIf you go a long time without\naddressing these issues,\nyou may spiral and worsen,\nand it can cause lowered\nself-esteem and even depression.\nSo, to help you be more aware\nof your mental and emotional wellbeing,\nhere are seven signs\nthat you're burnt out.\nNumber one: You're procrastinating a lot.\nAre you constantly putting off\nthings that need to get done?\nOne behavioral symptom of burnout\nis withdrawal from responsibilities.\nThe laziness you are\ncurrently experiencing\nmay actually be a cry for help.\nThis continuous act of task aversion\nmay also be because you're\nafraid of failing tasks\nyou're supposed to complete.\nIt may help to talk to someone\nabout the current pressure\nand stress you're feeling\nand to take some time off\nuntil you're feeling better.\nNumber two: You're isolating\nyourself from others.\nAre you tired of socializing?\nDo you frequently want\ntime only for yourself?\nBecause of exhaustion,\nthe act of seeing and talking to people\nmay feel too tiring to think about.\nYou may feel that you\nonly talk about work,\nlife responsibilities,\nwhich may add to the stress\nyou're trying to avoid.\nRemember that time alone is important,\nbut emotional isolation is dangerous.\nThis disengagement might\nbe a symptom of depression.\nTalking to a therapist may\nprove to be a great help\nto your mental state.\nHelp is always available.\nAccording to statistics,\nonly a small percentage of\nyou who watch our videos\nare actually subscribed.\nSo, if you haven't\nand at the end of the video\nyou enjoy what you see,\ndo consider subscribing.\nIt would help a lot\nwith YouTube's algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content.\nThanks for being here.\nNumber three: You're\nbecoming very impatient.\nIs everyone getting on your nerves?\nDoes every little thing,\nno matter how trivial,\nmake you irritated?\nThis may be a sign of\nunderlying stress and anxiety.\nA lifestyle cause of\nburnout is working too much\nwithout enough time for\nsocializing or relaxing.\nThis onslaught of negative emotions\nmay be a result of not\nhaving enough support\nfrom friends and loved ones.\nSo, having a healthy social life\noutside of your work or school life\nis beneficial to your mental health\nand may reduce the chances of burning out.\nNumber four: You can't sleep.\nNo matter how tired you are\nduring the day, (yawning)\nis going to sleep at night a struggle?\nThere was a study that\nobserved the association\nbetween insomnia and job strain.\nThey discovered that insomnia\nis strongly linked with burnout.\nLack of sleep may also bring about\nhigher chances of high blood pressure,\nheart disease, diabetes, and more.\nThe bottom line is that you need sleep.\nSome home remedies for insomnia\nare to stick to a sleeping\nschedule, stay active,\nand to limit caffeine and\nalcohol from your diet.\nAlthough insomnia is a\ncommon sleep disorder,\nit can really bring severe\nissues to your health.\nA physical exam performed\nby a medical expert\nmight also help you get a diagnosis\nand treatment for your lack of sleep.\nNumber five: Your previous\nhobbies no longer excite you.\nDo you still find joy in the\nactivities you used to love?\nIf the answer is no, then this disinterest\nmay stem from being emotionally drained.\nContinuous disinterest\nand lack of willingness to do anything\nis also another symptom of depression.\nIt may help to reach out to\nthose who are close to you\nand tell them about your troubles\nand to spend time doing new things.\nTry to limit talking to people\nwho make you feel bad about yourself,\nsince they can only worsen the situation.\nAnd instead, you can find new friends\nand enjoy their eccentricities.\nKeep in mind that you're not\nalone in feeling burned out.\nA lotta people can relate to you,\nso don't be afraid of opening up.\nNumber six: Your work\nor school performance\nis deteriorating.\nAre you frequently coming in late?\nAre your numbers of absences\nstarting to tally up?\nBurnouts can be overwhelming,\nso you might find yourself\ndoing almost anything\nto avoid your responsibilities.\nAt times like these, it\nmay help to think back\non why you're doing what you're doing.\nWhy did you choose this\nfield in the first place?\nWhen was the last time\nyou genuinely smiled?\nGo back to your positive days\nand surround yourself with the thoughts,\npeople, and acts that make you happy.\nAnd number seven: You turn to\naddictive habits for comfort,\nlike smoking, drinking,\nor eating, et cetera.\nWhen hopelessness, fear,\nand many other negative\nemotions drown you,\nself-medication may seem\nlike a helpful way out.\nSelf-medication is the use of alcohol,\ndrugs, and other methods to\nmanage a mental health issue.\nWhat is often overlooked is the fact\nthat this is only a temporary solution\nto a permanent problem.\nIt may lead to addiction and\nincreased health problems.\nAnd yes, even food is a\nform of self-medication.\nIf you recognize this symptom in yourself,\nit may help to recognize your triggers\nand to slowly change your harmful habits\nto healthier ones to help you cope.\nThere are numerous ways to\nadopt better sustainable habits,\nlike exercise, for one, is\nproven to boost your mood\nand promote calm feelings.\nAnd of course, a visit to a therapist\nor a licensed medical professional\ncan help in further treatment.\nDo you think you're burned out?\nLet us know in the
