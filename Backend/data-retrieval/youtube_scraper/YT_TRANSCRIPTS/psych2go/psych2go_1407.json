    "transcript": "- Hey Psych2Goers.\nAre you trying to take up\nnew and healthier habits?\nIf you want to improve every day\nand become a better and\nkinder person, that is great.\nHowever, certain habits\nyou may think look good\non the surface could actually\nbe working against us.\nSo to help you with that,\nhere are six common habits\nthat are actually toxic.\nNumber one, mistaking\nrepression for being calm.\nDo you keep strong\nemotions bottled up inside?\nPerhaps you always tell\nthe people around you\nthat you're all right,\nand that they shouldn't worry about you,\neven though you're not in the best shape.\nWhile you may appear calm on the outside,\nhiding your negative emotions\ncan have a negative impact.\nAccording to clinical\npsychologist, Victoria Tarratt,\nsuppressing your emotions is\nsaid to affect blood pressure,\nmemory, and self esteem.\nIt can also aggravate\ndepression and anxiety\nin the longterm.\nSo instead of repressing how you feel,\nacknowledge your emotion\nin a safe environment.\nIdentifying your emotion can be beneficial\nby itself already.\nNumber two, being too independent.\nAre you always insisting that\nyou do things on your own?\nDependency is a common trait\nshared amongst all people,\nespecially at the earliest\nstages of infancy.\nAnd as time goes by, you outgrow\nmany of the basic faculties\nbecoming more independent in the process,\nbut to thrive as adults,\nbeing too dependent\nor too independent can stunt growth.\nThere's a sweet spot\nto balance it all out.\nAnd it's called healthy dependence,\nwhere you can nurture both\nautonomy and intimacy.\nNumber three, you need to\nbe in control of everything.\nDo you need rigid systems\nin place all the time?\nPeople who compulsively control everything\nusually do so to protect\nthemselves and others\nfrom making mistakes or getting hurt.\nWhile having systems in\nplace isn't a bad thing,\nbeing too rigid can also be problematic.\nAccording to NY based mental\nhealth counselor, Diane Webb,\na person with over-controlling tendencies\ncan get triggered by anxiety\nif even just one thing isn't in place.\nInstead, try to ground yourself and focus\non the things that you can control.\nAfter all, you can't control\nthings external to you,\nbut you can control how you react to them.\nNumber four, striving for perfectionism.\nAre you always trying to get\nthings right and perfect?\nPerfectionism may seem\nlike a good thing at first,\nafter all who wouldn't\nwant to get things right\nall the time, but in truth,\nperfectionism isn't as\nglamorous as it seems.\nMultiple studies have linked\nperfectionism behavior\nto common mental illnesses,\nsuch as depression, anxiety,\nand eating disorders.\nThis is especially true if you reflect\na maladaptive perfectionism type\nwhere you beat yourself\nup for every mistake.\nIf you recognize some of\nthese habits in yourself,\ntry practicing self-compassion\nwhen ever you make mistakes.\nFive, skipping sleep, even\nfor something important.\nHow many all-nighters\nhave you pulled lately?\nWhile you may feel like\nyou're saving time,\nby getting more hours on to prepare\nfor a test or an assignment,\nyou may actually be doing the opposite.\nDuring sleep, our brain processes\ninformation from the day\nto form memories.\nDisrupting that can\ndiminish memory formation\nand learning retention.\nThis is because sleep\ndeprivation can make it difficult\nto consolidate a memory to\nbe recalled for the future.\nAnd six, pleasing others at your expense.\nIs it hard for you to say no to others?\nPerhaps you often find\nyourself stretched too thin\nat the expense of others.\nThere's nothing wrong with\npracticing genuine kindness\nand unconditional support to others.\nBut people pleasing goes beyond that.\nAccording to therapist, Erika Myers,\nthe urge to please others\ncan be damaging to ourselves\nand potentially to our relationships\nwhen we allow other people's wants\nto have more importance than our needs.\nThis can result in other\npeople taking advantage of you,\nfeeling unsatisfied with your\nrelationships and burnout.\nRather than wanting to please people,\nshow kindness from a genuine heart\nand not as a way to\ncontrol their reactions.\nPutting yourself in front\nof others isn't selfish.\nIt just shows that you\nhave respect for yourself,\nwhich can remind others\nto respect you too.\nAre you planning to change\nyour habits to be better?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references and studies\nused in this video, as always,\nare added in the description below.\nThanks so much for watching\nand we will see you in the next one."
