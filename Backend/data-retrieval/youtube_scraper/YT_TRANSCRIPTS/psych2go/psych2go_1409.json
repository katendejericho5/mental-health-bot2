    "transcript": "- [Speaker] Hey, lovely Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nIt's only with your support\nthat we can make psychology\nand mental health more\naccessible to everyone.\nSo thank you for all the\nlove that you've given us.\nNow let's continue.\nDo you think you might be\nstruggling with self-love?\nOftentimes it can be much\neasier to look outward\nand focus on what's happening\nexternally around you,\nrather than look inward and\ntry to work on yourself.\nBut without self-love,\nyou might unconsciously\nget into toxic\nrelationships, toxic habits,\nand might even develop depression.\nThe first step to change\nthis is self-awareness.\nSo here are five indicators\nthat you're struggling\nto love yourself.\nNumber 1, you feel bad when\nyou take time out for yourself.\nDo you feel guilty when you\ntake time out for yourself?\nDo you feel like you could be doing\nother more productive things\nor that you should be helping\nothers during your downtime?\nWhen you feel like this,\nyou might have a low sense of self-worth.\nAnd you think that it's wrong or selfish\nto put yourself first.\nPracticing proper self-care\nmeans taking time out\nfor yourself too.\nWhen you sit down and\nrelax with a good book\nor take a small nap, it\nreleases hormones in the brain\nlike endorphins to help calm\nyou and put you at ease.\nHaving downtime also allows you the chance\nto center yourself and internally process\nyour day-to-day happenings.\nA little self-care can go a long way.\nNumber 2, you keep\nfalling for toxic people.\nWhen you think about your\ncurrent or past relationships,\nis there an emerging pattern\nwhere they all toxic or\nmanipulative in some way, shape or form?\nDid they, or do they mistreat,\nbelittle or insult you?\nFirst and foremost, no one has the right\nto treat you this way.\nWhen you have low self-esteem,\nthis can be a sign that\nyou're lacking in self-love\nand can also be one of the reasons\nyou keep falling for toxic partners.\nIf you struggle to respect yourself,\nit's hard to find other people\nthat will respect you too.\nYou might struggle with\npoor self-esteem issues\nbecause of past relationship experiences\nor because of traumatic\nchildhood experiences.\nFeeling good about yourself is important,\nloving yourself even more so.\nNumber 3, you apologize for things\neven when you don't need to.\nDo you find that you\nimpulsively say sorry, a lot?\nDo other people tell you\nto just stop apologizing?\nIf this sounds like you,\nyou're probably saying sorry,\neven when you don't need to.\nThe root of this impulse\ncan be a lack of self-love.\nYou may say sorry when you\nhaven't even done anything wrong,\nor when you're trying\nto take responsibility\nfor someone else's\nmistake, or for a problem\nthat you didn't cause\nor had any control over.\nOver-apologizing can come\nfrom fearing conflict,\nor when you're more focused\non other people's needs\nover your own.\nAccording to Sharon Martin,\na licensed psychotherapist,\nover-apologizing can also stem\nfrom your own sense of perfectionism.\nWhen you hold yourself to\nimpossibly high standards,\nyou constantly feel inadequate\nand feel the need to\napologize for every tiny thing\nthat you do imperfectly.\nWhen you lack self-love,\nyou lack the grace to cover yourself.\nNumber 4, you beat yourself\nup over your past failures\nand mistakes.\nDo you dwell on your past mistakes?\nAre you fraught with\nself doubt and needlessly\nkick yourself when you think\nof any of your past failures?\nThere are some deeply rooted reasons\nwhy your mind can't seem to\nquiet your inner self critic.\nAccording to Dr. Kristin Neff's book,\n\"Self-compassion, The Proven Power\nOf Being Kind To Yourself\",\nthe self critic in your mind\nperceives that past mistakes\nare equal to a real life danger,\nmaking you think that you're at risk\nof not being loved or accepted.\nYour self-critic falsely\ninforms you that the best way\nto motivate you is to beat\nyourself up for a mistake.\nDr. Neff goes on to explain\nthat while listening\nto this relentless\nself-criticism may see motivating\nin the short-term, it could\nactually be de-motivating\nin the long-term.\nSelf-compassion is a stronger tool,\nallowing you to acknowledge\na mistake and move forward\nrather than ruminating on it.\nSelf-compassion and\nself-love go hand in hand.\nAnd number 5, you second guess yourself\nand struggle to trust your own intuition.\nIf you're stuck in the mental loop\nof reliving your past mistakes,\nthis can also make it\nharder to trust in yourself.\nDo you question whether you're good enough\nor assume unnecessary blame?\nDo you retreat from the\nidea of a more connected\nand active lifestyle?\nStress management coach, Celestine Fedley\ndetails self-trust as a\nstep towards self-love.\nShe suggests getting to the\nbottom of what your fears are\nby asking yourself what\nyou're really scared of\nand taking time to silence your mind.\nSo you can lean into\nwhat your true feelings\nand desires are.\nDo you think you are\nstruggling with self-love?\nHow do you foster self-love in your life?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you have a friend or\nsomeone you care about\nwho seems to lack self-love,\nconsider sharing this video with them.\nThe studies and references used\nare listed in the description below.\nDon't forget to hit the\nLike and Subscribe button\nfor more Psych2Go videos.\nAnd turn on the notification\nbell icon to get
