    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back.\nSo, have you ever dated anyone?\nIf you haven't,\nyou may be thinking this is\nuncommon as compared to others,\nbut just because someone has dated\nmany people does not make\nthem a relationship expert.\nIt just means they have more experience.\nAnd experience doesn't always\nmean you'll have better odds\nat a successful relationship.\nCompatibility is one\nof the key ingredients\nto a healthy relationship.\nSo, many may ask you,\n\"Why haven't you dated\nso you can find your compatible match?\"\nWell, you have your reasons.\nOne, you know what you want.\nYou know exactly what\nyou want in a partner\nbecause you've experienced other types\nof healthy relationships\nthat set a good example.\nIt's not that you have\nincredibly high expectations,\nor maybe you do, but many people\nsimply know what they want\nand aren't surrounded by\nthe type of people they feel\nthey'd be compatible with\nfor all sorts of reasons.\nMaybe you're a homebody.\nMaybe you want someone\nwho likes certain things\nand hold certain values,\nbut you're never around\nthose types of people.\nIf you desire romance,\nfind a way to reach out\nto groups or communities\nthat do hold your values\nand interests and join them.\nYou never know when you might\nmeet someone you'd match with.\nNumber two, you don't know how to flirt.\nMany people are extremely shy.\nSome are just extremely introverted\nand don't seek as much social interaction.\nBut a lot of individuals simply don't know\nwhere to begin with flirting.\nRomance can be complicated.\nWhat if you can't pick up on social cues\nthat make it obvious someone\nis flirting with you?\nOr what if your version of\nflirting appears awkward\nor bizarre?\nBest advice, practice makes perfect.\nAnd when in doubt,\nit's a good idea to simply\nput yourself out there\nand flat out ask if the\nother party is interested\nif flirting fails.\nA simple,\n\"Would you like to go\nout on a date with me?\"\nis better than nothing.\nNumber three, you've experienced trauma.\nA reason many don't\ndate is that of trauma.\nEmotional or physical trauma\ncan have a lifelong impact\non you, and unhealed trauma can cause you\nto avoid certain situations if\nyou don't have to be in them.\nHealing from trauma can take time,\nbut you should also seek out help\nfrom a mental health\nprofessional or counselor\nif trauma is blocking\nyou from doing the things\nthat you want to do.\nNumber four, you're guarding your heart.\nA lot of people who have\nnever dated before tend\nto guard their feelings.\nThey may not want to open\nup and become vulnerable\nas dating can require.\nPast trauma can come into play with this,\nor simply situations and\nexperiences you've been through\nwhere you've been let down in the past.\nBut if you know you want\nto experience romance,\nyou'll have to confront the idea\nthat you'll have to open\nup your heart at a point.\nHow can we really get to know someone\nif we're not vulnerable\nand true to ourselves?\nIf you do get let down,\none way to look at it is\ngaining new life experience.\nMany people suffer from heartbreak,\nit's a part of life that many go through.\nIf you take the risk, it may be worth it.\nNumber five, you're a late bloomer.\nOne reason you haven't wanted to date,\nyou simply don't want to,\nand that's totally fine.\nYou shouldn't be rushed\nor feel the need to date out of pressure.\nIt should be dependent\non when you feel ready\nand it should ultimately be your choice.\nLove and attraction can be a\nbit hectic though at first,\nso it's best to know the difference\nbetween being uncomfortable out of fear\nof something you want, and\nsimply not being ready.\nIf you're uncomfortable\ndue to failed attempts\nat flirting or anxiety,\nknow that sometimes it's worth the risk\nto face your fears and do\nsomething that's uncomfortable.\nThe reward can be life-changing.\nNumber six, you've been too busy.\nYou're a full-time student.\nYou have two jobs and a pile\nof homework to complete.\nNo wonder you haven't dated anyone.\nCan anyone blame you?\nIt's not that you don't want to date,\nit's just that you don't\nhave any free time.\nWhen you can schedule time for\nself-love and social outings,\nyou'll feel less stressed,\nand likely balance your mental health.\nNumber seven, you don't get out much.\nDo you spend your days\nindoors enjoying the splendors\nof alone time?\nYou like to work out of the office,\ntalk to your friends on the phone,\nand enjoy your hobbies from\nthe comfort of your home.\nOoh, that kind of rhymed.\nOkay, so you may enjoy dating,\nbut you simply don't have the drive\nto get out of the house and meet people.\nIf you are ready to meet new people,\ntry to explore new activities\noutside of your home.\nJoin communities online,\nor meet others and socialize\nthrough social media.\nJust make sure they're a real person\nand don't get into an ice cream truck.\nAnd finally, number eight,\nyou're focused on yourself.\nMany who have never dated before\nsimply don't desire someone\nto join their lives\nbecause they're too focused on themselves.\nThey have serious goals and commitments\nthat make dating nearly impossible,\nor they're working on their self-love\nbefore they bring someone\nnew into their lives.\nOne of the most important\nthings you can practice\nin life is self-love.\nIf you love yourself,\nyou may just become ready to\nlove someone else as much,\nor at least date them first.\nSo, have you dated someone before,\nor maybe you're dating\nsomeone new to dating?\nIt's best to simply ask\nthem why if you're curious.\nAnd if you clicked this video\nbecause you are now ready to date,\nknow that age is just a number\nand your true match won't care\nif you haven't dated anyone before.\nIf there's someone you like,\nget out of your comfort zone and ask them.\nIf your poorly executed\npick up lines fail,\nplease just ask them.\nIf you found this video helpful,\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share this video with\nsomeone who might need it.\nSubscribe
