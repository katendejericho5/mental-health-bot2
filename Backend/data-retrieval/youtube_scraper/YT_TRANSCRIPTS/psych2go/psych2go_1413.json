    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Hey, Sancta goers,\nand welcome back to our channel.\nThank you so much for all\nthe love you've given us.\nYour ongoing support has\nhelped us make psychology\nand mental health, more\naccessible to everyone.\nSo thank you.\nNow let's continue.\nIn hindsight, have you\never wished you'd listened\nto that good piece of advice\nor wished you would have taken\nthat hard to swallow pill?\nMaybe if you had things that\nhave turned out a bit better,\nmaybe it was something like that,\nSAT doesn't determine the\nentire course of your life\nor being nice is sometimes more\nimportant than being right.\nNo matter what age or\nstage of life you're in,\nit's never too late to\nlearn some new tricks.\nHere are nine hard truths you\nneed to know to help you live\nwith as few regrets as possible.\nNumber one, you will never\nbe younger than you are now.\nThis is a simple truth.\nYou only have a certain\namount of time to live,\nbuild relationships and make\nthe difference you wanna make\nin the world.\nTaking action is one of\nthe most important things\nyou can do.\nDon't wait for the perfect\ntime or opportunity\nto present itself.\nYou already have what you\nneed to succeed, yourself.\nIf you wait too long,\nyou may find that the time\nfor action has passed.\nThis principle can be summed\nup to a quote from the famous\nBroadway Musical Hamilton.\nYou don't get a win unless\nyou play in the game,\nyou get loved for it, you get hate for it.\nYou get nothing if you wait for it.\nNumber two, life isn't a\nsafe, predictable formula.\nThere is no set rule\nbook on how to live life.\nDespite what you may have been\ntaught the regular graduate\nhigh school, get a degree\nand get a good job formula\ndoesn't guarantee you anything.\nWhile this particular formula\ndoes increase your chances\nof financial stability, it\ndoesn't guarantee your happiness.\nThere is no checking off X, Y, and Z,\nand then you're happy\nand fulfilled formula.\nLife is messy and uncontrollable at times,\nand it's far from perfect.\nSometimes you've got to dance\nto the beat of your own drama\nand follow your own path in life.\nNumber three, you can't have it all.\nNo one's life is perfect.\nIf you're looking to have an\namazing social life work-life\nand dive deep into your many hobbies,\nyou may end up stretching\nyourself way too thin.\nThe same concept applies\nif you're still in school,\nif you want a perfect GPA,\nactive social life and\namazing extracurriculars,\nchances are you're not going to feel good.\nTaking on too many responsibilities\nwill leave you stressed\nand overworked and take the enjoyment\nout of these activities.\nIt's important to prioritize\nwhat matters most to you\nwhile also keeping your limits in mind.\nIt may be difficult to\nlet go of some things,\nbut you'll probably realize\nhow much happier you are\nnow that you're not having\nto juggle 50 different things\nat once.\nNumber four, despite your expectations,\nnothing is ever as good\nor as bad as you think.\nOur minds have a tendency to\nblow things out of proportion.\nDid you ever fail a test\nand immediately think\nthat your life was over?\nThink back and reflect.\nDid that one failed test actually\naffect where you are now?\nChances are, that it didn't.\nWhen you care a lot about something,\nit makes you blow it out of proportion\nin relation to your life as a whole,\nwhether it's something good or bad,\nno one thing is going\nto dramatically improve\nor ruin your life.\nLife isn't about passing or failing.\nIt's a series of events and choices\nthat make up who you are.\nNumber five: the most\nimportant relationship\nis the one with yourself.\nThis is something that\ncan be hard to remember\nwith all the social pressures\nof being in a relationship\nand obligations to your\nfriends and family.\nHowever, it's very important to prioritize\nyour mental health.\nYou are important and\ndeserve to be treated well.\nThe people who don't recognize\nthis simply aren't worth\nfighting for, because\nat the end of the day,\nyou are the one constant in your life.\nAs uncle Iroh put it,\nIt's time for you to look\ninward and start asking yourself\nthe big question, who are\nyou and what do you want?\nNumber six, everyone has emotions\nand is a person just like you.\nWe often both idolize and\ntreat others as if they aren't\nhuman or deserve to be put on a pedestal.\nYou might think to yourself,\n\"Beyonce is perfect, she can't ever fail.\"\nAnd you might often think\nthis about celebrities\nor other people who lead such\ndifferent lives than yours,\nbecause they can seem so\ndifficult to relate to.\nBut if everyone expected\nyou to never make a mistake\nor treated you as if you\ndidn't have feelings,\nit was certainly brought a lot of pressure\nand strain on you.\nThe hard truth is that\nalthough some people seem\nuntouchable, they're complex,\nflawed humans who are going\nthrough hardships and blessings\nand change and growth, just like you.\nNumber seven, trust pays off.\nWhile trusting people is hard\nfor a lot of us more often\nthan not, it is worth it.\nBy opening yourself up on occasion,\nyou can lay down a foundation\nfor building meaningful\nand deep connections with people.\nBetrayal can hurt if it does happen,\nbut ultimately the many\nemotional benefits of trust\noutweigh those risks.\nBy assuming everyone is untrustworthy,\nyou block everyone off without\ngiving them a fair chance\nto be in your life.\nNumber eight, social media\naffect your mental health.\nIn this day and age,\nsocial media is a great\nway to stay connected\nand entertained.\nHowever, there is a stark difference\nbetween using social media as a way\nto gain inspiration, affirmation,\nand make connections,\nthen using it to compare\nyourself to others.\nIt is all too easy to\ncompare your lifestyle, body,\nand achievements to other people online,\ncomparing yourself to snapshots\nof someone else's greatest\nhighlights and achievements isn't healthy,\nespecially considering most\npeople only put their best,\nmost aesthetically pleasing\nand ultimately unrealistic\nversions of themselves online.\nWhen comparing yourself to those photos,\nit can make you feel like\nyou're not good enough\nor that your life doesn't amount\nto as much as theirs,\nsocial media can end up\ndoing more harm than good.\nSo if you need to take\na break from Instagram,\nyour mental health will thank you.\nAnd number nine, retirement\nshouldn't be your goal.\nWhile saving up for retirement\nand planning mindfully\nfor your future is a good thing,\nretirement shouldn't be your\nonly goal with your career.\nIf you're waiting around until the day,\nyou can finally retire,\nchances are it's not the\nright job or career for you.\nIf you spend most of\nyour week at your job,\nit should be something\nthat you enjoy doing\nand get fulfillment out of.\nThis principle is sure to help\nyou in deciding on a career\nand if you're already\nworking and now realize\nyou don't enjoy it, this\ntruth still applies.\nDo you relate to any of these truths?\nDo you think learning these\nnow will help you in the future\nwhile these may be hard to\nput into practice at first\nthey're truths that will\nultimately benefit you\nin the long run,\nwhile it may be too\nlate to change the past,\nit's not too late to change your future.\nPlease like and share this\nvideo if it helped you\nand you think it can\nhelp someone else, too.\nDon't forget to
