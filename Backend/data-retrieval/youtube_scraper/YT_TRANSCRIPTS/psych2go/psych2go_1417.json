    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Hey,\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nHaving fun together, being\nopen with one another,\nspending a lot of time with one another\nand sharing a deep, emotional\nconnection with someone.\nDoes that sound more like\na close friendship to you\nor a romantic relationship?\nThe answer could easily be both, right?\nAnd for a lot of us, the lines\nbetween love and friendship\ncan get blurry sometimes,\nand adding romantic feelings to the mix\ncan make things even more complicated.\nSo if you need some help figuring out\nwhere to draw the line in the sand\nbetween love and friendship,\nhere are eight signs\nthat tell you things\nbetween you and your friend\nare starting to become much\nmore romantic than platonic.\nNumber one, you daydream about them.\nDo you often jokingly\nsay you and your friend\nshould just date each other instead,\nor daydream about what it might be like\nto end up with them romantically?\nWell, it might seem like nothing more\nthan playful banter and\nlighthearted fun to you,\nthese romantic fantasies\nmight mean a lot more\nthan you think,\nespecially if you feel\nbutterflies fluttering\nin your stomach every\ntime you think about it.\nNumber two, you get\njealous of their partners.\nWell, it's understandable\nto have jealous feelings\ntowards your best friends,\nother friends from time to time.\nThe difference between platonic\nand romantic jealousy is clear.\nThe former stems from a fear\nof your friend leaving you behind,\nwhile the latter comes\nfrom the disappointment\nof having your romantic hopes dashed.\nSo if you find yourself feeling jealous\nof the romantic partners\nand love interests\nof your friend for more\nthan a platonic reason,\nit's time to take a\ngood, long look at why.\nAre you tired of swiping left and right,\nor maybe you're trying to\nfind love in the wrong place.\nNumber three, you can't wait to see them.\nBe honest, do you enjoy spending\ntime with your best friend\nmore than you do with your crushes?\nAre they your favorite person to hang out\nand make plans with by far?\nEnjoying your friend's company\nand looking forward to\nseeing them as one thing.\nBut eagerly, counting down the moments\nuntil you see each other\nis another thing entirely.\nAnd if you're dying to see this person\nat all hours of the day,\nthen it might be that\nwhat you feel for them\nis more than just friendship.\nNumber four, you want to\nbe more intimate with them.\nWhile emotional intimacy\nis certainly not uncommon\nto have in a close, meaningful friendship,\nwanting to be more\nintimate with this person\nis a sure sign as any,\nthat romantic feelings\nare already starting\nto blossom between you.\nAre you becoming more physically\naffectionate with them?\nDo you immediately turn\nto them for comfort,\neven when other people\ncan offer it to you,\nor have deep meaningful talks\nwith them almost every day?\nIf you answered yes to\nany of these questions,\nthen what you want might already\nbe more than just friendship.\nNumber five, you're overly affectionate.\nSimilar to the last point,\nif you find yourself acting more flirty\nthan friendly around this person,\nit's probably because\nyour feelings for them\nare starting to show,\neven if you don't realize\nthey're there yet.\nMore than ever before,\nyou wanna be close to them all the time,\nto hold their hand, to\nact sweet with them,\nto hug and kiss them as much\nas you can get away with,\nand to take just about any excuse\nto get to touch them\nand show them affection.\nNumber six, you talk\nabout them constantly.\nOne of the reasons why everyone else seems\nto be raising their eyebrows\nat your so-called\nfriendship with this person,\nis because they seem\nto be your favorite topic to talk about.\nYou can't say enough,\ngood things about them,\nand you're always sharing funny stories\nor fun memories you have with them.\nThen if you notice yourself\nconstantly finding ways\nto incorporate them into\nany conversation you can,\nwell, that doesn't take a dating expert\nto see that you're already\nfalling in love with your friend.\nNumber seven, you're not\ninterested in anyone else.\nAnother telltale sign that\nit's not just friendship,\nit's love, is if your friend becomes\nthe reason you're not\ninterested in anyone else.\nYou're no longer\ninterested in dating around\nor pursuing anything with anyone else\nbecause deep down inside,\nyou know this person\nis already everything that\nyou want in a partner.\nAnd the tricky part\nis whether you've already\nadmitted it to yourself or not.\nAnd number eight, it's never enough.\nFinally, but perhaps most importantly,\nif you find that no matter\nhow much time you spend\nwith your friend, it's never enough\nto make you stop missing\nthem and wanting to see them,\nthen you are definitely\ncatching feelings for them.\nNo doubt about it.\nAfter all, the fluttery\nfeeling in your heart\nevery time you're near them,\nthat desire to see them and\ntalk to them all the time,\nthe certainty that you\nwon't ever be sick of them,\nthose are all signs of newly found love.\nAnd though you might still\nthink of them as a friend,\nyou're definitely spending with them more\nthan you'd maybe like to admit.\nSo be honest.\nDo you relate to any of the\nsigns we've mentioned here?\nDo you think your friendship with someone\nis turning into something more romantic?\nIf so, opening up about it to this person\nwould be a good first step to take,\nespecially if you suspect they\nmight feel the same way too.\nPonder on the true\nmeaning of your feelings\nand think about what\nit is you really want,\nand where you'd like to go from here.\nThen once you're sure that this\nis something worth pursuing,\ndon't be afraid to make\nyour intentions clear.\nDid you find this video insightful?\nTell us in the comments\nbelow, please like,\nand share it with
