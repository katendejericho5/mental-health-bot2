    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nSo, perhaps you're in love with someone,\nand you're curious as to whether\nthey feel the same way about you,\nbut they haven't quite said\nthose three magic words.\nWhat's holding them back?\nMaybe they haven't yet\nfallen in love with you?\nBut they appear to like you enough\nthat love could be on the horizon.\nWell, there are a few\npsychological secrets\nthat can boost the likelihood\nof love in your future.\nWhat are they, you may ask.\nWatch to find out.\nHere are six psychological secrets\nto make anyone fall\ndeeply in love with you.\nNumber one, make good eye contact.\nHarvard psychologist Zick\nRubin conducted a study\nwhere he recorded how much time lovers\nwould spend looking\ninto each other's eyes.\nHe found that individuals\nwho are not in love\nlooked at each other\n30 to 60% of the time,\nwhile those couples deeply in love,\nthey stared into each other's eyes\n75% of the time when talking,\nand when someone else entered\nthe room or interrupted them,\nthey were much slower to turn away\nfrom their partner's gaze.\nA little secret to really getting someone\nto consider these\nfeelings of love for you,\nlook into their eyes 75% of the time.\nThe brain remembers the last time\nsomeone they loved stared\nat them in the same way.\nThey will associate this\nstair with feelings of love.\nWhy?\nThis lovely memory causes a\nrelease of phenethylamine,\nwhich is known as a love drug.\nPhenylethylamine is released in the brain\nwhen someone falls in love.\nThe chemical too mimics\nthe brain chemistry\nof someone who is deeply in love.\nChocolate contains phenylethylamine,\nwhich is probably why it's historically\nbeen considered an aphrodisiac.\nIt's also probably the reason\nwe love chocolate so much.\nNumber two, choose a date\nlocation with dim lights.\nWhen deciding the location\nof your next date,\nit might be a good idea to pick\na location with dim lighting.\nIn a significant research study\npublished in the journal\nScientific American,\nresearchers showed male subjects\ntwo photographs of the same woman.\nIn one of the images, researchers changed\nthe size of her pupils\nto be faintly larger,\nwhile the other image is adjusted\nso that she had smaller peoples.\nNone of the men reported\nnoticing this slight change,\nbut the men described the woman\nwith small pupils as\ncold, hard, and selfish.\nThe woman with larger pupils was described\nas soft, more feminine, and pretty.\nMany further studies\nhave had similar results.\nWhen it comes to women's\npreferences on pupil's size,\nstudies suggest that they\nare similar in some ways.\nFindings appear to suggest\nthat women who are attracted\nto nice guys are attracted\nto medium-sized pupils,\nwhile those who like bad boys\nare attracted to larger pupils.\nWell, obviously we can't\ncontrol the size of our pupils,\nbut dimming the lights will expand them.\nA romantic candlelight dinner,\nand your partner may feel\neven more attraction for you,\nespecially if there's chocolate involved.\nNumber three, don't be afraid to smile.\nWhen you feel like smiling,\ndon't be afraid to let\nthose pearly whites show.\nA study published in the Bulletin\nof the Psychonomic Society\nfound smiling might just\nmake you more likable.\nAccording to the study, women\nin the experiment who smiled\n70% of the time were seen as\nmore interpersonally attractive\nthan women who seldom smiled.\nSo, while you may think\na good old lip pout\nis the way to go, a\nsmile maybe even better.\nNumber four, casually touch them often.\nIn an experiment from the\nUniversity of Mississippi\nand Rhodes College,\nresearchers had waitresses\nbriefly touch customers\non the hand or shoulders\nin a controlled yet natural setting.\nThe waitresses who casually\ntouch their customers\nwhen returning change received\na significantly larger tip\nthan those who did not.\nAnother study published\nin Psychologically Press,\nTaylor & Francis group had\nmen stand on the corner\nof a street and attempt to talk\nto women who would walk by.\nThe men were more successful\nin starting a conversation\nwith the women when they lightly touched\nthe woman on the forearm for one second.\nAs the researchers state,\nour results showed that a\nman's courtship solicitations\nare more favorably accepted by a woman\nwhen the request is accompanied\nby light tactile contact.\nAnd intimate touch on the arm here\nand caress there may\njust leave your partner\neven more romantically drawn to you.\nNumber five, have meaningful discussions\nabout yourself and them.\nResearch from Harvard found\nthat deep conversations\nand meaningfully talking about yourself\ncan help activate the very\nsame regions of your brain\nthat delicious food or sex activates.\nThis study states that\nover a 45 minute period,\nsubjects paired carried\nout self-disclosure\nand relationship building tasks\nthat gradually escalated in intensity.\nStudy one found greater\npost interaction closeness\nwith these tasks versus\ncomparable small talk tasks,\nso while small talk is\nfine every now and then,\nwhen you're on a romantic date,\na more meaningful discussion\nmay excite them more,\nyou know, more than the weather.\nWhen you both open up and\nreveal your true emotions,\nyour partner may fall in\nlove with the deep, engaging\nconversations you have together instead.\nAnd number six, have\na good sense of humor.\nEverybody loves to laugh,\nand a little sense of humor\ncan heighten any relationship.\nResearchers from Illinois State University\nand DePaul University found in their study\nthat when you use humor\nwhen getting to know an\nacquaintance at first,\nthat individual has a better\nchance of liking you more.\nThey even found that\nengaging in funny tasks\nmay raise romantic attraction.\nHmm, sounds like a fun\ndate may be the way to go.\nCracking a joke under dim\ncandlelight with chocolate,\n(chuckles) they may just\nfall in love with you.\nSo, do you see love in your\nfuture with these habits?\nWho are you in love with?\nShare with us your story\nin the
