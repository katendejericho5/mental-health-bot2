    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2goers.\nJust over 40 years ago,\nautism was first recognized\nas a distinct diagnosis in the DSM-III.\nSince then, awareness of autism\nhas become widespread among the public,\nand thankfully, most of this\nhas been respectful and positive.\nUnfortunately, there have\nalso been unscientific myths\nabout autism that exploit\nsome people's confusion and anxiety.\nThese contribute to negative\nstigma and make it harder\nfor autistic people to truly be understood\nand flourish in society.\nHave you fallen prey\nto any of these myths?\nThere's also a part two to this video\nwith five more myths about autism.\nWith that said, here are\nfive myths about autism,\nwritten by our autistic specialist writer\nand based on research\nin the most common myths\namong the public.\nNumber one, the epidemic myth.\nThere's a strange misconception\nabout a so-called autism epidemic.\nOver the years, awareness of autism\nhas increased dramatically\namong health professionals,\nauthorities, schools,\nparents, and the media.\nAutistic children who\nwere previously overlooked\nare now getting correctly diagnosed,\nleading to growing estimates\nof the autistic population.\nInitially, one in 150 American children\nwere estimated to be\non the autism spectrum.\nBut now, the estimate is one in 59,\nwhich is closer to reality.\nAn anxious mind without\na full understanding\nmight see this increase and\njump to the illogical conclusion\nthat something is spreading.\nBut the only thing that's\nspreading is knowledge.\nThere's an epidemic of\nawareness, recognition, respect,\nand support for autistic individuals.\nAnd that's nothing to be anxious about.\nNumber two, the vaccine myth.\nHave you ever seen someone make up\ncompletely fake data for an assignment?\nSadly, even some professional scientists\nhave fabricated data.\nIn the late 1990s, a\npersonal injury lawyer\npursuing a case against\na vaccine manufacturer\nfunded a fraudulent study\nto discredit the vaccine.\nThis study was led by Andrew Wakefield,\nwho fabricated medical\nhistories for some children\nwho had received the vaccine\nmentioned in the lawsuit.\nIn reality, most of the\nchildren had autistic symptoms\nat a completely different\ntime from the vaccination,\nand some of them didn't\neven have autism at all.\nBut Wakefield manipulated\nor completely invented\ntheir medical histories\nto suggest a false connection\nbetween autism symptoms and the vaccine.\nSome parents of autistic\nchildren then fell prey\nto confusing correlation with causation.\nAutistic symptoms usually\nbecome noticeable in childhood\nand vaccination is also\ncommon in childhood.\nParents who already had\nthe idea in their minds\nfalsely assumed a causation\nbetween the two events,\njust because they happened\nat a similar time,\nwhen it was actually a coincidence\nand would have happened anyway.\nOver the past 20 years, every\nresearcher around the world\nwho has investigated rates of autism\nhave found no difference\nbetween vaccinated\nand unvaccinated children.\nThere's not a single\nstudy to back up the myth\nother than Wakefield's original study,\nwhich was investigated by the\nUK's General Medical Council\ndeclared to be fraudulent and retracted.\nNumber three, the parenting myth.\nBefore there was robust evidence\nabout the causes of autism,\nsome people came to\ncompletely baseless confusions\nbased on their personal preoccupations.\nIn 1967, school director Bruno\nBettelheim was interested\nin the social isolation\nof his autistic pupils,\nand made a bizarre comparison\nwith the emotional detachment he witnessed\nwhen he was a prisoner in\na Nazi concentration camp.\nObviously, these two situations\nare light years apart\nand people can be socially isolated\nfor many different reasons.\nHowever, Bettelheim was convinced\nof his own baseless idea\nand wrote a book suggesting\nthat a lack of affection\ncreated autism itself.\nThis suggestion had\nabsolutely no evidence,\nbut some families who were confused\nor anxious about an autism diagnosis\nfound it natural to latch\nonto a false explanation\nthat had an easy blame attached.\nNow that we know more\nabout the causes of autism,\nwe can safely say that this is a myth.\nThe scientific reality is that autism\ncomes from a variety of\ngenetic and prenatal factors.\nParents of autistic children\nare already under a lot of\npressure to do the right thing,\nand they don't need extra\nstigma on top of that.\nNumber four, the cure myth.\nTemple Grandin, one of the most prominent\nanimal scientists in the world,\nhas emphasized that her\nautism is directly responsible\nfor her success in the field.\nAutistic traits like\nhyperfocus, attention to detail,\nand unique perspective are\nbenefits for us to nurture.\nUnfortunately, some have misguided focus\non only the difficulties\nand a misunderstanding of medical terms\nlike cause, symptom, and support.\nThis flawed framing has sometimes led\nto an inappropriate\nborrowing of the term cure,\nbut there's nothing to cure.\nFamilies experiencing stress\nwhen raising autistic children\ncan latch on to false hopes.\nThe nature of autism is a permanently\ndifferent structural wiring of the brain\nthat couldn't and shouldn't be eliminated.\nThe lives of autistic people\nare definitely filled with challenges,\nbut this is caused by a lack\nof genuine understanding\nand support for autistic traits,\nnot necessarily the traits themselves.\nAnd number five, the savant myth.\nHave you ever questioned your own worth\nand abilities from time to time?\nAutistic people are no different.\nMedia portrayals of autistic individuals\ntry to create a positive impression,\nand we're glad about that.\nHowever, these intentions\ncan actually backfire\nif the portrayals are too\nskewed compared to reality.\nExcessive focus on those\nwith savant abilities,\nsuch as exceptional mathematical skills,\ncan disregard and devalue\nthose who don't have such abilities.\nAs we mentioned with the\ncase of Temple Grandin,\nthe real benefits of autism\ncome from unique perceptions.\nThe autistic mind has\na heightened awareness\nof certain patterns and details,\nbut these don't always appear\nin dramatic or extreme ways.\nAutistic people have\nreported feeling judged\nwhen their abilities don't\nmatch unrealistic expectations.\nSo there you have it,\nfive myths about autism.\nThe next time you see\na claim about autism,\npause for a second and reflect\non whether it might be a misconception\nbefore deciding to accept it or not.\nEven better, like and share this video\nto help spread correct\nand respectful knowledge\nabout autism in society.\nResearch shows that\nprebunking misinformation\nis more effective than debunking,\nmeaning that it's best\nto spread corrections\nthroughout the public before\nthe misconceptions reach them.\nYou can help us with that.\nDid you find this video valuable?\nTell us in the comments below.\nPlease like and share it with friends\nthat might find use in the video, too.\nMake sure to
