    "transcript": "- [Mithrilda] Hi,\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nHave you ever wished for\nmore people to respect you?\nIt may seem impossible\nto get everyone to see\nyou in a positive light,\nbut there are a few ways\nyou can increase your odds.\nHere are six things that make\nothers respect you instantly.\nOne, stop over apologizing.\nDo you constantly say\nsorry over little things\nlike asking a question, or\nfor simply being who you are?\nIf yes, you could be turning others off.\nOver apologizing hints to others\nthat you don't have much self-respect,\nwhich makes it hard for\nthem to respect you as well.\nThis doesn't mean stop\napologizing outright,\nbut take responsibility when your actions\nhave let someone down,\nbut don't apologize for your identity,\npersonality, and things you can't control.\nTwo, be brave enough to\nsay when enough's enough.\nDo you often let people\ntake advantage of you?\nCompassion, empathy, and caring for others\nare an important part\nof a person's good side.\nHowever, you should be able to draw a line\nwhen someone has crossed a boundary,\neven if that means fighting back.\nAsserting yourself gives\na positive impression\nto people who are worth your time.\nIf someone still continues\nto disrespect you,\nbe ready to walk away, and\npreserve your own mental health.\nThis way, the quality of your inner circle\nwill be much better.\nThree, don't be a know-it-all.\nDo others strike you as someone\nwho arrogantly tells people\nwhat's right and wrong without\nconsidering their opinions?\nGetting your facts wrong\ncan be embarrassing,\nbut showing off,\nand trying to be the center of attention\ncan also cause people to disrespect you.\nRegardless of how much you know,\nthere's always someone\nwho knows more than you,\nand that's okay.\nYou don't have to one\nup other people's ideas,\nand dismiss them.\nInstead, being able to ask questions,\nhaving an openness to new things,\nand knowing when to share ideas with them\nwill gain you more respect.\nFour, stand up for others.\nWhat would you do have\na friend or stranger\nis being mistreated by someone you know?\nWould you help them?\nBeing able to help others\nmakes you someone who's worthy of respect.\nThis shows that you care for others,\nand aren't willing to\njust sit around and wait\nwhen someone is in a bad spot.\nIt also shows that you're bold,\nand can act in the face of resistance,\nor social persecution,\nand that's respect-worthy.\nFive, be respectful in return.\nTo gain respect, you should\nrespect others in return.\nRespect isn't just for people\nin positions of authority.\nIt extends to all humans,\nregardless of their place\non the social ladder.\nIf you disrespect the\nwaiter in the restaurant,\nyou'll give off the impression\nthat you regard them as inferior to you.\nThis can turn off anyone\nwho has a moral code.\nIf you ruthlessly tease\nfriends and they get fed up,\nthey could end up not\nassociating with you anymore.\nAnd besides, how could\nanyone respect a person\nwho doesn't respect them back?\nSix, don't gossip.\nHave you ever had someone you know\ntalk badly behind your back?\nIt must've stung, right?\nThe same can apply to people\non the other side of the stick.\nIf you talk badly about someone to others,\nthose words could fall on the wrong ears.\nAnd all of a sudden,\nyou could find yourself\nhaving it turned back on you.\nThat's why it's best not to gossip,\nespecially to strangers or\nacquaintances you don't know.\nOn the other hand,\ntalking positively about others\ncan be beneficial for everyone,\nand people will regard\nyou as a positive person.\nWhat are your thoughts?\nShare them in the comments below,\nand share this video with\npeople who might benefit.\nAs always, the references and studies\nare shown in the description below.\nThat's all for now, until next time."
