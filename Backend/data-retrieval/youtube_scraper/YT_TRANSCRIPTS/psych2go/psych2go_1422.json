Zajonc,\nthe mere exposure effect is\na psychological phenomenon\nin which people find\nthemselves preferring someone,\nor something simply because\nthey developed familiarity with them.\nWhen a person is repeatedly\nexposed to a certain stimuli\nthat person develops\nfamiliarity with the stimuli,\nand therefore prefers its presence.\nThis is why certain products and ads\nare constantly being repeated\nduring your favorite\nprogramming's commercial breaks.\nThe more familiar you are with something,\nthe more you'll start to notice it.\nNumber three, show you are\ncapable and intelligent,\nbut still human.\nDid you know surprisingly\nmost people don't like someone\nwho is perfect?\nWhy you may ask?\nWell, people can get intimidated\nby those who apparently\ncome across as too perfect.\nA researcher from the University of Texas\nfound that if you make some mistakes,\nbut still show that\nyou are and intelligent\nit may make others see\nyou as more attractive.\nIn this study researcher Elliot Aronson,\nhad people rate fake test takers\nbased on their attractiveness.\nTest would either do great on\na test, mediocre, or poorly.\nNow some test takers would act clumsy,\nand spell coffee at the\nend of an interview,\nafter their scores were revealed.\nPeople rated the test takers\nwho spilled coffee at the\nend of their interview\nthe highest on the attractiveness scale.\nMeaning people want to see you\nare intelligent and capable,\nbut that you aren't perfect.\nThey want to see your human side.\nBut when you show your capable,\nand yet still relatable as a human being\nwho makes the stakes people\ntend to like you more.\nNumber four, show your positive side.\nPeople enjoy being around\npeople who are happy.\nIf someone's encounters\nwith you are mostly positive\nthey will start to associate\npositive emotions with you,\nand might even fall for you.\nThe thing is if someone is happy\nand sticks to that emotion,\nothers around them will\nstart feeling better as well.\nA research paper from\nthe University of Hawaii,\nand Ohio State University\nsuggests that many individuals\ncan unconsciously tell what mood you're in\njust by being around you.\nSeems fair, right?\nSo if you're in a good\nmood emit that energy,\nbring out your positive chi,\nwhoever you're around will\nlikely sense your mood,\nand start to feel happier around you too.\nNumber five, where the color red.\nIn an experiment published\nby the European Journal\nof Social Psychology,\nresearchers found men are\nmore likely to be attracted\nto the color red on women.\nIn the experiment men were tasked\nwith asking questions to women.\nWomen quilts in red and\nwomen clothed in blue.\nThe men chose to ask the women in red.\nIn a second experiment\nmen chose to sit closer\nto women in red versus the women in blue.\nAs the research paper states\nresearch shows from the first time\nthat color influences men's\nbehavior towards women\nin the romantic realm.\nColor specifically red appears to serve\nas a basic, non-lexical prime\nthat can influence important,\nreproduction-relevant behavior\nin similar fashion across species.\nSo next time go out on a date\nbring out the red outfit.\nAnd number six, make a\ngood first impression.\nIt's no secret that first\nimpressions leave a lasting mark.\nAccording to a study\npublished in the journal\nof Social Psychological\nand Personality Science,\nfirst impressions from\na photograph of someone\ncan influence another's judgment of them\neven after they've met.\nIn the study people would evaluate others\nbased on their photograph\nand then meet them.\nThe first impression\nthrough the photograph\ninfluenced the individual's\njudgment at the person\neven after they met them formally.\nSo when you do decide\nto muster up the courage\nto ask your crush out,\nit's important to leave\na lasting impression,\na good one.\nIt's a good start for one,\nand sooner or later they\nmay just be falling for you.\nSo, not being late to first meetings,\nand admitting that positive chi is key.\nWe hope we were able to\ngive you a little insight\ninto some of the ways\nthat can help you catch\nthat special someone's attention.\nWhich trick would you like to try?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video interesting\nbe sure to hit the like\nand subscribe button,\nand share it with those looking\nto impress their special someone.\nThanks for watching and we'll see you."
