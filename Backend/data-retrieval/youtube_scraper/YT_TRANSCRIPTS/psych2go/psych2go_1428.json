    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nThank you all so much for the\nlove that you've given us.\nYour ongoing support to\nus does make psychology\nand mental health more\naccessible to everyone.\nSo thank you.\nNow, let's continue.\nHave you been through a\ntraumatic event in your life?\nAre you possibly struggling\nto heal from this event?\nAn estimated 70% of adults in the US\nhave experienced at\nleast one traumatic event\nduring their lifetime.\nTraumatic events include any\nform of abuse, road accidents,\nmedical emergencies,\ninvasive medical procedures,\nnatural disasters, social\nunrest, loss, grief,\nand cultural, intergenerational,\nand historical trauma.\nThe lasting effects of trauma\ninclude negative self-talk\nand low self-esteem.\nTo help you become more aware of yourself,\nhere are six harmful beliefs about trauma\nthat can hurt your mental health.\nAs a quick disclaimer,\nwe wanted to let you know\nthat this video is for\ninformative purposes only\nand is not meant to diagnose PTSD.\nIf you think you need help,\nreaching out to a mental health\nprofessional is important.\nOkay, let's begin.\nNumber one, you are defined by a past.\nIt's easy to compare your\ncurrent self to the person\nyou were before the\ntraumatic event happened.\nIf a traumatic event happened\nover a long period of time,\nlike in an abusive relationship,\nit can be hard to\nseparate your personality\nfrom the things you did to adapt\nduring the traumatic event.\nBut while this traumatic event will always\nbe a part of your story.\nYou're not wholly defined\nby what happened to you.\nSpending too much time reliving your past\nis what limits your ability to heal, grow,\nand work towards building your future.\nNumber two, your trauma makes\nyou think you're damaged.\nAnother common harmful belief\nis that your trauma makes you damaged.\nThis mentality is toxic\nbecause it devalues\nthe parts of your identity\noutside of your trauma\nand equates trauma with brokenness\nwhen it's really a normal reaction\nto an extremely stressful situation.\nAlthough, you will never\nbe the person you were\nbefore you experienced\nthe traumatic event,\nthat doesn't mean you'll never heal.\nIt's important to remember that\nyou don't have to go through\nyour healing journey alone.\nYou can seek help from friends and family,\nsupport groups, or a licensed therapist.\nNumber three, you think\nyou have to carry with you\nthe shame of your mistakes.\nAfter a traumatic event, it's\neasy to replay your actions\nin your mind and blame\nthe negative outcomes\nof a complex situation on your mistakes.\nAnd while taking\naccountability for your actions\nso that you can better\nlearn from them is good.\nWorrying and obsessing over your mistakes\ncan lead to a fear of\nfailure, avoidance behaviors,\nand even slower recovery from PTSD\nor other traumatic effects.\nSo, while guilt is a normal\npart of the trauma response,\nit's vital to remember that\nyou can't change the past,\nno matter how much you want to.\nBeating yourself up over common mistakes\ncan take a toll on your mental health.\nEveryone makes mistakes.\nIt's how you learn from\nthem and act on them\nin the future that matters.\nNumber four, you think\nyour trauma or mistakes\nare what keeps others from loving you.\nHealing from trauma is\nemotionally exhausting.\nThings may trigger you unexpectedly.\nYou may get frustrated with yourself,\nor you may feel worthless,\nand struggle with self-confidence.\nThe healing process isn't a straight line\nand it's normal to have\nsetbacks and bad days\nwhere it feels like you\nhaven't made any progress.\nAll these experiences can make you feel\nlike you're difficult to love\nor like your significant other\ndeserve someone who's unbroken by trauma.\nThis mentality is harmful\nbecause it puts unattainable expectations\non yourself that you\nthink you need to meet\nbefore you're able to accept love.\nThis can lead to trust\nissues and self sabotaging\nyour relationships.\nNumber five, you think\nwhat happened to you\nhas to dictate your future.\nThere's no denying that\nevents from your past\ninfluence your present opportunities.\nSome paths may be closed off to you\nbecause of traumatic events\nthat you've lived through.\nFor example, if you were\ncheated on by a lover,\nyou may never be able to\nfully trust them again.\nMourning the future you could have had\nis part of the grieving process.\nAnd it's also part of the\nhealing process from trauma.\nBut if you find yourself\nthinking that you can't achieve\nyour goals because of your\ntrauma and the effects\nof traumatic event, you\nmay be self sabotaging\nyour chances and the future you want.\nAnd number six, you think your\ntrauma makes you less worthy.\nFinally, thinking that your\npast makes you less worthy\ncan also harm your mental health.\nLiving through traumatic\nexperiences might leave you\nfeeling like there's\nsomething wrong with you\nor that the trauma was somehow your fault.\nDuring the healing\nprocess, it sometimes feels\nlike you'll never be whole again.\nAnd it can be easy to fall\ninto unhealthy comparisons\nbetween yourself and\nother trauma survivors\nor even people who've\nnever experienced trauma.\nThese thoughts are harmful\nbecause they base your self-worth\non your past experiences and\nnot your personal progress\nand intrinsic worth.\nJust because you're dealing\nwith the effects of trauma\ndoes not mean you're\nundeserving of opportunities\nor have less to contribute\nthan those who have never\nhad a traumatic experience.\nTraumatic experiences shaped your life\nand the lives of the people around you.\nIf you've been through a traumatic event\nor are currently processing your emotions\nand trauma responses, know\nthat you are not alone.\nSeeking help from a licensed\nmental health professional,\nsupport group, or other communities\nare great options if you need support\non your healing journey.\nDo you relate to any of these beliefs\nmentioned in this video?\nI did.\nLet us turn the comments below\nand don't forget to like\nand share this
