    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hello,\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nDo you ever worry about how your words\ncan impact your child?\nThe way you nurture your children\ncan heavily impact their mental\nand emotional development,\nand follow them into adulthood.\nSo if you're wondering what you can say\nthat would be helpful for your children,\nhere are seven phrases\nthat children need to\nhear from their parents.\nIf you're a child watching this video\nand found it relatable,\nbe sure to share this video\nwith your parents too.\nNumber one, \"I liked how you...\"\nDid your child do something\nthat you wanna praise?\nSaying blanket statements\nlike, \"I'm proud of you,\"\nor \"You're a smart kid,\"\ncan turn into white noise\nif said too often, leaving little effect.\nInstead, phrases that\nfocus on how they achieved\ntheir accomplishment\ncan be more beneficial\nand long-lasting.\nBeing more specific with your validations,\nsuch as by saying, \"I'm\nproud you got an A.\n\"You must've studied very hard,\"\nor \"I like how you picked up the trash\n\"and made everything tidy\"\ncan help them better\nunderstand and reflect\non the positive result of their actions.\nNumber two, \"Your\nsibling looks up to you.\"\nDo you have several children?\nOlder siblings at a younger\nage can feel jealous\nand act out once their younger sibling\nstarts getting more attention than them.\nInstead of telling them\nto stop misbehaving,\nDr. Katherine Carsey,\na child psychologist,\nsuggests that a more effective\nmethod would be to praise\nthe older siblings and highlight\ntheir role in the family.\nSaying something like, \"Your\nyounger brother or sister,\n\"really looks up to you.\"\nin a genuine way can give them\na feeling of responsibility\nand validation without the tension.\nNumber three, \"Although\nwhat you did made me angry,\n\"I still love you.\"\nHow do you deal with bad behavior?\nWhether it's throwing tantrums,\ndisrespecting teachers,\nor not doing chores.\nParents can be reasonably mad or hurt\nover their child's actions.\nWhile some children at a young age\ndon't understand the\nseverity of their actions,\nthey may suffer long-term consequences\nand feel like a disgrace if\ntheir parents use hurtful words\nlike, \"I'm ashamed of you,\",\nor \"I'm disappointed in you.\"\nInstead, you can apply a more\nloving approach by expressing\nyour concerns while still\nmaking them feel valued\nby saying the phrase above.\nNumber four, \"Let's\nwork on this together.\"\nHas your child ever encountered\na difficult challenge?\nHow did you respond to it?\nWhen a child fails to get something right,\nlike tying their shoes,\nit can be tempting as\nparents to do it for them.\nBut by doing this,\nyou're promoting a habit\nwhere they become highly dependent on you\nand lack the confidence to\ndo things by themselves.\nNot extending help isn't the\nright course of action either.\nInstead, you can guide\nthem by telling them\nwhat they should do to get\nthem to achieve their goal.\nBe by their side and\nwork on the task together\nwhile allowing them to exert\ndecent amounts of effort\nso they can feel proud of what they did.\nNumber five, \"Playtime's almost over.\n\"Should I wait one minute or two?\"\nWhat do you say when you want\nyour child to do something?\nInstead of just telling them\nwhat you want them to do,\nit may be more efficient and\neffective to let them choose\nbetween two options.\nThis doesn't apply to\njust playtime as well,\nbut for other things too,\nlike choosing to eat\nbetween two vegetables\nor what time to go to the dentist.\nif a parent does the opposite\nand gives them commands,\nsuch as by saying things\nlike, \"We're leaving now.\",\nor, \"You have to finish everything\nbefore you get to play.\",\nthey may end up putting up a fight\nand refuse to give into your wishes.\nNumber six, \"I'm listening.\"\nHow does it feel when you're always\ntalked over and lectured?\nFor children or young\nadults, lecturing them\nmay not always come across\nas helpful or motivating.\nIt could even lead to the opposite effect\nand worsen their mental health.\nInstead, giving your child your attention\nand listening to what they have to say\ncan nurture a healthier two way street\nbetween you and your child.\nBy lending an open ear, you\ndeepen your bond with them\nand boost your kids'\nself-esteem, giving them the idea\nthat their thoughts and ideas\nare important and valid.\nAnd number seven, \"Mind\nshowing me how you did that?\"\nHas your child done something\nthat they're really proud of?\nWhether they've solved a Rubik's cube,\nperformed a cool magic trick,\nor planted some flowers\nseeds in the garden,\nshowing encouragement\nand praise to your child\nhelps improve their\nconfidence and sense of self.\nEven if the results weren't\nparticularly impressive,\npraising them for their\neffort can motivate your child\nand give them the optimistic\nmindset that helps them\ntake on future challenges\nwith esteem and confidence.\nDid you find any of these phrases helpful?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nAlso be sure to like,
