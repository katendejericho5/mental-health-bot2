    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nBefore we start, we'd\nlike to thank you all\nfor the support that you've given us.\nPsych2Go's mission is to make\npsychology and mental health\nmore accessible to everyone,\nand you help us do that.\nSo, thanks again.\nNow, back to the video.\nDo you feel tired (yawns) all the time?\nAre you exhausted every single day?\nPeople tend to focus on\ntheir physical wellbeing\nmuch more than their emotional wellbeing.\nAfter all, it's much easier to focus\non something you can see\nrather than something you can't,\nsuch as emotions and feelings.\nAs a result, you may have a tendency\nto neglect your mental\nand emotional health.\nOne of the most common\nconsequences of this\nis experiencing emotional exhaustion,\nwhich is defined as a state\nof feeling emotionally drained\nand worn out as a result\nof accumulated stress.\nSo, to make sure you know\nwhat to watch out for,\nhere are six surprising things\nthat can emotionally drain you.\nNumber one, rumination.\nDo you spend a lot of your\ntime dwelling in the past?\nWhen you spend most of\nyour time ruminating,\nyou may end up falling\ninto an unhealthy habit\nof constantly overthinking\nthings you have no control of.\nPerhaps you've regretted\ndoing something in the past,\nor feel guilty for a missed opportunity.\nWhatever it is, rumination can\nleave you emotionally drained\nbecause you keep revisiting\nbad memories and feelings\nthat increase your stress levels.\nResearch has even shown that rumination\ncan be associated with anxiety,\ndepression, PTSD, and more.\nNumber two, repressing your emotions.\nDo you tend to ignore your\nfeelings until they disappear?\nThere have been many studies\nshowing that repressing your emotions\ncan actually be damaging\nfor your physical and mental wellbeing.\nA study conducted by the\nHarvard School of Public Health\nand the University of Rochester in 2013\nshowed that people who repress emotions\nhave a 30% increase in the chance\nof premature death from all causes.\nWhile ignoring your emotions\ncan seem like a good answer\nto avoid feeling sad or angry,\nthe actual effect it\nwill have is the opposite\nsince repressing emotions\ncan make them stronger,\nas found in a study conducted\nby the University of Texas.\nNumber three, having a victim mentality.\nAre you someone who believes\nthat nothing is going to change\nno matter how hard you try?\nDo you have a habit of blaming\nother people or circumstances\nfor how things are going for you?\nIf you believe in these first two ideas,\nand that bad things will happen\nand keep happening to you\nregardless of what you do,\nthen you may suffer from\nhaving a victim mentality.\nThese beliefs often result\nin developing a habit\nof avoiding responsibilities,\nrefusing to look for solutions,\nand having a general\nsense of powerlessness,\nwhich contributes to emotional exhaustion.\nNumber four, focusing on\nthings out of your control.\nDo you spend a lot of your time and energy\ntrying to control the things around you?\nWhile being in control of\neverything may give you a feeling\nthat you're able to\nprevent it from happening,\nthe only thing it may actually accomplish\nis to place additional pressure and stress\non your emotional and physical wellbeing.\nApart from that, you may also end up\nwasting the time and effort you have\nto spend on things you\nactually have control over.\nNumber five, toxic positivity.\nAre you someone who forces\nyourself to be happy\neven though you're clearly\nfeeling the opposite?\nIf you do this all the time,\nno matter the situation,\nthen you're probably\nexperiencing toxic positivity.\nAs someone trying to be in\na happy state all the time,\nyou may have a tendency to deny,\nminimize or invalidate your true emotions\nwhenever they're not\nin line with happiness.\nThe results are similar\nto that of suppressing your emotions.\nSince the excessive amount of positivity\nis used to hide or repress emotions\nsuch as jealousy, sadness,\nanger, and others.\nThe increased stress\nthat comes along with it\nmay ultimately lead to emotional\nand physical exhaustion.\nNumber six, saying yes\nto people too frequently.\nAre you someone who\naccepts extra work shifts,\neven though you're\nalready working overtime?\nOr volunteers to help\nsomeone with their homework,\neven though you're busy\nenough with your own?\nWhile saying yes to people\nand helping them is great,\ntoo much of anything can become unhealthy.\nSaying yes too frequently\nwill inherently put additional stress\non your emotional and physical wellbeing\nand lead to exhaustion or burnout.\nIt's why it's important to remember\nto prioritize your health\nand to take care of yourself first\nbefore focusing on other people.\nSo, do any of these points\nsound familiar to you?\nIf so, what strategies would you use\nto restore your emotional wellbeing?\nIf you
