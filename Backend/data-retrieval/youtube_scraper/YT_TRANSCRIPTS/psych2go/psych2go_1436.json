    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2goers, welcome back.\nWhat do you think makes a parent toxic?\nMost people would say\nit's being narcissistic and controlling,\nwhile others might answer\nbeing too harsh and overly critical.\nAbuse, be it physical,\nmental, or emotional,\nand neglect certainly plays a big part too\nin what you would consider toxic.\nBut what about some of the less obvious\nand easy to spot signs?\nWhat about the red flags so subtle\nwe don't even see them?\nLet's talk about it.\nHere are seven subtle signs\nyour parent may be toxic.\nNumber one, they're unsupportive\nand don't believe in you.\nHave your parents ever been unsupportive\nof something you wanted to do\nor discouraged you from doing\nthe things that make you happy?\nDo they belittle your dreams\nand undermine your accomplishments?\nDid they tell you things like\nyou're just wasting your time with that\nwhen you should be doing this instead.\nWhile it's normal for parents\nand their children to disagree,\na parent should never make their child\nfeel like they're not good enough\nto achieve their dreams,\nor that what they want doesn't matter.\nNumber two, they expect\nthe worst from you.\nAnother warning sign that\nyour parents are toxic for you\nis if they're constantly\nexpecting the worst from you.\nBreathing down your neck\nand jumping at the chance\nto see you mess up.\nThey don't afford you any\nfreedom to make mistakes\nand learn from them,\nbecause they immediately jump\nto the worst conclusions about you.\nThey can't forgive you\nfor your past mistakes\nand refuse to believe that you've changed,\nor at the very least,\nthat you're trying to.\nAnd their lack of support\nand low expectations\ndo nothing but hold you back even more.\nThree, they pressure and overburden you.\nThe pressure of living up\nto your parents' expectations\nweighs heavy on every child,\nespecially for those who excel at school\nor have a lot of talent.\nParents often push their children\nto work hard and do their best\nbecause they wanna see them realizing\ntheir fullest potential.\nBut there's a difference\nbetween encouraging\nyour child and overburdening them.\nSo if you feel a lot of\npressure from your parents\nto be the very best at everything you do,\nbecause anything short of perfect\nwould be a terrible\ndisappointment to them,\nthen they're doing more harm than good\nto your mental health.\nNumber four, they make you the parent.\nDo you often feel like\nthe roles have reversed\nbetween you and your parents,\nand more often than not,\nyou're the one who ends\nup taking care of them?\nParents who are neglectful,\ncareless, and irresponsible,\nleave their children\nto pick up their slack.\nAnd having to grow up before you're ready\nand be the parent at a young age\ncan have a lot of negative repercussions,\nsuch as elevated levels of anxiety,\ndepression, and neuroticism.\nMany parentified children\nalso tend to grow up\nto be people-pleasers\nwho gravitate towards\nemotionally dependent\nand exploitative partners and friends.\nNumber five, they're\nemotionally dependent on you.\nAnother subtle sign that\nyour parents are toxic\nis if they're emotionally\ndependent on you.\nNow, this can be hard to spot\nbecause oftentimes we simply excuse\nthese problematic behaviors as a sign\nthat our parents love us too much.\nBut when they start to become\ntoo clingy, needy, or possessive\nto the point where it\nseems like you're their\none and only source of\nhappiness and fulfillment,\nand should therefore be at\ntheir constant beck and call,\nit traps you in a vicious,\nunhealthy cycle of codependency\nthat sucks all your time,\nattention and energy.\nNumber six, they don't\ncommunicate with you.\nThe foundation of any strong,\npositive social\nrelationship, communication.\nCommunication is an integral life skill\nfor anyone to have.\nBut if you struggle to express yourself\nand speak openly about\nwhat you think and feel,\nit might be because you\ngrew up with parents\nwho struggled to communicate with you.\nMaybe it was because they felt awkward\nand didn't know how to talk\nto you about serious issues,\nor thought that simply\nnot speaking about it\nwould eventually make it go away.\nMaybe they'd give you the\ncold shoulder treatment\nto manipulate you into doing as they say,\nor express their disappointment in you.\nWhatever their reasons might be,\nthe bottom line is there's no excuse\nfor cutting off communication\nwith your child.\nAnd number seven, they use you\nas a pawn in their problems.\nIf your parents use you as a\npawn in their own problems,\nthen they are no doubt, toxic parents.\nThis is something that commonly happens\nin unhappy marriages or divorce families.\nOften parents will argue with one another\nabout who knows best for their child,\nwho their child likes more,\nwho's the better parent, and so on.\nAnd treat you more like a\nbargaining chip than a child.\nSo do you relate to any of these things\nwe've mentioned here?\nHas watching this video\nmade you understand\na little bit better about\nhow your struggles of growing up\nwith a toxic parent affected you?\nAs American author,\nSusan Forward once said,\n\"People can forgive toxic parents,\n\"but they should do it at the conclusion\n\"and not at the beginning\n\"of their emotional housecleaning.\n\"It's okay to get angry\nabout what happened to you,\n\"to grieve over the fact that you never\n\"had the parental love\nthat you yearned for.\"\nSo if you or anyone you know\nis seriously struggling because\nof a toxic relationship,\nbe it with your parents or otherwise,\nthen don't hesitate to reach out\nto a mental health care\nprofessional today and seek help.\nDid this
