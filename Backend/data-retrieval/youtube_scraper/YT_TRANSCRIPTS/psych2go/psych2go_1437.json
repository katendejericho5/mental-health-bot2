    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Five differences\nbetween crushing on\nand falling in love with someone.\nOne, a crush develops fast\nwhile love grows over time.\nIt's a lot quieter, subtle even\nand can sneak up on us\nwhen we least expect it.\nTwo, a crush forms from the basics\nwhile love thrives from deep connections.\nIt means confronting the\npast and mending together.\nThree, a crush might feel insecure\nwhile love stems from trust.\nLove teaches us to let go of our fears\nwhereas crushing on someone\nallows them to linger.\nFour, a crush feels new\nwhile love feels familiar.\nIt's like being with your best friend,\nsomeone who knows you inside and out\nperhaps better than you may know yourself.\nFive, a crush is reckless\nwhile love is mature.\nIt's more than just a feeling\nbut a life-changing experience.\nDo you think you're crushing\nor falling in love with someone?"
