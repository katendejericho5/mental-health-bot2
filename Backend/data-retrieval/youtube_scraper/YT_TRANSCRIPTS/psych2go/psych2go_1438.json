    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you struggle to build\ndeeper connections with others?\nAre you looking for ways\nto connect with people\nbeyond the surface level?\nToday's video is sponsored by So Syncd,\na place where we can match\npartners by personality types\nbased on the 16 personalities model.\nYou can access it by clicking the link\nin the description below.\nHey, Psych2Goers.\nSo you've been chatting\nwith someone online\nwhen you start to get a feeling\nin the pit of your stomach.\nNo, it's not last night's\nburritos kicking in.\nIt's butterflies, that\nexciting feeling you get\nwhen you've just realized\nyou like someone.\nSo the question is,\nhow do you know if they like you back?\nI mean, most of your\ncommunication has been online.\nIt's pretty difficult to know.\nWell, here are six signs\nsomeone online likes you.\nNumber one, they'll often\nuse the social media platform\nthat you prefer.\nSo you have your social\nmedia platform of choice.\nYou're comfortable\nsending the good old GIF,\nor is it JIF?\nAnd meme, from there.\nAnd you think there's no way\nyou'd turn to another social media site.\nThat is, until you get\na text from your crush\nsaying that they're more\noften on another one.\nTime to install!\nThe thing is, when people\noften have a crush,\nthey'll wanna please them\nby doing what's comfortable for them.\nIf that means simply downloading\nanother app to text on,\neasy peasy lemon squeezy.\nSo pay attention to if that person\nyou've been chatting with online\nhas a newly activated\naccount on social media.\nDid you mention it was your app of choice?\nNumber two, they crack a few jokes\nand attempt to make you smile or laugh.\nSo you're texting this person,\nand they suddenly send you a giraffe meme.\nYou don't know where they got this idea\nthat you love giraffes, or\nthat you're a meme fanatic,\nbut you love it.\nYou'll write a draft to your honeymoon.\nOh, okay. Let's take it easy.\nBut it's nice to know that\nthey're trying to make you smile.\nIf you find they're cracking a few jokes,\nsharing silly photos of themselves\nor sending a few funny\ngifs, or jifs, or memes,\nthey're likely putting\nin that extra effort\nof finding the most hilarious thing,\nbecause they're trying to\nget you to laugh or smile,\nbecause why wouldn't you want\nthe person you like to smile?\nWe talked about the importance\nof your potential partner\nbeing attentive and\nremembering the little things,\nwhich is why So Syncd could\nbe the right app for you.\nThey pair couples who have the\nright amount of similarities\nto get each other and just the\nright amount of differences\nto create that spark for\ndeeper, meaningful dating.\nUpon taking the personality test,\nyou discover your personality\nsuch as INFJ, so thoughtful,\nor ENFP, so curious.\nOnce you have mutually liked each other,\nyou can start messaging.\nWe want to send a massive congratulations\nto Hannah and Brendan who are\ngetting married in December\nafter meeting on So Syncd,\nthe dating app that matches\ncompatible personality types.\nHannah is a Phych2Goer\nwho discovered So Syncd\nthrough one of our videos.\nShe downloaded the app and found Brendan\nall within a matter of hours.\nHannah is an ENFP and Brendan is an INTJ,\na perfect personality match.\nDownload the app for free today\nin the description box below\nto meet that special\nsomeone on your wavelength\nand give yourself a chance\nto find deeper love.\nNumber three, they respond fast.\nHow fast does your crush\nrespond to your texts?\nDo they leave you unread for hours?\nIf someone genuinely likes you,\nthey won't want to leave you\nwaiting if they're not busy.\nIf they have time to talk to\nyou and want to talk to you,\nthey will respond\nquickly to your messages.\nMany people have busy\nlives or hectic schedules,\nso don't take offense\nif they don't always respond right away.\nYour schedules may simply not match,\nbut a good friend will\ngenerally let you know\nwhen they suddenly disappear\nfrom the online conversation,\nor if they've been busy in a short\nor lengthy response later.\nAnd if they really like you,\nthey'll make sure to keep\nthe conversation going\nwhen they're not busy,\nwhich brings me to my next point.\nNumber four, they continue\nwith the conversation\nand add to it.\nDoes your online crush add their thoughts\nto your conversations\nor do they only provide minimal responses?\nSometimes there's simply\nnot a lot to talk about,\nand it can be a bit nerveracking\nthinking of what topic to bring up next,\nwhen you're anxious about liking someone.\nBut a good friend will generally try\nto keep the conversation\ngoing if they're not too busy.\nThis could mean bringing\nup things about their day,\ninteresting comments on\na show they're watching,\nor even sending those funny\ngiraffe memes we talked about.\nThey'll simply make an\nexcuse to talk to you.\nAnd once you start talking,\nthey'll generally put in a bit of effort\ninto keeping the conversation going.\nThat is if you put some effort in too.\nIf you don't, they may be\nwondering if you like them\nas much as they like you.\nSimply put, if you're having\na fun time talking to them,\ncasually let them know.\nRomance is soon to follow\nif you both like each\nother and express it.\nNumber five, they show\ninterest in what you text.\nSo you just sent a long\nthree paragraph explanation\non the meaning of life.\nIgnore what context.\nAnd you eagerly wait for their reply.\nTyping, typing, typing...\n\"K,\" they respond.\nWith K.\nBro!\nIf who you're texting shows\nminimal responsiveness\nand generally no interest in\nyour opinions or thoughts,\nthey probably aren't feeling it.\nIf someone likes you, they'll\ngenerally want to know\nhow you're doing.\nA quick, how are you today?\nor a follow-up question to\nwhat you discussed yesterday\nare all good signs.\nAnd if you express your\nopinion on a personal topic\nor even a random one,\nthey generally give you\nsome sort of excitement\nor a thoughtful response if they like you.\nif they show interest\nin what you have to say,\nand you display interest in\nwhat they're sharing with you,\nit sounds like it's time to let them know\nyou'd like to explore\na more romantic relationship with them.\nAnd number six, they often\ninitiate the conversation.\nDoes your crush text you often?\nDo you both check in\non each other each week\nor even day to day?\nSomeone who's interested\nin you actually texts back.\nAnd they'll often\ninitiate the conversation\njust as much as you do, if not more.\nRemember the whole, how are\nyou? checkup text we mentioned?\nPeople often text that\nor something similar\nwhen they like someone.\nYou should too!\nBut if they also strike up a conversation\non an interesting topic frequently,\nthey're likely into either being friends\nor romantic partners.\nI think we're hoping for\nthe latter in this case.\nMaybe you both have similar\ninterests or hobbies.\nIf so, they will likely\nwant to text you about them\nand start up a conversation\nabout these topics.\nMore importantly, if you\ntext them often as well,\nthey make sure you\ndon't fall out of touch.\nEvery healthy relationship\nrequires good communication.\nSo pay attention to if they\nactually communicate with you.\nAnd when in doubt, try simply asking them,\nso you're both on the same page.\nOr send a giraffe meme.\nHm. You know what?\nThe asking is probably\nbetter for the context."
