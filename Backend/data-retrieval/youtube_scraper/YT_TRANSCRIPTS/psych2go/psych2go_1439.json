feeling as cheery or\nmotivated as you once were\nwell guess what you've come to the right\nplace\nwe at site2go are about to give you four\nvaluable tips to help you improve your\nmental health to be the best it can be\nwe're in this together number one\nmake yourself a priority are you often\ntoo busy or too tired to relax and do\nsomething you actually enjoy\nyou may be studying or working too hard\nor perhaps you don't stop and take\nnotice of what your body needs\nhave you had a calm moment to simply\nbreathe and wind down\ndid you eat too little today did you get\nenough water\nyou didn't did you you sneaky little\npsych2goer\nyou may not care about yourself enough\nto get a good eight glasses a day\nbut we hear it's like to go we care\nabout you\nneglecting self-care is detrimental to\nour mental health\nresearch has shown that what we eat\naffects not only our mood\nbut how we think as well and if you\ndon't eat enough\nodds are you aren't going to feel great\nexercise and enough sleep are also vital\nto our health\nso if you're watching this late at night\non your phone\nhear these tips and then call it a night\nyour mental health will thank you\ntomorrow i promise\nnumber two create positive thoughts\nare you aware of your thoughts you may\nsay of course\ni know what i'm thinking but less often\ndo we actually stop to consider what it\nis we're thinking\nwhat we're saying to ourselves and if\nit's something we'd say to others\nthink about it are your thoughts more\noften positive or negative\naccording to a new 2020 study from\npsychologists\nat queen's university published in the\njournal nature communications\nthe average human has around 6 200\nthoughts per day\nin another study published in the\nnational science foundation\nit was found that of the thousands of\nthoughts each individual has per day\neighty percent were negative and\nninety-five percent\nwere the exact same repetitive thoughts\nas the previous day\nso we repeat a lot of negative thoughts\nbut this next study will really put\nthings into perspective for you\nin another study from cornell university\nscientists found that 85\nof what we worry about never happens\nnot only that 79 of the subjects found\nthat either they could handle the\ndifficulty better than they thought\nor that the difficulty taught them a\nlesson they felt was worth it\nso this is my advice to you stop\nbreathe and think about what you're\nthinking about\nis it positive is it healthy more\nimportantly\nis it something you would say to a\nfriend who was worried too\nand looking for comfort it's always best\nto treat ourselves like our best friend\nbe there to comfort yourself with\npositive thoughts and when in doubt with\na worry\ntry to ask yourself is this very\nproductive\nam i making this more difficult than it\nhas to be\nnumber three say what you feel\nguess what there's a writer here inside\nyour screen\nand she's writing to tell you it's late\nand she's tired\nbut she's feeling better now and she\nwanted me to let you know\nshe's keying you into a little\npsychology secret\nexpressing how you feel makes you feel\nbetter a brain imaging study by\npsychologists at ucla\nrevealed that verbalizing our feelings\nmakes our sadness\nanger and pain less intense when we see\na photograph\nof a fearful or angry face we have\nincreased activity in a region of our\nbrain called the amygdala\nthis serves as a warning of danger in\nour brain\nin the study researchers used functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging\nto study subjects brain activity\nresearchers had\n30 subjects view photos of individuals\nmaking different emotional expressions\nbelow each photo were the words angry or\nfearful\nsubjects then had to choose which word\nto assign to each face\nsome subjects were instead given two\nnames below the photo\nharry and sally and had to assign gender\nappropriate names to the photos\nresearchers found a decreased response\nin the amygdala\nwhen the words angry and fearful were\nexpressed by assigning them\nthey did not see the reduction in the\namygdala response when using the words\nharry and sally\nmeaning if you put your feelings into\nwords you feel better\nwhile the amygdala was less active when\nsubjects labeled a feeling\nthe right ventrolateral prefrontal\ncortex\nwas more active and it makes sense why\nthis region of the brain has been\nassociated with\nthinking in words about emotional\nexperiences so\nif you want to better your mental health\ntry talking to a friend or psychologist\nabout your feelings\nor write them in a journal just the act\nof writing in words about how you feel\ncan have positive and powerful effects\nnumber four\nbe compassionate to others a little\ncompassion can go\na long way wouldn't you want someone to\nshow you a little love and kindness\nand i bet when you treat someone with\nkindness or do someone a favor\nyou often feel a little bit better too\ndon't you\nwell there's research to support this\naccording to research from psychologists\ned diener and martin seligman altruism\ncan lead to improved mental and physical\nhealth\nas well as speed up recovery from\ndisease and brain imaging research from\nnaomi eisenberger at ucla has found that\nproviding support for others\nmay have unique positive effects on key\nbrain areas involved in stress and\nreward responses\nso if research shows that a little\ncompassion and support can predict\ndecreased stress response in the brain\nand improve mental health what are you\nwaiting for odds are
