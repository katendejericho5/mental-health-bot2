and what that\ncould really look like and we have a\nvery very courageous beautiful\nconversation\num ready for you today so thank you so\nmuch for joining in and i'm gonna just\nbring on our special guest\nand her name is sabrina we\nhi sabrina how are you\nhi i'm great\nit's uh you know really well it's not\nvery early in the morning but i'm not a\nmorning person and it's a monday where i\nam so\nyes i am good for a monday yeah you're\njoining oh i know you it's monday\nmorning it is more oh my gosh thank you\nso much for joining us i know i was\nreally psyched to to join the show so\nand and it's really great i'm excited to\nconnect with the community that you have\nand i've been following psyc2go as well\nso it's it was really cool for me to\nhave this opportunity\nyeah you know what's really amazing is\num\nit's so beautiful to have this mission\nthat's so like driven from our heart and\nthen we get to come together with that\none mission we're having these\nconversations from all over the world\nwhich is incredible so it's such an\nhonor to have you here today and sabrina\num so from what i understand um\nno first of all you are here today\nreally i'm wanting to share openly about\nyour beautiful journey um around your\nmental health challenges that you've had\nand it also sounds like you have created\nthis beautiful organization com\ncollective asia which really has a\nmission to normalize mental health\nspecifically more in asia and of course\neverywhere but um you know specifically\nin asia and oh my gosh what a cool\nmission because i just was just in korea\nso i i get it i really do so yeah\nwe've asked you\nshare with us a little bit about who you\nare how you got started on this journey\nand that's what we'd like to share\naround your own journey around mental\nhealth\nokay so where do i even begin um so\num\nyeah my journey and then like all the\nway through to to yeah collective right\ntime collective asia get birthday like\nwhat was your journey\nto that\nyeah for sure so maybe i can share more\nabout how calm collective asia happened\nright and then we'll take a step back\nand i can share more about\nall of the stuff that i've experienced\nbefore that to you know to kind of give\nbirth to this thing so um for calm\ncollective asia i actually started this\nduring the 2020 lockdown last year\nduring um yeah in the midst of the\npandemic one week into the singapore\nlockdown um\nyeah mental health was actually\nconsidered a non-essential\nuh non-essential service so that\nactually meant that with my bipolar\ndisorder i wasn't able to see my\ntherapist i couldn't see my psychiatrist\nand therefore something had to be done\nso um i called to uh two other friends\nand\nthey um and basically you know from home\nwe figured out okay the best thing that\nwe can do right now is to figure out how\nwe can help our community\num find ways to cope mentally with the\nwhole pandemic right so then um yeah we\njust called our like people that we knew\nin the middle half space to come\ntogether\num\nand teach other people how to\nuh yeah how to meditate how to journal\nwe're also talking about like mentally\nhow we're feeling um and that kind of\ngave rise to to come collective asia so\nit was meant as a\nside project during the pandemic and we\nwere like yeah we just got to do this\nfor the community and then um fast\nforward to today that's become my\nfull-time job and i am working on\nnormalizing mental health conversations\nevery day so yeah it's been great yeah\num but yeah\nyeah um\na little bit about\nyour story her story around you know\nhow you know being diagnosed and then\nworking through the recovery of um you\nknow having a bipolar and\ni personally can only imagine that was\nprobably a very courageous conversation\nthat you got to have especially being in\nasia so if you don't mind please share\nwith us a little bit about that yes sure\nuh wow okay so my journey with mental\nhealth has it's been a while so right\nnow i'm how old am i i'm 31 this year\nand um my first so-called brush with uh\nwith anything to do with my mental\nhealth was really when i was 11 that was\nthe first time i had\nsomewhat a dis depressive episode you\nknow i was i i was thinking of like\nsuicide and things like that um but fast\nforward to around the time i was in my\nearly 20s so about 23 to 25 i was\nkind of going through phases of um yeah\ndepression and then i'd be like okay\ni'll get on antidepressants and go for\ntherapy and then go back up again but\nthen we then realized that i was\nshooting way back up like really high up\nand i was you know experiencing all the\num\nthe\nsymptoms of bipolar which meant um i\nwasn't sleeping i was super social\nmaking lots of friends that's how i have\nlike so many connections on my social\nmedia and i'm like who are these people\num i also uh you know i wasn't eating\nvery much i was um starting like 10 new\nprojects at a time so that was like okay\nreally strange and i actually had a\ncouple of friends who said sabrina\nthere's something up here this is not\nnormal you um but i was like nah you\nknow this is me and you don't appreciate\nwho i am you know this is part of my\npersonal and professional growth\num but hey um every time i hit a new\nhigh i kept going down\nlower right\nand\nwhile i was initially diagnosed with\nmajor depressive disorder\ni took i looked back at my history of\nyou know ups and downs and then did a\nlot of googling and i realized that it\nwas not um it was probably not\ndepression alone right\nso i think it was around five years ago\nwhere i got properly diagnosed with\nbipolar disorder and this i also learned\nthat there's lots of different types so\nwe can also go into that if you want\nyeah\nyeah um\nand so um you know for you what did that\nfeel like and\nwhat was did you personally face any\nstigma around this initially oh\nyeah and i mean come on even like with\nlike stigma is a huge one right this\nstigma on so many different levels but i\nthink um the main one that people face\nis really on the societal level which\nthen translates into\nhow the people around you um respond to\nyou or react to you when you you show\nsigns of mental illness or any like\nmental health difficulties\nso\num\ni guess\nearlier when i was still going through\nlike my depressive episodes um and those\nwere the\nreally really tough times because i\nwould refuse to get out of bed i found\nit so difficult to\nto find the motivation to work and even\nto like write to a an email was like\nsuper difficult right like four\nsentences i'd be like what will people\nthink of me you know do i sound smart i\nsound really dumb right now\num and i would share all of this with\nlike my friends and family and uh\nyou know my mom and dad were like hey\nyou know just sleep it off tomorrow be\nuh we'll be fine you can keep it off\num\ni knew that\ni could get help through therapy or\nthrough medication um and in singapore\nit's really difficult if you do it the\nprivate way right that's uh\nlike i didn't have insurance i covered\nit so um so that was like mom can you\nhelp me you know cover my my fees and\nall that and she's like you don't need\nit it's okay you just gotta work harder\nor just be patient you know\num\nor like oh and the other thing was uh\nhey uh you're not crazy you don't have\nto go for these uh you don't have to\nseek help for your mental health right\num it's not a real thing so yes i mean\nstigma is very real um and even through\nmy\nyeah it's just i have so much to say\nabout it i don't even\nand i yeah like trying to get help from\nfriends as well yeah\nyeah that i mean it's not a real thing i\nthink that's the thing that affects a\nlot of people\num you know people you know you have\nwhen your back hurts you can be like oh\nmy back hurts or if you have a cold you\ncan be like i have a cold but like when\nyou have mental health concerns\nsometimes people especially if they're\nnot\ntoo aware of that realm they might brush\nit off like oh but that's not a real\nthing right and i know that yeah yeah\nand a lot of people on psych2go have\nexpressed their concerns about opening\nup to their own parents or\nyou know feeling invalidated around with\nit\nand\nwhat message do you have for them you\nknow what would you share with them\nif moving through something like that\nyeah yeah i mean it's incredibly\nisolating right when you are going\nthrough something that people around you\ndo either do not understand or do not\ntry to understand right\num\nso\nit's really hard i think it depends on\nthe individual's circumstances but\nwhat helped me a lot and what i've\nrealized over time is that you know\nyou're really not alone\num and even if like you can't find\npeople in your own social circle that\nwill understand there will be someone\nout there somewhere online that we will\nbe able to understand you and will be\nable to resonate with you right and\num honestly in my own journey um\ni found it really hard to get full i\nguess empathy from my friends and family\ni do have like one or two friends who\nwho understood it and like has had their\nown personal experiences\nbut\nin my journey i found that my best\nfriend's or best support was really my\ntherapist and psychiatrist\nso\nif possible\num and if you're able to do it yourself\num go for go seek professional help or\nfind a support group online or something\nyeah yeah yeah\nso um as you started calm collective\nasia like what was your vision like what\nwould be an ideal world for you around\nthis topic like what would that look\nlike\noh wow okay um\nso it's evolved initially we were like\nyeah we want to normalize mental health\nconditions so that you know we can\nprevent like the worst case scenario\nbut now it's evolved into\ninto something a bit more positive right\na bit more optimistic and\nthe dream that we're working towards is\nreally to\nto get everyone to be proactive with\ntheir mental health so that they can all\nstrive for good mental health whether or\nnot they have a mental illness\nyeah\nyeah\nyou know in in the work i do as a coach\num one of the things that i am\npassionate about is like\nthey people get to be vulnerable people\nget to be like open and authentic\nbecause i think that itself can be\nreally healing and it sounds like you\nguys have a similar message around\nmental disorders\num\nwhat message do you have for people who\nwant to be more open\nwho want to be more vulnerable\nbut they are scared of that stigma or\nthe backlash or feeling invalidated like\nbecause\nyou know brene brown talks about this\nright like how\nthe initial thing that shows up right\nafter we do become vulnerable is\nactually shame\nso like a lot of people don't even allow\nthemselves to get there because they're\nscared of shame scared of what people\nwould think like\nwhat what is your\nyou know advice for those kind of people\nor\nanyone who wants to be more open and\nit's a and the cool thing is i don't\nthink this is even about just mental\nhealth it could be about your sexual\norientation it could be about something\nthat's like real to you but you're\nscared to talk about whatever that might\nbe like what message do you have for\npeople who might be in that place\nand basically how to be more vulnerable\nright\nit's really hard right because um i\nthink\nit takes a lot of courage to be\nvulnerable because you're putting\nyourself out there um you know and\nyou're showing all your weaknesses all\nyour flaws right\nand that's what you're very familiar\nwith\num\nyou know i\nso my way of dealing with it because\nbecause it took me a long time before i\ngot comfortable enough to talk about my\nthis like the secret i had right i had\nmy i have my mental health condition i\ndon't want to tell anybody about it but\nfinally one day i just said hey you know\nwhat this i'm sick of hiding it i'm sick\nof\npretending that\nyou know i'm all okay i don't i don't\nneed to go for my therapy um i was like\nyou know going behind my boss's back um\nsneaking in my therapy sessions on\nweekdays and um seeing my psychiatrist\ni'm like yeah i'm\nyeah anyway so i i was just really tired\nof pretending right and finally\num\ni just did it i wrote my own blog post\nand i just talked about all this\ncrap i went through\nand um yeah and and after that what\nhappened was that i had so many so many\nmany many many people just come forward\nto me and just\nshare their personal stories right so i\nthink it's really about us finding the\ncourage to do it to just be open about\nit\nand finding the right\nmeans or platform for us to to share\nright so some of us may not be\nready to\nshare openly in public so i did it\nthrough a blog post right how i can't\nlike take it back you know it's still up\nthere somewhere\num but\nwhat we can do is\nyou know maybe just find in our own\nlittle ways yeah ways to open up to\npeople who we feel safe with whom we can\ntrust and if it's not someone that's a\npersonal friend or family member then\nthat could be a therapist\nyeah yeah yeah\nthere's lots of safe ways yeah yeah so\nit sounds like what you're let me know\nif i'm hearing you right it sounds like\nyou're you feel like you know seeing a\ntherapist or getting professional help\nof some sort around this is almost\ncreating that safe place for them to you\nknow practice being vulnerable until\nthey can go out there and be\nthat on their own is that right yeah\nexactly i think that's exactly it and i\nthink that's the point of um\nof therapy right that's\nif you can't break down there then we're\ngonna break down\nyeah ideally not on your own on your bed\nbut like\nyeah so\nlet me ask you one of the obviously cool\nthings that's come out of you being\nvulnerable\nis like this birth of this you know\namazing organization\nwhat other personal benefits have you\nhad even though it was scary even though\nyou might have felt like you know a\ntinge of faith uh shame right after\nbecause that's what happened that right\nof course yes but\nyou genuinely look pretty good like you\nlook like you know you're on a really\npurposeful path and it sounds like\nthere's been a lot of benefits of you of\ncoming out um or really sharing your\njourney and really um talking about your\nauthentic experience so what's been the\nvenue in that\ni think the biggest benefit has really\nbeen able to like it's in me being able\nto live truly to myself like living\nauthentically not having to you know\nkind of pretend that\ni'm you know feeling crappy on this day\nand just being able to to live my real\nself that's really been the best\ntakeaway and i am able to do this both\non a personal level because i don't have\nto like tiptoe around this mental\nillness anymore\nand i can also do this professionally\nbecause you know with working\nand working with mental health um\ni have to walk the talk so i have to be\naccountable to myself\nright so\nso that's been great because um hey i i\ncan now go for therapy and just say guys\ni am out for therapy right now be right\nback right\nso that's been great i love it yeah\nthat's beautiful that's beautiful and\nand you guys if you guys are watching\nthis and you i would imagine that\nthere's someone out there watching this\nand like crying because like for the\nfirst time someone is saying what you've\nbeen thinking about or what you've been\nwanting to do or say\nso if there's any questions or anything\nthat you guys would like to share about\nwhat's coming up for you please please\nyou know let us know please share with\nus\num\nyeah um\nah thank you guys you made me feel\nbetter you're the best thank you you're\nthe best and my good friend\nyeah and um\nyou know\ni think\nit's interesting because it's one of\nthose things that more people talk about\nit i don't know if you had a similar\nexperience but um i remember when my\nyou know my family was going through a\nreally hard time because my dad um was\ndiagnosed with cancer\ni thought i was so alone on that journey\nit was heartbroken and da da da da and i\nwas going through my own like you know\njourney of mental health challenges but\ni remember like once i started to share\nwith all these people out of nowhere\nlike my son\nor people i haven't talked to they start\nsharing their stories and then you\nrealize\nno one's actually alone in anything it's\njust like no one's talking about the\nreal things right\nyeah i'm kind of curious like what's\nbeen your experience in that when you\nstart to share like did you have story\nstories like that when people start to\nshare like oh my gosh i never told\nanyone this but\nyeah yeah i did so many um\nso i've now openly been sharing about my\nstory right and\ni feel yeah i think the other benefit\nbecause like just going back to your\nprevious question right was just\nrealizing how\nhow supported i am and how much how big\na community this is right\num i used to feel so alone and no one\nunderstood but then since i shared about\nit people have just been coming forward\nall the time and saying that hey i felt\nthis way and they're also coming forward\nand saying like i want to contribute to\nyour cause i want to you know find a way\nto volunteer and like even within the\nteam that we've built it's we've got so\nmany people who've gone through their\nown personal lived experiences right and\ni think it's just become such a kind of\nsafe haven for people to um\nto come together and work on this\nmission together yeah so\nlots of people there's so many more than\nwe know right yeah and uh you're so\nright in saying that we always see like\nthe best versions of\nof other people but we see the worst\nversions of of ourselves right yep yes\nthere's a horrible comparison\nyeah because you're the only one who\nknows like what's really going on in\nyour life but then everyone else is\nputting on their highlight reel so it's\nlike wow everyone's having the best time\nof their life all the time and then\nwhat's wrong with me and then you get\ninto exactly why do i feel so terrible\nwhy am i so alone i have no friends i'm\nnot going on any holiday so i'm sorry\nyeah exactly\nyeah it's um it's interesting and um you\nstart to talk about a little bit about\num and this can be kind of more of like\nan educational portion of this if you'd\nlike it sounds like there's different\nkinds of um bipolar um\ncategories yeah a little bit about that\ni think it might be kind of\nyou know occupational for some of our\nviewers here yeah it's yeah it's really\ninteresting because i had to also try to\nfigure out what what this is that i had\nright\nso um\nbipolar disorder it's very it's not\nstraightforward because you know it's\nnot like it's depression where it's like\nunipolar like one pole\nbipolar it's um you know there's ups and\ndowns and then the the degrees of ups\nand downs can vary in the individual and\nit looks different\nfor every single person who has bipolar\ndisorder so obviously i've talked about\nit and now i have friends who also have\nit so i learned about it from through\nthem as well and and i also got i did a\nlot of googling and i asked my\npsychiatrist a lot of questions\nso\nbipolar disorder ups and downs and um\nbasically there's um there's different\ntypes right so we can start with\nthe mildest form which is cyclothemia\nand that is\nyou have like milder ups and downs right\nso it's like if this is like your\nbaseline\nyou're like like that up and down up and\ndown um it's usually not um\nvery detrimental to your like day-to-day\num but there's like no noticeable\nchanges in your mood as well as your\nbehavior right\nthen the other thing would be the next\none which is\nbipolar type\n2 which is what i have\nit's um it's characterized by more lows\nand longer lows right\nso so it's more like okay you've got a\nhigh that's not so bad but still it's\nit's noticeable but not like\nthreatening right it doesn't it's not\nlife-threatening you may be spending a\nlot of money you may be more like\nrisk-taking it's noticeable but not to\nthe extent that it's gonna endanger\nanybody right right so ups and then\ndowns\nand it repeats it goes again and again\nso that's what i have\num and that's um\ni now manage that through my mood\nstabilizers and if i have\nlow lows i would go go get on\nantidepressants temporarily until i get\nback to a like normal-ish\nstable\nstate\nyeah\nokay so that's type two and then there's\nbipolar type one\nwhich um\nso it's that one is characterized by\nhigher highs which are like\napparently because i i can't speak from\npersonal experience\nso apparently those are\nuh\nway more extreme in the sense that yeah\nmaybe you\nyou may be affecting other people that\nway so yeah\nso higher highs and the lows apparently\nare\nfor shorter periods or it's not really\ncharacterized by the lows it's more\nabout the highs\nso uh yeah that's what i know of bipolar\ndisorder but i'm not a mental health\nexpert um i'm not a psychiatrist so so\ngo check that check you know yeah and uh\nyeah i mean like maybe one more thing to\nshare is that sometimes um bipolar\ndisorder also happens with other\ncomorbidities so you may have like other\nlike\nconditions as well together too to\nmanage yeah\nyeah and if i don't if you don't mind\nasking and do you\nhave you found any comorbidities or any\nother things that you were over\nthankfully no\nthankfully not um\nso i mean i think something that's\npretty common uh amongst people who\nexperience bipolar disorder is um\npsychosis so they may lose you know they\nmay be out of touch with reality for\njust a bit\nright um and so they would have to take\na specific medication for that\nyeah\nyou know i'm actually having a\nconversation with one of my friends on a\nhike today about\nhow um\nhealing and important that like\nmindfulness portion is right like i'm\nbeing self-aware i would imagine\nspecifically in\num experiencing bipolar because\nit's almost like it sounds like you have\nto be really\nlistening to your body and being like\nokay where am i today like do i need\nlike\ndepressants or do i need something else\nor do you want am i good like it sounds\nlike you're doing kind of like this\ncheck in with yourself all the time so\nit seems like being mindful is a big\npart of your journey\nyes\nyou're so right um and i think\nmindfulness is like it's it's helpful\nfor everyone right but um\ni i think for me\nbecause um yeah you know i have to be\ncognizant of my moods um ups and downs\nand all that all of that um i do check\nin with myself very regularly um and\nwhat i take note off is plus of all my\nsleep\nso um sleep is like a huge indicator of\nhow i'm feeling right um\nif i get my usual eight hours of sleep\nthen uh\nokay like things are fine if it drops to\nlike five hours four hours then\ni'm usually in a hypo hypomanic state\nand if it's like i just want to stay in\nbed forever then i'm probably depressed\nso\num\nso sleep is one i also check in a lot on\nmy like how i'm feeling for the day\nright my mood um\nand and also my like my energy level so\ni i kind of do um i'm\ndaily check-in with myself to see how\ni'm feeling and\nand how i do that is uh yeah i try to\nground myself in meditation but i also\njournal and just uh i actually use an\napp to like track um how i'm feeling and\nlike my moves and everything\num\nyeah and uh what else lots of things i\nmean like\nhonestly my period also affects my mood\na lot so i i keep track of that um\nthat's a huge part\nyeah it's huge i'm like why am i so\ndepressed oh\nokay so um yeah so yeah i kind of have\nto be aware day-to-day um how i'm\nfeeling and then adjust my\nmy schedule or adjust my activities\naccordingly yeah yeah and that's that's\namazing because it sounds like the gift\nout of all this journey\nis that you found this\nreason to be really super mindful of\nyourself\nand it sounds like that's been a gift\nfor\nyou um lots of gifts i i can't even yeah\nthere's so many things\nyou know okay so i'm gonna bring up\nsomething here right now and it might be\ntriggering for some people\num and i actually want to address this\nbecause this is exactly why we're having\nthis conversation i invite you to look\nat this comment\nonly jesus can set you free from all\nmental and psychic illnesses meditation\nis demonic so we're having a\nconversation today about normalizing\nmental health disorders\nright and\ncomments like this i want to really move\nthis forth and how\nhow um create some discernment around\nthis specifically on this channel\nbecause we are here to support\nand make it very clear that\nit's not a demonic thing first of all to\nmeditate\nand you know only jesus can set you free\nthis feels like someone's saying that\nit's a sin to have mental or psycho\npsychic or whatever you know this isn't\neven a word but illness\nso this is why we're here right so i\nwant to just have a raw conversation\nhere\nlike what are your thoughts on this and\nhow can you know imagine if this was\nlike day one of you being diagnosed and\nsomeone's saying this to your face\nor someone else is reading this and\nthey're on the verge of trying to go to\na therapist like these components are\njust not okay so sharing with us a\nlittle bit like what are your\nso i i have um been on the receiving end\nof these comments right and uh and hey i\nactually gave it a shot i went to church\ntwice with two different people who were\nlike come with me i really want to help\nyou\nand um\nyou know i\nhave to believe that anyone who says\nthis\nthey\nthey probably come from you know\nprobably good intentions right they're\nprobably well intentioned and i think\nwhat we're facing with mental illness or\nmental health conditions as a whole is\nthat\nwe generally don't have the i mean i\nthink we generally like the\nunderstanding of what it really is right\nbecause what i\nhave you know come to realize and\num i found that this has really been\nhelpful in explaining mental illness is\nthat your brain is an organ too and it\ncan fall sick just like any other organ\nright so i think when you understand the\nwhen you understand mental illness from\nlike the biological perspective then\nit's a lot more easy it's a lot easier\nto accept that\nit can happen and there can be things\nthat happen in your brain that\nthat affect\nyour mood affect how you are right\num\nand\nyeah so that's that's one point um\nbut with regards to the whole um i guess\nreligion and how that\ncan help\nmental illness is that i mean i think\nthere is a role in\nthat spirituality and religion can play\nin uh in helping\nmental health right um in the sense that\nlike yeah like if you\nhave\nif you're religious uh or spiritual then\nyou may have that faith that can help\nyou um\nwhere you can like kind of seek solace\nand comfort to\nget you through the problems that you're\nfacing but i would say that probably\nextends only to things only to\nmental\nhealth conditions that are triggered by\nstressful life events and not you know\nit doesn't change your physiology\nphysiology or\num it may not be something that's like\nyeah\nthank you for sharing i mean i can just\nsense your compassion around\nright like you're not even giving it a\nsecond to be triggered you're saying\nlisten it sounds like there's a gap\nbetween like the you know\nthe education\nthat people get to have around mental\nhealth and this person\nintends well there's nothing right or\nwrong it's just this person has his own\nperspective\nand it sounds like you're you get to say\nokay like this person just doesn't know\num what mental health really is maybe\nbecause they've never been exposed to it\ni love that so much because i have this\nsaying like you know that i love which\nis i didn't create this but hurt people\nhurt people right um if someone is being\nblatantly rude or\num whether it's out of ignorance or out\nof re truly malicious intent it's just\nbecause that person also needs healing\nand in that we can find compassion for\nall people\nfor sure\ni say that a lot as well so\nit's helped me a lot too it's a lot yeah\nit's helped a lot in in finding\ncompassion for people who are are just\nplain mean\nit's okay yeah\nyeah\nand um\nand you know i want to talk a little bit\nabout this because there's like these um\nother extreme end of stigma i've found\nis that\nthere's people who\nyou know do not\nthink mental health conditions are real\nand then there's people who are like\nit's real\nbut medication is bad you know you\nshould be able to find a cure or you\nknow\nbased on\njust like meditating or you know finding\nholistic you know ways yeah\nitself\num\nwhat are your thoughts on that\num\n[Music]\ni would say that\nokay so\nso this is difficult for me to comment\non because um\nbut i have thoughts around it so\ni'm just gathering myself okay gathering\nthoughts but um okay so so my belief is\nthat it really depends on the\nthe mental health condition or illness\nthat you're facing um i think in\nconditions that are more severe that's\nreally impacting your day-to-day um\nlike if you can't even get out of bed\nyou can't even like\nshower or like do things if you have\nzero motivation to do anything\num i think\ni i really do believe that medication\nhelps people a lot in um\nin kind of just\ngetting to the point where they can\nfunction\nin their daily life right\num\nand obviously for maybe like more severe\num\nor acute illnesses like uh i don't know\nschizophrenia then\nmedication really does play a role in it\num\nhowever i also\nyeah i i don't think every mental health\ncondition\nnecessarily requires\num\nintervention via like medication it\nreally depends on\nyeah to what severity you're\nexperiencing the same right but yeah so\nbut so what i like to say a lot um to my\nfriends is that\num\nmedication can provide a really good\ncrutch as you find your way to stability\num and\nyeah and and like so for example like\nmaybe i can share my own\nmy own story is that\num antidepressants for me used to be\nreally really helpful to get myself out\nof that depressive state but in the past\nover i think in the past two years i\nhaven't been on any antidepressants\nbecause i've been able to\nintroduce my own like really positive\nhabits and lifestyle changes that\nare really conducive for my well-being\nright so for example for for instance\ni've stopped\ndrinking alcohol because it's an it's a\ndepressant\nand it can trigger like really bad\nepisodes um i've cut down on caffeine no\ncoffee want tea once a day\num what else uh meditation also has\nhelped so much\nit's really helped me uh\nlike let go of\na lot of stress and\nand all that but\nbut it takes so much effort to actually\nyou know\nhave all this discipline to to practice\ngood habits for yourself because\nyeah so so i would say that yeah\nmedication is probably a crutch to get\nyou through to that point where you're\nable to do it for yourself\num\nbut then uh but then you've got to put\nin the work as well for sure yes i love\nthat answer a lot thank you so much for\nyou know\nanswering that because i think i agree\nwith you again you know not neither of\nus are\nyou know um psychologists or anything\nbut\nfrom our own experience and what i've\nobserved and in myself and whatnot like\nsometimes these medications\num can be like a really good short-term\nlike accelerator so that you can\nactually function and get to a point of\nstarting a new like discipline\nhabit or rituals or whatever but\nit sounds like you know you're finding\nthat it's not a good long-term cure like\nthere gets to be other ways to like\nmanage whatever it is you're moving\nthrough and um healing process isn't\ngoing to be just fixed by the it's not\njust about medication yeah however\nwe we get to\num not stigmatize that either right if\npeople like need that they get to do\nthat right like\nsounds like it's like you feel that it's\na case by case as well as\nnot stigmatizing but also realizing that\nit's not the long-term cure\nright\nyeah i mean obviously it depends on like\nwhere your starting point is and what\nyour possibly that diagnosis is right so\nif it's um\nlike i think in certain cases you may\nneed to be on medication for life and\nthat's okay right that's okay too and\nthat's okay but at the same time\nfor i think for majority of cases we\nyou probably don't need to have the\nmedication for life you really have the\nmedication only as a crutch\num during times where you can't function\nlike day to day yeah and you're so right\nin saying that um you know it's it's\nabout us building our own habits as well\nyeah yeah absolutely and um\nyou know\nin in any way have you found that your\ndepression or um your depression\ndepressive um you know um episodes um\nand or just like by you know bipolar in\ngeneral has been a gift for you so for\nme for example i'm trying to\nshare this part um let me preface it\nwith my story real quick which is that i\nyou know i have adhd\nand for a while i was like i hate this\nthing you know it's hard for me to\norganize and all this stuff\nbut i'm starting to recognize it also as\na gift right because i\ncan be you know i have these things i'm\nworking through however\ni'm very creative and i can think of\nthings in ways that people can't and i\ncan connect with people in like such\ndifferent\ncapacity and i'm starting to see it as\nmy own magic\nso i'm curious like have you experienced\nthat also in some ways where you're like\nyou know this is a thing\nand\nit's kind of a gift in its own way\num you know that sounds amazing and i i\ni don't know you know i i\ni've thought about it before um in some\nsense like in some ways i\ni really do appreciate that i've gone\nthrough this journey because i would not\nbe who i am today if not right and it's\nreally enabled me to\ndevelop so much more empathy towards\neveryone right and compassion as well so\ni've\ni've definitely become a better person\nthrough through this journey\num but in terms of like a gift\nman i have to say that depression is not\na gift\nit sucks but\num but with um hypomania i used to think\nit was a gift um\nbecause i would be really\nreally excitable and i'd be able to make\nfriends with so many people and i would\ncreate so many new projects and i would\nbe super creative\num\nbut\nbut um i wouldn't say it's a\ngift per se because um i'm honestly\nenjoying my life being so stable right\nnow it took me a while to to\nreally embrace it because i was like\nit's really boring\nand i think that's what i mean like you\nembracing it i'm not saying that\ncondition yeah\nyeah yeah\nit's like because of that\nthere's been that magic of becoming who\nyou are\nand\nall these insights and wisdom that\nyou've gained and now you're sharing\nwith the world\nright so it's like there's people\nwho don't know exactly what you\num or you know people go through however\nthey don't have that depth of knowledge\nand i think that can be really beautiful\ntoo you know and i think some of the\nbest artists out there are um have had\nyou know bipolar i think um van gogh\nyeah\nyeah\ni mean then some of the most amazing\nartists because the depth of the\nemotions are so powerful\nso\nyeah no it's really cool i mean i feel\nthat um you know\nfor some reason the people that i i know\nwho has like who have bipolar disorder\nare some of the most creative ones you\nknow and um\nso i think being able to embrace my\nwell\nbeing able to embrace myself in\nmy entirety that's been really a gift\nright um being able to understand what\nthis diagnosis\nmeans\num\nand what uh\ni don't know just\nyeah just being able to embrace it has\nbeen\nhas allowed me to\njust be fully myself and be comfortable\nwith who i am\nyeah and i see someone says i love my\nboring life now yeah me too\n[Laughter]\nyeah\ni think boring is like you know ordinary\ndays are the most extraordinary days you\nknow oh my gosh yeah no i've learned how\nto like you know as part of my my\nchecking in every day and checking out\nas well i practice quickly\nyeah i check in and check out every day\nand and i practice gratitude as a part\nof it and i i just learned to enjoy the\nsimplest things you know and\nand depression like this is actually\nmore part of um\nme\nnot being depressed because like when\nyou're depressed you're like everything\nis crap right but then by practicing\ngratitude i've learned to enjoy life so\nmuch more and when when i have good days\ni feel that i can really experience it\nfully and not take it for granted so\nyeah i think that's actually a huge gift\nthat's come up come out of this\nbeautiful awesome yeah it's like when\nyou have days where you're feeling good\nyou you go out and live it and i feel\nthat way when i'm you know sick with a\ncold or something i'm like\nbut like i'm gonna feel so good when i\ncan go do all the things and i'm never\ngonna you know slack out on my workout\nagain because you know having health is\nso good and like you remember how good\nit is to be\nwell right so yeah that's beautiful yeah\nyeah question\num hey you guys so we have sabrina we\nhere from calm collective asia and we're\nhaving a conversation today about\nnormalizing mental health challenges and\ndisorders and being able to talk about\nit and\num you know that's really the mission of\ncalm collective asia as well and um you\nknow sabrina here she has graciously\nshared her very vulnerable story with us\ntoday regarding bipolar and her journey\naround it and really quickly before we\ngo i'm i'm curious um do you guys have\nany questions for her\nif you do please you know type your\nquestions in the chat we'll be here just\nfor a few more minutes\num\nand\nyeah\num let's see here i'm just kind of\nlooking here from asia\nasia is fun you know true i know um\nwell thank you\ni'm looking as well\nwhat was the app you used\nwhat um\noh i think you were talking about some\nkind of app where you are logging in\nyeah\nyeah so that one was for by okay i have\nmy phone right now like it's very rude\nto like look at my phone\nbut but hey it's okay um it's called\nemotes\nso it's specifically created for bipolar\ndisorder is it e\nm-o-o-d-s\nyeah\nand i actually have this app also called\ngrateful\nthat i can\ndo like real crew journaling\ngratitude is such a big cornerstone of\nyou know what i coach my clients with\nand gratitude is so healing it really is\nit is it is yeah it's oh okay so i have\nthis um so this was actually uh shared\nby my my partner um so i had this mild\ndepressive episode two years ago and um\nand\ni got introduced to the cookie jar\nexercise and he was like okay so\nright like he basically told me to sit\ndown for five minutes or ten minutes and\nwrite down all my cookies in my cookie\njar and basically i had to like\ncelebrate all my small bins right and\ni now do this at the i think every like\nfour to six months i would just sit down\nand like write down all the things that\ni i\nwon right all my small bins and\nthat really helps me uh ground myself\nand maybe it makes me feel better when i\nfeel down\ni love that i love that and if you're\nopen to share some wins that's going on\nwhether in your life right now or calm\ncollect of asia i know you guys just had\na beautiful summit um yeah share with us\nwhat are some wins for you lately\nwait for me yeah oh my gosh\noh okay um\nah\nsmall bins\nso many things um\nall right so well for calm collective\nasia we just did our\num first\nlarge larger scale um virtual mental\nwell-being festival called com con\nit was so much fun yeah my big win was\nthat\nyeah we had no technical difficulties\num no no it was great yeah that was like\nyou know big win\nnow everything ran really smoothly um we\nhad such great speakers on board um\nyeah and and there was so much\nengagement from our audience and it was\nso cute like people were able to to\nclick on emojis and you know have little\nhearts flying all over the screen so i\nhad a good time\num\nsmall wins another small win that or\nactually a big win that i i think we\nhave is that um we've been running our\ncalm circles these uh\nsupport circles for well-being beautiful\ncircles yeah and um oh my goodness it's\nso nice to connect with our community\nand have people actually come together\nand share\nvulnerably and openly so that's been\nlovely\nyeah that's beautiful and we have a\nquestion here have you ran into this\nissue um\nwhen you have no support system and no\nmotivation to seek out any\nyeah\nyou know that's when those were the days\nwhere i was just like i'm in bed and i\nhope i don't wake up you know\num\nso that's that's happened many times and\nit's really hard because um\nhaving no motivation to seek out help i\ni guess\nthe question is why do you have no\nmotivation to seek out help um it's\nprobably because you yeah i think in in\nthat kind of state you're so consumed\nby just feeling so bad right yeah and\ni think for me at least i can share\nabout my personal experience\nwhen i felt so horrible about myself and\nabout everything in general and\neverything weighs so heavily\ni felt that it took so much energy to\neven share about this with someone else\nand i and because it was weighing down\non me so much\ni felt that i don't want to be someone\nelse down with with me i don't want to\ndrag someone else down and therefore let\nme just sit in this mess let me just\nyou know be like let me just weigh\nmyself down and hope that i never get up\nyeah\nso um\nit's really hard um i would probably\ntry to think about okay who\nwho's like the safest person i can\nturn to right now\nfor me it was actually\nyou know of all people i surprise myself\nand i reach out to my mom um who's like\nmiles and miles away in new zealand and\nthe closest people are hardest to reach\nout to yeah yeah so like at that time i\nhad like i was hanging out with a lot of\nfriends but i didn't feel like reaching\nout to them\nand\nyeah for some reason i just reached out\nto\nto my mom and\nshe then realized that okay i really\nneeded help and\num yeah i mean there's a whole story\nabout that but like um i think the point\nis to to find the person who's\nwho you feel most comfortable with and\nwhat i\nuh during another time i face this\nscenario i guess was\nwhat i did was actually call one of the\nfree hotlines available\nso there are quite a lot of free like\nhelplines\naround mental health and i just decided\nto call one of them yeah and and that\nactually helped me\nand there's one in singapore or is this\nin singapore we have quite a few in\nsingapore um and i i believe like if\nyou're outside of singapore you can\ntotally just jump on skype and call the\nnumber um\ninformation that we can post in the\ncomments later yeah yeah they're please\nfeeling this way and they really feel\nlike they have no one to reach out to\nthey know that they can call that number\nyeah we have quite a few in singapore um\nactually so many that people don't know\nabout um like this is samaritans of\nsingapore aware which is more for like\nwomen's and\nsexual assault\num\nand then there's also like there's a\nnational care hotline as well that my so\nactually my friends running that one\num it's it's\nthere's a lot of resources out available\nonline and people are\nready to speak with you yeah beautiful\nthank you so much for sharing that\nbecause these are such practical\nadvice and tips and i think it's really\nreally helpful let me see if there's\nanything else um\nlet's see\n[Music]\noh i see someone saying that talking to\npeople online has gone so stale it is\ntrue it's really um\nit's hard right because you don't get\nthat connection\nyeah\nand um\ni wonder whether people are reaching out\nthrough like online forums like just\ntyping because i feel firstly i'm not\nmuch of a texter it's really tiring to\ntext and\nyou don't get the context right um yeah\nyeah so\nyeah\nbut even calls like these with like like\nthe one i'm having with you it's it's\nreally critical\nit is the first time i'm technically\nmeeting her on face-to-face\nzoom like or you know video like this\nand it is true i mean obviously there's\nnothing that's going to replace the\nphysical like you know getting together\nwith people and i know in some parts of\nthe world right now that may or may not\nbe even a possibility however\nthere are different ways um that we can\nutilize technology to feel that\nconnection\nand you know quite honestly like during\nthe um earlier part of the pandemic i\nwould literally just\nschedule zoom calls with random people\nall the time as if i'm just meeting them\nand\nit was it was really helpful you know so\neven your you know own friends and\nfamily like you can schedule these kind\nof zoom calls with people and stay\nconnected and\nyou know\nso sometimes connecting with strangers\nis easier than yeah reaching out oh for\nsure\nyes yes no i have so much to say about\nthat because like your friends and\nfamily have this like\nyou know this this idea of you that\nthey've painted for themselves right\nsince you were born\nyeah and um\nand sometimes when you want to talk\nabout something really vulnerable it's\nso much easier to talk to someone you\ndon't know because you can just be your\nyour true self right\nso um yeah especially when you're going\nthrough like depression or something\nbecause that's kind of\noutside of your usual self right so then\nfriends and family will be like who are\nyou you know who's this version of you\nso yeah\ni think in those moments it's so\nimportant to just remind our logical\nbrain that we are loved and that we're\nnot alone and even if we did reach out\nto\nyou know our friends or family they're\ngonna love us and if they don't\nthat's okay you're better off without so\nyeah yeah no i've had yeah you know i\nreached out to quite a lot of friends as\nwell and\nand\nyou know i found i basically i found out\nwho my real friends were because um\nyeah um because quite a few i did i did\nface a lot of judgment from friends\nand family as well and uh yeah they were\nlike um sabrina you're just being\ndramatic\nand you're just being like you know\nyou're just being manipulative and\nasking for attention\nwhich uh you know was very hurtful but i\ncan see where they're coming from\nbecause they they were not\num\ni guess they're they're not well-versed\nwith\nmental health conditions so\nit's okay\nand if you know if\npeople don't have the\nif they're not able to extend their\nsympathy towards you then\nthen that's okay that's kind of one\nthing\nyeah\nyeah totally and\nyeah i i feel like\num\ni mean there's a whole different topic\nbut those people who might be triggered\nby what you're sharing or they don't\naccept you for what you're sharing my\nmy suspicion is they probably have\nsomething that they want to be more open\nabout and they don't have the courage so\nthey're being triggered by\nsomeone who is living their truth right\nso\num you know i believe that's their own\njourney to heal\nand you're doing\nyeah and you have a voice and you're\nsharing it and you're making into this\nreally beautiful purposeful\nyou know movement and organization so\nwe're so grateful for you\nyeah i'm and i'm grateful for psych2go\nas well it's been so amazing um you know\njust following the the videos and\nwatching everything and it's it really\nyou know i\nthink content like content like i guess\nwhat we're doing it's it's really\nhelping a lot of people feel less alone\nright and um and feel more understood\nyeah\ni i believe and this is you know i guess\nit's on topic but like i really do\nbelieve that we're all connected like\nyou know we're all literally all\nconnected in one way or another\nand you know of course like the\nfrequency or the depth of how each\nperson feels depending on you know what\nthey're moving through might be\ndifferent but i have a belief that every\nsingle person\nexperiences all those emotions at one\npoint in their life unless you know they\nhave whatever you know their own\nconditions but\nyou know in that i think we are really\ntruly all connected and\nyeah so being able to talk about so\nbeautiful and thank you so much for\nopening up having this conversation like\ni almost forgot that we're like even\nhere you know with\nyou know\nother people yeah\nit's just such a it was just a real\nconversation and i just felt like you\nwere just here just being you and just\nsharing like everything\nthat you get to share with the world and\ni do\nif i do see that as your magic so\nyou know i think it's\nit's beautiful that you're turning this\ninto a way for you to contribute to the\nworld and\nyou know that's your gift so thank you\nfor sharing your gift\nthank you that's like korean heart\nback from her\nexactly\nyeah no thank you so much i mean i think\nwhat we really want to do here is that\nwe want to foster\num more authentic conversations right\nand we want people to be just\ncomfortably themselves and i think all\nof us have so much to offer in our own\nhuman experiences that's way beyond um\nyou know the glossy beautiful lives that\nwe show off on social media there's so\nmuch\nin each and every one of us that we can\nshare\num\nand there's so much i guess there's so\nmuch like wisdom within ourselves as\nwell if we if we just take a pause and\nand look into ourselves right yeah um so\nyeah i i do hope that we can\ni guess first start with having those\nvulnerable conversations with ourselves\nso that we can then find the courage to\ndo it with others that gave me\ngoosebumps yeah we get to have those\nvulnerable conversations with ourselves\nfirst and i think that's why meditation\nand journaling and talking to a\ntherapist or you know talking to people\nabout this is so important because\nsometimes like we don't even\nwe are not even having that vulnerable\nconversation with ourselves and it\nstarts there\nyeah so\nwell this is amazing thank you so much\nfor sharing your heart sharing your\nstories if you guys enjoyed this or you\nwere moved by this or if you really\nappreciate a sabrina sharing her story\nplease please comment below if you're\nwatching this replay or please share in\nthe chat um and curious like
