    "transcript": "- Hello, Psych2Goers. Welcome back.\nDo you have a crush on someone?\nDo you feel like they're\nbarely aware of your existence?\nNo problem.\nTo help you with that,\nhere are seven things to get\nyour crush to notice you.\nNumber one, have a sense of humor.\nEverybody loves to laugh.\nAnd a little sense of\nhumor goes a long way.\nResearchers from Illinois State University\nand DePaul University found in their study\nthat when you use humor\nwhen getting to know an\nacquaintance at first,\nthat individual has a better\nchance of liking you more.\nThey even found that\nengaging in funny tasks\nmay raise romantic attraction.\nSo, if you're looking\nto attract your crush,\ntry cracking a joke or two,\nand others may just fall in\nlove with your sense of humor.\nNumber two, show you like them.\nHave you ever heard of\nreciprocity of attraction\nor reciprocal liking?\nThis is a psychological\nterm used to describe\nwhen one person starts to\nfeel attraction from someone\nonly after hearing that\nindividual likes them.\nA 1959 study published in Human Relations\ntold their group subjects\nthat certain individuals in their group\nwould likely like them.\nAfter group discussions,\nsubjects told researchers\nwho they liked the most.\nCan you guess who they liked?\nYep.\nThe subjects chose the people\nthey were told initially liked them.\nSo, if you admire someone\nand get them to notice you,\nkey them into the idea that you like them.\nThis may get them to\nstart thinking of you more\nand therefore get them to like you back.\nNumber three, learn to\nplay a musical instrument.\nThinking of learning a musical instrument?\nA 2014 research study found\nthat those who could compose\nand play complex music\nwere seen as more attractive by women.\nAccording to the lead researcher\nat the University College Dublin,\nthe ability to create complex music\ncould be indicative of\nadvanced cognitive abilities.\nThey go on to say that consequently,\nwomen may acquire genetic\nbenefits for offspring\nby selecting musicians able\nto create more complex music\nas sexual partners.\nNow may be a good time\nto learn that guitar you've been eyeing.\nSerenade time.\nNumber four, own a pet.\nIf you've been thinking\nabout adopting a pet,\nyou are on the right track\nfor more than one reason.\nIn 2018, two French social psychologists\ndecided to conduct an experiment.\nThey had a dashing young\nFrenchman named Antoine\napproach 240 randomly chosen women\nto ask for their phone\nnumber in hopes of a date.\nHalf of the women were\napproached by just Antoine.\nThe other half, Antoine approached them\nwith an adorable gray dog\nnamed Gwendu by his side.\nA small 10% of women\ngave Antoine their number\nwhen he was alone.\nBut Antoine's odds went up to 30%\nwhen Gwendu was his wingman.\nThis is likely due to the\nidea that owning a pet\nshows that you can handle responsibility,\nare caring, committed, and\nthe dog's just really cute.\nNeed further proof a pet will\nmake you more approachable?\nIn a research study led by\nUniversity of Nevada, Las Vegas,\nAnthropologist Peter Gray\nfound that 36% of men and 35% of women\nwere more attracted to\nsomeone who owned a pet.\nIf you adopt a rescue\nanimal, your odds only grow.\n49% of men and 64% of\nwomen were more attracted\nto someone who adopted a pet.\nAlso, if you don't like pets,\nthe data doesn't look good for you.\n54% of men and 75% of women said\nthey wouldn't consider dating someone\nwho didn't like pets at all.\nIf you wanna get your crush's attention,\nyou'll seem more approachable\nif you have a furry friend by your side.\nNumber five, show confidence\nand use open body language.\nHave you ever heard confidence is key?\nWell showing some confidence can be key\nto getting your crush's interest.\nDisplaying a bit of confidence\nis often seen as attractive.\nWhy?\nGenerally, people want to be confident\nso seeing someone who is\nconfident is admirable.\nOne way you can appear more confident\nis to display open body language.\nKeep your chest and torso more open\nand try not to cross your arms as much.\nClosed body language can\ngive off the impression\nyou aren't available or\nsimply don't wanna talk.\nAnd remember, availability is key\nin giving your crush a\nchance to talk to you.\nNumber six, choose deeper\nconversation over small talk.\nResearch from Harvard found\nthat deep conversations\nand meaningfully talking about yourself\ncan help activate the very\nsame regions of your brain\nas delicious food or sex activates.\nThe study states that,\nover a 45-minute period,\nsubject pairs carried out self-disclosure\nand relationship-building tasks\nthat gradually escalated in intensity.\nStudy one found greater\npost-interaction closeness\nwith these tasks versus\ncomparable small-talk tasks.\nSo, instead of bringing\nup the rain or the clouds,\nmaybe choose to delve into\nthose interesting discussions\nwith your crush instead.\nAnd number seven, be a leader.\nImagine this, you've just\nbeen assigned to a group\nfor your next group project.\nAnd your crush happens to\nbe in the same team as you.\nThis is your chance to\nget their attention.\nIf you want them to notice\nyou, volunteer to be a leader.\nIn a 2014 study, researchers explored\nwhether feelings towards other people\ninfluence the perceptions\nof others' attractiveness.\nHaving their subjects in groups,\nthey found subordinates\nrated their group leader\nas significantly more attractive\nthan leaders outside their group.\nSo, even if there is no\nrole of group leader,\nbe a bit more vocal in your project,\nguide the next group project,\nthrow out some ideas, teach others.\nThere are many ways you\ncan prove you are a capable\nand apparently an attractive group leader.\nSo, will you use any of these things\nto get your crush to notice you?\nIf so, which ones?\nWill you be adopting a new
