few sets of traits\nintelligent people have in common.\nIf you find yourself relating\nto many of these traits,\nyou may just be smarter than you think,\nor it's just a coincidence?\nResearch has found that smart people\nhave these six common traits.\nHow many do you have?\nFirst up, number one, they're funny.\nWho doesn't love a joke or two?\nTurns out smart people seem to be\nsome of the funniest\nindividuals out there.\nAccording to a study published in 2011\nby psychologist Gil Greengross\nand Geoffrey Miller,\ncomedians may have it easier in many ways.\nThe study found that out of\n400 student participants,\n200 men and 200 women,\nthose who wrote funnier cartoon captions\nscored better on a test\nof verbal intelligence,\nso if you have a bit of humor,\nit may benefit you in\nmore ways than you think.\nNumber two, you're curious\nand open to new experiences.\nAre you curious?\nDo you enjoy learning about history,\nabout other cultures,\nor interesting facts?\nLicensed psychotherapist\nChristine Scott-Hudson\ntold Bustle that intelligent people\nengage their passions and ask questions\nlike who, what, when, where,\nhow, why, and what if.\nShe explains they're also very\nopen to trying new things.\nAccording to 2016\nresearch from researchers\nAdrian Furnham and Helen Cheng,\nthere's a connection between openness\nto experience and your\nintelligence as a kid.\nThe research study used\na longitudinal dataset\nof 5,672 adults followed for 50 years.\nThey found that children aged 11,\nwho had a high score on their IQ test,\nwere found to be more open to experience\nwhen assessed at the age of 50.\nThey also explained that all of the big\nfive personality traits,\nopenness to experience\nis often shown as the\nstrongest correlate of ability,\nparticularly creativity, and intelligence,\nso if you're open to new experiences,\nyou may also happen to\nhave a high IQ as well.\nHave you heard of Parkinson's law?\nIf you're given a week's\ntime to finish a task\nthat should only take\nyou a day to complete,\ndo you unnecessarily stretch out the task\nand end up completing it within a week?\nIf so, we'd like to introduce\nour sponsor on this video,\nSunsama, an app that helps you organize\nall of your work into a\nhandy to-do list for the day.\nThey're offering a risk-free\ntwo-week trial right now,\nso go check it out.\nWhen you launch the app for\nthe first time for the day,\nyou'll be asked, what\ndo you want to do today?\nOnce you add the tasks\nthat you want to complete,\nyou can customize how much\ntime you want to dedicate\nto each task and group them\ninto helpful categories.\nOne of their coolest features\nis that they tell you\nwhen you set too much work for the day,\nor when the number of tasks\nyou set is unrealistic.\nThey'll advise you to defer\nsome of the work for tomorrow,\nso you don't burn yourself out.\nSunsama uses Goodhart,\nHofstader and Parkinson's law\nas their principles to enable people\nto do work better and be more productive.\nIf you like what you heard,\nuse the link down below\nto get a risk-free two-week trial.\nStart working smarter,\nnot harder, with Susama.\nNumber three, they're loners.\nAre you an introvert?\nDo you favor the days where\nyou get to spend the evening\nin pleasant solitude alone in your room?\nWell, odds are, you're pretty smart.\nResearchers Norman P.\nLi and Satoshi Kanazawa\nhad 15,000 individuals, 18 to 28,\nto take a survey and IQ test.\nThe individuals who\nwere highly intelligent\nwere found to be not as\nhappy with their lives\nthe more frequently they socialize.\nNumber four, they're highly empathetic.\nWhat about emotional intelligence?\nMany psychologists say that empathy\nis an important part of\nhigh emotional intelligence.\nIf you're open to new experiences,\nyou may just be one who\nis open and understanding\nto other individuals' experiences as well,\nwhich means you may be\nhigh on the empathy scale.\nIf so, your emotional intelligence\nmay just be as great too.\nNumber five, they're often neurotic.\nAre you anxious?\nDo you worry?\nHow much?\nIf you worry more than the average Joe,\nthen you may just be smarter than him too,\nat least when it comes\nto verbal intelligence.\nIn a 2015 study, researchers\nhad 126 undergraduate students\ncomplete questionnaires,\nindicating how much they worried,\nruminated on worrying thoughts,\nand thought about\nscenarios that upset them.\nWhat did they find?\nStudents who often spend time worrying\nand ruminating on\nthoughts held a high score\nin measures of verbal intelligence.\nThose who didn't worry as much scored\nhigher in nonverbal intelligence.\nAnd number six, they're adaptable\nand recognize when they need to change.\nCan you adopt well under stress?\nCan you recognize when you're the one\nwho needs to change a part of yourself\nin order to achieve your goals?\nMany psychologists believe adaptability\nis a sign of intelligence.\nRobert J. Sternberg,\nprofessor of psychology\nand dean of the School\nof Arts and Sciences\nat Tufts University,\nwrites that psychologists\nhave generally agreed that adapting\nto the environment is\nthe key to understanding\nboth what intelligence\nis and what it does.\nHe continues, stating that such adaptation\nmay occur in a variety of settings:\na student in school learns the material\nhe needs to know in order\nto do well in a course,\na physician treating a patient\nwith unfamiliar symptoms\nlearns about the underlying disease,\nor an artist reworks the painting\nto convey a more coherent impression.\nFor the most part,\nadaptation involves making\na change in oneself in order to cope\nmore effectively with the environment,\nbut it can also mean\nchanging the environment,\nor finding an entirely new one.\nSo even if you don't\nthink you're the smartest,\nand perhaps have a hard\ntime on a project or task,\nyou may just need to change\nyour way of thinking,\nadapt to the scenario,\ntry a new approach to\nstudying or creative strategy.\nLearning to adapt could very well help\nimprove your overall intelligence.\nWho knows, it may just\nbe the smartest decision\nyou ever make, so how many\nof these traits do you have?\nLet us know in the comments down below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did, don't forget\nto click the \"like\" button\nand \"share\" it with someone\nwhose intelligence you admire.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAnd as always, thanks for watching."
