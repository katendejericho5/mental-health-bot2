    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nEver wondered what signifies\nin making one seem attractive?\nDo you think you're not\ngood-looking enough, smart enough,\nor interesting enough for people to like?\nWhoa, stop right there.\nChances are,\ndespite being able to rate\nothers attractiveness,\nyou can't make accurate enough measures\nof your own attractiveness.\nOh yes, truly.\nAnd though it's only natural to wonder\nwhat other people think of you\nin terms of looks and personality,\nsometimes your own\nself-doubts and insecurities\nkeep you from seeing just\nhow much those around us\nactually like and admire us.\nSo if you're one of those people\nwho have a bad habit of\nputting themselves down\nand underestimating themselves,\nthen we are here to prove you wrong.\nHere are seven signs to look out for\nthat mean people secretly\nfind you attractive.\nNumber one.\nThey like to look at you.\nEver been the one to send\nlonging stares at your crushes\nwhile you think they aren't looking?\nOr, have you been at the receiving end\nof one of those dreamy gazes?\nChances are, if you have been,\nyou probably took it the wrong way,\nbecause when people tend to stare at you\nand pay special attention to you,\nit makes you feel awkward\nand self-conscious,\nso much so, that you start to wonder\nif there's something weird\nabout the way you look\nor how you're dressed.\nBut if you notice people\nlooking at you a lot,\nit may be because they\nsecretly find you attractive.\nAww.\nNumber two.\nThey enter your personal bubble.\nDo they seem to have a problem\nof always invading your personal space?\nAre you annoyed when people take liberties\nwith your personal space?\nYeah.\nBut hey,\nthis doesn't necessarily\nhave to mean something bad.\nWhether they're good friends\nor just acquaintances,\npeople gravitate towards you a lot,\nstrangers sit close to you\non the bus or the train,\npeople often greet you\nwith hugs and warm touches,\nand everyone you talk\nto you seems to lean in\nand try to get as close as\npossible when you speak.\nAccording to a study,\nall of these examples are nonverbal cues\nthat signify romantic\nor platonic attraction.\nIsn't that kinda sweet?\nNumber three.\nThey seem flustered by you.\nHave you heard of good stress?\nWait, what, stress and good?\nBut here's the thing.\nAccording to psychology,\nfeeling attraction towards another person\noften triggers a feeling\nof good stress within us,\nand this good stress\nis what causes us to\nhave nervous reactions\nlike fidgeting,\nstuttering, laughing a lot,\nwalking awkwardly, and\nstroking the back of our neck,\nor feeling at a loss for words.\nSound familiar?\nIf people often seem flustered, nervous,\nor intimidated by you,\nit could very well be because\nthey're attracted to you\nand are trying their best to hide it.\nHow cute.\nNumber four.\nThey often come up to talk to you.\nAre they constantly\nvying for your attention?\nDo they always make a beeline for you\nwhenever they spot you out and about?\nIf so, are you reeled in effortlessly\nby their witty and\ninteresting conversation?\nWhen we feel attracted to someone,\nit makes us want to talk about them\nand spend more time with them.\nThey wanna flirt with\nyou, banter with you,\nshare stories with you,\nmake you laugh and have fun,\ninterest in conversations with you.\nHow nice is that?\nNumber five.\nThey rarely compliment you.\nYeah, it sounds counter-intuitive,\nbut hear me out.\nIn reality, when other people\nthink you're attractive,\nthey'll rarely compliment you anymore.\nWhy?\nWell, because they assume\nthat everything good\nthat they find about\nyou, you already know.\nDid you dress up and in\na cute new outfit today\nor impress yourself by giving\nan important presentation?\nThose who already find you attractive\nwill most likely just give you\nan apathetic acknowledgement,\nlike \"You look nice\" or \"Oh,\ngood for you,\" and nothing more\nbecause they think that you're aware\nof your own attractiveness\nand don't need any reminding about it.\nNumber six.\nThey're surprised by your insecurities.\nAbsolutely.\nThey're caught off guard every\ntime you talk yourself down\nor open up about something\nyou don't like about yourself.\nThis is because, from their point of view,\nsomeone as attractive as you\nshouldn't be insecure about anything.\nThink about it.\nWho's the most attractive person you know?\nDo you think they have anything\nthey should feel insecure about?\nNo, right?\nWell, the truth is\neveryone has insecurities\nand struggles with\nself-esteem from time to time,\nand attractive people\naren't any different.\nAnd number seven, they\nact extremely towards you.\nFinally, but perhaps most importantly,\nif you are an attractive person,\npeople may display a more positive\nor negative attitude towards\nyou than they normally would.\nSome people may become\nnicer and more polite,\noffering to do favors for you\nor be more understanding of\nyour mistakes for example,\nwhile others may feel jealous, insecure,\nand resentful of your attractiveness,\nand so, feel like they\nhave to compete with you\nfor everything and tear you down\nby criticizing you or gossiping about you.\nYikes!\nFocusing too much on all of\nyour flaws and shortcomings\nkeeps you from seeing all of the things\nthat make you wonderful,\ngreat, and unique.\nSo it sure would help\nto take a page from everyone else's book\nand start to look at yourself\nthrough your most admirable\nqualities and characteristics\na little more often.\nWe hope we were able to give you insight\ninto some of the signs\nthat you can tell if someone\nfinds you attractive.\nWhat do you think?\nDid we crack the code?\nDo any of these describe your experiences?\nAre you starting to realize\nthat people may find you more\nattractive than they let on?\nLeave a
