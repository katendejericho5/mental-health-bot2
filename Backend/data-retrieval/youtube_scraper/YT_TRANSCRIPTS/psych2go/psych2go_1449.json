    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hello,\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nWhat do you think of when\nyou hear the word depression?\nLike many, you may imagine someone crying\nwhile curled up on the ground.\nBut there's more to it than that.\nSo, to help you understand more\nof what depression really is like\nand to debunk some common misconceptions,\nhere are six things people with\ndepression want you to know.\nNumber one, depression has\nnothing to do with being weak.\nMany people often equate\nhaving a mental illness\nwith being weak, but that's just not true.\nPeople who are suffering from depression\nmight not be able to get\nout of bed every morning\nor cope with everyday stress,\nbut that doesn't mean they're less worthy.\nIt's easy to confuse their\npredicament with laziness\nand call them weak,\nselfish, or even annoying,\nbecause you don't see\nwhat they're really\ngoing through every day.\nIt's important to understand\nthat if your friend can't cheer up\nlike how everyone else does,\nit's not because of a lack of effort.\nFighting against something\nthat can be so overwhelming\nyet invisible to others is exhausting,\nand taxing to anyone's mental health.\nNumber two, it's important\nto be aware of their common triggers.\nPeople who suffer from\ndepression often know\nwhat sets off their dark mood,\nand so they may avoid\ncertain places or objects\nin order to protect themselves.\nIf they've previously told you\nthat something specific\nmakes them feel terrible,\ntry to refrain from\nsuggesting any activities\nthat could trigger them\nand worsen their condition.\nDon't take this personally either.\nWhen your favorite movie night\nsuddenly becomes too much\nfor someone close to you,\nit's not an attack on you\nbut a difficult situation\nwhere they have no other choice\nas it's really hard for them too.\nNumber three, don't make\nthem feel like they're wrong\nif they talk about suicide.\nIn many cultures, suicide\nis a taboo subject,\nso many people stray away\nfrom talking about it at all.\nBut there's always a reason\nwhy some depressed people\nwant to end their life.\nMany of them may secretly\nwish to end their lives\nbecause they can't\nimagine living like this\nfor the rest of their lives.\nYet, that doesn't mean\nthat every suicidal person\nwants to act on those thoughts\nor that people should avoid\nbringing that topic up.\nIf someone says something\nalong the lines of,\n\"I wish I wasn't alive anymore,\"\nIt doesn't mean you need\nto tell them they're wrong\nor to simply ignore their remark.\nInstead, it may be more helpful\nto listen to what they have to say.\nIf you or someone else\nare feeling depressed\nor contemplating suicide,\nplease remember that you're not alone.\nWe've added a list of suicide hotlines\nin the description below.\nPlease use them.\nNumber four, do not compare sufferings.\nMany people often make the mistake\nof comparing one person's emotional pain\nto another's physical pain.\nHowever, one is caused by a\nchemical imbalance in the brain\nwhile the other is caused by an injury.\nWhen you question someone's\npain by saying things like,\n\"I felt just as bad\nbefore and I got over it.\nYou can get over this too,\" or,\nYou should stop feeling so sad.\nYou don't know what real\nsadness feels like,\"\nyou're not being helpful\nand may only be contributing\nto the stigma surrounding mental illness.\nDepression isn't something\npeople decide to have.\nNobody wants to suffer\nfrom depression, trust me.\nAnd it has nothing to do with\nbeing weak, lazy, or too free.\nFor those who are not\naffected by this illness,\nunderstand that it takes a lot of strength\nto deal with the pain every single day,\nand just living their lives often ends up\nbeing more difficult than it\nmight seem from the outside.\nNumber five, do not judge\ntheir way of coping.\nFor some, talking about their feelings\nis what helps the most,\nbut others might need something different,\nno matter how strange it seems.\nIf someone told you they feel better\nif they write songs all\nnight long, then let them,\neven if you think there's another way\nthat is more helpful or logical.\nSometimes you might need to step back\nknowing that there is no\none sure cure for everybody.\nAnd number six, give them space.\nNo matter how much someone\nlikes spending time with others,\nit can become mentally draining\nfor someone with depression\nwhen there's too much social contact,\nsuch as gatherings and\nphone conversations.\nYou might find that they need to be alone\nin order to regain some of their strength.\nThis doesn't mean that they're\nwithdrawing from the world\nor that they don't like you,\nor don't wanna engage with you anymore.\nInstead of trying to push\nthem into hanging out\nor talking with you constantly,\nrespect their wishes\nand give them as much space as they need\nin order to come back full of energy\nand ready for whatever's ahead.\nWhat are your experiences\nwith people with depression?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video with those\nwho
