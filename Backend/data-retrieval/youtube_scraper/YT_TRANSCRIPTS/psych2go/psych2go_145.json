    "transcript": "the magical thing about having finite\ntime on Earth is that we get to exist at\nthe same time as the people we love\nwhether they're friends family or\nsomeone really special who you love\nromantically but sometimes these people\naren't in our lives for very long people\nmove they pass away or maybe a\nrelationship ends suddenly but sometimes\nthe end comes much slower as you mature\nand grow you don't even realize that\nit's leading to the end of the\nrelationship one day you might think\nabout the relationship whether it's with\nfriends or a partner and\nthink have I outgrown\nthem now that you found yourself\nwatching this video we're here to ask a\nfew questions that might help you figure\nthis\nout is the spark still there intimacy\nand affection will waver over the course\nof a relationship so don't be\ndiscouraged just yet that's natural as\ncouples therapist Dr Bruce Talmer\nexplains in his book reigniting The\nSpark why stable relationship lose\nintimacy and how to get it back\nrelationships can end by fire or ice\nlet's take a look at what a\nrelationship's death by Ice would look\nlike according to Bruce Chalmer\nbasically the passion behind the\nrelationship has died arguments aren't\neven worth having anymore sexual\nintimacy has dried up things between you\nand your partner have become dreary and\npredictable Dr Chalmer goes on to say\nthat if this problem isn't addressed you\nwill end up feeling alone miserable and\nunfulfilled the solution is to restore\ncommunication and seek intimacy but the\nroot cause may be that you are beginning\nto outgrow your partner the petty\narguments aren't worth it anymore you\ndon't feel attracted to them like you\nused to but if you aren't convinced ask\nyourself do you still share the same\ngoals our Direction in life is bound to\nchange as we discover more about\nourselves and find new things we're\npassionate about our goals change with\nus for example in relationships the\nrelationship might have started with an\nunderstanding that neither of you want\nkids over time you might have grown to\nrealize that you actually would like to\nhave children eventually this is\nsomething to discuss as soon as you\nrealize this change in yourself because\nthere is a limit to how long you can go\nwithout discussing it this also isn't\nsomething that either partner can be\nasked to compromise on psychologist\nJudith gar and colleagues published a\nstudy in the Journal of research and\npersonality\nthey found that this can be fatal for\nthe relationship but also found that\nyour effective well-being which is how\noften you experience positive emotions\nor Good Moods is positively impacted by\nsharing goals with your partner if you\nfeel like you've lost your sense of self\nand are not sure what your goals are\noutside of your\nrelationship maybe you should ask\nyourself are you becoming or are you\nalready\ncodependent according to Medical news\ntoday in its simplest terms a\ncodependent relationship is when one\npartner needs the other partner who in\nturn needs to be needed this circular\nrelationship is the basis of what\nexperts refer to when they describe the\ncycle of\ncodependency it's nice to know that you\nhave someone you can rely on but it's\nimportant to remember that you can do\nthings on your own you should still feel\nlike you can make decisions that affect\nthe relationship while in a relationship\nyou should still be aware of who you are\nand pursue the things that you enjoy\nclinical psychologist Mimi bomersbach\nand colleagues found that there is a\nrelationship between codependency and\npower if you feel like your partner is\nmaking all of the decisions or none of\nthem there is an imbalance in power this\ncan indicate that one of you is\noutgrowing the other interestingly the\nstudy also found that this issue affects\nboth men and women alike are you in\ndifferent transitional stages transition\ncan mean a lot of things going from high\nschool to university is a transition\nmoving away is also a transition there\nare also transitions that happen inside\nof us as we learn more about ourselves\nand become different people from who we\nwere for example a year ago authors\nWilliam and Susan Bridges came up with\nthe bridges transition model which\nidentifies three phases these are the\nending the neutral zone and the new\nbeginning the ending could be finishing\nschool or moving out the neutral zone is\nonce you've moved out or found a new job\nbut you aren't fully adjusted the new\nbeginning is actually what it sounds\nlike you finally made a new group of\nfriends or started that new job and\nyou've gotten to know everyone when\nthere are differences between you and\nyour partner stages in life it can\ncreate a rift if you need to move on but\nyour partner doesn't want to or if your\nAmbitions disrupt what they are\ncomfortable with at the moment it could\nlead to conflict it seems like an\ninevitable end you can't compromise on\nthe fact that you are changing so what\ncan be done a solution offered by\nWilliam and Susan Bridges is\ncommunication learn how to talk about\nwhat you're feeling and your concerns\nand identify what aspects of your life\nis changing it is sad but also natural\nthat sometimes the person you're with\njust won't be interested in the\ntransition that you are undergoing all\nof this ultimately indicates one thing\nyou are outgrowing the relationship and\nthe solution of communication might not\nwork for everyone because you still have\nto ask yourself are you feeling burnt\nout as we get older and our attention\nbecomes divided Ed we should be excited\nto have some free time to spend with our\npartners clinical sociologist Rula\nalaala explains that burnout becomes\nmore likely as the couple ages and can\nbe caused by Collective and individual\nproblems such as emotional fatigue work\nexhaustion and a failure to fulfill the\nrequirements of their marital\nrelationship especially the emotional\nrequirements this isn't the same as\nlosing interest or attraction towards\nyour partner this is feeling genuinely\ndrained when around them your partner\nmakes things more exhausting for you\ninstead of making life more tolerable\nfinally we return to Dr Bruce Chalmer\nand how the fire style of Destruction\nwill destroy your relationship according\nto Dr Bruce your relationship will\nbecome a war zone constant arguments\nbroken up by a few moments of Truth can\nleave you feeling burnt out if you're\narguing with your partner often be\nhonest with yourself and take\nresponsibility for the fights that you\nstart this way of living is extremely\nunhealthy and is a culmination of all of\nthe problems we've discussed in this\nvideo if you've tried communicating your\nconcerns with your partner and you still\nfeel like there's a disconnect between\nthe two of you maybe you've outgrown the\nrelationship it's sad to say goodbye to\nsomeone especially when you've been\ntogether for a long time but letting go\nof someone is part of the process of\ngrowing sometimes in order to fully\nrealize our potential we need to leave a\nrelationship if you found these\nquestions helpful let us know in the\ncomments\nremember to leave a like on the video\nand subscribe to see more videos like\nthis if you're struggling with a\nrelationship that you feel like you have\noutgrown remember to communicate with\nyour partner you might find that they\nfeel the same way and you can find a\nsolution or move on to something that is\nhealthier for both of\nyou"
