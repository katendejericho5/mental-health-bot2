    "transcript": "hey psych2goers welcome back to another\nvideo\nbefore we start we'd like to thank you\nall for the support that you've given us\npsyctico's mission is to make psychology\nand mental health more accessible to\neveryone\nand you help us do that so thanks again\nnow back to the video\nhave you ever felt really anxious when\nyou were on a date with your crush\ndo you worry that you'll do something\nwrong to mess your date up or say\nsomething that will push them away\nit's normal to feel stressed out\nsometimes when you're with someone\nyou're attracted to after all you're\nhoping to end up in a relationship with\nthem in the long run\nso psych2go presents\nsix subtle things that might push your\ncrush away so you'll know what to avoid\nnext time you're out with that special\nsomeone\nnumber one\nover analyzing everything\nhave you ever spent so much time trying\nto find the meaning of something your\ncrush did only to realize it didn't have\nthat much meaning at all\nfor example\nif they text you less than they usually\ndo you might jump to a conclusion that\nthey're seeing someone else or that they\ndon't care about you anymore\nthis habit of over analyzing everything\ncan become obsessive and lead to a\ntendency to misinterpret your crush's\nbehavior\nand to blow things out of proportion\nwhich may ultimately push them away\nnumber two\nnot giving enough space\ndo you ever argue with your crush\nbecause they want to spend some time\nalone or with their friends\nthis might be a telling sign that you\nneed to give them some space\nwhether it's to watch a football game\nwith their friends or read a good book\nalone\nit's important for any healthy\nrelationship that each person has their\nown privacy and individual space to do\nthe things that they enjoy\na lack of privacy in space can make your\ncrush feel suffocated in your\nrelationship that may likely lead to\nmore and more distancing between the two\nof you\nnumber three\nexpecting them to read your mind\nhave you ever felt disappointed because\nyour crush didn't do exactly what you\nwere expecting of them\nperhaps you spent a lot of time getting\nto know each other and you feel like\nthey know everything about you\nwhile it may be exciting to have someone\nwho knows you so well it's important to\nremember that they can't actually read\nyour mind\nso expecting them to know how you're\nfeeling or why you might be upset is\nunrealistic and may likely lead to\nconflict and distancing\nin the end the best way to get your\nmessage across is by communicating it to\nthem\nnumber four\ntrying to change them to fit yourself\noftentimes you might get caught up in\nfocusing more on your own good than your\npartner's well-being\nbut there is a difference between\nwanting to get the best version of your\npartner and wanting them to change to\nbenefit yourself\nfor example perhaps your crush likes to\ntell jokes to make other people laugh\nbut because you don't like how much\nattention they get for it you tell them\nto stop\ntelling them to change the way they are\nnot because it will be better for them\nbut because it will be better for you\nmay cause them to push you away\nbecause you didn't accept them for who\nthey are in the first place\nnumber five\nexpecting and giving too much too soon\nhave you ever mentioned something that\nrequired a lot of commitment and felt\nyour partner suddenly drifting away\nwhen you rush your relationship and\nstart expecting and giving too much too\nsoon you run the risk of pushing them\naway\nlong-term decisions require commitment\nand responsibility when pressing your\npartner to make that decision with you\nwhen you're only at the early stages of\nyour relationship can make them feel\nextremely uncomfortable\nthis anxiety and pressure you put on\nthem may ultimately cause them to\ndistance themselves from you\nand number six\nobstructing their life goals\nthis is one of the more serious things\nthat you might do to push your crush\naway\nhave you ever felt like you were\ndragging your crush down from achieving\nsuccess on purpose\nobstructing your crush's life goals is\none way you can push them away for good\nthis may mean actively distracting and\ndiscouraging them from reaching their\ngoals making them feel guilty for\npursuing their dreams\nhave you ever done any of the things we\nmentioned if so how do you plan to\nchange that\nif you found this video helpful be sure\nto like and share it with those who\nmight benefit from it don't forget to\nsubscribe to psyc2go and hit the\nnotification bell icon to get notified\nwhenever we post a new video\nthe references and studies used in this\nvideo are added in the description below\nthanks so much for watching and we'll\nsee you in our next video\nyou"
