    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you think you're too self-involved?\nDo you have a difficult time\ndeciphering other people's feelings?\nAre you too attached to the\nidea of receiving admiration?\nSometimes these are actually\nnot an indicator of Narcissistic\nPersonality Disorder,\nbut rather a personal call for help.\nAre you lonely?\nDo you think you're coping with loneliness\nby making yourself the\ncenter of the universe?\nNarcissism and loneliness\ncan go hand in hand\nmaking it hard to\ndifferentiate between the two.\nSo let's take a look at\nfive signs you're lonely,\nnot narcissistic.\nNumber one, you try to educate yourself.\nThe fact that you're\nwatching this right now,\nshows your willingness to learn\nand immerse yourself in this topic.\nNarcissists, on the other hand,\nhave a sense of entitlement.\nThis means that they won't\nbother themselves with things\nthat show a hint of imperfection.\nBy continuously reading and\nexploring different studies,\nyou're showing a penchant for growth\nand that's important.\nIt may be that you're just\nlooking for validation\nfrom others\nbecause you don't have\nthat kind of support\nin your everyday life.\nJoining clubs, groups,\nand organizations about\nthings you're passionate about\nmight help.\nNumber two, you're open\nto personal growth.\nAre you willing to talk about your issues?\nDo you constantly self-reflect?\nAre you open to the idea of\ntalking with other people\nabout your own flaws?\nThese types of behaviors show\nyou acknowledge your imperfections\nand are brave enough to face them head on,\nall for the sake of personal progress.\nNarcissists tend to show\nhaughtiness and arrogance.\nThey most likely are not\ncomfortable with the idea\nthat there is something\nthey need to improve on.\nNumber three, your past\nrelationships ended well.\nNarcissists are magnets for\nshort-term relationships\nbecause of their constant\nneed for admiration.\nMost of their relationships\nend up being one-sided\nand when things go wrong, they flee.\nIf your previous friends,\nrelationships, partners,\nor acquaintances have nothing\nor very little bad to say about you,\nchances are you really\naren't a narcissist at all.\nMaybe the relationship ending\nwas a mutual understanding.\nYou can build sustainable relationships\nby taking it one at a time.\nBe inquisitive,\nhave genuine curiosity for others.\nOvercome your fear of being rejected\nand accept people for who they are.\nWhen you're vulnerable enough\nto open yourself up to someone,\nthey'll see the effort.\nNumber four, your emotions are genuine.\nAre you able to apologize truthfully?\nSome people do certain things\nbecause social protocol dictates so,\nnot because they feel like\nthey genuinely want to do it.\nAn example of this is saying sorry.\nAre you the type of person\nwho says they're sorry,\nbecause you're genuinely sorry\nor do you do it\nbecause it just seems like\nthe right thing to do?\nNarcissists are the type\nof people who put up an act\nin order to get what they want.\nDo you regularly overthink your actions\nor the words you just said to someone?\nThat just goes to show that\nyou actually care about them\nand you're afraid to hurt them.\nWhat may help constant overthinking\nis being in touch with supportive friends\nwho encourage you by\nreminding you of your worth.\nAnd number five,\nyou don't feel like\nyou're better than others.\nDo you have someone you're envious of?\nMaybe it's their success or popularity.\nThese kinds of thoughts are normal\nand almost everyone experiences them.\nIt might help as a source of motivation,\nbut not as a way of beating yourself down.\nNarcissists expect to be\nrecognized as superior\neven without accompanying achievement.\nSo if you don't feel like\nyou're on top of everyone\nwithout having a valid reason to\nthen you're probably good to go.\nIt always helps to stay grounded\nand appreciate your own\ncapabilities and worth.\nBut self-love is really important.\nIf you nurture yourself first,\nothers will see the difference.\nThis can help attract people to you.\nOver time, you'll start to\nlearn your own boundaries\nand stay true to yourself\ninstead of fitting to\nother people's standards.\nSo do you think you're a\nnarcissist or just lonely?\nWhat makes you say so?\nComment your experiences down below.\nWe enjoy hearing them.\nQuick note.\nNarcissistic Personality\nDisorder is a spectrum disorder.\nOnly a licensed medical professional\nis qualified to diagnose your disorder.\nPlease like and share this with friends\nthat might find some insight\nin the video as well.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the references used\nare added in the description box below.\nThanks for watching.\nWe'll see you next time."
