a toll\non your mental health.\nJust like how your mood and feelings\nfluctuate throughout the day,\nyour mental wellness will change\nduring situations of stress and hardship.\nSo to help you cope\nand improve on your health,\nhere are six small habits\nto improve your mental health.\nNumber one, make light\nof tough situations.\nDo you see the glass as\nhalf empty or half full?\nAlong with many other benefits,\npositivity has proven\nto affect your outlook on life\nfor the better.\nWhen practiced over time,\nit can help you shift your mood\nand thought process\nduring tough times\nto one that's more hopeful,\noptimistic, and accepting\nby giving your thoughts\na chance to go down\na different, more positive route.\nA flexible mindset like this\ncan prevent negative\nfeelings from snowballing.\nIt can also give you a chance\nto reflect on what's happened\nand allow you to think about\nwhat you might be able to learn\nfrom this situation\ninstead of dreading over\nwhy it's happened to you.\nSeeing the challenges\nand bumps in the road\nis something more than what they are\nat face value is a great attitude\nto have in life.\nAnd also something that can help\nkeep your mental wellness in check.\nNumber two, practice gratitude.\nThere are many things\nwe take for granted in our lives\nlike food, shelter,\nand even waking up each morning.\nAnd while it might sound obvious\nthat these are all very important,\nit can definitely be easy to forget\nto appreciate the things we have.\nSometimes you may only express gratitude\nwhen you finally get your dream job\nor that perfect test score.\nYet, you'll be ungrateful and gloomy\nwhen times are tough\nor when thinking about\nthe things you don't have.\nBut the reality is\nthat there's always something\nto be grateful for.\nStudies even show that people\nwho practice gratitude are happier\nand less prone to depression.\nMaking a habit out of\ncounting your blessings\ncan have great effects on\nyour attitude, self-esteem,\noutlook on life and mental wellness.\nNumber three, connect with nature.\nHow is your relationship with nature?\nHow much do you notice and appreciate\nyour natural surroundings?\nDid you know that being in nature\ngenerates a multitude of positive emotions\nsuch as calmness, joy, creativity,\nand facilitates concentration.\nAccording to research,\npeople who are more connected with nature\nare usually happier in life\nand more likely to report\nfeeling their lives are worthwhile.\nNot only that,\nwhen you have a strong\nnature connectedness,\nyou're also more likely\nto have pro-environmental behaviors\nsuch as recycling items\nor buying seasonal food.\nA healthy environment\nleads to a healthy lifestyle\nand mental wellness.\nDo you want to be part of\nthe biggest challenge of our generation?\nAre you interested\nin taking action on climate change?\nWe'd like to thank our sponsor\nfor today's video.\nKlima, an app dedicated\nto helping people offset\nor completely eliminate\ntheir carbon footprint.\nOne of the best things about Klima\nis that it's very simple to use.\nFirst, you answer a few questions\ngenerated by the carbon calculator\nto get an accurate estimate\nof your environmental impact,\nwhich will then be used\nwith the next feature.\nThe impact tracker.\nAs you fund projects that capture\nor reduce emissions elsewhere,\nyour own impact meter will decrease.\nThey also include a neat tree meter,\nwhich tracks the number of trees\nplanted across the world\nin your name.\nAnd right now,\nKlima has a great offer going on.\nThe first 100 people\nto subscribe to Klima\nwill get 10 extra trees\nplanted in their name.\nJust click the link and enter my code.\nLet's get started.\nLet's make our planet a greener place.\nNumber four, meditate.\nWhat do you think of\nwhen you see the word meditation?\nPerhaps it's being able to sit still\nfor long periods of time\nor maybe you associate it\nwith images of peaceful\nBuddhist monks sitting cross-legged.\nBut meditation is much more than that.\nIt's something that anyone\nof any background can do.\nWhile there are different reasons\na person might choose to meditate,\nmeditation's main purpose\nis for you to become mindful\nor aware of your thoughts and emotions.\nMindfulness achieved through meditation\ncan help you ground yourself,\nremind you to be present at the moment\nand reduce your negative feelings\nlike anxiety and stress.\nIt can also help you identify\nany destructive habits\nand thoughts you have.\nProper meditation is something\nthat's learned with time and practice,\nbut you can start small\nby spending just a few minutes\nsitting still each day\nas you focus on your breath\nand observe your thoughts.\nNumber five, put your thoughts\nand feelings onto paper.\nHave you ever tried journaling?\nJotting your thoughts and feelings\ndown onto paper can help you\nclear your mind\nand understand your emotions better.\nLike meditation, writing\nencourages mindfulness.\nDuring stressful times,\nwriting down any negative thoughts\nor emotions you have\ncan not only help you\nfind a root cause\nfor why you feel a certain way,\nbut also help you find a solution.\nBeing able to physically\nsee your thoughts and feelings on paper\nmay be enough to make you realize\nthat things aren't as bad as they seem.\nSince our emotions\ncan easily make situations\nmore intense than they really are.\nWhether in a fancy bullet journal\nor a piece of scrap paper,\nmaking a habit out of writing down\nyour thoughts and feelings\ncan help you understand\nyour emotions better, manage stress\nand ultimately, be something\nthat boosts your mental wellness.\nAnd number six,\ntake care of your body.\nWhile physical health and mental health\nare two different states,\nthere are also ones that go hand in hand.\nThis means if your physical\nhealth is neglected,\nthere's a good chance\nyour mental health might not\nbe in the best shape either.\nLuckily, good physical health\ncan help keep your mental\nhealth in check too.\nDoing things like getting\nenough sleep each night,\nexercising regularly\nand incorporating healthy food\ninto your diet\ncan not only help you\nsteer away from illness,\nbut can also improve\nyour mood, confidence, energy, and more.\nWhen your physical\nhealth is taken care of,\nyour mental health\nwill naturally follow suit.\nSo making sure to tend\nto your body's needs\nis a great habit\nthat can keep your mental wellness\nin check as well.\nSo do you practice any of these habits?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe\nand share this video with those\nwho might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to
