    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hi Psych2Goers.\nHave you become really\ninterested in self-help\nand self-improvement lately?\nThis pursuit of more and better things,\nwhether they be better\nhealth, clothes, or money\nhas been normalized,\nbut sometimes to the detriment\nof people's wellbeing.\nIt can almost feel\nembarrassing to not be hustling\nor be improving yourself in any way.\nIn the end, this mindset\nand self-improvement culture\ncan make you feel disempowered,\nlike you should be someone else.\nSo here are five time-wasting\nself-improvement habits\nthat are harmful to you.\nNumber one.\nExtremely high and\nunrealistic expectations.\nWhat are some goals that\nyou have set for yourself?\nHaving goals can be very helpful\nsince it can help give you\nsomething to work towards\nand place your energy into.\nHowever, when you're\ntrying to elevate yourself,\nyou may end up comparing\nyourself to people you idolize\nand whose lives may seem\nso much more beautiful\nand better than yours.\nYou might create wild expectations\nof how you wanna get to where others are\nin the same amount of time\nor in the same way as them\nand subconsciously adopt\ntheir ideals and expectations.\nThis is a harmful habit\nbecause you're not focused on yourself\nand your enjoyment of life,\nbut on achieving other people's ideals.\nRemember, you don't have to be perfect,\nyou just need to be yourself.\nNumber two.\nThe hustle culture mentality.\nDo you tend to overwork yourself?\nThe idea about how you must never give up\nor that you must constantly hustle,\neven at the expense of your health\ncan be very damaging to your wellbeing.\nSometimes, things just don't work out\nand you need to give up,\nbut that's not a bad thing.\nIt can be heartbreaking and\ntough, but it may be necessary,\nespecially if it's draining\nand taking a toll on your body and mind.\nAs much as there are people\nwho have to support themselves and others\nby working long hours,\nconstantly hustling without\ntaking any breaks for yourself\nto get your bearings\nmay only lead to devastating burnout.\nNumber three.\nPutting aesthetics over health.\nHow often do you use social media?\nWhile it can be a tool\nto help you change your\nlife for the better,\nit can also distort how you\nsee yourself and others.\nInstead of promoting healthy\nlifestyles and practices,\nthe media, and especially social media\nadvertises certain body types\nas desirable and important.\nWomen are implored to get dangerous,\nunnecessary cosmetic surgery\nand men are told to be jacked\nand in the gym by any\nmeans for those gains,\nbut our bodies are not trends\nthat we should be ashamed of\nand indoctrinated into plucking,\nplumping, and injecting\nfor social media likes\nand strangers validation.\nYour desire for your self-improvement\nmay end up overshadowed by\ninsecurities about your body,\nand that's a hard mindset to come out of.\nNumber four.\nInformation without application.\nHow many self-help books and guides\ndo you have stacked up in your room?\nLike many others, you may tell yourself\nthat you'll start applying the information\nonce you finish reading all of it,\nbut there are so many books\nand new ones that will keep coming out.\nAll of these how-tos can be helpful,\nbut they won't be of any use\nif you don't actually apply\nthe things they teach.\nAs powerful as knowledge is,\napplied knowledge is the best kind.\nDon't be afraid to implement\nwhat you've learned\ninto the world.\nAnd number five,\nvisualizations without action.\nDo you dream about the person you wanna be\nor the things you wanna have in your life?\nPerhaps you see yourself\nas a painter or a pilot,\nor you wish you'd have a\nbig house or a nice car.\nVisualizing the life you\nwant and putting it out there\ncan be a great way to get\nyourself hyped and motivated,\nespecially when you need to tap in\nto your willpower reserves.\nHowever, this can become an issue\nwhen you only put it out there\nand fantasize about it\nwith nothing in between\nto bridge the gap.\nAs much as you can dream of the best life\nyou could ever dream of that you deserve,\nif it lacks the structure\nand execution in reality,\nit's only a mirage.\nRemember that you have to\nactually do it to get there.\nDo you do any of these habits?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video with those\nwho might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references in studies\nused in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThank you for watching and\nwe'll see you in the next video."
