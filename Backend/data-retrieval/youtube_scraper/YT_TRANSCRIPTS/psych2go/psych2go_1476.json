    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Hey Psych2goers.\nDo you have any relationships in your life\nthat repeatedly leave you\nfeeling emotionally drained and miserable?\nThese can be in the form of\na romantic partner, friend,\ncoworker, or a family member.\nHave you tried to share your feelings\nand being made to feel\ndejected or ashamed?\nIf so, you may be dealing\nwith a toxic person.\nIn today's video,\nwe'll be looking at seven intelligent ways\nto deal with toxic people.\nNumber one,\nyou established your physical\nand emotional boundaries.\nDo you ever feel trapped in a conversation\nor left ruminating about a conversation\nyou wish you hadn't been a part of?\nPsychotherapist Amy Morin advises\nthat when dealing with toxic people,\nyou need to set your physical\nand emotional boundaries.\nFor instance, this could be in the form\nof stepping back from a group of gossipers\nthat make you feel uncomfortable.\nUnderstandably though,\nit's not always easy\nto physically retreat,\nsuch as in work settings\nwith colleagues and bosses.\nIn instances like this,\nyou can limit the emotional energy\nand time you spend thinking about them,\nand try not to give much\nthought to them afterwards.\nNumber two, you avoid\nplaying into their reality.\nHave you ever been in a situation\nwhere a friend or coworker makes a mistake\nbut blames it on you or someone else\nrather than taking\nresponsibility for their actions?\nWhilst standing up and\ndisagreeing can feel daunting,\nthis can be done in a respectful way.\nIn fact, it's actually\nhealthy to agree to disagree.\nAccording to Brito and Raypole, 2019,\na way to confront people\nwithout being\nconfrontational or accusatory\nis taking them to decide and saying,\n\"I had a different take on the situation.\"\nWhilst they may be upset\nwith your disagreement,\nthey will recognize that\nyou have a voice of your own\nand you're not afraid to use it.\nNumber three, you don't share\nsecrets with the gossipers.\nHave you ever come\nacross a group of people\nwho constantly talk about others\nfor enjoyment and entertainment sake?\nAccording to psychiatrist, Ned Howell,\ngossip can be defined\nas sharing information,\nreal or imagined, without permission.\nGossipers tend to delight\nin other people's pain,\nand gossip about anyone\nand everyone they can.\nChances are, if someone shares\nother people's secrets with you,\nthey're untrustworthy and\nwe'll share your secrets to\nif given the chance.\nBecause of this, the best\nthing to do in most instances\nis to not share secrets with gossipers.\nNumber four, you focus\non solutions not problem.\nWith many toxic people,\ntheir focus tends to be on\nproblems rather than solutions,\nand they always have\nsomething to complain about,\nwhich can be very emotionally draining\nfor people around them.\nOn the other hand, a way of\ndealing with this behavior\nis by focusing your energy on\nsolutions instead of problems.\nIf you have someone in your life\nwho creates problem after problem\nand continuously expects\nyou to help them fix things,\nit might be worth reconsidering\nyour relationship with them,\nand preventing yourself from\nbeing sucked into their drama.\nNumber five, you spend\ntime with loyal friends.\nDo you have any friends in your life\nthat you know you can always count on?\nA really good friend\nshould have your back,\nhelp you feel good about yourself\nand celebrate your success with you.\nIt can be hard to come across such people,\nso when you do hold them close\nand show up for them the\nway they show up for you.\nRather than focusing your time\nand energy on toxic people,\nsurround yourself as much as possible\nwith loyal and loving friends.\nNumber six, you recognize the insults,\nignore them or toss up a joke.\nUnderstandably insults hurt\nand they're unpleasant,\nand can feel like a personal dig.\nIt's important to remember though,\nthat toxic people are\noften hurtful to everyone\nand it's much more reflective\nof them than it is on you.\nIt can be really difficult,\nbut not taking harsh words to heart\ncan be one of the best ways\nof dealing with toxic people.\nBecause most of the time\nthey're just wanting\nto stir the pot and cause drama.\nIn some instances,\ntossing up a joke can\nhelp lighten the situation\nand diffuse the tension.\nSo next time someone tries\nto get an angry reaction from you,\nhow about ignoring them\nor throwing a joke back.\nAnd number seven, you change your routine.\nDo you find yourself stuck in a rut\nof not being able to succeed\nbecause of certain people?\nFor example, maybe you have family members\nwho create a hostile environment\nwhen you're trying to study for an exam.\nIf this is something you relate to,\nchanging your routine may be\na way of dealing with this.\nIdeally, your family in this example\nwould be respectful of your boundaries,\nbut in the instances where they're not,\nwaking up earlier or going to the library\nmight help you help yourself.\nSo there we have it,\nseven intelligent ways to\ndeal with toxic people.\nDid you find any of these tips helpful?\nIf so, please let us know in\nthe comment section below.\nAs always, thank you so much for watching.\nIf you enjoyed the video, please like,\nsubscribe to Psych2Go\nif you haven't already,\nand feel free to share\nwith
