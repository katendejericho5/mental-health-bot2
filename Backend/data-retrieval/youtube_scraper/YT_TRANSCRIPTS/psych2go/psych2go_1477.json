    "transcript": "- Hi Psych2Goers.\nWhat would your reaction\nbe to seeing your friend\nposting a bunch of pictures\nof themselves every single day\nwith the hashtag depression?\nWhile many people may\nthink that it's a way\nfor them to get attention,\nthese behaviors may\nreally be a cry for help.\nThe person doing it may\nactually be struggling\nwith their mental health.\nSo in this video, we'll be\nlooking at some behaviors\nthat may be a sign of depression,\ninstead of attention seeking.\nNumber one, you gravitate\ntowards absolutest words.\nI'm always a failure, nothing\nhas ever gone right for me,\nI feel completely at a loss with my life.\nSometimes when you hear these words,\nyou may think that the person\nis exaggerating for attention,\nbut there may actually be\nan underlying cause for it.\nResearch published in clinical\npsychological science,\nshows that people with\nanxiety and depression\ngravitate towards using absolutest words.\nWhich represent absolute\nmagnitudes or probabilities\nsuch as, always, nothing or completely.\nThis is perhaps due to the\nfact that depressed people\noften view the world through\na black or white lens,\nwhich is manifested in\ntheir style of language.\nNumber two, you lash out on social media.\nDo you use social media to vent\nor use it as a form of online journaling\nand a source of catharsis?\nSometimes, people who are depressed,\nlike to utilize their\nsocial media accounts\nto talk about their\nproblems and frustrations.\nAs said by Duckie May who\nlives with bipolar disorder\nand borderline personality disorder,\n\"I seek the attention of those around me\nbecause their words\nhelp battle my thoughts.\nThey argue with my logic or lack thereof.\nTheir encouragement tells\nmy brain to shut up.\nTheir love squashes my self hate.\nTheir attention starves\nmy negative thoughts\nof belief and support.\nTheir words save me.\"\nSo, while it may look\nlike attention seeking,\nit may really be a cry for help\nbecause of the inner turmoil\nthey're experiencing.\nNumber three, you get involved\nin self harm behavior.\nAccording to a booklet published\nby the Mental Health Foundation UK,\n10% of young people get involved\nin self-harming behavior.\nIn other words, it's likely\nthat at least two young people\nin every secondary school\nclassroom have self-harmed\nat some time.\nHowever, we need to actually\nreframe our perspective\non those people who self harm.\nIt's important to note that self harm\nis neither a suicide attempt\nnor a cry for attention.\nIt can actually be a method\nthat some people resort to\nin order to cope with\noverwhelming and distressing\nthoughts or feelings.\nWe should never make light\nof any self harm behavior.\nNo matter the underlying reason behind it.\nIf you're suffering from\nthis or know someone who is,\nwe've included a list of hotlines\nin the description below.\nNumber four, you talk\nabout depression very often\nand very openly.\nHow often do you post or write\nthings about your depression?\nSometimes, you may see people\nposting videos of themselves\nor writing posts about their struggles\nwith their mental health.\nWhile some may say it's an attempt\nto gain more views or followers,\nthese open and honest\nconversations about depression\nmay just be that, an\nopen, honest conversation\nabout the struggles of depression.\nInstead of thinking that it's\nall about attention seeking,\nit may be helpful to\nremember and understand\nhow crucial and helpful\nit is to bring awareness\nto these topics, to reduce\nthe stigma of seeking help.\nIt's important to raise people's awareness\nregarding this issue so that they can seek\nthe appropriate help that they should get.\nDid you find this video helpful?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nAlso be sure to like,\nsubscribe and share this video\nwith those who may benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThanks so much for watching\nand we'll see you in the next one."
