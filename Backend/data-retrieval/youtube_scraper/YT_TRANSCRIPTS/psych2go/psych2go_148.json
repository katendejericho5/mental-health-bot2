    "transcript": "childhood trauma can be invisible to\nothers it can even be unrecognizable to\nvictims themselves did you know that\nparentification is a form of invisible\nchildhood trauma this is the kind of\ntrauma that forces a child to take on\nthe role of a caregiver they have to\nemotionally act as the adult while the\nparent depends on the child for\nemotional support while seldom giving\nany back someone who's been parentified\nmay also act as a caregiver to their\nsiblings as well some may choose to look\nat some positive effects that can occur\nsuch as being highly responsible but\nthere are some troubling negative\nresults as well so how do you know if\nyou or someone is being parentified well\nhere are seven signs you or someone you\nknow was parentified during childhood\nnumber one you like feeling in control\ndo you feel a strong need for control\ndoes this intense urge to be in control\ntake control of your life sometimes\naccording to licensed psychotherapist\nWhitney Goodman a sign that you were\nparentified as a child as if you like to\nfeel in control someone who's been\nparentified as a child may have gotten\nused to taking control of certain\ndecisions or situations this may result\nin a feeling of wanting to be in control\noften as an adult number two you never\nfelt like you could express your\nnegative feelings did you ever have a\nhard time expressing any negative\nfeelings you had as a child you were so\nbusy listening and reassuring your\nparents when they were experiencing\ntheir negatives that perhaps you didn't\nwant to make things worse by venting\nabout your own this may happen when a\nchild is the emotional caretaker they\nsimply feel their emotional venting\nwould make things worse so they listen\nto their parents vent about how they're\nfeeling instead number three you grew up\nwith a heavy weight on your shoulders\nthink back to your childhood who carried\nthe responsibility did that weight rest\non your shoulders if you grew up feeling\nas if you had to be responsible this can\nalso be a sign of\nparentification while this can have a\nnegative impact there is is hope for\nsome good to come from this as well\npsychotherapist Whitney Goodman explains\nin an article for psychology today that\nthere are also qualities that arise\nthrough parentification that may benefit\nyou in certain areas of your life like\nbeing responsible or a great caregiver\nbut she does note that we have to find\nthe right balance between responsibility\nand structure play and fun number four\ndon't have any memories of being a kid\nlet's go back to childhood memories what\nare your fondest ones what about some\nfun relaxed childhood memories do you\nhave many of them do you remember\nfeeling like a kid most days and being\nable to do things other kids were doing\nif you don't remember many memories of\nbeing a kid it could be because you were\ntoo busy with other responsibilities to\nhave any childhood fun number five you\nstruggle with relaxing and playing\nyou're older now and while you aren't\nnecessarily playing with toys anymore\nyou do have a hard time playing and\nrelaxing in a moment of fun an impromtu\ntrip or game makes you nervous and you\nfind it hard to let loose and enjoy\nspontaneous silly moments this along\nwith other points could be a sign of\nparentification number six you feel you\nneed to take on the role of Peacemaker\nduring an argument Are You The\nPeacemaker when you see others argue do\nyou feel you need to maintain the peace\nthose who have been parentified as a\nchild had to take on a caregiver role\nwhich means they may have had to resolve\ncertain situations or problems quickly\nto keep the peace in the household now\nas an adult this responsibility to\nmaintain peace likely has transferred\nover and number seven a great deal of\nempathy taking on the emotional role of\na parent or caregiver at an early age\ncan provide someone with a great deal of\nempathy for others they try to look at\neveryone's perspective and take both\nsituations into account\nsince they're also often taking the role\nof Peacemaker being empathetic is a\nnecessary skill and trait if you feel\nyou can connect to others easily and are\nhighly empathetic due to your caregiving\nchildhood this could be an additional\nsign of\nparentification one or two of these\nsigns alone may not mean that you've\nbeen parentified but if you relate to\nseveral of these points it may be a fair\nidea to ask yourself what role you were\ntaking on during your childhood were you\nthe child or the responsible adult if\nyou feel you've been parentified finding\na healthy balance between structure and\na bit of play in your adult life might\nbe a good goal if you're struggling with\nthe trauma it could be a good idea to\ntalk to a mental health professional\nsuch as a counselor or a therapist for\nhelp recognizing and acknowledging these\nfeelings is already a great first step\ntowards healing so do you relate to any\nof these signs did you know what\nparentification was before this video\nlet us know in the comments below we\nhope you enjoyed
