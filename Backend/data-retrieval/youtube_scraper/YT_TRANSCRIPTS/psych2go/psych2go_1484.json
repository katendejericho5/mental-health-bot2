    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Hi, Psych2goers.\nAnd welcome back to another video.\nThank you so much.\nYour love and support has enabled us\nto send your way another\nwealth of everyday psychology.\nSo let's explore.\nSometimes feelings can be obvious.\nOther times they may not be.\nThis can make you question\nwhether somebody has\nromantic feelings for you.\nThe old age question here is,\nis this person flirting with me\nbecause they have feelings for me,\nor are they simply being friendly?\nKnowing the subtle\ndifferences can save you\nthe dreaded embarrassment.\nSo how do you know when people\nare hiding their feelings?\nBefore we begin,\nplease note that this video is purely\nfor educational purposes only,\nand is not designed to\nsuggest that if people\ndo show these signs that they definitely\nhave feelings for you.\nIt's best to talk to\nthe person in question,\nand discuss this to make sure\nthat you're on the same page.\nAfter all, communication is key.\nWith that in mind,\nhere are nine signs that somebody\nmay be hiding their feelings for you.\nNumber one, they will pay\nyou a lot of attention.\nAre they regularly inviting you out,\nconstantly calling and texting you,\nand asking your friends about you?\nIf the answer is yes,\nthen it appears that there\nis already a foundational relationship\nthat has been established.\nThe best indicator of a crush, love\nor attraction is attention.\nWhat a person does and how they act around\nyou explains everything you need to know.\nThe key is to observe with your eyes,\nand not just with your heart.\nNumber two, their body language\nwill be different around you.\nDo you often notice them\nfacing and leaning towards you\nwhen they talk to you?\nAre their gestures, open,\nrelaxed, and welcoming?\nYou've probably heard before\nthat the body doesn't lie.\nSo if you want to know how you\ncan tell if someone likes you\nor not pay close attention\nto what this person's body\nlanguage is telling you.\nA relaxed and open body posture\naround you generally shows\nthat the person is okay with\nbeing vulnerable around you,\nand trusts you enough to let\nyou into their comfort zone.\nIt can be a sign of trust, respect,\nand oftentimes even care.\nJust make sure that you don't\nconfuse romantic interest\nwith shyness because shyness\ndoesn't necessarily indicate\nromantic attraction.\nNumber three, pay attention\nto their eye contact,\nand non-verbal communication.\nDo you notice them\nlooking at you more often?\nAre they extra cheerful or\nsmile frequently and talk more\nthan usual and with you.\nThe next time you're with\nthe person in question,\nnote how often they look at you,\nHarvard Psychologist, Zick Rubin,\nfound a correlation between\neye contact and love.\nIn his study couples deeply in\nlove look at one another 75%\nof the time while talking,\nwhile other people\nengaged in conversation,\nonly look at each other\nabout 30 to 60% of the time.\nIf they want to leave a\ngood, long lasting impression\nby sounding enthusiastic,\ninquisitive, and jolly,\nit's a dead giveaway that this\nperson likes your company,\nand cares about your impression of them.\nSo it's imperative to try and figure out\nif they are putting in a lot of effort.\nThis could be a sign that\nthis person is into you.\nNumber four, they'll do\nthings to show that they care.\nDo they text you or call you\nafter you spend time together\nto make sure you got home safe?\nDo they regularly ask\nyour friends about you?\nDo they offer to help you\nwithout you asking them first?\nTheir interest in your\nwellbeing may be another sign\nthat they care about you and\nhow you're doing or feeling.\nHowever, these subtle things\ncould easily be confused\nwith a caring friend as well.\nBut if you find that\nthey'll go out of their way\nto check in with you,\nthen it is possible that\nthey have a crush on you\nor have feelings for you.\nNumber five, they may be\noverly curious about you.\nDo you find them asking you questions\nabout you and your life?\nDo you find that they want\nto know more about you,\nand what makes you who you are?\nPeople who are trying\nto get to know others\nmay be hiding their feelings\nbehind their burning curiosity.\nIt might be so that they can\ncommunicate in your language,\nand talk about the things\nyou enjoy talking about.\nAsking you a lot of\nquestions essentially intends\nto encourage you to talk about yourself,\nand open up about your life.\nAnd this is a basic human\ntechnique that most of us use\non a daily basis, perhaps\nwithout even knowing it.\nThey would ask questions subliminally,\nand often without awareness\nwith the intention\nof developing more of a\nrelationship with you.\nNumber six, they may offer\nyou compliments and affection.\nDo they compliment on your\nlooks, clothing, style, taste,\nand music and so on?\nDo compliments mean anything at all?\nAttitude plays a huge role\nin whether a person likes you or not\nwhen it comes to relationships.\nSo pay close attention to how\na person communicates to you.\nIt's important to say that we\nshould not assume that just\nbecause somebody compliments you\nthat means that they like\nyou in a romantic way.\nHowever, it also doesn't mean\nthat if somebody doesn't compliment you\nthat they aren't into you\nor that they don't like you.\nSome people just don't\nknow how to compliment\nor might not feel comfortable doing so.\nHowever, if you notice\nthat they may be\ncomplimenting you excessively,\nthat may be a sign that a\nperson is interested in you\nbecause they want you to feel good.\nThis person wants you to like them,\nand give them the\nvalidation that they crave.\nThe person in question\nmay be investing in you,\nand wants you to feel secure\nand comfortable around them.\nNumber seven, they may\nact unusual around you.\nHave they ever stumbled over\ntheir words or become tense\nor nervous when you show up?\nDo they tell awkward jokes\nor even pull away\nsuddenly and unexpectedly?\nThese are actually counter-intuitive signs\nthat someone likes you.\nDating expert Matthew Hussey states\nthat people will act\ndifferently around you\nthan they do with other people.\nYou may even notice that\ntheir energy levels will go up\nwhen they're around you.\nNumber eight, they may\nshow off in front of you.\nDo they try and stand out in\na crowd when you're together?\nAnother way to tell if\nsomeone secretly likes you\nis to look at their behavior.\nThis could be down to\ntwo things, high ego,\nor their feelings for you.\nTo find out which it is be aware\nof the way this person\ncommunicates to you.\nDo you get the feeling\nthat they're eyeing you\nfor a positive reaction and\nis trying to impress you?\nAre you the only person they do this to?\nIf yes, then the person may be interested\nin wanting to get to\nknow you romantically,\nand share their feelings with you.\nAnd number nine,\nthey'll find excuses to\nspend time alone with you.\nDo they ask to make plans with you\nwhere it's just you and them,\nor do you often find them\nagreeing to everyday adventures\nwith just the two of you?\nWhen a person has feelings for someone\nthey would wanna spend most\nof their time with them\nas this could present itself\nwith romantic opportunities.\nThey may suggest hanging out after school\nor ask for some help with work.\nSo when you suspect\nthat someone likes you,\nand you like them back set up a date.\nInvite them out and see what happens next.\nYou'll quickly understand\nhow emotionally invested\nthis person is in you and decide whether\nyou want to pursue a\nrelationship with them.\nWe hope we were able to\ngive you insight into some\nof the ways you can tell\nif someone likes you.\nDo any of these describe your experience?\nWhat are some of the signs you've noticed?\nLeave a comment down below\nabout your experiences.\nAnd please feel free to share\nany thoughts you have as well.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like\nbutton and share it\nwith those still figuring out\nwhether someone likes them or not.\nDon't forget
