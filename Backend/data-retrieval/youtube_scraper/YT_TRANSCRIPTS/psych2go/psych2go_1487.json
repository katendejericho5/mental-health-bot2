    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey,\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nDo you have anxiety\nor do you know what it\nmight feel like to have it?\nIf you answered no,\nthen it's still important\nfor us to educate ourselves\nand raise awareness about anxiety\nand other mental illnesses,\nso it's a good thing you're here.\nAnd if you have someone in your life\nwho you think might be struggling\nwith feelings of anxiety,\nthen it would do you a lot of good\nto learn more about what it's\nlike to live with anxiety\nso you can help eliminate\nthe stigma against it\nand be there for them\nin a way that they need.\nSo with that said, here are eight things\nPeople with anxiety want you to know.\nNumber one, anxiety is real,\neven if you can't see it.\nOne of the worst things you\ncan do to someone with anxiety\nor any kind of mental\nhealth concern, really,\nis to invalidate their feelings\nby saying their anxiety is a choice\nor that it's all in their head.\nJust because you can't see it\ndoesn't make their struggle\nwith mental illness\nany less real.\nNumber two, anxiety\naffects a lot of people\nall over the world.\nAccording to\nthe Anxiety and Depression\nAssociation of America,\nroughly 31% of those aged\n18 years old and above\nhave or will experience\nan anxiety disorder\nat some point in their lives.\nThat means over 40 million\nadults in the United States alone\nsuffer from anxiety every year.\nThat makes anxiety one of\nthe most commonly diagnosed\nmental illnesses in the world,\naffecting people of all ages,\nraces, genders, and backgrounds.\nNumber three, people with\nanxiety wish they could stop,\nbut it's complicated.\nNext time you ask your friend\nto just snap out of it,\nrelax, or get a grip on their anxiety,\nthink back to a time when you\ngot sick or seriously injured.\nCould you just tell your\nbody to get over the cold\nor stop being allergic to something?\nTo heal your bones or cure your infection\nwith sheer power of will?\nNo, right?\nIf you could, then life\nwould be much easier for you.\nWell, mental illness\nis the exact same way.\nLiving with anxiety is far\nfrom a walk in the park,\nand it's not something\nthat someone can just get over in a snap.\nNumber four, anxiety\naffects the mind and body.\nSometimes our anxious thoughts\nlead to experiencing physical symptoms\nlike sweaty palms,\ntrembling, muscle tension,\nshortness of breath, and a pounding heart.\nAnxiety is never just in your head.\nAnd trying to rationalize it,\nas kind as your intentions might be\nwhen you tell someone there's\nno need to be nervous,\ntends to make them feel worse, not better.\nNumber five, anxiety has\nnothing to do with you\nor the relationship.\nOne of the reasons why it's so difficult\nfor people with mental illnesses\nto have healthy, thriving,\nlong-term relationships,\nbe it platonic or romantic,\nis because most people tend to have\nthis very problematic idea that\nif you love someone enough,\nyou can make their mental illness go away,\nthat they can be well for\nyou or change for the better\nbecause of how much they love you\nand how much you love them.\nBut it just doesn't work that way\nbecause their anxiety has\nnothing to do with you\nor their relationship with you.\nAnd just because they feel\nanxious around you sometimes\ndoesn't mean they love you any less.\nNumber six, seemingly random\nthings can be triggering.\nAnxiety can be scary,\nespecially when we don't\nunderstand the exact nature\nof why and when it happens.\nA lot of people suffering from anxiety\nare often triggered by\nmany different things.\nOftentimes, it can be uncomfortable\nor unfamiliar situations,\nsuch as public speaking or\nhaving fights with friends,\nbut it can also be brought out\nby seemingly random, unrelated things.\nNumber seven, it's not your\njob to fix those with anxiety.\nWhen a friend or family member\nconfides in you about their\nstruggles with anxiety,\nthey're doing it because they trust you\nand feel safe being vulnerable around you.\nThey're not asking you to fix them\nor make their problems go away.\nSo just be there for them\nlike a good friend would,\nand any support or\nunderstanding you can show\nwill surely go a long way\nin helping them manage their anxieties.\nAnd finally, number eight,\nwe are more than our anxiety.\nFinally, but maybe most importantly,\npeople with anxiety want you to know\nthat they are more than their\nstruggles with mental illness.\nThey don't let their anxiety\ndefine them or their life,\nso you shouldn't either.\nAnd just because someone\nstruggles with anxiety\ndoesn't mean they can't\nenjoy themselves anymore,\nreach their full potential,\nor have meaningful\nrelationships with others.\nAnxiety disorders are also one of the most\nhighly treatable mental\nillnesses in the world,\nso there's always hope that\nthings will get better.\nSo if you have anxiety, did\nyou agree with these points?\nDid you learn something new?\nRemember, if you or anyone you know\nis struggling with anxiety\nor any other serious\nmental health concern,\nplease do not hesitate to reach out\nto
