    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you know someone\nsuffering from depression?\nDo you even wonder what's\ngoing on in their minds?\nDepression is a serious mental illness\nthat affects millions of people.\nAnd even though it's been wildly\ndiscussed in recent years,\nthere are still so many misconceptions\nabout what it actually is.\nWith all the stigma\nsurrounding mental illness\nand depression, it can\nbe tough to live with it\nand to communicate to\nothers what it's like.\nSo our goal is to give you some insight\ninto what people with\ndepression often feel\nthat most people don't\nknow or misunderstand.\nSo here are six things\npeople with depression want you to know.\nNumber one, a depressed person\ndoes not necessarily look\nor behave sad.\nBeing depressed is not the\nsame thing as being sad.\nDepression is a complex\nillness affecting the brain,\nand it does not equate to sadness at all;\nit's much more than just\ncrying and looking sad.\nJust like how there are\ndifferent types of cancer,\nthere are different types of depression,\nsuch as major depressive disorder,\ndysthymic disorder, bipolar\ndisorder, and so on.\nSo despite what you\nmight see on the surface,\nthe always happy neighbor\nor friend you have\nmay actually be struggling with\ntheir mental health inside.\nNumber two, depression does\nnot define the personality\nof a person suffering from it.\nPeople who suffer from depression\nare more than just their illness.\nWhile it may play a huge\npart in their lives,\nit's important to remember\nthat there's much more to them\nthan their struggle with\ntheir mental health.\nNumber three, depression\nis never a choice.\nPeople who suffer from\ndepression do not choose to feel\nor act that way.\nLiving with depression can\nbe hard enough as it is,\nbut it can be so much harder\nwhen the people around you\nthink you're faking it.\nThere's sometimes just no apparent reason\nas to why someone develops depression,\nbut it rewires the brain\nand makes it harder for them\nto make choices on their own.\nThis could mean that they can't help\nwith how they're feeling,\nso it can become a real struggle\nwhen they have to find ways\nto live the best life they can\ndespite what their mood might tell them.\nNumber four, people with\ndepression do not want to die,\nthey just don't wanna live like they do.\nMany people think that\nthose with depression\nhave lost the will to live,\nbut that's not the case.\nLiving with depression can\nmake life harder to bear,\nand the intense and overwhelming\nfeelings they experience\ncan be debilitating.\nIt's not easy to explain what\nhaving depression feels like,\nbut many people who suffer\nfrom depression describe\ntheir feelings with words\nlike dark, heavy, tight,\nwanting to escape from their pain.\nYou may even hear them say\nthat they don't wanna kill themselves\nbut instead die in their sleep\nout of mental exhaustion.\nWhen people suffering\nfrom depression feel unwell and miserable,\nthey might not be fully aware\nof what they're actually wishing for.\nIf you or someone else\nare feeling depressed\nor contemplating suicide,\nplease remember that you're not alone.\nWe've added a list of suicide hotlines\nin the description below.\nNumber five, people with\ndepression want to feel loved\njust like everybody else.\nHaving depression can already\nmake you feel isolated\nand alone, but it can be worsened\nif the people around you dislike\nor abandon you because of it.\nOn the other hand,\nhaving depression can also\ncause some to push people away.\nThis does not mean that people\nwith depression have no\ndesire to love or to feel love\nbut may mean that they want to feel better\nbefore they're able to\ntake on anything else.\nNonetheless, it's always\ngood if somebody is there\nand available for them\nwith love and support\nwhile patiently waiting\nfor them to recover.\nAnd number six, having a depressed friend\ndoesn't mean you need to fix them,\nnor does it mean that\nthey are toxic to you.\nThis is one of the most\nimportant things to keep in mind\nwhen someone you know\nsuffers from depression.\nOftentimes, when you have a friend\nor relative struggling with depression,\nyou may feel compelled\nto fix their problems;\nhowever, while your intention is good,\nthe best way to support\nyour friend would be\nto just listen without being\npreachy and judgmental.\nIt's always better to\nmake them feel at ease\nwhen they confide in you,\nand to try to understand\ntheir depressive mood.\nIt's also better to\nask them what they need\nor how you can help them\nbefore taking any actions\nthat might make things\nworse instead of better.\nDid you find this video
