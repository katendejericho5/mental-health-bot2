    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Go viewers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nDo you get bouts of\nanxiety from time to time?\nThis can be normal before a\nfirst date or a job interview\nsince these emotions often\nsubside after awhile.\nBut if your anxiety is persistent,\nthis can be concerning.\nContinuing to feel very\nanxious, even after a date,\njob interview or speech can\nindicate something else,\nan anxiety disorder.\nDoes this sound familiar?\nIf anxiety is something\nthat you deal with,\nyou're not alone.\nApproximately 19% of\nAmericans have experienced\nan anxiety disorder,\nand about 31% of Americans will experience\nan anxiety disorder in their lifetime.\nMany of us usually think of sweaty palms\nand heart palpitations\nas symptoms of anxiety,\nbut anxiety can manifest\nitself in other ways too.\nMost of the other signs go unnoticed.\nSo what are they?\nHere are six signs of anxiety\nthat often go unnoticed.\nNumber one, jaw pain.\nHave you ever noticed\njaw pain from anxiety?\nAnxiety is usually not the first thing\nyou may think of when you\nexperience jaw pain or toothaches.\nYou may usually blame a cavity\nor another dental problem,\nbut jaw pain and toothaches\ncan also be caused by anxiety.\nMore specifically bruxism.\nThis is when an individual\nunconsciously and excessively\ngrinds or clenches their teeth.\nBruxism is a by-product of stress.\nWhen we're stressed our\nwhole body clenches up\nin preparation to fight or flight,\nhence teeth grinding and jaw pain.\nStudies support this theory,\nstating that there is a high\nindex of anxiety among bruxers,\nas opposed to non-bruxers.\nBut anxiety is not the only\nmental health condition\nthat causes this.\nPeople with depression and neuroticism\ncan also experience toothaches\nas a result of bruxism.\nThe condition is usually\nself-diagnosed and can be treated.\nMost teeth grinding\nactivity happens overnight.\nSo you may not notice that early on.\nMorning tooth pain is\nusually the first clue.\nIf you wake up with jaw pain frequently,\nconsider finding what\nis causing you stress.\nIt may take some time but always seek help\nfrom a licensed professional if necessary.\nNumber two, scattered thinking.\nAnother sign of anxiety,\nscattered thinking.\nAnxiety floods, your thoughts\nwith negativity and doubts.\nOften these thoughts are disruptive,\nand can easily make you\nforget your surroundings.\nYou may come off as unattentive.\nWhile intrusive thoughts\ncan steal your attention,\nthere's also another reason why\nyou may feel scatterbrained.\nAnxiety can have neurological effects\nas well as physical ones.\nIt affects your limbic system,\nspecifically the prefrontal cortex.\nThis part of the brain is known\nfor executive functioning,\nbut it's also responsible\nfor social behavior.\nWhen you're anxious,\nyour prefrontal cortex\nand other structures of your\nlimbic system are impaired.\nAs a result you may find\nthat you lose the thread\nof a conversation or have\ntrouble concentrating on a task.\nIf this is something deal with often,\ntry to ground yourself in the present.\nThere are many wonderful\ngrounding techniques.\nThe most popular one is box breathing.\nWanna try?\nOkay.\nBreathe in for four seconds.\nOne, two, three, four.\nNow hold for four.\nOne, two, three, four.\nNow exhale for four.\nOne, two, three, four.\nAnd then hold again for four.\nOne, two, three, four.\nAh!\nBetter?\nI sped it up a little bit,\nbut try to take your\ntime with it next time.\nNumber three, cold feet.\nI'm sure you've heard the\nterm getting cold feet.\nThere's a reason this popular\nidiom describes being nervous.\nWhen you're anxious,\nperhaps similar to right\nbefore you get married,\nyour body jumps into fight or flight.\nThis reaction triggers a\ncascade of neurological\nand hormonal shifts.\nOne of them is that it tells your brain\nto release adrenaline.\nAdrenaline helps you\nredirect your blood flow\nso the most of it is sent\nto your vital organs,\nlike your heart and lungs.\nConsequently, your extremities\nstart to feel cold.\nNumber four, irritability.\nDo you easily become irritated?\nIrritability is a common sign of anxiety.\nHowever, it's a symptom we\noften overlook or ignore.\nIt's a sign that you're\noverwhelmed with stress.\nAnxiety is associated\nwith hypersensitivity,\nmeaning that you'll be much more sensitive\nto your surroundings,\nwhich may cause you to feel\nmore irritated than usual.\nNumber five, impulsive buying.\nAnother sign of anxiety is impulsivity.\nIn this case, impulse buying.\nHowever impulsivity can manifest itself\nin many different ways, such\nas engaging in risky behavior.\nImpulsivity as a result of anxiety\ncan be due to various factors.\nThe main one is that your\norbital frontal cortex,\nanother branch of your\nlimbic system, is affected.\nStudies found that anxiety\nincreases the blood flow\nto that region, which\nconsequently increases activity.\nAn increase in activity can lead to either\nimpulse control issues,\nhoarding, or impulse spending.\nAdditionally anxiety affects\nyour prefrontal cortex\nand makes it harder for you to make wise\nand thoughtful decisions.\nImpulse buying, as well as hoarding,\nare also forms of self-soothing.\nThey provide a false sense\nof comfort and security.\nIf you do find yourself caving in\nand taking financial risks,\nplease consider reaching\nout to a therapist for help.\nAnd number six, crying easily.\nWhen's the last time you cried?\nOne last sign that goes\nunnoticed is crying easily.\nInexplicably bouts of crying can mean\nyou're overwhelmed by the\nsituation you find yourself in.\nNot only can it be because\nof a sensitivity to stress,\nbut it can also be due to\nyour fight or flight response.\nThe correct terminology is\nfight, flight, or freeze.\nFeeling stuck or freezing\namidst a perceived threat\ncan progress these overwhelming\nfeelings of stress.\nWhen you find yourself crying,\nattempt to relax by taking a deep breath.\nThen allow yourself to cry.\nCrying can release all of those feelings\nyou may be holding onto.\nIt may be great to find\nadditional ways to self-sooth\nwhen you're feeling anxious as well.\nSo have you experienced\nany of these signs?\nI have.\nWhat are some self-soothing\nbehaviors that help you?\nI enjoy walking.\nFeel free to let us know\nin the comments down below.\nAnxiety is quite common\nand can be manageable.\nIf you ever need help or guidance\nreaching out to a therapist\nor
