    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Go'ers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nDo you dread small talk?\nDo you avoid it at all costs?\nWorry about how to get out\nof the awkward silence?\nWell, Psych2Go is here to help you.\nIt can be hard for introverts\nto enjoy small talk.\nAnd even if you're not an introvert,\nsmall talk can be pretty unexciting.\nSo we've gathered a few tips to help you\ntake on small talk one\nconversation at a time.\nHere is \"How to Survive Small Talk.\"\nNumber one, attempt to\nrelax and meditate first.\nDo you get nervous when small talk begins\nand you're unsure of what to say next\nto keep the conversation going?\nWell, try taking a deep\nbreath and try to relax.\nThere are plenty of people\nwho can become anxious when socializing.\nIf you're one to become\nanxious before social events,\naddress these feelings.\nAcknowledge how you're feeling\nand try to assure yourself\nanything can happen.\nThat means good things\nalong with any mistakes\nyou may be worried about.\nBut odds are no one will\nremember that little mistake\nyou made at a party one\ntime five years ago, right?\nRight.\nReassurance.\nTry meditating before an event\nand relax your body and mind.\nSo when the event does start,\nyou're prepared and calm.\nNumber two, ask questions.\nDo you feel nervous when the\nquestions are placed on you?\nSuddenly, they're asking\nwhat you ate for breakfast\nand you can't remember if it\nwas lasagna or a banana salad.\nWait, banana salad?\nIs that even a thing?\nAnd why would you have\nlasagna for breakfast?\nThat was last Tuesday's dinner.\nThe point is, if you're\nnot looking to talk about\nyourself too much, and the\nconversation's been on you\nfor quite awhile, ask\nquestions about them.\nSimple, right?\nBut it's true.\nShow some curiosity and ask\nabout them and their hobbies,\nor if they've seen any of your\nfavorite shows or new shows.\nLet the talking commence.\nNumber three, ask follow-up questions.\nSo you asked some questions,\nbut it's time to really get curious.\nAsk follow-up questions to\nkeep the conversation going.\nDo your best to ask questions\nyou're genuinely curious about.\nFor example, a question like\nwho's your favorite character\non the show?\nWe all know the classic,\n\"How's your day been?\"\nBut instead of asking it\nlike it's a polite, routine question,\ndig into your curiosity and\nsound like you have a soul.\nYou do have one, right?\nRight.\nReassurance, people!\nNumber four, ask open-ended questions too.\nHave you been asking\nquestions when small talking?\nHave you been asking follow-up questions?\nWell, now it's time for\nopen-ended questions.\nOpen your mind and start asking.\nIt's best to avoid just\nasking yes or no questions,\nor questions they can simply\nprovide a one-word response to.\nGive them something to chew on.\nMake them wanna think about their answer.\nIf you ask an interesting\nand open-ended question\nperhaps about why they like the character\nthat you just mentioned,\nthey'll have an easier time\nproviding a more elaborative answer.\nAnd number five, avoid\nonly short responses.\nHave you been asking questions all night?\nHave you responded to questions\nwith only short responses?\nIt's time to elaborate and\nget into some fun detail.\nAs much as we're focused\non asking questions,\nit's also extremely\nimportant to equally provide\nsome answers yourself.\nDon't close off your responses,\ndive into the reasons\nwhy you chose that answer, if appropriate.\nIf someone compliments\nyour mood or outfit,\nexplain why you're feeling that way\nor add where you bought said outfit.\nAdding an extra sentence\nor two into your responses\nto routine questions\nopens up the conversation\nand invites the other person\nin to continue talking.\nEven if it is only small talk.\nSo how will you handle small talk?\nLet's hope you handle\nit with care and ease.\nWaite, ease and care?\nLet's just hope that\nyou have a comfortable\nand fun conversation, and\nwe'll see you next time.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did, don't forget\nto click the like button\nand share it with a friend.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go,\nand hit the notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAnd as always, thanks for watching."
