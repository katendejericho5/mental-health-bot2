    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Goers, welcome\nback to our channel.\nDo you have your eyes on\nsomeone you find attractive?\nDo you hope they'd find you\njust as appealing as well?\nThere's more to attraction\nthan simply looks.\nPersonality, values, interests, and more\ncan all play into attraction.\nAre you looking for tips\non how to make yourself more desirable?\nYou've clicked the right video.\nHere are seven things\nthat will make others subconsciously\nmore attracted to you.\nNumber one, wearing sunglasses.\nWhat makes a pair of sunglasses so cool?\nVanessa Brown, a lecturer at\nNottingham Trent University,\nwanted to find just that out.\nBrown reasons that sunglasses can help\nwith an overall symmetric face,\nhiding any symmetric\nimperfections around the eyes.\nSunglasses also hide the eyes,\nwhich can make someone appear mysterious,\njust like Gojo Satoru.\nBrown explained to \"The Cut,\"\n\"The eyes are such a tremendous\nsource of information\nand vulnerability for the human being.\"\nNumber two, being androgynous.\nAccording to a 1983 study\nfrom Dr. Linda A. Jackson\nfrom Michigan State University,\nthose with both feminine\nand masculine attributes\nare often rated as more attractive.\nResults indicated that androgynous persons\nwere favorably perceived on\nthe gender-linked dimensions\nof instrumentality and expressivity,\nand in sex neutral desirable traits.\nThey were regarded as better\nadjusted, more likable,\nand as having an advantage\nin the occupational domain\ncompared to masculine\nand feminine persons.\nNumber three, being a kind person.\nIt's always a good thing\nto be kind to one another.\nBut one study from China also suggests\nthat it may just make you appear\nmore physically attractive.\nThe study had three subject\ngroups examine pictures\nof people's faces and rate\nhow attractive they were.\nOne group was given\npersonality information\nthat was positive\nwhile the others were giving\nnegative information or none.\nThe group given positive\npersonality information\nrated the faces as more\nattractive than the others.\nThe study finds that positive personality\ncan increase perceptions\nof facial attractiveness,\nand that this phenomenon of halo effect\non facial attractiveness\nhas been evidenced.\nSo while we should all\nbe kind, no matter what,\nit's a nice bonus to\nknow that it may pay off\nin more ways than we think.\nNot only will we make others feel good\nand feel healthier and happier ourselves,\nbut we may just appear\nmore physically attractive\nthan before.\nNumber four, own a pet.\nSo that pet you've always\ndreamed of adopting,\nnow's the time.\nIn 2008, two French social\npsychologist decided\nto conduct an experiment.\nThey had a dashing young\nFrenchman named Antoine\napproach 240 randomly chosen women\nto ask for their phone\nnumber in hopes of a date.\nHalf of the women were\napproached by just Antoine.\nThe other half?\nWell, Antoine approached them\nwith an adorable gray dog\nnamed Gwendu by his side.\nA small 10% of women\ngave Antoine their number\nwhen he was alone.\nBut Antoine's odds went up to 30%\nwhen Gwendu was his wingman.\nThis is likely due to the idea\nthat owning a pet shows you\ncan handle responsibility,\nare caring, committed,\nand the dog's just really cute,\nperhaps making you cuter as well.\nIn another research study led\nby the University of Nevada-Las Vegas,\nanthropologist Peter Gray\nfound that 36% of men\nand 35% of women were\nmore attracted to someone\nwho owned a pet.\nIf you adopt a rescue\nanimal, your odds only grow.\n49% of men and 64% of women\nwere more attracted to someone\nwho adopted a pet.\nAlso, if you don't like pets,\nthe data doesn't look too good for you.\n54% of men and 75% of women said\nthey wouldn't consider dating someone\nwho didn't like pets at all.\nOpen your heart to animals, my friend.\nWho doesn't love a cute little puppy?\nNumber five, clearly\nexpressing your emotions\nand observing others.\nSo, how well do you express your emotions?\nIt's been commonly known\nthat communication is\nkey in relationships.\nSo it's very important\nthat you not only express your emotions\nbut observe how your partner\nor date is feeling as well.\nA 2016 study published in the journal\nProceeding The National\nAcademy of Sciences\nexamined whether people\nare attracted to others\nwhose affective behavior\nthey can easily understand.\nSo they had subjects\nwatch different people\nexperience different emotions.\nThe results?\nThe study states that\nthey found the better\na participant thought\nthey could understand\nanother person's emotions,\nthe more they felt attracted\ntowards that person.\nImportantly, these individual changes\nand interpersonal attractions\nwere predicted by activity\nin the participant's reward circuit,\nwhich in turn signaled\nhow well the participant's\nneural vocabulary was suited\nto decode the other's behavior.\nNumber six, tilting your head.\nA 2015 study published\nin the International Journal\nof Behavioral Ethology\nwanted to find out if head\ntilt and fertility contributed\nto aspects of a woman's attractiveness.\nThey had subjects rate\nfacial portraits of women.\nAccording to this study,\nthey found that the fertile phase portrait\nof each woman was deemed more attractive\nin 56 to 62% of cases.\nWhen the portraits were\nreclassified by head pitch,\nthe more downward tilted\nportrait was preferred\nin 64 to 73% of cases.\nThey also found that downward\ntilted portraits were rated\nas more behaviorally alluring\nthan less downward tilted ones.\nAnd number seven, learn how\nto play a musical instrument.\nWhat's your favorite musical instrument?\nDo you plan to play?\nA 2014 research study found\nthat those who could compose\nand play complex music were seen\nas more attractive by women.\nAccording to the lead researcher\nat the University College Dublin,\nthe ability to complete complex\nmusic could be indicative\nof advanced cognitive abilities.\nThey go on to say that consequently,\nwomen may acquire genetic\nbenefits for offspring\nby selecting musicians able\nto create more complex music\nas sexual partners.\nSo when it comes down to deciding\nwhich class to take next semester,\nsign yourself up for a good ol' band class\nor perhaps orchestra.\nNot only will you discover\nthe power of music,\nbut you'll be extra good-looking\nwhile rocking up that concerto.\nSo, do you do any of\nthese things on the list?\nDo you think it makes you more attractive?\nShare with us down below in the comments.\nIf you enjoyed this video,\ndon't forget to click the
