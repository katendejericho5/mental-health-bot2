    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hello, it's Psych2Go time.\n(graphic pops)\nAre you highly intuitive?\nIf you are, perhaps you're getting\nthat gut feeling right now\nthat we'd love for you to like,\n(bell dings)\ncomment, or share,\nin which case you're totally correct.\n(chuckles) All joking aside, though,\nI understand you might be getting images\nof psychics and crystal balls.\nTruthfully though,\n(graphic pops)\nit's not magic nor supernatural.\nIntuition is more Sherlock than charlatan.\nThe renowned psychiatrist\nand psychoanalyst,\nCarl Jung, defines intuition as a way\nof perceiving the world\nthrough our unconscious\nto bring forth ideas, images,\nand possibilities blocked out\nby rational thinking.\nEssentially, it's the ability to get it\nwithout consciously reasoning it out.\nEveryone is capable of intuiting,\nbut just like dancing or singing,\nonly a rare few ever do it well.\nHere are eight very telling signs\nthat you are a highly intuitive person.\nNumber one, you're a deep thinker.\nDo you notice things others don't?\n(people chattering)\nMaybe you're frequently\nin your own head, making\nyou deeply in touch\nwith your own thoughts and feelings.\n(graphic pops)\nYou quietly observe\nand thus perceive so much\nmore than meets the eye.\nThese are traits of being a deep thinker\nand definitely help provide\nfood for your intuition.\nNumber two, you can easily read people.\nSo, five-card stud or Texas hold 'em?\nA good card player can\nread people like a book\nand so can the highly intuitive.\n(graphic pops)\nYou read, study,\nand understand others.\nYou pick up on all the cues\nfrom body language to choice of words,\nallowing you to assess\ntheir entire emotional state\nand likely train of thought.\nSo if you always seem to know\nwhen something is out of the ordinary,\neven if the other person is\ntrying to hide their feelings\nfrom you, this may be the reason why.\nNumber three, you're highly empathetic.\n(person crying)\nIf you cry, I cry.\n(graphic pops)\nWhen you're joyful,\nthe happiness is infectious.\nIf you feel this way,\nit's likely a sign of a\ndeep sense of empathy.\nYou feel what they feel\nand easily relate to their mood.\nHighly intuitive people are\nvery sensitive to the feelings,\nmood, and attitudes of those around them\nfor this very reason.\nThis gives you a good lead,\noh highly intuitive one,\nto accomplish point number four:\nyou're a good judge of character.\nYou know those times when you meet someone\nand they feel off,\n(people chattering)\ndespite the sparkly smile they present?\nOr when you distance yourself from someone\nbecause of a feeling,\nfinding out later they're a fake friend.\nYou're not infallible.\nThere are times when all\nthat charisma, charm,\nand beauty fool you,\nhowever you, more often\nand more easily than most,\nare able to rip off that veneer\nand see the truth underneath.\nNumber five, self-awareness\nis second nature to you.\nYou can't know a person better\nthan they know themselves.\nAnd with intuitives, this may\nbe more accurate than usual.\nIntuitives are so thoughtful\nand self-reflective,\nthey have a solid and honest understanding\n(people giggling)\nof who they are,\nwhat they think, feel, want, and believe.\nThey embrace their uniqueness.\nThey're consciously aware\n(graphic pops)\nand accepting of all\ntheir character traits,\nboth positive and negative.\nThis leads to them being more confident,\nmature, opinionated, and driven than most.\nNumber six, you have a creative side.\nDo you consider yourself\nan artistic person\nor even have creative leanings\nand hobbies such as drawing,\ndancing, or designing?\nMaybe you enjoy art and\nhave a deep appreciation\nfor the beauty of the every day\nthat others might see as mundane?\nIntuitive people often have\na natural creative streak.\nThey have an inexplicably\ndeep well of inspiration\nto draw from.\nCreative self-expression is\ntheir favorite way of connecting\nwith the world and the people around them.\nNumber seven, you're a vivid dreamer.\nSigmund Freud, the founding\nfather of modern psychology,\nonce said, \"Dreams were\nthe road to understanding\nour innermost thoughts and feelings.\"\nAlthough there are some disagreements\non the scientific validity\nof dream analysis,\nmany psychologists and\nscholars still believe\nthat our dreams are manifestations\nof our subconscious\ndesires, fears, and ideas.\nSo if you remember your\nvivid dreams, lucid dreams,\nor can make sense of your dreams,\nit means that you're deeply attuned\nto your unconscious mind.\nAnd number eight, you\nlet your heart have a say\nin your choices.\nWhen you're gifted with good intuition,\nsometimes you just know things\nyou can't explain rationally.\nDecisions are made via gut\nfeelings and have good results.\nThis is because our\nintuition bridges the gap\nbetween our conscious\nand unconscious minds.\nIt knows what we want\nand what's best for us\neven before we realize it for ourselves\nbecause it doesn't try\nto rationalize everything\nand make compromises.\nSo do you relate to any of the signs\nwe've talked about here?\nAre you a highly intuitive person?\nThe next time someone says to\nyou, \"How did you know that?\"\nDo you just shrug and say, \"I just did.\"\nGive us a shout.\nWe'd love to hear your experiences.\nIf you want more of this,\nstay tuned and subscribe,\n(bell dings)\nand we'll see you next time."
