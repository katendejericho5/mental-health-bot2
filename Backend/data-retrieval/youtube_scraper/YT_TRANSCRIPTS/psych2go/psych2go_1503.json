    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nPerhaps Brazilian Novelist, Paulo Coelho\nsaid it best when he said,\n\"Sometimes your heart needs time to accept\nwhat your head already knows.\"\nIt's not always easy for us to see\nwhen the love someone once felt for us\nhas turned toxic.\nWe might feel it from time-to-time\nwhen we start to wonder to ourselves,\nif perhaps we deserve better than this,\nbut at the end of the day,\nit's just too hard for us to let go.\nSo we excuse a few bad behaviors,\nand just chalk it up to reasons like,\n\"Oh, they must be having a bad day.\"\nOr \"Maybe they didn't mean it that way.\"\nBut there's a difference between\nthe healthy amount of conflict\nall couples are bound to experience,\nand the red flags\nof being in a toxic relationship.\nHere are seven telltale signs\nthat the love someone might feel for you\nis actually toxic.\nNumber one.\nThey get unreasonably\njealous and possessive.\nMost people tend to have\nthis misguided belief\nthat a partner's jealousy\nis actually a sign\nof how much they care about you.\nBut while there is some truth\nto the idea that jealousy\nstems from a fear of losing your partner,\nand it's a perfectly normal emotion\nto feel from time-to-time.\nBe careful not to romanticize it too much.\nBecause when your partner\nstarts to get unreasonably jealous,\nand possessive over you all the time,\nit means that they think of you\nmore as their property\nthan your own person.\nNumber two.\nThey act passive aggressive towards you.\nDoes your partner often tell you\nit's okay to do something\nlike go out with your friends\ninstead of them for example,\nthen get hurt or upset\nwhen you take their word for it.\nDo they forgive you for your mistakes\nonly to throw it back in your face\nthe moment you have a disagreement\nabout something?\nOr resort to tactics\nlike giving you the cold shoulder,\nwithdrawing their affection,\nor treating you with sarcasm,\ninstead of actually\ntelling you what's wrong?\nPassive aggressive behaviors like these\nare not only manipulative and controlling,\nbut they also show that your partner\nmay lack the emotional maturity,\nand communication skills needed\nto be in a committed lasting relationship.\nNumber three.\nThey have issues with codependency.\nDefined as a dysfunctional relationship\ncharacterized by a lack of boundaries,\nmost often stemming from one partner's\nextreme fear of abandonment.\nBeing in a codependent relationship\nis emotionally draining,\nand damaging to your self esteem,\nand sense of identity.\nCodependency means always having to save\nyour partner from themselves.\nFixing all of their problems for them,\nand attending to their every beck,\nand call without ever\ngetting anything in return.\nNumber four.\nThere's an uneven power dynamic.\nNo matter how good someone might be\nat getting you to believe they love you,\nbe it with their lavish gifts,\nflowery words or grand gestures,\nif they constantly expect you\nto prioritize their wants,\nand needs over your own,\nthen they don't really love you.\nThey only love having control over you.\nThey love being the one\nwho always gets a say in everything you do\nthat makes all your decisions,\nand tells you what's best for you.\nSo if you feel disrespected\nor unappreciated by your partner,\nlike you don't really have any power\nin your relationship,\nyou should probably watch out.\nNumber five.\nIt feels bad all of the time.\nNow you might be asking yourself,\n\"Why would anyone ever stay\nin a relationship\nthat makes them feel bad all the time?\nWhy not just leave?\"\nBut real life is rarely ever that simple.\nToxic relationships\nrarely ever start out that way.\nMost of the time,\npeople don't even notice when things start\nto turn toxic,\nand by then,\nthey already feel too much love\nor commitment towards the other person\nto just end things with them like that.\nBut make no mistake.\nIf your partner makes you\nfeel bad all the time,\nand there is constant\ndrama in your relationship,\nthen the love they have\nfor you is likely toxic.\nNumber six.\nYou lose yourself in the relationship.\nWhile it might sound romantic\nto make someone your whole world,\nand throw yourself into\na relationship with them,\nwe should always remember\nthat being committed\nto our partners is not\nthe same as giving up\nour own sense of identity,\nand individuality\nfor the sake of our relationship.\nWe should never be so consumed by anyone\nthat we end up over compromising,\nand changing too much of ourselves\njust to please them,\nand make our relationship work.\nAnd number seven.\nYou over idealize one another.\nLast but certainly not least,\nwe must warn you against\nthe perils of being\nwith someone who over idealizes you.\nWhile it might seem incredibly flattering,\nand romantic at first,\nit can quickly turn toxic too.\nNothing destroys a relationship\nfaster than over idealizing one another.\nBurdening them with unrealistically\nhigh expectations,\nand not giving each other the freedom\nto be flawed and make mistakes.\nBecause at the end of the day,\nit means that it's not\nyou they're in love with,\nit's a version of you\nthat doesn't even exist.\nSo is there anyone in your life\nwho you think loves you in a toxic way?\nIf so, we highly urge you to weigh\nthe pros and cons between trying\nto patch things up with this person,\nor just distancing yourself\nfrom them altogether\nfor the sake of your mental,\nand emotional well-being.\nAnd if you're struggling\nwith being in a toxic relationship,\nplease don't hesitate to reach out\nto a mental health care\nprofessional today,\nand get the help that\nyou need and deserve.\nDid you enjoy this video?\nPlease like and
