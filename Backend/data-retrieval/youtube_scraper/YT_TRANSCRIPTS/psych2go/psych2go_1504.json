    "transcript": "- [Thomas] Welcome, everyone.\nThank you so much for tuning in.\nWe're here today with a\ndoodle, with a livestream.\nI'm your host, my name is Thomas.\nI also run the second channel\nin which we talk about\nanimation, illustration, digital art,\nall that kind of good stuff.\nNow in Psych2Go,\nwe present our videos in\na format that is animated.\nAnd so aside from the psychology content,\nthere's a lot of people\nwho watch the videos\nfor the illustrations, the art stuff.\nAnd so, because of that kind\nof interest building up,\nwe have decided to create a platform\nwhere you guys can learn,\nmaybe how to even become an animator\nfor Psych2Go in the future.\nNow, seeing as this is\nmy first live stream\nthat I've ever hosted, I\nwill need your guys' input\non whether or not, for example,\nyou guys can hear me if\nthe background music's\ntoo loud, if it's too quiet.\nI am keeping a somewhat of\nan eye on the live chat.\nHowever, can't look at it all the time\nespecially cause there's\na lot of you guys.\nAnd so I might miss some\nmessages here and there.\nWe do have a second channel, yes,\nyou can find it in the related channels\non the Psych2Go channel itself.\nOr you can just look\nup Sketchi by Psych2Go,\nthat's S K E T C H I.\nNow we're going to, I guess,\njump straight into the drawing,\nbut feel free to add\nsuggestions or requests\nor even ask questions during the stream.\nAnd I'll be happy to\nanswer them, if I can.\nThat being said,\nthis is also a kind of\nmembership promotion stream.\nAnd so I'm going to have to\nsplit it somewhere or another.\nI can't respond to every\nsingle last message,\nalthough I'd love to, I'd love to.\nAnd so even if this wasn't\nlike a membership stream,\nprobably the messages that are\ngonna catch my eye the most\nare the ones that use\nour Psych2Go emoticons,\nwhich you can gain access to,\nif you join our membership.\nDetails on Psych2Go\nmembership in the description.\nThat is a lot of clerical\nstuff out of the way, I guess.\nI will also mention\nthat there is a giveaway\ngoing on right now.\nSo you see this program that\nI'm using to draw right now.\nI guess I'm not drawing right now.\nI'm just pressing the redo key\nbecause I drew a little\nbit of a sketch beforehand,\njust so we wouldn't have to, you know,\nsit through all that\nboring stuff together.\nBut this program that I'm using right now,\nI am running a giveaway\nfor some free copies of it.\nSo details on that later on in the stream\nwhen a bit more people have filed in now.\nAgain, remind or let me\nknow if the background music\nis like too loud, too\nquiet, something like that.\nSo we are going to start with our sketch.\nThe reason I'm drawing in\ncyan, now I don't, there's no,\nalmost no hard fast rules\nwhen it comes to art\nor like digital art and stuff.\nI like to recommend\nthat people starting out\ndo their sketches in cyan or, you know,\nsomething that's close to kind\nof white in the color wheel,\njust because it makes less\ncontrast with the paper.\nSo later on when you're drawing over it,\nyou can tell what is your\nline and what is your sketch.\nThat being said, if I\nwere doing this regularly,\nhow I like to do it,\nI'd probably just draw\neverything in black, yeah.\nEverything's perfect.\nI like to draw.\nI like to draw too.\nYep.\nYou can find more drawing content\nover at Sketchi by Psych2Go,\nwhich is our second channel.\nWe currently have some\ntutorials over there\nthat you might find useful,\nespecially for beginners.\nIt's really aimed toward mostly beginners,\nbut we will also be adding\nmore diverse content\nvery, very soon, a lot more fun stuff.\nThis female or male?\nSo right now,\nI suppose I'm drawing a character that is\nsomewhat more resembling a female.\nThe character in question we'll go draw,\nI didn't really set out to\nspecifically draw a character.\nJust kind of made a base\nfor a human right now.\nAnd so I'd love to take\nyour guys' suggestions\non how this person's going to turn out.\nWe're probably not going to finish,\nfinish the drawing today,\nbut I will be posting\nthe finished product,\nwell, we will be posting\nthe finished product\non the community tab, hopefully.\nAnd I'd love to put your\nguys' suggestions and names\nand stuff on the final thing too.\nThat is of course provided\nyou are a member, right?\nYou guys are joining the\nmembership on site to go, right?\nIt's kind of a new feature on YouTube\nor at least one that I hadn't\nheard about until recently,\nthat you can join Psych2Go\nand become a member.\nMembers gain a lot of perks,\nsuch as access to emoticons,\nshout outs, stuff like that.\nIt differs, the perks differ\ndepending on what channel\nspecifically, you're a member of.\nYou can be a member of multiple channels\nas far as I'm aware.\nBut I'd love to see\nsome Psych2Go emoticons\nin the chat right now.\nEmoticons, emojis?\nI'm a not so familiar with\nmodern internet slang.\nNow I actually, so in a\nlot of drawing programs,\nwe have what are called brushes.\nSo I have this brush that\nI downloaded very recently.\nIt kind of looks, makes it look sketchy.\nSee that as opposed to like this brush,\nwhich is a lot more clean.\nI'm not sure how I feel about it,\nnot very confident using it.\nSo I don't know why I'm using it in front\nof 400 of you guys right now.\nYes, as I said before, a\nspecial giveaway is going on\nright now where you can\nwin a copy of the program\nthat I'm using right now.\nMore details on that\nlater on in the stream.\nSo it's pretty good to, if\nyou're practicing drawing,\npracticing kind of things\nthat you're not used to,\nthings that you're not very good at,\nwhich isn't to say only do\nthings that you're not good at,\ncause that's an easy way to burn out.\nBecause you'll get frustrated\nand you'll be like I can't draw this.\nI, for example, like drawing portraits,\nI like drawing people.\nI'm not super into like for example,\nvehicles or animals or stuff like that.\nAnd so I like drawing people,\nbut with the territory\nof people comes things\nlike poses, anatomy.\nAnd so I'm always trying\nto challenge myself.\nAnd this pose in itself\nis also a challenge.\nI could have done something\neasy and just like made myself\nlook real good in front of you guys,\nmade myself look like\nI know what I'm doing,\nbut I chose to make a\nfool of myself today,\nby doing a very hard pose.\nYou might notice that I'm,\nsometimes I draw a line\nand it disappears like right after,\nit's because I'm not very\nsatisfied with the line\nand I'm pressing control Z, which is,\nas you guys might know,\nis the undo function\non pretty much any computer program.\nSo one of the good parts about digital art\nis that you can undo very, very easily,\nno need for an eraser or anything.\nThat being said, I don't\nreally undo that much.\nIf are doing this on my normal process.\nI actually use the eraser tool a lot,\nbut there's no shame\nin using the undo tool.\nIt's there for a reason\nlike you should use it.\nI see a lot of people\nhesitant, a lot of beginner,\njust a lot of hesitant about\nusing the undo tool a lot\nbecause they think it's kind of cheating.\nIt's not, it's there for a reason\nIs the art lagging for anyone else?\nI'm very sorry if it is lagging,\nplease let me know if that's an issue.\nSo we have the general\noutline of a human body here.\nWhat shall we make this human look like?\nI guess it doesn't have to be human.\nWe have our mascot named Psy on Psych2Go.\nIt's like a little marshmallow\nmen, thing, humanoid\nwith like a leaf on his head.\nLike this.\nI'm not so sure if Psy is\na human, but regardless,\nI think we're going to\nadd the leaf on the head\nat the end of this character.\nDraw a toga.\nThat's not a bad idea.\nWho suggested that?\nPhoxe, I'm sorry if I pronounce\nyour name wrong, P H O X E.\nThank you for the suggestion.\nMaybe I'll, maybe I'll make\nthis character of me in a toga.\nI don't know.\nOne thing that a lot of people\nstarting out in digital art,\nmight not be super aware\nthat it's important,\nis line weight.\nSo you see here that these\nlines are pretty thick\nand these lines are pretty\nthin, I didn't actually mean\nfor these lines to be that thick.\nRegardless, line weight\nmatters because when\nit comes to art, a lot\nof art is about contrast.\nAnd so obviously thicker lines\nwill lead to higher contrast.\nHigher contrast things\nare usually more important\nto people or they recognize\nthat as being more important.\nAnd so their eyes go to it more quick.\nVines in the hair, I like the idea.\nElf ears, Sage, thank you for\nthe suggestions, elf ears.\nYou know what, I like that idea.\nI'm going to put this\nhere, so I don't forget.\nSo when it comes to ears\nin terms of anatomy years,\nso if I drew it like this,\nthis would mean that if\nyou look at this person\nfrom the front, then\ntheir ears would be going\nlike back like this,\nthat's not how ears work, right?\nWhen you look at someone from the front,\ntheir ears are kind of, you\ncan see it kind of like this.\nSo that means we have to\ndraw this person's ear\nkind of ending here, ish.\nYeah.\nAlso the ear typically\nstarts at the eyebrow, ish,\ntop of the eye and ends at the nose.\nSo I predict that the nose is\ngoing to be somewhere here.\nSo we're going to end the ear here.\nEven if it is an elf year, which\nisn't really human anatomy,\nwe're still going to stick\nto some principles of that.\nBow tie on her head suggested by bunnyX_*\nWe'll see.\nIf a better suggesting,\ncan you surp that one?\nI'm sorry, Bunny, but, but you know,\nnothing wrong with a little bow tie on,\nknow what I'm saying,\nknow what I'm saying?\nI guess it's not a bow\ntie if it's in her hair,\naren't bow ties like what\nyou wear on your neck?\nSo a lot of people will\nhave difficulties with ears.\nI don't typically like\nto recommend shortcuts\nwhen it comes to drawing.\nBut if you want to shortcut\nfor ears, you can just do this.\nIf you look at an ear and\nlike, you really look at it,\ntheir not that hard to draw.\nSo this is looking way too creepy.\nOne thing that a lot of\npeople, including me sometimes,\nmake a mistake on is that\nthey add too much detail\non certain parts that don't need it,\nsuch as individual nostrils\nor individual teeth.\nAnd it ends up making a\ncharacter look creepy.\nAnd that's because that's\na level of detail issue.\nLevel of detail is kind\nof a higher level concept\nthat I don't want to too much get into.\nBut basically it's if\nyou were to draw like\nindividual teeth, it'd\nbe as weird as like,\nnot as like drawing body hair,\nlike individual body\nhairs from the character.\nSo I've elected to not\ndraw this ear right now.\nSometimes you just make\nup the process as you go,\nas I am doing right now,\nI'm not going to draw the ear right now.\nI'm going to try it when the hair\nand the other features are here.\nIf you want earrings, oh, earnings,\nyet earrings are fun to\ndraw because it's just like,\nI don't know, it's such\na nice, easy way to boost\nyour drawing without actually\ndoing anything that difficult.\nSo I'm going to, I don't typically like,\nI don't typically like to make\ntoo many layers in a drawing,\nbut I'm going to make\nanother layer for the hair.\nHow are we going to style the hair?\nCan you say hi with a purple heart?\nYes, Lucky mystery.\nI can say hi with a purple heart.\nMushroom earrings, purple\nhair, short wavy hair,\nshort wavy hair, I can do that.\nI'm going to have some\nfront bangs just because\nI like front bangs.\nDo I like front bangs?\nI like drawing them.\nI guess I have like my character\nin, in the corner here.\nI don't know if you guys have noticed,\nbut like my character like\nbecomes slightly brighter\nwhen I'm talking.\nI just thought that was pretty neat.\nAll right.\nSee, this is kind of a strange angle\nthat I'm not very used\nto drawing people in.\nAnd so, this might be a little awkward.\nYeah.\nSo we are running a\ngiveaway of the program\nthat I am using to draw.\nI am using Clip Studio\nPaint developed by Celsus,\nyou probably may have heard of it.\nIt's like one of the most\ncommon programs that people\nuse for drawing and even\nanimation, is capable of animation.\nIt's like, it's like, pros use it.\nSo the details for that\ngiveaway are actually\nin the latest video currently\non the Sketchi channel.\nBut basically the rules are pretty simple.\nYou just have to leave\na comment on that video\nand you're already\nentered to be potentially\none of the people that are walking away\nwith a free 12 month license\nof Clip Studio Paint EX,\nwhich is basically like\nthe like pro version\nof Clip Studio Paint.\nSo I'm going to be honest,\nI'm not really liking how\nthis is looking right now,\nbut we're going to keep\npushing on forward.\nWhen it comes to drawing,\nsometimes you just have to\nkeep pushing on, trust in the process,\nand that comes with experience.\nCat eyes would make this\ncharacter look a little creepy,\nbut thank you for the suggestion.\nThe forehead sticking out here.\nI have seen a comment saying that\nit looks a little unnatural.\nActually, that is an\nexpression of the brow bone,\nwhich is at this angle, visible.\nNo such thing as hard fast rules in art.\nYou might've noticed, I\nflipped my canvas there.\nLike I flipped horizontally\nfor a second there.\nThat is because I need to make sure that\nthis picture is balanced.\nA mistake that a lot of people make\nis they don't make sure\ntheir pictures are balanced.\nIf it looks good flipped,\nit looks good normal,\nit's balanced.\nYou're gonna like, if\nreally care about that,\nyou're probably going to do that a lot\nwhen you're starting out, but\nas you draw more and more,\nyou're going to be able to\nget away with doing it less.\nBecause it's just, it's like built in.\nSo I'm going to make this brush\nactually a little thinner.\nI just joined what's going on.\nWell, thank you for joining.\nWe are just drawing, we're\njust chilling out, drawing,\nanswering some, just like\nanswering some questions,\ntalking about the giveaway we're running\non the second channel where we talk about\nart and illustration, digital art,\nall that kind of good stuff.\nI underestimated how\ndifficult it is to multitask,\nto talk, and to draw at the same time.\nThis is unexpectedly quite difficult.\nI'd love to put more care into the hair,\nbut we already don't\nreally have that much time.\nMy left ear is enjoying your voice,\nmy right isn't getting any fun.\nOh no.\nBy any chance, have I only\nbeen speaking in your guys'\nleft ear this entire time?\nOh my.\nI really hope that isn't the case.\nReally hope that isn't the case.\nOh man, I'm gonna be so embarrassed.\nIf that's the case.\nAgain, this is the first\ntime I've ever done\na live stream or anything\nlike that in my life.\nBut I guess that's not really excuse for\nonly being audible in\none ear for you guys.\nThis isn't a choker, but I\nlike drawing turtlenecks,\ncause they're fun, they're fun.\nIt's a real conflict cause\nI like drawing turtlenecks,\nbut I also like drawing collarbones.\nI can't win.\nI'm very not satisfied\nwith how this hair looks.\nSometimes you just gotta, you know,\nyou just gotta, just gotta,\nyeah make the dinosaurs go extinct.\nThere we go.\nI've only been talking on your guys' left.\nI really don't know how to fix that.\nOh God, oh God, okay.\nThis is, this is quite a problem.\nAnd you guys didn't tell me\nand you guys didn't tell him.\nNo, you guys did tell me,\nthat's not your fault.\nOkay, well full disclosure,\nit's because I am using a mic interface\nand that is usually rooted\nto a left and a right.\nBut it's only rooted into one.\nSo it's like coming out\nof only one ear right now.\nThat's fantastic.\nMy first stream and\nalready I am destroying\nyour guys' hearing.\nAll right, all right,\nwe got a poll running.\nIs Thomas' audio coming\nfrom your left side only?\nIt's like we're sitting next to you.\nYou know what?\nYou guys are so sweet.\nThe fact, somebody said chat,\nthe fact that I'm only\ncoming out of the left ear,\nit makes it seem like\nI'm sitting next to you.\nYou know what?\nI'd love to be your friend in real life\nbecause you are very, you're\nvery good at making people\nfeel better about themselves.\nOh dear.\nYeah, I got a lot of comments\non the Sketchi channel\nthat are like, yo, I love your voice.\nAnd then like, I never know\nhow to respond to that.\nLike it's, it's my voice, I don't know.\nThank you, thank you though.\nAnd like, sometimes people\nthink like I'm like putting\non a voice, but I'm like not.\nOkay, cause yeah.\nAnd I think people with\ndeep voices will relate,\nbut like sometimes people can't hear you\nif you have a deep voice.\nAnd so like, I sometimes\nlike put on a voice\nto make it higher because I,\npeople like legit cannot hear me.\nAnyone else, anyone else do that?\nLike, if I'm like with my friends,\nplaying basketball outside or something,\nif I got like, yo pass,\nyo, yo, pass the ball,\nthen they can hear me.\nOne of the most crucial\ntimes to flip the canvas\nto make sure if you're drawing even or not\nis when you're drawing the eyes.\nNow again, we are trying\nto remind you guys\nthat your membership is a thing.\nAnd so we love seeing the\nPsych2Go emoticons in the chat.\nIf you didn't know, if you\nsign up for our membership,\nyou'll gain access to loads of perks,\ndepending on, you know, what\ntier of membership you choose.\nBut they include Psych2Go\nemoticons that you can use\nin chat on our comments,\net cetera, et cetera.\nAnd so we loved seeing those.\nAnd so I am, once again, I am once again,\nshilling for Psych2Go membership.\nThis is okay.\nBut like, I don't really\nlike, oh man, this pose,\nlike this was very ambitious of me.\nYou live, you live and learn.\nI have a new idea.\nRemember when I erased all the hair?\nI'm gonna do that with the face too.\nOh man, I know someone\nout there's screaming.\nCause I scream when I watch other people\ndraw something and then\nthey just erase everything.\nThere's a lot of comments\nasking for a mushroom hat.\nOkay, like Toad, like from Mario?\nActually, in an upcoming\nvideo on the Sketchi channel,\nI do a Toad impression.\nSo if you want to see that.\nI don't know if this is gonna make it into\nthe final video though.\nIt's really annoying.\nAs all toad impressions are.\nI'd love to do it right now,\nbut I'm like very close to the mic\nand I'm going to destroy\nyour guys' left ear.\nMan, I am going to find\nout why that's happening\nand it will never happen again.\nI'm so sorry about that audio issue.\nAbby, thank you for joining\ntier one membership.\nThank you, thank you.\nOh, I think I missed another one too.\nI'm sorry if I pronounced your name wrong,\nbut thank you for joining\ntier one membership as well.\nWe love our members.\nYeah, if you guys have\nany like questions also\nthen feel free to drop them.\nYep.\nYeah, see sometimes just\nlike erasing everything\njust makes everything better.\nI'm already liking this way\nbetter than what I had before.\nOh gosh, I'm gonna flip it over\nand it's going to be a disaster.\nPurple hair, I've been\ncommenting since the start.\nAll right, well the\nfaithful shall be rewarded.\nWe purple hair.\nWhat does it mean to be a member?\nSo YouTube, I didn't even know\nthis until recently either,\nbut YouTube has this\nlike membership thing.\nAnd so it basically\nmeans that you get access\nto a bunch of Psych2Go\nperks such as access\nto our exclusive emoticons\nthat you can use on the\ncomments of the channel.\nAnd I believe our live streams.\nI don't know the extent of\nthe usage of the emoticons.\nAnd I don't even know if\nthey're called emoticons.\nThat's what they were\ncalled back in my day.\nOh no, I've outed myself as an old person.\nI'm not that old.\nBut I don't know if you\nguys have remember MSN,\nthat's where we use the emoticons.\nBut you get access to those,\nyou get access to a lot of other perks,\nsuch as shout outs in videos.\nIt is a paid service\nthough, so only you do it\nif you're in the financial situation to.\nThere's a lot of other\nways you can support\nthe channel without having\nto open up your wallet.\nCause I know a lot of\npeople aren't necessarily\nin a financial situation or you know,\nto contribute that way.\nGreen eyes, cherry blossom colors.\nI really liked cherry blossom colors,\nactually pastel pink is\none of my favorite colors,\nas you can see on my choice\nof clothing on my character.\nSo I'm liking this character a lot more\nthan when I started it out.\nAfter erasing the head.\nSpeaking of erasing the head,\ndo you guys know about\nthe movie Eraserhead?\nI've never watched it myself,\nbut I read the synopsis on Wikipedia,\ndon't read the synopsis.\nDon't watch it, it's creepy.\nIt's like actually, I'm not\ntrying to like bait you,\nit's like actually kind of very\ndisgusting and gross though.\nI don't know why I mentioned\nit, I shouldn't have,\nI've opened Pandora's box.\nI may never stream again on this channel\nand might be banned for\nmentioning Eraserhead.\nThe point of view is looking up,\nso maybe bangs would be fun.\nThank you for those\nsuggestions, skips back up.\nGreen eyes, okay, so as far as I remember,\nwe need an elf ears,\ngreen eyes, purple hair,\nearrings, elf ears, stuff like that.\nSo, okay.\nI think we can get rid of\nthis, oh wait, no I can't.\nI like keep drawing one\npart and then moving on\nto another part without\nfinishing the others.\nWhoops.\nSo I get a lot of like questions\nabout like drawing folds\nin clothes, to be honest,\nthere's no one like quick,\neasy way to do it.\nI would say, you can try\nand it could look decent,\nbut honestly, just like\neven just drawing one,\nusing a reference, usually\nhelps a lot for the future.\nThe thing with using references,\nis that you can't just like,\nit's not copy drawing necessarily.\nIt's like actually looking\nat it and like figuring out\nwhat's happening in the picture,\nyou know what I'm saying?\nSo like for example,\nI can draw just a bunch of\nlike folds, willy-nilly,\nbut if they don't make sense, physically,\nour eyes might pick up on like, you know,\nthe viewers eyes might pick up on that,\nand it might lead to kind\nof a not so great result.\nSo gotta be cautious of that.\nAt the same time they say\nperfection, what is it?\nPerfection is the killer of done?\nPerfect is the enemy of done?\nDon't beat yourself up too much if you\ncan't get clothes folding right\nthe first time, who cares?\nWe're all doing it for fun.\nWho even cares?\nCan I do partial hetero chromia,\nisn't hetero chromia like\nalways partial, anyway?\nOne eye is a different\ncolor than the other.\nI think I know someone like that.\nI'm just straight up, like\nmy eyes are like so dark.\nThey're like black, I know\nblack eyes don't exist.\nThey're always like brown\neyes, dark, dark brown eyes.\nMine are very like dark.\nMan, okay, we're not going\nto spend too much time\non details that don't matter as much.\nDo a poll for Toad impression.\nIf you guys really want to\nhear the Toad impression,\nI'll do it.\nBut I don't know.\nMaybe if one more person\njoins the membership.\nNo, I'm not going to do that.\nI mean I might do the Toad impression,\nI meant I'm not going to do\na, you know, take bribes.\nAnd make sure the hair is even.\nYeah, it's looking pretty okay.\nYeah, like I didn't used\nto be, like good at all.\nI'm not saying I'm even good\nright now to my standard,\nat least, at like getting things right.\nLike even the first time,\nbut I used to be a lot worse,\nbut really flipping the\ncanvas helps you recognize\nlike without even flipping\ncanvas being like,\noh, well this is going to\nbe uneven when I flip it.\nDo y'all have a suggestion for\ngetting over fear of eye contact?\nI know this is completely irrelevant,\nbut I saw that in the chat,\nI just thought it was interesting.\nIf I were to give advice,\nI mean I'm no expert or anything,\nI'm very, very introverted\nand non-confrontational,\nbut I would say as long as\nyou focus on the message\nof what you need to say\nand the message of what\nthey're saying, focus on them\nrather than yourself also,\nin pretty much any conversation, actually.\nEspecially in debates,\nthat's one of the biggest\ndebate advice I've ever heard.\nIf you're ever in an argument or a debate,\none of the best ways to not\nlike get all like, scared,\nis to focus on the other person.\nFocus on what they're saying,\nfocus on what you need to say.\nShe's French, yeah, it\nlooks like a burette.\nHow do you pronounce it?\nBeretta?\nBoray?\nI don't know, it's going\nto be a mushroom though.\nAll right, that's, oh gosh,\nI made it in one layer.\nOkay.\nI typically like to put\nhair, if nothing else,\nhair on its own layer.\nJust because there's so\nmany things that like hair\ncan like overlap with, it's\njust not worth the effort\nto put on the same layer.\nAnd here I am drawing ears\non the same layer of hair.\nClip Studio Paint also\nhas a vector layers,\nwhich make hair drawing really easy.\nI don't personally use them that much,\nbut you can look into that if you'd like,\nif you really have trouble\nwith drawing hair and stuff.\nWe have collaborated\nwith Clip Studio Paint,\nwhich is the program that\nI'm using to draw right now.\nWe are giving away three free licenses,\n12 month licenses of Clip Studio EX,\nwhich is like professional program,\nwhere you can draw and\nanimate pretty much like how\nyou see the animations\non the Psych2Go videos.\nSo check out the Sketchi channel,\nif you're interested in that giveaway.\nFor those of you who are wondering why\nI keep repeating myself,\nit's because as this is a live stream\nthere are people who are\ntuning in a bit later.\nSo just want to make sure\neverybody gets the massage.\nThe message, not the massage.\nI'd love to, I don't want to say that\njust as a general statement,\nthat I'd love to massage\nyou guys because I don't,\nI'm gonna be honest.\nI don't massage strangers.\nI mean, you guys are not\nstrangers, you're my friends,\nbut I don't even massage\nsome of my friends.\nI have been told I am\ngood at massages though.\nIt's pronounced buh-ray, okay, thank you.\nPlease do a poll for Toad impression.\nI'm just saying, if I end up doing it,\nyou guys asked for it.\nI'm like trying to remember\nlike all the requests,\nit's a little difficult.\nI got Clip Studio free\nwith my Wakeon tablet,\nI don't actually know how it's pronounced.\nSo I actually have, I've talked to the,\nof course I had to talk to\nthe Clip Studio people to,\nyou know, get you guys to\nthis Clip Studio giveaway.\nBut as far as I know,\nClip Studio and Wakeham\nare like two peas in a pod.\nIf you're using Clip Studio,\nperhaps think about using Wakeham\nbecause they do a lot\nof collaborative stuff\nas far as I know.\nToad, Toad, Toad, oh my God.\nAll the comments are just Toad.\nGive her lemon gun?\nThat's from something, right?\nI feel like I recognize that reference.\nOkay, what I'm going to do,\nI'm going to erase like all the clothes\nand arm stuff, because\nI am not feeling it.\nStill gonna use this sketch.\nYeah, like there's not really a hard,\nfast rule for like how to do sketches.\nBut what I generally like\nto advise people, I mean,\nhere I am, again, giving\nunsolicited advice.\nWhat I genuinely like to recommend is\nmake your sketch as complicated or simple\nas you need it to be so that\nyou know where everything is\nand what it's going to look like.\nFor some people that\nmeans it's going to be\na pretty complicated,\nsketch for some people\nthat might mean it's very,\nvery simple elementary sketch.\nI don't always use the\nsketch before I draw.\nSo another anatomy thing, fun fact,\nthis length should be\napproximately this length.\nYeah.\nLike from this like neck part here,\nto like the hairline,\nshould approximately also be\nthe shoulder to the elbow.\nThat's why it's possible\nto, if you're like this,\nthat's why it's possible\nto put your, oh my God,\nto put your arm up here like this.\nBecause it's only the hairline,\nnot the actual top of the head,\nit's going to kind of like bend.\nAnyways, that's another\nunsolicited anatomy lesson.\nJust subscribed to the Sketchi channel,\nthank you Jens.\nGot tips for drawing hands?\nPractice,\nreally observe hands or practice\nthem in a lot of different\nposes because eventually\nyou're going to create\na kind of visual library in your head\nthat you can just reference\nwhen it comes to it,\nand you can kind of just draw them.\nI'm like weak at hands too.\nI don't know if there's any\nartists that are readily\nwilling to admit that\nthey like drawing hands\nor are good at them.\nNo, there's plenty,\nthere's plenty of artists\nthat are good at hands and they know it.\nWhat I like to do is, I like\nto draw hands in such a way\nthat I can just, I can draw the middle,\nand I can just try the\nsilhouette of the hand.\nBecause the actual separation\nbetween the fingers\nis the level of detail\nthat I don't really need\nto focus on in the line phase.\nI can color that in.\nMan, the sketch, the hand in\nthe sketch was pretty okay,\nbut I'm like struggling\nwith the line art right now.\nAnatomy teacher, Mr. Thomas.\nIf you will accept me as your teacher,\nI'm sure you can find way better teachers.\nAnatomy isn't as scary as you might think.\nHe just needs a good start.\nI am fortunate enough to\nhave had a teacher myself\nteach some very basic\nelementary things about anatomy.\nI believe in anatomy,\nquick rundown video is coming\nup on the Sketchi channel,\nso stay tuned for that.\nIf you want to subscribe\nto the Sketchi channel\nto make sure you don't miss that.\nYeah, see, so like, I'm\nlike drawing the hand here.\nIt's like, it's you can tell it's a hand,\neven though I didn't\ndifferentiate all the fingers,\nI just drew the silhouette.\nI'll do that when I color,\nbuild a differentiating work.\nSo unfortunately I'm not\ngoing to be drawing a toga,\nI don't think.\nMan, I really am kicking\nmyself for the whole\nleft ear audio thing still,\nI can't believe that's a thing, oh my God.\nDo you know what's worse too?\nIn the AV check that I did before this,\nwhen I was testing my audio and stuff,\nI'm pretty sure the earphones\nthat I'm using are actually\nonly, they only work in one ear.\nI couldn't have even, oh my gosh,\nI should have used proper\nearphones, I'm so sorry.\nAnyways, I'm not gonna draw\nmore attention to that anymore.\nHow are you guys doing?\nShould I do the Toad impression?\nI'll do it right before the stream ends.\nI hope the background music also,\nhasn't been like unbearably\nloud or an inaudibly quiet.\nI tried to select some nice\ncalm tunes for you guys\nbecause this is a dry and\nchill stream after all, so.\nOof, left ear only.\nI know, right.\nMan, if I were my own\nboss, I'd fire myself.\nNo, you don't fire people\nover something this small,\nright, right?\nPlease, don't fire me, please.\nI have a family.\nI have a dog, I don't have\nlike a family as in like,\nI don't have kids.\nI'm not that old.\nI'm not that old.\nI kind of imagine this girl\nwith a weapon under her arm.\nMan, if I could draw weapons.\nWeapons mecca stuff is like,\nyou gotta like learn that separate.\nAnd that's something to be honest,\nI know it sounds kind of like an excuse,\nbut I've never really been\ninterested in like mecca stuff.\nSo I just don't really draw it.\nNot really excuse, you can\ndraw whatever you want.\nI have another tip for\npeople who draw, by the way,\nif you are struggling with something like\nhow I am struggling, for some\nreason, with this sleeve here,\nI'm just gonna crop it out,\nI'm just gonna, I'm just gonna,\nI'm just gonna, you know, tilt it,\ntilt it a little bit more,\nand crop it out so I\ndon't have to draw it.\nHere we go.\n(chuckles)\nYou call it cheating, I call it technique.\nNow you have another issue,\nnever make something in your drawing,\nlike just touching lines with the frame.\nCause that's like the ugliest\nthing you could possibly do.\nSo what I'm going to do is,\nI'd love to make it bigger,\nbut that would make the\nhand like go out of frame.\nAnd I want the hand to be in frame,\nso I'm going to get smaller.\nDifferent from a robotic arm.\nTurtleneck should have triangle\nfolds to help me remember.\nI just think of triangles\nto simplify clothes.\nYeah, you can think of it\nlike that, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nThere's no like hard, fast rule,\nwhen it comes to like clothing folds.\nIt's like, where is the fabric\nlike actually going to fold?\nLike if you were observing\nthis in real life.\nSo I believe this has been\nflipped the entire time.\nIndeed.\nThere's another thing\nthat you shouldn't do,\nthat I do, name your layers cause I don't\nand it makes me waste like\n30 minutes per drawing.\nWhat's her name?\nThat's a good question.\nWe should make a name for her.\nI do believe we were going\nto give her earrings.\nQuick and easy way to\ndraw some black earrings\nis to just draw a little\nrectangle like that.\nI believe this was a\nmushroom hat as well, yes.\nAdd wings.\nI actually really liked\nbirds when I was little.\nSo I learned how to draw wings.\nI never really like learned,\nlearn how to draw wings.\nAll I know is that\nthere's like three parts\nto a bird's wing, it's like...\nI'm gonna draw this a little better,\nI'm gonna draw this a little better.\nSo like, if you have the wing here,\nyou have like this part of the feathers,\nthey're like a bunch of short feathers\nand you have a bunch of\nlong feathers over here\nand you have like medium feathers\nover here that are stuck together more.\nI don't know how to draw well though.\nWhenever I forget to name my layers,\nI always end up deleting the wrong ones.\nI feel you there Autumn.\nName her Adelaide.\nAdelaide is the name of the kid in\nKirby 64 Crystal Shards, right?\nHas anyone played that?\nI love that game.\nIt's like kinda like scary\nthough, because the final boss,\nlike there's like blood\nin a Kirby game, yeah.\nAngelina Carmila or Alina Lua.\nLua, I like Lua.\nIn the interest of time,\nI'm just gonna move right on to coloring.\nThis forearm is bothering me over here.\nThis is not how that should\nlook, arm's too short.\nIn the interest of time,\nI'm going to start coloring\nand then I was like,\nI just don't do that.\nWhat kind of stream host am I,\nI'm just getting everything wrong today?\nYou can only hear me in your left ear.\nI'm making promises that I can't keep\nlike coloring and the Toad voice.\nI will do the Toad voice.\nLua and Luna are two names that I'm seeing\na lot in chat right now.\nSpeaking of chat,\nI originally was trying\nto get like a chat thing\non the screen so that we\ncould see each other's chats\nas on the video itself.\nI don't know how to do that.\nPlain and simple.\nI'm still a caveman when\nit comes to technology, so.\nWhoops.\nOkay, we're just going\nto do this real sloppily,\nI don't even, yeah, like I said,\nwe're not gonna finish this\ndrawing in this stream,\nbut we're gonna, I'm trying\nto get as much suggestions\nin as possible before we end the stream,\nwhich will be soon already.\nOh my God, I'm gonna miss you guys.\nI'd love to do this again.\nI don't know if you guys will.\nOkay, okay, I'm gonna make a promise.\nIf we do this again,\nyou'll be able to hear\nme in your right ear.\nIt's not going to be like simulation POV.\nYou're sitting to the right\nof Thomas in the library\nwhile he talks about\nanatomy when you didn't ask.\nAnd does a Toad impression.\nI keep teasing you guys\nabout the Toad impression.\nThis is really fun.\nI will say it one more time,\nbut I am also running the\nsecond channel that we have\ncalled Sketchi, where we\ntalk about drawing animation\nand digital art, all that good stuff.\nWe are running a giveaway\non that channel as well.\nYou can check out the latest\nvideo for more details on that.\nYou'll be able to win a free copy,\na free license for 12 months access to\nClip Studio Paint EX,\nwhich is a very professional\ndrawing and animation program.\nThe one that you're\nwatching me use right now.\nThis isn't my best work.\nI'm not necessarily that\nproud of it, but you know,\nwe made it together, so I like it.\nI've grown very attached to it.\nNo there is a better\nway to do this actually.\nThere's a lot of ways to do this,\nespecially in Clip Studio\nwhere there's like options\nspecifically made to help you color.\nBut I mean, this is how\nI did it when I used\nPhotoshop back in the day.\nSo I'm going to do it.\nI'm going to create a layer\nmask and we can color.\nDo I find it hard to draw on a PC?\nNo, I am using what is\ncalled a drawing tablet.\nAnd so I basically have a pen,\nlike I'm using my screen\nas like a piece of paper,\nfor example, like how you\nwould draw on a piece of paper.\nNo, this is like kind of\nlike a perspective ish\nkind of thing going on, so, you know,\nthere's a few like idiosyncrasies\nabout certain parts\nof the anatomy.\nFor example like this eye,\nI don't know if you can see my cursor,\nbut this eye right here is\nlike smaller than this eye,\nfor example, that's\nbecause it's farther back.\nThis chin might look a little\nlong just because it's like,\nyou're seeing the chin\nand the jaw like equalized\nbecause of the way the angle is.\nA resounding win for a purple hair,\nso that's what we're\ngoing to be adding next.\nPurple hair, I believe it was\nhetero chromia green eyes.\nOne eye will be green, someone\nelse picked the other one.\nName her Lily.\nThat's a pretty cute, pretty good name,\nshe's got a mushroom head.\nShe's got like the little Psy, Psych2Go\nsprout thing on her head.\nOkay.\nWe got not too much time left.\nBut I am determined to at\nleast get some base colors\ndown so that we kind of\nknow what our friend's\ngoing to look like near the end.\nI'm just kind of very\nroughly coloring for now.\nJust so we can get the colors in place.\nBlue eye.\nBlue and green.\nMaybe something a little\nmore contrasting with green.\nLike a red, because Toad is red.\nI'll do the Toad impression\nlike right before.\nActually, I'll just do it now.\nGive me something to say in a Toad voice,\nI've never been asked\nto do the Toad voice.\nI always do it like around\nmy friends unprompted\nand they hate me for it.\nOkay.\nI'm getting a lot of\npeople suggesting amber\nand blue for the other eye color.\nI'm so happy, I was hoping\nyou'd name her Lilly.\nYou legit just made my day.\nI'm glad, have a great day.\nThank you for joining the stream.\nBlack, hi I'm Toad, I\nmessed up her forearm.\nYeah, I'm not, I'm not a\nbig fan of her forearm.\nI mean, what are you going to do, right?\nWe're just drawing for fun, whatever.\nOkay, we got about five\nminutes left in stream.\nUnfortunately.\nIsn't that crazy, isn't\nit crazy how time flies.\nSo I don't typically like\ndrawing characters with like,\nlike bright colored eyes.\nI usually just make them gray or black.\nAnd that's not because it's\nlike easier or anything.\nIt's just cause like, I\ndunno, I just like doing that.\nOkay, this one's green, I\nheard a lot of amber, so.\nAmber is like kind of\nlike yellowish, right?\nThis is Amber, right?\nI dunno.\nI hear people call yellow\nlights, amber lights,\nlike stop sign or what\nare those called, road?\nI'm so good at talking.\nThat was sarcasm.\nAnd here we're gonna...\nDoes Psych2Go like to go do\nthese streams constantly?\nGood question.\nMaybe we can, if you like them.\nI mean, we're just kind\nof doing this just cause\nlike we love you guys and we\nwant to talk to you guys more.\nI mean, if you guys like\nthis specific kind of stream,\nthen I'm totally down to\nhang out with you guys more.\nGet to know you guys.\nI don't know if you guys\nwant to get to know me, but.\nTalk in the Toad voice for\nthe rest of the stream!\nI don't know if you guys\nwill be able to handle that!\nI gotta be honest!\nMario, the Princess is in another castle!\nI don't even know if that's\na good Toad impression,\nbut it's a really\ngrating and annoying one,\nwhich is kind of my goal\nwhen I do impression.\nListen if you guys, if you\nguys hated it, don't worry.\nI kind of hate it too, so I\nwon't do it again, I'm sorry.\nI hope I didn't like actually\nfor real scare anyone.\nFinal thing I need more,\nI just had a heart attack,\nI'm so sorry, final thing.\nTurn on that color.\nWhat's the color of the clothes?\nYes, these streams are so cool.\nThank you.\nYou're cool.\nThank you for tuning in, thank you.\nThank you so much, oh my.\nHalo two, was there a character in Halo\ntalking like that?\nI don't play Halo, so.\nAll right, that pretty\nmuch does it for a time\nin terms of the stream.\nThank you guys so much for tuning in.\nWe're just gonna wait\nfor one last thing for\nthe color of the turtleneck, sage green.\nIt's slightly scary, I'm sorry.\nJump scare, yeah.\nI guess I found a new talent,\nI can jump scare people with my voice.\nBlue, blue, yeah there's not\na lot of blue in this picture,\nso let's make it a nice blue.\nI don't know if there's a nice blue,\nactually I kind of like this kind of blue.\nso I'll make it this.\nAll right, I'm gonna complete\nthis drawing on my own time.\nYou'll see it in the community\npage sometime in the future,\nbut that's pretty much\nall we have time for.\nThank you guys for designing\nthis character with me.\nI'd love to communicate\nwith you guys more.\nCheck me out on the Sketchi channel,\nthe second channel that we have,\nas well remember to check out\nthe giveaway where you can\nwin a free copy of the\nprogram that I've been using\nin this stream.\nRemember to also check out our membership.\nIf that's something you\nmight be interested in,\nyou can gain access to a lot of perks,\nincluding the use of\nPsych2Go exclusive emojis\nand emoticons.\nAnd as always, thank you\nguys so much for your support\nfor the channel, and I can't\nwait to see your guys' art\non the internet.\nOkay, that's pretty much it.\nI'm going to end the stream now.\nBuh-bye, bye!\nByyyye!\nI'm so sorry, I won't do that again."
