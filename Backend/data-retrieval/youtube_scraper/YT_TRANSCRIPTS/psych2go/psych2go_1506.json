    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hi, Psych2Goers, welcome back.\nDepression is a veracious\nunrelenting beast\nthat not only warps your sense of time,\nit also warps your perception\nof the world around you.\nIt's not affecting you alone.\nYour loved ones are also distressed,\nbecause all they see is you\nseemingly trying to disappear\nfor no reason,\nbut how are you supposed to\nkeep your loved ones around\nwhen it's not a one-time thing,\nbut a prolonged issue or episode?\nThen again, it can be hard to\ntell if you're being selfish,\nand you don't want to admit it,\nor if you really are depressed.\nSo let us help you with\nrecognizing signs that,\nhey, it's depression, you're\nnot just being self-centered.\n(soft music)\nNumber one, you constantly withdraw.\nThe withdrawal is both\nphysical and emotional.\nThose who haven't experienced depression\nhave a hard time getting it.\nAnd you may feel like they're\nnot even trying to understand.\nEven though you might've had the tendency\nto withdraw before, this\nwithdrawal is different.\nThe absorption into your\nown thoughts is so intense,\nit feels impossible to be around anyone.\nNumber two, you feel down\ndespite everything else.\nThis isn't a one-time kick the can moment.\nThis is where you can't feel happy,\nbecause it feels like an impossibility.\nYour mind takes the most\nnegative perceptions,\nand grinds them into your face.\nSeeing your loved ones happy\nonly makes you feel like there's\nsomething wrong with you.\nAnd you don't matter, since\nlife goes on for them,\ndespite your absence.\nThat's what you see for yourself.\nWhat they see is that they're\nputting in all this effort,\nbut you're not responding\nin a way they expect you to.\nAnd they may feel like\nyou're just being ungrateful\nand selfish.\nSome may even feel anger or guilt,\nbecause they think you're\ndoing something wrong.\nBut no, and remember\nthat this isn't the case.\nYou might even be able\nto help the situation\nby verbally acknowledging their help.\nThis could help them understand\nthat their efforts aren't unnoticed,\nand it's not their fault\nthat you're not responding.\nNumber three, you overly\njoke, or talk about suicide.\nThoughts of ending it\nmight have been a passing thought before,\nbut now the thoughts are more intense,\ntangible, and frequent.\nSome people may think\nthat suicide is selfish,\nbut thinking about committing suicide\nis not abnormal during depression.\nThere isn't a for sure sign\nof going through with it,\nbecoming preoccupied with these thoughts\ncalled suicidal ideation\nis a red flag though.\nPlease remember that you matter,\nand that help is out there,\nand readily available.\nWe've included a list of suicide hotlines\nat the end of this video.\nSometimes we have to\npick an uncomfortable,\npicking up the phone and\ncalling one of those numbers\nmight be kind of awkward,\nbut not wanting to live is so much worse.\nNumber four, you don't\nremember the before.\nThose around you might have the idea\nthat you're simply taking for granted\nthe good things that have\nhappened to you so far.\nWhat they probably don't\nknow is that depression,\nthat monster, dims and blurs your memory\nof all the good things,\nmaking you think and\nfeel that the good things\nweren't that good, and wouldn't\nbe enough to save you now.\nThis symptom is one of the signs\nthat depression has significantly\ntaken over your life.\nNumber five, you don't care.\nNothing matters.\nFor something or someone to be important,\nor to have meaning, you have to feel.\nUnfortunately, since\nnothing elicits feeling,\nnothing is important.\nThis is anhedonia.\nThe reality is you feel and\nthink everything is meaningless,\nand nothing triggers the happy feeling.\nNothing, not your favorite food,\nnot the refreshed feeling after a shower,\nnot even your favorite hobby, nothing.\nAnd unfortunately,\nothers can only see what's on the outside.\nAnd this can be interpreted as lazy,\nselfish, or self-entitled,\nas in, oh, nothing is\ngood enough for them.\nBut please remember,\nthat's not true at all.\nAnd you deserve to be heard.\nNumber six, you consider your\nfeelings more than others.\nIt's normal to initially\nthink of yourself first,\neven for a millisecond before\nothers, that's just survival.\nBut during a depressive episode, though,\nit's like you're in a constant state\nof being wounded and hurt.\nEven if it's your own mental\nhealth doing it to you,\nthings are pretty raw in there.\nSo if you feel triggered\nby stressful situations,\nsuch as having a dispute\nwith your loved ones,\nit can be more hurtful than normal.\nYour sensitivity meter really tunes in,\nand you become acutely\nprotective with your feelings.\nThis is because your limit\nto receiving pain has been reached,\nand you're just trying\nto prevent a breach.\nAs a result, you unconsciously\npush others away,\neven when you don't mean to.\nDid you relate to these signs?\nOr has this made you think\nof someone close to you,\nand given you a different\nperspective on their behavior?\nPlease comment below.\nIf you found yourself\nrelating with the signs mentioned above,\nor if you think anyone in your life\nis going through something similar,\nknow that this isn't about selfishness.\nIt's from the depression.\nThe fact that depression\nhappens is out of your control,\nbut what you can control is\nrecognizing when it's happening,\nand loving yourself enough\nto take steps in the right direction.\nYour feelings are just\nas valid as anyone else,\nand you are loved nonetheless.\nWe hope you found something\nhelpful in this video,\nand we'll see you next time."
