    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nHow intelligent are you?\nThere are some interesting signs\nthat someone is likely more\nintelligent than others,\nones you may be surprised to hear.\nAccording to the research\nstudies mentioned in this video,\nhaving a messy room or\nbeing a chronic worrier\ncould be subtle signs that\nyou're actually more intelligent\nthan you might presume.\nThere are plenty more unique signs.\nDo you have any of them?\nWatch 'til the end to find out.\nHere are six signs you're\nlikely more intelligent\nthan you think.\nNumber one: You learned to\nread at a very early age.\nHow young were you when\nyou learned to read?\nIn a 2014 study, researchers\nexamined 2,000 pairs\nof identical twins in the UK.\nThe twin that learned to\nread at an earlier age\ntended to perform better on\ntests of cognitive ability.\nAuthors suggest that learning\nhow to read at an earlier age\nimproves the child's verbal\nand nonverbal abilities.\nIn the study, they explain\nthat early remediation\nof reading problems\nmight not only aid in\nthe growth of literacy,\nbut also may improve more\ngeneral cognitive abilities\nthat are of critical\nimportance across the lifespan.\nWho know reading \"Cat in the Hat\" so early\ncould change your life for the better?\nNumber two: You're a musician.\nDo you play a musical instrument\nor maybe you had lessons as a kid?\nWell, it's likely aided you long-term.\nSeveral studies have\nsuggested that music assists\nin the development of children's minds.\nA 2004 study by Glenn Schellenberg\nexamined a group of six-year-olds\nthat took nine months of\nvoice or keyboard lessons\nand compared them to groups\nthat took drama lessons\nor no lessons at all.\nAccording to the study, they found that\ncompared with children\nin the control groups,\nchildren in the music groups exhibited\ngreater increases in full-scale IQ.\nAnother study published in 2011,\nfound that even music lessons\nin a short amount of time\ncan improve verbal intelligence\nin children four to six\nas compared with children who participated\nin a program for visual art.\nThe study states that after\nonly 20 days of training,\nonly children in the music group\nexhibited enhanced performance\non a measure of verbal intelligence,\nwith 90% of the sample\nshowing this improvement.\nThese improvements in verbal intelligence\nwere positively correlated\nwith changes in functional\nbrain plasticity\nduring an executive function task.\nOur findings demonstrate that transfer\nof a high-level cognitive skill\nis possible in early childhood.\nAccording to statistics, only\na small percentage of you\nwho watch our videos\nare actually subscribed.\nSo, if you haven't and\nat the

three: You worry often.\nDo you worry (pausing) a lot?\nIn a 2015 study, researchers\nhad 126 undergraduate students\ncomplete questionnaires\nindicating how much they worried,\nruminated on worrying thoughts\nand thoughts about\nscenarios that upset them.\nWhat did they find?\nWell, students who often\nspent time worrying\nand ruminating on\nthoughts held a high score\nin measures of verbal intelligence.\nThose who didn't worry as much\nscored higher in nonverbal intelligence.\nNumber four: You wear eyeglasses.\nAre you wearing glasses right now?\nWell, you may just be more\nintelligent than you think.\nAccording to a 2018 study from\nthe University of Edinburgh,\nif you're smart, you're more likely\nto have bad eyesight genes.\nYeah, if you're intelligent,\nyou're 30% more likely to\nhave those bad eyesight genes.\nSo, if you do, it means you'll\nlikely need to be wearing\na pair of glasses as you're watching this;\nwell, depending on how\nclose you are to the screen.\nAre you near-sighted or far-sighted?\nNumber five: You enjoy being\nalone more than socializing.\nAre you an introvert?\nDo you favor the days where\nyou get to spend the evening\nin pleasant solitude alone in your room?\nWell, you're likely one smart cookie.\nResearchers Norman P.\nLi and Satoshi Kanazawa\nhad 15,000 individuals 18 to\n28 take a survey and IQ test.\nThe individuals who\nwere highly intelligent\nwere found to be not as\nhappy with their lives\nthe more frequently they socialized.\nThe study states, importantly,\nthe main associations of life satisfaction\nwith population density and\nsocialization with friends\nsignificantly interact with intelligence.\nAnd in the latter case, the\nmain association is reversed\namong the extremely intelligent.\nMore intelligent individuals experience\nlower life satisfaction\nwith more frequent\nsocialization with friends.\nAnd number six: You're messy.\nAre you messy?\nHow messy?\nDo clothes lie scattered about your floor?\nDust across your countertops?\nAccording to a 2013 study from\nthe University of Minnesota,\nsubjects had to come up with\nsome unconventional uses\nfor a ping pong ball.\nThe ones with the messier rooms\nhad the most creative ideas,\nwhile those who were neat\nwere not as creative in their responses.\nSo, are you smarter than you think?\nTell us in the comments\nsection down below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this
