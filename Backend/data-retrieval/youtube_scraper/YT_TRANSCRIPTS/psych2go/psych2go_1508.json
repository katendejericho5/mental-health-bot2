    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you struggle to build\ndeeper connections with others?\nAre you looking for ways to connect\nwith people beyond the surface level?\nToday's video is sponsored by So Syncd,\na place that can match\npartners' personality types\nbased on the 16 personalities model.\nYou can access it by\nclicking the link below.\nHey, Psych2Goers, welcome\nback to another video.\nDo you feel that your\npersonality type is INFJ?\nThe INFJ personality type stands\nfor introversion, intuition,\nfeeling, and judging.\nIt's the rarest personality type,\nand makes up only 1% of\nthe total population.\nBecause of this, INFJs usually feel\nlike they're misunderstood\nby other personality types.\nTherefore, this video will\nbe addressing six things\nonly INFJs understand.\nNumber one, INFJs always care.\nDo you find that you always care\nabout those around you who need help?\nYou will always care for people\nto the point where you're willing\nto risk your own wellbeing in the process\nbecause of INFJ's strong sense\nof personal integrity\nand drive to help others.\nAs such, you will frequently find yourself\nin situations where you choose\nto help others while\nsacrificing or neglecting\nsomething that you want to do.\nThis will make you someone\nthat is extremely valued by others.\nHowever, people may take advantage\nof this personality trait\nand make you sacrifice yourself\nto satisfy their needs and wants.\nNumber two, feeling lonely in a group.\nDo you feel lonelier when\nyou're with other people\nthan when you're by yourself?\nThis may sound contradictory,\nbut it's one of the things\nthat only INFJs will understand.\nOf course, it's important\nto understand the difference\nbetween lonely and alone.\nINFJs are known to be extremely intuitive\nand comfortable when they're alone,\nbecause they're constantly\nself-reflecting.\nHowever, the same intuitive ability\nis what can make you\nconstantly feel misunderstood,\nespecially if you yourself cannot explain\nhow you know something.\nThis feeling of being\nmisunderstood all the time,\nwhen you're with a group of people\nis what makes you feel lonely in a group.\nNumber three, self-sabotage.\nDo you have the tendency\nto overthink things so much\nthat you end up spoiling a happy moment?\nINFJs have the tendency\nto always dig deep past the\nsurface level of things.\nThis tendency can ruin happy moments\nfor you, since you'll often think\nthat for every good thing,\nthere should be something bad.\nThis train of thought\nwill eventually lead you\nto put down your own\nsuccess and accomplishments.\nAnd the worst thing is\nthat even the simplest\nand most innocent thoughts\ncan spiral out of control,\nand become a huge obstacle\nin the way of your happiness.\nWe talked about the importance\nof your potential partner\nbeing attentive and\nremembering the little things,\nwhich is why so So Syncd could\nbe the right app for you.\nThey pair couples who\nhave the right amount\nof similarities to get each other,\nand just the right amount of differences\nto create that spark for\ndeeper, meaningful dating.\nUpon taking the personality test,\nyou discover your\npersonality, such as INFJ.\nSo thoughtful.\nOr ENFP, so curious.\nOnce you've mutually liked each other,\nyou can start messaging.\nHere are what some people\nusing the app have said.\nLily, INFJ, said, \"I didn't\nexpect to find love so fast.\nOur personality types will\nbe tattooed on me somewhere.\"\nAnd Indy, ENFJ, said, \"Matching people\nusing personality types is such\na simple and powerful concept.\nSo Syncd helped us find love,\neven in this difficult time.\nYou've really changed our lives.\nIn fact, we're now married.\nThank you.\"\nMake sure you check out the app\nin the description box\nbelow for more details.\nWe encourage you to try it out\nand give yourself a chance\nto find deeper love.\nNumber four, easily getting\nemotionally drained by others.\nHow often do other people's feelings\nor emotions affect you.\nBecause of your keen\nintuition and inner senses,\nyou will often be very quick to pick up\non the emotions and feelings of others,\nand end up adopting\nthese emotions yourself.\nThis personality trait makes you\nas an INFJ a very powerful\ncounselor and advocate,\nsince you can easily understand\nand empathize with what\nother people are thinking.\nAt the same time, though,\nthis can be emotionally draining for you,\nbecause of the huge amount\nof emotional stimulus you are processing,\nespecially when you're hosting\nstrong, contrasting emotions.\nNumber five, rarely opening up\nor feeling like you've revealed too much.\nHow often do you express your\nfeelings to other people?\nWell, due to the introvert trait\nthat many INFJ types have,\nyou tend to be very reserved when it comes\nto expressing your opinions and feelings.\nAdditionally, you're used to being\nthe one helping others out,\nso you try not to look vulnerable.\nRather than opening up,\nwhenever you feel anger or frustration,\nyou prefer to retreat from social contact\nand solve everything by yourself.\nHowever, once someone gets you to open up,\nyou will suddenly feel like\nsaying everything going\non in your mind and end up apologizing,\nbecause you think that\nyou're burdening them\nwith your problems.\nAnd number six, inner guilt.\nDo you constantly go over a situation\nwhere you think you could\nhave said something different?\nThis is most likely due\nto the inner guilt that you\nas an INFJ constantly feel.\nWhen you send a message to your friends,\nyour mind automatically makes you think\nthat you're somehow bothering them.\nOr when you do something\nthat you wanted to do,\nyou might start feeling guilty\nbecause it meant that you didn't\ndo something others wanted you to do.\nEven a brief conversation\ncan leave you wondering\nif what you said was right.\nWhatever the situation is,\nthere's always something\nin your mind that makes you feel guilty.\nDid you relate to and\nunderstand these signs?\nIf you are an INFJ,\nyou might constantly feel\nlonely and misunderstood\nbecause there aren't many others\nthat can relate to these\nthoughts and feelings.\nBut remember that you aren't alone.\nThere's likely someone out there\nthat can relate to the same struggles.\nIf you found this video\nhelpful or saw yourself\nin these signs,\nplease let us know in the comments below.\nLike and share it with friends\nthat might find this valuable too.\nRemember to subscribe to Psych2Go,\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the references used are added\nin the description box below.\nThanks so much for watching,\nand
