haven't, and\nat the end of the video\nyou enjoy what you see,\ndo consider subscribing.\nIt would help a lot\nwith YouTube's algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content.\nThanks for being here.\nDo you have a crash?\nMaybe you've been thinking\nabout how you can express\nyour feelings for them\nwithout scaring them away.\nFor many, telling someone\nyou like how you really feel\ncan be a daunting experience.\nWhere do you begin?\nWell, we have some tips to help you.\nHere's how to show your\ncrush that you liked them\nwithout scaring them away.\nNumber one, spend time around them.\nYa don't say?\nWell, before you tell\nyour crush how you feel,\nthey need to know you exist first.\nIf you already know them\npretty well, even better.\nAccording to a 2011\nresearch study published\nin the Journal of Personality\nand Social Psychology,\nfamiliarity with someone\nencourages attraction\nin a live interaction.\nTwo experiments were reported in the study\nusing a live interaction paradigm\nwhere two same-sex strangers\ninteracted with each other\nfor different amounts of time.\nThe researchers findings supported\nthe previously suggested theory\nthat familiarity leads to attraction.\nAccording to the study, the\nmore participants interacted,\nthe more attracted they\nwere to each other.\nThe mediation analysis\nidentified three processes\nthat contribute to this effect.\nPerceived responsiveness,\nincreased comfort\nand satisfaction during the interaction,\nand perceived knowledge.\nSo try spending a bit\nmore time with your crush.\nEven just sitting by them\nduring class or lunch\ncould possibly make them feel\nmore comfortable around you.\nIf they welcome you, it may\neven cue them into the idea\nthat you like them.\nNumber two, throw in a few flirty hints.\nNow that they're a bit more\ncomfortable with your presence\nas a possible friend, try\nthrowing in some hints\nthat you have feelings for them.\nMake good eye contact.\nSmile at them.\nGive them a natural compliment.\nPerhaps throw in a bit of playful teasing\nwith some flirting.\nIf you're still a bit shy\nwhen it comes to flirting in person,\ntry sending them a flirty text.\nNumber three, go out of\nyour way to talk to them.\nIf you wanna show them\nyou care about them,\nyou have to make an effort\nto reach out to them.\nIf they notice you go out\nof your way to talk to them\nat a party, lunch, work,\nor other social gatherings,\nthey may just realize you have feelings,\nespecially for them.\nYou could even text them questions\nspecific to their\npersonality and well-being\nto show you care.\nDoing this often with a bit of flirting,\nwill set you apart from\njust being interested\nin them as friends.\nThey may even start to think,\nwhy do they especially wanna talk to me?\nDo they like me?\nJust remember to throw in a\nfew flirty hints now and then.\nSo they know you wanna be\nmore than just good friends.\nAlso, remember to pay attention\nto their body language.\nAre they welcoming your conversations?\nAre they comfortable?\nDo they continue the discussion and texts?\nNumber four, create a\ndeadline for yourself.\nSo, you've been giving them hints,\nspending time with them,\nand have continued the\ngreat conversations.\nNow you have to tell them, right?\nTelling your crush you like\nthem can seem intimidating.\nSo you may just avoid doing so.\nBefore you know it,\nthe school year is over\nor they've relocated to a new\nworkplace with a new position.\nA good idea may be to\ngive yourself a deadline\nfor when you'll tell\nthem your true feelings.\nSo if flirting has been going well\nset a deadline for a week or two away.\nOr maybe just a few days later\nif things are progressing smoothly.\nYou don't wanna overthink things\nand talk yourself out of letting them know\nhow you really feel.\nAfter all, ask yourself,\nhow would I feel if I never\ntold them I liked them?\nWould I regret it?\nNumber five, let them know how you feel.\nThe time has come, my friend.\nStand up tall, attempt some confidence,\nand let out the feels.\nIt might be a good idea\nto reveal your feelings\nin a casual way first and plan\nwhat you'll say in advance.\nIf you're unsure how they feel about you\nand you don't wanna surprise\nthem too much, try saying,\nI think I have feelings for you.\nOr express how much you\nenjoy spending time with them\nand that you wanna continue\nspending more time with them.\nPossibly on a date.\nThis will give your\ncrush a moment to think\nabout how they feel about\nyou in a romantic way.\nInstead of declaring a statement\nthat can seem to demand\na certain answer right away.\nNumber six, have a purpose\nwhen you do tell them.\nOkay, so let's say you tell them.\nOkay, now what?\n(tape scratching)\nI mean, what if your crush\nis unsure of how they feel\nand need some time?\nOr maybe they're unsure of what to say.\nTo avoid an awkward moment\nof silence, have a purpose\nwhen you tell them.\nThis could mean asking them on a date\nwhen you express your feelings for them.\nOr asking them to that movie\nor your favorite bands concert\nyou have an extra ticket for.\nThis will make it easier for them\nto express their feelings as well.\nThey may politely\ndecline your date request\nif they're not interested.\nLess awkward than an\nimminent silence, right?\nOr perhaps they're busy that week.\nBut if they like you back,\nthey might express that another\ntime works well for them.\nOr maybe, just maybe,\nthey'll jump at the chance\nto go on a date with you.\nHopefully, they like your favorite band\nas much as they like you.\nSo will you follow these steps?\nHow will you tell your\ncrush that you like them?\nShare your stories in the\ncomments section down below\nand remember to respect\nyour crushes feelings\nif they don't feel the same way.\nJust because someone doesn't\nshare the same feelings\ndoesn't mean you're worth any less.\nWe're all lovable people\nand the right person\nmay be out there\nsomewhere waiting for you.\nMaybe at your favorite bands concert.\nHey, you never know.\nThey may just be a bigger fan than you.\nCue the romance music.\nIf you enjoyed this video,\ndon't forget to click the\nlike button and share it\nwith someone who might enjoy.\nPerhaps your crush.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification
