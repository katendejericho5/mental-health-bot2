    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hello,\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nMika Beki requested a video on this topic,\nso here it is.\nWhat does happiness mean to you?\nFor some, happiness means\nachieving their goals,\nor becoming wildly successful\nin a certain career.\nHowever, happiness is complicated,\nand can be found in small,\noften overlooked ways.\nFinding these minuscule boosts\ncan help you in the short term\non your journey to a much larger goal.\nWith that said,\nhere are six small things\nguaranteed to brighten your day,\neven just by a little.\nNumber one, get some hugs.\nHugs are a popular form of\ncommunicating love and trust.\nHowever, they serve more than\njust saying, I care for you.\nHugging serves to reinforce\nbonds between two people\nvia the secretion of oxytocin,\nwhich is one of the\nthree happiness hormones,\nalong with dopamine and endorphins.\nOxytocin also has other benefits,\nlowering blood pressure,\nand reducing the stress hormone cortisol.\nIf hugging is not your thing,\nthere are other ways to\nboost your oxytocin levels,\nsuch as playing with your\npet, or getting a massage.\nNumber two, help others out.\nHave you ever experienced\nthat warm, fuzzy feeling\nafter you've done something\nnice for a person?\nOxytocin is not only\nreleased when you hug.\nIt's also released when you\ndo something kind for someone.\nThe great thing about it\nis that it's contagious.\nNot only do you get a surge of oxytocin\nwhenever you do something kind,\nbut so does the person\non the receiving end.\nA 2009 study published the\nresults of an experiment\ndesigned to measure the correlation\nbetween acts of kindness\nand life satisfaction.\nThey found that participants\nwho practiced random acts of kindness\nreported higher levels\nof life satisfaction.\nActs of kindness do not need to be large.\nBeing kind can be as simple as\nholding the door for someone,\ndonating clothes,\nor saying thank you when\nyou get your food order.\nNumber three, get some sun.\nSummer is finally here,\nwhich means that sun bathing\nmight help you feel a bit happier.\nVitamin D plays a role in the synthesis\nand creation of serotonin,\nanother happiness hormone.\nA 2018 study concluded that\nan increase in vitamin D\nhelped maintain the concentration\nof extra cellular fluid\nserotonin in the brain.\nThis was shown to improve\nneuropsychiatric disorders\nlike depression.\nSo get out there, just\ndon't forget your sunscreen.\nNumber four, laugh out loud.\nHave you ever been in a bad mood,\nbut had that one silly\nfriend make it all better?\nLaughing is another great way\nto increase your happiness.\nIt not only involves your\nface, but also your whole body.\nThe most interesting thing that happens\nis that your pain tolerance goes up.\nThis is due to a spike in endorphins,\nanother happiness hormone,\ncommonly released during exercise.\nLaughter is miraculous in the sense\nthat you also get a dose of\ndopamine whenever you laugh.\nDopamine is the reward hormone.\nWhen we laugh, dopamine\ncreates a euphoric feeling,\nwhich encourages us to\nlaugh again and again.\nAnd number five, go out and exercise.\nAnother great way to make\nyourself feel happier\nis through exercise.\nNot only does it increase\nyour level of endorphins,\nbut it also increases your dopamine.\nBoth help reduce cortisol,\nand allow you to feel more at ease,\nwhich can consequently\nmake you feel better.\nThis doesn't need to be a huge workout.\nAs something as short as a 20 minute walk\ncan make a difference in your mood.\nIf you're suffering from an injury,\nsome other great options\nare yoga or meditation,\nsince these two activities\nalso increase your dopamine levels.\nFinding small moments of\nhappiness in your life\ndoes not have to be difficult.\nEven the little things\ncan brighten your day,\neven if it's just a tiny amount.\nPlease note that none of these strategies\nare a replacement for psychiatric help.\nReach out to a qualified\nmental health professional\nif you feel that you have a condition.\nLeave a comment below letting us know\nwhat other things make you feel happy.\nDon't forget to subscribe,\nand hit the notification\nbell for more reminders\non our next uploads.\nThanks for watching, and take care."
