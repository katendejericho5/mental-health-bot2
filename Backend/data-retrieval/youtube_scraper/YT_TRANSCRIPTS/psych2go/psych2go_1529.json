    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWe're gonna jump right\ninto the deep end here.\nDo you feel like life's\nnot worth living anymore?\nAre you at your tipping\npoint every day? (sighs)\nLife may be hard right\nnow, maybe even unbearable.\nYou may be experiencing trouble at school,\nat home, with your family\nor among your friends.\nMaybe someone close to you betrayed you,\nor you feel letdown by\nyour lack of progress\ndespite how much effort you've spent.\nThe struggles of everyday life\ncan be all too demanding at times.\nSo this is an open letter to those\nwho have lost all hope in life.\nSo you may not feel\nlike it, but know this.\nYou're not alone, no matter\nwhat you're going through.\nIt's possible to find happiness again.\nIt might not, matter of fact,\nit probably won't be easy,\nand you'll probably experience\nfailures and want to give up.\nBut keep trying.\nYou're strong.\nDidn't get out of bed early today?\nIt's okay.\nGo easy on yourself\nand try again tomorrow.\nDidn't pass the entrance\nexam at your dream university\nor get the dream job you've\nbeen eyeing since forever?\nYou're allowed to feel gloomy\nbecause rejection stings.\nBut know that you're always\nallowed to rise above it.\nLife is actually never about the outcomes.\nFor example, remember what\nit's like having a crush?\nIt was fun daydreaming about\nthem every now and then,\nbut it can be devastating when you confess\nand realize they don't feel the same way.\nSome of you may move on quickly,\nbut some may take a little\nwhile longer to heal.\nYou may even feel hopeless\nto ever find someone again.\nBut try to remember that\nit's not your fault.\nWhen you're too attached to the results,\nyou set yourself up for disappointment\nwhen you don't get it.\nAnd let's face it,\nthere's no way that life will\nhand its best gifts to you\nall the time.\nThere's gonna be detours, road bumps,\nand stop signs along the journey.\nBut once you realize that\nyou can't control the things\noutside of your control,\nand you can only control how\nyou respond to these things,\nyou can then start to\nfeel a little lighter\nand a little happier.\nYou may not notice it much at the start,\nbut you will find it eventually.\nThe person you had a crush\non may be unreachable now,\nbut that doesn't mean you can't\nfind someone else who isn't.\nThat job or school you've\nalways wanted to join\nmay not be accepting you at the moment,\nbut there's always the next one.\nAnd if not, then the next one after that.\nWhenever it feels like the\nworld is weighing you down,\nplease remember you're not alone.\nThere's always hope at\nthe end of the tunnel.\nThe pain and listlessness\nyou're feeling now\nwill eventually fade,\nand you'll grow from the experience.\nMaybe not the way you once intended,\nbut in a way that pushes you forward.\nAnd once you feel like\nyou're slowly picking up the pieces again,\nwhich you will,\nyou'll look back and thank yourself\nfor putting in the consistent daily effort\nto become a better person\nand for rising above your\nmind's traitorous beliefs\nand hopelessness.\nSo, what should you do to\nmake your future self happy?\nFind your larger purpose.\nRealize you're not alone in your journey.\nReach out to your friends for support,\nand work towards your goal day by day.\nEach step is hard.\nIt might even feel impossible,\nbut we hope you at least try.\nYou may fail, but try again.\nFight for yourself.\nHowever tiresome it becomes,\nnever let yourself succumb to despair.\nThen after time,\nyour spark will eventually return.\nMaybe in a way that differs\nfrom your expectations\nbut it will,\nand a new you will emerge,\nhappier, healthier, and wiser.\nAllow yourself to rest,\nbut never stop fighting.\n(exhales) Did you find this video helpful?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nAlso be sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video with those\nwho might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references and studies\nused in this video are added\nin the description box below.\nThanks so much for watching\nand we will see you next time."
