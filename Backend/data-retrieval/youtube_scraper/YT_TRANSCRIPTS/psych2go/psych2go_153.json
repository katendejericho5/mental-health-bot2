    "transcript": "considered to be the founder of the\npsychodynamic approach to psychology\nSigman Freud was an Austrian neurologist\nwho's most famous for creating and\ndeveloping the technique of\npsychoanalysis psychoanalysis is a set\nof theories and therapeutic techniques\nused with the goal to release repressed\nemotions and memories which can lead to\ncatharsis and healing the aim of\npsychoanalysis is to bring what lies\ndeep in one's unconscious or\nsubconscious mind to their level of\nConsciousness but what exactly are these\nlevels of consciousness Sigman Freud\ndivided human consciousness into three\nlevels conscious preconscious and\nunconscious Freud's interest in the\nunconscious mind was brought on by an\nexperience his teacher Joseph BR had\nwith a patient the patient known as Anna\no suffered from Hysteria a condition in\nwhich the patient can exhibit physical\nsymptoms such as paralysis convulsions\nhallucinations selective Amnesia and\nloss of speech all with no apparent\nphysical cause Burr was successful in\ntrading Anna by using a form of talk\ntherapy to help her recall traumatic\nevents and unwanted memories in his\ndiscussions BR found that she had\ndeveloped a fear of drinking when a dog\nshe despised drank from her glass other\nsymptoms were brought on when she cared\nfor her sick father the point of Anna\nO's case being once she had a chance to\nEXP bre and bring out these unconscious\nthoughts to a conscious level her\nparalysis\ndisappeared because of his sessions with\nAnna o BR developed the talking cure and\nlaid the foundation for psycho analysis\nwhich his Protege Freud would later\ndevelop ultimately br's discussion with\nFreud about the case sparked an interest\nin Freud all which led to his proposal\nthat physical symptoms are often the\nouter manifestation of deeply repressed\nconflicts in his book studies in\nhysteria conflicts which can lie within\na level of our Consciousness this would\nlead him to his psychoanalytic theories\nin his proposal that there are three\nlevels of the Mind Freud developed a\ntopographical model of the mind having\nan iceberg represent the mind and its\nthree levels of consciousness the\nconscious the surface and tip of the\niceberg is consciousness these are our\nthoughts and feelings that have our\nattention and focus this level of the\nMind includes what we are aware of and\nwhat we can easily bring to our aware\nWess this is the mental activity we\nconsciously know about and only makes up\na tiny portion of our mind the\npreconscious the preconscious part of\nour mind or for the old term\nsubconscious is where we can recall and\nretrieve information from our memories\nwe are not currently aware of these\nthoughts but we can easily bring them to\nConsciousness thoughts and feelings wait\nhere lying just beneath the surface of\nConsciousness until they succeed in\nattracting the eye of the conscious as\nFreud describes this is where our\navailable memory resides preconscious\nthoughts are ones which are not\nrepressed and are easily capable of\nbecoming conscious the unconscious the\ndeepest level and largest portion of the\nMind according to Freud's topographical\nsystem is the\nunconscious this region holds the\nthoughts feelings desires urges hopes\nand wishes whether we realize it or not\nour Behavior feelings and motives are\nall influenced by our\nunconscious we may hold past experiences\nand unwanted memories in our unconscious\nthe real cause of our behavior is from\nthe processes that reside in our\nunconscious level the unconscious level\nis represented as the part of the\niceberg you can't see the largest and\nmost important part of the iceberg Lies\nBeneath the surface unconscious\nphenomena can include repressed feelings\nautomatic skills automatic reactions and\nsubliminal perceptions as suggested by\nempirical evidence hidden phobias\ndesires and complexes are also believed\nto be a part of this as well thoughts\nand feelings from our unconscious have a\nway of showing themselves to us Freud\nbelieved unconscious processes\nrepresented themselves in dreams which\nis why therapists with psychoanalysis\ntraining help patients analyze their\ndreams as a part of treatment this is\nall in hopes that they can bring\nsuppressed memories to their\nConsciousness often in hopes of a\ncathartic release another way way the\nunconscious part of the Mind represents\nitself is through jokes or through a\nFreudian slip named after Freud himself\na Freudian slip is when one's\nunconscious feelings present themselves\nthrough an error in speech Freud once\ngave an example of this slip of the\ntongue pointing to a British member of\nparliament's subtle mistake instead of\nreferring to his colleague with whom he\nwas irritated with as The Honorable\nmember from Hull the British Member of\nParliament referred to him as The\nHonorable member from hell Freud found\nthat many of his patients often\nrepressed traumatic events painful\nmemories or shameful desires as they\nwere too difficult to confront many of\nus turned to defense mechanisms to avoid\nknowing the truth of what they're\nfeeling as it can be difficult to\nconfront these feelings and memories can\ninstead get locked away inside our\nunconscious mind secretly governing our\nBehavior more than we think but the goal\nof psychoanalysis lies within\nconfronting the pain that holds us back\nto make the unconscious conscious so\nwhat do you think of psychoanalytic\ntheory and the unconscious mind What\nfeelings could you be secretly hiding\nhave you ever had a frean slip you bet\nwe want to know what it is let us know\nyour unconscious thoughts in the comment\nsection
