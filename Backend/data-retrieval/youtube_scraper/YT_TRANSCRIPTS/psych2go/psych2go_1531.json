not subscribed yet\nand you enjoy what you see,\ndo consider hitting the subscribe button.\nThis encourages YouTube algorithm\nand promoting more of\nour mental health content\nto more people out there.\nHave you ever wondered\nif you're attractive?\nIf you've ever brought up the subject\nto your closest friends,\nmaybe they've reassured you\ninsisting you are good-looking,\nbut yet, you can't see what they do.\n(upbeat music)\nAnd how do you know if\nthey're just being nice?\nIn your mind your flaws\nstand out too much.\nSo how can you tell if you are attractive,\neven if you don't see yourself as so?\nHere are six signs you\nreally are attractive\neven if you don't think you are.\nNumber one, when you look\nat photos of yourself\nfrom months ago as compared to now,\nyou think you looked better then.\nHave you ever browsed\nthrough your social media\nonly to stumble upon a month's old photo\nof yourself with friends?\nYou do a double-take because\nyou surprisingly look better\nthan you thought you did at the time.\n\"I don't look that bad at all,\" you think,\nbut then that photo from yesterday,\nyou can't help, but scrutinize.\nA 2010 study by psychologist,\nTal Eyal and behavioral\nscientists, Nicholas Epley\nfound that with due time,\none is likely to see\nthemselves more abstractly,\nsimilar to how others\nmight view their looks.\nResearchers had photos\ntaken of participants\nand then asked them to rate their looks\nbased on how others might rate them.\nSome of the subjects were told their photo\nwould be rated by others the same day,\nwhile others were told the photographs\nwould be rated months later.\nThose who were told their photos\nwould be rated months later\nwere more accurate in how\nothers perceived them.\nThis could be due to the idea\nthat they've imagined\nenough time between them\nand the harsh judgments\nthey felt about themselves\nwhile taking the photo.\nThose harsh scrutinies\ndon't seem that important\nmonths down the line, right?\nSo this can be a small\nway to gain some insight\ninto how attractive you are to others.\nLook at a photo from months\nago and one from now,\nare you less critical of yourself\non judging the older photo?\nEyal and Epley's explanation is that\nyou're a better judge of\nhow attractive you are\nwhen enough time has passed\nfrom when the photo was taken.\nNumber two, some people seem nervous\nor different around you.\nWhen you find someone good-looking,\ndo you often get nervous?\nOr maybe you have a loss of words\nand are in awe of how attractive they are.\nWhile this might happen to others\nif they think you're attractive as well.\nThey may even act awkward around you\nbecause your beauty makes them nervous.\nIf you notice they act awkward\nor different around you\nas compared to others,\nthey may just like you.\nHave you ever been\nfrustrated that your dinner\nis taking too long to make\nand you turn into a Hangry T-Rex?\nDo you want diversity\nin your meal choices?\nI didn't realize how much\ntime I was spending on cooking\nuntil I tried HelloFresh\nour sponsor for this video\nand the number one meal-kit in America.\nWith all of the time saved making dinner,\nwe're able to dedicate more\ntime on important things,\nsuch as making new videos for you guys.\nWith their quick and easy options,\ndinner can be made and be put on the table\nall in 20 minutes or less.\nDon't worry about anything\ngoing to waste either.\nAll ingredients are preportioned,\nwhich means less work,\nless food waste, and you\neat more sustainably.\nMost importantly, HelloFresh\noffers a weekly variety\nof recipes dedicated to healthy living,\nincluding low-cal, carb-smart,\nvegetarian and pescetarian options.\nLet's see Sy cook.\nFirst, we cut the mushrooms\ninto quarters and roast them.\nThen we cook the pork and the\nlinguine at the same time,\nbut make sure to stir the\npasta occasionally till tender,\nmake the cream sauce, add\nsome sliced sage, Dijon,\nand most importantly, season\nit with some salt and pepper\nand combine the things together.\nAnd tada!\nDinner is served.\nWho did it better, me, or Sy?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nGo to hellofresh.com and\nuse the code Psych2Go14,\nto get 14 free meals plus free shipping.\nNumber three, you receive a lot\nof messages on social media.\nYou just posted that selfie\nof yourself on social media\nand now the floodgates have opened\nto random friend requests\nand flirty messages.\nWho are these people?\nAnd why are they messaging\nyou out of nowhere?\nOdds are others find you very attractive\nbased on your latest social media posts\nand some can't help but\nmessage you in hopes\nyou'll like them back.\nNumber four, you catch\nthem staring at you.\nDo you find other staring at you?\nMaybe you think there's\nsomething on your teeth\nor maybe a bug landed on your face.\nYou're thinking of all kinds of scenarios,\nbut maybe they just\nthink you're attractive.\nThink about it.\nWhen we find someone beautiful\nall we wanna do is catch\nanother quick glance at them.\nAnd perhaps that look\nbecomes an awkward stare.\nSo rest assured there's\nlikely nothing in your teeth.\nTheir eyes are simply gazing\nat your eyes, not your mouth,\nor maybe they're looking\nat your mouth too.\nAnd number five,\nyou don't get many compliments\nwhen you expect them.\nSome people simply don't\ncompliment that new acquaintance\nthey find most attractive simply\nbecause they assume they know.\nSome may feel like they might not want\nthe extra attention and\nthat too many compliments\nmay come off as annoying.\nBut if everyone assumes\nthat you're overly used to compliments,\nthey might not give them.\nJust because you don't\nreceive a compliment\ndoes not mean you're not attractive.\nSo do you think you're attractive?\nWill you be scrolling through\nold photos of yourself\nto see how you feel about them now?\nLet us know in the comments down below.\nRemember, even if you don't think\nyou're the most attractive\nperson in the room,\nthe familiar phrase,\nbeauty is in the eye of the beholder,\nrings true every time.\nSo behold, not only what's\ngreat about you on the outside,\nbut the inside as well,\nsome pretty attractive traits\nyou've been hiding, huh?\nIf you enjoyed this video,\ndon't forget to click the like
