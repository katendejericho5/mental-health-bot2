keep up with yourself?\nFor high achievers burnout is\none of the speed bumps in life\nthat you should be wary of.\nBurnout is a term coined by psychologist,\nHerbert Freudenberger in the 1970s,\nand is described as a\nsevere stress condition\nthat leads to severe physical,\nmental, and emotional exhaustion.\nTo help better understand this condition,\nin this video we'll be looking at\nseven signs you're dealing with burnout.\nNumber one, you are emotionally exhausted.\nHave you ever felt that\nyou're at your limit,\nthat it's extremely\nhard to keep on working\neven in small amounts?\nAccording to Scott and Ganz, in 2020,\nburnout can lead to lethargic feelings,\nan inability to cope with stress,\nand an overall feeling that\nyou are emotionally drained.\nWhen you're emotionally\nexhausted you may feel powerless\nand have no control over\nwhat happens in your life.\nYou may feel that you're\nstuck in a situation\nand have little energy to\nkeep going, or get out of it.\nNumber two, you are isolated from others.\nHave you noticed that you're\nturning down invitations\nto events that you'd\nnormally be excited about,\nor perhaps you're not returning messages\nas quickly as you normally would.\nThis can be a sign of burnout.\nDr. Carter in 2013 states\nthat in the early stages of burnout\nyou might isolate yourself more\nand find social interactions\nare more difficult.\nYou might find that\npeople get on your nerves\nmore than usual,\nand that you find ways to\navoid interacting with others\nat work or school.\nNumber three, you have escape fantasies.\nWhen you're at work or school,\ndo you find yourself wishing\nthat you were somewhere else,\npreferably away from\nyour job or schoolwork?\nDealing with high amounts of stress\nfor an extended period of time\ncan make it hard to concentrate\non the task at hand.\nIt can be easier and more fun\nto think about going on vacation,\nor even going back to bed.\nAt worst, some people dealing with burnout\nmay desire drugs or alcohol\nto escape their negative feelings,\nwhich can lead to abuse issues.\nIn any case,\ndoing anything else can seem\nmore exciting than working.\nNumber four, your\nperformance is suffering.\nDealing with burnout\ncan also affect the quality of your work.\nDo you find that you're letting mistakes\nslip through the cracks\nmore so than normal?\nIs it hard to care if\nsomething is perfect or not?\nIs it hard just to start\nsomething, let alone finish it?\nHaving stresses in your life\nlike taking care of an ill family member\nor working long hours,\ncan make it hard to put a\nlot of effort into your work.\nWhen you have little time for self-care\nor to focus on other things,\nit can make it harder over time\nto keep up with your usual performance.\nSimilar to how athletes\nneed to rest after practice\nyou need to rest as well, to recuperate.\nNumber five, you don't feel well.\nHave you ever wondered\nwhy you still feel tired\ndespite sleeping well or having a day off?\nDo you experience stomach problems\nor other types of unexplained pain?\nHave you noticed that you\nseem to get sick more often\nthan before?\nDealing with high amounts of stress\ncan weaken your immune system,\nso it's easier to get sick.\nAdditionally,\nstress can affect other\naspects of your physical health\ncausing you to feel pain and tiredness\nthat can't be explained by anything else,\nFraga & Leg, in 2019,\nstated that burnout\ncan deplete your energy\nand in turn weaken your immune system,\nmaking you more susceptible to infection.\nApart from that,\nburnout can increase feelings\nof depression and anxiety,\nalong with other mental health issues.\nAs burnout progresses,\nsmall stressors may become\nmuch bigger problems\nand affect your ability to perform.\nNumber six, you're more pessimistic.\nBurnout may lead to a pessimistic attitude\nin which you may adopt a\nglass half-empty mindset.\nAre you finding yourself\nfeeling more down on the world?\nDo you find it harder and\nharder to stay positive?\nOne may be so engrossed\nwith negative thinking\nthat at its later stages,\nthe pessimism may advance\nbeyond how you feel about yourself,\ncausing you to mistrust\npeople that are close to you.\nYou may feel that you can't\ncount on anyone, even yourself.\nAnd number seven, you're more irritable.\nAre you finding yourself more\non edge with other people?\nDo others seem to constantly\nget on your nerves?\nDr. Carter, in 2013,\nstates that irritability often originates\nfrom feeling worthless, unproductive,\nand a growing perception that\nyou're not able to do things\nas productively or\neffectively as you once did.\nAt first, your personal and\nprofessional relationships\nmay be effected,\nhowever, in its later stages\nit can severely interfere\nwith the people in your life.\nStress may be inevitable\nbut burnout is preventable.\nMaking lifestyle choices\nto help manage stress,\nlike exercising, eating a balanced diet,\nworking on your self-care\nroutine, et cetera,\ncan go a long way in\nbalancing your lifestyle.\nIf you find that you are\nstruggling beyond this,\nit's important to check in with\na mental health professional\nor a health care provider for advice.\nLet us know your thoughts on the topic.\nWhat are some other signs of\nburnout that you've
