    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nAre you an introvert?\nDo you prefer to spend time alone\nand being moreso by yourself?\nIntroversion and extroversion\npersonality orientations\nwere first created by\npsychologist, Carl Jung\nin the early 1900s.\nExtroverts are more outspoken\nand get energy from\ninteracting with other people,\nwhereas introverts feel\ndrained in social settings\nand prefer to keep more to themselves.\nIntroversion and extroversion\nboth exist on a vast spectrum,\nwith varying traits\nto go along with each of\nthese personality types.\nAre you curious if you're a true introvert\nor want to learn more about introversion?\nHere are eight signs you\nare a true introvert.\nNumber one.\nYou are very observant.\nAre you someone who's very observant?\nDo you like to people-watch?\nHave you always been able to notice\nslight changes in your environment?\nWhen you're a true introvert,\nyou are the first one to\nnotice a friend's new haircut\nor their new outfit.\nYou pick up on slight differences\nin a person's body language\nand facial expressions.\nYou generally can read the room\nand recognize the energies\nthat other people are\nbringing into your space.\nIntroverts often learn things\nthrough careful observation,\nrather than impulsive execution.\nThis observant quality\nreally helps you develop\na heightened sense of your surroundings\nand the people within them.\nNumber two.\nYou're a great listener.\nDo you think you're a\ngood, active listener?\nDo you listen to and acknowledge\nyour friends or family\nwhen they come to you with a problem?\nIntroverts are good active listeners.\nDr. Laurie Helgoe, author\nof Introvert Power:\nWhy Your Inner Life Is\nYour Hidden Strength\nstates that introverts process\ninformation internally,\nand that skill allows\nthem to hear, understand,\nand provide carefully considered insight\nwhen they do respond.\nYou tend to be the best one to go to\nwhen someone has to vent.\nYou have the ability to set aside\nyour personal thoughts and feelings\nin order to respectfully\nallow others to process\nand reflect on their emotions.\nYou establish trust and transparency\nthrough how you attentively\nlisten to others.\nSo, your friends and family\nprobably count on you\nto be there for them and\nprovide the support they need\nin the heat of the moment.\nNumber three.\nYou are highly introspective.\nAre you remarkably introspective?\nIntroverts have a very\nactive internal monologue\nand are masterful at the art\nof introspective thinking.\nYou have a natural curiosity\nand a reflective attitude\nthat helps you to carefully\ndevise plans in your head\nbefore moving forward and\nchoosing to put them into action.\nThis contemplative thinking\nallows you to keep in touch\nwith your authenticity,\nbecause you're able to\nclosely monitor your thoughts,\nfeelings, and emotions.\nNumber four.\nYou think before you speak.\nDo you like to feel prepared\nbefore executing any plan of action,\nincluding a conversation?\nA true introvert feels\nthe need to rehearse\nand carefully formulate\napproaches and responses\nto certain conversations.\nYou think before you speak\nand choose your words wisely,\nespecially in order to\navoid miscommunications\nand misunderstandings.\nYou most likely appreciate\nwriting over talking.\nSo you feel far more comfortable texting\nor writing an email,\nrather than calling someone\nor talking in person.\nNumber five.\nYou are creative.\nDo you think more outside the box?\nDo you have a unique or\nuncommon perspective on things\nand deal with abstract reasoning?\nTrue introverts are\nextraordinarily creative.\nBecause you are introspective and curious,\nyou seek out solutions to problems\nand are into creative problem-solving.\nWhen social settings\ndrain you as an introvert,\nyou typically choose to relax\nthrough some sort of creative outlet.\nThis lets you rest and recharge.\nAfter a long day at school or work,\nyou look forward to spending time\nengaging in your favorite hobbies,\nwhether it's cooking something\ndelicious, playing music,\nwriting in a journal, or\nindulging in self-care.\nNumber six.\nYou experience emotions intensely.\nAre you very aware and in\ntouch with your feelings?\nDo you feel the same way\nabout the connections you\nhave with other people?\nWhen you are a true introvert,\nyou have a heightened level\nof emotional sensitivity.\nThis sensitivity comes with both positive\nand negative impacts.\nFor example.\nYou might have a great\namount of empathy for others\non one hand,\nbut on the other hand,\nyou might also struggle\nwith mental health issues.\nA study conducted by the United States\nNational Center for\nBiotechnology Information\nshows that introverts are more\nlikely to develop depression.\nThe study stated that\nintroversion acts in concert\nwith personality variables,\nincluding neuroticism and\na feeling-type personality.\nIntroverts, especially when\nunder high levels of stress\ncan absorb and internalize\nexternal feelings\nand often misidentify those\nfeelings as their own.\nAlthough this serves as\nan inconvenience at times,\nyou also have the ability\nto feel great empathy\nfor your fellow people.\nNumber seven.\nYou are a thoughtful type of networker.\nIt's an occasion for any introvert\nto attend a social gathering.\nBecause of this, you probably try\nto make every interaction\nwith others meaningful.\nYou are someone who values\nquality over quantity\nand you'll use every opportunity\nto make a good first impression.\nYou approach making\nconnections with new people\nwith intention and\nmindfulness, and thoughtfulness\nin order to formulate a secure foundation\nbefore having further\ninteractions with other people.\nA true introvert is someone\nwho networks thoughtfully\nand chooses to move with\nintention through a crowd\nor at a gathering.\nAnd number eight, you\nare an excellent leader.\nDo you have a skillset\nmade up of compassionate\nleadership skills?\nTrue introverts can make\nsome of the best leaders\nand role models.\nThere's been Rosa Parks, Mahatma Gandhi,\nBarack Obama, and Albert\nEinstein for example.\nThese are just a few of the many people\nwho have a great impact on the\nworld and they achieved this\nwith the help of their\ndistinctively introverted qualities.\nWhen you are a mindful\ncommunicator, an amazing listener,\nand are observant and introspective,\nthis gives the ideal characteristics\nto successfully carry and coach\na team of differing players.\nDo you relate to any of the\nsigns of being a true introvert?\nAre you an introvert yourself?\nShare your thoughts with\nus in the comments below.\nPlease like and share this\nvideo if it helped you\nand you think it could\nhelp someone else too.\nThe studies and references\nused in
