Elliott,\nand Roger Feltman,\npublished in the European\nJournal of Social Psychology,\nresearchers found that men are more likely\nto be attracted to the color red on women.\nIn the experiment,\nmen were tasked with\nasking women questions.\nSome women were clothed in\nread, while others in green.\nThe men chose to ask the women in red\nmore amorous questions.\nAnd in a second experiment,\nmen chose to sit closer to women in red\nversus women in blue.\nAs the research paper states,\nresearch shows for the first time\nthat color influences\nmen's behavior toward women\nin the romantic realm.\nColor, specifically red,\nappears to serve as a\nbasic non-lexical prime\nthat can influence important\nreproduction-relevant behavior\nin similar fashion across species.\nFour.\nImagine them already liking you.\nWe tend to imagine the worst-case scenario\nwhen meeting someone new and exciting.\nInstead, flip it around.\nIf you imagine your date already\nliking you, you'll relax,\ngain confidence, and\nreflect positive vibes.\nYou should give out good energy.\nSo if you're already anxious and worried,\nruminating about what could go wrong,\nthen that has a chance to\ngive off negative energy.\nInstead, treat them as a\nfamiliar person who likes you,\nas long as you still keep it respectable.\nFive.\nActively listen and make good eye contact.\nOne of the most important\nqualities in a partner,\nsomeone who can actively listen.\nThis can be a very alluring trait.\nHarvard researchers discovered\nthat taking the time\nto talk about yourself\ncan have many rewards.\nIn one of the five studies,\nsubjects sat in an fMRI machine\nand responded to questions\nabout either their own opinions\non a subject or another's.\nRegions of the brain associated\nwith reward and motivation\nwere most active\nwhile talking about their\nown thoughts on a subject,\nas opposed to others.\nThis need to talk about\nourselves is so strong\nthat in another study conducted\nby Harvard researchers,\nsome subjects even declined money\nto talk about themselves more.\nSix.\nUse a floral fragrance.\nOne of the most important\nparts of a first impression,\nscent.\nSo, if you smell like a greasy pillowcase,\nodds are you won't get that second date.\nIt's best to look your\nbest and look sharp.\nAnd when choosing a scent,\nresearch has found floral odors\npromote social interaction\nand the behavior to\napproach someone socially.\nResearch from Rutgers University\nfound that subjects use\nthree times as many\nhappiness-related words\nto write on life events when\na floral scent was in the air,\nin contrast to when there\nwas no fragrance present.\nSeven.\nUse their name often.\nPeople love the sound of their own names\nand they may not realize it.\nWe speak out someone's name\nto gain their attention.\nYou can do this mid-conversation as well\nto bring their gaze back to you.\nWe can even pinpoint our name\nspoken out of a crowded room.\nThis form of selective attention\nis related to the cocktail party effect.\nAt a party, for example,\nwe can hone in on a specific\nconversation of our choosing.\nMore importantly, if our\nname is spoken nearby,\neven when we are focused\non another conversation,\nwe immediately perk up and recognize\nthat someone is talking about us.\nSo slide in their name\nduring a first impression,\nthat is, if you know it.\nEight.\nListen and repeat their phrases.\nPeople like people like them.\nJeez, that's a bit of a tongue twister.\nScience suggests your\nodds of someone liking you\nwill increase if you use\nthe same words they use,\nand if you catch onto\ntheir unique phrases,\nthrow them in again at the\nend of your conversation\nor next meeting.\nIt hints you are actively listening\nand care to learn about them.\nNine.\nStart with a confident\npresence and good posture.\nConfidence is key,\nand we can all work towards\nraising our confidence\nthrough positive thoughts and self-love.\nIt's important to respect,\nvalue, and care for yourself\nin order to increase your confidence.\nOnce you do, you need to show it.\nPractice maintaining good\nposture and a confident presence.\nMaintaining good eye contact\nhas been known to help\nin first impressions.\nThink about why you desire someone.\nMaybe you know nothing about them,\nbut they simply give\noff an attractive vibe,\nbecause, looks aside, an\nattractive presence is everything.\nReflect on how you present yourself,\nyour behavior, your posture,\nand determine if it reflects who you are.\nIf it does, stay true to you\nand the person of your dreams\nwill like you for who you are,\ngood posture or not.\n10, focus on a common passion.\nIt's your first meeting,\nyour mind is blank,\nyou can't think of anything to talk about.\nWhen in doubt,\ndiscover what it is you're\nboth passionate about in life.\nThis will drive the conversation\nforward in a natural way.\nWe can't help but light\nup with a big smile\nwhen we talk about our passions.\nSo, if the conversation seems\nto be dwindling too soon,\nask them what they enjoy,\ndiscover their passions\nand discuss it, fast.\nIt may just leave a lasting impression,\nand if you implement all these tips,\nit may just be a seductive\nimpression at that.\nSo, which traits or\ntips will you use first?\nAnd if so, who and when\nwill you use them
