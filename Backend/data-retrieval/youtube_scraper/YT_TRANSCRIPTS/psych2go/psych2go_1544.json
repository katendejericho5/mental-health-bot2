    "transcript": "Are you curious and want to\nlearn more about self-love?\nMaybe you recognize that you need to work\non your sense of self-love.\nHaving self-love or growing\nyour sense of self-love\nhas the power to change your life.\nYou can become more confident,\nresilient, honest, authentic,\nand develop your self worth.\nThese are 10 unexpected\nways that self-love\nwill change your life.\nNumber one, it can improve your health.\nThe most obvious form of\nself-love is self-care.\nWe all have different ideas\nof what self-care looks like,\nsince it's personal to each person.\nBut self care is a way\nfor you to meet your needs\nand improve your overall wellbeing.\nAs you develop your self-love,\nyou'll begin to make time for things\nthat make you feel better in the long run,\nsuch as working out,\njournaling, or cooking,\nand eating a healthy recipe.\nWhen you practice self-care,\nyou're recognizing your personal needs\nand doing the things you need\nto do to meet those needs.\nNumber two, your relationships may change.\nThere's a modern day\nproverb about relationships,\nwhich goes, \"We accept the\nlove, we think we deserve.\nLoving yourself and how you love yourself,\nsets the example for how\nothers should love you.\"\nOn your journey to self-love,\nyou might wanna take stock of\nyour current relationships.\nAsk yourself, what am I\nrelationships like right now?\nWhat is my role in this relationship?\nDo I like the relationship\nthe way it is, or do I want it to change?\nAsking yourself these questions\nhelps to clarify your boundaries\nand what you're willing\nto accept from others.\nIf you love yourself, you'll find\nthat you'll be a bit less tolerant\nof any behavior that undermines\nhow you've decided to treat yourself.\nYour self-worth and personhood\nwill not be dependent on\nhow others perceive you,\nbut more so on how you see you.\nNumber three, you'll\nbuild your confidence.\nPart of self-love is the\nability to unconditionally\nand personally accept all of you\nas who you are, warts and all.\nOnce you've learned to accept\nwho you are and still be\nopen to the possibility\nof improvement your\nself-confidence will soar.\nThough insecurities will surface,\nthey'll not overwhelm you.\nYou'll develop the emotional maturity\nto acknowledge them and try to be better.\nNumber four, your self-worth may improve.\nAlong with your self-confidence,\nyour self-worth will also improve.\nAs a result, you will feel\nmore capable of taking risks\nand going after what you want,\nbecause you will feel more\ncomfortable in your abilities.\nYour drive and motivation towards\ncurtailed goals will reemerge.\nAdditionally, you'll strive\nto work hard for the things\nyou actually want and\nnot choose to settle.\nNumber five, you'll develop\nyour own sense of style.\nStyle or swag is not\njust a fashion accessory,\nit's a state of mind.\nIt's your own unique\nsignature that translates\ninto what you wear and how you wear it.\nHaving a swag is having self-assuredness\nand knowing who you are.\nSwag is not achieved through false bravado\nor fake self-confidence,\nbut through the process\nof knowing yourself\nand becoming comfortable in your own skin.\nYou know what you like and what you don't.\nAnd you communicate that\nto others respectfully.\nNumber six, how you relate to your family\nand friends might change.\nSelf-love will change your relationships\nwith your family and friends.\nYou'll start to prioritize your own needs.\nAnd in doing so, you might\nnot say yes to every party\nor event that your friends invite you to.\nMaybe you're tired and you need a break.\nYou'll recognize that and choose\nto have a personal night in instead.\nIf you have toxic friends or family,\nyou might start to distance\nyourself from those people\nin order to keep yourself protected.\nYou'll start to live for yourself\nand not for others expectations for you.\nAdditionally, you may\nfind that forgiveness\ncomes easier to you.\nSelf-love urges you to forgive others\nbecause you realized how harmful\nit is to hold onto grudges.\nNumber seven, self love will\nhelp you find happiness.\nIn most healthy relationships,\nyou want your significant\nother to be happy.\nSimilarly, you'll want the same\nwhen you enter into a more honest\nand personal relationship with yourself.\nWhen you prioritize yourself,\nyou'll leave behind the things\nthat are bringing you down.\nSelf-love allows you to step\ninto the life you desire\nand pursue the things you've\nalways wanted for yourself.\nNumber eight, you'll feel less insecure.\nWhen you cultivate self-love,\neveryone's opinions about you fade away\nto where they don't hold\nthat much power over you.\nConsequently, the only opinion\nthat will matter to you\nis your own.\nHence, you'll not be easily offended\nby other people's passing comments\nbecause you're more secure\nin yourself and who you are.\nNine, self love may\nmake you more resilient.\nDo you take failures personally?\nDo you beat yourself up about something\nyou did or didn't do?\nOr could have done differently?\nWhen you have a self-love,\nit will be easier to experience failure,\nbecause you've already developed\na strong sense of self.\nYou'll realize that\nfailure does not always\nhave to define you.\nYou will see each failure as\nan opportunity for growth.\nYou'll also be kinder\nand more compassionate\nto yourself when you do fail.\nGrowth takes time and patience\nand having the strength to\nget up when you fall in.\nSelf-love helped you cultivate\nall of that within yourself.\nAnd number 10, you'll become more humble.\nSelf-love teaches you acceptance\nof both the acceptable\nand seemingly unacceptable\nparts of yourself.\nAs a result, you'll see\nclearly your areas of weakness.\nAnd therefore, accept\nhelp when you need it.\nSelf love will also allow\nyou to extend compassion\nand support to others in the same way\nthat you've given it to yourself.\nYou'll also be less envious\nor jealous of others\nbecause you've stopped\ncomparing yourself to others.\nLove is a powerful force.\nSome even say that it can move mountains\nand make the impossible possible,\nbut love can also work\nin the simplest of ways.\nIt helps you heal and with time, blossom.\nThe journey to self-love\nisn't always pretty\nand it isn't always easy,\nbut it's absolutely worth it.\nDid you find this video helpful?\nWhat steps are you planning to take\nto help you practice self-love?\nShare
