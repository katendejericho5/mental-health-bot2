    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to a brand new video.\nDo you always fall back on bad habits\nbecause they have worked\nfor you in the past?\nAs the old saying goes,\n\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"\nUnfortunately, some of\nthese cultivated habits\nmay be more sinister than\nyou may have first imagined.\nThey may be so problematic to the point\nthat it adds or worsens\nexisting mental health problems\nif left unevaluated.\nSo to help you become\nmore aware of these habits\nso you can make the right\nchanges for your life,\nhere are five supposedly good habits\nthat are actually bad for you.\nNumber one.\nAlways being positive.\nAre you the type who\ntries to put on a smile,\neven when things get tough?\nDo you conceal your true emotions\nand hope that all the bad\nfeelings will go away?\nA Harvard study shows that\nsuppressing your emotions,\nwhether it's anger or\nsadness, grief or frustration\ncan lead to physical stress on your body.\nIt could even affect your\nmemory, anxiety, and self-esteem.\nWhen you're always\nputting on a positive face\nfor other people,\nyou start to neglect and\nsuppress your own emotions.\nIn the end, it's always\nhealthy to have an outlet\nto express your problems,\nwhether it's with your\nfriends, significant other,\nor therapist, or even a journal.\nArticulating your emotions\nis a therapeutic activity\nand is leagues better than\nbottling it up inside.\nNumber two.\nWorking too hard.\nDid you know that workaholics\nexhibit similar characteristics\nto people addicted to drugs and alcohol?\nAccording to author Diane Fassel,\n\"The only difference\nbetween being a work addict\n\"and a vice addict\n\"is that people are awarded and praised\n\"to work excessively.\"\nWhile overworking may\nbe seen as productive\nand as a means to achieve success quicker,\nthere are always real\ndangerous to working too much.\nConstantly straining yourself\ncould lead to problems\nlike substance abuse,\nsleep disorders, and anxiety.\nInstead, if you use the right strategies,\nyou can become just as\nproductive working normal hours\nas you are when you overwork yourself.\nFor instance, time-blocking\nand priority setting\ncan help recalibrate\nyour work-life balance.\nNumber three.\nAiming for perfection.\nDo you stop yourself from chasing\nafter your goals or dreams\nbecause you're worried\nyou'll make a mistake?\nBeing a perfectionist is not\nalways a good trait to have.\nResearch professor Brene Brown says\n\"Perfectionism is not the same thing\n\"as striving to be your best.\"\nInstead of building you up for success,\nperfectionism is like a suit of armor\nthat only protects you\nfrom the pain of guilt,\nshame, and judgment.\nUltimately, you'll never be\nable to take the first step\ntowards reaching your goals\nif you're always stuck in\nfear that you'll mess up.\nNumber four.\nAvoiding conflict.\nhave you ever kept your mouth shut,\neven when someone really\ngot on your nerves?\nHow did it feel?\nAvoiding conflict might seem\ntempting at a first glance,\nbut by being conflict-averse,\nyou may actually surprise\nyour valid emotions\nand even manifest them\nin nonverbal ways later.\nResearch shows that concealing\nor faking your emotions\ncan lead to loneliness or depression.\nSo while you might be avoiding conflict\nin fear of disagreeing\nor upsetting others,\nfostering honesty and authenticity,\neven with the possibility of conflict\nis more often than not going to lead\nto a more sincere and fulfilling\nrelationship in the end.\nNumber five.\nBeing a yes person.\nDo you say yes to everything,\neven when you feel uncomfortable?\nWhile it can be good to\nhelp out your friends,\nagreeing to everything in\norder to get people to like you\nmay not be the best attitude to have.\nUsually, being a people pleaser\nstems from a lack of assertiveness\nand a low self-esteem.\nNot only does this lead to a dysfunctional\nand unhealthy relationship,\nbut it can also perpetuate bad\nhabits that people may abuse.\nSo, instead of saying yes to everything,\nyou can try to reframe your mindset\nand find peace with the idea\nthat it's impossible to\nget everybody to like you.\nBy loving and respecting yourself,\nyou can have the energy\nto set up boundaries\nand leave toxic relationships behind.\nWere you surprised about any\nof the habits we've mentioned?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nAnd if you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video with those\nwho might benefit from it,\nand don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go posts a new video.\nAs always, the references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description box below.\nThanks so much for watching\nand we'll see you in the next video."
