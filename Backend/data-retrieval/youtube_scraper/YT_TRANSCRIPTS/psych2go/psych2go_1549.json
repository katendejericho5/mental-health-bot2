    "transcript": "- [Narrator] How are you finding your way\nin the dating world?\nYou may just have a list\nin the back of your mind\nof the top deal breakers\nfor your ideal relationship.\nBut while deal breakers are\nwhat many tend to notice,\nwhat about the deal makers?\nSometimes it's good to focus\non what can make your date\na potential partner, the deal makers.\nTo help you remember to look\nfor what you value as well,\nhere's a list of common deal makers\nthat can create a healthy relationship.\nNumber one, good communication.\nA relationship can't flourish and grow\nif a couple doesn't\ncommunicate effectively.\nDoes your partner express how they feel?\nDo they let you know\nwhen something is wrong?\nCommunication is key in any relationship.\nThe more honest you are with\nyour partner and your feelings,\nthe more you'll thrive as a couple.\nIf you know you've had problems\nwith a partner not\ncommunicating well in the past,\nlet your new romantic interest know\nyou hold good communication highly.\nNumber two, emotionally supportive.\nDoes your partner comfort and support you?\nAre they there for you when\nyou need them the most?\nMaybe you're dating someone\nnew and can't quite tell.\nTry expressing how you\nfeel after a bad day.\nIf they're willing to sit\nwith you and talk about it,\nthey're providing emotional support.\nIf they try to cheer you up,\nthat may also be another\nway of providing support\nto someone they care about.\nNumber three, willingness\nto work on the relationship.\nRelationships take work.\nThey're not always a piece of cake.\nAnd while they look beautifully designed\nand crafted on the outside,\nmm, chocolate cake,\nthey still need work in order to thrive.\nIf you have an argument with your partner\nand they don't seem interested\nin resolving or talking it out,\nthat may be a bad sign.\nA great deal maker is when someone tends\nto have a willingness to work through\nboth your disagreements\nand struggles together,\nnot just abandon the relationship\nafter one difficulty.\nNumber four, a great sense of humor.\nDoes your date make you laugh?\nDo you feel happy around them?\nEveryone is different\nwhen it comes to what they look for,\nbut one common deal maker in relationships\nis a sense of humor,\nsomeone who can make you laugh\nor simply someone who\nknows how to have fun\nand cheer you up.\nLet your date know\nyou not only want to talk\nabout the serious stuff,\nbut you wanna have fun with\nthem on this journey as well.\nNumber five, being able to\nadmit when they're wrong.\nNobody can be right all the time.\nWe all make mistakes.\nSo when it to a serious relationship,\nthere are bound to be disagreements.\nIt's not the end of the world\nif you disagree on the little things\nas long as your values match\nbut if they're unable to\nadmit when they're wrong,\nthat can have a negative impact\non your relationship moving forward.\nA great deal maker is being with someone\nwho can recognize when\nthey're wrong and apologize,\nand this goes both ways,\nso you better be able to\nadmit your faults as well.\nIt's honest and healthy for both of you.\nNumber six, someone who is willing\nto grow together and adapt.\nLet me ask you this.\nWill you be the exact same\nperson 10 years from now?\nOdds are, unless you're a program cyborg,\nyou're gonna change, mentally,\nphysically, and spiritually.\nYour desires, needs, and\nambitions may change as well.\nA great partner understands this\nand is open to growing with you.\nSometimes you will have differences\nand sometimes the\npartner can adapt to them\nand grow with you.\nBut if your values are drifting apart,\nthat may be a different story.\nNot every relationship is meant to last\nif partner's values and compatibility\nbecome drastically very different,\nbut the point is, your special\nsomeone shouldn't be one\nto hold you back from growing\ninto the person you'll soon become.\nDate with someone you can\nachieve goals with together\nwhile growing as an individual\nand a couple in the process.\nAnd in order for your\nrelationship to work,\nyou'd be willing to do\njust the same for them.\nTo grow as a person and\nhave a supportive partner\nby your side, that's a\ndeal I'm willing to make.\nSo which deal makers\nare on your dating list?\nAre you stuck in the dating\nworld, happily single,\nor have you found your\nspecial someone already?\nShare with us in the comments below.\nIt's also important remember,\nyou don't have to change\nwho you are for anybody.\nYour perfect partner\nwill love the qualities\nthat make you, you anyway.\nThe most important part\nis to not be afraid\nof knowing what you\nneed in a relationship.\nWhat makes you happy?\nThat's all the deal makers are.\nIt's important to know what you value\nand what works for you.\nIf you found this video helpful,\ndon't forget to click like button\nand share this video with
