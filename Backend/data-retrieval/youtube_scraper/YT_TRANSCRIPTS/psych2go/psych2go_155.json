    "transcript": "hi psych2goers the automatic image of\nchildhood is often populated with sunny\nimages of laughter playing in safety\nunfortunately for some\nthe darkness of depression mars these\nmemories with a heavy smear support love\nand reassurance from parents are crucial\nat this time for a child\nsadly whether it be due to denial lack\nof understanding or misattributed blame\nparents responses can actually make it\neven harder for kids to deal with\ndepression\nas such identifying false beliefs and\nspreading the truth is necessary to take\nback that childhood\nlet's see if we can help clear the air\nnumber one\nchildren can't get depressed it's adults\nonly\nsuperficially it looks like children\ndon't have enough life to build up the\nworry and jaded outlook that is\nassociated with depression no bills no\nworries right\nwell\nnot exactly remember depression isn't a\none-off bad day\naccording to data from the 2019 national\nsurvey of children's health 22 of the\nchildren tested had some sort of an\nemotional problem with the youngest\nparticipants being only three years old\ndepression is a psychological condition\nthat has no age requirement research has\nshown that depressed children's brains\nreact the same way as adult brains to\nstress hormones and to the happy\nchemicals serotonin and dopamine to help\nwith perspective consider too that a\nchild is still developing their identity\nteasing at school to a child can be as\ncrushing as a publicly cheating spouse\nto an adult we tend to forget that just\nas children don't get adult stuff adults\nhave to make an effort to see through\nthe child's eyes to understand them as\nwell\nso although depression shouldn't be a\nchildren's illness unfortunately it can\nbe\nnumber two\nit's just a phase it'll pass\nharmless phases from your childhood an\nobsession with one color or only talking\nabout one particular cartoon are not the\nsame as depression sure kids get upset\nbut for depression this isn't one\ntantrum after not getting ice cream the\nbehavior is an inexplicable ongoing\nsadness or anger with no obvious\nprovocation\nit's tempting to hope it will pass but\nsince depression doesn't go away on its\nown ignoring these signs will let it\nfester increase in severity and possibly\ndevelop into adult depression the\nfallout then includes poor health\nincreased anxiety criminal behavior\nacademic decline relationship issues and\nmost frighteningly increased risk of\nsuicidal ideation and actions\ndepression is an illness that requires\nappropriate treatment you would never\nlet a child walk off a broken leg bone\nso you shouldn't let their broken mental\nhealth be walked off either number three\nthey're glued to that darn phone all the\ntime\ntoday regardless of your age you've\nheard or seen something like this\nkid has a sore throat it's because of\nthat phone they're hungry it's because\nof that phone a kid's depressed\nis it that phone again\nwell it could be in a way but context is\nneeded recently researchers at the\nuniversity of north carolina found that\nthe phone use and depression connection\nin teens and younger children is\ncorollary not direct meaning variables\nassociated with phone use may be the\nculprits as an example with kids risks\nonline tend to mirror risks offline so\nschoolyard bullying means a greater risk\nfor cyberbullying which can lead to\ndepressive symptoms\nif the child feels negative overall\nthey're more likely to seek negative\nonline content\nsocial media can also provide\nunrealistic expectations which leads to\nfeelings of isolation and loneliness the\ntakeaway is\na phone acts as an easy open portal to\ninformation this is not bad in and of\nitself it's how the information is\nabsorbed and used that brings\ncontroversy\nusing a phone isn't an insta-depression\ncurse\nparents can help mitigate the issue by\npositively reinforcing phone downtime\nwith family bonding activities associate\nthe blue light break with goodness\nnumber four\nit's not depression they're just lazy\nas if depression didn't suck enough on\nits own the symptoms also tend to\nmasquerade as stereotypical laziness\nsince laziness is an easier concept to\nswallow then my child has mental health\nissues parents are tempted to assume the\nchild is crying wolf or crying\ndepression they think the child just\nscored a free ticket to the lazy\nextravaganza take a ride in a messy room\nvisit the rat's master booth and whoop\nit up to the dirty laundry coaster\nreality is the brain is messing\nbiologically with this child let us\nexplain\nto do\nanything energy and thought are needed\nto get and use these power pellets our\nbrain needs a particular chemical\nbalance if that balance is messed up so\nis the ability to think and do\nnow remember a day that wiped you out\nyou were so exhausted you barely made it\nhome and through the door the shoes even\nstayed on when you crashed into bed take\na shower that's not happening\nlucky for you\nthis was just a one-timer\nwhen a mind is depressed this run-down\nliving in molasses feeling and the\nzeroed out energy\nis a constant but wait there's more\nyeah depression has more physical\nsymptoms than these\nwhen observing a child if they're\nconstantly unable to do the basics like\ncleaning their room or playing with\nfriends this might be a red flag\nlook further than laziness the child is\naware of what it looks like they just\ncan't do it\nso the their lazy assumption and getting\nangry may be unfair investigate ask why\nand assure them that you're on their\nside let them know you love them no\nmatter what number five therapy means my\nchild getting stuffed with meds the\ninitial and immediate response of\ntherapists stuffing a child with\nmedication like a turkey is a myth\nchild psychiatrists will often initially\nrecommend non-medication therapy through\na psychologist\nthe most popular and effective being\ncognitive behavioral therapy cbt\ncbt is a talk therapy not medication\nthat helps improve both thought and\nbehavior it works on improving\ncommunication emotion regulation and\ncoping skills also symptom reappearance\nhas been shown to be lessened by 63\nafter cbt depending on severity\nmedication may be needed if talk alone\nisn't enough\nrest assured the psychiatrist will as\nprofessionally obligated take\nprecautions and consider several factors\nlike the level of depression and the\npreferences of the patient or guardian\nthe starting dose is set as low as\npossible and the entire process is\nclosely monitored by professionals as a\nparent or legal guardian you will be\nkept apprised of treatment and included\nin the final decisions the goal is to\nhelp the child so all possibilities\nshould be considered as well as taking\nthe professionals advice seriously and\nnumber six if my kid's depressed it\nmeans i'm a bad parent\nin some cases parents actually can\naffect their kids mental health but\nthose cases are fairly extreme and not\nthe norm\nif there isn't an abusive household a\nmessy divorce or other poorly handled\nabnormal situations chances are you are\nnot the cause for this depression also\ndepression develops due to multiple\nreasons including biological ones you\ncan't have control over biological brain\nchemistry so that can't be your fault\neither\nwhat is key's understanding your child's\nstruggles and even if you don't know how\nthat you're trying to learn how to help\nthem\nthat effort and caring\nnot taking the easy way out is what\nmakes you a good parent hopefully this\nis something you watched out of\ncuriosity and there isn't a depressed\nchild in your life however if you\nwatched as a parent who suspects or\nknows your child is depressed we\nsympathize and encourage you to seek\nprofessional assistance it can get\nbetter"
