    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWhat does it mean to be gifted?\nLike many, you may think it's having\nan exceptionally high IQ\nor being a child prodigy.\nAnd while it's true that people who fall\nunder these categories\ncan be considered gifted,\nit's also time you realize\nthat there are actually\nmany different types of giftedness\nthat tend to get\noverlooked and undervalued.\nFirst studied by researchers George Betts\nand Maureen Neihart in their 1988 article,\nProfiles of the Gifted and Talented,\nthey identified six different\ntypes of gifted individuals\naccording to their behaviors,\nfeelings, and needs.\nCurious to know which type you are?\nWell, here are six types of gifted people.\nNumber one, the successful type.\nType ones are the most\ncommonly recognized type\nof gifted individuals.\nThey're those we've typically come\nto associate with the term because\nof their impressive academic performances\nand prestigious achievements.\nMost type ones become\neven more driven to excel\nbecause of the high\nexpectations placed upon them\nat a young age by their\nparents, teachers, and peers.\nHowever, at the same time, some type ones\ncan become bored with school\nand lose their passion\nfor learning because they\nfeel like their giftedness\nhas become their entire identity.\nThis happens because\nmany parents and teachers\nmake the mistake of focusing too much\non developing their\nintelligence, talents, and skills\nthat it stunts their personal,\nsocial, and emotional growth,\nmaking them competent, but unimaginative,\nand ill-adjusted adults.\nNumber two, the challenging type.\nNext we have the second\ntype of giftedness,\nknown as the challenging type.\nType twos are labeled as such\nbecause they are often\nunafraid of challenging others\nand questioning authority.\nHighly creative, tenacious,\nand unconventional,\ntype twos tend to think\noutside the box so much\nthat it sometimes makes them\ndifficult to get along with\nbecause of how disruptive and\nnonconforming they can be.\nOften receiving little to no recognition\nfor their giftedness, many\ntype twos feel frustrated\nwith the school setting because\nit stifles their creativity,\noverlooks their abilities,\nand keeps them from realizing\ntheir full potential.\nIf they don't have a\nsupport system in place\nor have other positive\ninfluences in their life,\nit's likely for type twos to\ndevelop delinquent behaviors\nor eventually drop out of school.\nNumber three, the underground type.\nType threes, also called\nthe underground types,\nare gifted individuals who wanna try\nto hide their giftedness from others.\nThis may be because they\nwant to feel more included\nin a non-gifted peer group,\nfeel too much pressure to excel,\nor dislike the intense\nscrutiny and attention\nthat giftedness often brings.\nThose who don't manifest their giftedness\nuntil late childhood or\nearly adolescence tend\nto fall into this category,\nmost likely because that is the age\nwhen the desire for\nbelongingness and social approval\ntypically starts to intensify.\nAs a result of denying\ntheir full capabilities,\nthey may end up feeling\ninsecure and anxious.\nTo remedy this, type threes\nneed a lot of encouragement\nand understanding, not only\nfrom their parents and teachers,\nbut also from their peers.\nNumber four, the drop-out type.\nAnother type of gifted individual\nmost people are unaware of\nis type fours, also known\nas the drop-out types,\nor the at-risk types.\nType fours tend to have a\nreputation and are labeled as such\nbecause they often struggle\nwith feelings of anger,\nfrustration, and depression as a result\nof their giftedness being overlooked,\nSimilar to type twos, type fours struggle\nwith their self-esteem\nbecause they feel rejected\nand unappreciated by others.\nSince their interests, skills, and talents\ndon't align with the\ntypical school curriculum,\nthey don't receive the support\nand affirmation they need\nfrom the people around them.\nNumber five, the double labeled type.\nThe fifth type of giftedness\nas the double label type,\nwhich refers to gifted\nindividuals who have a physical\nor emotional handicap of some sort.\nMost have learning\ndisabilities, such as dyslexia,\ndysgraphia, dyscalculia, and so on,\nwhich can make it difficult\nfor school systems and programs\nto identify them as gifted.\nTheir handicap may also\nmake it more difficult\nfor them to complete their work on time\nor to fulfill other structured tasks\nas easily as other gifted students,\nwhich can make them\nmore easily discouraged,\nfrustrated, and critical of themselves.\nType fives may also be\nimpatient, stubborn,\nand sensitive to criticism,\nwhich only makes it more important\nthat they're given the proper assistance\nto nurture their strengths and talents.\nAnd number six, the autonomous type.\nLast, but certainly not least,\nwe have the autonomous type,\nwhich refers to those gifted individuals\nwho are independent,\nconscientious, and self-reliant.\nSimilar to type ones, type\nsixes often find success\nand recognition because they have learned\nhow to excel in the school setting\nor have found ways to make\nthe system work for them.\nResourceful and goal oriented,\nthey are natural-born leaders\nand are well-respected\nby those around them.\nAnd unlike most other types,\ntype sixes often are aware\nthat they're gifted.\nHowever, because they\nhave such a strong sense\nof personal power, they\nare never preoccupied\nwith impressing other people,\ngaining their approval,\nor fitting in with their peers.\nSo, which type did you relate to the most?\nDo you relate to more than one type?\nLet us know in the comments
