    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey,\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nBefore we begin, we'd like\nto mention that this video\nis for educational purposes only.\nPlease do not diagnose yourself or others.\nAlso, please note that\nthe official term for\nskin picking disorder\nis excoriation disorder.\nThe official name used by the DSMV.\nWith that said, let's begin.\nWe've probably all seen people\npick at their skin before,\nwhether it's at a pimple, a\nscab, or a dry, flaky skin.\nHowever, not everyone\nwho picks at their skin\nhas a serious problem.\nSo, what differentiates\nnormal skin picking\nfrom abnormal skin picking?\nOne that becomes a disorder.\nThis video will discuss\nthe diagnostic criteria\nof skin picking disorder\nor excoriation disorder.\nAccording to the fifth edition of the\n\"Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders,\"\nor the DSM-V.\nNumber one. The person\nkeeps picking at their skin.\nPeople with skin picking\ndisorder repeatedly pick\nat their skin, often for hours.\nSkin picking can be automatic.\nFor example, a person could\nbe talking on the phone\nand be picking at their skin\nwithout even realizing it.\nOr, it can be more focused\nwhere the person is well-aware\nthat they're picking at their skin.\nNevertheless, as a result\nof the skin picking,\nthe person develops scabs and wounds,\nand feels the need to cover\nit up with clothing or makeup.\nNumber two. The person\nhas tried to stop picking\nat their skin.\nThe criteria also requires\nthe person to have repeatedly\ntried to stop picking at\ntheir skin without success.\nThey may have reached out to people\nto help them stop as well.\nThe potential reason why they\nfind it difficult to stop\npicking at their skin,\nmay be because it gives\na sense of relief and\nfeelings of satisfaction\nafter picking out their skin.\nIn short, if it makes them feel good,\nit's hard for them to stop.\nNumber three.\nSkin picking causes clinically\nsignificant distress in\nother aspects of the person's life.\nSkin picking causes the person\nto experience distress in\nother areas that matter to\nthem, such as their ability\nto focus in school or at a workplace.\nThe person could feel shame,\nembarrassment, or humiliation\nas a result of the way that they act.\nExamples of clinically\nsignificant distress can include\navoiding all forms of social\ncontact because they worry\nabout what others might think about them,\npicking at their skin in public.\nOr, like avoiding classes\nbecause they're worried\nabout not being able to resist\nthe urge to pick their skin\nin front of other students.\nNumber four.\nSkin picking must be differentiated\nfrom other disorders.\nA common criterion in the\ndiagnosis of other disorders\nin the DSM, is that the disorders\nshould be distinctly different\nfrom other disorders.\nIn this case, skin picking\ncannot be attributable\nto other disorders.\nIn particular, skin picking disorder\nneeds to be differentiated\nfrom other experiences,\nsuch as delusions in a psychotic disorder,\nefforts to improve appearance\nin body dysmorphic disorder,\nstereotypes in stereotypic\nmovement disorder,\nor obsessions and compulsions, and OCD.\nAnd there you have it.\nThe diagnostic criteria\nof skin picking disorder\nas described by the DSM-V.\nFor someone to be diagnosed\nwith skin picking disorder,\nthe behavior has to be\nfrequent to the point of\naffecting their performance\nin everyday life,\nand has to cause them distress.\nThey also have to have\nattempted to stop picking\nat their skin.\nAnd these symptoms must\nbe distinguished by\nsymptoms of other possible disorders.\nHave you or someone\nyou know been diagnosed\nwith skin picking disorder?\nAnd would like to share your experience?\nWhat other psychiatric\ndisorders would you like\nto learn about?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nGive this video a like\nand subscribe to Psych2Go\nif you enjoyed this content.\nAnd as always, thanks for watching.\nWe'll see you next time."
