    "transcript": "- Looks like we're live.\nHi, let's answer your\nquestions about dreams\nand disorders of dreaming.\nHave you ever experienced\nthe sensation of being awake,\nbut unable to move or speak?\nOr what about the more immersive\nexperience of being aware\nthat you're dreaming\nand perhaps even having\nsome control over those dreams.\nToday, we'll be discussing these questions\nand more by touching upon topics such as\nthe interpretations\nand functions of dreams\nabout sleep paralysis\nand about lucid dreaming.\nSo welcome to our Ask\nAn Expert live stream.\nMy name is Monica, your host,\nand I am honored to be\njoined by Dr. Jalal today,\nwho is our expert on dreams,\nsleep paralysis and lucid dreaming.\nYou have submitted your questions\nto our YouTube community\npage and our discord server.\nAnd we've picked the top\nquestions to answer today.\nSo I invite you to deeply\nengage with our live stream\nby leaving your questions, your thoughts,\nor your comments in the\nchat box, to the right,\nas we'll have an opportunity to answer\nthese questions live at\nthe end of the stream.\nSo hope you stay tuned for that.\nIn addition, you can leave\nyour thoughts, comments,\nor questions in the comment section below,\nand I'll do my best.\nAnd the team will as well to\nanswer them after this stream.\nSo we hope you stay till the end\nto learn some interesting\nfacts about sleep paralysis,\nlucid dreaming, and\nabout dreams in general.\nThe plan is during this time,\nI will be giving you a brief\nintroduction to myself,\nPsych2GO team member to our expert doc.com\nAnd then we'll dive\nstraight into the questions\nthat you sent in.\nSo let's begin.\nSo as an introduction to myself,\nI'm Monica and I'm a clinical\nneuroscience graduate student\nwho is very interested in psychiatry\nand outreach initiatives.\nOne of these outreach initiatives\nincludes like to go where\nI'm very grateful to be\nable to interact with you\nand see your questions, chat with you all.\nAnd of course, hosts these\nlive stream with experts\nto make psychiatry assessable to all.\nAs I know that many of you are joining us\nfrom all different parts of the world\nand at different times,\ndo wanna remind you that this stream\nwill be available for you to watch later,\nbut we do encourage you\nto engage with us today.\nAnd now I will introduce\nyou to our expert.\nHello, Dr. Jalal, thank\nyou for joining us today.\n- My pleasure Monica. How are you?\n- I'm very well super\nexcited for our discussions\nand to share our knowledge\nwith everyone here.\n- Yeah, same here, same here.\n- Thought it might be a good opportunity\nto begin with a introduction.\nSo the community gets to\nknow you a bit better.\nHow does that sound?\n- Sounds great.\n- So we are very, very fortunate\nto have Dr. Baland Jalal\nwho is a researcher at Harvard university\nand a visiting researcher at Cambridge.\nHe also completed his PhD there\nand he has published 45 academic papers\nand is a co author in a recent book\n\"By Cambridge University Press.\"\nThe telegraph described him as one\nof the world's leading\nexpert on sleep paralysis.\nHe was also ranked as the top rated expert\nin sleep paralysis and the\nworld on experts scope,\nbase, expert scapes sorry,\nbased on the scientific impact.\nHis work has been featured in major media\nlike New York Times, Washington Post,\nThe Today Show, BBC, The\nGuardian and The Times.\nFurthermore, he has\nwritten about his research\nfor the scientific American,\nthe Boston Globe and the Big Thing.\nHe is truly an expert in this field.\nAnd we were so excited\nto have him join us today\nto share his expertise on this topic.\nSo thank you so much for joining.\n- Well, thank you so much Monica\nand thank you so much for\nthe generous introduction.\n- Of course.\nSo I thought let's begin with maybe\njust general questions that the community\nhas submitted regarding dreams in general.\n- Yup. Yup, that's it.\n- Yeah. So one of the top questions\nwere actually sent by Justin via YouTube,\nhis general ideas that many\npeople or many psychologists\nand neuroscientists tend\nto think that dreams either\nhave meaning or they don't,\nit's kind of usually split. Right?\nSo which leads to his\nquestion of what do you think\nthe functions of dreams are?\nOr do you want to give\nan overview about some\nof the different theories\nand discuss those maybe?\n- Oh yeah, absolutely.\nWell, dreams is a heavy topic, right?\nSo we are diving right in.\nSo what's going on during dreams, right?\nYou're find yourself\ntransported into this bizarre\nand strange world where you're\nbasically you're, you know,\nyou are encountering\nthese novel environments.\nThey are usually very strange.\nAnd oddly, you don't know,\nyou don't feel like it's not,\neven though it's a novel environments,\nyou don't feel like it's necessarily novel\nand you don't feel like\nit's bizarre and strange,\neven though the fabric of\nreality is all warped, right?\nSo time places people\neverything's sort of shifted.\nSo what's going on and can you brain sort\nof explain this bizarre world,\ncan the brain and\nneuroscience explain the fact\nthat people all around the world,\nwhen I go lecture in whatever\ncountry people would tell me,\nI was chased by this monster\nand I couldn't get away,\nmy legs were, they felt\nso heavy, you know,\ndid you have that dream\nonce in a while, Monica?\nYou're trying to move but\nyour legs are so heavy\nyou can't really get away and the monsters\nis chasing you or whatever it is.\nThings are very strange\nand also dreams tend\nto be heavily populated by people.\nSo there's something about the way\nthat we construct the\ntheory of other minds.\nThat's sort of heavily\ninvolved during dreams.\nSo what's going on. So let's\nlook at the brain, right?\nSo what's happening during dreams,\nbut in order for us to understand dreams,\nwe have to understand that\nthese vivid life-like crisp\ndreams that we all have.\nAnd remember for the most of the time,\nemerge out of something\ncalled a REM sleep.\nSo each night we go through\ndifferent phases of sleep.\nSo we have stages one and\ntwo where a heart rate\nand blood pressure drops. Right?\nAnd then we go into sort of,\nwhat's called deep sleep where we have\na lot of shopkeeping going on.\nSo things like repair of like, you know,\nmuscles and DNA repair\nand things like that.\nSo it's really like a\nshopkeeping time. Right?\nAnd then from there into what's\ncalled REM, the REM phase,\nand here we have the\nlifelike and crisp dreams\nwhere we are paralyzed.\nOkay and we are paralyzed\nduring these dreams\nin order to avoid, you know,\nto avoid hurting ourselves\nduring these dreams.\nOkay. So during this REM\nphase, the neurochemistry,\nthe neurochemical environment is different\nthan waking life basically. Okay.\nSo you have chemicals like serotonin.\nSo this chemical involved in mood,\nthe neurons that produce\nserotonin stop act,\nare not inactive during REM sleep. Okay.\nSo they replenish,\nthey need to sort of be\nrecharged like you recharge\nyour iPhone for example,\nor your smartphone, right?\nSo they are recharged. And\nso that means, you know,\nthe cortex, the top layer of the brain,\nwhich is important for a lot\nof different things like logic\nand agency and awareness of\nthe self and things like that.\nSince that chemical is not\navailable during REM sleep\nand drink dreams.\nAnd that means our logic\ncenters in the brain\ndon't work as they should.\nThey're not optimally functioning.\nAnd that explains why dreams\nare strange and bizarre\nto get to the, you know,\nthe question, right?\nWhy dreams, do they have a meaning?\nWell, there are strange and bizarre\nbecause a part of the brain known\nas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,\na fancy name for structure,\nimportant sense of logic\nand putting the world\ntogether in a coherent way.\nWell, that part of the\nbrain is not working,\nso dreams are strange.\nSo that's an explanation to that,\nor why do you have these dreams\nwhile you can't move, for example,\nwhen the monster is chasing you.\nWhile it turns out because\nyou need that cortex\nto be working right during dreams.\nAnd the serotonin, that\nchemical is not there\nto give gasoline to the CEO,\nthat part of the brain that's\nimportant for those functions.\nWell, the emotional part of\nthe brain gets the upper hand\nin a way, because the cortex is important\nfor inhibiting your emotions.\nAnd so the emotions represents\nthat monster chasing you.\nAnd since you can really\ndampen those emotions, well,\nthat means you're heavy, you know,\nand the motor cortex\nis also in that region.\nAnd so that explains why you\nare, weak sort of movement.\nDoes that make sense,\nor was that a sort of a\nlong-winded answer to explain,\nto basically say that, you know,\nthe brain and the neurochemistry,\nthe neurochemical environment\nof the brain explain well\nwhy dreams have that, you know,\na reality to them that we\nexperience each night basically.\n- That's such a fascinating response.\nI never really thought of it\nreally being centered around\nthe dorsolateral prefrontal\ncortex and having\nthat kind of being damping down a bit\nas a reason why we have\nsuch bizarre dreams.\nSo that was really, really cool to hear,\nwhich is actually very interesting\nbecause I wondered, you know,\nif there's any differences between people\nwho have healthy brains and those\nwho might have lesions to that area,\nare there differences in their dreams?\n- That's a great question.\nWould there be differences?\nWell, we've hypothesized\nso that we think that yes,\nprobably there would be some changes,\nbut I'm not even aware of\nwhat the literature would say.\nSo obviously, if you are blind,\nyour visual cortex is out of,\nis not you don't have a visual cortex\nor you're sort of a\ncongenitally blind, right?\nThen you won't have visual dreams, right.\nThat so you will have auditory dreams.\nYou will have a tactile sensations,\nbut you won't actually see things.\nBut yeah, I would venture that\nif there's something\nwrong in those structures\nin the brain, you know,\nthings would be different.\nLet me give you an example.\nSo one thing about dream is\nthe sense of self, right?\nThe sense of I, the sense\nof Baland and Monica. Right.\nI feel like anchored in this body, right?\nIf I don't feel like I'm\nfloating out in space\nand there are structures\nin the brain called superior\nparietal lobe or the TPJ,\nbasically structures in the parietal lobes\nthat creates a sense of self. Okay.\nAnd it turns out when\nyou are in REM sleep,\nthe TPJ, for example,\nthat's region deactivates.\nIt doesn't work as it\nshould and that explains\nwhy your sense of self is\nloosened up during dreams.\nThat explains why you can\ntake the vantage point\nof Monica during your dreams, right?\nLike a first person's\nperspective, I see myself,\nor you can feel like you're\nactually seeing yourself\nfrom outside perspective.\nSo it's almost like a\nperspective of your dreams,\nor I've had a dream where I've worked,\nI was catapulted into\nsomebody else's you know body.\nAnd I was seeing the world\nthrough their point of view\nand the explanation is then\nthat the sense of self is not,\nor that structure of the brain\nis not working as it should.\nNow I would, my guess would\nbe that if you have lesions\nwith that parts of the brain,\nthere is that, you know,\nthose portions of the brain\naren't working as they should,\nwell then likely you might\nhave dreams where the sense\nof self is distorted, you know,\nand because they actually,\ntheir sense of self is\ndistorted during waking life.\nSo people with strokes\nin that part of the brain\nwill attribute their limbs,\nfor example to other people.\nThings like that. So, yeah, I guess so,\nbut definitely it's a great\nquestion, its a great question.\n- Yeah. It's super cool.\nAnd just knowing that, for example,\nif we're gonna talk\nabout memory and dreams,\nmemories, not only, you know,\na part like the hippocampus\nis not just the center\nfor memory, like people,\nI think I've known that\nit's more integrative,\nlike the neocortex is\ninvolved, for example,\nwhich leads me to one of the questions\nthat Chiodo from YouTube\nhas asked, which is,\nare there any courts to the frequency\nin what makes people\nremember their dreams more?\nCan it be explained by having one part\nof the brain more activated\nor anything like that?\n- Yeah, it's a great question.\nSo it turns out 95% of\ndreams are not remembered.\nSome people forget their\ndreams all the time,\nand the reason is you\nreally need serotonin.\nYou need, you know, these\nstructures to be, you know,\nthese chemicals to be\navailable when you sleep\nso you can transfer short-term memories\nto long-term memories, right?\nSo given that chemical is not available.\nSo serotonin is important\nfor that process.\nYou will forget your dreams, but in fact,\nwhen you wake up, when wakefulness occurs,\nthere's a surge of serotonin\nsort of your brain is flooded.\nyour cortex is flooded with\nserotonin and noradrenaline\nand that explains why you can\nremember your dreams exactly\nin that time window of like\na minute or 30 seconds,\nthat's because your brain\nis flooded with serotonin.\nAnd so it's a good time to do\nit, having a dream journal.\nNow, in terms of remembering your dreams,\nthere is a correlate.\nSo people that have more, was it,\nit escapes me now because,\nyou know, I think it was,\nif you can remember your dreams,\nit was either heavy sleepers or people\nthat have a fragmented sleep.\nIt's escapes me right now,\nbut there's certainly correlated\nhow people that remember,\nI think it was, yeah, I\nhave to think about it.\nI can't remember, maybe it comes back.\nMemory, you see it's about\nremembering dreams (indistinct)\nThere's certainly a correlate of that,\nbut yeah, 95 or so percent\nof dreams are not remembered.\nIt has to do with this transfer\nof memory from short to long\nand to do with that being, you know,\nthat part of the brain not working\nas it should during REM sleep.\n- Thank you. That's\nvery, very interesting.\nI love just to know how, you know,\nneuroscience connects with our\nconscious perceptions dreams,\nall that, it's very, very interesting.\nAnother question that was\nsubmitted along these lines\nof remembering our dreams\nwas from (indistinct)\nwho was asked why do you think\nthat some people experience\nreoccurring dreams.\n- Ah, reoccurring dreams,\nit's a good question.\nSo I think there are\ndifferent explanations for it.\nProbably one thing could be people\nwith trauma and PTSD, right?\nSo, because the dreams are\nso salient and in this,\nlike the circuits mediating\nthose dreams, right?\nLet's say there's a negative\nassociation of a night,\nyou know, so it becomes a nightmare\nand it reoccurs perhaps\nbecause your emotional brain,\nthe limbic system is overactive.\nAnd then that dreams keep reoccurring.\nBut in terms of people that just have\nthe same positive dream\nover like all the time,\nit was a good question.\nI think it probably has\nto do with how often\nthey think about a dream waking life,\nif it has a salient\nimportant meaning for them.\nAnd then they think about it\nand it just keep reoccurring.\nSo I think sort of has to do with salient\nthis term meaning that it's important.\nIt has some emotional value for you\nand then it just keeps recurring.\nThat would be my thought on that.\n- That makes a lot of sense.\nActually I was writing my applications\nfor uni and as a part of it,\nI had to write a personal statement\nand this is an important piece of writing.\nSo people kind of\nunderstand why I want to do\nwhat I want to do. And then\nI kept thinking about it.\nSo actually two nights ago,\nI don't know what happened.\nI literally wrote the first\nparagraph in my dreams.\nAnd then I woke up and wrote this down\nand it's literally in my\napplications right now.\nSo I think that makes a lot\nof sense just to, you know,\nexplain it by having that\nemotional salience aspect.\nIt's definitely very true for me.\n- Yeah. And that too,\nbut also just interesting\nabout the whole idea\nof like having insights in your dream.\nSo it turns out because,\nso we mentioned that this chemical,\nthe serotonin is not available, right?\nSo during REM, during REM sleep,\nand that explains the logic\nand all that not working right.\nBut also, so noradrenaline\nalso the neurons that produce\nthis chemical is also\non sort of taking a nap,\nforgive the (indistinct)\nbut they're taking a nap.\nAnd so for that reason, because, you know,\nadrenaline and noradrenaline, right?\nYou need adrenaline to really focus in\nand be sort of really narrow and focus\nand because noradrenaline is\nnot available during REM sleep,\nwell, that explains why constantly\nyou can think in a more sort of broad way\nthat concepts can float around more\nand you are less focused in on things.\nWell, in a sense that allows\nyou to be more creative, right?\nBecause then again,\nbecause logic is out of the picture\nand because you have this\nmore broad perspective,\nyou can think of things in novel new ways\nand give half fresh insights.\nAnd there's lots of examples\nof like the, you know,\nthe great mathematician\nat Trinity college Ramanujan, the India.\n- Yes, I know, yes.\n- You know, right?\nSo yeah, Monica and I, you're\nat Oxford and I used your,\nI did my PhD at Cambridge.\nSo we have (indistinct)\nyou know, so this guy,\nhe was having insights\nin his dreams and sort\nof mathematical insights\nthat were great for his time,\nyou know, and stuff like that.\nAnd we had Edison too.\nSo Edison, I believe it was Edison.\nI'm pretty sure. So what he\nwould do is that he would sleep.\nLike he would sit on a table like this\nor a chair like this, excuse me.\nAnd you have like a spoon in his hand\nand a plate on the floor\nand he would keep the\nspoon like this. Right?\nSo like this, the camera is here,\nhe would have the spoon in his hand\nand there was a plate on the floor\nand he would sort of drift off to sleep.\nAnd then by the time he\nwould fall asleep, you know,\nthe spoon would go on\nthe plate and, you know,\nand then he would wake up\nand write down his dreams.\nAnd this was a way to get insight\nto the dream information so\nhe could have new discoveries.\nSo yeah. Dreams are in\nan interesting world\nand I've certainly been able\nto actually get some of my own ideas,\nscientific ideas from\ndreams, you know, so, yeah,\nit's a very interesting world.\n- You've probably heard\nof calculate the scientist\nwho apparently dreamt about\nthe structure of benzene.\nSo the story was,\npeople didn't really know what\nbenzene would've looked like,\nbut he had this dream where\na snake was chasing his own tail\nand it created that, you know,\ncycloid structure of benzene\nwhich was true to an extent,\nthere were some details that were lacking,\nbut the basis of it was essentially,\nor so-called informed by dreams.\nSo it's lovely to see this\ninteraction between creativity\nand applications to science or real life.\n- Yeah, exactly.\nAnd especially because dreams are supposed\nto be this like weird fluffy world,\nthat lacks sort of, you\nknow, the laws of reality,\ndon't come here to our sort of, you know,\nscientists would like to\nbe precise and all that.\nAnd here you are in this sort\nof world where everything\nis bizarre and strange, and\nyet you can have, you know,\nstriking scientific insights\nthat can guide your science.\nSo it shows you how, you\nknow, how amazing that is.\nBut yeah, for sure.\n- We actually have a question\nthat was just sent in\nand it's quite relevant\nto our discussion now.\nSo I thought maybe we can chat about that.\nAnd if there are any more live\nquestions from our members,\njust do put it in the\nchat, we'll get to it.\nCharmaine has asked contrary to how dreams\ncan be used to informed\nscientific findings,\nhow true is just general\ndream interpretations.\nIs there a meaning behind\nthings like teeth falling off\nor like people chasing\nyou, things like that.\n- Things like that. It's a great question.\nIs there a meaning to that?\nSo there's the brain, right?\nThere's the brain, as we mentioned,\nsomebody's chasing you\nwell, that can explain it\nand by the brain\nand your emotional centers\nbeing overactive. Right?\nAnd I want to really make sure\nthis point is clear, right?\nSo the frontal cortex\nis like the super ego\nof frontal or this sort of CEO,\nand it sort of dampens your emotions.\nSo when you go out and face a bear\nor whatever situation, right,\nyour emotions will flare up\nand then you will have\nyour cortex telling you,\ntelling the emotional part, well,\nrelax or whatever the\ncase might be. Right?\nAnd it will sort of have that.\nIn dreams, the cortex is simple,\nsimply so weak that the emotional\nwill get the better of you. Right?\nAnd so this shift, the neurochemistry\ncan explain a lot of things.\nSo the question is,\nis there a then additional\nmeaning to all of that?\nAnd I think, well,\npotentially there might\nbe other meanings to it,\nlike psychological or whatever,\nbut you can also definitely,\nthere's a descriptive meaning,\nI think in terms of the brain.\nSo somebody that I knew briefly\nat Harvard, Alan Hobson, I knew him.\nI interacted with him\na few times, you know,\nhe was a very caring\nguy who was very warm,\nvery warm person, a\ngreat dream researcher,\nand unfortunately passed away recently.\nSo he has a lot of ideas\nabout how, you know,\nhow you have all this neural\nfiring dream, you know,\nREM sleep, where you have the good dreams.\nIn fact, if you look at the brain\nof somebody in REM sleep, right?\nYou know, and you eavesdrop\non the activity of neurons,\nthe guy in REM sleep looks just\nlike the person who's awake, right?\nSo there's back if you look\ndeep enough, the guy in REM,\nhe looks more awake than the guy\nwho was actually awake in some cases,\nthere's a burst of activity of neurons.\nSo the question is,\nis the brain just trying to\nmake sense of all these neurons\nby creating coherent stories?\nLike the brain is a storyteller.\nWe know that, you know,\nso we survived by telling stories.\nSo if you have things in the environment,\nyour brain will create stories\nand narratives around that.\nSo the brain is a great storyteller.\nSo is the brain simply making sense\nof all this neural\nactivity and saying look,\nlet me, you know create a\nKorean story around that\nor is there a deeper meaning?\nI think that's up to question\nand depends on the perspective\nyou're coming from.\nSo if you're somebody who's looking at it\nfrom a spiritual perspective,\nyou might have one view you're coming\nfrom the brain perspective\nyou have one view,\nbut definitely the descriptive\nbrain perspective makes a lot\nof sense from that, you\nknow, point of view.\nSo, yeah, that's a,\nwas there anything else\nembedded in that question?\nSo there was a question of\nif the dreams have meaning, right?\nWas that there in that question.\n- Yeah, that was Charmaine's question.\nHope you enjoyed the answer Charmaine\nif you have any followups.\nWell, do let us know.\nWe did touch on the topics of like themes\nthat come up in dreams.\nSo I'll put timestamps\non those parts later on\nfor them to check out.\nAnd I just like to say for\npeople who are just joining us,\nthat we're currently talking about\nthe questions that you submitted\non our YouTube and our\ndiscourse regarding dreams\nin general, but we'll soon\nget into sleep paralysis\nand lucid dreaming.\nSo please continue watching\nand then we'll get to\nanswer your questions live.\nAll very exciting stuff to come.\nSo another question that\nwas submitted by Alexander,\nI think it's one of our last questions\nin that dream section is that can dreams\nbe so mundane that they're often\nconfused for real memories,\nit's quite specific, but very interesting.\n- Yes its a good question.\nCan dreams be so mundane that they would\nbe sort of confused for memories?\nWell, the thing is in\npeople with narcolepsy,\nso these are a patient population\nwhere there are people that\nthey might fall asleep.\nSo I usually give a lecture and I say,\nif you fall asleep during the lecture,\nthen that makes sense as\nma'am just being boring.\nBut if I fall asleep as the lecture,\nthen I might have narcolepsy, right?\nSo these are people who've\njust fallen asleep all of a sudden.\nNow it turns out people with narcolepsy,\nironically or strangely rather tend to,\nthese people tend to\nsometimes mistake a dream,\nthe dream world with the wakeful world.\nSo there can be some confusion\nor things leaking over,\nbut typically can people forget?\nI think they're, yeah,\nthey probably could.\nThey might, but it's\nnot really that common.\nI think, yeah. I don't think it's common.\nThere's actually a debate\nabout what Deja Vu, right?\nWhether when you go see\nsomething like you go\nand you see, you go to Egypt\nfor the first time, right?\nFirst time and you see\nthe pyramid or something,\nor that's a bad question.\nThat's because you've seen that in movies,\nif you don't some place new, right?\nAnd you say, oh my God,\nI've been here before what's\ngoing on and the question,\nso some people explain\nthat away by saying, look,\nyou had a dream where you\nsaw some similar landscape\nin your dream, you forgot about it.\nAnd you're seeing that now\nand then that's Deja Vu.\nSo it's a good question.\nI'm not sure if it's 100% known\nbut I'm sure it could be possible.\n- Yeah. I've heard some,\nI think it was a concept\ncalled like false awakening\nwhere you essentially just dream\nabout going about your day.\nAnd I've had that happen to me once.\nI would dream that I just\nget up, brush my teeth,\nlike eat and then only to wake up\nand realize it was a dream.\nAnd that's exactly what I'm gonna do.\n- Yeah, yeah, that's\ninteresting. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nThat's set us right\n- Its really.\n- Well, there's a lot of these things\nor when you do a certain\ntask a lot, like, you know,\nif you do something over and\nover during a particular day,\nthen you're, like driving,\nlike I've had where I was\ndriving like three or four hours\nand then I'd go to bed and\nI dream about myself driving\nand things like that where,\nso that's another example of yeah,\nof something that, but yeah.\n- Yeah. Let's transfer into\nmore interesting experiences\nof sleep, so things like sleep paralysis\nand lucid dreaming now.\nBut before we do,\nI just want to give a\nthank you to Nancy Gee\nfor being our new member.\nIt's our members that allow us\nto make these streams possible.\nSo thank you very much.\nAnd yeah. So for sleep paralysis,\nwe definitely have a lot\nof questions for these.\nI think it might be a good\nplan to just give our viewers\nan idea of what sleep paralysis is\nfor those who don't know or who thought\nfor those who are just\ncurious to learn more.\n- Yeah. Yeah.\nSo sleep paralysis is a\nvery interesting phenomenon\nand affects about 20% of the population\nwe've had at least one of these episodes.\nSo it didn't sort of entails\nyou being paralyzed during\nat, you know, waking up from\nsleep or falling asleep,\nwhich is the technical definition.\nBut like typically you would be sleeping\nand then you realize my\nGod, I'm actually awake.\nI can see my surroundings, but\nI can't move. I can't speak.\nSo I'm paralyzed.\nAnd then you might feel\nlike there's a shadow\nor being from the corner of\nthe room approaching you,\npressing on your chest and yeah,\nyou might see shadow like creatures.\nAnd so it has this basic,\nyou know, experience to it,\nbut we call phenomenology\nof like you being paralyzed\nupon on falling asleep\nor awakening and then yeah.\nBeing able to move or speak, yeah.\nSo it's quite interesting\nand in spooky experience.\n- Are there any triggers\nthat can give rise\nto someone be more likely\nto have sleep paralysis?\n- Yeah. So there are triggers.\nSo sleep paralysis. So let me just, yes.\nIf you have the sort of fragmented sleep.\nSo if your sleep is fragmented,\nif you have anxiety,\npeople that drink alcohol\nand things like that,\ncollege students who are stressed\ntend to have higher rates,\nthere's a genetic component\nthat would push you\ninto waking up during REM.\nSo this phenomenon, just to be clear,\nit occurs out of REM sleep, right?\nSo as we mentioned, during REM sleep,\nyou are paralyzed from head to toe, right?\nSo you can't move. You cannot speak.\nNow, and that paralysis\noccurs because structures\nin the lower part of your\nbrain are paralyzing you\nas we mentioned, preventing\nyou from acting out\nyour dreams and hurting yourself.\nNow, occasionally for some reason,\nthat's actually not completely known\nand your perceptual part\nof the brain can start becoming active\nand you start being perceptually awake,\neven though you're physically in REM sleep\nin the sense that you are paralyzed.\nAnd so you have this\ncollision between sort\nof the waking world perception,\ncolliding with the REM physiology.\nSo you have these two worlds colliding.\nAnd then on top of that,\nyou can then have what we would\ncall REM mentation or dream,\nthe dream world projecting\ninto your wakeful world.\nSo the world of dreams,\nyou technically dreaming with\nyour eyes open in that situation,\nwhich is quite, you know, peculiar.\nSo that's what it is. But yes,\ndefinitely these triggers,\nthese things I mentioned could lead you\nto have more sleep paralysis.\nAnd we've done research\naround the world on this,\nI think at like five or six countries now.\nAnd it's a really deep\nphenomenon people around\nthe world explains sleep\nparalysis in different ways.\nSo in Italy, people will talk\nabout, in some parts of Italy,\npeople will talk about pandafrica,\nwhich is like a witch or a giant cat\nthat comes at night attacks you.\nIn Egypt, it's something called the gene\nor the evil genius of like a Latin.\nif you've seen that cartoon.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah, so that's the Egyptian version.\nAnd in Denmark, people just say\nit's stress physiology\nanxiety, things like that.\nThat's how people, Denmark\ntends to explain it.\nAnd then yeah, in the\nUS in some populations,\npeople will talk about\nspace alien abduction,\nyou're lying you're paralyzed,\nunable to move or speak.\nSo that's subgroup in the\nUS we'll talk about that.\nSo there are these\nexplanations, but interestingly,\nwhat our research shows is that\nif you have fearful, terrifying, you know,\nexplanations for sleep paralysis,\nwell, that can affect your, you\nknow, the experience itself.\nIt can have like, you know,\nlike the placebo effect,\nyou know, I'll tell you\ndrink some water Monica,\nand this water is like super juice.\nYou drink it and you become\nlike super strong, well,\nthis is the opposite. You know,\nthis is called the\nnocebo or nocebo effect.\nI tell you'll die from taking\nthis pill, which is just,\nyou know, salt or whatever.\nIt's not really anything,\nthen you're you react to it.\nSo, similarly, we think that\nbecause of these explanations,\nit's very exotic elaborate explanation\nfor sleep paralysis. A lot of, you know,\nit can lead to the experience becoming\nmuch more profound in ways. And\nI'm happy to go into detail.\nDo you want me to go explain\nwhat our research shows or.\n- Yeah, I think that'd be wonderful.\n(cross talk draws out speakers)\n- Okay. All right. Very cool.\nSo basically it's something like this.\nSo we found that I really wanted\nto look at Egypt because it's a place with\na lot of, you know spiritual traditions\ngoing back to the pharaohs and all that,\nyou know, magic and mystery.\nAnd Denmark is typically more\nof sort of a secular place.\nPeople are irrational.\nI grew up in Denmark. I love\nDenmark and I love Egypt.\nI've spent time there too.\nOkay. So it turns out in Egypt,\npeople have excessive fiercely paralysis\nbecause of some of the\ncultural explanations.\nSo they will, you know,\n50% of people will say that\nthey can die from sleep paralysis.\nSo it's much more terrifying\nand fearful in that way.\nBut it also turns out that people in Egypt\nwill have sleep paralysis\nthree times more frequently.\nSo the people who have sleep\nparalysis have a three times\nmore often than people from Denmark\nand also their perceived\nlink of the paralysis,\nmeaning how long they\nthink they're paralyzed\nis significantly longer\nthan the Danish people.\nSo it turns out, it seems\nfrom their understanding,\ntheir minds have changed the experience\ninto something much\nmore fearful, frequent,\nand salient, emotionally,\nyou know powerful.\nAnd what we think might\nbe going on is something\nI usually explain by\nthe little Lisa example.\nSo let me tell you what I mean,\nthis little Lisa example is the following.\nSo if you live in a culture, okay,\nlet's say this far away fictitious island.\nThere's this little girl. Okay.\nShe's called little Lisa.\nAnd she's sitting by the dining table\nand having dinner with her grandmother.\nAnd the grandmother\nsays, look, little Lisa,\nthere's this monster coming at night.\nOkay. It looks like\nthis and this and this.\nOkay. It has long bangs is like,\nyou know, it has, you know,\nit looks, you know, specific features.\nYou know, it looks like\nthis and that it will come.\nIt will choke you, strangle you,\ndo all these things to you, right?\nNow little Lisa is\nterrified. She's scared now.\nShe goes and mind you,\nshe has never experienced sleep paralysis\nin her entire life.\nShe goes to bed now and she\nexperienced sleep paralysis\nfor the first time. Okay.\nWhat's going on? All right.\nSo it turns out by you sleeping\nand having anxiety and what\nwe call nocturnal arousal,\nmeaning the emotional part\nof your brain is overactive.\nThen it itself can push\nthem to have sleep paralysis\nand wake up during REM sleep. Okay?\nSo there's a correlation.\nThere's a link between\nyou having brain activity\nin the emotional part\nand waking up during REM\nand having sleep paralysis.\nThat's the first thing.\nSecond, you are expecting\nsleep paralysis to occur,\nyou are in a way prime to having it.\nSo this is a form of confirmatory serving\nof your body and bodily sensation.\nSo you're lying there.\nLisa is lying there in serving.\nIf anything's holding her down,\nanything is pressing on her chest\nor pressing on her body\nand so she will try to win.\nAnd when she then suddenly\nfeel something, you know,\nin her body as being\nstiff, she will wake up.\nAnd when she then wakes up,\nshe's paralyzed during REM,\nshe will try to move and\nwhen she tries to move,\nshe might see whatever\nher culture dictates\nin terms of what the\nhallucinations might look like.\nSo she will see that ghost\nor that monster or whatever\nthat her grandmother was talking about.\nAnd she wakes up the next\nday, she's terrified.\nShe will go tell other people\nand her friends in school,\nI saw this monster. It\nlooks like this and that.\nAnd they will also start\nperhaps hallucinating, you know,\nhaving the same type of\nsleep paralysis occur,\nand little Lisa will be more\nterrified for the next night\nand the third night and the fourth night.\nSo she'll have it even more.\nAnd then by a month later,\nshe might even be predisposed to anxiety\nand chronic, you know,\nperhaps maybe even PTSD from\nthese kinds of experiences.\nAnd that's what our research\nsuggests that these cultures,\nItaly, for example, we\nfound that sleep paralysis,\nhaving this experience was\nassociated with things like,\nyou know, trauma, things like, you know,\nanxiety and in Italy as well.\nWe found a similar pattern\nin Italy where people\nhave cultural explanations.\nDoes this make sense?\nOr am I stress rambling\nyour, what did you think?\n- No, I think it's very fascinating.\nIt really goes to show that\nneuroscience is truly not\nan isolated discipline.\nIt borrows a lot from\neven philosophy I think\nand psychology and it\nblends it all together\nand gives each person a unique experience\nbecause ultimately everyone's different.\nEveryone has gone through different things\nand for Lisa it might be this.\nAnd who knows maybe for like Baland,\nthey might have a different experience.\nSo it's very interesting to\nsee in different contexts,\nhow people interpret the same situation.\n- Absolutely, no, it's very true.\nYou know how these things work\nand it's certainly interesting to see how\nyour culture dictates the things,\nbut at the same time,\nI want to add here that there also seems\nto be a strong neurological component\nin terms of explaining why people\nhave certain hallucinations, right?\nSo I have theories for\nwhy people see shadow,\nlike beings, why, you know,\npeople have out-of-body\nexperiences and it has to do\nwith those structures in\nthe brain that, you know,\nare creating a sense of\nI, sense of self, right?\nAnd so during sleep\nparalysis, you're paralyzed,\nunable to move or speak.\nAnd so your first reaction\nthere is to try to move,\ntry to sort of get out of there.\nSo your brain will send all\nthese signals for you to move,\nbut there's no feedback\ncoming back to your body,\nhelping you to create a sense of self\nin those parts of the brain.\nAnd so this to sync, sort\nof this, the synchrony,\nor this sort of mismatching\nof neural signals, your\nyou know, signals going out move,\nbut no proprioceptive feedback,\nmeaning feedback from your\nlimbs, from your joins,\nfrom muscle telling your brain\nhow to create a sense of self.\nI hope this portion of too complicated\nis more simple in the\nsense that your sense\nof self gets distorted.\nAnd it explains why people\nnot only will have like,\nsee shadow like beings,\nbut they will also often\nI've had those hallucinations\nduring sleep paralysis\nor visions or whatever\nwhen you see your legs\nflying up in the air,\nor you seeing yourself slightly, you know,\nflying outside yourself,\nor I've had a copy of\nmyself hovering over me\nand having a chat with him\nand out of body experience.\nAnd so all of this is a part of\nthe sleep paralysis experience itself\nbeing heavily distorted. So, yeah.\n- Yeah. Let's talk further about\nthis whole experience of dreams\nso hope we can shift into questions\nthat we have about lucid dreaming.\nSo before we do so,\nwe have a new member\nGypsy thank you so much\nfor being member on skeptical\nlike to go YouTube channel.\nJesse has actually asked the\nquestion before we shift.\nDo you believe it's possible when we sleep\nin our consciousness could cause us\nto get sucked into someone else's body.\nI think that's very interesting.\nIs it a perception? Yeah.\n- So I wanna, can you\nsay that again Monica.\n- Yeah, I think that question\nis probably asking more about\nhow real it is that there's the perception\nin sleep paralysis that\nyou can get like sucked\ninto someone else's body.\nI'm not quite sure exactly,\nbut if you have any thoughts\non that, you can comment,\notherwise we can see if Gypsy\nhave any other kind of way to rephrase it.\nSo I'm fine with either.\nWhat are your thoughts?\n- Yeah. So I think that\nthe thing is with that\nit's a great question in a sense, right?\nSo the sense of self is sort of is flow.\nIt's you feel like you're\nfloating outside your body\nand things like that.\nSo it gets to the question of whether\nthis is how the self\nis constructed, right?\nSo as a neuroscientist,\nwe would say that well,\nbecause your sense of self is loosened up.\nThen of course we wouldn't\nsay that you can be sucked\ninto somebody else's body per se,\nbecause there's no mechanism in the brain,\nbut certainly from a\nperception point of view,\nyou know, you might feel\nlike you are, you know,\ngoing into somebody\nelse's body, hope that...\n- Yeah, I hope that answered\nyour question Gypsy,\nif you have any more specific\nthings or any follow-up,\nthen please let us know\nin the comments section\nI'm monitoring it. So for\nany of you just joined,\nyou can still ask questions\nthere will be very happy\nto tackle them in our\nlast 15 minutes or so.\nAnd yeah, so Gypsy just\nsent a follow-up saying\nthat she experienced being sucked\ninto someone's body and\nstarted to experience\nwhat was happening to her.\nThat is like very scary, isn't it?\n- It's very scary. Yeah.\nSo I think it's the idea of\nthe subjective self, right?\nAnd what's going on.\nAnd what I want to add here is\nthat during sleep paralysis,\nand this is during my own sleep\nparalysis experiences too.\nSo you and I Monica had a chat\nabout this a long time ago,\nwhere actually my first\nsleep paralysis episode\nthat I had as I was\ncoming out of high school,\nI had this very vivid experience of like,\nI felt like it was a\nghost in my room trying\nto choke me and all that.\nAnd it was so real, right?\nIt was as real as this conversation,\nI felt like you and I are\nhaving, so the question was,\nhow do you you know that\nit's not the real world\nversus this other world, right?\n- Yeah.\n- Always this idea of subjective\nreality and then physical,\nyou know, scientific, the\nworld that we're living in\nthat we can observe and measure.\nNow, the question is during\nthe subjective experiences,\nwe will try to explain\nthat in terms of science,\nbut there's still a strong,\nsubjective component to it.\nLike, and what does that mean in itself?\nNow we can try to explain\nthat in scientific terms,\nbut people have their own\nsubjective experiences\nof the world that is hard to\nargue with at the same time,\neven though you give\nit descriptive meaning,\nlike I mentioned before,\nI say that, you know,\nyour dreams mean this and that,\nbut it's not negating\nthat it could not have\na spiritual meaning of sorts,\nbut it's not negating that it could still\nhave a deeper meaning as well.\nYou know, but the point is\nthere is this subjective,\nand there's the third\nperson's scientific view.\nAnd as a scientist, I just\nstick to the scientific point\nof view but yes, you know,\nit's not to negate the\npersonal subjective experience\nof things feeling very real, of course.\n- So let's talk about the\nscience of lucid dreaming.\nIt's a very interesting thing.\nSometimes my sister would\ntell me how she knows\nthat she's dreaming and\nthat she can have control\nof what she wants to do.\nBut for me, I've never\nexperienced lucid dreaming.\nI think it'd be super\ninteresting to be able to do so.\nSo I was thinking maybe we\ncan start off with telling\nthe audience what lucid dream are\nand are there any ways to kind of induce\nthis very realistic sense\nor sensation of dreaming.\n- It's yeah a great question.\nLucid dreams are intriguing, right?\nI mean here to find yourself\nthen in these strange worlds,\nthese bizarre landscapes,\nbut yet you are aware that it's a dream.\nLike, you know, oh my God, I'm dreaming.\nSo I can therefore, you\nknow, manipulate this world.\nI can meet people I want to meet.\nI can engage in dreams and\nfantasies that I've had, right?\nPeople fly, people meet\npeople that they wanna meet\nand do all kinds of things.\nSo it's really a magical\nand wondrous world.\nI have certainly found\nmyself in those dreams.\nAs I remember as a kid,\nwhen I first had sort of dreams like that,\nit started with me saying to myself,\nI wanted to fly in my dream,\nI wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly.\nThis was how I started as a\nkid, you know, I wanna fly.\nAnd so I slept.\nAnd then just one day I\nmagically realized my God,\nI can actually, I know that\nI'm dreaming and I can fly now.\nAnd like Peter Pan,\nI was just flying all\naround for the landscape\nand looking down, it was\namazing. Right? It feels so good.\nAnd so since then I've had\nlucid dreams once in a while\nand it turns out I dream with\ndreaming that you can fly.\nIt's one of the most\ncommon themes in lucid,\nwell, of lucid dream. So\nwhat are lucid dreams?\nWhat are they about?\nWell, it turns out it's the\ncortex part of the brain,\nthe frontal, the logical\npart of the brain.\nRemember I mentioned that\nyour sense of awareness\nand logic goes away that we mentioned\nthe dorsolateral prefrontal\ncortex, whatnot, right?\nSo those structures are\nimportant for agency knowing,\nbeing aware of yourself\nand they go away during\nthe REM dreams. Right?\nSo that's why you don't\nknow that you're dreaming\nwhen you're dreaming,\nbut occasionally for some reason\nthey can be activated prematurely\nand then you'll find yourself\nin this dream where, you know,\nyou can influence things\nand can you induce these?\nWell, it all turns out by just\ntelling yourself, you know,\nI want to know that it's a dream, right?\nThat's a way to do it, right?\nOr tell yourself if I meet,\nyou know, or you can use light cues.\nSo people have got like\ngoggles they will use,\nand then seeing certain light\nflashing before their eyes.\nAnd that can help them, you know, wake up.\nSo there's actually a\ncommercial product, you know\nthe USA to do everything,\nyou know, whatever you think.\nSo there's like, there's a\nproduct where you see light,\nand then that will help you remember, oh,\nwhen I see like three flashes of light,\nthat means I'm in a dream.\nSo remember now, something like that.\nSo those are all things\nand typically people will,\nif they see like William\nShakespeare or something like\nthat relative, that can help them remember\nit's only a dream and\nthen they become lucid.\nBut yeah, lucid dreams\nare fascinating, you know,\nfascinating world.\n- Yeah, definitely on\nthe topic of lucid dreams\nor interesting experiences during dreams,\nwe have a new member, Eleanor,\nthank you for being a member.\nHe has mentioned about the experience\nof having dreams within dreams\nwhich essentially is this,\nto mention that she will\ndream that she falls asleep\nand then dream inside a dream.\nIs there a kind of\ninteresting interpretation\nof this or yeah, neuroscience thing.\n- Well, it's a neuroscience, so yeah.\nIt's a great question how this works.\nWell, let me tell you dreams within dreams\nit's a very curious phenomenon\nand I've had that, I've\nhad dreams and then\na dream within that dream.\nSo I was, you know, in that,\nso I was in a dream and then I\nhad another dream within that\nand then a third layer. So\nI've gone down three layers.\nAnd the thing about it is\nfascinating when you wake up,\nyou know, you think you're awake,\nyou know, awake but it's still a dream.\nAnd he said, oh my God,\nI had this other dream.\nIt was so amazing. But now I'm awake.\nWhat a magical great dream I had,\nbut then you're actually\nstill inside the dream.\nAnd then you wake up, you know\nhere, in this world, right?\nWhere you realize all this all layers.\nSo what's going on in the brain.\nI think it's a good question.\nI don't think it's known what is going on\nin terms of the circuitry,\nwhy, you know have that\ndream, but I've had dreams,\nalso I've had dreams, I only\nremembered in other dreams,\nso I will have like a dream\nand then I forget about it seemingly,\nand then I wake up that\nI have another dream\nand I remember that other dream,\nor I had a dream like two weeks.\nAnd I only remember that, you know,\nso almost like those\ncircuits are only activated\nin another dream.\nSo that's another really weird phenomenon.\nBut let me tell you this,\nthe dream world is fascinating\nand it's strange because look,\nI've had a dream where I woke myself up\nfrom laughter during a\ndream. So I had a joke.\nSo I was sitting and chatting\nwith this chat in my dream.\nSo we were having a chat, you know,\nand this guy told me a joke\nand I woke myself up from laughter.\nSo I would ha ha ha you\nknow, it's so funny,\nand this is all, I burst out in laughter\nand I woke up and I said,\nwell, what's happening.\nIt was just a dream, but\nwhen you think about it,\na dream is only funny\nor jokes or excuse me,\nit's only funny when you don't know\nthe punchline of the joke.\nThat's what makes the joke funny. Right?\nSo you have a certain story plot,\nand then you have the punchline,\nbut you have to not know\nthe whole story plot,\nyou know, the whole\nthing before it's funny.\nBut the other guy in my dream presumably,\nwas myself telling me a joke\nand my brain was suppressing\nthe information of the joke in order\nto make it funny to me\nand then wake me up.\nSo it's strange how the brain works\nin layers like this, and yeah,\nso absolutely the dream\nhas the dream world\nand the brain has all\nthese interesting layers.\nAnd when you think about it,\nwhen you have a meaningful conversation\nwith someone in your\ndream, I've had those.\nSo I've had dreams with\nsort of really intense,\nmeaningful conversations\nwith people in my dreams,\nbut, you know, my brain was\ncreating a theory of mind\nor constructing agency into that being\nand aligned that person to have\na meaningful conversation with me.\nSo it was me having a meaningful\nconversation with myself\nand that way, so yes,\nit's quite astonishing.\n- Yeah. I remember only, I\nthink three of my dreams,\nlike in my entire life, I\nknow I've got more than that,\nbut it's very interesting to kind of see\nand analyze the themes\nof the dreams I've had.\nI've had one dream about\nvisiting different universities.\nI have no idea why probably because\nyou need such a big part of my life,\nanother dream about\nliterally eating chocolate\nand being able to taste\nit, like I could taste it.\nIt felt so real. It was amazing frankly.\n- Oh, that is amazing, yeah.\nWhen you taste something, what was it\nSo you've only remembered three dreams\nin your life without her.\n- Yeah, I'm sure it's\na bit of a recency bias\n'cause all of these were\nreally in the past month or so.\nI forgot about everything before\nand it's just very interesting.\nIt seems kind of random, but lastly,\nI had a dream that I was in London.\nI have no idea. It's just, it's crazy\nbut soon thinking about\nit. I realized that yeah,\nyou need a big part of my life.\nI love chocolate and I love London.\nSo it kind of makes sense.\n- Are you a heavy sleeper?\nI suppose you're very heavy\nsleepers. Is that right?\n- I'm actually not sure.\nI think in the middle\nof the night, of course,\nI think nothing can wake me up,\nbut close to around the morning,\nI feel like I hear things.\nI hear people talking.\nI don't know if it's actually\na dream or if it's real life,\nbut I do hear people talking\nthat eventually wakes me up.\n- Yeah, from my recollection, it turns out\nit's people that are heavy sleepers\nthat don't remember\ntheir dreams less. Right?\nSo they usually say (indistinct)\nyeah drink more water,\nbig cup of water before you go to bed,\nthen that can help you\nremember your dreams\nis some, you know people\nsay that sometimes,\nbut yes interestingly about\nnot remembering your dreams\nand sort of yeah, that\nwhole world, isn't it?\nIt's quite something.\nI was trying to say\nsomething, but I forgot.\nIt just slipped my mind\nright now, but yeah.\n- Yeah, I always love to\nhear what people generally,\nthe're things they dream\nbecause it's really interesting\nto see how it correlates\nwith their life. Right?\nLike super interesting.\nSo if any of our viewers\nhave any interesting themes\nor things that just keep coming up,\njust let us know in the chat\nand I'll respond to them\nafter the live stream.\nBut yeah, let's end this\non a very creative note.\nAnd for those who want to\nlearn more about neuroscience\nor psychology or receive some expertise\nthrough Dr. Jalal video,\nplease check out our\ndescription box because\nI linked his YouTube channel\nand other social media links there.\nSo please follow him if\nyou like this content.\nAnd also let us know in\nthe comments section,\nwhat you want to see next,\nas I'm very excited to be able\nto host more Ask An Expert live streams,\nabout topics that you want to learn about.\nSo with that, thank you\nso much for watching.\nThank you so much Dr. Jalal for joining.\n- My pleasure being with you.\n- Yeah. We'll see you all in\nthe comments section, bye.\n- Bye-bye."
