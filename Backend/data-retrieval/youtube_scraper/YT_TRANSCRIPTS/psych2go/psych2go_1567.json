    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nBefore we start, we would\nlike to thank you all\nfor the support that you've given us.\nPsych2Go's mission is to make\npsychology and mental health\nmore accessible to everyone,\nand you help us do that.\nSo, thank you.\nNow, back to the video.\nHave you ever met someone who\nis very sure of themselves?\nThese are people who\nexude a certain degree\nof comfort or assuredness,\nwho have the ability to\ninstill a sense of security\nand comfort in others.\nBut, what's their secret?\nWell, it just may be\ntheir self-confidence.\nThe word confidence comes from\nthe Latin root, confidere,\nwhich means to have full trust in.\nThese people have trust in themselves\nand in their abilities.\nConfidence can inspire\nchange in action and others.\nIt provides an element of clarity\nin the most unclear situations.\nSo, how do you become more confident?\nHere are six daily habits\nthat confident people have.\nNumber one.\nKeep your promises.\nBroken promises can cause\na lot of painful emotions.\nBut broken promises made with yourself\ncan be the most harmful.\nPerhaps you promised\nyourself to be healthier,\nbut put off working out\nor avoid eating well.\nYou might say, \"Hm, I'll\njust do it tomorrow,\"\nbut tomorrow can carry\nforward a day, a week,\nor even a year.\nFailing to meet personal commitments\ncan lessen the value of your words\nand diminish your self-worth.\nYou are subconsciously sending\nyourself a powerful message\nthat you are no longer a priority.\nSo, it's important to learn\nto hold yourself accountable\nfor what you say.\nWhen that happens, you can start\nrebuilding your self-esteem\nand self-confidence.\nNumber two.\nSay and do what you mean.\nDo you say and do what you\nmean and mean what you say?\nConfident people act and\nspeak with integrity.\nTheir words match their\nactions and vice versa.\nThey have clear morals and priorities,\nand understand when to\ncompromise and when to say no.\nA study from the University\nof California, San Francisco\nfound that the more difficulty\nyou have in saying no,\nthe more likely you are to\ndevelop burnout or depression.\nSo, to act based on your values\nand not what you believe\nothers might think of you\nis a step to becoming more confident.\nNumber three.\nStop running away from your fears.\nAre you always anxious?\nOne of the most useful habits\nconfident people have developed\nis their ability to overcome their fears.\nWhile fear is an essential part of life\nand can be useful to ensure survival,\ntoo much of it produces anxiety.\nConfident people have learned\nthat fear can be a tool\nto push you to acts of\ngreatness or change.\nAccepting your fears can trick your brain\nout of the fight or flight system,\nand give you control over your fear.\nWhen you learn to embrace\nyour fears and move past them,\nyou are on the road to\nbecoming more confident.\nNumber four.\nDon't compare yourself to others.\nDo you spend hours on end\nscrolling through your social media,\ncomparing yourself to others online?\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt once said,\n\"Comparison is the thief of joy.\"\nWhen you constantly look at\nother people and their success,\nyou end up focusing on your\nown imperfections and flaws.\nYou don't allow yourself\nto see the vastness of your potential\nand all the good qualities you hold.\nThis habit can easily de-motivate you\nand harm your self-esteem\nand self-confidence.\nNumber five.\nAssertively, state your case.\nDo you tend to put up with\nother's wants and needs\nbefore your own?\nIf so, your self-esteem and\nself-worth may be suffering.\nIn a world filled with noise\nand many different opinions,\nit's hard to make your voice heard.\nAs a result, it's easy to\nfall into the trap of thinking\nthat you have to please everyone.\nConfident people know and honor this.\nIt's why they make it a habit\nto speak with conviction and assertion\nbecause they understand\nthat their ideas will\nnot be noticed otherwise.\nLearn how to communicate\nyour ideas and needs\nrespectfully and honestly,\nand people will listen.\nAnd number six, don't\nbe afraid to be wrong.\nAre you afraid to be proven wrong?\nDo you tend to argue with\nothers until they concede?\nConfident people are\nconfident in their abilities\nas well as their faults.\nThey understand that they cannot achieve\nor know everything, and\nthey're comfortable with that.\nInstead of seeing failure\nas a personal snub,\nthey see it as an opportunity for growth.\nSo to be able to admit that\nyou're wrong sometimes,\nand to use it as an opportunity to learn\nis a step towards building confidence.\nDo you follow any of the\nhabits we've mentioned?\nLet
