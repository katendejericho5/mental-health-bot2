    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey,\nPsych2Goers, and welcome back.\nDepression does not look\nthe same in everyone.\nDid you know depression can\nlook different in teens?\nIts manifestation is\nknown to be influenced\nby several factors, external and internal,\none of them being age.\nThe adolescent brain is very plastic,\nthat is, teenagers and\nadolescents go through\na huge developmental\nperiod in their brains\nduring this time.\nThese changes are also paired\nwith life stress unique to adolescence\nand a brain that is not fully developed.\nThis means that some\nmental health conditions\nsuch as depression may\nmanifest differently\nin teenagers versus adults,\nbut it in no way means that\nthey are any less significant.\nIn this video,\nwe're going to explore some\nsigns of depression in teens.\nSo with that said, here\nare 10 warning signs\nof depression in teens.\nNumber one, more irritability.\nWhy do some teens seem to\nstruggle with their temper?\nThe teenage brain is already\nprone to mood swings.\nWith so much forming and changing,\nthey can have a hard time\nregulating emotions as it is.\nAnd with depression, these\nmood changes can heighten.\nAccording to an article\nfrom Verywell Mind,\nirritability and defiance\nare much more common\nin depressed teens than depressed adults.\nThis may be because adults\nare generally more equipped\nto handle stronger emotions\nand are therefore less\nprone to acting out.\nNumber two, sensitivity to criticism.\nDo you know a teen who avoids taking risks\nin fear of criticism?\nThis may be a result of increased\nsensitivity to criticism,\nwhich is common in teenage depression.\nAs reported in a study by Morrin in 2020,\nit's normal to be a little nervous\nabout what someone might say.\nHowever, depressed teens may\nfind themselves so afraid\nthat they avoid doing\nsomething they really love.\nThough the exact reason isn't clear,\nthis may have something to\ndo with the lower levels\nof self-confidence and self-worth\nthat come along with depression.\nIt's important to notice that\nteens who find themselves\nin this spot aren't just lazy or insecure.\nThere might be something\nmore to this story.\nNumber three, staying\nin their rooms a lot.\nDo you know a teenager\nwho only seems to come out\nof their room for meals?\nDo they seem to disappear\nthroughout the day?\nThis may be a sign of depression.\nA common sign of depression\nin adults and teens is social isolation.\nFor many teens, your rooms are primarily\nwhat you consider to be your space,\nand that tends to be where you isolate.\nIt's not that you don't wanna see others\nor to be around them,\nbut more so that your\ndepression may be forcing you\nto only feel at ease when you're alone.\nNumber four, selective social withdrawal.\nDo you know a teen who seems to withdraw\nfrom certain people but not others?\nIt turns out that depressed\nteens tend to socially withdraw\nmore selectively than adults.\nTypically depressed teens might\nhold onto close friendships\nand relationships and isolate from family.\nAdults, by contrast, tend\nto isolate an equal amount\nfrom almost all of the\nrelationships in their lives.\nNumber five, throwing\nthemselves into work.\nDo you know a teen\nwho seems to bury\nthemselves in schoolwork?\nDoes it seem like they\nspend a long time working?\nThere are multiple reasons for this,\nbut among other things,\nthis could be a sign\nof teenage depression.\nDistraction is a common coping\nmechanism for depression,\nand teens often have\na heavy plate of work.\nThus, some of you resort\nto temporarily distracting\nyourself with assignments,\neven those that might\nnot be due any time soon.\nNumber six, slipping grades.\nOn the flip side, another common\nsign of depression in teens\nis that their grades might slip.\nOn the outside, this\nmay look like laziness,\nbut this could be a sign\nof something bigger.\nSchoolwork is demanding,\nand depression can take a toll\non someone's mental state.\nTherefore, if a teenager's\ngrades are slipping,\nit might be because depression\nis taking away the energy\nand motivation for them to do their best.\nNumber seven, harder time focusing.\nDo you or does a teen you know\nseem to have a harder time\nconcentrating than normal?\nWith anything from schoolwork to hobbies,\na harder time focusing on\neveryday tasks could be a sign\nof teenage depression.\nAccording to Smith and others\nin a study published in 2020,\ndepression can be very energy-consuming.\nAnd as a result,\nmany teens find it harder\nand harder to concentrate,\neven on things that would\nnormally capture their attention.\nLike other signs on this list,\nit's important not to assume laziness\nif you notice this in yourself\nor in a teen around you.\nDifficulty concentrating could be a sign\nof not only depression but a\nnumber of mental health issues\nthat are not your fault.\nNumber eight, changes in energy.\nDoes a teen close to you appear suddenly\nmore restless or sluggish?\nBoth of these changes in energy\ncould be signs of depression.\nAccording to Stanford Children's Health,\nsluggishness in depressed teens shows up\nin their speech, reactions, and movement.\nThe same article explained\nthat depression-related\nrestlessness can look like fidgeting\nor acting up publicly.\nA consistent change in energy\nor out-of-character behavior\ncould indicate an issue\nbeneath the surface.\nNumber nine, changes in daily habits.\nDo you notice different eating\nor sleeping patterns in a teen?\nSimilar to adults,\nchanges in sleep and\nappetite are common signs\nof teenage depression.\nWhether eating and sleeping\ntoo much or too little,\nteens with depression often\nfind themselves taking less care\nof their health and wellbeing.\nEvery once in a while,\ncatching up on sleep\nor not feeling as hungry\nis totally normal.\nHowever, a consistent\nshift to unhealthy habits\ncould be a sign of something larger.\nAnd number 10, physical pains.\nDid you know that depressed\nteens tend to have\nmore pronounced physical\npain than depressed adults?\nAccording to HelpGuide,\ndepressed teens tend to be more impacted\nby aches and pains than depressed adults.\nThese physical pains can be anywhere\nin the body and seem spontaneous.\nStomachaches, headaches, and cramping\nthroughout the body are\nall equally possible.\nIf you or a teen you\nknow continues to ache\nwithout any other physical condition,\nit could be a physical\nmanifestation of depression.\nRegardless of age,\ndepression is a very real\nand very serious mental illness\nthat can creep onto you silently.\nTherefore, it helps to keep\nan eye out for its snare.\nBut you don't have to\nfight it all on your own.\nDon't be afraid to ask for help\nnor let the stigmas attached deter you.\nNo matter how bad it\ngets, there's always hope\nthat things can get better.\nReaching out to a\npsychologist or a counselor\nand getting the help you need\ncan not only improve your life\nbut also encourage others to break away\nfrom the stigmas to seek help.\nWe hope we were able to\ngive you some insight\ninto common signs of teenage depression\nand how it may differ\nfrom depression in adults.\nDid we miss anything?\nWhat are some other areas\nit manifests differently?\nLeave a comment down below\nand
