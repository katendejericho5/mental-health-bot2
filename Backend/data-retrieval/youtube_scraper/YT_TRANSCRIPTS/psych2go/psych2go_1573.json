    "transcript": "It might seem like a visual\ndepiction of the quote,\neat-work-repeat.\nYou wake up early,\ngo to school or work,\nrest.\nAnd the cycle continues\nday in and day out.\nIf you're looking to take back\nsome control over your life,\nhere are six small habits that\ncan change your life forever.\nNumber one, a gratefulness list.\nDo you feel like you forget things easily?\nAnd that moment you try to remember them,\nit just escapes your memory?\nIt's hard for your memory\nto store every moment of your waking life.\nTime can lead you to forget\nabout some of the things\nthat you had once cared about.\nMaybe a stranger complimented\nyour hair once, a week ago,\nor your teacher commended you\nfor submitting a great project.\nWeeks later,\nthese things all fall into\nthe recesses of your brain\nand are forgotten completely.\nA psychologist from the\nUniversity of California\ndid some research and\nit showed that people\nwho write about things\nthey're grateful for\nare more optimistic and feel\nbetter about their lives.\nIt can even lead you to take\naction more, like exercising,\nwhich further improves\nmental health and wellbeing.\nToday's video is sponsored by Fabulous,\nthe number one self-care app\nto help you build better\nhabits and achieve your goals.\nFabulous helps in making your day to day\nby setting positive habits\nand building a productive lifestyle.\nThis app not only increases your energy,\nbut also your sleep and\nkeeps you on track overall.\nYou can also reach your goals\nby following a step-by-step program\nthrough the five healthy living habits.\nNot to mention, this app\nstands out from the rest\nas it presents itself in an\nartistic and creative way\njust like the animations here at Psych2go.\nLet's start with creating\na journey roadmap.\nFirst off, pick a journey\nbased on your goals,\nwhether it be drinking more water,\nfeeling more energized,\nor having a better sleep.\nNow, follow your roadmap step by step.\nOn the top, it even shows\nyou the completion percent\nand events achieved.\nHave you noticed yet\nhow easy it is to use?\nDid you know Fabulous also\ncomes with daily coaching?\nThese three-minute coaching sessions\nhave been written by Jasmine Quill,\nwho co-founded the Psychology\nOne program at Stanford,\nwinning the university's highest award\nfor distinctive and exceptional\ncontributions to education.\nAlthough it is only three minutes,\nit asks you questions such as,\nwere you able to accomplish your goals\nand what were you able to learn today?\nMost importantly, they have the circle,\nwhich is a community used to pledge,\nhelp and support others around you.\nThey also send you daily motivations\nand you can leave questions\nto connect with others around you.\nOverall, Fabulous features\ncolorful illustrations,\nmotivational quotes, rich features,\nand aims to improve your daily routine.\nStart building your\nideal daily routine now.\nThe first

spending\non social media platforms lately?\nIs it day after day of scrolling?\nIn the face of the pandemic,\nmore people than ever\nlook to their phone\nscreens and social media\nfor their social fix.\nBut alongside it,\nmany negative aspects have arisen\nsuch as feelings of inadequacy, FOMO,\nfeelings of isolation and self absorption.\nA 2018 U Penn study found\nthat reducing social media\nto 30 minutes a day\ncan significantly reduce\nfeelings of anxiety, depression,\nand sleep problems.\nIt doesn't mean you have to\ncut back on it all at once,\nbut even just a slight time reduction\ncan already bring great benefits.\nAccording to statistics,\nonly a small percentage of\nyou who watch our videos\nare actually subscribed.\nSo if you haven't and\nat the end of the video,\nyou enjoy what

you tidied up your room recently?\nDoes your workspace look neatly organized\nor are things sprawled all over?\nWorking in a clean room can\ngive both your mind and body\na whole host of benefits.\nThese benefits include\nimproved sleep quality,\nincreased productivity, and\na sense of accomplishment.\nIf your room is messier\nthan you would like,\nit's advisable to try\nand divide your process\ninto more manageable chunks\nto make it feel less daunting.\nA little bit of effort can go a long way.\nThrow in some good music\nand you're all set for the adventure.\nNumber four, the 80/20 principle.\nEver heard of the 80/20 principle?\nVilfredo Pareto first\nintroduced the 80/20 principle,\nwhich laid out the idea\nthat 20% of homeowners\nown 80% of the land.\nThe same principles\napply to your daily life.\nOnly 20% of the work that you do\ncontributes to 80% of your success.\nThis means a big chunk of what you do\nis not relevant to your success.\nTo identify the 20%, you\ncould start with a list\nof everything you'd like to accomplish\nwith the most important tasks at the top.\nIt helps you recognize the top\n20% and focus on those tasks.\nWith that, you can improve your efficiency\nand push your efforts\nand things that truly matter most to you.\nNumber five, meditate.\nDid you know that meditation\ndates back thousands of years?\nDo you ever wonder if it\nactually improves anything?\nTo answer the question,\nmeditation or spending a few\nminutes practicing mindfulness\nhas been proven to help.\nIts primary purpose is to\ngive you a sense of calm\nand restore your inner peace.\nIt doesn't require anything more but you\nand a nice quiet environment.\nMeditating brings down your stress levels,\ngiving you some space to\nbe alone with yourself\nand your thoughts.\nMeditation is also the\nultimate detoxifier.\nIt can your self awareness,\nhelp you focus on the present,\nand reduce negative emotions.\nNot only that, but there are\nmultiple ways to meditate too\nsuch as Tai Chi or yoga.\nTake your pick.\nAnd number six, exercise.\nAre you a treadmill person\nor run around your local park person?\nNo matter what the mode is,\nit's the intent that matters.\nWhen you exercise,\nyou're not just working your muscles\nand other physical aspects of your body.\nYou're improving your mental state too.\nExercising releases endorphins,\nwhich are feel-good chemicals\nthat can boost your\nenergy throughout the day.\nBy building up the habit of exercise,\nyou can boost both your\nphysical and mental wellbeing,\nwhich in turn increases\nyour confidence, optimism,\nand decreases your stress levels.\nHabits are not one-time escapes.\nThey're consistent, routinary acts\nthat can be fostered\nwith the right mindset\nand determination,\nstriving to cut down bad habits\nand building up good ones.\nEven if you feel like\nyour progression is slow,\nit's a great step in the right direction.\nIt will come out all for the better.\nDo you think these habits are achievable?\nWhat are some habits you'd\nlike to break out of?\nFeel free to leave comments\ndown below with your thoughts,\nexperiences, or suggestions.\nIf you
