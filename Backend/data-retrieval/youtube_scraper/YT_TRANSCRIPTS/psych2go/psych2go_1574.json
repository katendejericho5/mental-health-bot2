    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers!\nSometimes we can't help\nbut fall for that attractive\nbarista at our coffee shop\nor that good-looking classmate in biology.\nBut what about those\ndeep emotional crushes,\nwhere our attraction goes\nbeyond simply good looks.\nThere are a few common traits and habits\nthat can make someone more\nemotionally attractive.\nDo you have any of them?\nYou may not be aware you\nare magnetic in this way,\nwhich some might see as an\nadditional attractive quality.\nHere are a few signs you\nare emotionally attractive.\nYou just don't realize it.\nNumber one, you express your true self.\nYou don't like to shy away\nfrom expressing your true thoughts\nand feelings on a subject,\nyou express who you truly are.\nThis could be verbally or maybe\nyou use your sense of style\nas a means of expressing yourself.\nPerhaps you're an artist or musician,\nand don't shy away from expressing\nyour true feelings there.\nThose who tend to be\nemotionally attractive\naren't afraid of showing\nthe world who they are.\nThey're at peace with themselves\nand love sharing their ideas.\nYou don't express your opinions\nor create art to show off\nor simply impress others.\nYou often don't have a desire to,\nbecause you're happy with who you are.\nNumber two, you like it to get\nto know someone emotionally,\nrather than just superficially.\nYou enjoy getting to\nknow people on the inside\nrather than the outside,\nand people take notice.\nIt's this kindness and\ncuriosity towards others,\ntrue selves that can set\nyou apart from the rest.\nDeep conversations run abound with you\nand you don't stray away from intriguing\nand thoughtful topics of discussion.\nTime to theorize!\nNumber three, you remember\nthe little details\nabout someone or some things.\nDo you actively listen to others?\nDo you pay attention\nto the little details\nof your conversations?\nThe intriguing facts\nthat others subtly\nreveal about themselves?\nWell, this can set you apart from others,\nand people will often take notice\nof this attractive quality.\nEmotionally attractive people\nare the ones who actually pay\nattention to your emotions.\nThey can pay attention to\ntrivial things as well,\nbut it's the deeper moments\nthat stick with them.\nThey'll take time to\nnotice the little details\nabout your conversation\nand share them back with\nyou at a later time.\nDo you pay attention to\nyour friends in this way?\nShow them that you care\nby mentioning those interesting details\nin the stories they told you.\nNumber four,\nyou're comfortable saying no\nto uncomfortable requests.\nAre you afraid of saying no to\nfrequent favors and requests?\nIf so, there's no need to.\nIt's healthy for your mental wellbeing\nto respect yourself and your needs.\nOthers will take notice of\nthis attractive quality too.\nAccording to clinical director\nand professional counselor,\nStephanie Camins, setting\ngood personal boundaries\nis critical to creating\nhealthy relationships,\nincreasing self esteem, reducing stress,\nanxiety, and depression.\n\"Boundaries protect your personal self\n\"by setting a clear line\n\"between what is me and what\nis not me,\" she explains.\nPeople will see that you respect yourself\nand aren't afraid to create\nyour own personal boundaries.\nThis is a quality that others admire.\nThey may look up to you because of this.\nNumber five, you're open-minded.\nQuick question.\nWho's more approachable,\nsomeone who listens and is open-minded\nor someone who is closed-minded?\nI'm guessing you'll approach\nthe open-minded individual.\nThis isn't to say, we\nwouldn't know where we stand\nwith our values and opinions,\nbut an emotionally attractive individual\nlistens to everyone's perspective\nand makes their decision based on that.\nThey want to understand others more,\nso they aren't always so\nquick to make judgements.\nThey're open to new ideas,\nnew strategies, and new perspectives.\nAnd number six, you are passionate.\nAre you passionate?\nDo you take pleasure in\nyour favorite hobbies,\nexpress plenty of joy in\nconversations about your interests?\nAre you vocal about your passions?\nThis can be a beautiful quality,\nand it cheer up someone's day\nhearing another person\nexpress their excitement\nfor something.\nBeing a passionate person\ncan bring up the mood of those around you.\nYou know what it is you want,\nand you aren't afraid to chase it.\nYou're focused and delighted at the idea\nof what the future holds.\nYou have dreams, and you're\nnot afraid of pursuing them.\nWill you passionately pursue yours?\nNot only will make you a bit\nmore emotionally attractive,\nbut it's likely to bring out\na lot more of your true self.\nExpressing who you are\nthrough your passions\nis bound to bring some happiness.\nSo do you have any the signs?\nIf so, which ones?\nHave you ever been emotionally\nattracted
