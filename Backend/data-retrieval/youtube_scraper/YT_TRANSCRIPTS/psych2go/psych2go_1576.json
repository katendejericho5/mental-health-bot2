    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Hey,\nPsych2goers, welcome back.\nAre you worried that you'll\nlive a life full of regrets\nwhen you're older?\nMost adults have had at least\none experience, good or bad\nwhere they wish they could go back\nand do things a little differently.\nWell, to help you learn\nfrom their experiences,\nhere are the top 10 regrets of life\nby those who are in their old age.\nNumber one, leaping into\na relationship too fast.\nOne common regret shared\nby many elderly people\nis jumping into relationships too fast.\nThis is especially about\nrelationships with people\nwho have vastly different\npersonalities than them.\nMany elderly folks have\nnoted that while people\nof opposite personalities\nbring enjoyment to their lives,\nit doesn't always bode well\nas a long lasting commitment.\nAccording to Peter Bustin\nand Stephen T. Ellman\nof Cornell University,\nmost people actually\nprefer having a partner\nthat shares similar\ncharacteristics to them.\nSo while it can be fun for a short while,\nin the long run, you're\nmore likely to gravitate\ntowards people who are similar to you.\nNumber two, drifting apart\nfrom family or friends.\nDo you know a family member\nwho's estranged their child?\nOftentimes these parents end\nup carrying a sense of shame,\nstress and feelings of\nisolation once they're older.\nEven if it happened many years ago,\nestrangement can still have an\neffect on both members today,\nsometimes even impacting\ntheir mental wellbeing\nin the long run.\nFor these relationships,\nreconciliation and forgiveness\nmay help resolve the issue\nand overcome the negative feelings\nthey may have for each other.\nBut it only works if both\nparties reciprocate it.\nNumber three, not\nexpressing your emotions.\nLike many, you may think\nyour biggest regret\nwill be a failed career path\nor a lack of financial foresight.\nHowever, in actuality, most\npeople's biggest regrets\ntend to fall in a more emotional nature,\nsuch as not being present\nwith their family.\nMany elderly find that it may be too late\nto show their genuine feelings\nof love and affection,\nespecially when the opportunity\nhas already the passed.\nNumber four, worrying\ntoo much about the past.\nDo other people say that you're\nalways stuck in the past?\nYou might believe that getting older\nautomatically means moving on\nfrom everything in the past,\nbut it's not always the case.\nAs long as you spend all your\ntime worrying and ruminating\nover past mistakes and\nmissed opportunities,\nyou'll always find yourself\nstuck and unable to move on.\nHowever, this does not\nmean that you stop talking\nabout the past altogether.\nAccording to the American\nPsychological Association,\nreminiscing and communicating\nabout positive events\nfrom the past can actually improve\nan elderly person's\npsychological wellbeing.\nSo while it's good to talk\nabout the good old days\nwith your friends and family,\nit's equally important\nto look at the present\nand think of the future.\nNumber five, being\nuntruthful far too long.\nBeing untruthful doesn't only\nmean lying to other people,\nyou may also lie to yourself as well.\nJustifying your thoughts and beliefs\nin something that at your core,\ndoesn't reflect your values\nor innermost state at all.\nSimilarly, you may suppress\nyour own wants and needs\nfor externally motivated reasons.\nThis can go on for ages\nwithout even realizing it.\nAnd even if you do,\nit may be too late for you to\nmake an impactful difference.\nNumber six, not taking care of your body.\nAre you in your twenties to thirties?\nThis is usually the age\nwhere you feel invincible\nin at least physically,\nhowever, your body will naturally\nslow down after that time\nif it's not cared for.\nSpending your youth without\nkeeping a good diet,\ndoing exercise and having enough sleep\ncan accelerate this aging process.\nOlder adults who don't\nsleep well, for instance,\nare more likely to suffer\nfrom mental health issues\nlike depression and develop problems\nwith attention and memory.\nNumber seven, not exploring your career.\nHave you ever thought\nabout opening up a business\nafter school, but shrugged it\naside for fleeting pleasures?\nOr perhaps your career path\nwas so busy and well-paying\nthat you justified staying,\neven when it meant not spending any time\nwith your family and friends\nor being able to explore the\nthings you're passionate about?\nNot exploring your career options,\nwhether it's because of a high payout\nor a lack of intrinsic self-worth,\nmay end up leaving you wondering\nwhat if, when you're older.\nNumber eight, not traveling.\nDo you get to travel often?\nMany of them elderly\noften regret not traveling\nand seeing the world.\nThey may have lacked the resources\nand the opportunity when they were younger\nand lack the energy when they're older.\nApart from being able to see the world,\ntraveling also has many\nbenefits for your mental health,\nsuch as improving your mental power,\nhelping you stay calm and\nwidening your perspectives.\nNumber nine, working too hard.\nHow much time do you spend working?\nOverworking the most universal regrets\nfor people later in life.\nAccording to his book, Being\nThe Father I Never Had,\nhighly influential\npeople like Barack Obama,\nhad expressed regret\nfor not being there for his\nlittle girls due to work.\nThe common pattern these people\nshare is the lack of time\nthey gave towards the\npeople they cared about,\nlike their family and friends.\nAnd number 10, not living your true self.\nDo you hide parts of yourself\nto fit in with people?\nIf so, you may find that\nthe more successful you are\nattempt in masking yourself is,\nthe more lonely and\nisolated you end up feeling.\nChanging who you are and\npretending to be someone else\nto please other people\ncan be a source of regret\nlater in life.\nIf you recognize this\ntendency in yourself,\nyou may wanna reflect on why\nyou feel the need to do it\nand how you can take the steps\nto start living your true self.\nDo you have any regrets?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like subscribe\nand share this video\nwith those who
