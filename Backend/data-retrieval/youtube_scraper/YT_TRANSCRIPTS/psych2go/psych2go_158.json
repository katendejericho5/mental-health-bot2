important to look Inward\nand listen to the habits in your life\nkeeping you\nstuck living in the past do you find\nyour thoughts often drift to past events\nmistakes you'd like to forget about but\njust can't shake maybe there's someone\nyou can't let go of someone who has hurt\nyou or maybe you hurt them and you can't\nforgive yourself if you're ready it's\ntime to forgive and forget forgiving\ndoes not mean you condone their hurtful\nactions and behaviors it means you're\nready to free yourself from the pain and\nyou're no longer dwelling on the past\nyou are consciously taking back your\npower to create your own happy memories\nnow in the present and in the\nfuture focusing on the negative do you\nfocus on the negative too much do you\nfeel stuck because it's all you think\nabout your mind can't help but obsess\nabout what's all going wrong in your\nlife you have too many tasks to do too\nmany failures to progress too much bad\nluck while it can be hard to focus on\nthe positives when you're going through\na hardship changing your perspective may\njust help you step through that barrier\nthat you feel trapped behind look to\nwhat you do have and what you're\ngrateful for each day not getting out of\nyour comfor zone so you're afraid of\nwhat might happen if you fail of course\neveryone considers the possibility of\nfailure but to never take risks is a big\nlife mistake those who have lived a long\nlife often mention how they wish they'd\ntaken more risks in the last years of\nyour life would you rather have known\nyou took the risk instead of living in\nregret it's time to get out of your\ncomfort zone and progress if we always\ndo what makes us comfortable we may\nstart to feel stuck we need to explore\nwhat else is out there there may be a\nnew hobby career skill relationship or\nnew you out there waiting well for you\nprocrastination are you guilty of\nprocrastination this habit can\ndefinitely leave you feeling trapped all\nyou want to do is sit down and finish\nthat biology assignment due tomorrow but\nyou just got a new notification on your\nfavorite app and it just can't wait this\nis a tough habit small habits like\nputting away any distractions and work\non the task at hand in a quiet place and\nwork wonders then think baby steps as\nyou complete your work divide the task\ninto small achievable goals the next\ntask try getting yourself to focus on\nthe next one blaming it can be easy to\nblame a situation or person for all of\nyour problems but take a moment and\nthink is it really their fault or did\nyou know what you were doing all along\nsecretly hiding the truth at the back of\nyour mind it's best not to jump to\nShifting the blame to someone else the\nexcuses can be endless grow into a\nmindset that takes no excuses from\nyourself and focuses on finding a way\naround them not taking care of\nyourself it's important we take care of\nourselves first so we can actually enjoy\nour life and break free from feeling\ntrapped we should always focus on our\nmental and physical health so we can\nhave the strength to achieve our other\ngoals\nif you don't take care of yourself first\nyou'll only lose energy and become\nexhausted by the time you move on to\nyour next task or assignment not taking\nthe time for yourself and your needs\ncould also lead you down a path to\ndepression and other health problems\nmake a conscious effort to make yourself\na priority because you matter\ntoo progress your\nrelationships it's always nice to have a\nfriend cheer for you on the sidelines we\nneed someone to be our biggest fan well\nwell we should all be our own biggest\nfan too but who doesn't want a fan club\nof supporters having others in your life\nto turn to can make a world of a\ndifference so it's best not to neglect\nthe friendships in your life nurture and\ngrow your friendships so you don't lose\nthe connections in your life and if you\ndon't have any friends it's never a bad\nidea to

tackle it all\nthe first week of the year it's good to\nhave goals but if you give yourself too\nmuch to handle it first you may get\noverwhelmed it sounds easy to start an\nassignment when you've only been\nassigned one the finish line is so close\nbut if you have a stack of homework\nthat's waiting for you you may feel\ntrapped and ignore it all together give\nyourself one task at a time and
