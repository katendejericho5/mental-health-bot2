    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2gos.\nDepression.\nWhen does it creep into your life?\n(bell rings)\nYou never know.\nI first experienced\ndepression in middle school.\nAs a preteen,\nI naturally wasn't able to tell\nhow my mind was working differently.\nProbably the most common\nfeatures in a scenario like that\nis depression in sadness\nbeing somewhat\ninterchangeable terms for you\nbecause you haven't learned\nthe difference yet at that age.\nIn fact, it probably wasn't\nuntil my 27th birthday\nwhen I realized how truly\nseparate the two were\nwhen I spent a week\nunable to leave the house,\ndespite being in a pretty great mood.\nAnd really for two thirds\nof my life at that point,\nI'd only experienced depression\nin terms of extreme sadness\nor lethargic in response to an\nevent, usually interpersonal.\nMost of what I've learned about it\nhas come from the past five years.\nAs a preteen, I experienced\na great deal of depression\nor sadness as I would call it then,\nmainly due to academic, social,\nand presumably hormonal difficulties.\nBeing a perfect example\nof your inherent shy kid\nof the family left me nihilistic.\nI was often finding ways to try\nto draw attention to myself,\npassively, of course, because of shyness.\nFrom drawings and writings to song lyrics,\nI began to express what\nI was going through\nin a number of different ways\nfor the sake of expression\nand as a way to prove\nmyself as more capable\nthan the person I negatively\nperceived myself to be.\nBut somewhere between middle\nschool and early high school,\nI degraded emotionally to a great extent.\nI began making threats of self-harm\nand was even pulled out of public school.\nWhen this happened,\nI also went from (indistinct)\n10 pounds to a staggering 160\nover the course of about three months\ndue to the medication I was on.\nThroughout most of 2002, I\nsmiled in exactly zero photos,\nincluding a professionally\ndone family portrait.\nI now recognized that this\nwas stated and deliberate.\nA sort of generalized clap\nback against the outside world\nbecause of how I felt.\nI would sometimes be\nneedlessly better, stubborn,\neven explosive.\nAnd I often spent all evening\nin my room playing video games\nor watching TV.\nAlthough I never stopped drawing,\nI did stop experimenting\nwith crafts like collage\nand writing, etc.\nThe lowest moment\nwas likely after committing\na particularly upsetting\nform of self harm,\nwhich I covered up with a bowling glove.\nThis only attracted attention to it.\nAnd in no time,\nthe secret was wide and in the open,\ncausing me to double down on\nattention-seeking behavior.\nThere were brushes with\ndepression throughout the decade.\nMore chronic form of depression\narrived in my late 20s\nas I finally got my bachelor's degree\nand facing a difficult job\nmarket living in Atlanta.\nA decision was made to\napply to grad school.\nWhile undergrad was\neasily one of the happiest\nperiods of my life,\ngrad school was much more complicated\nand came with persistent bouts\nof depression and anxiety.\nI was substantially less social\nand prone to spending\nhours laying on the couch,\neither playing with my phone\nor doing nothing at all.\nAnd I would stare at the ceiling\nor bray my head between\nthe pillow and cushions.\nMost of grad school was back\nlit by anxiety and depression,\nbouncing off of each other.\nHowever,\nI became much more proactive\nin my mental health\nas a result and eventually\nsettled on a prescription regimen\nthat I still follow today.\nI then started regular therapy\nfor the first time as an adult,\nwhich I mostly kept up with since then.\nFollowing grad school,\nI moved yet again and spent all of 2019\nsqueezing as much\nemployability as possible\nout of my extremely\nnarrow window of interest\nand commercial work.\nAn intensive outpatient\nprogram via Zoom kept me afloat\non three therapy sessions a week.\nAnd looking back over the past year,\nI can see my mood as something zigzagging\nlike the chart of a tumultuous,\nbut slow, upward trending\ncompany on the stock market.\nOver time,\nrock bottom becomes a\nlittle higher than before,\nand the good days become\nmore like actual good days\nthan simply normal.\nMuch of this time was\nspent in a suffocating,\ncrowded and dark apartment and\ntaught me an important lesson\nabout considering the mental health impact\nwhen looking for apartments on a budget.\nOver the decades,\nI've had a number of methods\nof dealing with depression\nthat weren't particularly healthy.\nThe ones that were healthy, however,\noften involve distraction\nor turning to friends.\nDistraction could mean driving around\nand listening to music, a\nrural pastime, for sure,\nor it could mean something\nmore hobby-oriented.\nThe video game collection\nI mentioned earlier\ncontinues on and off to this day\nand opened up a little time capsule\nto turn on in moments\nof stress and escapism.\nHowever, if not handled correctly,\nthis hobby becomes\ndetrimental very quickly.\nEscapism can limit one's\nability to make a real change\nin their life and improve their situation.\nArt was far and away the\nhealthiest channel for me\nto process and express\nthings going on in my life.\nAnd it has always run the gamut.\nI've experimented in essentially\nevery type of drawing\nI could get my hands on\nand most types of\npaintings and photography.\nAs a preteen,\nI would work with clay as well\nas modifying existing toys\nto make new things out of them.\nPictures said from toy\nstory, but less nefarious,\neven though I had the same t-shirt.\nMore than anything though,\nsimple drawing and writing\nhave been my go-to formats.\nIn pursuing animation,\nI made films about subjects\nlike depression, anxiety, grief,\nand emotional dependency.\nI was able to unload the\nthings that weighed on me\nand make a recognizable\nsemi-permanent change\nin my mental state.\nAs I entered my 30s,\nI started regular therapy and\nlearned a host of other skills\nand coping mechanisms,\nmany of which I still use today.\nI try to walk outside as much as I can,\nas walks outside can\ncarry a lot of benefits.\nOthers include journaling,\nmindfulness, meditation,\nand self-parenting.\nAll of these have helped me get through\nseveral periods of\nstagnation to the current day\nwhere I've had a number of breakthroughs\nas to the causes of my\npsychological struggles\nand have been able to\nwork on them directly\nand make plans for treatment.\nAnd that's not only more effective,\nbut potentially more permanent.\nDepression arrives in many forms\nand can disguise itself as\nsadness, lethargic, apathy,\nand others.\nI've learned that recognizing depression\ncan be deceptively difficult\nbecause when it's at its worst,\nit has your mind under its control.\nAnd it gets harder to\ndifferentiate the real world\nfrom the dystopia that\ndepression will convince you\nis real.\nTime helps as does mindfulness, exercise,\nand spending time with loved\nones, if at all possible.\nAnd no matter how long\nyou've dealt with it,\nyou can always let your\nguard down without noticing.\nIt's important to try\nthe things that work.\nBut the most important part\nis maintaining some semblance of effort\ntrying to wrestle control\nfrom depression's grips\nso you can steer yourself\nin the right direction.\nIt may mean complete control,\nor just pulling the wheel\nin the right direction.\nEvery time you get your hands on it.\nEither way,\nthe most important and\noften seemingly hardest part\nis simply trying.\nThat often means physically getting up\nto do something that will\nmake you feel better,\nnot the thing that will\ngive you a burst of dopamine\nlike frivolous spending or junk food.\nIt's also very important to keep in mind\nthat this is a process,\nnot a simple cause and effect solution.\nThe most important word in\nthis video's title is overcome\nas opposed to the past tense overcame.\nIt can go away. Sure.\nBut it will almost certainly\ntake time and it can come back.\nDealing with depression\nis not a singular act.\nIt's a pattern of good habits,\nthe knowledge of what activities\nwill provide you with the\ngreatest improvements in mood\nand what activities will\nbe a temporary distraction.\nYour most important decisions\nwhen dealing with depression\noutside of the medical choices you make\nwill be the lifestyle you live\nand the way you treat yourself and others.\nHas your experience with\ndepression been like this\nor different?\nIf you have a perspective\nyou think could help others\nknow when to see a doctor or a therapist,\nplease let us know in the comments below.\n(soft music)\n(birds chirping)"
