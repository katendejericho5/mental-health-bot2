    "transcript": "- Hey Psych2Goers,\nwe hope you're doing well\nand are finding time for self-care.\nLet's begin.\nAre you your own worst enemy?\nDo you have high hopes\nand goals for the future,\nbut find yourself falling behind?\nSelf-sabotage comes in many forms\nand inhibits you from getting\nwhat you want out of life,\nbut how can we stop sabotaging ourselves?\nWell, here are five ways.\nQuick disclaimer.\nThe information in this video\nis not intended nor implied\nto be a substitute for\nprofessional medical advice,\ndiagnosis, or treatment.\nAll content contained in this video is\nfor general informational purposes only,\nand does not replace a consultation\nwith your doctor or mental\nhealth professional.\nLet's begin.\nNumber one, reframe your state of mind.\nWhen you get a bad grade\non a test, how do you feel?\nAre you down on yourself\nfor not knowing the answers,\nfeeling that you aren't good enough?\nPsychologist Judy Ho developed a chart\nthat showcases how your\ninterpretation of an event\naffects your feelings.\nUltimately leading to how you act.\nBy taking a step back and\nlooking at each component,\nyou can better find different causes\nthat lead to certain actions.\nOnce you have an understanding\nof this chain reaction,\nyou can better find ways\nto change your outlook on situations.\nPerhaps instead of feeling down\non yourself for a bad grade,\nyou think of it from the perspective\nthat you weren't prepared enough\nand can take steps to get\na better grade next time.\nThis is a growth mindset and\nallows you to view failures\nas opportunities to learn and develop\nrather than bring you down.\nNumber two, work on your self-worth.\nDo you believe that you don't\ndeserve the things you want,\nthat your hopes and dreams\nare better off going\nto someone else?\nWith a self-sabotaging mindset\nyou may also have a low\nsense of self-worth.\nOrganizational psychologist\nCourtney Ackerman\ndescribed self-worth as our tendency\nto evaluate our abilities\nand how we perform our roles.\nShe outlines what does not\ndetermine yourself worth\nthat we generally hold in high value.\nThings like your job, age, grades,\nor the number of friends\namong many others should not determine\nhow you view yourself\nand what you will be able to accomplish.\nRather, you should focus\non what makes you happy\nand what you find fulfilling.\nWorking towards what you truly want\nversus what society wants out of you\nand finding your own meaning of self-worth\ncan go a long way.\nNumber three, find a\nstrong support network.\nDo you find yourself getting\nstuck from time to time,\nthat you want to go down\na certain life path,\nbut don't know where to start?\nGetting the things you want out of life\ncan seem extremely daunting\nand be next to impossible to do alone.\nFinding and surrounding yourself\nwith the right group of\npeople, mentors, and friends,\nto help support you will help you\ndevelop a strong support network.\nIf you find yourself stuck,\nit can be easy to stay there,\nwhich is why it's important\nto find the right people that\nunderstand your situation\nto help propel you forward.\nNumber four, break down your goals\nand celebrate small victories.\nAre you finding yourself\nsetting large goals,\nbut you never achieve them?\nOr perhaps you push your ideas\noff for as long as you can.\nAccording to psychologist,\nDr. Melanie Greenberg,\none form of self-sabotage\nis procrastination.\nSometimes your need to get\nit right makes you nervous.\nSo you push off your task\nuntil the last minute.\nYou then sacrifice quality\nin order to get it done.\nIt can help to vary up your goals\nand celebrate the small\nvictories you have.\nInstead of embarking on\ndoing one large project\nall at one time,\nyou could break your large\ngoal into smaller goals\nand treat yourself as you\naccomplish them one at a time\nwhile learning along the way.\nAnd this helps develop a growth mindset,\nwhich allows you to focus\nmore on improving yourself\nand growing your skills over time,\nrather than getting stuck\non the bigger picture.\nCelebrating small victories\nand opportunities to learn\ncan help motivate you for larger goals\nand make these daunting\ntasks seem more manageable.\nAnd number five, talk it out.\nDo you feel that it's troublesome\nto communicate your needs\nto your significant others?\nIt can feel incredibly difficult\nto open up to another person.\nHowever, you may feel trapped\nby keeping your emotions inside.\nWhen you notice yourself going\ninto a self-sabotaging behavior,\nit can help to talk with\na trusted person about it.\nTelling another person\nabout what behavior you're taking part in\ncan help discourage you\nfrom taking part in it.\nSo finding someone who\nwill listen and comfort you\ncan help you get out of the\nself-destructive rabbit hole.\nAs always,\nif you find that your\nself-sabotaging behaviors\nare significantly hurting you,\nit may be worth finding a\nmental health professional\nto talk with.\nSelf-sabotaging behaviors can turn you\ninto your worst enemy.\nThese tendencies can be hard to recognize\nand treat on your own.\nHowever, recognizing areas for improvement\nand finding the right\nsupport network will help you\non your path for self-improvement.\nDid you find this video
