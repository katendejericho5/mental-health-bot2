    "transcript": "- Hey Psych2Goers. Welcome\nback to our channel.\nDo you ever feel like your life\njust isn't going the way that you want?\nAre you unmotivated or burnt\nout from everyday living?\nNowadays it can be so hard to set\nhealthy habits and goals for yourself\nwhen things seem to be going\na million miles an hour.\nBetween school activities,\nwork and hobbies,\nit can be difficult to figure\nout what to prioritize.\nHowever, there are some general\nrules that if you stick to\nwill greatly improve\nyour mindset and habits.\nSo with that said,\nhere are six life-changing\nrules to follow every day.\nNumber one, if possible, sleep early.\nHave you stayed up late to\ncram for a test the next day?\nMost people don't realize\nhow important sleep is.\nFor example, according to a UCLA study,\nsacrificing sleep for extra review time\nis counterproductive.\nStudents from several\nLos Angeles high schools\nreported in diaries,\nhow long they studied,\nhow long they slept,\nand whether or not they\nexperienced academic problems.\nThey found that diminishing\nsleep in order to study\nwas actually associated\nwith doing more poorly\non a test, quiz or homework,\nwhich was the opposite\nof the student's intent.\nWhat this means is that you\nshould try to prioritize sleep,\nto keep yourself happy and healthy.\nNumber two, avoid social\nmedia in the mornings.\nDo you use social media\nfirst thing in the\nmorning when you get up?\nWhile social media is a\nfun way to stay connected,\nusing it too often can end\nup doing more harm than good.\nFor example, you may\nstart to compare yourself\nwith various influencers and celebrities.\nYou could also start fixating\non the number of likes you get.\nAnd if it doesn't seem like a lot,\nyou might get caught up in\na negative thought spiral.\nThese harmful mindsets\nare especially damaging\nin the morning because that's what sets\nthe tone of your day.\nAre you going to wake up feeling refreshed\nand ready to seize the moment,\nor let social media bring you down.\nNumber three, believe in yourself\nwhile being aware of your limitations.\nYou've likely heard the\nphrase, \"Anything is possible\",\nbut sometimes it can be\nbetter to accept your losses\nthan force something\nthat's not meant to be.\nFor example if a relationship\ngets to the point\nwhere it causes you constant\nstress, fear and exhaustion,\nconsider whether it's\nstill worth pursuing.\nSimilarly, if chasing a dream job\nmakes you feel drained\nand anxious all the time,\nask yourself whether it's\nreally worth sacrificing\nyour emotional wellbeing for.\nThe bottom line is that while having faith\nin yourself is important,\nit shouldn't be blind.\nInstead, it should be balanced\nwith your limitations.\nNumber four, make time for learning.\nDo you have any hobbies?\nIf so, what are they?\nHobbies are a great way to\nstay mentally stimulated.\nAs you grow up,\nit's important to find things\noutside of work or school\nthat you're passionate about.\nThat way you can lead a more\nbalanced, engaging life.\nIt could be anything from\nplaying an instrument to cooking,\nas long as you enjoy it.\nNumber five, treat others\nhow they want to be treated.\nDon't get this confused with the phrase,\n\"treat others how you want to be treated\".\nWhile it makes sense in some scenarios,\nit can make more sense to treat others\nhow they want to be treated.\nWhat may work with you\nmight not be the best\nas what works for others.\nFor example you could\nenjoy being told things\nstraight forward,\nbut that could be too direct and harsh\nto the friend you're talking to.\nYou have to take their\nfeelings into account too,\nand adjust accordingly.\nAfter all, no two people are alike,\nso why treat everyone exactly the same.\nAnd number six, stay positive\nwhen things go wrong.\nIs it your first instinct to\nimagine worst case scenarios?\nOur brains have the\ntendency to make situations\nseem a lot worse than they are.\nThen many times we only realize\nthis long after the fact.\nSo, while it may be hard,\ntry to stop your gut instinct\nof immediately jumping into\nnegative thought spiral.\nThat way you stress yourself out less,\nand are much more likely to\nmake calm, rational decisions.\nDo you think these rules will help you\nthrough your everyday living?\nIf so, which ones and how.\nFeel free to comment down below\nwith your thoughts,\nsuggestions or experiences.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nlike and share it with friends\nthat might find it valuable too.\nRemember to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the sources used are added\nin the description box below.\nThanks for watching.
