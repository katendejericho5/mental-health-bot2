subscribing\nand joining the Psych2Go Fam.\nNow, let's continue.\nDid you know that 70% of adults in the US\nhave experienced some\ntype of traumatic event,\nat least once in their lives?\nAccording to the APA, Trauma\nis an emotional response\nto a terrible event, like an\naccident or natural disaster.\nHowever, while many videos tend to focus\non the person who experienced\nthe traumatic event,\ntoday, we will be focusing on\nthe people who support them.\nIt can be difficult and\nsometimes uncomfortable\nto know what you should or shouldn't say\nto someone with trauma\nand whether it is actually helpful or not.\nSo to help you out, here\nare 15 things to say\nto someone with trauma.\nNumber one, \"I see you're in pain.\nIt's okay to feel this way.\"\nSomeone who has experienced\ntrauma has witnessed something\nthat we probably would\nhave never even imagined.\nAnd some might beat themselves up\nfor having endured the trauma\nor get angry at themselves\nfor being so upset.\nBy acknowledging their\npain, you're showing them\nthat it isn't all in their head.\nIt's a way to tell them that\ntheir feelings are valid.\nNumber two, \"Your symptoms make sense,\ngiven what you've been through.\"\nIn response to the\nindescribable pain they're in,\nsometimes people with trauma\ncan experience uncontrollable,\nemotional breakdowns.\nBecause of this, they may tell themselves\nthat they're broken, weird, or hopeless.\nSo by saying that their\nsymptoms make sense,\nyou can provide them a sense\nof understanding and reassurance.\nIt tells them that their trauma was real\nand is something that\nthey're healing from.\nNumber three, \"What has\nhappened doesn't define you.\"\nPeople who have survived trauma\nsometimes get labeled as the victim,\neven after what has happened.\nThis may even apply to the person\nwho's gone through the\ntrauma, where they ended up\nallowing what had happened\nto be part of who they are.\nWhile what they've gone\nthrough may have been difficult\nand perhaps life-changing, reminding them\nthat they are not defined by their trauma\ncan give them a sense of reassurance.\nYou can remind them that they're\nmuch more than their trauma\nand that they are beautiful,\nstrong, and courageous.\nNumber four, \"The worst\nisn't happening again,\neven though it may feel that way.\"\nPossible side effect that can happen\nwhen you've gone through\nsomething traumatic\nis the experience of flashbacks.\nThis can make it feel as though the trauma\nis occurring all over again.\nThey may experience intrusive thoughts,\nimages, and sensations from the event\nthat they can't block out,\nmaking it hard for them to\nfocus and function normally.\nIn cases like this, you can help them\nby reminding them about\ntheir present surroundings.\nNumber five, \"You didn't deserve that.\"\nSometimes, people with trauma\ndevelop a very negative\nand harmful mindset\nwhere they might believe\nthey somehow deserved what had happened.\nSo by vocalizing, that\nthat is not the case,\nyou can reassure them\nthat it wasn't their fault\nand pull them out of their toxic thoughts.\nNumber six, \"How can I help?\"\nEveryone deals with\ntheir trauma differently.\nSome may find your kind words\nto be uncomfortable and unhelpful.\nSo when you ask them\nhow you can help them,\nyou're showing them that\nyou respect their boundaries\nand space and are giving them the freedom\nto decide what kind of help\nthey would like to receive.\nNumber seven, \"What happened\nto you was never your fault.\"\nPeople experienced trauma\nwill often blame themselves\nfor the fallout of what happened.\nThis is especially the case\nif there was someone injured\nor hurt due to the incident.\nEven if it wasn't in their control,\nthey may still ruminate over their guilt.\nSo by reassuring them that\nit wasn't their fault,\nyou can help pull them\nout of their negative\nand harmful thoughts.\nNumber eight, \"I'm sorry,\nI wasn't there for you.\nI will do best to be\nthere and to never judge.\"\nA traumatic event that involves\ntrusting the wrong people\ncan cause someone to develop\ntrust issues afterwards.\nThey may start to doubt or worry\nabout being betrayed or hurt\nby their friends or family.\nIn cases like these, you can try to show\nmore understanding and patience with them\nuntil they can start to\nopen up to you again.\nNumber nine, \"It's okay\nto be hurt and angry,\nthese feelings don't\nmake you a bad person.\"\nAfter a trauma, it's not\nunusual for the survivors\nto begin to see themselves in some way\nas being less than others.\nPerhaps, they may see themselves as weak\nfor allowing it to happen.\nAs with many beliefs related to trauma,\nsurvivors are sometimes\nmore critical of themselves\nthan they need to be.\nTelling them that they\nare strong and not weak\nis a way in which you can reassure them\nand help them feel\nbetter about themselves.\nNumber 10, \"I don't understand\nthe signs and symptoms,\nbut I believe you and I support you.\"\nIt's hard and almost\nimpossible to know what someone\nwith trauma is going\nthrough, but it doesn't mean\nyou can't give your support\nfor them while they're healing.\nBy vocalizing this point,\nyou can help encourage them\nin their progress to getting better.\nNumber 11, \"You are inspiring.\nEven if you don't see it,\nthe growth you've made is remarkable.\"\nIt takes a lot to recover from the trauma\nand the survivor may not always see\nthe progress that they've made.\nSo try to find ways to\nacknowledge their efforts\nand remind them that they are\nmaking progress every day.\nAnd that even if they\ndon't see it, you do.\nNumber 12, \"You are not alone,\nno matter how much it feels like it.\"\nThe feeling of isolation\ncan become overwhelming\nafter a traumatic experience\nbecause no one else\nhas experienced the same\nexact event as them.\nThey may feel like no one\ncan understand how they feel.\nSo, during moments where\nthey feel this way,\nyou can try to provide\nthem with some company,\nlisten to them, and reassure\nthem that they are not alone.\nNumber 13, \"You are loved and cherished.\"\nSurvivors of a traumatic event\nsometimes come out of\nwhat they've experienced\nfeeling anxious, depressed,\nguilty, or even ashamed.\nThese feelings can feed\ninto toxic thoughts\nthat harm their self-esteem\nand make them feel unloved.\nSo try to remind them that they are loved,\ncherished, and appreciated\ndespite how they must be\nfeeling about themselves.\nNumber 14, \"I have been here before.\nJust know that I'm here for\nyou and you can get better.\"\nIf you share a similar\nexperience with them,\nit's still important to\nlet them share with you\nwhat they want to share.\nTalking about their traumatic experiences\ncan be challenging and tough.\nSo it's key that you're able\nto show your care and support\nfor them when they do.\nIf you feel the need to\ntalk as a fellow survivor,\nyou can consider inviting\nthem to a group therapy\nor group discussion, or to simply revisit\nthe conversation later on.\nNumber 15, \"I'm so sorry\nthis happened to you.\nI will be keeping you on\nmy thoughts and prayers.\"\nIf you don't have a close\nrelationship with a survivor\nor do not wish to play an active role\nin their ongoing healing process,\nyou can say something\nthat is comforting to them\nand leave it at that.\nIt's important here that\nyou say what you mean\nbecause you may end up\nhurting them even more\nif you make a promise you can't keep.\nWhat do you say to comfort loved ones?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you on this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video\nwith those who may benefit from
