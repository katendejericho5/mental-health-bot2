    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nSometimes we can tell\nwhen someone is hiding something from us,\na comfortable smile is now\nreplaced by a slight grin,\nbut what if someone is\nhiding some deeper feelings?\nWhat if that smiling\nfriend or that ex of yours\nis hiding the fact that they\nlike you or still like you?\nWell, there are some\nways you can find out.\nHere are six signs\nsomeone is hiding their feelings from you.\nNumber one, they try to impress you.\nSo you're casually\nminding your own business,\neating lunch outside\nwhen your classmate taps\nyou on the shoulder.\nThey want you to pay\nattention to their trick shot.\nThey shoot and score.\nHmm, you hardly know this\nclassmate, but for some reason,\nthey want you to notice\ntheir impressive skills.\nOften, people will try to\nimpress the one they like.\nThey may change their behavior at first\nto be the most impressive\nand witty version\nof themselves too.\nIf they're shy, they may favor showing you\nthat they're intelligent or a\ncapable partner you can trust.\nIf they're more outgoing,\nthey may make a bold move and\nshow off a skill or talent.\nIf you engage in a conversation\nand they often discuss\ntheir accomplishments\nand maybe even brag a little,\nthey simply want you to\nnotice what's great about them\nbecause they find you great as well.\nNumber two, they help you.\nDo you notice your new acquaintance\nalways goes out of their way to help you?\nThey may volunteer to\nhelp move that old couch\nout of your room for you,\nor maybe they ask if you'd\nlike them to tutor you\nwith your math homework.\nWhen someone likes someone,\nthey'll often try to provide help to them\nbecause they care about them.\nThey wanna spend time with them\nor want the other person to notice them.\nBeing a shoulder to cry on\nor a classmate to confide in\nis also another way they may help you.\nThey don't mind lending an ear\nto what's worrying you in your life.\nAnd if you ask for advice,\nthey're there with words of wisdom\nand sometimes advice varies.\nNumber three, they often\nblush when they're near you.\nDo you notice people often\nblush in your presence?\nAs we know when people\nget attracted to someone,\nthey can become anxious.\nA kick of adrenaline and\nsuddenly, they're blushing.\nIf you notice someone\noften blushes around you\nand their face becomes flushed\nwhen you're talking to them,\nthey may really like you.\nAw, how sweet.\nNumber four, they fix themselves\nup when you approach them.\nSo you're walking towards someone\nand you can't help but notice\nthat they suddenly\nreadjust their clothing,\nfix up their hair and\nstraighten their posture.\nThis behavior is a common\nsign of attraction.\nWhen we like someone,\nwe often want to present our best selves\nand appear as attractive as possible.\nSo if you catch someone\nquickly grooming themselves\nas you approach them,\ngo ahead and give them\na compliment in turn.\nIt could very well just make their day\nand then you can notice if they\nstrongly blush in response.\nNumber five, they act different\nand nervous around you.\nHave you noticed someone always breaks\ninto a sweat around you?\nDo they jumble their\nwords in your presence,\ntheir hands clam up when you're near?\nSometimes when we like someone,\nwe can become a bit nervous.\nStammering, breaking out\nin sweats and clammy hands\nmay just be signs that\nthey like you so much\nyou make them nervous.\nAttraction can even make\nus a bit dumb sometimes.\nResearch has found that sexual arousal\nshuts off parts of the\nprefrontal cortex of the brain.\nThis region of the brain is responsible\nfor critical thinking, rational\nbehavior and self-awareness.\nThe next time you're around them,\npay attention to their behaviors.\nPerhaps they secretly have\ndeeper feelings for you.\nAnd number six, they\nsometimes appear jealous.\nHave you ever talked about\nan ex to your classmate\nand noticed they appear jealous?\nMaybe you already have a\npartner and you talk about them.\nSometimes people may\nexperience a bit of jealousy\nwhen the person they like\nis with someone else.\nMaybe you're simply talking\nabout your celebrity crush\nand you can't help but notice\nas an uncomfortable face\nor a sudden mood change.\n- Hmm, I just framed my\nposter of Ryan Gosling\nin my bedroom wall.\n- [Narrator] You sigh in joy.\nThem, they give us a slightly\nannoyed sigh, arms crossed.\nMaybe they just don't like Ryan Gosling\nor maybe they're attracted to you.\n- Argh, you Ryan Gosling, you!\n- [Narrator] So who's hiding\ntheir true feelings from you?\nDo you think you'd like them back?\nShare with us in the comments below.\nIf you enjoyed this video,\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share it with a friend.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification bell icon\nfor our content like this.\nAnd as always, thanks\nso much for watching.\n(light music)"
