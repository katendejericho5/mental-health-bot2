    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWhat do you pay attention to in life?\nThere are some things smart\npeople just don't waste time on.\nMost of the time,\nit's because they learned\nfrom past experiences,\nso they don't make the\nsame mistakes again.\nSo, what is it that intelligent people\nnever pay attention to?\nHere are six things they\noften just don't do.\nNumber one: They don't\nlet failure stop them.\nHow do you respond to failure?\nOur failures can become a\nlearning experience for us\nif we change our outlook.\nIf you fail, you'll have\nlearned from that experience\nand have an easier time trying again.\nSmart individuals don't let\ntheir past mistakes define them.\nThey instead try to learn from them\nand then look at those past mistakes\nas a guideline of what not to do.\nNumber two: They don't waste time.\nHow do you normally spend your time?\nDo you work hard or work smart?\nIf you know you need to study\nthe material a bit longer\nbefore attempting the work, do so\ninstead of wasting time trying,\nknowing the answer is in the textbook.\nOr maybe you have a different study habit\nthat gets the job done\nor know you need a short\nbreak every 40 minutes\nin order to work your best.\nBeing smart about how you spend your time\ncan also save you some.\nThis could even be\ncatching up on your reading\nwhile waiting in line for a taco\nor working on another\nassignment that's less tedious\nas a break before tackling\nthe big project again.\nMost importantly, knowing\nwhen to take a break\nand rest your mind will\nbenefit you substantially\nwhen you attempt work again.\nNumber three: They don't\nover-rely on other people.\nEverybody needs a friend\nevery now and then,\nbut smart people often\ndon't rely on another person\nto the extreme.\nAsk yourself: Will your\nworld really fall apart\nif your friend doesn't help you\non this big school project\nyou've been delaying\nor is there a way you can\nwork on it on your own\nand still be sufficient enough?\nEvery case is different,\nbut oftentimes we can\nunderestimate our ability\nand let fear guide us into\nrelying on someone else entirely.\nRely on yourself first with certain tasks\nand know when you really need\nsomeone else's help with it.\nNumber four: They don't let\ntheir errors define them.\nDo you beat yourself up\nbecause of your past mistakes?\n\"I shouldn't have said that, I'm so dumb.\"\nOr, \"Why did I do that?\n\"Now everyone thinks\nI'm a horrible person.\"\nSound familiar?\nTruth is, we're human,\nand with that comes some\nmistakes every now and then,\nbut don't let your errors define you.\nSimilar to not trying\nagain after a failure,\nsome people tend to\nruminate on what went wrong\nto the point that it\nstops them from moving on.\nSo, you made a mistake.\nThere have been some errors in the past.\nLearn from them, correct your\nmistakes, and grow from them.\nNumber five: They don't hold grudges.\nDo you have a grudge against someone?\nHolding grudges is never a good idea.\nNot only can it cause us stress\nwhen we think about this person,\nbut sometimes thinking\nabout a stressful experience\nor person can throw our body\ninto a fight-or-flight response.\nOur body may believe that\nthere is threat or danger,\nand stress is sure to come\nalong with that response.\nHolding onto any response\nis never a good thing\nfor both our mental and physical health.\nThat's why it's best to\nwork towards letting go\nof any grudges you have\nagainst someone or something.\nThis can be very difficult for many,\nbut it's worth working towards.\nYou may just feel more at ease doing so\nand have an easier time moving on\nfrom any past pain from this individual.\nAnd number six: They don't\nsay yes to everything.\nAre you afraid of saying no\nbecause you don't want to upset others?\nSometimes saying no can be a good thing.\nYou don't need to say yes to every favor\nor request from a friend,\nespecially if you've been\noverworked or tired lately.\nEmotionally intelligent individuals\nrecognize when they're burnt out\nand acknowledge when they simply\ndon't want to do something\nsomeone asks of them.\nAnd they know when to say no.\nIf you already have a full plate,\nsaying yes to more things\nwon't do you any favors.\nKnow your limits and know when to say no\nand yes when you really mean it.\nSo, which of these things\ndo you not pay attention to?\nDo you do any of these things?\nFeel free to share with us\nin the comments down below.\nWe hope if you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did, don't forget\nto click the like button\nand share it with a friend.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAnd as always, thanks for watching."
