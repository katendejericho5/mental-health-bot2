you\ncould stop feeling regret?\nEver since the dawn time,\npeople have struggled to find\nthe secret to the meaning of life.\nAnd while there isn't an answer yet,\nour centuries of shared\nexperiences and introspection\nhave brought us a few steps closer\nby better understanding\nwhat makes life worth living\nand overcoming the\nthings that hold us back.\nWith that said, here are 10\nmistakes you should never make\nif you want to avoid lifelong regret.\nNumber one, taking loved ones for granted.\nIn one of the longest\nand most famous studies\ndone on the psychology of happiness,\naccording to the Harvard\nstudy of adult development,\npsychiatrist Robert Waldinger found that\nhappiness is most strongly\ncorrelated, not with success,\nstatus, wealth or achievement,\nbut with the quality of\nclose personal relationships.\nThat's why when you're lucky enough\nto have people in your life\nwho truly love and care about you,\nyou shouldn't take them for granted\nor wait until it's too late\nto spend time with them.\nNumber two, not following your dreams.\nWhen we're young, it's easy for us to have\nlots of hopes and dreams in life\nbecause we feel like the sky's the limit.\nBut as we grow older, it gets\nharder to follow those dreams\nbecause of our everyday responsibilities,\nsuch as paying bills and\nmaybe raising a family.\nBut if you truly have\na calling or a passion\nthat gives your soul purpose,\ngiving up on it in favor of\nfollowing someone else's idea\nof what you should do in your life\nor choosing the path of least resistance\nis one of the biggest\nmistakes you can make.\nNumber three, not expanding your horizons.\nAs the famous movie quote goes,\nlife is short the world is wide,\nand I wanna make some memories.\nWhether it's traveling the world,\nmoving to a new city, taking a risk,\nor simply trying to allow\nyourself to discover\nall the great experiences\nlife has to offer.\nBecause if you don't,\nyou'll spend the rest of\nyour life during, what if?\nNumber four, wasting your time\non things that don't matter.\nThe older you get, the more\nyou realize things like\ngossip, fake friends,\npopularity, social media,\npretending to be someone you're not\nand always worrying about\nwhether other people like you\nwon't really matter in the end,\nand yet we can't help it\nwaste our time on them anyway.\nThe sooner we realize there\nare so many better ways\nwe could be spending our time and energy,\nthe better off we'll be.\nNumber five, settling into\nrelationships too quickly.\nEven if you don't believe\nin romance, destiny,\nsoulmates or true love,\nthat's no excuse for you\nto simply settle for a\nrelationship you're not happy in\nor fulfilled by just because you're tired\nof waiting for the right one\nor afraid you'll end up alone.\nBoth you and your partner deserve someone\nwho accepts you for who you really are,\nwho will love you in\nspite of all your flaws\nand make you happier than you\never thought you could be.\nSo don't settle for anything less.\nNumber six, compromising your health.\nDo you smoke or drink a lot,\nor maybe you just don't\nexercise regularly,\nor you eat a lot of junk food?\nIt's easy to neglect your\nhealth when you're young,\nbut don't make the mistake of waiting\nuntil it's too late to start\ntaking care of your body.\nNo matter how busy your schedule,\nyou should find time to eat well,\nexercise and get enough rest.\nAvoid unhealthy habits like smoking,\novereating and binge drinking\nand your older self will\nbe grateful to you for it.\nNumber seven, getting in debt.\nYou know the saying never bite\noff more than you can chew?\nThat definitely applies to our attitude\ntowards money and spending.\nSure saving money can seem like\nit's not a big priority right now,\nespecially when splurging on\nimpulse buys and luxury goods\nlike lavish vacations or expensive phones,\ngives you such a high,\nbut you'll regret going into\nmore debt than you can repay\nwhen the time comes.\nNumber eight, being overly\ndependent on others.\nOf course, it's only natural\nfor us to feel lonely from\ntime to time, and when we do,\nwe tend to gravitate towards other people\nfor comfort and reassurance.\nBut it's another thing\nentirely when we do it so much\nthat it makes us dependent\non them for our happiness,\nself-esteem and sense of identity.\nRemember, people who are\nemotionally dependent on others\noften become clingy, needy, moody,\nunsuccessful, and unhappy.\nNumber nine, having a bad\nrelationship with yourself.\nOne of the worst ways\nyou can destroy your own\nchances at happiness and success\nis by having a negative\nrelationship with yourself.\nYet so many of us are guilty of doing it.\nWe think that being self-critical\nhelps us become better\nversions of ourselves\nwhen really the opposite is true.\nWhen we are kind empathetic, encouraging,\nand supportive of ourselves,\nwe flourish so much more.\nSo know your worth,\nlet go of those limiting beliefs\nand start practicing self-love\nto start living a better life today.\nAnd number 10, forgetting\nto live in the moment.\nLast, but certainly not least,\nlet's say never forget\nthat life is fleeting\nand every moment is precious.\nSometimes we get carried away\nby the hustle and bustle of everyday life\nand we start to take\nall the simple pleasures\nand worthwhile moments\nin life for granted.\nWe are so caught up in\nour future and our past\nthat we fail to see all\nthe good we have have\nright in front of us, right now,\nhere, in the present moment.\nIn the words of Anne Frank,\nhow wonderful it is that nobody\nneed wait a single moment\nbefore beginning to improve the world.\nAnd the same applies to your life too.\nSo do you agree with all the\nthings we've mentioned here?\nLet us know in the comments below,\nand if you sometimes find yourself\nmaking some of these\nmistakes, that's okay.\nRemember that it's never\ntoo late to change,\nthat's the beauty of life.\nAlso remember to like and share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nAnd as always, thanks for watching.\nWe'll see you next time."
