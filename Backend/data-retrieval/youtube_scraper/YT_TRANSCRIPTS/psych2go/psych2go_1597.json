    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey\nPsych2goers, welcome back.\nWhat is trauma?\nAccording to the American\nPsychological Association, APA,\ntrauma is an emotional\nresponse to a terrible event.\nIt's something that can take over anyone\nwho's been through an\nemotionally disturbing\nor life-threatening experience.\nDespite what many people think,\ntrauma isn't something that only people\nwho've been diagnosed with PTSD\nor post traumatic stress\ndisorder can have.\nLiving with trauma can affect you\nwell after a traumatic\nevent or experience,\nand can play a big part in\nhow you move forward in life.\nThere are certain signs and behaviors\nthat are common in most\npeople with trauma.\nSo, to help you become aware\nof whether you're still\nstruggling with a traumatic event,\nhere are five signs\nyou're living with trauma.\nNumber one.\nYou're still emotionally affected.\nDoes the traumatic event you went through\nstill take a toll on you emotionally,\nno matter how long ago it may have been?\nHow your trauma continues to affect you\ndepends on your experience\nand it can vary from person to person.\nCertain words in your conversations,\nbeing in a certain place,\nor seeing particular objects\nmay trigger feelings or\nmemories tied to your trauma.\nIn more severe cases,\nyou may find yourself feeling as though\nyou are reliving the incident.\nThese moments can be difficult to manage\nand end up standing in the way\nof your healing and recovery.\nSo if you find that you're\nstill emotionally impacted\nby a traumatic event,\nseeking help from a mental\nhealth professional,\nor even turning to talk to someone\nwho's attentive and sympathetic\nmay help you deal with and\nnavigate through how you feel.\nNumber two.\nYou avoid certain thoughts,\nfeelings, and conversations.\nDo you go out of your way\nto avoid certain thoughts,\nfeelings, and conversations\nbecause you don't know\nhow to deal with them?\nPerhaps you find recalling\ncertain events overwhelming,\nor you can't bring yourself\nto talk about a traumatic experience\nor hear of any similar ones.\nAvoidance is a natural reaction to trauma\nand is often used as a method to cope with\nor escape feelings that\nmay be too overwhelming\nor exhaustive to address.\nIn the face of what your\nmind views as dangerous,\nyour flight response may kick in,\ncausing you to steer\nclear of these unwanted\nand uncomfortable triggers.\nHowever, it's important to\nknow that avoiding your trauma\nis only a temporary solution\nto push away your thoughts\nand feelings at the moment.\nIt doesn't guarantee that\nthey won't pop up again.\nInstead, avoidance may only prevent you\nfrom coming to terms with your trauma,\nwhich is important for you to\nbe able to heal and move on.\nAt a more severe level,\navoidance can lead to unhealthy\nand sometimes dangerous coping mechanisms\nlike substance abuse\nand excessive drinking.\nNumber three.\nYou feel disconnected from others.\nHave you been feeling\nmore and more isolated\nfrom the people around you?\nBecause of your traumatic experience,\nit can be difficult to find\npeople who can relate to\nand understand what you went through.\nAs a result, you might feel\ndisconnected from others,\nwhich may make you feel misunderstood,\ndifferent, or singled-out.\nSometimes, in order to\navoid any unwanted reactions\nfrom people who may not understand\nwhy you feel the way you do,\nyou may even suppress your emotions\nand purposefully hide how you feel.\nHowever, even if you\nfeel excluded and alone\nbecause of what you went through,\nit's likely that there\nare people out there\nwho've also been through\nsomething similar.\nAccording to the National\nCouncil for Mental Wellbeing,\n70% of adults in the US have experienced\nsome type of traumatic event\nat least once in their lives.\nSo if you're feeling isolated,\nit may be helpful to reach\nout to some communities\nor groups for support.\nNumber four.\nYou've become closed-off and\ndistant in your relationships.\nAre you always telling\nyour friends and family\nthat you're fine, even though you're not?\nBecause traumatic events\nare emotionally and mentally damaging,\nthey can be hard to talk about.\nEven when others are willing to listen\nand talk about how you're feeling,\nit can still be difficult to\ntake them up on their offer.\nYou may fear how they'll react,\nhave trouble putting\nyour feelings into words,\nor perhaps you just don't want to\ndeal with the painful feeling\nof thinking back to the incident.\nHowever, when you suppress\nor ignore how you feel,\nyou may just end up isolating\nyourself from your loved ones.\nSimilarly, the people\naround you may be unaware\nof what you're going through\nand interpret your behavior\nas annoyance, moodiness,\nor assume that you're\ngoing through a hard time\nbecause of other problems.\nThis can also create distance\nand strain in your relationships,\nmaking maintaining close\nfriendships difficult.\nAnd number five,\nyou had negative shifts in\npersonality and thinking.\nDo you feel like you won't\namount to anything in the future?\nTrauma can also have an impact\non your overall personality\nand ways of thinking,\nwhether it's experiencing a\nlower sense of self-esteem\nor developing a more pessimistic\nor cynical view of the world.\nYour trauma can change your\nattitude and sensitivity\ntowards other people.\nPerhaps you're more on guard\nwhen you're around others,\nor always expect the\nworst outcomes to occur\nin every situation.\nThis tendency to always be\ncautious and suspicious of others\nor to become aggressive\nwhen you feel threatened\ncan end up also impacting your ability\nto form and maintain your relationships.\n(sighs)\nDid you find this video helpful?\nHow many signs did you relate to?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nAlso be sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video with those\nwho
