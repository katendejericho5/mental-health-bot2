grateful\nfor your friends family i love it i love\nit i love it\nbeautiful energy all right so shall we\nget started\nlet's get started right away\num\nso first of all you guys um if you are\ncurious about like you're maybe even\nquestioning like i don't know if this\nperson in my life i think they are\ndepressed but i'm not sure\nlook in the\ncaption below after this video after\nthis live stream um we actually have a\nfew videos already\nhelping you guys identify certain\nsymptoms and signs to see if your loved\nones friends or family they might be\neither secretly or you know pretty\nopenly suffering from depression or\nanxiety so we will go ahead and put\nthose videos in the caption so you guys\ncan um you know go ahead and take a look\nat that if you watch this you're like\nyeah i think they are but you're not\nsure that's something that's an\nadditional um resource that you guys can\nlook at\ngenerally though um let's get started so\nwhat is depression i mean really simply\nput it's um you know this it's a mood\ndisorder that really affects people's\ndesire and passion for life you know\nthese people might be not interested in\ndoing much especially even if they were\nexcited about doing certain things in\nthe past and um you know again you know\nthey might be suffering from\ndifferent\nand i'll briefly mention some symptoms\nit could be that they're you know\nfeeling sad or empty hopeless or they're\nnot sleeping enough or they're not but\nthey're sleeping too much and they might\nhave you know trouble thinking focusing\nthey might be lashing out i mean these\nare some of the signs but again there\nare some videos that you guys can\nhighlight then today\nwhat i will be focusing on is how to\nhelp these people\nhow to support these loved ones so let's\nget right into number one\nnumber one you guys\nso number one is that realize\nthat\nthey are not\ntheir mental\ndisorder or their mental illness\nit's easy to see them as that when\nthey're you know in that state but what\nwe get to remember is that there's a\nbeing\nthere's a soul who might be experiencing\nthis one particular symptom or one\nparticular disorder um and they are not\ndefined by that thing\nthey there's a person there's a soul\nbehind that who's experiencing that but\nthey are not their mental illness\nwhat they do\nor say\nwith their being\nyou know there's someone else deep down\n[Music]\nyou get to focus on seeing their soul\nnow their mental disorder mental health\nchallenge is just one of the many layers\nor masks or you know\noutfits that they might be wearing at\nthat time but deep down there's a person\nthere's a soul behind all that\nchoose to see that person\nbehind those layers\nand sometimes it's gonna take discipline\nit's gonna it's gonna be hard because\nthere's the physical symptoms or what we\nsee in the external world\nthat\nyou know um signify that they are\ndealing with something but you get to\nreally see\nthat there is a person there's a soul\nthat is so pure and loving that's behind\ntheir mental illness\nso what this means\nis and this leads to number\ntwo\ntreat it like any other physical illness\nso for example you know um when someone\nhas um you know a\nreally challenging physical situation\nfor some reason because it's so physical\nwe can see it it's so easy to see right\nif someone has a broken arm or someone\nhas a broken leg they literally can't\nwalk or do things that they used to do\nit's easier for us to accept that that\nperson is suffering\nwhereas with mental health challenges or\ndepression\noften times especially because of the\nstigma or the lack of understanding of\nthese situations sometimes mental\ndisorders can be overlooked\num and it can be treated differently\nfrom other physical disabilities or\nhealth challenges right\nso um sometimes and here's the thing\nsometimes people are not being\nuh treated medically at all for their\nmental health challenges and even by\ntheir loved ones they're not treated as\nsomeone who who might need extra support\nso what we get to do is see that they're\nactually not well and support their\nhealing process as much as possible as\nyou would\nif anyone else was suffering from a\nphysical disability or physical\nailment\nso is that making sense for you guys\ndoes that make sense\nnow i actually speak about this from my\nown experience in the last couple months\nof helping my loved ones in my own\ncircle in different ways in some ways\ni\nwas successful and i was really good and\nsome of these things i'm sharing with\nyou because i'm looking back and i wish\ni did better\nso\ni'm sharing with you from this very\nvulnerable space and you know from my\nexperience from the last few months like\nwhat worked what didn't work\nand how you guys and how i can all\nsupport our loved ones better\ndoes that make sense you guys\nso um and so for me for example\num i felt it's hard to see that they\nmight not straight up and here's another\nthing when it's a physical disability or\nphysical\nillness\nit's easy you don't even have to have a\nconversation about it\nbut oftentimes when it's a mental health\ndisorder or if it's depression\nit can look on the surface like they're\nbeing\nlazy or that they're being\num self-sabotaging maybe they're\ndrinking a lot or you know it can look\ndifferent they might not straight up\ntell you\nso once you do and after seeing some of\nthese videos that we mentioned once you\ndo notice that they might be suffering\nfrom something like that\nyou guys get to be\nextra\num\nextra you know compassionate\nyeah so i'm taking a moment here to look\nat some of these comments\num\nokay um yeah if you have a question\nplease share\nplease share how do i support somebody\nwho is struggling with depression that\ndoesn't like when people worry or care\nabout them because it hurts them even\nmore what an interesting question\nhow do i support somebody who is\nstruggling with depression that doesn't\nlike when people worry or care about\nthem because it hurts them even more\nwell um\nhere's the thing there's a weird thing\nabout depression weird thing about\nanxiety what i found is that\neven if they say they don't want help\neven if they say\nthey might be pushing other people away\nsecretly what all humans desire is\nconnection i'm not saying go bombard\nthem with your energy if that's not what\nthey want however\num do be more proactive you know reach\nout to them let them know that you care\neven if it feels like they're pushing\nyou away\nbecause they might be pushing you away\nfrom a place of you know\nlowered self-worth\nor thinking that they're bothering you\nso and this goes back to number two\nwhich is how to look past that right\nkind of see through\num this\nouter layer that's trying to act hard or\nuh you know disinterested\nso i'm looking at some of these\nquestions you guys\num hey by the way\nwe do care and i'm not your cat so i\njust want to share that with you\num and hello so hey you guys um\nso you guys are asking some really great\nquestions and i'm going to go back and\nanswer some of these\na little bit more in a little uh after i\ngo through some of these uh highlighted\npoints for you guys is that cool with\nyou all right\nhey and by the way if you guys are just\nhopping on i uh invite you all to share\nwith me\nwhere you are hopping on from what part\nof the world would love to know where\nyou guys are coming from\nand let me know as i share these what is\nreally resonating with you\num what makes sense if there's any\nclarification that i can offer around\nthese topics please let me know cool\nall right number three\num\nand this is really powerful of a point\nbecause when we think about\nthese people that might be suffering\nfrom depression or anxiety\num we might have this idea of separation\nlike oh this is me i'm cool but they are\nsuffering from anxiety or depression um\nso\nyou know you kind of separate how do i\nhelp them right\nhere's the thing we get to remember this\nwhen we are helping these people is that\nremember that mental health\nchallenges it doesn't discriminate\num meaning that even if you're in a good\nplace today\nwho knows in 20 30 years\num this is something that you could\npotentially you know uh be challenged\nwith as well or maybe something that you\nhave already overcome\nso what we get to do is like and if you\nhave already experienced this in the\npast\ntake a moment to really try to put\nyourself in their shoes\nor even if it was a moment like hey like\nwhen i was feeling down what did i\nreally need\nand oftentimes the answers will come\nmore intuitively for you\nthis also helps if you find yourself in\nany sort of way and we're all human this\ncould happen\nif you ever find yourself falling into a\nplace of judgment like\nyou know\nthey're depressed\nand they're not doing this or you know\nwhatever you know judgment may come up\ntake a moment to realize this could\nhappen to anybody and\nthe reason i mention this is to remind\nus that we get to have compassion we get\nto lead with compassion\nand understanding\nbecause\nclearly um you know they're operating\nfrom a place that we\nmight not fully understand unless we\nreally take a moment to put ourselves in\ntheir shoes\nand so\num\nand\nsometimes putting yourself in their\nshoes might actually take\nadditional research\nfrom a place of love with the place with\na\ndesire to understand\nwhat they're going through so that you\ncan really\nhelp them\nand again you know that's um i want to\ndirect you guys back to some of these\nvideos that's already available and it's\nlike to go if you are in that place\nthere's a lot of resources there\nnumber four this is a tricky one this is\nsomething that i've also experienced and\nthis can happen more often than not\nand so let me know in the chat if you\nhave experienced this\num and we'll work this through together\nwhen someone's in a place of depression\nand this goes back to one of the\nquestions that somebody asked like what\ndo you do when you feel like\nyou're not doing them any good um and\nthey might actually even\nstart to hurt you have you guys ever\nexperienced that like there's a\ndepressed person you're trying to help\nthem and they're they're saying hurtful\nwords to you\nthis is the thing when we um when\nanyone's depressed it's really people\ngoing into the state of fear\nwhen fear arises\nwe go into one of the three states which\nis fight\nflight\nor freeze\nnow\nwhen people go into\na free zone this might look like\nlaziness this might look like\nprocrastination\nthis might look like they don't want to\nget out of bed\nit looks like they're not um feeling\nlike they want to do anything and you're\nlike trying to get them to be interested\nin something anything\num\nflight can look like they're trying to\navoid or numb out their depression\nit could look like actually the opposite\nlike overworking\nor over drinking or over\nstimulating of some sort you know\nover engaging in risky behaviors\num\nso\nthat could look like that now there's a\nthird one we haven't talked about which\nis\nfight\nand a portion of the people who are\noh okay i'm back i don't know what\nhappened this is when we get to realize\nthat\npeople are going to try to fight you\nand this goes back to the first point\nwhich is to realize they're not fighting\nyou\nthey're fighting their own demons and it\nmight look\nlike they're fighting you because you're\nthe immediate\nperson or the object outside of their\nmind\nand this gets to come back to the point\nthat you get to realize they're not\ntheir words they're not their fighting\nwords\ni mentioned this in the past before\nwhich is\nhurt people hurt people\npeople who are suffering sometimes hurt\nothers not because they're bad people\nbut because\nthey literally don't have any other\nmechanism at that point in their limited\nmindset\nfear-based mindset\nto be able to feel anything else\nright so i invite you guys if they start\nto hurt you first of all the thing is\ndon't take it personally they're not\nattacking you\nthey are projecting their own fears or\nprojecting their own\ndissatisfaction with their life or um\nyou know whatever they're feeling inside\nand try to brush it off\nknowing that it has nothing to do with\nyou\nhowever\nthis is also an opportunity for you to\nset a strong boundary this is also\nimportant um\njust because they're suffering doesn't\nmean that you just let them hurt you\neither\nyou get to actually set a strong\nboundary it's okay for you to say hey i\nknow you're suffering i love you\nand\nit's not okay for you to treat me that\nway it's okay it's not okay for you to\nsay these mean things it actually hurts\nme and i know you're hurting\nand i know the last thing that you like\nto do is hurt another person that you\nlove and i love you\nso\njust want to let you know that while i'm\nhere for you i'm going to walk away\nwhen you start to treat me like this\nand so you get to also set those strong\nboundaries\nthis is actually not only helping you\nbut helping them for two reasons\none\nwhen you set boundaries you're also\nprotecting your energetic state so that\nyou can actually show up with more love\nyou're not going to\nfeel hurt and then go hurt other people\nand continue the cycle\nand two is sometimes if they're doing\nthat to you\nyou also get to\num\nhelp them realize the impact that\nthey're having with love because if\nthey're doing that to you they might be\ndoing it to other people and they're\nprobably already stuck in that cycle and\num if you enable that it's not going to\nhelp them in the long term so you get to\nset those strong boundaries\nand say\nhey i love you and that's not okay\num next time i am here for you if you\nwant to think about or talk about it or\nemote i'm here to hold space but when\nyou start to project that on me i want\nto let you know that's where my hard\nboundaries and that's not okay right\ndoes that make sense for you guys\nhow's that landing for you what\nquestions do you have\nyeah\nit sounds like yeah setting boundaries\nthis is new what questions do you guys\nhave about setting boundaries what would\nbe helpful for you\nand maybe we can do a separate video on\nthis\num\ni'm just watching i'm just going through\nsome of these comments here\nyep\nhappy birthday by the way um\nso\nyeah you guys\nokay there's a friend of mine she's\ngoing through a lot in the past few\nmonths she has a career to focus career\nto focus on um but those happened\nreally messing with her mental space so\nyeah i mean all of these i'm going to go\nthrough some additional um\nyou know\nadditional\npoints for you so please stay tuned i\npromise this will be really powerful and\nhelp you\nokay um\njust feel less motivated\nif i set boundaries on the people i love\nhow do i know when is too much\nso here's the thing um and this is and\ni'm gonna be doing a separate video on\nself love and self care\nbut\nwhen we start to set these new\nboundaries what's going to initially\ncome up is shame right you're going to\nthink like am i being too selfish they\nmight even tell you that you're being\nselfish and always know that it's okay\nfor you to be selfish\num in not selfish and harmful way what i\nmean is put your\nput your happiness\nfirst put your overflowingness first\nbecause here's the thing i'll use this\nexample\nif\nif a plane is you know about to crash\num they always advise that you put on\nthe safety mask on you\nfirst the oxygen mask on you first and\nthen help your loved ones because here's\nthe thing if you're trying to put it on\nthem first you might pass out and you\nmight not even be able to help them\nthis is when you know this is the\nanalogy i like to use when it comes to\nself-care and self-love um you get to\nhelp yourself first because when you\nfeel good you can help other people from\nthat overflowing space rather than\npouring out of your own cup because if\nyou start to pour out of your own cup\nyou're not full\nyou don't have the life force energy in\nyou to help others and now two people\nare suffering versus one so boundaries\nhelp us protect that energy so that you\ncan show up as your best self for other\npeople that you love and that you want\nto support so that you don't become one\nof them\nif that makes sense\nokay so i'm gonna continue let me know\nif you guys have any questions\nnumber five\nthis is important you guys\num\nwe are always encouraging\neveryone here to seek professional\nassistance help whether it's a therapist\nwhether it's a psychiatrist psychologist\ncoach mentor like some sort of\nprofessional help\nfor specifically for depression we\nhighly advise you know therapists or\npsychologists or psychiatrists\nsometimes the best thing that you can do\nis not to try to help them solve their\nproblem\nyour job as a friend or loved one is to\nsupport them and a lot of times that\ncould just look like loving them\num so if they're you know depressed\nreally highly encourage them to seek\nhelp\nyou know if someone\nhad a broken leg the last thing you\nwould do is try to fix it yourself\nunless you are a doctor or a surgeon\nright but for some reason with mental\nhealth challenges or disorders or\nillnesses\nit's not as clearly defined or\nit's not as easy to identify\nso we try our best to help them and we\nwonder why it's not working\nso\nsometimes the best thing that we can do\njust like any other physical\nillness is to\nlead them to a medical professional who\ncan really help them\nand this is very much advisable so that\nyou can continue to be the friend that\nyou get to be\nand you're not trying to solve or fix\nthem\num there's nothing to fix everyone is\nalready perfect but sometimes we have\nthese you know chemical\nimbalances that gets to be balanced out\nit's a medical chemical thing\nhas nothing to do with who they are\nso that's um one of the tips i have for\nyou guys\nnumber six\nlet them know that they are not judged\ni don't know about you guys but where am\ni in the you know right now in seoul\nkorea or even in the us and i assume\nthat in a lot of different countries um\nhealth mental health disorders still\nhave this huge stigma\ncompared to other kinds of illnesses\nso sometimes people are scared to really\nopen up people are scared to ask for\nsupport or even get professional help\nbecause they're scared that they're\ngoing to be judged um dinner with one of\nmy friends the other day who shared with\nme that because of the stigma it stops\nthem from\nyou know seeking a therapist or\nprofessional help because they fear what\nthis is gonna mean for their reputation\nand and this is so still common\nso the best thing that we can do as um\nyou know our friends or family members\nwho might be suffering\nand being their friend being their loved\none is that we get to create a space\nwhere they know that they're not judged\nand that they're loved\nand let them know that they are safe\nin your presence and really practice\njust don't tell them and then you know\njudge them don't do that um really\nreally step into this place of\nnon-judgment\nand that itself can be really powerful\nand healing\nwould you guys agree for some of you who\nhave\nexperienced on the other end maybe some\nof you guys have actually experienced\ndepression or mental health challenges\nwould you agree that creating a safe\nspace for you has been helpful i'm\ncurious\noh thank you for letting me know i\nreally appreciate that\nhow do they know yeah yep yep okay so a\nlot of people are saying it's helpful i\nlove that safe space yeah\nand for anybody really um\nanybody can\nbenefit from safer spacer\nall right moving on moving along okay\nnumber seven\nso this\nyou know some of you guys may or may not\nagree with this and obviously take or\nleave whatever resonates with you but\nnumber seven pray for them send them\ngood thoughts send them good vibes and\nthis might not feel immediately helpful\nbut even in a scientific way it is\nhelpful and i'll tell you why i mean\nscience scientific research does show\nthat\npraying for another person sending good\nthoughts sending good intentions for\nanother person it's not only helpful for\nthe receiving person but also you\nthis helps your self-care self-love too\nbecause\nit's a practice of giving i mean what a\nbeautiful way\nto stay in an abundant loving mindset\nwhen we pray for another person\nbut not only that\ni know\nfor a fact that praying for the person\ndoes help i mean we don't have to get\ninto all of that today yes i will just\nsay that there is scientific evidence\nthat that is helpful for all parties\ninvolved\num\nbut\npray for them\num and this is so simple something that\nwe can do\nand when we are able to tap into our an\nabundant mindset because we're praying\nfor another person and we're in the\nenergy of giving\nthat energy itself you're able to go out\nand help that person be more of that\nsupportive energy even easier because\nyou're already in that state of loving\nand kindness\nyes yes yes prayer helps a lot okay so\nmaybe we all take a moment because you\nguys are all here because you probably\nhave somebody in your life\nthat\nis you know going through a difficult\ntime let's take a moment right now\n[Music]\nand send them good thoughts\nthis doesn't have anything to do with\nany kind of religion you can pray to\nwhoever god or yourself or your own\ndivine being whatever you like this\nisn't um any\nyou know religion focused practice\nyou can just say some good healing\nthoughts and send it to them\nand notice how good it feels for you\neven\nand imagine that person healing\nand visualize\nthat ideal situation for them\nsee how good it feels\nthere's plenty of research and this is a\ntopic for a whole different time but\nthere's plenty of research that these\nkind of focus loving intention can\nreally shift a lot of energies in this\nworld\nall right\ncool number eight\nand this kind of goes along with number\nseven if appropriate you know not\neveryone might even um take the on but\nif appropriate encourage that person\nsome kind of spiritual practice for them\nto\nmaybe encourage them to\npray for their own healing maybe\nencourage them to\nyou know start meditating\nmaybe encourage them to\num you know if they already have a\nreligion that they resonate with\nencourage them to go into that space of\nsacredness whether it's going to the you\nknow church or temple or whatever they\nresonate with or if they already have a\nprayer practice that they\nyou know maybe forgot about encourage\nthem on that path it can be really\npowerful for them as well\nall right\n[Music]\nall right you guys i'm gonna move on\num number nine\nso this is one way that we get to also\nbe a part of the healing process and\nit's actually way simpler than you think\nbut it's actually a little bit harder\nwhen it when put into practice unless we\nreally show up with this intention\nit is to listen\nwithout needing to fix anything without\nyou know of course there's going to be\ntimes where it's appropriate for you to\nrecommend hey like have you tried this\nhave you tried that\nbut even those recommendations will be\neven more effective and powerful\nwhen you first listen\nask them what they are experiencing what\nis it like\ntell me\nand just shut up\nand just listen\num i don't know about you guys but\nthis is something that i get to practice\neven more which is that\nuh\nsometimes it's easier because we love\nthem we want them to feel better we we\ngo into this like oh let's help you feel\nbetter mode\nbut sometimes the most important thing\nis\nto just listen\nhold\nspace\nand just not\nput a hand on their shoulder and say i\nhear you\ngive them a hug\njust ask them\nhow they're experiencing this life how\nthey're experiencing this mental health\ndisorder\nhow they're experiencing depression and\nwith no judgment just listen\nand\nyou know i want to say this is hard even\nfor me it has to be something that i\nhave to really intentionalize\nbut when done when done\nit's really powerful and it can be\nextremely healing\nand acknowledge them acknowledge them\nfor just opening up\nhaving the courage to speak about it if\nthey share anything with you thank them\nfor sharing their innermost thoughts\nokay\nis this helpful you guys some of these\nmight be whoa like oh my gosh i've never\nthought about it some of these might be\nyeah like i knew that but i haven't put\ninto practice and this is a powerful\nreminder for me to do that\nso please share with me um what's been\nresonating with you the most any\nquestions that you have\num\nlet me know\num\nyes yes\nabsolutely\noops\nyes thank you thank you okay i'm gonna\ncontinue guys\nnumber ten\nso simple i mean these tips are not\nanything\nyou know\n[Music]\nanything\nrevolutionizing but when done in\npractice it is\nremind them that they are loved\nremind them\nand you might know um\nin certain cultures\nsaying i love you is not\nvery common i found especially you know\ni've been in korea for the last year\nsaying i love you is not as common as in\namerica or other cultures\nespecially when it comes to older\ngenerations\ntell them you love them like verbalize\nit like make it so obvious\ndon't think that your actions or what\nyou do or you know the little things\ndon't leave it\nbeing hinted\ntell them look at them in the eye and\nsay i love you i just want you to know\nthat i love you you are so loved by this\nfamily by this friends group\nand\nit might be that simple statement that\ncan make a huge difference\num\nso really reminding them that they are\nlove\nlet them feel your love\nask them do you feel loved what can i do\nto help you feel loved in this moment\nhow can i love you\ni mean these are such simple questions\nthat we can ask at any time that we just\nforget to ask\nor\nyou know it's it's hard for us to like\naccess that part of us for this person\nwho really needs to hear that\nat times so i invite you guys to step\ninto that place where you get to ask\nthem like how can i love you\nnot how can i fix you because there's\nnothing to fix everyone is already whole\nand perfect\nhow can i love you\nnumber 11\ncreate routines together that would help\nand praise and encourage\nroutines that would help them\num you know one of my loved ones they\nstarted walking\nin a way to help them exercise to\nhelp them stay more grounded\nand i was i praised them every day i'm\nlike oh my gosh you walk today i'm so\nproud of you\nwhat a wonderful routine that you're\ncreating for yourself\nhow amazing i'm so proud of you because\nyou guys for people who are\nmoving through these darker emotions or\nstates of depression or anxiety\ndoing little things can be a big deal\nso when you encourage them when you\nacknowledge them for creating these\nhealthier routines and you really see\nthem\nit means a lot to them\nso take a notice of certain things that\nthey do new healthy routines that\nthey're creating any signs of\nimprovement\nand maybe you know walk with them if\navailable you know\nyou know physical distance\nyou're able to be with them do them\ntogether if they're trying to eat\nhealthier\ngo get juice together\nif they're trying to be you know\nexercising more go for a walk together\nand you can create these routines\ntogether to support them\nnumber 12\nand this goes along with number 11 make\na big deal when you see any signs of\nimprovement so even if you're not able\nto create these routines and do them\ntogether make a big deal\num and also when you do have shared\nactivities and you know that this person\nis suffering from depression or anxiety\navoid doing things together that you\nknow is not helpful for their mental\nhealth\num for instance you know i had a close\nfriend who was\nsuffering from you know depression and\nanxiety\nand\none thing i had to make it clear to them\nis that hey like i'm willing to do cool\nthings with you\ni'm willing to do things to support you\nbut\ni'm unwilling to drink with you i'm\nunwilling to engage\nany other activities that i know isn't\ngoing to be good for you\nand like really but when they do\nsomething\nfor them that is\nany signs of improvement encourage them\npraise them and let them know that you\nsee them and acknowledge them right\num okay you guys\nis

technique i utilize to help my\nentrepreneurs and high performers anchor\ninto their successful state\na lot of times this is what i do you\nknow to help them anchor into a mindset\nthat really supports them\nhelp them remember good times and help\nthem remember that they had these good\nfeelings\ntalk about their achievements ask them\nwhat\num what are some time hey when was the\nlast time that you were happy and they\nwere like oh it's been a long time hey\nbut okay i understand for a long time\nbut when was the last time like i want\nto know\nhelp them access the memories of good\nfeelings\nthis helps them remind themselves that\nthey're not defined by their depression\nit's not a permanent thing it's a thing\nthat can come and go but it can also go\nbecause they've had good times in their\npast um\none of the things though is that\ndepression can also screw with our\nmemories right\nso\nreally like be patient\nand help them really remember\nwhat the good times were\nand just like really like help you know\nhelp them experience that again even for\na second oh yeah i remember that time\nthat was amazing\nor oh my gosh yeah i'm so proud of you\nfor that achievement too that was so\nincredible to watch\nhelp them\num and then number 14.\nthis is a tricky one and i say this um\ni'm gonna spend some time talking about\nthis\nit's good to support them but sometimes\nyou know that the best way to support\nthem\nis to\nshare the truth\nlike speak into the truth\nin a way that's loving not from a judge\nplace of judgment\nbut from a place of genuine care and\nlove\nand let them know like verbalize clearly\nrealize hey can i share something with\nyou from a place of love\nbecause i really care\nyou know sometimes they're gonna have\nthe self-sabotaging behaviors\nand sometimes they will go along though\nfor too long\nif they're\nengaging in risky behaviors or if\nthey're drinking too much or if they're\nclearly doing things that you know is\nnot supporting them\nyou get to share with them\nand this is only helpful when you do it\nfrom a place of love\nand you see them as an equal\nyou see them as already a whole being\nthere's nothing to fix it's just that\nhey\ni love you and i want you around for a\nlong time\ni want to see you happy\nand i'm concerned because i noticed and\nyou can start by\n[Music]\nstart by acknowledging them and first of\nall i want to acknowledge you because i\nknow that it takes courage every day to\ngo through these days where everything\nseems heavy and i want to acknowledge\nyou because i know you're trying in your\nown way i know you're trying your best\nand\num and then state what you observe\nfactually\nand not like you're drinking too much\nnow that sounds like a judgment\nif they're you know engaging in drinking\nyou feel like it's not helping them they\ncan say hey notice that you've been\ndrinking\num four times out of the seven days last\nweek\nthat's not a judgment just a simple\nobservation and i noticed that you drink\nyou know five drinks each of those\nnights\nthree drinks each like whatever it is\nspecifically what you observe\ni noticed that\num and my best intention for you is that\nyou are healthy\nand um yeah i just want to\nyou know\ntalk about that or have you you know\nsought help for that how can i support\nyou\nopen up the conversation\nsometimes bringing clarity and\ngenuine\num\nyou know sharing your truth that other\npeople might not be willing to share can\nbe love\nnow\nnow you get to focus on that intention\nand this is why because\ntheir\nreaction may not be what you want they\nmight not say oh my god thank you right\nbecause they already are stuck in this\num\npattern they might initially try to\ndefend themselves they might initially\ntry to like you know fight you argue you\njust know that\nyou're they're not fighting you\nthey're they're arguing with themselves\nbut sometimes planting that seed\ncan have um\nan effect down the road\nand you know don't don't do it overly\nbut do let them know that they're loved\nand so on is this helpful you guys what\ndo you guys think about this what are\nyour thoughts what questions do you have\nlet me know if this is\nokay lemon asmr i've been a depressive\nepisode i'm having trouble getting out\nof it\ni want to ask you\nif someone were to do these things with\nyou and for you would this be helpful is\nthere anything else that you think would\nbe helpful for other people\nthat love you to support you\nfeel free to share and you know we would\nlove to hear\nvery much helpful\namazing amazing amazing okay\nshare your experience strength and hope\ni love that okay\nand lastly\nnumber 15 you guys\nthe best way to support them\nis for you\nto embody\nself-love\nsometimes\nwho we're being can be more healing and\ninspirational\nand motivating than what we're doing\nfocus on your happiness too\nyou know don't try don't lose yourself\ntrying to help somebody or save somebody\nelse\ntake plenty of time\nto love yourself\nbe the beacon of light the be\nthe beacon of love yourself\nshow them how it's done hey this is what\nit looks like\nto really love yourself and you don't\neven say that when you're being it when\nyou're truly doing things that support\nyour growth\nand to support your own happiness and it\nbecomes a natural part\nthis will inspire them\ntake responsibility\nfor your own happiness\nshow people what it looks like\nfor you to take responsibility for how\nyou feel\nand then they might be like whoa that\nperson's really taking their own\nhappiness and well-being into their own\nhands i wonder what i can do\nand it's also going to be way more\npowerful when you can support them from\na place of overflowing\nbecause if two people are now you know\nin a fear-based mindset it's going to be\nlike just clashing right\ni'm back all they have to do is model\nwho you're being\nthey're going to be inspired\nso i'm going to have a separate video\nyou guys if you think that would be\nhelpful for me to do\nhow to love yourself how to self care\neven more\num if that's

your\nrole as your friend as their friend or\nloved one show up with absolute\nnon-judgment\nand absolute compassion and be willing\nto listen and all the things that we\ntalked about today hopefully that will\nhelp\nlove you too you guys i love you hey\nshare with me in the chat\nwhat was most helpful for you what are\nyou grateful for today\nlet's start a conversation what\nquestions do you have\ncould you just grab an experience of\nspeaking with a mental health\nprofessional psychiatrist or therapist\nor mental health topics\nokay yeah i mean i've um encouraged so\nmany people to go\nget help um from a professional i've you\nknow gone you know\ni have their\ntherapists as well as experiences with\npsychologists\nit's it depends i mean i can't speak for\neveryone but typically it's a very safe\nspace this is a place where you know\neveryone just wants to support you it's\nlike going to any other doctor's\nappointment you share with them what's\ngoing on they might ask you some\nquestions and they're gonna offer um you\nknow recommendations if they're\npsychiatrists they're more likely to\noffer some kind of\num like\nmedication type of treatment or some\nspecific plan of treatment sometimes i\nfind that with therapists\num they are more willing to listen and\num they you know it depends on the\nprofessionals i can't speak for everyone\nbut what i can say is they are the\nexperts they're the professionals and\nyou won't regret going to them if you\nhave something that you are dealing with\nso my recommendation is feel open-minded\nknow that you're supported know that\nthey have been trained to help you\nand try it you know go and um know that\nif you are\nneeding this there's no reason for you\nto not seek help just like any other\nany other challenges physically right\nyour advice applies to people who want\nto actually help themselves how do i\nhelp someone who doesn't see themselves\nas worthy of the effort to get better\nplease i have a friend like this\num\nso obviously you know this is not um\none-size-fits-all answer but i can share\nwith you this\nwhatever it takes for you\nto communicate your genuine love and\ncare for them\nand one of the things that you can look\nat is what is their love language\nyou know there's five different love\nlanguages right there's um\nactive service words of affirmation\ngifts\nquality time\num what am i missing um\nquality time after service\ngift\nanyways are you blanking right now\nthere's five different\num\nyou know love languages or you might\njust know them that you know that they\nfeel most loved when you say\na praise or whatever\nlove is an energy that really can change\nthe impossible to possible um so show up\nwith love\nlet them know\ni care about you\nand\nit would mean the world for me\nto see you happy to see you healed to\nsee you\nyou know be who you really are\nlet me know how i can support you\nand\nlet's get some help i'll go there with\nyou i'll help you\nall the things that we talked about but\nit's most important for you to show that\nintention of love\nand trust that it's going to do magic\nand you know don't give up don't give up\num nz i just acknowledge you for trying\nbecause this is also your journey of\nlearning how to show up for your loved\nones and who knows how this is going to\nimpact you in the future\num\ni have a friend who is always\nshort-tempered this is something that i\ntalked about before\nhurt people hurt people\nwhen someone is short-tempered or being\nrude or mean to you\nyou get to know that this has nothing to\ndo with you\nthey're triggered\nthey are already suffering\nso\ni know it's hard and i've been in this\nsituation as well many times\nand it's really hard to not get\ntriggered back\nand just to remember that\nyou know um\nthey're they're suffering so have\ncompassion\nof course if they're you know attacking\nyou set those boundaries while having\ncompassion because self-love is also\nlove self-compassion is also compassion\num but realize that what they're saying\nto you has nothing to do with you it has\neverything to do with their inner demons\nthat they're fighting so when we can\nactually take ourselves out of that\nformula like they're not being\nrude to you\num it actually becomes a little bit\neasier to see them and you know provide\nthem with the support\nto message someone there too she's super\nnice and honest i'm moving away from my\nfamily\nand i'm just excited\n[Music]\nokay so you guys how was that for you is\nthat helpful\ni hope this was helpful and thank you so\nmuch for our 7 million subscribers\nhey you guys if you have anyone that um\nyou think would be benefiting from a\nvideo like this please feel free to\nshare\nthe reason that we do this is because we\nhave we have a mission to help people\naround the world also eliminate stigma\naround mental health\nchallenges and illnesses\nand to know that we're all in this\ntogether\nwe created this community because we\nbelieve that everyone can heal together\num sure a lot of these videos is to help\nyou you know identify what might be\ngoing on and um we've also started to do\na lot of these workshops so that we can\nsupport people in the healing process as\nmuch as possible\nif you guys migrate over to my youtube\nchannel you'll also see a bunch of\ndifferent self-help videos as well as\nhealing videos around forgiveness and\nconfidence and happiness and so on so\nfeel free to join me there\nand if there's any other topics that we\ncan touch\non i know you guys have already shared\nand we see you we hear you obviously\nthere's a ton of comments coming through\nso we're not able to catch all of them\nbut know that every single one of them\ndo matter and that we listen and um\nwe try our best to create content to\nsupport you\nso um again you know this particular\nlive stream was about how to support\nanother person who might be\nmoving through depression um and i know\na lot of you guys might be asking like\nwell how do i how do i\num\nhow do i support myself there's also\nsome videos that highlight those on my\nchannel as well as on site to go so\ndefinitely check those out we'll list\nsome of those there\num\ni'm grateful that i saw this live oh\nokay\ni'm grateful i saw this well so grateful\nyou're here too drisana\nwhat a beautiful name i have a question\nabout how can i put myself actually back\nfrom crying at night\nso i want to let you know dristana i\nactually have clients who\nwho\nhave trouble\nlike crying\nmeaning how beautiful is that that you\nget to be an effortless channeler of\nyour emotions and move them through your\nbody\nso i want to acknowledge you i mean\ncrying isn't all a bad thing however if\nyou do find yourself you know falling\ninto this pattern you're finding\nyourself not it's not really helping\num go back to the basics\ngo back to the basics so if this is\ncoming from a place of depression or not\nfeeling good\ngo back to the basics move your body\nevery day you know it's been proven that\nworking out of any sort it could be\nsimple walking even yoga even anything\nany kind of physical activity is going\nto increase the happy hormones in your\nbrain literally changing the chemical to\nsupport you to feel better\nso to break that pattern maybe instead\nwhen you know that it's about time that\nyou typically cry\nand there is some truth that our body\ndoes get addicted to of these stress\nhormones break the pattern maybe during\nthat time when you feel oh this is\ntypically a time that i fall into that\nspace of darkness or\ncrying um choose to do some plan to do\nsomething else during that time maybe\nyou know anything from\nstretching going for a quick walk if\nthat's available\nsometimes when i'm feeling down i just\nlike find a funny video even though my\nbody's like the last thing i want to do\nis laugh\ni'll literally find videos of like happy\nbabies and cute animals and make myself\nlaugh i mean sometimes we lead with our\nmind but a lot of times when we're\ndepressed it's hard to lead with our\nmind because our mind is already in a\nplace that we don't want\nso we get to lead with our physical body\nfirst meaning move your body um change\nthings up in your body dance dance like\na crazy person turn on your favorite\nmusic and dance like break the pattern\nand um it's going to allow your body and\nyour mind to enter into a space that's a\nlittle different from what you're used\nto so i hope that's helpful\num\nsunlight yeah vitamin d\nwhich um you know we get from sunlight\nit's actually been scientifically proven\nthat it's very helpful\num i didn't list it here because you\nknow being in seoul korea i find that\nthat's not always available for\neverybody so i focus on things that you\ncan do for another person that's a\nlittle bit more readily available for\nothers however if sunlight is available\napps so freaking lowly go out to\nsunlight um you know if you're helping\nsomebody who's moving through depression\ngo out into sunlight find activities\nthat incorporate sunlight and you know\nget some sunlight together it's an\nexcellent idea\nand you know this is what i mean by\ngoing back to the basics like do the\nthings to take care of your physical\nbody first so getting sunlight the\nsimple things getting sunlight getting\nexercise drinking enough water can\nactually increase your mood or you know\nheighten your mood as well\num meditating yoga i mean a lot of these\nthings are abundantly available meaning\nthey're available for free\nright i mean sunlight is free water is\nmost likely free um\nstretching yoga is free there's tons of\nyoga videos on the internet that you can\naccess for free meditation\nnow i can have a whole different\ndiscussion on meditation if you are the\none suffering from depression um or\num you have somebody who's suffering\nfrom depression encourage them to\nmeditate or you also meditate um\nif you're suffering too\nmeditating itself actually brings our\nbody into a place of like balance like\nhomeostasis it creates the ground so\nthat we get unaddicted to these stress\nhormones a lot of times when we're\ndepressed that means that we're getting\nstressed and entering into this fear\nstate\non a you know rhythmic basis\nand of course like you know this isn't\nall a cure for depression definitely\nseek medical help um\nand so you know from some milder\nsymptoms of depression um\nmeditating can be massively helpful so\ncan breath work so maybe you can do a\nworkshop another day on breath work and\nmeditation\nbut this can really help our bodies calm\ndown like literally calm\ndown\nso that we have space to create new\npossibilities the thing with depression\nis that we get stuck in this mindset\nthat we are what we've created in the\npast and that's it right anytime think\nabout this\nwhen when we are stuck in this mindset\num\nor you know any kind of depressive\nepisode\nwe\nbelieve that we're only gonna feel what\nwe've felt before like hey like i am\npredicting that this worst thing is\ngoing to happen so therefore i'm feeling\nbad again but when we can actually tap\ninto this reminder and the mindset that\nwe're actually the creator of our own\nemotional states\na creator of our own future\nthen it becomes easier for us to be\noptimistic because we can create\nwhatever it is that we want\num so i mean there's a lot to be said\nthere but anyway so i wanted to share\nsome of these with you guys\num thank you all for being here\nit's been incredible\nsharing the space any other questions\nwhat's my zodiac sign can you guys guess\nif you guys can guess put it in the chat\nmaybe i'll tell you at the end of this\nthank you so much for being here i'm so\nglad that you are here as well\nand\ni'm looking at\num hey you guys\nif someone is actually suicidal\nplease please please\nyou
