    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nDo you have a close friend?\nSomeone you've confided\nin for months or years?\nSomeone in your life\nwho you can truly trust?\nPerhaps you two are friends\nbut you think you're starting\nto develop feelings for them.\nAfter all, being close friends\ncan be the perfect foundation\nfor a potential relationship\nin certain situations.\nLet's take a look at a few telltale signs\nof whether your affection\nfor this special person\nis actually attraction.\n(light music)\nNumber one, you spend the\nmajority of your time with them.\nSpending a lot of time\nwith this special person\nin your life really allows you\nto understand who they truly are.\nThe different aspects\nthat make them the person\nyou care about so much.\nIf you're starting to develop\nfeelings for this person,\nyou may go out of your way\nto spend time with them,\ngetting to know them better\nand understanding their personality more.\nThis level of closeness\nhas a notable impact on relationships,\nwhether they're platonic or romantic.\nAccording to \"The Introduction\nto Social Psychology\"\nwritten by professor in\npsychology Dr. Jennifer Croyle,\n\"Proximity or physical\nnearness has been found\nto be a significant factor\nin the development of relationships.\"\nSo if you find yourself\nspending more and more time\nwith this friend of yours,\nit's likely that they could\nbe more than just a friend.\nNumber two, you think about them often.\nWhen you spend a lot of time with someone,\nyou think about them often.\nThis could be in the form of daydreaming\nor thoughts about them\nthat keep coming to you\nduring your day-to-day activities.\nConstantly thinking about your friend,\nreflecting on your conversations\nand time spent is a pretty\nworthy sign of attraction.\nMost of the time,\nthese thoughts could just\nbe running through your mind\nwithout you really noticing them.\nBut even when you're not hanging out,\nyou may feel a sense of\nconnection to their presence.\nSo the next time you find\nyourself mentally drawn to them,\njust think about whether\nthey might be more\nthan just a friend to you.\nNumber three, you care about them deeply.\nReal attraction comes\nfrom genuine affection.\nYou care about this person\nand try to be there for\nthem when they're in need.\nYou help pick them up when they fall.\nYou're aware of the little\nthings that bring them joy,\nand know how to make\nthem smile on a bad day.\nAnd they most likely\nwould do the same for you.\nYou have an inner intuition\nabout how they may be feeling at any time,\nand you've built a great\nbond between the two of you.\nIf you really, really\ncare about your friend\non a different level,\nit could mean that you're falling\nfor this special person in your life.\nNumber four, you're comfortable\nbeing vulnerable around them.\nIs this person your\ngo-to during rough times?\nA shoulder to cry on?\nWhen you're really close to someone,\nyou feel comfortable being vulnerable.\nYou feel that they're your safe zone\nto vent out your feelings\nin the most honest way\nand express your inner concerns\nabout basically anything under the sun.\nAccording to Carrie Krawiec,\na licensed marriage and family therapist,\n\"Feeling safe, comfortable, accepted,\nand understood as a person\nis the root of attachment,\nconnection and intimacy.\"\nThis deep level of intimate understanding\ncan be a huge sign of something\nthat goes beyond a platonic friendship.\nSo pay closer attention to your\nvulnerable moments together.\nThe way this person takes\nthe time to listen to you\nand provides you guidance\ncan mean a lot more than you would think.\nNumber five, you care\nmore about your appearance\nwhen you're with them.\nDo you find yourself being more\nconscious about how you look\nwhen meeting this friend?\nIt's completely normal, a\npart of human nature even\nto care about your appearance\nwhen you're attracted to someone.\nThe level of attraction\nyou feel towards someone\ncan significantly impact this desire\nto appear particularly well-dressed.\nSo if you find that you're\nespecially concerned\nabout the way you look when\nyou're around this friend,\nyou're likely more attracted to them\nthan you would have thought.\nNumber six, you feel possessive over them.\nHumans are very territorial species.\nWhen they're is any person,\nplace, or thing that we value,\nwe find the need to\nprotect it at all costs.\nYou may be interested in\nwho they hang out with\nand what they're doing.\nOf course, this is only\nacceptable to a certain point.\nBut if you feel particularly\npossessive about someone,\nyou likely care about them.\nAnd if you care about\nsomeone to the extent\nthat you feel so possessive about them,\nthey're probably more\nthan just your friend.\nNumber seven, you dream about them.\nDreams often signify or reflect\nyour real life experiences.\nAlthough scientists, researchers,\nand philosophers alike have\ntried to crack the code\non what they mean and why we dream,\nmost agree that there is a\nrelationship between dreaming\nand the subconscious mind.\nAccording to the late Dr. Charles McPhee,\n\"Dreams are practical\nreflections of feelings\nand concerns that were\npresent in your mind\nat the time you had the dream.\"\nHe also adds, \"Dreams\nare selfish in the sense\nthat they always concern issues and events\nthat were weighing on your mind\nat the time you had the dream.\"\nSo if you catch yourself\nwaking up from a dream\ninvolving you and this good\nfriend of yours together,\nit's your subconscious mind\nhaving fun with the inner truth.\nAnd number eight, you're\nvery involved in their life.\nLast but not least,\na huge sign that you're\nfalling for your friend\nis if you're highly\ninvolved in their life,\nand no, not in an overbearing way\nbut in a way in which you\njust know what they're doing\nand going through at the moment.\nTheir ups and downs, their past struggles,\ntheir current joys.\nYou're usually part of everything,\nor at least aware of most of it.\nYou go out of your way\nto make time for them,\nand you would drop everything\nto go see them if they need you.\nThis could go beyond\na platonic friendship.\nIt could be a great start\nto a beautiful, sustainable relationship.\nSo did you relate to any of these signs?\nRemember, it's completely up to you\nregarding how you go about\nyour personal relationships\nin life, friendships, or others.\nMake the best choice for yourself\nbecause you know yourself best.\nAs always, good luck with your journey.\nDid you find this video insightful?\nTell us in the comments section below.\nPlease like and share it with friends\nthat might find value in this video too.\nMake sure to
