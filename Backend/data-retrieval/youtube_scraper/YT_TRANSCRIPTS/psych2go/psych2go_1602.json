consider hitting the subscribe button.\nThis encourages YouTube's algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content\nto more people out there.\nHey, Psych2Goers, welcome\nback to another video.\nFirst off, we'd like to thank you\nfor all the support that you've given us.\nPsych2Go's mission is to make psychology\nand mental health more\naccessible to everyone.\nNow, let's begin.\nWhat do you do when you feel anxious?\nHave you noticed yourself turning\nto your favorite comfort food\nwhen you're stressed out?\nFood plays such a large\npart in your everyday life,\nfrom biophysical development\nto social development,\nbut oftentimes you might forget\nthat it also plays a role\nin your mental health.\nIn moments of stress, it can be tempting\nto distract yourself with food\nas it can provide you\nsome comfort and relief,\nbut sometimes it can actually aggravate\nwhat you may already feel.\nSo here are six foods that\nmight be worsening your anxiety.\nBefore we begin, we would like\nto mention that this video\nis created for educational purposes only,\nand is not intended to substitute\na professional diagnosis.\nIf you suspect you may\nhave an anxiety disorder\nor any mental health condition,\nwe highly advise you to seek help\nfrom a qualified mental\nhealth professional.\nNumber one, sugar.\nDo you often find yourself\nreaching for something sugary\nwhen you feel stressed or tired?\nThis may be because\nsugar suppresses activity\nin the\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,\nwhich can give you the temporary illusion\nof feeling more relaxed.\nYou may also be reaching for sweets\nbecause you think it would give you\nan extra boost of energy.\nHowever, studies have\nshown that it actually\nhas no positive long-term\nimpact on your mood.\nIn fact, a recent 2019 study found\nthat it increased the\nchance of mood disorders\nin men and recurrent mood\ndisorders for men and women.\nNumber, two coffee.\nCan you go a day without a cup of coffee?\nI can't.\nAlthough there are many\nhealth benefits to coffee,\nthere have been studies that found\na strong association between\ncaffeine and anxiety.\nA 2008 study found that\ncoffee blocks adenosine,\na brain chemical that makes you feel tired\nand triggers the release of adrenaline,\nwhich may result in anxiety.\nIn fact, some of the symptoms you get\nfrom drinking too much coffee\nare similar to symptoms of anxiety.\nHeart palpitations,\nnervousness, and restlessness\nare just some they have in common.\nNumber three, aged,\nfermented or cultured foods.\nDid you know that cheese and cured meats\ncan affect your anxiety?\nThis is because during\nthe fermentation period,\nthese foods release biogenic amines\nthat accumulate the more it ages.\nOne of these amines is histamine,\na chemical that helps your\nbody get rid of allergens.\nHowever, when you eat foods\nthat are high in histamines,\nsuch as wine, cheese, and cured meats,\nit can produce an intolerance\nwhich can increase\nyour adrenaline levels and\nlead to anxiety and insomnia.\nNumber four, nightshades.\nDo you enjoy eating potatoes, tomatoes,\neggplants and berries?\nFoods like these belong\nto a class of vegetables\ncalled nightshades.\nWhile they do have many health benefits,\nthey're also known to produce\ntheir own form of pesticide\ncalled glycoalkaloids.\nThis mainly targets\nearthworms and insects,\nbut can be harmful to humans\nbecause it blocks the enzyme\nthat helps produce a neurotransmitter\nnecessary for you to sleep.\nIt may ultimately result\nin sleepless nights\nand more frequent bouts of anxiety.\nAlthough nightshades carry\nthis neurotoxin in small doses,\nit can accumulate over time\nif you eat them frequently.\nNumber five, gluten.\nDo you tend to go for the\ngluten-free option when you eat?\nGluten refers to a\nspecific group of proteins\nfound in cereal grains, such\nas wheat, rye and barley.\nIt can cause intestinal inflammation\nand also aggravate mental health issues.\nIn fact, there is literature\nlinking celiac disease\nto mental health issues,\nsuch as anxiety and depression,\nthough there is not an exact explanation\nfor how they are related.\nOne popular theory deals\nwith the bidirectional communication\nbetween the gastrointestinal\ntract and the brain.\nThey suggest that any alteration\nin intestinal permeability,\na hallmark trait of celiac disease,\ncan eventually develop\npsychiatric manifestation.\nAnd number six, processed foods.\nDo you find it really difficult\nto avoid processed foods?\nWhile they are convenient\nif you're in a rush or\nin the mood for a snack,\nthey can have adverse effects\non your mental health.\nThis is because processed foods\nlike savory snacks and\nmicrowave-ready meals\ncontain high amounts of sugars and fats.\nSuch high amounts of\nsugars can create spikes\nin your insulin levels\nand produce anxiety.\nAdditionally, these\nfoods are typically low\nin essential vitamins that\nare necessary for your brain.\nHave you made changes to your diet?\nDid it help you feel less anxious?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you have on this video
