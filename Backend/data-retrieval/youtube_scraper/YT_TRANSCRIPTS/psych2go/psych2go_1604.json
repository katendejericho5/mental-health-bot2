    "transcript": "- Hey, it's Amanda\nSilvera, one of the voices\nof Psych2Go,\nand I wanted to share\nsomething really cool with you.\nI guess you could call it a fun fact.\nDid you know that plants have brains?\nThey do.\nIt's their roots.\nThere's just something about that\nthat I just find so\ninteresting and so cool.\nI was sitting on my patio\nwith a cup of coffee,\nand I was looking at all\nof my little baby plants\nand my lavender bush,\nwhich I had to chop down substantially\nbecause it had all turned gray,\nand I noticed today that it's green again.\nPlants have always brought me peace,\nand I'm always so fascinated\nby their inherent intelligence.\nI told my friend, and he said, well,\nif potatoes are roots\nand roots are brains,\ndoes that mean we're deep-frying brains\nand dipping them in ketchup?\nI guess he's right."
