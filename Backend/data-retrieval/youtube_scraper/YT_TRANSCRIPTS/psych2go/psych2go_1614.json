    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nDo you or someone you know\nsuffer from depression?\nDepression is a serious mental illness\nbecause of the negative impact\nit has on people's lives,\nbut also because it can go unnoticed\nfor long periods of time.\nLots of the symptoms\nare hard to recognize.\nThis results in a large number of people\ndownplaying their depression\nand confusing it for\nsimply having bad days.\nAnd because of this,\npeople are, more often than not,\nbattling depression by themselves.\nBefore we begin, this video\nis for educational purposes\nand is not a substitute\nfor professional advice,\ndiagnosis, or treatment.\nSo to shed more light on this topic,\nthis video will be discussing\nsix habits of depression\nyou might not know about.\nNumber one, faking smiles\nand pretending to be okay.\nHow often do you think\ndepression is diagnosed\nin people who don't appear to have it.\nFaking smiles and pretending to be okay\nis one of the habits that\npeople with depression have.\nPeople who suffer from depression\noften work to conceal it.\nThey'll feel like they're\nbringing others down\nif they let their inner\nstruggles show on the outside.\nHowever, this forced happiness\nis very hard to maintain.\nEventually, the underlying\nemotions that are being felt\nsuch as sadness,\nhopelessness, or loneliness\nwill show through.\nNumber two, eating too much or not at all.\nHave you noticed yourself\nor someone else either eating\ntoo much or not at all?\nExtreme changes in eating patterns\ncan suggest the presence\nof depression in someone.\nPeople with depression that eat too much\nare turning to food for comfort,\nwhile others lose their\nappetite because of a low mood.\nWhichever the case, depression\nwill become more severe\nthe longer that this habit persists.\nPeople's self-esteem\nwill take a hit as well.\nNot eating enough\nwill naturally result in\nlower energy levels too,\ncontributing to more depression.\nNumber three, neglecting personal hygiene.\nHave you gradually become less interested\nin your personal hygiene?\nNeglecting personal\nhygiene is one of the signs\nthat suggest someone is\nsuffering from depression.\nA lot of people think that good\npersonal hygiene is a given\nsince it's part of one's daily routine.\nHowever, for people who\nsuffer from depression,\nany of these so-called simple tasks\nmight become a huge burden\nbecause of how depression\naffects people's energy levels\nand mood.\nThey'll feel like these daily activities\nare simply too draining for\nthem and not worth the effort.\nAgain, depression will feed\noff the negative impact\nthis habit results in and\nbecome more severe over time.\nNumber four, in need of\nconstant distraction.\nWhen was the last time\nyou spent time reflecting\non your emotions?\nOne of the habits of\npeople who have depression\nis that they'll constantly\ntry to have something\ndistracting them.\nThe main reason for this is\nthat they don't like being alone\nwith their negative thoughts.\nSome people may keep their TVs turned on,\neven when they're not watching anything.\nOthers prefer to be on\ntheir phones or social media\nevery time they're free.\nDon't get me wrong,\ndoing these things does\nnot automatically mean\nthat you're depressed.\nHowever, doing these things\nwith the sole purpose of\navoiding negative thoughts\ncan be a very telling sign.\nNumber five, always thinking\nof the worst-case scenarios.\nAre you or any of your friends\nconstantly thinking of\nthe worst-case scenarios?\nThis habit can be a telling sign\nthat someone is suffering from depression.\nAlways thinking about\nthe worst-case scenarios\nis something that can be\nuseful from time to time\nso that you can respond to\nanything that comes your way.\nHowever, constantly coming up\nwith the most negative possible outcome\nwill affect your overall perspective.\nThis negative cycle of thought\nwill continue to feed off of depression,\nmaking you feel even worse.\nAnd number six, losing\nconcentration and focus.\nDo you struggle with\nstaying focused on work\nfor long periods of time?\nDoes it when you know constantly\nlose their train of thought\nduring a conversation?\nHaving the habit of\nconstantly getting distracted\nand struggling to focus can\nbe a sign of depression.\nLoss of memory and concentration\nare common symptoms of depression.\nA study conducted in 2014\nshowed that both of these\nwill worsen the illness\nby making work and personal\nrelationships more challenging.\nSo do you see any of\nthese habits in yourself\nor those around you?\nIt might be a good idea to\ntry talking with someone\nwho you trust and will\nemotionally support you.\nSimilarly, if you notice a close friend\nor a family member showing these signs,\nbe there for them and offer your support.\nOf course, please consult a\nmental health professional\nif you or someone you know\nsuffers from depression.\nDid you find this video valuable?\nTell us about it in the comments below.\nPlease like and share with friends\nthat might find
