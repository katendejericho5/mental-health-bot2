Dr. Bradwejn, very\nhappy to have you here.\n- Well thank you for the invitation.\n- Yeah, I'm very, very excited.\nWe have over 1,000 people joining us.\n- Oh, that's great.\n- Yes, already.\nI'm sure many of them will\nbe joining later on as well,\nand so I'll begin with an introduction\nfor the whole community\nto learn more about Dr.\nBradwejn's amazing work.\nSo Dr. Bradwejn is a\npsychiatrist trained in medicine\nat the University of Sherbrooke,\nand psychiatry at McGill University.\nHe is a professor emeritus\nand ex Dean of Medicine at\nthe University of Ottawa,\nfounding dean at the\nOttawa Shanghai joint school of medicine,\nand visiting professor at the\nShanghai Jiao Tong University\nSchool of Medicine,\nand is presently a professor of psychiatry\nat the University of Montreal.\nHis research interest has been the field\nof anxiety disorders,\nand he has since expanded his\nwork to integrate biological\nand psychological approaches\nto treat these anxiety disorders.\nHis work has been shared\nin over 350 educational\nmedia interventions,\nand Psych2Go is so grateful\nto be a part of one of them.\nWe hope that these\neducational media interventions like these\nhelp spread positivity and understanding\nabout psychiatry as a field\nand to increase the\naccessibility for us all.\nSo thank you Dr. Bradwejn for joining us.\n- Well thank you for inviting me, Monica.\n- I'm very excited to jump right in\nto the questions that we have received,\nstaring with the questions relating to\ngeneral anxiety disorder.\nSo the first one is from Greta\nwho commented on our YouTube.\nShe asks for some of our community members\nwho might not know, can\nyou tell us the difference\nbetween just experiencing anxiety symptoms\nand anxiety disorder?\nSo really talking about\nthis distinction between\nthis common feeling of worry\nthat I'm sure many of us experience\nversus when it warrants something,\na professional to intervene for instance.\n- Yeah, so I think the easiest\nway to make the difference\nis how, the intensity of the anxiety,\nthe type of the anxiety,\nand how much it effects our life\nand our functioning, our\nwell being and functioning.\nBut if we backtrack a\nlittle bit in terms of\nunderstanding the differences\nbetween the anxiety disorders,\nand how they may differ\nfrom one to another,\nthere are some simple,\nwe could say guidelines,\nto make a difference.\nAmong all of the anxiety disorders,\nand we say anxiety also\nmean fear, worry, tension,\nso excessive negative emotionality.\nIf you see, if you understand\nthe difference in symptoms,\nthen you can understand how\nthey have been classified,\nand how this leads to a disorder\nor a category of disorder.\nSo first, if there is the\nappearance of panic attacks,\nso panic attacks is a sudden experience\nof high anxiety with a\nfear of losing control,\nfear of dying, with\nmany physical symptoms,\nincluding difficulty breathing,\nbeing dizzy, having nausea,\nand they happen very suddenly,\nthey reach a peak.\nSometimes they can last\nfor 20 minutes or more.\nAnd then they come back,\nthey come back, they come back.\nSo that is very, very\ncharacteristic of panic disorder.\nSo the appearance of panic\nattacks that come back,\nand that after a while\nbecome a source of fear\nof having another attack.\nSo that's called anticipatory anxiety.\nSo typically I experience\nmy first panic attack\nout of the blue for no reason,\nand it's so bad, it's so frightening,\nthat I'm very afraid to\nhave another panic attack,\nand I become very afraid\nto have a panic attack\nin a situation.\nIt could be outside, it could be driving,\nit could be in a classroom.\nSo I'm so afraid to have the\nattack in this enviornment\nthat I avoid going to this environment.\nThat's when we speak about agoraphobia.\nSo it's panic disorder with the fear\nand the avoidance of going places,\npanic disorder with agoraphobia.\nSo that's one type of disorder.\nAbout 4% of the population,\nnot uncommon.\nIt starts around adolescence,\nand peaks around the 20's and 30's,\nand then it can continue for a long time.\nSo that's panic disorder.\nThen you have a form of anxiety\nwhich happens mainly with social context.\nSo it's not worrying about things\nor not being tense all the time,\nor it's not having panic\nattacks out of the blue,\nit's being very nervous\nin connecting with people,\ntalking to people, doing\nthings in front of people,\nspeaking up in class,\nspeaking up in a meeting,\nmaking eye contact.\nSo that is characteristic\nto social anxiety disorder.\nSo typically it starts very young.\nIt may start with something\nwe sometimes call shyness.\nIt's very excessive.\nIt's excessive.\nAnd it continues and continues,\nand then it can become\nworse and worse and worse\nto the point that people avoid\nmany social interactions,\nso social interactions in social settings\nlike going to meeting friends\nand parties, or\nprofessionally or generally.\nSo that's social anxiety disorder.\nVery different from panic\ndisorder and agoraphobia.\nWith panic disorder people say\nI'm afraid of a panic,\nbut I like to be with people.\nI would like to be with people more,\nbut I'm afraid to go out\nbecause I may get a panic attack.\nBut when there's people\naround I feel better.\nSo that's the difference\nbetween panic disorder\nand social anxiety.\nSocial anxiety is the people,\nhard to be with people.\nSo then you have the other category,\nwhich is characterized by excessive worry.\nSo that means always thinking about\nthe most minor things in life.\nAnd constantly think about them\nand being worried that\nsomething bad may happen.\nIf there's a bill to pay,\nthey think about it the whole month\nbefore having to pay the bill.\nIt's constantly thinking about everything\nthat would, with\nnervousness and with worry\nto a point where it's much more intense\nthat the average person\nwouldn't even think twice\nabout all these minor things in life.\nAnd it's felt, nervousness,\nbut also nervousness with\nirritability, tension,\ndifficulty relaxing,\ngeneral muscular tension, headaches,\nsometimes trouble breathing,\nnot like during a panic attack,\nbut never feeling quite\nwell, not sleeping well.\nSo that's what is called\ngeneralized anxiety disorder.\nSo the core feature is that worry\nwith all the other symptoms.\nSo that's the difference between\nthe main anxiety disorder.\nPanic disorder characterized\nby panic attacks\nand with fear of having them.\nSocial anxiety is nervousness\nin social situations.\nAnd generalized anxiety disorder\nis that very excessive worry\nwith negative emotionality,\nirritability and tension.\n- Yeah, that's a really, really good way,\na nice summary for people\nto quickly understand.\nAnd I just would like to also ask\nfor those who kind of suspect\nthey might have one of these disorders,\nwhat would you recommend\nthese people to do,\nespecially those who might not\nhave access to psychiatrists\nand psychologists,\nwhich unfortunately is a major problem\nin the mental health field today?\n- Yes, well the first thing\nis to get an evaluation.\nAnd for panic disorder,\nand also generalized anxiety,\nmany, most of the family\nphysicians, for example,\nor primary care providers,\ncan make the difference between the two,\ncan also detect this problem.\nWhat is still a challenge\nis social anxiety disorder.\nIt's often not well detected.\nAnd also people who suffer from it,\nthey're afraid to ask for help,\nand connect more and more with people\nto get that help.\nBut for panic disorder,\ngeneralized anxiety,\nprimary care professionals,\nfamily physicians are able to detect\nand make the diagnosis.\n- Do you have any thoughts on how\nyou can encourage those\nto take that first step\nthe patient reach out for help?\nBecause I know that sometimes\nit can be quite difficult,\nand that's why there's a large lag\nbetween when someone\ntruly feels the distress\nand actually going to go\ndo something about it.\n- Yes, well the first step\ncan also be psychoeducation.\nThere are many sites,\nmany website out there.\nGood, very legitimate websites\nwhere there's description\nof these anxiety disorders,\nand one can start by\naccessing the information\nand start to recognize themselves\nthere are sometimes some self assessment,\nlike scale that can be used\nfor generalized anxiety,\neven panic, social anxiety.\nSo that's the first step\nis to get information.\nBut reach out, reach out.\nReach out to primary care givers,\nand so that's because\nthat's the first entry point\neventually to get a confirmation\nthat that may be the problem.\nAnd then eventually\naccessing the treatment,\nwhich can be medication,\nit can be psychotherapy,\ncan be combined interventions.\nThe first thing is to just reach out.\nReach out.\nThey are in many, many jurisdictions\nthey are not entry points\ninto primary care and the system\nwhere through these first evaluations,\nsome detection and psychoeducation\nthat leads to access to a professional.\n- And do you have any resources\non the top of your head\nthat you think are quite reputable\nand accurate for the\ncommunity member to access\nshould they wish to do so?\n'Cause we can definitely\nadd them in the description box below.\n- Yes, well depends on where they live.\nIn Canada, for example,\nthere's Anxiety Canada.\nThere are also some proventional websites.\nIn the U.S. there is a website\nthrough the National\nInstitute of Mental Health,\nor the American Association\nof Anxiety and Depression.\nIn the UK, many of the healthcare,\nthere are very good websites.\nThe official government websites\nwith very good information\non anxiety disorders,\nsame thing in Australia.\nSo it's basically going\nto the official websites\nand others like Anxiety (indistinct).\n- Yeah, that's great.\n- Yeah, one thing I may say though,\nbecause, is, and that I think\nis an important piece of information.\nAnxiety disorders often\nstart early in life.\nIf you take social anxiety disorder\nit starts in childhood.\nEven around primary school.\nGeneralized anxiety can be a bit later,\nbut it's still early,\nsame thing with panic disorder.\nSo they are often the starting points\nof suffering and problems\nand complications.\nSo what we typically see\nis at the onset, the start\nof an anxiety disorder,\nwith time more and more suffering,\nand more and more discouragement\nand difficulties in life\nthat can lead to depression.\nAnd that suffering, both the anxiety,\nand eventually the depression,\ncan also lead to some seeking\nrelief through substances,\ntypically alcohol, cannabis, and so on.\nSometimes the challenge is that\nwhen one goes through that whole sequence\nof the primary anxiety disorder,\neventually depression,\nand using substances,\nand at that point it can\nbecome a confusing picture\nof what is the main problem?\nIs it the substance use,\nthe alcohol or cannabis and so on?\nIs it the depression?\nIs it anxiety disorder?\nStudies have been very,\nvery clear on that.\nStudies that look at course\nand see what happened\nwhen the first symptoms appeared.\nMost of the time, a\ngreat measure of the time\nis that you first have\na problem with anxiety,\nthen you get a problem with depression,\nyou get problems with substances.\nSo if at some point you\nsuffer from all of this,\nlook for the anxiety\ndisorder in the beginning.\nAnd that will, it's very important because\nif you seek help for substance\nor the depression,\nthe core problem, the\nprimary problem sometimes\nnever gets dealt with and can reappear.\nSo that's an important\npiece of information.\n- Oh, I see.\nI think that was also the distinction\nmade between the DSM-IV\nand five between the axis\none and axis two, et. Cetera,\nis that it?\nI don't quite remember,\nbut I remember one being the\nprimary sort of diagnosis,\nand then there are some\nthat just compound it.\n- Yes, that's right.\nSo that's the axis one mainly,\nwhich is the axis of the disorder.\nAxis two is what is the personality,\nwho experiences that.\nBut eventually looking at the axis one,\nwhen there is a number of problems,\nto anxiety, depression, use of substances,\nvery, very frequently it's,\nthe primary problem is anxiety\nand a secondary problem can be depression,\nsubstance abuse,\nor eventually depression\nand tertiary complication\ncan become the substance\nbecause it's through self treatment\nto relieve the suffering.\n- And on that point,\nwhen we always go back\nto seeing if anxiety\ndisorder is the root problem,\nis that the first thing that psychiatrists\nwould target treatment it,\nor the subsequent things first,\nor the most distressing things first?\nWhat is the first point of treatment?\n- So it's often the most distressing thing\nbecause even though an anxiety\ndisorder might be primary\nthe complication at some\npoint may be predominate.\nSo the depression may be so deep\nthat it has to be addressed first.\nOr the substance use is bad,\nso it has to be addressed first,\nor conjointly with treating the anxiety.\nBut that's why during an\nevaluation with a professional\nmuch effort is put in understanding\nthe whole sequence of event,\nright, the chronology.\nEven starting from who their parents were,\nhow much anxiety disorder in the family,\nhow many of them had other problems\nsuch as depression or alcohol use,\nwhat medication they may have had to use.\nAnd then when did the\nanxiety problem start?\nSo that means some digging,\nasking questions more and more\non how early the problem started.\nSo that gives a very, very good\nchronological description of the problem.\nAlso for the person suffering\nit makes more sense.\nIt makes more sense,\nyeah I was so shy when I was a kid\nand so on,\nand after a while it was so hard,\nI couldn't go to school,\nI couldn't do this,\nI became really down,\nand that was hard\nso I started drinking\nand so on and so forth.\nSo that understanding of one's history\nis very useful,\nand is also very useful in understanding\nwhy we may want to focus more\non the alcohol problem right now\nin addition to the depression,\nbut eventually going back to the root\nwill be very, very useful\nto feel fully well.\n- Right, makes a lot of sense.\nAnd for those who are wishing to\njust manage the most distressing\ncomponent of the disorder,\nso if we're gonna specify on anxiety,\nwe actually have a question\nwhere Zoe from discord has asked\n\"How do I lesson my anxious,\nnervous, worrisome disposition\n\"that kind of compounds\nwith everything else?\"\nWhat is something\npractical that they can do?\n- So going practical even without knowing\nwhat the core problem may be,\nthere still are some\ntools that can be used.\nSo it's useful to look at it\nat very simple, basic dimensions.\nThe body, the emotions and the thoughts.\nSo at the level of the body,\nanxiety can be decreased by\nlearning to breathe properly,\nand usually to use what is called\ndiaphragmatic breathing rather than\nupper chest breathing to be\nable to relax the muscles,\nsometimes using a bit of exercise\nor mind/body techniques such\nas yoga, chignon and so on.\nThat can already, already\nlessen the suffering\nat the level of the body suffering itself.\nA good diet and so that's important.\nThe level of emotions\nis learning to recognize\nthe various types of emotion,\nespecially to see the difference between\nnegative emotions such as anxiety, fear,\nanger, guilt and so on,\nand positive emotions,\nso calm, joy, courage\nand so on.\nSee the difference and\nstart to be able to learn,\nto cultivate the positive emotions,\nand learn some techniques\nto lessen the stress,\nthe anger and so on.\nAt the dimension of thought\nis to understand how our thinking,\nthe way we think can\nlead to much more fear.\nSo, for example, the way we may analyze\nand give interpretation to things\nthat happen to us,\nwe could come to conclusions\nthat are much more pessimistic\nor much more scary than to\nfairly moderate balance,\na conclusion that is much more optimistic\nand solution solving.\nAnd that's where in anxiety disorders\nyou have a type of thinking,\nit's called catastrophic thinking.\nSo the most minute thing\nthat may happen to us,\nwe see it in a way that's\ngonna be a catastrophe,\noh my God, this will happen,\nI'll get fired,\nor I'll lose so much money,\nor lose my friends and so forth.\nAnd it is a very negative,\nand amplified negative conclusion.\nSo learning this, learning\nthis type of process,\nthought process in oneself\ncan help in rebalancing,\nbut it needs practice, it needs practice.\nIt's like learning to play music,\nlearning everything.\nIt can be learned by means of practice.\nSo that's the answer to the question,\nvery simple things.\nThe body level, the\nemotions and the thoughts.\nThat's very, very simple.\nThere is also the behavior level,\npeople who tend to be very anxious,\nsocially anxious tend to\navoid a lot, to avoid.\nSo to recognize that avoidance\nof social situations, of talking to people\nor going places leads\nto more vulnerability\nbecause we avoid, we never\ntackle, we never try,\nwe never learn to be strong or courageous,\nand what we avoid becomes stronger\nand stronger and stronger.\nSo recognizing that\navoidance behavior in ourself\nis very, very useful.\nEventually is to do more events,\nto be something that scares us\nbut we learn to cope in it,\nwe learn to be strong in a situation,\nwe learn to have courage.\nSo that's another point of awareness\nthat's very, very important.\nDo I avoid a lot?\nOr do I face things a lot?\n- Yeah, I think that applies a lot to\nespecially the cognitive aspect\nof social anxiety disorder\nbecause as I was going\nthrough some of the questions,\nBree actually from Discord has been saying\nthat she is curious as to\nhow to stop overthinking,\nand I think that really\nspeaks to your point\nabout just not avoiding,\n'cause I feel like because\nit can be so difficult,\nthen they tend to avoid\nand then they overthink,\nand then it kind of could become\na catatastrophization sort of element,\nso definitely very\ncomplicated on that end.\n- It's complicated,\nbut it is learnable.\nWe can learn.\nAnd there are methods.\nThere are many methods.\nMany are the substance of\ncognitive behavior therapy,\nbut there's other approaches too,\nwhere the tools can be learned,\nand the tools are effective.\nSo for example in social anxiety disorder,\nin addition to medication,\nwhich might be necessary\nwhen it's extremely intense,\nwhen the biological\ncomponent is very intense,\na simple tool is exposure treatment,\nwhich is simply making a list\nof everything that seems scary,\nevery situation that is avoided\nfrom making, ranking the list\non the least scary, a little bit scary\nto the most scary, from\none to 10, for example,\nand then getting on the program of\nstarting to tackle going forward,\ngoing in situations that are scary,\nand learning to face the anxiety\nso that we, so that we can\nthen learn to calm ourself,\nand feel strong and feel in control\nand so on and so forth.\nAnd do it very, very\ngently and progressively.\nIt's called exposure and desensitization.\nThere are many techniques.\nWhile this is done also start\nto modify the way of thinking\nto rebalancing so not coming\nto the worst conclusion\nand worst scenario every time.\nSo all this can be learned.\nAll this can be learned.\nAnd sometimes basically done with\nthe combination of medication.\nAnd there is something\nthat we should mention\nabout medications,\npsychotherapy and so on,\nall of the anxiety disorders,\neven depression, you can start\nto understand their cause\nor etiology as being bio, psycho, social.\nSo they can be a biological component,\nand often that component\ncan even be genetic.\nWhen you look at,\nwhen you do a careful evaluation,\nfamily members, parents,\ngrandparents, cousins have it,\nso you already know\nthere's predisposition,\nand that's the biology part.\nAnybody is born with\na certain temperament,\nand a certain set of genes\nthat will determine\nwhat we will look like,\nwhat we will be like eventually,\nso that's the biological component.\nAnd then there's the\npsychological component\nthat each individual starts\nto use a way of understanding\nof himself, herself, life\nthat can be optimistic, pessimistic,\nscary, more courageous,\nso on and so forth.\nSo that's the psychological component,\nbio, psycho, social.\nAnd social is what can,\nor has happened to us.\nSo in addition to having been\nborn with some predisposition\nwith an anxiety disorder for example,\nwe may be born in an\nenviornment that's supportive,\neven privilege or in an enviornment\nthat would not be very supportive\nand not privileged,\nand event expose us to traumatic events.\nSo bio, psycho, social.\nSo these are the three main components\nthat can lead to some problems,\nof who we are, at some\npoint life experience.\nSo the treatment has to be well\ntailored to each individual,\nalso can be biopsychosocial.\nBio means biology decides\nand everything including medication.\nPsycho, psychological, so CBT\nand the various techniques\nthat can be used.\nAnd social, social environment\nto interact with and building\na good healthy social metric.\n- That's really great.\nI've always learned about\nthe biopsychosocial approach,\nand I really appreciated\nhow everything always\nwere very closely linked to each other.\nAnd on this topic of tools\nthat promote wellness,\nI would love if you would\ntell us a little bit about\nhow your clinical experiences\nhave motivated you\nto create the intrinsic practice,\nand perhaps talking about\nwhat intrinsic practice is,\nand how the community members\ncan best make use of it.\n- So out of my clinical\npractice appreciated\nbecause I specialize in anxiety disorders\nand depression and did a lot of research,\nand because the treatments\nwere quite effective,\nso may years ago there was a point where\npatients who came to see me\nand after treatment felt very good,\nbut it was a question of you feel better,\nbut what would it be for you to feel well\nand to stay well?\nSo not simply say we're\ntaking care of the symptoms,\nand you don't suffer from panic\ndisorder or social anxiety,\nit's more what would be the next step,\nthe step of wellness?\nSo then the research team and everything,\nwe looked into more\nwhat are wellness tools\nthan just treatment tools,\nincluding also at the time\nwhat was called alternative\nand complimentary medicine.\nSo we started to devise a package of tools\nto enhance wellness rather\nthan just treat the disease.\nAnd then when I,\nspent more time in administration\nand leadership, hospital level,\nand (indistinct) medicine,\nthere was a question\nof how can we stay well\nwhen we are in jobs\nthat are high stressed?\nOften physicians are jobs of high stress,\nmanagers and so on.\nAnd how can we stay well\nwhen we are in very intense\nacademy programs, medical\nstudents and so on.\nSo we said well okay maybe\nwe could have a package,\nwe could design a package of tools\nthat may be useful to stay well,\nbe more well.\nAnd the tools are based on the science.\nThe science from psychiatry, psychology\nand neuroscience,\nbut also from philosophy\nand spiritualties.\nAlso, can there be a collection of tools\nthat can be fully accessible\nand not commercialized?\nMeaning that anybody\ncould have access to it,\npay nothing, pay nothing\nbecause I was still worried\nabout the commercialization\nof many of the tools or\ntechniques that would be\ntotally free\nbecause they've been in the\npublic domain for many years.\nFor example, commercialization\nof certain forms of therapy,\ncertain forms of medication,\nso on and so forth.\nAnd then selling expensive products,\nthat's a no, no.\nLet's do something, have a method\nwith all the tools\nthat people invest and put the time in it\ncould freely access,\nso now it's through a website,\nand use it,\nand to the extent that they want,\nand just with no claims,\nthat it may be useful.\nSo design the method and put it online.\nAnd what we've,\nit's something that needs to,\nrequires effort.\nIt's like going to a course,\nany course.\nA course on music, on\nsports, on golf, whatever,\nyou hae to go to the courses\nand do the homework.\nSo assuming the person\nis willing to do that\nto know oneself and feel better,\nand even feel happier,\nthat can be done online,\nand we notice looking at who accesses\nis that a good number of\npeople who access the website,\nabout 30% go back more than\n20 times, up to 200 times.\nAnd the age distribution\nof usage of the site\nis 18 to 25, 25 to 34,\nthat's the most use.\nSo at this point we assume\nthat the website is useful\nbecause people go back to it,\nand go back many times.\nAnd so what we are now starting to do\nis a formal evaluation of\nits usefulness as well,\nbut for anybody who wants to use it now,\nit's accessible.\nSo it's, and I think you put\nthe link in the description\nso anyone can use it now.\n- Yeah, I've accessed it myself,\nand dare I remember it was\na six-step kind of process,\nis that correct?\n- That's right, yeah.\nSo to make it like a course\nbut that is experiential,\nlearning about oneself,\nstep one is how to start to\nset up a practice for yourself,\nknowledge, practice of wellness,\nwith some practical exercises.\nStep two is how to define what\nhappiness will be for you.\nSo not according to my definition\nor your definition,\nbut whoever uses the definition\nbased on one's strength,\nbased on one's specific attachments,\npeople things, what one enjoys,\nbut very importantly one's values\nand one's purpose in life.\nSo for one to define what\nhappiness would be for oneself.\nAnd then step three is self knowledge.\nKnowing about the body,\nknowing about emotions,\nknowing about thoughts, behavior,\npsychological mechanism,\n(indistinct) and so on\nfor step three.\nAnd step four is how to know\nan enviornment in more detail,\nwho we deal with, where the conflicts are,\nthe structures,\nand so on and so forth.\nAnd then step five is when we start to,\nbased on what we start\nto know about ourself\nand how we wanna be happy\nis to, in a very practical way,\nin situation by situation,\nmoment by moment,\nhow can we envision what it will be\nif we would use all of our strengths\n(indistinct) values on\nour side to be happy.\nSo use ourself and our\nunderstanding of ourself\nin a way that is conducive to happiness.\nSo to start to imagine\nit, visualize it, feel it.\nAnd step six is using\ntechniques to get there.\nSituation by situation.\nSo these are the six steps.\n- That's amazing.\nSo for those that just joined us,\nyou can access the intrinsic practice\nby clicking the link in\nthe description below\nand try it out for yourself.\nI love how it's just structured\nand it's self paced so\npeople can explore it\nat their own time,\nand hopefully get the benefits.\nIt's very exciting.\nFrom now, since we've\nalready covered anxiety,\nsocial anxiety and panic disorder,\nand we talked a little bit\nabout the intrinsic practice,\nwe'll now move on to the\nquestions that were asked\nduring the livestream.\nHow does that sound?\n- It sounds good.\n- So, I'm just gonna take two minutes to,\nless than two minutes to scroll through.\nThey might be a bit off topic from anxiety\nif that's all right.\nI see there are some questions.\nThank you to Ravensquad47\nfor the donation.\nThey have a question actually.\nThey asked, if possible\ncould you please talk\nabout manipulative parents,\nespecially, I guess in the context,\nof experiencing social or\nmental health challenges\nin such an enviornment.\n- Yes, and that's a\nvery important question\nbecause it's a question about how much\nfrom my experience as an adult\nreally depends on what experience,\nand depends on what am I capable,\nwhat is my inner potential?\nSo when we're born\nwe're totally dependent\non our environment,\nour parents, society\naround for basic needs,\nbut eventually more for\nour emotional needs,\nfor also an understanding of ourself.\nAlso knowing if we are\nworthy or not worthy,\nif we're okay, if we're complete,\nand getting support.\nSo when, in an ideal situation,\nthe parents can provide\nthis type of good affection\nand not excessive protection,\nbut more very balanced and\nsupportive relationship,\nthen we start to recognize\neasily in ourself\nthat we're worthy, we're\ncomplete, we're okay,\nand we can use all the\npotential that we may hae.\nThe potential to walk,\nspeak, and then so on.\nBut eventually all the other potential\nthat may be more psychological,\nemotional potential,\neven having courage, feeling secure,\nfeeling confident.\nAnd it's up to us.\nWe may use it and do the most,\nbut if we wanna get somewhere in life\nor do what we aspire to do,\nit still takes work\nand discipline and so on and so forth.\nNow there are some situations where often\nthe parents are not ideal,\nthey themselves may have difficulties,\nthey may have problems,\nsome may be mean and manipulative.\nSo what it means is that\nthis supportive environment\nwe will not experience,\nand this capacity to see\nthat we have the potential\nand we're complete and we're\nfull of capacity of potential\nwe may not have.\nWe may not think we're worthy.\nWe may not think we're normal.\nWe don't think we are adequate.\nAnd so on and so forth.\nAnd then we may not think\nthat we still have the potential\nto feel worthy and feel complete.\nSo we don't look inside too much\nto connect with what we haven't\nyet learned to connect with.\nAnd life is harder for us.\nHowever, psychologic\nis very, very important\nto think and determine a truth.\nWhat is our belief about\nthe power we have in us,\nand the power people or\nthe enviornment has on us?\nAnd that's where there's a notion called\nthe Locus of control.\nPeople, people who believe that\ntheir experience, their fate,\nwhere they feel bad is mainly determined\nby what people do to them.\nThe parents did to them,\nthe teachers did to them,\nsociety does to them\nare more in the reactive mode,\nand are more at risk to\nbe anxious and depressed\nand not do as well in life.\nPeople who believe that no matter what,\nno matter how bad my past was,\nno matter how bad my present is,\nat the end I am in control\nof my emotions, my thoughts.\nI'm the one who can say well,\nI face this, I can tap into my courage.\nSo that's called the\ninternal locus of control.\nLiving from the inside out.\nSo people who believe that,\nthat they're not victim\nwho react all the time,\nbut they are more people\nwith potential and strength\nwho can act on things,\ngood things, bad things,\nthese people have a much higher chance\nto have a better life.\nAnd also to be less anxious and depressed.\nSo, yeah, if we have manipulative parents,\nit has an impact on us,\nbut if we believe that\nwe still have control\nand we can still learn\nand overcome and use the\nbest of our potential\nthat is still there.\nThen we can overcome a lot,\nincluding the past.\n- Thank you for the very detailed answer.\n- I don't know if it's,\nif it makes sense,\nbut it's-\n- I think the internal Locus of control\nis quite powerful as well,\nso hopefully it's helpful\nto the person who asked the question.\nVery quickly, Mariana has\nalso asked another question.\nMariana says that they\nhad a psychotic episode\nback a few years ago,\ntheir mind is blank,\nand whether you could please talk about\nhow neuroplasticity works in that context\nof a psychotic episode.\n- So a psychotic episode\nis a break with reality,\nwith a lot of suffering.\nIt depends what type of psychotic episode,\nand when it happened,\nwhether it was spontaneous\nor drug-induced or not.\nThat's, that means that\nthere's a vulnerability\nthat's in the brain,\nwhether it may have been inherited or not.\nAnd that vulnerability lead\nto a break from reality\nwith a lot of suffering.\nBut the earliest,\nthe earliest that is recognized,\nand the earliest that a\ntreatment can be accessed,\nmedication, psychological treatment,\nsocial treatment,\nthe better it will,\nwhich means that even though\none may have experienced\na psychotic episode,\nwith good treatment, both\nmedication and psychological,\nthe potential for a\ngood life is very high,\nvery, very high.\nAnd it can be as high as anyone else.\nSo neuroplasticity is\nthat the brain can adapt\nand change so it's,\nwe don't know in many, many details what,\nwhen we mean neuroplasticity,\nhow we can influence the brain\ngoing the right direction,\nbut we know that with proper treatment\nthat things can change in a\nway that's better for health\nand for wellness.\nSo with proper treatment\nyou can rebalance the brain\nin a sense biologically\nby using medication and\nusing non-medication approach\nso that the brain can\nreadjust to be much healthier.\nBut the bottom line is\nthat life can be good.\nLife can be good.\nWhether we think it's true\nneuroplasticity or not,\nlife can be good,\nand so the earlier access\nto treatment the better.\n- Great, thank you so much for the answer.\nI know we are approaching the time,\nso I just wanted to\nanswer Michelle's question\nbecause we touched upon it earlier.\nHer question was what she can do\nregarding panic disorder and anxiety.\nSo we mentioned earlier about\nthe bio, psycho, social approach,\nso if you just scroll into,\nwhen you rewatch the stream,\nif you just scroll to the\nearlier part of the stream,\nthen you can have your answer,\nquestion answered there.\nAnd with that I think we\ntouched upon many topics today,\nand they were very, very useful.\nSo just to summarize we\ntalked about anxiety,\ngeneral anxiety disorder,\nwe talked about social\nphobia and panic disorder,\nas well as the intrinsic practice,\nand finally answering\nquestions from the community.\nI'd like to thank you all for joining me.\nI hope you enjoyed it,\nhope you learned a lot,\nand thank you so much Dr.\nBradwejn for your time.\n- Thank you, I enjoyed it.\nThank you, thank you very much.\n- Yes, I'm very appreciative\nof everyone being here.\nThank you to Cindy for\ncompiling all the questions.\nAnd yes, thank you once again\nfor being a part of our\neducation livestream.\n- Thank you.\nI thank you.\n- With that we will end the broadcast,\nand hope you all have a wonderful day."
