    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers,\nhave you ever spent nights\nbeing plagued by negative thoughts?\nPerhaps you get insecure about\ncertain aspects of your life\nor feel like something\nis about to go wrong.\nThese constant negative thoughts\ncan drive unnecessary fear\nand hinder you from being your best self.\nSo to help you conquer this,\nhere are six ways to\novercome negative thoughts.\n(gentle music)\nNumber one, recognize\ncognitive distortions.\nDo you have a tendency\nto think in extremes?\nPerhaps your friends didn't\nreply to you immediately\nand you assumed it meant\nthey don't wanna be\nfriends with you anymore,\nor maybe someone made a comment about you\nand you took it to mean\nthat they hate you.\nThis is a type of cognitive distortion\nknown as black and white thinking,\nand it can greatly harm\nyour mental health.\nRemember, your mind is so powerful\nthat it can convince you of something\nthat isn't necessarily accurate,\nwhich can reinforce negative thinking.\nThis is why it's important\nto make an effort\nto be aware of such\nthoughts and distortions,\nso you can start to\nchallenge these thoughts.\nNumber two, building distress tolerance.\nHow do you respond to stress?\nDistress tolerance is a person's ability\nto manage their internal emotional state\nand response to self inducing factors,\nwhich can include negative thoughts.\nThis requires the ability\nto take a step back,\npause for a few moments or a few days,\nto recenter yourself and then take action.\nKeeping calm in the face of stress\ndoesn't signify nonchalance\ntowards the problem\nor that you are suppressing your feelings,\nbut instead it allows you to feel\nin control of your emotion and behavior.\nInstead of letting your\nemotions control you.\nSome ways to help you\nbuild distress tolerance\nis to be aware of what stress\nfeels like in your body.\nThis may be labored breathing,\ntension in your neck or back,\nsweating or clenched fists.\nThese symptoms are normally felt\nbefore action is taking place,\nin between the stimulus,\nwhat is happening and the\nresponse, how you act,\nYou should take a moment to\nregain control of your body\nand thoughts, and later make a decision\non how to move forward.\nAfter all, you have the power to decide\nif you wanna act in accordance\nwith your temporary emotions and feelings,\nor if you wanna act based on\nhealthy logic, your values,\nand what's in your\nlong-term best interest.\nNumber three, changing the perception\nof the problem or reframing.\nLinda and Charlie Bloom MSW\nsuggested that another great way\nto overcome negative thoughts\nis by reframing the problem\nfrom one that is negative\nto one more hopeful.\nOne way of reframing is\nby redefining a problem\nas a challenge, for example,\ninstead of feeling defeated or powerless\nbecause you have to give\nup your dream school\ndue to financial problems,\nyou can try to apply for a scholarship.\nLook for financial help from\nappropriate institutions\nor perhaps work part-time while studying.\nReframing problems gives you power\nbecause you are owning your problem\ninstead of letting the problem own you.\nAre you suffering from stress or anxiety?\nAre you having trouble sleeping\nor having a hard time hitting REM sleep?\nWe want to thank Endel\nfor sponsoring this video.\nEndel is backed by neuroscience technology\nand the most unique part about it\nis it morphs music to time of day,\nweather, heart rate and location.\nIt'll calm your mind to create

applying\nself-soothing coping skills.\nThese skills are the first\naid for stressful thoughts.\nExamples of skills are A, affirmations.\nThese are short and powerful\nwords you can tell yourself\nto assist you in having positive thoughts.\nFor instance, I may not be\nin control of this situation,\nbut I have control over\nmyself and that is enough.\nB, deep breathing.\nHave you noticed that when you get upset,\nyour breathing automatically\nbecomes more rapid and shallow.\nDeep breathing can help counter this\nand make you feel more relaxed.\nC, replace thoughts with\ncognitive abilities.\nIf you feel that your\nthoughts overwhelm you,\ntry to put them aside for a little while\nand distract yourself with\nother cognitive based abilities,\nsuch as learning a new task,\ndoing crossword puzzles\nor Sudoku and D, replace thoughts\nwith grounding physical activities.\nAccording to a psychosomatic\nliterature by Wong,\ntriggering thoughts that activate\nthe fight or flight response\ncan be reduced through positive\nphysical touch and pressure.\nSome examples you can try\ninclude counting your breath,\nbringing attention to both of your feet\nand noticing how they feel on the ground.\nPlacing a hand on your heart\nor touching something soft,\nlike your pet's fur or a fuzzy blanket.\nNumber five, release judgment.\nDo you have some brutal\nopinions about yourself?\nSometimes, no matter how successful\nor happy you seem externally,\nyou may still hold on to destructive\nand judgmental thoughts about yourself.\nYou might compare yourself to\nyour ideal version of yourself\nor to other people and\nfeel like you fall short.\nBecause of this, it's important to learn\nto let go of such judgment,\neven if it's hard to do,\nit's definitely possible\nwith some practice.\nAnd in time, you may find yourself\nmore at peace with yourself.\nAnd number six, express your thoughts\nand feelings in a journal or\nwith people whom you trust.\nCan you talk about your feelings\nor do you tend to bottle them up?\nWhen you start to constantly ruminate\nover your negative thoughts,\nit can start to negatively\nimpact your day to day life.\nFor this reason, it's\nimportant to find healthy ways\nto express your thoughts and feelings.\nPerhaps you can find a\nclose friend or loved one\nto talk about it, or you can\nwrite them down in a journal.\nIf you're not too fond of writing,\nyou can also try out many\ndifferent kinds of journaling\nsuch as visceral journals,\nwhere you create sketches and drawings,\nor you can record or dictate your thoughts\nto a phone recorder.\nIf you find this soothing,\ncheck out Endel in the\ndescription box below.\nHave you tried any of\nthe tips we've mentioned?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found video
