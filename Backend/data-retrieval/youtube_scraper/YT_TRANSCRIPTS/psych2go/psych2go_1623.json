    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nThank you all so much for the\nlove and support, let's begin.\nWe all have attractive\nqualities within us.\nMaybe you're the comedic\ntype or the kind soul,\nor the sweet friend, perhaps\nyou're gifted in the arts\nor at chess, or maybe you're a math whiz,\nwhatever it is, that makes you stand out,\nodds are you hope your crush\nnotices these great qualities.\nBut what if we have a hard time\nshowing them to others right away?\nWhat if the person we\nadmire can't quite notice\nthe great things that make you you?\nWell, you could hope they\nwill eventually notice,\nor you can use a few psychology tricks\nto point them in the right direction.\nToday I'm gonna let you\nin on a little secret,\nwell, multiple secrets,\npsychological secrets.\nNumber one, buy a gift for\nyour crush and yourself,\nwho doesn't love gifts?\nYou may have considered\ngifting your special someone\nsomething they'd like,\nbut if you want them\nto bond with you more,\ngive yourself the same present as well.\nAccording to several studies,\nsomeone is likely to feel closer to you,\nif you give them\nsomething you own as well,\nresearchers call this\nbehavior, companionizing.\nThink of it this way,\nyou slide over a neatly wrapped\npresent towards your date,\nthey open it and to their surprise,\nit's a lovely, handmade\nbracelet, they appreciate it.\nBut then you roll up your sleeve\nand show that you too\nhave a matching bracelet,\na paired gift.\nNot only will they enjoy their gift more,\nknowing someone out there\nhas another part of it,\nbut they'll feel closer to you as well.\nNumber two, ask them for a favor.\nHm, a favor, wouldn't\nasking someone for something\ncause them to not like you?\nWell, according to the\nBenjamin Franklin effect,\nnot exactly, when we do\nnice things for someone,\nour brain will assume we like them,\nwhy else would we do such a kind favor?\nWe wouldn't do a favor\nfor someone we don't like.\nThis is called the\nBenjamin Franklin effect\nand it was used by Franklin\nto turn his haters into his best friends.\nWhen Franklin ran for his second term\nas Clerk of the General Assembly,\none of his colleagues\ndelivered a lengthy speech\nto the legislature, hating on Franklin.\nFranklin had judged this man\nmight become an influence in government,\nso he devised a plan to\nmake his enemy his friend\nwithout according to Franklin,\npaying any servile respect to him.\nAs a book collector and library founder,\nFranklin was known for\nhaving stellar taste\nin literature among many.\nFranklin wrote a letter to his rival\nasking to borrow a book from his library,\none which was a very\nscarce and curious book.\nFlattered, the hater\nsent the book immediately\nand received a thank you note\nfrom Franklin, when returned.\nThe next time he saw Benjamin Franklin,\nhe not only talked to him in\nperson with a new outlook,\nbut became good friends with him, wow.\nPlenty of studies have further proved\nthe Benjamin Franklin effect\nto be well, effective.\nSo go ahead and ask\nyour crush for a favor,\nthey may just find\nthemselves liking you back.\nNumber three, use the Triangle Technique\nfor engaging eye contact.\nSo you can't stop looking\nat your crush's dreamy eyes, can you?\nWell, you may have heard\nthat good eye contact\ncan make you appear more\nconfident and likable,\nbut you might want to take it easy,\nthe staring is kind of creeping them out.\nI mean, where's the line\nbetween confident eye contact\nand creepy staring?\nWell, to help you out,\nyou can try using the Triangle Technique.\nSimply imagine an upside down\ntriangle on your crush's face,\nimagine two corners over your crush's eyes\nand the third over their mouth.\nWhen you begin your\nconversation with them,\nshift your gaze to each point\nfor about five to 10 seconds,\nthis will help you appear\nconfident and interested,\nbut you do need to actually\nlisten to the conversation\nfor this to work.\nNumber four, show your positive side.\nPeople enjoy being around\nothers, who are happy.\nIf someone's encounters with\nyou are mostly positive,\nthey'll start to associate\npositive emotions with you.\nThis is good, because if\nthey're going to fall for you,\nthey have to be happy around you.\nThing is if someone is happy\nand sticks to that emotion,\nothers around them will\nstart feeling better as well.\nA research paper from\nthe University of Hawaii\nand Ohio State University\nsuggests that many individuals\ncan unconsciously tell what mood you're in\njust by being around\nyou, seems fair, right?\nSo if you're in a good\nmood, emit that energy,\nbring out your positive chi,\nwhoever you're around will\nlikely sense your mood\nand give in and feel happier around you.\nAnd number five, make a\ngood first impression.\nIt's no secret that first\nimpressions leave a lasting mark.\nAccording to a study published\nin the \"Journal of Social,\nPsychological and Personality Science,\"\nfirst impressions from\na photograph of someone\ncan influence another's judgment of them,\neven after they've met.\nIn the study, people would evaluate others\nbased on their photographs\nand then meet them.\nThe first impression\nthrough the photograph\ninfluenced the individual's\njudgment of the person,\neven after they met them formally.\nWhen you do decide to\nmuster up the courage\nto ask your crush out,\nleave a lasting impression,\na good one, it's a good\nstart for one thing\nand sooner or later, they\nmay be falling for you,\nbefore you know it.\nSo don't be late for the first meetings\nand emit that positive chi.\nDo you plan to use any of\nthese secrets on your crush?\nWhat do you like about your crush?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share this video with your crush\nand if you need more helpful
