what you see,\ndo consider subscribing.\nIt would help a lot\nwith YouTube's algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content.\nThanks for being here.\nHey there, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome to the channel.\nWhat are some things\nthat you're afraid of?\nOr things or situations\nthat make you uncomfortable?\nHaving fears and dislikes\nis a normal part of life.\nBut what happens when these\nthings completely take over?\nInterphobia.\nAnyone can have things they\nfear, even our beloved wizards,\nbut more on that later.\nA phobia is something that\ntakes a fear and intensifies it,\nso intense that it makes it\nhard to live a normal life.\nAny exposure to it triggers, invokes\nan intense anxiety response,\nincluding symptoms like\ndifficulty breathing,\nfainting and lightheadedness.\nYou might end up fleeing\nfrom the situation.\nWith that said, here\nare nine common phobias.\nNumber one, hemophobia, the fear of blood.\nDo you feel a bit squeamish around blood?\nWell, this much is normal,\nfor others, it goes up a notch.\nEver heard of people fainting\nat the very sight of blood?\nBlood is something we\nassociate to be inside of us\nand can be quite unsettling\nwhen it's visible outside.\nAs phobias are intense\nand disruptive fears,\npeople with hemophobia may\nfind themselves experiencing\nsevere anxiety symptoms\nwhen they're in situations\nwhere blood may be present.\nIn some cases, this\nphobia can be so severe\nthat it prevents people from\ntaking care of themselves.\nPeople with this phobia may\navoid medical professionals\nand getting important tests done,\nwhich can lead to problems later on.\nNumber two, trypanophobia,\nthe fear of needles.\nNeedles are never fun for anyone.\nPeople with this specific\nphobia have intense reactions\nto the sight of needles, let\nalone having contact with them.\nThis is especially hard\nin medical contexts,\nwhere needles are necessary for diagnosing\nand treating conditions.\nTrypanophobia is commonly\nseen in children,\nbut is usually outgrown later on.\nHowever, for some, the phobia is lifelong\nand will require intervention.\nNumber three, thanatophobia,\nthe fear of death.\nWhile having some kind of\nfear of death is normal,\nhaving thanatophobia makes\nit extremely difficult\nto live a functioning life\nas preventing death takes priority.\nPeople with the condition\nwill go to great lengths\nto avoid dying, far beyond\nwhat is generally accepted.\nWith thanatophobia, people\nwill find themselves\nunable to leave their house or\npartake in routine activities\ndue to irrational fear that\nsomething may happen to them.\nNumber four, athazagoraphobia,\nthe fear of forgetting or being forgotten.\nEver given thought to\nhow remembering works?\nThe idea that the people around\nyou will forget who you are\ncan be quite unsettling.\nSimilarly, the thought\nthat you may forget people\nand events in your life is also scary.\nWith athazagoraphobia,\nthese fears are amplified.\nOlder people or those\nwith a family history\nof Alzheimer's dementia\nor similar memory loss\nrelated conditions may\nexperience this phobia.\nThey may go to great lengths\nto prevent it from happening\nby taking memory enhancing supplements\nor by activities to prevent memory loss.\nNumber five, emetophobia,\nthe fear of vomiting.\nThe experience of throwing\nup is never pretty, right?\nEmetophobia is usually caused\nby some kind of traumatic\nexperience related to vomiting\nand can be related to\neither the discomfort\nor embarrassment of the act.\nFrom there, it picks up an intensity.\nPeople with this specific\nphobia may find themselves\nconstantly checking the\nquality of their food,\navoiding eating at unfamiliar places,\nanything to avoid vomiting.\nEven in situations where it is necessary,\nthe step to avoid the fear\ncan make the phobia stronger,\nmaking it extremely difficult\nto live a normal life.\nNumber six, claustrophobia,\nthe fear of tight spaces.\nHave you heard others throw\nthis word around at random?\nIt's important to understand\nthat it can be a severe situation\nand should be treated as such.\nThe term, claustrophobia\ntends to be overused\nin situations where\npeople find tight spaces\nto be uncomfortable.\nClaustrophobia is much\nmore severe than a dislike,\nand is a phobia that severely\nimpairs a person's life.\nPeople with the phobia may go to lengths\nto avoid tight spaces at any costs,\nmedical procedures like MRI scans\ncan be completely\nhorrifying causing people\nwith the condition to\nskip their appointments.\nSimilarly, some people\nwill even find it difficult\nto just sit in a car with the windows up\ndue to the tightness of the space.\nNumber seven, arachnophobia,\nthe fear of spiders.\nFollow the spiders.\nWere you in agreement with\nRon Weasley, when he said,\n\"Why does it always\nhave to be the spiders?\"\nSpiders are not always the\nmost welcomed creatures.\nThere gangly legs and plump\nbodies can surprise anyone\nwhen they show up in unexpected places.\nHowever, most people understand\nthat they likely have\nspiders in their homes\nand that they serve a purpose.\nOthers, however, cannot\nfathom living in a place\nwhere there might be a\nspider lurking around.\nFor some, just merely\nthinking about spiders\ncan be enough to trigger a response,\nlike when you know, there's an aragog,\nsomewhere in the Forbidden Forest.\nPoor Ron.\nNumber eight, autophobia,\nthe fear of being alone.\nDo you like spending time by yourself?\nFor many people, loneliness\nis an uncomfortable feeling.\nNormally, everyone likes to\nhave other people in life\nto share experiences with.\nHowever, for some, the idea\nof being alone is terrifying.\nPeople with this phobia will\nactively seek out others\nand will feel immense emotional distress\nif they are left by themselves.\nThis can occur even in situations\nwhere having other people is unreasonable.\nAnd number nine, agoraphobia,\nthe fear of inescapable situations.\nHome is where the heart is, right?\nBut sometimes the very idea of leaving\ncan cause an immense amount of stress.\nAgoraphobia is most commonly associated\nwith those afraid to leave the house,\nbut is actually much\nmore complex than that.\nThere are many different situations\nthat a person is exposed to\noutside that are uncontrollable.\nPeople with this phobia,\nmay find themselves avoiding situations,\nsuch as public transportation,\ngoing into places alone,\nor large open spaces with lots of people.\nThe uncertainty and\nalienness of this situation\ncan feel overwhelming.\nThis makes living a normal\nlife quite challenging.\nWhen fears actively make\nit difficult to live\nand maintain a functional life,\nthat's when they have\nmorphed into a phobia.\nThese conditions generally\nrequire treatment to get better.\nThere is no shame in fearing\nwhat others are really bothered about.\nIt's not wise to deny yourself\nliving a fulfilling life\njust to prevent others from labeling you.\nSo if you are struggling,\nplease don't hesitate\nto reach out to a mental\nhealth professional for advice.\nGetting in touch with the right person\nis a great first step to\novercoming your fears.\nWhat are some more common phobias\nthat are not on this list?\nAre there any that surprised you?\nWhat are some ways you\ncope with your own fears?\nLeave a comment down below\nabout your encounters with them\nif
