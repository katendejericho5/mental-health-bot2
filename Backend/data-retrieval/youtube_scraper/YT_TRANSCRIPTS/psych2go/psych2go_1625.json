    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Have you ever\nbeen in a relationship\nor had someone around you\nwho was in relationship?\nDid you think about certain\naspects of the relationship?\nNot knowing if it makes\nit stronger or weaker.\nIn today's world, where most of us\nare either surrounded by relationships\nor are in a relationship ourselves,\nit can be hard to identify what\nmakes a strong relationship\nand what doesn't.\nTo help you with that,\nthese are seven things\nstrong relationships have in common.\nNumber one, communication.\nIt is rightly said that\ncommunication is key.\nIf there's a gap in communication,\nyou may not be able to express your wants\nand needs to your partner and vice versa.\nNot being able to communicate properly\nleaves room for misunderstandings,\nwhich isn't something that one might want\nin a strong relationship.\nTelling your partner how you feel\nas soon as you notice something\nis the best approach to be open with them.\nDon't wait for it to go away.\nDiscuss it so you can\nbegin working on a solution\ninstead of hoping it'll resolve itself.\nNumber two, trust.\nTrust is one of the core\ncomponents of a relationship\nand must be there in\na strong relationship.\nOne, two people trust each other.\nThey give each other and\nthemselves a sense of confidence\nand empowerment.\nTrusting your partner will\nhelp your relationship\nand overcoming several\nobstacles along the way,\nbecause they know that no matter what,\nyou've got their back and vice versa.\nNumber three, compromise.\nNo relationship will have\nzero fights or arguments.\nEvery individual is different\nand has their own set of\nthoughts and opinions,\nwhich another person may not understand.\nHowever, wherever possible,\nit's crucial to strive\nto find win-win solutions\nthat will satisfy both\nyou and your partner.\nTry to find a way to build a path forward,\nbut some form of solution that feels\nlike a fair compromise to everyone.\nIn those moments, having\na common understanding\nof what compromise really means\nis both healthy and necessary\nfor the relationship to thrive.\nNumber four, alone time.\nHave you ever spent so\nmuch time with someone\nthat you sometimes just want\na few minutes to yourself?\nIf your partner is always reliant on you\nfor organizing arrangements\nwith friends and family,\nor even just planning date nights,\nand you want more independence\nin the relationship?\nIt could lead to conflict.\nFor example, some people require\nmore alone time to relax.\nWhereas others are more\nof a social butterfly\nwho feeds off the energy of others.\nIf you belong to the former type of people\nand feel guilty about not\nspending time with your partner,\nthere's no need to feel guilty\nabout spending time alone.\nCouples, regardless of how close\nthey are, benefit from\nindependence and alone time.\nAfter spending some time\naway from each other\nand taking time to do activities\nthat make you feel good,\nboth you and your\npartner will feel revived\nand in a better mindset.\nNumber five, a common goal.\nRelationship that are held\ntogether by a common purpose\nand vision for what they can achieve\nare the most meaningful\nand strong relationships.\nWhen two people share a common goal,\nthey feel like they're part of a team\nand the more likely to stick together.\nEven if you're dissatisfied\nwith the person\nwith whom you are in a relationship,\nif you have a common goal,\nyou're much more inclined to stick it out\nand find a way to make things work.\nPurpose builds relationships.\nAnd when you go out of\nyour way to find it,\nyour relationship\nimproves and strengthens.\nNumber six, forgiveness.\nHolding on to baggage weighs\nheavily on any relationship.\nResentment, dissatisfaction,\nand frustration.\nWhen left unresolved deplete\ntrust and drain your energy.\nWhen you can communicate\nhow you feel and let it go,\nyou know you're in a strong relationship.\nYou can overlook flaws and shortcomings,\nyou help each other out.\nYou move on after learning\nfrom your experiences.\nAnd number seven, you uplift each other.\nIn a strong relationship,\ntwo people constantly support each other\nand help one another grow\ninto a better version of themselves.\nIn the long run, uplifting each other\nwill also help your relationship flourish.\nDoes your relationship\nhave any of these traits\nor maybe you see it in\nyour friend's relationship?\nLove comes in several ways\nand someone who you love\nmay not come with these traits,\nbut that doesn't mean they\naren't a good partner.\nFind ways to work on these things together\nto have a stronger and\nhealthier relationship\nwith your partner.\nDo you think we missed something?\nLet us know in the comments down below.\nPlease like and share this with friends\nthat might find insight\nin this video as well.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the
