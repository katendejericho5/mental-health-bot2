    "transcript": "Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you know someone who's really shy?\nHave you ever wondered if\nthey're interested in you\nin a romantic way?\nUnlike people who are\nconfident and outspoken,\npeople who are shy often struggle\nto show that they're attracted to someone.\nThey may find it even\nnerve wracking sometimes\nto approach the person they like.\nThis can cause them to send mixed signals\nthat leave you more\nconfused than flattered.\nSo if you've ever wondered\nwhether that shy person from work\nor from your friend group\nis interested in you,\nhere are six signs a shy person likes you.\nNumber one, they have a hard\ntime keeping eye contact.\nDo they look away every time\nyou try to gaze at their eyes?\nAccording to Lisa Fritscher,\nthe act of avoiding eye contact\ncan mean that a person is uncomfortable\nin the situation they're in.\nBecause shy people generally find it hard\nto be around people they\naren't acquainted with\nor who they highly respect,\nthey may find it difficult\nto keep eye contact\nwith that person out of nervousness.\nSo if you notice them\ndiverting their eyes away\nand finding it almost\nimpossible to gaze at you,\nit might be a giveaway\nthat they're hiding something\nfrom you, such as a crush.\nNumber two, their friends pull\nyou in their conversations.\nHave you noticed their friends\nmaking teasing comments\nwhenever you spend time together?\nBecause shy people often\ndon't have the courage\nto directly approach the one they like,\nthey may try to get their\nfriends to help them out.\nThis may mean inviting you\nto their group hangouts\nor pulling you into their conversations\nand asking for your opinion.\nIf you find yourself in\na situation like this,\nit might just be a sign that they like you\nbut they're too shy to get close to you.\nWe want to thank Blinkist\nfor sponsoring today's video.\nWe often get questions\nabout where we get all our ideas from.\nA fair amount of them come from books.\nSometimes it can be hard to\nfind time to sit down and read,\nwhich is why we recommend Blinkist.\nBlinkist takes key teachings\nfrom thousands of nonfiction books\nand condenses them into small snippets\nthat you can read or listen to.\nOur favorite books are \"12 Rules for Life\"\nand \"The Courage to be Disliked\".\nWe recommend you check them out.\nThe first 100 people to go to

link in\nthe description below.\nNumber three, they remember\ndistant and vivid memories.\nAre they the type who likes\nto bring up old memories\nand talk about them in great detail?\nWhether it's the names of\nyour old pet, your birthday,\nor a time shared between you two\nthat seemed insignificant back then.\nA shy person who likes you\nmay bring up old memories\nas a way to comfortably approach you.\nRetelling old stories\nlike they've happened only yesterday\nmay just be their way of trying to connect\nand become closer with you.\nNumber four, they agree\nwith you in everything.\nDo they always seem to agree with you\nand what you have to say?\nOftentimes when you\nhave a crush on someone,\nit's likely you'll find yourself agreeing\nwith everything they say.\nIt may be because you\nwant them to like you,\nor because you genuinely\nshare the same values.\nWhatever the case,\npeople who are shy are\nalso likely to do this.\nHowever, because they\ntend to avoid situations\nthat involve confrontation or conflict,\nthey may stay quiet\nwhen they disagree with\ncertain things you say.\nNumber five, they throw\nsecret glances towards you.\nAre they always glancing at you\nwhen they think you're not looking,\nwhether it's because they're\nnervous about what to say\nor how to behave?\nPeople who are shy\noften have a hard time\napproaching their crushes.\nBecause of this,\nthey may end up staying a\ncomfortable distance from you,\nbut steal glances every so often\nin hopes to get your attention.\nIf you notice someone doing this,\nthey might just be trying\nto muster up the courage\nto get to know you.\nAnd number six, they're clumsy\naround you and only you.\nDo they seem to fumble and\nstutter when you're around?\nYour nerves system,\nwhich controls how you move your muscles\ncan sometimes function badly\nwhen you're stressed or in shock.\nSo if you show up\nunexpectedly to see them,\nthey may feel a sudden surge of anxiety\nand fumble in their actions.\nIt may be a sign that they like you\nif you notice them start\nto bump into people\nor stumble on the floor\nthe moment you show up.\nSo did you find this video
