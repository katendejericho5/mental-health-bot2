    "transcript": "- Remember Howie Mandel,\n\"Deal or No Deal\"?\nIt's not so funny now\nthat this could happen\nto something so serious,\nlike your relationship\nand your intimate\nsignificant other, or is it?\nRed flags can make or break\nyour potential relationship.\nAnd here are seven red\nflags to watch out for:\nNumber 1: Your core values\ndon't align with each other.\nIt's one thing\nwhen you don't enjoy the\nsame food or activities,\nbut it's another thing\nwhen you both disagree on certain values.\nFor example, how money\nor time should be spent.\nPeople get into relationships\nfor the wrong reasons\nall the time.\nIn general, people are\ndriven by sexual attraction,\nbut we disregard whether\nthe person is good for us\nin the long run;\nNumber 2: You stop laughing together.\nWhen the honeymoon phase is fizzling out,\ndo you suddenly realize\nthat they're no longer such a comedian\nand the jokes and topics are\nactually not so funny or sexy?\nNoted by UC Berkeley psychology\nprofessor, Dacher Keltner,\nfor couples who divorced\non average 13.9 years\nafter they were married,\nit was the absence of laughter\nthat predicted the end of their bond;\nNumber 3: You have different\nlifestyles and goals.\nAs mentioned before, if you\nlike dogs and they like cats,\nthen that's okay.\nBut if you like crocheting at\nhome and playing with your cat\nwhile watching Netflix,\nand they need to hang out with their bros,\ngoing barhopping and\ntailgating all the time,\nor if you ultimately\nwant to build a family\nand live in a white-picketed\nhouse with kids running around,\nand they wanna be the next Charlie Sheen,\nthen it's probably not the best match;\nNumber 4: You don't trust each other.\nDo you genuinely believe what they say?\nHow much of what they\nsay triggers an alarm?\nDo their actions align with their words?\nDo you stalk their social\nmedia for countless hours\ntrying to figure out if\nthey're honest, or vice versa?\nThis is a huge red flag.\nNumber 5: You're both toxic to each other.\nNo one is perfect. Everyone has a story.\nEveryone is flawed in their\nown ways and that's okay.\nWhat matters is that\nwe're able to be a support\nfor each other or to our own healing.\nHowever, if we're not aware\nof our trauma and triggers,\nwe may unconsciously end up\nbeing toxic to one another.\nNumber 6: Either one of\nyou is not committed.\nSuccessful relationships\nrequire commitment.\nSometimes our past trauma make\nus feel broken or insecure.\nWe may have unresolved trust\nissues or a fear of intimacy.\nIf that's the case,\nit's important to address them together\nor seek professional couple counseling;\nAnd number 7: You don't\nsee a future together.\nEven though you're happy together now,\nperhaps you don't really\nsee a future together.\nPerhaps your goals and\ntheirs don't align anymore.\nPerhaps there's someone out\nthere better for one of you.\nYou start questioning things.\nWhile it's normal to have\nwhat-ifs in a relationship,\nit's another thing\nif you can't picture this\nperson in your future.\nIf you identify with\nsome of these red flags,\nit's best to communicate\nthem as early as possible\nto your partner.\nYou might risk losing your\nrelationship right away,\nbut at least you will know\nwhether your partner is ready\nto address the issues together.\nIf possible,\ncouples counseling is not\na bad idea these days.\nDo you relate to any of these signs?\nCan you share your stories below\non how you may have overcome\nsome of these red flags?\nIf you like our content,\nbe sure to like this video\nand subscribe to \"Psych2Go.\"\nAs always,\nthanks so much for watching\nand we'll see you next time."
