    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey Psych2Goers,\never wonder what the secret to life was?\nWhat's the key\nto finding real lasting\nhappiness and fulfillment?\nor how to make all your dreams come true?\nchances are you probably have,\nbut what we don't realize\nis that figuring out what\ndoesn't make us happy\nis what's holding us back\nand getting in the way\nof everything we want.\nSo here are five of the most\ncommon things we struggle with\nthat hold us back from living\na great fulfilling life.\nNumber one, other people's opinions.\nAre you always changing\nhow you act and behave\nbecause of what other people think?\nDeep down inside,\nyou may know\nthat you shouldn't let other\npeople and their opinions\ndictate how you live your life,\nbut it's also only human to crave love,\nacceptance and approval.\nThis desire to belong\nand to receive validation\nfrom those around you\nmay make it easy to make the mistake\nof changing who you are\nto accommodate the people you care about.\nBut caring too much about\nother people's opinions\nto the point where you\ndon't even get a say anymore\nin what it is you want\nto do with your life\nmay only serve to trap you in\nlife of regret and resentment.\nNumber two, your relationships.\nAside from the opinions of others,\nyou may also be guilty\nof letting your\nattachments to other people\nkeep you from living your best life.\nPerhaps you're afraid\nto move to a new city\neven though you really want to\nbecause you'll have to leave\nyour closest friends and family.\nOr maybe you wanna go\nto a different college\nor declare a different\nmajor from your friends\nbecause you're afraid\nyou'll drift away from them.\nAlthough it's always nice\nto take the people you\nlove into consideration\nwhen making big life decisions,\nit's equally important\nto consider yourself\nand what you want as well.\nEven if you may think\nit's selfish to do so,\nprioritizing your own needs and wants\nis important for your own\nhappiness and wellbeing.\nNumber three, your past.\nDo you find yourself\nfalling into the same problematic patterns\nover and over again,\neven when you already know better?\nIt's been said that until\nyou heal from your past,\nyou create from your past.\nBy letting your past control your future,\nyou may be stopping yourself\nfrom getting to where\nyou really want to go.\nReal authenticity and happiness\ncomes from making peace with your past,\nletting it go\nand learning to be more intentional\nwith everything you do moving forward.\nAlign your actions with\nthe future you want\ninstead of the past\nyou're trying to outrun,\nand you might just find\nthat it radically changes\nyour life for the better.\nNumber four, negative emotions.\nAre you always looking for\nways to hide how you feel?\nNegative emotions are labeled as such\nbecause no one ever\nwants to feel that way,\nwhether it's anger, jealousy,\nhatred or fear.\nNegative emotions can feel corrosive\nto your mental and emotional wellbeing\nwhen you let them get the better of you.\nBut that doesn't mean\nyou should repress or deny them either.\nAll emotions serve a purpose,\nso when you try to\nrepress or dismiss them,\nthey may only build up and\noverwhelm you at a later time.\nInstead, you may want to try to identify\nwhy you're feeling this way,\nlearn from it\nand find constructive\nways to address the issue\nand resolve it.\nNumber five, limiting beliefs.\nAmerican businesswoman and\nmultimillionaire Mary Kay Ash\nonce said many people limit themselves\nto what they think they can do,\nbut you can only go as\nfar as your mind lets you,\nwhat you believe you can achieve.\nThere's certainly a lot of truth\nto be found in her statement\nbecause all too often,\nyou may find that you\nare your own worst enemy\nwhen it comes to achieving\nsuccess and happiness.\nAnd one of the worst ways of self-sabotage\nis when you buy into\nyour own limiting beliefs\nand let them control your life.\nPerhaps you think that you're only worthy\nif you have the love\nand approval of others,\nor that life is only worth living\nif you do something great.\nOnce you learn to overcome\nthese limiting beliefs\nand start believing that\nanything is possible,\nyou may find that your\npotential becomes unlimited.\nDid you relate to any of\nthese signs we've mentioned?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like,\nsubscribe and share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go post a new video.\nThe references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThanks for watching and we'll\nsee you in the next one."
