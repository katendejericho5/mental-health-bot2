    "transcript": "(gentle music)\n- [Instructor] Hey, Psych2Goers\nwelcome back to a brand new video.\nDo people describe you as\nkind and compassionate?\nNear the top of every list\ndescribing what everyone wants\nas a part of their personality\nis to be someone who has a good heart.\nThat's because the most\namicable people have a kind\nand compassionate heart,\nthat radiates joy to those around them.\nNobody can resist someone\nwho is consistently gentle,\n(indistinct) and accepting,\nbut sometimes it could be\npossible that you're not aware\nyou're a kindhearted person.\nAfter all, it's a\ndifficult thing to assess.\nSo if you're unsure, here are 10 signs,\nyou are genuinely kindhearted.\nNumber one, you value life\nmore than material things.\nAre you more excited at\nthe prospect of having\nnew experiences rather\nthan gaining new things?\nOftentimes people tend\nto hoard expensive things\nbecause they believe that\nthe more expensive the item,\nthe more happiness that will bring them,\nbut this means that they based their worth\non external items, kind hearted\npeople on the other hand,\nknow that your happiness comes from within\nand from the simple pleasures\nthat make life rich,\nlike friends, family, and\na sense of purpose in life,\nfor you, the importance\nof others is not measured\nby how much cash they\nhave in their wallets,\nbut by how much experience\nthey have in their hearts.\nNumber two, you don't pick sides.\nDo you find yourself getting sucked\ninto other people's drama?\nKindhearted individuals\nalways wanna help everyone out\nbecause of this,\nyou believe that there are\nalways two sides to a story\nand will refuse to pick a side\nwithout knowing fully what happened.\nToxic people will often try to use\nyour kindness against you.\nSo, it's important that you are careful\nto avoid participating\nin hateful conversations.\nNumber three, you're kind to everyone.\nCan you see people for who they truly are\nand treat them with equal kindness?\nA major sign that you're kindhearted\nis if you can show your\nrespect and kindness\nto everyone and anyone,\nthis may mean respecting\nthe desires and views\nof other people, taking a\nsincere interest in their lives\nor supporting them when\nthey're feeling down.\nThis isn't a way for you to\nshow off or to look better.\nIt's a habit of wanting\nto treat others the way\nyou would wanna be treated yourself\nwith kindness and respect.\nNumber four, you go that extra mile.\nAre you always helping others out?\nWhether it's staying to\nclean up after an event,\nspending time to make sure\nthings are properly done\nor helping someone in need.\nYou will go the extra\nmile for other people.\nFor many individuals in\nour fast paced world,\ntime is the most valuable commodity.\nSo it speaks volumes,\nwhen you're willing to spend\na weekend helping a friend\nor doing yard work for\nan elderly neighbor.\nNumber five, you always\nwant to understand others.\nYou try to learn about the\nworld as much as possible,\nwhether it's listening to\nthe stories of your elders,\ntraveling or exploring different cultures.\nYou're always trying\nto learn something new\nto better yourself, kind and wise people\nare never too smart to learn.\nThis love of learning may be\nwhat's pushing you to read,\nstudy, or find experiences\nthat enable you to develop\nand extend your understanding\nof the life around you.\nNumber six, you don't pass judgment.\nAre you able to see things\nfrom different points of view?\nAnother sign that you're kindhearted\nis if you have an open mind,\nyou'll keep all your\nthoughts and opinions aside\nand listen to people\nattentively with no judgments.\nThis doesn't require you to\nbelieve or condone what they do,\nit simply implies that\nyou avoid passing judgment\nlong enough to appreciate who they are.\nKeeping an open mind, also\nallows you to learn about\nnew and different ideas,\nand to see the world removed\nfrom preconceived ideas and judgments.\nNumber seven, you treat\nothers with respect.\nDo you treat everyone around\nyou with equal respect\nand decency?\nWhether they're a\nstranger, someone you know,\nyoung or old, you treat\neveryone with respect.\nA kind person will be courteous\nand thoughtful to their family,\nfriends, and even strangers\nafter all it takes true kindness\nand generosity to encourage others,\neven in the worst of situations\nto retain a sense of dignity.\nNumber eight, you value yourself.\nHave you set boundaries\nfor your relationships\nwhile you do care and value other people,\nyou know, not to do it\nat the cost of yourself.\nOne of the clear signs that\nyou are a kind individual\nis that you don't allow\nothers to walk all over you.\nA good heart comes from a strong heart.\nSo while you're willing\nto struggle financially\nwith someone for the greater good,\nyou're also going to insist\non being part of the\n(indistinct) they help create.\nNumber nine, you compliment\nothers when deserved,\ncomplementing is not only a good way\nto brighten someone's\nmood, but also a sign\nthat you can be excited about\nother people's triumphs.\nKindhearted individuals see\nthe good in other people\nand will often offer the spark\nthat may just help someone\nachieve their true potential.\nThis means you're willing\nto show sincere appreciation\nfor hard work and extra effort.\nYou give compliments when it's deserved.\nAnd after constructive\ncriticism, when it's warranted.\nAnd number 10, you are trustworthy.\nDo your do or say things that are sincere?\nAnother sign that you\nare genuinely kindhearted\nis when you're reliable and trustworthy.\nEven if it may be difficult to say or do,\nother people can depend\non you for your honesty\nand level headedness in every situation.\nYou are firmly grounded in reality,\nand are truly present at every moment\nbecause you aren't trying to\nwork out a personal agenda\nor thinking about personal gain or profit.\nDo you know someone who\nis genuinely kindhearted?\nLet us know in the comments below\nif you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe and\nshare
