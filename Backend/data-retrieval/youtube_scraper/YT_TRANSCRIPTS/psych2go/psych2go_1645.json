haven't and\nat the end of the video\nyou enjoy what you see,\ndo consider subscribing.\nIt would help a lot\nwith YouTube's algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content.\nThanks for being here.\nYou may have just given up on romance.\nYour last relationship was a burst.\nYou've been on way too\nmany awkward dates and now,\nromance seems to be the\nlast thing on your mind.\nLove is not in the air for\nyou, or so it may seem.\nDespite this, you can't help,\nbut ponder the question,\nwhen will my soulmate show up?\nYou do believe in soulmates, right?\nWhile you click this video,\nso even if you say you\ndon't, am willing to bet,\nthere's a bit of curiosity in you\nthat leaves you looking for the signs\nfor when they may show.\nBefore we begin, we want to remind you\nthat this video is for\nentertainment purposes only.\nIt's for fun.\nIt's not backed up by scientific studies.\nWith that said,\nhere are seven signs your\nsoulmate will show up soon.\nNumber one, you have romantic dreams.\nYou've just awakened from a dream.\nYour head is light as air,\nand your heart is swirling,\nand your stomach, yup,\nfull of butterflies.\nYou've been dreaming of romance.\nReportedly,\nmany couples who've practiced\nthe law of attraction\noften remembered that they've\nhad a surge in romantic dreams\nbefore they met their lifelong partner.\nSome have even reported\nrecognizing their soulmate\nafter seeing them in a dream,\nbut you don't need to dream\nthe exact face of your soulmate\nfor this to be a sign.\nEven if you don't remember the details,\nhaving a dream about your future soulmate\nor a vivid dream filled\nwith romance is a sign,\ntheir higher self may just\nbe reaching out to you.\nNumber two, you often see\nthe numbers, 11:11, or 111.\nThere you're minding your own business,\ngetting a quick coffee and a bite to eat,\nwhen you suddenly have an\nurge to look to your right,\nwhat do you see?\nA clock with the numbers 11:11.\nNext, you drive home\nand see the same numbers\nhidden amongst a billboard for KFC,\nonly $11 and 11 cents\nfor a bucket of chicken.\nThat's a good deal, you shout to yourself,\nbut then you also say, what a coincidence?\nYou brush it off as a coincidence,\nbut then you see the numbers again.\nThis time it's the last four French fries\nfrom your KFC meal.\nThey read out 11:11.\nThese sequences of numbers\nare often recognized as\nangel numbers by many.\nThe general belief is that they\nforeshadow something amazing\nand important that will be\nhappening in your life soon.\nMany important world events\nhave happened on the 11th\nday of the 11th month.\nAnd data revealed that\non November 11th, 2011,\nthere was a surge in\nthe number of marriages\nthat took place on that day.\nCoincidence?\nI think not, or well, maybe for that one.\nSome think it's a true\nsign of new beginnings,\nwhile others believe\nangels are trying to\ncommunicate something to you,\nmaybe that your soulmate is near.\nNumber three, you've been working\non yourself and self-love.\nWhile everyone could use more self-love,\nit's important to ask yourself,\ndo I love myself first?\nIt's important we love\nourselves and hold a trust\nor contentment with where we\nare and where we're going.\nLife can be a bizarre journey\nwith twists and turns.\nIt has its unexpected moments,\nbut the one thing we can\nstay true to is ourselves.\nThere are some who believe a\nsudden urge to better yourself\nmeans your partner feels the same.\nIt's thought to believe\nit's how you two will\nwalk towards each other.\nIf you've worked on\nself-love and self-care,\nyou probably have had a growth\nand appreciation for yourself.\nYour self-esteem may\nhave improved as well.\nUsing a good amount of time\nand energy to focus on yourself\nand your emotional\nneeds is very important.\nNow that you've made room for self growth\nand personal development,\nyou're ready for your soulmate.\nConfidence and positive\nthinking are believed\nto bring positive experiences\nand people into your life.\nNumber four, you know\nwhat you want in life.\nWhen you know what you want in life,\nthat confidence and security\nwill draw in a partner\nwho holds the same confidence.\nIf we really began to spend time\ndetermining what will truly\nmake us happy in life,\nwill likely develop a positive\noutlook on this decision.\nPositive thoughts are believed\nto bring positive experiences\nand people.\nSo your soulmate may be drawn to you\nif you present this light energy.\nNumber five, you begin\nto see love everywhere.\nAlong with the numbers 11:11,\nyou can't help but notice\nlove actually is all around.\nIt's everywhere.\nOn the subway, you can't help,\nbut notice a couple kissing.\nAt work, someone receives\na bouquet of roses.\nThe walk to your apartment,\nsomebody is getting\nmarried on your doorstep.\nWow, this really is a sign.\nIt's believed that reminders of romance\nare actually assigned\nthat your inner vibrations\nare on track with your true love.\nThis may be the universe giving you signs\nto prepare for when\nyou meet your soulmate.\nNumber six, new opportunities arise.\nWhile a cozy night watching Netflix\nsounds like the perfect cup of tea,\nhow are you supposed to Netflix\nand chill with your soulmate\nif you're too busy inside to meet them?\nThe best chance to meet your soulmate\nis to take any opportunity\nthat is thrown your way.\nWhile I may have implied\nsimply accepting your friend's request\nfor a night out on town, I\nalso mean any good opportunity.\nIf you find a new and exciting\nopportunity coming your way,\ndon't miss out,\nsay yes to as many of\nthe good ones as you can.\nThis is often the universe's\nway of giving you a chance\nto meet someone who can impact your life.\nIt may be desirable to simply stay in,\ncozy under the covers\nwith your favorite food\nas you watch the next\nseason of \"The Crown\",\nbut your soulmate won't\nburst through the doors\nwhile you're Netflixing\non last of the \"FBI\"\nor the pizza delivery man.\nAnd number seven, you trust\nyourself and the universe.\nAh, yes, the universe.\nWe did mention her quite a lot.\nA big focus on the law of attraction\nis to relieve yourself\nof the anxiety of goals,\nplace your trust in\nyourself and the universe.\nWhile goals are an important part\nof achieving what you desire,\nyou shouldn't rely on\nachieving them to be happy.\nInstead,\nfocus on trusting that all good\nthings will come back to you\nwhen you put good things\nout into the world.\nTrust and make peace with the idea\nthat you won't know everything.\nIt could be years or months\nuntil your true love shows up.\nYour soulmate could come\nknocking on your door\nany minute now, or the pizza guy.\nSo have you noticed any of\nthese signs in your life?\nWhat does your soulmate\nlook like in your dreams?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you
