people\nare always able to get their way?\nThese are people who have\nextremely high manipulative tendencies.\nThe reason they are hard to identify\nis that they employ\nrather innocent tactics.\nHowever, any innocent act\nwhen used with ill intent\nturns into a tool for manipulation.\nWe would like to emphasize that\njust because you may\nbelieve one way or another,\nyou are not automatically characterized\nas a master manipulator\nor a manipulator at all.\nThese are simply trends,\nnot hard and fast rules.\nSo with that said, here are 10 signs\nthat someone could be\na master manipulator.\nNumber one.\nThey don't always seem intimidating.\nDid you know that many manipulators\ndon't come off as intimidating?\nIn fact, a classic characteristic\nof a master manipulator\nis their charm.\nWho knew?\nAccording to a study,\nmaster manipulators often use their charm\nto perpetuate a cycle of abuse.\nThough charm is often associated\nwith a first impression,\nmaster manipulators use their\ntrait to their advantage,\nto reel someone back in or\nto mask negative thinking.\nNumber two.\nThey assume that humans\nare inherently evil.\nMirror, mirror on the wall,\ndo you believe all\nhumans are naturally good\nor naturally evil?\nAccording to psychologist,\nSusan Whitbourne,\nmany master manipulators\ntend to believe the latter.\nMaster manipulators tend to believe\nthat humans are inherently dishonest\nand are likely to take\nadvantage of each other.\nNumber three.\nThey find a practical\nnecessity for manipulation.\nBending ethics, misleading others,\nor taking advantage of\nothers for a greater benefit.\nSound familiar?\nMaster manipulators tend to justify\na practical need for manipulation,\nwhich could manifest in a number of ways.\nWith their line of thinking,\nthey are able to find justifications\nfor their misdemeanors with ease.\nProviding reasoning or justification\ndoesn't necessarily make\nsomeone manipulative,\nbut it's a good indication\nthat they aren't strongly\nopposed to the idea.\nNumber four.\nThey like to embellish stories.\nDo you know someone\nwho likes to exaggerate\nor embellish details\nwhen they tell stories?\nMaybe they add in dialogue\nor moments that never really happened.\nEmbellishment is pretty common\nand usually not ill-intentioned.\nHowever, at its core, it's\nstill a form of manipulation.\nOften, manipulators use\nthis embellishing technique\nto sway their audience\nto feel a certain way\nor to gain empathy.\nNumber five.\nTheir phrasing is ambiguous.\nDo they use phrases such\nas, your choice, but...?\nPaying attention to the\nlanguage of a master manipulator\ncan help you glimpse into\ntheir true intentions.\nWhile these praises are not usually used\nwith manipulative tendencies,\nthey do tend to sway others\ninto a different thinking pattern.\nYou are unconsciously steered\ninto doing it just their way\nbecause those expressions\nelicit an accommodating attitude\non the receiving end.\nNumber six.\nThey use passive aggressiveness.\nHas anyone ever used the\nsilent treatment on you?\nIt makes you wanna do anything possible,\neven against your will\nto get them to talk to you again, right?\nIt might be considered agonizing at best\nand painful at worst.\nThe silent treatment\nis one of the examples\nof passive aggressiveness,\ncontributing to manipulation.\nIt might seem less invasive,\nbut is equally potent.\nSome people tend to use such\npassive aggressive actions\nto guilt or shame others into compliance.\nOther common examples of\npassive aggressiveness\nare snide comments and even gossip.\nYikes.\nNumber seven.\nThey often use others for personal gain.\nDo you know someone who\ntends to always use others\nas a shield in the face of\neven the slightest adversity?\nIf so, it's a kind of coping\nmechanism that they employ.\nThe underlying mental disorder\ncauses potential effects on their moods,\nwhich encourages manipulative\nbehavior in them.\nAnd if they're maladaptive\ncoping mechanism\nto the underlying disorder\nis to use people and\ntake advantage of them,\nthey may come off as a mask manipulator.\nNumber eight.\nYou're scared to say no to them.\nAre you good at saying no,\nexcept when it comes to certain people?\nAre you scared of the way they may react?\nWhen you say no to a master manipulator,\nyou might be afraid of the\npressure they'll put on you\nto change your mind.\nIf this is the case,\nknow that you aren't weak\nfor feeling the way you feel,\nand the most important thing\nis to prioritize your own peace.\nBeing manipulated is never your fault,\nno matter how you're made to feel.\nNumber nine.\nThey talk in circles.\nDoes it feel like any sticky\nconversation with them\nsimply goes nowhere?\nThat's because they're\nnever gonna take you there.\nMaster manipulators dodge questions\nthey don't wanna answer,\nchange the subject a little too quickly,\nor deceive you into thinking you're wrong\njust to avoid admitting\nfault or compromising.\nThey tend to be very intentional\nand precise with their\nlanguage in these situations\nto avoid answering a question directly,\nwhile at the same time, trying to cover up\nand make the conversation\nprogress as it naturally would,\nall in one go.\nAnd number 10,\nthey're diagnosed with\na personality disorder.\nDid you know that manipulation\nmore often than not\ncan be a sign of a range\nof personality disorders?\nPsychologists suggests that in\naddition to Machiavellianism,\npersonality disorders,\nsuch as borderline personality disorder,\nobsessive-compulsive personality disorder,\nbipolar disorder, and\nantisocial personality disorder\ncan all increase someone's\ntendency to be manipulative.\nHowever, it's important to note\nthat acting on these\ntendencies is still a choice\nand having a personality disorder\ndoes not automatically make\nanyone a master manipulator,\nalthough it's common to want\neverything to go your way.\nThis might get in the way\nof healthy, long-term relationships.\nIt's always a good approach\nto seek professional help\nin assisting you to\nexplore the reasons for\nyour exhibiting manipulative tendencies\nor deal from its experience.\nIt helps to recognize reasons\npreventing you from making meaningful\nand healthy relationships\nand friendships with others.\nDo any of these describe your experience?\nLeave a comment down below\nabout your encounters with them\nif you'd like.\nPlease feel
