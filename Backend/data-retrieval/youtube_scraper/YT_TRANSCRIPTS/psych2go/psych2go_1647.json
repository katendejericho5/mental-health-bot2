    "transcript": "(cheerful music)\n- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nWe wanted to let you know\nthat your ongoing support helps us\nfurther in our goal to spread awareness\nabout mental health and psychology.\nThank you for the love and\nsupport that you've given us.\nNow, on to the video.\nSo, you have a crush,\nand maybe you've been texting\nthem for some time now.\nYou have a hunch that they\nmay just like you back,\nbut you can't decide if\nthey have feelings for you,\nor if they're, well, just being nice.\nThis can happen to all of us.\nTexting isn't as clear\nas face-to-face contact.\nWithout the social cues\nof tone and body language\nto back our observations up,\nhow are you supposed to tell\nif someone does, indeed,\nhave strong feeling for you?\nWell, to help you out,\nhere are some top tips\nto help you know if someone\nlikes you over text.\nNumber one, they text you first.\nIf you like someone,\nwouldn't you jump at the\nchance to talk to them?\nActually, better yet,\nour nerves can get in the way with that,\nespecially if we really like\nthe person, feelings intensify.\nBut if they're generally the one\nto initiate your conversations,\nit means they likely like you.\nMm, that sounds like a tongue-twister.\nNumber two, they send\nlong, detailed texts.\nIf they put the time into\ntexting you consistently,\nthey must care to some degree.\nBut if they send long texts,\nsometimes even paragraphs,\nthen they may be really interested in you.\nIf you ask them a question\nand they actually put\nthought into the answer,\nas shown by their paragraph,\nthen they actually wanna\nkeep the conversation going\nand may even open up to\nyou more in their texts.\nNumber three, they double text.\nWait, what?\nWhat on earth is double texting?\nThis is what double texting looks like.\nYou receive a text from someone you like.\nYou're too busy to respond,\nso you go about your business\nwith the idea you'll respond later.\nThey check their phone to\nfind you haven't responded,\nand felt the need to reach out again.\nThey send another text.\nSo, they cared enough\nto check their phone,\nsee you didn't respond,\nbut couldn't stop thinking about you,\nso much so that they had\nto tell you something more\nbefore you sent your response.\nThis is a pretty good sign\nthat shows that even if they\ndon't like you romantically,\nthey're at least a friend who\ncan't stop thinking of you.\nNumber four, they care\nand show concern for you.\nIf you find your crush\nwishing you a good morning\nor asking how you are frequently,\nyou're in for a good surprise.\nThese are signs that they like you.\nIn relationships, there should be more\nthan just physical attraction\nand shared similarities.\nPartners should also be\nemotionally invested in each other.\nIf the person you're texting\noften wishes you a good\nnight out of the blue\nwhen you haven't been\ntexting at a late hour,\nthey've been thinking of you.\nIf they're thinking about your\nwellbeing and show they care,\nit's a sure sign they\nhave feelings for you.\nNumber five, they send\nemojis, especially heart ones.\nHello?\nHave they been sending you heart emojis?\nWhat are you doing here?\nThey likely like you.\nOh, dang it with that phrase again.\nWe generally send emojis\nto lighten up the mood\nand convey our emotions.\nYou know? Emoji?\nI mean, you don't have\nto be emo to send one,\nyou just send one to convey emotion.\nNow, mostly everyone uses emojis,\nso don't quite jump at the idea\nif they use one or two.\nThey could just be kind or friendly,\nbut it at least shows\ntheir interest enough\nto keep the conversation lively.\nHowever, if they only\nrespond with a simple emoji,\nthey may not be trying\nto keep the conversation\ngoing as much as you are.\nThis could mean one of two things:\nthey're putting a simple\nend to the conversation,\nor simply don't know what else to say.\nBut if you make a move and\nthey continue using emojis\nwith more than just a\nbrief avoidant response,\nit shows that they're open\nto getting to know you.\nThere is research that shows emojis\ncan not only be a fun\nway to express yourself,\nbut help build further intimacy.\nAccording to a study from researchers\nAmanda N. Gesselman, Vivian\nP. Ta, and Justin R. Garcia,\nemojis can often be used\nas effective signals\nin modern social communication.\nTheir research suggests that emoji use\nmay provide a reasonable\nproxy for expressing effect,\nand may provide a useful\naid in self-disclosure\nand building intimacy.\nAs a result, using emojis\nwith potential romantic\nand sexual partners may, in turn,\nlead to more face-to-face opportunities\nto assess compatibility and attraction.\nSo, this may be a good sign\nthat you're getting closer,\nespecially with the heart emojis.\nNumber six, they ask questions.\nIf you find someone keeping\nthe conversation alive\nwith questions in their texts,\nthen they wanna talk to you.\nWhile some people can throw in\na few questions to be polite\nand not come across as rude,\nif they genuinely seem to\nkeep up the conversation,\nthey may just like you.\nIt's never a good sign\nwhen you're always having\nto ask questions to keep\nthe conversation afloat.\nNow, to the all important matter,\nif these questions mean they like you\nor want to be friends.\nAnd hey, everybody could use a friend.\nI mean, being friendzoned isn't the best,\nbut it's better than\nbeing completely rude.\nIf someone is asking\nyou personal questions,\nthen they may be trying to get to know you\nbecause they like you.\nWhen we like someone,\nwe not only want to continue\nconversation with them,\nbut actually know them.\nWe find ourselves caring\nabout the other person\nand wanna know the many details\nabout them and their lives.\nNot in a creepy way, though.\nDon't ask too many as if an interrogation,\njust emotional investment.\nSeven, they send selfies.\nDo you find someone sending you photos\nof themselves mid conversation,\nor simply out of the blue?\nThis is a telltale sign that\nthey're interested in you.\nPeople send photos of their day\nand funny memes all the time, but selfies?\nThey took the time to\ntake a photo of themselves\nto show just you what they were doing\nand what they looked like for the day,\nor to show you a face\nalong with their hello.\nAnd number eight, they text\nyou throughout their day.\nPeople can text for a morning or evening\nand then check in tomorrow as a friend.\nUsually, friends will\ntext us with a reason,\nbut if someone likes you,\nthey'll likely find themselves\ntexting you for no reason at all,\nbut to simply get another\nchance to speak with you.\nIf they text you throughout the day,\nthat means even more.\nYou can show they've\nbeen thinking about you\nas they go about their day.\nYou've been on their mind,\nand they just can't help but text you\nto see what you're up to.\nAnd number nine, they send flirty texts.\nHmm, you can't tell if they like you, huh?\nWell, do they send flirty texts\nalong with those heart emojis?\nWhat are you waiting for?\nMake a move, my friend.\nWhen people flirt over text,\nodds are, they like you\nand think you're cute.\nIt's important to note that they should\nat least initiate the\nflirty texts once in a while\nbecause what could be perceived\nas a flirty response to your flirting\nmight just be, well, a response.\nIt's best to take a look at\nthe thumbs up emoji again\nand ask the inevitable question:\nwere they really flirting back,\nor just, you know, giving me a thumbs up?\nAh, the flirtatious and\nirresistible thumbs up emoji.\nGets 'em every time.\nSo, based on these signs,\ndoes someone like you?\nIf so, what do you plan to do next?\nDo you like them back?\nLet us know in the comments.\nRemember, a few of these signs\nmay just mean they're\nsimply being a good friend,\nbut if your friend exhibits\nmore than just a few of these signals,\nwell, they may want to\nbe more than friends.\nIf you found this video helpful,\ndon't forget to click the like button,\nsubscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nThanks for watching,\nand make sure you share\nthis video with your crush.\nIt could be the perfect\nway to break the ice.\nYou never know, Psych2Go could bring you\nand your soulmate together\nfor years to come.\nDon't worry, you can thank us later.\n(upbeat electronic music)"
