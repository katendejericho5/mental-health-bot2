    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nDo you know what vibes are short for?\nHow would you describe\nthe aura around you?\nVibes are short for vibrational frequency\nand they're the main\ningredient of your aura.\nThe roller coaster of life\nlooks different for everyone.\nBut no matter what, it will\nhave both highs and lows.\nSurrounding yourself with\npositive energy and people\ncan maximize your\npotential for a happy life.\nAs the law of conservation states,\n\"Energy can neither be\ndestroyed nor created,\nrather, it can merely be transferred.\"\nThus, suffice it to say,\nyou have been surrounded by energy,\nwhether it be good or bad\nsince the second you were born\nand even before that.\nSo with that being said,\neveryone also radiates their own energy.\nIt's important to be mindful\nof what kind of energy each exudes,\nbut it's also crucial to be aware\nof the energy surrounding you.\nHere are nine signs you're being consumed\nby negative energy.\nNumber one, frequent mood swings.\nIt could just be your hormones\nor it could also be that\nyou're being overwhelmed\nwith negative energy, events, or people\nin your everyday life.\nIt may be difficult for one\nto release said energy immediately\nin a healthy, conscious manner.\nSo this energy may often resurface\nthrough emotional turbulence.\nNumber two, glass half empty.\nEver heard of the saying,\n\"You become who you hang around the most\"?\nWell, there may be some truth in that.\nNegative people often subscribe\nto the worst possibilities in life\nand they may subconsciously\nbe urging you to do the same.\nWhen you consistently\nsee everything around you\nwith a pessimistic approach,\nyou just might end up\nmissing the joys in life.\nThe way you perceive life\ncan often be indicative\nof your mental well-being.\nExtended periods of sustained pessimism\nare also linked to a multitude\nof sleeping disorders,\nheart disease, and depression.\nNumber three, social media junkie.\nDo you always have an inclination\nto check the latest tweet,\nInstagram post or Snapchat?\nOverconsumption of social\nmedia prompts you to compare.\nAnd as the saying goes,\n\"Comparison is the thief of joy,\"\nendlessly scrolling through the seemingly\nperfect lives of others might push you\ntowards discontent with your own.\nMore often than not,\nit can also lead to unhealthy addiction.\nYou may not be aware of it,\nbut negative energy often\nfinds its way into our laps\nthrough the social media updates\nof celebrities, brands, and even friends.\nNumber four, discouraging thoughts.\nDo you often find that\nyour harshest critic\nis your own brain?\nNegative self-talks such as,\n\"I look terrible in this\"\nor \"I just can't do it\" can\nseverely impair your self-esteem\nand limit your potential in the long run.\nLearning to appreciate and\nowning your not-so-perfect self\ncan help you take precautions\nto put up a barrier\nagainst such negativity.\nNumber five, you feel anxious often.\nThink about the times in which\nyou feel the most anxious.\nWhat triggers it?\nDo you feel particularly down\nin one environment compared to the other?\nCertain places and people\ncan heavily impact you.\nIt's important to stay\nvigilant of when and how.\nThis way you can avoid\nor find a way around them\nwhen you know they end up upsetting you.\nIt's also crucial for your well-being\nto also find a safe setting\nto let loose in life.\nBeing in the previous\nenvironment is unavoidable.\nNumber six, your funny bone\nhasn't been tickled in a while.\nWhen was the last time you really laughed?\nIs it difficult for you\nto indulge in a funny joke\nwhen consumed by a negative\ncomment someone made\nearlier that day?\nHumor and laughter are\noften underappreciated\nbut they're key to living\na happy fulfilled life.\nIf you haven't felt like\nlaughing much as of late,\nit could be a sign that\nyou're overinfluenced\nby negativity in your life.\nAs a result, you're unable to enjoy\nor appreciate the little things in life.\nEven things that made you laugh before\ncan lose their appeal.\nIt's always a good idea to\nnot let the blues get to you.\nThink chocolate.\nNumber seven, you've stopped\nworking on your hobbies.\nHow long has it been\nsince you last picked up that paintbrush\nor strummed that guitar?\nIs it difficult for you\nto find the motivation\nto work on a hobby lately?\nIt could be due to being\npreoccupied with stress\nand the negativity around you.\nYour hobbies and genuine interests\nshould provide you with relaxation\nand an escape from the noise of the world.\nBut when it no longer does,\nperhaps your surroundings have reached\na toxic level of negativity.\nNumber eight, extended\nperiods of isolation.\nHave social events that\nonce appealed to you\nlost their luster?\nIf you would not consider\ntouching another social invite,\neven with a 10-foot pole,\nperhaps the negativity\nof your surroundings\nhas caught up to you.\nMaybe your previous social\nexperiences have dissuaded you\nfrom stepping out of your house.\nOr the toxicity around\nyou leaves you drained\nto the point that you can't fathom\nputting in the extra\neffort for pleasantries\nso you resort to isolating yourself\nin order to take a break from it all\nas it is all left you\nfeeling unsure of yourself\nas well as others.\nHowever, it's important to\nmaintain a healthy social life.\nAnd to do so, it's beneficial\nto find your niche:\na location, or a set of people\nwho you find yourself truly\ncomfortable in or with.\nAnd number nine, environment of gossip.\nDo you often find yourself\nclutched in unrelenting gossip,\neven if it's not about you?\nGossip not only reflects\npoorly on its teller,\nbut it can make you\nself-conscious and more negative.\nBe aware of mean-spirited\nconversations in general\nand try not to engage in them yourself.\nBeing negative once in a while is natural,\nbut prolonged negativity\ncan dampen your spirits\nand greatly reduce your\nsatisfaction with life.\nIt's important to remember,\nlife is too short to\nremain trapped in a bubble\nof negativity and toxicity.\nIf you frequently experience\nsome of the situations mentioned,\nperhaps it's time to reevaluate\nsome of the situations\nand relationships around you.\nWe hope this can help you cleanse\nnegativity from your life,\nmaking way for the\nabundance of positive vibes.\nDo any of these describe your experiences?\nLeave a comment down below\nand feel
