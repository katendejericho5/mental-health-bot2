    "transcript": "Let us guess you have someone in mind\nand have no idea whether\nthey like you back or not.\nWe've all been there before,\nand sometimes it can feel\nlike grasping at straws,\ntrying to figure out if\nthe feeling is mutual.\nHowever, did you know, there\nare some surefire signs\nyour crush likes you back.\nFrom body language to verbal cues.\nIt's all in the details.\nIf you know what to look for,\ndeciphering romance, doesn't\nhave to be so complicated.\nWith that said,\nthese are seven signs your\ncrush may like you back.\nNumber one, flirtatious body language.\nDo they playfully hit your shoulder\nor fiddle with their hair around you?\nThis may sound surprising,\nbut people are generally pretty open\nwhen it comes to body language,\nit subconsciously gives\naway how they feel.\nThis means if they act as if they like you\nwith flirty touches\nand open body language,\nthey probably actually like you.\nIt seems obvious,\nbut sometimes you need a reminder\nto look for the seemingly basic clues.\nNumber two,\nthey respond to your texts instantly.\nWhen you text them, how long\ndoes it take to get a reply?\nWhen someone likes you\nthey'll prioritize your texts,\nthey'll be excited to talk to you.\nAnd when that notification pops up,\nthey won't be able to\nresist breaking into a smile\nand getting ready to think\nof the perfect response.\nOn the other hand,\nif they wait a few hours\nbefore getting around\nto reading your message,\nthey may be too concerned\nwith looking cool\nthan genuinely talking with you.\nIf this describes your crush,\nconsider rethinking whether\nthey're worth your time\nand energy.\nAfter all,\neveryone deserves someone\nwho prioritizes them.\nNumber three, they put\ntheir best foot forward.\nWhen you do hang out,\ndo they put effort into their appearance?\nDid they try to seem perfect?\nAnd as if their life is\ncompletely put together?\nWhen it comes to dating\nthis tradition of putting\nyour best foot forward\ncan be seen in our\nanimal relatives as well.\nFor example, birds tend to\npreen or groom their feathers\nto attract mates.\nWhat this means is, they\ntrying to look your best\nis a universal sign someone likes you.\nThey want to impress you\nand make you like them back.\nNumber four, they pick up your habits.\nHave they started using\nthe same phrases as you?\nDo they suddenly watch all the same shows?\nWhen someone really likes you\nthey'll make an effort to\nget to know your interests,\nwhether it be reading the same books,\nlearning about your favorite sport\nor picking up the same hobby.\nWhat matters is that they want\nto be a part of your life.\nSimilarly, when two people\nspend a lot of time together,\nthey subconsciously mimic\neach other's speech patterns.\nThey'll use the same phrases,\ntext the same way or tell similar jokes.\nSo if you and your crush\nsometimes seem to have the same brain,\nit's a good sign you both like each other.\nNumber five,\nthey tell you everything.\nAre you the only one who knows about\ntheir embarrassing childhood story?\nHow about the awkward secret\nthey've kept all these years?\nIf someone really likes you,\nchances are they'll trust you\nand be much more vulnerable\nthan normal.\nThis vulnerability also deepens your bond.\nSo it's incredibly important\nin any long-term relationship.\nIf this describes you and your crush,\nchances are they like you back.\nNumber six,\nthey remember everything about you.\nDo they know your birthday,\nyour first pet's name and\nso much more about you.\nWhen someone cares about you,\nthey'll put effort into\nremembering things about you.\nThey might even go out of their way\nto look at your social media accounts\nand bring you up in conversations.\nAs long as it doesn't\ncross any boundaries.\nThis is a huge sign that\nthey're crazy about you.\nNumber seven, they get jealous.\nWhen you hang out with friends,\ndo they ask who will be there?\nIt may seem unimportant,\nbut they could be asking\nbecause they want to know\nif you're interested in anyone else.\nHave you ever asked them about\na particularly close friend?\nThey could be feeling\nthe same slightly uneasy,\nthreatened way you felt\nabout the possibility\nthat they like someone else.\nDon't forget that you're\ncrush is a person too.\nThey're not perfect.\nAnd if they like you,\nthey probably get jealous\nand overthink things as well.\nThe bottom line is that\nno one can know for sure\nwhether the feeling is mutual.\nIt could be the both sides\nare too afraid to speak up.\nSo with that in mind,\ndon't be afraid to put yourself out there.\nYou don't want to have any regrets.\nAfter all, life is all\nabout taking chances\nand pursuing the things\nthat make you
