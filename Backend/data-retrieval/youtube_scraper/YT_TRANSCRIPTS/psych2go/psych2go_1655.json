    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nHave you ever wondered which\nlittle habits or behaviors\nyou could implement to\nattract people your way?\nThere are some subtle behaviors\nthat are often seen as sexy,\nsome of which you can make a habit of.\nYou may be wondering what these are.\nWell, here are six sexy habits\nthat drive others wild with attraction.\nNumber one, always learning.\nBeing smart has its payoffs,\nand it can be quite as sexy trait.\nThat's why it might be a\ngood idea to make it a habit\nto learn something new each and every day.\nThe more knowledge you possess,\nthe more intelligent\nyou may seem to others\nas they can learn a lot from you.\nA 2019 study wanted to determine whether\nsmart is seen as sexy.\nResearchers asked around 600 adults\nto rate a list of hypothetical people\nbased on how desirable they were.\nThey found that for everyone in this study\nfor all kinds of relationships,\nthere was a significant\ndesire to have a partner\nwho was either as smart\nas them or smarter.\nThe researchers state\nthat the sexiest found\nless intelligent partners less desirable.\nA more intelligent partner\nwas no more desirable\nthan a partner who was\nequal in intelligence.\nBut intelligence was particularly valued\nas a long-term mate.\nTime to get studying.\nNumber two, relax and use\ncalmer body language gestures.\nAre you a relaxed speaker?\nDo you use your hands\ndramatically when you talk\nto make a point?\nIn 2011 experiment by researchers,\nBob Dennis and Marielle Stel,\nthey discovered that\nusing non-threatening cues\nallows for someone's date\nto feel more comfortable\nwhen they're with them.\nMakes sense, right?\nThey found that using calmer,\nsmaller body language\ngestures, and speaking slowly,\nall added and making your\nnewly acquainted date\nfeel more comfortable,\nleaning back was also\nfound to be beneficial.\nSometimes we can forget that your date\nmight be a bit uncomfortable\nsitting across from someone they just met.\nSo calmer gestures while\nstill showing your personality\nis a great way to go.\nNumber three, be mindful\nduring discussions.\nIf you're nervous during a\ndate or around your crush,\nyour thoughts can often wander\nmaking mindful discussion\nsometimes difficult\nduring the first few\nminutes of an exciting date.\nBut it's best to practice mindfulness\nand remind yourself to\nbe present at the moment.\nIn an experiment published in 2015,\nresearchers found that men who are\nactively involved in a conversation\nas compared to being distant,\nwere seen to be more attractive\namong heterosexual women.\nThe authors write that\nmore research is needed.\nBut who doesn't find a\npartner that actively listens\nmore attractive?\nNumber four, they don't\ncheck their phone 24/7.\nHow often do you check your phones?\nHave you ever frequently\nchecked your phone\nwhile out on a date?\nAccording to research by global\ntech care company, Asurion\nAmericans check their\nphones 96 times a day,\nwhich comes out to be\nonce every 10 minutes.\nSo when someone appears\nso interested in what you have to say,\nthat they don't check their\nphone the whole conversation\nthat's quite often seen as sexy,\nif not simply attractive.\nPeople want someone who\nis emotionally present.\nIf someone's attention\nis off somewhere else\nwhile you're discussing an emotional topic\nthat can easily be seen as a turnoff.\nSo make it a habit to keep\nthe phone in your bag,\nand ringer off to vibrate.\nNumber five, don't try to be perfect.\nDo you try to be perfect on a first date?\nWell, a bit of imperfection\nand your capable personality\nmay just make someone wild for you.\nIn fact, people may find others\nwho aren't superbly perfect,\nand who even possess the\nrarity of these so-called flaws\nas more attractive.\nIn a research study,\nresearcher Elliot Aronson had\npeople write fake test takers\nbased on their attractiveness.\nTest takers would either\ndo great on a test,\nmediocre or poor.\nAs an imperfection some\ntest-takers would act clumsy\nand spill coffee at the\nend of the interview.\nAfter their scores were revealed,\npeople rated the test takers\nwho spilled coffee at the\nend of their interview\nthe highest on the attractiveness scale.\nWhat this means is that people wanna see\nthat you're an intelligent\nand capable person,\nbut also that you aren't perfect.\nThe study states a superior human\nmay be viewed as superhuman\nand therefore distant.\nA blunder tends to humanize him\nand consequently increases\nhis attractiveness.\nOthers may be intimidated if\nyou come across as perfect\nand make dumb mistakes,\nthey wanna see your human side.\nWhen you show you're capable\nand yet still relatable as a\nhuman being who makes mistakes,\npeople tend to like you more\nand may find you a bit sexier too.\nAnd number six, say their name often.\nHow often do you hear your\nname spoken mid-conversation?\nWhen we hear our name,\nit grabs our attention\nand catches our interest.\nWe enjoy our names so much\nthat we can even pinpoint out\nour own names being spoken\nby someone in a loud crowd or party.\nThis form of selective attention\nis related to the cocktail party effect.\nWhile in a crowded or loud room,\nwe can hone in on a specific\nconversation of our choosing.\nMore importantly, if our\nname is spoken nearby,\neven when we're focused\non another conversation,\nwe immediately perk up and recognize\nthat someone is talking about us.\nNot only will they have your attention,\nbut you'll likely feel better\nknowing they actually bothered\nto remember your name in the first place.\nIt seems it can be pretty attractive\nto hear someone you like say your name,\nit sure grabs your attention.\nSo make it a habit to\nremember people's names\nand call them by it too.\nSo will you attempt to\ndo these things more?\nWhich will you try first?\nFeel free to share with us\nin the comment section down below.\nIf you liked this video,\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share it with a
