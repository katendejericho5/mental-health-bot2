    "transcript": "- Hey, psych2goers.\nWe hope you're doing well\nand finding time to take care of yourself.\nLet's begin.\nDepression is a serious condition\nthat many people choose\nto handle on their own.\nSome people bottle up\ntheir emotions for years\nand try to remedy themselves\nbecause they fear being\nstigmatized or rejected.\nAlthough those with depression\nsometimes exhibits\ncertain behavior patterns,\ndepression looks and feels\ndifferent for everyone.\nWith that, here are five things\npeople with depression secretly do alone.\nAs a quick disclaimer,\nthe information in this video\nis not intended nor implied\nto be a substitute for\nprofessional medical advice,\ndiagnosis or treatment.\nAll content contained in this video is for\ngeneral information purposes only,\nand does not replace a\nconsultation with your own doctor\nor mental health professional.\nLet's begin.\nNumber one, they spend\ntheir energy fighting off\nother symptoms of depression.\nDepression is much more than\na psychological condition.\nPhysical symptoms, such as\nfatigue are common symptoms.\nBattling depression is\nextremely exhausting\nand leaves little motivation\nfor anything else.\nMost of their energy is to\nfight off other symptoms\nor to conceal their depression,\nleaving other aspects\nof their life neglected.\nIf you notice this in\nyourself or someone you know,\ntry to find time to take\nbreaks and focus on self-care\nor encourage others to do the same.\nTaking the proper amount\nof time to recharge\nand focus on your emotions is\nimportant to maintain balance.\nNumber two, they spend time\ndistracting themselves.\nHow much time do you\nspend on social media?\nSocial media is a powerful\ntool for connection\nand creative expression,\nbut often than not,\nit's a tool for escape.\nPeople with depression\nsometimes resort to social media\nas a source of distraction.\nHowever, it can exacerbate your symptoms.\nA 2019 study published in The Lancet found\nthat nighttime social media\nactivity disrupt sleep,\nwhich negatively affects your mood,\nmaking you feel more unhappy.\nAnother study conducted\nand published in 2018\nby The university of Pennsylvania found\nthat lesser time on social\nmedia leads to happier moods.\nHence if you notice that\nyou or someone you know,\nprefers to spend time\ndistracting themselves online,\nfind an alternative activity to substitute\nsocial media usage.\nPicking up a hobby or\nspending more time outdoors\ncan be helpful.\nNumber three, they're comforted by reruns.\nDo you have any movies or TV series\nthat you wouldn't mind watching again?\nFor people who experience depression,\nwatching reruns of old shows\nprovides comfort and nostalgia.\nThey offer a sense of\npredictability and safety.\nWatching reruns makes you\nfeel calm and at ease,\nand there's nothing wrong with that.\nPeople who experience\ndepression may exhibit\nmany different symptoms.\nRegardless of someone's behavior,\nyou should always extend\nkindness and compassion\ntowards those with mental health issues\nand towards yourself.\nNumber four, they might\nengage in habitual remedies.\nTo alleviate emotional turmoil,\nsomeone with depression may\nresort to coping mechanisms.\nRemedies like listening to music,\npainting, going for bike rides or walks\nare all generally healthy\nif they help you cope.\nHowever, some of these\nstrategies are unhealthy\nmaladaptive daydreams and\nromanticizing the past\nare examples of unhealthy\ncoping mechanisms\nas they distract you from your life\nand often make you value\nyour daydreams over reality.\nThey can cause a behavioral addiction\nthat leads to complete\nabsorption and fantasy,\nsocial withdrawal and\nneglect of everyday life.\nSome ways to deal with\nmaladaptive daydreams\nare to reduce fatigue and\navoid external triggers.\nHowever, the best way is to reach out\nto a therapist for help.\nAnd number five, sometimes\nthey may send a cry for help.\nIt can be insanely difficult\nto reach out for help.\nAlthough most of us tend to\nkeep our emotions at bay.\nIt's always beneficial\nto reach out to someone.\nUnfortunately, not many of us\ndo even though we may want to.\nMost times people who\nexperienced depression\nmay want to let others\nknow how they're feeling,\nbut fear of becoming burdens.\nHence they may make a passing\nremark disguised as a joke\nor type out a long text, but\nerase it before sending it.\nThese muted cries for help\nmay not always be noticeable,\nbut if you have a hunch that\nsomeone is trying to reach out,\nlet them know that you're\nalways available to talk.\nDo you relate to any of these points,\nor do you know someone who is\nstruggling with depression?\nTell us in the comments.\nThe truth is that our society\nis not particularly welcoming\ntowards those who walk around with scars.\nWe're discouraged from being open\nabout our wounds and fears.\nIt's this idea that causes those to try\nand deal with our conditions in secrecy.\nIf you ever need assistance or guidance,\nplease reach out to a licensed therapist.\nBe sure to like the video\nand share it with anyone\nyou feel might benefit from it\nand make sure to subscribe to psycho2go,\nand turn on the notifications\nto keep up with our uploads.\nThanks so much for watching\nand stay tuned for the next video.\nTake care."
