    "transcript": "because you're waiting for\nthe life you've dreamed of?\nWe should all have some goals to work hard\nand strive towards,\nbut they shouldn't become\na barrier to our happiness.\nMoney may not make you\nas happy as you'd hoped.\nThat dream job, years of\nhard work down the road,\nmay not be all it seemed to be.\nLife is unexpected\nso it's best to enjoy what\nyou have in front of you,\nand the journey towards\nyour dreams in the process.\nInstead of flooding your dreams,\nbe the only world in which\nyou can imagine a happy you.\nNumber two, you work to fulfill\nonly your materialistic desires.\nDo you look for happiness\nin materialistic goods?\nIs that the next iPhone, purse or car\nthat will make you happy?\nWell, those feelings of\nhappiness only lasts for so long.\nThe thing is people get used\nto new items pretty quickly,\nsooner or later you buy that\ndream car, or purse, or phone,\nit will just be another\nmeans of transportation.\nAnother item in your closet,\na dusty phone you can't\nseem to get working.\nAnd then there will be something new\nyou set your sights on.\nThen the process just repeats.\nWant buy, want buy.\nWith only a few brief moments\nof happiness in between,\nbut these moments just\nfeel lesser and lesser\nthe more you resort to just buy a new item\nto gain some happiness.\nFocus on your values instead.\nAt the end of your life,\nwill you be looking back at\nall the phones you bought\nor all the friendships you made,\nand experiences you lived?\nProbably the latter,\nunless it's your ultimate\npassion to collect phones.\nHey Psych2goers, have you ever wanted\nto reduce stress and improve sleep,\nor maybe boost your metabolism\nand find balance in your body and mind?\nIntermittent fasting\ncould be the

three, you ruminate on fictional\nnegative scenarios that\nlikely won't happen.\nDo you ruminate on imaginative scenarios\noften about the worst case possible,\nleaving you feeling anxious\nand mentally drained?\nWell, it's good to first recognize\nwhen you've drifted off\ninto a worrisome realm\nof anxious imagination\nand take a step back.\nThis may be difficult at first,\nbut the more you recognize\nwhen you're drifting off\ninto ruminating about something\nthat's not rooted in fact,\nbut instead, simply negative\nscenarios that are fiction,\nyou may have an easier time\nof letting go of that worry.\nTell yourself that this\nis just your imagination\nrunning a bit wild.\nThat you may often jump to\nthe worst scenario first,\none likely everything will be fine.\nIf you feel your negative\nscenarios are indeed more likely\nto happen in this case,\ntry redirecting the focus into a plan\non what you'll do next.\nRedirect the focus somewhere\nelse by doing another task\nthat requires a good amount of thought.\nNumber four, blaming\nyourself for something\nthat's out of your control.\nDo you often blame yourself for everything\nthat goes wrong in your life?\nIt's important that we all step back\nand recognize when we have\nno control in a situation\nand that it's not our fault.\nBlaming ourselves often\ntakes so much energy,\nit can leave us feeling miserable.\nWhen you feel blame arising,\nremind yourself of whether or\nnot you had any real fault.\nWe can't have control over everything.\nSo working towards recognizing\nwhen we're not wrong\nis a great first step\nin the right direction.\nOnce you realized you're not at fault,\nredirect your attention onto something\nyou love and appreciate.\nEngage in those activities\nthat make you smile.\nIt may just get your mind off your worries\nand onto something that makes you happy.\nNumber five, you're holding\nonto grudges or anger.\nAre you currently\nholding onto any grudges?\nDo you hold anger in your heart?\nWhen this happens,\nit's best to move towards\nletting go of this anger\nrather than holding onto it\nand hoping something changes.\nThis can be hard when\nsomeone has wronged us,\nbut you deserve respect.\nGive yourself the respect you deserve\nand try to focus your thoughts\naway from the person that wronged you.\nDetermine if there'll be one\nwho will stay in your life\nor one you'll move on from.\nThen forgive or let go of the anger\nand let the respect for your\nwellbeing fill that spot.\nAnd number six, judging\nyourself too harshly.\nDo you, you judge yourself\na little too harshly?\nIt's time to give yourself a break.\nYou're only human after all.\nA good step towards correcting\nthis harmful behavior\nis to recognize that while you may think\nsomething horrible about\nyourself, it's not true.\nIt's simply a thought.\nYou can choose whether\nor not you believe it.\nAnother great tip is to\nsometimes replace any reoccurring\nnegative judgments with\na positive thought,\neven if you don't believe it yet.\nEven if you're not the perfect self\nyou believe you should be,\nwhich no one is by the way.\nYou deserve respect and love.\nTreat yourself how you would\ntreat your most loved friend\nor family or pet.\nWould you ever say those\nharsh things to your dog\nif he was here having a hard time?\nI think not.\nYes, everyone's\ncircumstances are different\nand it may be more difficult\nfor some than others.\nBut recognizing you're\nnot in a healthy place,\ngives you a chance to seek\nout help that you may need.\nIf these feelings of misery persist,\nit's best to seek out help\nfrom therapist or counselor.\nThey may be able to help\nyou and sooner or later,\nyou may not feel as\nmiserable as you once were.\nHappiness is surely possible.\nSo don't shy away from\ntaking the first step\ntowards getting there.\nWe can do it together.\nSo which of these reasons\ncould you relate to?\nFeel free to share with us\nin the comments
