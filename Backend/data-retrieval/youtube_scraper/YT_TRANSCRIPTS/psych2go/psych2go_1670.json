    "transcript": "- Hey Psych2Goers, welcome\nback to another video.\nDo they like me, or am\nI just overthinking?\nMaybe I completely misread the signs,\nand they think of me as\nnothing more than a friend.\nWhat if confessing ruins our friendship?\nDo these questions sound familiar to you?\nIf so, you know all too well,\nhow hard it can be to figure out\nwhether someone likes you back.\nSo with that said,\nwhether it's a coworker,\na classmate, or a friend,\nthese eight obvious signs\nthat your crush likes you\nare sure to help figure things out.\nNumber one, the text back instantly.\nWhen you message them, how long\ndoes it take to get a reply?\nWhen someone likes you\nthey'll prioritize your texts,\nthey'll look forward to\nhaving conversations with you.\nSo when that notification pops up,\nthey won't be able to\nresist breaking into a smile\nand getting ready to think\nof the perfect response.\nOn the other hand, if\nthey wait a few hours\nbefore getting around\nto reading your message,\nthey might not like you.\nThey may be more concerned\nwith looking cool\nrather than genuinely talking to you.\nIf this describes your crush,\nconsider rethinking whether they're worth\nthe time and energy.\nAfter all, everyone deserves\nsomeone who prioritizes them.\nNumber two, they use\nyour social media posts\nto start conversations.\nWhen you post something on your story,\ndo they swipe up and start\ntalking to you about it?\nSomeone making excuses to talk to you\nis a huge sign they like you.\nThey're looking for every\npossible opportunity\nto start a conversation.\nSo, whether it's a story post, feed post,\nor a mutual friend's post,\nif you're there, they'll\ntext you about it.\nAn in person example would be\nasking your crush questions\nyou may already know the\nanswer to at school or work,\njust to start a conversation.\nThis exciting flirtatious\nstage in a relationship\ncan translate to online\ninteractions as well.\nYou just have to know what to look for.\nNumber three, they think of\nonline things to do together.\nDoes it feel like you can't\ndo anything but stay at home?\nThis can be extremely frustrating.\nBut there are actually many online things\nyou can do with others.\nWhen someone really likes you,\nthey'll wanna spend more time with you,\nso they may start brainstorming\nsome fun online games\nand activities to do together.\nFor example, playing \"Would\nyou rather\" online card games,\nor video games together\nare all great activities\nto stay entertained and safe.\nHave you two tried virtual activities?\nIf so, there's a good chance\nthey really treasure\nspending time with you,\nand that the feelings are mutual.\nNumber four, they want to call.\nAre all your online interactions texting,\nor do you call too?\nWhile not as intimate\nas talking face to face,\ncalling still offers real-time\ninteraction and reactions.\nTexting can grow tiring\nand tedious at times.\nSimply put, it isn't always\nenough when it comes to people\nyou really care about\nand enjoy talking to.\nSo, if your crush wants to call too,\nit's a good sign they're\ncraving more interaction\nand may like you back.\nNumber five, when video calling\nthey put effort into their appearance.\nDo you two plan to call at a certain time?\nIf so, what do they\nlook like when you call?\nWhile people may not be able\nto physically go out anymore,\nthe same principle of\nwanting to look attractive\nfor someone you like applies\nto virtual interactions too.\nWhen you have a crush on someone\nyou'll wanna look your best,\nfrom styling your hair\nto tidying up your room.\nOn the other hand, if they\nview you more as a friend\nor sibling type bond,\nthey may care less about\nlooking attractive around you.\nSo, the next time you call,\ntry to pay attention to how\nthey present themselves,\nsince it can say a lot\nabout how they see you.\nNumber six, they tell you everything.\nAre you the only one who knows about\ntheir embarrassing childhood stories?\nHow about that one awkward secret\nthat they've kept all these years?\nIf someone really likes you,\nchances are they'll trust you\nand be more vulnerable than normal.\nAnd this vulnerability\nalso deepens your bond,\nwhich is so important in\nany long-term relationship.\nAnd you two stay up all night calling\nand talking about anything?\nIf so, chances are they\nreally like you back.\nNumber seven, they pick\nup your texting phrases.\nDo you have any funny texting habits?\nIf so, comment them down below.\nWhen you talk to someone a lot,\nwhether in person or online,\nyou'll both subconsciously and consciously\npick up on each other's speech patterns,\nmirroring as a sign of\ncloseness and compatibility\nbecause it forms empathy,\nwhich deepens our bonds.\nSo if this describes you and your crush,\nthere's a good chance they like you back.\nAnd number eight, when\ntexting they use emojis.\nLook back at the last\ntext you got from them.\nHow many emojis did they use?\nWhile it may sound random,\nthere's actually a good explanation behind\nwhy emojis may indicate\nwhether someone likes you.\nWhen texting, it's much\nharder to show emotions\nsuch as excitement,\nnervousness and embarrassment\nwithout facial expressions\nand body language.\nSo, in order to better\nconvey how they're feeling,\nthey'll use fun emojis to show\nthat talking to you makes them happy.\nThey may also use them to\nindicate tone, sarcasm, or a joke.\nAnything to emulate in\nperson facial expressions.\nSo, do you think your\ncrush likes you back?\nThe bottom line is that\nno one can know for sure\nwhether the feeling is mutual.\nIt could be that both sides\nare afraid to speak up.\nSo with that in mind,\ndon't be afraid to put yourself out there,\ndon't be scared of taking chances\nand pursuing the things\nthat make you happy.\nWhat signs does your crush display?\nTell us in the comments below.\nPlease like and share this with
