    "transcript": "- Did you know the longer you stay\nwithin your comfort zone\nthe less happy you'll be?\nInstead, it's slowly killing you?\nWe as humans, we tend to\nstay within our comfort zone\nbecause we are scared of fear,\nfeeling anxious and feeling stress.\nBut little do you know that in life,\nit's either growing or you're dying.\nAnd the key is to keep moving forward.\nIf there's no growth,\nthen there's no progress.\nAnd if there's no progress,\nyou'll never be able to\nsee you are on the outside.\nSo do your best to be\noutside of the comfort zone.\nTake baby steps to\nbuild up your confidence\nand make your goals and dreams come true\nand don't let anything hold you back."
