you see,\ndo consider subscribing.\nIt would help a lot\nwith YouTube's algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content.\nThanks for being here.\nHey Psych2Goers, welcome\nback to our channel.\nSo, you're at a party\nwhen you notice a very\nattractive individual\nis looking your way.\nYou're not the best at\nconversation starters\nand pickup lines.\nDeep down you just wish\nthe person you admire\nwould make their way over to you.\nHow can you grab their attention\nand attract them to do so?\nWell, there are a few ways.\nHere's how to attract someone\nwithout saying anything.\nNumber one, show you're open to talking\nby using open body language.\nPeople approach others more easily\nif they simply look, well, approachable.\nShow you're open to dating them\nwith a bit of open body language.\n\"Dr. Monica Moore, a psychologist\nat Webster University in St. Louis,\nhas conducted research on\nthe flirting techniques\nused in singles bars, shopping malls,\nand places young people\ngo to meet each other,\"\nauthor, Nicholas Boothman,\nwrites in his book,\n\"How to Make Someone Fall in Love With You\nin 90 Minutes or Less.\"\nThe author notes that\npsychologist Dr. Monica Moore\nfound that it's not\nalways the good-looking\nwho get approached the most,\nbut the ones who signal their\navailability and confidence\nthrough basic flirting techniques,\nlike eye contact and smiles.\nJust signaling your interest in someone\ngets you halfway there.\nKeep your chest and torso open\nand try not to cross your arms as much.\nClosed body language can\ngive off the impression\nyou aren't available or\nsimply don't want to talk.\nSo maintain confidence\nand open body language\nand, when you notice\nsomeone looking at you,\ndon't shy away, simply\nrespond with a smile.\nNumber two, maintain good\ngrooming and dress to impress.\nDressing nice and being well-groomed\nis an easy way to get\nsomeone to notice you.\nIt can be admirable to see\nsomeone very well put together.\nAnd having great hygiene\nis an attractive quality in and of itself.\nExpress who you are\nby wearing what makes you\nfeel confident and happy.\nIf you feel like you,\nyou'll probably feel more comfortable\nand approachable to others.\nNumber three, look into their eyes\nand maintain good eye contact.\nSo, your crush just looked your way\nand now you've met their gaze.\nMaintain good eye contact\nand don't be afraid to smile back.\nHarvard psychologist, Zick\nRubin conducted a study\nwhere he recorded how much time\nlovers would spend looking\ninto each other's eyes.\nHe found that individuals\nwho are not in love\nlooked at each other\n30 to 60% of the time,\nwhile couples deeply in love\nstared into each other's eyes\n75% of the time when talking.\nWhen someone else entered the room\nor interrupted them,\nthey were much slower to turn away\nfrom their partner's gaze.\nSo, it's best to meet their gaze\nas opposed to turning away quickly.\nIf you're both in a group discussion,\nmeeting their eyes every now and then,\nmay key them into the idea\nthat you find them attractive.\nWhen you do approach them,\ntry to look into their eyes\n75% of the time when you're talking.\nThe brain remembers the last time\nsomeone they loved stared\nat them in the same way.\nThey will associate this\nstare with feelings of love.\nWhy?\nWell, this lovely memory\ncauses a release of phenylethylamine,\nwhich is known as a love drug.\nPhenylethylamine is released in the brain\nwhen someone falls in love.\nThe chemical too, mimics\nthe brain chemistry\nof someone who is deeply in love.\nNumber four, smile.\nDo you like smiling?\nLet those pearly whites show.\nA study published\nin the \"Bulletin of the\nPsychonomic Society\"\nfound smiling might just\nmake you more attractive.\nAccording to the study,\nwomen in the experiment\nwho smiled 70% of the time\nwere seen as more\ninterpersonally attractive\nthan a woman who seldom smiled.\nSo, remember to give a gentle smile\nwhen you do meet their eyes.\nNumber five, join a club they're in\nand try activities they enjoy.\nSo, how else can you attract someone?\nLet's say you have a crush on a classmate\nand you notice they're\npart of the school band,\npick up some sheet music\nand get practicing on that tuba.\nMaybe they could teach you a few measures\nof their favorite piece.\nThe thing is, our brains are motivated\nto spend more time around those we like\nso we might as well do so by\nengaging in a hobby with them.\nAccording to dating psychologist,\nMadeleine Mason Roantree,\nthe reward system in our brains\ncan increase our motivation\nto spend more time with whoever we like.\nIf we enjoy being around them,\nwhy wouldn't we want to\nhang out with them more?\nShe explains that you may\njust start to crave their presence.\nIt's not uncommon for\npeople to take up hobbies\nor enroll in activities\nthat their crush is part of\nto be closer to them,\neven if they weren't\ninitially into the hobby\nor activity itself before.\nRoantree explains, it also\ngives you something else\nthat you can talk to them about.\nAnd perhaps it's a way to entice\nthem to get closer to you.\nSo, once you discuss with\nthem their hobbies and clubs,\ninvite them to try your\nactivities that you love as well.\nAnd number six, hang out\nwith a group of friends.\nResearch shows that\npeople tend to find others\nmore attractive when they're in groups\nrather than on their own.\nThis idea is called the cheerleader effect\nand has been proven through tests\nby a psychologist to be consistent.\nResearchers Edward Vul and Drew Walker\nof the University of\nCalifornia, San Diego,\nconducted five experiments\nwhere subjects would rate people\nbased on photographs of them.\nThey found that subjects\nrated people more attractive\nwhen they were pictured in\na group of the same gender\ncompared to an individual photograph\nof someone pictured alone.\nAs the study suggests,\nindividual faces will seem more attractive\nwhen presented in a group.\nBecause they'll appear more similar\nto the average group face,\nwhich is more attractive\nthan group members' individual faces.\nSo, if you see a charming\nindividual at that party,\nit might be worth it to get\nthem to notice you first\nwhile you're chatting\nwith a group of friends.\nJust make sure you're alone\nor approachable at one point,\nso they have a better\nchance to approach you.\nAnd once they lock onto\nyour eyes, don't shy away.\nUncross your arms, give them a smile,\nand remember to wear deodorant\nwhen you do go out on that date.\nBecause you will ask them\nout on a date, right?\nYou have to talk to them at some point.\nWe believe in you, you got this.\nSo, how will you attract someone\nbefore ever saying a word to them?\nA smile?\nA group of friends by your side?\nA shower?\nLet us know in the comments down below.\nIf you enjoyed this video\ndon't forget to
