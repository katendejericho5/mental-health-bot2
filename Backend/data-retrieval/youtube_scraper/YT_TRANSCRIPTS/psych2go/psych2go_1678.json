    "transcript": "- [Instructors] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nthank you so much for your support.\nWhat are some habits that you have?\nHabits are routines of behavior\nthat are regularly repeated\nand which often happen unconsciously.\nSo while you may be able to\nname a few of your habits\nsuch as stretching in the morning,\nor getting the mail before you get home,\nthere may also be some habits\nthat you do that you're not aware of.\nPerhaps you bite your nails a lot,\nor turn to harmful activities\nwhen you're stressed.\nThese are habits that can do\nmore harm to you than good.\nSo to help you become more\naware of some of your tendencies\nthat may negatively affect\nyour overall wellbeing,\nhere are six habits that may be harmful\nto your mental health.\nNumber one, you worry\nover what others think.\nHow much do you care about\nwhat other people think?\nTaking feedback from others\nand knowing how to use this\nfeedback to improve yourself\nis both a good quality and a healthy one\nfor your professional and personal life.\nHowever, it can become a problem\nif you end up only\ntrying to please everyone\nto get their approval.\nYou may end up sacrificing\nthings that you want to\njust because someone else is opposed to it\nor wants something different.\nTherefore, it's important\nthat you know how to differentiate\ngood and bad feedback\nin order to improve yourself\ncontinuously and efficiently.\nIt's also crucial that you know\nwhen to prioritize your\nown needs and wellbeing\nover what people might think.\nNumber two, skipping breakfast.\nDo you skip breakfast a lot?\nThis habit can have a very negative effect\non your overall health\nsince it can affect\nyour blood sugar levels\nand slow down your metabolism.\nSkipping what is considered\nto be the most important meal of the day\ncan also affect your mood\nand cognitive functions\nand make you feel like you\ndon't have enough energy\nto fully start the day.\nSo even if you're tempted\nto get 10 more minutes\nof sleep in the morning,\nyou may wanna consider taking that time\nto have a good breakfast instead,\nbecause once you get some\nnutrients in your body,\nyou may find yourself\nfeeling much more refreshed\nand energized throughout the day.\nNumber three, you spend all\nday in doors and in the dark.\nDo you spend most of your\ndays in doors and in the dark?\nWhile it has become\nnecessary to stay in doors\nbecause of the pandemic,\nit's also important that you\ncatch them sunlight every day.\nWhether it's opening up a small window\nor pulling the curtains up,\ngetting some sunlight\ncan help boost your mood\nand improve your overall wellbeing.\nAccording to Kenneth Wright,\nthe Director of the Sleep\nand Chronobiology Laboratory\nat the University of Colorado,\na lack of exposure to direct sunlight\ncan affect your sleeping\nschedule, your mood\nand your appetite and energy three levels\nsince some that is known to help regulate\nthese aspects of your everyday life.\nSo while may be difficult\ndepending on your circumstance,\nyou may want to remember\nto open up your windows during the day,\nor if it's safe to do so,\ngo for a short stroll or run outside.\nNumber four, not exercising.\nHow often do you exercise during the week?\nPerhaps you're just too busy at work\nor have been spending\nmore of your time online.\nWhatever the reason, it can be easy\nto push exercising further and further\ndown your list of priorities.\nBut exercise has a number of benefits\nto your overall mental health.\nIt's one of the natural remedies\nto fight off inflammation,\nwhich is the main cause of\na number of heart diseases.\nIt's also known to boost your mood\nbecause it promotes the release\nof endorphins in your body.\nSo while you may have the\nhabit of pushing it off,\nyou may wanna consider\nchanging up your daily routine\nand adding just a little exercise to it.\nEven just going for a 30\nto 45 minute walk every day\ncan make a huge difference\nand bring you great benefits.\nNumber five, overusing painkillers.\nAre you someone who\nfrequently uses painkillers?\nBecause it's relatively easy\nto purchase over the counter painkillers,\nmany people may start\nto depend a lot on these\nto deal with their everyday\npains and illnesses.\nHowever, while they may offer some relief,\nit's also important to\nknow that medication\nsuch as ibuprofen and aspirin\ncan increase your risk\nof developing ulcers,\ngastrointestinal bleeding,\nhigh blood pressure and heart attacks.\nTherefore, overusing these painkillers\nmight actually end up hurting\nyou rather than helping you.\nSo if you can, you may\nwanna stick to medicine\nthat has been prescribed by professional\nor inquire about different therapies\nthat might help you deal with the pain\nthat you may be experiencing.\nAnd number six, getting too many sunburns.\nDo you often go tanning?\nWhile your skin may look\ngreat, healthy and vibrant,\ntoo much tanning can also lead\nto an overexposure to sunlight.\nConstantly getting sunburns\nand overexposing your skin\ncan make it lose its elasticity\nand cause it to age faster.\nBut
