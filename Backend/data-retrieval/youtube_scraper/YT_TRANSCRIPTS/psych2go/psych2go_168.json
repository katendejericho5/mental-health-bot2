    "transcript": "here on psych too we celebrate the\nadvancements made in Psychology\nPsychotherapy and Neuroscience so when\nstudies come out that answer an age-old\nquestion it's extremely exciting but\nthere's one question that we've been\nasking ourselves since the dawn of\nConsciousness how can we be happy many\npsychologists philosophers and\nneuroscientists have offered their\nthoughts for us to examine let's take a\nlook at a few rituals that will make you\nhappy happiness is for each individual\nand can't be reduced down to a basic\nformula that applies to everyone this is\njust a sample of rituals you can try\nthat will make you happier according to\nNeuroscience label negative\nfeelings sometimes our sadness or anger\nis subconscious we aren't focused on it\nbut it's there feelings are also\ncomplicated maybe you aren't angry\nyou're frustrated maybe you aren't sad\nyou're\nmelancholic there are labels we can\napply to our negative emotions that will\nhelp us put them into perspective and\nregulate them a 2007 study by Matthew\nliberman and colleagues called putting\nfeelings into words found that putting\nlabels on our feelings diminishes\nemotional reactivity in the parts of the\nbrain that are sensitive to or in charge\nof producing emotions if you think about\nyour room you know what everything is\nand where you might find each little\nthing even when your room is a mess you\ndon't stress about your things unless\nsomething is missing or not supposed to\nbe there your brain is the same without\nlabels you don't know where everything\nis in the mess but with labels you don't\nhave to worry you can look around and\nsay there's happiness there's anger oh\nyes and there's my sadness it becomes\nmanageable when something in your room\ngoes missing it becomes your focus\nnothing else matters it all just Blends\ninto the background when we don't have a\nlabel for an emotion or feeling it\nbecomes our focus and we feel it a lot\nmore than we should our emotions and\nfeelings also blend into the background\nsometimes we don't have the words for\nour feelings or the words we do have\nseem crude and vague luckily there are\nprofessionals like licensed therapists\nwho can help us out and help you define\nthese feelings as well as get diagnosed\nwhich for chronic mental illnesses is\nlike the ultimate label make that\ndecision if you're stressing about a\ndecision whether it is crucial or tiny\nthe solution is simple make it that\ndoesn't necessar barely mean you have to\ncome to a certain conclusion because\nsome decisions require time and patience\nto make decision- making can include\ndeciding what your intentions are what\nyou need out of certain situations and\nsetting goals according to a study\ntitled anxiety and decision making\nanxiety gets in the way of our decision-\nmaking by trapping Us in fear fear of\nthe outcome of your decision either way\nmaybe you felt like a deer in the\nheadlights unable to move a term used\nfor for this is analysis paralysis and\nis common in people with anxiety it's\nokay to make a decision that isn't\nperfect make the decision that is okay\nfor now just so you can have some sort\nof conclusion and end your stress\noveranalyzing does more harm than good\nif you find this video relatable and\nhelpful please give the video a thumbs\nup and subscribe to the channel now\nmoving on to the next Point seek\nphysical touch human beings need\nphysical touch more specifically we need\nphysical affection a 2005 study on\naffection by communication expert Corey\nFloyd and others found that expressing\naffection can lead to increased\nhappiness and self-esteem decreased fear\nof intimacy and susceptibility to\ndepression and higher relationship\nsatisfaction but don't think that you\nneed a romantic partner to experience\nphysical affection you can hug your\nfriends your mom or dad or your siblings\nthe benefits might surprise you and who\nwouldn't appreciate a hug the nice thing\nabout hugs is that they're reciprocal\ndon't have anyone to hug treat yourself\nto a massage instead ask yourself what\nyou are grateful for you may have been\ntold to be grateful in the past it's\neasier said than done when you're in a\nnegative mindset but the truth is\nthere's a lot to be grateful for\nNeuroscience backs this up according to\nneuroscientist Dr Alex Corb who explains\nthat when we Express gratitude there's\nan increase in our dopamine and\nserotonin our emotions can take on a\nSnowball Effect if you're looking for\nthe things that suck you'll find more\nand more but if you're looking for good\nthings things you appreciate and\npossibly couldn't do without you start\nto see more examples around you so let's\nget that snowball rolling in the right\ndirection and find some things to be\ngrateful for maybe you're grateful to\nhave access to the device you're\nwatching this on that alone opens up a\nlot of opportunities for you move your\nbody not everyone is into hitting the\nweights in the gym but that doesn't mean\nyou can't still find a way to be active\na 2015 study by neuroscientist Lucas\nkopka on the effects of exercise from a\nneuroscience perspective found that\nbecause the data indicates that exercise\nMay provide significant effects we\nshould begin to incorporate exercise\ninto our therapeutic designs for mood\nand cognitive disorders in other words\nexercise can elevate your mood it\ndoesn't take a lot the study suggests\njust moving your body through dancing\nlifting weights running or stret sing\nfor at least 20 minutes can greatly\naffect your mood try to set some time\naside specifically for this you can try\nit while watching TV or YouTube or you\ncan incorporate it with the next Point\nspend time Outdoors this might seem like\nan old school way of thinking you might\nhave heard your parents or grandparents\ntry to explain that the cause of your\ndepression is your phone or computer\nwhile there are studies that explain\nthat social media use has negative\neffects on the brain that information\nmight not always be hard helpful the\nidea of seeing the Sun or touching grass\nbeing the cure for depression isn't\ntotally true however there definitely\nare benefits that can help your mood a\nstudy by Roger rrick an expert in\npatient care environments on the\nbenefits of ecotherapy a type of therapy\nthat involves nature and being outdoors\nstates that connecting with nature has\nan ameliorating effect this basically\nmeans that taking the time to breathe in\nfresh air feel the sun on your skin and\nfeel grass or soil on your hands or feet\nhelps you clear your mind this helps\nwith cognition and of course lifts your\nmood other studies such as the 2020\nstudy by psychologist and neuroscientist\nAaron haa reveals that a general change\nin scenery helps you revisit stressful\nsituations with renewed creativity and\ninspiration as a ritual before or after\nschool or work try to spend a little\ntime in nature as we said in the\nbeginning everyone is different what\nmakes you happy might not make others\nhappy maybe there isn't a lot of nature\nwhere you live maybe you have a mental\nhealth condition that prevents you from\nseeing things to be grateful for the\nmain idea is that you try you might not\nbe able to do every single one of these\nbut we encourage you to give it a week\nand test them out go into each one with\nan open mind and heart and know that\nhappiness is definitely attainable\nbefore you go please like the video and\nsubscribe to psych to go if you enjoyed\nthis or found it helpful and don't\nforget yet you can come back to this\nvideo anytime for a refresher on these\nrituals good luck and remember you"
