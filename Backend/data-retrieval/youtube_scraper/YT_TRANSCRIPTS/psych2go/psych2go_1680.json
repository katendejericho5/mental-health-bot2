    "transcript": "4 and 23.\nPick a number that most\nresonates with you.\n(gentle music plays)\nJealousy will be a part\nof every relationship.\nYou cannot run from it\nbecause it will always exist,\nbut do talk about it\nbecause your feelings are valid\nand shouldn't be dismissed.\nI love this closeness between us.\nI pine for every one of her kisses.\nI spend my days driving the coastline\nwith my love beside me.\nAn infinite dark sky with stars\nbecause she reminds me of the moon.\nMoments spent with her can\nnever come soon enough.\nTo watch her love grow\nbetween white sheets and wine,\nfrom strangers to she is mine.\nTo be young and wild,\nthen to blossom together into old age.\nIf I could write all my love for her\nbetween these lines,\nit would fill every page."
