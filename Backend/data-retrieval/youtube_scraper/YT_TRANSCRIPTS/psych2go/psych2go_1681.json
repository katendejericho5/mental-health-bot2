    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nHave you ever been\nquestioning your introversion\nor have you been bordering\nbetween introversion\nand extroversion, unsure where you stand?\nIntroverts make up around 25% to 40%\nof the world's population\nwith a decent chunk of the\nworld being introverted,\nthere's a high chance\nyou might be one as well.\nSo, here are seven signs,\nyou're actually an introvert.\nNumber one, you prefer\none-on-one conversation.\nDo you like having a deep conversation\nwith one close friend over interacting\nwith a group of people?\nFor introverts it's always\nquality over quantity.\nThey'd much rather spend their time\nin the company of one\nor two close friends,\ninstead of spreading themselves\ntoo thin with strangers.\nIdle chatter in a large group\ndoes not interest introverts.\nIt might even feel\ndishonest to some of them,\nbut a deep conversation with\ntheir best friend at 2:00 AM,\nmight be more suited to\nan introvert's taste.\nNumber two, you like\nweekends with no plans.\nWould you rather have a restful weekend,\nover a high energy one?\nWeekends are great time for\nintroverts to unplug and unwind,\nespecially those with energy draining jobs\nor days at school that\nrequire constant interaction,\nwhile it's healthy to\ncatch up with your friends,\nevery once in a while.\nYou're not at all weird\nfor silently celebrating\na canceled plan or relishing\nin a schedule free day,\nwatching Netflix or meditating\nin your PJ's sounds like a\ngreat plan for any introvert.\nNumber three,\nyou prefer working alone\noverworking with others.\nDo you dislike group work\nor prefer working independently instead?\nIntroverts are drawn to jobs\nthat involve independence,\ninstead of worrying about\ndealing with other people,\nthey'd much prefer to focus\ntheir minds on their duties.\nWriting, accounting,\ncomputer programming or\ngraphic design are great jobs\nfor introverts, since they\ndon't require a whole lot\nof smalltalk.\nOn the other hand,\nworking as a host or a retail\nstaff may not mix well with\nthe nature of most introverts.\nNumber four, you go to parties,\nbut not to meet people.\nAt parties are you\nsomeone who'd rather stick\nby a close friend instead\nof meeting new people?\nEven if you're an introvert,\nyou do enjoy some degree\nof socialization every now and then.\nMany introverts don't\nmind going to parties\nas long as a close friend\nis around to accompany them.\nIntroverts and extroverts,\nsee parties in a fundamentally\ndifferent way however.\nAn introvert will\nconsider going to a party\nto spend quality time with a friend,\nwhile an extrovert would\nconsider a party a good time\nto talk to new and interesting people.\nNumber five, your hobbies are solitary.\nDo you enjoy drawing,\nrunning, video games,\nreading and other things\nthat don't require much\nsocial interaction,\njust like working,\nan introvert enjoys low\ndistraction activities,\na few hours absorbed in a book,\na meditative stroll around the park\nor watching a great TV show,\nare some of the things\nthat introverts love to do.\nIf a good couple of hours all to yourself,\nsounds like a good time,\nrather than an absolute bore.\nYou may be an introvert.\nNumber six,\nyou spend a lot of time\nwhen making a decision,\nwould you consider yourself\nan indecisive person?\nAn introvert,\nmay constantly have back\nand forth conversations\nwith their internal monologue.\nIntroverts tend to take a long time\nto process information\nbefore diving into something,\nwhether it's picking a college course\nor ordering food off a menu,\nwhile this trait allows them\nto see all angles and problems,\nit could also lead them\nto fail to make a decision\nand have it snatched away.\nAnd number seven,\nyou can get extremely\npassionate about something.\nDo you sometimes get\nworked up about a topic\nthat you're passionate about?\nIntroverts may appear\nreserved and shy at first,\nbut once they get going,\nthey can talk your ears off.\nIntroverts tend to drown themselves\nin their hobbies and interests.\nAnd since most of these\ninterests are solitary in nature,\nan introvert may not have\na platform to express\ntheir passion about it if no\none else shows their interest,\nbut if you give them a chance,\ntheir enthusiasm can surprise\nany unsuspecting person.\nSo, do you relate to any\nof these signs we've mentioned above.\nIf you do consider yourself an introvert\nor someone with the\ntendencies of introverts.\nDid you find this video fun or insightful?\nTell us in the comments below,\nplease like and share it with friends\nthat might find value in\nthis video to make sure too.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the references used are added\nin the description box below.\nThanks for watching and\nwe'll see you next time."
