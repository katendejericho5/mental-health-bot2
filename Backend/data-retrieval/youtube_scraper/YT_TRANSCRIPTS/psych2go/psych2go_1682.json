    "transcript": "- [Lily] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nand welcome to another video.\nThank you all so much\nfor the love and support\nthat you've given us,\nenabling us to make\nyet another exploration\ninto everyday psychology.\nSo let's begin.\nLoving yourself may sound simple,\nbut we all know how hard it is.\nSometimes it can be a roller coaster ride\nbetween being happy with yourself\nand wishing you could change.\nThere are so many things that\naffect your image of yourself\nand some of them may not be good.\nThings such as the media set\nfalse expectations and ideals.\nIt can be a long journey\nto accepting this,\nbut it's worth it.\nWe made this video to remind you\nthat you should never\ngive up on loving yourself\nbecause you deserve it,\nand you're worth it.\nSo here are 12 things that do\nnot determine your self-worth.\nNumber one, your achievements.\nCan you relate to loving yourself so much\nwhen something goes well,\nbut the second something goes wrong,\nyour self-worth immediately\ntakes the plunge?\nWhether it's your grades,\nyour job, or a sport,\nit's easy to base yourself\nworth on what you accomplish,\nbut how much you're worth\ndoes not depend on your achievements,\nespecially when it comes to competitions,\nyou can't control your competitors\nso you don't need to blame yourself\nwhen things don't go your way.\nYou are more than just a bullet point list\nof all of your accomplishments.\nYou're a complex person\nwith a personality, hobbies,\nand so much more than your achievements.\nAnd it all makes you worth it.\nNumber two, your income and job.\nAre you second guessing your career?\nDo you often think of switching your job?\nWhile your job plays a big\npart in your lifestyle,\nit does not determine your worth.\nPeople who have less money\naren't lesser than others\nlike society and the\nmedia sometimes portrays.\nYour job and income\nare sometimes the result\nof your situation.\nThere are so many factors\nthat influence them,\nlike location, the\neconomy, and competition.\nSo they aren't really a\nreflection of who you are.\nNumber three, your childhood.\nDo you avoid thinking\nabout your childhood?\nDo the memories make you uncomfortable?\nYour childhood may shape\na lot of things about you,\nbut it does not determine your worth.\nIt's a phase well on its way out\nand you mustn't let it overwhelm you.\nYour rough childhood does\nnot define who you are.\nAfter all, you have no control\nover who your parents are\nand you're not responsible\nfor their choices.\nIt may take some time to accept this,\nbut your past does not define you.\nNumber four, your level of education.\nMuch like your income,\nyour level of education is also the result\nof so many factors.\nOne of the biggest factors\nwhen it comes to deciding\nwhether to go to college and where\nis how much money your family has.\nYou can't change how much\nmoney your family has\nor the location of the\nschools you wanna go to.\nTherefore, you don't need to feel bad\nif you don't have a\nhigher level of education,\nit doesn't mean you're less intelligent\nor worth less than those who do.\nNumber five, how other\npeople view and treat you.\nDo you constantly stress\nabout how others see you?\nAre you constantly trying to\nlive up to their standards?\nOther people have no way of\nknowing who you truly are.\nWhile family and friends\nmay have a good idea of it,\nonly you fully know yourself.\nKnowing this, your self worth isn't based\nupon others limited and\nsometimes biased opinions of you.\nYou cannot control what\nother people think,\nnor how they act.\nSimilarly, don't base your value\nupon something completely up to others.\nTrying to please others\nwill ultimately lead you\nto being miserable\nso try not to stress yourself out\nwith other people's opinions,\neven if it is difficult.\nNumber six, other people's achievements.\nDo you compare your\nachievements to other people's?\nIt's okay, because everyone\ndoes that occasionally.\nAnd it's so easy to\nlook at what you've done\nand compare it to someone\nelse's achievements,\nespecially when the\ninternet gives you access\nto everyone's amazing lives.\nIt may be hard to internalize,\nbut what other people\ndo, doesn't define you.\nYou can't control others\nso the only thing you\ncan do is try your best.\nRegardless of the result,\ntrying your best is enough.\nAfter all, everyone is different\nwith varying skill sets and experiences\nso it's no use comparing two\ncompletely unique people.\nNumber seven, your appearance.\nAre you unhappy with some\nphysical feature of yours?\nIs there anything you\nwish you could change\nabout your appearance?\nChances are the answer is yes.\nAlmost everyone wants\nwhat someone else has,\nwhich is the sad truth\nespecially living in today's society,\nit can be so easy to compare\nyourself to other people\nand all the gorgeous models on TV.\nBut try to remember\nthat what you look like\ndoesn't determine how much you're worth.\nYou've probably heard it before,\nand we know how hard it is\nto accept and internalize,\nbut it's true.\nYou don't need to feel bad\nbecause you might not look\nthe way that people on the TV do\nbecause everyone is beautiful\nin their own unique way.\nNumber eight, your relationship status.\nAre you still looking for the one?\nBut it seems like everyone\nyou know is getting hitched?\nNowadays, there's so much pressure\nto have a significant other\nand a picture perfect relationship.\nIt can feel as if you constantly\nneed to be pursuing someone\nout of fear of being a\ndesperate, lonely, single.\nHowever, there's nothing\nwrong with being single,\nit doesn't make you less of a person\nbecause it means you're taking more time\nto focus on yourself\nand what you wanna do.\nYou will only go for\nit when it feels right.\nWhile a relationship may be nice,\nit's not something you\nneed to have to be valued.\nNine, the number of friends you have.\nDo you value quantity over\nquality when it comes to friends?\nOr is it difficult for you to keep up\nwith your circle of friends?\nHaving more friends\ndoesn't matter what\nkind of person you are.\nIf you only have a few\nit doesn't mean you're\nnot sociable or kind,\nbut it means you have a\nspecific taste in people,\nwhich isn't a bad thing.\nYou're invested in finding friends\nwho understand and care you.\nOn the other hand,\nhaving more friends\ndoesn't mean you're shallow\nand only interested in popularity,\nit means that you're friendly\nand open to new people.\nThe number of friends you have\ndoesn't say anything about yourself worth,\nrather, it's the quality of your friends\nthat really matters.\n10, your social media status.\nAre you an avid scroller?\nDo you post on social media\nhabitually or occasionally?\nWith the amount of\nemphasis on social media,\nthe world seems to revolve\naround how many likes you get.\nThere is so much pressure to have\na picture perfect\naesthetically pleasing life.\nHowever, your worth is not measured\nby how many people like your posts.\nSocial media is for\nsharing parts of your life\nand forming connections with people.\nIt's allowed, getting likes\nmay give you satisfaction,\nit doesn't determine your self-worth.\nSocial media should be fun and uplifting,\nnot a tool to gain validation.\nYou are valid and worthy\nregardless of your social media status.\nNumber 11, your age.\nBoth old and young people are\noften judged due to their age.\nPeople may think all young\npeople are reckless and selfish,\nwhile all older people have\ntheir whole lives figured out.\nBut your age doesn't\ncontrol your personality,\nhobbies, likes, dislikes and so much more.\nIt's not a reflection of who you are\nso it doesn't determine your worth.\nAfter all,\n♪ Age aint nothing but a number ♪\nNumber 12, your decision to have children.\nThere's a lot of societal\npressure to have children\nin order to contribute to society.\nBut having children is\ncompletely your own decision.\nNot having children doesn't\nmake you less worthy\nthan others who do\nbecause it's a major decision\nthat affects you most of all,\nso it should be up to you.\nRemember your decision is\nvalid and valued either way.\nIn the end, you're the only one\nwho determines your self-worth.\nCliche, but it's true.\nNot anyone or anything else,\nwhether it be money, family, or friends.\nIt may be hard, but just try to remember\nthat you are more than any single aspect.\nWe hope we were able to give you insight\ninto some of the things\nthat you shouldn't base your worth on.\nDo you use any of these things\nto measure your self-worth?\nIf so, that's okay, we've\nall been there before\nand we're here for you.\nLeave a comment down below\nand sharing your experiences\nand thoughts you have as well.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nbe sure
