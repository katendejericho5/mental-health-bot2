    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nWe wanted to say quick thank you\nfor all the love that you've given us,\nbecause your ongoing support\nhelps us make psychology and mental health\nmore accessible to everyone.\nSo, thanks again.\nNow, let's continue.\nDo you feel confident in yourself?\nDo you know what you're good\nat and what you're bad at?\nEven psychology experts know the benefits\nthat come with being confident\nin yourself and your skills.\nThe identity that your\nmind creates about yourself\ncan be described in\npsychology as your ego,\nwhich is the translation\nfor, I or me in Latin.\n(indistinct) having confidence in yourself\nand your skillset is great.\nBut being overconfident\ncauses a swollen ego,\nor having what's called a big head.\nA large ego can get in the way\nof your personal and\nbusiness relationships.\nAre you worried you\nmight have a large ego?\nHere are six signs that your\nego is controlling your life.\nNumber one, you always have to be right.\nThe ego is the identity\nthat your mind creates\nabout yourself and it\nhelps you to make decisions\nbased on what you think is right or wrong.\nHowever, unhealthy egos\nonly focus on self-interest and desire.\nThis means, you must be\nright about everything\nand tend to get enraged,\nwhenever someone says otherwise.\nThis can be easily seen in\nconversations or discussions,\nand even when you're in the wrong,\nyou prefer to cut the discussion off,\nso as to not admit that\nyou are in the wrong.\nIf you're dealing with\nthis kind of problem\nof ego in your life, then\npeople might find it difficult\nto maintain a relationship with you.\nNumber two, you always want more.\nDo you struggle to feel\nsatisfied with what you have?\nDo you keep wanting more and more things?\nIt's normal want to achieve success\nand have financial security\nand to yarn for the things\nthat you really want.\nBut, a way to separate this\nfrom always wanting more,\nis to ask yourself this question.\nDo you ever think that\ntoo much is never enough?\nSay your neighbor just got a sports car,\nand then now you feel compelled\nto purchase a better\nsports car than theirs,\nto show that you're better than them.\nAlways wanting more,\nwill control your life\nin an unsustainable way,\nbecause you struggle to accept\nwhat's going on in the here and now.\nNumber three, you only focus on yourself.\nIf you have a large ego,\nyou'll focus more on your needs and wants,\neven when it inconveniences others.\nThis is because you\nnaturally find yourself\nmore interesting and\nimportant than other people.\nYou might also resort\nto manipulative behavior\nin order to get what you want.\nA common example of this\nis when you're deciding\non where to have lunch with your friends.\nYour friends agree to eat at McDonald's,\nbut you would rather have\nlunch at Burger King.\nTo get your friends on your side,\nyou start saying terrible\nthings about McDonald's\nto try and manipulate them\ninto going to Burger King,\neven though everyone else was\nagainst your choice for lunch.\nEventually, you might find\nthat your friends and family\nstart to steer clear of you,\nbecause things always end in an argument\nthat they'd rather avoid.\nNumber four, you don't like\nit when other people succeed.\nAre you constantly comparing\nyourself to others?\nDo you feel incredibly self-important?\nWhen you have a bloated ego,\nyou feel like you deserve more success\nthan the others around you,\nbecause you think your hard\nwork trumps everybody else's.\nYou might be left feeling frustrated\nwhen others get promoted at\nwork or get awards at school.\nYou feel that you deserved that promotion,\nor should have received\nthose awards instead,\nbecause you are prone to jealousy\nover other people's success.\nThis can harm your friendships\nand leave you feeling isolated.\nNumber five, you set unrealistic goals.\nDo set unrealistic goals for yourself,\njust to show others that\nyou are superior to them?\nSetting unrealistic goals for yourself\nis common behavior with an inflated ego,\ndue to the pride and\nextremely high expectations\nthat you have for yourself.\nThis puts additional pressure\nand stress on your shoulders,\nand might cause you to push others away.\nFor example, imagine you've set a goal\nof getting full marks on every\nsingle course in university,\nto prove that you are smarter\nthan everyone else in your classes.\nSay, you are studying alone\nand then your dormmates\nare being loud next door,\ntalking and playing music.\nYou angrily march over there\nand yell at them for being disruptive,\nbefore going back to your studies.\nHolding onto the belief that\nyou're better than others,\nwill take a huge mental\nand physical toll on you.\nYou are constantly afraid of\nsomeone being better than you\nand live in fear of the day\nthat others will see you fail\nto achieve your unrealistic goals.\nNumber six, you lack empathy.\nAccording to \"Power of Positivity\",\nif you suffer from an overly large ego,\nyou can also be described as a narcissist.\nYou might lack the ability to\nunderstand other's feelings\nand where they're coming from,\nand are solely focused on\nyour own self-interest.\nExamples of this type\nof narcissistic behavior\nare evident when you say\nthings like, \"They deserve it\nbecause they didn't do\nanything to stop it,\"\nwhenever something bad\nhappens to someone else.\nOf course, not every person\nwith a big head is a narcissist.\nIf you wanna learn more about narcissists,\ncheck out the link in the description.\nDid you recognize any of these signs\nof having a large ego in yourself?\nHaving a large ego is different\nthan simply being confident\nin your abilities.\nIt's important to know the difference\nbetween being egotistical\nand being confident,\nas well as the difference between\nalways focusing on\nself-interest and self-care.\nPlease like and share this\nvideo if it helped you,\nand you think it could\nhelp someone else too.\nThe studies and references used\nare listed in the description below.\nDon't forget to
