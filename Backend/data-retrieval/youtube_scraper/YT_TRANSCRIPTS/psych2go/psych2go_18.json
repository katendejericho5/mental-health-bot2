    "transcript": "- Attachments are the\nemotional connections we\nform with others.\nStarting from our early\ninteractions with our caregivers,\nyou've probably stumbled\nupon discussions online about\navoidant attachment styles,\nespecially the dismissive avoidant type.\nBut here's the thing.\nThere's not enough talk about\nthe fearful avoidant style,\nand sometimes, people confuse the two.\nThat mix-up can be harmful\nbecause it leads to\nmisconceptions, demonization,\nmisunderstandings of people struggling\nwith these attachment\nstyles due to past traumas.\nthat's why it's important to differentiate\nbetween dismissive\nand fearful avoidance\nstyles understanding these\ndistinctions can shed light\non why people behave the way\nthey do and guide them to seek\nthe right support when needed\nbefore we continue please remember\nthat attachment styles change over time\nand with guidance you can\ndevelop a more secure attachment\nstyle both fearful avoidant\nand avoidant dismissive\nattachment style stem from a\ndistrust of others people with either\nof these attachment styles\nare wary of getting close\nto other people and as a\nresult don't open up easily\nbut the differences in these styles lie in\nhow they were formed someone\nwith an avoidant dismissive\nattachment style refuses\nto get close to others\nbecause they don't trust\nothers they have experienced\nrejection in their early childhood years\nas a result they have\ncome to believe that those\naround them will disappoint them\nor reject them once\nagain parenting behaviors\nthat could develop an avoidant\ndismissive attachment style\ninclude inconsistent parenting\nor overly perfectionist parents a fearful\nor disorganized attachment\nstems from a vastly different\nplace it comes from\nabusive behaviors trauma\nor neglect below are signs\nthat you may have a fearful\navoidant attachment style number\none childhood was shaped\nby abuse the stated\nabove a fearful avoidant\nattachment is created\nby fear this fear was\ncreated in a traumatic\nor abusive early childhood\nit could have been caused\nby neglectful or abusive parents\nwho did not create a safe\nenvironment for the child\nas a result child grew up with a sense\nof constant instability and fear\nas an adult they might feel insecure\nor unsafe in the world\nrelationships might be difficult\nto create let alone navigate\nand cultivate they never\nlearn to self-soothe\nor understand their emotions\nand unfortunately\nindividuals with a fearful\nor disorganized attachment style may try\nto replicate the same abusive\nbehavior patterns they grew up\nwith why because it feels familiar\nbecause they never learned what\na relationship could be like\noutside of what they experienced\ndismissive avoidance unlike\nfearful avoidance grew up in environments\nwhere their emotional needs\nare dismissed they prioritize\nIndependence and often suppress\nemotions making it hard\nto form deep connections\nfearful avoidance crave intimacy\nbut fear rejection while\ndismissive avoidance maintain\nemotional distance\nas a coping mechanism number\ntwo distrust in themselves\nand others for fearful\navoidance trust is a real uphill\nbattle they struggle\nnot only to trust others\nbut also to trust themselves\npast has left deep scars\nmaking it hard for them to see\n- Their own worth and to trust\nthat others truly care about\nthem it's like they're carrying\naround this heavy burden\nof doubts and uncertainty\nbecause of what they've been\nthrough on the flip side\ndismissive avoidance have more\ndifficulty trusting others\nbut they're generally more\ncomfortable trusting themselves\nthis fundamental difference\nsets them apart from fearful\navoidance number three\nfeeling like you don't deserve\nto be loved because this\nattachment style is created in a\nhostile and traumatic environment\nduring early childhood people\nwith a fearful avoidant\nattachment style may find it\ndifficult to see themselves as worthy\nof being loved not only that\nbut like what we mentioned\nearlier this trauma also often\nleads to a deep-seated distrust\nof others unlike dismissive avoidance\nwho prioritize Independence\nand emotional distance\nto cope fearful avoidance push away love\nbecause early trauma has\nshaped their perceptions\nof themselves and others\nmaking it difficult to accept\nand receive love number four\nintimate relationships are\nconfusing consequently people\nwith fearful attachment may\nfind romantic relationships\nconfusing romantic relationships\nwill be challenging\nto navigate because they\nusually involve being vulnerable\ncaring for each other\nand usually behaviors that\nevidence romantic feelings\nhowever for an individual\nwith a fearful attachment they\nmay find all this confusing\nthe difference here is\nthat fearful avoidance may crave intimacy\nbut fear rejection dismissive\navoidance prioritize autonomy\nand may struggle to navigate\nthe emotional aspects\nof romantic relationships\naltogether number five\ninsensitivity towards others another sign\nof a fearful avoidant attachment\nis an insensitivity towards\nothers however this is\nnot to say that everyone\nwith a fearful avoidant\nattachment is insensitive\nhowever there are moments\nof ambivalence they may\ndemonstrate vaguely affectionate\nfeelings while at the same\ntime distancing themselves from\nothers those who do not know\nor understand a fearful\nattachment their behavior may seem\nerratic or confusing almost\nlike they're leading a person on\nas a result it can be\ninterpreted as being insensitive\nor selfish however the vagueness\ntowards others shows the\nbattle they have within\nthemselves they desire connection\nand intimacy but are afraid\nto initiate in contrast\ndismissive avoidance typically\ndisplay a more consistent pattern\nof emotional detachment rather\nthan ambivalence they may\nappear indifferent or aloof\ntowards others prioritizing\ntheir independence and self-reliance\nabove emotional connection six tendency\nto keep conversations at\na surface level people\nwith fearful avoidant\nattachments struggle in their\nconversations with others they tend\nto keep conversations\nat a superficial level\nto avoid getting too emotionally\ninvolved in someone's life\nbut most importantly to avoid\npeople getting too close\nto them but\nhow is this different from\ndismissive avoidance well\nconversely dismissive avoidance also tend\nto engage in superficial conversations\nbut for different reasons they do so\nto avoid losing their autonomy\nand Independence rather than\nout of fear of rejection\nand being vulnerable number seven\n- Negative perspectives\nand overly reserved fearful\navoidance often hold a pervasive\npessimism around relationships\nthey often feel like they're\nnot worthy of love or acceptance\nand everyone's judging them\nwhich can make them constantly\nworry about being rejected\nor abandoned this lack\nof trust in themselves\nand others can really weigh\nthem down making it difficult\nto build meaningful connections\nand fostering a constant fear\nof being hurt this is why they tend\nto be overly reserved keeping\na distance from others\nto protect themselves from\npotential pain even something\nas simple as a friend canceling\nplans can hit them hard\nmaking them feel like it's\npersonal rejection this negative\nOutlook feeds into the cycle of self-doubt\nand self-criticism making\nit really tough for them\nto trust others or build healthy\nrelationships unlike people\nwith anxious attachments\nwho seek out validation\nand reassurance to ease their\nanxiety fearful avoidance tend\nto do the opposite because\nthey fear rejection\nor abandonment eight difficulty\ntaking responsibility\nfor their actions imagine you're carrying\naround this heavy backpack filled\nwith all the tough stuff\nyou've been through in life\nfor someone with a fearful\navoidant attachment\nthat backpack might be\npacked with experiences\nthat make them feel like they're\nalways the victim they've\nbeen through some tough times\nand it's easy for them to\nslip into a victim mindset\nbut they don't feel responsible\nfor their actions it's like\nthey're constantly dodging\nfeelings of guilt and shame\nbecause admitting fault means\nfacing some really tough\nemotions plus there's this\nconstant fear of being rejected\nor abandoned so taking\nresponsibility feels stepping into a\nminefield of potential hurt\nbut here's the thing\nby avoiding responsibility\nthey're also missing out on a\nchance to grow and heal it's like trying\nto walk forward while carrying\nthis heavy backpack it's\nholding them back from\nmoving towards healthier\nrelationships and happier life so therapy\nor some deep self-reflection\ncan help them
