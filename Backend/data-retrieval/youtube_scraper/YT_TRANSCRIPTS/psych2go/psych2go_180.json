    "transcript": "have you ever felt hurt or manipulated\nby someone and you're not sure what\nreally happened and when you finally\nrealize you're being used you feel like\nit's too late and your sense of self is\ngone if so you're not alone and you came\nto the right place one love bombing love\nbombing is when someone showers you with\na lot of attention affection and\ncompliments very quickly they make you\nfeel like you're the most special person\nin the world they might text you all the\ntime by you gifts and constantly tell\nyou how amazing you are it can really\nfeel nice at first because it seems like\nthey care about you a lot but here's the\ncatch love bombing is often not genuine\nit's a tactic that they use to gain\ncontrol over you or manipulate you they\nwant you to become emotionally attached\nto them so they can influence your\nthoughts and actions later on two hot\nand cold now that they've buttered you\nup they will use the hot and cold tactic\nalso known as trauma bonding to gain\ncontrol and power over you by\nalternating between intense affection\nand emotional withdrawal they keep you\non your toes it's like when they're\nincredibly kind and friendly one moment\nand the next moment they become cold as\nice almost like they're ignoring your\nexistence for example they ghost you\nleave you un red disappear out of\nnowhere and then they come back and give\na vague plausible explanation of why\nthey went MIA like sorry my phone died\nor I was busy the goal is to keep you\nconstantly guessing about how they'll\nact it leaves you feeling anxious always\ncraving their approval and attention\nit's basically a sneaky way to make you\nsuper dependent on them and it can\nreally mess with your head three\nintermittent reinforcement intermittent\nreinforcement is when you don't always\nget a reward for something you do just\nlike gambling it's the surprise factor\nthat keeps you trying hoping for a\nbigger win it's the reason why some\nthings feel so interesting or addictive\nit's like a little mystery that keeps\nyou hooked but this becomes toxic when\nit's applied to relationships because\nwhen someone uses intermittent\nreinforcement in relationships it means\nthey're being nice one minute and mean\nthe next you'll never know what you'll\nget every time because their reactions\nappear to be too random on purpose you\nmight be thinking wait a minute isn't\nthis the same as hot and cold fair\nenough both of these tactics have a\nsimilar goal of making you depend on\ntheir attention but in the hot and cold\nthey play with your emotions making you\nhappy one moment and anxious the next\nalternating with pain and pleasure with\nintermittent reinforcement it's more\nlike a surprise game where they want you\nto keep trying to impress them F over\nthem and ultimately you do more and more\nand more favors for them just to win the\njackpot AKA their affection and approval\nin the end it's all about making you a\nbit like a slave to them doing whatever\nthey want you to do as you become more\nand more Reliant on the attention you\nmight get the jackpot you might not but\nkeep trying both tactics are not okay so\nkeep an eye out for them okay speaking\nof making you win their approval this\nbrings us to point number four the judge\nseduction this is when someone tries to\nmake themselves seem Superior or like\nthe cool one making you work hard for\ntheir approval it's like they put\nthemselves on a pedestal and expect the\nother person to constantly prove\nthemselves how do they do this oh there\nare lots of ways here are just a few\ncanceling plans last minute or even\nforgetting about them entirely makes you\nfeel like they have better things to do\nor they flirt with other people in front\nof you or on social media as if they\nhave a never-ending line of admirers or\nwhen you talk about your thoughts and\nfeelings they might act disinterested or\ndismissive as if they're above caring\nabout your concerns oh and the most\ncommon one they might take hours or even\ndays to reply your texts making you feel\nlike your messages aren't important to\nthem five triangulation and competition\nthis is when the manipulator brings in\nsomeone else to make you feel like you\nhave to compete for their attention and\naffection stirring up jealousy and\ninsecurity for example they compare you\nwith their exes or another potential\nromantic partner they might say things\nlike my ex always knew how to surprise\nme with the most extravagant gifts I\nmiss that or Dave is a Fitness Guru with\nsix-pack abs and runs marathons I admire\nthat by doing this they're hoping to\nmake you feel like you have to compete\nfor their attention or affection\ncreating a feeling of insecurity and\nuncertainty in this situationship it's\nlike turning dating into a contest which\nis extremely toxic and\nharmful six the harmless rejection let's\nsay you've been seeing each other for a\nwhile you ask them how they feel about\nyou and they tell you they like you but\nthey can't be with you right now they\ngive a vague reason like you're too good\nfor me I need to work on myself I'm not\nready for a relationship or I prefer to\nbe single but I like you this is\nincredibly toxic and manipulative why\nbecause they want to keep you in a state\nof insecurity and dependence so they\nhave power and control over you in more\nmalicious cases they want to keep you as\na backup while pursuing other options\nall while avoiding taking responsibility\nfor their feelings and\nactions seven breadcrumbing this is when\nsomeone leaves a trail of breadcrumbs to\nkeep you interested in them but they\ndon't really want a serious relationship\nthey might send you occasional flirty\ntexts or Snapchats or they'll like your\nsocial media posts and maybe even say\nthey want to hang out but when it comes\nto making real plans or committing to\nsomething more meaningful they always\nseem to have an excuse or back out it\ncan be really confusing because they\ngive you just enough atttention to keep\nyou interested but they're not really\nlooking for a serious relationship\nbreadcrumbing can be hurtful because it\ncan make you feel like you're being\nstrung along or used for someone else's\nentertainment eight Guilt Trip let's say\nyou've figured out their tricks and\ndecided to create healthy boundaries or\nmove on that's when they start using\nguilt trips as their last resort to keep\nyou under their control and playing the\nvictim card for example they may bring\nup the sacrifices they claim to have\nmade for you they'll often exaggerate at\nor even fabricate these sacrifices to\nmake you feel indebted they say things\nlike I've given up so much for you and\nthis is how you repay me if that doesn't\nwork they may also exaggerate their own\nmisery and distress making the target\nfeel responsible for their wellbeing\nthey might say I can't go on without you\nor you're my only source of Happiness if\nall else fails they will temporarily\nwithhold affection attention or love\nmaking you feel like you need to earn it\nback through through compliance don't\nfall for it delete unfriend block and\nmove on you deserve so much\nbetter so what are your thoughts on\nthese dark manipulation tactics have you\never encountered them before let us
