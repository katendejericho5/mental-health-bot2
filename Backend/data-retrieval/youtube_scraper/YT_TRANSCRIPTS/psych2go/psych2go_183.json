    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers.\nWe're tempted to think a person is mature\nsimply because of their chronological age.\nBut what if we told you that maturity\nas a mental and psychological\nstate has very little to do\nwith physical age and more to do\nwith how we learn and adapt.\nHere are seven signs you are maturing,\neven if you don't think so.\nNumber one, you discuss ideas, not people.\nGreat minds discuss ideas,\naverage minds discuss events,\nsmall minds discuss people.\nThat came from the great\nmind of Eleanor Roosevelt.\nThe concept means that you've\nmoved on from juicy gossip,\nthe tea, as the mainstay of conversation.\nYou notice that what peaks your interest\ngiving you a dose of creative energy\nisn't the latest dirt on someone.\nYou find that you'd rather discuss\nperhaps the idea of how\nor why this kind of talk\nis so popular, or even why\ndoing it loses interest.\nYou discuss big picture things.\nDon't get us wrong though.\nSaying positive things about\nsomeone is still a good thing.\nNumber two, as much as\nyou love everyone else,\nyou also love yourself.\nOkay, we're not encouraging\nself aggrandizement.\nWe mean self acceptance\nand self validation.\nWe're sure something\nyou've noticed consistently\nin someone you see as mature\nis that they know who they are.\nIt's normal to be interested\nin what others think\nof certain points of interest\nand caring for others\nis always a strong plus.\nHowever, the mature\nindividual does not require\noutside validation to\nknow that they themselves\nare worthy of basic respect,\nlove, and compassion.\nThey understand implicitly\nthat this is the case\nand their own worth is defined by them.\nThey are no one's puppet.\nNumber three, you take\nresponsibility for your stuff.\nThis is a meeting in the middle of things.\nOn one end of the scale\nyou have the person\nwho is never wrong.\nEverything that doesn't work\nout is someone else's fault.\nThen on the other side\nyou've got the person\nwho is always to blame,\ntaking on everyone\nelse's tasks and worries.\nTogether with knowing yourself,\nmaturity is being able to assess\nand own up to your own mistakes\nbut also to be able to\ndifferentiate and set boundaries\nwhen blame is being\nmisappropriated to you,\nnot taking the world upon your shoulders.\nEssentially you are able\nto tell what's yours\nand what's not yours to control.\nNumber four, you understand\nthat not everything\nrequires your opinion.\nBelieve it or not, not\nevery post, tweet, or story\nrequires a response,\nnor are they all requiring\nsomeone to find something wrong\nwith it or to correct it.\nIf you really want your\nopinion out there by all means,\nsay something and perhaps\nalso ask yourself, why?\nMaturity comes into play\nwhen you start to ask yourself questions\nbefore you comment, like am I\ndoing this to satisfy myself?\nOr is this a matter that needs\na response out of necessity?\nGood news, maturity means\nthat you can just relax.\nNot everything requires a clap\nback, shout out, or response.\nNumber five, you know how to\ngive and also how to receive.\nWe know that giving is a good thing.\nThere are certainly enough\nrequests for donations, patrons,\nand Kickstarter campaigns to show that.\nBut how do you receive things?\nMany of us were brought up being warned\nagainst being conceited or arrogant,\nwhich in some cases\nleads to an awkward habit\nof not taking a compliment or gift\nwithout saying something\nlike I don't deserve this.\nThink of it this way.\nWhen giving, whether it be a\ncompliment or a physical gift,\nthe joy is when the other\nperson receives it graciously.\nIf they start waffling and\nsaying they don't deserve it\nor feel guilty, the act of\ngiving feels diminished.\nThe mature mind understands\nthat receiving something\nwith grace, happiness,\nand gratitude is in itself\na gift to the giver.\nNumber six, you quiet\nthe voice in your head\nthat insists that\nsomething is always wrong.\nKnowing yourself and being mature\ndoesn't mean that you\ndon't have insecurities.\nIt means that you can keep them in check.\nMany of us have that tiny voice.\nSome of us, not so tiny,\nthat constantly catastrophizes,\nit's the voice that pushes\nyou to overwork and burnout\nbecause the other (indistinct)\nIt insists the professor's compliments\nare just an act for their job.\nIt means nothing and you still might fail.\nMaturity is the deep breath\nthat takes you by the shoulders,\nlooks you in the eye and says,\nreally, is that really\nwhat's happening here?\nThink about it.\nThe mature you takes that mental pause\ncritically thinks about it,\nthen uses the evidence\nto take the best action.\nThey don't let the inner critic push them\ninto exhaustive overdrive.\nTrust yourself, and that you can cope.\nYou are enough and you got this.\nAnd number seven, you manage your emotions\ninstead of being controlled by them.\nWhen you let your emotions control you,\nthat's when hurtful,\nregretful outbursts happen.\nAt extremes, impulsive disastrous\ncrimes of passion happen.\nWhen they're repressed to look strong,\nyou've got pressure built up.\nWhile you can't control your\nemotions like a thermostat\nwith a dial, you can manage them.\nOne sign of maturity\nis when you don't act\non emotional impulses.\nYou learn to identify them,\nsit with them, and accept them.\nWhen you're mature, you are\nable to channel your emotions\nin a constructive way, rather\nthan a destructive way.\nSo yeah, age isn't a measure of maturity.\nMaturity is the ability to respond, cope,\nand reason appropriately\nfor the situation.\nAge is just often referred to\nbecause most of us need time\nto learn how to do all of that.\nAnd don't worry, we all\noccasionally have slip ups,\nacting childishly.\nNo one's perfect.\nMaturity lets us acknowledge\nthe slip and learn from it.\nIt's growth and we never stop growing.\nHow do you feel about\neach of these points?\nDo you recognize some of these behaviors\nbecoming truer for you?\nWe love for your comments and\ndiscussion as well as a Like.\nWe promise to accept it graciously!\nThanks for watching.\nAnd we'll see you soon."
