    "transcript": "philosopher Emmanuel Kant said love is\nnot only a feeling of passion and is\nalso a choice to commit to care for and\nsupport another person\nwhen it comes to a manipulative partner\nthese essential components of love may\nbe absent or distorted\nbeing in love with a manipulator can be\na confusing challenging and painful\nexperience especially when we've\nconvinced ourselves that everything is\nfine\nit's essential to recognize the signs of\nmanipulation so that you can protect\nyourself from emotional harm\nset healthy boundaries and seek support\nhere are five signs that you may be in\nlove with a manipulator\nlove bombing\nthink back to the early stages of your\nrelationship with your partner did they\nmake you feel like the center of the\nuniverse shower you with excessive gifts\nlove and affection even saying I love\nyou before getting to know you perhaps\nthey tried to rush the relationship\nforward discussing marriage or the idea\nof moving in together before you were\nready\nthis sounds like love bombing but what\nexactly does that mean according to\npsychology today love bombing is a\ncommon tactic of manipulation where one\npartner bombs the other partner with\noverly affectionate Behavior\nmanipulators do this to gain trust and\nmake their partner more dependent on\nthem while it may feel good to be the\ncenter of someone's world love bombing\nis not a sign of genuine love and\naffection it's important to note that\naccording to psychiatrist Dr Dale Archer\nexcessive attention and affection does\nnot always constitute love bombing if\nthere is no further abuse however don't\nbe surprised if you notice a devaluation\nphase where your partner stops showing\naffection and uses other forms of\nmanipulation Archer suggests that love\nbombing typically decreases or\ndisappears altogether as the\nrelationship progresses once the\nmanipulator gains control they may no\nlonger feel the need to use love bombing\nas a tactic and instead May resort to\nother manipulative tactics like\ngaslighting gaslighting everyone thinks\nyou're crazy you're imagining things I\nnever said that I did this because you\nmade me this is your fault\nsound familiar gaslighters try to fill\ntheir victim with doubt and in turn make\nthem question their own reality\nfurthering their control over them\nstudies from the open Journal of medical\npsychology found that gaslighters often\nuse various tactics to achieve their\ngoals such as frequently denying things\nthey've said blaming others for their\nbehavior or twisting the truth to make\nthemselves look good you may find\nyourself doubting your own sanity or\nwondering if you're overreacting to\nsituations according to Dr Stephanie\nSarkis manipulators may also use\ngaslighting to isolate you from others\nmaking you think that they're the only\none who cares they may criticize your\nloved ones or create conflict between\nthem making it difficult for you to\nmaintain those relationships does your\npartner say things like your family\ndoesn't really care about you or your\nfriends are just trying to hold you back\nthis can make the victim feel like they\ncan only rely on the manipulator for\nemotional support\nremember you are never alone you can\nalways reach out to a mental health\nprofessional or find support groups for\nhelp\nyour partner often plays the victim\nmanipulators use the victim rule as a\nway of diverting attention from their\nharmful behavior and gaining sympathy\nand support from others they may even\nmake you feel guilty for things that are\nnot your fault\nErin Leonard PhD from Psychology today\nsays that manipulators may do this by\nexaggerating or inventing their own\nstruggles or portraying themselves as\npowerless and vulnerable even if they\ncaused the problem they may present\nthemselves as the one who has been\nwronged they don't want sympathy though\njust control by saying things like\nnobody understands me or you don't\nappreciate everything I do for you\nmanipulators can induce feelings of\nguilt or responsibility in their victims\nand lead them to believe that the\nmanipulator can do no wrong it's crucial\nto recognize this behavior and avoid\nfalling prey to a manipulator's victim\nplaying tactics\nwalking on eggshells do you feel like\nyou're constantly tiptoeing around your\npartner's emotions worried about\nupsetting them or saying the wrong thing\ndo you find yourself making excuses for\nthe manipulator's behavior in order to\nprotect yourself or avoid conflict\nmanipulators often use fear and\nintimidation to control their partner\nthey can be unpredictable and may react\nin Extreme Ways to minor things leaving\nyou feeling like you can't predict how\nthey will react to a given situation\nthis can make it feel like you're\nconstantly treading carefully and trying\nto avoid doing something that will cause\nan explosive reaction\nthis is a very stressful way to live and\nit can be exhausting to always be on\nguard remember this isn't your fault you\ndeserve to feel safe and respected in a\nhealthy relationship\nin her book The highly sensitive\nPerson's Guide to dealing with toxic\npeople author shahida Arabi encourages\nyou to step away from self-blame and\nstop attempting to please someone who\ncannot be pleased a toxic person's\nBehavior cannot be changed unless they\nsee a problem within themselves and are\nabsolutely willing to work on themselves\nto change it\nyou feel like you're the only one\nputting in effort\nbeing in a relationship with a\nmanipulator can be draining and it's not\nuncommon to feel like you're the only\none putting in effort manipulators use\ntheir partner's love and devotion as a\nway of controlling them taking advantage\nof their willingness to do anything to\nkeep the relationship going\nDr Dale Archer in Psychology today says\nthat manipulators don't really care\nabout their partner only what they can\ndo for them\nif you're constantly trying to make\nthings work while your partner is not\nputting in the same amount of effort you\nmay feel like you're carrying the weight\nof the relationship all on your own\nshoulders\nwhich can be a very isolating and\nfrustrating experience\nin a healthy relationship both parties\nshould put in equal effort and respect\neach other's boundaries love goes two\nways if you're in a relationship with a\nmanipulator and feel like your efforts\nare not being appreciated no matter how\noften you ask it may be time to\nreevaluate the partnership\nit can be difficult to recognize when\nsomeone is manipulating you it's\nimportant to note that it's not just one\nsign but rather a collection that could\nindicate manipulative Tendencies than a\npartner so where do you go from here\npsychologist Dr Harriet breaker says you\nshould never try to change a manipulator\ninstead rather change your actions\ntowards the manipulation try to step\nback and evaluate the situation\nobjectively be firm in your boundaries\nseek support from trusted friends or\nfamily members or consider speaking with\na therapist who can
