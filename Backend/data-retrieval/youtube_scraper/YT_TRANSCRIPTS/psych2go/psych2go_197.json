    "transcript": "it's okay to feel all sorts of anxiety\nand nerves before entering into a\nrelationship we are all afraid of\ngetting hurt sometimes you fall in love\nwith someone who breaks your heart\nsometimes you fall in love with someone\nand end up breaking someone's heart it's\na lot of unknowns and unknowns can be\nnerve-wracking sometimes these fears and\nanxieties freeze you in your tracks but\nyou may not know why if you want to\nstart dating but are terrified stay\ntuned we're breaking down four reasons\nwhy you may be afraid to date again it\nhappened before it'll happen again the\ngreatest obstacle between you and a new\nrelationship can be the ghosts of past\npartners we often believe that the past\nis bound to repeat itself but that's not\nalways the case in fact this kind of\nbelief is what psychologists call a\nhindsight bias or the new it all along\neffect this is the tendency to view\nsituations as more predictable than they\nactually are this bias was demonstrated\nin 1993 by researchers Dorothy Dietrich\nand and Matthew also prior to judge\nClarence Thomas's appointment to the\nSupreme Court the researchers asked\nstudents to guess if he would be\nconfirmed or not 58% said that he would\nbe confirmed after Thomas was confirmed\n78 of the students said that he would be\nconfirmed now what does this have to do\nwith relationships you ask well we tend\nto do the same thing in a relationship\nin the relationship we believe\neverything is going fine it's only after\nthe fact that we believe there were red\nflies everywhere a hindsight bias causes\nmemory Distortion which can cause you to\nremember the relationship is better or\nworse than it actually was let's say you\nonly have bad memories of your past\nrelationships would you want to jump\ninto a new relationship regardless of\nthe hurt you may have experienced it is\npossible to find someone better and love\nagain uncomfortable with\nvulnerability love requires us to be\nopen and vulnerable this is a difficult\ntask because no one wants to be\nvulnerable in front of someone there's\nalways some resistance because we all\nfear rejection what if they stop liking\nus what if they don't like us to start\nthe person who loves you is waiting with\nopen arms no changes needed dating isn't\nthe only reason why we feel vulnerable\naccording to studies done between 2007\nand 2014 by psychologists and\nresearchers like devonson kotov and Wang\npeople who avoid vulnerability tend to\nhave anxious temperament or struggle\nwith anxiety if this is the case for you\nreaching out to a professional therapist\ncould be your best bet\nnegative Role Models thank God for Mom\nand Dad for sticking two together cuz we\ndon't know how wise words it's Outcast\nthe relationships you witness growing up\nmight be why you either enter or run\naway from\nrelationships if unfortunately you\nwitnessed your parents bickering\nfrequently that may have left a scar in\nhis book marital conflict in children an\nemotional security perspective E mark\nCummings psychologist from the\nUniversity of Notre Dame and his\ncolleagues discuss the possible\nrepercussions of growing up watching\nyour parents fighting Cummings mentions\nthat aggression between parents can\ncause the child to worry excessive\narguing brings a sense of instability\nand children can develop sleep\ndisturbances and health issues in\nextreme cases children begin to\ndisengage additionally Anthropologist\nMark Flynn and Barry England conducted a\n20-year-long study in 1999 measuring\ncortisol levels of children from various\nfamily Dynamics they discovered that\nchildren who came from quarreling\nfamilies developed higher levels of\ncortisol if all you saw were couples\nfighting it may be super important to\nfind that you and your partners take a\nconflict resolution class or do couples\ncounseling you don't have to repeat that\nbehavior you can choose differently and\nwork together with your partner to\nstrengthen your\nrelationship overachieving expectations\nmany of us have expectations when we\nenter a relationship we have ideas of\nwhat we want our relationship to be like\nlike and that's great I'm all about\nhaving expectations and goals in fact\nhaving expectations in a relationship\ncan enhance it research from 1994 in\n2012 affirms that having optimistic\nexpectations in a relationship improves\nthe connection between the people\ninvolved however not all expectations\nare good if the relationship is already\non the Rocks having expectations can\nharm it a study done by psychologists\nJame K mcnalty and Benjamin R Carney\nfound expectation causes a steeper\ndecline in relationship satisfaction why\nbecause expectations were never met but\nhaving expectations is not the problem\nthe problem lies in the kind of\nexpectations you set in your\nrelationship you can expect love care\nand respect in your relationship but you\ncannot expect your partner to suddenly\ntransform into junuk or Jim or any BTS\nmember overnight love is like skydiving\nit looks cool but it takes a lot of\nthought and commitment to get started\nlove is a commitment and a huge leap of\nfaith you need faith and courage to\nbelieve in yourself and to believe in\nthat other person"
