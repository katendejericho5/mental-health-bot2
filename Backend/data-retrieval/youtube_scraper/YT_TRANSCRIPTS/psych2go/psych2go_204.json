first\nstudied by therapist Pete Walker who\ndefines hawning as a survival strategy\nrooted in people pleasing Behavior it\noften arises from a deep rooted fear of\nrejection or a desire to avoid conflict\nat any cost people who engage in fawning\ntend to prioritize the needs wants and\nemotions of others above their own they\nmay go to Great Lengths to please others\nsacrificing their own well-being and\npersonal boundaries in the process with\nthat said here are six Telltale signs\nthat you're abandoning yourself for\nothers according to\nexperts difficulty setting boundaries\nstruggling to establish and enforce\npersonal boundaries can be a red flag\nfor fawning when you struggle to set\nboundaries it means you have difficulty\ndefining and communicating what is\nacceptable or unacceptable to you in\nyour\nrelationships you may fear that\nasserting your boundaries will lead to\nconflict or rejection\nas a result you may allow others to\noverstep your
