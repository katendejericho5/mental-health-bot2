    "transcript": "do you feel like bad days are now your\nnew normal\nwell truth is bad days are often caused\nby our own built up bad habits or an\nunderlying maybe unconscious belief that\nif it starts bad it's going to just get\nworse that means you usually have the\npower to not have a bad day\nit's all about setting the stage for it\nto happen\nhere are some quick tips that are good\nhabits to cultivate you may even find\nthat some bad habits are only bad\nbecause of the way they've been handled\nso far\nso here are a few habits to help you\nmake your day better\nnumber one\nremembering to be grateful this isn't\nmomentarily saying okay this in my life\nis good that in my life is good\nit's a brain exercise\na brain exercise\nyeah you're training your brain to see\nthe good and the beauty of life as part\nof its norm instead of living in a\nblanket of problems and negativity\nthe when you do this is up to you\ndoing it at the start of your day means\nyou set the day up for a positive\noutlook doing it before bed helps to\nunload heaviness and exhaustive stress\nthoughts\nnumber two\nchange your scenery buy a plane ticket\nnot necessarily a walk in the park works\ntoo visiting a new place once in a while\ncan help stimulate your mind giving you\nthat recharge so you can continue doing\nwork in a healthy head space\nnumber three do one thing at a time\nwe know it sounds more efficient if you\ncan do everything all at once\nunfortunately human cloning isn't a\nthing because that's the only way all at\nonce would really work\npartially doing a whole bunch of little\nthings will leave you with a whole bunch\nof unfinished things that are hastily\nwrapped up because you're now\noverwhelmed\nyou're a quality person and when you do\none thing at a time that quality shines\nthrough if it's a massive project break\nit up into itty bitty parts that you\ncomplete one at a time in entirety\neach small completion is a win 50 wins\nand a quality result versus one sort of\nwin with a mediocre result\nwhich one sounds better\nnumber four\nlaugh\nlaughter is as they say the best\nmedicine it activates the release of\nsome feel-good hormones and spreads joy\nto others it helps break tension and\nlighten negative feelings\nyour day is going to be better if you\nand the people in your life are happier\nnumber five help someone\nthis one has a double positive firstly\nhelping others is the way humans usually\nfunction happiest we feel accomplished\nuseful even valuable helping someone\nexercises our empathy and compassion\nallowing us to expand our perspective\nand subsequently allowing us to like\nourselves more\nsecondly in helping another person\nyou're helping to problem-solve and this\nin turn could give you the knowledge and\ninspiration on how to deal with an issue\nin your own life\nnumber six prepare the night before\nif we're honest with ourselves sometimes\nthat bad day happens because we didn't\nprep the night before\nwe know when it's late and you just want\nto sleep it's easy to convince yourself\ni can totally quickly do that thing in\nthe morning\nand we know how that works out\nmorning arrives your half asleep brain\nand body won't do the thing and now\nyou're stressed frazzled and feeling\ninsecure\nso just give an honest little rebuttal\nto the voice that's telling you i can do\nthis in the morning and take at least a\nfew minutes to do some prep for the next\nday\nwhen you wake up and it's all ready to\ngo you'll already be doing gratitude\npractice\nnumber seven\nhype yourself up\nyes we're telling you to buy into your\nown hype it may not work for everyone\nbut it's worth a try before a big event\nor performance even going to a gathering\nyou're nervous about you can buy into\nyour own hype for just that amount of\ntime\nthat booster shot of extra self-belief\neven though temporary could be what\nmakes the big deal event go that much\nsmoother which in turn can make the day\nthe week your life\nthat much better\nsaying or writing down affirmations\nevery day can help with this and\ngradually with increased self belief\nconfidence will naturally flow\nnumber eight\nrelaxation\nyep we said it relax\nokay we know that sounds super vague i\ndon't know how to relax you say\nnot to worry we're not going to leave\nyou hanging to practice relaxing as odd\nas that sounds create a relax and\nde-stress routine this can be as simple\nas reading a good book taking a warm\nbath and listening to calming music\nthis will allow you to focus on each\nstep and really do the relaxing\ndetaching and unwinding\nthis means too that the hamster wheel of\nworry is no longer interrupting your\nsleep and better sleep means better mood\nnumber nine take your time\nwe all want to do things quickly to get\nto the next thing and then to the next\nbut we forget that sometimes the best\nthing you can do is take your time to\nenjoy what you're doing at the moment\ntaking your time ensures that you do a\ngood job on your project that you focus\non it and that you learn how to be in\nthe present moment\nbonus this is a sort of gratitude\npractice allowing you to get the best\nout of every second and be present in\nthe moment although the media would like\nto have us believe that if we buy that\nproduct our lives will be better in\ntruth it's the little things that only\nwe can do for ourselves that make the\nbiggest difference\nthese tips are by no means exhaustive\nbut we hope we've given you an idea of\nthings to try or maybe inspired you to\nlook up other happy habits to learn\nwhich of these happy habits have you\ntried or have worked for you any other\nhabits you'd like to suggest please feel\nfree to comment discuss and spread the\njoy we
