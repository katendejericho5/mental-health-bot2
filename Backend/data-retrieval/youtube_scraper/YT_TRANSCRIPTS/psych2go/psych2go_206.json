things that\nmight be keeping you from finding\nrelationships that work one you have\ncynical views about love what's that\nsaying again once bitten twice shy it's\ncommon for people who have been stung by\nlove before to stop believing in the\nmagic of romance you have every right to\ngrieve feel hurt and learn from the\nexperience but being stuck in your\nnegative ways and dwelling on your pain\nresentment and regret is only going to\nclose you off from New Opportunities to\nfind the one who truly loves you for who\nyou are two use said unrealistic\nstandards nowadays we see so many\npictures and posts online about couples\nwho are # relationship goals that it may\nstart to clad your judgment and give you\nunrealistically high standards you might\nturn down great dating prospects or\nthrow away a special connection you had\nwith someone just because it wasn't\neverything you hoped it would be but the\ntruth is sometimes relationships are\nmore about being the right person person\nthan finding the right person three\nyou've set too many deal breakers you\nhave standards you know what you want\nand that's a good thing but expecting\ntoo much of your potential Partners too\nfast sets the scene for failure and\ndisappointment are you so quick to call\nit quits and run away at the first sign\nof\nimperfection just as you deserve a fair\nchance so do they in the end\nrelationships take time and effort and\nsometimes those flaws make this person\nuniquely tailored for your relationship\nit's in the complete acceptance of an\nimperfect person that we find the kind\nof love that's meant to last or you have\nunresolved past trauma whether it's a\nmessy breakup a toxic relationship or an\nunhappy childhood your past can leave\nyou with loads of painful memories and\nemotional scars that you often never\nreally get over you end up carrying that\ntrauma with you throughout your life\nunknowingly allowing it to ruin your\nrelationships resolution acceptance and\nbeing at peace with your past will not\nnot only negate most of the detrimental\neffects but also help you be a better\npartner giving the relationship its best\nchance to stand the test of\ntime five you have low self-esteem I\nknow you've heard the quote you can't\nlove someone else until you learn to\nlove yourself first when you suffer from\nlow self-esteem you tend to lose\nyourself and your partner instead of\ndeveloping your own sense of self your\npartner is used as a substitute since\nyou feel like you're Unworthy of their\nlove you constantly worry that they'll\neventually realize that and leave the\ninsecurity makes this a self-fulfilling\nprophecy through things like\nmisinterpreting small actions\ncatastrophizing and constantly\nsuspecting your partner of things this\ncan be exhausting for the other person\nand for you six you have a fear of\nHappiness hey don't laugh we know how it\nsounds why would anyone fear being\nhappy we humans are strange creatures\nand this indeed is something that\nhappens even though most of us aren't\naware of it are you afraid of what would\nhappen if you ever did find the one so\nafraid that it leads you to sabotaging\nyour own relationships do you push\npeople away before they can get too\nclose to you because having an honest\nemotional connection with someone scares\nyou you try not to get too attached and\nsuppress your desire for connection so\nmuch so That Others May misunderstand\nand think you're inconsiderate\ninconsistent and not at all\ninterested seven you have trust issues\ndo you feel jealous about your partner\nbeing close with other people does it\nmake you uncomfortable to think of them\ngoing out without you do you need to\nread their messages and know where they\nare all the time just to feel secure sad\nto say nothing Dooms a relationship\nfaster than a lack of mutual trust\nbehaving like you don't trust them will\ncause your partner to grow resentful of\nyou over time no one likes being\nconstantly controlled and Under\nSuspicion eight you think you'll lose\nyour independence by being in a\nrelationship the romcom movies always\nsay you complete me which isn't the\nhealthiest of messages perhaps you\nsubconsciously fear commitment because\nyou think you'll lose your Independence\nor Freedom when you do find a\nrelationship the truth is the opposite\nremember this in a healthy relationship\nyou should never have to sacrifice your\npersonality your Independence or who you\nare for a romantic partner the Hallmark\nof every strong enduring relationship is\nlearning to maintain your Independence\nwhile still being happily committed to\nsomeone nine you want someone one you\ncan't or shouldn't have most of us are\nguilty of liking somebody against our\nbetter judgments probably even more than\nonce whether it's because they're\nalready taken or emotionally unavailable\nit's easy to fall in love with the wrong\npeople obsessing over the forbidden\nfruit closes off your ability to\nconsider the more compatible and better\nsuited people for you and 10 you don't\nlearn from your mistakes we all make\nmistakes we're only human but what\nmistakes have you made in in your past\nrelationships and what have you learned\nfrom them what's changed about you and\nhow you look at things because of your\nmistakes if you don't know or believe\nyou've never done anything wrong this\nmay be the most detrimental factor to\nyour ability to find a lasting\nrelationship mistakes allow us to learn\ngrow and be better the next time around\nif there's no learning the same mistakes\noccur and the cycle is\nendless a relationship takes more than\none person luckily enough one of those\npeople is you how do you think you're\ndoing what went sideways in previous\nrelationships do you relate to any of\nthese signs in this video or perhaps you\nsee your friend who has these signs\nknowing the answers to these goes a long\nway to helping you on your quest for\nlove Hollywood marketing companies have\na lot of people chasing after love like\nit's a prize or a status symbol but\nwhat's the big deal with relationships\ndo you need a New Year's kiss or a\nvalentine are relationships overrated\nmaybe not for everyone one but there\ndefinitely are some benefits to being\nsingle relationships can be wonderful\nbut being single can too you don't have\nto be bitter and lonely let's take a\nlook at a few of the benefits of being\nsingle strengthening bonds according to\nmaso's hierarchy of needs something we\nall want is love and belonging we want\nto be loved unconditionally we want\nsomeone who we can talk to about\nanything a lot of the time especially as\nwe get older that Gap seems to become\nmore obvious and we tend to think that\nthe thing that's missing is romantic\nlove because of that we lose sight of\nthe fact that we can receive love and\naffection from many sources not just a\nromantic partner a study conducted in\n2016 revealed that receiving support\nfrom other sources like your friends and\nfamily can mitigate feelings of romantic\nloneliness in other words spending time\nwith friends and family can keep that\nnagging feeling that something is\nmissing away permission to be selfish a\n2013 article published in politics\nphilosophy and economics titled can a\ncompromise be fair states that\ncompromises need to occur in\nrelationships even at the cost of\nfairness this means compromises aren't\nalways fair but they are necessary for a\nrelationship to work that's good news\nfor single people of course compromises\nwill still come up as you balance work\nor school friends and family but the\nmost stressful and timeconsuming\ncompromises come with being in a\nrelationship you don't need to discuss\nplans of the significant other\nyou can just decide on things yourself\nyou don't need to compromise feel like\ntrading yourself to Sushi in a movie on\na lovely Sunday afternoon you can that\nincludes not worrying about the option\nneeds or wants that a significant other\nwould have no worrying that they're not\nin the mood for sushi or that they don't\nwant to see the movie you picked it's\nthe one time aside from your birthday\nthat you can be a little more selfish\nthan usual look within when you're\nsingle and don't have to compromise you\nhave more time to discover the things\nthat make you you whether you like to\nspend entire days playing video games or\nwatching Niche films that make other\npeople squeamish you can do whatever\ntickles your fancy when you aren't in a\nrelationship this also extends to\nintrospection you have time to look in\nwordss and learn about yourself you can\nfigure out everything that you need and\nwant in life you'll also have time to\nrecognize and heal past trauma when\nyou're in a relation ship your goals\nneed to fit into the relationship or a\ncompromise needs to be met you shouldn't\nhave to compromise on your dreams and\nthe things that you're most passionate\nabout in a thesis written in 2019 titled\nseeking Solitude the positive effect of\nbeing alone PhD candidate Samantha Voss\nwrote being in uninterrupted silence\ngets you involved in your own emotions\nand thoughts you get to really\nunderstand them create an inward\nawareness that helps you improve your\noutward awareness\nand that sums it up perfectly mental\nhealth existentialist philosopher Jean\nPaul Sartre has a famous quote that says\nif you're lonely when you're alone\nyou're in Bad Company being in a\nrelationship shouldn't negatively affect\nyour mental health but it can this also\ngoes for being single but when you're\nsingle you can choose that alone time\nfor your mental health whenever you need\nit a few Studies have been done on the\neffects of a relationship on your mental\nhealth clinical psychologists Scott\nbraith White found that improving your\nrelationship can improve your mental\nhealth but improving your mental health\nwon't necessarily improve your\nrelationships this suggests that if you\nhave mental health issues now getting\ninto a relationship isn't a way to solve\nthese issues according to psychologist\nAdele 4th there is a possibility that\nyour relationship can lead to trauma if\nyour partner is or becomes abusive that\nshouldn't be something you have to worry\nabout while you're single take time to\nappreciate your own company and make\nsure your mental space is healthy\nuse this time to care for yourself do a\nface mask work out or watch some trash\nTV treat yourself well you can always\nexperience romance on your own through a\nsolo date unlike Lady Gaga you don't\nwant a bad romance relationships can be\nwonderful but if you're waiting for the\none not interested in
