    "transcript": "hey psych2goers someone in the comments\nsuggested this topic idea shout out to\nMoe for this interesting topic so do you\nconsider yourself a smart person you\nmight be smarter than you give yourself\ncredit for here are seven things smart\npeople never pay attention to and what\nthey do instead number one limiting\nbeliefs psychology is chock full of\nscientific studies that show us how our\nway of thinking impacts our life and\nindeed they all support the idea that we\ncan only go as far as our minds let us\nand while most people may not be aware\nof it so many of us hold ourselves back\nfrom achieving happiness and success\nwith our own limiting beliefs we limit\nourselves in what we can attain when we\ngive into our unhealthy fear of failure\nfear of being alone fear of rejection\nfear of trying our best in fear of\nfinding out what it is we're really\ncapable of what smart people have\nlearned to let go of these limiting\nbeliefs and found true fulfillment\nbecause of them\nnumber two what-if scenarios another\nthing smart people don't like to waste\ntheir time on is the idea of what could\nhave been because they know there's no\npoint they don't get hung up on the past\nand dwell on their mistakes because as\nMaya Angelou once said you do the best\nyou can until you know better then when\nyou know better you do better this is\nwhat makes them bounce back from failure\nso much quicker than other people do\nthey're not afraid to look back on their\nmistakes because they don't let\nthemselves wallow in self-pity and\nself-blame over it number three their\nown ego\nwhether we like to admit it or not a lot\nof us are also guilty not just of\nletting our past mistakes affect us in\nthe present but also our past successes\nsometimes we let our achievements and\ntriumphs inflate our ego and get to our\nheads making us overestimate our own\nabilities but smart people don't make\nthe mistake of letting themselves get\nlazy or arrogant\nthey keep themselves humble and grounded\nand constantly look for new\nopportunities to grow as people\nthey want to learn try and do as much as\nthey can because they have an insatiable\ndesire to become the best possible\nversion of themselves\nnumber four materialistic desires\nmaterialism Studies have found can be\ndetrimental to our overall happiness and\nlife satisfaction and harm our social\nRelationships by breeding envy and\ncompetition and while we might all be\naware of this already letting go of our\nmaterialistic desires is a lot easier\nsaid than done\nwhat sets smart people apart however is\nthat they consciously choose to focus\ninstead on intrinsic goals more than\nextrinsic ones so while materialistic\npeople are more Cutthroat and selfish\nothers would rather satisfy our need for\nbelonging autonomy self-actualization\nand emotional fulfillment number five\nhedonistic tendencies\nhave you ever noticed that smarter\npeople tend to be more responsible and\nget into less trouble that's not to say\nof course that a smart person is a stick\nin the mud who doesn't know how to have\nfun but rather they don't give in to\ntheir hedonistic Tendencies and take\nunnecessary risks they prefer an\norganized lifestyle to a throws a human\nand avoid rushing into things because\nthey understand that every action has\nunintended consequences they also are\nmindful of how their words and actions\naffect others and try not to let their\nemotions get the best of them number six\nrumors and gossip another important sign\nof intelligent you might not realize is\na disinterest in rumors and gossip as\nSocrates once said strong Minds discuss\nideas average Minds discuss events and\nweak Minds discuss people so smart\npeople don't waste their time gossiping\nwith others because they just don't find\nthat kind of talk stimulating or\ninteresting they also know better than\nto judge a person solely by their\nreputation and are more open-minded than\nmost in that regard which bring brings\nus to our next and final point number\nseven other people's opinions about them\nsimilar to how smart people don't care\nfor gossip or rumors they also don't\nlike to pay attention to what other\npeople have to say about them or their\nideas they don't let their fear of\njudgment or rejection keep them from\nfulfilling their Ambitions and pursuing\ntheir passions because they know that\nthose who mind don't matter and those\nwho matter don't mind they're not afraid\nto be themselves even if it makes them\nunlikable to some and they won't let\nother people's negativity discourage\nthem from realizing their ideas and\ndoing what they really want\nso do you relate to any of the things\nwe've mentioned here do you think you're\na smart person because you don't pay\nattention to any of these things\nremember smart is an objective adjective\nand it can mean many different things\nall of us are intelligent in some way\nand also have weaknesses we need to work\non\ndid you enjoy this video please like and\nshare it with friends that might find\nInsight in it too make sure to subscribe\nto
