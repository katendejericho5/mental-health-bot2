    "transcript": "have you ever felt caught in a tug-of\nwar between your gut instinct and the\npossible influence of past\ntraumas sometimes it's challenging to\ndiscern between the two as they can\noften become Tangled leading to\nconfusion and distress but\ndistinguishing between them is crucial\nas they can greatly influence our\ndecisions relationships and overall\nwell-being so let's dive into a deeper\nunderstanding and unfold the seven signs\nthat might suggest it's your trauma\nspeaking not your gut instinct\noverreacting do you find yourself\nreacting intensely to even minor\nstressors Dr Bessel Vander culk a\nleading trauma expert explains that\ntrauma survivors often have a heightened\nstress response this is because their\nbrains have been wired to be in constant\nfight flight or freeze mode due to past\ntraumatic events it's like you're in a\ngentle stream but the slightest dripple\nfeels like a tidal wave this Amplified\nreaction isn't your intuition sensing\nDanger it's your brain's learned\nresponse to past\ntraumas difficulty trusting do you find\nit challenging to trust people even\nthose who have shown nothing but\nkindness and\nreliability according to psychiatrist\nand Trauma expert Dr Judith Herman\ntrauma survivors often struggle with\ntrust issues as a protective mechanism\nwhen someone has violated your trust in\nthe past especially in a traumatic way\nyour brain learns to be wary as a means\nof self- protection it's like you're in\na lush Garden surrounded by beautiful\nand harmless flowers but you're afraid\nto touch them because once a thorn\npricked you this apprehension is not\nyour intuition telling you that everyone\nis out to hurt you it's the painful\nmemories from past betrayals causing you\nto put up walls fear of\nAbandonment do you constantly fear being\nleft alone even when you're surrounded\nby supportive and caring people\naccording to pioneering attachment\nTheory psychologist Dr John Balby early\nlife traumas can lead to a persistent\nfear of Abandonment when your attachment\nfigures in early life were inconsistent\nunavailable or neglectful it can create\na deep-seated fear that others will\nleave you it's like you're standing in a\nroom full of people who care about you\nbut you can't shake the feeling that\nthey'll leave at any moment this\nconstant fear isn't your intuition\nguiding you it's a deep-seated fear that\nwas formed in response to early life\ntraumas\noverthinking do you find yourself\nexpecting the worst in every situation\neven when things are going well\naccording to psychologist Dr Rick Hansen\ntrauma can lead to negative bias our\nbrains are wired to pay more attention\nto threats to our survival however when\nwe've experienced trauma this Instinct\ncan become hyperactive causing us to\nperceive threats even in safe situations\nit's like being being in a beautifully\ndecorated room but you're focused on the\nsingle stain on the carpet this isn't\nyour gut instinct telling you that\nsomething is wrong it's a learned\nresponse from past traumas that's\ncausing you to expect the worst\nuncomfortable with stability have you\never felt uneasy when life is calm and\nstable according to Leading childhood\ntrauma expert Dr Bruce Perry survivors\ncan feel uncomfortable with stability\ndue to past chaos\nthis discomfort may seem\ncounterintuitive but when you've grown\naccustomed to a life of unpredictability\nand turmoil stability can feel foreign\nand\nunsettling it's like you've become so\nused to navigating through stormy seas\nthat when the water is finally calm you\nfeel lost Restless or uneasy your mind\nhas learned to equate chaos with normaly\nand calmness seems like the Calm before\nthe storm this is not your gut instinct\nwarning you of impend in Doom it's the\necho of past chaos\nhypervigilance are you often overly\nalert or watchful especially when\nthere's no apparent danger Dr Peter a\nLaVine known for his work in stress and\nTrauma explains that trauma survivors\noften experience hypervigilance a state\nof increased alertness where you are\nconstantly on the lookout for hidden\ndangers both real and assumed it's like\nbeing in a quiet Forest but every rustle\nof leaves sends your heart p pounding\nyour senses are heightened you're on\nedge and you're constantly anticipating\ndanger even though there's no apparent\nthreat this state of chronic alertness\ncan be exhausting and anxiety\ninducing it's not your intuition warning\nyou but the echos of past trauma causing\nyour heightened state of\nalertness avoidance do you find yourself\navoiding certain people places or\nsituations without a clear reason\naccording to Dr Francine Shapiro the\ndeveloper of em MDR therapy trauma\nsurvivors often avoid triggers that\nremind them of their past traumas this\navoidance is protective in the mind's\nway of trying to prevent the\nreexperiencing of distressing emotions\nlinked to the trauma it's like the mind\ncreates a no-go Zone around anything\nthat might bring the traumatic event\nback to the surface you're avoiding a\ncertain route not because it's dangerous\nor inconvenient but because it somehow\nmakes you uncomfortable it's not your\nintuition guiding you it's a sign of un\nhealed trauma remember that\nunderstanding our emotions is a journey\nnot a Sprint if you're seeing yourself\nin these signs don't be shy about\nreaching out to a mental health Pro\nevery step you take gets you closer to\nHealing if you enjoyed this
