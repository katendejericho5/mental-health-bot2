    "transcript": "relationships can be tough and they're\nnot always filled with romance and\nflowers and dates that sweep you off\nyour feet difficult times come along in\nany good relationship a good number of\ncouples can still manage to hold on\ntogether if they both bring trust\nrespect and kindness to the relationship\nbut other times no matter how hard you\nmay want to hold on to your once perfect\npartner sometimes you just need to let\ngo I Won't Let Go\nJack to help you pinpoint the behaviors\nthat may mean it's time to let go of\nyour beloved Jack Dawson here are six\nsigns you should move on from a\nrelationship number one you lack trust\nin each other trust is an important part\nof any successful relationship you and\nyour partner should build a relationship\non trust along with other important\nqualities such as kindness and respect\nif you don't trust your partner how can\nyou ever move forward as a couple when\nyou lack trust in them you may find\nyourself questioning if your partner is\nreally where they say they are when\nyou're not around you wonder where they\ngo or what they're doing you get angry\nand suspicious it leads to more and more\narguments number two you don't like each\nother anymore you once had a romance\nthat you believed would last eons now\nyou can barely stand the way they pop\ntheir gum and even something as trivial\nas the way they chew gum turns into a\nfight odds are these arguments over a\nlittle irritations and annoying habits\nmay have a deeper meaning you may fight\nover how loud your partner pops their\ngum while you're both cuddled up and\nwatching a movie when a dramatic movie\nlike Titanic is on you need silence shut\nup but really you may have had all this\npent up anger towards your partner over\nother things and chose to let that anger\nout over your annoyance with the gum the\ntruth is you may have some deeper\nproblems to sort out in your\nrelationship or you simply don't like\neach other anymore ask yourself this\nwhat is it that I don't like about my\npartner do I like them at all anymore if\nyou and your partner have been acting\ndistant rude disrespectful or annoying\nto each other including being\nchronically irritated then you may\nsimply not like each other anymore and\nit might be time to move on number three\nthey have no respect for you respect is\nfoundational for a good successful\nrelationship and if you don't respect\nyour partner or if your partner doesn't\nrespect you it's time to get out of the\nrelationship common behaviors that show\ndisrespect are lying cheating and name\ncalling and we don't mean using pet\nnames kind of name calling you and your\npartner should not be insulting each\nother in using name calling to belittle\neach other ask them how they feel have a\nconversation find out what's going on in\ntheir head and if they do in fact have\nrespect for you they better show they do\nall you're asking is for a little\nrespect sing\n[Music]\nit yeah that's right you got this number\nfour they're selfish and make everything\nabouts El it's totally normal to gloat\nevery once in a while on your success\nand expect praise from your supportive\nand loving partner but if your partner\nnever has time for you in return boy\nthat's a problem if your partner is\nselfish they only have time to talk\nabout themselves all the time what about\nyou do you think Jack only talked about\nhimself on the Titanic while Rose sat\nthere listening no they talked about\nboth of each other's lives do you think\nJack just would have let Rose drink down\nand keep the floating door all to\nhimself no he let Rose have the door to\nfloat on uh wait does that mean Rose is\nselfish it couldn't carry both their\nweight okay the thing is if they make\nthings all about themselves all the time\nleaving little room for you then it's\ntime to move on from the relationship\nnumber five you've drifted apart and no\nlonger want the same things if you no\nlonger have a strong connection with\neach other and on top of that no longer\nwant the same things in life it may be\ntime time to move on people change and\ngrow and you both may have become\nsomeone different from when you first\nmet each other and that's okay and it's\nperfectly normal but it's time to assess\nwhether or not you both hold the same\nvalues and goals are you both still\ncompatible can you see each other\ntogether in 5 years or 10 years and\nnumber six you're the one who puts in\nall the effort perhaps you weren't\nfeeling the strong connection you once\nhad with your partner does that mean you\nshould give up in your eyes never so you\nput your all into the relationship\nyou're going to salvage this Bond you\nhad with your partner and build up that\nconnection again but you're the only one\ntrying and you're trying too hard\nbecause they're not helping if you find\nthat your partner simply doesn't care\nabout you enough to make things work\nthen it's time to move on you shouldn't\nbe the only one putting the effort into\nthe relationship as much as you don't\nwant to as much as you promised you\nwouldn't let go\nask yourself what did Rose do I'll never\nlet go she let go she let go hey but\ndon't worry your heart will go on did\nyou relate to any of these signs\nmentioned in the video let us know in\nthe comments below please like and share\nthis video If it helped you and you\nthink it could help someone else too"
