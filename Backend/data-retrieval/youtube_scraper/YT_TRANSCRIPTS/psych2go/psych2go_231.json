    "transcript": "the Lone Wolf personality can be so\nirresistible we see examples of this\ntype of person in the media all of the\ntime such as James Bond or Bruce Wayne\nwho epitomize the archetype of an\nenigmatic Sigma personality but why are\nyou so attracted to a lone wolf well\nwatch the rest of the video and find out\nmysterious the Lone Wolf carries an aura\nof mystery anywhere they go that can be\nirresistibly attractive to those on the\noutside their cutting gaze is a window\nto their soul only a select few get to\nsee and can be intoxicating once they\nlet you in think Edward Cullen or even\nmesmerizing JK from BTS we know you Psy\ntoo as have a crush but what is the\nAllure of mystery the answer is Intrigue\nwhen you meet a person and they don't\nautomatically show as much interest in\nyou it can leave you wondering and in\nsearch of an explan ation it's just a\nnatural part of the human condition in\nan article for psychology today\nresearcher Aon wurch explains that\npeople who create uncertainty about how\nmuch they like someone can increase that\nperson's interest in them look at it\nthis way uncertainty breeds Intrigue\nbecause the less you know the more you\nwonder and the more you think about that\nperson until you find an\nanswer confident the lonewolf\npersonality never seeks a approval from\nothers it's what makes them who they are\nthis type of Personality finds\nfulfillment and validation from within\nwhich usually inspires them to be\ncreative and Innovative on their own\nterms this is why rebellious and\ncharismatic characters in films and\ntelevision tend to be the most popular\nbecause most people are attracted to\nsomeone who knows what they want and\nmost importantly who they are the Lone\nWolf is adept at staying true to\nthemselves and handling social\nsituations with ease because they have\nnothing to prove to anyone the lone\nWolf's non-conforming attitude and\nconviction for their own thoughts and\nopinions is the powerful reason that\ntheir confidence is irresistible to\nthose on the\noutside independent freethinking and\nfree-spirited the Lone Wolf can think\nfor themselves and doesn't need a second\nopinion to execute their actions they\nrarely ask others for help or assistance\nbecause they're self-sufficient instead\nsaid they prefer to learn how to do\nsomething themselves rather than ask\nsomeone to do it for them according to\nDr Phyllis Moro a researcher and\nself-identified Lone Wolf lone wolves\nvalue their autonomy and may resist\nAuthority or group dynamics restricting\ntheir freedom this desire for\nIndependence sets them apart from others\nbecause they don't require the same\ndegree of validation from others look at\nit this way if the rest of us are like\ncoldblooded animals that need an outside\nenvironment to to Keep Us Alive the Lone\nWolf personality is a warm-blooded\nanimal that needs nothing and no one to\nthrive and\nsurvive observant and emotionally\nintelligent the Lone Wolf notices things\nthat almost everyone else overlooks they\ndon't talk as much but they sure do\nlisten this powerful skill is attractive\nfor several reasons but the main reason\nis that it demonstrates the depth of\ntheir thoughts and understanding of the\nworld around them the the truth is those\nwho talk less and listen more tend to be\nmore emotionally intelligent in many\nways such as demonstrating higher levels\nof empathy and compassion for others\naccording to psychologist Daniel Goldman\nbeing observant is linked to higher\nemotional intelligence because those who\npossess these qualities can easily read\nwhat's going on in most social\nsituations and group dynamics which\nenables them to understand other people\nat a deeper level this attractive\nquality makes others gravitate towards\nthe Lone Wolf personality because those\naround them feel like they're being seen\nand understood at a higher frequency\nwe're looking at you keano Reeves\nanalytical nothing gets past Al Lone\nWolf their highly analytical minds are\nalways busy dissecting even the most\nminute of details and possibilities this\ngoes hand inand with their strong\ncritical thinking skills and their deep\ncuriosity for understanding the world\naround them their analytical Talent is\nwhat drives their pensent for Innovation\nrisk-taking and problem solving even in\ndifficult situations this Talent also\nallows them to excel in everything they\nput their minds to because they always\nseem to be one step ahead of everyone\nelse because they just never stop\nthinking who comes to mind when you\nthink of this maybe Steve Jobs The Bold\nand Innovative risk taker who created\nthe iPhone or Elon Musk the\ncontroversial CEO of SpaceX you get the\npicture the Lone Wolf is bold Brave and\nnever afraid to take enormous risks so\nwhat do you guys think are you a lone\nwolf if you enjoyed this video then you\nmight also like five signs you
