    "transcript": "what is Love An age- Old question that\ncountless poets artists writers\nmusicians and even scientists have tried\nto answer for centuries but the simple\ntruth is love means something different\nfor everyone and yet we all just know it\nwhen we feel it right well maybe not\nbecause unlike every other emotion that\ncomes and goes we tend to put more\nmeaning into love than we probably\nshould the most common example of this\nis when we let that fleeting feeling of\nattraction or fness for someone blind us\nfrom all the red flags in our\nrelationship saying otherwise according\nto therapist and dating coach Kelsey\nWonderland healthy love requires three\nthings love the emotion itself\ncompatibility and attachment so while\nyou can feel love for someone even\nwithout the rest of these things this\ndoesn't necessarily mean that it's\nhealthy love it could simply be\nattachment and we can get attached to\nanyone even when they're not good for us\nso how can can we know the difference\nwell here are six psychology backed\nsigns one coping with conflict when a\nrelationship is just about attachment\nespecially the unhealthy kind it's\nlikely that you develop maladaptive ways\nof coping with conflict in an article by\nDr Karen soski and Christen kenen some\nexamples of this include codependency\nwhen you cope with Conflict by simply\nrefusing to disagree with the other\nperson manipulation such as the cold\nshoulder or withholding affection and a\ngeneral power and balance in the\nrelationship brought about by one\nparty's need for power and control\nnumber two consistency going back to\nwhat Dr Kelsey Wonderland stated we can\nfeel an attachment towards anyone so the\nkey to telling the difference between\nlove and attachment is consistency is\nthe relationship consistently fulfilling\ndo you both consistently engage in\npositive relationship maintenance\nbehaviors such as spending quality time\ntogether verbal affection physical\naffection emotional intimacy because if\nnot it's possible that the love you\nthink you feel for this person could\njust be a product of your attachment\ntowards them you've just gotten so used\nto one another or you feel like you\ndon't have any better options number\nthree a feeling of safety another\ncrucial difference between love and\nattachment Dr Wonderland tells us is if\nthe relationship creates a feeling of\nsafety for everyone involved if this\nperson judges you for your body your\npast your goals and so on then it's not\na healthy love because according to two\nleading experts in relationship\npsychology doctors John and Julie gotman\ncriticism is one of the quickest ways to\nruin relationships it makes us more\ndefensive and hostile towards one\nanother and it takes away that feeling\nof safety we need in a relationship to\nallow for a deeper sense of connection\nintimacy Mutual acceptance and healthy\nlove if you find this video relatable\nand helpful please give the video a\nthumbs up and subscribe to the channel\nhealthy boundaries in his book\nboundaries and relationships knowing\nprotecting and enjoying the self Dr\nCharles Whitfield tells us that having\nhealthy personal boundaries is key to\nnurturing a strong and loving\nrelationship one that's built on a\nfoundation of mutual trust respect\ngenuiness and care some of Dr\nwhitfield's examples of when our\nboundaries are being disrespected\ninclude when others try to control or\nmanipulate us when they purposefully\nhurt or harm us when they don't take no\nfor an answer and when they tell us what\nto do or how to feel which brings us to\nour next Point validating needs whether\nsomeone validates or invalidates your\nneeds is a pretty good indicator of the\nquality of your relationship with them\nbut one we may not always be aware of\nthink back to the last time you shared\nsome vulnerable feelings or concerns\nwith another person did they respond\nwith empathy support and understanding\nor did they try to minimize your\nfeelings judge you for what you shared\nor disregarded entirely the latter is\nsomething psychologists call emotional\ninvalidation and according to psychology\nwriter Britney Caro it can often lead to\nfeelings of worthlessness and isolation\nas well as feelings of distrust and\ninsecurity in the relationship it's when\nyou don't have the confidence to share\nyour feelings or are afraid that your\npartner will invalidate your feelings\nand number six added value finally but\nperhaps most importantly healthy love\nshould add value and meaning to your\nlife unlike mere attachment psychologist\nElaine Hatfield who's often credited as\none of the pioneers of the scientific\nstudy of Love along with professor and\nhistorian Richard rapson wrote that\nanything that makes adults feel as\nhelpless and dependent as when they were\nchildren increases their passionate\ncraving to merge with others in simpler\nterms unhealthy attachment Styles\ninvolving low self-esteem issues with\ndependency and insecurity anxiety and\nneediness are the most likely reasons\nwhy some people often mistake unhealthy\nattachment for love healthy love on the\nother hand gives us a feeling of being\nunderstood and accepted feeling safe and\nsecure as well as a strong sense of\nbelonging and a significant improvement\nin our overall well-being so do you\nrelate to any of the things we've\nmentioned here did these psychology\nbacked signs help you better\ndifferentiate between love and\nattachment if you've been struggling to\nleave the relationship you're unhappy in\nthinking but I love them is a good\nenough reason it might be good to\nconsider if it's just the attachment\nyou're actually feeling in"
