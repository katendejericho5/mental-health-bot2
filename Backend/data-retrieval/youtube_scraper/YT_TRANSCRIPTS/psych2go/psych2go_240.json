    "transcript": "experts agree that we all manipulate at\ntimes sometimes we do it for the good of\nthe people or situation and sometimes we\ndo it for egoic reasons nevertheless\nmanipulation isn't malignant until it is\nused with the intention of controlling\nor bringing another person down but why\nwould someone want to do this in this\nvideo we will discuss five main reasons\nwhy people manipulate others and a few\nexamples of exactly how they may do it\npower manipulative people often use\ncoercive control in order to gain power\nover their partner in a relationship but\nwhat exactly is coercive control an\narticle in medical news today explains\nthat coercive control refers to a\npattern of controlling behaviors that\ncreate an unequal power dynamic in a\nrelationship a perpetrator uses coercive\ncontrol to gain control and power by\neroding a person's autonomy and\nself-esteem this can include acts of\nintimidation threats and humiliation\nsays an article in medical news today a\nmanipulator may do this by monitoring\ntheir their partner's activities an\nexample of this could be putting cameras\nin the home and not letting the partner\nhave free access to their finances it\ncan also look like isolating the other\nperson from friends and family insulting\nthem breaking their confidence making\nthreats and intimidation the manipulator\nmay also use sexual coion they may even\ninvolve pets and children which they\neither threaten or turn against their\npartner coercive control is an emotional\nand mental type of abusive Behavior it\nis considered a form of domestic abuse\nor intimate partner violence if you or\nanyone you know is living under similar\ncircumstances depicted here please get\nhelp as soon as possible from a\nprofessional evasion when it comes to\navoiding blame or Consequences the\nmanipulator is trying to avoid changing\nthe behavior that has benefited them in\nthe past and kept them in control\nexplains mangi Holland a licensed\ncounselor in an article for psych\nCentral according to Harley therapy\ncounseling blog other reasons\nmanipulators try to avoid blame or\nConsequences are they don't have to take\non the responsibility and work that\ntaking the blame entails they don't have\nto be vulnerable or seen as weak they\ncan retain control and opt out of\nlistening or doing things that are out\nof their control like the other person's\nside of the story they unload their\nself-restricted feelings when they blame\nit protects their ego by putting them in\na superior seat and being deemed the\ngood guy low\nself-esteem low self-esteem can make a\nperson do any number of things from\ntrying to always please others to trying\nto put themselves above others the bad\nperception some people have of\nthemselves makes them feel jealous of\nothers which can push them into wanting\nto take control of the situation by\nputting others down American\nPsychological Association fellow Michael\nsolom PhD told the Huffington Post\npeople who have a poor self-image and\nsuffer from insecurity get a false sense\nof power and control in their lives by\ntaking advantage of their friends and\nfamily their sense of control is\nrestored when they begin manipulating\nother people with success but that\nsuccess is shortlived as eventually the\nother people become tired and leave\naccording to Nadia Baki a journalist and\neditor who identifies herself as a\nmaster manipulator in an article on she\nsaid personality disorder people with\nnarcissistic personality disorder or\nantisocial personality disorder commonly\nknown as sociopathy and psychopathy have\nmanipulation ingrained in them many with\nthe disorder may know they are\nmanipulating others and do it anyways\nbecause they lack empathy and others\ndon't know that they're doing it Nadia\nBaki who is also a media commentator\nexplains in her article titled six signs\nyour partner is a manipulative person\nthat manipulation is so entrenched in my\npersonality I'm often unaware I'm even\ndoing it until the dust has settled it's\nunsurprisingly been the undoing of most\nof my relationships while some try to\ncorrect this manipulation others don't\nfor that reason if you ever find\nyourself in a relationship with a\nnarcissist or a person suffering from an\nantisocial personality disorder experts\nrecommend that you distance yourself\nfrom them because many times it's not\nsomething they can control or want to\ncontrol fear another thing that author\nBak discusses is her fear of Abandonment\nfear is often one of the main reasons\npeople manipulate as manipulation is a\nway to either bate that fear or keep\nwhat they fear at Bay they do this\nbecause they see what they fear as a\nthreat to their personal well-being and\nas a threat to their sense of control\ngood therapy states that people may\nengage a manipulation out of fear\nespecially fear of Abandonment this\noften happens during breakups or\nrelationship fights relationships are\nthe biggest trigger for these fears as\ntotal control of another person is not\ntruly achievable and people's actions\ncan be unexpected if you ever find\nyourself in a relationship that shows\nthese manipulative signs or others but\nyou're not sure seek out help and look\nto your family and friends for support\noften times mental and emotional abuse\ncan lead to other types of abuse like\nFinancial abuse and physical abuse we\nit's like to go want you healthy and\nsafe so we recommend getting help from a\nmental health professional was
