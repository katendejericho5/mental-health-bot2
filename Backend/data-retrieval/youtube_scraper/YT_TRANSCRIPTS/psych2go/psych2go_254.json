being around\nothers all the time they might have huge\nfriend groups or be at parties every\nFriday night you might be wondering how\nare they able to do that do you find it\ndifficult to be around others even if\nyou just can't put your finger on why if\nso here are five reasons why you might\nnot like being other people you surround\nyourself the wrong people you might not\nlike being around most people but is it\nreally everyone perhaps it has something\nto do with the people you surround\nyourself with there might be a group of\npeople that you typically hang out with\nbut at your core don't truly like\nwhether it's because their morals or\nbeliefs don't align with yours you feel\nlike people aren't being genuine or\nbecause you simply don't have anything\nin common with them being with the wrong\ncrowd may have led you to believe that\nyou don't like being around people are\nyou still friends with people because\nyou feel obligated to or because you\ngenuinely like them and want to spend\nmore time with them if it's the former\nthen it might be a sign that you should\nstart hanging around new people stress\nsometimes Stress and Anxiety can cause\nus to dislike being presence of others\naccording to research at the Dartmouth\nsocial Neuroscience lab people who\nexperienced more stress on one day\nsocialized with others less the next day\nif you've been frequently stressed\nwhether it's because of assignment a job\nor anything it might be contributing to\nyour social avoidance and withdrawal\nfrom interactions with other people\nstress can be a big factor in a lot of\nmental health conditions according to\nDartmouth assistant professor Megan\nMeyer you're stressed and withdraw\nsocially as a response you may be\nmissing the opportunity of using social\ninteractions to mitigate your mental\nhealth issues especially during a time\nwhen you did the most after all we\nhumans are social creatures you're an\nintrovert while this one might be a\nlittle obvious is there are a lot of\nmisconceptions about introverts simply\nnot liking other people for introverts\nbeing around others can be draining and\nthere could be a biological reason for\nit a study in the Journal of cognitive\nNeuroscience found that introverts\nprocess social stimuli in the brain\ndifferently from extroverts when exposed\nto images of human faces extroverted\npeople were associated with having 300\nbrain waves with higher amplitudes the\nstudy also found that extroverts were\nmore sensitive or attentive to and found\ngreater motivational value in Social\nstim\nintroverts introverts tend to keep to\nthemselves a lot more often than their\nextroverted counterparts after a certain\ntime their social battery runs out which\nis when being around others can be\ntiresome the study might explain why for\nintroverts being around other people\nmight not provide as much value as for\nextroverts making them prefer being\nalone more with other people you're a\nhighly sensitive person according to\npsychology today a highly sensitive\nperson HSP is someone sensitive to\nsensory processing processing and\nincreased emotional sensitivity or\nreactivity to external and internal\nstimuli it's estimated that 15 to 20% of\nthe population are hsps you're an HSP\nyou might find it difficult to be around\nothers because there's so much\ninformation to process the conversations\nactions or even emotions of other people\nbe overwhelming issues with processing\nmight even make you upset in social\nsituations for instance being around too\nmany people can lead you to feel over\nstimulated or overwhelmed even able or\nanxious sensory processing sensitivity\nis not something that can simply be\nswitched off which is why hsps might\navoid overly social settings ey\nintelligence research suggests that\nhighly intelligent people actually\nprefer to be alone instead of around\nothers in a paper published in the\nBritish Journal of Psychology by Lee and\nkazawa it was discovered that highly\nintelligent people experience lower life\nsatisfaction when they socialize more\noften with friends these findings were\nbased in evolutionary psychology in\ngroups the more intelligent members were\nable to solve problems without needing\nhelp from their friends and are happier\nbeing alone to solve challenges on their\nown Solitude is a way for highly\nintelligent people to reset themselves\nafter being in highly stressful Urban\nenvironments still even though highly\nintelligent people might feel like they\ndon't benefit as much from friendships\nstill might socialize just as much or\neven more often than last intelligent\npeople this isn't to say that highly\nintelligent people don't socialize but\nif you find yourself able to thrive and\nsolve problems better on your own it\nmight be one of the reasons why you\ndon't like being around others it's\nimportant to understand why some people\nmay not enjoy being around others and\nnot shame them for it which one of these\nreasons resonates with you the most are\nthere multiple that you relate to let us\nknow in the comments we hope that you\nfound this
