    "transcript": "[Music]\nin the movie The Pursuit of Happiness\nChris Gardner goes from living on the\nstreets with his son to owning a\nmulti-million dollar stock broker firm\nhow mindset through all of the struggles\nhe faces Chris remains determined and\nnever gives up on creating a better life\nfor himself and his son this is the\npower of mindset\nafter watching today's video you'll have\nnew tools to help you shift your mindset\nbecome the best version of yourself and\nfeel fulfilled so here are three\npowerful mindset shifts that will change\nyour life\nnumber one\nthe abundance mindset let's start with a\nword of advice from brene Brown a\nrenowned author in the self-help space\nand a research professor at the\nUniversity of Houston we can't ask\npeople to give us something that we\nbelieve we are not worthy of receiving\ndo you believe that you're worthy of\nreceiving the things you want in life\nwhether it's building a successful\ncareer or having fulfilling\nrelationships opening yourself up to New\nOpportunities and believing that you are\nworthy of them can be life-changing\na powerful way to do this is to build an\nabundance mindset in his popular book\nThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective\nPeople Stephen Covey described the\nabundance mindset and the scarcity\nmindset if you have an abundance mindset\nyou believe there's room for everyone to\nsucceed and you're grateful for what you\nhave on the other hand if you have a\nscarcity mindset you're focused on what\nyou lack you believe there are limited\nresources and only room for some people\nto win\nto build an abundance mindset practice\ngratitude daily you can become more\ncontent with your life and focus on\nworking towards your goals rather than\nstressing about what you don't have\nreflect on what you're grateful for and\nfocus on the amazing things that are\nhappening in your life even just the\nfact that you woke up today is something\nto celebrate you might even form better\nrelationships with your friends or\nco-workers because when you believe that\nthere is enough to go around for\neveryone there's no room left for being\njealous or bitter when you see other\npeople win also try to be cooperative\ninstead of competitive when possible as\nOprah said if you look at what you have\nin life you'll always have more if you\nlook at what you don't have in life\nyou'll never have enough\nnumber two the growth mindset let's do a\nmini quiz to see what type of mindset\nyou currently have which statement do\nyou agree with more a my skills can be\ndeveloped with time and effort or B my\nskills are innate and can't be changed\nor improved\nif you agree with a you probably have\nwhat is called a growth mindset if you\nagree with B you probably have a fixed\nmindset these terms were originally\ncoined by psychologist Carl dweck people\nwho have a growth mindset believe that\nif they work hard enough they can\ndevelop their intelligence talents and\nabilities people with a fixed mindset\nbelieve that everyone is born with\ncertain abilities some people are\nnaturally good at things others aren't\nand there's nothing we can do to change\nit\nshifting to a growth mindset can greatly\nimprove your well-being and quality of\nlife this is because people with a\ngrowth mindset have an internal locus of\ncontrol in other words you believe that\nyou have control of your life as opposed\nto believing that your life is\ncontrolled by external factors\na study conducted by researchers alacha\nand Suri showed that having an internal\nlocus of control is positively linked to\nseveral well-being factors including\nself-acceptance purpose in life and\npersonal growth a growth mindset can\nhelp you feel encouraged that you can\ngrow and improve with time and effort\ncatch yourself when you're having\ndiscouraging thoughts like things will\nnever change for me or I'm inherently\nbad at this and I'll never be good at it\nand if no one else has told you today\npsych2goers we are here to tell you that\nyou can achieve anything you put your\nmind to We Believe In You\nnumber three progress over Perfection\nwould you consider yourself to be a\nperfectionist maybe you try to make sure\nthat everything is 100 Flawless and\ndon't feel comfortable submitting an\nassignment or work project or sometimes\neven sending a text before it's perfect\nyou have a huge fear of making mistakes\nthis slows you down because you spend so\nmuch time perfecting things if you can\nrelate this quote by Cheryl Sandberg\nformer CEO of Facebook might help you\nshift your mindset done is better than\nperfect\nthe idea behind this mindset isn't that\nyou should stop putting in any effort or\nsubmit low quality work rather when\nyou're working towards a goal it's\nbeneficial to shift your mindset from\nPerfection to progress focus on enjoying\nand learning from the process\nyou might find that you're a lot happier\nand more productive when you have this\nmindset because you're not spending a\nton of time stressing to ensure the\noutcome is perfect besides mistakes\naren't failures they're opportunities to\nlearn\nwe hope this video helped you learn\nabout the power of mindset and reflect\non your own thoughts and beliefs\nremember that mindset shifts don't work\nwithout action you can't just change\nyour mindset without changing anything\nelse in your life and expect results\nacting on your positive mindset is what\ncreates real change did this video help\nyou recognize any beliefs that aren't\nserving you
