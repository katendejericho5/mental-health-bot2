conform and Obey some\nparents believe that they need their\nchildren to mindlessly conform to all of\ntheir expectations and obey everything\nthey say otherwise it's a grave sign of\ndisrespect but having such strict and\nauthoritarian parents often takes away\nfrom a child's sense of Independence and\ncreates a stressful environment for them\ngrowing up according to an article\npublished by the Michigan State\nUniversity\nthis parenting style tends to worsen\nbehavioral problems and Lead children to\nbecoming either more aggressive or\nsubmissive socially inept indecisive and\nhave poor\nself-esteem rigid need for Perfection\nare you terrified of making even the\ntiniest mistake do you instinctively lie\nor make excuses to try to get out of it\nif so it's likely that you do this as a\ncoping mechanism from the excessive\nscolding you received from your parents\nas a child over any mistake mistake you\nmade making mistakes is an integral part\nof a child's learning and growth\nexplains developmental psychologist Dr\nMarilyn price Mitchell so when children\nare given the freedom to do this they\naren't able to test their resilience and\nbuild their self-esteem based on their\nability to bounce back and learn from\ntheir failures you are essentially\nraised to believe that nothing short of\nabsolute perfection is expected of you\nwhich leads you to becoming extremely\nanxious risk averse and have no sense of\ninitiative or open to experience afraid\nof own dreams and goals last but\ncertainly not least if you're afraid to\nshare your goals with other people or\ndream up a big future for yourself then\nthat's a red flag that your self-esteem\nwas most likely destroyed during\nchildhood because childhood is when we\nlearn to dream and Aspire if you grew up\nwith parents who ridiculed invalidated\nor chastised you for it saying your\ndreams were unrealistic impractical or\nirrelevant then you most likely felt\nthat you needed to settle for the safe\nand ordinary life your parents wanted\nfor you studies such as the one by Wendy\ngrolnick in\n2016 professor of psychology at Clark\nUniversity have shown that a person's\nsuccess is strongly linked with the time\nsupport and encouragement their parents\ngave them which made them feel confident\nin themselves and internally motivated\nto succeed so what are your thoughts on\nthis video do

your strengths and\nachievements practicing positive\nthinking and positive selft talk making\na habit of things that make you feel\ngood like dressing well eating healthy\nand exercising doing more
