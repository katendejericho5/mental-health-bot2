    "transcript": "there has been a huge decline in mental\nhealth around the world which is why\nwe're so committed to creating more\ncontent than we ever have thanks for\nbeing a part of our journey do you know\nwhat it means to have a trauma bond with\nsomeone most people would wrongly assume\nthat this means bonding with someone\nover shared trauma but actually trauma\nbonding is a defining characteristic of\nmany toxic and abusive relationships and\nit's often the main reason why we might\nfind ourselves unable to leave them a\ntrauma Bond refers to the deep emotional\nattachment one might feel towards their\nabuser and it's more likely to develop\nin those who have a history of abuse\nexploitation or emotional codependency\nin their past relationships trauma bonds\ncan easily be mistaken for feelings of\nlove and commitment towards another\nperson so with that said here are some\nsigns to look out for that tell you if\nit's not actually love that you're\nexperiencing but a trauma Bond number\none the other person is outwardly\nCharming of course if given the choice\nno one would willingly choose to pursue\na relationship with someone who acts\nabusive towards them the problem is\nhowever the toxic relationships don't\nstart out that way and it's usually only\nwhen you've already experienced the\nabuse that you start to realize\nsomething is wrong you might develop a\ntrauma bond with someone if they are\noutwardly Charming sweet caring and seem\ntrustworthy to you but don't be fooled\nthere might be something more Sinister\nlurking beneath it all number two they\nare emotionally unpredictable you might\nbe asking self why don't people just\nleave the relationships once they\nrealize that it's unhealthy for them but\nthe trouble is it's a lot harder to spot\ntrauma bonding when it's up close and\npersonal compared to if you just saw it\nhappening to someone else this is\nbecause abusive Partners can often be\nemotionally manipulative too they might\nabuse you and devalue you only to shower\nyou with kindness apologies and Promises\nto change the next day this serves as\npositive reinforcement to make you\nsecond guess any thoughts you might have\nhave of leaving them number three they\ntend to take their problems out on you\nthink back to the last time this partner\nfriend or family member heard some bad\nnews or encountered a problem how do\nthey usually deal with it do they often\nlash out take it out on you even when\nyou've done nothing wrong they could be\nkeeping you around as their\npsychological punching bag and you\ndeserve better than that number four\nthey isolate you from your loved ones\nsome people might think it's sweet to\nhave someone someone who wants them all\nto themselves and gets jealous of those\nyou spend your time with but there's a\ndifference between loving someone so\nmuch you want them around all the time\nand actively working to isolate them\nfrom the other important relationships\nin their lives does this person get mad\nat you for spending time with anyone who\nisn't them do they try to control who\nyou're with or ask you to distance\nyourself from your friends and family if\nthe answer is yes then that's as clear a\nred flag as any number five you deny or\nminimize their abusive Behavior now\nlet's look at all the ways the trauma\nBond might affect you and your behavior\noften times the most telling sign that\nyou're in a destructive relationship is\nif you find yourself constantly trying\nto deny or minimize the other person's\nwrongdoings we look past all their\nmistreatment towards us and minimize the\nabuse by saying things like oh it's not\nthat bad really or I don't mind it\nbecause in the moment it's easier for us\nto just brush it off instead of\nconfronting what might be a terrible\nharsh reality that the person you're\nwith is abusing you number six you\nconstantly make excuses for them the\nmoment you can no longer deny or\nminimize what the other person has done\nand a family member or friend says\nsomething like what they did to you is\nnot okay don't let them treat you like\nthat you're still most likely going to\ntry to make excuses for them and come to\ntheir defense at times you might even\nfind yourself feeling like you deserve\nve their mistreatment once you start\nthinking like this that is a critical\nsign that you are in a trauma Bond and\nnot a loving relationship number seven\nyou're becoming more and more\nemotionally numb have you noticed\nyourself feeling less and less lately\nlike you're detached and emotionally\nnumb you might be feeling this way\nbecause subconsciously it's your mind's\nway of coping with all of the abuse that\nit's had to deal with from the person\nyou're trauma bonded to you can't take\nany more pain fear anger or heartache so\ninstead you close yourself off from all\nof your emotions you're not as vibrant\ntalkative or expressive as you used to\nbe and they're the reason why and number\neight you're hiding aspects of your\nrelationship from others finally but\nperhaps most importantly if you start to\nhide certain aspects of your\nrelationship from those around you then\nyou know that there's definit itely\nsomething wrong because why else would\nyou actively try to cover up how bad\nthings are getting between you two\nloyalty towards an abusive
