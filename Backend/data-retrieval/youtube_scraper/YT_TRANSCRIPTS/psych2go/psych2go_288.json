    "transcript": "hello and welcome to beyond the\ndiagnosis a podcast that features\nstories of people with lived experiences\nas a patient or\ncaregiver I'm your host Monica a\nneuroscience graduate in current medical\nstudent in\nCanada today's story centers around a\nhighly impactful neurological\ndisease according to Alzheimer's disease\nInternational there's an estimated 55\nmillion people worldwide living with\ndementia and this number is set to\nrise but its true impact extends Beyond\njust the person with dementia but also\nto their family members and their\ncaregivers so with effects this profound\nI believe it's our priority to discuss\nsome of the Unseen challenges and to\nalso provide some resources to support\ndementia Care Partners\nso I had the very memorable opportunity\nto hear from a dementia care partner\nherself Miss\nWebster not only does she bring lived\nexpertise she's also a certified\ndementia care consultant and the founder\nand ambassador of the dementia education\nprogram at McGill\nUniversity welcome Miss\nWebster thank you for having\nme thank you so much for joining me I\njust remember back in Med 1 Med 2 when I\nfirst heard of your story it was so\nimpactful it stuck to me even though\nsome years have passed now so I'm very\ngrateful that you're here to share your\nstory and to share some insights about\nbeing a dementia care partner so I\nthought for those who might not be\nfamiliar yet could you please speak to\nwhat is dementia and how does that\ndiffer from Alzheimer's disease dementia\nis really an umbrella term similar to\ncancer being an umbrella term it's\nreally a complex condition that affects\ncognitive functions including memory\ncommunication decision-making as well as\nour activities of daily living and there\nare different types of diseases that\ncause dementia the most common ones are\ncalled Alzheimer's disease vascular\ndementia Louis body dementia frontal\ntemporal dementia among others so with\nso many intricacies that could be\ninvolved I wonder whether you could also\nspeak to some of the appearances that\nyou have been through as a dementia care\npartner well a lot of people think that\ndementia equals memory loss and while in\nfact it does impact the memory um it it\nhas there are very there's a whole bunch\nof different symptoms that present so\nfor example uh so persistent meor memory\nloss so memory loss that will impact uh\ndaily life um constantly forgetting\npeople's names constantly forgetting\nwhat time it is appointments that type\nof thing challenges with problem solving\nso like specifically with regards to\nfollowing instructions following recipes\npaying bills um lots of confusion with\ntime and place so you know thinking that\nit's nighttime when it's it's when it's\nstill only the afternoon or waking up at\n2 o'clock in the morning thinking it's\ntime to start the day forgetting the\ndays of the week um it really impacts a\nperson's language and communication so\nas a disease progresses people start to\nforget words you know commonly used\nwords\num in my case for example my mother was\nFinnish and she would start mixing up\nFinnish and English in the same sentence\nso and as progresses more and more they\nreally have hard time uh putting\ntogether uh sentences lack of judgment\num you know we're we're we're today\nwe're exposed with all kinds of uh\nfraudulent emails and phone calls and\neven healthy people sometimes have a\nhard time differentiating but it's it's\nreally the loss of judgment a loss of\njudgment with regards to even sometimes\ngetting Dr dress so if it's in the\nsummertime people may be dressing like\nit's in the winter time um and then what\nI mentioned earlier it could also cause\na significant change in a person's\npersonality and moods um you know\nsomebody that might have been very\nmild-mannered uh becomes extremely\naggressive um you know it has an impact\non on how people could react verbally\nusing words that they would have never\nused before uh becoming physically\naggressive at times um and then just\ndifficulty completing like everyday\ntasks be what we call our activities of\ndaily living so being able to get\ndressed being able to just prepare a\nregular meal as I mentioned earlier\ndoing your banking grooming and and then\nfinally it also because of all of these\ndifferent factors it often causes people\nuh to become more socially isolated they\nbecome overwhelmed like everything makes\nthem feel overwhelmed conversations make\nthem feel overwhelmed so they become\nsocially isolated and what's challenging\nwith with with the symptoms is that\nthere there are too many public\nawareness campaigns out there right now\nif we look on a global scale about\ndementia and so um it it could often be\nconfused as somebody being depressed it\ncould often be confused as somebody\nbeing uh taking drugs uh being drunk um\nunder the influence of different things\nbut um because there are so many little\nsymptoms that present that people really\ndon't know uh you know what what's going\non with the person because you mentioned\nthings like personality changes things\nlike memory loss how does this present\nkind of temporally in terms of\nprogression okay so so really the\nbeginning it really affects a person\nperson's cognitive skills so that\nexactly at the beginning it'll be\neverything to do with you'll see changes\nin their personality changes in their\nmood slight changes in their memory so\nfrom outward appearances they look fine\nand that's what's hard for family\nmembers or for colleagues or friends I\nremember with my mom one of her friends\nwould say to me but your mother she\nlooks fine there's nothing wrong with\nher because outwardly she still looked\nvery very good however the way the\ndisease progresses is that over time it\nreally starts to impact the activities\nof daily living so at the beginning\nagain it's very cognitive they may be\nrepeating themselves over and over again\nbut they're still able to get up and get\ndressed and some of them can people can\nstill drive cook Etc But as time goes on\nall of those tasks\nstart to become uh affected so then you\nstart people start noticing slowly that\nH they're not taking their shower every\nday uh they're not maybe putting on the\nmakeup they're wearing the same clothes\nall the time they're they're they're not\npreparing their meals um they're they're\nhaving difficulty managing their bills\nuh they're forgetting to pay bills their\nhandwriting might start to change and as\nas the disease progresses more and more\nyou really start seeing the toll it\ntakes on a person person physically so\ndementia itself is a terminal illness um\nyou know there are people who may have\npre-existing health conditions so you\ncould have a person that has dementia\nbut also has cancer heart disease\ndiabetes for which they may you know\npass away from one of those illnesses\nprior to dementia but if a person\ndoesn't have any pre-existing health\nconditions dementia itself is a terminal\nillness so as on as the the disease\nevolves it really has an impact on on\nthe on the person physically and\nessentially by the end the body starts\njust really starts to begin to shut down\nwhere they have more and more difficulty\nswallowing uh it have impacts their\nmobility and so at the end everything\njust begins to shut down it feels very\nit feels very sad to hear and I wonder\nif you could also speak to your\nexperience about like the whole\nemotional aspect of it throughout the\nprogression the impact the impact on on\non the care partner is really one of\nwhat we call anticipatory loss right so\nyou know when you receive this type of\ndiagnosis it's like any other you know\ndifficult diagnosis where you know\nunfortunately life becomes interrupted\nright it's a shock and so for the care\npartner you're you're constantly in a\nstate of grieving because at the\nbeginning there with all the changes\nthat are taking place with your family\nmemb communication I see especially with\nregards to couples for example where you\nknow you're sitting down having a meal\nyou're able to have these conversations\nand communicate that starts to disappear\nso you're you're starting to to mourn\nthe loss of these communication skills\nand the conversations but then as time\ngoes on what's so hard is you're\nwitnessing these physical changes and\nwhen I say physical CH changes the\nperson is really becoming more and more\nfrail right you start noticing how\nthey're not you know you have to be\ncareful how they walk you want to reduce\nthe risk of Falls you want to reduce the\nrisk of injury and you're witnessing the\ndecline and you know when you when you\nwere in my my class at Miguel you you\nknow I even show visuals of how the my\nmother her eyes right in terms of how\nshe's how she's looking at you like it's\nalmost as if she's she's disappearing\nright in front of your eyes um you know\nthere are other cases depending on the\ntype of dementia where a person could\nbecome very verbally and physically uh\naggressive and that becomes very hard\nbecause here once upon a time you had\nthis loving relationship with a person\nand then they become so verbally\naggressive towards you so there are all\nkinds of emotions uh that that that are\nare brought upon the the Care Partners\nas a result of this illness but sadness\nI have to say is probably one of the\nmost overriding emotions that we feel\nit's it's this sadness to constantly\nwitness this loss over you know a period\nof could be many years the anticipatory\nemotions that you mention I wonder\nwhether this ties into the idea of early\ndiagnosis and how perhaps that could\nhelp because I remember back in our\nlectures you mentioned that it's quite\ndifficult to get the person you're\ntaking care of to access the healthcare\nservice in the first place when you\nfirst notice some signs of dementia so\nhow do you initially advocate for a\nloved one who you suspect might have\ndementia with these challenges in mind\nokay so that question will have multiple\nanswers so the first the first part is\nit is important to try to get a\ndiagnosis as early as possible okay\nthat's that's important um because now\nare some new drugs that are coming out\non the market not available yet in\nCanada but soon to be that could could\nslow down the progression there is no\ncure but there are drugs that could\npotentially slow down the progression so\nthere is some hope but but in order for\nthese drugs to work they you have to be\ndiagnosed in the early stages the\nchallenge is as I mentioned earlier\nthere is no public awareness campaign\nand the majority of people do not\nrecognize the signs and symptoms so most\nof the time by the by the time you\nbrought your family M to see a doctor\nthe disease has already advanced quite a\nbit but by by having a diagnosis it it\nprovides the family with a bit of a\nsense of relief in in terms of saying\nokay there is there is in fact something\nwrong okay because prior to the\ndiagnosis you're really wondering like\nwhat's going on why are they behaving\nthis way so by naming it okay it does\nprovide some a sense of maybe I mean\nrelief is a difficult word to say but at\nleast here's the here's the here's the\nsituation and now how do we move forward\nright also a diagnosis is extremely\nimportant because as a disease\nprogresses it may bring on some\nresponsive behaviors where medications\nwould be needed so for example if the\nperson starts to become depressed or\nstarts to become aggressive anxious\nthere are medications that could manage\nall of that and again as a disease\nevolves and the person is no longer able\nto manage their finances or drive they\nthe family really needs to have a doctor\nsign off on a letter stating that the\nperson is becoming incapacitated you\nneed that for financial legal issues the\nother challenge however is is the fact\nthat the disease um brings forth another\nillness called anosognosia and\nanosognosia means that the person that\nis suffering these symptoms has a total\nloss of insight they are not aware at\nall that anything is wrong so the family\nmembers friends neighbors are seeing the\nchanges but the person themsel doesn't\nrecognize that there's anything wrong\nand that makes it hard because like in\nmy case I wanted to take my mom to see\nthe doctor when she didn't believe she\nneeded to see a doctor because she\ndidn't think anything was wrong so\nthat's always a very difficult step um\nyou know I I always suggest to families\nto use what I call a compassionate lie\nwhere you tell your loved one we are\nboth going for an annual physical\ncheckup to see the doctor we are both\ngoing to for a flu shop but we have to\nsee the doctor first for a checkup right\nso you've got to try to use a little bit\nof Tricks but with this illness um the\nthe the the pathway to getting a\ndiagnosis isn't always so clear because\nin some cases there are family doctors\nwho have the necessary training to be\nable to do a proper assessment in their\noffice so the so the families will leave\nwith an assessment then there are the\nfamily doctors who are unfortunately may\nhave not received the Education and\nTraining that they needed to do the\nassessment so what happens then is that\nthe family has to be referred to either\na geriatrician or a neurologist and so\nit's the the the Journey of getting that\ndiagnosis could be complex it's not just\nseeing one person and then knowing\nwhat's up and there are a few tests that\nalso have to be performed in order to\nget that proper assessment and finally I\nhave to say that what the doctor with\nprobably the information that is most\nimportant to the doctor is the is what\nthe family members are going to share\nthe signs and symptoms that were witne\nthat the family members Witness right so\nin addition to doing some perhaps scans\nand blood tests the the the doctor\nreally needs the family members to\narrive and and I would suggest be send\nthis list before the appointment okay\nbecause it's very hard to talk about a\nperson in front of the person when they\nhave\nanosognosia um but really what what what\nthe family members can share is is\nreally really key to doing an\nassessment I see so kind of just to\nsummarize it's from what I understand\nquite variable depending on the\nexperience of the practitioner\nthemselves for example a GP who is\nequipped to make the necessary\ninvestigations for dementia versus\nsomeone who is not which would lead to\nreferral and then from there you would\nstill need to help the loved one get the\ncare that they that they need yeah and\nand to do a proper assessment I mean it\ntakes about a good hour hour and a half\nand if you think about family doctors I\nmean you know the reality is they're\nsupposed to see you know six patients\nevery hour so that's 10 minutes per\npatient so it's very hard for a family\ndoctor to be able to conduct a true\nproper assessment like cognitive testing\nand all everything that they need you\nknow in in in a 10-minute time but\nthat's the Health Care System that's\nwhere it's going they want the family\ndoctors to be able to do more\nassessments but considering how many\npatients and the amount of time I don't\nknow how that that's possible to get\ntrue proper assessment so it really\nsounds like it's complex to make the\ndiagnosis and so a follow-up question\nthat I have regarding one point that you\nmentioned\nanosia the lack of awareness how does\nthen receiving a diagnosis impact the\npatient and also the care partner given\nthat they might not even be aware that\nthey could have\ndementia yeah that that could become\nvery challenging and um\nI was just I was just at a conversation\nwith Alzheimer's Society of Canada about\nthis before I'm talking to you but you\nknow first of all before making any type\nof um diagnosis the doctor has to be\nsure that there will not there's no\npotential for what we call a\ncatastrophic reaction on the patient's\nbehalf right so you don't want you want\nto make sure that the patient is able to\nreceive this type of diagnosis and that\ndoesn't happen after just one it should\nnot happen after one appointment myself\nI had one appointment and my my the\nneurologist announced to my mother that\nshe had Alzheimer's disease and she\nbecame Furious and she wasn't she wasn't\nable to accept it okay I have to be\nhonest so that's why it's very important\nthat when um you are going when there is\na doctor's appointment that the person\nbe accompanied by a family member you\nshould the person who is being assessed\nshould not be on their own\nbecause yes there are some people that\nare aware that there are changes\nhappening and that they're aware of you\nknow of of what's happening there's a\nbig stigma around the word Alzheimer's\ndisease or\ndementia um but it's it's very advisable\nthat um you always be accompanied with a\nfamily member because it it could come\nas a shock as as could the disclosure of\nany other you know difficult disease\nlike like cardiovascular illness or\ncancer right so uh people react\ndifferently and it really depends on\ntheir level of awareness and what is\ngoing on with them I'm wondering as well\nhow often do you and if you interact\nwith other healthc Care Professionals\nfor example like a social worker to\nsupport the kind of after effects of\nreceiving the diagnosis or someone like\na psychologist geriatrician you name it\nand in the perfect world it takes a\nmulti-disciplinary team to surround the\npatient right and so what happens for\nexample in Quebec is if a person is\ndiagnosed with any form of uh any form\nof dementia uh depending where they are\nlike in what stage they're at families\nare often uh recommended to be in touch\nwith a clsc social worker so the social\nworker is really the one that would come\nand that would assess the living\nsituation at home and you know maybe\nrecommend some home care support if\nneeded and then again in quec if they\nneed to transition to long-term care to\nthe public system it needs to be done by\na social worker you know in some cases\nthe family doctor is able to manage the\ncase as a whole otherwise it will be the\nthe case will be sent to to a\ngeriatrician right um and and oftentimes\na person will see a geriatrician if they\nhave other pre-existing health\nconditions so you may have an older\nadult who has you know heart issues and\ndiabetes and high blood pressure so it's\nit's there it's it's if they can also be\nmanaged by a g geriatrician who\nspecialize in dementia that's that's\nideal right if it's required that the\nperson have they want to do some more\ninvestigation and have more scans and\nhave more precise um details on what\ntype of dementia then they would\nprobably be seen by a neurologist and\nthen you know because the disease\naffects a person's again activities of\nday living along the way ideally you\nwould have an occupational and physical\ntherapist that's involved that comes and\ndoes a home assessment and ensures that\nthe person is safe uh at home um you\nknow you may have a nutritionist that\ncould be involved definitely a\npsychologist but I like in my case I had\na psychologist for myself blending me\nsupport but it's you know it as we see\nit's harder and harder in our current\nhealth care system to access all of\nthese resources the majority of people\nalso don't have the finances it's a very\nexpensive disease to manage financially\num because the more the disease evolves\nthe more care that you need so\noftentimes if you want to have access to\ndifferent resources because of the\nwaiting list in the public system people\nmay have to go privately and that that's\nsomething that's not always attainable\nfor many people due to the barriers to\naccessing care\nI could imagine that the onus on the\ncaregiver the care partner as well is\nquite high and this could perhaps look\nlike creating like a safe environment\nfor the person living with dementia um\noffering emotional support so I'm just\nwondering if you could speak to some of\nthe strategies that you use to or that\nyou offered for other people to create a\nsafe and supportive environment for um\nliving at home well that exactly I mean\nfor me what's most important whenever I\nhear a person is still living at home\nand whether you know especially if in\nthey they're in the early to mid stages\nit's it's kind of like I said that Gray\nZone where you always say are they safe\nand you know there are certain areas of\na home that could cause more uh danger\nthan others so for example um you know\nthe bathroom it should you should always\nhave the bath mats outside of the shower\nyou really want to avoid any types of\nslips and Falls you may want to have a\nhandlebar in the shower um be aware of\nnot keeping medications lying around\nbecause as the disease progresses the\nperson really needs to be administered\ntheir medication because if they take it\non their own they could forget to take\ntheir medications or they double up so\nmedications like that are in medicine\ncabinets or lying around on kitchen\ntables or bedside tables should be\nremoved right and you know I really look\nat everything because it this it's an\nillness that affects our vision so the\nperipheral vision starts to narrow and\nit really affects the mobility the\nperson starts to develop a bit of a\nshuffle you have to imagine that if a\nperson wakes up in the middle of the\nnight is there any risk of them falling\nso are the hallways well lit is there a\nnightlight in the bathroom um are there\nany cords that they could potentially\nfall over or lifted carpets you know\nloose carpets around I also I'm always\nconcerned about stairs because it does\naffect the visual spatial so somebody's\nability to easily understand how to go\nup and down stairs whenever I do home\nassessments I look are the stairs are\nthere Runners on the stairs how steep\nare the stairs because what happens is\nas time progresses if if a person wants\nto remain at home for as long as\npossible and their Mobility is affected\nI often recommend that they move their\nbedroom onto the main floor um because\nif if they like if they suffer a fall or\nany type of physical injury it will make\nthe disease progress much faster and\nusing my mother as an example you know\nshe had to have hip replacement surgery\nand unfortunately it did not go well as\nshe was also not able to be\nrehabilitated because she didn't\nunderstand the instructions on you know\nthe exercises to do uh and so she ended\nup you know being once upon a time a\nvery physically fit woman but then had\nto use a walker then she forgot how to\nuse the Walker she started falling and\nthen I had to transfer to a to a\nwheelchair but you know safety you know\nthere's also issues where sometimes a\nyou know a spouse will say well I've\njust gone out for a couple of hours and\nand I've left them they're okay alone\nbut are you sure they're okay alone are\nyou sure they don't go into the kitchen\nand you know forget and turn on the\nstove and forget the stove is turned on\nyou know um you know a microwave could\nalso be dangerous where they're putting\nsomething into the microwave for too\nlong or that that shouldn't go into the\nmicrowave so there are all kinds of of\nareas in the home that could cause you\nknow injury and fall uh if not properly\nsupervised like with many considerations\nlike I feel like there's so many subtle\nthings whether it's like the bath mats\nor like the microwaves I could imagine\nthat as a disease progresses there could\nbe a point where it's no longer safe to\nbe at home especially if the caregiver\nhas other responsibilities how would you\napproach the conversation about Assisted\nLiving if that's something that comes up\nwell I think what what caregivers have a\nhard time in in realizing is really\nassessing our own abilities right and\nand look nobody wants to move to a\nresidence or you know we we try to\nencourage people to try try to have home\ncare support at the beginning and but at\nsome point it it becomes not only no\nlonger safe for the person with living\nwith dementia but it becomes no longer\nsafe for the care partner and with this\ntype of illness a lot of the Care\nPartners are over the age of 75 some are\nin their mid 80s they themselves may\nhave some physical limitations and\nbecause the disease progresses where the\ncare partner has to help them you know\ngo to the washroom get into the shower\ndo the transfers you know they start to\nbecome\nincontinent um you know they have\ntrouble eating uh they get up multiple\ntimes in the evening perhaps wandering\nyou know for for a care partner if\nyou're on the verge of complete burnout\nand exhaustion or anger right there's a\nlot of them become extremely angry you\njust can't I mean I I I I see these\nfamilies all the time especially it's\nvery hard for spouses you know you've\nhad this you know For Better or For\nWorse marriage and you know then you\nhave to wake up and realize I just it's\nI just can't take care of my husband or\nmy wife anymore and it's a devastating\ndecision to have to make but at the same\ntime it's an important one because you\nknow you think that you're doing your\nbest to care for your loved one at home\nbut it gets to the point where you may\nnot be able to the disease could present\nas I mentioned earlier where the person\ncould become very verbally or physically\nabusive towards their spouse they could\nbecome very very dangerous where they\nthey just can't be home you know and so\nthe Care Partners end up feeling\ntremendous amount of guilt but they\nshouldn't because you know you're your\nas the disease progresses the this it\nbecomes harder on the care partner than\nit is on the person because the person\nis be is losing their Insight more and\nmore we start as Care Partners\nwitnessing all those physical changes\nthat have Tak place and so the number\none priority as a care partner has to be\nthe person's safety their cleanliness\nyou know and their happiness for For\nWhat happiness is worth and you know\nthere are times where people think oh\nI'm my my husband my wife mother fathers\nnever going to Residence but by moving\nthem to a res resence I have a recent\ncase where the the husband was just\nmoved to Residence he's actually doing\nbetter because he's getting a lot of\nsocial\nstimulation while he was at home he was\njust in in the living room just in front\nof the television which he couldn't even\nreally understand anymore but by being\nin a in in a good residence he's\nsocially stimulated because he's\nsurrounded by activity all day long I\ncould imagine that with all these\nchallenges it's hard for the caregiver\nthemselves to look after themselves so\nI'm just wondering as you speak about\nthat how do you as a caregiver take care\nof yourself well the majority of people\nthat I meet were like myself you know I\nsuffered a very very severe burnout um\nand it wasn't just from being a care\npartner because the truth is you know\nanybody who's caring for somebody who's\nwho's not well you also have a life\nright you like I I represented the\nsandwich generation where I had three\nyoung kids and I had a job and I had\nsociety's expectations right and I\nbelieved I made the mistake of believing\nthat I was Superwoman or super human\nwhere you know I can just go and go and\ngo and unfortunately a lot of a lot of\nCare Partners don't believe that they\nhave permission to have a life you know\nI find that often times with spouses\nwhere you know they say well because my\nhusband can't do this anymore well then\nI can't and they feel like you know the\nguilt is so overwhelming for them that\nthey just they just don't give\nthemselves any permission to have any\ntime so sad L it often takes a burnout\nor or a close to burnout for a care\npartner to realize okay it's time for me\nand what I say is look you even if you\ncan just find like one hour a day to go\nfor a walk just a walk I'm not telling\nyou to go to a gym I'm not telling you\nto just just a walk breathe you know get\nsome fresh air um I always say like set\nboundaries so you know I had to do when\nI in order to recover from my burnout I\nreally had to do a triage of my life and\nlook at what was working and what was\nnot working and who were the people in\nmy life that were adding positive vibes\nand those that weren't right and I had\nto really you know dig deep and get rid\nof like you know some toxic friends or\nsometimes it could be family members\nthat are not positive and so you know\nyou can't really get rid of family\nmembers but you can make the decision to\nsay I'm not having dinner with these\npeople but I'm going to do lunch because\nlunch is short it's an hour an hour and\n15 minutes it normally doesn't involve\nalcohol hopefully doesn't and then that\nit but you know or or you know that the\nfriend that would get get mad and say\nwell why aren't you calling me what you\nreally have to give yourself permission\nto say like to really preserve your\nenergy and not give your energy away to\npeople or to commitments you know some\nas as a society I find we have a really\nhard time saying no so people will ask\nus oh could you do this could you do\nthat the answer is no right and we don't\nhave to apologize so it's it's you know\nI would also suggest that if you're\nfeeling you're starting to feel\noverwhelmed it's important to seek\nprofessional help like if you can see\nget professional help from a a social\nworker a psychiatrist a psychologist a\ngroup therapy but don't wait um until\nyou're you know burning out to seek help\nand I think probably the two most\nimportant things is that oftentimes you\nknow anger stress burnout comes when you\nfeel that you don't have control so\neducation is key it's really important\nto become as educated as possible about\nthe disease whatever disease that you're\ndealing with but become as educated as\npossible be one step ahead of it at all\ntimes and also become educated as soon\nas possible about all the community\nresources that could help you and the\nperson that has the illness right and\ndon't wait A lot of times we say oh I'm\nnot there yet right but don't wait till\nyou're there and then you're crying for\nhelp right you've got to do your\nresearch and become educated as early as\npossible you speak the importance of\nacting early to be educated to be\nproactive and to have boundaries in\norder to care for yourself and I wonder\njust to conclude whether you have any\nresources you'd like to share for people\nwho are also dementia Care Partners well\nI would love to share uh the mill\nUniversity dementia education program\nwhich I proudly founded in 2017 um as a\nresult of my own journey of being a care\npartner and not being educated or\nsupported by the Health Care system and\num you know I I I I had no prior\naffiliation to Migel but I I knew that\nwe had one of the best medical schools\nin the world in our city and you know I\napproached them and said you know how\nwould you like to create this community\nprogram with me and and the dean said\nyes and so we've we've really developed\na comprehensive range of resources\nthey're all free um you go to mill.com\nmentia I'm sure you'll share the link\nwith listeners and we have various um uh\nresources so one of the most important\nones that I would recommend is our\ndementia companion guide\num it's available in 10 different\nlanguages um and you can download it for\nfree if people want printed copies it's\nabout $20 on Amazon and it supports our\nprogram but it's available in 10\ndifferent languages and many more to\ncome because dementia doesn't\ndiscriminate and it's important for us\nto really educate uh a really\nMulticultural population about this\ndisease and then we have a webcast\nseries called Migel cares where I've\nproduced about 100 uh webcasts with all\nkinds of leading healthc Care\nProfessionals on various topics not only\nrelated to dementia but other um topics\nlike ALS Parkinson's even cancer I have\nexperts I have uh caregivers I have\nsurvivors so that's a really great\nwebcast series and we're also uh I would\nalso recommend that people go and read\nthe 2021 and 2022 World Alzheimer\nreports produced by Alzheimer's disease\nInternational which is on our website\nthe the first one is on a journey\nthrough a diagnosis of dementia and the\nother one is all about post-diagnostic\nmanagement and care and again really\nit's a it's experts from all around the\nworld that have contributed to these um\nto these reports and we have some\nsupport groups um in partnership with\nAlzheimer's Society in Montreal we've\ngot virtual support groups we have a\nyoung carers uh support group we also\nhave an in a wonderful program called\ncaring conversations with two Pioneer\nsocial workers where every month there's\na different topic they present and then\ncaregivers could just register and you\ninteract with the social workers which\nis great and we're currently developing\num um activity modules Leisure and\nrecreational modules to teach Care\nPartners all kinds of activities that\nthey could do at home to stimulate um a\nperson living with dementia and\nhopefully in 2024 we'll also be\nlaunching our online education program\nso they're all there for you and people\nto access for free\nthank you so much for all that you do\nit's really amazing to share that your\num dementia companion guide has been\ntranslated to so many different\nlanguages I love how you're
