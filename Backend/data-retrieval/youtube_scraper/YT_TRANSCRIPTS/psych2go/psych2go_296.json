    "transcript": "- [Narrator] People can be a lot.\nThey can be helpful,\ncaring, and sympathetic,\nbut sadly they can also be destructive,\ninvasive, and hurtful.\nBoundaries need to be set.\nBoundaries can be words of warning,\nnot giving someone your\ntime, your attention\nto influence your emotions\nor not giving people\nmaterial goods or money.\nBoundaries can be set\nwith everyone and anyone\nbut these are seven types of people\nyou need to set strong boundaries with\nstarting with gossipers.\nSharing a secret with a friend\nmay feel like it'll bring\nthe two of you closer\nbut sometimes the little things\nour friends whisper to us\nare not just harmless secrets.\nSometimes our friends\ncan be nasty and ruthless\nwhen it comes to the\nreputation of other people.\nIt might seem like fun now,\nbut the gossiper, whether\nthey're a childhood friend,\na work acquaintance, or a family member\nhas a burning desire to tell\npeople the things they know\nor think they know.\nOften it just comes across\nas them making conversation\nor sharing something they\nfeel may be relevant to you.\nEvolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar\nexplains the purpose of\ngossip in his 2004 article\npublished in \"Review\nof General Psychology.\"\nAccording to his findings,\ntwo-thirds of conversation time\nis spent discussing social topics.\nIn other words, a large portion\nof what we talk about with our friends\nhas to do with other people.\nIt can seem innocent, but pay\nattention to the tone they use\nand the way they speak about other people.\nImagine what it might be like\nif they were talking to\nsomeone else about you.\nBoundaries need to be set with this person\nas a lot of the time,\nwhat they say might not be true\nor potentially embellished.\nThere's a strong possibility\nthat if gossiping is a habit for them,\nthey will gossip or have\nalready gossiped about you.\nAttention seekers.\nThe attention seeker\nis someone who either\nneeds to be seen, heard,\nor spoken about as often as possible.\nThere is a wide range of behaviors\nthat people might refer\nto as attention seeking.\nA lot of it is most likely innocent,\nbut sometimes attention\nseeking can be disruptive.\nWe all know the story of\nthe boy who cried wolf.\nThe story is still relevant\nbecause we all know or have known someone\nwho cries wolf for attention.\nPeople who are known as attention seekers\ncan hurt their own reputations\nthrough their attention seeking,\nso why would they do it?\nA 2011 study by C. Nathan\nDewalla and colleagues\npublished in \"Personality\nand Individual Differences\"\nfound that narcissists do typically engage\nin attention-seeking behavior.\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean\nthat all attention\nseekers are narcissists,\nbut narcissism could be\na potential explanation.\nHistrionic personality\ndisorder is another disorder\nthat could potentially exist\nin an attention seeker.\nWhen setting your boundaries\nwith attention seekers,\nmake sure there isn't\nsomething deeper at play.\nIf you are in the position to do so,\nbe a good friend towards them\nrather than completely avoiding them.\nDon't brush off suicide\nattempts or suicidal comments\nas attention seeking.\nThere are instances of\nthe suicidal individual\nreferring to their own\nactions as attention seeking\nas a way of avoiding\nconsequences or scrutiny\nbut if attention-seeking\ncomes in the form of bullying,\nnarcissistic behavior, or as\noffensive to your core beliefs,\nyou need to set those strong boundaries.\nVictim mentality.\nThe world is full of many, many tragedies\nand sometimes we find ourselves\nrunning into a string of\nunfortunate circumstances\nbut there are people who\nseem to only ever talk\nabout how the world is against them.\nIt's easy to see potential reasons\nfor why someone might learn this behavior.\nWhen we go to our friends for support,\nthey try to make us feel better.\nThis love and attention feels good\nand so it's understandable\nthat someone might\nsubconsciously take that route\nto attention every time.\nUnlike the attention\nseekers just mentioned,\npeople with a victim mentality\nappear markedly sadder.\nSetting boundaries with your friends\nwho have a victim\nmindset can be difficult.\nAfter all, it's a\nprivilege to have friends\nwho feel like they can talk\nto you about their problems.\nBefore you set boundaries,\nmake sure this person doesn't\nhave a serious problem\nthat can't be dismissed,\nbut if they're constantly\nreturning to minor problems,\nit's probably time to set boundaries.\nEncourage them to talk about\ntopics that they enjoy.\nSet boundaries for people\nwho play the victim\nfor the sake of your own mental health.\nSometimes it can be infuriating\nwhen faced with someone who\nconstantly plays the victim\nbut it can be even worse for us\nif we encourage that behavior\nby not setting boundaries.\nResearch done by Trine\nHeinemann and Veronique Traverso\nfor \"Journal of Pragmatics\" in 2009\nsuggest that complaints\nwill remain fairly tame\nuntil someone else engages with them.\nCompulsive liars.\nWe've all come across that kid\nwho says obvious bragging lies\nlike, \"My dad works for Nintendo\nand he told me,\" blah,\nblah, blah, blah, blah.\nAren't they the worst?\nOften these lies are paired with gossip.\nSometimes it's to create a\nbetter perception of themselves\nand sometimes they lie for sympathy.\nIt should be obvious\nthat the things a compulsive liar says\nshould be taken with a grain of salt.\nIt's generally understood\nthat pathological lying\nin a clinical sense begins in childhood.\nAccording to a study conducted\nby Katie Elizabeth Treanor\nfor the University of Wollongong,\nit was evident that pathological liars\nhave grown up without a script or model\nfor securing attention and love\nthrough healthy or\nsocially accepted avenues.\nPathological liars who do\nnot have a clinical condition\ndo it knowingly and specifically\nas a means of deception or manipulation.\nOnly a professional can\nmake the distinction\nbetween someone with a clinical issue\nand someone who is manipulative.\nEnablers.\nThe enabler seems like a great friend,\nperhaps even a best friend.\nThey seem to be the person\nyou can do everything with.\nWith their constant reinforcement,\nit's easy to think\nthat their support is\nhealthy and necessary\nbut enablers promote negative\nand unhealthy behavior.\nEnablers can be friends\nwho encourage you to drink or smoke\neven when you're trying to quit.\nWhile it might feel\nlike they have your\nbest interests at heart,\nthey may actually actually be using you\nas a way to justify their\nown poor life choices.\nResearch published\nin the \"Journal of\nSubstance Abuse Treatment\"\nindicates that enablers\nparticipated in the negative actions\nwith the addict and even\nmade excuses for the addicts,\nall while knowing they were\ntrying to break the addiction.\nBoundaries with enablers\nare extremely important.\nThey're one of the few cases\nwhere it might be completely necessary\nto cut them out of your life,\nespecially if you have\nan addictive personality\nor an addiction you would like to break.\nPeople who constantly belittle.\nMaking your way through\nthe world is difficult.\nHaving dreams and ambitions can be scary.\nAlmost everything we do\nwill be met with at least some criticism.\nAfter all, no one's perfect\nbut there are people who\nseem to never agree with you\nor never believe in your aspirations.\nThey may even talk down\nto you no matter what.\nThis is the person, be they a\nsibling, a parent, a friend,\nor even a significant other\nwho finds a hole in everything you do.\nNo matter how thorough\nor experienced you are,\nthey treat you like a complete novice.\nBelittling, patronizing,\nor talking down to someone\nhas only ever had a negative\neffect on performance\nas revealed in a 2012 study\nconducted by Sarah J. Gervais\nand Theresa K. Vescio.\nIt shows that the patronizer\nhas a lack of faith\nin your abilities\nwhich is why it hurts the most\nwhen it comes from someone\nwhom you respect, love,\nor are close to.\nOf course, it would be\ndifficult to set boundaries\nwith your boss or employer,\nbut with friends and family,\nboundaries need to be set\nespecially if this is\noccurring in adulthood.\nPeople who make you uncomfortable.\nThese people could be the kind of people\nwho make odd sexual\nremarks, act aggressively,\nor exhibit odd, possibly even\nconcerning physical behavior around you.\nThis is where boundaries\nare most necessary.\nIt should be noted that some\npeople on the autism spectrum\nmay be prone to saying some\nodd or questionable things\nthat can come across as awkward.\nThat doesn't excuse\neverything they might do\nbut it is something to be aware of.\nThese feelings of nervous discomfort\ncan come from anywhere,\nfamily, peers, strangers,\nor even employers.\nNaturally, we try to avoid the people\nwho make us feel this\nway as much as possible.\nTry to make sure someone\nknows about your discomfort.\nThis way you have someone\nwho is aware of the situation\nand is on your side if it's\na friend or family member\nwho makes you uncomfortable.\nIf it's occurring in a work environment,\nyou can notify the human\nresources department\nif the person has committed an offense.\nWe are all human.\nWe all have our problems\nthat can make us come across as annoying\nor frustrating to others.\nRemember to be empathetic\nto those who can't\nmonitor their own behavior\ndue to disorders or history.\nThere could be any number\nof underlying psychological conditions\nthat can affect any and all of these.\nHowever, some people\nreally are manipulative\nand mean-spirited\nand will do these things\nfor shallow reasons.\nThese are the people you have\nto set strong boundaries with.\nDo you think you need to set boundaries\nwith someone in your life?\nIf you enjoyed this video\nor found it helpful,\nwhy not leave a like, remember\nto subscribe to Psych2Go\nfor more content just like this.\nAll of the sources used for\nthis video can be found below."
