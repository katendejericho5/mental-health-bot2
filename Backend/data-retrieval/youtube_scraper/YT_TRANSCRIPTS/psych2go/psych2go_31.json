    "transcript": "if you ever feel like you're on edge all\nthe time or find yourself easily\nstartled by loud sudden sounds it could\nbe a sign that your body is holding on\nto past trauma trauma\ndisregulation into places that feel\nthreatening this means your body is on\nhigh alert so in for possible dangers\nbasically in a Perpetual state of fight\nor flight that's why you might feel\nagitated or easily irritable so how did\nthese complicated emotions manifest\nphysically one such way might be through\nthe morrow reflex the morrow reflex\ntypically occurs when you are a baby in\nbabies it's a normal and primitive\nreaction to stimulation how is this\nrelevant because as adults we still\ncarry versions of our early reflexes you\nhear a loud noise and instinctively\ncower or cover your head why trauma\ncould be a reason usually as we get\nolder we grow out of primitive reflexes\nbut if you have been through a traumatic\nor distressing childhood some of these\nreflexes may have stayed with you early\nchildhood trauma not only affects your\nemotions but also your neurological\ndevelopment and neurophysiology aka the\nshape of your brain the short scientific\nversion is that trauma interrupts the\nnatural development of your ref reflexes\nby sending you from fight or flight to\ndisassociative episodes this constant\nswitching back and forth makes it\ndifficult to have normal reflexes and\nrespond to stimulus so your flinching or\nstartled reactions to loud noises or\nover stimulation is a result of how your\nbody decides to interpret potential\ndanger however there are more reasons\nbeyond the neurological aspects as to\nwhy your body stores trauma your brain\nand mind can only handle so much\ndistress as a result the body steps in\nto shoulder some of the burden the\nconnection between your mind and body is\nincredible they are interdependent and\nhelp each other out when necessary if\nthe mind is overwhelmed with trauma the\ntrauma begins to affect your tissues and\nfascia pent up trauma in your body\nusually manifests itself in physical\npain and muscle stiffness when something\nreally bad happens our bodies can't\nalways Shake It Off traumatic\nexperiences can get stuck in our nervous\nsystem making us super sensitive to\nEveryday stuff that's why we might\noverreact to little things sometimes but\nhere's the good news we can work through\nit believe it or not you can heal your\nnervous system it will take time and\npatience but you can help it rewire\nthrough deep breathing proper nutrition\nand professional help deep breathing not\nonly helps release tension but also\nstimulates the vagus nerve a part of\nyour parasympathetic system\nunderstanding how trauma affects our\nbodies is the first step to Healing by\nrecognizing our reflexes and finding\nways to soothe our nervous system we can\nstart to let go of the past and reclaim\nour sense of Peace remember it's okay to\nask for help along the way there are\nplenty of resources out there to help\nsupport you on your journey to Healing"
