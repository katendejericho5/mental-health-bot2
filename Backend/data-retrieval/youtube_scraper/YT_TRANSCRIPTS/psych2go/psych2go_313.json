what's\ncomfortable is a classic sign of\nself-coddling self-help content creator\ncat alethro explains that coddling\nperpetuates the notion of a lack of\nself-trust and that caring for yourself\nrequires you to push yourself and show\nyourself that even if you fail you will\nbe okay so even if you go on that hike\nand something embarrassing happens it's\nunlikely it'll make or break your\nrelationship instead it could be a\nchance for you two to bond or even share\na first kiss with an epic View and if\nthey did make fun of you then you can\ncount yourself lucky that you figured\nout their true colors knowing you'll be\nbetter off without them just perfect\never notice people who get offended just\nby the idea that they could do something\nwrong and when confronted they\ncompletely deny it\nit's like how Mary defended herself in\nthe film persuasion saying I'm just too\nkind and that's my problem I give all of\nmy attention to others and then I suffer\nfor it the self-love isn't only about\nloving what you do right it's about\naccepting all of you including being\nable to identify your flaws and work on\nthem remember coddling is when you\nignore or
