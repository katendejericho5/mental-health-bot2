unsafe\nplace other people as malicious and\nuntrustworthy and themselves as damaged\nand unworthy social withdrawal as a\ntrauma response may manifest as spending\nless time with loved ones making less of\nan effort to stay in touch not wanting\nto go out or have people over getting\nnervous when someone gets too close to\nus lashing out aside from withdrawing\nsocially trauma victims also tend to\npush other people away by lashing out at\nthem anger is a common reaction to\ntrauma explained psychologist Dr Seth J\ngillahan and it can persist long after\nthe traumatic event ends you may feel\nanger at yourself for what happened at\nothers for not seeing it or helping you\nsooner or at the world in general when\nyou're unable to make sense of it all\nthis anger is often accompanied
