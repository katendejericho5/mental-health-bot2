    "transcript": "[Music]\ndo you consider yourself a deep thinker\nand feel things much more intensely than\nothers if you answered yes then chances\nare you're part of the small percentage\nof people who are highly sensitive so\nwhat does that mean well being a highly\nsensitive person or HSP means that you\nare naturally predisposed to process and\nperceive information on a much deeper\nlevel than most you're likely perceptive\nempathetic intuitive and self-aware hsps\nare also emotionally intelligent and\nIncredibly creative passionate\npeople as you can imagine though feeling\nin processing more intensely has some\ndownsides so without further Ado here\nare 13 struggles only highly sensitive\npeople will probably relate\nto one you can't function without sleep\nisn't it great when you wake up after a\ngood night of sleep and isn't it exact\nactly the opposite when you don't like a\nlot of us highly sensitive people don't\ndo well when they're sleep deprived they\nmight feel the effects of being cranky\ngroggy and on edge more than others this\nis because as Studies have shown hsps\nneed more sleep than most to\nfunction two you can't stand loud noises\ndoes the thought of a party or going to\na busy bar for the big game sound kind\nof terrible to you if yes you might be\nan HSP HSP get easily overwhelmed where\nthere are large crowds or lots of\ncommotion events like concerts going\nclubbing or festivals may be the popular\nidea of fun but to hsps it might just\nsound like a direct path to a personal\nshutdown so if you're not an HSP but\nsomeone you know is they're not being a\nDebbie Downer or boring they're\npracticing\nself-preservation three you often feel\nemotionally exhausted anyone ever tell\nyou that they appreciate your empathy do\nyou have mixed feelings feelings about\nit because it also exhausts you a key\ncharacteristic of being a highly\nsensitive person is that you feel things\nmore deeply and intensely than others so\nfrequent absorption and reflection of\nothers emotions especially if you're out\nall day can feel like you're on an\nemotional roller coaster four you\nscrutinize social interactions ever been\nin a situation where your friends wowed\nthat you're spot on when reading a\nsituation well that's because you notice\nthings lots of things these things are\ncues others often miss particularly in\nsocial situations you're very good at\nperceiving nonverbal cues and analyzing\nanother person's tone unfortunately this\nmeans you also tend to overanalyze\nthings which can lead you to making a\nmountain out of a mole\nhill five you're easily triggered by\nviolence how do you feel about watching\nmovies with Gore how about listening to\ndetails of a heinous crime if all you're\nthinking or feeling right now is nope\nnope nope this is a sign you may have\nHSP hsps have very strong viseral\nreactions towards violence and cruelty\neven if they know it's fake like a movie\nwhich is why it can be so unsettling for\nthem to watch or hear about anything too\ngraphic six you have a hard time moving\non does a breakup from 3 months ago\nstill sting like yesterday still bitter\nand hurt over being backstabbed 5 years\nago you're okay and it's not weird it's\njust High sensitivity one of the most\npainful downsides to being so sensitive\nis that you could have a hard time\nletting go emotional pain received be it\nfrom an insult to a breakup just tends\nto linger with you you know in the back\nof your mind that it's not really a big\ndeal but you can't help making it one\nanyway seven you're uncomfortable with\nchange do you feel anxious when eating\nsomewhere new or trying something you've\nnever done before do you spend so much\ntime getting comfortable with your usual\nroutine that it feels uncomfortable to\nsuddenly change things up when you're in\nHSP navigating new environments can be\ntaxing on you because you have to take\neverything in before you can start to\nfeel comfortable eight you don't react\nwell to criticism and conflict how do\nyou take it when you hand something in\nand someone tells you yeah but I wanted\nit different how do you feel hsps are\nsome of the gentlest and most tender\npeople you will ever meet they're\nemotional and soft-hearted which means\ndealing with them requires a more\ncareful approach\ncriticizing them raising your voice at\nthem and getting upset with them in any\nway can hurt them deeply even if it\ncomes from a good place nine you don't\ndo well under pressure ever heard yes I\nwork well under pressure or pressure\nmakes me do better yeah those people\naren't hsps deadlines in similar time\npressure can cause serious distress to a\nhighly sensitive person they hate having\nto rush into anything and juggling\nseveral tasks at once they're much more\ncont tent taking their time with their\nprojects and giving their full singular\nFocus to whatever they're\ndoing 10 your boundaries are easily\ncrossed if your friend is disappointed\nor sincerely asking for help we know you\nfeel bad for them you have compassion\nyou're not a jerk but how bad do you\nfeel are you still able to say no if\nit's beyond your boundary or is the\ncompassion so intense that it overrides\nit hsps are more emotionally aware than\nmost so they feel compa for someone's\nsituation quicker and deeper because of\nthis they often end up saying yes to a\nlot of things they don't want to do just\nto please those around them and avoid\nletting them down 11 you are your own\nworst critic are you already thinking of\na small mistake you made earlier this\nweek it's okay you know that we all make\nmistakes a highly sensitive person finds\nit difficult to come to terms with their\npersonal failures they beat themselves\nup over every little goof they made and\nhold themselves to an impossible i l\nhigh standard no one is harsher or more\ndemanding of themselves than an\nHSP 12 you require alone time ever tell\nsomeone you need quiet time and they\nstill don't leave the room or they still\ncontinue texting you constantly they\nlikely don't understand that you require\nSolitude hsps can't be around other\npeople for long periods of time and some\ndays are simply too much for them to\nBear because they process things at such\na deep level they need more time to rest\nand recover from all the mental and\nemotional energy they\nexpend and 13 you are often\nmisunderstood if you're a highly\nsensitive person you probably feel\nmisunderstood by those around you\nbecause only one in every five people\nhave this trait of high sensitivity it\ncan be difficult for other people to\nrelate to you and understand your point\nof view also many people likely don't\nknow that this is a tradeit not a full\nvoluntary Choice like choosing what's\nfor dinner this despite the issues we've\nlisted here being a highly sensitive\nperson is a wonderful trait to have\nthese issues are simply the darkness
