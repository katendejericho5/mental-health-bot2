    "transcript": "[Music]\nhello psych too viewers this is Michelle\nRivas and I'm the host of psychology\nRoundtable today we're going to be\ndiscussing how to deal with toxic people\nand relationships during the holiday\nseason because let's be real we've all\nbeen through it and it sucks today we\nhave clinical psychologist Dr industri\nRajan to give us some great tips and\nadvice on how to manage it and also to\nanswer your viewer questions about\neverything and anything welcome Dr Ran\nthank you so much for joining us today\noh it's my pleasure to be here I'm happy\nto be here hi everyone um I'm glad to\nanswer questions that you may have and I\nknow we're gonna have a section of that\nlater right yes we're gonna have our\naudience segment so I'm really excited\nfor that so thanks so much for having me\nabsolutely you were actually one of our\nkeynote speakers at the Barnes & Noble\nevent and fundraiser and that was\namazing and um we really appreciate you\ncoming out to do that and so I'm really\nexcited so I just wanted to start off um\ncan you tell us a little bit about\nyourself and your background yeah so I'm\na clinical psychologist in relationship\ncoach I've been working with people who\num want to improve their relationship\nwith themselves and have just kind of be\nhappier and live better lives um you\nknow do do the things that they do but\nin a more happy and real way um I work\nwith singles who are looking forward to\nmeeting people that they want to have\nrelationships with and perhaps even you\nknow get married you know find their\nsoulmate the one that they feel meant to\nbe with I work with couples I work with\nindividuals who are struggling um in\nterms of family relationships um I work\nwith people who are married who are\nengaged and also people who are just\nstruggling like with depression or\nanxiety or you know different different\nmental health issues so that's amazing\nand the work you do is really helping\npeople because we all know that we need\num mental health professionals in this\nspace so thank you so much oh it's my\npleasure it's my pleasure to be here\nyeah so it's Thanksgiving week and it's\nthe beginning of the holiday season and\nwe all know the narrative the holidays\nare supposed to be cheerful and joyful\nbut the truth is many people feel\nextremely stressed and anxious during\nthe holidays and toxic relationships are\nusually the root cause for this so let's\njust Dive Right In Dr Ran how do toxic\npeople essentially hijack the holidays\nand make it dreadful for those around\nthem\nso when we talk about somebody who's got\nwho's who's toxic emotionally right\nwe're talking about probably people who\nmight have a negative perspective who\nmight not have the best boundaries who\nmight maybe lash out and say things that\nare uncomfortable that kind of put\npeople back on their heels like when you\nthey they're uncomfortable so they make\nyou uncomfortable right yeah so pretty\nsoon what ends up happening is we react\nand I want to talk a little bit about\nthe difference between responding and\nreacting because that makes a big\ndifference in terms of communication and\nhow we deal with our emotions and also\nwant to talk about awareness and\nboundaries right so toxic people hijack\nthe holidays why because they kind of\nspew whatever they spew right they're\nthey don't really they're not mindful of\nboundaries they're not mindful of how\ntheir behavior or their way of being\nmight impact people and then pretty soon\nyou're left with this stuff of like wow\nI feel like crap now you know and in\nsome cases it could be like you're\ndealing with a narcissist who likes\nattention sure well everybody I mean the\nthing that's important to realize is\nthat all everybody is at some level or\nanother self-conscious and self-absorbed\nright yeah we all have our issues we all\nhave our wound wounds we know we're all\nHamm right so certainly if somebody has\na certain kind of way of\nBehaving that makes you like who you\nknow you might have a stronger response\nto some ways of being than other people\nand you might be okay with dealing with\nother things where other people may not\nand for in your opinion just from like\nyour experience working with clients do\nyou think that the holidays makes toxic\npeople more toxic or do you think like\nhow do you feel about that narrative\nwell the holidays are loaded right\nhere's the thing I mean people have\neverybody has a story\nabout the holidays either it it has to\ndo with this embarrassing relative or it\nhas to do with the stress of cooking and\nhaving everybody over it has to do with\noh man you know my parents are always\nthis way or my husband's always this way\nso all of us have a story about the\nholidays and we also all have\nexpectations for the holidays I'm tired\nit's the end of the year I want to relax\nor oh I I really want to get all my\nChristmas shopping done by a certain\ntime so I can enjoy the holidays or oh\nmy God the holidays are coming I hate\nthe holidays so we all have feelings and\nexpectations around the holidays we all\nhave you know stories about the holidays\nso what is so this I think means that we\nare more vulnerable during the holidays\nto um either you know get you know get\ninto a place where we're reacting and\nthen pretty soon we're not really\nfeeling good about the choices that\nwe're making or we're not feeling good\nabout how we're we're treating people or\nhow we're being treated and we also our\nexpectations can set the tone for how\nthings go right if you have negative\nexpectations you're probably gonna you\nknow there's going to be some aspect of\nself filling prophecy there maybe right\nbecause we're focusing on that but that\ndoesn't mean that that can't be the only\nexpectation or the only frame frame that\nyou have that's true yeah having a\npositive outlook but I think that a lot\nof people like they dealt with toxic\npeople the same toxic people during\nevery holiday season and you know to\nthat point I just want to know how do\nyou deal with like passive aggressive\ncomments or questions at the Holiday\ntable for example maybe a rude comment\nabout how your pumpkin pie isn't sweet\nor creamy enough like something like\nthat so you you want to before you leave\nfor the holidays I think it's helpful a\nlot of people are avoidant but I think\nit's helpful to kind of sit and think a\nlittle bit about okay who's going to be\nthere right yeah that's and\nand yeah just kind of front load I call\nit front loading where you're instead of\navoiding you're going to just spend a\nfew minutes and think about okay who am\nI going to encounter right do I do I\nlike this person do I feel comfortable\nwhat are they usually like so you're\npreviewing a little bit about what\nyou're likely to encounter right so then\nas you do that what you also want to do\nis have your response that you're also\nkind of front-loading that you're\nthinking about ahead of time so so if\nsomebody tends to be\ncritical oh you know I don't like this\npie or oh that's a nice dress or they\ngive you left-handed compliments let's\nsay like oh that's a nice dress somebody\nyour size looks better in in dresses\nlike that where you kind of feel like\nthere's a little insult wrapped up in a\ncompliment sort of a thing you need to\nhave boundaries around what you're gonna\ndo right because you don't it's it's a\nhappiness is a choice so that means\npeace during the holidays is a choice\ntoo that means you get to be happy at\nChristmas it doesn't matter who's around\nyou get to be happy at Thanksgiving no\nmatter who's around because you get to\ndecide what you're going to take in and\nwhat you're not so when somebody comes\nout with being critical remind yourself\noh yeah so and so can be kind of\ncritical but you know what I'm just\ngoing to um I just I'm deciding now that\nI'm going to switch the subject or I'm\ndeciding now that I'm just going to\nsmile and and remind myself of what the\nthe truth is right so it's like a matter\nof like mentally preparing yourself\nmanaging your expectations and like\nknowing what you're going into\nessentially that's definitely I think a\nlot of it is part of it because what\nwhat we have to do when we think about\nuncomfortable circumstances you have to\nfocus on what you can't control and\nfocus on what you can what can you\ncontrol you can control your attitude\nyou can control whether you're making\nyou know what choices you're making in\nterms of being being spending time with\nsomeone I'm only going to spend this\nmuch time and then I'm going to somebody\nelse's house or I'm or I'm going to you\nknow have um somebody uh I'm going to\nhave a book with me so that I know that\npeople kind of the kids play in a\ncertain room and I'm going to maybe go\nand read a little bit you know when\nthere's other stuff going on you have\nchoices you have choices so you can\ncontrol your attitude you can control\nyour expectations and you can control\nthe boundaries that you put up so yeah\nand then the other things can't control\nor or how people respond to you or other\npeople's feelings and behaviors and\nusually if someone feels a need to put\nyou down it's because they're having\nlike a problem with themselves right\nbecause if you're going to choose the\nThanksgiving dinner table to shame\nsomeone you obviously have issues with\nyourself and I think that's important\nfor people to remember that person\nclearly isn't happy with themselves or\nprojecting and that goes back to front\nloing right so if you if you are\nthinking it's this is another why it's\nuseful reason why it's useful to think a\nlittle bit ahead of time of what do we\nusually do for the holidays who usually\nshows up how do I feel about this person\nand yeah you know what what about that\ncriticism thing is it really true that\nmy cooking is bad is it really true that\nI'm not a fun person I mean whatever it\nis you feel criticized about give\nyourself a chance to think about it\nremind yourself of what's true you know\nwhat I'm I'm yeah my cooking isn't for\neveryone but I like my cooking so when\nso and so gives you a criticism like\nlike that consider is it really about me\nor might might it be about them it might\nbe about them because what did I say at\nthe beginning most people are\nself-conscious most people are\nself-absorbed right so yeah and so you\nknow going you know just seg into this\npoint when should someone decline an\ninvite to a family gather Gathering a\nreunion if they know the situation is\ntoo\nvolatile well I mean I would certainly I\nI think think of it in terms of of you\nknow safety emotional and physical\nsafety I think that's the biggest thing\nlike if you feel like let's say that\nthere's an abusive dynamic in your\nfamily or let's say that there's a\nvolatility then I would I would make it\nvery clear okay I'm what what is\ncomfortable for me you know is it\ncomfortable for me to stay for dinner is\nthat too too much is it maybe more\ncomfortable for me to stop by in the\nbeginning um um you know and and say\nhello and maybe drop off a card and\nflowers or something and then leave um\nis it is it more comfortable comfortable\nfor me to come by the day after\nThanksgiving so think of it in terms of\nhow am I best going to keep myself safe\nemotionally and physically and also it's\nfine to be to if if there are certain\npersonalities or certain people that\nreally really make things worse really\nquickly and and puts you in a vulnerable\nplace it's okay to be clear about you\nknow whoever is hosting the dinner you\nknow I'm I am doing I'm I'm going to\nshow up at this time I'm I'm going to\nshow up this way and I or you know\nbecause it's better for me or you know\nI'm really not wanting to deal with\nsoand so do you know when they're coming\nand and I'll just I'm gonna adjust when\nI show up you know based on that you\nknow kind of like a compromise because\nyou shouldn't force yourself if you know\nit's going to be a toxic situation you\nshouldn't force yourself through a whole\ndinner right it's kind of like a\ncompromise I'll come for you know dinner\nand leave before dessert I love that\nyeah it's like a compromise and and just\nbeing able to the other thing that I\nthink a lot of times we forget when\nwe're with family is we think we owe big\nlong explanations and you don't yes you\ndon't owe anybody an explanation people\nare people and and again you know people\nmay want to know they may try to force\nyou or pressure you but that's not\nsomething you owe anyone you don't have\nto do that you don't owe anyone an\nexplanation because the holidays are for\nyou as well I think that sometimes\npeople feel like they have to make other\npeople happy during the holidays it's\nabout family no it's the holidays and it\ncan be whatever you want and you need to\nbe kind to yourself absolutely and and\nyou don't have to you can what I also\nthink is important is when you have a\nhard time talking to family and family\ntends to guilt you or put or shame you\nor put pressure on you uh you know oh\nare you going to show up oh there you go\nagain you're not going to show up be a\nhave a short statement of what you're\ngoing to say and be a broken record\nabout it you know actually you know what\nI'm doing something a little different\nthis year for the holidays I'm spending\na little bit of time with multiple\npeople so that's just what I'm choosing\nto do you can it can be a very general\nexplanation and and you can you know you\ncan also deflect and allow people to sit\nwith their own emotions if someone\nstarts if you start to guilt trip if you\nif somebody starts to guilt trip you you\ncan you can just say you know what I can\nsee that it's really important to you\nthat I that I am here today and that's\nwhy I'm really happy to be here in the\nmorning but unfortunately my schedule so\nyou know doesn't allow me to stay late\nright so you can acknowledge what\nthey're feeling you can put it back to\nthem and you're not going to internalize\nthat guilt because that's about them\nit's not about you definitely and I\nthink I was going to ask so I know that\nthere are people during the holidays\nthat feel like maybe their family's too\ntoxic and they want to step away um just\nlike how can we encourage enage people\nto not feel guilty about maybe spending\nthe holidays alone because there's\nnothing wrong with that it's actually a\ngreat opportunity to practice self-care\num you know you can treat yourself\nthere's nothing wrong with you know\nbeing alone during the holidays but\nthere is that stigma like well why don't\nyou have family why don't you have\nanyone to hang out with and I don't\nthink anyone should feel bad about that\nand you don't owe anyone an explanation\nso how can we you know destigmatize\nmaybe spending the holidays by yourself\nif need right well I mean the thing is\nwe again like remember I said before we\nall have a story about the holidays and\nthose stories can even come from movies\nthat we've watched or songs or or the\nthis the way that we think Christmas has\nto be in order for it to be a good\nChristmas or the way that soand so says\nit has to be for it to be a good\nThanksgiving the truth is you get to\ndecide what what makes you happy and\nthere's nothing wrong with that at all I\nmean so for some people it's a relief to\nbe alone and they don't think they have\na choice because oh God we have to pack\nup the car we have to because this is\nwhat has always been done but remember\nyou get you get to choose what makes you\nhappy and happiness is a choice you get\nto create your own story of the holidays\nright maybe it might be a good exercise\nyou know buy yourself a Christmas card\nhonor the fact yeah and in that\nChristmas card write down what you love\nabout the holidays write down what makes\nyou happy so that you're staying present\nto self from a place of love not from a\nplace of guilt or shame and that will I\nthink restore some of the joy of the\nseason because it's a cool season it's\nfun no matter what you do there's lots\nof ways to have fun on your own\ntoo yeah and I I was thinking it's funny\nbecause there's this like I had\nmentioned the stigma about spending the\nholidays alone like it's weird and I\nactually was thinking about it I've\nspent the like you know different\nholidays by myself before and sometimes\nit can be more fun because you can watch\nany Christmas movie you want to watch\nlisten to your songs eat your food\nthere's a beauty in just taking care of\nyourself sometimes and being on your own\nlike there's a balance and no one should\never make you feel bad about that and so\num you know missfit um one of our\nviewers just mentioned I'll be spending\nit alone for the first time this year\nand I'm actually looking forward to it\nyes like take care of yourself it's a\ngood you might and and the thing is too\nI think people feel Locked In by\nTraditions right yes or rituals like oh\nmy gosh I I hate the fact that know I\ndon't know why we have to do this people\nGrumble a lot because they're not being\nthey're not actively seeking out what\nmakes them happy they're falling in line\nwith whatever the way that things have\nalways been or this is the way that so\nyou know what might be fun I think it's\nfun to create you know ask yourself what\nwhat are some traditions that would be\nfun for me like if I yes if I had just\nfound out about this holiday called\nChristmas um and I didn't know what it\nwas supposed to look like or I didn't\nknow what kind of things people are\nsupposed to do or same thing with\nThanksgiving what would be fun like how\nwell how would I like to express things\nto me to the world to to my friends to\nmy family who to whom would I like to\nexpress things right I love that like\nknowing to prioritize yourself to an\nextent it doesn't just have to be all\nabout you if you don't want it to be but\nmake sure I think it's essential to\nprioritize what you like as well because\nif you're just trying to make everyone\nelse happy it's going to hurt you and I\nthink that's you know key just knowing\nwhen to step back and take care of\nyourself and listen to yourself and what\nyou like doing as well which I think a\nlot of parents sometimes forget to do\nyeah exactly it can be because if you\nhave a if you have a small child or if\nyou have you know if you're like the\ncook that everybody relies on it can get\nit it gets so easy especially if you're\na nurturer right what do you do you put\neverybody else El's needs first and then\nyou know you're going to collapse on the\ncouch at some point during the day but\ndid you get to experience gratitude for\nall the work that you did did you get\ndid you feel loved by it and if you did\ngreat if you answer yes to those\nquestions that's great but what I think\nwhen we talk about loneliness we talk\nabout appreciation we talk about you\nknow gratitude um what leaves a big hole\nin people's hearts is when they forget\nthemselves right yes you're not\nconnecting with yourself in a meaningful\nway around Thanksgiving around Christmas\naround just even reg just regular days\nlike if you have little children or if\nyou're cooking or you know you're being\npulled in all these different directions\nyou know if you don't connect in a\nmeaningful way with yourself that makes\nthe loneliness worse there that's a bad\nthat's a really deep loneliness that\ndevelops um that makes that feeling of\nbeing taken for granted worse that makes\nright so we need to be filling our own\nCup first and it you know you might\ndevelop feelings of worthlessness and\nthat's not okay you always have to like\nappreciate yourself be kind to yourself\nand people often forget that especially\nempaths a lot of empaths you see they're\ntrying to make everyone else happy\nthey're listening to everyone else but\nthey're forgetting about themselves and\nyou shouldn't because you know we're all\ndeserving of love and someone to listen\nto us and we're all deserving of a\nfriend absolutely\nand and I mean this is I think that the\nse you know there's so much dread when I\nsee clients during this time of year\nthere's depression there's anxiety\nthere's dread there's already this\nexpectation of loneliness but you know I\njust want to encourage you little things\ncan make such a big difference and you\nknow you know before you settle into\nthose stories because I'll tell you\nsomething they're stories they're not\nnecessarily true they don't have to be\nbefore you decide okay this is the story\nthat I'm going to focus on ask yourself\nwhat kind of a story would you like to\ntell about your holiday season what kind\nof a story would you like to tell what\nwould you like to be true for you and\nand and check in with yourself first\nabout those\nresponses right no definitely and I mean\nI think that it's just a matter of it's\ninteresting because holidays there is\nthis narrative that it's supposed to be\njoyful and peaceful but if you're\nforgetting about your own needs it's\nnever going to be you know yeah and I\nthink I mean simple things like what I\nlike to do I'll give you a simple ritual\nthat I like to do on\nThanksgiving is I like to have you know\neither on Day on on years that I have\nmore time I like to get those little\nmini trees you know and I like to hang\non the little mini tree what are the\nthings I'm grateful for about myself so\nif I take like a hole punch or or\nwhatever and I get or I get index cards\nand do a little hole punch you know\nlittle squares of index cards or you can\ndo it however you want to I'm going to\nwrite down maybe a quality that I have\nthat I like or I'm going to write down\nlove that I'm gonna write down a little\nthing that I did that I'm proud of right\nand I'm gonna hang them on my little\ntree so I can keep it up that's that can\nbe a cool gratitude ritual for yourself\nget a Thanksgiving card and write down I\nam grateful for myself why am I grateful\nfor myself and write down all of the\nthings that are are wonderfully you um\nso that you IDE you're filling your cup\nyou know before you go and and do\nwhatever it is you're doing for the\nholidays I love that idea and I think\nthat is amazing because we have to\npractice gratitude and self-love and so\nwith that being said that brings us to\nour audience segment where we answer\nyour viewer questions with the help of\nour amazing experts but before we get\ninto that I I really wanted to encourage\neveryone to subscribe to our new channel\npod to go it's in the description and I\nalso put a link in the chat um it's\nexclusive interviews and content from\nother amazing experts and guests in the\nfield of psychology and mental health um\nand so just please give that a like and\nyou know hope to see a lot of you there\nand so now that we're going into the\naudience segment let's go into the first\nquestion are you ready Dr Rajan I am\nready let's do\nit okay so the ne the first question is\nfrom Marissa she asked hello Dr Rajan I\nwas just wondering um usually during the\nholidays my mother-in-law has this habit\nof fat shaming me she makes comments\nabout my weight and it's really\nembarrassing last Thanksgiving she made\na comment that I looked like I had\ngained 10 pounds and everyone was\nlaughing and I just don't know what to\ndo I'm dreading Thanksgiving this year\nwhat do I do if she wait shames me in\nfront of everyone\nagain that's\nhorrible that's a difficult difficult\nthing and I'm you know I'm gonna share\nwith you Marissa I mean I think we all\ngo through things that are difficult and\nand you know we're in a process in life\nright we're all working on something or\nthe other we all feel bad about\nourselves about something or the other\nso give yourself some Grace first of all\ntake a breath give yourself some Grace\nand and understand that this person who\nintimidates you and shames you she's\nprobably coming from a place where she's\nnot happy with herself either people who\ntend to lead with criticism or lead with\njudgment they're that's their lens\nthat's how they see the world so it's\nI'm just going to encourage you Marissa\nit's not just you okay she sees that way\nI'm guessing she sees herself that way\nI'm guessing she sees the world that way\nwhich is an unfortunate way to live\nthat's one thing as I want to remind you\nof the context um the other thing is if\nyou are doing things for yourself I mean\nclearly you're conscious that you are\nnot happy about your weight it seems to\nme from what your comment perhaps or\nmaybe you're working on a being a\nhealthier version of yourself you can\nfeel good about that you get to feel\ngood about that and nobody can take that\naway from you so if she if she says\nsomething that's mean in front of other\npeople you can you can just smile and\nsay\nactually I'm feeling better because\nthese are the things I'm because because\nI'm I'm eating better I'm making better\nchoices so I'm feeling better or\nactually I've lost a little bit of\nweight and I'm feeling good about my\nbody or you don't even have to qualify\nit you can say you know what I'm\nactually happy I feel good about where I\nam right now and what that does is it it\nimmediately takes that pressure off of\nyou and it puts her negative energy back\nin the space it's your way of saying\nsaying nope that's not mine I'm not\nreally taking that in because I know\nthat it's not true about me and I'm on I\nknow the path that I'm on so if she if\nthat's her negativity you can let her\nhave it you don't have to hold it that's\na great strategy it's kind of like\nthrowing selflove back at them like no\nactually I think I look great and I've\nlost weight yeah I love that that's\ndefinitely true and I'm sorry Marissa\nthat's very abusive and if you can maybe\nstay away from your mother-in-law I know\nit's hard cuz do you stay away from\npeople who like your mother-in-law your\nmom your grandmother it's it's hard\nbecause those are people who are kind of\nlike immediate family um but if you can\nstay away from them um to an extent I\nwould and having the inter you can have\ninternal boundaries I mean I think one\nof the things that really helps when\nyou're in the\nsame um house with people that you're\nlike oh God it's going to be a little\nstressful breathe first of all remember\nyour breath when some if there if you\nknow if there's something that like that\nwhere it's like I love my grandma I know\nthat that you know my grandma loves me\nbut she just doesn't have a good way of\nsaying stuff you know and I I I I'm just\ngoing to stay with the fact that she\nloves me but you know I'm just going to\nlet it go because I know that she just\ndoesn't have a good way of saying things\nsometimes the things she says can be\nhurtful so that way you're framing it\nfor yourself internally you know and you\nremember what I said we're not reacting\nwe're responding so instead of reacting\nto the negative Grand the negative\nmother-in-law were responding from\ninside okay here's that negativity I\nknow I know that that's the case so I'm\ngoing to go grab myself something to\ndrink I'm going to go you know see if\nsomebody else needs help in the kitchen\nor something like that that's also a\nuseful thing a deflection like if you're\nin the house decide ahead of time you\nknow what when things get uncomfortable\nfor me I'm giving myself permission to\ngo to the bathroom or if things get\nuncomfortable for me I'm giving myself\npermission to ask if they need help in\nthe kitchen\nor I'm going to give myself permission\nto go to my car and you know maybe I'm\njust going to tell everybody oh I need\nto check something in my car and I'm\ngonna hang out in my car for a few\nminutes yeah take your time out you know\ndefinitely like if you need to step out\nfor a little bit that doesn't make you\nthat doesn't mean that you're doing\nanything wrong like you just need a\nmoment to yourself and if someone shames\nyou for that so be it but if you need a\nmoment take a moment that's self-care\nabsolutely yeah and then Joanna asked Dr\nRan me and my husband usually have a\ngood relationship but during the\nholidays he has this habit of\ncriticizing my cooking in a passive\naggressive way in front of family\nmembers and I really don't appreciate it\nI've cried about this in private many\ntimes how do I address this to him I\ndon't like the comments and they're not\nfunny to me a I'm sorry Joanna oh Joanna\nthat sounds so painful and have you\naddress now this is your her husband\nright yeah her husband so have you\naddressed this directly with your\nhusband before is what I'm wondering um\nif if you\nhaven't what I would decide what I would\ndo is I would take him aside and and I\nwouldn't I wouldn't do it the day of\nThanksgiving I would maybe do it a\ncouple of days before and I would let\nhim know you know when you do this this\nreally hurts my feelings and I need you\nto understand that that you know it it\nit also embarrasses me because it's in\nfront of everyone so could you please\nnot do this you you know I would put up\na boundary and I would be very clear in\ntalking to him first about it if he\ndecides if if he go goes ahead and does\nit anyway then I would I would take you\nknow I would maybe that maybe there's\nsomething that you want to say back in\nresponse so that he knows that you're\nnot going to just take whatever he says\nin front of everyone maybe maybe you\ncould say something simple like oh I'm\nsorry that you didn't like that you know\num that's too bad hopefully you have\nsomething else here that you like or you\nknow or oh you know what I was trying\nsomething new and I I like it or you\ndon't even like I said you don't even\nhave to make a you know make a\njustification oh you know why I kind of\nlike my gravy you don't like my gravy\nhuh all right well less less for you\nthen I like you know you can have you\ncan kind of deflect with with a little\nbit of humor as well I know that it's\nhard when you're put on the spot like\nthat and go ahead sorry go ahead the\nlonger term fix would be to directly\nhave a conversation about it to to try\nto address it so that there is an\nintervention um so that that you're\nminimizing the chance first of all you\nwant to make sure you've been heard\nsecondly you want to work with your\npartner on a better choice that would be\nof benefit to both of you I'm happy to\nhear about you know what you want to say\nabout my cooking but not in front of\npeople yeah and Joanna you know we were\ntalking me and Dr Ran were talking about\nboundaries earlier and if you have to\npull your husband aside and say hey well\nmaybe if you you know if if you're going\nto make comments about my cooking I\nwon't cook this Thanksgiving maybe you\ncan have that boundary like if you\nembarrass me or if you make rude\ncomments in front of people I'm not\ngoing to cook anymore during the\nholidays because that's a boundary if\nyou're being shamed or embarrassed and\nit really hurts you you shouldn't feel\nobligated to cook for him you know\nabsolutely and and that's where again it\nbecomes important to and I don't think\nenough people do this to really take a\ntake a moment and before you commit to\ndoing different things\nhow do I feel about these commitments\nthat I'm making do I feel like cooking\ndo I want to cook do I feel like these\nthese things I'm committing to are they\nis it realistic for me to do all of\nthese things how would I feel happier\nhere right if we are allowed to take\nsome space for ourselves before we feel\nlike oh my gosh I have to do all of this\nstuff then it's not going to be as\nloaded either and absolutely if you know\nif if he is if this is a regular thing\nthat he continues to do just tell them\nyou know what it makes me feel bad about\nmyself when this happens and so I've\ndecided I'm not cooking this is not\nsomething I'm going to be doing anymore\nso that way he can decide what what you\nknow that that gives him a different set\nof choices doesn't it for what what uh\nwho's going to be cooking dinner and how\nthat's going to\ngo I agree dran thank you for that and\nthen nabila Med asked my family puts way\ntoo much pressure on me and I'm guessing\nhe means during the holidays what what\ndo I do I've been dealing with\ndepression for a year and then so what\ndo you what would your advice be for a\nlot of people who go home for the\nholidays and they feel like their family\nputs pressure on\nthem well again I'm so sorry Nabil that\nyou're going through this it can be a\nreally difficult thing um to to feel the\nthe stress of that so I'm sorry that\nthat's your experience you know I think\nthat what starts to happen we start to\nfeel empowered uh when we remember who\nwe are and we remember reme we remember\nwhy we're making the choices that we're\nmaking in life right because when\npeople's expectations get to be way too\nstrong then we start to even forget\nwhere we stand in it right so for\nexample let's say that your parents are\npressuring you to be a doctor and you\ndon't want to be a doctor you know let's\nsay that you want to be a teacher and um\nyou made a certain decision to be on a\ncertain study track to be a teacher and\nnot a doctor and now they they kind of\ntake make comments and they put pressure\non you you can you you you need to First\nbe clear on what brings you Joy and what\nchoices you've made uh for yourself and\nfor your life and then you need to stand\nby that when when and stand stand an\nadvocacy for yourself during those times\nright so so when someone says oh you\nknow I I really wish that you reconsider\nit's like actually you know I'm really\nhappy with my my my track of studies I'm\nlike I'm looking forward to being a\nteacher and if they could persist in\nsaying well I I really wish you would do\nthis or that or you're not doing this or\nyou're not doing that you can simply say\nyou know I I'd rather not talk about it\nright now I'm I'm just enjoying the\nholidays I'm enjoying being here with\nfamily can we maybe figure out a time to\ntalk about that or or if you don't want\nto talk about it you can say you know\nwhat I've already made that choice so I\ndon't really see anything to talk about\nhere so depending on where you are with\nit but it's fine to put up a simple\nboundary of hey holidays I'm here to\nhave fun let's let's figure out a\ndifferent way to handle this or let's\nfigure out a different time to talk\nabout it or simply this is not anything\nI want to talk about right now exactly\nlike reminding people it's the holidays\nwe're not going to have I mean the\nholiday shouldn't be a time for like\nreally serious conversations there's a\ntime and a place I love that well it's\nabout reminding yourself that you always\nhave choices no feeling is inevitable\nright you feel depressed guess what when\nyou start to notice when you start to\nobserve what is there in your emotional\nfield what you'll find oh there's\nanxiety but then there's also Joy oh\nthere's excitement there's this there's\nthat so you have choices when it comes\nto feelings but we don't take the time\nto get present to understand okay I'm\ngetting pulled into somebody else's\nnegativity I'm getting pulled into\nsomebody else's anxiety because if\nsomebody's putting pressure on you\nthey're probably either feeling\npressured or they have something they're\nholding on to that's making them anxious\nI and it it's not required that you are\nliving in their anxiety with them that\nis not that's get a choice your their\nanxiety your anxiety is not inevitable\nand neither is theirs anxiety loves\ncompany but you don't have to take the\ninvite misy loves company but they're\nnot getting\nmine not going on that train not yeah\nand so then Joel Johnson asks how do I\nhandle this part of the year which is a\ndifficult time for me today is the 14th\nanniversary of my mom's passing my\ncondolences Joel I'm so so sorry I'm so\nsorry to hear about that and it's\ndifficult isn't it when we have when we\nhave memories when we especially when we\nhave close relatives that aren't here\nwith us anymore um and we have memories\nthat are painful you know Joel my my\nclients hear me say this all the time\nthe only way out is through but it\ndoesn't mean that it has to be a\nprotracted journey of pain when you go\nthrough something in a case like this\nwhere you have twinges of sadness and\nand and oh man it's it's it's it's going\nto be intense it's the holidays I I the\nway that I would go into it is I would\nhave a special ritual or a special day\nwhere I spend some time talking thinking\nto thinking about my mom remembering all\nof the things that gave me love that\nmade me feel loved that that that made\nme happy um you know thinking about her\nand then do some maybe maybe do\nsomething in her honor maybe you know\ndonate donate $5 to a charity that you\nlike or or maybe you know spend some\ntime if you both of you loved walking on\nthe beach and and both of you loved pie\nthen maybe one of your little rituals\nfor the holiday time is to go onor mom\nwith you know I'm going to walk on the\nbeach with Mom today and I'm going to\nget some pie at this place that we used\nto love and even write her a letter if a\nlot of emotion comes up for you write a\nletter to her you know and maybe that's\npart of the ual as well because when we\ncreate a ritual space and we create a\nspace of honoring another person we're\nnot going to cont we're containing our\nsadness we're finding a way to contain\nour sadness and we're giving attention\nto something in a way that's structured\nright so that helps us to emotionally\nregulate better right so but if we're\nnot doing anything specific then there's\nthat sadness that can just linger and\nkeep going and then pretty soon I'm just\nsad all the time now because I'm\nthinking thinking about mom all the time\nso um being finding creative and and\nhonoring ways to um have rituals to\nhonor the folks that we miss that have\npassed on can be something to help us\nfeel better and Elevate our mood during\nthe holidays so that the whole thing\ndoesn't feel that way I agree and I\nthink that you know your loved ones that\nhave passed away for anyone who's in the\nchat who's dealing with the passing of a\nloved one they'd want you to be happy\nand enjoy the holiday days I'm\nsure so absolutely I mean and that's the\nother thing is what would my mom want me\nto be doing right now what would make\nher happy right what would what would I\nmean I'm really unhappy that she's not\nhere I'm going to honor her presence but\nif she were here what would she tell me\nright yes and because sometimes we don't\ngive ourselves permission to have a good\ntime and this can happen at an\nunconscious level where oh I I'm\nsupposed to feel sad because mom's not\nhere I'm supposed to feel sad but but\nactually you get to be joyful during the\nholidays you don't always have to be sad\nyou can be happy when you when you when\nyou remember someone too right grief is\ncomplex it is complex and and it's\ndifferent for everyone so that's right\nthat's right and then the next question\nis from Khloe she asked how do I deal\nwith um feeling like I'm the one doing\neverything in a family when I have an\nolder sibling who never does anything\nbut then I can never get a break from\nchores and other things Chloe I'm sure a\nlot of people can relate to that I think\nthere's always someone during the\nholidays who has to do\neverything well hi Chloe thanks for your\nquestion I'm sorry that you feel are\nobviously feeling burdened with having\nto do so much I wonder two things one is\nyou know is there an opportunity to have\na conversation I'm a big believer in\nhonest and open communication so let's\nso so not knowing who's organizing or\nwho's hosting and you're feeling like\nyou have too much to do I would make it\nmore about what feels comfortable for\nyou rather than trying to be you know\nfeeling and and if you have anger or you\nfrustration because you feel like things\naren't Fair um that's a different\nconversation right I think that at this\ntime what first is important is to be\nhonest about what's comfortable for you\nto do if you're overextended and you\nfeel like you can't do as much then\ndon't you know put put a different um\nput a different offer out there you know\nlike you know what I I I thought I could\ndo um cooking and cleaning but I'm\nfinding that with all of the other\nthings I have going on I'm only able to\ndo this right um so so again reassessing\nyour boundaries being honest about\nwhat's what's going to be doable for you\nor not the other thing is is there\nanything that you do for the holidays\nthat brings you Joy that you do it\nbecause you love people you do it why\nyou know getting getting back in touch\nwith why we make the choices that we do\nrather than having our eyes on some\nsomeone else it's important to bring it\nback to why do I do these things you\nknow do I have any Joy here or do I oh I\ndon't maybe I'm maybe they're not very\nfun but I love I want to show people\nthat I love them so that's my motivation\nwhat is your motivation for doing things\nbecause when we forget the fact that oh\nyeah it was my choice to do this or oh\nyou know actually\nin some ways it feels good to do this\nbecause I I care about everybody having\na good Thanksgiving that can take that\nburden of you know off of us in terms of\ngetting embroiled emotionally in\nsomething that may or may not be true\nfor us maybe maybe there's other issues\nhere that are being highlighted between\nyou and your sibling that show up at at\nthe holidays because the holidays are\nloaded I mean that could be something\nelse not knowing your history but um I\nwould stick with you know what what it\nwhat my boundaries what's realistic for\nme to do am I feeling resentful because\nI'm tired or this is that I've\novercommitted um or you know and then is\nthere joy in some of what I'm doing\nconnecting back to our reasons for doing\nwhat we're doing so that we're not being\nin a reactive place but we're owning our\nchoices and we're really looking at what\nmotivates me in doing these things and\nthen if there is a deeper issue with\nyour sibling or if there is an issue\nwith I mean if under if you're like\nyounger and um living at home and and\nyou feel like the the the split of work\nis unfair then maybe that's something to\nbring up to one of your parents in a way\nthat highlights how you feel but in a\nway that you know you're not going to\nthrow the other person under the bus you\nknow so I don't know the nature of that\ndeeper issue that might be there with\nyour sibling but then addressing that\nyou know in a way that's more balanced\nso that you're not\nreacting about that situation during\nduring the holidays so thank you for\nthat doctor and then Delila asked um how\ndo I deal with my sister who likes to\nflirt with my husband during family\nreunions I'm dreading it this week wow\nDelila I'm sorry you have to go through\nthat yeah it's messy sometimes during\nthe holidays and then we add alcohol to\nthat or whatever and it can get out of\nhand pretty quickly now now I would be\ncurious excuse me Delila what a\nbeautiful name um I would be curious\nabout whether this is an ongoing\nbehavior that like like something that\nyou've seen trending over time or\nwhether this is something that in\nparticular comes up only around your\nhusband or um and and also I would be\ncurious about whether or not you've had\na conversation with her about this\nbefore or if it's something that you've\njust been noticing over time and now\nyou're hitting your limit with it um but\nagain I think that again in this\nsituation it's boundaries and\ncommunication you if you know that this\nis uncomfortable for you and a source of\ndread then you've got to lay lay down\nyour you got to draw your Line in the\nSand and you've got to go to your your\nsister your cousin or your or you know I\ndon't know if I heard that correctly\nsister her\nsister that's even more\nuncomfortable yeah that's even more so\nI'm always you know I look at things\nfrom a couple of different Vantage\npoints there's the immediate addressing\nthe immediate problem which is we need\nto have a hey let's have a talk and this\nis how this makes me feel and I'd I'd\nappreciate it if you'd if you'd show\nmore respect yeah um if it's happening\nanyway during the day and if it's\nimmediate then you know pulling her\naside and saying hey again this is not\nthis is something that makes me\nuncomfortable can you please watch how\nyou behave I'd really appreciate that\nright yeah um if it's a longer term\nproblem\nthan than needing to to really look at\nokay I I've mentioned this to you\nseveral times and now I'm in a space\nwhere I need to understand you know what\nis what is it that you're trying to show\nme or what is it that you're trying to\nreally kind of addressing the problem\nperhaps after the holidays in a in in in\na way that gets to the root of something\nif it tends to be a repeating behavior\num and and also making your husband\naware you know I don't know how much of\nthis is you also you know uh feeling bad\nthat your husband is is engaging in it\nagain communication boundaries and not\nand trying to come to our spouses not\nwith the you\nknow I I I I think it's important to not\nhave an accusing tone um if you know\nthat he's engaging in something and he's\npersisting then that's different but\nlet's say that this is really more about\nyour sister and maybe he really doesn't\nrealize that he's flirting with her or\nthat she's being a flirt then maybe\nmaybe it's just like hey you know um can\nI talk to you about something that's\nmaking me uncomfortable um I don't know\nif you know this or if you see it but\nyou know my sister flirts with you how\ndo I mean how do you feel about that or\ndo you see it yes right commun that\nbrings him into your experience without\nyou getting pissed and then reacting and\nthen you bring your husband into your\nreaction too we don't want to do that we\nwant to we want to be able to open the\nspace for hey curious right I think I\nthink if we're in a space of curiosity\nthen we can get his genuine response\nright oh yeah you know was she flirting\nwith him because he may not know he may\nyeah it may not be the husband's fault\nyeah right so we want be sensitive to\nthat too yeah and communication is key\nin this particular situation but also\nunderstanding that if your sister really\nis flirting with your husband it sounds\nlike a tension seeking behavior and\nmaybe like like it's like an underlying\nissue like it's like a symptom of like a\nbigger underlying issue so that's\nsomething to think about for sure yeah\nand I think whenever you have these\nkinds of of things that happen either\nwith family members or friends or\nwhatever especially since we're\ncontextually we're talking about the\nholidays today um that's why I'm saying\nto to kind of look at it at a couple of\ndifferent levels is this only is this\nholiday specific is this a new behavior\nthat I haven't seen before or is oh my\nGod here's that thing that she always\ndoes and I need you know I need to\nfigure out what the deeper issue is you\nknow because not everything May be a\ndeep issue and and some things might be\na deep issue that is showing itself\nworse during the holidays right so we\nneed to be sensitive to to kind of where\nwe're headed with with dealing with\nstuff yeah yes 100% I agree with that\nand um this was amazing thank you for\nall of our amazing viewers we had
