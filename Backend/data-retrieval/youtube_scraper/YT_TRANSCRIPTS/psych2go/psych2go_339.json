    "transcript": "[Music]\nborderline personality disorder comes\nwith a lot of misconception especially\naround dating but knowing whether or not\nsomeone has it or not can be quite\ntricky it is not a one-size fits-all\ndiagnosis BPD if untreated and unnoticed\ncan be rather harmful to the person with\nit and their relationships however it's\nalso highly responsive to treatment with\na high remission rate to explore this\nhere are six signs you may be dating\nsomeone with BPD what is BPD borderline\npersonality disorder is a cluster B\npersonality disorder which according to\nthe Mayo Clinic are a series of\ndisorders characterized by dramatic\noverly emotional or unpredictable\nthinking or behavior this can present in\na multitude of ways some may be loud and\nexpressive with their emotions whereas\nsome may direct it all inwards the\nsymptoms may be similar among different\nsubtypes however recognizing them can be\nrather difficult here are the nine\nsymptoms of BPD from rantic efforts to\navoid abandonment intense and Rocky\ninterpersonal\nrelationships unstable sense of self\nimpulsivity in at least two different\nareas that are\nself-destructive suicidal and self-\nHaring behaviors intense mood swings\nfeelings of\nemptiness intense and inappropriate\nanger stress related paranoia so what\nare some ways you can spot these\nbehaviors in real time let's talk\nabandonment the number one symptom in\nBPD is if you're of Abandonment an\narticle from verywell mind explains that\npeople with BPD are sensitive to and try\nto avoid abandonment whether it's real\nor imagined what constitutes abandonment\ncan vary and can be subtle for instance\nif they perceive your tone in a text\nmessage to be off they may think you're\nupset with them other ways people avoid\nabandonment is by people pleasing asking\nfor reassurance and excessively\napologizing the fear of Abandonment can\nbring out a lot of different emotions\nand behaviors maybe they'll do something\nReckless like spend excessively or drink\nalcohol Others May internalize the\nemotion and question themselves about\nwhat went wrong some may also get upset\nwith you and can even cut the\nrelationship off if they feel there's\nnothing they can do to make it better\nthe fear of Abandonment often leads to\nthe other symptoms in\nBPD they seem hot and cold BPD is tricky\nfor both the person experiencing the\ncondition and the one dating them one\nminute they treat you like your royalty\nand they adore you deeply and admire\nyour every move they seem to get you and\nunderstand you like no other this is\ncalled\nidealization and from their perspective\nthey really do think this however on the\nflip side they may suddenly turn cold\nthey may think that you're an uncaring\nperson and that all of your negative\nqualities are suddenly overpowering\nanything positive this is called\ndevaluation the switch between this\nidealization and devaluation is called\nsplitting splitting is triggered by by\nfeelings of Abandonment so leaving a\ntext message on red or having an\nargument this idea can manifest in many\ndifferent ways especially the\ndevaluation some people with BPD May\nyell at you and tell you exactly what\nthey feel others may go quiet and\nwithdraw from you in this case they\ndon't feel you're the bad guy but they\nare it's not always you they can also\nidealize and devalue themselves\ntherapist Ashley Jan says this can feel\nlike a yo\nyou're constantly bouncing back and\nforth and never know what side you'll\nget for the person with BPD they'll feel\nthis as well often with undiagnosed BPD\nthe person with it may not realize their\nmental health is a problem however\nknowing and understanding the illness is\nhugely beneficial in combating splitting\ntheir moods shift quickly having\nborderline personality disorder does not\nmean that you experience different\nemotions than everyone else it simply\nmeans that you sometimes experience\nstronger or more intense emotions than\nmany other people according to the\noptimum performance Institute this can\nmean that moods in BPD shift quickly\nespecially once the fear of Abandonment\nis triggered they may be having a great\nday but are quickly derailed by a missed\nphone call or an unpleasant interaction\nat work one of these mood shifts can\nlast just a few minutes but others may\ntake hours to return to a calmer place\nin an article by the clear viiew woman\nCenter they explain that people with BPD\nmay have perception shifts and feel that\neveryone hates them one day despite\nhaving a wonderful time the day prior\nbecause of these mood swings people with\nBPT are often confused with bipolar you\ncan have really high highs and extremely\nlow lows however unlike bipolar bpd's\nemotions are always changing and these\nchanges are dependent on the\nenvironment they have a history of Rocky\nRelationships as a symptom of BPD is\nintense and unstable relationships you\nmay find that your part partner has many\nstories they may often talk about their\nex- Partners in the worst light or\nexplain how they don't have many friends\nas a lot of them were toxic somehow they\nhave a lengthy history of being\nmistreated by others and perhaps this is\nthe case in the beginning this may seem\nlike a surprise after all how could such\na nice and loving person have so many\nenemies many symptoms in BPD can be\ndriving forces in this from splitting\nand erratic decisions to heightened\nemotions all can drive people away from\nthe person with BPD in some cases they\nmay feel like you're the only one that\ncan help them which the clear viiew\nwomen Center describes as being a\nvulnerable Seducer they may find that no\none understands them therefore they end\nup leaving relationships in the end in\nother cases people pleasing Behavior can\ncause those with BPD to take in people\nand hold on to them even if there are\nserious red flags this can lead to a lot\nof relationship turmoil that ends up\nalienating them in the end\nthe good news is that treatment is there\nBPD is a chronic mental health disorder\nand should be treated as such the good\nnews is that BPD is highly responsive to\ntreatment and the prognosis for it is\nbetter than many other mental health\nconditions in fact the clear viiew women\nCenter explains that when receiving\nproper treatment and awareness 90% of\npeople with BPD can achieve remission\nfor at least a 2-year period with 85\nkeeping it for at least four different\nforms of psychotherapy like dialectical\nbehavior therapy help increase\nmindfulness stress tolerance and\nacceptance which have profound effects\non the disorder with some hard work it\nis possible to no longer meet the\ncriteria for BPD it's possible to have a\nhealthy and fulfilling relationship but\nlike anything it's important to put the\neffort in and to make it that way we\nhope you were able to find this
