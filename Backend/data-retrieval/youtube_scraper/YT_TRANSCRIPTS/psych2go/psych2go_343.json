    "transcript": "- Hello, psych2Go viewers.\nThis is Michelle Rivas\nand I'm the host of Psychology Roundtable.\nOur amazing guest\nfor today's livestream is\nLouis Howes from the popular\nYouTube channel and podcast,\nthe School of Greatness,\nwhich has amassed over 3 million followers\nand a dedicated fan base.\nWelcome Louis. Thank you so\nmuch for joining us today.\n- Thanks for having me.\n- Glad to it. Absolutely. Thank you.\nAnd then I just wanted to\nmention that your background\nand story of success is so inspiring,\nand so I just wanted to start off\nby you having us have\nyou telling our viewers\na little bit about that and\nhow your past experience\nshaped your success.\n- Oh, man. Well, there's a\ncouple things here to, to,\nto dive into about this.\nOne is, most of my life I\nwanted to be successful be\nbecause I was very wounded.\nI had a lot of inner pain and challenges\nand struggle that I was facing,\nand I wanted to be successful\nso that I could be liked,\nseen and loved.\nAnd that pain, that wound drove me\nto take a lot of action.\nAnd those actions helped me\nget extreme results in sports.\nAnd then later in business,\nthe challenge is being driven\nfor success out of a wound\nnever brings anyone peace,\nharmony, and happiness.\nAnd so I was accomplishing this success,\nbut I wasn't feeling good.\nI wasn't feeling fulfilled,\nand I still didn't feel enough.\nAnd what I learned is, is that\nsuccess is really about me,\nand greatness is about going\nafter what you want to pursue\nin the service of others.\nInspiring, lifting up\nothers, entertaining others,\nhelping others in some way.\nAnd, and so I was achieving results,\nbut I want to call myself successful\nbecause I wasn't fulfilled.\nI wasn't happy until I\nlearned how to switch\nthe success into more service\nand greatness mindset.\n- That's amazing. And\nI just wanted to ask,\nso you mentioned a wound,\nand where do you feel like\nmaybe that wound stemmed from?\nWas it like a feeling of like\nmaybe unrealistic expectations\nbeing brought onto by your parents?\nOr maybe like trauma?\n- I mean, a combination of everything.\nI mean, when I was a kid, I\nwas sexually abused by a man\nthat I didn't know when\nI was five years old.\nSo there was a a, an abuse,\nan abandonment wound.\nMy, my brother went to prison\nas well when I was eight\nfor four and a half years.\nSo there was another\nabandonment wound there.\nMy parents were always\narguing and fighting,\nand even though I knew they loved me\nand my siblings, they\ndidn't have a good love for each other.\nSo there wasn't a good model\nof healthy conscious parenting.\nAnd it was either you\ndidn't know what you were\nto get each day.\nAnd so there was an abandonment\nor un a lack of safety\nand security there.\nI was picked on and made\nfun of all through school\nfor being dyslexic and being\nin the special needs classes.\nI couldn't read and write\nuntil I was, I don't know, 16.\nSo just a number of\ndifferent layers of things\nthat made me feel like I'm\nnot enough, I'm insignificant,\nI don't matter what's the\npoint of me being here.\nAnd again, that that wound\nor those layers of woundedness,\nabandonment, abuse,\nneglect, and how I\ninterpreted it as a child\nwith an undeveloped brain\nand undeveloped emotions\nand feelings, I interpreted\nthings to be extremely painful.\nAnd they were, because\nI didn't have the skills\nor the tools to heal.\nAnd it wasn't until I\nturned 30 where I started\nto learn those tools of healing\nand inner transformation to,\nto create meaning from the pain,\nto create meaning from the suffering,\nto create meaning from\nthe sadness, the sorrow,\nthe abandonment, the abuse,\nsexually, emotionally,\nphysically, all these different\nthings to create meaning\nas Viktor Frankl's man search\nof meaning talks about how\nto find meaning in that mess of our life.\nAnd to really transform it into harmony.\nIt doesn't mean it was any of it was okay.\nIt just means, and it doesn't\nmean it, it was your fault,\nbut it means it's your responsibility,\nhow you interpret it moving forward.\nAnd we can either allow our\npast to continue to haunt us\nand suffer until we die, or\nwe can choose to turn around\nand face these pains that\ncaused us from breakups\nor bullying or sadness or let down,\nor expectations that weren't met.\nWe can face them and we\ncan have a new relationship\nwith those pains, and we can\nthank them for the, the, the,\nthe lessons they taught us\nas tragic and horrible and\nand bad as some things are.\nWe can hopefully find\nmeaning in those messages.\nAnd if not, then we'll\njust suffer until we die.\nAnd so it's a just a choice.\nHow do we want to live our lives today?\n- Wow, that's so inspiring.\nAnd even at a young age, you were able\nto transform pain into\npower, even if you, you know,\nyou mentioned that like you were doing it\nbecause you felt like\ninsecure and all that,\nbut still, that's really inspiring.\n'cause a lot of people,\nif they witnessed things\nthat you witnessed, like\nyour brother going to jail,\nthey don't turn that into power.\nThey end up going to jail\nor they end up just following\nthat. So that's amazing.\n- Thank you. Appreciate it.\n- Yeah.\nAnd so in your opinion,\nwhat is the root cause\nof a person feeling\nunmotivated or even worthless?\n- I mean, there's a number\nof different things,\nbut one of it is, is not\nhaving a meaningful mission.\nAnd if we have no clear\ndirection of where we're heading,\nwe're gonna feel like, why am I here?\nWhat is my purpose? What, what's the point\nof my existence if I don't\nknow where I'm going?\nAnd it's just one thing.\nOne of the root causes I think\nlacking a meaningful mission\nand something I talk\nabout in my book about how\nto create that for yourself.\nAnd there's different seasons of life\nthat have different missions.\nYou know, just because you're not clear,\nif you're 22 years old on\nwhat you wanna do for the rest\nof your life, that's okay.\nBut figuring out what do you wanna do\nfor the next six months\nand just having a clear direction of\nwhere you're heading will\nsupport you not feeling\nlike you're worthless\nand, and unmotivated.\nThey'll give you direction to be motivated\nto overcome a challenge\nand, and search for a goal.\nI think another thing that, a root cause\nof us feeling unmotivated\nor worthless is the identity we choose\nto believe in about who\nwe are, about our past,\nand about our current identity.\nAnd our identity, as Tony Robbins\ntalks about, is everything.\nIt's the way we view\nand shape ourselves in the world.\nAnd if we have a negative\nthought about self\nand we constantly think\nand speak negatively\nabout how limited we are,\nwe're gonna have limited\nfeelings and emotions.\nThose are gonna be very draining.\nThey're gonna pull us down.\nAnd those feelings and emotions\nare gonna create behaviors\nthat are not positive, empowering,\ncourageous behaviors or actions.\nThey're gonna create cowardly actions.\nThey're gonna create a lack.\nThey're gonna create diminished, scarce,\ninsecure actions because we think,\nand we feel we are less than.\nAnd there's three main fears\nthat cause us to doubt ourselves.\nAnd I believe that doubt is the main thing\nthat holds us back from\nhaving everything we\nwant self-doubt.\nAnd we either have the fear of\nfailure, the fear of success,\nor the fear of judgment, other\npeople's opinions about us.\nAnd at the root, each one\nof us has one of those fears\nthat we're constantly overcoming\nor transforming at a\ndifferent stages, seasons,\nmissions in life.\nAnd if we are not overcoming this fear\nby being aware of it, embracing it,\nand taking extreme actions by facing it\nand overcoming it, then\nthe root of those fears is,\nI am not enough.\nAnd that identity that I am\nnot enough will always keep us\nin a limited state.\nIt won't attract abundance,\nit won't attract the right\nhealthy relationships\nand career, business intimacy.\nWe'll have breakdowns with family members\nand friends constantly because\nwe feel we are not enough.\nAnd therefore we will not\ncreate boundaries with self.\nWe will have limiting boundaries.\nPeople will walk all over us.\nWe'll feel like doormats,\nwe'll feel like we're getting\ntaken advantage of and abused.\nWe'll feel like we're, we're\npeople pleasing everyone, just\nfor people to like us and accept us.\nAnd all this is a downward spiral\nof holding us back from our true essence\nand our ultimate greatness.\n- Absolutely. And\nhow do you feel like this\nties into men's mental health?\nBecause I feel like a lot of\nthe times, it's not something\nthat we talk like as a\nsociety, we talk about,\nbut the unrealistic expectations\nput on men that men have\nto be a certain way, they have\nto be the provider, they have\nto be this, and I do\nthink it affects men more,\nit affects their ego and their pride.\nSo how do you feel like it ties into that?\n- Oh man, I'm gonna, I could\ngo down a long along rabbit\n- Rabbit hole\n- Here.\nI wrote a whole book called\nthe M of masculinity,\nwhich is about the mask that\nmen wear to try to fit in\nand belong in society.\nThe pressures, there's pressures from\nboth, you know, men and women.\nObviously we all have certain pressures\nand things that we get to live up\nto based on society's standards.\nThere was a book, gosh,\nI'm forgetting the name\nof this book, but there was\na book about 10 years ago,\nI think it might've been called Like A\nMan's World, I can't remember.\nBut it was a, a woman who decided\nto become a, a man for,\nI think it was a year\nor two years, God, I'm\nforgetting the name of this book,\nand where she, she dressed like a man.\nShe identified as a man,\nshe got a career at a high\nsales position, you know,\nan executive sales position.\nShe would only hang out in men's groups,\nand she was able to look\nlike a man enough to\nwhere no one knew the difference, right?\nYeah. Based on her\nphysical characteristics.\nShe would go on dates\nwith, with women. Oh, wow.\nAnd she, and she would have\na life as a man, right?\nShe transformed the way she\nlooks, you know, she, she kind\nof neutral, was a neutral\nlooking human anyways.\nAnd so, okay, she had short hair,\nshe had the characteristics\nthat would make it look like a man.\nYeah. And in her book, it was\na New York Times bestseller,\nI'm gonna get the the\nname of it later for you,\nbut in her book, the New\nYork Times bestseller,\nshe did interviews about this afterwards.\nIt was fascinating. And\nshe said, the pressures\nthat a men feel were overwhelming.\nWhen I was a man for a\nyear, I felt suicidal.\nI felt extremely depressed\nwhen I would go on dates\nwith women and they would\nlook at me with one look\nthat could cut through\nmy heart and my soul\nand make me feel like\nnothing with one stare.\nAnd I, and she was like, I\ncan only imagine what men go\nthrough constantly in career,\nin home life, and all\nthese different things.\nNow, you could say the\nsame thing for women\nwith different standards and pressures,\nbut when,\nwhen men in society in general\ndon't feel like they have a\nplace to heal, don't feel\nlike they have a place\nto talk about their feelings,\ndon't feel like they have a\nplace to share with another guy,\nfriend, or in a group setting,\nit just means they're\nbottling up their emotions\nand they're suppressing and\ntherefore wearing a mask to try\nto act like everything's okay.\nWhereas more common in society,\nwomen gather together as\nfriends over lunch or breakfast,\nor go for walks.\nAnd they talk more about\nthe challenges they allow\nthemselves to release\nthrough communication.\nAnd so when men don't release\nthrough communication,\nthey release in other ways\nmore harmful ways, alcohol,\naddiction, drugs, pornography,\nto try to feel a sense\nof calm, to feel a sense of,\nah, let go of this pressure.\nAnd that usually ends up into\nbad things happening for them\nand the people around them when\nthey get addicted to things\nthat are not good for them.\nSo, again, and I'm not saying\none is has a, you know,\nworse than others, but there\nare certain levels of pressures\nand demands that if men aren't\nable to take responsibility\nfor them in a conscious way,\nto find support in a healthy way\nand not feel shameful about it,\nbecause they, they get shamed a lot\nfor talking about these things.\nAnd when they can feel supported,\nthen they can transform that as well.\nAnd it's, again, I'm not saying\nmen are victims or anything,\nbut they are responsible for it.\nAnd, and it's, it is helpful to have\nsociety stop shaming men for\nwanting to be vulnerable.\n- And that's the main difference, right?\nLike both women and men have struggles.\nThey have pressures put on them.\nBut the difference is our\nsociety has taught us that, like,\nwomen can cry about it,\nwomen can have emotions,\nwomen can talk about it and go to therapy,\nbut sometimes women and societal\nand cultural expectations tell you\nmen aren't allowed to do that.\n- Exactly. Yeah.\n- Exactly. Yeah.\nAnd like as if emotions\nor talking about your\nfeelings is a weakness.\n- Yep. And that's just kind\nof had been the society\nstandard for a long time.\nSo my goal is to support people by,\nby showing them it's okay to be vulnerable\nby talking about these things openly.\n- And on the topic of just\nfeeling like, you know,\nmaybe like worthless\nor not feeling like you're\nmeeting expectations,\nhow do you feel like social\nmedia perpetuates this?\nBecause I feel like in this\nage of social media, women\nand men see things on Instagram\nabout, you know, they see,\nyou know, they don't\nhave enough followers,\nor their life isn't as\nluxurious and glamorous.\nAnd how do you feel like\nthis perpetuates the feelings\nof worthlessness that many may feel?\n- Two things, one comparison\nis the thief of joy.\nI can't remember who said that,\nbut that's, that is definitely,\nwhen you're constantly desiring\nsomething you don't have,\nyou're not gonna feel happy.\nAnd happiness is really about\nappreciating what you have\nand really enjoying what you have\nand not being completely\nunhappy with what you lack.\nAnd I'm not saying we\nshouldn't be striving for\nmore opportunities, experiences,\ntrips, things like that.\nBut some of the greatest\nthings that I've experienced,\njoy, we're completely free.\nWe're just dancing, we're\nplaying, we're being with friends,\nwe're, you know, free activities.\nAnd so it's allowing\nourselves to not be fooled by\nthe material world so much and find peace\nand harmony in play, fun connection\nand things that are mostly free.\nThat's one thing is just\nnot getting tied up into\nyour self-worth determined\nby your net worth or your physical things.\nThere's a lot of people I've\nmet who have lots of money who\nI don't really want to hang out with\nbecause they're, they're self-worth\nor they, they lack\nkindness and just decency.\nThey lack the ability to just be generous,\nkind, fun human beings.\nAnd so, just 'cause they\nhave physical things\nand a lot of money doesn't\nmean they're valuable as\nbuilding fun relationships with.\nThey might be also,\nbut it doesn't mean\nit's exclusively mutual.\nSo that's one thing. The second thing is,\nyou know, if you're going to\nplay a game in social media,\nyou are gonna get criticized\nand shamed no matter what you do.\nAnd the bigger you're following,\nthere's gonna be more pressure\nfor shame and criticism.\nYeah. I've seen more people be shamed\nand criticized over the last\nthree years than I've ever\nseen, because global crises\nhappens and people's\nemotions get so extreme\nfrom, I'm just the last few\nyears alone from Covid to,\nwhat's your opinion\nabout covid and vaccines?\nYeah. You know, and,\nand to every four years,\na political election and,\nand you're right and wrong.\nAnd you should be doing more of this to\nany social justice movement, to anything\nthat's happening bad in the world\nto any war that's happening.\nAnd if you have a, any type of platform,\nif you have a thousand followers\nor 10 million followers, you're\nsusceptible for being shamed\nand judged and criticized by lots\nof different people on lots\nof perspectives, wanting you\nto say the right thing and\nsay it every single day\nand make this your full mission\nas opposed to who you are\nand what you're doing in your life.\nAnd you're gonna be criticized\nand shame no matter what you do.\nIf you write a book, you're\ngonna be criticized and shame\nand get people saying good\nstuff and negative stuff.\nAnd you're gonna get criticized by people\nthat don't even read it or don't even\nread open the book one time.\nExactly. And you're just gonna be,\nyou know, this will happen.\nThis is human nature to criticize\nand complain about other\npeople, what they're doing.\nEven if they have the best of intentions,\nyou will get judged and shamed.\nAnd if you have low self-worth,\nif you have low self value,\nthen it will hurt you extremely.\nI remember when I was\ngetting online, I don't know,\n15 years ago, maybe longer\nthan that, in 2004, 2005, kind\nof starting when Facebook was coming out\nand I was just getting\ninto this space I remember,\nand Twitter in 2008, 2009,\nI remember taking things\nso personally when people would\ngive me negative criticism.\nAnd I realized, wow, I\nhave a lot of work to do.\nAnd it, and it's a journey.\nSo learning to not take things\nso personally by knowing\nwho you are, your identity\nand making sure your identity is clear\nwill give you more peace when\npeople are attacking you.\n- Exactly. But how does\nsomeone find the inner power\nto not seek validation from others?\nBecause that's really hard. And I mean,\nI feel like social media\nis built on that, right?\nSo how do you, what has helped\nyou not seek validation from\nothers or accept, don't your acceptance.\n- Don't post things\nabout your, your looks,\nyour body, your bank account.\nDon't post things about\ns outwardly things,\npost things about service, post\nthings about your character,\npost things about how you show\nup in the world, post things\nthat are in service to others\nthat are helpful to others.\nPeople are still gonna\njudge and criticize.\nBut when you sh you're\nshowing self constantly\nand you want validation\non how you look or,\nor something outward physical,\nit's just never going to attract the right\nvalidation you're looking for.\nAnd you're always gonna\nbe self-critical, oh,\nwhy didn't this perform well?\nOh, maybe I didn't look good,\nor maybe I wasn't the right angle.\nOr maybe I need to do more of this.\nThen we filter more and more\nthings to get more validation.\n'cause we still don't have that\nlove for self that we need.\nAnd so when we have that love\nand self care, I mean, in that inner care,\nwe don't care as much\nwhat other people think\nthat are not our friends and\nfamily in our inner circle.\nAnd when you have a grounded inner circle\nof close friends\nand community, that means you've\ngotta invest in those people.\nYou've gotta show up for them,\nyou've gotta be generous to them.\nYou've got to be a good friend to others\nand be a good friend to yourself.\nAnd not needing to be friends\nwith everyone in the world,\nbut the right people.\nYou don't need the validation of thousands\nor millions when you get\nthe validation of yourself\nfor doing hard things consistently and\nand being your word consistently\nto yourself and others.\nAnd you get validation\nfrom the people around you.\n- Exactly. And you attract\nwhat you are. Right.\nSo if you develop a strong\nsense of empathy, compassion,\nkindness, then eventually\nyou'll attract that. Yes,\n- Exactly.\n- Awesome. And so that brings\nme to our viewer segment\nwhere we answer your audience questions\nfor our amazing experts.\nAre you ready, Louis?\n- I'm ready.\n- Awesome.\nOkay, so first question is from Clark.\nClark asked Louis, I'm\nhaving trouble in school\nand I'm even having trouble\ngetting a girlfriend\nright now that I'm in college.\nWhat are some strategies to\neliminate negative thinking\nand intrusive thoughts about failure?\nBecause I honestly feel worthless.\nWow, Clark, thank you for sharing that.\n- I mean, Clark, I, I\nremember in elementary school,\nmiddle school, high school\nfeeling completely insignificant.\nLike no girls liked me.\nI felt like I was six feet,\nfour inches when I was 12 years old.\nSuper skinny and like you're\nsix foot 4, 6 4. Yeah.\nOh, and I was, but I was,\nbut I was a foot taller\nthan everyone at 12\nyears old, but Oh wow.\nSuper skinny, bony, big\nears, you know, big teeth\nand just goofy.\nAnd I was in the special needs classes.\nI'll give you a story, Clark.\nWhen I was in fourth grade, my teacher,\nwe had probably had a classroom\nof like, I don't know,\n40 kids let's say.\nAnd my teacher said, okay,\nwe're all going out to recess\nand we're gonna play a a dodgeball game\nand I'm gonna pick two\ncaptains in the class\nto pick the teams and then\nwe're just gonna have fun\nand play dodgeball.\nAnd the two captains went around\nand picked all the guys one by one first.\nAnd then they skipped me\nand they started picking\nall the girls one by one.\nAnd then I was the last pick.\nSo this was, I was a fourth grader,\nI was a pretty athletic kid,\nbut I was just picked last\nafter all the girls.\nAnd I remember just thinking,\nman, no one likes me.\nNo girls like me, guys\ndon't like me, I'm a loser.\nI'm stupid in school. Like\nwhat's the point of this?\nAnd here's what I can\nsay Clark, is that if you\ndon't focus on the hurt\nfrom girls rejecting you\nor feeling less than,\nor whatever it might be,\nbut you focus on the good that\nyou're doing every single day\nto improve and overcome the\nchallenge that you're facing,\nyou will be rewarded tenfold very soon.\nSo one of the things you can do is say,\nhow can I optimize my health?\nMy health should be number one priority.\nWhat can I do every\nday that makes me proud\nthat I'm taking care of my health?\nCan I go for a walk? Can I go for a jog?\nCan I go to the gym?\nCan I do it consistently\nby being my word?\nWhen you do that, you're going\nto start attracting more\nhealthy things in your life when\nyou neglect health.\nBecause when I was stressed out\nand overwhelmed, all I\nwanted to do was eat sugar\nand buckets of ice cream every day.\nOh yeah. Been that made me\nfeel good. Made me feel good.\nYeah. But that doesn't\nattract good energy, right?\nIt feels good in the moment,\nbut it doesn't attract\nwhat you want as well.\nSo we've gotta learn to have discipline,\nwhich is extremely hard\nwhen you feel insignificant.\nIt's one of the hardest things to do.\nBut we are all tasked\nwith a challenge in life.\nThere is no good story\nwithout a good challenge\nthat the hero eventually overcomes.\nAbsolutely. So you've gotta\nthink about yourself as, okay,\nI'm the hero in a story of my life\nand this is the journey\nthat I'm on right now,\nand here are all my obstacles in my way.\nAnd it seems overwhelming and daunting\nand like I'm never gonna find a girlfriend\nand no one's ever gonna love me.\nBut I'm telling you, at 38 years young,\nafter failed relationships,\nstruggles and heartache, year\nafter year, I'm finally engaged\nand I have a harmonious,\nloving relationship.\nOne that I could never even dream of,\nbut there were things that\nI needed to let go of.\nAnd as a slow learner,\nit took me many years\nto overcome them and learn them.\nSo Clark, be patient with yourself.\nI'm telling you, I remember\nas a 20, 21 year old feeling like,\nthis is never gonna work out for me.\nAnd it, it shouldn't take you another 20\nyears like it took me.\nBut I'm telling you, good\nthings are gonna come\nto you if you're willing\nto address the challenges\nand overcome them.\n- We need to get that quote\non a shirt, what you said,\nwe need to be the own, our\nown heroes in our life.\nThat's amazing. That is so true.\nOnly you can save yourself.\n- Yes.\n- I love that.\nOkay, our next question is from Christie.\nHe asked Psych Togo,\nif you're reading this,\ncan you ask Lewis if he has\nany advice for CSA survivors?\n'cause my story is very\nsimilar to his ACSA survivor.\n- I'm not sure what that abbreviation is.\n- Well, let me, let me look it up.\nI wanna answer this question for Chris\nbecause he, he asked that, so CSA\n- Might be sexual abuse.\nSexual abuse, I'm not sure what C Yeah,\n- I believe it's child\nsexual abuse. Yeah. Oh\n- Yeah.\nChild sexual abuse. Well,\nI wrote a whole book about,\nyou know, again, again\ncalled the M of masculinity,\nwhich is, kind of talks a\nlittle bit more about this\nbecause when I was 30, I opened up\nfor the first time about\nbeing sexually abused\nas a five-year-old boy.\nAnd I remember for 25 years having a lot\nof pain in my heart.\nAnd this kind of memory would\nalways flash through my mind\nand I would feel taken advantage of\nand abused throughout life.\nAnd it would kind of go back\nto that as one of the stories\nthat was an anchor.\n'cause I never learned to heal\nor talk about it in a healthy way.\nAnd each person who has been\nthrough childhood sexual abuse\nhas their own unique story\nand their own unique pain\nand challenge to overcome.\nFor me, the thing\nthat has supported me the\nmost is having therapy\nand therapies and therapeutic\nexperiences to allow me to\nrelease it from my body.\nBecause there's a great book called\nThe Body Keeps the Score.\nIt's, it stays that trauma,\nthose wounds stay trapped\nsomewhere until we allow it\nto meal, amend and heal.\nAnd being able to talk about\nit allows you to release it\nand start the process of releasing it.\nNow, I'm not saying you\nshould talk about it publicly.\nI don't, I don't actually advise that\nunless you feel like\nyou're called to do it\nand you're ready to do it.\nBut find a therapist, find a\nspiritual counselor, a priest,\nsomeone that you can be guided by\nto support you in your process.\nI actually wouldn't\nrecommend being vulnerable\npublicly until you feel\nlike you have some stability\nwith the conversation\nwith yourself privately\nor with someone else.\nBecause, you know, it's just\na very sensitive, emotional,\ntraumatic experience for anyone\nwho's been sexually abused.\nAnd I feel peaceful 10 years\nafter talking about it and\nprocessing it and healing it.\nBut healing is a journey.\nIt's not this destination\nthat you're gonna have one conversation\nand feel healed forever.\nIt's a, it's an ongoing\nprocess and journey.\nSo take it easy on your\nheart, forgive yourself and,\nand find a trusted individual\nwho has experience in this\nand be guided in that process.\n- Thank you Lewis. And thank you\nChris for asking that question.\nOur next question is from Amber.\nShe asked, I lost both my\nparents last year while being a\ncare giver.\nLemme read a second for them.\nI'm still having a hard\ntime grieving feeling like\nI didn't do enough for them.\nHow do I get past this? I'm\nsorry, Amber. My condolences.\n- Yeah, I lost my father\nlast year as well.\nAnd it's, it was definitely\na, a very sad year\nof learning how to grieve.\nAnd there's still moments\ntoday where it's, again,\nthere there's a lot of sadness, especially\nwith the holidays coming up.\nIt's, it just sucks.\nThere's, there's nothing that I can really\ndo for it, not to suck for myself.\nHowever, the things I focus on.\nFirst off, I would recommend\nthe grieving process to go\nthrough with a counselor, a\ntherapist as well, someone\nwho can walk you through that process.\nThere's an amazing,\nthere's a couple amazing books out there.\nGosh, I, I'm trying to\nremember the name of it.\nI'll to think of the, the\ngrieving one that I found before.\nBut there's a couple of great\nbooks that can help guide you\nwith these different step-by-step\nprocesses of journaling\nand reflection and, and\nhealing for yourself.\nBut I just think finding someone\nto support is always the best thing to do.\nAnd not doing something hard\non your own will support you.\nSo having friends, family,\npeople you can talk to\nthat you trust to support\nyou in that guidance.\nAnd grief is a journey.\nI don't think it's\nsupposed to be, you know,\none month and I'm okay.\nIt's a, it's an ongoing journey\nof processing and acknowledging.\nSo that's what I would say.\n- Thank you for that Lewis.\nAnd then looking for a\nfew questions to ask.\nSo let's,\n- I do have something, while\nyou're looking for questions,\nI do have something from\nthat I think might be helpful\nfor people just in general as a framework.\nAnd, and, and I'm,\nI'm hearing more people asking\nquestions about how to kind\nof process grieve and heal\nthrough these different traumas.\nAnd I have kind of a framework\nthat I wanna walk people\nthrough from my book.\nThe Greatness Mindset. Yes.\nWhich, which is all about healing.\nThis whole book that I recently\nwrote is all about healing.\nWhat is it called? It's, it's\ncalled The Greatness Mindset.\nIt was a New York Times\nbestseller this year. I love that.\nAnd the first third of the\nbook is all about healing.\nI'm, I'm always doing a\nTrojan horse for people.\nI, I, I'd say you want greatness,\nbut you've gotta heal first.\nYes. Walk through it.\nThere's, there's on page 2\n0 1, there's a framework.\nSo I'll just explain\nwhat this framework is.\nAnd there's two different\ntypes of mindsets.\nThere is a powerless mindset\nand let's call it more\nof a limited mindset,\nyou know, underneath.\nAnd then there is a greatness mindset.\nGreatness is not about success,\nbut greatness is our highest self.\nSo we have a lower self mindset,\nwhich is feeling more powerless.\nI feel helpless. I can't find\na girlfriend, no one likes me,\nI'm stupid, I don't, you\nknow, I have all these traumas\nand triggers and I feel\nlike, what's the point?\nI don't have clear direction.\nThat's more powerless,\nthat's more limited.\nSo if you're feeling\nany of that right now,\nI'm gonna talk about how to transform that\nto feel more empowered\nand be in your highest self,\nbe that hero on the journey.\nAnd overcoming challenges.\nSo there are six things that make us feel\npowerless or limited or not enough.\nAnd those six things, based on 10 years\nof research from all the top experts\nthat I've had on my podcast, the School\nof Greatness comes down\nto these six things\nthat hold people back from\nfeeling more powerful.\nNumber one, people lack\na meaningful mission.\nAnd when we aren't sure of\nthe direction we're heading,\nit doesn't mean we have to know\nwho we're gonna be for\nthe rest of our lives.\nBut if we're not sure where we're headed,\nat least in the near future,\nwe're gonna feel limited and powerless.\nYou might have lots of\nskills, you might have lots\nof options or you might have no options.\nBut if you're not clear\nwhere you're heading right now this\nseason, you're gonna feel limited.\nThe second thing is, if we\nfeel like we are controlled\nby fear, again, I talked\nabout the three things\nthat hold us back, that make\nus doubt ourself the most is\nthe fear of failure, the fear of success,\nand the fear of judgment.\nOther people's opinions.\nSo if we are controlled by this fear,\nwe're gonna feel powerless and limited.\nSo we must learn what our fears are\nand how to overcome them.\nI talk about all these\nthings in this book.\nThe third thing is when\nwe conceal past pains.\nSo if someone has gone through\nCSA childhood sexual abuse for 25 years,\nI concealed that pain.\nThat wound was trapped inside of my heart,\nmy soul, and my body.\nAnd it made me feel powerless.\nIt made me feel like I was worthless.\nAnd it, it caused me to act\nand react based on a wound.\nIt caused me to get angry\nand scream when I was a kid.\nWhen I was frustrated,\nit caused me to do things\nthat I wasn't proud of.\nIt caused me to be out of integrity\nor try to fight people all\nthese different things in my\ntwenties because that wound was there.\nSo if you conceal past pains,\nyou're gonna feel powerless.\nIf you're crippled by self-doubt if,\nsorry, I already said that one.\nIf you're are defined by\nthe opinions of others.\nSo this goes back to your\nquestion in the beginning\nabout social media.\nWhen we are defined by people's\nopinions of us, comments\nof us, criticisms of us,\nwe're gonna feel powerless.\nSo don't put stuff out there\nunless you're okay with\npeople criticizing.\nDon't be defined by that. We feel limited.\nAnd the last thing is when\nyou drift towards complacency,\nthis kind of connects\nto not being clear on\nwhat your meaningful mission is.\nBut if you have a mission\nand you're just drifting,\nif you're not focused on it\nintentionally, consistently,\nyou're gonna feel limited and powerless.\nAnd if you want to transform this\nand step into your higher\nself, your more unlimited self\nor your greatest self, then we've got\nto be driven by a meaningful mission.\nNot something that's to\nhurt people or to look good,\nbut something that is of\nservice of others as well.\nWe've got to learn to turn\nour fears into confidence\nbecause a lot of us feel like\nwe lack confidence and it's\nbecause of the fears\nthat define our identity.\nWe go back to identity.\nAnd when you can become a person\nwho overcomes your scariest fears,\nyou feel like the most\nconfident person in the world,\nyou can take on anything.\nSo we've gotta learn\nto identify our fears.\nI talk about creating a fear list\nand how to go through\nthose in the book as well.\nWhen we overcome our\nself-doubt, again, one\nof those three big fears,\nwhen we overcome that doubt,\nwe step into greatness.\nWhen we heal past pain,\nthat means we're not wounded\nfrom the past, we faced it,\nwe've done something challenging\nthat has held us back.\nWe feel lighter, we feel harmony inside\nand we can take action when\nwe create a healthy identity.\nYou know, a lot of people\nspeak so negative about self\nand we and we say horrible things to us,\nto others about us\nand don't allow positive\nthings to come to us.\nSo learning how to shape our\nidentity in a healthy way\nand taking action with a game plan.\nAgain, a lot of people\ndrift towards complacency.\nThey don't have a game plan.\nJust creating a list of\nhere's what I'm gonna do today\nor this week or this month\ngives us that game plan.\nSo I've got the whole process on page\n2 0 1 of the book for people.\n- That's amazing. And the\npowers within us, right?\nIs, you know, I think that's\nthe gist of it, right?\n- I think it is. And I also\nthink we shouldn't be doing,\ntrying to do anything alone.\nYou know, I have a lot of\ncoaches, I have a lot of people\nthat I lean on that mentors\nguides that I seek wisdom from.\nYes, the wisdom is within me.\nAnd I also know that to accelerate\nyou can't do it all alone.\nSo I find a lot of support.\n- And that means also seeking treatment\nand a therapist if needed\nas well. Absolutely. No shame in that.\n- Yeah, absolutely.\n- And so I wanted\nto address Carmella's questions.\nShe asked, how can you help\na friend who is suicidal?\n- I think you gotta make a\nrecommendation to send them to\nsuicide line, to a suicide specialist.\nThere's treatment centers of people\nwho are going through suicide.\nI think the best way\nyou can support them is\nto love on them, to support\nthem, to show up for them,\nfor tell, you know, to check\nin on them to say, Hey,\ncall me if you're ever feeling anything\nthat's gonna hurt you or\nanything like that, call me.\nLet's stay connected.\nThere is also something that\nyou, you know, I know people\nwho have unfortunately\nlost people to suicide\nand I have two family members\nwho committed suicide.\nTwo uncles actually committed\nsuicide when I was younger.\nAnd there can also feel like a burden\nor weight if you're always showing up\nfor someone who's in fight or flight\nand in suicidal thoughts.\nSo there's, you've gotta\nalso protect your energy\nand create boundaries\nwhile also being a friend\nand being there for them,\nbut also making sure they\nhave professional support,\nthey have professional\ncounseling of someone\nwho can guide them to, to get out of that.\n'cause it can feel daunting.\nSo make sure you're taking care\nof self while you are\nshowing up for others\nand getting them the support they need.\n- Thank you Lewis. And then,\nI'm not sure if I'm butchering your name,\nbut Boem has asked, and I think\nthis is an amazing question.\nIt's funny you mentioned support.\nI feel like my support system\nis very sporadic outside\nof a therapist I see every few weeks.\nHow do I build a more\nconsistent support network?\nThis is a great question.\n'cause sometimes people\ndon't know how to build\nthat strong support system.\n- I think you've gotta show\nup for others just as much\nas you want them to show up\nfor you in a lot of ways.\nAnd you can't just ask\neveryone to support you\nand you not support others.\nYou can't just say, I need support,\nI'm helpless, everyone, help me.\nYou've gotta be willing\nto put yourself out there\nand have the courage to give to others.\nTo be generous, to be a, a\nkind human being and say,\nand check in and text someone\nand say, Hey, lemme know if\nI can help you with anything.\nOr say, Hey, I'd love to\ncatch up and and hang out.\nYou know, if you're\njust asking for support\nbut you're not giving, you're being more\nof a taker rather than\na giver and a taker.\nAnd I think, you know, putting\nyourself in communities\nand activities that are\nfun for you, that surround,\nare surrounded by other people as well.\nWhether it be hobbies,\nactivities, games, you know,\ndifferent things in your town or online\nor whatever it might be that you enjoy\nwhen you're living in joy.\nYou find and attract other\npeople who like similar things\nwho find joy in that as well.\nAnd joyful people want to be\naround other joyful people.\nNo one wants to be around\nsomeone who's dragging them down.\nYep. So you've gotta support yourself\nby doing things you enjoy\nand love attracting others who\nenjoy those things as well.\nFinding commonality\nand being a support for\nthem the best that you can.\n- Absolutely. And that\nconcludes our audience segment.\nAnd so I just wanted to leave our viewers\nwith this last question,\nLewis, from your experience,\nhow can a positive outlook\ntransform your mental health?\n- I look at life as not\ngood or bad, but neutral.\nAnd someone might say,\nwell how could you say\nthat when there's a lot of\nhorrible things happening in the\nworld, when there's wars,\nwhen there's injustices,\nwhen there's extreme suffering.\nAnd when you're in that suffering,\nit's hard to have that perspective.\n'cause all you feel is\npain, sadness, and loss\nand unfairness, extreme\nunfairness when you're able\nto get out of that and see how that\ncould potentially give you\nsome type of insight, lesson,\nwisdom, or something in\nthe future to benefit you.\nYou know, again, again I go back\nto Viktor Frankl's man's\nsearch for meaning.\nHe somehow found a way to\nfind peace from the sadness\nof millions of lives lost in the Holocaust\nthat he was, that he endured.\nAnd he somehow found a way to\nlove and appreciate his life\nand reflect on it all the\npain and all the sadness\nand all the loss and\nsuffering and injustice.\nAnd he chose to interpret things\ndifferently after it happened.\nHe chose to interpret the\nmemory so that it could benefit\nand make a positive impact\nin the rest of his life\nas opposed to him suffering\nand the people suffering\naround him even greater.\nAnd I think when we\nhave a positive outlook,\nit doesn't mean we should just say, oh,\neverything's fine all the time.\nWe should acknowledge\nwhere things are at currently\nin our personal lives,\nin our friends' lives in\nthe world when there is pain\nand suffering and and face it\nand do our best to overcome it.\nBut also when we look\nat life as the blessings\nthat we have currently,\neven in this extreme sadness\nthat could be happening,\nthen I just think it gives you\nmore harmony and more peace.\nAnd when you can either be\nstuck in a negative mindset\nor a negative outlook\nor a positive outlook.\nAnd when we choose to focus\non a positive outlook,\nnot bypassing the pain,\nbut reflecting on the pain\nand still finding a way to find peace\nor something that's good\nin some area of life,\nthen it brings us more harmony\ninternally, which allows us\nto manifest more what we\nwant in our life currently.\n- So practicing gratitude to an extent.\n- A hundred percent.\n- Absolutely.\nWell thank you so much\nLouis, for your amazing,\nbrilliant insights and a big thank you\nto our amazing viewers at Site Togo.\nWe just appreciate you so much\nand thank you for asking\nLouis these amazing questions.\nI hope everyone has an\namazing week. Bye. Thanks.\n- Thank you."
