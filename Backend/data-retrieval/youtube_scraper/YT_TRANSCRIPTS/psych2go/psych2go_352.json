    "transcript": "for almost all my life I have been\nlonely growing up I didn't have many\nfriends and had trouble creating\nmeaningful relationships with others I\nlived with my mom and sometimes she\ncould be emotionally unavailable and\ndistant it was kind of awkward and\ndifficult connecting with her on a\npersonal level then I found myself\navoiding it just because that was easier\ndespite this I knew that as a single mom\nshe worked hard she picked up extra\nshifts at work just so we had food on\nour table\nI felt guilty for you and feeling like\nmaybe she wasn't enough\nso on my 18th birthday I was really\nsurprised to see the house decorated\nwith streamers and balloons and neatly\nwrapped presents on the couch I never\ngot this many presents you usually it\nwas something small like a notebook or a\npack of pencil crayons\nI felt over the moon when I asked my mom\nif we could afford all this stuff she\nsaid that I shouldn't worry and that I\ndeserved it so I opened all my presents\nshe bought me a beautiful dress makeup\nand even a new phone\nwhen I went to thank my mom she said\nthis isn't all go get ready for your big\nsurprise\nI was shocked what could be as great as\nall the stuff she already bought me and\nI did as she said though putting on my\ndress and playing around with my new\nmakeup when I came downstairs I was\neager to see what the next surprise\ncould be\nshortly after the doorbell rang I didn't\nthink much of it when my mom told me to\ngo answer it I thought it was the\nmailman or maybe a neighbor my stomach\ndropped when I saw about six or seven\ngirls my age standing at the doorstep\nwith smiles on their faces sleeping bags\ntucked under their arms I recognize them\nas some of the more popular kids at my\nschool and distantly wondered how my\nmother persuaded them to even come\nI remember I used to be friends with\nthem before my dad left but that was a\nlong time ago and it was like they were\nnew to me again my mom came out and said\nsurprise a sleepover birthday party for\nyou I didn't know what to say I just\nslammed the door in their faces I was\nterrified I always kept to myself at\nschool afraid of being judged and\nvulnerable I thought it was just easier\nto be independent and trust myself only\nbecause that was safest when I saw all\nthese faces people I didn't know\nI kind of freaked out I got really angry\nat my mom because she didn't care that I\nwas nervous around new people\nto give some context some things had\nhappened to me in my early childhood\nwhich made me more introverted\nwhen I was about 10 years old I lived\nwith my mom and dad in a beautiful home\nthey would spoil and love me which was\nall 10 year old me could ask for life\nwas perfect for a while until my mom and\ndad started fighting it started with a\nlittle bickering then escalated to huge\nfights that would last through the night\nI thought I could handle it because I\ntruly saw it coming but I guess nothing\ncould prepare me a little innocent\nsheltered girl for the day my father\nabandoned us it was my mother and I who\nleft\nI was devastated and so confused about\nhow this happened so suddenly after that\nthings went downhill for a few years I\nbecame more secluded and isolated myself\nfrom others my father's betrayal made me\nwary around others my mother also took a\nsevere left turn she tried to put a\nsmile on her face though I couldn't\nignore the bottles and her heavy\ndrinking every night\nshe numbed her mind and became super\ndistant from me so I had to Wade through\nmy early teenage years alone it was\nexhausting and only fueled my loneliness\nthankfully years later\nshe reigned in her bad habits though I\nknew they weren't completely gone\nwhen it was just me and my mom she\nbecame really strict and didn't allow me\nto see my friends too often she said\nfriends just stab you in the back\nfirst this annoyed me I would always ask\nher to have friends over and she always\nsaid no I would only see people at\nschool and then be locked in my pretty\nprison for the rest of the day As I Grew\nOlder I stopped trying since I was\nstarting to lose a lot of my social\nskills and seemed to prefer being alone\nI told myself my mother was so strict\nbecause she was still broken too back to\nmy birthday I was still upset I was also\nsurprised because she never invited\npeople like this\nshe didn't care though and just let them\nin\nat first I was still annoyed and Afraid\nit was weird and new having friends over\nand I I didn't know how to act\nafter spending a bit of time with them\nthough it turned out the girls were\nactually really nice\nwe had a lot of fun and spent the night\ntalking and playing games\nsoon it was close to midnight and my mom\nwas fast asleep we started talking about\nparties and I reluctantly admitted that\nI had never been to one they were\nshocked and said that we could go to one\ntonight if I wanted to which would mean\nsneaking out\nI should have been scared but the idea\nthrilled me in a way too\nso we got ready and slipped away through\nthe window in my bedroom being as quiet\nas possible\nat first I was a little nervous I mean\nthis was my first party but the girls\nactually stuck by me and helped me\nloosen up a bit I started to dance and\nhave fun and we danced through most of\nthe night it was so amazing talking to\nnew people and seeing how Lively and\nbright a room could get it showed me\nwhat I had been missing all this time\nand it helped me break through my shell\na bit being alone for so long showed me\nhow precious they can be to spend time\nwith others\nfor once I wasn't worrying I was just\nenjoying myself with all these people we\ndanced for what felt like forever\nbefore people started running and\nscreaming to get out of the house I\nheard police sirens and immediately\ngathered at my friends and we all rushed\nback home\nthrilled at the fact we got away\nadrenaline coursing through our blood we\neasily climbed up to my window and I was\nshocked at what I saw my room was\ncompletely trashed books clothes makeup\neverything was sprawled everywhere\nI rushed to my door to open it fearing\nsomething had happened to my mother only\nto see her standing on the other side\nWide Awake as if she'd been waiting for\nus mom what happened\ngesturing at the messy room frantically\nshe stared at me blankly for a moment\nbefore she started screaming she told me\nI was a disgrace that I was an\nembarrassment to the family\nand of course I felt terrible and guilty\nmy mom put in a lot of effort for my\nbirthday and I just Twisted all her good\nintentions\nthis Behavior wasn't like me at all\nI apologize profusely but it it didn't\nseem to work and she only got angrier\nI had never seen her like this so it\nstarted to scare me\nthen suddenly she said get out of my\nhouse I never want to see you again\nI was shocked and my heart immediately\nshattered into a million pieces\nI wanted to beg her to forgive me but I\ncouldn't believe that she was kicking me\nout over this\nI didn't say anything though as I packed\na few things gathered my terrified\nfriends and we left\nmy friends offered to let me stay over\nat their house but after the disaster\nthat was tonight I didn't want to burden\nthem anymore so I insisted they go home\nand dialed my aunt's phone number\none of my only relatives who lived\nwithin 20 minutes and told her what\nhappened\nI let out a little sigh of relief when\nshe said she'd be right over\nI hadn't seen my aunt since my dad left\nbut I had always liked her and how calm\ncalm steady she was my aunt picked me up\nand she seemed nervous and worried I\nassumed her nerves were just from the\nsudden severity of my situation\nas we were driving\nI get a text from one of my friends from\nthe sleepover when I read it my jaw\ndropped\nit was my mom who called the cops on the\nparty and there were pictures of her\nyelling at terrified kids to get out\nshe looked crazed and frantic\nI was so mortified how did she even find\nus\nwhen we finally got to her house I was\nready to collapse onto the bed and go to\nsleep\nbut I jumped when I saw a silhouette in\nthe living room\nI thought it was maybe my aunt's friend\nbut I was shocked when I clicked on the\nlight and saw someone I hadn't seen\nin eight years\nmy dad at first all I could do was stare\nat him I hadn't seen him in so long and\nit was like he had never changed I was\ntransported back to those years ago the\nlast time I felt truly happy but then I\ngot so angry\nhe left us and he had been here this\nwhole time and I yelled at him I told\nhim he didn't care about us and that he\nwas a terrible person\nit took them a while to have me calm\ndown\nand I really didn't want to\nit was too much hurt and pain for one\nnight\nhowever I eventually calmed down\nand my dad slowly told me he was so\nsorry and that he had an explanation\nwhat my dad said next completely changed\nmy life and perception of everything\nhe said that my mom and dad lived\ntogether happily until she started\nchanging\nshe started becoming more obsessed with\nmoney and material things\nshe was also struggling with addiction\nand he tried to help to see what he\ncould do but she didn't care\none day my dad's at work and my mom\ndecided to steal all of my father's\nassets and money and take off with me\nthe situation quickly spiraled my dad\nlost custody of me and my Mom filed a\nrestraining order against him\nhe was left so off balance after her\nbetrayal that\nhe had to move in with his sister\nhe also said that my mother always got\njealous of other success she probably\nthought that the sleepover would make me\neven more dependent on her when I\nrealized I hated having people over\nexcept the exact opposite had happened\nso the sight of others being the source\nof my content set her off\nshe was angry that she wasn't able to\ncontrol the situation that's why she\nreacted like that and why I was never\nallowed to see my friends and grew up so\nintroverted\na lot to take in after processing it for\na while\nI realized I learned so much about\nmyself and was able to confront my\ntrauma through this experience\nit showed me how much I actually want to\nbe with other people\nI decided to believe my dad and moved in\nwith him and my aunt it was different\nand slightly difficult to settle into\nbut once I did I was so happy he let me\nhang out with my friends and meet new\npeople I no longer had to sneak out\nbecause my dad and I built a foundation\nbased on trust\none day my dad and I eventually went\nback to my old house\nonly to find it empty\nthe house was mostly trashed but we did\nnotice that my mom's passport suitcase\nand clothes were gone\nmy mother had fled perhaps she knew that\nI would find out her theft and do\nanything to get Justice for my dad\nwe raced to the police and told them\neverything about her stealing from my\ndad and her nature this experience\nhelped me realize how important it is to\nmeet new people and that I hated being\nalone my whole life I was so dependent\non only my mom that I was blinded\nmissing her true colors my mom had such\nan iron grip on me for 18 years that I\nforgot how much I really love\nsocializing until my eyes were opened\nagain\nas I grow older I meet more people and\nlearn a lot about the world going out\nand meeting new people doesn't have to\nbe scary it can be a lot of fun and\nsuper exciting\nmy mother's betrayal was probably the\nmost heartbreaking thing that ever\nhappened to me\nhearing the truth however\nhealed me in unexpected ways I can\nblossom and learn so much now that I'm\nfree"
