    "transcript": "[Music]\nhey SE goers welcome back to our channel\nare you an introvert extrovert are you\nan introvert who's curious about what\nqualities might be more compatible with\nyour introverted self or maybe you're an\nextrovert who has an introverted partner\nwhat might they need from you in a\nrelationship well here are six things\nintroverts need in a partner number one\nsomeone who is comfortable with\nsilence sweet silence is there anything\nquite like it to some extroverts silence\ncan be intimidating or awkward but\nintroverts don't always want to spend\ntheir time talking sometimes just being\nin the same room as their partner makes\nthem feel happy and connected so while\nyou may be having a cozy dinner together\ndon't worry if there's a long pause\nwhile eating your delightful Cuisine\nthey might just not feel like talking at\nthe moment but value spending time with\nyou or the food's just really good Less\nTalk More eating number two a good\nlisten\nare you a good listener who doesn't love\nsomeone who can be there for them when\nthey need to vent or are having a tough\nday some active listening and\nreassurance can go a long way especially\nfor introverts why do introverts value\ngreat listeners well since they don't\noften open up to strangers or\nacquaintances they spend most of their\ntime talking with their closest friends\nand loved ones especially their Partners\nintroverts can spend a great deal of\ntime in their head coming up with\ninteresting ideas and theories who are\nthey going to tell these theories too if\nthey tell anyone it's likely that it's\ngoing to be a loved one or their partner\nwhich is where you come in both of you\ncan listen and share your thoughts with\neach other and if there's a bit of\nSilence afterward no problem number\nthree someone who values quality time do\nyou enjoy quality time introverts may\njust want to spend some of their days\nwith you doing simple things and really\ngetting to know you in the process\nperhaps you'll both go on a walk\ntogether or have a calm day of shopping\nand browsing the markets a simple\nevening hanging out with your family and\nGood Old Uncle Joe perhaps you'll spend\nyour mornings having tea and baking\nbiscuits good combo whatever it is you\ndo the simple quality time together can\nbe just as good as the exciting and busy\ndays out number four someone who\nunderstands personal space and alone\ntime do you enjoy your alone time as\nmuch as you may love your partner\nsometimes you just got to be alone\nintroverts often need time alone to\nrecharge their energy can sometimes get\ndrained quickly when socializing with\nothers or spending more time in crowded\ngroups so in return perhaps at the end\nof a long day they just need some time\nto unwind and relax if you notice they\nwant to spend some time alone in their\nroom one day and are wondering if you\ndid something wrong ask yourself this\nfirst did you recently do something that\nmay have upset them or are they just\nbeing an introvert who doesn't love some\npeaceful time alone ah recharging\nnumber five a love for deep\nconversations who needs Small Talk to an\nintrovert small talk can be a great bore\nit's not great but it is greatly boring\nit may make them simply feel a bit\nawkward having to force a bit of small\ntalk when someone initiates the dreaded\ncan you believe this weather instead\nthey value the deeper conversations they\nhave with their partner talk about your\nideas your goals what you enjoyed about\nthat film that book that trip don't be\nafraid to hold back the inner thoughts\nof your mind that keep you Restless in\nthe wee hours of the night let them out\nyou may find you both have something\nelse in common so if you're not often\nlooking to talk about deeper things than\nthe weather then well you may have a\nstormy relationship ahead see what I did\nthere huh no oh and number six someone\nwho can take things slow at first when\nyou start a relationship do you want to\ntake things slow some relationships move\nfast one minute you're exchanging\nnumbers the next year moving in together\nand introducing them to your old uncle\nnamed Joe why is Joe always around\nintroverts May simply need more time to\nopen up to others they want to feel\ncomfortable in your presence before\nopening up about what truly makes them\nthem so go on a few casual fun dates\nhang out together get to know each other\nand in due time you may just be moving\nin together and meeting Good Old Uncle\nJoe so do you have a crush on
