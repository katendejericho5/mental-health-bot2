    "transcript": "[Music]\nwhat makes someone attractive we all\nknow it's not just about looks or Charm\nthere's a certain Gena that draws us to\ncertain people according to the\nUniversity of Queensland brain Institute\na lot of that attraction comes from our\nPrimal lyic system in the brain and\nbiological Anthropologist Helen Fischer\nPhD explains that we can indeed Overlook\na great number of problems in our\npartner or Crush because of how powerful\nthat lyic system is in fact our brains\ncan decide if someone is a potential\nmate or not within the first 3 minutes\nof meeting them so what subtle traits\nand behaviors influence our attraction\nin those 3 minutes there are quite a few\nfor one there's a certain confident\ndemeanor you know the one we're talking\nabout it's not just acting confident it\nis truly being comfortable in your own\nskin without the need for validation\npsychologists have long known that\nsimply believing you're attractive\nregardless of if you're conventionally\nattractive can increase how much you're\ndesired a 2013 study in the journal\nevolutionary psychology explains their\nfindings on the matter stating that\nself-perceived attractiveness\nself-confidence in appearance and body\nesteem all significantly predicted\nself-esteem and that in each case the\nrelationship was mediated by romantic\nself-confidence basically High\nself-esteem and self-confidence can\nresult in confidence in the romance\nworld this doesn't mean you need to\nplace your confidence all un\nconventional attractive features if you\nwant to create that confident demeanor\nin yourself look out for what you truly\nlove about yourself create your own\nbeauty standards based on you your own\ntraits features quirks and skills you\nfind unique and valuable that demeanor\nwe talked about it comes from not\nneeding validation and being comfortable\nand positive with who you are it's\nsomething in you not something you can\nmimic from someone else it's often found\nthrough learning learning about yourself\nand exploring who you are so why is\nconfidence seen as so sexy many\npsychologists have predicted why\nresearcher Shawn Murphy PhD explains\nthat a lot of the things we want in a\npartner are difficult to observe\ndirectly especially on first meeting\nthis includes traits like competence\nDrive social status and kindness so we\ntrust that people know themselves well\nand assume that their confidence or lack\nthereof reflects their actual values as\na partner\nthis isn't to say confidence is the only\nthing you need to attract your crush\nsome psychologists argue that attractive\npeople also don't often put too much\nweight on the end goal of dating which\nmakes them all the more desirable\ninstead they enjoy the process of\ngetting to know someone and don't beat\nthemselves up if the mutual attraction\njust isn't there so before you start\nimagining your honeymoon to Hawaii with\nyour crush maybe enjoy your coffee date\nfirst often we're so focused on the end\ngoal that we miss out on the process or\nsimply stress over it people can\nsometimes read this anticipation or\nstress and may even feel manipulated or\nrushed into something clinical\npsychologist Randy Gunther PhD explains\nthis further stating that the outcome\ntherefore is determined by the process\nitself and not plotted out ahead of time\nthe desired partner of a sexy person\nnever feels coerced or manipulated into\na situation he or she did not seek or\nrealize was a manipulated process\nremember relationship should be organic\nand can fall into place naturally\nthroughout getting to know each other\nwithout the pressure of expectations or\noutcome having no strong expectations on\nyour date means it may be easier to let\nloose and have fun according to\npsychologist Randy Gunther sexy people\nare playful they're having fun with the\npossibilities of connection but enjoy\nthe process rather than needing to\ncomplete it Gunther also has a great\nidea for if you're out with friends and\ndon't have a romantic partner she\nexplains theide idea that sexy people\nenjoy dancing alone until they have a\npartner already having a great time\nwhether the other person chooses to\nparticipate or not another interesting\ntrait that is bound to attract others\nbeing open-minded and a non-conformist\nin one 2015 study in the journal\nPersonality and Social Psychology\nbulletin researchers found that success\nin the dating world were greater the\nmore non-conformist their sample was\nthey also found that perceptions of\nnon-conformity in and next partner were\nassociated with greater love and\nattraction toward that partner being\nopen-minded and kind is something that\ncan unfortunately be overlooked by\nothers but it is valued in a healthy\nrelationship one 2008 study even found\nthat altruism may just attract your\ncrush Science Daily summarized the\nUniversity of Nottingham study stating\nthat displays of altruism or\nselflessness towards others can be\nsexually attractive in a mate in three\nthree studies of more than 1,000 people\nresearchers discovered that women play\nsignificantly greater importance on\naltruistic traits than anything else\nwhen looking at what overlooked traits\nare seen as most attractive perhaps we\nrealize that we should put less focus on\nthe end goal of attracting our crush and\ntheir validation and instead look\ninwards being comfortable in your own\nskin by Learning To Love Yourself takes\ntime but it's these learn traits that\ncan take the pressure off yourself in\nthe world of dating they're seen as\nattractive because people themselves\nwish to attain these qualities but more\nimportantly these learn traits help give\nyou the attention and understanding you\nneed from the person you need it from\nthe most you it's really a win-win\nsituation not only may your crush be\nswooning over you but you may just be a\nlittle bit more attracted to yourself in\nthe process love yourself too if you\nenjoyed this video don't forget to click\nthe like button and share it with a\nfriend or Crush subscribe subribe to
