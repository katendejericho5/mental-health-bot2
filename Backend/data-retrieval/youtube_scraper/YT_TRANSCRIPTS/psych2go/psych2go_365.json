    "transcript": "everybody says just be yourself like\nit's easy\nwhat about when you don't know what it\nfeels like to be yourself or when the\nworld has shown you it's not safe to be\nauthentic\nas a trauma Survivor past traumatic\nscenarios continue to run through your\nmind and you are constantly on the\nlookout for those likely in the future\nthis way you try to avoid further trauma\nbut this is preventing you from being\npresent in the moment so there's no room\nleft for being authentic\nthe ability to tolerate being vulnerable\nis necessary to being authentic and\nTrauma can steal that capacity away says\ntherapist Robin e Brickell if you can\nrelate to this I want you to know that\nyour feelings are valid and may lead you\nto a trauma response so to help figure\nout if you're being fake due to\nChildhood trauma keep watching\nblend in for safety\ntrauma tricks you into thinking that\nit's your fault or that you could have\ndone something to prevent it a lot of\ntimes these inaccurate beliefs lead to\nshame so you seek protection in whatever\nway possible\nmaybe you went from rocking vibrant\ncolors and prints to wearing dark\noversized hoodies and sweatpants as a\nway to camouflage into your surroundings\nor you transitioned from being bubbly\nand voicing your opinion to doing\nanything to blend in and stay quiet\nof course there's absolutely nothing\nwrong with being quiet or rocking dark\noversized clothes but if these choices\naren't aligned with your authentic style\nor voice it may be a sign of trauma\naccording to therapist Robin Brickell if\na trauma Survivor believes they did the\nwrong thing which resulted in there\nbeing traumatized they might feel like\nthey have to blend in to stay hidden or\nact in a certain way to protect\nthemselves\ndisconnect\ncan you relate to only having fragments\navailable of the most difficult times in\nyour life or not remembering something\ntraumatic occurred until years later\nthis can be because those feelings and\nmemories may not have been integrated\ninto your brain when faced with a threat\nyour heart rate increases and your\nmuscles are supplied with more blood in\nthe event running becomes necessary\nwhen this happens less important bodily\nfunctions temporarily shut down as the\nbody readies itself for fight or flight\nexplains therapist Douglas Mitchell\ntraumatic events are also inherently\nthreatening says clinical psychologist\nDr Amy Hardy a 2016 research discusses\nthat traumatic events activate the\namygdala responsible for biological\nprocessing of fear to initiate the\nbehavioral reactions required to deal\nwith threats in those moments your brain\nhad to de-prioritize the parts that deal\nwith thinking memory and emotions\nif you don't have access to specific\nmemories or feelings it would only make\nsense that it would affect your ability\nto be authentic\nunderstanding this is important because\nit shows that it's not your fault that\nyou have trouble accessing emotions\nfawning\nsometimes it's necessary to be agreeable\nand please your abuser to survive\nthis is the trauma response fawning\ncoined by psychotherapist Pete Walker\nWalker saw fawning as the fourth F of\ntrauma responses fight flight freeze and\nfawn when you respond by fawning you try\nto defuse the conflict and harm they\ninflicted On You by surrendering your\nown needs for theirs traumatic\nexperiences can understandably change\nyou because you are shown that having\nyour own needs or beliefs wasn't an\noption\npassive aggressive\nwhat happens when you can't directly\nconfront someone abusing you the only\nsolution can sometimes be indirectly\nchallenging them like being passive\naggressive explains pediatric psychology\nfellow Daniel Flint\npicture this it's your first year of\ncollege and you rented a town home with\nfive other students\nit's been going really well but you\nfound studying difficult when they have\ncompany over late at night and blast\nmusic instead of confronting the issue\nhead on and talking to them do you leave\nsubtle hints that it makes you\nuncomfortable\nif confrontation scares you and it feels\nsafer to be passive aggressive your\nbehavior may be rooted in feeling scared\nin a hostile home environment as a child\nperfectionism if you were attacked with\nabusive words it's understandable that\nyou would be overly careful with your\ncomments and avoid causing others the\nsame pain you experienced or if you were\nalways nervous about coming home from\nschool because you didn't know what mood\nyour parents would be in you're going to\nwant to be as calm or as people have\naccused you as stoic as possible\naccording to clinical psychologist Amy\nHardy your coping strategies to survive\ntrauma can manifest as PTSD symptoms a\nstudy from the international Journal of\nmental health and addiction found that\npatients who presented with\npost-traumatic stress disorder had\nhigher levels of socially prescribed\nperfectionism to regain control\nwhile on the outside people may accuse\nyou of being fake because you're too\nuptight and don't know how to be real\nwhat they fail to understand is that\nit's not your intent is you need a sense\nof safety and predictability in your\nlife\nif you can relate to these signs you\ndeserve compassion for everything you've\nbeen through and how your brain has had\nto adapt for survival if you've had to\nlearn skills that sacrificed your\nauthenticity I want you to know there's\nno expiration date to becoming true to\nyourself with therapy and\nself-compassion you can find Healing\ncan you relate to these signs let us\nknow below and if you found this video\nhelpful please give it a thumbs up
