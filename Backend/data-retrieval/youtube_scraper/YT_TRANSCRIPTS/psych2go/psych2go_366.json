could have\ndone differently or things that could go\nwrong\nstaying present isn't easy especially\nwhen you've been through trauma or\nstruggle with anxiety\npracticing mindfulness can help you live\na more fulfilled happy life by being\ntotally in the moment and stopping your\nmind from wondering now I know what\nyou're thinking sigh you can't just\nrewire your brain actually according to\nresearchers Davis and Hayes your brain\ncan rewire itself when you have a new\nexperience because of something known as\nneuroplasticity you can change the\nstructure of your brain by practicing\nnew habits like mindfulness regularly\nso why should you worry about being\npresent and mindful here are four\nreasons why mindfulness can be your\nsuperpower let's go number one\npsychological flexibility according to\nDavis and Hayes when you take a step\nback and notice your thoughts in an\nobjective way you can temporarily\ndeactivate neural Pathways that were\nformed from your past experiences as a\nresult you'll have more psychological\nflexibility and can respond based on\nwhat is happening in the moment instead\nof automatically reacting the same way\nyou have in the past by using\nmindfulness you can adapt to the\nsituation you're in in fact according to\nan article published in the Journal of\npsychotherapy mindfulness mediation\nactivates parts of the brain that helps\nwith adapting to high stress situations\nlet's use an example Sarah is having a\ndisagreement with her partner her first\ninstinct is to get angry and defensive\nbecause in the past arguments with her\nex always got heated quickly\ninstead of automatically reacting she\ntakes a few deep breaths becomes aware\nof her thoughts and notices how they are\naffecting her emotions\nshe brings her attention back to a\npartner to focus on what they're saying\nthis time Sarah listens intently and\nresponds calmly because Sarah is\npracticing mindfulness she can\ncommunicate better remain present and\nregulate her emotions Sarah's situation\nis just one example of how mindfulness\ncan improve communication in\nrelationships\naccording to an article published in the\nacademic Journal Psychotherapy people\nwho scored higher in mindfulness are\nmore satisfied with their relationships\nbetter at dealing with conflict and more\nempathetic they also have less anxiety\nand anger during an argument allowing\nthem to respond compassionately instead\nof getting caught up in their emotions\nnumber two stopping the avoidance cycle\nif you've ever been through a traumatic\nexperience you might be familiar with\nthe rebound effect this is when you try\nto suppress a thought or avoid a\nsituation but the thought comes back\nfrequently and more intrusively the\nrebound effect leads to a behavioral\nLoop where you try harder and harder to\navoid the thought or situation and Bam\nit comes back stronger each time a study\nby Fula and colleagues suggest that\nmindfulness is beneficial in trauma\ntherapy because it helps clients let go\nof fear and acknowledge their thoughts\ninstead of suppressing them which stops\nthe avoidance behavioral Loop according\nto researchers Goodman and Calderon one\ntechnique that is suggested for clients\nin trauma therapy is repeatedly thinking\nabout an image that brings them comfort\nas they go about their day like your pet\nor the sun whatever comforts you by\ncontinuously focusing on an image that\nrelaxes them in a traumatic scenario\nthey can increase feelings of safety and\ndecrease negative
