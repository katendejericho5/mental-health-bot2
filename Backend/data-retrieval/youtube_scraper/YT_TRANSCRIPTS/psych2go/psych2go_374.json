others it\ncan significantly influence people's\nattitudes and it's one of the most\ncommon reasons people become interested\nin Psychology what is it exactly that\nmakes someone so attractive which of\nthese traits do we look for in a friend\nor partner according to psychology here\nare eight of the most common things that\nmake a person\nattractive number one confidence Studies\nhave shown that confidence is the most\nattractive quality a person can have\nwhen someone is confident you're less\nlikely to second guess yourself and you\nknow and believe in your value people\nnotice when someone is confident in who\nthey are and what they believe in and\nalthough it's it's common to imagine\nsomeone who is confident as outgoing and\ncharismatic confidence can also be quiet\nknowing your worth believing in your\nstrengths and taking pride in who you\nare is what makes you confident\nregardless of if you're outgoing or not\ntwo\navailability availability is an\nimportant factor in how much we find\nsomeone attractive despite the common\nbelief that we need to act distant or\naloof to make people we like interested\nin us the opposite is actually true when\nwe're developing new relationships it's\nimportant to find someone who can\nphysically and emotionally be there for\nus and the more responsive attentive and\nreliable someone is the more we will\ncome to value our relationship with them\nthree\nuniqueness although there are 7 billion\npeople in the world each of us is unique\nin our own ways no one looks talks acts\nthinks or feels in exactly the same way\nand that's what makes us so amazing but\nsome people prefer to hide their\nuniqueness to fit in when we learn to\nembrace what makes us special whether\nit's our looks experiences ideas or\nlittle quirks we open oursel up to the\npossibility of meeting new engaging and\nlike-minded people number four kindness\nkindness is a quality that lots of\npeople want in a friend or romantic\npartner in a study done by Baskerville\nand colleagues in the year 2000 they\nfound that people tend to like people\nwho showed more kindness sympathy and\ncompassion than those who showed lesser\nlevels of kindness at the end of the day\nwe all want to be with someone who\ntreats us as well as we would like to be\ntreated five intelligence intelligence\nis attractive because it often leads to\nstimulating conversations deep insights\nand a new way to look at the world a\nrecent study in 2018 by psychologists\nginak and others found that for most\nparticipants there is a particular IQ\nscore that maximizes an individual's\nattractiveness but any higher would make\nthem seem less desirable in other words\npeople are attracted to those they\nperceive as more intelligent than them\nbut not so much that they become too\nintimidating or Out Of Reach to talk to\nsix passion next is Passion the\nenthusiasm and desire to achieve a\ncertain goal people who are passionate\ntend to be driven determined and\nself-motivated but more importantly they\nhave things that matter a lot to them\nand that they care about significantly\nthey have an interest in Big Dreams that\nappeal to The Optimist in all of us\nwhich can Inspire us to push ourselves\nto be better as\nwell seven a sense of humor research has\nshown that we tend to be more attracted\nto the people who make us laugh possibly\nbecause it shows cleverness wit and\ncreativity so it should come as no\nsurprise that having a good sense of\nhumor ranks high on the list of\ncharacters people look for in an ideal\nfriend or partner in heterosexual\nrelationships women in particular\ngravitate towards men they find funny\nwhile men favor women who are playful\nand goodh humored and number eight their\ndemeanor last but not least is our\ndemeanor while it's no secret that a\nperson's looks have a lot to do with how\nattractive we find them there's a lot\nmore to it than someone's physical\ntraits psychologists have found that it\ntakes us only 30 seconds to decide\nwhether we find someone attractive and\nour demeanor can make or break someone's\nimpression of us the way we dress act\nand carry ourselves also plays a part in\nhow people perceive us when meeting new\npeople it can be helpful to take note of\nthese things as they can make a world of\na difference while it's common for us to\nbase attractiveness off a person's\nphysical traits attractiveness can\nactually be more complex than that and\nthough we all have different ideas of\nwhat makes someone more or less\nattractive these are some of the most\ncommon and widely agreed upon traits so\ndo you agree with the things we've\nmentioned in this video do you also find\nthese traits and qualities attractive\nleave us a comment down
