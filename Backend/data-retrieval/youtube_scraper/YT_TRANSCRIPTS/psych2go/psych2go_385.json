please watch until the\nend a colleague of ours shared how\nfollowing and disregarding his intuition\nforever changed his life hi Psy to goers\nthanks for joining us today today I want\nto try something new and give you guys\nboth a listicle story and a personal\nstory of a team member which will be at\nthe end of the video please leave in the\ncomments Below on which one you related\nto\nmore number one childhood bonding\ngrowing up with my grandparents and\nrelatives during my father's business\ntrips allowed me to form a deep and\nspecial bond with them these\ninteractions shaped my upbringing and\nself-development in profound ways number\ntwo the gift of intuition through\nspending extensive time with my loved\nones I developed a unique Intuition or\nsick sense I could feel their emotions\nmental state and even their health\nregardless of the distance between us\nnumber three distress energy whenever I\nfelt sick or encountered issues my\ngrandmother would sense my distressed\nenergy even though my family had\nmigrated to a different continent her\nintuitive connection prompted her to\ncheck on me ensuring my well-being\nnumber four dreams as warning signs As I\nGrew Older I started experiencing dreams\nthat partially foresaw the Future these\ndreams became my warning signs guiding\nme through life's\nuncertainties number five preventing\nGrim\noutcomes in some instances my dreams\nhelped me prevent or delay certain Grim\noutcomes by heaing the messages they\nconveyed I was able to take necessary\nactions to change the course of events\nnumber six notifying the inevitable\nhowever there were times when my dreams\nsimply notified me of the inevitable\nignoring these messages only led to\nregret later on emphasizing the\nimportance of listening to my intuition\nnumber seven emotional connection Beyond\npredicting events my intuitive\nconnection allowed me to deeply\nunderstand and empathize with my loved\nones I could sense their emotions\nproviding comfort and support during\nchallenging times number eight\ncherishing moments the gift of intuition\ntaught me to cherish every moment with\nmy loved ones it reminded me of the\nfragility of life and the importance of\nexpressing love and appreciation while\nwe still have the\nchance number nine trusting the\nintuition over time I learned to trust\nmy intuition and embrace its guidance it\nbecame a powerful tool in navigating\nrelationships making decisions and\nfinding my purpose in life number 10 a\nlasting Legacy the intuitive connection\nI share with my loved ones even after\ntheir passing continues to shape my life\ntheir presence lives on through the\nlessons they taught me and the bond we\nformed reminding me of the power of love\nand\nconnection in conclusion the intuitive\nconnection I developed with my loved\nones has been a profound and\ntransformative experience through dreams\nand epiphanies I have learned to trust\nmy intuition cherish moments and\nnavigate life's challenges with a deeper\nunderstanding of the connections that\ntranscend time and\ndistance my grandmother was always the\nclosest to me we had a special bond and\nhonestly I still feel that Bond and miss\nher deeply before she passed away I\nurged my father to go visit her or let\nme go because I could feel like she\ndidn't have much time left father\ninsisted he would go first and\nI reluctantly agreed grandmother also\nknew she insisted that at some point I\nmust come see her one more time as if\nshe knew she didn't have long to live\nthen one day I woke up in the middle of\nthe night feeling very sad I called\nfather to check the situation and he\ninformed me my Grandma had already\npassed away I only followed through my\nintuition halfway I used it to assist my\nfather in spending the last moments with\nher yet my father denied me the\nopportunity to have much final needed\nmoments with my\ngrandmother now I will forever live with\nthose regrets wondering the what\nifs in retrospect if someone doesn't\nintend on following their intuition\ncompletely then they might as well not\nfollow it at all for me it only deepened\nthe pain and the\nregrets fast forward a few years my\nother grandmother became Afflicted with\nAlzheimer's dementia ishemic strokes\nthis time I followed through with my\nintuition again through messages I\nreceived during my REM sleep I took time\noff and spent the last two years of her\nlife with regular visits so I could make\npeace with that and now that my\ngrandfather is dying I will once again\ntake that time off to be there during\nhis last moments however long we\nhave during our busy lives we often\nforget what's really important to us and\nwhat our actual priorities are but it's\nalways important to identify them and\nfollow through events and possessions\nthose come and go\nbut once our loved ones are gone they\nare gone\nforever if you've learned anything from\nthis please keep that in mind and make\nyour choices\naccordingly we must treasure the people\nwe love while they're still around and\nlearn from our experiences and Trust our\nintuition and
