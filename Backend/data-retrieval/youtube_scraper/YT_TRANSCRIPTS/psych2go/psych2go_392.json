continue to sink deeper into this\nnegative mental health space this is why\nlearning signs that you may be\nstruggling with your mental health is so\nimportant in fact a 2007 study found\nthat mental health literacy was one of\nthe four ways to lead to more positive\nmental health outcomes enough said here\nare five signs you're battling mental\nillness number one emotion and\npersonality inconsistencies\nhave you noticed yourself doing some odd\nthings maybe your friend has pointed out\nsome things you've said or done that\naren't totally on brand\nthis could take the form of changes in\nmood perhaps you know yourself to be\ncalm and even tempered but lately you've\nbeen feeling irritable or anxious most\nof the time maybe you experience extreme\nhighs or bouts of Joy but also extreme\nlows or episodes of deep sadness or\nanger\nit can also look like laughing at\ninappropriate moments or feeling\nextremely angry at small inconveniences\naccording to the Mayo Clinic emotions\nthat feel excessive or disproportionate\nto the matter at hand can also be a sign\nthis can include excessive anxiety fear\nanger guilt sadness or happiness when\nnot completely appropriate\nthese feelings can take an emotional\ntoll on you as it's exhausting to feel\nso much so deeply and so frequently if\nyou've been experiencing persistent or\nexcessive heightened emotions or have\neven said done or felt things that you\nwouldn't normally then you may be\nbattling a mental illness\nnumber two engaging in unsafe Behavior\nin 2019 a group of UK researchers found\nthat symptoms of depression can be\naccompanied with additional symptoms\nright like regular symptoms aren't bad\nenough have you been taking less and\nless care of yourself perhaps you've\nbeen neglecting to bathe brush your\nteeth or eat properly you may find\nyourself caring less about your\nappearance and skipping the grooming\nsession mental illness can cause you to\nhave also developed physically unhealthy\nhabits such as eating or sleeping\nsignificantly more or less than usual\nsure eating a large meal or even\nskipping a meal is fine once in a while\nof course sleeping in and having a lazy\nday once in a blue moon is also fine\nbut you may be doing so in a way that\nhas become bad for your nutrition and\noverall health this also May extend to\nengaging in dangerous or risky behaviors\nsuch as substance abuse or self-harm\nthis may not merely be a sign of\nlaziness or being adventurous but\ninstead a sign that you're struggling\nwith your mental health number three\nsocial withdrawal another sign to take\nnote of is withdrawal have you lost\ninterest in activities that you used to\nenjoy have you dropped your school\nextracurricular or work obligations\nperhaps you found that you can't quite\nbring yourself to keep up with them it's\nalso possible that you've withdrawn from\nsocial engagements have you been\ndeclining invites or canceling\narrangements to spend time with friends\nor family\nperhaps you've been acting more closed\noff and spending too much time alone\nthis isn't you being rude or introverted\nif you have significantly withdrawn from\nthese activities and interactions in\nyour life you may be struggling with a\nmental illness number four\nillogical thoughts have you been having\ndifficulties with focusing remembering\nthings or making decisions has it become\nharder to tie your thoughts together and\nexpress them\nmental illness can also affect your\nability to concentrate and use logic to\nthink through things you might notice\nthese changes while you go about your\nday as it's possible for these to affect\nyour performance in school work or even\nsimple household tasks it can be\ndifficult to pinpoint the cause of these\nchanges in thinking or to even notice\nthem at all because mental illness can\nmake the Mind feel foggy and unclear the\nAmerican Psychiatry Association gives us\nexamples of these illogical thoughts\nsuch as having an overwhelming suspicion\nor fear of someone or something when no\nthreat is posed having an illogical or\nexaggerated belief that you have powers\nthat you can influence events or showing\nsigns of magical thinking\nan example of this could be a child who\nbelieves that if he wears purple socks\nhis parents won't fight do any of these\nsigns remind you of anyone you know\nthis could be a sign they're battling\nmental illness and need to seek the\nproper support and number five\nromanticizing negative emotion\nsadness is a part of life and everyone\nfeels it from time to time however\nbattling a deep sadness that feels\nendless and seeps into every crack of\nyour life is a completely different\nstory\nthis is a sadness that you may not even\nknow the exact cause of and can seem\nnearly impossible to escape\nsuch sadness can lead to feeling\nhopeless and can make you feel like\ngiving up\nthis can take the form of numbly letting\nthe days pass by no longer caring for\nyourself and not even doing the most\nbasic of tasks this can also take the\nform of more active thoughts of taking\nyour own life\nif you're experiencing such feelings\nthis is a warning sign that you're\nbattling serious mental health issues\nand you need to seek professional help\nimmediately what you're feeling doesn't\nhave to be permanent according to the\nDSM-5 symptoms of mental illness must\ncause clinically significant distress or\nimpairment in your social life work or\nschool or other important aspects of\nlife these signs can vary in severity\nand frequency depending on the\nindividual to most feeling that\noverwhelming sadness may sound agonizing\nbut believe it or not there are some who\nlove being sad or even find comfort in\nthe sadness based on a 2020 study done\non early signals of mental illness\nparticipants who held a special\nsignificance to words related to sadness\nand perception typically we're diagnosed\nwith some sort of mental illness\nremember one sign or another here and\nthere is normal\nhaving a reasonable level of negative\nemotion in a negative situation is\nnormal when it begins to negatively\naffect life and relationships it becomes\na warning signal just like your stomach\nhurting or these reasons it's important\nto reach out to a professional for a\ncomplete diagnosis if you or anyone you\nknow could be struggling with their\nmental health please don't hesitate to\nreach out to a qualified mental health\ncare provider if you're feeling\ndepressed or contemplating
