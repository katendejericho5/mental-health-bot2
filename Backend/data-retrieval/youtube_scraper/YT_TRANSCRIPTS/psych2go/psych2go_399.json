smart is more than just that\nintelligence is defined by the Oxford\ndictionary as the ability to acquire and\napply Knowledge and Skills being able to\nlearn so many things and use them is\nsomething that can benefit you greatly\nin your daily life we're all constantly\nlooking for new ways to get smarter\nbecause after all most of the time being\nsmart is the key to success improving\nyour intelligence may include\nstrengthening cognitive functions like\nmemory tension and abstract thinking\namong others with that said here are\nfive everyday habits that you can do to\nmake you smarter\nuse the Protege effect\nhave you ever heard of the Protege\neffect\nit's when someone puts in more effort\ntrying to learn something when preparing\nto teach it to someone else as compared\nto when learning it for themselves\naccording to Bridget Granger Ms in order\nto teach something to others you need to\nknow the topic well enough so that you\ncan explain it simply and be able to\nanswer any questions\nwhen being asked questions the teacher\nMay identify gaps in their knowledge\nthat they might have missed and\nsubsequently learn more about the topic\nthemselves so if you want to better\nunderstand things around you such as a\nconcept on an upcoming assessment try\nexplaining or teaching it to someone\nelse you'll teach someone something new\nand at the same time probably be able to\nlearn more about it yourself\nmusic\ndo you play an instrument or have you\nwanted to you definitely should\naccording to a review by Ann staklosa of\nSt John Fisher University\nplaying a musical instrument has been\nshown to increase cognitive ability\nthrough enhanced neuronal communication\nbetween the left and right hemispheres\nof the brain resulting in positive\neffects on learning memory fine motor\nskills and verbal and non-verbal\nreasoning playing a musical instrument\ncan also be rewarding both emotionally\nand physiologically\nmusic can also serve as an outlet for\nemotional expression it's never too late\nto start a new instrument or even pick\nback up on when you used to play if you\nhave any hobbies that you've neglected\nit's not a bad idea to revisit some of\nthem and unlock some of your old skills\nagain\nmake smart friends\nsurrounding yourself with smarter people\ncan actually make you smarter in a study\nfrom the University of Florida\nresearchers examined levels of\nintelligence in adolescence and their\npeers\nthey found a trend people related to\nmore intelligent peers had an IQ that\nwas higher than expected when accounting\nfor intelligence tests taken years ago\nin adolescence especially simply\nbecoming a part of a Social Circle with\nmore intelligent people positively\naffected people's intelligence\npsychologists found that it was because\nthe group of smarter friends motivated\neach other to develop their intellectual\nabilities as much as possible\nsince the study focused mainly on\nadolescence we don't know if adults\nwould be affected in the same way but\nit's still worth a shot having smart\nfriends can often make for an\ninteresting experience\nmeditate\nlet's meditate for a quick moment\ntake a deep breath in\nold\nand breathe out\neyes\nand slow\nrepeat three times\nsimply be conscious that you are\nbreathing\ndo you feel better\nmaybe even more at peace\nmeditation can actually make you smarter\nin a 2014 study Harvard researcher Dr\nTim guard and others found that\nmeditation can reduce decline in some\ntypes of cognition and even brain\nstructure they found a positive\ncorrelation between mindfulness with\nfluid intelligence which is the ability\nto learn assess and navigate new\nsituations meditation has also been\nfound to increase attention span and\nworking memory meditation can take place\nin many different forms try listening to\na guided meditation using an app or even\ndoing it on your own right right right\ndo you ever feel like you can't think\nstraight or that your mind is cloudy\nwell writing can help other Claudia\naltucher says that many successful\npeople write every day for a reason\nwriting things down forces people to\nclarify their thoughts into more\nconcrete representations which takes a\nlot of effort but once you do it\nregularly it becomes easier over time\nand your thoughts will become clearer\nshe also mentions that you'll also have\nfewer doubts about your own thoughts\nincreasing the clarity of your thoughts\ncan make you smarter try making it a\nhabit to write some of your thoughts in\na journal every day you'll be surprised\nabout how deep your mind runs and what\nyou're able to put down on paper being\nsmart is being able to use Quick wits to\napply intelligence there
