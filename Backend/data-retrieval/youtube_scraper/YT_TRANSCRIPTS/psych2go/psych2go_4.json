her sweat\ncry or know she wasn't 100% perfect\naround 14 or so Sabrina was diagnosed\nwith generalized anxiety disorder Gad\ninstead of helping her understand what\nthat meant or how to cope with it\nSabrina's family encouraged her to hide\nit from others and to even omit it from\njob applications for fear of being\npassed over fast forward to Sabrina as\nan adult whenever she was struggling\nmentally or financially or just had a\ngood old rough day she didn't reach out\nto friends or any support system she\nbottled it up and pretended everything\nwas fine this is not the move
