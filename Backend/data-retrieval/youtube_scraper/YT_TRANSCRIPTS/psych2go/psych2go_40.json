    "transcript": "- The axe forgets but the tree remembers.\nThis African proverb beautifully\ndescribes how someone\nwho gets hurt remembers\nthe pain while the person\nwho does the hurting typically forgets.\nThis proverb also comes to mind\nwhen we bring up parenting.\nFrom your early years, parents\nand parent figures shape\nyour behavior, emotions,\nand sometimes even thoughts.\nBut do your parents' actions\naffect you later on in life?\nKeep watching to find out if\nyour family might have shaped\nyou into who you are now.\nThe Anger Tutorial The walls\nof our family home can sometimes trap us.\nHave you experienced your\nfamily yelling on top\nof their lungs, even for\nthe smallest of things?\nMaybe they don't yell.\nMaybe they just speak\nhurtful, abusive words\nthat cut right into your heart.\nMaybe the abuse turned physical\nand made you see comfort\nin the corner of your room.\nIf you, unfortunately,\nwitnessed aggression from an early age,\nhow did it shape you later on?\nIt possible that you solemnly swore\nthat you'd never repeat the\nsame mistakes your parents did.\nIt's also possible\nthat all those things you\nwitnessed snuck into your\nsubconscious and turned\ninto learned aggression.\nIn 1971, Canadian psychologist\nAlbert Bendera came up\nwith a social learning theory.\nThis theory states that\nsocial behavior is learned\nby observing and imitating\nthe behavior of others.\nUnfortunately, this includes all\nof the negative behaviors as well.\nLet's say, as a child,\nyou observe your parents\nparents are screaming\nand aggressively slamming doors\nor throwing objects at each\nother whenever they argue.\nThis may become the learned behavior.\nWhen you grow up and a colleague, friend,\nor partner upsets you,\nyou may react in the same\nway without even thinking.\nYou might get passive-aggressive, yell,\nor even break things out of anger.\nIn some cases, you might catch a glimpse\nof yourself in the mirror and\nrecognize your parents' image.\nOr, it might go completely\nunnoticed. Stone cold.\nWould you describe your\nparents as warm or loving?\nA 2018 research study published\nin Journal Frontiers in\nPsychology defines parental\nwarmth as support praises,\nand displays of affection and tranquility.\nIt's about your mother's\narms being a safe haven\nand your father's voice\nscaring the monsters away.\nAt first glance, this seems logical.\nAren't all parents supposed\nto be kind and caring?\nEven if warmth was a\nbasic parental instinct,\nsome parents would For whatever reason,\nare emotionally unavailable\nand cold-hearted.\nTake, for example, Monica\nGeller from Friends.\nMonica's mother, Judy, was often critical\nand emotionally distant,\nwhich left Monica feeling\nunsupported and unvalued.\nAs a result, Monica\nstruggled with selfesteem\nand turned to food for comfort.\nAnd like Monica, as you grow\nolder, you may begin to search\nfor sun rays elsewhere.\nBut you may still feel the\nconsequences of that cold winter,\nknown as your childhood.\nAs shown in a 2019 study\npublished in Social Science\nand Medicine, the warmth\nthat your parents showed you\nwhen you were young is linked\nto social, psychological,\nand emotional wellbeing in adulthood, even\nas late as midlife.\nYou may have trouble coping with stress,\nfall into depression,\nor look for comfort in drugs or alcohol.\nTaking care of yourself becomes difficult,\nbecause maybe you're not\neven sure what it looks like\nto be taken care of.\nGo away. Dealing with cold,\nunloving parents leads\nto another wound you may\nhave experienced a child.\nRejection. Can you think\nof a time when you felt like you weren't\naccepted by your parents?\nMaybe you excitedly\nshowed them your drawing\nand waited for a good job,\nbut you were instead\ntold not to bother them,\nor to go to your room.\nMaybe you craved a long hug\nafter a lonely day at school,\nbut were told to go annoy your siblings.\nBack into loneliness.\nTo a child, this rejection\ncan mean something too scary\nto even think about.\nIt sends the message\nthat they are similar And not good enough.\nWhen you become an adult,\nthose messages stay deeply\nhidden inside your mind.\na learned behavior.\nLicensed mental health counselor\nStephanie Chan told Psych\nCentral that rejected\nchildren often grow up\nto experience difficult self\nrelationships, including self-\ndoubt, self-neglect,\nself-sabotage, and self-hate.\nIn a way very you learn\nto reject your own self,\nand believe that you are\nnot as worthy as others are.\nThis is not true,of course.\nでも、その思い出を メンタルヘルププロッショナルにつ\n自分自け取ることができる\n何も限界ません もちろん、全ての親はアグレッブ、コールド、\nネグレクトフルです その中でも、そのはとも愛情的で愛さいます\n彼彼抱きし抱しめ、 勇気を与毎日毎日毎、\nでも、良いことがが良いことことが多が多いことが このような親子た、\nある程、 規則や構造が必要としてことを 、\n彼規定めるのは難 彼らは、あの友人になをとも悪く思 だから、\nあを一日レを見ことを あなたの家事につ朝\n食 毎日、甘いスイーツ でもあ、\nこの子長して成功した大人のを?\n例えばウリワンカのチョコレファターリの子供た バルカの父は、\n彼女て役を拒し女を不健康な程度にます マイクは、\nスクリーンの前 アグステスの父親は、彼自分のコントロールを拒 そして、\nヴァオレットは、彼女チュインガムのオブセッション 幼園\nインサイルペィア、\n彼たが成長したき彼女がど\nようにえかすぐ\nに\n完全\n- に\n表現されます 彼女た\n長したに彼女たちがどえたす\n女ち成長したとに、\n彼女たように見のす表現 彼たち成長したときどようにた\nのすぐに 彼ちが長したきに彼女たちどように見の\n彼女成長に、彼女たちがどのように見\nえた、ぐ表現\n彼女たち成長した、彼女ちように現されます\n彼女た長ときようにえたのか 彼女たち成長した、\n彼女た見えたのか 彼女ち成した、\nすぐ表されます\n彼女ち長したき彼女たちどのように\n見えたか、"
