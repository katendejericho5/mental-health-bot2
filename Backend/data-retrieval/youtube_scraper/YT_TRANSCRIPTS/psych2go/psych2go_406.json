let's learn about\nseven signs you're not as happy as you\nthink according to science let's go side\nnote if you're struggling with happiness\nor feeling content with your life this\nis a serious matter please reach out to\na trusted mental health professional to\nhelp navigate those thoughts and\nfeelings number one comparison in 1991\nroot Vin Hoven did a study on happiness\nwhere he proved one of the predictors of\nHappiness can be comparison if you feel\nyour situation is better than someone\nelse's you're probably happier now apply\nit to your life say a cooworker gets a\npromotion that you interviewed for as\nwell you smile congratulate them but\nthey ask you're not upset right let's\npause are you really happy V Hoven\nStates happiness tends to be quite\nstable through time and that happiness\nrelates more strongly to psychological\nvariables than socioeconomic ones if you\nrealize that promotion comes with more\nresponsibility and longer hours that\ntake away from your other priorities you\nmay actually be happy they took the job\non the other hand you might just be\nfaking a smile to not be perceived as a\nsore loser however in both situations\nhappiness is solely based on who has the\nbetter situation if you are curious if\nyou're happy with something in life ask\nyourself do I like this because I think\nit's better than others if the answer is\nno you may not be as happy as you think\nnumber two inner life in the same year\nas his study Vin hovind wrote a book\ncalled questions on happiness classical\ntopics modern answers blind spots in the\nbook Vin Hoven brings up that first\nPoint again that external factors can\naffect happiness but that's only if the\ninner life matches with it even if you\nhave the best job car house partner and\nso on it still won't make you happy if\nyou're not in the right men mental state\nor if you're unhappy with yourself now\nthis also means that it can be hard to\nbe happy if you're not having all of\nyour basic human needs met it all starts\nand ends with you so please be sure to\ntake care of yourselves if you may be\nstruggling with your mental health you\nmay not be as happy as you think number\nthree stress this seems pretty common\nsense but we're sort of obliged to say\nit in 2008 the University of Mary\nWashington conducted a study on the\nrelationship between happiness and\nstress they found the two have an\ninverse relationship this means one is\nhigh the other is low and vice versa so\nif you're stressed about an upcoming\nexam anxious around your boss have a\nfirst date coming up have a few past du\nbills and your parents have been calling\nsince you haven't been home to visit in\nthe last few months you probably aren't\nvery happy even if you think you are\ntake some baby steps to clear out that\nto-do list this can be a big reason why\nyou're not as happy as you think number\nfour social interactions when you take\nwork and your necessary errands and\nchores away from the week what are you\nleft with anything where you're\ninteracting with another person is a\ndrum roll social interaction in a meta\nanalysis of 44 different trials\ninvolving adults over the age of 65 it\nwas found that the participants with the\nmost benefit to their quality of life\nhad recurring social interactions of at\nleast 3 months like an exercise class or\nmeeting up with a book club now everyone\nhas a different level of social\ninteraction they're comfortable with\nwhatever your level is find something\nyou're comfortable with to help break up\nall the work and give your mind a break\nthis can help promote true happiness\nnumber five perception back to our buddy\nVin Hoven in his article happiness he\nstates that we don't calculate happiness\nor unhappiness by our wants versus\nreality this means if we really want\nsomething and don't have it our brain\ndoesn't calculate this as unhappiness\nour brains infer happiness or\nunhappiness from our extreme moods for\nexample if everyone at school is getting\nthe newest iPhone but you're still a few\nversions behind your brain will infer\nhappiness or sad sness based on your\nreaction if you're super pissed and\njealous about not getting the new iPhone\nyour brain will register this extreme\nmood and cause you to be unhappy about\nyour current phone on the other hand if\nyou're a little relieved that you won't\nhave a more expensive phone bill and\nstill content that you have a working\nphone your brain May register the lack\nof extreme emotion is happiness it's all\nabout how you look at things if you tend\nto have a negative outlook on things you\nmay not be as happy as you think number\nsix balance if you're a horror fan I\nknow you've heard this one I'll work and\nno play makes Jack a doll boy come on\nit's spooky season we had to throw in a\nhorror reference in the movie The\nShining Johnny's wife finds this phrase\ntyped out from his typewriter over and\nover and over aside from staying in a\nhaunted hotel he worked himself Crazy by\nnot taking breaks happiness is kind of\nthe same thing it's not about\neliminating every little piece of\nnegativity in your life Jeremy benam one\nof the first people to study happiness\ndefined happiness as the sum of\npleasures and pains then hovind agrees\nand states that happiness is the overall\nappreciation of one's life as a whole\nwe've all had a crappy job or have gone\nthrough some stress here and there\nnothing is perfect understanding this\nand making sure you have balance in your\nlife will greatly improve your level of\nhappiness and number seven gratitude in\na study done in 2017 on the relationship\nbetween gratitude and happiness a higher\nlevel of gratitude is a predictor for a\nhigher level of happiness in the study\nparticipants were divided into two\ngroups one control group and the other\nthat asked the participants to think\nabout a past hope that they now have\nwith gratitude those who thought of that\npast thing with gratitude actually\nshowed a higher level of happiness and\nhope for the future an easy way to show\ngratitude is to say thank you for what\nyou have you can actually say it out\nloud or quietly in your head or write it\ndown but the point is that you express\nit when you sit down to eat wake up in\nthe morning or even when you have a\nlittle extra money to order a new Funko\nPop say that quick little thank you this\ncan help you to be just as happy as you\nbelieve you are now I don't want to\nargue with the meaning of life here\nbecause we all know it's 42 but I think\nall of us are searching for whatever\nmakes us happy life may not be all\nrainbows and butterflies but it's the\nway we make it through the storm
