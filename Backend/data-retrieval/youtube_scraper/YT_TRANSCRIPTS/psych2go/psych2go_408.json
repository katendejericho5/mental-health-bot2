    "transcript": "trusting someone takes a lot of Courage\nyou may have had a parent partner or\nfriend abandon you out of the blue they\nmay have done something behind your back\nyou may have shared something private\nwith them and they betrayed your trust\nby sharing it with others and you're\nleft with this uneasy feeling that leads\nyou to stop trusting people altogether\nthis lack of trust is often a result of\nbetrayal trauma the term betrayal trauma\nwas first coined in 1991 by American\npsychology researcher and the repetition\nJennifer freed according to her betrayal\ntrauma occurs when the people or\ninstitutions on which a person Depends\nfor survival significantly violate that\nperson's trust or well-being you're not\ncrazy too sensitive or overreacting\nbecause symptoms of betrayal trauma are\nemotional responses to a genuine feeling\nof violation you experienced and you\nhave every right to feel wronged or hurt\ntrauma takes many forms in adult life so\nit's important to register potential\ntrauma symptoms\nhere are six signs you may suffer from\nbetrayal trauma anxiety through careful\nresearch Dr Fred has determined that how\npeople respond to betrayal trauma\ndepends on the person and the details of\nthe experience but we do see common\nreactions including anxiety depression\nand dissociation in victims of betrayal\ntrauma according to the adaa individuals\nwho have experienced trauma may\nexperience anxiety in a variety of forms\nfrom an increase in generalized worries\nto panic attacks for example a person\nwho suffers from betrayal trauma may\nexperience severe anxiety when\nconfronted by the person that betrayed\nthem in the first place and feels a\nstrong desire to hide or run away\neven mere reminders of the person can\ncause a victim of betrayal trauma to\nspiral at times integrative trauma\ntherapist and Scholar odelia Gretel\ncrabill agrees that anything that looks\nsounds smells or feels like things\nexperienced at the time of trauma can\ntrigger fear that danger has returned\njust because your life wasn't in danger\ndoes not mean that what you experienced\nwas any less traumatic avoidance\nwhen someone you love hurts you or\nbetrays your trust you may likely want\nto avoid them or discard any memory of\nthem you may become agitated or angry\nwhenever a reminder of them pops up and\ntake your frustrations out on whoever or\nwhatever brought them to mind according\nto license psychology and Trauma\nspecialist Dr Rebecca Craycraft trauma\nsurvivors often feel the pull to avoid\ntheir trauma and just move on it's\nperfectly reasonable to want to move on\nbut when it becomes clear you are simply\nburying your feelings and brushing aside\nthe pain you experienced it becomes a\nproblem\nif every reminder becomes a trigger it's\ntime to seek help and process the drama\nand to process the trauma means you must\nMaster it\nhow Krick off says that gaining Mastery\nover your trauma means not being\ntriggered by things that remind you of\nthe traumatic event anymore\nit sounds easier said than done but if\nthese triggers constantly interfere with\nyour life it's important to address them\ntrust issues\nsomeone you love may have taken\nadvantage of your trust one day so you\nmay have decided to stop trusting people\nyou may meet someone you question their\nmotives instinctively and have been\nconstantly told that you have trust\nissues licensed psychologist and\nrelationship expert Shirley glass\ninsists that immediate relationships are\ncontingent on honesty and openness\nthey're built and maintained through our\nfaith that we can believe what we are\nbeing told from the time we're young\nwe're taught to rely and Trust others\nbut what happens when someone we learn\nto trust betrays us unexpectedly since\nMutual trust is key in any healthy\nrelationship relationships lacking trust\noften fall apart and develop trust\nissues which is normal after a serious\nviolation of your trust\nnegative intrusive thoughts the adaa\nargues that individuals who have\nexperienced drama may also internalize\nthe event and have subsequent negative\nthoughts about themselves or they may\ngeneralize the event and have negative\nthoughts about the world\nthose who have suffered from a personal\nbetrayal will often blame themselves and\nsuffer from recurring intrusive\nself-deprecating thoughts that leave\nthem feeling drained and hopeless\nclinical psychologist Melissa Platt says\nthat victims of betrayal trauma will\noften believe they are bad because they\nfeel bad and because shame is a normal\nsurvival response to experiencing\nbetrayal trauma\nbut they are not usually aware that that\nis the case as Pat said shame is a\nnatural and normal response in this\nsituation someone you loved and trusted\nbetrayed you and you may feel inclined\nto blame yourself or ask yourself what\ndid I do wrong according to Platt\nsurvivors of betrayal trauma need to\nunderstand that these symptoms are signs\nthat their mind was trying to help them\nsurvive rather than signs that there is\nanything wrong with them\ninstead of blaming yourself take the\ntime to acknowledge your feelings\nwithout letting them consume you\nwithdrawal as a result of the Betrayal\nyou may withdraw from your friends and\nfamily and self-isolate to avoid being\nhurt again you may feel like there's no\none left that you can trust and you see\nthe world as a dark place filled with\npeople who want to hurt you\ncraybill describes withdrawal as an\ninstinctive and often helpful reaction\nto threats of almost any kind however\none withdrawal pushes us away from our\nexisting support system it can increase\nthe risk of anxiety and depression\ndeveloping according to crabill as soon\nas a traumatic event passes most\nsurvivors experience a more or less\nirresistible urge to withdraw to a safe\nquiet place to protect themselves from\nfurther harm you may feel like hiding is\nthe best way to stay safe but having\nyour friends family and others you love\nnear you will help you heal better in\nthe long run trauma psychologist Remy\nCoker says that your support system is\nvital for giving you a reality check\nthat what you think is going on really\nis going on and reminding yourself that\nthere are still trustworthy people in\nthe world rumination\ncontrary to an earlier sign not all\nvictims of betrayal trauma want to move\non or practice avoidance clinical\npsychologist and professor at Yeshiva\nUniversity Sabrina Romanov says what\nmakes betrayal trauma so painful is that\nthe person who is betrayed often cannot\nsimply sever their relationship with the\nperpetrator\nfor example the relationship may have\nended but the perpetrator may always be\non your mind you may find yourself\nremembering the good times and wondering\nwhat if I had tried harder or been a\nbetter partner you may hold on to\nmementos like trinkets or photos that\nremind you of the person in question the\nmakeup scenarios where the Betrayal\nnever happened\nthe part of you cannot forget the heart\nyou experienced you may feel convinced\nyou need to know why your partner\nbetrayed you to fix things or find\nclosure but licensed counselor and sex\ntherapist Ellen J Katz and licensed\nmarriage and family therapist Michelle\nsafier insists that those who continue\nto be consumed by seeking information\nare tortured not by the behavior\nbut by their unrelenting quest to\nuncover all of the lies\nunfortunately finding out the truth\ncan't guarantee you peace of mind you\nmay never find all the answers you're\nlooking for\nbut you can be kind to yourself and\nallow yourself to move on with the help\nof friends family and those you love and\nTrust trauma affects us all differently\nso not all people will experience the\nsame symptoms but it is important to\nrecognize when these symptoms affect how\nyou go through life and form new\nrelationships if you feel you may suffer\nfrom betrayal trauma please consult a\nlicensed therapist counselor or\nprofessional talking through your\nfeelings could lead to healthier coping\nmechanisms that improve your life writer\nSherilyn Kenyon once said that everyone\nsuffers at least one bad betrayal in\ntheir lifetime it's what unites us the\ntrick is not to let it destroy
