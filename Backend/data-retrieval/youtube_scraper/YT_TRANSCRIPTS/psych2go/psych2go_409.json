    "transcript": "when you rely too much on others to help\nyou out dependent personality disorder\ndpd is a cluster C personality disorder\nwhich is known as the cluster\ncharacterized by anxious behaviors\npeople with dpd are often incredibly\nfearful and have little confidence in\nthemselves disclaimer it's important to\nnote that dpd has many traits that align\nwith other disorders especially other\npersonality disorders and anxiety\ndisorders in order to be diagnosed you\nmust speak with a qualified mental\nhealth professional who can discern the\ndifferences between this disorder and\nthe similar one to better understand\ndependent personality disorder dpd let's\nlook at some of the most common signs\nnumber one you find it extremely\ndifficult to be alone do you tend to\noverlook your own boundaries in order to\nappease others you rely on perhaps the\nbiggest sign of dpd is an intense fear\nof being alone you may find that you\navoid rejection at all costs to avoid\nbeing left alone you may find yourself\ncompletely lost one alone alone and\ndesperately waiting for the other person\nto come back it's common for people with\ndpd to feel that they have no sense of\nidentity apart from their partner friend\nor relative and will become intensely\nanxious when they're absent this other\nperson fulfills your needs and the\nperson with dpd will feel directionless\nwithout them number two you rely on\nothers to make the decisions in your\nlife is it always a challenge to make\nyour own decisions in anything whether\nit's a big life change or something\nsmall like picking out dinner\nsubmissiveness is another key sign of\ndpd people with dpd will often need to\ngo through someone else to make sure\nthat they're on the right path work may\nbe difficult for a person with dpd as\nthey are unable to complete tasks on\ntheir own even if they are perfectly\nskilled to do so this dependency can be\nextremely taxing on relationships and\nwhere on the people they depend on\nadditionally people with dpd may be\nvulnerable to abuse in relationships\nespecially if they are someone that\ntakes advantage of their disorder and\ntendencies number three you do things to\nwin other people's approval people with\ndpd often have a low self-esteem coupled\nwith a fear of Abandonment or being\nalone one of the ways people with this\ndisorder try to avoid rejection is by\npeople pleasing this can come at the\nexpense of your own well-being in order\nto avoid rejection you may often partake\nin activities that go against what you\nwould normally do this disorder may be\nwhy you disre guard barriers and put\nyourself in uncomfortable positions to\nensure that they'll accept you you may\nfind yourself bending over backwards to\nplease other people no matter the cost\nnumber four you are highly sensitive to\ncriticism is it easy for you to take\ncriticism with a pinch of salt no are\nyou afraid Just A Pinch would be way too\nlittle as someone with dpd you are\ndeeply afraid of rejection so hearing\nsomeone speak out against you can be\nincredibly painful it can give you the\nimpression that the other person is\ngoing to leave therefore dpd can trigger\nsubmissive and approval seeking\nbehaviors as a coping mechanism to try\nto avoid criticism number five you need\na lot of reassurance dpd is common in\npeople with low self-esteem you'll find\nyourself often relying heavily on\nvalidation and\nreassurances you may find yourself\nunable to make any kind of decision\nwithout going through another person and\nhaving them give input on what you do\nthis dependency can be so difficult for\npeople with dpd and and the Romantic\npartners that it can take its toll on\nrelationships the person with dpd will\noften get into another relationship\nquickly to avoid the overarching fear of\nbeing alone and number six you find it\ndifficult to start things on your own an\ninability to take initiative is another\nbig sign of dpd you may find that you\ncannot start projects on your own as you\nneed to go through another person first\nif you're left by yourself you may\nnotice that you are overwhelmed and\nstruggle to find where to start people\nclose to those with dpd will often need\nto be present at all times to help with\nthese decisions putting a strain on\ntheir relationships the dependency is a\nnecessity and people struggling with the\ndisorder find themselves unable to\noperate on their own\nterms everyone depends on another for\nsurvival but there comes a point when\nthis need is too much dpd is difficult\nto live with and can greatly reduce your\nquality of life however it's important\nto know that it is possible possible to\nget help dpd is highly treatable so\ngetting in
