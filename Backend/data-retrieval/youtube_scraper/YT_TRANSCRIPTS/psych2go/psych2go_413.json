    "transcript": "have you ever wondered how to get\nsomeone to like you they may think\nyou're pretty all right whether this is\na crush friend or acquaintance but you\nwant them to jump for joy at the mere\nsight of you well that may not be so\neasy to happen the literal jumping but\nthere are a few things that people find\nlikable do you do these things possess\nthese traits people are more likely to\nlike you if you do these five things\nnumber one you're holding a warm\nbeverage do you like your coffee hot or\nice\nif you prefer your beverages cold then\nyou may need to switch over to the hot\nside you may just come across as hotter\nthis study does suggest you may come\nacross as warmer a 2008 study published\nin the academic Journal science found\nthat if you're holding a warm beverage\npeople may perceive you as more\npersonable the researchers conducted two\nstudies with interesting results the\nstudy States in study one participants\nwho briefly held a cup of hot versus\niced coffee judged a Target person as\nhaving a warmer personal it generous\ncaring in study 2 participants holding a\nhot versus cold therapeutic pad were\nmore likely to choose a gift for a\nfriend instead of for themselves how\nsweet are them see you may not only be\nperceived as sweet as the hot cocoa\nyou're holding on your date but\nhopefully as hot as it is too we can\nonly dream right number two they see you\nin a group first do you hang out with\nyour friends often in large groups no\nwell you might as well say yes to that\nnext group outing because it may make\nothers see you as more attractive and\neven like you more research shows that\npeople tend to find others more\nattractive when they are in groups than\non their own this idea is called the\ncheerleader effect and has been proven\nthrough tests by psychologists to be\nconsistent researchers Edward VA and\nDrew Walker of the University of\nCalifornia San Diego conducted five\nexperiments where subjects would rate\npeople based on photographs of them they\nfound that subjects rided people more\nattractive when they were pictured in a\ngroup of the same gender compared to an\nindividual photograph of someone\npictured alone as the study suggests\nindividual faces will seem more\nattractive when presented in a group\nbecause they will appear more similar to\nthe average group face which is more\nattractive than group members individual\nfaces number three you make small\nmistakes sometimes do you often make\nmistakes it's time to Rejoice your time\nhas arrived to be appreciated well kind\nof while it's best to be our best selves\nsmall mistakes and blunders are bound to\nhappen from time to time while you may\nthink of this as an embarrassing or\nunattractive thing sometimes people\nperceive it as the opposite a study\npublished in the journal psychonomic\nscience found that if you make some\nsmall mistakes but still show that you\nare capable and intelligent you may be\nseen as more attractive in the study\nresearcher Elliot arenson had people\nrate fake test takers based on their\nattractiveness test takers would either\ndo great on a test mediocre or poor the\nimperfection some test takers would act\nclumsy and spill coffee at the end of\nthe interview after their scores were\nrevealed people rated the test takers\nwho spilled coffee at the end of their\ninterview the highest on the attractive\nscale meaning people want to see you are\nintelligent and capable but that you\naren't perfect as the research paper\nStates a superior person may be viewed\nas superhuman and therefore distant a\nblunder tends to humanize them and\nconsequently increases their\nattractiveness poor test takers mediocre\ntest takers and even great test takers\nare still rated lower than the superior\ntest taker who scored great and spilled\ncoffee at the end others may be\nintimidated if you come across as\nperfect and make no mistakes they want\nto see your human side but when you show\nyou're capable and yet still relatable\nas a human being who makes mistakes\npeople tend to like you more number four\nyou give people compliments do you enjoy\nreceiving Compliments are you pretty\ngood at telling when they're genuine\npeople are pretty good at spotting when\na compliment is genuine versus is just\nbeing polite so when you genuinely\nappreciate something about someone let\nthem know wouldn't you want to know if\nsomeone was thinking highly of you when\nwe speak of others in a positive light\npeople will associate the traits we use\nto describe that person with ourselves\nthis happens when we talk about someone\nto someone else this is called\nspontaneous trait transference and it\noccurs when communicators are perceived\nas possessing the very traits they\ndescribe in others according to several\nstudies published in the Journal of\nPersonality and Social Psychology\nresearchers found that when we describe\nsomeone with a certain trait to another\nperson that person will associate us\nwith the trait described H so who will\nyou compliment next and number five\nyou're a great listener and allow others\nto talk about themselves too who doesn't\nlove having a caring friend who is a\ngreat listener it's great to allow both\nparties to talk a bit about themselves\nwhen having a conversation and if you\nreally want someone to like you the key\nmay just be to Simply listen to them let\nthem talk about themselves for a while\ntoo Harvard researchers discovered that\ntaking the time to talk about yourself\ncan have its rewards in one of the five\nstudies subjects sat in an fmri machine\nand had to respond to questions about\neither their own opinions on a subject\nor anothers regions of the brain\nassociated with reward and motivation\nwere most active when talking about\ntheir own thoughts on a subject as\nopposed to others in fact the need to\ntalk about ourselves is so strong that\nin another study conducted by Harvard\nresearchers some subjects even declined\nmoney to talk about themselves more as\nthe research article States\nself-disclosure was strongly associated\nwith increased activation in brain\nregions that formed the meso limic\ndopamine System including the nucleus\naccumbent and ventral tangental area\nmoreover individuals were willing to\nforgo money to disclose about the self\ndon't be afraid to share your opinions\nand thoughts but also remember to listen\nto theirs as well they may just like you\nfor it and you may just hear something\nabout them that you like so do you do\nany of these things will you work on\nyour listening skills be less\nembarrassed when you make a small\nblender feel free to share with us your\nthoughts in the comments down below if\nyou
