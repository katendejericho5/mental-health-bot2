    "transcript": "foreign\nlet's talk about the satisfaction with\nlife scale\ns-w-l-s it measures as the title says\nsatisfaction with life it won't tell you\nif you're happy or not but it will help\nyou to categorize which things you're\nmost satisfied with but what sucks that\nsatisfaction away in the first place\nwhat is making you unhappy with your\nlife every day you wake up well stay\ntuned we'll teach you what drops that\npip in your step so sit back relax and\nlet's take a look at how to be miserable\nfor the rest of your life side note this\narticle is meant to be sarcastic and\nsatirical so please don't take it too\nseriously if you feel you need to\ndiscuss your level of satisfaction with\nlife please reach out to a mental health\nprofessional number one don't ever stick\nto a sleep schedule they say that sleep\nhelps regulate mood brain function and\ndual overall health but every night you\nwant to stay up to watch another season\nof that show you're binging also you\ngonna have a night out in the town\nbefore you have to go to work at 7am you\ncan certainly make that work all you\nneed is like three to four hours tops\nyep you can always take power naps all\nday every day right who needs that\nhealthy sleep schedule that can increase\nyour productivity anyway oh and that\nbrain fog that you get after your power\nnaps all day long yeah don't worry about\nthat it's okay you'll just be miserable\nfor life and if you don't want that it\nis always a good idea to stick to a\nhealthily regulated sleep schedule\nnumber two take everything for granted\nalrighty do you have a wonderful support\nsystem and people you care about but do\nyou care nope to be miserable you\nabsolutely cannot show gratitude for\nthese things gratitude can increase\nhappiness and even your hopefulness\nabout life but who wants to get their\nhopes up so the next time someone does\nyou a favor or gives you a gift don't\nrepay them or thank them they should do\nthat stuff just because number three\navoid anything negative at all costs\nhave you heard about people growing from\ntheir mistakes scratch that hear this\nout mistakes are bad when you make a\nmistake people tell you so which makes\nyou feel even more bad so if you avoid\nyour mistakes you won't feel bad Bingo\nend of bad feelings just come up do\nwhatever you can to push them away cause\nwhy not surround yourself constantly\nwith distractions so you can't process\nyour emotions ignore your negative\nemotions and put that teeny Band-Aid\nover that huge crack in the wall it's\nfine this is fine number four keep your\nphone at the ready at all times don't\nlook away are you one of those people\nwho actually like\nsocializing you know that talking thing\nlike in person oh no doing things IRL is\nso lame it's all about social media now\nokay and of course you have to keep your\nphone on you at all times make sure you\ndon't miss a thing oh wait uh be right\nback\nokay done refresh my feed for the\nupteenth time again in as many seconds\nyou should never miss a Beat\nwhether you're alone or out with friends\njust keep scrolling it's not like it\nmakes you seem withdrawn or rude when\nwith others or anything no number five\nself-care more like who cares okay we\nall know this whole self-care thing is\njust to help sell candles and essential\noils right it's not like self-care\nreduces anxiety or helps you connect\nwith your mind body and emotions not\neven close right it's not like it is\nfunctional or relaxing I mean who's ever\nheard of a self-care boss am I right if\nyou want to be miserable ditch the\nself-care and just keep plugging on\nnumber six don't exercise or be active\nin any way so many campaigns everywhere\nabout getting up and moving but why take\nthe time and the effort to do so don't\nfeel motivated by all these people\nposting selfies at the gym smiling just\nignore it as hype they say exercise\nreleases endorphins helps Elevate mood\nand increases appetite and boosts\noverall health instead just refuse to\nbelieve that something that can be so\npainful and tiring can be so rewarding\nor help in your happiness nope staying\non the couch all cozy and miserable is\nthe way to go thank you number seven\ndon't celebrate small victories It's All\nor Nothing alright there's a\npsychologist who gave a TED Talk and\nwrote a book about happiness they say\nthat little celebrations help keep you\nhappy and motivated and that happiness\nand motivation leads to a higher level\nof productivity for example your\nlong-term goal is to open a bakery but\nyou just sold your first ever dessert\nbaked out of your home sure that Rush of\nyour first sale could drive you for it\nbut why not just save all that\ncelebration to the end you're not even\nclose jeez number eight all work and no\nplay is the way to go all you here about\nnowadays is this work life balance thing\nwho is this if you just bury your head\nand continue working you can work more\nhours and get ahead sure it can burn you\nout quickly to always be pouring out of\nyour cup and never refilling it but\nisn't it just a waste of time to do\nsomething that's not productive like\nrest oh no no no no no just keep working\nand you'll be sure to be miserable for\nthe rest of your days okay this was\nbeing a little sassy so it's time to\ncome clean this was meant to shed some\nlight on things that could be taken away\nfrom your happiness in a satirical\nfashion do you do any of these things\nand notice you're not totally happy need\nsome ideas for what to do to help\nincrease that satisfaction just do the\nopposite of what these points say do you\nknow of anything that can take
