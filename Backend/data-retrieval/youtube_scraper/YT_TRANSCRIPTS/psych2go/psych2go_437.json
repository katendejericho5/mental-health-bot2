    "transcript": "[Music]\nhey psych2goers and welcome back to our\nchannel it's only with your support that\nwe can make psychology and mental health\nmore accessible to everyone so thank you\nfor all the love that you've given us\nnow let's continue\nhave you ever been told that you seem\nintimidating\ndid it bother you or possibly confuse\nyou about why they said that you might\nbe subconsciously doing certain things\nthat make your personality come across\nas more intimidating than you want it to\nbe please remember that many of these\nsigns and behaviors aren't negative and\nthough they might make you seem\nintimidating it doesn't necessarily mean\nyou should change anything about\nyourself or who you are wondering if\nthis applies to you here are eight signs\nthat your personality might be\nintimidating to others\nnumber one your Snappy or reactive\ndo snap at people easily when you hear\nabout something you don't like do you\nreact hastily being Snappy can come\nacross as intimidating because people\nmay feel like you're unapproachable or\ndifficult to talk to even when you don't\nmean to be having strong opinions and\nsnapping at others when things don't go\nyour way might make you seem\nintimidating\nnext time you find yourself about to\nsnap take a step back and take a deep\nbreath before reacting you'd be\nsurprised at how quickly you relax and\nhow much more approachable it'll make\nyou seem\nnumber two you think with your head\nare you extremely practical\ndo you base most of your decisions on\npure logic if so you might be more prone\nto thinking with your head though this\nquality in itself doesn't necessarily\nmake you intimidating thinking less with\nyour heart may make you less emotionally\naware in certain situations and as a\nresult you may come off as having an\nintimidating personality\nnumber three you're persistent do you\nset high goals for yourself do you work\nextremely hard to achieve those goals if\nyou do you're likely a very persistent\nperson which can be seen as intimidating\npersistence and perseverance aren't bad\ntraits when you persist it shows that\nyou have great confidence in your\nabilities and it might be intimidating\nfor others to see that side of you but\nyou just have big goals and won't let\nanything or anyone stand in your way\nnumber four people seem to tiptoe around\nyou\nhave you noticed that people tend to\nclam up around you and seem possibly\nafraid to speak their minds they might\nbe tiptoeing around you and are being\ncautious and careful about what they say\nwhile in your presence if you notice\nthis happening to you it may seem like\npeople go quiet agree with everything\nyou say and even apologize to you more\nfrequently\nnumber five you tend to dominate\nconversations\nwhen you talk with your friends do you\ntalk the most or the loudest\nthis could be a sign that your\npersonality seems intimidating\ndominating conversations can look like\ntalking excessively or more loudly than\neveryone else and cutting people off\nmid-conversation when you dominate a\nconversation it can make it harder for\nothers to express themselves around you\nthis is a tendency that can happen\nsubconsciously and it could even be a\nsign of anxiety so if you relate to this\ndon't feel bad or like it's your fault\ninstead try and practice active\nlistening in your conversations so\nyou'll be more attentive and present\nthan how you're acting before\nnumber six you speak in an aggressive\ntone\nwhen you talk with others how do you\nnormally come across are you aggressive\nand direct or are you more light and\ngentle\nno matter what you say your tone of\nvoice can make a huge difference in how\nyou're received when you speak with an\nassertive aggressive or direct tone this\ncan come across as intimidating this\ncould take a toll on the way people\nperceive your ideas and opinions do you\nfind yourself speaking with a tone\nthat's more aggressive than you'd like\nif so how do you plan to become more\nmindful of how things may be received\nbefore you say them it might take time\nbut gradually you'll come across as more\napproachable with a more gentle tone\nnumber seven you're critical of others\nwhen interacting with others do you tend\nto judge dissect or criticize what they\nsay\nwhile you may come across as intelligent\nyou'll likely also come across as\nintimidating to be around according to\npsychiatrist Grant Hillary Brenner\ninsulting others during a conversation\neven in a joking manner can make you\ncome across as judgmental and\ncompetitive competitiveness can be\noff-putting so if people feel that way\nin conversations with you they may be\nless likely to view you as approachable\nand number eight you are straightforward\nare you unafraid to speak your mind\nspeaking your mind outright and avoiding\ndancing around the truth is not a bad\nthing in fact it can improve\ncommunication in your day-to-day life\nspeaking your mind is a good trait to\nhave as long as you make sure what you\nsay is tactful and constructive\ndid you relate to any of the points in\nthis video or do any of
