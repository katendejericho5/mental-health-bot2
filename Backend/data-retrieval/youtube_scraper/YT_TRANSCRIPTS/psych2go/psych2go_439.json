    "transcript": "have you ever lost a loved one due to a\nterminal illness\na grandparent a friend\nif you have it must have been very\ndifficult and very painful they're gone\nand there's nothing you can do to bring\nthem back and it makes you wonder\nis this it\nwhere do their souls go will you ever\nsee them again in the afterlife\nseeing a glimmer of hope would be worth\nit wouldn't it is there a glimmer of\nhope that maybe this isn't the end of\nthe story that there is something out\nthere that science has not been able to\ndetect\nmatter of fact there have been various\nreports and testimonials throughout\nmedical history that this has happened\nbefore the phenomenon has even been\ngiven a name terminal Lucidity many\npeople see it as an event of Peace\ntransition and even Comfort despite the\nfact that the official title sounds like\nit describes a final destination like\nnightmare to Simply describe it's that\nshort amount of time a terminally ill\npreviously suffering individual is\nsuddenly Lively and healthy as if\nthey're cured only for them to pass on\nshortly thereafter with shortly meaning\nminutes to hours it's as if the person\nfound a time machine to go back well\nbefore their illness and reloaded from a\nsave point like a video game character\nthe patient's reactions in the reported\ncases were not recognized by fear but\nrather by acceptance and warmth\nit has also been noted by surviving\nfamily members that this period of\nnormality has helped them deal with the\ninevitable loss but before we take this\nfinal bonus for granted let us ask\nourselves\nwhy is it that this takes place\nthere have been too many documented and\nobjectively reported cases of terminal\nLucidity to ignore as a one-off or\nmomentary delusion given that it appears\nin entries even as far back as the 1400s\nit's clear that this wasn't just a\npassing craze or a short-lived epidemic\nthe answer for now is we don't know one\nthing we do know about this phenomenon\nis that it most commonly occurs in\npeople with neurological or psychiatric\ndisorders like schizophrenia or\nAlzheimer's disease and the period of\nsudden Health can appear to be a miracle\nthis is manifested itself in a variety\nof ways from a previously unresponsive\nmemory blank mother suddenly having\ncognizant coherent conversations with\nher daughter to a nearly non-verbal\nnon-self-sufficient mentally disabled\nboy singing and reciting scripture one\nday\nin both cases the patient died after a\nfew minutes regardless of their level of\nLucidity The Physician Hippocrates yes\nthe one who coined the Hippocratic Oath\nwrote about this phenomenon of mental\nillness symptoms waning as death\napproached in ancient Greece in the past\nit was thought that the human soul was\nable to break free of the body's\nillnesses resulting in a sudden\nResurgence of Health some scientific\ntheories such as that the nervous system\nis stimulated by pain or that a massive\namount of neurotransmitters are released\nas a last-ditch effort before death have\nbeen suggested to explain this\nphenomenon in the absence of concrete\nevidence these are merely educated\nguesses the Mysteries surrounding the\ncause of this last gasp of Life\ncontinues to Fascinate fueled by the\nfact that there is currently no concrete\nanswer some interpret it as a final\nattempt by the ill person's soul to\ncommunicate with loved ones and bid them\nfarewell which assumes the existence of\na real indefinite human soul one could\nargue that this serves as irrefutable\nevidence\nthat we are loved and that the end isn't\nreally the end\nwhat are your thoughts about terminal\nLucidity and does life really exist\nafter death comment below and don't\nforget to like share and subscribe to\nwatch more videos like this take care\nand see you soon"
