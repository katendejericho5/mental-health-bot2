    "transcript": "[Music]\nlet's get it out\nsome people find it difficult to get\nthings going and it doesn't have\nanything to do with the person they're\nwith sometimes it's just a dysfunction\nsexual dysfunction is a condition\ncharacterized by problems in one or more\nphases of the sexual response cycle the\nsexual response cycle refers to the four\nstages arousal excitement Plateau\norgasmic and resolution\nall these phases are necessary for\nsexual functioning and a sexual\nexperience sexual dysfunctions usually\nfall under four major categories\ndisorders of sexual desire interest\narousal orgasm and sexual pain however\nthe most common ones deal with sexual\ndesire and arousal examples of common\ndisorders include orgasmic dysfunction\ndysperunia and premature ejaculation\nhowever today we'll be focusing on two\nhyperactive and diversion both\nconditions lie on the opposite ends of\nthe sexual attraction Spectrum the first\nsexual disorder is sexual hyperactivity\nthis means that individuals have an\nunusually high sex drive like higher\nthan your average you might wonder how\nis that possible but it's true\nunfortunately sexual hyperactivity can\nlead people to have multiple sexual\npartners or engage in problematic\npornography use as defined by the\nAmerican Psychological Association\nsexual hyperactivity is Extreme\nfrequency of sexual activity or an\ninordinate desire for sexual activity\nthis means that a person can experience\nexcessive worries or thoughts around sex\nwhich includes sexual thoughts fantasies\nor behaviors sexual hyperactivity takes\ndesire to a whole other level it\nproduces feelings of euphoria or an\noverwhelming excitement for sexual\nactivity or anything related to sex it's\nlike a revved up engine or a wildfire\nthat can't be stopped these euphoric\nfeelings can cause compulsive or\nimpulsive behaviors which can lead to\nrisky sexual activity these risky\nactivities push the boundaries of safety\nand often put the individual in\ndangerous situations\nthese behaviors can be disruptive or\ndistressing if the individual is in a\nrelationship although it is not part of\nthe criteria this disorder has been\nlinked to people with ADHD however more\nstudy and research is necessary to\nexplain the link between both conditions\nthe association between ADHD and\nhyperactive sexual disorder is\nendorphins post-orgasmic and during the\nresolution phase of sex endorphins flood\nthe body providing a feel-good calm this\ncalmness helps control the restlessness\nmany people with ADHD deal with but this\ndoesn't mean that hyperactivity and ADHD\nare mutually exclusive there are other\nfactors that cause hyperactive sexual\ndisorder hyperactive sexual disorder is\nalso linked to other psychological\nconditions for example addiction or\nimpulse control disorders that may have\nunderlying medical conditions\nat the opposite end of the spectrum of\nsexual dysfunction relating to arousal\nis sexual aversion sexual aversion\nsometimes called hypoactivity refers to\nan unusually low sex drive where a\nperson can lose all interest in sexual\nactivity\nif we take the revved up engine analogy\nsexual aversion is like an engine that\nrefuses to turn on\ninterest in all sexual activity vanishes\npeople can experience low libido due to\nmedication but sexual aversion is\nsomething entirely different the\nAmerican Psychological Association\ndefines it as a negative emotional\nreaction to sexual activity causing an\nactive avoidance of it sexual aversion\ncan cause distress in the individual or\ntheir Partners since an individual can\nexperience intense feelings of disgust\nor anxiety when it comes to sex\nwhile it usually applies to all sexual\nactivity it can also be specific to some\nactivities or some Partners although\nsexual aversion disorder was listed in\nthe DSM-5 it is no longer listed in the\nDSM-5 since there is not much research\nsupporting it\nhealings that characterize this\ncondition are negative emotions such as\nanxiety distress and even revulsion\nsurrounding or relating to sexual\nactivity these feelings can impede or\nhinder the engagement of sexual intimacy\nin a relationship\nthere are various factors that can lead\nsomeone to develop sexual aversion for\nexample traumatic experiences cultural\nor religious beliefs and even\npsychological issues this condition is\noften seen in people with depression but\ncan sometimes arise as a side effect of\nmedications\nantidepressants and heart medication\nusually reduce sex drive\nbut this condition was also prevalent\namong people with ADHD although\nincidences of sexual hyperactivity\ndisorder were much greater studies did\nalso find that individuals with ADHD\nexperienced sexual aversion or\nhypoactivity\nsexual disorders vary according to the\nsituation partner and what you're\ncurrently dealing with there will be\ntimes when your overall
