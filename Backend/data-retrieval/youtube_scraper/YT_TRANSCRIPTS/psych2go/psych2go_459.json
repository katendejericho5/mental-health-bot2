done\nand challenge yourself to become a\nbetter person\nit's also a big leap forward to have the\nmindset to want to improve yourself a\ntrait that not everyone possesses so if\nyou're interested in making a positive\nchange in your life here are six tips on\nhow to not be a toxic person number one\ncheck your ego the first step to not\nbeing toxic is acknowledging that you\nhave certain traits that may be toxic\nthey don't necessarily Define you but\nthese behaviors have come up more than\nonce in your past interactions if you're\nthe type of person who always has to be\nright who can't stand to be challenged\nor who gets defensive at the drop of a\nhat it may be time to check your ego\narrogance and lack of humility are big\nsigns that you're a toxic person they\nshow that you lack the mental\nflexibility to see things from another\nperson's perspective\nit's not easy to let go of your ego but\nyou need to be open to the idea that you\nmight not always be right try seeing\nthings from other people's points of\nview and be willing to change your\nopinion being able to admit when you're\nwrong is a key trait of successful and\nwell-liked people\nnumber two don't test others\ndo you often find yourself challenging\nothers to test their loyalty\nif you do it's time to reassess your\nmethods testing others is a toxic way to\ntry to control the situation and those\naround you whether it's by making final\nultimatums asking trick questions or by\nmaking false Temptations for your\npartner testing others may seem\nreassuring to you at first but it can be\nutterly draining for those around you it\nshows insincerity insecurity and a lack\nof trust\nif you want to build healthy and lasting\nrelationships it's important to be\ngenuine with your intentions try\nbuilding trust and openly communicating\nwith others show others that you trust\nthem by being vulnerable yourself this\nway you won't have a big expectation for\nthem to live up to but instead Foster a\nmore healthy relationship that creates\ntrust from both sides number three\ndon't gossip do you find yourself\nregularly engaged in Gossip gossiping\nmay seem fun and engaging but it's not\nthe best way to build rapport when you\ngossip you're tearing someone else down\nin order to feel better about yourself\nit certainly won't do your image any\nfavors either no one wants to be branded\nas a gossip and not only is gossiping\nhurtful to the person you're gossiping\nabout but it also shows a lack of\nmaturity on your part\nimportant to be able to have mature\nconversations about things that don't\ninvolve putting others down\nnumber four don't be a doormat there's a\nbig difference between being respectful\nand being a doormat when you're a\ndoormat you don't stand up for yourself\nand you don't voice your opinion this\nnot only shows a lack of self-respect\nbut it also sets you up to be taken\nadvantage of by others and allows others\nto walk all over you on the other hand\nbeing respectful doesn't mean you have\nto agree with everything someone else\nsays it's okay to voice your opinions\nand stand up for yourself but when\nmoments of disagreement do happen try to\ncalmly express yourself without putting\nthe other person down number five\ndon't control people's mindsets\ndo you often tell others to calm down\nrelax or don't take things so seriously\nwhile it may sound rational to tell\nothers not to let their emotions get a\nhold of them trying to control other\npeople's emotional reactions can be a\nvery toxic Behavior\nbecause it's an attempt to invalidate\nsomeone else's emotions under the guise\nof sounding rational these phrases can\nstifle an emotional conversation and\nfurther alienate the person you're\ntalking to\ninstead of trying to control how someone\nelse is feeling validate their emotions\nand provide comfort and emotional\nsupport this can go a long way in\nstrengthening the bond between you and\nnumber six don't avoid or delay\ndifficult conversations\nthink about it is there something you've\nbeen wanting to talk to your friend or\npartner about but you keep putting it\noff because you're not ready or it's not\nthe right time there's no question about\nit conflict can be uncomfortable because\nnavigating difficult situations is never\neasy but if you want to have a healthy\nand successful relationship it's\nimportant that you're able to openly\ncommunicate with each other and that\nincludes having tough conversations\navoiding difficult conversations will\nonly create more tension and resentment\nin the long run leaving these negative\nfeelings unresolved won't lead to\nanything good so it's important to\naddress them as soon as they arise\nit can be difficult to change your\nbehavior especially if you've been\nengaging in these behaviors for a long\ntime but it's important to remember that\nchange is always possible you'll\nexperience new things build more\nmemories and establish more\nrelationships As you move through life\nwhy let your less than Stellar habits\nDefine you\ncan you relate to any of these points\nI'll admit I can let
