    "transcript": "I can't remember a time when I didn't\nhate myself\nit's a truth that haunts me every day a\nghost that pokes at my heart my mind\nsee here's the thing with depression it\nit creeps up on you\nit might be slow at first but when it\nhits you it chokes you until you cannot\nbreathe\nstrangely\nhow it felt like just months ago I was\nfine\nand now I feel like I'm drowning\nbut depression doesn't always come slow\nno they can crash upon you like a wave\nwhen you are least expecting it\nit started with the Small Things\nsleeping in a little later eating a\nlittle less\nfeeling drowsy tired\n[Music]\nfeeling different emotions for no reason\nat all\nthings I brushed off like nothing\nnow it stays in bed now it's entire meal\nskipped now it's a messy house now it's\nnumbness\nmy phone rings it's 1pm and I'm borrowed\nbeneath a pile of blankets I really\ndon't want to pick up that call I just\nwant to go and close my eyes and shut\noff the buzz of the world\nI give myself a quick peek at my phone\nand my gut twists when I see it reads\nmom\nI still hesitate I just want to go back\nto bed why are all these people\nbothering me I feel guilty though my\nmother is probably worried and I haven't\neven looked at my phone in three days as\nI reluctantly rise I numbly gather that\nI am sitting in a room that reeks of\nrotten food\nwith piles of laundry Rising like towers\naround me and somehow I do not care\nI don't remember when there was a time\nthat I did hi Mom I say weekly my voice\ncracks with days of unuse\nher soft troubled voice makes me wince\nshe asks if I'm okay she asks if I've\neaten she asks if the house is cleaned\nI answer shortly to everything one word\nresponses and I think that troubles her\neven more though I can't know for sure\nI'm not quite sure of anything these\ndays\nI expect her to ask me these questions\nto be concerned for me\nit surprises me a little though when her\nvoice turns hard and she says you used\nto be so much more now\nit's like you are nothing hurt comes in\na wave that shocks me\nfor it is one of the starkest feelings I\nhave felt in a very very long time\nit hurts me because\nshe is right because it is a truth so\nharsh that strips and reveals me\ntwo months ago I was on the verge of\npromotion in my career in a healthy\nrelationship and surrounded by\nsupportive friends\nnow\nI grieve for the life I had\nI haven't talked to my partner or\nfriends in days\nwork emails flood my inbox and I surely\nlost that promotion that I worked so\nhard to get it surprises me that this\nall makes me mourn the life I had\nI expect to bury myself back under the\nsheets of my bed and live the rest of my\nday away from the world\ninstead though I find myself peeling\nback the covers my feet touching the\nfloor\nthen walking to the kitchen\nI take one look at the kitchen dishes\npiled up high food scattered all over\nthe counter and for the first time in\nweeks\nI feel something like a spark festering\nin my mind telling me to clean that dish\nwipe down the counters so I spend the\nnext hour cleaning my kitchen\nmy mind is still a little numb but it\ngives me hope when slowly some of the\nwheels start turning in my head once\nagain\nwhen the kitchen is spotless gleaming in\na way it hasn't before I feel so very\nproud of myself\nmy eyes shift next to the messy living\nroom but suddenly the thought of\ncleaning it overwhelms me so I think\nbaby steps and then the day with a small\nsmile on my face\nhope at last\ntakes root in my heart\nI say to myself thank you for cleaning\nup thank you for knowing your limits\nthank you for trying\nthe next morning I convinced myself that\nstaying in bed would just be easier I\ncan feel the momentary high from\naccomplishing something yesterday\nwearing off\nthat numbness is in my mind again\nI just feel so tired\nI have no motivation to get up\nand I hate myself a little as I give\ninto my wants and go back to bed I feel\nguilty and like a failure when I spend\nthe day again borrowed beneath my sheets\navoiding the world\nI feel Frozen\nI feel distant\nso much self-hatred Burns through me but\nI don't have the energy to do anything\nabout it\nI feel so many things but I just can't\nget up\nthe next day I decide it's a new morning\nwith new possibilities\nguilt and remorse still turn in me for\nwasting a day but I know I can atone for\nit by making the most of this one I make\nmy bed I even get ready to go for a walk\nwhich I haven't done in months just as\nI'm about to leave I noticed a slip of\npaper on the counter and recognize it as\nmy therapist phone number the thought of\ncalling her scares me but I don't even\nthink of it as I slip it into my pocket\nthe sky is blue\nthe breeze gentle it washes out my mind\nclears it out and suddenly I feel sharp\nin a way I haven't been in a long long\ntime\nfor a while I just walk\njust me and the Open Sky\nand I cannot remember the last time I\nfelt so focused\nso sure\nsoon I let my hand reach for the paper\nwith the faded phone number\nI stop and stare at it and for a moment\nfear and logic war in my mind\nspeaking my feelings and being so\nvulnerable has always scared me though I\nknow it is an essential step if I want\nto have my life back so I stop as I dial\nthe number\nher voice\ncalm in its way floods my ears and\nrelaxes me\nshe has her way of doing that her voice\nalone able to take a weight off my\nshoulders so right then and there under\nthe shade of a tree I pour my heart out\nto this person who listens and\nunderstands I always feel guilty for\nburdening others with my issues but\nit feels good to at least feel like I'm\nnot so alone\nit's hard to come to terms with the fact\nthat some will support your recovery and\nsome will not some people don't\nunderstand how long it really is that it\ncontains ups and downs\nwhen I go to speak with my mom she does\nnot understand she looks frustrated and\nsays but you used to be so happy just be\nhappy again\nit's it's so hard to tell her that it\ndoesn't work like that because she just\ndoesn't understand mental health very\nwell\nit's hard to fight those tears and I\nknow I shouldn't let my anger get the\nbest of me but I do I yell at her why\ncan't you just understand you make\neverything worse\nand I storm away my mind a flurry of\nemotions\ndoesn't she know I'm trying my best\nthat night I crawl into bed and my mind\nreplays every word I said to my mother\nI feel so many things\nanger regret\nrepulsion it's too much my breathing\nquickens I feel light-headed and my\nPalms become sweaty I feel like\neverything is about to come crashing\ndown and for a moment I think I should\nwelcome it it's difficult to feel like a\nburden\nmost of my days I contemplate what a\nterrible daughter I am and what a\nterrible friend I am\nespecially after my fight with my mom\nI feel useless\nI must be such a hard person to be\naround I just can't stop feeling guilty\nbecause I make everyone's lives so\ncomplicated\nI often feel like a boulder and my peers\nare forced to drag this weight around\nI'm so sick of feeling that way like\nsomeone they have to be careful around\nthrough my struggles I try to remember\neverything my therapist said that every\nday is a new chance a new day I\nshouldn't waste it over one moment\nnope I start doing the things I love\nagain\npainting reading gardening\nthey calm my mind and above all\nmake me so happy\nthey rekindle a passion that I knew was\nalways there but just tucked away\nI realized bringing back the things I\nlove is important because it reminds me\nthat there is just so much to live for\nlife can be so very beautiful if you\nlook in the right places\nI also begin to be kinder to myself\ninstead of punishing myself for every\nfault every flaw\nI begin to see the small beauties of\nLife once again they aren't major huge\nthings but then again\nmost beautiful things rarely are\nit's a cool breeze on a hot day\nit's homemade cookies and lemonade it's\nmusic that calms my mind\nthese things I treasure in my heart as\nit begins to heal from the damage it\nwent through it has been two weeks two\nweeks of days when I have felt on top of\nthe world and days when it has come\nCrashing Down\ntoday I step into work\nthey tell me the inevitable that I've\nlost my promotion and that I will have\nto work to earn it back\nit hits me all at once I knew what was\ncoming I really did but hearing those\nwords out loud was like a blow to my\nheart I thought that I was ready to move\non that I had been doing so great in my\nrecovery that I was strong enough\nI think What hurts the most is that this\nproves that I'm not\nfeelings flood into me I suddenly feel\nlike I can't do this like it's so much\nall at once so I do what I told myself\nnot to do\nI walked away\nat first I feel incredibly guilty and\nhated that I walked away I feel like a\nfailure I feel like everything my mom\ntold me I was\nnothing simply a burden to everyone I\nmeet why can't I be better why can't I\nbe smarter why can't I be more adaptable\nthese questions haunt me for a few days\nI feel myself falling back into familiar\nhabits after this one setback\nand I hate that above all\nit takes me a while to come to terms\nwith the fact that I'm just not ready to\ngo back to work\nhealing can take a while and I have to\nlet that happen before anything else\nit's been a few months\nand in these months so much has happened\nthe major difference I made is that I\nbegan to remind myself of how I felt\nwhen I had those beautiful days how I\nfelt fulfilled and how I would think\nI want this to last forever\nit took me a while to realize that this\nfeeling could last forever if I wanted\nit to\nand that is when my life changed that\nbeing said if I said that my recovery\nhas been a smooth easy process I would\nbe lying to you it was in fact hard and\nunpredictable and strange as any\ntransition in your life might be\nof course still some days are so much\nbetter than the last filled with all\nthose pockets of peace and beauty\nothers are filled with exhaustion and\nblankness\ntears and numbness no one claimed it was\nto be easy or smooth\nno it's filled with tears and grief and\neverything in between\nbut maybe there's some beauty in that\nprocess too"
