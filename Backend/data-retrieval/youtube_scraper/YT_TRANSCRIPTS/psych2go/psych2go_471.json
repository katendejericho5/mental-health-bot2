    "transcript": "hello psych2go viewers Our Guest for\ntoday's live stream is renowned\npsychiatrists and scientist and founder\nof mindx Sciences Dr Alexander nicolescu\nover the last two decades Dr Alexander's\nincredible work includes the\ngroundbreaking development of blood\ntests for psychiatric disorders and he's\nbeen featured on PBS Fox News BBC News\nABC News and so many other Publications\nthat showcase his amazing work welcome\nDr Alexander thank you so much for\njoining us today\ngreat to be with you Michelle\nabsolutely so can you tell us a little\nbit about yourself and your background\nyeah so I'm a psychiatrist I see\npatients who get referred to me from you\nknow from colleagues primarily at this\npoint\num could implicated cases and so on\nI also run two large research Labs at\nIndiana University School of Medicine\nwhen I'm a professor where we do a lot\nof this sort of Cutting Edge work and in\naddition I founded a company minded\nSciences to take these products out\nthere so people can have access to them\nso we developed apps we develop blood\ntests that can be used to bring more\nprecision and Clarity to mental health\nto help people sort of take charge of\ntheir own Mental Health\num you know not have to go through that\nwhole uncertainty trial and error\nprocess\num all those issues that are sort of\npart of current practice in the end you\nknow it's individuals who benefit the\nmost from these I mean certainly these\ntools help doctors and therapists and\ncounselors and coaches and so on but in\nthe end it's your life so you better\ntake charge of it and you know make sure\nyour things are going in the right\ndirection\nthank you so much for that and before\nanything else I just want to know what\ninspired you to work on such an amazing\nmental health development like just it\nwas it like something personal\num because it's just something so\ngroundbreaking yeah yeah uh so in in my\ncase actually uh ever since I was a kid\nI wanted to work on the brain I felt it\nwas like the ultimate Frontier so\nwhen I was in high school I wanted to be\na theoretical physicist but then I\ndecided you know the human body the\nbrain are much more interesting so I\nwent into ultimately the medical school\nthen did graduate work my graduate work\nwas in genetics and at that time we were\nstudying the genetics in of cancer that\nwas back at Scripps and in San Diego\nCalifornia and\num cancer is\nwas very much ahead of psychiatry in\nterms of having you know genetic tests\nthat can inform\num you know what type of cancer you have\nwhat treatment you should be on and so\non so then after I finish my grad at\nwork and went back and um to finish my\nclinical training at UC San Diego and so\non I brought a lot of those insights\nfrom cancer into\nPsychiatry and wanted to see if we can\nuse some of the same genetic tools the\nsame Precision Tools the mental health\nmental health you know\num is a bit uh\nbehind was a bit behind other Medical\nSpecialties at that time we just wanted\nto you know make Psychiatry just\npart of you know regular Healthcare\nregular life you know nothing sort of\nmysterious or esoteric and and really in\nthe end part of primary care and\npreventive care when you go to your\ndoctor for your animal or your\npediatrician you should get some of\nthese\nassessments and tests done just like you\nget assessed and tested for screen for\nanything else so you can catch Things\nEarly intervene early and so on so so\nthat was really the the motivation to\ncan we can we do something where\nI could combine sort of my passion for\nunderstanding the mind with bringing\nsome precision and relief to how\nclinical practice is done and we've been\non this journey my group has been on\nthis journey for over two decades now\nwow yeah we've uh I've moved to Indiana\nalmost 20 years ago specifically to to\nwork on this uh there was an opportunity\nhere to develop a long-term study in a\nstable population to follow people over\ntime see when they're doing well not\ndoing well get theirs blood samples for\ngenomic studies and just this sort of\nlong-term approach has been very\nproductive for us and I think we're\nalmost caught up if not caught up with\ncancer at this point we can have you\nknow precision and\nwho knows in some areas we may be a\nlittle bit more advanced because it's\nnot just about biology and doing you\nknow uh precise lab testing and genetic\ntesting you also have to understand how\npeople feel think and behave so we\ndeveloped\num digital for that in particular we\nhave an app that we released called life\nand mind\n[Music]\ndownloadable from the Apple Store Google\nStore people can use that to take charge\nof their lives to measure in a precise\nway how they feel think how life events\naffect\num their feelings thoughts behaviors yes\nvery comprehensive so it's basically\nyour mental health in a\nin a nutshell in a nutshell and\nat that point because a lot of the times\npeople treat mental health and health\ncare as if they're two different things\nbut mental health is health care right\ncorrect yeah mental there's no there's\nno Health uh Health without mental\nhealth mental health thank you yeah yeah\nI mean and that's what that's our\nmission here at psych to go thank you so\nmuch for that and so I'm gonna you know\njust start with my first question how do\nyou believe that the development of\nblood tests for anxiety and depression\nwill revolutionize mental health and the\nHealth Care system at Large\nyou know so I like to say it's sort of a\nsmall step for medicine but it's a big\nstep for\num the field of psychiatry in Psychiatry\nwe weren't used to be able to\nobjectively assess how people feel and\nthink until we developed these blood\ntests and you know if you think about it\nfrom the person's perspective there's a\nlot of uncertainty in their mind you\nknow is this really happening what am I\nfeeling\num is this uh just uh me being uh you\nknow weak as the sort of uh fluff of\ncharacter why can't I get over this and\nso on so when you do you know these\nblood tests and see you know there's\nsomething objective it's not that you\nknow mysterious just like you have\ncertain things that are off when you\nhave diabetes and so on it's something\nobjective that's happening uh there's no\nStigma no shame\num it guides treatment uh that that\nremoves a lot of the uncertainty and\nstigma that still surround unfortunately\nyou know mental health disorders\nso that's on the patient side\num and you know they can be reassured\nthey can seen as the treatment working\nare the but you know the biomarkers\nimproving those you know uh molecules\nthat are being tracked by the blood test\nthen from a clinician perspective again\nit you know it removes uncertainty\ndiagnosis and Psychiatry if you're just\nsort of relying on the current DSM or\ntrying to sort of fit people into those\nboxes is\nvery very imprecise most people end up\nwith multiple labels you know depression\nanxiety PTSD borderline whatever you\nknow and uh that sort of uh\nyou know an implicit way of saying you\nknow patients are complex they have\nmultiple things going on we're trying to\nput these labels on them for insurance\nreasons for you know so we can have\nsomething to to have us as a primary\ndiagnosis and maybe as a you know to\nguide treatments but those are imprecise\nnow when you have you know objective\nthings that say well this is you know\nthis is depression this is bipolar this\nis anxiety this is primarily you know\nPTSD and so on then that clarifies\nthings and in addition these tests that\nwe devote match people's in a\npersonalized way to existing treatments\nso you you would see you know you might\nbenefit from lithium or you might\nbenefit from\nuh escitalopram or you might benefit\nfrom this or that in a personalized way\nas opposed to your doctor\num thinking you have depression they\ngive you an antidepressant and you have\nbipolar and that that depressor makes\nyou worse or trying medications that are\nnot a good fit for you biologically and\nso on so it helps patients it helps\ndoctors\num it helps everybody I think because in\nthe end if you had this as part of your\nanimal right when you go to your primary\ncare doctor your pediatrician for your\nannual exam and you get an extra blood\ntube for your mental health\num you could catch early on before\nsomething develops you know if if you're\nyou know if you're if things are moving\nin the wrong direction and uh you could\naddress them early on and it's much\nbetter to try to prevent things than to\ntreat something when it's full-blown\num avoids a lot of uh\nyou know\num misery for the patient uh disruption\nto their lives ER visits\nhospitalizations things yes thank you\nfor that and just to add to that and I\nhad a question for you as well do you\nthink that developing these blood tests\nand treating it more like\nyou know kind of like the way you would\ntreat like cancer like taking a blood\ntest or a pregnancy test diabetes or\ndiabetes do you think you'll help\neliminate the stigma that you see so\nmuch with mental health people not\nbelieving it's real that it's just made\nup\nabsolutely and that that's what a lot of\nmy patients tell me like thank you so\nmuch DOC for developing these things\nbecause now I see it's not just in my\nhead other people can see you know I'm\ngoing through these things there's\nsomething real happening inside of me\nthat's that's leading to this Behavior\nso I think that would be sort of a\ndirect consequence of of normalizing you\nknow mental health and making it just\nlike any other medical specialty removes\nall the stigma already through the work\nthat you and others are doing you know\nthere are all this uh well-known people\ncelebrities and so on that you know come\nout and say look you know I have bipolar\nI have depression or I suffer from panic\nattacks and so on and that helps but\nstill you know just having something\nobjective showing you know it's a\nbiological abnormality it can be treated\ncan be improved it can be resolved uh I\nthink it's very helpful and it's a\nrelief to patients yeah and it's so\ninteresting that it's been you know it's\na long time coming because they haven't\ndeveloped this up until now you know you\nguys are starting to develop this but\nhow can we think that these types of\ndevelopments have developments haven't\nbeen made yet because when you think\nabout it panic attacks anxiety\ndepression a lot of those disorders have\nlike people experience a physiological\nreaction yet we still can't test it and\nas of right now we still can't test it\nhim but we still can't measure it the\nway we would measure diabetes and all of\nthat why do you think after all this as\nof right now we can actually test it so\nwell now but like why has it been such a\nlong time coming yeah um it's it's very\nhard to to develop this test so it\nlooked it took us 20 years of hard work\nand the reason being you know for\nexample\nyou know in cancer you can biopsy the\ntumor and then correlate uh you know\nwhatever blood test to develop with\nwhat's happening in the tumor and so on\nin Psychiatry we can't biopsy the brain\nright yeah\num so it we had to you know do this all\nthis detective work and careful\nstep-wise Discovery validation testing\nof things that correlate with symptoms\nand you have to be you know very\nthorough and careful how you identify\nthese things validate them make sure\nthey are real reproducibles and we did\nall that and we published all that\nbefore we launched any of the tests so\nit's not easy that's the short answer\nit's not easy\num because you're trying to find an\nobjective measure for a subjective\nfeeling right you have this first you\nknow people feel and think whereas in\ncancer there's a tumor in diabetes you\nknow there are other\num objective things that you can cross\nmatch with and colon cancer you have a\ncolonoscopy that you match your\nliquid biopsy blood tests against that\nand so on\num so I think that was the primary\nreason also\nPsychiatry right or wrong you know\nmental health in general is viewed as\ncomplex you know the current DSM has\nover 300 diagnosis\ncategories\num and that sort of complexity and\nconfusion and criterias and how do you\nwhat do you diagnose Etc has\num\num also made this harder we went for\nvery simple quantitative phenotypes we\ndeveloped our own tools to measure mood\nanxiety stress so you can get the number\nat this moment in time for your anxiety\nfor your mood for your stress and that's\nall in the life and mind app and that\nsimplified things you know instead of\ntrying to find biomarkers for depression\ndepression is something very\nheterogeneous and you know there are\nmany subtypes we found biomarkers that\ntrack your mood state so you know if\nyou're on the low side if you're on the\nhigh side if you go up and down like in\nbipolar so I think being very precise\nabout\nmeasuring feelings thoughts and\ncorrelating that with very precise\nbiological measures has been very\nimportant and that's how we did that\nit's not easy that's why it took so long\nit's definitely not easy it's like\nrevolutionary this is going to\nrevolutionize Healthcare and so I just\nwanted to get into specifics how to do\nthe blood tests how do the blood tests\nyou're developing determine whether\nsomeone has anxiety or not like what is\nthe exact process I know that in one of\nthe PBS documentaries I was watching\nabout you know your development is that\nyou guys test biomarkers so can you\nexplain that to our audience yeah yeah\nso biomarkers it's a sh you know it's an\nabbreviator for biological markers these\nare molecules in the blood that are a\nmarker of disease whether it's disease\nseverity at that moment in time or\ndisease risk so a simple way to think\nabout it is that for example for\ndiabetes which is very common disorder\nglucose is a biomarker there it's a\nbiological Market you measure somebody's\nglucose blood sugar you know you know if\nis it in the normal range is it abnormal\nat that moment in time\nthere are other markers in diabetes\nthere's one called without being sort of\ntoo Technical and playing the doctor\nhere but um it's called hemoglobin A1c\nthat one if you measure it it tells you\nlike more like long term whether you\nknow you've you know this is more of a\nlong-term thing as opposed to the\nglucose which fluctuates you know from\nhour to hour depending if you ate or not\nso by analogy that\nthose two types of those two categories\nof biological markers for different\nmental health conditions some that\nmeasure State at that moment in time how\nanxious you are at that moment and some\nthat measure your long-term risk of\nhaving future worsening of your anxiety\nepisodes that can land you into ER in\nthe hospital and so on and you know\npeople often ask me like well you know\ndo I need a blood test to tell me that\nI'm anxious right now I can feel it you\nknow yeah you\nyes you don't need a blood test you know\nyou to to tell you that I mean you're\nexperiencing what you're experiencing\nand that's the truth of the you know\nthat's the reality what you're\nexperiencing is what matters but you\nmight need the blood test to help\num you know confirm that there's a\nbiological process that can be addressed\nthrough therapy or through\nnutraceuticals or to medications yeah\nand so just sorry to injure I wanted to\nknow and would the biological markers\nhelp determine if it's genetic\nyou know uh this is a very good question\num\nlet me dispel a myth\neverything is Gene and environment\neverything in biology and medicine and\nlife all of who we are and what we do\nour genes and environment interacting\nit's just in some cases it's more the\ngenetic predisposition unless the\nenvironment and in some cases is\nprimarily the environment you're going\nthrough really bad things in your life\nand those really affect your biology but\nin the end our biology upstairs and\ndownstairs are genes getting turned on\nand off depending on your genetic\npredisposition and what's happening in\nyour environment or what medications\nyou're on or what drugs what stressors\nEtc so in the end it's all genes and\nenvironment and that's what we measure\nwith our biological markers we measure\ngene expression how active certain key\ngenes are and that's the result of your\ngenetic predisposition and of your the\nenvironmental things that you're going\nthrough\nso that's sort of the the Zen answer to\nthe Quran it's both genes and\nenvironment yeah and I feel like I feel\nlike sometimes people don't want to\naccept that like maybe it's in their\ngenetics to be uh predisposed to\ndepression anxiety I think that's also\nwhere the stigma comes from as well\nright but you know your genes are not\nyour destiny you can modify them with\nwith therapy with lifestyle changes with\nnutritional supplements with medications\num so I think it's actually a very\nhopeful message that uh you know even\nthings that have\nwhere there's a predominantly genetic\ncomponent can be corrected and modified\nthat's how medicine works you're\nmodifying gene expression with\ntreatments and improving you know yeah\nyeah and so I was going to ask how do\nbiological markers in the blood\ncorrelate with brain function brain\nfunction and the behavior yeah so you\nknow that that was the key thing you\nknow why would you see something in the\nblood that reflects what's happening in\nthe brain right and there are um three\nreasons for that so\nthe brain and the immune system really\nwhen we're looking in the blood we're\nlooking at the activity of immune cells\nwhite cells the brain in the immune\nsystem are very closely linked together\nduring your embryonic development they\nare highly\ninterrelated tissues then after you're\nborn there's still a lot of brain immune\ninteractions so you know how you feel\nand think your stress can affect your\nimmune system this is why when people\nare stressed out they are more prone to\ndevelop flues colds Etc\nand conversely your immune system can\nhave a strong impact on your brain you\ncan you know when you're\nsick and you're in an inflammatory State\nand so on it really affects how you feel\nthink you become depressed\nyour cognition is impaired on someone\num and the third reason is they're the\nsame genes upstairs and downstairs\nenvironmental components turn on and off\nthe same genes upstairs and downstairs\nwhether it's stress hormone or\nmedication or some other sort of\nenvironmental things from the external\nenvironment or from the internal media\nso for those three reasons we're able to\npick a peripheral signature that\ncorrelates with what's happening in the\nbrain you have to be very careful so\nthat's why we do these things it takes\nus many years to identify and validate\nand test these things because it's like\na needle in the haystack many things are\nchanged in terms of in the blood in\nterms of gene expression and so on how\ndo you find the real signal that tracks\nwhat's changing the brain is the\nchallenge and we develop very careful\nmethods to do that and that's been the\nyou know what\nhelped us achieve these breakthroughs\nabsolutely and on the point of the\nBreakthrough I want to test but for our\naudience segment I wanted to know when\nis your blood test development going\nlive when are we going to see it in\npharmacies right now we're going to see\nit in clinics hospitals everywhere\nNationwide\nso I have good news and bad news okay\nthe good news is these blood tests are\navailable right now from my index\nSciences there are seven blood tests\nthat are being offered\nso we have a blood test for mood\ndisorders that can tell you whether it's\ndepression or bipolar severity future\nrisk what medications what\nnutraceuticals blood test for anxiety\none for stress one for pain which is\nanother subjective\num you know issue where having something\nobjective is very helpful to patients\nand doctors one for suicide risk one for\nmemory disorders and one for longevity\nso we have seven tests currently on the\nmarket we'll have probably three more by\nnext year we're working very hard on\nsomething for psychosis uh it's under\npeer review at the major journal now\nwe're working hard on something for ADHD\nand um we have we may have something for\num alcohol use disorders as well so\nthese so the good news the tests are\navailable the bad news is that these\ntests are very expensive you know all\nthis technology to do them and so on and\nand currently yeah so currently uh they\nare self-pay we're working very hard to\nget them reimbursed so we're putting\ntogether uh data and studies and so on\nto go to Medicare to go to insurers to\nget them reimbursed because we feel very\nstrong with that everybody should have\naccess to them but currently they're\navailable only as self-paid to a\npatients uh and doctors who prescribe\nthem who you know patients who can\nafford them so I think the the big\nmission for us over the next year or two\nis to move these into being reimbursed\nand so on so good news they're available\nbad news they're not yet reimbursed and\nthey need to be I mean we\nthey should be like National by now\nright this is an amazing development I\nmean an international I mean we have you\nknow people from doctors and patients\nfrom other countries who have ordered\nand received the results of these tests\num the the issue uh with um\nreimbursement and so on is that um\nyou have to go through a very sort of\nelaborate careful process for that and\nwe've already been working on it for a\nyear so we have you know some initial we\nhave some codes for the test we have\nsome initial pricing decisions what for\none Medicare approves it and so on but\nthe you know the steps that have to be\ndone take a long time you know to get\nsomething uh approved and uh we you know\nmind that Sciences is a relatively small\nstartup\num we are now sort of uh\nwe got more investment and we're going\nto use those Investments to do the\nnecessary groundwork to get these tests\nreimbursed so it will take probably a\nyear or two I'm very conservative so I\nsay Euro to if it happens sooner that'd\nbe great but you know that would be\namazing soon enough this amazing\ndevelopment but in the main country you\nknow I'm always like glass half full in\nthe meantime something else that's very\nuseful and affordable is instead of\ndoing this Blood liquid biopsy blood\ntesting which is still expensive uh\nalmost everybody or everybody could do a\ndigital biopsy they could use the life\nand mind app to really get in a\nquantitative way\nuh you know how they're feeling thinking\nand those are sort of very simple\nstate-of-the-art measures that were used\nto develop the blood tests so in the\nmeantime and that they are used along\nwith the blood test for patients who get\nthe blood test but in the meantime you\ncan just get the app\nget a very comprehensive assessment of\nyourself\num and keep track of how you feel and\nthink and then it's like a Fitbit for\nthe mind you can look you know that\nappointment to your therapist or doctor\nand say look these are the numbers I've\nbeen going up and down or I've been\nstaying guys guys download the app I'm\ndownloading it today right after this\ninterview download it you this is just\nrevolutionary be part of this so yes\neveryone download the app what is it\ncalled again can you repeat it it's\ncalled life and mind\nX and mind life and it's available on\nApple right Apple and Google both places\nyeah amazing so that brings me to our\naudience segment where we answer your\nviewer questions I'm super excited we\nhave a lot of people in here so let's\nbegin so our first question is from\nMiranda she asks doctor\nwhen will you guys develop blood tests\nfor schizophrenia I was diagnosed years\nago and this would be very helpful\nyeah so thank you for that question we\nactually have developed something but\num it's currently we like to publish the\ndata in a peer review journal before we\nlaunch the test on the market so at this\npoint the the manuscript the study\ndescribing that work is that under\nreview at the major peer review journal\nonce it goes to the peer review process\nand it's published then we will launch\nthe test also at mindex Sciences might\nbe six months usually at this sort of\nhigh level Journal it takes a while to\nget things published and we always\npublish in sort of high visibility high\nimpact peer review journals at that time\nwe'll launch it at my index sciences and\nyou know it'll be accessible to\nPhysicians to order it for their\npatients and it doesn't have to be you\nknow psychiatrist you know any physician\nany prescriber can be a physician\nassistant nurse practitioner can order\nthis test we wanted to make it easy for\npeople to have access to them since\nthey're so new and uh not everybody and\nevery psychiatrist might know about them\nso and also you know a lot of primary\ncare doctor or concierge doctors who are\nthe ones who are actually ordering these\ntests for them it's natural it's part of\ntheir workflow because when you're an\ninternist or primary care doctor you're\nthe blood test all the time when you\nassess somebody and it's just another\nreport that you have there that helps\nyou do your job basically\nso thank you for that doctor and then\nthe next question you'll see it on the\nscreen\num so Jason asks doctor can hypo\nfrontality be proven\num not with\nnot with blood tests or or not so far in\nterms of\num what we've developed but I think\nthere are Imaging tests brain Imaging\ntests that are potentially useful for\nthat I don't know that they are used as\npart of routine clinical practice but\nthere are things like pet scans\nthat stands for positive emission\ntomography pet scams or maybe functional\nMRIs and so on that are used in academic\nsettings in\nresearch setting or I use binaurologists\nactually in clinical practice so that\nmight be a way in which you could get\ntested to see if the frontal part of\nyour brain is uh\nmore or less active\nthank you and then Eric win asked a very\ngood question does every blood cell hold\nmeaning to something psychological\nno no\num you know you have red blood cells and\nwhite blood cells these are you know\nyou're essentially testing the immune\ncells the white blood cells and their\nprimary job is to you know do their\nimmune function but they closely reflect\nand interact with the brain uh there is\nsignal inside them that we are able to\nmeasure and track that's relevant to\nwhat's happening in the brain but it's\nnot like you know you have a blood cell\nfor anxiety a blood cell for depression\nand so on you have panels of biomarkers\nmeaning you know dozens of biomarkers\nthat are best for tracking anxiety\nanother you know panel that's good for\ntracking depression another for pain and\nso on\num but there are no you know blood cells\nthat are specific and for any disorder\nthank you for that for clarifying and\nthen the questions on the screen just\nbecause people are actually very\ninterested in the app could you just\nrephrase it again um acre Mass life X\nmind is what the app is called so you\ncan just feel free because they're\nplanning on downloading it yeah that's\nwhat it's called lifx mine yeah perfect\nthank you for that question and then\nthis is a good one and since you're a\npsychiatrist I just wanted to see your\ngeneral thoughts on this Mr sebi asks I\nmight have ADHD what is the best way to\ntell my parents about it\nI'm a big believer in the truth just\ntell them you know what you're\nexperiencing what you're feeling how it\ninterferes or not with your daily life\nwith your school with your job and um\nthere are ways to get tested for ADHD\num the current testing is\nneuropsychological where you\num you know you go to your school\ncounselor or outside uh psychologist and\nyou get the battery of tests and they\ncan establish you know\num fairly well that you have a diagnosis\nof ADHD if you use the life and mind app\nwe have a very simple assessment there\nwhere you can actually track your\nattention your ADHD and from day to day\nso that sort of gives you an idea if it\nfluctuates what events affected and that\ntype of data might be useful as well to\nyour therapist your clinician and so on\nI mean\nas an aside you know before we had these\nthe technology and the apps and so on\npatients would come to me and I was I\nwould ask them how has your mood been\nover the last three months and they\nwould have to recall how it was right\nwhereas now they just uh you know bring\nthe app and I looked there and it's like\nin an Apple Watch or Fitbit you can see\nexactly the number the states and so on\nso I think for yourself to gain insight\nfor those who help you on this it's\nuseful to have that data because memory\nis very fickle and it's colored by a\ncurrent state right yes thank you to\nthat doctor someone asked I suffer from\nexcessive anxiety about the future I am\na student and I have a problem with\noverthinking the events of my life do\nyou have any advice I think this is a\ngreat question because not just as a\npsychiatrist but you've been a student\nso I just want to know what your advice\nis to this viewer and I'm a parent as\nwell yeah that's amazing kind of\nstudents so a mentor of a lot of\nstudents over the years you know all you\nknow from undergrads to Med students as\nwell as young faculty yeah now this is a\ngreat question so what we're noticing\nnowadays you know as professionals and\nin society in general is this increasing\nanxiety it's a huge increase in anxiety\nespecially in younger people and\nespecially in um\nin females\nand their variety of reasons for that\nyou know things are moving faster\nthere's all the social media comparisons\nall those things that are happening and\nwe we just went through covet a lot of\nthings going on so\num\nthe the best advice is like for anything\nin order to\nimprove it so the first step is you know\nacknowledging that there's a problem\nuh assessing it with an app or a blood\ntest or by talking to a trained\nprofessional\nand then doing something about it and\nthe way to do something about it is\nwhat we call I don't want this to sound\ntoo fancy but biops psychosocial right\nso you have to improve you know let's\nstart with bio uh you have to improve\nyour biology a little bit so you're a\nbit more resilient to anxiety so that\nmeans you know guarding your sleep so\nyou get enough sleep\num meditating if you are so inclined\nit's very useful in terms of calming\nyour brain in your biology trying to\ntake a walk in nature or exercise every\nday very useful trying to eat\num you know\na healthier diet with a lot of fruits\nand vegetables and not a lot of junk\nfood\nall those things make your biology\nbetter change the genes that you know\nunderlie your brain function your body\nfunction and the brain and the body are\nhighly interconnected so that's the bio\npart of dealing with anxiety just making\nyourself more resilient the\npsychological part is\nyou know you break things down into\nsmaller bits and you deal with them one\nthing at a time instead of worrying\nexactly just trying to like fix the\nwhole issue it taken take it day by day\nstuff\nfor let's step forward and then you know\nslowly you realize hey you know I can\ncope with this and then you know builds\nconfidence and then you can cope with\nthe next thing and so on we've we've all\nbeen through that we've all been through\nthat and then socially you know avoid\nenvironments\nor activities uh or inputs that make you\nmore anxious whether that means no are\ntoxic yeah yeah whether that means you\nknow cutting down on some social media\nthat's negative uh stopping you know\ncomparing yourself obsessively with\nother people yeah\nrunning your own race\num except this YouTube channel but other\nsocial media you know yeah right thank\nyou watch psych2go but just avoid\nInstagram every day yeah I mean uh\nthere's all those social comparison are\nputting a lot of um uh fake pressure on\nyoung people in the end you know run\nyour own race be your best self that's\nwhat matters and stop comparing yourself\nwith other people so sort of um\narranging your social environment in a\nway that is nurturing and helpful to you\nas opposed to stressful and anxiety\ngenerating so those are some things you\ncould do even without medications now if\nit's sort of severe anxiety short term\nor medium term you could also get\nmedications and a trained clinician can\nhelp you with that our blood tests can\nguide somebody a doctor who orders them\nto see you know what's what are the best\nmatches and so on definitely thank you\nand then I just wanted to bring up this\ncomment Danny said say hi to the doctor\nfor me\n[Laughter]\neveryone is coming up from Jason thank\nyou so much for that donation as well\ndoctor should there be more tests in\nmental health facilities for\nhypofrontality if not why why so\nso as I said you know we don't have yet\na blood test for hypofrontality but\nthere are Imaging tests for that\num and again Imaging tests are a little\nbit more expensive you know putting\nsomebody in a brain scan and uh you know\na functional MRI and so on I think it's\na very interesting area that needs to be\ndeveloped in the future and um\nif I wasn't doing what I'm doing which\nis working on the biological basis with\nthe blood tests and so on\num you know this is something else that\nyou know I would have been sort of\ninterested in doing like Imaging the\nbrain directly and seeing you know what\ninsights we can get there and they're\nyou know good researchers good\nclinicians who are trying to do that so\nI would be optimistic that in five to\nten years we'll have maybe more portable\ndevices and more inexpensive ones that\ncan be used routinely in\nclinical care there's also futuristic\nstuff going on there's a company in La I\nthink called Colonel that's made a\nhelmet to measure wow blood flow in the\nbrain I have no affiliation with them so\nthis is not a like endorsement or\nadvertisement that's I don't entirely\nunderstand their process but there are a\nlot of good development science is great\nyou know science always moves things\nforward and makes life's life better for\npeople for society and so on if done\nproperly I mean you can you know science\nhas also been used for a lot of uh uh\nyou know not so great things but true\nscience done properly has always sort of\nadvanced Society so I'm very optimistic\nabout the future and about how some of\nthese things can become part of routine\ncare and once they become more\nwidespread\num they're more affordable because when\nyou do something at scale at volume the\nprice goes down and then everybody can\nhave access to it and that's exactly our\nvision that's all that's what we want so\nlike just to not just normalize it so\nthat it's widely available and it can be\naffordable because often a lot of people\ndon't get you know mental health care\nthat they need because it's just so\nexpensive\nyeah but\num it's um the argument that we're going\nto make to insurers and so on and\nemployers is that it's much more\nexpensive to hospitalize somebody or\nhave them you know they are repeatedly\nor or or you know not do their job or or\nyou know flounder around\nthen then to get them the proper\num assessment and treatment right from\nthe beginning so you always have to make\nthe money argument with payers\nabsolutely with Karma with all of them\nbecause you all know like yeah it's so\nit's so great for patients for their\nfamilies as a clinician you know it's so\ngreat to have those tools to help people\nuh when you go to payers and insurers\nyou also have to make the economic\nargument so yeah it's very hard to\nrefine that so that they can see the\nMerit in these things which is a sad\nreflection of our society but you and\nyour team are doing the best to make our\nsociety a better place so thank you so\nmuch for that and you're also fighting\nthe same good fight thank you\nwith psych2go's Mission definitely\nthat's what we're trying to do to expand\nmental health education and so that\nconcludes our you know our audience\nsegment with our amazing site to goers\nthank you for your amazing questions I\njust wanted to start our final thoughts\nsegment and I just wanted to know\nso do you think and I know that as a\npsychiatrist like you've seen a lot of\npatients and things have changed over\nthe years because of the Advent of\nsocial media do you think that social\nmedia is creating like a depression\nanxiety epidemic among our younger\ngeneration do you think that the need\nfor blood tests and so much medication\nfor depression is kind of a sign of just\nthis epidemic of\nyou know the younger generation feeling\nmalaise and feeling jaded about what\nthey see on social media and comparing\nthemselves absolutely a hundred percent\na hundred and ten percent I think you\nhit the nail on the head and you know I\nwould recommend uh\nto your um audience to look up\num this author Johan\nj-o-h-a-n Johann Hari\nh-a-r-i Johan Hari he wrote three great\nbooks uh one is about attention and ADHD\nanother one is about depression and\nanother one is about addictions\nhe's done an amazing job of of looking\nat all the potential biological\nenvironmental social media cause and so\non he's also you know a great writer and\nuh those books are best sellers he has a\ncouple of TED Talks that have I don't\nknow 15 million viewers 20 million\nviewers\num I'll link it in the description\nso I would highly recommend that again I\nhave no connection with uh with Johan I\njust uh think he's a good guy who's done\na tremendous service to society by his\nexploration of ADHD depression and\naddictions in those three books that\ntrilogy of books and my my um my\nexperience my thoughts my professional\nopinion is the same that\nsocial media has been extremely\ndetrimental for younger people who are\nthe heaviest users exactly in the ways\nthat you mentioned they\num it's an addiction it's a it's a very\nstrong addiction and it distracts them\nfrom their daily life it\ndistracts them from doing things that\nare more healthy for them like real\nworld experiences in nature with friends\nSports going outside and so on and that\ncomparison between yourself as you are\nand the\nfake portrayal or somebody yes their\nbest self on social media you don't see\nthem when they're not doing well you see\nthem you know when they're only when\nthings\nthat comparison is very depressing\nanxiogenic stressful it's also an Avenue\nfor a lot of negativity for Mob\nmentality for bullying for for so on so\nyes uh if I was you know I had you know\na magic wander I would delete\nsocial media apps most of them from uh\nmost people's phones they are useless\nand uh not only useless in the long term\nbut toxic now you need to socialize with\npeople but it's very important but do\nreal connection like talk to them in\nperson or talk to them on the phone or\ntext them\nmeet with them you know you have\nnowadays all this amazing technology to\ndo that uh don't go on those streams\nthat are extremely addictive and where\nyou get caught in that Loop and then you\nknow you dissociate and then five hours\nhave gone by and you know you feel worse\nthan at the beginning and you've wasted\nyour life basically absolutely and\nremember guys a lot of what you see on\nsocial media is fake like Dr you know\nlike the doctor mentioned a lot of what\nyou see is just like people putting\ntheir best selves out there or\nfabricating things just to make their\nlives seem better than what they are\neveryone goes through it no one has a\nperfect life so just remember that and\nso with that being said thank you so\nmuch for joining us my pleasure Michelle\nI really enjoyed it and keep up the good\nfight and uh for all of you out there\nfor all of you out there you know uh\nthings are improving constantly so keep\nan eye out on developments and you know\na lot of people are working very hard to\nmake mental health better including our\ngroup including you yes\nyes thank you very much have a nice rest\nof the day everybody absolutely thank\nyou to our psych2go viewers we love you\nhave a great day\nbye bye"
