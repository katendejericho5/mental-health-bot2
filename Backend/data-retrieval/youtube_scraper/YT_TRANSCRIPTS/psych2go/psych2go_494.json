    "transcript": "have you ever heard the term betrayal\nbonding a specific kind of traumatic\nbonding this unhealthy attachment is\nborn out of betrayal trauma the first\nperson to study betrayal trauma was\npsychologist Dr Jennifer fried in 1996\nand in 1997 Dr Patrick Carnes and later\nDr Bonnie Phillips published a book\nelaborating on it and how to break free\nof the exploitative relationships that\nbind us exploitative relationships can\ncreate trauma bonds that tie us to the\npeople who hurt us in ways that are\ndestructive to our mental health\nself-esteem personal boundaries and\noverall well-being but arguably the\nscariest thing about it is that experts\nsay you can easily mistake it for love\nwith that said here are six telltale\nsigns that it's betrayal bonding not\nlove number one past present abuse\nin her research with children who had\nbeen abused by their parents Dr Freud\nobserved that instead of processing the\nBetrayal in the usual and expected\nmanner the children became even more\nbonded with their parents she theorized\nthat this was because the Betrayal was\nin conflict with their need for survival\nand desire for Parental love and care\nand that the children didn't want to\nalienate their parents and provoke more\nabuse and less love for example I won't\nfight back when I can't leave them yet\naccording to Karns and Phillips these\nfindings have since then been\ngeneralized to many different contexts\nand types of relationships so if you\nfeel a strong attachment to a person who\nhas ever abused you be it physically\nverbally emotionally or psychologically\nthen there's a good chance that a\nbetrayal bond has been formed number two\ncodependency another warning sign of a\ntoxic and exploitative relationship is\ncodependency psychotherapist Sharon\nMartin defines codependency as an\nunhealthy relationship Dynamic where one\nperson derives their happiness and sense\nof self-worth solely from another common\nin Parental and romantic relationships\nthis can happen when a significant\nperson in your life constantly neglects\nand criticizes you only to then love\nbomb you and guilt you into taking care\nof them they send you mixed signals so\nthat the more they degrade you the more\nyou will want to please them and crave\ntheir validation which brings us to our\nnext Point number three manipulation\nwhen someone manipulates us\npsychologically and emotionally it can\nbe easy to mistake their manipulation\nfor love according to mental health\ncoach Kim Saeed these tactics are how\nabusers form and maintain the Betrayal\nbonds of their victims so it's important\nto be aware of them some examples\ninclude love bombing and gaslighting\nlove bombing is when they shower you\nwith love and attention to make up for\nthe abuse they've inflicted they will\nlikely Gaslight you as well to minimize\nthe seriousness of what they've done\ninvalidate others criticisms about their\nactions and make it seem like they're\nthe victim in all of this because you\nwrongly and harshly accuse them number\nfour power imbalance\naccording to Karns and Phillips in a\nrelationship bonded by betrayal the\nperson exploiting the other holds all\nthe power which often comes from the\nvictim's emotional investment in their\nrelationship but can also include the\nbetrayers financial control and social\ninfluence over them the betrayer can\nprioritize their needs all the time\nwithout any consideration for their\nvictim and use their relationships\nsolely for their personal gain and\nsatisfaction number five irrational\nloyalty\nspite of all these things however you\nmay still feel an irrational loyalty to\nthe person you formed a betrayal bond\nwith you may find yourself constantly\ndefending them to your friends and\nfamily justifying or rationalizing their\nabusive actions and even distancing\nyourself from your loved ones for this\nvery reason says Karns and Phillips\nnumber six repeated Cycles finally but\nperhaps most importantly you know it's\nnot love but betrayal bonding when you\nfind yourself trapped in a vicious cycle\nof abuse manipulation loyalty and\ncodependency this is because according\nto Carnes and Phillips betrayal\nintensifies pathologically the human\ntrait of bonding and deep attachment in\nthe presence of danger or fear simply\nput when you experience betrayal and\nabuse from someone you love but feel you\nhave nowhere else to turn to it can be\neasy to mistake your betrayal bond for\nlove it's important to understand that\nif you continue to stay with someone who\nbetrayed you it's not your fault you are\nmost likely the victim of their abuse\nand manipulation regardless don't\nhesitate to seek help if you suspect\nthat you are in an exploitative or\nharmful relationship building a support\nsystem for yourself and talking to a\nmental health professional about your\nstruggles can help you safely extricate\nyourself from the relationship and begin\nthe recovery process let us know your\nthoughts on this video in the comments\ndown below and click on our upcoming\nvideo to watch next and
