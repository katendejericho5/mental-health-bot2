trouble in the\ndating world do you just wish you could\nfind your perfect someone without all\nthe complications of dating\nwell good luck with that just kidding\nthe dating scene can become frustrating\nfor all of us who have ever had our fair\nshare of bad dates so maybe you just\nneed a bit of advice to help get the\nball rolling again to help you out here\nis a list of the only dating advice\nyou'll ever need number one the most\nimportant thing respect\nyou need to trust each other's\nintentions how can you do so without a\nlittle respect healthy couples whose\nrelationships last their secret is\ncommunication and respect for each other\nso if you notice your date is a bit\ndisrespectful to you express that this\nis a problem or recognize that it might\nnot work and remember to respect your\ndate as well number two allow intimacy\nto progress naturally\nso you like someone a lot it's only the\nfirst date but you can't wait to tell\nthem hold it right there while honesty\nis the best policy revealing how often\nyou think about them may add too much\nunnecessary pressure on your first date\nyou need to allow some room for the\nnatural progression of intimacy take it\nslow take it easy and reveal how you\nfeel but make sure not to reveal too\nmuch all at once it is just the first\ndate after all number three don't limit\nyourself to one type\nwhile some of us may think our perfect\npartner will meet all of our criteria we\nmay be wrong and that idea is very\npossible so what could you be missing\nout on just because your date doesn't\nlike Star Wars as much as you doesn't\nmean they can't be the perfect match\njust because you share different\ninterests doesn't mean you won't connect\non a deeper level\nand just because they're not tall and\nhandsome doesn't mean you couldn't be\nattracted to them in the future if our\ntype is always changing I guess we don't\nreally have one type do we number four\ncommunication is key\nmost people say communication is one of\nthe most important keys to a successful\nrelationship that and respect are a\ngreat combo pack it's important to be\nhonest with who you're dating if you're\na bit uneasy about something express it\nif you enjoyed your afternoon don't try\nto play it cool or play hard to get\ninstead tell them you enjoyed getting to\nknow them be honest about who you are\nand how you feel as long as it's not a\nbombardment of Love Confessions on your\nfirst date number five focus on who you\nare now\nearly on in dating it's a good idea to\nfocus on the person you are now rather\nthan discuss your past self it's\nimportant for couples to know a bit\nabout each other's past but the time\nwill come for that later those first\ncouple of dates show them who you've\nbecome try not to talk too much about\nyour mistakes or exes early on they're\nhere to get to know who you are now\nwhich brings us to number six don't\nalter who you are important tip don't\ntry to pretend you're someone who you're\nobviously not\nif you think your date would love a\nhandsome bad boy or a cool girl don't\nshow up wearing a leather jacket when\nyour go-to is knitted sweaters if we\nalter our personality or style to fit\nour dates expectations they'll be\nattracted to someone who doesn't really\nexist will only attract people who are\ncompatible with someone else so those\naviator glasses you picked out for this\ndate stick to your prescriptions number\nseven don't control the conversation\nit's important for both dates to show\ninterest in each other this means you\nshouldn't spend the whole two hours just\ntalking about your dreams and goals ask\nyour date how they feel and give them\ntime to ask you some questions too\nremember that's about how both of you\nfeel and if you're compatible you'll\nnever get to know if they're too\ncompatible with you if all you do is\ntalk about yourself and number eight be\nwith someone for the right reasons this\nshould seem like easy advice to take but\nmany individuals get lost in other\nreasons for being in a relationship\nmaybe your friends and colleagues\npressured you into a certain kind of\nrelationship maybe your family expected\nyou to be with this kind of partner\nwhatever the reason it's important to\nevaluate why you're with your partner is\nit because you're truly happy around\nthem that already sounds like a great\nstart\nwhich advice will you take are you lost\nin the dating world or have you already\nfound your special someone\nwhat was it about them that made you\nfall Head Over Heels share with
