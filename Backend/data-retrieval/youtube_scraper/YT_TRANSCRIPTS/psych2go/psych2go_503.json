    "transcript": "Tough Love is Real Love why because it's\nnever easy it hurts to give her far more\nthan the receiver said decorated\nmilitary pilot and Vietnam war hero\nBobby M Miller\nwould you agree\ndo you believe in tough love\nbeing a bit of a polarizing subject some\npeople say yes While others would say no\nthose who say yes believe it's necessary\nfor discipline and setting healthy\nboundaries while those who say no\nbelieve it could lead to some unhelpful\nrelationship Dynamics or at worst\npsychological and emotional harm\nbut no matter which side you belong to\nit's important that we all understand\nthe difference between tough love and\nemotional abuse so we can know when it's\ncrossed that line with that said here\nare five important warning signs that\nit's emotional abuse and not tough love\naccording to experts emotional\nblackmailing\nthe term emotional blackmail was first\ncoined by therapist and author Dr Susan\nforward she described it as when someone\nuses fear obligation and guilt to\nmanipulate you\nand one of those reasons why this is a\nclear sign of emotional abuse is because\nfor emotional blackmail to be used\nagainst you you need to be emotionally\ninvested in the relationship and it's\nthat attachment that they exploit to get\nwhat they want examples include playing\nthe victim and guilt-tripping you\nwalking out on you stonewalling giving\nyou the cold shoulder and having\ndramatic emotional outbursts\nhumiliating and degrading\nno matter how angry you are with someone\nrepeatedly name-calling insulting and\nbelittling someone is never okay\nespecially if they do it in front of\nother people\nthese kinds of behaviors are already\nconsidered emotional abuse because\nthey're meant to diminish and attack\nyour sense of self-esteem a common\ntactic for emotional abusers according\nto licensed family therapist Dr Beverly\nEngel shame is the most damaging effect\nof emotional abuse Dr Engel says because\nit makes victims believe that they are\nunlovable and deserve the emotional\nabuse\nthe worst part is these feelings and\nself-esteem issues can linger long after\nthe emotional abuser is no longer in\nyour life\ncontrolling\ntough love comes from someone who wants\nwhat's best for you but emotional abuse\ncomes from someone who wants to control\nyou so while both can sometimes include\nlecturing you emotional abuse actually\ncrosses the line by giving you direct\norders and making your decisions for you\naccording to a Healthline article\nmedically reviewed by psychologist Dr\nJacqueline Johnson other examples\ninclude\nmonitoring your whereabouts digitally\nspying on you and controlling your\nfinances these behaviors are abusive\nbecause they take away a person's sense\nof autonomy create unhealthy boundaries\nand invade their privacy\naccusing and gaslighting\nalthough we can all agree that sometimes\nwe need to take a firm no-nonsense\napproach with the people we love\nespecially when we feel that they've\ndone something wrong wrongly accusing\nand gaslighting someone is never\nJustified trivializing serious issues\nand invalidating another person's\nfeelings can be considered a covert form\nof emotional abuse says certified\nprofessional life coach Sherry Gordon\nbecause it can lead to confusion loss of\nconfidence and self-esteem and\nuncertainty of one's mental stability\nwhen done repeatedly for a prolonged\nperiod of time\nemotional abusers will also often turn\nthe tables on their victims by denying\nthe abuse and blaming you for all the\nproblems\nemotional neglect and isolation\nemotional neglect is another often\noverlooked form of emotional abuse that\ninvolves the abuser deliberately\nwithholding their affection and\nwithdrawing from you as a manipulation\ntactic according to the University of\nRochester Medical Center's Health\nencyclopedia this is done to make you\nmore dependent on the emotional abuser\nand desire their validation more after\nthey reject you similarly they will also\ntend to make an effort to isolate You by\ncoming between you and other important\nrelationships in your life so that you\nprioritize them over everyone else and\nother people have a harder time\nrealizing what's really going on\nso do you relate to any of the things\nwe've mentioned here did this video help\nyou to better distinguish between tough\nlove and emotional abuse to summarize\nalthough tough love can sometimes\ninvolve a certain level of severity it\nnever crosses the line towards a lack of\nhumanity or empathy for the other person\nremember emotional abuse is just as\nserious and harmful as physical abuse\nand people of any age or gender can\nexperience it it can also happen in the\ncontext of romantic platonic or familial\nrelationships\nso if you believe that you might be\nexperiencing emotional abuse trust your\ninstincts and do not hesitate to reach\nout to someone about it prioritize your\nown needs and safety and exit the\nrelationship if you can\nshould things escalate get in touch with\na mental health care professional or\nother emergency services today\nuntil next time friends thanks for\nwatching and remember you matter\n[Music]"
