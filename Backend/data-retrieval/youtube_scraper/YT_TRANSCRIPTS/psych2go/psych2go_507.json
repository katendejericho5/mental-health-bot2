    "transcript": "has your crush been acting a little\ndifferent around you lately but you\ncan't decide if it's good different or\nbad different it can be difficult to\nfigure out if someone is into you or not\nespecially if they're not saying it\noutright a 2015 study found nonverbal\ncommunication has a huge influence on\nsocial interactions basically it's like\nwhat hitch says ninety percent of what\nyou're saying isn't coming out of your\nmouth nonverbal communication is huge\nwhen you're talking about your crush so\nwhat are you missing if your crush likes\nyou let's talk about these six things\nthey might do this video is based on\npersonal opinion and previous\nexperiences everyone is different and\ncan show affection in different ways if\nyou think someone is into you always be\nsure to have a conversation with them\nlet's begin number one they use\nprotective gestures when they're around\nyou\nhave you ever been driving with your\ncrush or partner in the passenger seat\nand had to slam on the brakes your\ninstinct is probably to keep hold of the\nwheel and throw your other hand out in\nfront of the passenger to help keep them\nsafe\nthis is called a protective gesture\nbut they don't always need to be huge\nActs it can be as simple as opening a\ndoor walking on the street side or even\nhanding you coffee while warning you\nit's hot these small gestures show a\nspecial level of care and that they not\nonly like you but they're also looking\nout for your well-being and want you to\nbe okay\nmost likely your crush doesn't do this\nfor everyone so keep an eye out next\ntime you're in a group of friends with\nyour crush do they dote on their other\nfriends too if not they probably like\nyou number two they become a little bit\nof a copycat in the best way\nsome say imitation is the best form of\nflattery when you like someone or\nsomething say a celebrity in their style\nyou tend to copy it\ndoes anyone remember when Avril Lavigne\nfirst wore a tie so all the girls did\ntoo\nit works the same way with your crush if\nthey like you they might mirror the way\nthat you speak your energy level or they\nmay even start using the same words you\ndo but they're not trying to make fun of\nyou subconsciously they like you a lot\nso they start picking up those little\nmannerisms which means they might like\nyou\nnumber three it gaze into your eyes but\nnot too much when you and your crush are\ntalking where are they looking\neye contact is one of the most telling\nsigns that someone is into you eye\ncontact shows that you're interested and\nit can also make the person who you're\nlooking at feel loved and attractive as\nlong as they feel the same now we don't\nwant 100 eye contact stirring contests\nhappening which can actually be related\nto aggression or being territorial or\npossessive and can make you feel super\ncreeped out but a little eye contact\nhere and there can be a great sign that\nyour crush likes you number four they\nlaugh with not at you when you're\ntalking with your crush and tell them a\nfunny anecdote about yourself their\nresponse can reveal any hidden feelings\nthey may have if they don't really\nrespond to the story they might not have\nbeen listening which may mean they may\nnot like you if they use your story as a\nway to make fun of and belittle you they\ndefinitely don't like you and don't\nsound like they have your best interest\nat heart now the third reaction is what\nwe're looking for this is when they\nlaugh with you at how funny the\nsituation was maybe it was some\nlight-hearted teasing and use this as a\nway to bond and know you on a more\nintimate level\nnumber five\nthey don't use anything to block you\nfrom them they actually keep pretty\nclose whenever someone feels\nuncomfortable a polite way to create\ndistance is to use an object this might\nbe something like holding your books in\nfront of you to avoid an unwanted hug or\nmaybe holding a backpack close to you as\na shield in situations where a level of\ntact is needed such as being at work and\nnot being able to tell someone to get\naway from you but your crush will do the\ntotal opposite\nthey'll want to use more open body\nlanguage and remove any obstacles\nbetween you two you'll notice they sit\nclose to you too which is a sure sign\nsomeone has a crush on you and number\nsix they call you with big news\nit's 2022. if someone's calling you it's\nprobably either your student loans or a\ntelemarketer a text is usually\npreferable but when someone you know\ncalls you with big news good or bad\nthat's totally different they not only\nwanted to physically tell you but they\nwanted to hear your reaction too it can\nalso mean that they wanted to tell you\nbefore anyone else or posting it on\nsocial media do you do this with just\nanyone of course not so if your crush\ndoes this they probably like you\nit can be hard to put yourself out there\nwhen it comes to revealing your feelings\nespecially when it's a 50 50 shot but\nhopefully you now have a few Tools in\nyour toolbox and can spot some signs\nthat your crush is into you if you spot\nsome let us know in the comments below\nwhat do you do next we want to know as\nalways the references and studies listed\nare in the description below and\nremember keep an eye on Zai for more\npsych2go content until next time thanks\nfor watching"
