taking care of ourselves is selfish\nbut in reality self-abandonment can have\ndire consequences for our well-being\nneglecting our own emotions opinions and\nvalues can lead to a sense of emptiness\nand disconnection from our true selves\nthat's why it's crucial to recognize the\nsigns of self-abandonment and make a\nconscious effort to prioritize self-care\nand self-love so let's dive into the\nwarning signs that you may be neglecting\nyour own needs people pleasing never\nfind yourself saying yes to requests\ntaking on more responsibilities than you\ncan handle or putting your own goals and\ndesires on the back burner to\naccommodate others this is people\npleasing while it's natural to want to\nhelp others when you constantly\nprioritize their needs before your own\nit can be a sign that you're abandoning\nyourself according to therapist and\npsychology Professor Dr Teo Smith\nindividuals who tend to prioritize the\nsatisfaction of others over their own\nwell-being should explore ways of\nassisting others without causing harm to\nthemselves you can do this by setting\nboundaries and respectfully declining\ntasks that don't align with your comfort\nlevel while still offering your support\nfor the ones that do without a solid\nfoundation of self-care you can't truly\nbe there for others in a sustainable way\nyou seek external validation\nwhen you always put the needs of others\nbefore your own you can develop a strong\nsubconscious desire to receive praise\nrecognition and validation from them as\na way to feel good about yourself but\nchanging yourself to fit others\nexpectations can result in self-hatred\nanxiety and stress especially when they\nfail to validate you in the words of\nWilliam Shakespeare self-love my liege\nis not so vile a sin as self-neglecting\nremember that there is nothing wrong or\nshameful about who you truly are when\nyou learn to love yourself and stop\nseeking external validation you can\nauthentically integrate every part of\nyourself into everything you do this can\nhelp you build genuine relationships\nwith others as well as with yourself\nyou avoid emotions this can look like\ntaking on a job that you don't feel\ncomfortable with being in a friend group\nthat conflicts with your values and\nprevents you from being your true\nauthentic self or pushing your emotions\nto the side\nthis creates a buildup of anxiety and\ninner tension you may try to find\ncomfort in other ways by venting getting\ndrunk or eating unhealthily however\navoiding your emotions only perpetuates\nthe cycle of neglect ever feels
