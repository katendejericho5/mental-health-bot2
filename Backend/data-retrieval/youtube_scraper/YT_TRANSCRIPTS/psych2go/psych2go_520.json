is to\nmake content on psychology and mental\nhealth more accessible to everyone now\nback to the video\ndo you know someone who is or might be a\nnarcissist\nnarcissistic personality disorder also\nknown as NPD is characterized by a\ngrandiose sense of self-importance the\ndeep-seated need for praise and\nattention and a lack of empathy for\nothers but while the disorder itself is\npresent in a rare few a lot more people\nactually have narcissistic tendencies\nbefore we start we'd like to mention\nthese are just some examples of what a\nnarcissist would say after all there are\na variety of ways to say them also if\nyou relate to this video please do not\nuse the video to self-diagnose or\ndiagnose others a person who has\nnarcissistic Tendencies does not\nnecessarily have a narcissistic\npersonality disorder\nwith that said here are 10 of the most\ncommon things narcissists say and what\nthey really mean\none if you could have just one friend\nwho would it be while it might seem like\na harmless question it's a subtle way\nfor them to emotionally manipulate you\nthey may ask this in hopes that you'd\nsay it's them if you don't they may get\nupset at you and give you the cold\nshoulder\nit's a way for them to reaffirm their\nsense of self-importance and that you\nshould choose them over your other\nfriends\ntwo we don't need anyone else\na common strategy narcissists use to\nkeep you compliant and loyal to them is\nby isolating you from everyone else\nwhile it may sound flattering when they\ntell you that all you need is each other\nwhat they're really trying to do is make\nyou dependent on them and them alone\nthey don't want to compete for your time\nand attention because they want you all\nfor themselves\nnumber three you're always overreacting\nhave they told you that you couldn't\ntake a joke when you called them out for\nsaying something hurtful did they say\nthat you were too sensitive\na narcissist will never own up to the\nabuse they inflict on you but rather\ntrick you into thinking you're the one\nat fault\nthey'll make you second guess yourself\nand as a result enable their bad\nbehavior by rationalizing it\nminimalizing it or by making excuses for\nthemselves\nfour\nnot everything's about you\nwith a narcissist everything needs to be\nabout them all the time\nyou can't ever steal the spotlight from\nthem or they'll resent you for it they\ndon't care about your problems or what\nyou're going through instead they'll\nproject their own self-centeredness onto\nyou and make you feel guilty or\nembarrassed about taking the focus away\nfrom them even if it's just for a second\nnumber five wow no wonder nobody else\nlikes you\nto a narcissist the key to keeping you\nin line is by destroying your sense of\nself-esteem and making you feel like you\nhave no one else to turn to\nthe more alienated and alone you feel\nthe less likely you are to leave them\nthey may prey on your insecurities and\nmake you think that no one else can ever\nlove or care for you the way they do\nnumber six I always defend you to\neveryone else and this is how you repay\nme\nwhen a narcissist tells you this it's\nfor three reasons firstly they want to\nturn you against the people you love by\nsaying that they secretly hate you and\ntalk about you behind your back\nsecondly they want to play the hero and\nswoop in to save the day\nbut mostly they want to make you feel\nlike you need to reward their so-called\nactive kindness by never speaking out\nagainst them and by paying them back\nwith more loyalty praise and obedience\n7. you only succeed because of my help\na narcissist is likely to take credit\nfor your accomplishments they might brag\nabout how you couldn't have done it\nwithout them or how you owe them much\nfor your success\nthey want to share in your glory remind\nyou that you're nothing without them\nnumber eight\ndon't let this get to your head\nwhile they may pretend that they're\nhappy and supportive of you deep down\nthey're rooting against you\nthey want you to fail to make them feel\nmore comfortable about themselves\nno matter how well you do or how much\nyou succeed they'll find ways to make\nyou feel less important than them\nnumber nine\nI'm the best you'll ever have\nnarcissists want you to think that\nthey're the best thing that's ever\nhappened to you they want you to think\nthat they're the best friend and\nromantic partner you've been looking for\nand that it would be the biggest mistake\nof your life to leave them\nnarcissists may also make it seem like\nthey've stooped down to be with you\nsince you're Unworthy of them\nand number 10 I'm only doing this\nbecause I love you\nmost importantly narcissists will try to\njustify their mistreatment of You by\nsaying that they're only doing it out of\nlove or that they have your best\ninterest at heart what they may really\nmean is that they enjoy being able to\ncontrol and exploit you for all that you\ngive them\ndid anyone in particular come to mind\nduring this list\ndo you think you might have a narcissist\nin your life let us know in the
