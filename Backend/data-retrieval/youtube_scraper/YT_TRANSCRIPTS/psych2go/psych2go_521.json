what others think so our actions\nand decisions will usually reflect what\nothers want from us licensed\npsychologist ARA yaras notes that\nDisney's in Kat dough showcases many\nprime examples of societal pressure in\nthe case of the super strong Louisa she\nis genuinely struggling with meeting the\nexpectations of others and wonders what\nwill happen if I could shake the\ncrushing weight of

pressured to\nbe extroverted in the western world as\nnoted extroverts are highly regarded as\nleaders in team players while introverts\nare often mislabeled as aloof or\nanti-social hermit types this societal\nmislabeling can make many introverts\nlook down on themselves as less than\nothers and make them feel desperate to\ndisplay extroverted traits that often go\nagainst their true nature in response\ncognitive scientists and humanistic\npsychologist Scott Barry Kaufman\nconcluded that the biggest key to being\na happy introvert is simply\nself-acceptance not forcing oneself to\nrepeatedly act out of character or to\nthink of oneself as merely a deviation\nfrom an ideal personality instead of\npretending to be someone you're not\naccept and embrace who you are
