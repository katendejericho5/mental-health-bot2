expert panel the first is\nDr Tracy marks she's a general and\nforensic psychiatrist with over 20 years\nof experience you may recognize Dr marks\nfrom her own YouTube channel of over a\nmillion followers where she creates\ninsightful and educational content\ncentered on psychiatric disorders and\nmental health the second is clinical\npsychologists and narcissism expert Dr\nRomney she's the host of her own YouTube\nchannel which has over a million\nsubscribers and her own podcast\nnavigating narcissism Dr Romney's work\nhas been featured on Vogue tedx red\ntable talk and the Today Show just to\nname a few a huge welcome to both of you\nthank you so much for joining us today\nour audience is extremely excited me\nright I'm a big admirer of Dr Mark so\nI'm very honored to be here with her oh\nwow well thank you same here and happy\nuh doing this with you yeah me too me\ntoo guys we have over 600 people in here\nthat's like insane oh my God\nso I wanted to start off the first\nquestion on the topic of narcissistic\nabuse often when the topic of narcissism\nis discussed people tend to focus more\non understanding the narcissists rather\nthan thinking about how the narcissists\nnegatively impact those around them\nand narcissistic abuse inflicts serious\ndamage and Trauma to a person's psyche\nand mental health\nso what are some signs that a person may\nbe a victim of narcissistic abuse and\nwhat are some of the physical and\nemotional symptoms that one can identify\nin themselves or another person\nI'll let you go ahead and start yeah so\nthis phenomena this phenomenon of\nnarcissistic abuse is\nnarcissistic abuse is actually the\nbehavior that happens in a narcissistic\nrelationship right so it's the it's the\nexperience of invalidation and\num manipulation and gaslighting and\nentitlement and rage and dysregulation\nthat's the stuff that happens in the\nrelationship that is the narcissistic\nabuse what happens to the person in the\nrelationship is something we could term\nThe Fallout of narcissistic abuse if you\nwill right so these are the things that\nhappen to a person if they're\nchronically in a relationship like this\nand these would be things like uh\nconfusion self-doubt self-blame anxiety\nsadness anger a sense of helplessness a\nsense of hopelessness powerlessness you\nknow is the more severe the narcissistic\nabusive behavior is the more severe The\nFallout is with some people really\nhaving symptomatology that looks more\nlike it's in line with complex post\ntrauma so we see a range of reactions\nbut the the short answer is no none of\nit's good it definitely takes a person\nand throws them very off balance with\nthe central tendency being that a person\nblames themselves and doubts themselves\nand really wonders are they the one\nwho's doing wrong so that's what it does\nand you asked also about physical health\nissues what we do see is that people who\nare experiencing narcissistic abuse for\nexample often stop caring for themselves\ntheir sleep is often disrupted because\nthey're ruminating they're often so\nabsorbed and how can I make this work\nwhat am I doing wrong why do they keep\nbetraying me that they may not adhere to\nother healthy daily practices that might\nbe taking their medication or eating\nhealthy or exercising there's sort of\nthis overall devaluation that happens to\na person in a narcissistic relationship\nand that extends to how they treat\nthemselves now as with any chronic\nstressor which obviously chronic\nnarcissistic abuse is over time that's\ngoing to have health effects that kind\nof accumulative interpersonal stress and\nwe know that interpersonal stress and\nbetrayal stress really represent unique\nHealth stressors because of the the\nother kinds of psychological Fallout\nthat come there what we'll often see is\nthat a person might I've worked with\ncountless numbers of clients who had far\nworse Health outcomes than they should\nhave under the circumstances and what\nthe treatments they had these are people\nwho would say they had a more\ncomplicated course of severe illnesses\nlike cancer that their autoimmune kind\nof recovery was much much more\ncomplicated that existing psychiatric\nconditions were worsened so this is sort\nof like dropping a bomb into a person's\nhealth and when you keep in mind that\nthe narcissistic person is not likely to\nlift a finger for this person someone\nthat somebody believed might be a\ncaregiver this is my spouse this is my\nfamily member is nowhere to be seen when\nsomebody gets sick so you can see that\nthis is a very big phenomenon when we\nlook at it sort of all 360 degrees and\nthere's no doubt that it takes a toll on\npeople and it's very specific to this\nkind of a relationship\nexactly and for Dr Tracy marks from a\npsychiatric standpoint when you're\nseeing patients who are dealing with\ndepression and anxiety stemming from\nnarcissistic abuse what are some coping\nstrategies and treatment options you\nrecommend\nokay so I was actually going to\npiggyback on what Dr Romney was saying\nabout uh the effect that it has on\npeople\num in my experience uh how bad uh how\nbadly someone is damaged depends a lot\non when they experience the abuse so if\nyou've got someone who it was at the\nhands of a parent those people tend to\nto look more like the complex PTSD uh\nsymptoms where it affects their own\npersonality and how they interact with\npeople versus the person who may have\ngone through their childhood and\ndeveloped some level of healthy\nself-esteem but then getting an abusive\nrelationship with someone\num and it still takes a toll on them but\nthey're able to recover better than the\nperson for whom it started in their own\ndevelopment\num I see a lot of people with depression\nand anxiety\num stemming from this they may have\ndepression that's independent of the\nabusive relationship but even what what\nI'll see is that in treating them and\nlet's say their depression is improving\nthere's still these self-esteem issues\nand there's still a lot of negative\nself-talk that they have that is not\njust based on being depressed or\ndepressive ruminations but it's based on\nhow they've coped with and dealt with\nthis these abusive relationships exactly\nand Dr Romney did you want to add to\nthat or I think you know Dr Marx brings\nup a really important Point here too is\nthat she in talking about the shaping of\nidentity in the sense of that's what\nthese narcissistic relationships do to a\nperson the earlier in the developmental\nSpectrum it happens the more impactful\nthat's going to be because the sense of\nself is still developing so clearly a\nnarcissistic parent is going to have the\nmost profound impact on on a person's\nsense of of sense of self because really\nwhat the narcissistic parent does is\nthey they have in essence sort of\nhijacked the child's identity the child\nis sort of existing for the parent the\nparent it's almost a parasitic\nrelationship where instead the parents\nsucking dry the child and the child\nreally gets the message that the only\nway they will survive is to really\nrelent to what this parent wants which\nas you can see is a precedent that not\nonly will be a dynamic they'll carry on\nbut it really impacts them the other\nthing we do want to remember is that\nthis is on a spectrum of severity I\ncan't highlight that enough one thing we\ndo know is that narcissism and\nnarcissistic personality styles are\nassociated with violence and aggression\nso in some cases of narcissistic abuse\nwe will see co-occurring physical or\nsexual violence and aggression happening\nobviously the outcomes for people who\nare experiencing that are often quite a\nbit worse however I cannot put too fine\na point on what long-term exposure to\npsychological and emotional abuse can do\neven in the absence of physical and sex\nand or sexual violence and by that I\nmean I have seen people who they have\nentered narcissistic relationships in\nadulthood that lasted long enough from\nwhich there was no Escape I mean I think\nwe can never ever\nunderestimate that cultural religious\nFinancial intersectional elements that\nmean a person's often trapped the more\ntrapped oftentimes the more profound\nthese effects are our identity is\nlargely formed by adulthood but if a\nperson's in a 30-year narcissistic\nrelationship and somebody's saying\nyou're worthless you're worthless you're\nworthless you're worthless it will\nactually result in adult shifts and\nshapes we know that trauma can shape\npersonality both for good and bad and I\nthink narcissistic abuse at its most\nsevere forms would really qualify as Big\nT trauma\nabsolutely and like just going off of\nthat for both of you how does complex\nPTSD manifest ever after a severely\nabusive relationship with the narcissist\nand what are some like coping methods\nand treatment options for someone\ndealing with that because I feel like\ncomplex PTSD there are people who suffer\nfrom it and don't even know\nafter a relationship like that I'm going\nto defer to Dr Mark's expertise there\nwe'll take a turn see because we're this\nis this is a healthy relationship where\npeople take turns\nabsolutely but I'll recognize my\nlimitations I have enough self-esteem to\nbe able to do that\num so\nyou know with complex PTSD people\num because of it's almost like a\ncracking of the vase that starts really\nearly on so that it never forms properly\nso you can have it so you you you can\neasily unravel and have uh difficulty\nmanaging your emotions emotions\ndysregulation and even be more\nvulnerable to other types of abusive\nrelationships because you don't know\nmuch else I mean this is what you're\nused to\nso trying to\num so what are some signs what would\nthat look like well some signs can be\none being in numerous relationships\nwhere your needs aren't being met and\nyou're feeling used or you know hurt or\nharmed by that like why would that\nhappen\num other signs maybe even\num feeling uh you know I mentioned the\ndepression and anxiety before but having\nthese\num difficulty\num dealing with anxiety and having low\nfrustration tolerance and things like\nthat can be signs of early abuse that\nhas just kind of seeped its way into\nyour personality in the way that you you\nhandle and cope with life stressors you\ndon't have as much\num uh emotional fortitude to be able to\nhandle these things\nand like what are some like coping\nstrategies that you were into like maybe\npatients that you've seen like just some\nexamples\nyeah so it kind of depends on what the\nproblem is and what they're doing\nbecause there's not just a one-size-fits\nall just do this and you know you'll be\ngood\num I think if the focus if you're trying\nto help someone say\nstop repeating a cycle of being being\nattracted to the to the wrong person a\nperson that you know that doesn't serve\nyour needs or continues to repeat the\npattern\nhelping that person\nrecognize what is it that is that they\nare attracted to sometimes the\nattraction is the drama the negative\nattention and things like that because\nthat's what you're used to so helping\nthem see that you need to look in a\ndifferent direction some people aren't\nattracted to the boring guy because even\nthough that's the best person for them\nbecause they're used to someone\ncriticizing them and them getting in\nthis pattern of needing to try and get\nvalidation from this person that they'll\nnever get so helping them recognize some\nof these patterns\num as a digression just because it's\nsomething I thought of I've heard this\nbefore a lot um from like psychologists\nand everything is it true that people\ntend to date their worst parent that's\nwhat people always say like in\nPsychology videos what do you guys think\nwell I was raised if you will Freudian\nuh and so uh which I know not everyone's\ninto\num but yeah that was kind of the\nthinking is that you are trying to\nrepair a damaged early Dynamic and you\nkeep and so you're attracted to that\nperson to try and correct that\nexperience now that you have more power\nand control\nwhether that's actually the case no that\ndoesn't always bear out to be that way\nbut sometimes that is the dynamic what\ndo you think Dr Romney I I mean Dr\nMark's answers are right on on the point\nand she's and again as trained as in in\nFreudian methods I really would defer to\nour answer because I think that there's\nmore you know that she has a more\nscholarly wisdom around that is it feels\nright you know I think that the reason I\nalways I'm very careful with those kinds\nof simple interpretations is many people\nthen feel doomed and the one thing I\nwant to let people know is that this is\nnot as deterministic as we think that it\nis you know one of the great tragedies\nof the world is not enough people get\ninto therapy young enough and when they\noften do it's often because there's a\nmajor major issue at play severe\nPsychopathology but this idea of people\nsort of entering into a course of sort\nof exploratory therapy with someone to\neven understand some of these Dynamics\nbecause I don't think somebody is doomed\nbut I think what does happen is exactly\nas Dr Marx explained is that that\nlikelihood code that we are trying to\nwork through past conflicts and when\npeople start dating and start meeting\nmates they're often quite young you know\nHigh School relationships can be more\nimpactful than you think especially if\nthey're not healthy and it can also in\nadolescence identity is still shaping so\nthose early dating experiences actually\nin some ways can be more impactful than\nsignificant adult relationships we have\njust because of where our central\nnervous system is so I think that\nthere's probably more than a shred of\nTruth to that and you know I mean Dr\nFreud's one of those things where you\ngot to take you gotta take the good with\nthe bad with him right but but the thing\nis that I I think that it is not it's\nnot that simple and I don't want people\nare thinking like oh yeah yeah I had\nthis horrifically narcissistic parent\nI'm doomed I don't think anyone's doomed\nthat's why channels like yours and Dr\nMarx and my channels exist to give\npeople education as they're going\nthrough these processes so they're not\ntrying to clean up a mess but might be\nable to prevent one before it happens\nyeah and usually people who say that\nlike oh that's for everyone usually they\naren't experts they're kind of just\nthrowing something that they found on\nthe internet and they're like yeah this\nis you know the case right and so can I\ncan I say something I really like the\npoint uh you brought up uh Dr Romney\nabout dating in high school\num I think it's counterintuitive what\nyou said we think of well this just\npuppy love oh it's not gonna matter when\nreally it's more impactful than we think\nbecause of the uh the maturity or the\nlack of maturity at that time\nso that's a great Point usually people\ndon't forget about their High School\nrelationships it has like an impact\nlater in life yeah and then in terms of\nlike relationships and Trauma bonding\nwhy do some survivors feel so bonded and\nin some cases deeply in love with the\nperson who inflicted the narcissistic\nabuse because that's sometimes the case\nwhere someone just can't let go of the\nnarcissist or the abuser\nwell so trauma bonding which is a term\nthat's often very misunderstood so\nthere's a really great chance to clear\nit up is that it is a a very very deeply\nfelt Bond a person has typically in an\nintimate relationship but it can be any\nrelationship but an intimate\nrelationship most commonly that is\nthat's often created by the alternation\nbetween good and bad and that\nalternation that there are moments that\nfeel like this person hung the Moon it\nis very idealized they are remembering\nthings it's the love bombing it's the\nwhole thing and then that gets\ninterspersed with these moments of\nwithdrawal withholding absence Frank\nabuse manipulation devaluation pick an\nAsian it's not going well right so very\nunhealthy relational patterns what\nslowly happens over time is that if you\ntake this back rewind the tape to one\nperson when someone's a child the parent\nis the only place where survival needs\ncan get met so the child has to learn\nall kinds of internal intra-psychic\nmodifications to maintain that\nattachment and in general that usually\nturns inward I'm bad I didn't do good\nbecause at least a child can't control\nthat and so they will attempt to change\nshape morph make themselves better so\nthat those needs get met well that cycle\nrepeats in adulthood and what happens is\nthat that sort of vacillating partner's\nbehavior is rationalized justify they\ndidn't mean it but we had such a good\ntime but they really loved me they're\nstressed they're this all of you\nlistening to this have whatever your\nfavorite justifications are that's what\na trauma bonded relationship looks like\nand that alternation it's not all bad\nand it's not all good in fact it could\nbe 90 bad and 10 good but you can get a\nlot of juice out of that 10 good it\ncreates something that a person feels\nthat they can't leave they'll be and the\ncognitions are things like well if I\nleave now they're just about to change\nand there's a lot of that sort of self\nfuture faking as well as a future faking\nthat happens in the relationship someone\ndangling a carrot it's going to get\nbetter after we graduate it's going to\nget better after we do this it's going\nto get better and then you start doing\nthat like well if I walk away from this\nwhat if everyone's like this and maybe\nit's always like this and and some\npeople will literally say feels Primal\nthey're like and in fact I always say\nthis to psychologists and therapist\ncounselors when I'm training them in\nthis work I say ask your client like\nwhat is it that you find so compelling\nTom you told me you love them so much\ntell me what you like so much tell me\nwhat you love so much and invariably the\nanswer I get back is something like I\ndon't know Doc it's like I don't know\nit's like it's it's like this magical\nkind of I don't know how to put it into\nwords like it I was like okay because\nyou know we're a healthy answer to that\nquestion is we have shared interest we\nhave shared values I feel safe I feel\ncared for that's not what comes up it's\nthis very ephemeral can't put their\nfinger on it because it is very primally\nfelt and so that's what trauma bonding\nis the mistake people make is that\ntrauma bonding is a relationship that\nhappens between two traumatized people\nthis is yeah\nlike it's this very peculiar connection\ncreated in this way and this\ntrauma-bonded kind of experience is much\nmuch more likely to happen to Dr Mark's\npoint in people who experience this as\nchildhood in childhood because those\nkinds of internal modifications and that\nshape-shifting becomes second nature for\nsomeone who had to do that to get very\nfundamental survival needs and safety\nmet at a very early stage of development\nthat kind of self-modification Nation\nthen can become a bit more a bit more\nnatural if you will so it's that backing\nand fourth thing and this is the\nsignature of the narcissistic\nrelationship it's not always bad if it\nwas always bad for example they treated\nsomeone badly in public all the time\nyour friends your family they noticed\nthey'd say yikes what is this but a\nnarcissistic person those multiple masks\nthey can wear they're often the most\nCharming generous gregarious charismatic\nperson in public everyone thinks you're\nlucky as soon as the door is closed and\nthey can go at you and get regulate that\nway no one's seeing that and so there's\neven that level of confusion which only\nadds to the trauma bonded experience\nyeah and if you think you're to blame\nfor some of that then you accept it and\nabsorb it and try to change and try to\nand you say I can do this I can be this\nor I can be that or I can be better I\ncan keep my mouth shut I can try harder\nand so now this person just like they\nwould have done as a child is fully\ntaking responsibility for someone else's\nBehavior Savior and this works out great\nfor the narcissistic person because\nthey're chronically being forgiven and\nlet off the hook and I've seen\nrelationships go on this like this for\ndecades\nabsolutely and just I'm going off of\nthat since you talked about how like\nsometimes people can be people\num on the outside in public can be\nfooled by The Narcissist but then\nthey're doing things behind closed doors\nthat are you know toxic and horrible so\nin that sense how do we effectively\nsupport someone who is a survivor of\nnarcissistic or narcissistic abuse and\nwho's currently dealing with it\num you know just so that we're there as\na you know person of support\nbelieve them you know don't what you\ndon't want to do is is more of that well\nI've never seen them be like this and\neveryone has a bad day when somebody is\nsharing their pain with you\nbe with their pain sit there hear it\nlisten and don't try to solve it because\nthere's often not a solution here and\nwhen we really because I think that what\nhappens is is that again dating just\nlike everything else in this narcissism\nworld's on a wide spectrum there are\npeople who are in marriages with minor\nchildren who don't have a lot of money\nwho are who are stuck right who aren't\ngoing to get a fair Shake in Family\nCourt don't say well you got to get out\nthat's not an option for them and so\ndon't try to fix it simply be don't\ndoubt this this person by the time\nthey're talking to you about it has\ndoubted themselves blame themselves and\nsecond guess themselves so many times\nthat by the they're they're so confused\nso when somebody's telling you this hear\nthem and please never never ever if I\ncan leave everyone with only one\ntakeaway never ask someone why didn't\nyou leave\nit is shaming it is invalidating there\nare hundreds of reasons people don't\nleave including that they still feel\nlove for this person and we don't get to\nsay you don't really love them they're\nmean to you they're having an experience\nthat loss of subjectivity that I get to\nhave an inner world is what's stolen in\na narcissistic relationship if you want\nto be a supporter of someone who's been\nnarcissistically abused let them have\nthat sense of subjectivity it is\nconfusing it does take a minute and even\nif your friend says like is this going\nto take me a while you can't you don't\nget to get exasperated you really want\nto be a supporter say I hear you I get\nyou and I got you I'm right here you\nknow and I'm a safe place to come you'd\nbe amazed at how much more quickly\nhealing happens when people know that\nthey have safe sounding boards and\nplaces they can take their doubts and\nthey're like oh I don't know if I'm\nready to go and and then they will let\nand they can unfold it at their own pace\nit often speeds up the pace for them\nabsolutely like you shouldn't invalidate\nsomeone and they're gonna go at their\nown pace in terms of maybe ending that\nrelationship right they've already been\ninvalidated enough right yeah\nthat takes some self-restraint not to\nwant to jump in and solve for them or\neven think to yourself well okay you're\nnot gonna change anything so why are you\ntelling me this or what do you want me\nto say like the person listening can\nsometimes feel helpless to I don't even\nknow what to say versus I'm glad you\nmade the point that they just want to\nvent and they just want to know that\nthey're not going to be judged for what\nthey're saying\nabsolutely so with that being said that\nbrings me to our audience segment where\nyour favorite and your favorite experts\nanswer your questions I'm so excited\nthere's so many I don't know where to\nbegin but let's let's start with this\none and this one's for Dr Tracy marks\nLauren asks Dr Tracy marks I still\nconstantly suffer from emotional\nflashbacks and I'm experiencing constant\nnightmares about my ex even though our\nrelationship ended months ago is it\npossible I developed complex PTSD due to\nthis trauma experienced in my\nrelationship with the narcissist any\nadvice or treatment options on how to\ncope with this okay thanks for that\nquestion I would say um so usually\num when we refer to or when we talk\nabout complex PTSD it's multiple\ntraumatic events now that could still\nspan a relationship but usually starting\nyoung as opposed to starting I'm not\nsure how old you are but like as an\nadult\num\nyou know I don't want to say maybe you\nknow Dr Romney that that it couldn't be\ncomplex PTSD because it started as an\nadult but normally that's kind of how we\nthink of it as you know multiple traumas\nover a life a lifetime\nparticularly starting Young\num\nI you know I would suggest I think the\nbest way to address uh trauma especially\nwhen it's coming in the form of\nflashbacks and intrusive thoughts and\nNightmares and things like that is\nreally professional help because with\nsomeone who is an expert in trauma\ntreatments I was just talking uh with\nsome people about this today of how do\nyou know when you need trauma treatment\nversus going to see a therapist where\nthey're just going to ask us okay so\ntell me what's been going on this past\nweek\nthe the treatment for trauma needs to go\nWay Beyond just tell me what's going on\nthis past week\num there's evidence-based treatments\nlike EMDR\num Com or CPT which is cognitive\nprocessing therapy and then there's\nprolonged exposure therapy those are the\nthree main evidence-based treatments for\ntrauma and they all work differently and\nI won't get into all the details here\nbut they all work differently and\naddress different aspects of how you are\nmanifesting the traumatic experience\num but they're they're they can be very\ngood at\num\ndirect or\num at addressing specific symptoms you\nhave like the intrusive thoughts the\nflashbacks and the kind of\nre-experiencing\num and in a very\num succinct and specific way that could\nlast you know some people can get EMDR\nthat's like five or six sessions\nversus on the couch for a few years\ntwice a week\nabsolutely thank you for that and then\num the next question is Emma asked Dr\nRomney growing up my parents were hyper\ncritical of me and extremely strict in\nan effort to make me the perfect child\nthey would starve me if I gained weight\nand beat me if I didn't have the perfect\ngrades in school I feel like I didn't\nhave a real childhood because I was\nconstantly bombarded by their demands of\nperfection my parents tell me that their\nabusive treatment of me was worth it\nbecause I turned out to be successful\nhow do I continue to have a relationship\nwith my parents when they can't even\napologize for their abusive Behavior\nit's hurtful and I'm having trouble\nforgiving them so first of all I am so\nsorry you know that that just thank you\nfor asking such a Frank and raw question\nI'm sorry that you'd experience that\nit's a very heavy burden to carry and\nyet you're certainly not that that's not\na you're not alone in that story it's\nsomething that I'm sure my I know I've\nheard many times I'm sure Dr Marx has\nheard as well but this question cuts to\nthe core of a much bigger issue that you\nknow listen I'm not even going to\nspeculate whether these parents are\nnarcissistic what they were though was\nthey were they were viewing their child\nvery conditionally they were really\nplacing sort of this the kind of this\nemotional load on if you do these things\nthat we consider important then you will\nbe loved then you will be valued that\nconditionality is a really tough way you\nknow it's a tough way to grow up because\nyou do slowly but surely you get this\nyou create a model in your mind that\nlove means I'm doing something I'm\nsucceeding I'm look a certain way\nespecially around the weight and shape\nand I just want to make an aside comment\nwhen parents make those kinds of\ncomments on on weight and shape it's\nintrusive when they talk about what are\nyou eating and why do you look like that\nand why are you wearing that it is it is\nintrusive it's a boundary violation and\nand I think that we think it's sort of\nOpen Season to be able to talk about\nthis element of a person but we know\nthat this kind of ideation Growing Up\nThis Way can contribute to an ongoing\nunhealthy relationship with body and\nshape and weight and food and exercise\nand all those things but now you're in\nadulthood and now you face this larger\nprospective these are my parents this\nisn't like a dating relationship or\nintimate relationship we're like I could\ntry this again like you kind of get one\nshot at this one and you you feel very\nhurt\nthere's a process of grief that one does\nneed to navigate in an ideal situation\nthat this is done in therapy because\nit's a unique grief your parents are\nstill living they're very much there and\nyet you you look back on this childhood\nthere are no do-overs so there's a grief\nabout what got lost how this shaped your\nidentity how it continues to shape you\nand and in and what's making this group\nthat can magnify this grief is this sort\nof\nthe sense it almost feels like a\nbetrayal that this person has these\npeople have done this to you and there's\nno awareness there's no accountability\nnow I'm gonna again I don't know if this\nperson's parents are narcissistic don't\nknow enough about the case but when one\nthing I do know is when working with\nfolks who over sharing a history is\nquite clear that their parents are quite\nnarcissistic is that the\nthat sense of it never being made right\nright one of the hardest things about\nany narcissistic relationship parents\nanyone is the lack of accountability\nthat comes up the lack of responsibility\ntaking the lack of I'm sorry genuine\ngenuine Contrition that people say I\nnever quite feel whole because they\nnever saw and they're never going to see\nit so the hard work becomes getting to\nfeel whole through radical acceptance\nand realistic expectations and really\nunderstanding what the limits of this\nrelationship are to the person who asked\nthis question everybody will have a\ndifferent approach to this you've one of\nthe hardest elements of this is in most\nof these cases when people have these\nkinds of maladaptive invalidating rigid\nand un and and personality Styles where\nthere's no taking of responsibility\nthere's very low likelihood of change it\nsounds like you have talked to them and\nbecause of that low likelihood of change\nthat's the radical acceptance that I now\nknow what these folks are about this is\nthe hand I was still and I have the\nfreedom to choose how I'm going to keep\nthese people in my life you may very\nwell find that listen the way I feel I\ndon't have I don't want to fully cut\nthem off for whatever reason but it's\ngoing to be very superficial I'm going\nto show off I'll log time at family\nevents and then again the grief that you\ndon't have parents that you would have\nsort of as lifelong supports there's a\nlot of things that are happening at the\nsame time but then it takes us to this\nmuch bigger issue of forgiveness and\nthis has got to be one of the most\nthorny issues in people who've\nexperienced any kind of narcissistic\nabuse my positioning on this for any of\nyou who have ever watched my YouTube or\nany of my programs or anything you know\nI'm not a big fan of forgiveness in\nthese relationships and there's actually\na really interesting body of literature\non this that when people forgive people\nin relationships and they get repeatedly\nbetrayed it actually really does a\nnumber on their mental health it's\nharmful to forgive under those\ncircumstances this idea of all\nforgiveness is good forgiveness is\nactually kind of a cross that if you\nforgive someone and they keep doing\nwrong by you it is actually going to\nharm you and that right there is the\nCrux of narcissistic relationships\nyou're going to keep forgiving them they\nview that as permission like okay\nbecause I can do what I want and and in\nsome cases it's completely Unapologetic\nso that destination of forgiveness be\nvery careful that you don't feel like\nthis is going to be sort of a Panacea\nsomething that fixes everything I'm\ngoing to forgive them and it's going to\nbe fine there's actually a risk it won't\nbe fine and it could make things worse\nespecially if they keep betraying you\nand especially if they're not taking\nresponsibility but in fact the path\nforward to Healing is radically\naccepting understanding what's realistic\nin this relationship and then\nrecognizing that you can make choices\nfor yourself that by what they did to\nyou they've lost the gift of this\nrelationship of depth with you that that\nneeds to be cultivated in other places\nand some people even say I had to create\nmore of that adult parental space with\nan aunt an uncle a grandparent or even\nother people older friends things like\nthat where I felt like I was getting\nthat even as a therapist I have to say\nit's been part of the transferential\nrelationship where I've had clients\nwho've gone through narcissistic abuse\nand have said you know I I if just one\nof these sessions my parents had done\nany of this what would you do with me my\nparents have done for me as a kid or an\nadolescent it would have changed my life\nand that is heartbreaking to hear\nbecause that's sometimes all it was\ntaken it's one moment because at this\npoint this person you asked this\nquestion you're still not being seen by\nyour parents again grief work radical\nacceptance realistic expectations you\nmay or may not ever decide to forgive\nthem feel no pressure there you decide\nwhat feels right for you\nabsolutely and you know forgiving\ndoesn't mean having a relationship with\nthem another thing you know so I agree\nwith that and then I wanted to throw\nthis question back to Dr Tracy marks um\ncan narcissistic abuse over my childhood\ncause major memory loss in the majority\nof my life\num I wanted to know like from a\npsychiatric standpoint if that's like a\nsymptom of like maybe PTSD from\nnarcissistic abuse so\nyeah so my take on that would be that I\nwould believe or guess that that's\num a dissociative\num defense mechanism you just you just\nkind of forget and we do that we do that\non a minor level with different things\nsomething bad happens like oh what you\nknow tell me the details I don't\nremember you just kind of let yourself\nforget\num but it's not a conscious process so\nit's not something you intentionally\ndecide I'm just not going to remember\nthese bad things it's something your\nmind you just kind of turn things off\nand not and protect you essentially from\nnot remembering these painful events and\nin some ways it ends up being protective\nbecause you're not living in this\ndistress all the time but in other ways\nit's still not\num it's still not the healthiest or\npsychologically Advanced way of managing\nthings because what ends up happening is\nthat you can have these gaps in times of\nthings that were important to remember\nthat you can't\num and for many people it can be\ndistressing that there's a lot of\ndetails that they just can't remember\nabout things they think that they should\nyou know I can't remember my childhood\nand then that's lost You've Lost That\nand to uh Dr Romney's point of\num not have have grieving the loss of of\na relationship with your parents this is\nkind of a similar thing of if you have\nthis big gap in time of you can't\nremember your childhood you either need\nto you can do some work to try and\nrecover those memories and work through\nthe pain of the things that you're\nforgetting or can't remember or you have\nto accept that you have a chunk of your\nlife that you can't account for and\ngrieve the loss of that and and manage\nthat most people vote for trying to\nrecover and work through and accept and\nEtc et cetera yeah I like that you\nmentioned that dissociation and like\ndepersonalization is something that\ncould be like a symptom of the\nnarcissistic abuse because people often\ndon't like make the connection\nso that's good right right I mean\nthere's different ways that we uh cope\nwith things there's healthy coping\nmechanisms or what we call advanced\nlevel I guess coping mechanisms versus\nmore primitive kind\nforgetting or dissociating would be more\nprimitive a more\num Advanced or adaptive way would be you\nknow I think about this and I go and I\ngo running I run off my aggression or I\nyou know go outside and yell to get my\nanger out versus\nfeeling sick to my stomach and having\ntrouble remembering things because I've\ngot all this anger that I can't manage\nand I can't bear to think about it so I\nI there's physical ways that my body\nmanages it definitely thank you for that\nand then um for Dr Romney I think this\nquestion is super interesting it's asked\nby Melancholy Mercury he asked or here\nshe asks why is it called narcissistic\nabuse and not just emotional abuse this\njust sounds like a form of emotional\nabuse that people are tackling or people\nare naming narcissistic\num abuse and what that just pushes the\nstigma more do you agree with that I\ndon't entirely and I'll I want to talk a\nlittle bit about this because I think\nit's this form of ideation that's\nactually pushed a lot of Shame onto\npeople who are experiencing these\nrelationships\nuh and again to avoid making this entire\nthing too pedantic I'm using the term\nnarcissistic abuse but I'll go pedantic\nyou know to answer Melancholy Mercury's\nquestion\num when I'm teaching therapists about\nthis I actually call this thing called\nnarcissistic abuse so I refer to it as\nantagonistic relational stress and the\nreason I do that is that narcissism is a\npersonality style but if we look at how\nthe DSM is moving forward in terms of\nhow they want to consider personality\nand personality disorders and it's all\nvery fine diagnostic points there's a\npersonality style called antagonism in\nmany ways we could use view it as a\ncounterweight to agreeableness and\nantagonism is comprised of things like\nmanipulativeness exploitativeness\nentitlement hostility attention seeking\njust it's impulsivity it's a difficult\nit's a difficult personality style\nhere's where it gets tricky this idea of\nemotional abuse is to me an umbrella\nterm and under this umbrella of\nemotional abuse are many many things\nhanging and which I consider to to be\nnarcissistic abuse becomes a subset of\nthis or antagonistic relational stress\nand I think that the issue here becomes\none of the very unique things it goes\nback to what I was talking about with\ntrauma bonding narcissistic people\nresearch is very clear on this they make\nhigher salaries they are over\nrepresented in leadership they're over\nrepresented and then this is across the\nboard academic leadership corporate\nleadership non-profit Leadership School\nleadership pick a place they're in\ncharge they are they have better success\nat mating and dating so here you have a\nmaladaptive personality style that's\nactually on a lot of social metrics\ndoing quite well by this person even\nthough internally I'm sure they're\nhaving whatever experience I have I'm\nnot saying that everything is Moonlight\nand Roses for them but what comes with\nthat is an interesting form of if you\nwill interpersonal skill and what I mean\nby that is that being able to turn it on\nin public and off in private and what\nthat does to the person who's in one of\nthese relationships is that unlike let's\nsay somebody's someone who's emotionally\nabusive who's an alcoholic okay\nthat alcoholic person may be drunk\naround other people and when they're\ndrunk around other people they're\nthey're off and other people witness it\nso the person who was experiencing this\nabuse doesn't feel as crazy they're like\nwell other people they might feel\nashamed they might feel embarrassed but\nthey don't feel insane\nbut when something only happens behind\nclosed doors it's like seeing a UFO\nthere's no one else to see it everyone's\nlike what's wrong with you I'm like no\nno no there was a UFO and that UFO\nexperience is the experience of a lot of\npeople in these antagonistic\nrelationships because of that there's\nagain it's almost I hate to say an\ninterpersonal skill of I don't want\nother people to think I'm a bad person\nso I'm going to be perfect in front of\nothers and I I'm sure there's many\npeople on this uh who are listening to\nthis who say yep I was in a narcissistic\nrelationship and this person went off on\nme in the car ride on the way home but\nright up until we got into that car\neveryone thought they were the greatest\nperson or once we got home or once\neveryone had left the dinner party or\nonce you know that the guests were away\nfrom the party and that on offness is\nwhat makes this a very unique space this\nis why people will go into Family Court\nthey're completely shredded by these\ndivorces the narcissistic person is very\nwell put together in front of the judge\nand in fact when the other other person\nstarts sobbing and crying and really\nunder the stress of the relationship the\ncourt will sometimes doubt the mental\nFitness of that other person something\nthat has happened repeatedly in these\ncases so while I respect that there are\npeople who take umbrage at this language\nit's one of these personality Styles\nthat's doing real right by a lot of the\nfolks on a lot of on a lot of indicators\nin fact I've worked with clients I've\nworked with plenty of narcissistic\nclients who've said to me don't take\naway my superpower because they know\nthat this is actually kind of giving\nthem the juice and certain I live in LA\nI mean it's like you can imagine this\nworks really good people here and so I\nam I I am the first one again having\ndone a lot of good clinical work with\nnarcissistic clients it ain't easy and I\ncan tell you now they their families are\nsuffering and I was working with a\nnarcissistic person so I can see it all\nbut I don't think that this is all\nemotional abuse shows up the same way\nfrankly people who are depressed can be\nemotionally abusive there's a real\ninvolution and a turning Inward and many\ndepressed people are very irritable\nright but there's a universality to that\nirritability and anyone around that\ndepressed person is kind of in some way\nsimilarly experiencing that that's not\nthe case with narcissism so I'm push\nback on this one that this is not just\nbeing done to be to to be sort of\nthrowing slings and arrows at people of\nthese personality Styles who by the way\ncould also get into therapy and address\nthis instead of Shifting blame onto\nother people which is also very\ncharacteristic of this so I think that\nthere's something very unique about the\non off presentation that leaves people\nuniquely confused in a way that I have\nnot seen in people who are coming out of\nrelationships with folks who are addicts\nor alcoholic people who are in\nrelationships with people with other\nmental health issues and people who may\nhave simply just things like anger\ndysregulation\nit has a different footprint but it\ndoesn't mean that there aren't other\ntypes of emotional abuse so yeah I mean\nthat's kind of yeah great yeah no I\nagree thank you so much and that\nconcludes our audience segment thank you\nguys so much for participating that was\namazing and so I wanted to throw this\nquestion to Dr Tracy marks because I\nthought it was really an insightful\npoint in one of your videos you\nmentioned that there is such thing as a\nhealthy form of narcissism and that\nnarcissism exists on a specter from like\nhealthy to pathological this is a\nquestion really for both of you when\ndoes narcissism cross the line from\nhealthy to unhealthy and how can one\nidentify it in themselves if their\nnarcissism is unhealthy and toxic so\njust to begin with Dr Tracy marks okay\nsure yeah\nyeah in that video that you're referring\nto it was actually prompted by someone\num calling me a narcissist\num in my community\nwhat in my community feed because I was\nholding up a plaque of my reaching a\nhundred thousand subscribers and the\nperson said what a narcissist you know\nyou're just pointing at yourself and et\ncetera et cetera I'm unsubscribing and\nso I was making the point that we all\nneed some degree of self-love which is\nwhat narcissism is and if I had none\nI would be crushed by that comment I\nmean I was still annoyed by it but if I\nwere in a relationship with a person\nlike that and did not have a healthy\nhealthy degree of self-love I would then\ndownplay all of my accomplishments\nbecause oh gosh I don't want to\ndisplease this person\num I'd let I'd they would be able to\nconvince me that\num I'm wrong if I praise myself at all\nyou know etc etc so I was making the\npoint that we that yes narcissism is on\na spectrum we all need some of it\num the ability to appreciate our\naccomplishments strive for things and be\nproud of ourselves\nand where and the lack of that actually\nmakes you more vulnerable to\nnarcissistic abuse because you you know\nyou let the other person shape who you\nare based on their criticism based on\ntheir you know their comments to you Etc\num and then the pathological you know\ngoing more toward the pathological is\nwhere usually because of not having\nenough self-esteem you have this\ninsatiable need to for validation and\nyou seek that validation through others\nusing others at the expense of others\nso on and so forth yeah and you just\nmentioned like a perfect example of\nmisusing the term narcissist I mean you\nwere happy about your accomplishment\nthat doesn't make you a narcissist\nposting pictures that make you a\nnarcissist so thank you for that and Dr\nRomney did you have any like um thoughts\non this I do and so again first of all\nDr Tracy Marx is not narcissistic and so\nbut I'm good here's why the one time\nyou're gonna see is having a healthy\ndifference of opinion right so this is\nwhere I I will push back I\nI'm not a fan of the term healthy\nnarcissism and I'll tell you why because\nI agree with everything we're saying is\nthat there is a this the Spectrum and\nthe Continuum but I think that this\nspectrum has a discontinuity that some\nof what Dr Marx is talking about that we\nall need that a strong sense of self of\nself-worth of accurate self-appraisal of\nidentity of the capacity and sell\naccurate self-appraisal means we know\nwhat we're good at what we're not good\nat we can self-advocate her being proud\nof what is really a big accomplishment\nespecially for a mental health person I\nmean I've always used Dr Mark's Work is\namazing because she was one of the first\npeople especially as a woman of color to\nbe taking this information out there\nthere's a vulnerability to that and I do\nthink that people that feel more they\ngive themselves more permission to\nattack women of color who are putting\nthemselves on these public profiles I've\nseen that and it it disheartens me\nbecause what she did in the first place\nwas courageous so I think what she did\nby holding that plaque up is not only\ngood for her it's good for everyone\nwatching that and for anyone one even\nlooking to that as you know I would\nanytime I see a woman of color\nsucceeding it's like mentorship you know\nso that is a super healthy thing that\nshe did I would then say though what I\nwould say maybe that was a semantic\ndifference I think what she's calling\nhealthy narcissism I'm calling like\nhealthy self-appraisal and self-worth\nthe reason and and this gets tricky and\nif we really were to unfold and unspiral\nthe literature on narcissism when it\ngoes all the way back you know to folks\nlike um like you know Freud was one of\nthe earliest people to write about this\nand other sort of early analytic\ntheorists there's there's always been a\nlittle bit of discontinuity in how do\npeople use this particular term and this\nidea of healthy self-love and unhealthy\nself-love and is it pathological I tend\nto come and again I think this is just a\nsemantic difference I'm not even going\nto sit here and say I'm right it's not\nsaying it's a difference of opinion is\nthat I do view narcissism at its core to\nbe a pathological condition because of\nthat it's I don't know that it's\nself-love because it's such it's all\nabout inaccurate self-appraisal and in\naccurate self-esteem they have overly\ninflated self-esteem where there's\nabsolutely no fundamentals to back it up\nso I think that what everybody needs is\nan accurate sense of who they are what\nthey're about and to feel comfortable to\nbe able to tout you know to talk about\nwho they are but and this is also\nhappening in a context in a World At\nLarge where people again want to shut\ndown people who have less societal power\nso there's a whole different thing\nhappening not to mention that the\ninternet is a cruel sort of Cesspool to\nme that somebody would have felt they\nneed to make that comment obviously so\nmuch more of a common enough Dr Marx got\nup and said yo everyone I got a hundred\nthousand dollars a hundred thousand\nsubscribers and I'm better than you we'd\nbe having a different conversation yeah\nand so I think that the term healthy\nnarcissism gets confusing and because\nsometimes people will say is like well\nmaybe I'm not healthfully narcissistic\nAnd my partner's telling me I'm\nnarcissistic and so if we really kind of\nReserve the word into the more\npathological pathological world because\nit really is about people who are not\nself-aware who are not accurate sort of\nassessors of themselves who do tend to\nbe poorly regulated and tend again it's\nreally about a fragile ego having a\nfragile ego is never going to be healthy\nand so I think that that was more that\nwhat what she's calling healthy\nnarcissism I'm really calling sort of a\num self-advocacy and accurate\nself-appraisal so I think we're talking\nabout exactly the same thing yeah yeah\nI agree with points on both um argument\nI definitely just think that it's a\nsemantics a matter of just like a\ndifferent term so I agree and thank you\nguys so much for being here today this\nwas amazing this was our first ever\nRoundtable and we're hoping to have our\nnext one later this month and I just I\njust love the people here on psych2go\nwho ask all these amazing questions so\nthank you guys and have a wonderful day\neveryone thank you John thank you Dr\nMarx I can't tell you what an honor it\nis to finally I know ever got to meet\nher now we get to meet and doing that I\nknow really really I hope we stay in\ntouch I know I want to I would love to\nstay make a video together\nsuch an admirer of your work and really\ngrateful for all you've done again you\nknow to to be a voice out there for just\npeople who often don't feel their their\ntheir experiences is seen in the mental\nhealth world and how it's depicted so\nagain thank you thank you thank you\nwe're in the same space and I hear just\nas much praise about you and how you\nthink of people's lives I mean it's just\nso\nI'm a fan girl of both of you so thank\nyou so much for being here so much bye\neveryone bye everyone"
