    "transcript": "how does being around a hypocrite make\nyou feel\nfrustrated confused annoyed the\ndefinition of a hypocrite is a person\nwho claims to have moral standards to\nwhich that person's own behavior fails\nto conform so when someone exhibits this\ncontrary Behavior it can lend itself to\nsome strong emotions like feeling\ntricked\nthe fact of the matter is we can't avoid\nHypocrites but we can spot them by being\naware of their actions and their effects\nof it we can distance ourselves\nespecially if they are not interested in\nowning up to their behaviors we can also\nbecome more aware of our own actions\nthat our hypocritical and give ourselves\nsome Grace and learn from it so here are\na few examples on how to spot a\nhypocrite\nthey act differently\ndo you notice how someone can act\nvirtuous and logical but behind closed\ndoors they can become very opposite do\nthey absolutely publicly detest\nsomething that you know they indulge in\nin private\nHypocrites have two faces the public one\nand the truer private one while we all\nadapt and act in certain ways with\ncertain people depending on our\nrelationship Dynamics and are never\nalways the same person a hypocrite's\nbehavior is more infuriating because\nit's not them socially shape-shifting\nthat's the problem\nit's not consistently being who they say\nthey are they would never kick a puppy\nbut you know how poorly they treat their\nown pets in a 2014 study by caviola and\ncolleagues it was concluded that\nhypocritical people not only adopt\nself-interest Behavior but also desire\nto maintain a virtuous moral image\nthey'd rather look good than actually be\ngood\nthe rules don't apply parking in a\nhandicapped spot when you're not\nhandicapped how selfish and rude but if\nI need it or my boss or a certain family\nmember or friend needs to be closer to\nthe supermarket then that's just\nefficiency and totally not the same\na hypocrite knows that rules exist but\nthey strongly believe that they exist\nfor others and now for them or a Chosen\nFew in their select Power Circle\nthe study by valdesolo and desteno in\n2008 revealed that people often have a\nhigher tolerance for violations of moral\nprinciples performed by themselves or\nin-group members they will definitely\nBend break or completely ignore Allah\nprinciple or rule because\nit's different for me\nnot their fault\nmistakes being at fault everybody is and\nhas been in that position no one's\nperfect we're continuous Works in\nprogress and we try to learn to notice\nand accept that about ourselves taking\nresponsibility for our part and things\ngives us a sense of power and pride in\nWho We Are\nHypocrites however choose to denounce\nthose superpowers that are available to\nthem their sense of self is so fragile\nlike an infant they are perpetually the\nvictim because they are never wrong but\nsomeone else always is in a 2015 study\nUniversity of Southern California\nProfessor Jesse KREM and colleagues\ndiscovered that narcissists either by\nnature or as the result of Fame have a\ngreater sense of entitlement and\ntherefore are more likely to excuse\nthemselves for their failings\nso apologizing or owning up to their\nmistakes\nno way it's not their fault for lying\nit's your fault for being so petty and\npointing out their lies\ndo as I say not as I do\nyou are not allowed to drink wine or\nalcohol in my house it's vile and I will\nnot have it proclaim the hypocrite who's\nhiding three liters of box four cousins\nwine in their wardrobe granted it's\ntheir house and their rules but why are\nthey not practicing what they're\npreaching social psychologist Daniel\nBatson and colleagues did a study\nspending five years that concluded the\nnature of moral Behavior to the\nhypocrisy that is people desire to\nappear moral to themselves and others\nwithout practicing moral Behavior\nHypocrites are smug and get a rush of\nself-righteousness when they get on\ntheir high horse to criticize and demean\nothers doing the exact same thing that\nthey're doing which brings us to our\nnext point\nto me and others you may have already\npicked up that Hypocrites suffer from a\nform of cognitive dissonance and\ndeception which means that attitudes and\nbehaviors conflict who they say and\nportray themselves to bees not in\nalignment to how they act with a select\nfew and by themselves an article by\nSusan Krause White born PhD referred to\na study by University of Southern\nCalifornia psychology Professor Jesse\nGraham and colleagues that documented\nthe origins of the dissonance that\nHypocrites have and classified it into\nthree categories while Whitmore states\nthat moral duplicity is what you\nprobably think of when you define\nhypocrisy the other two categories are\nbetter able to explain how this\ndemeaning or judgmental Behavior comes\nabout as a result of the moral double\nstandards people are much fairer with\nthemselves than with others for\ncommitting the same immoral Acts\nthe other category moral weakness refers\nto behavior conflicting with attitudes\nlike believing that everyone should vote\nbut having never voted yourself in\nconclusion while Hypocrites gladly\nengage in duplicitous Behavior they will\nbe quite offended at being called out\nfor or made aware of it when they're\npersonally judged they'll call others\nintolerant even when that's exactly what\nthey were doing if you identified any\nsarcasm and irrational thought processes\nyou're absolutely right Hypocrites\nespecially if you have to live with them\nwill make you feel like you're in a\nnonsensical Loop and your brain will\nfeel muddled because you see that\nthere's no connection to their actions\nand it's unsettling to someone who's\nless hypocritical bonus points if they\nhave malignant narcissistic traits\ndo you identify with any of the above\nmentioned behaviors do you see yourself\nor others in some of these habits\nalthough we can be harsher with\nourselves than others but this video is\nintended to show you some behaviors that\nyou may have not to shame you but to\nmake you more aware of it it's also\nintended to help you identify those who\nare unrepentant and unaware of the\nconsequences of their hypocrisy and to\nlimit your exposure to them and the\nlikelihood of being their unsuspecting\nprey\nwe hope that you found this helpful\npsych2goers if you know of any other\nbehaviors please share them in the\ncomments below until next time and\nremember you matter are you
