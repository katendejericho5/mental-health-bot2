    "transcript": "do you feel empty despite the fact that\nyou do all the things you're supposed to\nso you don't feel this do you feel like\nthere's no reason for you to feel as\nlonely and lost as you do or that\neverything in your life is just\nsuperficial psychologists have long\nsince emphasized the importance of\nhaving close positive relationships in\nour life as well as engaging in\nfulfilling work activities or Hobbies\nwe're passionate about\nbut if you have people in your life a\nmeaningful career and more and still\ndon't feel happy it might be because\nyou're covertly avoiding your own life\nwhat is covert avoidance in her mental\nhealth Blog the crappy childhood fairy\nwellness coach and cptsd resource\nprovider Anna Runkle defines covert\navoidance as an elusive and deep-seated\nform of avoidance common for people with\nadverse childhood experiences such as\nabuse abandonment and emotional neglect\ncovert avoidance isn't obvious to other\npeople and sometimes it might not even\nbe obvious to you that's why those who\nhave it can feel like they're doing\neverything right but still nothing can\ngive them the sense of happiness or\nmeaning they're looking for this is\nbecause in childhood they most likely\nlearn to become avoidant to protect\nthemselves emotionally and\npsychologically but doing so and our\nuncle explains stunts our\npsycho-emotional development and keeps\nus Frozen as fragile children forever\nterrified of rejection judgment and\nabandonment so we grow up and learn to\nbuild our lives around these fears\navoiding anything that might trigger\nthem and that means not forming deep\nemotional attachments with people going\nafter our dream jobs or taking that risk\nwe always wanted to in other words it\nmeans living our lives from the outside\nlooking in and pretending that we're\nfine with it examples of covert\navoidance according to licensed\npsychotherapist Matthew S Boone and Dr\nJennifer a Gregg covert avoidance\nbehaviors give us temporary relief from\nanxiety shame and other uncomfortable\nfeelings we've carried with us since our\nchildhood trauma but it's an unhealthy\nform of coping that can have detrimental\nand unintended consequences\nexamples of covert avoidance include\nfeeling like you're tired all the time\nbut can't make healthier choices like\ngoing to bed earlier or exercising\nregularly\nsaying you're too busy to spend time\nwith people and attend to your\nrelationships when really you're just\nshutting everyone out needing to\nsocially withdraw for long periods of\ntime after making an emotional\nconnection with someone\nfinding an unhealthy escape from\nuncomfortable feelings such as substance\nuse drinking excessive partying and\nother Reckless behaviors chronic\nprocrastination even with things you\nknow you'll enjoy like social Gatherings\nwith friends\nAlways setting long-term goals for\nyourself without ever celebrating your\nprogress thinking that once I have this\nor do that\nthen I'll be happy\nhow to overcome covert avoidance covert\navoidance is really about control\nexplains Boone and Dr Greg we want to\ncontrol as much of our Lives as possible\nto avoid any uncomfortable feelings that\nmay arise from emotional attachments\nbecause our childhood trauma has left us\nfragile but the more we try to avoid it\nthe smaller and smaller Our Lives become\nthe good news is that once we find\nhealthier ways of satisfying our need\nfor control the easier it will be to\novercome our struggles with avoidance\nso how do we accomplish this well\naccording to experts like Boone and Dr\nCraig a good place to start is getting\nto know your patterns of avoidance first\nand then doing something different\nmaking a conscious choice to live life\nmore courageously another alternative\nthat Dr Elizabeth Scott licensed\npsychologist calls active coping\naddresses a problem directly as a means\nto alleviate stress unlike avoidant\ncoping which only temporarily relieves\nit but it eventually worsens this can be\ndone through your behaviors\nactually doing something about the\nproblem or your thoughts reframing your\nperspective and processing your emotions\nabout it so the next time you experience\nsomething stressful Don't just run away\nfrom it try to take control ask yourself\nis this actually a problem and if so\nwhat can I do about it changing your\nbehavior doesn't come quickly or easily\nbut it will be worth it because you\ncan't keep avoiding your life forever\navoidance is a temporary and ineffective\nsolution that will only leave you\nfeeling more vulnerable and alone so\npsychologist Dr Janice Webb and the\nlonger you stay stuck in it the more\npower it will hold over you and your\nlife\nso now is the time to take back control\nand stop doing things out of fear and\ninstead start building a more meaningful\nlife for yourself one small step at a\ntime so what are your thoughts on this\nvideo do you relate to any of the things\nwe've talked about here let us know in\nthe comments below if you struggle with\ncovert avoidance and what you plan to do\nabout it moving forward\ntill next time psych2goers remember you\nmatter"
