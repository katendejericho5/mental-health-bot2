can\naffect your psychological attractiveness\nwhile we've received great feedback on\nour love and attraction videos we\nrecognize that mental health matters too\nand that's why we have something special\nfor all you attraction enthusiasts today\nwe understand that your desire to\nmaintain your Allure and we want to use\nthat passion to shine a light on a\ncrucial aspect of well-being mental\nhealth so here are eight ways stress can\nmake you psychologically less attractive\nirritability ever experienced moments\nwhen even the slightest noise seems like\na banging gong like that time you were\ntrying to focus but the distant sound of\ntraffic felt like it was right in your\nliving room\nDr Robert sapolski a renowned\nneuroendocrinologist at Stanford\nexplains that this is a common reaction\nto chronic stress consistent\nirritability can really take a toll on\nhow attractive you come across to others\nit's like this if people feel they have\nto tread lightly around us they might\nfind it hard to see your great qualities\nwhich can put a dent in your overall\nattractiveness and don't forget your\nmood can rub off on others too\nso if you're often irritable they might\nstart to feel a bit prickly themselves\nafter being with you your irritable mood\nlike when you shouted at your sibling to\nshut off soft music claiming it was too\nloud builds a prickly barrier around you\nthat can push people away making them\nlike your sibling more distant\nremember this isn't your natural state\nit's stress changing your reactions\nnegativity have you ever been to a party\nwhere everyone is laughing enjoying the\nfood and music but you find yourself\nlost in thoughts about the project at\nlie next week you try to mingle and have\nfun but your mind is elsewhere trapped\nin a Vortex of work stress Dr David\nBallard a psychologist and Stress\nManagement expert shares that chronic\nstress can transform even the most\npositive person into a doom longer\npeople often gravitate towards\npositivity and light and surprisingly if\nyou're always negative people around you\nmight unconsciously pick up that Vibe\nmaking it tough for them to see your\ntruly amazing qualities\nit's hard to be the life of the party\nwhen you're weighed down by stress but\nremember it's not you it's the\nstress-induced negativity\nanxiety\never found yourself lost in a sea
