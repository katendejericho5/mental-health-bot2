    "transcript": "okay\nhello psych2go viewers Our Guest for\ntoday's live stream is Jasmine who's\npassionate about spreading Autism\nAwareness Jasmine was featured in a\nvideo for the YouTube channel special\nbooks by special kids where she first\ntold her inspiring story to the world\nyou guys can see that video Linked In\nthe description Jasmine is based in\nPhiladelphia Pennsylvania and here at\npsych2go we're so happy to have her join\nus welcome Jasmine thank you so much for\nbeing here today\nthank you so much for having me\nabsolutely so just for starters can you\ntell us a little bit about yourself and\nyour background\nwell um I'm from Philly I've lived here\nmy entire life I am a wife of 16 years\nand I am a mother to really wonderful\nchildren who are also on the autism\nspectrum I have\num siblings who are also been diagnosed\nand um a lot of autistic people in my\nfamily from\nelderly all the way down to very young\nchildren so um well versed what it's\nlike to live your life surrounded by\npeople on the Spectrum and it's very fun\nso it's generational\num well we're almost 100 short and my\ngrandmother was the first one in the\nfamily that was on the Spectrum and my\nuh cousins and I also have children who\nare on the Spectrum and they're people\non my father's side of the family as\nwell as my husband's family\nokay wow that's super interesting it's\ngood that like you know like your\nhistory right your background so\num when were you diagnosed with autism\nI was diagnosed with autism spectrum\ndisorder um level two with that um\npresented itself with severe OCD\nsymptoms\noh wow and and how old were you again\nsorry\nI actually wasn't diagnosed till I was\n32 years old both of my children were\ndiagnosed first\nso after my youngest was diagnosed when\nshe was two years old and we already saw\nso many similarities between me and the\nchildren especially stories that we\nheard from my mother and software when\nmy little sister was a child as well we\nkind of came to the conclusion that\nafter two children and it was probably a\ngood idea for me to be seen as well\num and did like someone recommend that\ntoo did like the doctors you were seeing\nfor your children recommend that to you\nlike hey maybe you could be on the\nSpectrum too\nyeah the doctor did because they wanted\nafter both of the children were\ndiagnosed they suggested that we do\ngenetic testing and all the genetic\ntesting came back okay and all but they\ndid talk they told me for the first time\nabout the um genetic you know traits\nthey cause autism and they said that you\nknow you have a history of rigid\nbehavior that it might be really good\nfor you to go and see if there's\nsomething going on as well and when my\nmom would bring up how I line the toys\nand there were certain things about\nmyself that were just pretty much well\none like my mother used to have to grind\nup food for me until I was about eight\nyears old due to textural reasons so we\nrealized that there were some things\nthat were just extremely similar to all\nthe younger people in our family\nand how did you react when you first\nheard that diagnosis that you too had\nyou know autism\noh man I was like there's a name for\nthis\nmusic other people like me there's\nstories there are people that understand\nit felt like a weight that had been\ndragging me down in the ocean was\nfinally like lifted and here I am just\nlike bloated I love it so it was like a\nrelief like uh finally\nyes it really was because it had been\nyears of figuring out what what it\nexactly was and I was misdiagnosed over\nand over and over again and I was\ndismissed a lot you know once you're\ngiven one diagnosis it's whatever but\nonce I got the correct diagnosis I was\nable to finally come to peace with what\nhad been going on in my entire life that\nmakes total sense and that is amazing\nand it takes a lot of courage to go in\nand and you know try to get that\ndiagnosis diagnosis and seek treatment\nso I commend you for that that's really\namazing and what were the misdiagnoses\nif I may ask\nI was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder\ntype 2 borderline personality\nborderline personality disorder and I\nwas also misdiagnosed yeah I believe\nthat those were the two big misdiagnoses\nthat I was given those are huge\nmisdiagnoses when were you were you\ndiagnosed with that as like a teenager\nor yes I was diagnosed with it as a\nteenager because what they took as a\nmeltdown was actually they thought that\nit was like you know anger Outburst so\nthen it was let's medicate you for your\nanger let's medicate you for this and it\nwas a roller coaster of taking\n10 12 different medications and I\nfinally was able to come off of that\nterrible cycle of getting sick coming\noff getting sick coming off and I\nhaven't really taken anything since and\nI have been Health haven't been this\nhealthy in my life\nthat makes total sense and that's\namazing and I think that's maybe the\ndanger of diagnosing people too much\nlike early on like when they're\nteenagers your brain isn't even fully\ndeveloped yet and they're telling you\nyou have this this and that so well\nthat's amazing that you shared that with\nus and I just want to know how did\nautism like impact your world of you\ngrowing up or at least like once you\nwere diagnosed\nwell I always knew growing up that I was\ndifferent there was just a barrier\nbetween me and other people and that\nbarrier has existed since I was in\nkindergarten I mean as far as I can\nremember I realized that I was just not\nthe same as other people so I have gone\nthrough my entire life just trying to\nfigure out why why can't I connect with\nin two people in the same way that they\nseem to easily just have this thing\ntogether but once I was diagnosed I was\nable to see that you know this is just a\ndifferent neurotype that's what it is I\nit's not that I'm not connecting with\npeople I have people who love me I have\npeople in my life who love and support\nis that because my neurotype is\ndifferent there was a lot of\nmiscommunication and a lot of missed\nchances and opportunities for me and my\nloved ones to learn to be closer because\nI didn't understand myself completely at\nthat point\nabsolutely that's very powerful indeed\nwhat you just said like if you don't\neven understand what you're going\nthrough how can other people\nright yeah it's tough for people to\nsupport you when they don't know what to\nsupport you in yeah and do you feel like\nSchool helped out like were like\nteachers or like school officials\nhelpful at all like I know that you\nweren't diagnosed while you were in\nschool but do you think they helped or\nwas it like they made the struggle worse\nwell because I was a really well I did\nreally good as\num a school's kid like until I got to\nlike high school where social became\nlike overwhelming a lot of my teachers\njust pushed me through it was like oh\nshe's a nice girl you know she's quiet\nshe's in her own world she's not giving\nus any problems so it was more as though\nI was just pushed along\noh wow and did you ever feel like you\nexperienced bullying either from\nteachers or from students because I mean\nI definitely feel like teachers can\nsometimes bully students but I mean did\nyou ever experience bullying due to this\nor\nunfortunately\num I dealt with bullying a lot I think\nthat my worst bullying was from the ages\nof eight years old till about 16. I\nactually left the high school I was at\ndue to pull in and was transferred it\nhad a really lovely experience for the\nsecond half of my high school my 11th in\num 12th grade years but yes when you're\ndifferent\num it's sometimes it's very easy to just\nbe the when you're the lowest person on\nthe social totem pole when people don't\nknow people know that you're not going\nto fight back it's easy to become the\ntarget of other hurt people\nyeah and could you like I mean if you\ndon't mind could you tell me like what\noccurred when it came to the bullying\nlike what what like people would say to\nyou or what it was like\nwell my nickname growing up and so I was\nabout 15 16 was spaz because obviously\nit was a very nice thing to say and\nexcuse me for saying much better I had\nbeen called that so much in life that I\ndidn't even realize that I was being\nteased but I was called that in school\nand by other people in my neighborhood I\nwas always very in the clouds very into\nthe fantasy world so I was just kind of\nknown as like a bit of a space cadet so\nyes I was bullied a lot I've had my\nhands slammed into school grade doors\nI've been beat up I've had things stolen\nfrom me and I was emotionally abused\nvery badly especially in my high school\nmy middle school my high school years\nhowever as I've become an adult nobody\nhas been more supportive of me than the\npeople that I've gone to Middle School\nmy high school with oh that's amazing\nwow and I mean it's amazing that you\nlike it made you stronger right it\nsounds like it really made you stronger\nlike now you're an advocate and you it\nmakes you the bullying helped you\nunderstand other people better in a way\nI feel that I wouldn't be myself without\nthe experiences that I went through uh\ncan I say that I'm stronger maybe\nwithout such traumatic experiences it\nmight have been you know a little bit\nnicer to not have to but you know what I\nturned it into something I wouldn't\nallow that to keep me down nothing was\ngoing to say I was going to stay at the\nbottom I was going to be who I wanted to\nbe no matter what if you're not going to\nlike me for who I am then I might as\nwell be that person anyhow because you\ncan't be anything I love that yeah you\ncan't please everyone and at the end day\nyou just have to live your truth right\nbut um honestly I don't think that\npeople like you mentioned that they\ncalled you a spaz I don't think that\npeople realize like the impact of their\nwords and how it can like they think\nthat it's just like teasing in a reality\nit is abusive and so I'm sorry you went\nthrough that\nsome form of bullying one way over or\nanother right so what do you feel like\npeople need to understand about how\nautism impacts women\nwell I think that autism impacts women\njust\num at least in the women that I know\nautism is slightly different in the boys\nthan I know because the boys that I know\nof autism tend to act out for\num items to get their needs met where\nthe girls that I have known especially\nthe children in my life now tend to act\nout 40 attention and things they need as\nwomen we're taught from very very tiny\nage where we're giving dials we're\ntaught how to replicate older women so\nit was like I was given a script the\nmask with from a tiny age I was taught\nthis is how you're supposed to be and I\nlearned from a tiny age the way that I\nwas was not the correct way to dig so as\na really small child I learned that I\nhad to pretend and act different in\norder to fulfill society's\num standards of what they had for me\nwow and that must be really difficult\nfeeling like you can't be yourself\nwhat would you say are like the main\ndifferences between Autism and women and\nmen and why is it so like often under\ndiagnosed because it really is I mean\nI think that there's just a lack of\nrepresentation so what would you say are\nthe differences\nI would definitely say that the\ndifferences are is that it's okay with\nthe women that I know of autism are more\nfantasy based\num more into like things that created\nthings not saying that the men aren't\ncreative in all but like the adult men\nthat I know of autism in my life they're\nvery obsessed with like their special\ninterests as far as like trains or\nwrestling or video games and it's like a\none-trick thing where the woman I know\nalso have the special interests that\nthey are in and are just as fervent\nabout it but we're taught to mask it\neven a higher level so we're undiagnosed\non a higher level because the quietness\nand the the timid some nature sometimes\nor even like the fanciful fairy nature\nof some of us it's just seen as\nacceptable female Behavior therefore is\noverlooked\nyeah and that must be really difficult\nand invalidating\nand I mean because it's not people think\nthat like the way it impacts men is the\nsame way it's going to impact women and\nthat's not necessarily the case I mean\nhave you seen some parallels or\nsimilarities at least or\nI've seen I've seen some I definitely\num\nI said they Pete women people have when\ndoctors are diagnosed in autism they at\nthis point you're still diagnosed in\nautism off of middle class upper class\nwhite male children yeah and that is a\nvery small like part of our population\nfor everyone with autism well there's so\nmany people who are falling through the\ncracks and not being diagnosed\nespecially black and brown folks people\non the um people in the lgbtq plus uh\nand we're just it's a lot of people who\ndon't fit standard of what autism is in\nthe DSM are being overlooked it's just a\nlot of us are falling through the\ncrackers\nthe way we diagnose autism needs to be\nreformed because I I love what you said\nthat can you repeat that that\num a lot of doctors diagnose it through\nthe lens of like rich white you know\npeople right or like upper and not rich\nbut you know upper middle class yeah the\npeople who in the 80s and the 90s who\ncould afford to get diagnosed yeah\nbecause unfortunately even in\nPhiladelphia There's places to get\ndiagnosed with autism and it's cost five\nthousand dollars who who right who has\nthat in their pockets just to be able to\ngo and afford and just be like okay\nhere's this let me have my diagnosis so\nthere's only a small portion that\nthey've based all of these criteria off\nof and it's not the whole community and\nI think that often we don't talk about\nthe intersection between Autism and race\nit does make a difference like the way\nautism may affect a person of color is\ncan be different than the way it might\nimpact someone who's Caucasian right\nyeah I know for myself it's um\nAfrican-Americans we do a lot of code\nswitching especially when I'm at a home\nsetting compared to a more formal\nsetting but it's I have to not only code\nswitch between a formal setting and home\nbut now I have to code switch between\nautistic and not autistic between all\nthe communities that I'm in it's\nexhausting\nno I completely understand and so you\nfeel like there should be like reform in\nthe way we diagnose autism\nand a lot of ways oh yes I believe that\nthere needs to be a lot more there's a\nlot of keyless cure autism and I'm so\nglad that we're in acceptance stage\nbecause it's like we're here I'm not a\nchild I'm an adult almost 40 years old\nwith autism and we need to figure out\nhow to make life easier and more\nbearable for the people and adults who\nare already dealing with this throughout\ntheir lives through all stages of their\nlives most of the diagnosis criteria is\nfor children what about the 60 year olds\nlike um who's the guy that plays silence\nin the limbs he was just diagnosed wow\nthat's interesting 80.\nso I mean there's so many people out\nhere that\nexperiences are just being looked over\nmostly because of money\nabsolutely I mean I think that's a whole\nnother conversation but I definitely\nneeds to be reformed in our health care\nSystem especially when it comes to\nmental health when it comes to all of\nthat because so many people are being\nunder diagnosed people are dying people\naren't getting the treatment that they\nneed and it's ruining lives so I\ndefinitely agree with you thank you for\nbringing that up that's amazing\num and I just wanted to know what are\nsome of the stereotypes you've noticed\nabout women with autism or\nmisconceptions\neveryone expects me to be the female\nSheldon or are they expecting me to be\nlike Sheldon's girlfriend and\num I mean if you get me talking about\nhistory I'll never stop I mean I can\ntalk for hours however\num\nthis I feel like the stereotypes are\nalmost just dangerous in a way because\nif you've met one person with autism\nyou've met one person with autism we're\nso vastly different myself I've heard\nstereotypes saying that people of autism\ndon't care about the way that they look\nmyself and my closest friends because my\nboth of my best friends my male and\nfemale best friend are also on the\nSpectrum we care about the way we dress\nwe care about we love those things we\nlove our colorful things my best friend\nwears chicken wing head headbands and\nstuff like that we have our own little\nstyle in our own way of living our lives\nand has and we do care about these\nthings but in our own unique way we look\nfabulous by the way oh thank you we're\ntold that you know\nwe the biggest one I've heard is that\npeople with Autism don't have empathy or\nthat some get into relationships or\nthat we shouldn't marry I've heard\nterrible things things up under my um\nprevious video about Eugenics with\ncomments and people of autism shouldn't\nhave children and my children are\nstraight A students are happy and well\nloved in our community and I think that\nthe misconception that just autistic\npeople in general you know have a lack\nof empathy is extremely dangerous\ndangerous and stigmatizing like I think\nthat we completely need to and we need\nto eliminate every stereotype but that\none's the worst of the worst honestly in\nmy opinion but what do you think\nto me it is as well because it's like\njust because we show it differently\ndoesn't mean we feel it don't feel it\nactually most of the people I know in my\nlife they have autism we feel empathy so\nmuch that it hurts like we can literally\ntake your pain into ourselves as if it's\nour own pain it's just not just being\nempathetic that is we feel you I feel\nthat most of the time a lot of us will\nautism understand neural diver the\nneurodiversity people with of all people\nmore than neurotypicals do\nin some cases the expression of empathy\nmight be different and that's why people\nmisconstrue it as a lack of empathy but\nit's just different it's just\nneurodivergence and it's beautiful and\nwe just have to learn to you know\neducate ourselves on neurodivergence and\non our differences but it's not that\nokay they lack empathy and so I think\nthat's something that you know people\nneed to understand so thank you for\nbringing that up\num and so that brings me to our audience\nsegment where we answer your viewer\nquestions I'm super excited we have so\nmany people in here so let's begin\nJasmine\nstarts\num\nsomeone said I just wanted to share this\nsomeone said preach\nI love that yes\num so\nthank you\nLauren asked why do you so Jasmine why\ndo you think that autism people with\nAutism tend to be bullied more than you\nknow regular people I'm not sure if this\nis true but what do you think so\nanswering the question one more time for\nme Lauren asked why do you think people\nwith Autism tend to be bullied more in\nschool than neurotypicals which I'm not\nsure if this is true but you can answer\nthe question for yourself well I was\nreading the book unmasked in autism by\nDr Devin I can't believe remember Dr\nDevin's last name and Dr Devin was\ntalking about\num how that we um there's something\ninside of people sometime when they meet\nyou and you can they automatically can\ntell you're different some I do truly\nbelieve that\num when you're different\nin a way that is like I don't know how\nto put it it's very hard to um explain\nwhen you're different you're\nautomatically a target for people who\nwant to\nwho want to over somebody somebody has\nto be the other and just being socially\ndifferent is enough right there children\ncan tell I can see with little children\nthem noticing when autistic children are\ndifferent this is something that starts\nfrom a very young age\nyeah and I just wanted to share this\ncomment by Michelle Brown she said I get\nbullied so much for having ADHD and\nbeing autistic well Michelle coming from\nanother Michelle I just want to say stay\nstrong you're amazing and you're\ndeserving of love and respect and I'm\nsorry you're going through that so I\njust wanted to put that out there\nMichelle last year I was bullied as well\nwhen I um did the video I was bullied by\nsomeone I knew in real life who decided\nto make a video and make fun of me I\nunderstand bullying doesn't stop when\nyou're um when you're an adult you know\nand it's just part of the experience of\nbeing autistic sometimes\nyeah absolutely and then let me find\nanother\ncomments\nso someone so let me read this queen\njust asked I was just diagnosed at the\nage of 28 with ADHD and autism do you\nfeel my diagnosis will change my life in\nthe way people look at me\nI have to say that\nthe size Within Myself my diagnosis\nhasn't changed much about my life\neveryone knew I was different it was\nlike what why is Jasmine so bouncy or\nwhy is Jasmine always moving always\ntalking excessively going on about Queen\nElizabeth there were you know or\nsomething like that and when they found\nout everyone in my life they became oh\nokay that's\nthat makes sense and it was hilarious\nbecause here I am afraid like what is\neveryone going to think of me and\neverybody was just like\nokay especially for the people in my\nlife now I am very wary about telling\npeople\noutside of my family such as people who\nI would work with or people that I meet\non the street at first I was however I\ncan't be any less autistic than I can be\nblamed being autistic is as big of my is\nabout as big as my identity as being a\nfemale and as being a black woman is so\nI can't separate myself from that and in\nmy own personal life I choose to wear my\nScarlet a as proud as I can I love that\nyes\nand so then Kenya asked uh Jasmine tips\nfor managing being autistic in the\nworkplace I think this is a great\nquestion\nwell I think it really depends on your\nco-workers because I know for myself\nwhen I was working before I became a\nhome to spend more time with the\nchildren that I was a slow-dorn person\nso basically everyone was slow to warm\nup to me it took a few months for people\nto realize that I wasn't suspicious or\nthat\num\nthat I wasn't like you know I guess my\nface didn't my ex outward expression\ndidn't express how I felt on the inside\nand I know a lot of us suffer from it so\nI realized that sometimes those first\nimpressions are hard to shake off at\njobs I would just say continue to be you\nand if they like you eventually great\nand if they don't they're not your\npaycheck\nabsolutely true you're there to get a\npaycheck so at the end of the day if\nthey don't like you that's their loss\nright that's when would being autistic\nit all comes down to us\nreally feeding ourselves that love that\nwe need because we have to be our own\nbiggest self-validators\nabsolutely self-love is Paramount and at\nthe end day you have to be your own\nAdvocate sometimes unfortunately well\nnot unfortunately but I think it's\nimportant that we are our own Advocates\nright\nyeah\nand then like Lexi asked what made you\nthink in adulthood that you were\nstruggling with autism\nwell good question after I had the\nchildren\num\nI really struggled with the sensory\nissues of the children wanting to touch\nme the loudness of it the things being\nmoved the the schedule was off and I\nwould find that I was stimming a lot so\nthen it became oh no is this mother\ndealing with postpartum psychosis\nbecause I'm stimming I'm doing all these\nthings that they're not understanding\nwhat's going on and when my son was\ndiagnosed and everybody I you know we do\nlike the Tustin when they're 18 months\nand the doctor my we told our family and\nmy father-in-law was like oh I don't\nthink your son has autism he's just very\nreserved like you and then I went and I\njust looked at him my father-in-law I\nstared at him and I was just like no yes\nhe is just like me but no he's autistic\nand then it was like the Spider-Man meme\nme and my son pointed negative work to\neach other because it's like\nhe is\nthat means I am\nand I had to sit on it for a bit\nwow it's interesting like an aha moment\nand then um it's snowy owl asked how can\na narrow narrow typical person best\nsupport someone on the autism spectrum\nthe best way you can support them is\nhaving good communication with them what\nis it that they need what do they need\nfrom you since we're so different the\nperson you know may need to have their\nheadphones on for an hour or two every\nday and sit and be quiet somebody else\nlike my son may need you to sit there\nfor 45 minutes and truthfully just\nlisten to him talk about Minecraft you\nknow it's like not to be dismissed as oh\na second class citizen to be seen as a\nperson with a hundred percent equal\nrights and not as oh you're disabled no\nyou're a person with a different neural\ntype who deserves the same respect and\nlove that's the treat them like you\nwould treat everyone else with that\ndignity it's the best and first thing\nyou can do\nyes I agree 100 everyone deserves\nrespect\noh and then let's see\noh um did you read the comment um she\nsaid her story is so inspiring thank you\nand then let's\nhow can you support so someone let me\nsee who asked this Jax asked how can you\nsupport your children if they're being\nbullied in school due to autism\ntruthfully I've thought about this\nquestion a lot one just in case it\nhappens to my children because\nunfortunately I don't know anyone with\nautism who doesn't have some level of\ntrauma when it comes to bullying the\nbest way to support them would to be to\nask them what options and work with your\nchild on what options are the best\nsometimes just talking to the principal\nsometimes it's going back and back and\nback to that principle my friend has\ntheir child homeschooled because the\nbullying became too much and her child\nis doing well home school even playing\ninstrument you know like there's\ndifferent options now in this new world\nfor children who are being bullied\nbecause the bullying\nThe Bullying stays the 40 year olds I\nknow on the spectrum they still feel it\nwe we feel\namazingly strong feelings and that does\nnot lead\nand then Sarah and I agree with you\nJasmine thank you and then Sarah asked\nso\nshould kids who have autism be separated\nin schools from children who are not\num neurodivergent should they be put in\nseparate classrooms or do you feel like\nthey should all be in the same classroom\nshould you know will that like affect\nthem in any way what do you think I feel\nlike I don't know I want you to answer\nthis\nthat's a good question I believe it's\ncase-to-case basis for instance with my\nchildren both of them have different\ncases with that both thin all day in a\nregular education class and then my son\nin the afternoons goes to social skills\nclass and my daughter does social skills\nthree times a week in the special needs\nclassroom and they also get the support\nschools are for the most part at least\nmy children's School here in\nPhiladelphia has been amazing with\nmaking sure that you're getting the\nexact support that they need as far as\nin and out of the class so it really is\non a case-to-case basis as far as what\nthe child needs but my son has known\nthese children since he was four or five\nyears old and they look out for him so I\nthink that younger children have autism\nand substance already in them\nabsolutely and then\num let's see Michael asked do you think\nthat tick talks about autistic women can\nbe insensitive sometimes and mocking\nit's a good question oh goodness I I\nstay from uh Tik Tok all autism\nTick-Tock because it's a lot of\nmisinformation I I find some of them\num very funny that's all one about\nautistic twerking and I'm like oh my God\nyou think okay from\nfrom I don't know maybe this is just me\nbut I feel like I've seen a lot of tick\ntocks like sexualizing them with autism\nhow do you feel about that because I\nfeel like it's rude or degrading in a\nway what do you think well I think that\nit's good that people are realizing that\nautistic people are sexual beings as\nwell and autism can be sexy I think it's\nperfectly on myself\n[Laughter]\nbut like the ticket tick tocks that oh\nover sexualize\nI'm like I'm not sure about that but I\nget what you're saying like you can be\nsexy no matter neurotypical\nneurodivergent like sexy no matter what\nright I think it's a nice turn from\nconsidering us sexless creatures who\ndon't deserve relationships and being\nmarried a lot of people feel that way so\nI think\nthat there needs to be a good and who's\nnice in the Middle with that you know\nJasmine from personal experience has\nsomeone told you that like you shouldn't\ndate because you have autism because\nthat's if that's the case that person is\nout of their mind but has that happened\nto you\nwell since I've met my husband before I\nwas diagnosed no one has told me that\nbut I have no I know people as of right\nnow who are told that they shouldn't\ndate because of their autism and people\nwho are who are not\nencouraged to live their life to the\nfullest and having relationships friends\ngrowing and developing as a person and\nalways is important even to us\nabsolutely and then mermaid queen asked\nby the way I love that name but anyways\nit was always hard for me to communicate\nwith people because they would correct\nme all the time and I would be\nembarrassed how was it for you when you\nyou know try to communicate with people\num\nI'm uh\nthat's the way to put it I'm so overly\nblunt that I wind up with foot in my\nmouth syndrome a lot because the way I\nwould talk to my best friend is the way\nthat I'm talking to y'all right now it's\nthe same way that I'll talk to someone\nat church or a job interview so I went\nup the foot in my mouth syndrome because\nunlike how neural typicals know how to\nswitch a little bit better for\nsituations you're going to get straight\nup Jasmine every time you talk to me I\nlove that and so that concludes our\naudience segment thank you guys so much\nfor participating it's very much\nappreciated and so my last question for\nyou Jasmine I just want to know how can\nour society at large support women with\nautism better and more effectively\nthey need to ask us there needs to be\nresearched there needs to be studies\nthere needs to be money that's putting\ninto autism not to walk someone find the\nCure because the cases are come going up\nwe need to figure out how to live in\nthis society and make this Society more\nsuccessful for people with Autism a lot\nof us have such special interests and\ntalents that are have been so Dynamic to\nthis world and if these were like you\nknow\noh sorry if these were you know\nharvested and more people who knows how\nmuch autistic people would even be able\nto add to our society but this is not\ngoing to happen until there is more\nasking of us more correct diagnosis and\nmore research so we can really get the\ninformation we need it needs to stop\nneeds the focus needs to change from\nPure to living because we're here yeah\nyou can't cure me like I'm already grown\nno they're you're not trying to be cured\nyou love you know you're accepting of\nwho you are and you love the way you are\nso that's amazing yeah and I wouldn't\nchange a thing\nthat's amazing and I think that just\ngoing off of what you said we need to\nallocate more resources and funding to\nunderfunded communities and communities\nof color like absolutely I definitely\nagree and so thank you so much Jasmine\nfor joining us today it was amazing if\nyou guys missed the live stream you're\nable to watch it you know we record it\nafterwards
