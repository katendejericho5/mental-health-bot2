    "transcript": "does how you look impact your success in\nschool work or how the world treats you\ndo people perceive advantages in life\nsimply because Society deems them\nbeautiful\nthis is what's called pretty privilege\nto find out what psychology says about\npretty privilege keep watching\ntreated differently\nsocial psychologist Michael Hogg and\nGraham Bond say that attractive people\nreceive different treatment and face\ndifferent assumptions\nthose who meet a certain standard of\nbeauty are often the recipients of\nbetter social treatment and advantages\nin life meaning those who don't meet\nthese standards of beauty receive social\ndisadvantages before we talk about what\nthese advantages are let's first explore\nwhat is considered beautiful according\nto psychology\nBeauty standard what is beautiful does\nit lie in the eye of the beholder is it\ndecided by Trends in Media or is there a\nmeasurable way to define what is pretty\naccording to Anthropologist clelland\nFord and psychologist Frank Beach\ncultures have their own Beauty ideals\nmeaning not all cultures view Beauty the\nsame way naturalist and biologist\nCharles Darwin was struck by these\ndifferences finding that different\ncultures have certain preferences for\nskin color body hair size and Beauty\npractices however there are certain\nfeatures that are viewed as attractive\ncross-culturally according to psychology\nfacial Symmetry and an average looking\nface is considered most attractive\nEvolution when someone attractive\ncatches your eye you probably aren't\nthinking they're beautiful because they\nlook average and symmetrical so what do\nthese psychological findings mean and\nwhere do they come from\npsychological studies show that people\nview average looking faces as the most\nattractive when they compare individual\nfaces to computer generated faces\nrepresenting the median or average\nfeatures of a certain population these\ncomputerized faces end up being highly\nsymmetrical forensic neuropsychologist\nJudy ho explains that symmetry generally\nhas a correlation to biological strength\nand healthy genes from an evolutionary\nperspective reproduction is critical to\nensure that an organism's genes don't\ndie which means preferences may be\nadaptations for mate choice because\nattractive traits signal important\naspects of mate quality explain\npsychology Professor Jillian Rhodes the\nidea that beauty comes from an\nevolutionary reproductive need suggests\nthat we are instinctively wired to view\ncertain people as pretty\nprivilege\nthe advantages of being pretty start\nearly children with pretty privilege get\nhigher grades more popularity and are\nobserved as being better adjusted than\ntheir peers\naccording to social psychologist Michael\nHogg and Graham Vaughn in adulthood\nbeautiful adults have more dates more\nCareer Success and are more liked by\ntheir peers another piece of the puzzle\nwhen looking at the advantages of being\npretty is what psychologists call the\nhalo effect\nwhich is if you view someone as having\none good trait you can then associate\nmany other good traits with the original\nso if you view someone as beautiful you\nmight assume they are also talented\nsmart or funny of course that isn't\nalways the case you might assume someone\nis shallow or not as smart because of\ntheir beauty\nfull picture\nbeing pretty houses privileges but it\ndoesn't tell the whole story for example\nthe number one indicator for job success\nis someone's IQ not their appearance and\nstudies show teacher quality is the\nbiggest contributor to academic\nachievement even something like being\npopular isn't always the result of being\npretty psychologist Marina Harris says\nvulnerability and authenticity are what\nbuilds meaningful connections and lead\nto likability and high self-esteem can\ncome from living in alignment with your\nvalues according to psychologist Nick\nwignall\nyou are more\nthere's something comforting about the\nfact that physical Beauty Fades but the\nbeauty of your soul lasts forever real\nbeauty doesn't need makeup because\nthere's so much more than how you look\ndo you notice that when someone makes\nyou laugh inspires you or makes you feel\nsomething you forget what they look like\nor when you kiss someone do you keep\nyour eyes open probably not this is\nbecause real beauty is seen in your\nheart it's important to learn about the\nsubconscious biases we hold so we can\nuntrain these beliefs and in turn treat\nourselves and others better\npoet rupee car shares how you can do\njust that\nwe want to mention that while Ruby is\ntalking to women her words apply to\neveryone\nI want to apologize to all the women I\nhave called beautiful before I've called\nthem intelligent or Brave I'm sorry I\nmade it sound as though something as\nsimple as what you were born with is all\nyou have to be proud of when you have\nbroken mountains with your wit\nfrom now on I will say things like you\nare resilient or you are extraordinary\nnot because I don't think you are\nbeautiful\nbecause I need you to know you are more\nthan that do you think pretty privilege\nexists let us know in the comments below\nand no matter what don't forget that PSY\nthinks you're beautiful just the way you\nare and remember
