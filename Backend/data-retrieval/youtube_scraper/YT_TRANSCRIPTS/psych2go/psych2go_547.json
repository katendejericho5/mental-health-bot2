times on the topic of\nnarcissism but she also has her own\nYouTube channel with over a million\nsubscribers and her own podcast\nnavigating narcissism Dr Romney's work\nhas been featured in Vogue tedx red\ntable talk The Today Show and invested\nan investigation discovery just to name\na few welcome Dr Romney thank you so\nmuch for joining us today thank you so\nmuch Michelle for that wonderful\nintroduction thank you of course and\nyou're super impressive so we had to\nright thank you so can you tell us a\nlittle bit about yourself and your\nbackground so I am a licensed clinical\npsychologist I'll go back a little bit\nfurther I did my undergraduate work at\nthe University of Connecticut where I\ngot a Bachelor of Science in Psychology\nand then I went on got my Master's and\ndoctoral degrees at UCLA and I did my\nclinical training at UCLA as well and my\npostdoctoral training at UCLA and then I\nwent on to become a professor of\npsychology at California State\nUniversity I'm retired from there now\nand I'm a professor emerita there\num I again licensed clinical\npsychologist for all of these years too\nand I am and now currently have a a my\nown company where we focus a lot on on\npsycho education teaching people things\nlike narcissism healing from these kinds\nof relationships that sort of thing\nappear on various forms of media write\nbooks and adjust on my fourth book comes\nout it's my third book on narcissism and\nthis one's specific to Healing from\nthese relationships that comes out in\nFebruary and and I have again a large\nYouTube channel that focuses on\nnarcissism we have a program for people\nwho are healing from narcissistic\nrelationships and that we have that\nevery single month and so in my podcast\nnavigating narcissism which is a\nspectacular guest on it so it's all\nthese different things are meant to\nprovide ways for people to be able to\nget educated by this because it's\nsomething where only in the last 10 or\n15 years have you really been talking\nabout it that's me I'm ma a mom I have a\nbeloved cat and um that's about it and I\nwork all the time yeah awesome that's\namazing so thank you so again thank you\nso much for being here we're super\nexcited so just to start off in simple\nterms what is narcissism and how would\nyou define a narcissist so narcissism's\na personality style I think we could\nargue that it's a maladaptive\npersonality style uh and it is a\npersonality style characterized by\nvariable or limited empathy entitlement\ngrandiosity\negocentricity being incredibly selfish a\nchronic need for validation and\nadmiration a need for control a a\narrogance pretentiousness Envy of other\npeople or the assumption that other\npeople are envying them little regard\nfor other people's needs or wants it's\nsort of a personality style where\nthere's a real drive for sort of power\nand control and dominance over other\npeople\nand all of this stuff I'm talking about\nwhich is interpersonally quite taxing\nit all covers up these are grandiose\ndefenses that cover up a rather strong\ncore insecurity these are people\ninternally who are very insecure who\ncarry a lot of Shame who when that shame\ngets activated will often respond in a\nvery rageful manner so that's what\nnarcissism and what a is and what a\nnarcissistic person looks like sort of\nin Broad Strokes\nso what is narcissistic personality\ndisorder and how is someone diagnosed\nwith it so narcissistic personality\ndisorders where we get into sort of a\ntrickier place right so for any\ndiagnosis to be issued you need a person\nthe person making the diagnosis needs to\nhave been trained in the psychology\nPsychiatry counseling psychiatric\nnursing finish the education gone\nthrough licensure and only in the and\nhave spent enough time with the client\nto be able to make this determination\nright so with all those pieces in place\ncan you make this determination are\nthere a lot of narcissistic people out\nthere wandering the world who probably\nhave NPD but have never been in a\ntherapist office to get diagnosed\nabsolutely so you that's the piece so\nthere's plenty of people out there who\naren't diagnosed probably meat criteria\nbut they never received the formal\ndiagnosis when we give someone a\ndiagnosis not only of narcissistic\npersonality disorder or any personality\ndisorder it is we're looking for the\npervasiveness the stability and the\nconsistency of these personality\npatterns right so we're looking that\nthey're they're pretty constant and that\nthey're either resulting in distress for\nthe person who's narcissistic which\ndoesn't always happen or results in what\nwe call social and to occupational\nimpairment and what that means is that\nit's getting in the way of their lives\nnow what's tricky about narcissism is\nthat for a lot of them they're not\nperceiving a problem in their lives\nother people are but they're not they\nmay actually be coming into therapy if\nthey come into therapy because I don't\nknow the relationship's gone wrong\nthey're in trouble at work they may be\nstruggling with depression irritability\nor something like that they're having\nbut usually it's because something in\ntheir life isn't going the way they want\nor someone's given them an ultimatum we\nalso know that narcissistic personality\ndisorder has a relatively High rate of\nco-occurrence with other clinical\npatterns including ADHD and addiction so\nthe person may very well be in treatment\nfor those other things for addiction for\nADHD if that makes sense and so all of\nthat together means that they might get\nin the door that way but because if they\ncome in with something else depression\nanxiety addiction ADHD the clinician's\nfocus will often be on those things and\nthey might even miss the NPD so I think\nNPD is woefully under diagnosed honestly\nand the other problem to keep it with a\ndiagnosis is a diagnosis really only has\none function and that is to\norganize the symptomatology of the\nclient into a meaningful\ncharacterization you know construct if\nyou will so we can treat it right we\nknow if a person's suppressed there's a\nseries of treatments we use anxiety\nseries of treatments it informs how we\ndo therapy with them in theory right\nwell here we have NPD and while there's\nsome people who are doing some\ninteresting research in this area there\nare no randomized clinical trials and no\nreal evidence of treatment that would\nwork for clients in anything but the\nlongest term therapy with highly\nmotivated clients to me that's not a\nreadily available treatment most people\ncan't afford years of therapy with a\nhighly skilled therapist number one and\nnumber two most aren't motivated to\nchange so it's sort of a it's a it's a\ndisorder where probably other people are\nmore likely to go into treatment because\nof it than the person with NPD I don't\nthe NPD has muddied the waters a lot\nbecause what has happened is we end up\ngetting into these big semantic debates\nof well if they have a diagnosis then\nhow responsible can you hold them for\ntheir behavior and this is\ndiscriminatory it's people of the\ndiagnosis and yada and what we miss\nis the diagnosis the the prevalence\nrates of NPD in the research as as it\nexists sits somewhere between one and\nsix percent but I think we can say with\nrelative confidence that the proportion\nof people out there who have\nnarcissistic symptomatology at a level\nthat it causes problems maybe not only\nfor themselves but other people it's\nprobably closer to 20 you know probably\none in five people are narcissistic\nenough that it's a problem and so we\nhave this this I think that doing away\nwith this NPD designation would be the\nbest thing we ever did I don't it\ndoesn't seem to serve a function and to\nfocus on narcissism as a personality\nstyle that can be a real problem and\nthat can that should be addressed in\ntherapy and may play a role in\nmagnifying other mental health problems\nsure but this idea of NPD and all these\ndebates we have it have about it what it\ndoes is it misses the vote on the bigger\nissue to me which is the harm that this\npattern causes to other people\nabsolutely and do you think that maybe\nit's hard for people who have MPT to\nrecognize that they have MPD because\nmaybe it hurts their ego like because\nthey're like um sort of admitting that\nthey have a personality flaw do you\nthink maybe it hurts their ego because\nit is I don't know just you know to say\nthat oh I have narcissistic personality\ndisorder implies that you have a maybe a\nbad personality right\nI I don't think it's quite that simple I\nthink it's actually that a person who is\nnarcissistic lacks something we call\nself-reflective capacity so what it\nmeans is that there's a there's a a lack\nof willingness or a lack of will or a\nlack of maybe even capacity to reflect\ninwardly on their own motivations on how\ntheir behavior affects other people to\nreally be self-reflective in that way\nit's just this what we call a\nmentalization capacity right that\nappears to be lacking in narcissistic in\npeople with narcissistic personality so\nI do believe there's one camp where they\ndon't want to be characterized as\nnarcissistic because it's just it's a\nstigmatizing thing to be called it's not\nnice yeah so they're gonna say I don't\nthat's not true I'm a great person and\nin fact the research has shown that\npeople who are narcissistic\nsignificantly over\num overestimate their levels of empathy\nthey actually walk around thinking that\nthey are very very empathic people so\nthat's the sort of an in accuracy kind\nof thing out of the gate right so they\ndon't understand how they affect other\npeople they think they're good people so\nif they were to be called narcissistic\nit would often be it would raise a lot\nof rage a lot of denial a lot of blaming\nin fact they probably say you're the\nnarcissistic person for saying that to\nme however there is an interesting\nsubset of folks or a narcissistic are\nlike yeah that's me and you know what\nit's working for me so there's almost an\narrogance to it you know they're they're\nalmost doubling down on the grandiosity\nand arrogance and are saying I still\nthink that the insecurities it's a\ndefense at that point they're still\ndefended against it so instead of\ncrumbling in the face of that\ncharacterization might say yeah so what\nof it you know I'm I'm better than you\nI'm more successful than you so it's\nreally almost like again the narcissism\nmagnifying that kind of experience right\nyeah but it's really what it is do you\nthink it's fair though like I mean if\nif someone's being called like\nnarcissistic I guess it's fair that they\nwould lash out a little bit though right\nmaybe that's not the best way to\napproach it do you think that there's a\nway of approaching\num someone who's narcissistic in a way\nthat's empathetic because maybe if you\ndo like throw that out throw that at\nthem like hey yeah you're narcissistic\nmaybe that might make them defensive do\nyou think that's valid or so one should\nnever call a narcissistic person out\nit's the biggest mistake you could ever\nmake and when I've worked with people on\nthis over the years I said just don't\ncall them out some people say I've\nwatched the videos I've read the books\nit's so clear this is what it is I want\nto tell them I know what they are to\nwhich my point is to what end it's not\ngoing to change them it's more likely to\nagitate them so if anything that\nknowledge that somebody's patterns may\nbe consistent with narcissism is a tool\nfor you to use to say okay I'm gonna\nhave to approach this person in a very\ndifferent way so if a person recognizes\nthat somebody is narcissistic the\npatterns add up they're consistent the\nwhole the whole laundry list I gave you\nthen you really need to start sort of\nsliding into a place of realistic\nexpectations of the limitations of this\nrelationship radical acceptance that\nit's not very likely to change and that\nit is never going to be a deep\nrelationship but it's never going to be\na reciprocal or a mutual relationship\nit's never going to be a respectful\nrelationship it's just not it's going to\nbe superficial it's going to be\nperfunctory it's going to be if you're\nlucky you you can talk about very basic\nthings you and you might think well\nthat's not a relationship no it's not\nyou're right it's really not but these\nmight be people in long-term committed\nrelationships or marriages it could be\nfamily members uh it could be siblings\nit could be parents it could be\nsomeone's adult child these aren't\npeople that anyone feels that the\nrelationship they can easily walk away\nfrom but they keep breaking their hearts\ntrying to make it work I'm here to tell\nyou it's not going to work so once you\nrecognize this is the pattern now it's\ntime to disengage a little bit and see\nwhat this relationship really is about\nabsolutely and so what's the difference\nbetween simply being a rude or selfish\nperson and having narcissistic\npersonality disorder so a rude or\nselfish person I mean really what it\ncomes down to is if a person is\nchronically rude and selfish we would\nwant to dig deeper in to find out do\nthey retain empathy so is this a person\nmaybe who's very abrupt but they're\nactually very tuned in to the people\naround them they're actually even very\nself-reflective like yeah my behavior is\nvery rude I'm gonna go back and\napologize to that person so is there\nsome form of accountability do they take\nresponsibility for their behavior so if\nthe rude person is chronically shifting\nblame onto others I'm going to tell you\nsome you know I'm now saying maybe this\nisn't just a rude and selfish person so\nwe're looking for some of those other\ncore issues we're looking for the\ncapacity for closeness we're looking for\nempathy we're looking for how much this\nperson is able to self-regulate I mean\nrude and selfish are problems you know\nthey're definite problems it's rare it's\nvery rare for a rude and selfish person\nto also be\nunentitled and empathic and\nself-reflective because the sum is\nreflective they wouldn't be rude and\nselfish see what I'm saying so it's like\nrude and selfish by themselves would not\nbe a slam dunk on a narcissistic person\nbut let me tell you if I see pepperoni\nand cheese somewhere I'm guessing I'm\nprobably getting a pizza right and so\nthe difference is the capacity for\nempathy and self-reflection and also\nthat it's not a pattern of selfishness\nand rudeness is that the difference like\nit's some yeah yeah it could be so like\nyou know some people say yeah you know\nwhat this person's only rude and and\nselfish at work that's how they are\nthat's how they do their business and\nthe business has grown however they are\nan absolute sweetheart with their\nemployees they're a devoted parents\nthey're a devoted partner they're good\nto their family that but they're very\nabrupt and rude at work and in fact kind\nof everyone sort of knows that about\nthem but they say that you know I we\ndon't feel hurt by this person because\nwe kind of they're very they don't ever\nblame us they always correct their\nbehavior they're like I just blew my\nstack I know it I know it I love you all\nand you know it's a that's such a rare\nthing right for it to show up like that\nit could it could and in that case I'd\nsay okay I'm seeing something happening\nhere like they're very aware of what\nthey're doing we'd have to account maybe\na little for culture as an Abrupt style\nof communication something that's part\nof a person's culture that might get\nnormalized and in fact the people around\nthis person might say you know what\nwe're not that bothered we're so clear\nthey love us we just sort of know what\nthey mean and so they may very well\noccupy a system where other people are\nexperiencing this person who actually is\nquite present like I said this is why\nit's not as simple as I met someone and\nthey're rude they're narcissistic maybe\nmaybe not we'd have to dig deeper it's\nunusual the thing I'm describing is\nunusual but it could happen so as a\nnarcissist like a narcissist in every\narea of their life at work with their\nfamily their friends yeah because nor\nbecause narcissism is a personality\nstyle right you have a personality I\nhave a person narcissistic people aren't\nthe only people with personality every\nhuman being has a personality right and\nso when people are so befuddled they're\nlike what do you mean a narcissist can't\nchange that doesn't make sense I say\nokay let me ask you about your\npersonality I don't know yours I know\nmine so I'll give you the example I'm a\nvery agreeable person I'm a very\nconscientious person and I'm a very\nintroverted person what does that mean\nit means that tomorrow if somebody said\nokay Romney we need you to change we\nneed you to become really unempathic we\nneed you to be rude we need you to be\nselfish we need you to stop caring about\neveryone around you we need you to post\nlike crazy on Instagram and post like\ninappropriate pictures of yourself to\nget attention we need you to do all of\nthat by next week and be the life of the\nparty and leave all your stuff in a mess\nand not do your deadlines I've got I\ncan't do I can't what do you I can't I\ncan't do those things those those things\nare me that's who I am now some of them\nmight say well Romney that's a silly\nexample because those are all good\nthings maybe maybe they're good things I\nthink a narcissist person will say you\nwaste too much time caring about other\npeople right so I'm saying that those\nthings that would be changing my\npersonality I don't think I could do\nthem and if I did I would be extremely\nuncomfortable so why would a\nnarcissistic person be able to change I\ncan't change my personality why would\nthey change theirs so you don't think\nthey have that you don't think a\nnarcissist could change I know I that\nvery little very the kind of change we\ncould see is Maybe\nagain the north there might be bells and\nwhistles around the narcissism so for\nexample a narcissistic person may also\nhave ADHD they may also be living with\naddiction\nthey may also have post trauma they may\nalso have depression those things are\nall eminently treatable and manageable\nright so those things might get treated\nand it might smooth out the roughness of\nthe edges for example a person's no\nlonger intoxicated that could bring down\ntheir impulsivity but the core the\nnarcissism piece the lack of empathy the\nentitlement the grandiosity the\nselfishness that's not going anywhere\nright clean up the out of the fringes\nbut you still have that core I have\nworked with a lot of narcissistic\nclients in my practice a lot and some of\nthem I've had the fascinating experience\nof working with them and then having a\nbreak from seeing them for maybe three\nor four years and I'll see them for a\nfew sessions and when I tell you almost\nthey've made so little movement and I\ncontrast this to clients who are not\nnarcissistic and we have made huge leaps\nhuge leaps in our work right and so it's\nthe it's the rigidity narcissistic\npersonality is a very rigid personality\nstyle that's why it's considered less\nhealthy agreeable personality styles are\nvery are very flexible more flexibility\nmore mental health the two go together\nso the that lack of flexibility means a\nlack of change right they're not that\nbecause for a narcissistic person under\nstress or conditions of disappointment\nthey will always slide right back so\nthey might be able to put on good\nbehavior for a minute they might go to\ntherapy they might learn a better way to\nbe with people they may learn all of\nthat but when anything on the outside is\npressing them they feel a sense of Shame\ncoming up they don't feel adequate any\nof those things they'll snap right too\nand they'll be lashing out like they\nalways did so it's a very resistant\npersonality style to change like most\npersonality styles are relatively\nresistant to change\nright that is true it is hard to just\nlike change your personality I mean it's\nprobably impossible but if so if okay so\nif parents notice that their kids I\nreally think this is an interesting\num point if if um parents notice that\ntheir kid is kind of narcissistic if\nsomeone's young could you catch it early\nand maybe save that person from becoming\na full-blown narcissist if it's caught\nearly so the tricky bit is that we don't\nreally talk about personality and\nconcrete terms in children okay so\npersonality is developing from when a\nchild from young childhood into\nadulthood in fact I would say\npersonality does not really fully gel\nuntil a person is in their mid-20s\nbecause of how much cognitive\ndevelopment is still going on so all all\nadolescents are narcissistic they're\nvery selfish they're very self-serving\nthey're very dysregulated they're very\nimpulsive they're not really\nnarcissistic though they're going their\nnervous systems going through the leaps\nand changes that they're going through\nI've had many parents say to me I am\nconvinced by 17 year old is narcissistic\nI'm like first of all as and I say this\nas the parent of adolescents they're a\nhandful I mean any phase of life I would\na client population I think wouldn't\nwork with is probably adolescence\nbecause they're tough the people who\nwork with them well though realize like\nthere's so much promise there's just\nit's a I could work with infants I don't\nthink I could work with adolescents but\nThe Adolescents though are going through\nwe have to show them Grace because\nthey're going through so much right\ntheir bodies are adults their bodies are\nacting like adults but their brains are\nvery much they're still a childlike\nelement to it while especially around\nthe frontal lobes and especially for\nboys and and who ultimately you know men\nis that that that regulatory piece is\nslowly setting in which is why a 17 year\nold boy wore a skateboard down a really\nsteep hill and you're like what are you\nthinking they're not they're thinking\nwith the 17 year old boy's brain right\nwhich is why they can be so vexing\nbut so I don't think it's I don't think\nit's right to ever call an adolescent\nnarcissistic I think we can call them\nmore impulsive we can call them\ndysregulated maybe even oppositional\nthese various pieces that form the\nMosaic of narcissism but I think that\nwhole idea that it ties into a full\nstyle I always tell even parents I say\nall bets are off till they're 25. I'll\nagain I can tell you this\nwhen you and let's even be generous and\nsay 30. when a person is narcissistic at\n30 and we look back at their 15 16 year\nold selves they were definitely\nnarcissistic then\nbut\nwhen a person is when we look at that 15\nor 16 year old who is really impulsive\nand oppositional and difficult we really\ncan't predict what they're going to be\nlike at 30. so we can go backwards but\nwe can't go forwards and so but here's\nthe thing is that we know and what the\nresearch is suggesting is that where\nnarcissism comes from it's a complicated\nconversation right it's a mix of\ntemperament which is our sort of inborn\naspect of our personality it's like\nprobably a genetic piece it's people\nthink there's certain elements of\npersonality impulsivity is a great\nexample where there seems to be a\nheritable component some temperaments\nare Lovelier than others especially in\nsmall children some kids are easy going\nflexible they soothe easily they're well\nregulated they're just easy that's the\nonly word I can use is easy I'm not even\ngoing to say good as much as I'm going\nto say easy and then there are kids who\nhave difficult temperaments attention\nseeking difficult to soothe\num often quite behaviorally agitated\num they're a handful and because they're\nmore difficult those difficult kids get\na little bit more pushback from their\nenvironment they're harder to parent\nthey're harder to teach they may even be\nmore likely to be abused if there is\nabuse in the environment I don't think\nthat a healthy person parent would abuse\na child like if they were not prone to\nabuse but in a environment where there\nis that historical like the parent has a\nhistory of abuse they're going to be\nmore likely to lash out at that kid who\nwas more quote unquote difficult well\nthose difficult temperamented kids if\nthey are in an invalidating early\nenvironment that could be trauma it\ncould be chaos it could be other adverse\nchildhood experiences there could be no\nlack of limits it could be no one\nteaching them how to regulate those are\nthe kids who tend to go on to become\nnarcissistic right but there's another\nsubgroup and that other subgroup of kids\nare kids for lack of a better word who\nare spoiled they are never told no they\nare never told to regulate and they're\ntold and this is interesting research by\nthis guy named Eddie brummelman who said\nwho suggests that they're told that\nthey're special and more special than\nany other kid\nkids are special but they're not more\nspecial than anyone else right parents\nwho communicate you're more special\nyou're more deserving you're better that\nthat kind of communication can also set\na kid up to be narcissistic and if you\nthrow in there that the parents aren't\nemotionally available then you're really\npushing the accelerator now do kids grow\nup in adverse environments and not\nbecome narcissistic all the time in fact\nyeah that's more likely but this this\ncombined stew is what gets people there\nso when people say hey my kid is being a\nhandful and I rep I've consulted with\nhim I was like even at five six seven\nand their kid really is disruptive and\nchallenging for teachers and challenging\nfor peers I will listen to that parent\nseriously I said no your child's not a\nnarcissistic person but you've got your\nyou've got your work cut out for you\nbecause it's going to be about finding\nenvironments which will sort of meet\nthis child where they're at because\nthese are often kids where teachers\ndon't like them they're considered them\ntoo disruptive and so the kid gets very\npathology in school at a very early age\nwhich can become a downward slope so for\nparents dealing with these sort of\nhandful kids is really about whatever\nthat means it might be sport it might be\ndifferent kinds of activities it might\nbe working with the school and setting\nup an individualized education plan that\nmeets that child where they're at so the\nkid isn't always hearing this quiet\nmessage difficult kid difficult kid\ndifficult kid but rather there is a\nneurodivergence here and neurodivergence\ncan also mean that not all kids are the\nsame kind of Learners they're not always\ngoing to behave the same way but these\nkids often experience a lot of\ninvalidation so it's complicated so\nmaybe well that's true and so maybe our\nsociety should like approach it\ndifferently yeah 100 yeah like\nabsolutely and um so speaking on like\nchildren this is like perfect segue how\ndoes someone develop narcissistic\npersonality disorder essentially what\nmakes a narcissist so everything I just\nsaid you know it's that idea of\ntemperament coming up against early\nenvironment coming up again it could be\nadverse childhood experiences it could\nbe early chaos it could be early\ninvalidation it could be frank physical\nsexual abuse it could be witnessing\nviolence all of these things can make a\nchild more prone in fact there's a\nthere's a one group of folks that say\nnarcissism is a post-traumatic State I\ndon't disagree with that but I don't\nthink that's all it is I think in a\nsubset of folks narcissism is a\npost-traumatic state that it is a um it\ncould very well come out of again all of\nthese early adversities however there's\nthat other group that I just told you\nabout which are the kids who are really\ngrow grow up in these very over sort of\nmaterially overindulged being told\nthey're special but are often not\nemotionally\num where they're at they're not attuned\nto they're not me you know they're\nthey're sort of not they're very um\nperformative they do good in school be a\ngreat soccer player be at this look like\nthis you know it could be that that\nthey'll really learned to be valued on\nsuperficial characteristics and that\nalso can spin a person into narcissism\nnarcissistic parents have a higher\nprobability of raising a narcissistic\nkid however they have a much higher\nprobability of raising very anxious kids\nso by and large people of narcissistic\nparents don't again none of these are\nabsolutes adversity doesn't always lead\nto narcissism overindulgence doesn't\nalways lead to narcissism having a\nnarcissistic parent doesn't always lead\nto narcissism so as with everything in\nPsychology everybody wants these simple\ncut and dried answers it's all about\nprobabilities that's what this is about\nand so when people are trying to\ndeconstruct this story how did this\nperson become like this every\nnarcissistic line I've ever worked with\nas I got to know their history it was\nclear as a day how they came to where\nthey were right and there were things\nthat could have been done differently in\nchildhood that probably would have\nyielded a different outcome but there\nare just there are many many more people\nwho are raised away these narcissistic\npeople were and didn't turn out\nnarcissistic so it's not like oh it's a\nvariety of Developmental conditions that\nmeet up against temperament that will\nthen yield all of this is some argument\nthat early impulsivity that then becomes\nyou know adolescent impulsivity also\nsets people up potentially for for\nnarcissism but it's it's a it's a very\nvery complex mix of stuff that gets\npeople into that point so since\nnarcissists are usually created through\nlike what you mentioned like either\ntrauma or like um\nparents were emotionally unavailable do\nyou think that we have to view\nnarcissism to some extent with like a\nsense of empathy like okay narcissists\nsuffer too I think we need to view\neveryone with a sense of empathy well of\ncourse the narcissistic people right we\nneed to view everyone with that and\nregardless of what anyone's going to\nwhether they're living with mental\nhealth issues addiction narcissism it's\njust it's harder to view narcissists\nwith a sense of empathy I guess that's\nwhy I bring it up it's harder to look at\nsomeone who's so narcissistic and think\nwhat if you know they had a traumatic\nchildhood what if their mom or dad is\nnarcissistic which could often be the\ncase I think that's why so is that maybe\nshould we change the way we view\nnarcissists to some degree change it\nfrom what to what like to maybe have\nmaybe approach it with more empathy like\nokay this is someone who maybe it's not\nabout me they have their own issues just\nthis one okay so this is a very delicate\nkind of a conversation because here's\nthe thing most people who survive these\nrelationships have regarded the\nnarcissistic person with an amount of\nempathy that surpasses anything that you\ncould ever imagine in human history\nthey've made excuses they've Justified\neverything they can they're like they\ndidn't mean it they had a tough\nchildhood I'm going to give them a\nsecond chance I'm going to be forgiving\nI know this is hard for them\nyeah they will do that for years years\nand years and years the therapist let me\nmeet them where they're at let me show\nthem images\nso how much is enough\nno you're right I mean um\nI guess I was I was talking about like\nmaybe our societal approach to viewing\nnarcissism but of course like victims of\nnarcissistic abuse they've you they're\nusually extremely empathetic people\nthey're usually empaths and they've\ngiven their all right so now I see what\nyou're saying for sure but okay so let's\nsay Society yeah narcissistic people\nmake more money narcissistic people are\nmore successful in dating in relation\nand getting into new relationships\nnarcissistic relation narcissistic\npeople are more likely to be\noverrepresented in leadership\nwould one not argue that they're doing\njust fine where Society is concerned\nyeah you're right that's the data in our\nstatistics right so my point is this I I\nunderstand where you're going with the\nquestion which is we're in a phase where\nwe're now talking about this and it's an\nuncomfortable conversation I get shut\ndown all the time I'm told all the time\nyou're a therapist you should know\nbetter how dare you're so unempathic you\nshould have your license taken away from\nyou for being so cruel to narcissistic\npeople and I'm like okay\nthat's interesting so what do I tell a\nperson who's been in one of these\nrelationships for 30 years 40 years 50\nyears they've been Betrayed at every\nturn in the road they have been their\ntrust has been tested they have been\nverbally and emotionally abused so what\ndo I tell them yes sorry I can't help\nyou because we gotta be empathic to\neveryone like where does it end you see\nwhat I'm saying so I think that I what I\nattempt to do in my content is to give a\nvery holistic look at this I'm like\nlisten I'm telling you their path to\nthis moment may not have been an easy\none the radical acceptance piece is that\nbecause I think what people do they get\ncaught up in this Loop I'm going to help\nthem I'm going to change them I believe\nin them well if there's if this is their\nhistory then can't we fix this like I\nsaid no more than you can change your\npersonality but what I tell folks is you\ncan be empathic from a distance you\ndon't have to keep enduring the\ninvalidation the manipulation\ngaslighting the verbal abuse the\nemotional abuse that is not love\nenduring that stuff isn't love it is\nactually quite compassionate to take a\nstep back and say I I see I I I see I\nsee it all I understand\nI can't stand here and endure this any\nlonger now the narcissistic person will\nlash out at the person whoever dares at\nthat boundary and the other people in\ntheir sphere will probably do the same\nsay well they have been through a lot is\nit really nice for you to leave them or\ncouldn't you not forgiving that's my\nfavorite people always tell people you\nhave to be forgiving and there's\nactually good research out there five\nstudies I can think of on top of my head\nthat have all said that when a person\nforgives somebody who keeps betraying\nthem it actually results in drops in\nwell-being for the person doing the\nforgiving so how do we guide a person\nsay oh forgive them they're going to do\nthis to you again but forgive them so\nyeah it's a very complex conversation so\nI think that what's happened is this is\nwhy it's getting risky in places like\nTick Tock and social media where people\nare posting videos and saying my\nboyfriend is a narcissistic monster and\nwhat boyfriend did was he had a one\nnight stand now nobody wants her\nboyfriend to have a one-night standard\nright it doesn't feel good I don't know\nthat he's narcissistic he may be yeah\nbut we're gonna need a minute to figure\nthat out but when we keep making these\nequations that just because someone's\nUnfaithful they're narcissistic just\nbecause somebody yells once they're\nnarcissistic you know just because\nI don't know somebody doesn't split the\ncheck with you the right way they're\nnarcissistic that doesn't hold that is\ndangerous absolutely that's what I was\ngoing to ask like do you think the term\nis being thrown around more than ever\nthese days it's just like\nit's just like everyone's narcissistic\nand that's really troubling\nright and everybody can't be right I\nmean so I think that's not positive\nselfishness is not narcissism posting on\nInstagram is not narcissism now if a\nperson posts multiple pictures of\nthemselves waiting for validation are\nvery irritable when they don't they're\nalso unempathic and entitled and\ngrandiose I mean again you show me\nsomeone who's posting lots and lots of\nimages to to Instagram and that's a\nsingular focus and they can't get past\nthat and they need the validation they\nget irritable when they don't I might be\nwilling to take the bat but I'm not sure\nthat I'm gonna I'm gonna put push all my\nchips to the middle of the table I mean\nit's these there's soft signs that tell\nus like there's something here that's\nunhealthy and I think that that's the\nbig piece of this conversation of people\nare getting get lost like tell me tell\nme tell me is my partner narcissistic\nand I'm like why is that term important\nI'll say tell me what's happening in\nthis relationship and they'll give me a\nlaundry list of terrible things that are\nhappening in the relationship to which\nI'll say that's just unhealthy and but I\nneed to know that their narcissistic as\nthough if they know that then they'd\nfeel more empowered to leave but a\nthousand unhealthy things isn't enough\nso I think people get stuck on the label\nversus an unhealthy relationship is an\nunhealthy relationship and Something's\nGonna have to give yeah and I love\nsomething that you mentioned that you\ncan have empathy from a distance like no\none should ever deal with narcissistic\nabuse if you feel like you're dating\nsomeone who's abusive a narcissist you\nshould get out of that like you know you\nhave to take care of yourself right you\ncan't just if you can because not\neveryone can like if early faces of\ndating I totally agree with you then you\ncan get out the challenge becomes if a\nperson's in a relationship for longer\nterm five years they have kids they have\nshared finances there's cultural or\nreligious pressures there are other\nFinancial pressures that they themselves\nare sort of prone to trauma bonded\npatterns where they feel as though they\nfeel really stuck in a loop if I want to\nhelp them I want to save them I have\nhope for this and it very much might be\nreplaying a cycle from childhood with a\nnarcissistic parent all of those things\ncan B can keep a person stuck and make\nit very hard for them to get out of the\nrelationship\nthank you and then this is a very\nimportant one what are some red flags\nthat someone in your life could be a\nnarcissist what are some signs of well\njust starting with that yeah what are\nsome signs that someone in your life\ncould be a narcissist so there are there\nare a lot you know there are multiple\nsigns I mean I think that you would be\nlooking for you're not going to be able\nto tell it early on one thing I tell\npeople you almost need to give it a year\nmuch before a year it's hard to this is\nso I think the whole wish that five red\nflags that's my favorite tick tocks oh\nI've read facts it's all a narcissist on\nthe first thing I'm like good luck with\nthat and so it's not going to work\nbecause it you initially narcissistic\nfolks have a unique capacity to be very\nCharming charismatic engaging I mean\nit's a little different if you're\ntalking about a vulnerable narcissistic\nor malignant narcissistic person but by\nand large many narcissistic people are\nvery very\num are very charismatic and Charming\nright and so as a result what that means\nis people are not even gonna whatever\ntiny little red flags May pop up people\nare very quickly going to justify them\nlike oh they were late big deal people\nare late all the time they have a busy\njob they have an important job so even\nsome little things like maybe your time\nbeing disrespected and someone being\nchronically late or a um a person\ninterrupting you and talking over you or\na person on their phone when when they\nshould really be paying attention to you\nand if you bring it up they get angry at\nyou a person who gets very very who's\nvery reactive if you make even a mild\ncomment like might be your fifth date\nand say oh my gosh I love that shirt you\nwore it on our first date what are you\ntrying to say that I don't have a lot of\nclothes like what's that digging I'm\nlike oh my gosh I actually really like\ntheir shirt so you look for that kind of\nreactivity you watch how a person drives\nthe research shows that narcissistic\npeople tend to drive in a more erratic\ndangerous high speed riding up on other\npeople's bumpers cursing and the finger\nand all that that if you if you're\nuncomfortable through driving pay\nattention to that watch how they treat\nother people are they entitled with a\nserver in a restaurant or a clerk in a\nshop or a person oh yeah or are they\nwarm and are they patient do they do\nthey throw a tantrum when things don't\ngo their way maybe you get to the\nrestaurant they've lost the reservation\nand while a person certainly could be\nfrustrated do they really lash out at\npeople pay attention to that the signs\nare there but they're often if you have\none difficult bad sign against 10 things\nyou really like it's really hard to pull\nthat stuff out\nin a lot of ways is like is it like a\nlack of emotional intelligence to some\ndegree because you said that like\nthey get like defensive if you bring\nsomething up like make an innocuous\ncomment is narcissism to some degree a\nlack of emotional intelligence not\nnecessarily because they can be\nincredibly emotionally intelligent when\nthey need or want something so if you've\never watched a narcissistic person\nworking a conversation when they need\nsomething they're talking to someone\nthey know is very important they talk to\nsomeone who could be a really important\nbusiness Ally they're talking to someone\nthey need to sort of want to seduce\nthey're talking to someone they want to\nwin over they seem like the most\nemotionally intelligent person you've\never met in your life\nwow so it's like pay attention to how\nthey treat someone who they perceive as\nbeing you know not useful to them and\nthen pay attention to how they treat\nsomeone in power like the scene you know\nthings like that absolutely well that's\nvery that's right very interesting and\nso that brings me to our audience\nsegment where we answer your viewer\nquestions this is your chance to get\nyour questions answered by the amazing\nDr Romney so let's begin\nlet's start just gonna look through the\ngroup chat\nso we have a lot of people in here\nokay perfect this is a really good\nquestion\nso\nI don't want to Butch your name but Raya\nasked how can someone who was\nemotionally abused by a narcissist\nco-parent with them such an important\nquestion so it's either what I'm saying\nthese are the subtleties right is that\nwhen you're parenting it's probably one\nof the most emotionally demanding tasks\nwhere you have to be incredibly present\nyou know where we're even dealing with\nour own legacy issues from childhood\nwhen we're parenting it's a very complex\nthing to do and so then when somebody\nyou're having to raise children\nalongside somebody who's continuing to\nGaslight invalidate manipulate and\nbasically punish you it can feel like an\nimpossible task it's a couple of things\nnumber one anyone co-parenting with a\nnarcissistic person needs support\nideally other people going through this\nfind those support communities because\nyou no one else will get this if\nsomebody if you're talking to somebody\nwho's co-parenting they may be divorced\nor split up and but they're co-parenting\nwith someone who's actually kind of\nhealthy or not at least not narcissistic\nor not emotionally abusive it's an\nentirely different game and they're\ngoing to look at you like you have two\nheads but talking to people going\nthrough it makes a very big difference\nso you need support so you don't feel\nlike you're losing your mind number two\nhave realistic expectations that you are\ngoing to have times when at the\nnarcissistic person at the last minute\nis going to decide I can't take the kids\nor I won't take the kids we'll shift\nplans on you you have to have realistic\nexpectations for that otherwise you're\ngoing to feel completely sort of like\nyou you meant you missed the whole thing\nyou just felt like somebody just kind of\nsnuck up on you the third thing is that\nyou is a it's a technique developed by\nTina swither who's a major advocate in\nthis space and she calls it yellow\nrocking lots of people talk about gray\nrocking being flat and non-emotional\nnon-responsive yellow rocking is\ndifferent it's where you don't take the\nbait but you don't get deep in with them\nyou say you're you're like great hi yeah\nthank you sounds good but you're not\ngetting into it with them you don't get\ninto it with them and if you say it's\ntoo hard I can't help myself taking the\nbait get into therapy because that's a\nplace to practice that skill that's why\nthe support becomes so important but to\nunderstand it is hard the big thing you\nwant to do model empathy for your kids\nshow them what healthy looks like be\nthat healthy place for them be that soft\nplace to land you also have the tougher\nrole of sometimes having to be the more\ntough parent the homework all that other\nstuff the other usually the narcissistic\nor emotionally abusive co-parent gets to\nbe inconsistent all of that but your\nkids need that one soft safe place to\nland so like lead by example lead by\nexample but particularly when it comes\nto empathy and emotional regulation and\nfinally never ever to speak badly about\nthat other parent as tempting as it may\nbe as much as you were like I need them\nto know the truth they'll get to the\ntruth it just can't come from you it is\nabsolutely crucial when you're\nco-parenting with an emotionally abusive\nperson you keep that under your hat you\ncould talk to someone else you talk to a\ntherapist anyone else do not talk to\nyour kids about but let them come to\nthat conclusion when they're older they\nmay they may not usually they do\nsometimes they don't which is\nheartbreaking but it can't come from you\nyeah absolutely I agree with that and\nthen Jess Michelle asked how can you\nknow the difference between a narcissist\nand a psychopath in a romantic\nrelationship and how do you know if\nsomeone can potentially get dangerous so\nthere's sort of two different questions\nhere so narcissism and psychopathy are\nvery close but also quite different\nnarcissism is that whole the whole\nentitlement grandiosity and security\nthing I'm talking about the difference\nis though with the the and the\nnarcissist can feel shame and their\nanger comes from that the psychopathic\nperson is a different game they're very\ncold callous calculating but they often\ndon't have any remorse so they'll do bad\nthings and not feel bad believe it or\nnot a narcissistic person does feel bad\nwhen they do bad things but they're so\noverwhelmed by the shame of doing that\nbad thing because the narcissist has to\nview themselves as almost perfect that\nthey'll blame other people for for that\nbut they do feel bad believe they really\ndo if Psychopathic person does not feel\nbad so it could be more menacing a\npsychopathic person many people will say\nit truly feels like Jekyll Hyde like\nthey'll say I thought I knew this person\nthen I learned they did all these\nterrible things or they'd been married\nfour times before or they're still\nmarried or they have kids I don't know\nabout or they had that they were in\nprison and I didn't know it like a\npsychopathic person is very very skilled\nat lying because their nervous systems\nare are different and so they can lie\nmore smoothly they can um again they for\nthem a relationship is completely and\nonly serves the purpose of power profit\nor pleasure when they get into a close\nrelationship is to get something it\ncould legitimize them it could be\nwhatever purpose of marriage would it\nwould be a house to live in a car to\ndrive it is definitely manipulative and\ncold and they will ice you when they\nhave no more need for you and move on or\nwhatever but they will leave you in\nTerror while they're in it narcissistic\nperson isn't quite that calculating not\nat all they they may actually really\nthey may actually genuinely like you\nYou're Still Supply to them but that's\nnot as calculated now in terms of danger\none of the things you want to pay\nattention to and this is when we even\ntalk about malignant narcissism what's\nin these relationships early on what\nyou're going to start seeing is control\nshows up early and that control can look\nlike isolation it can look like somebody\ntalking badly about the people around\nyou it can be a person kind of grousing\nabout why do you need to work late who's\nthat guy you work with why does that\nperson text you lots of show me your\nphone who's this person liking your\npictures it's a lot of that stuff and\ninitially for a lot of folks that might\nfeel like attention like oh they really\ncare or they're jealous because they're\ninto me they may want to spend all their\ntime with you how come you need to go\nout with your friends how communities\nyour family aren't you into me don't you\nwant to spend time with me so they'll\nwant to spend time but it's it's from a\nplace of control yeah and jealousy\nyou'll see also I tell people when\nyou're in a new relationship never ever\never accept a phone or other device as a\ngift ever not an iPad not a phone and\nI'll tell you why if they're putting a\nservice contract on it you just gave\nthem the greatest tracking device ever\nyou can say wow that's a nice gift I'm\ngood or leave it at home or don't carry\nit with you I mean we're seeing that\nthose um airpods for a minute until\nApple should have showed people like the\nway that your your phone can detect\nthere's one near you is a you know\nbecame all of a sudden tracking people\nbecame something you could do for 20\nbucks you think you always used to be\nlike that yeah so there's a there's an\nintensity and a jealousy and a oh what\nyou want us to work like you're not you\ndon't even like me and they'll be like\nyou know what you know I'll show you I'm\ngonna go hurt myself and people will be\nlike what is happening and they'll be\nterrified and so I would say if early in\na relationship\nand it'll be early like in the first\nmonth or two somebody's really saying\nhow come you need to do that how come\nyou're talking to that that's a sign to\nsay this is not cool like a relationship\nthey're not trusting you out the gate\nand it's that intense and it almost\nfeels like if I want to have my life\nthey're going to tell me I'm being\nI'm I'm not into them then if you and\nDean are into them and someone's telling\nyou you're not because you're doing the\nthings that you normally do in your life\nthis may not be your person but\nespecially for young people I see this\nmore often they're really into me and\nthey want to spend all their time with\nme and this is like this is so intense\nand this is amazing an intense amazing\nquick relationships can often really can\nreally be problematic they want to move\nin quick they want to get engaged quick\nif they want to get married quick slow\ndown and it's usually\num coupled with love bombing right like\nit's controlling jealousy and it's also\nlike giving you flowers every day right\nit's like kind of a company it can be\nyeah it can be it can be the flowers but\nmore in with the malignant narcissistic\nfolks it's more like I have to be with\nyou all the time right and it and again\nfor a lot of people especially for\nsomebody who might have had a history\nwhere they didn't feel seen and they\ndidn't feel heard and especially if\nthey've had past relationships where a\nperson was kind kind of distance and and\ndidn't get back to them in time the idea\nthat somebody could be so into you even\nthough it might be controlling for some\npeople can actually feel like wow this\nis actually great that somebody wants to\nknow what time I got home or touch his\nbase with me good morning good night\nthey text me a lot during the day and my\nlast relationship the person never even\nanswered my text that kind of contrast\ncan also set someone up so but I here's\nthe I if the ultimate answer to that\nquestion I mean we could break it down\ndon't take a phone don't do this you\nfeel it in your body when we feel unsafe\nwith someone we feel it we feel it\ninternally our past the way we've we've\nheld harm threats and Trauma in the past\nwe feel it and the key is to pay\nattention to that sometimes people say I\nI think I'm just overthinking it pay\nattention because I think for the vast\nmajority clients I've worked with if\nthey had paid attention to that feeling\nearly on they would have probably gotten\nout before it got too much like a week\nor two in it might still be at a point\nwhere you can step away but I listen\nI've worked with people say after two\nweeks I I stepped out of relationship we\nhad gone on all of two dates and the\nperson sent me these really abusive\ntexts and that went on for weeks or\nmonths so it's not always easy yeah\nabsolutely it can be difficult\nespecially if you're attracted to the\nnarcissist yeah often they are\nattractive right like they they uh spend\na lot of time curating an image right\nyeah and they're taking care of their\nappearance I mean people you know they\nwill ensure that they look good I mean\nthe way things look are really important\nto narcissistic people very important I\nmean again it's a superficiality it's\npart of the personality style so are you\nan attractive partner are they\nattractive so whatever that means\nhowever they make themselves attractive\nit's going to be different for everyone\nit's going to be really important\nbecause they derive a lot of their\nidentity from that and they derive their\nidentity from what their partner looks\nlike or what their family looks like so\neither they're going to lie about it to\nmake it sound better than it is or\nthey're going to be attracted to someone\nwho'll bring that into a relationship\nabsolutely and then explore further us\nand I think this is a great question\nbecause a lot of us have to deal with\nnarcissists in the workplace he had or\nhe or she asks I have a colleague in my\noffice who I believe has a narcissist\nwho has narcissistic behavior I always\nfeel anxious and drained after meeting\nup with him what should I do to save my\nmental health this is such a great\nquestion and I think it's very relatable\nbecause for a lot of folks they may\nactually have a very healthy\nrelationship have good family ties have\ngood friends but say where I'm\nencountering this is at work and don't\ndiscount how much of an impact that can\nhave we spend a lot of our waking hours\nat work in fact we know workplace stress\ncan have significant health and mental\nhealth impacts so in this case though\nthe person said it beautifully they said\nI feel drained and depleted after I\nspend time with this person pay\nattention to that feeling that work is\ntough because sometimes you have to have\ncontact with someone you work with\notherwise you may not be able to afford\nto leave your job it may have benefits\nyou might have spent a long time there\nit might be a hard job job to get them\nmany reasons but we have to stand mostly\nbecause we need money right that's why\nwe keep going to work and so what but\nthat that experience my some guidance I\ngive to someone in that situation is\nnumber one make sure you document stuff\nbecause if this keeps getting worse and\nworse in the absence of documentation\nthere's almost nothing you can do in the\nworkplace number two when you know you\nhave to encounter this person prepare\nfor it so if you're like shoot I have a\ntwo o'clock with this colleague the\nnight before make sure you get enough\nsleep be good to like like almost like\nyou're preparing for an exam or\nsomething like before the meeting some\ndeep breaths recognize above all else\nand I always tell people it's not\npersonal like narcissistic people are\ngoing at people because you are bringing\nout their shame you're bringing out\nyou're you're disappointing them you're\nfrustrating them you could be anyone\nright A lot of times we think what could\nI do differently I mean other than give\nin to them on everything there's not\nmuch you can do you can't do that at\nwork so\nprepare for that recognize like I have\nto be realistic I'm going to keep it I'm\ngoing to play it tight I actually\nremember once having a work meeting\nwhere I watched someone do this and he\ndid it brilliantly he knew what we were\ngoing to be dealing with and he said\nRomney don't say a word just let this\nperson talk just let him talk and talk\nand talk and we're going to nod politely\nand say yep we're going to make our\nnotes the other person I thought the\nnarcissistic person was going to lose it\nbecause if we weren't giving them what\nthey wanted but we were taking it all in\nwe're very clear on what we needed to\nget done like the thing that needed to\nget done got done but his advice was\nbrilliant because we didn't engage in\nfact a piece of guidance I gave everyone\nwhen you're dealing with narcissistic\npeople is an easy thing to remember I\ntell you don't go deep go what do I mean\nby don't go deep deep stands for don't\ndefend D don't engage e don't explain e\nand don't personalize what that means is\ndon't get in the mud with them they're\nnot going to take responsibility they're\ngoing to they're going to make it sound\nlike you're the one doing something\nyou're saying no no no no let me explain\num keep it tight and then and then when\nthe meeting is done when you feel\ndepleted do something about that\nwhatever that looks like if you're able\nto take a break take a walk\num uh if you're in a place where you\ncould actually literally step away and\ntake a nap do that you may not always be\nable to do that take a breath text a\nfriend who's something who's supportive\nif you have a book you read that helps\nyou Center Journal do something to bring\nyourself down in an intentional way it's\nnot like oh God I'm so depleted I've got\nto go on to the next thing take a minute\nand recognize that yours your nervous\nsystem's like I am exhausted from sort\nof being that on edge and then and then\nknow that when you get home from work\nthat day whatever you can do you know to\nto do something for yourself again to\nalmost bring yourself back to that uh\nparasympathetic state of relaxation go\nto bed earlier how do your workout\nwhatever it may be but it's about really\nbringing yourself back in to that\nhealthy space and these these these\nencounters they exhaust and deplete us\nall the time and so I have to tell you\nwhen I have narcissistic workplace\nencounters those are nights and I say\nyou know what I'm gonna have to shut it\ndown early tonight because it this this\none really run me out and on the topic\nof narcissism in the workplace do\nnarcissists tend to be very\nMachiavellian in the workplace just very\nmuch yeah they're very Machiavellian the\ntriangulated gossip-mongering turning\npeople against each other sometimes\npassing rumors\num you tell them something in confidence\nthey might tell someone else always\ntrying to figure out the best\nopportunity for them in the worst cases\nthey might even steal your work or your\nintellectual contributions this is why\nI'm saying documentation is everything\nwhen you're working with narcissistic\npeople absolutely and then Captain Kurt\nasked and this question was asked a few\ntimes how do I know if I'm the\nnarcissist it's a great question\nactually yeah I mean it's a difficult\nquestion because here's the thing there\nare patterns in narcissism the\num sometimes the problems with\nimpulsivity the egocentricity like the\nsense of I'm I got to do my own thing\nthe the challenges with intimacy the\nchallenges with empathy we can see some\nof those things parallel other patterns\npost trauma in some cases Addiction in\nsome cases even depression in some cases\nso I would say to folks who are asking\nthis number one be self-reflective on\nhow you are with other people do you\ngenuinely care about them and do you let\nthem know that do you take the time even\nif it's not convenient for you from time\nto time to hear other people and be\npresent with that do you truly believe\nthat your needs are more important than\nother people's you know do you really\nbelieve your own hype or you're are you\nnot that person I think what I've\ntypically seen is that the people who\nask that question will be struggling\nwith another mental health issue but\nit's resulted in some patterns\nparticularly sort of the not feeling\nthey can connect with other people and\nfeeling sort of indifferent to people\nand because that can be paralleled in so\nmany other mental health issues I'll\noften say to people go go ask yourself\nthose other questions like how do I feel\nabout other people do I care about them\nyou know do I genuinely feel like I'm\nspecial do I feel like I'm I'm\neveryone's out to get me\num do I shift blame\nthose are the questions you have to ask\nyourself and\nand then I answered them honestly yeah\nbut then also if you're still a concern\ntalk to a therapist and see you might\nsay like listen ever since Something's\nHappened to me I notice and I'm more\nselfish than I've ever been and and that\ncould be something that can be discussed\nwhen Ariana asked um sometimes my\nboyfriend can act narcissistic he always\nreminds me that he's better looking than\nme and that I'm lucky to have him how do\nI address this to him that it hurts me\nwhen he calls me ugly can we go to\nAriana's question after we go to Renee's\nbecause Renee's questions I don't want\nto lose Renee yeah my mother isn't okay\nso Renee sorry about that Ernie my\nmother is narcissistic is it possible\nthat she actually loves me it's a great\nquestion yeah I think it gets into a\nmuch bigger philosophical question of\nwhat is love and what does it mean to be\nlike yeah right everyone's walking\naround with different definitions of\nlove and\nthat your narcissistic mother believes\nshe loves you she really really does and\nRenee your experience of what she gave\nyou of love may not feel like love you\nmight feel like it was always her needs\nfirst I was secondary I was actually a\nplace she got her needs met I would have\nto listen to her I'd have to do things\nas long as we did what she wanted then\nshe was happy\nif somebody's convinced they love you I\nactually think it's gaslighting to say\nno you don't all right if some if you\nsomebody says they love me I I take that\nat face value however it is valid to say\nI know you say you love me\nI am not having that experience because\nyour actions aren't showing me that\nbecause I think again for me I'm an\nactions kind of gal so I really do\nbelieve that actions really matter when\npeople say they love you I think a lot\nof people out there would say I'd be\nfine never hearing the words I love you\nonce if the other person did write by me\nand that's what Renee sounds like she\nhad hoped for in her mother\nwhat's challenging is that for the\nnarcissistic person love is a paradox in\norder for them to love it really has to\nbe about self-love so to the degree\nRenee's mom might view Renee as an\nextension of herself or then Renee's mom\nloves her right because Renee's part of\nher mom so thus you know it's sometimes\npeople narcissistic people love because\nit's like what they know is the right\nthing to do I I but I don't ever believe\nwe get to doubt that I think Renee\nthough the the tricky bit is you may not\nhave felt loved and I understand that\nbecause that's the Paradox of anyone\nwho's had a narcissistic parent is that\nyou don't feel like you were loved and\nthat can feel painful I think the hard\npart is to recognize that just because\nyou didn't feel loved doesn't mean\nyou're not lovable obviously you are and\nthat your mother believed that she loved\nyou so it's meaningless to get into the\nconversation with her about whether she\nloved you but to understand that you\nlikely didn't have that experience of\nfeeling loved and sometimes people can\nfeel guilty for believing that that like\nI felt like my parents doesn't love me\nbut that's not okay because they fed me\nor they kept shelter over them I'm like\nthat's good and well that's not enough\nthat's not love that's just sort of the\nminimum requirements but yeah but for\nRenee there can be a real period of\ngrief and you recognize I know that she\nthought she loved me it didn't feel\nloving and there's grief around that\nbecause you can't go back and get a\ndo-over on childhood but to recognize\nthough that all of that never undercuts\nthat you Renee are lovable yeah you're\ndeserving of love Renee I'm sorry that\nyou're going through that\num we're all deserving of love from our\nparents right it's like fundamental\nright\nyes yeah\num and so back to Ariana's question she\nsaid my boyfriend always reminds me that\nhe's better looking than me makes me\nfeel ugly\num how do I address this to him because\nI just feel worthless okay so Ariana if\nsomebody even thinks it's within the\nrealm of reason to say something like\nthat that's abusive right yes you\ncomment on someone's appearance and just\nto give you a to give you a framing\naround that commenting on another\nperson's appearance to them is a\nboundary violation commenting on their\nweight commenting on what they're\nwearing I mean I mean unless they're\nsoliciting that and asking like how do\nyou think I look and then you're like\nyou know I think it looks great or you\nknow you might want to go a size bigger\nthat's very different than going up and\nsaying I think you looked this but for\nsomebody who you're in a relationship\nwith an intimate relationship with where\npart of that sort of social contract is\nsome level of attraction for somebody to\nsay these things about how I'm I'm\nattractive but you're not that's the\npower and control play right that's\nputting you on your back foot because\nnow you're in a state of distress Ariana\nin that relationship you feel sad and\nhurt and ashamed and humiliated\nembarrassed whatever feelings you're\nhaving I can't tell you how you feel but\nthey're not good feelings and when we\ndon't have good feelings we're\ndiminished right we're almost having to\nput our Psychological Resources and\nmanaging the hurt and the wound right\nand so that that the that when that when\nyour boundaries violated in that way and\nyou're being harmed and I feel like\ncritiques about appearance are abuse I\nreally do absolutely that then you're on\nyou're on your back foot and the other\nperson in the relationship really\nactually does get to maintain a position\nof dominance the tricky bit with Ariana\nis I don't know that there's a direct\npath to saying something because my\nguess is by now Ariana has said I feel\nhurt if you haven't start there for no\nother reason that at a minimum the other\nperson try it once they I feel hurt when\nyou say that but if somebody's capable\nof saying that that we go back to that\nself-reflective capacity this person has\nnone to be able to say you're not\nattractive if indeed that's his story\nand he really believes that he might say\nI know this is going to be hard but I\ndon't feel attracted to you anymore I\nwant to end the relationship Ariana\nwould solve a broken heart but that's\nvery different than a person maintaining\na relationship with you while saying I'm\nbetter than you it's better that they\nend the relationship that's the more I\nthat's the more honest move but this to\nme feels like a power play and it is not\ngood for you and it is again it is a\nboundary violation when somebody\ncomments on your appearance in any way\nwhen it is unsolicited and I think we\nlive in a world where everybody's\ncommenting on other people's images all\nthe time and frankly it's really made us\nsloppy at that even if a parent if\nyou're a child and your parents said to\nyou hey you know somebody's getting a\nlittle chubby boundary violation yeah\nthat's it and I wanted to address this\nAriana you're not worthless I'm sorry\nthat hell to the no I'm sure and I'm\nsure that Ariana's gorgeous you know\nwhat I'm saying like that's what it it\nbreaks my heart when I hear comments\nlike this that somebody would have the\nunmitigated Gall to tell someone that\nthey ostensibly love someone and then\nwould go tell someone they're not\nattractive oh but by the way I am again\nAriana you've got that light in some\nways you know the painful answer to this\nbut whatever happens in this please oh\nplease recognize that that beauty you\ncarry because I I I just it it angers me\nwhen I when I hear that and that's why I\ndo what I do so you keep go shining your\nlight out there girl yeah Ariana you're\nbeautiful and you don't deserve to feel\nthat way well thank you Dr ramani that's\nthe end of the audience segment and I\njust have one more question\nyou froze prevalent than ever can you go\nback and because you froze for a minute\nwhen you were saying that oh sorry\num can you hear me now sorry do you\nthink that in our society narcissism is\nmore prevalent than ever or is it just\nbeing exposed now because of social\nmedia and Tick Tock and all of that I\nthink it's a mixed bag I think that this\npersonality style has probably existed\nsince time immemorial we're a\nhierarchical species there's always\ngoing to be someone who's trying to be\nthe the big bossy you know mean person\nthat's we're we have Alphas it's\nhierarchical we're primates it is what\nit is right if you want to look at it in\nthe most simple terms but we are\ndefinitely a hominid species we're a\nhierarchical species and so that's one\nthing to keep in mind but that so I\nthink it's always been around but I\nthink the difference is that now that\nthere's you know greater behavioral\naccountability it used to be that we\njust sort of you know because the\ndiminished roles people have you know\nother than the people people in the\nhighest positions of power could do\nwhatever they want and everyone else got\nto say nothing about it mercifully the\nworld has shifted somewhat and we do\nhave the capacity to say there's some\nthings that aren't okay you can to\nremember it I think people forget this\nwe have not even been talking about\ntrauma as a clinical phenomenon we've\nonly been talking about it that way for\nmaybe 60 70 years that's new yeah so\nwe're all of this is new mental health\nis still the field in its infancy we've\nalways known when somebody sort of was\nhaving those struggles but we've never\nreally been able to approach it in the\nsort of compassionate way we should so\nin this way is it more prevalent it's\nhard to know if it's more prevalent some\nresearch suggests it's not I do think\nthough that what we're starting to learn\nabout what is and what is not acceptable\nin a relationship and speaking out about\nit about it instead of people suffering\nin silence\nabsolutely well with that being said\nthis is the end of our first episode of\npsychology Roundtable thank you so much\nfor being here Dr Romney you're so\nbrilliant intelligent amazing thank you\nfor your questions thank you Michelle\nfor your amazing questions I really\nappreciate it and to the audience for\nyour fantastic questions to every one of\nyou you know just remember that like you\nknow it's always you always seek out the\nhelp you need but also don't ever let\nanyone dim your light absolutely you\nguys are all worthy of love and healthy\nrelationships so that is the end of our\nstream thank you psych2go viewers until\nthe next one bye-bye"
