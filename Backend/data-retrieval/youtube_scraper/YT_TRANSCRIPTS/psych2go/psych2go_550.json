    "transcript": "foreign\nERS Our Guest for today's live stream is\nBrian sham one of our amazing writers\nhere at site2go Brian is a software\nengineer based in London and he's also\npassionate about writing and spreading\nAutism Awareness Brian has created\nseveral topics on the on the topic of\nautism for psych2go which are linked in\nthe description welcome Brian thank you\nso much for joining me today\nwell hi Michelle it's great to be here\nit's great to be here so can you tell me\na little bit about yourself and your\nbackground\nthanks for the introduction I think\nyou've covered most of my background\nthere when it comes to psych2go I was\nactually a fan for a few years and it\nhelped me a lot in my life in the year\n2021 there was an open ad for a new\nwriter and I actually referred a friend\nof mine who was a psychologist\nand he was also subscribed to the\nchannel however he wasn't interested in\nparticipating so I applied myself and I\nsee a disciplescope and it's like to go\nthey were impressed and they knew that I\nhad autism so I officially joined an\nAugust 2021 as the first\nautistic writer to help write autism\nrelated scripts although I've related\nabout some other psychology topics as\nwell so I've been at working for psych\nto go as a writer for almost two years\nnow\nthat's amazing so you're like a pioneer\nother people are going to feel like\ninspired to apply to psych to go and\nwrite about autism that's amazing\nso when were you diagnosed with autism\nBrian\nI was diagnosed with autism at the age\nof 16. so at the time I was diagnosed\nwith Asperger's Syndrome after being\nreferred by my school and even before\nthen there were some signs from a young\nage but others just thought I had an\neccentric or a pedantic personality\nand it was only a high school that\nothers really started to notice that I\nhad really rigid routines and habits and\nthe teachers actually suspected me of\nhaving OCD at the time so they referred\nme to a specialist and actually\ndiagnosed me with Asperger's Syndrome\nand for those not familiar with the term\nAsperger's Syndrome was an older\ndiagnosis for individuals who had some\nautistic behavioral traits but didn't\nhave significant verbal deficits\num which is where you would get\ndiagnosed with you know full autism\nspectrum disorder and in the past 10\nyears there's actually been a change to\nthe Visual Diagnosis and the DSM and the\nICD which is the official classification\nguides used in the field of psychology\nPsychiatry Asperger's Syndrome was no\nlonger an official diagnosis but it's\nbeen merged into the general autism\nspectrum\nand my case is a little different from\nmost other autistic people because it's\nusual for them to be diagnosed at a much\nyounger age when parents and teachers\nnotice significant differences in\nBehavior especially things like language\ndifficulties\noh thank you for clarifying that because\nI did hear about that that it's been\nchanged in that um can you like clarify\nthat again so ask Burgers isn't like on\nthe it's like different now it's like um\nIt's all under autism spectrum disorder\nthat's right yes autism spectrum\ndisorder is the big umbrella term and\nthat's pretty much the only one that's\nofficial now okay thank you for\nclarifying that because there's probably\npeople who don't know that and still\nthink that yeah it's like different and\nso then how did your autism diagnosis\nimpact your or shape your world of you\ngrowing up or your original diagnosis of\nAsperger's sure I think being diagnosed\non the autism spectrum or big guys with\nAsperger syndrome really impacted my\nworldview a lot at the time so although\nthat happened relatively late in my\nteens it did give me a lot of clarity\nabout why I was different from others\nand that made things a lot smoother\nknowing that so the diagnosis led me and\nmy family to pursue some books and some\nresources to help me with my\ncommunication and cropping strategies\nand for me personally it really helped\nme to be less critical of myself when I\nwasn't able to do things that others\nwere able to do especially like messing\nup socially and so that way I wasn't\nholding myself to Impossible\nexpectations or impossible comparisons\nwith others\num which is what which is what would\nhappen before a lot since I could see I\nwas struggling socially a lot compared\nto other people at school but as for you\nMichelle\num what has it been like for you to have\na loved one with autism and how have you\nsupported them\nwell you know it is difficult because we\nlive in a society that isn't you know as\naccepting as it should be and it's\nalways hurtful even if you're not the\none who's directly impacted by it seeing\nyour loved one be discriminated against\nbecause the truth is I feel like\nneurodiver the people in the\nneurodivergent community community they\nget discriminated against I really feel\nlike they do get discriminated against\nand I noticed my loved one get\ndiscriminated against and it hurts me\nyou know it's awful to to witness that\nand that's why it's my mission to\ndestigmatize mental illness and\ndestigmatize you know any you know\nautism anything like that because it's\njust wrong you know to see people get\ndiscriminated against\nestimation of Olives like to go yeah\nthat's you know the mission and it's an\namazing Mission that's Noble and I think\nwe're doing an amazing job what do you\nthink\nwell we just passed 11 million\nsubscribers so clearly we've done we're\ndoing something right yeah obviously\nright 10 years and counting right\nand then um so\nhonestly\num how did you feel that did you did you\nfeel that you received the support you\nneeded growing up from loved ones\nteachers at school because you did\nmention your family you mentioned that\nyour family like did research on it so\ndo you feel like they rallied around you\nand gave you the support you needed\nwhen it came to my family yes I I think\nthey did the best they could with what\nthey had we were referred to a lot of\nresources that we could pursue on our\nown in my case when we saw the\nspecialist he said my case wasn't\num severe enough to actually go to any\nyou know specific programs or anything\nlike that that was reserved for for a\nvery limited number of people\num when it came to the school\num I feel the teachers didn't really\nhave much of a knowledge about that so\num there wasn't really much of a for\nhealthcare and then going to University\nthere were they were actually kind of\nclueless about it to be honest really\nout of the University there wasn't like\nstudent organizations and more like\nSupport Services\nthere wasn't an official\num support service for that but\nthey seemed kind of dismissive\ndismissive I'm sorry that you dealt with\nthat experience often that can happen\nbecause there isn't always like people\nwho are trained which they should be\nright\nlike the necessary training isn't always\nthere for like professionals who are\nsupposed to help students right\nyeah it's unfortunate\num\nI mean I I went in there with um not\nvery high expectations anyway but\num after that I thought okay I just\ngotta just gotta deal with this on my\nown it was it was disappointing but and\nwell I mean I I went the first 16 years\nof my life not having that support and\nyou know I I I knew some strategies\nthat's amazing so like you learn how to\nlike cope with it and you learn to like\nbe your own advocate in a way\nto some degree yes yes I mean there are\nlimits to what I can do by myself but\num\nI think part of having the diagnosis\num also fills you with a bit of\nconfidence that you can actually\num\nyou know succeed in this world even if\nit is difficult because you've done it\nalready so far\nand so do you feel like you ever\nstruggled at all due to autism like did\nyou ever experience bullying\nyeah there's definitely a lot of\nstruggles that came with autism so\ngrowing up my main issues were to do\nwith communication and socializing so a\ncommon experience for autistic people is\ntaking comments too literally and that\ncan lead to misunderstandings when it\ncomes from an authority figure so one\nexample I remember quite strongly is\nwhen I was in school when I was around\n13 years old\num we were in drama class\nand we had these performances all\nplanned and the teacher asked me oh\nBrian would you like to go first\nand I interpreted that as a literal\nquestion and I just said no thanks and\nthen after that the teacher got really\nangry and she said I wasn't asking\nand I got so confused by her reaction\nbecause I was thinking what do you mean\nyou weren't asking that's a Christian\nthat's that's how Christians work I mean\nwhy get angry that I answered what you\nasked me that it was very baffling to me\nI thought it was just really\nstraightforward what she was trying to\nask me so I gave her a straightforward\nanswer\num nowadays I have a bit more insight\ninto that sort of thing\num which is what those resources helped\nme to understand so now I know that the\nteacher was asking me a rhetorical\nquestion and she thought probably\nthought that I was just trying to be\nfunny which explains her reaction\nwell in reality she should have tried\nexplaining it to you instead of like\nscolding you right away like well this\nwas before my diagnosis afterwards I\nthink they were a bit more supportive of\nthat but okay\nabsolutely she still should have just\nexplained it though like for Eddie\nbecause you know putting a student on\nthe spot right and just scolding them\nlike no right so I guess she could have\nbut I get what you're saying so you\nreceived the support you needed like\nafter you were diagnosed\nafterwards they were a bit more open to\ngiving me the benefit of the doubt and\nexplaining things like that\nokay that's awesome to hear and what are\nthe main misconceptions that you've\nnoticed people have about autism\nyeah so the misconceptions is actually\nthe focus of\nthat I wrote about the biggest myths\nabout autism I think it's the one that's\nLinked In the video description below\nhere and in my opinion the biggest\nmisconception is lumping all autistic\npeople into one monolith so on one hand\nyou have a very negative opinion that\nautism is primarily a disability and the\nfocus is only on what we can't do the\nstruggles we face and there are\ncertainly a lot of struggles and a lot\nof autistic people who need help with a\nlot of life skills but if you pay too\nmuch attention to the charity ad for\ninstance you'd get the false impression\nthat we're all like that and that we\ncan't you know achieve anything in life\nand that can lead to comments where\npeople might say to me oh I'm surprised\nyou have autism but you have a job that\nyou can but you have friends things like\nthat and it's a bit condescending\nbecause they think absolutely an\nautistic person is someone who can't\neven take the shoelaces that's obviously\nnot the case but on the other hand\num there's also a tendency to lump\nautistic people into that rape Man\ncategory where we all have these\nsuperhuman mental abilities and we can\nfigure out these very Advanced things on\nthe spot and again there is some truth\nin that because there are plenty of\nexamples of very highly accomplished\nscientists and inventors and artists who\nare on the Spectrum so it's good that\npeople are aware of these positive\nexamples of those positive abilities\nthe problem is if you assume that we all\nhave these amazing talents and you put\nus all in the pedestal that can set some\nunrealistic expectations and that can\nactually deny us understanding and help\nthat we need so the main misconception\nis actually lumping us all into one\nstereotype whether it's overly negative\nor overly positive because every\nautistic person is different that's why\nthey're called autism spectrum and\neveryone has a mix of strengths they can\noffer and some weaknesses where they\nwill need some help and understanding\nand guidance\nthat's amazing that you said that\nbecause I do think that's the main\nmisconception with a lot not just autism\nbut with other you know\nyou know just just with anything when it\ncomes to mental health like okay well\npeople who have this disorder are like\nthis or people who have autism have this\nor if someone and you know there's\nalways like people just want to\nstereotype others and in reality it's\nlike no we're all individuals and we all\ncome with different personalities\nstrengths weaknesses like you said so I\nthink that's amazing that you brought\nthat up and um what should people know\nabout the beauty of neurodiversity\nso well for anyone who's not familiar\nwith that term neurodiversity is the\nidea that everyone's brains are wired\ndifferently and when it comes to\nconditions like autism spectrum or ADHD\nthings like that these are just\nvariations to be understood to be\naccommodated and to be accepted and not\nnecessarily disabilities to be treated\nor cured which was the older way of more\ntraditional way of thinking about it so\nI think the beauty of neurodiversity is\nhow it offers a more hopeful perspective\nabout the autism spectrum so although we\ndo have our struggles and shortcomings\nthe neurodiversity Paradigm suggests\nthat we should think there's not like\nsymptoms to fix but more just like\nfriction between individual and the\nenvironment that's not adapted to them\nbecause for those with for those\nneurotypicals that being a neurotypical\nbeing a term for people with you know\ntypical or ordinary sort of brain\nstructure in the general population I\nmean everyone has mental shortcomings\ntoo the difference is that the\nenvironment is adapted for their mental\nprofiles so there's just no or there's\nless friction for them\nso through this lens if we accept autism\nas a natural variation\nit's just more appreciation of our\nintrinsic worth which can have a huge\neffect on our self-esteem if we're not\nbeing labeled as wrong or defective in\nsome way\nand it helps us to retain some of our\nautistic behaviors and ways of thinking\nbut defined ways of\num\nfind healthy ways to adapt or COPE in\nthis setting that's good for\nneurotypical people rather than trying\nto eliminate the behaviors at their core\nwhich is something that creates a lot of\nstress and Trauma and ironically those\nsorts of treatments can actually create\nmore issues than the original autistic\ntraits themselves but by accepting or\nadapting them we can truly celebrate the\ndifferences that make us special\nI was about to ask that question from\npersonal experiences\num that you've had how do you feel that\nour differences make us special\nwhen it comes to the autism spectrum\ngoing back to that you know monolith\nthing there's no one-size-fits-all list\nof traits that's going to make everyone\nspecial but there are some common ones\nthat um you know I've got common to\npeople with Autism so one of them is\nattention to detail as autistic people\nare often quite good at noticing\nparticular things that neurotypicals can\ngloss over we're also good at spotting\npatterns and memorizing facts and\nespecially when it comes to our special\ninterests which are things that um agent\nof autistic person sort of has a you\nknow deep passion about and there's some\nevidence that autistic people actually\nover-represented in scientific Fields\nbecause of this particular kind of\nmental skill set\num again some of them in all of them\nand on a personal level as in terms of\npersonal traits autistic people are\noften quite straightforward and they're\nquite reliable\nespecially with a speech um\nthat that can be good and bad but\ngenerally it's it's it's it's\num it's very helpful to have someone who\ndoesn't sort of beat around the bush and\njust sets things straight\num but when it comes to me in particular\num I seem to have a specialty for\nmemorizing things and organizing or\nplanning things so that can be that's\num that's actually quite a valuable\nasset and my job as a software engineer\nbecause I'm essentially arranging things\nlike within a computer system or even\nlike within teams\num and it's it's just helpful in my\ngeneral life because that I naturally\ntry to make everything quite orderly and\norganized\num there's that's one area where by\nautism actually I think there's a good\ndifference and you're very articulate\nand so um\nhow how do you feel that psych to go is\nhelping to dismantle harmful stereotypes\nabout autism and how can we continue to\nspread awareness effectively\nI think psychico is a great platform for\ndismantling harmful stereotypes about\nit's about everything that psychology\nrelated as you mentioned like every sort\nof mental health or psychology related\ntopic so we've just passed 11 million\nsubscribers and our format is\num very engaging it's very enticing\nthere's a lot of cute animations and\nwhen it comes to autism in particular I\nwas brought into the team to give her an\nauthentic Viewpoint about that topic and\nwe we've already released that two-part\nepisode about autism myths and that's\nalready been quite effective because our\nviewers are passionate about all sort of\nsubjects to do with mental health and\npsychology even if it's ones that\nhaven't really heard of before and it's\ngotten a good response from all sorts of\nviewers so it's gotten a good response\nfrom viewers who weren't familiar with\nautism because it explains things\nclearly for those with no prior\nunderstanding but it's also got a good\nresponse from autistic Fields especially\nautistic viewers because they recognize\na lot of myths and their eyes from the\npeople around them and they're glad to\nhave a resource that they can share with\nothers they don't have to keep\nexplaining the same things over and over\nto everyone around them\nand when it comes to spreading this\nawareness in the future that's a matter\nof our viewers sharing our content to a\nwider Network because at the end of the\nday the people who most need psych to\nghost videos are the ones who aren't\nactually subscribed to us to begin with\nbecause they're not getting the\ninformation and affirmation that they\nneed\nabsolutely but what I love about site2go\nis that they're always dedicated to like\nevolving and learning like even if we\ndon't always create the perfect video\nlike we're always trying to learn and\nwe're always trying to do better\nto help others and we take\naccountability for you know when we need\nto improve right and when we need to\nspread more awareness but we're always\nthere's like a mission at psych to go to\nalways do better\nabsolutely I mean we're always um\nreading the the feedback of our fans\nwe're always looking at the reception\nthat everything gets we're trying to\nmake a good impact and if we need to\nadapt to improve ourselves then we\nalways do that yep and I love that and\nso now we're going to move to the\naudience segment where we answer viewer\nquestions I'm super excited for this so\nthe first question was asked by Maria\nshe asked hello Brian I'm being severely\nbullied in school due to my autism I\ndon't know how to deal with it and I\nfeel like no one accepts me do you have\nany advice on how to deal with this\nthat's a really difficult one because\nwhen it comes to bullying in general I\nmean the standard advice is like tell\nthe school make sure that teachers know\num so they can do something about it but\na lot of the times the whole problem\nbehind being bullying is that you've\nalready done that you've already tried\nthat\num\nand if that doesn't work\num\nI mean I I can tell you from my personal\nexperience\num being on the autism spectrum\ndefinitely\num makes you more of a Target\nfor bullies and I think one of\nthe main\nfactors is\nthat autistic people often don't have\nmuch of a support network or a social\nnetwork\num because it's difficult\num\nto make these social connections and I\nthink and if we're just going through my\nlife experience I think that once I did\nactually get the the tools and guidance\nto four more social connections to have\nthis network of friends around me then\nthat\num\nthat helped a lot with um with bullying\nbecause then I have people around me who\num Can can vouch for me who can\num who can can stick up for me and if\nyou just spend more time around people\nwho do appreciate you then\num then you're not spending time with\nthe people who who won't appreciate you\nat all\num so that that would be from my\nexperience\num and we would get around it and that's\namazing so what you mean is like\ncreating a strong support system\nessentially yes that's right yes it's\nperfect and then um Adrian asks do you\nthink that autism worsens social anxiety\nand daily life\ndefinitely\num\nso autistic people and one of the key\nfactors behind autistic people is\ndifficulty with like socializing and\num communication and in my in my\nexperience that's also had a very strong\nrelationship with social anxiety because\nif I don't know how this I mean you if\nyou remember back to the example with\nthe drama teacher and if I don't know\nhow people are going to react when I say\nvery straightforward things then that\ncan create a lot of anxiety because I\ndon't know how if they're going to\nreceive that positively or negatively\nand they've been a a lot of times when\nyou know I tried to reach out try to\nsocialize only to get like a very strong\nnegative reaction and I had no idea why\nso I I do feel like there is a\nconnection between autism autistic\ntraits and social anxiety although not\neveryone who has autism will respond in\nthat sort of way with anxiety but I I do\nthink it's related and if if you can get\ntreat if I mean if this is something\nthat's affecting you and you can get\ntreatment for social anxiety yourself\nthen that does help\nabsolutely and then Tristan asks do you\nagree that the impact of autism is\ngreater when living in poverty how does\none navigate autism when they don't have\nthe financial resources to get mental\nhealth treatment\nso this is something\nthat um\nthat affects a lot of people because on\none hand you've got people autism who\nmight live in poverty and they might not\nbe able to access these\num resources but there's also a lot of\npeople in similar situations where\nperhaps they're in a school or they're\njust in a society that has very low\nawareness or they just don't have these\nthings available so if we just broaden\nthat a little\nthere's definitely a big impact of being\nautistic but not being in a situation or\ncircumstances you can easily reach out\nand get any sort of mental health\ntreatment either for you know dealing\nwith autism itself or dealing with any\nsort of anxiety or any sort of you know\nside effects of that\num so in that case if that's something\nthat is bothering you there are online\nforums\num I believe there's one called\nwrongplanet.net or something like that\nand that's\num like an internet forum for people\nwith Autism and you share your\nexperiences and you can listen to lots\nof like tips and advice and that's\ndefinitely something\nthat helps if you're unable to reach out\nto like professional help\nand then Gina asked I Gina asked I have\nADHD so I understand some aspects of\nbeing\nso I'll just read this last part my so I\nunderstand certain aspects of you know\npeople who are autistic I'm good at\ncalming my brother dumb but it's hard to\nbe patient how should I help him sorry\nfor butchering your question jaina but\nyeah so\nthere it is Brian\num when it comes to being patient\num it that can be difficult I mean if\nyou just ask my family members about\nwhat it was like\num being with me growing up\num yeah they they definitely exercised a\nlot of patience I think\num\npart of that is just\ngiving that person enough space to\nexpress themselves if there is something\nthat's really bothering them because a\nlot of things that will bother autistic\npeople and cause perhaps meltdowns or\nbreakdowns or what have you\num are things that you might not\nunderstand or expect at face value so\nhaving\num the ability to\num understand and sympathize with\nwhatever's going on in their life and\nwhat's affecting them\num it's easier said than done but once\nonce you have that understanding then\nthat can help you to manage some of\nthese\num\nsort of outbursts\nand then someone asked is loneliness\ncommon among autistic people\nyes it's probably one of the most common\nuh issues that autistic people face and\num for this\nI would go back to my advice about\ninternet forums for people who are also\nautistic because\num if you're having trouble with the\npeople in real life then the people on\nautism forums will always be there\nthey'll always understand\nand in my experience it really helps\nactually with written communication on\nthe internet because you don't have to\nconstantly think about all these other\nthings you know like eye contact facial\nexpression tone of voice it's it's much\nmore straightforward if you're just on a\nforum\nand building on that do you feel like\nthe discrimination against autistic that\nautistic people face kind of contributes\nto that alienation that maybe makes them\nfeel lonely like they're alienated in a\nway sometimes\nyes definitely\num so even I mean in my case um even\nbefore I was diagnosed with\num Asperger's Syndrome at the age of 16.\na lot of people\num did pick up on the fact that I was\nbehaving very differently very oddly and\nthat's something that led to a lot of\nalienation even if they don't have any\nspecific label like autism to actually\nput on me so I do think that is a big\nfactor both yeah both autism and also\nthe the awareness and the discrimination\nfrom the parties absolutely and then\nJack asked Brian how do you accommodate\nsomeone in the workplace with autism I\nthink this is a great question because\nit's about dismantling stigma so you\nknow leave it to you Brian\nwell when it comes to what um\naccommodating autism it's hard to give\nany one-size-fits-all answer because\neveryone with autism will have their own\num special sort of requirements or\nrequests so the important thing is I\nmean if you are in the sort of like you\nknow HR position it's just sort of reach\nout to them and ask them how you how you\ncan accommodate them in particular but\nif you meet someone like a co-worker\nwhere you're not really in a position to\nlike change the environment\nI guess there are some common things\nthat you can\nthat you can do and one thing that has\nprobably helped me in my work life is\num\njust to be\nquite straightforward with your\ncommunication so\num try not to use you know rhetorical\nquestions sarcasm\num\nif if you want to ask them something or\nrequest something don't beat around the\nbush just go straight for it that\nprobably won't be offended\num but in my case I really appreciate\nwhen people just say what they want from\nme\nperfect and then Alexander asked and\nthis is kind of a loaded question\nthere's like several questions within\nthe question but I'll start with the\nfirst one Brian do you think that ABA\ntherapy is a form of torture\noh for anyone in the audience who isn't\nfamiliar ABA therapy I believe it stands\nfor slide behavioral analysis and this\nis a form of\num tree it's a sort of older form of\ntreatment for autistic children that um\nrevolves around something I sort of\nhinted at before which is like\neliminating or suppressing like autistic\nbehaviors and something that has been\nquite controversial because of its\nmethods they can be quite harsh and also\njust because of the very premise of it\nit's um it's been sort of likened to dog\ntraining but for humans and there have\nbeen a lot of\num\ncases where\nyou know the autistic children go\nthrough this training they they come out\num acting more neurotypical\nwhich can help them\num in social situations but at the same\ntime they also end up with a lot of\num mental health issues and Trauma so\nit's definitely something that um\nhas raised a lot of controversy and\num and yeah some have labeled it like a\nform of torture\nand then he asks what do or here she\nasks what do you think about autistic be\npeople being treated with electric\nshocks in the U.S\nwell I'm assuming this is related to the\nthe previous question yeah\ntherapy yeah yeah with with ABA some of\nthe the methods used yeah it can be\nquite harsh sometimes they are like\nelectric\num would you say it's unethical oh yeah\ndefinitely it's something that I would\nsay yeah it is it's quite horrifying I\nmean I personally never went through\nthis myself so I've only heard like\nsecondhand things but even that is\num it's quite troubling to me trying to\nthe idea of trying to fix something\nthat is a sort of like you're hardwired\num it's both unethical and it's\npractically impossible\nand then\nhe's also Alexander is also asking what\ndo you think about the organization\nAutism Speaks and I know that they've\nbeen\num at the center of a lot of controversy\nso yes yes so for anyone not a familiar\nand or in the audience\num Autism Speaks as an organization or\nsort of autism charity that funds that\nhas a lot of um\nstrong relationships with\num ABA therapy and and they fund a lot\nof research and treatment based around\nthe idea that\num you know autism is something to be\ncured or fixed so that is something that\nhas been very controversial and has a\nvery negative\nreputation on autistic people especially\nbecause of those methods that we were\ntalking about ABA and uh like electric\nshocks and things like that\nand then Adrian asks Brian what should I\ndo when I feel self-conscious about\nbeing autistic in Daily social\nsituations and not correctly picking up\non social cues\nin that case\num it usually helps to have at least one\nperson in the interaction who knows\nabout you being autistic and they can\nactually help to smoothen things out so\nif you're not picking up on something\nlike in my case I might have a friend\nwho might sort of you know hint at me\nlike oh I think this person is getting a\nbit bored of the conversation maybe they\nwant to change the subject or something\nlike that\num\nor\num\nyeah when it comes you know so when it\ncomes to those sorts of interactions\nhaving at least one person who can\nactually guide guide you interpret\nthings for you is very very helpful\nI love this question by Edison what are\nsome positive positive things you've\nseen or experienced in the autism\ncommunity and how has it impacted you\nforeign\nwithin the autism Community some of the\nmost positive things\nare just um\nyou know sharing a lot of affirmation\nabout\num\nabout autistic traits and how they can\nbe\num\nhow\nhow they how they can be beneficial and\nnot necessarily stigmatized so I think\ngrowing up\num especially when you're not diagnosed\nwith autism there's a lot of\num stigma discrimination around\num\nyou know people engaging in autistic\nbehaviors and just knowing that there\nare lots of people out there\num who can say no actually this is\nsomething you can embrace it's not\nsomething to be ashamed of it's not\nnecessarily something to suppress\num that's definitely something that has\nbeen quite positive and as for affecting\nyou personally I think you're hearing\nthose sorts of positive messages and\nknowing ways to sort of adapt them those\nsorts of autism behaviors if they are\ncausing any issues in my life so that um\nso it's not necessarily a matter of me\njust like suppressing it all the time\nand then Lauren asked what do you think\nof Sia's movie regarding autism titled\nmusic did you see that I haven't seen it\nI did I've heard a lot about it um yeah\nI know why people are upset about it but\nI haven't seen it personally because I I\nknow that when I was um reading about it\nand reading comments um from different\npeople if you know they were saying that\nthe movie felt like offensive you know\nto people in the autism community that\nwas like the controversy that's what I\nread as well like it was a very it was\nalmost like a caricature of autistic\npeople it wasn't it wasn't anything\nauthentic like we have a psych to go and\nlike what you had said about like\nautistic people don't exist as a\nmonolith and I feel like that movie was\nsort of like perpetuating those\nstereotypes\nyeah yes from what I've heard it\ndefinitely perpetuated a lot of these\nImpressions that people in the general\npopulation have but aren't necessarily\naccurate to you know all people with\nAutism\num if well this is just from what I've\nheard I definitely have nothing in\ncommon with\num the autistic character in the film\nand then Jenny asked has your cultural\nbackground affected the way your family\nloved ones Community has approached um\nyou when it comes to your like autism\nhas there been like a a difference\nbecause of culture I think that's what\nshe's trying to get at a little bit yes\num so in my culture I mean I'm from\naotearo in New Zealand but originally my\nfamily comes from Hong Kong and I don't\nthink\num authors I think I don't think they\neven knew anything about autism\num before I got my diagnosis so having\nsome of that\num\nI think coming from a society where like\nno one knows anything about those mental\nhealth conditions knowing nothing about\nautism they're definitely\num made things a lot more difficult when\nit came to understanding my situation\num and when I got diagnosed you know\nthey really had to sit down with my\nparents and you know go through some\nreally basic things like no it's not\nsomething that you catch it's just\nsomething you was born with it wasn't\nanything to do with you know it wasn't\nyour fault as a parent for example\num\ncoming from that background that made\nthings a little bit\nharder for my family at first but they\ncome they came to learn about it\nthat's amazing and having their support\nmade the difference right\nsorry did you hear me sorry oh I I was\nwaiting I thought you were going two\nyeah so what was oh I was just saying\nlike having the support of your family\nmade all the difference right oh yes I\ngave a little nod yeah\nsorry about that and then Darth asked\nBrian I mean this is gonna be the last\nquestion Brian what what has been your\nspecial interest in your life\nuh my special interest is vexillology\nwhich is the study of flags and I'm\nactually Platinum there's a flag in the\nback yes there's actually a few and I\nthink I'm sort of blocking it there you\ncan see I love that\nbecause I'm actually part of a few uh\nvexillological organizations as well um\nif there's anyone from Utah you'll know\nthat your state flag actually got\nredesigned last year and um I was\nactually uh\none of the advisors who was actually\nadvising the government on\num some of the specifications of that\nflag that's amazing oh my why don't you\nbreak this up before well I mean on the\ntopic of special interests I mean this\nis one of those things that they've been\npositive messages from the forums like\nyou don't have to treat this like it's\nsome weird Obsession you can turn this\ninto something productive\nhealthy interesting exactly yes that's\nso awesome and um how long have you been\ninto that\nI I was into that generally since I was\num around 13. but as for actually\npursuing this like actually connecting\nwith other people and things like that\nand it's only in the past few years that\nI've actually reached out and you know\nactually\npursued it written things about it\num got in contact with um those sort of\nredesign campaigns that sort of thing\nand that concludes our audience segment\nbut I still have a few questions for you\nBrian so I wanted to know what topics\nshould psych to go cover in the future\nregarding autism and which ones would\nyou like to write about\nwell when it comes to autism\num there is a lot of\num\nI don't know if we call them subtypes\nbut there are lots of terms that the\naudience might not be familiar with that\nsort of correspond to these subtypes of\nautism so I've mentioned Asperger's\nSyndrome which is my one\num but there are other sort of diagnoses\nof some in the past some in the present\nlike um there's one called PDD NOS so I\nthink something that we could cover is\nto sort of untangle what all these\ndifferent autistic related terms are\nwhat they mean and how they relate to\neach other because for the people in the\ngeneral population\num there's a lot to keep up with I mean\nautism by itself is sort of a mystery\nfor a lot of people but then having all\nthese other ones these autism and\nhearing about the autism spectrum\nAsperger's I mean there's just a lot a\nlot of terms for them to come to grips\nwith and try and figure out\nand then just in general just so that I\nknow because I'm also a writer on the\nchannel and just um just in general what\ntopics would you like to see psych to go\ncover\n[Music]\num anything and everything\nI think\nin in the past I've been trying to push\nfor some more audience interaction stuff\nso more like q a or advice column\nsessions\num\nbecause a lot of what we put out is kind\nof you know General like here's some\ngeneral information about anxiety\ngeneral information about relationships\nbut having something I guess it's\npersonal I'm kind of doing this here\naren't we we aren't some of the audience\nquestions I have I think having a lot of\ninteractive things like that and really\nhelps us to connect with our audience\nand build a community yeah\nour audience sometimes says we have too\nmany videos about sex is that true\nI haven't been keeping count\nwell just on that I do have an interview\nwith the sex expert next week so we got\nanother one coming so that's why I bring\nit up because you know we're doing more\nI'm interviewing someone it's our very\nfirst interview with a sex expert on the\nchannel so I'm excited for that just\npreviewing that but thank you so much\nBrian for being here with us it's\namazing you're so articulate you're so\ninteresting and you're so knowledgeable\nand so we really appreciate you being\nhere and I love your videos by the way\nthanks it was great to be here\nawesome well thank you to our amazing\nintelligent viewers at psych2go we'll\nsee you in the next one bye-bye okay"
