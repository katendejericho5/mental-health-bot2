    "transcript": "what's the first thing that comes to\nmind when you think self-help maybe it's\na new diet Trend or a motivational\npodcast or Ted Talk a workout routine or\na bunch of best-selling books that went\nviral on Tick Tock whatever your answer\nis the popularity of all of the above\nspeaks volumes about the\nself-improvement craze that's been\nhappening worldwide\nand while it's certainly great that as a\nsociety we have such a strong desire to\nbetter ourselves make no mistake there's\na dark side to self-help too\neasy to miss and even easier to fall\ninto the self-help industry is also\nriddled with toxic positivity phony\ngurus\nan empty affirmations\nso if you've been thinking of doing some\nself-improvement lately watch this video\nbefore you do to avoid these potential\nproblems\nthe psychological impact\nthe famous saying too much of a good\nthing can be a bad thing applies to\nself-help too\nbest-selling author Mark Manson who\nwrote the number one New York Times\nbestseller the subtle art of not giving\noff says that there are only two types\nof people who get hooked on self-help\nthe bad to okay and the okay to Great\nbad to okay people seek self-help\nbecause they feel that something is\nfundamentally wrong with them okay to\ngreat people on the other hand are\ngenerally adequate have good emotional\nadjustment and mental health and want to\nuse self-help to maximize all of these\nthings and go from good to Great the\nproblem is most of the self-help\nmaterial out there is aimed more to the\nbad to okay people than the okay to\ngreat but it's the farmer that ends up\ngaining more from it why because of the\npsychological impact of self-help on our\nself-esteem\nbad to okay people can feel inadequate\nso they're already low self-esteem\nstarts dwindling in the words of Mark\nManson the irony here is that the\nprerequisite for self-help to be\neffective is the one crucial thing that\nself-help cannot actually help\naccept yourself as a good person who\nmakes mistakes\nthe questionable ethics\none reason why some people remain\nskeptical of self-help is that they\nbelieve that the industry Mantra is a\npatient healed is a customer lost\nand they're not entirely wrong about\nthat self-help marketing has been\ncriticized because it creates\nunrealistic expectations just to sell\nproducts that aren't even scientifically\nproven some so-called Wellness experts\nand self-help gurus don't even practice\nwhat they preach much less care enough\nif it's been proven to be true or not\nthe profit motive however shouldn't be\nso surprising given that the industry\nhas now become worth billions of dollars\nit made a total revenue of\n17.29 billion dollars in the last year\nalone according to recent statistics\nreported by John LaRosa president of\nMarket data statistics why because\naccording to entrepreneur psychologist\nand hit author MJ DeMarco the incentive\nis not on creating real change but the\nillusion of it the concept he calls\naction faking see the lure of\nself-development DeMarco explains is\nthat it gets you hooked on the feeling\nof accomplishing something and\nmotivating you to do more but after a\ncertain point you'll most likely just\nend up relapsing and feeling frustrated\nwith yourself again because there's\nalways a new standard to reach something\nyou're doing wrong or one more way\nyou're not enough at the end of the day\nthe more unhappy and disconnected you\nare with your life the more the\nself-help industry stands to profit from\nyou how to avoid the downsides just to\nbe clear we're aware that the criticisms\naren't true of the entire self-help\nindustry in fact self-help can benefit\nus greatly if we know how to apply its\nteachings properly\naccording to a non-profit mental health\ninformational blog healthy Place\npsychological self-help taught by\nlegitimate sources can be incredibly\nbeneficial\nthe potential of mental health self-help\nmaterials to make a positive difference\nin the lives of those suffering from\nmental illnesses is real rights mental\nhealth journalist Samantha Gluck the\nchallenge comes in choosing material\nthat's authoritative clearly written and\npresented in a style that motivates you\nto do the work required to get better\nsimilarly a study by psychologist Joanne\nwood and her colleagues found that\ncommon self-help mantras such as I am a\nbeautiful person and I am capable of\nanything only help people who already\nhave high self-esteem and may make\nthings worse for people with low\nself-esteem the researchers believe this\nis because such unreasonably positive\nblanket statements may only remind them\nthat they aren't measuring up to the\nstandards they have for themselves so\nthey suggest using more specific and\nrealistic positive statements like I'm\ngood at dot dot dot to avoid worsening\nany feelings of inferiority self-help\nauthor and speaker Robert ringer also\nsaid that those who stand to gain the\nmost from self-help are those who are\nready to apply it in their lives long\nterm not those looking for a shortcut to\nmotivation and happiness he explains\nthat we can never make any lasting or\nmeaningful change in our lives as long\nas we hold on to the misguided belief\nthat there's something about us that\nneeds to be fixed or that there's a\ncertain answer we're looking for we need\nto understand that no one else can do\nthe work of self-improvement for us and\nlearn to listen to The Quiet voice\ninside that says this works for me this\nis good for me\nin the words of the former first lady of\nthe United States Rosalind Carter once\nyou accept the fact that you're not\nperfect then you develop some confidence\nthat's why self-acceptance matters so\nmuch more than anything any book podcast\nor Seminar can teach you and it's the\nkey to unlocking all the benefits\nself-help can give you\nin the end it's all about balance and\nfinding the right sources that work for\nyou by being aware of the potential\npitfalls and choosing reputable sources\nyou can make sure that your journey\ntowards self-improvement is a
