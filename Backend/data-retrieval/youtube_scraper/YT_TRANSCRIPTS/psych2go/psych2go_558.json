    "transcript": "hello psych2go viewers Our Guest for\ntoday's live stream is Erica and we're\ngoing to be discussing her lived\nexperiences of living with Piero also\nknown as pure obsessional OCD which is\nalso not which is an internal form of\nOCD Erica is the host of her own podcast\nand YouTube channel just say maybe which\nis linked in the description and she's\ndedicated to spreading mental health\nawareness through her work welcome Erica\nthank you for joining us today\nthanks Michelle thanks for having me I'm\nexcited to be here of course can you\ntell us a little bit about yourself and\nyour background\nsure yeah so my name is Erica\num I live in the DC area\num I've been\nworking\num with OCD advocacy in the past year or\nso after I was I would say I was\ndiagnosed formally maybe two years ago\nnow so after doing some research on my\nown and I wanted to help others feel\nless alone and educate themselves on OCD\nand anxiety and all those sorts of\nthings so\num yeah but I'm excited to be here and\ntalk about OCD infuro and all that\nawesome and we're happy to have you so\nwhen were you diagnosed with OCD just\nfor starters\nyeah so I was diagnosed I think it was\nin October\n2021 so almost two years ago now\num I had been to a few therapists before\nthen and\nwe had always kind of talked about OCD\nin a in a less I guess clinical way and\njust in in terms of patterns I had but\nformally I would say about a year and a\nhalf two years ago\nand so could you explain to our audience\nwhat OCD is for those who maybe don't\nknow\nsure yeah so OCD stands for obsessive\ncompulsive disorder it used to be I'm\nnot a clinician and I'm not um yeah I'm\nnot a therapist I'm just someone who has\nlive experience and is explaining all\nthis so you know I could always have a\nlittle bit of error in what I'm\nexplaining but as far as I know\num yeah OCD stands for obsessive\ncompulsive disorder it's in the like\nDSM-5 which is the formal manual for\num diagnostic uh I think it's like\ndiagnostic statistics manual I can't\nremember what it's what this stands for\nbut it's um\nthe kind of form a list of mental health\ndiagnoses you can have and it used to be\nan anxiety disorder but now it's part of\nlike a subgroup of OCD and other Related\nDisorders and basically\num the obsessions come in forms of\nintrusive thoughts or\num sometimes it's triggered by an event\nwhere sometimes it's just something that\nstarts to happen over time\num and then that Obsession grows and you\nstart to perform compulsions in in order\nto relieve the anxiety from those\nobsessions so and can come in all shapes\nand forms in all different people but\nmainly the the underlying feeling is\nanxiety and it's characterized by\nrepetitive cycles and rituals\nso switching from OCD to Pure o when did\nyou find out or realize that you were\nliving with Piero and was it through a\nmental health professional since it's a\ndifferent like form of OCD\nyeah I mean the first time I personally\nhad even come across the term pure o was\nwhen I was still in college\num because I was trying to figure out\nwhat was going on with me I didn't know\nI only knew about what the media\nportrays as OCD which is still a valid\nform of OCD which is where you you're\ncompulsively hand washing or cleaning or\norganizing\num so I didn't really understand what\npure o was um so that was about I don't\nknow maybe eight seven or eight years\nago so I had kind of floated the term\naround with a few therapists I had seen\nbut it wasn't really until I guess my my\ncurrent therapist where I felt validated\nin the sense that this is someone who\nactually knows what this is\num you can't get diagnosed of pure o you\ncan get diagnosed with OCD and then um\neven pure o the term itself as you\nprobably know it's a very controversial\nterm because it stands for purely\nobsessional\num there's not really such thing as a\npurely obsessional um OCD what it means\nby that is that the compulsions are in\nturn internal and so you can't really\nsee them happening which is why it's a\nlittle bit harder to explain to other\npeople because they can't see as visibly\nwhat's happening inside of you and\nwhat's causing you this anxiety\num so yeah I mean I've known about it\nfor a while I'd say like past two years\nI've leaned in on it more thank you so\nmuch for clarifying that because people\nmight feel confused about like what is\nPuro what's the difference is it\nsomething that can be diagnosed so thank\nyou so much that was a great\nclarification and so other than the fact\nthat OCD requires a diagnosis from a\nhealth care provider\num other than that what are the\ndifferences between OCD and Puro\nyeah so I mean I can give you a specific\nexample\num I would say\nso in when we talk about OCD there's a\nlot of different themes that may come up\nsometimes we call them subtypes as well\nso\num there's such thing as you know health\nanxiety Health OCD where you're\nconstantly\num in fear that your health is at risk\nand so you might compulsively go to the\ndoctor because you have a cold and you\nthink maybe that cold is going to kill\nyou and so\num you can't stand the uncertainty of\nwhether or not this is just a mild\nillness or if it's something very\nserious so a physical compulsion is\nliterally going to the doctor over and\nover again to try to calm your your\nfears someone with maybe health anxiety\nor health OCD that doesn't have as\nvisible or physical as compulsions might\njust try to reassure themselves\nconstantly or you know a lot of us do\nthis but uh Google symptoms and try to\nreassure yourself through Reading\narticles and posting on online forums\nand all of these things are you know\nthings that people who don't have OCD\nwill do too the difference is when it\ninterferes with your life when you're\nconstantly in in great anxiety and fear\num you're isolating yourself from other\npeople and and I think one of the\ncriteria is if it's taking up more than\nan hour of your day pretty much every\nday then that's definitely a problem so\num it's it's more of like an internal\ndialogue that's going on with pure o\num whereas physical compulsions are are\nthings that other people can see that\nyou're doing\num so\nyeah\nand since they're a little different did\nthis treatment for OCD work with Piero\neffectively\nor would you say that something\ndifferent needs to be like maybe\nprescribed or\nlike yeah\nI would say the basis of it is the same\num maybe and yeah I would say that the\nbasis of of it is the same so uh what we\nsay a lot in kind of like the OCD\nCommunity is that Erp which stands for\nexposure and response prevention therapy\nis the gold standard for OCD treatment\nand what that is is\num it's a very kind of organized sort of\nexposure where you label your anxiety on\na scale\num and so it not necessarily totally\njust throws you into the you know throws\nyou into the river to try to try to\nstart to swim it's usually pretty\ngradual\num and so you'll have the clinician who\nwill expose the the patient or the\nclient to something that triggers them\nthat causes intrusive thoughts or\ncompulsions and then they'll just try to\nto get that client to not respond which\nis the response prevention part so if\nyour compulsion is to ruminate which is\num a symptom that's pretty characterized\nby or a symptom that is that is common\nin pure CD is just a lot of rumination\num your therapist might just try to get\nyou to acknowledge that you're about to\nstart ruminating and then just try to\nget you to just sit there in the anxiety\num even if\nit makes you very uncomfortable\num but you know it's always supervised\nso\nyeah let's say someone has\num\nlet's say someone has harm OCD so harm\nOCD is when you might have intrusive\nthoughts about\nuh hurting yourself or your loved ones\num someone who has maybe more physical\ncompulsions like hiding knives in their\ndrawer\num\ntheir clinician may ask them to hold\nthat knife in their hand and just sit\nthere with it for 30 seconds and feel\nthe anxiety come over them but someone\nwho maybe doesn't have any kind of\nvisible compulsions like hiding knives\nmaybe their their compulsion is just to\nask like\nwhat is it about myself that's making me\nhave a centrusive thought like why am I\neven thinking this way and this is kind\nof rumination so in that case someone\nwho's showing more pure o symptoms of\ncompulsions their clinician might just\nask them to to sit there and not\nruminate or not try to reassure\nthemselves or something like that\num yeah so she mentioned rumination um\nhow does like Pier o interfere with like\ndaily life like I know that the\nrumination can be really severe in the\nintrusive thoughts so could you explain\nthat like maybe for you in the past how\nit maybe interfered with daily life\nyeah so for me I I had a little bit of a\nBreaking Point um in the OCD community\ncommunity you we kind of refer it to it\nas you know the day your brain broke\num and it's kind of like the day that\nsomething changed and you couldn't stop\ncompulsing\num I think there's different stages of\nthat you know sometimes throughout your\nlife you'll have phases of really\ndifficult OCD periods but for me I I got\ninto you know I got into a new\nrelationship a few years ago\num and I think being in that\nrelationship especially because it was\none that was very different than the\nkind of dynamic I was used to started to\nmake me even more anxious so I think\nthis is one of those ironic things is\nlike when you get into something that's\na little healthier you start to feel\nmore anxious and you start to look for\nthings that are wrong and I think my\nmind started to\num just like cling on to all the\nanxieties I had\num and so what that looked like for me\nwas in the form of like relationship OCD\nand sexual orientation OCD\nwondering if my partner was the right\npartner for me\nconstantly checking my attraction to\nother people I it's like before that\nmoment it's kind of like a sense of\nhyper awareness yeah you know\num before before that moment I was\nperfectly fine with just walking down\nthe street you know and I'd say to my\npartner like oh this person is is pretty\nor this person's cute or whatever and\nthere was no problem with it but one day\nI I said the same thing and then it the\nthe thought popped into my head does\nthat mean that you know that you don't\nlove your partner does that mean that\nyou're not the sexual orientation you\nthought you were and it's it's difficult\nto explain to people because a lot of\npeople question their sexual orientation\nbut not to the extent of where you start\nto be so hyper aware of every single\nperson around you that you're constantly\nchecking internally where your\nattraction is so the same way that\nsomeone who maybe has like\nresponsibility OCD who's scared to leave\ntheir house because they keep checking\nto make sure the lights are on or off\num that's a different form of checking\nsomeone who maybe has internal OCD\nthey're going to be checking their own\nfeelings their own attraction their\ndesires with harm OCD they might think\nwhen I held that knife like okay I\ndidn't feel like stabbing someone right\nlike I just felt like cutting yeah my my\nvegetables right there's just constant\nkind of questioning yourself and you\nstart to build this this air of distrust\nwith your within yourself and then and\nthen all of a sudden you start\nquestioning your entire life\num everything up to that point you know\nwas it real did I misinterpret it am I\nreally who I think I am and so I think I\nthink it's just hard to\nit's hard to just start seeing your life\nin a completely different way\num\nso that's that's it that's all that's\nhow it\nso in a lot of ways the rumination and\nthe intrusive thoughts sort of like\nSpiral into anxiety is that kind of what\nhappens it turns into anxiety it turns\ninto like severe worry and like maybe\nparanoia in a way\nyeah I would say there's some paranoia\nthere yeah you're definitely right about\nthe spiraling\num I mean it feels like you're losing\ncontrol and that's that's one of the\nthings that um a lot of people with ocu\nwill say is that they're they fear that\neven having the intrusive thought means\nthat they're about to lose control that\ntheir true self is about to be shown\num so people who have really stigmatized\nforms of OCD you know we can say like\nharm OCD\num any OCD relating to sexually\nintrusive thoughts like sexual\norientation OCD or pedophilia OCD like\nthose types of OCD that you really don't\nhear about because they're not as family\nfriendly to talk about those are\nespecially difficult because they really\ndig at your values and the reason why\npeople even have some of these intrusive\nthoughts come up is because they're so\nfar away from wanting to do that that\ntheir brain keeps checking to make sure\nthat there's no danger involved\num so if you're someone who really cares\nabout you know have really strong family\nvalues and this happens a lot to\npostpartum mothers\num they have thoughts about harming\ntheir child in any way to perform they\nthey're maybe they're having those\nintrusive thoughts because they don't\nwant any harm to come to their child and\nthe fact that they're so terrified by\nthose thoughts means that they don't\nwant to do it\num but then it gets into this battle\ninside yourself like well why would I\nhave the thought in the first place and\nit's really just giving a lot of meaning\nto your thought that I think\num makes it start to spiral I don't know\nif you've heard of the term thought\naction Fusion\nI have not could you explain that to our\nviewers yeah it's it's it's a term that\nbasically means that uh you consider\nyour thoughts to be having the thought\nto be equal to performing the action so\nyou feel the same amount of emotion that\nyou would have is if that event were to\nactually happen in real life so for\nsomeone who's seeing very violent\num harmful just disturbing intrusive\nthoughts repetitively that there it's\nalmost as though they're seeing it in\nreal time and they're feeling what's\nit's like having a lot of people say\nit's like having a horror movie like\nplaying Non-Stop and you can't turn it\noff in your head\nbut for you does it help or for like\nanyone have you noticed that does it\nhelp to like talk about it like does it\nhelp sort of like instead of keeping it\nrepressed does it help to maybe like\nexplain the intrusive thought to people\nto therapists does that help or is this\nI don't know\nI I think yeah it helps to talk to\npeople who understand the problem is\nthat a lot of people\ndon't understand yeah and it's not\nbecause they don't necessarily want to\nnot it's not because they're like a bad\nperson for not understanding it's that\nit's because it's so taboo some of these\nsubjects that come up in these intrusive\nthoughts that uh when you talk to\nsomeone you're you're risking a lot\num you know absolutely you can't already\nmental health is stigmatized in the\nworkplace so if you were to say anything\nthat you know is that someone will\nmisinterpret you you can risk losing\nyour job you can risk losing your\ncommunity you can risk losing your\nrelationships and you know I've gone\nthrough times where I've tried to\nexplain myself to my friends to to\nunderstand like you know they're they\nthey'll say I notice you're feeling\ndepressed or anxious and like what's\ngoing on and then\num you try your best to explain it and\nthen they they don't they either start\nto\nbelieve\nthat the fears you have about yourself\nare real yeah or or they\num they will try to combat what you say\nwith logic which is another layer of\nthis complex issue is that trying to\nfight OCD with logic\num is\nit relieves the anxiety temporarily but\nit's just kind of another form of\nreassurance that can continue the cycle\num for example if I say like I'm I'm\nworried that I'm a bad person because I\nhad this intrusive thought about running\nsomeone over let's say\num my friend if I had a friend or a\nloved one who said no like you would\nnever do that like you're a good person\nyou would never do that\num OCD brain might say well how do you\nknow that how do you know like that\nthat's gonna happen or maybe they'll say\nokay yeah that's right but then later on\nthey'll start to ruminate about whether\nor not that's true so like they almost\nmake you in a weird way do they make you\nlike feel bad about the thought because\nthey're saying well no you're having\nthose thoughts but you're a good person\ndon't worry like it makes you feel like\nokay well am I maybe a bad person for\nhaving these thoughts exactly it's like\nwell yes yeah so like if someone you're\nyou're labeling me as a good person but\nI feel like a bad person so now I feel\neven more like I'm hiding something from\nyou because I'm not meeting your\nexpectations I don't know it's like\nexactly yeah so it becomes difficult to\nexplain to others for sure is it better\nto just accept the thought then is that\nlike a better strategy like I'm having\nthese thoughts\nthoughts don't make me you know I'm not\nacting on acting out on them I'm just\ngonna accept the fact that I have these\nthoughts and move forward is that a\nbetter strategy or is that something\nthat helps\nfor sure yeah um the reason why I chose\njust say maybe as the name of my podcast\nand my social medias\num because a lot of what we talk about\nin in therapy related to OCD is to just\naccept the uncertainty\num which is really really hard\num it's really hard especially when you\nhave intrusive thoughts that are very\nvery contrary to your values and beliefs\nwe you know we call them ego dystonic\nthoughts so thoughts that don't align\nwith your ego your identity your sense\nof self I've never heard that term can\nyou like repeat that again that's so\ninteresting\num it's called an ego dystonic thought\nyou know dystonic thoughts yeah so ego\ndystonic versus ego syntonic so ego\nsyntonic meaning the thoughts align with\nyour beliefs your values your ego your\nidentity as a person\num ego dystonic meaning it's it doesn't\nit completely contradicts what you\nactually believe in oh that's so I never\nknow that we always learn something new\nbut go on sorry no no worries yeah yeah\nso I mean it's just something to kind of\nkeep keep in mind that\num thoughts are sometimes a wild card\nyou can't you can't control your\nthoughts\num the more control you have over them I\nwould say or more the more control you\ntry to have over them\num the less comfortable you are with\nuncertainty and I think that\num what we try to do a lot in like\nexposure and response prevention therapy\nis try to get people to build back up\nthat self-trust to you know to just\nbelieve that the values you say you hold\nand the person you say you are like that\nis the person you are and that's just\nbecause you have these terrible\nintrusive thoughts doesn't mean that\nthat contradicts who you believe\nyourself to be yeah\nyou made a really interesting point\nthere that you know our thoughts\nsometimes we can't control them and a\nlot of times I think often people think\nthat their thoughts are a reflection of\nwho they are when in reality they're not\nlike your thoughts are your thoughts\nthat doesn't mean that it is you know a\nreflection of who you are it doesn't\nmean that you're gonna act out on them\nit doesn't really mean anything like\nwhat you said they're a wild card\nsometimes and I think that's maybe why\npeople struggle maybe with intrusive\nthoughts because they think okay well if\nI'm thinking this therefore that's who I\nam right is that really how it yeah yeah\nand I think I talked about this a little\nbit on my Instagram but um I think\nintrusive dreams are something that\nhappened I mean you've probably had like\na weird Favorite Dream before and then\nyou're just like what was that\num and but you know interests of dreams\nare are are even more difficult because\nso many people apply meaning deep\nmeaning to dreams they say like you know\nif you dreamed about I like this came to\nme in a dream and yeah that was like my\nsubconsciousness telling me I needed to\ndo something and that's definitely a\nproblem because in in your dream state I\nmean unless you've mastered\num you know what is that form of\ndreaming lucid dreaming Lucy dreaming\nunless you've mastered lucid dreaming\nyou can't control what's going on in a\ndream you just kind of like ride the\nwave yeah you you just you just let it\nhappen right and so exactly that's even\nkind of more anxiety-inducing because\nyeah you're having a dream and then\nsomething terrible intrusive is\nhappening and then you wake up and\nyou're at first your first question to\nyourself is like why did I have that\ndream what does it mean about me and\nthen that can just kind of keep exactly\nthe cycle going that's an amazing\ncomparison because it is true like\npeople kind of look at dreams and\nthoughts differently like dreams people\nkind of acknowledge that you can't\nreally control your dreams but it can be\nthe same way with thoughts so that's an\namazing comparison because it is the\nsame like you can't always control\nusually I mean no one can control their\ndreams and a lot of the time there are\npeople who can't control their thoughts\nI mean it's like the same thing it\ndoesn't mean it's a reflection of who\nyou are or your life or anything\nsometimes it just means nothing right\nright yeah I would say so yeah there\nthere are it's it's hard with I mean I'm\nnot going to say like astrology is\nnecessarily comparable but just like\nthere are a lot of even there's a lot of\nlike spiritual reasoning involved\nsometimes and people are very spiritual\nand they believe in meaning behind\ndreams and I also have you know I try to\ntake the good I have in dreams like if I\nhave a past loved one who's deceased and\nthey show up in my dreams like I do try\nto take that as a sign but it's like\nit's hard because you\nto pick and choose like that because\nthen if you attribute meaning to one\nthing in your dream then that means\nyou're you know you're more or listening\nto everything to everything and\nsometimes there's just not sometimes you\nknow dreams are just the mishmash of\nyour memories and experiences and\nthey're just kind of like spat into this\nlittle I would just think of it like\nthere's like all your memories and your\nthoughts and dreams are put into this\nlittle machine and then they just like\nspit out the other end and yeah they\nwant to be you don't know you can't you\ncan't write tonight\nI guess the best thing to do in some\ncases just accept that you have these\ndreams except that you have these\nthoughts just accept it it's not a\nreflection of you\nyeah exactly yeah and so and I wanted to\num ask this question I think it's really\nimportant what are some misconceptions\nabout OCD any form of OCD that are\nharmful and that perpetuate the stigma\nin your opinion\nsure yeah\num\nwell I mean I\nto me this is a subject that's been\ntalked about a lot but I think it's just\nbecause I'm you know I'm pretty aware of\nthat OCD advocacy Community but saying\nthings like I'm so OCD\num\num kind of telling someone that they're\nbeing OCD because they want something a\ncertain way I think people conflate OCD\nand ocpd a lot\num because ocdpd is obsessively\ncompulsive personality disorder where\nthe difference being oh see people with\nocpd are you know they want things in\norder they're very perfectionistic\num and they're not they don't they're\nnot aware that it's a problem it affects\nother people around them it affects\ntheir environment whereas a lot of OCD\nit can affect your relationships with\nother people but most of the battle is\ninternal\num and it's it's not it the people who\nhave OCD are more aware that what their\nissues are are a problem so I think\nthere's a kind of misunderstanding\nbetween OCD and ocpd so that's one thing\nI would say\num but yeah advertising like OCD like\nobsessive Christmas disorder obsessive\ncooking disorder yeah that's awful\nI think it's just yeah it's like I'm\ninsensitive to people who have it's a\nreal disorder you know I I yeah yeah and\npeople don't make fun of cancer the same\nway I mean I exactly I know I know they\ncan't we know that cancer is not the\nsame thing I mean or like even PTSD\nlet's say or you don't you know or like\nwhen people say you're so bipolar right\nas well yeah I mean there's so many\nthings you could say yeah I've heard\nI've heard so I've heard like oh my God\nI got PTSD from this I'm like oh I'm so\nADHD about whatever and I understand\nlike I think it's just not the way I\nwould like to express myself or like the\nthings I go through\num because I do I do realize that\neveryone has different coping mechanisms\nand there are people who say I'm so OCD\nand and they do have OCD they are\ndeafness yeah so everyone is I think\nentitled to their own coping mechanisms\nbut I think when it's on a greater scale\nlike with companies\ndoing their marketing that way I think\nthat's really problematic\num absolutely oh yeah then they have to\nbe held accountable for that for sure\nyeah and I think that um education\nthat's why education is so important\nthat's why psych2go does this because\nthe more people know the education if\nthis was in schools right if they had\nmental health training classes in\nschools\nand more people\num just trained in mental health in\ngeneral I think that we would eliminate\nthe stigma or at least help with it but\nI think that when people just don't know\nthey're not doing out of doing it out of\nmalice but they're still being offensive\nright\nright yeah exactly\nsorry go ahead sorry one more thing I\nwas gonna yeah go ahead on social media\nthere's there's been a trend I would say\nin the past year or so where people say\nthings like when you let your intrusive\nthoughts win and it's um yeah that's\nlike then they show a video of I mean\nit's usually something outrageous\nhappening um but I think it's caused a\nlot of anxiety within people who have\nOCD because it's there can the person\nwith OCD would would never let their\nintrusive thoughts win like they like\nintrusive thoughts in an in and of\nthemselves are are unwanted repetitive\nthoughts that wow something to you that\nis that is contrary to what you believe\nin so they're not something you want to\ndo and so everything you do in your\ncompulsions is to prevent something like\nthat from ever happening and so you\nwould some of the OCD would never let\ntheir intrusive thoughts win and so I\nthink the meaning of intrusive thoughts\nis becoming a little bit lost\num yeah it's becoming a little bit lost\nand I think it's starting to imply that\nthese are deep rooted desires you\nactually do have that you're just all of\na sudden letting loose and that's that's\nnot what intrusive thoughts are they're\nnot your true desires they're just kind\nof like you can't help it yeah that's\nactually a really good point and like\npeople have to be careful about their\nlanguage\nand if it's not something that you've\nexperienced I mean it's not that you're\nletting it win right it's something that\nyou can't help that's the whole point\nlike that's why you have OCD it's\ncompulsive it's not something that you\nwould help but yeah that's a really\ngreat point so thank you for bringing\nthat up and highlighting that and so now\nwe're going to turn to our audience\nsegment where we answer your viewer\nquestions I'm excited for this let's\nbegin Erica because I think there's a\nlot of people in here right now cool\nlet's see\nand so Laura asks how do you effectively\ntell you know a significant other that\nyou're suffering or dealing with OCD\nyeah that's tough\num I would say it's better I think it's\nalways good to educate yourself first\nbefore you try to educate others and\nwhen I say educate yourself I mean\nlooking up resources from for example\nthe I ocdf the international OCD\nFoundation they have a lot of great\nresources and articles peer-reviewed\nstudies and everything like that that\nyou can use to show people who are\nskeptical that there's science behind\nthis and that you know a large\nproportion of the population a lot of\npeople experience this kind of these\nkind of things so I would start by\ntrying to educate yourself first and\nthen depending on what your theme of OCD\nis find some articles that are relevant\num to to that and then showing your\npartner that I mean for me it was\nrelationship and sexual orientation OCD\nand so that was very hard to talk to my\npartner about because that directly\naffects our relationship\num and you know he was very he he was he\nwas\nskeptical at first like he didn't really\nunderstand it first and if you're\nwatching you know thanks sir getting\nthrough all this with me um but over\ntime like the more the more we talked\nabout it together and like went through\nyou know educating ourselves together\nthat isn't it amazing to have a\nsupportive person right like you have\nwhat's his name\nEvan Evan hi Evan thank you for being\nsupportive\nokay and then uh let's see\num another question oh okay someone\nasked um Jennifer asked so how do you\ndeal with bullying due to having OCD in\nschool like people who don't understand\nhmm that's like a question\nI mean I haven't been in school in a\nwhile and I think I understand\neveryone has a misconception about OCD\num well not everyone but a lot of people\nwhen especially when you're still in\nmiddle school or high school\num I would say\nagain trying to educate them as well as\nyourself maybe you could have\num you could look for a peer support\ngroup in the area that could help you\nfind some resources for you know\num for a counselor or a speaker to come\nto your school to talk about it I I it's\nhard to say because that's very Case by\ncase basis but I would say having a\nsupport system is is going to get you\nthrough a difficult environment like\nthat where no one else understands so if\nyou are able to find a peer support\ngroup in your area maybe just going to\nmeetup.com or looking on the iocdf\nwebsite\num there are resources for for Online\nCareer support groups you can talk to\num I don't stop being bullying is a\nthing that I'm not an expert in\num bullies suck so\nlike and it's always their problem not\nyours it's because they're insecure\nabout something and they need to pick on\nyou and yeah\nso absolutely and then Trinity asks how\ndo you effectively get out of\nruminations\num so oh something I didn't mention uh\nis so I talked about Erp which is\nexposure and response prevention therapy\num but I didn't talk about act which is\nor act acceptance and commitment therapy\num it's a type of therapy that's very\nvalues based so it means\num it's really helpful for when you're\nin the middle of a compulsion and you\nwant to redirect your behavior towards\nyour values so let's say you're in the\nmiddle of talking to a friend and in the\nmiddle of it your conversation you see\nsomething or you hear something that\ntriggers a rumination\num in that case you might start to zone\nout not listen to your friend anymore\nbut if your value that you've kind of\nheld in your pocket there is that you\nwant to be a supportive and attentive\nfriend you want to be an active member\nin your friend group and you know have\nhealthy relationships maybe you can get\nthat value to pull you out of your\nrumination\nthis right now this rumination is\npulling me away from the kind of person\nI want to be the kind of friend I want\nto be so I'm going to do everything I\ncan right now to refocus my attention to\nthe present moment and mindfulness in\ngeneral\num mindfulness you know think take\ntaking into account the five things you\nsee four things you hear three things\nyou feel that kind of countdown list of\nbeing in the present moment that can\nhelp as well that's amazing thank you I\nagree with all that\nand then Lucy asked how do I tell my mom\nabout my OCD and I think this is a great\nquestion because sometimes people don't\nknow how to approach that conversation\nwith the loved one just in general so\nwhat would your advice be Erica\nwell I mean I I had some experience\ntelling my parents as well\num I think it's family Dynamics are\ndifficult you can have a family member\nthat's very supportive and you can have\none that's skeptical\num I I would say\nit depends on I guess how close you are\nto your family member but again\na lot of people like research a lot of\npeople like articles you can talk about\nyour share your experiences with it you\ndon't have to like you don't have to go\nsuper in detail I think some people\nthink that when you're first telling\nsomeone about OCD you need to tell them\nabsolutely everything it's every way\nit's affected you but maybe just kind of\ntaking it piece by piece and solely\neasing it into the conversation and just\nletting them know how much it affects\nyou and and if you need help or want\nhelp yeah and you don't need to I mean\nand I just wanted to add this like you\ndon't need to tell anyone until you're\nready also right yeah yeah absolutely\nand then Journey asked does grief and\nTrauma go hand in hand with OCD or even\npure o how can I heal before going back\ninto counseling or therapy\nhmm\nthat's a good question I mean if the\nquestion is how can I heal if we're\ngoing back into counseling and therapy I\nmean\ngrief and Trauma can make OCD work\nrecovery harder and they can also\ntrigger OCD like you can be someone who\nOCD has a lot of factors it's\nenvironmental and it can be genetic but\nlike you can just be kind of essentially\nyou know one day you just some nothing\nnothing traumatic happens you just all\nof a sudden start becoming hyper aware\nof something other days you have trauma\nand then that because of that very real\ntrauma you're scared that that event\nwill happen again that traumatic event\nwill happen again\num so I do think that it can go hand in\nhand it might be worth it to consider a\ntrauma a grief counselor paired with an\nOCD specialist because or have them work\ntogether because a lot of talk therapy\ncan actually be detrimental to OCD\nrecovery if that therapist is not\nSpecialized or knowledgeable about OCD\nbecause a lot of some therapists will\ntry to get you to interpret your\nfeelings more and your and your thoughts\nmore and so that will actually sometimes\nmake your OCD worse because they're\nbuying into the idea that you have about\nyourself because of your OCD so I would\nI would I would try if you have the\nmeans to to try to see both\num but it's hard and to add to that\nsometimes it takes time to find the\nright therapist\nyeah\nfor sure\num and so Clan asks I want everything in\norder does this mean I have OCD I think\nthis is a little bit of like leaning on\nlike the misconception sometimes people\nhave about OCD that just because you\nwant things in order it means you have\nit what do you think Erica since Clint\nasked to you\num I don't think it means you have OCD\nyeah it could mean you have OCD there is\na form of um just it's called Just Right\nOCD it's a subtype of OCD where you do\nwant things in a very specific order and\nlike you want things to be done in a\nvery specific way and so it's possible\nif I mean I'm again I'm not a clinician\nso I can't give you a diagnosis like you\nshould never give someone a diagnosis\nbased off of a sentence but it's\npossible\nokay thank you for letting them Beatrice\nasked did it ever happen to you Erica\nthat you ruminate so much about\nsomething that you no longer know what\nis real or fake like your true\nintentions at that moment\nis that something that you've\nexperienced yeah you yes for sure\num yeah yes I have experience that\nyou're not alone I I would probably 90\nof people who have OCD have experienced\nthat\num but again I\nyou can't know what your two intentions\nare\num something I always try to come back\nto is like\njust say maybe like you you don't know\nwhy you're truly you're never going to\nknow 100 why you had that thought you're\nnot gonna you can't even be certain that\nyou're never gonna do that thing and\nthat's terrifying to say like I you like\nyou you can't you have to just tell\nyourself like I don't know if that's\ngonna happen or not or if that's even\ntrue\num but yes I have had that happen to me\nand it's difficult rumination sucks\nawesome thank you for that Erica and\nthat was our last question for the\naudience segment and so I wanted to ask\nhow do we effectively support someone\nthat is going through OCD or any type of\nOCD for that matter\nI would say stay open-minded\num and ask questions I I don't think\nthere's really a Playbook on how you\nshould ask questions but you know try to\ngauge what's sensitive and what's\nconsiderate to your loved one who's\ngoing through it\num I went to the international OCD\nconference last year and I saw a lot of\nfamilies there there were a lot of kids\nthere teenagers parents who who were\njust there to support their their child\nand and wanted to get them help so I'd\nsay staying open-minded not telling them\noh you're just being too sensitive oh\nlike you'll get over it I think the\nworst thing you can do is invalidate\nsomeone and also know that like them\ncoming into you to tell you is something\nreally Brave that they're doing\nabsolutely they might feel like this is\ngoing to ruin their lives if they tell\nyou and so there's really a lot of\nweight that comes with it so I would\njust say try to show your appreciation\num that that they even are sharing it\nwith you yeah it does take a lot of\ncourage and I'm proud of everyone here\nwho has sought out mental health\ntreatment because it does take a lot of\ncourage to\nwant to you know help yourself so that's\namazing\nand then um last question\num what does mental health awareness\nmean to you Erica\num I mean I think it means\nhighlighting different people's stories\ntrying to listen to everyone with an\nopen heart\num I think a lot of times we just kind\nof especially on social media you don't\nreally know who's listening and how\nthey're gonna misinterpret your words\nbut I would say just try like if someone\nis talking about a really vulnerable\ntopic even if they're doing it in a way\nthat you don't necessarily like yeah I\nsee a lot of people who who don't\nnecessarily like when someone is like\nsinging and like whatever about\nsomething that they've gone through\nthat's traumatic\num it's like people have different\ncoping mechanisms and people have\ndifferent they're in different places\nand their their Journey or their\nrecovery process and so I would just say\ntry to\nyou know we we just want to we want to\nhave people be more vulnerable and more\nopen so that those who who feel isolated\naren't going to do anything to to harm\nthemselves I mean I I hear sometimes\nlike OCD awareness any kind of mental\nhealth awareness is suicide prevention\nas well\num especially and I want to just give it\nlike a kind of shout out like an\nacknowledgment to people who live in\ncountries where there are certain\num OCD themes that might be even more\nstigmatized like for example if you live\nin like Russia or like another country\nwhere maybe like being gay is literally\nillegal\num of course you're going to have like\nthe more stigmatized something is in\nyour Society the more you're going to be\nterrified even having any interesting\nthoughts related to it absolutely so I I\njust want people to be to know that\nthey're not alone and you know that yeah\nthat there's hope\num absolutely that's so amazing that you\nhighlighted that I didn't think of it\nthat were like the cultural factor that\nplays into it that can sometimes make\nyou know someone's mental health issues\neven worse\nyeah absolutely well thank you so much\nfor your work Erica you're doing amazing\nwork and you're helping so many people\nthrough your advocacy remember to look\nat the description because her podcast\nand YouTube channel is linked just say\nmaybe correct yep just say maybe well\nthank you Erica thank you to our amazing\nviewers outside to go for watching have\na great day guys thank you bye\nforeign"
