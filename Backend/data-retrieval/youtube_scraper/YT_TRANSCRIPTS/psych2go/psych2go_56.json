    "transcript": "- Almost everyone has\na phase where they feel\nas though they are stuck\nwith the most oppressive,\napathetic, and ignorant\nparents in the whole world.\nEvery household has its ups and downs.\nNo family is perfect all the time,\nexcept some families\nreally do seem like they're\nperfect from the outside.\nThat might not be reality.\nThe most loving, understanding\nand caring parents might\nnot be what they seem.\nThis is because of pseudo mutuality.\nBecause upholding\nappearances is so important\nto a pseudo mutual family,\nit can be difficult\nto tell if it's real\nlove or pseudo mutuality.\nThese are the signs that can\nhelp you spot the difference.\nWhat is pseudo mutuality?\nThe first challenge is having\na good understanding of\nwhat pseudo mutuality is.\nThe official definition\nis a family relationship\nthat has a superficial\nappearance of mutual openness\nand understanding, although\nin fact the relationship is\nrigid and depersonalizing,\nso in other words, everything's a facade.\nIt's like a prison\ndisguised as a preschool,\nperfectly sweet, loving, close,\nand wholesome on the outside,\nbut on the inside there are strict rules\nand everyone is assigned an identity.\nThis typically happens when one\nor both of the parents are narcissists,\nhave narcissistic traits\nor have a narcissistic\npersonality disorder.\nThe narcissistic parent is like\na prison warden who decides\nwhat you will do, how you will do it,\nand even who you are and who you will be.\nAnto mutual family rather\nthan getting to know\nand understand their children,\nparents will try to control\nwho their children are.\nRigid rules. Pseudo mutual families have\nextremely rigid rules.\nIf the parents say, you are\na swimmer, you are a swimmer.\nIf you decide you don't like\nswimming, the whole facade\nof caring and understanding falls apart.\nThe rules of the household are designed\nto keep you from breaking\nthat identity and\ntherefore destroying the facade.\nFrom the outside, it looks like\nyour parents are supporting\nyour hobby, making sure you\nget to practice on time,\ncheering you on at the galas,\nand ensuring you always have\nevery opportunity to succeed.\nIn reality, it can feel like\nyour parents are breathing down\nyour neck and controlling your every move.\nYour reward for playing along\nis that the family gets along,\nthey aren't supporting you.\nThey are supporting the identity\nthey have chosen for you\nand the family's image.\nYou are depersonalized\nbecause of all the ways your parents\nhave structured your life.\nIt can feel like you haven't\npursued anything of your own.\nYour successes are all\ncredited to your parents.\nYou may feel like you live\nto serve your parents\nand like you're trapped.\nPursuing your own dreams and\npassions may sound strange\nor farfetched because it goes\nagainst what your parents want\nor because your dreams are\ndecided on by your parents.\nThis depersonalization,\nalong with the stress\nof playing along with the whims\nof your parents can cause\nmental health issues like low\nself-esteem, depression,\nand anxiety strings attached.\nWhen your parents only\nshow love, when you do\nwhat they want, it feels\nlike their affection\ncomes with strings attached.\nIt's like they're insinuating\nthat I'll love you for\nas long as you do what I say.\nThis can be really emotionally taxing\nbecause it feels like your value\nas a person depends on whether\nyou meet their expectations.\nThis doesn't just apply\nto family dynamics,\nbut knowing this is important\nbecause if you're not aware\nof this dynamic in your upbringing,\nyou might unconsciously attract partners\nor friends who do the same.\nFor example, in romantic relationships,\nyou might find yourself\ndrawn to individuals\nwho replicate the dynamics you experienced\nwith your parents, and when\nyou are conditioned to think\nthat your worth is tied to the approval\nand expectations of others,\nyou may constantly feel\npressured to conform\nto their expectations,\neven to the detriment\nof your own wellbeing,\nto maintain their\naffection and acceptance.\nSo how else have your adult relationships\nbeen influenced by this?\nThis leads us to our next point.\nAdult relationships mirror\nyour family dynamic.\nWhen you're raised in a\npseudo mutual household,\nyour other relationships even as adults,\ncan be affected as well.\nYou might find that you treat\nothers like your parents\nor you attract people into your life\nwho treat you the same way\nyour parents did, for example.\nYou might try to accommodate\nthem as much as possible\nand do everything they ask.\nYou might also feel\nresponsible for others.\nIn romantic relationships\nand friendships, you\ntake a very passive role.\nYou may also lack boundaries emotionally.\nYou may have trouble\nacknowledging your feelings\nand expressing your\nneeds in your adult life.\nYou may find that your\nchildhood in a pseudo mutual\nhousehold without real\nlove, with traumatic,\nand so you seek therapy\nand therapy along with\ncutting contact with parents,\nwere found to be cathartic.\nChanges for people raised\nin pseudo mutual households.\nThis is not normal\nfor family relationships\nbased on real love.\nReal parental love comes from authentic\nunderstanding and nurturing.\nPseudo mutuality is so effective\nbecause it's disguised as real love.\nAt first glance, it seems to\nfulfill all of the same things,\nbut on closer inspection,\nit fulfills nothing.\nInstead opening you to depersonalization,\ndepression and anxiety.\nParents who raise children like this don't\ndo it intentionally.\nThey do it because they\nhave narcissistic traits\nthat influence their parenting style.\nThat isn't to say it's unavoidable.\nParents have the responsibility\nto guide their children\nto become fulfilled.\nIndependent adults.\nPseudo mutuality by\ndefinition, can't achieve that.\nIf you are a parent\nand you worry that this\nsounds like you seek guidance\nand find resources that will\nhelp you lead your family more\neffectively out of love\n- Rather than fear.\nIf you were raised\nwith pseudo mutuality, how\nhave you dealt with it?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video informative\nor helpful, leave a like\nand subscribe to Psych to go\nfor more videos like this.\nThanks for watching."
