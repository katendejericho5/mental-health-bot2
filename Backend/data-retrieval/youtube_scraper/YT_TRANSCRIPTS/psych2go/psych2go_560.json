    "transcript": "according to clinical social worker Leah\naguerre trauma impacts how we view\nourselves and the World At Large which\nin turn influences how we relate and\nrespond to other people so it should\ncome as no surprise that trauma can lead\nus to develop maladaptive behaviors and\nthought patterns that hinder us from\nhaving healthy and meaningful\nrelationships with those around us be it\nromantic or platonic although the\nAmerican Psychological associations\nclinical definition of trauma includes\nonly life-threatening experiences such\nas disasters accidents assault and so on\naguerre explains that trauma can be\ngeneralized to mean any stressful event\nor experience that threatens one sense\nof physical or emotional safety and\nwell-being so it's important to keep in\nmind that trauma can be subjective and\nit can impact Us in different ways if\nyou have unhealed trauma you may engage\nin behaviors and thought patterns that\nare damaging to your relationships\nwithout even realizing it wanna know\nmore here are five ways that trauma can\nruin your love life according to experts\nnumber one lack of trust the nature of\nthe trauma experienced can sometimes\nlead you to develop strong feelings of\nmistrust in yourself or towards others\nsuch as if you were abused mugged or\nassaulted this can make you view the\nworld as a dangerous place question the\nintentions of others and constantly seek\nout warning signs says but that sense of\nSafety and Security is important in\nbuilding a strong foundation for our\nromantic relationships because without\nit there can be no true closeness or\nemotional intimacy number two low\nself-esteem another way trauma can\nimpact your love life is by diminishing\nyour sense of self-worth and self-esteem\nexperiencing trauma says clinical\npsychologist Dr Randy Gunther will\nnaturally make us feel sad and down\nwhich can worsen into feelings of Shame\nand self-limiting beliefs you may feel\nthat you're at fault for what happened\nthat you deserved it for some reason or\nthat you should have done more to stop\nit or fight against it these harmful\nbeliefs will often lead to thoughts that\nyou shouldn't be in a happy relationship\nor that you're not good enough for the\nperson you love and because of the sense\nof familiarity it gives you may also\nfind comfort and validation in toxic\nrelationships\nnumber three controlling behaviors\naccording to clinical psychologist and\nself-help author Dr Jill P Weber trauma\ncan lead to unhealthy relationship\nbehaviors such as clinginess dependency\nand being overly controlling towards\none's significant other this is\nespecially common if the trauma is\nrelated to betrayal such as cheating in\npast romantic relationships it's not\nuncommon for those who were cheated on\nand those who cheated to develop a\nstrong need to always keep in touch with\ntheir partners and even try to control\nwhat they do where they go and who they\nspend time with\n4. conflict aversion similar to our\nprevious Point Dr Webber explains that\npeople who suffered from emotional abuse\nin the past may become extremely\nconflict averse this is harmful for\nrelationships because couples need to\nlearn how to resolve disagreements in a\nhealthy way not avoid them conflict is\nalso necessary to learn how compatible\nyou are with your partner in terms of\nyour values and goals but if you're\nstill suffering from emotional trauma\nyou may feel panicked by the thought of\nconflict and be triggered by the\nslightest of disagreements as a result\nyou might ignore red flags people please\nand repress your true feelings for as\nlong as you can but until you learn to\nwork things out with your partner your\nrelationships are bound to suffer number\nfive loneliness finally arguably one of\nthe most damaging ways trauma impacts\nyour relationships is through the\npersistent feelings of loneliness and\ndisconnection it can evoke according to\nmental health care professional Lea\nacwire this is brought about by the\nunderlying belief that no one else could\never really understand what you've gone\nthrough so it's difficult to feel\nconnected to other people\nother examples of trauma-induced\nloneliness include struggling to stay\npresent in the company of your\nsignificant others not feeling seen by\nthem or not feeling like you belong with\nthem being unable to enjoy physical\nintimacy and struggling to emotionally\ninvest in the relationship\nso what are your thoughts on this video\ndo any of the things we've talked about\nhere resonate with you if you have\nunresolved trauma in your life that's\nhurting your relationships know that\nthere is hope and that it's possible to\nheal from your trauma the good
