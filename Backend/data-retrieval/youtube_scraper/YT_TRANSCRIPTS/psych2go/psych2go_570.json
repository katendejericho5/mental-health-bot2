    "transcript": "has anyone ever called you out for\nalways playing the victim or told you\nthat you have a victim personality\nhearing things like this can be\nupsetting and make us defensive because\nit's like they're invalidating our\nfeelings and belittling our struggles\nbut it's important to recognize\nconstructive criticism when we receive\nit especially when it comes from someone\nyou trust to have your best interest at\nheart so before you dismiss their words\naltogether it might be good to take the\ntime to reflect on them first licensed\ntherapist Dr Vicky botnick defines\nvictim mentality as a state of mind\nwherein a person identifies themselves\nas a victim of circumstances or other\npeople even when untrue thus people with\nthis type of Outlook avoid taking\nresponsibility for their own actions and\nfeel that they have no control over what\nhappens to them\nwith that said here are six signs\naccording to experts that victim\nmentality may be ruining your life\nlearned helplessness\nbefore the victim mentality view\nthemselves as powerless and at the mercy\nof others or life in general the mindset\nthat we're unable to control impact or\nchange our circumstances is what is\nknown as learned helplessness according\nto licensed clinical psychologist Dr\nKaren Gap people Afflicted with learned\nhelplessness stop trying to overcome the\nchallenges they face and instead resort\nto blaming everyone else around them for\ntheir misfortunes and mistakes so if you\noften find yourself complaining all the\ntime whenever something goes wrong but\nwithout reflecting first on the part you\nmay have played then you may be\nstruggling with a victim mentality\nfalse proof of anger according to\ncounselor Andrea M Darcy and therapist\nDr Sherry Jacobson people who live their\nlife from a victim mindset tend to spend\na lot of time suffering in silence and\nrepressing their rage they are rarely\nvisibly angry but are convinced that\nthose around them are always upset or\nangry with them they read too much into\nevery little thing and take everything\ntoo personally taking it is false proof\nthat everyone else is against them as a\nway to reinforce their view that they\nare helpless victims of their own\ncircumstances\nunrealistic expectations\nsimilar to the last Point those are the\nvictim mentality also expect other\npeople to just know how they feel and\ngive them consideration all the time for\nexample when someone hurts their\nfeelings without meaning to they\nautomatically assume it was intentional\nbut they don't usually communicate it to\nthe other person because they\nunrealistically expect them to just know\nit and according to Dr Karen Gap this\nmay lead to them keeping score in\nrelationships which can also lead to\ndifficulty with intimacy and Trust\nover explaining yourself\nanother sign that you may have a victim\nmentality according to Andrea Darcy and\nDr Sherry Jacobson is that you're likely\nto over explain your side of the story\nwhenever a conflict arises\nyou may also talk about things that\nhappened a long time ago and get hung up\non the past\nwhy because those trapped in a victim\nmindset are constantly seeking proof\nthat they did nothing wrong and everyone\nelse is at fault instead\nso they can sometimes have a very warped\nsense of logic just to justify their\npassivity and inaction negative outlook\ndo you believe that the world is a\ndangerous place that other people are\ntoo self-interested or antagonistic\ntowards you and if so do you think of\nyourself as someone who can't fend for\nthemselves or achieve their goals\nbecause of it\nif so such negative self-talk is most\nlikely the result of having a\nself-victimizing Viewpoint says mental\nhealth journalist Crystal raypol and\npsychologist Dr Timothy J Leck and this\nway of thinking often gives way to\ncatastrophizing beliefs such as\neverything bad happens to me and I can't\ndo anything about it\nthat may be hurting your self-esteem\nnot coping with stress\nfinally mental health and wellness coach\nElia Cooks Campbell explains that having\na victim mentality makes it more\ndifficult for us to cope with stress\nbecause viewing ourselves as the victim\nall the time erodes our self-confidence\nand takes a toll on our emotional\nwell-being often causing a lot of\nfrustration anger and resentment so when\nstressful things happen you probably\ncan't think straight you may also have\nAngry outbursts from time to time feel\nthe need to socially withdraw and\nself-isolate and struggle with feelings\nof loneliness and depression having a\nvictim mentality can also make it\ndifficult for us to seek help or support\nfrom others because it makes us wary of\ntheir intentions\nso do you relate to any of the things\nwe've mentioned here\ndid going through this list help you\nrealize some of the ways you may be\ntrapped in a victim mentality answering\nyes may feel shameful or overwhelming\nbut recognizing that you're living your\nlife from this negative State of Mind is\nan important first step to take in\nmoving towards empowerment and away from\nvictimhood\nthe change isn't likely to come easily\nor quickly but increasing your\nself-awareness challenging negative\nself-talk with self-compassion and\npracticing accountability can make a\ngreat difference in your life your\nrelationships and your mental health\nit's also worth noting that a victim\nmentality is often an unhealthy way of\ncoping with unhealed trauma so you
