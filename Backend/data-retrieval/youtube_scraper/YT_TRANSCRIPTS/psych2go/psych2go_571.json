    "transcript": "hey sector goers welcome back have you\never had someone open up to you did you\ncomfort them by saying something nice\nthis is especially true when someone\nfeels a bit down we try to comfort them\nwith our words you might offer some\nadvice to your best friend to give them\nsome perspective but sometimes these\ncomforting words don't help and in fact\nmight hurt them more so with that said\nto avoid slipping here are seven\ncomforting words that are actually\nharmful and what you might want to do or\nsay instead number one it's okay you'll\nget over it it's understandable that\nwhen someone is sad or hurt we want them\nto feel better by talking about the\nfuture maybe you want them to know that\nthey will move on and get over their\nfeelings but when someone is opening up\nto you you can't just tell them they'll\nmove on according to clinical\npsychologist Dr Friedman telling a\nperson to move on is counterproductive\nsince it will only suppress their\nfeelings and never really process them\nthis would make them hold on to these\nnegative emotions which might come back\nin the future Instead try saying you\nhave the right to feel that way or what\nyou're feeling is valid this way they're\ngiven the time and space to process\nthose emotions\nnumber two there are people that are\ndying okay maybe not exactly those words\nbut try not to diminish people's\nfeelings it's like saying other people\nhave bigger problems the intention is to\nlet the person know that they're gonna\nbe fine but this isn't a way to comfort\nsomeone\nof course there will always be someone\nfar worse off but this doesn't make this\nperson's feelings invalid saying this\nmakes them think what they feel is less\nimportant improper even they might feel\nbad for having those emotions and become\nfearful of opening up in the future in\ncase they're invalidated again you could\ntry saying what can I do to help you\nthis could mean that you're open to\ngiving them a hand when they need you to\nnumber three what you need to do is\ngiving advice isn't necessarily bad but\nwhen someone is opening up to you advice\nmight make them think that they're not\ntrying hard enough or that the situation\nis their fault and that they're the\nproblem\nwhen we want a person to change their\nbehavior we don't tell them what to do\nbut help their motivation to truly\nchange their behavior so maybe let them\ndecide on their own because no one knows\nthem better than themselves number four\nyou know I went through the same thing\nsometimes when a person is opening up to\nyou you also want to tell them a story\nthat shows you can relate but this isn't\ncomforting them it's a way of avoiding a\nconversation with them and leads to\nminimizing their feelings\nit also leads to toxic positivity and\nmight prevent them from actually asking\nfor help and dealing with their feelings\nbecause you didn't need to telling them\na similar story is taking the light away\nfrom them and preventing them from\nexpressing their feelings everyone\nprocesses things differently try not to\nmake it about yourself number five\neverything happens for a reason\nin some instances this might work but\nnot when a person is at the peak of\ntheir emotions hearing this would make\nthem feel that what they went through\nmade sense but the reality is it doesn't\nat least not all the time according to\nPsychiatry Professor Dr beltman using\nthis statement can encourage hope but\nalso creates excessive positivity\npositivity is a good attitude but it\nshould be used at appropriate times\nupsetting times can be confusing but you\ncould just say I wish I had the right\nwords to make it make sense but I don't\nnonetheless I am here to listen\nnumber six well at least you have a job\nwhen we Comfort other people we try to\ntake away their Pain by highlighting\ngood experiences in their life but by\ndoing this you're minimizing a person's\nexperience and invalidating their\npainful experiences which might even\nmake them feel like they're being\nungrateful for the good stuff in life\ntry saying I don't know what to say but\nyou are very brave for opening up and\nnumber seven I know what you're going\nthrough even if you think you know what\nthat person is going through the truth\nis you don't grief and pain are common\nemotions everyone experiences them at\nsome point but people feel emotions to\ndifferent degrees the pain you felt when\nyou lost your dog is not the same as\nanother person losing their dog so\ninstead of saying you know what they're\ngoing through you could say I could not\nimagine what you're going through right\nnow but I'm here to listen this is an\nhonest statement of acknowledging your\nlack of knowledge of their feelings but\na reassuring statement that you will be\nthere for them despite this lack\nin a concluding note sometimes empathy\nis not what we say but simply being\npresent with them is enough sometimes\nthis might just mean sitting in Silence\nwith them or just going for a walk\ntogether whatever it is just try to\npractice active listening\ndo you want a video on active listening\nif yes
