right emotional\nresponses to situations and adapt a\nsimilar response living in tumultuous\nand unstable environments as a child may\ncause us to grow into adults that\nstruggle with anger issues or

the\namygdala to become more active\nincreasing stress hormones in the blood\nand your muscles to become tenser our\nexperiences of being yelled at as\nchildren impact how we feel about\nourselves
