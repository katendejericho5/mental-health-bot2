culture of today has\nmade us all more accountable than ever\nfor how we act online and in real life\nthe problem with being toxic however is\nthat you can be toxic without even\nknowing it or doing it intentionally\nthat's why it's important for all of us\nto check ourselves from time to time and\ntake a good honest look at how our\nactions impact those around us because\nno one's perfect and while it might be a\npainful truth to admit sometimes we even\nhurt the ones we love without meaning to\nwith that said here's your worst\npersonality trait based on your\npersonality type\nistp the virtuoso because of their\nspontaneous and relaxed nature sometimes\nistps get into trouble with their\nfriends and family for being unreliable\nthey can be unapologetically stubborn\nabout things and can easily come off as\ninsensitive to others with their use of\nlogic and rationality they also tend to\ndislike commitment because they focus\ntoo much on the moment and are prone to\nrisky antagonistic behaviors when bored\nisfp the adventurer similar to the istp\nisfps dislike for long-term commitments\nand plans make them too unpredictable to\nbe Dependable they love to live in the\nmoment so they're not very Adept at\nplanning their futures or reflecting on\ntheir past thus the isfp's worst trade\nis that they struggle to learn from\ntheir mistakes\nestp the entrepreneur esdps are the life\nof the party because of their bold\nfun-loving spontaneous personality that\nbeing said they can sometimes be\nspontaneous to a fault and put\nthemselves at risk in unfamiliar places\nor with unfamiliar people because once\nin estp sees an opportunity to fix a\nproblem to advance to have fun all rules\nand expectations fly out the window\nesfp the Entertainer next the esfp has\nsomewhat of the opposite problem with\nthe estp that is they think about other\npeople too much and not enough about\nthemselves they can become compulsive\npeople Pleasers because of their\nemotionally sensitive and conflict\naverse nature\nESTJ the executive dedicated and\nstrong-willed estj's main strengths lie\nin their direct logical and reliable\nnature but this can also be their\ndownfall if they run with it too far and\nbecome too inflexible close-minded and\njudgmental they're also notorious for\nbeing Workaholics who find it difficult\nto relax and express their true feelings\nisfj the defender warm and protective\nisfjs are all about making people happy\nand keeping the peace they value Harmony\nand tradition but at their worst they\ncan become extremely rigid in their\nviews and their support for authority\nfigures and the status quo reluctant to\nchange and too altruistic isfjs struggle\nto break tradition and rock the boat\neven when things clearly aren't working\nanymore istj the logistician responsible\ndutiful organized and practical istjs\nlove to create and enforce order so much\nso that their worst personality trait is\nbeing too much by the book their factual\ndecision making process makes them\nresistant to new ideas if it ain't broke\nwhy fix it and usually do not respect\npeople who are either willfully ignorant\nor too clouded by their own emotions to\nseparate facts from opinions\nESFJ the console\nthe ultimate people person and ESFJ\nfeels best when they have strong\nrelationships with others which makes\nthem empathetic leaders and\ncompassionate communicators at their\nworst however esfjs can use their Keen\nsense of awareness of other people's\nemotions to manipulate or bully them\nthey are also notorious for caring too\nmuch about their social status and\ninfluence and rarely stepping out of\ntheir own Comfort zones for fear of\nbeing too different\nENFP the campaigner enfps are known as\ntrue free spirit because of how outgoing\nopen-minded and enthusiastic they are\nabout life but these strengths can also\nbe weaknesses as it makes them unfocused\nand disorganized their Adventure is an\nidealistic nature also makes them\nRestless at times and easily\ndissatisfied with their life\ninfp the mediator\nwhat makes infps unique is also their\nmost fatal flaw their strong sense of\nidealism quiet and unassuming on the\noutside infps have a vibrant imagination\ndeep feelings and a strong sense of\npassion so much so that they often lose\nthemselves in Daydreams most of the time\nand tend to have two unrealistic of\nstandards for themselves and others in\nthis way infps are constantly setting\nthemselves up for disappointment and\nself-criticism ENFJ the protagonist one\nof the best things about enfjs is how\nempathetic and nurturing they are often\nour favorite mom friend they have a\nnatural talent for inspiring people and\nhelping them reach their potential but\nat their worst enfjs may hurt others in\nunintentional ways just to keep the\nharmony like ignoring important issues\nor pressuring others to live up to their\noverly idealistic standards infj The\nAdvocate similar to the ENFJ INFJs\nalways strive for perfection but their\nefforts are more directed inwards with\nthemselves than outwards so it's no\nsurprise then that their worst\npersonality trait is their toxic\nperfectionism and overthinking most\nINFJs struggle with analysis paralysis\nmeaning that they get in their heads too\nmuch that it often makes them get in\ntheir own way they become indecisive and\nstruggle to leave room for the beautiful\nmessiness and spontaneity of real life\nand imperfect people\nintj the architect\nalthough rational self-sufficient and\nextremely determined intjs who are too\nin touch with their thinking side and\nnot enough with their feelings side\noften come across to others as arrogant\ninsensitive overly critical and\ndismissive of others unhealthy intjs\nbelieve that they are superior to others\nand become aloof selfish and harsh\nbecause they think they have better\nthings to do than care about other\npeople's feelings all the time\nentj the commander entjs are nicknamed\nthe commander because they're\nnatural-born leaders although efficient\nstrong-willed and strategic thinkers\nentjs who aren't careful can become\ndomineering intolerant cold and ruthless\nthat's because unhealthy entjs no longer\ncare about how their words or decisions\naffect those around them as long as it's\nin pursuit of their own goals and their\nobsession with efficiency\nentp the debater at their best entps\nbalance a logical rational mentality\nwith an awareness of the needs of others\nenterprising witty and argumentative\nentps need to be careful not to seem\nlike they're uncaring and just arguing\nfor the sake of it they can also be\nunabashedly critical towards others for\nbeing inefficient and incompetent and in\ntimes of emotional crisis will give\nunsolicited advice instead of comfort\nINTP the logician because intps are so\nintellectual and independent they're\noften difficult to get close to and may\nstruggle to connect with others on a\ndeep emotional level\ntheir worst personality trait is that\nthey have a tendency to get so caught up\nin their own logic that they fail to\nshow others emotional consideration\nbecause of this
