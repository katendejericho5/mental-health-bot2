    "transcript": "the reason behind why humans behave\nselfishly generally falls into two camps\nthose who believe that selfishness is an\ninherent part of human nature and those\nwho think it's a chosen Behavior either\nway understanding our Tendencies towards\nself-centeredness can help us make more\nconscious choices improve our\nrelationships and build a better world\nafter all we all have a bit of\nselfishness in us so it's worth delving\ninto its Origins\noriginally the humanist side of egoism\nsaid that there was more to human\nchoices than selfish ambition-dominated\npopular opinion however in the late 20th\nand early 21st century the idea of\nself-centered Behavior became more\npervasive eocentric Theory traces back\nto Thomas Hobbes Leviathan which argued\nthat humans are inherently selfish but\nit was economic principles explained in\nThe Wealth of Nations that furthered and\ncemented the idea into the modern psyche\npublished in 1776 by Scottish Economist\nAdam Smith The Wealth of Nations\nintroduced us to pillars of modern\neconomic practices it also introduced\nthe idea that economic and general\nsocial welfare is created when Merchants\nact out of self-interest modern Commerce\nis not founded on kindness but rather on\nthe need to supply Necessities that are\nmore advantageous usually these choices\nbenefit the supplier more than the buyer\nhis theory coupled with Charles Darwin's\nfamous theory of Choice Evolution shaped\nmodern economy and Society into what we\nknow now through a clinical and purely\neconomic lens one can assume and assert\nthat humans are in fact completely\nselfish we are motivated by ambition and\nself-preservation\ntake for example the prisoner's dilemma\ntwo prisoners accused of crimes are\nplaced in different rooms and told if\nneither confesses both will serve light\nsentences three years\nif one confesses while the other remains\nsilent the one who confesses will go\nhome while the other will serve a heavy\nsentence 10 years and if both confess\nboth get moderate sentences five years\nneither prisoner has an idea what the\nother prisoner will do what would you do\nin that situation\nat first impulse many people would\noutright confess not realizing that they\ncould possibly end up with a five-year\nsentence but after further study\nresearchers noted that a pattern emerged\nwhen repeated players were paired Tit\nfor Tat or more eloquently said quid pro\nquo it was advantageous to collaborate\nand work together among repeated pairs\nof players up to a certain point the\nsame behavior is observed in\npost-apocalyptic movies a band of\nMisfits come together to fight off\nzombies until the group splits up\nhowever the question isn't how selfish\nare human beings but rather why why do\nwe act selfishly and is it more\nadvantageous to be selfish what do you\nthink\npsychologically speaking selfishness is\na perceived behavior in ourselves or\nothers that arises when we detect a\nSituation's specific desire to benefit\nthe self and disregard others desire\nwhen looking through this framework we\ncan understand that selfishness is a\nperceived Act\nit is a quick judgment based on a\nperceived cost-benefit analysis of a\nsituation\nif you take advantage of the situation\nyou are perceived as selfish and if you\ndon't you're perceived to be selfless\nalthough Society encourages egocentric\nbehaviors biology and psychology shows\notherwise many of your choices are not\njust created within your rational mind\nmany are shaped by your social cultural\nsphere your background culture friends\npersonal experiences and home\nenvironment but your brain structure\nalso influences them\nthe neuroplasticity of the brain as well\nas its Reward Center can influence how\nselfish or selfless our choices are\nresearchers San and gash found that the\nneural wiring for emotional processing\ndifferentiates a psychopath from an\naltruist or selfless person\nchoices and behaviors selfishness or\nselflessness are created in the\npro-social brain these behaviors are\nlearned through observation ingrained as\npart of who we are and changed depending\non who is on the receiving end for\nexample people tend to extend altruism\ntowards those who are closer to them can\nNora like friends interestingly enough\naltruistic behaviors were born out of a\nneed to survive the survival and success\nof large groups depended on the\nselflessness of each member additionally\nour own biology encourages these kinds\nof behaviors by releasing oxytocin to\nensure repetition of that behavior so\nhow can we distinguish selflessness and\nselfishness the key is to understand\npsychopathy\ndysfunction of emotional processing is a\ndefining characteristic of psychopathy\nStudies have shown that Psychopaths lack\nthe ability to recognize emotions in\nothers especially emotions like distress\nand fear this muted effect towards human\nemotions is what can drive selfish\nbehavior the neural network and wiring\nfor emotional processing is often\ndysfunctional in Psychopaths hence\nselfish behavior our understanding of\npsychopathy along with neural and\ngenetic factors can help us understand\nwhy humans are selfish additionally\nvarious studies add more factors to why\nwe humans are selfish one study points\nto a genetic variation of the oxytocin\nreceptor Gene while another study\nhighlights the role volume of the\nanterior cortex this neurological\nframework allows us to further\nunderstand that empathy and being able\nto recognize emotions in others is a key\nfactor as to whether we behave selfishly\nor selfishly altruism and egoism depend\non the level of empathy a person has\nalthough Society encourages egotistical\nbehaviors in the way that it celebrates\nbillionaires and materialism many of us\nare wired to be altruists because\nEvolution has shown us that group\ncooperation ensures the Rival and\nsuccess so the real question is why\ndoesn't Society commend altruism what do\nyou think are we all more selfish or\nselfless and which one is better comment\nbelow"
