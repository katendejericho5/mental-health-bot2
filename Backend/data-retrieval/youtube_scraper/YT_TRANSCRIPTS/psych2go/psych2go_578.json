the\ndopamine production line\nnumber seven try something new you know\nyou wanted to do that thing just\nthinking about doing it scares you a\nlittle but in a good way\ndoing something like that for the first\ntime can trigger a dopamine release the\nrelease is because our brains stop\nfinding familiar things challenging or\ninteresting so no reward is given you\ncertainly might feel comfortable but\nthat Spike of interest is gone\nlearning new things though that's\nexciting it's the novelty of the thing\nthat gives the dopamine reward and that\nRush attempt to try something new every\nday and little things count so try that\nrecipe you've been staring at or finally\nplay the intro to that game you haven't\nunwrapped yet it's new and it adds to\nyour brain's knowledge stores

the start of something\nbeautiful and productive number nine\ncold showers surprised\nyeah we know what some of you associate\ntaking a cold shower with we're not\ntalking about a date that ended in a\nless than Stellar way and also don't\ngive yourself hypothermic shock in a\npolar bear swim\nyou can start off with a warm shower and\nslowly decrease the temperature so that\nyou finish the shower cold\nthat coldness jolts your system so you\nfeel more alert you think clearer and\nhave happy hormones including dopamine\ngiven the green light to be released\neverything you need for get up and go to\ndeal with the shock\nand number 10. protein-rich food\nthat saying you are what you eat makes\nso much sense if you think about it food\ngoes in and gets digested and what's in\nit feeds your cells becoming well you\nso why not feed yourself things that\nencourage dopamine production\nthere's this amino acid called\nl-triazine that's key to that Blissful\nprocess and it's found in protein-rich\nfoods like chicken almonds and bananas\nbonus tip saturated fats junk foods and\nover oily eats actually throw a wrench\nin the dopamine production so even more\nreason to Chuck the chips Whoever\nthought there'd be ways to hack into\nhappiness well thanks dopamine\ndon't stress over these things though\nthey're here for you to try and starting\noff small is still starting so go
