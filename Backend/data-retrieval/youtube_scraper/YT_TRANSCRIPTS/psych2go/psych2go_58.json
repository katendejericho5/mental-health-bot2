    "transcript": "- Technology has changed our\nsociety and us drastically.\nIt has affected how you\nconnect, communicate, create,\nand interact with each other.\nSome of these changes\nhave been for the best\nand others for the worst.\nOne specific aspect of\ntechnology that has changed is\nhow we fall in love.\nBack then, falling in love was an art.\nIt involved romance mix tapes\nand poems written on\nnapkins in bad handwriting.\nNow it's a swipe or a text.\nThe romance of the past\nand many things along with it have died.\nLet's explore how modern\ndating has changed us.\nNumber one, gray areas.\nBefore dating apps and late\nnight suggestive texts,\npeople knew they were in a relationship.\nWhy? Well, aside from the love letters\nand loud public displays of affection,\ndating was pretty simple.\nThe person liked you, asked you on a date,\nand that was that meeting.\nFace-to-face made things personal,\nand as a result, people\nwere honest and upfront.\nThey couldn't hide behind\nan avatar status or text.\nPeople didn't have the veneer\nof social media to hide\nbehind, and as a result,\nyou knew if someone\nreally liked you or not.\nNowadays it's not so easy to tell.\nLife currently moves at\na blindingly fast pace,\nbut everyone seems comfortable\nwith the speed passively scrolling by.\nThis same attitude\nhappens in relationships,\npassive relationships\nthat aren't defined\nbecome situation ships,\nromantic relationships\nthat lack commitment.\nIt is a penumbra, a hypothetical\nthat is left unanswered\nand often without closure.\nNumber two, paradox of choice.\nModernity and technological\nadvancement have brought\nmany paradoxes.\nThe most obvious one is the endless means\nof achieving connection, but\nfew real honest connections.\nLoneliness is an epidemic\nthat affects all of us.\nFor those living in\ncities, it is greatly felt,\nbut loneliness can also\nexist in relationships.\nIronically, modernity has\nbrought us online dating\nand with it endless choices.\nYou can look for a potential\npartner within a 50 mile radius\nand find so many people who\nyou share similarities with,\nbut out of those many people,\nhow many do you actually\ncreate a connection with?\nIt's the paradox of choice.\nWhen given too many\noptions, you can't choose.\nYou make a choice under\npressure without taking\neverything into account.\nBack then, you were just dating\nthe person in front of you.\nThere wasn't a cue of potential suitors\nstanding behind your date.\nThere wasn't the pressure to make sure\nthat person was the right one.\nHowever, the endless options offered\nthrough online dating makes\nit difficult to choose someone\nbecause having an abundance\nof choice requires more\neffort to make a decision.\nThus, once we make our\nchoice, we feel unsatisfied.\nThese feelings can haunt\nand damage relationships\nbecause it makes it difficult\nto settle on a person\nand have the disposition to\nfoster a relationship with\nso many options.\nYou choose someone but end up feeling\nunsatisfied with your choice.\nYou start to imagine what the\nrelationship might be like\nwith that other person\nwhose profile you saw\nor what you should do if the current\nrelationship doesn't work out.\nNumber three, face-to-face.\nOnline dating, depending on the partner,\nrelies heavily on virtual\ncommunication if it's a long\ndistance relationship.\nMore so text messaging, FaceTime\nand chats rob you of the joy\nof having a face-to-face.\nConnection. Conversation\nis more than just the\nwords people exchange.\nIt's body language, tone, and feel.\nThey are nuances in a\nconversation that a camera\nor text message will not capture,\nand it is in these small\ngestures that you get\nto know someone better,\nlearn their habits and ticks.\nUnfortunately, the reduced\nface-to-face interaction can\nhinder the development of\nessential social skills\nand create disconnects between\nwhat a person is like in real\nlife and their online persona.\nNumber four, rise of me.\nSomething that modernity has\nprovided us with is privacy,\nwhile at least the illusion of it.\nSocial media helps us project\na version of who we are\nor who we would like to appear as.\nConsequently, we can\nhide behind the personas\nthat we create, but\nthis disconnect between\nwho we really are\nand who we appear to be has\ngiven free reign to our ego.\nTechnology makes it\neasier for people to hide\nwho they really are, so\nnow they care more about\nhow they look to others instead\nof just being themselves.\nMany of us care more about how we appear\nto others than just being ourselves\nbecause we seek approval via\ncriticism, compare ourselves\nto others, aim for success,\nand are influenced by media ideals.\nThis has become problematic,\nespecially in romantic relationships\nwhere honesty is important.\nIt has given rise to hookup culture, greed\nand self-sufficiency in relationships\nand other scenarios\nwhere people no longer seek\nromantic partners to share part\nof their lives with, but rather\nto fulfill specific needs.\nCommon examples include situation, ships,\nand one night stands.\nNumber five, trauma dumping.\nAnother testament to the\nrise in selfishness in\nrelationships is trauma.\nDumping trauma dumping occurs\nwhen someone inadvertently\nunloads their very personal\nemotional burden on the listener\nwithout consent or any\nconsideration for the listener.\nIn today's digital age, sharing online\nand getting quick support is\nmore accessible, which is good\nfor seeking help, but it's\nimportant to use the right places\nfor support, like support forums.\nIf we are not careful,\nwe might think it's okay\nto dump our emotional problems\non others like someone we're\njust starting to date without\nrealizing how it could affect them.\nThe act of compromising someone\nand involving them in\nyour trauma is a sign\nof a larger issue, such\nas a lack of boundaries\nor unhealthy coping mechanisms.\nWhile it may be difficult to walk around\nwith an emotional\nburden, that doesn't mean\nthat any other person has\nto be in charge of it.\nOnline interaction via social media\nand online dating has\nwithout a doubt challenged\nand altered our approach to\nconnection, relationships,\nand finding love.\nWhile technology has opened doors\nof opportunities for connection, and\n- It has also confronted us\nwith challenges both within\nthe technology itself\nand as a society, as\ntechnology continues advancing\nand society continues to\nembrace the advancements,\nwe must take a step\nback and be reflective.\nNavigate these new landscapes with caution\nand determination to figure out\nwhat will be the best course of action.\nNot just now for us,\nbut for generations to come\nin these new ever-changing\ntechnological terrains, we\nmust learn to find a balance\nto ensure that our desire for connection\nand growth remains fulfilling."
