    "transcript": "foreign\n[Music]\n[Music]\nthis video is a q a with breaks where\ntwo of my most favorite people will help\nme read your comments\nI brought them on board because I was\nnervous to read the comments the founder\nof psych2go asked if I would make a\nvideo going through all of your comments\non the last face reveal I\nam nervous so many eyes on me opinions\nto so many people I was sure there would\nbe\nevil nasty ugly comments\nbut there weren't\nI was met with so much love\nand acceptance and support and warmth\nyou're just so beautiful\nso hard sometimes most of the time to um\na faith in humanity\nbut next time I feel that way I'm gonna\ncome to the comment section I'll decide\nto go\nis it weird being on YouTube and having\na following\nso weird I'm just here by myself talking\nto a camera but this is gonna go live on\na channel that has almost 10 million\nsubscribers\nhumans\nyou know when I'm performing on stage I\ncan see the audience\num\nit's really weird dude this video took\nme forever to make and it is long so\nplease get comfortable grab a drink grab\nsome snacks I brought my mom and one of\nmy best friends to hold my hand as we\nread the comments which was entirely\nunnecessary but I'm glad they came and\nwe're all just gonna hang out for a\nwhile\nget cozy cuddle up and\nlet's do this\nhow and when did you find out what you\nwanted to do in life also do you ever\nget questions you've answered before and\nif so what do you think about them\num yeah definitely get repeat questions\nbut there are new use there there are\nnew people that are seeing this video or\nseeing me for the first time\num so repeating the questions the\nanswers to your questions is\nprobably a good thing if it's a great\nquestion then they missed the Q a last\ntime then they'll get the answer this\ntime\nhow and when did I find out what I want\nto do in life\nI well\nhave I figured out what I want to do in\nlife\num this that what I'm doing now is\npretty cool\nbut I want to do more\num from a kid from a kid from childhood\num I always wanted to dance and sing and\nbe a vet and um and act\num I always wanted to perform\nno no not so much perform I always\nwanted to create and be a part of\nart\num and then I just loved animals and I\nstill do\num but as I got a little bit older maybe\nlike six seven\nI started to become very interested in\npeople\nand pain I started to recognize how many\nunhappy people there were around me\nespecially adults\num\nunhappy in relationships unhappy in life\nunhappy in work and I was like\nuh I don't want that\nhow do I not do that how do I avoid that\nbut also like how do I make them feel\nbetter how do we all feel better like\nhow do we fix this\num and I you know I was I was I felt\nthings that I didn't love feeling and I\nwas like well how do I deal with that\nand if I figure it out how do I share\nthat\num so that was already happening\num inside from a very young age\nso uh rambling already\nso\neverything just kind of came together\nwhen I was like a kid I was in dance and\nlike modeling and acting and then\nas I got older\nI um I started singing more and going to\nlike home Studios and stuff\nand then a little while after that when\nI got tired of relying on other people\nto\nrecord me and help like and make music I\ntaught myself how to do those things\num home studio\nEtc so learning how to record myself and\nlearning how to\n[Music]\num\nhow to use my voice with a microphone\nfor music\nand um\nand you know acting classes and acting\nexperience I think that they all kind of\nlike Amalgamated they all kind of\naligned and came together and brought me\nhere\n[Music]\num\nbut there's\nuh does that answer your question the\npath that I thought that I was going to\nbe on and what I thought that I really\nwanted to do was\nbe a famous recording artist\nturns out I really don't have any\ninterest in Fame it actually terrifies\nme I love my privacy as um oxymoronic as\nthat may seem as I'm here\nsharing it all with the world but um\n[Music]\nZoe Addison\nhonestly I'm not disappointed at all\nyou're exactly what I imagined a nice\nand wholesome person with a beautiful\nvoice\nwholesome that's right wholesome\nI am very wholesome I'm a wholesome of\nme\nI shouldn't try to make jokes because\nthey do not land\nI'm the whole sum of me\nsomeone gets my jokes\nquick disclaimer while I have you I\nAmanda Silvera I'm just a narrator on\nthis channel the psych2go is made up of\nso many people that are necessary to\nmake this channel what it is we have\nYouTube managers writers narrators\nanimators and they all deserve so much\ncredit I see a lot of confusion\nsometimes about this being my channel\nit's not unless we look at it like it's\nour Channel and then\nit's mine and it's yours and it's theirs\nand you know\nso yeah I have no idea what I'm gonna\nget until I open the script and read it\nI have no idea what the final product is\ngonna look like I have no say over these\nthings I am not a licensed therapist or\npsychologist\nand I just I really need that to be\nclear\nwhat strategies or tips do you have for\novercoming trauma not expecting\ntherapist level answers just think it\nwould be nice to hear from you\nhuh\nstrategies or tips for overcoming trauma\nI'm not sure that trauma is something\nthat you overcome\nwow yeah so\nfor me\num and my\ntraumas\nwhen I went through them I went numb and\nthen I kind of just like denied them for\nyears\nand that seemed to be kind of just like\nwhat I what that seems to be kind of\nwhat I do something traumatic happens\nwhile it's happening I go numb so that I\ncan like get through it and then um\nand then I do this thing where I'm like\nwell it's over so it shouldn't matter\nanymore\nbut I I I understand more now\num and it just doesn't work that way\nthere are things that happen that that\nneed to be addressed and processed\nand as you do that I think that\nthe process of healing\nfrom a traumatic experience experience\num\nI feel like it creates this new\nstronger version of yourself this\nthis more complex being\nthrough those traumas and those\nexperiences and then what happened to\nyour body and mind\nduring that and then figuring out how to\ngo into those places that have changed\nand nurture them and communicate with\nthem and um\nand find a way to process in a new way\nthat works for you\nafter all of that\num\nit turns you into I feel like it's like\nit's a level up it turns you into a new\nand improved version of yourself but\nthe trauma is there\npart of part of the process is accepting\nthat the trauma is there\nso uncomfortable and it's so painful\nsometimes and a lot of people don't want\nto do it because of that\nand a lot of people don't do it because\nof that\nbut um counseling is great therapy is\ngreat\num\nCommunity is great talking to\num other people who may have gone\nthrough a similar experience maybe like\non\nReddit or here on YouTube or just\nfinding communities online\nbut yeah the word overcoming feels just\na little bit off for me\nI think just being\nas self-aware as possible and as gentle\nwith yourself as possible\nis really important\nand not rushing yourself because it's a\nlong process\nI didn't attempt to try\nto heal for\num I don't know 10 years\nso yeah\nI wish you\nI wish you the best of luck\nand I'm sending love\nhave you thought about doing audiobooks\nbecause I could listen to you all day\nuh yeah I have I don't know if I should\ntell you this\num so on my channel there is an attempt\nthere's a free audiobook it's called\nNancy of paradise Cottage and\nso when I started reading it I didn't\nknow how many characters were going to\nbe involved I didn't know what I was\ngetting into and\num\nit started off with just women so I was\ndoing like\na younger sister the main character the\nmom\nbut then more characters came in so I\nwas doing like an elderly woman's voice\nand like men\nit got tough I stopped I had to stop but\num it's\nif anything it's entertaining I added\nsound effects I added the sound of horse\nHooves and like fire crackling and\nchatter at the ball and music and\nyeah yeah so that exists as far as\naudiobooks go they're a lot of work and\nif I'm not paid what what I need to be\npaid in order to make it worthwhile then\nI probably won't do it\num unless something you know I find a\nbook that I really just want to read and\nshare\nI can't believe I told you this like I\nkind of wanted to just make it private\nbut\nwhatever\num\nwhat is your perspective or thought\nprocess when you feel anxious or\nemotionally overwhelmed\nhow do you cope with that\nand are there any self-affirmations or\nbeliefs that you use to help work\nthrough them\nI so when I'm anxious like right now\num it's good to\nstop\nbreathe\nthere's um a certain breathing technique\ncalled the physiological Psy\nso you take a deep breath and then when\nyou're when you get the full Breath You\nsip like you suck up just a little bit\nmore\nand then you let it out\num and that automatically calms your\nnervous system look it up because I'm\nnot gonna try to explain it and give you\nthe wrong information\nbreathing is breathing is key\nwhat else was that what was in the\nquestion I've just like gone into zen\nState just just like that see how\npowerful it is\num when you feel anxious or emotionally\noverwhelmed\nhow do you cope with that and are there\nany self-affirmations or beliefs\nyeah\num yeah it's not that easy\num\nsometimes I I can't sometimes I'm very\nvery bad at that\nif I am emotionally overwhelmed and I'm\nnoticing that I'm spiraling ruminating\ngoing into negative thinking and just\nkind of\nnot\nif I'm just if I\nif I catch myself there\nI check on myself am I hungry am I tired\ndo I need water\num is it my environment\nthose things are relatively easy fixes\nand a lot of the time they are huge\ncontributors\num\nand then there is another tool that my\ntherapist suggested I try\nand I'm giving a shout out right now\nand it's creating almost like an alter\nego like like a character that you can\nstep into when you're not feeling\nso secure in yourself kind of like just\nthe best version\nof yourself the version that you would\nlove to be\num\nso what I've done is I wrote down all of\nher traits\num what people feel like when they're\nwith her what she feels like when she\nenters a room how she walks how she\ntalks\num\nhow she got there\num writing qualities about myself that I\npossess\nthat I would like to bring out more and\num\nand then I gave her a name I'm not going\nto tell you that's just for me but\nyou create this\nI don't know if you've heard Beyonce\ntalk about Sasha Fierce and who that is\nfor her and what that is for her but\nI make one of those I've made one of\nthose and I've been stepping into her\num\na lot this week\nnot as much as I would like to but it's\na matter of like\nrecognizing when I sorry recognizing\nwhen when I need her instead of just\nlike letting the overwhelm and the\nstress and the\nnasty thoughts take over\n[Music]\nso yeah I hope that helps\nwith my mother and she does have a\nlovely voice she really does have a\nlovely voice well you know what she gets\nleft from her her gene pool her\ngrandmother\n[Music]\nwell no I don't think my voice is\nparticularly beautiful\nbut your mom my mother's my mother was\num\na radio announcer and producer director\nof educational television in Jamaica and\nshe had an incredible voice now she did\nthink I had a good voice too because\num\nno I guess a lot of people like my voice\nwe find it soothing but Amanda Amanda\nhas a lovely soothing voice and um you\nknow when she was a little girl\npeople constantly said to her you are so\ncute you're so beautiful and I used to\nconstantly myself say to her you know\ndarling it's really important I hope\nyou'll know that it is far more\nimportant to be beautiful inside\nwell not more important but it's equally\nas important to be beautiful on the\ninside not just on the outside\nit's like a rose with no scent you know\nit's like a beautiful woman with no\nbrains to me\nand you know they bred these roses now\nthat there are very few that have a\nscent anymore\n[Music]\noh Amanda's nickname for me is the long\nand Winding Road\nit is yours who's whose was it\nyou are the one that called me a long\nand Winding Road\nyeah I do tend to expand a lot so I\napologize ahead of time\noh okay so let me see the next one\nthat touches my heart\nyou should comment on the comments\nher voice is like therapy and she's\nabsolutely beautiful\n[Music]\nthank you so much for everything Amanda\nyour videos have helped me so much I\ndidn't do that one right oops I've lost\nI've lost the comments so they're all\ngone oh dear I don't know where I am\nanymore you're gonna have to find it for\nme can you do that for me please\nyou know technology boy\nthere's truthful real emotion behind\nyour voice that gets\nthat was to preface my question\nwhat do you think about the most when\nyou sing to get that emotion to come\nthrough thanks for listening and\nreplying to Weirdos like me I'm a weirdo\ntoo\num but it's my pleasure to reply and\nramble\nuh\nI love that you love I love that you\nlove my voice\nespecially my singing voice because\nmusic is so important to me and\nit's uh it's not in my world as much as\nI would like it to be right now\nso that kind of like motivates me\nah\nwhat do I do to get there\nwhat do I think about the most\na lot of the time when I make music I\ntry not to think at all and just let\nwhatever wants to come Out Come to Me\nit's a chance for me to kind of sit with\nmyself and see what's going on like in\nthe back don't let that come out\n[Music]\nso what gets me there is\nis just what's already there what's\nalready inside and has been waiting to\nBubble up and come out\n[Music]\num a lot of my songs especially songs\nthat sound like love songs are actually\nto myself there's a song on the um the\nEP I haven't uh an EP called the yasley\nAP yasley stands for you or something\nlike you or you or someone like you\nand there's a song on it called Need You\nNow\nand uh that is a song to me it was about\ncoming back to myself like\nI had been\nescaping and avoiding\nexisting for quite some time\nand it was about it was about calling\nmyself back to me\num\nand a lot of my songs are like that\nsongs where I write about wanting love\nor needing love it's\nit's about wanting me to love me\nand needing to figure out how to\nto see me\num the way\nthe way others\nsay they see me I get so much so much\nlove here\num\nand I struggle\nI don't want to say it and have it sound\nlike I don't appreciate it\nbut I struggle to feel it sometimes\nand that's just that's due to\nmy own stuff and my own history\nso\na lot of the work that I have to do is\num\nit's it's just in loving me\num seeing me\nclearly\nand that work just like the trauma work\nbecause it is trauma work\num\nit's very uncomfortable and it's very\npainful and um and that's that's what\nwhat's coming out in the music\nare you interested in doing other voice\nstunts such as voice acting or\naudiobooks uh yeah I mean I love all\nvoice things was like to go I get to do\nlike character voices sometimes and with\nit's like to go and also like my\npersonal projects I get to I'm playing\naround playing around with a lot of\nthings I love it all and I'm also\nworking on other projects that I would\nlove to tell you about and I will\neventually\n[Music]\num no audiobooks yet but I'm I'm doing\nsome pretty cool boy stuff\nand I'm open to all of it\nnext how do you stop worrying about\nsomething that isn't even worth a word\nman if I knew if I knew\num hold on\none sec\nthis is like my biggest problem I\nI don't know\num\nhow do you stop worrying about something\nthat isn't even worth worrying about yet\nit still affects you in a way that makes\nyou nervous inside and mentally unstable\nwhen you're going through\nday-to-day life\n[Music]\nI I know it's why why logically we know\nthat we shouldn't be thinking about\nthese things we know\nand we go brain hello I'm the boss here\nyou are my brain I tell you what to do\nno\nit's not how it works does it\nI feel like it could be with enough\nhealing but uh\n[Music]\nwhat have I learned how have I because\nI've been I've been um I've been dealing\nwith I deal with that all the time\nI was gonna say I was dealing with it\nthis week or last week but like\nthere's always a little bit of it\nhappening in my head at all times\nI think\nI think one thing\nthat um I try to do or that might help\nyou is\nto sit with it\nwhatever the thought is\ninstead of kind of trying to push it\naway and push it away it's like I feel\nlike the more you push the more that it\ntakes the more hold it has on you and\nthe more space it takes up in your mind\num if you just kind of accept that it's\nthere and maybe\num maybe Journal\nmaybe write down what this scary thing\nis write down the worst case scenario\num\nno because we know it's not even a big\ndeal\nbut still yeah it's almost like having a\nnightmare you know when you tell someone\nabout it or you write it down\nit's less likely that it'll come back\nmaybe with those types of thoughts if we\nwrite it down\nor share it with someone or kind of just\nreally break it down and look at it\nit'll be easier for us and our brains to\nbe like okay this isn't this isn't worth\nit there are so many other things to\nthink about maybe\num\nI wish that I had an answer for you\nman I wish I did\nDana vixen\nhey Amanda hope all is well\ndo you believe in soul ties\nI've moved on tremendously from the\nperson I used to be\nas well as from the friends I had 20\nyears ago\nhowever one in particular has been on my\nmind consistently I'm wondering why\nit feels like a soul connection\n[Music]\nI don't know if I believe in soul ties\nbecause the more I learn\nI don't know if it's learned\nthe more I live the more I feel like\nthese connections or not connections\nthese emotions and these feelings\nand these like repetitive thoughts\nthey're all about us\num\nwhat is it about this person that you\nkeep thinking about\nwhat were they to you at that time who\nwere you at that time is there a reason\nor is there work that you still have to\ndo\num\nthat is connected to something there it\ncould be an unfinished business\nsituation with yourself\nthat is actually the reason why you're\ngoing there\nbut who am I I don't know it could very\nwell be a soul tie\num\nAlyssa hey Alyssa how has taking a break\nfrom social media been do you often\nthink about it when you're off it yeah\nI'm still fully addicted to social media\num I'm back on kind of but I'm not I'm\nnot really looking at the DMS and\nmessages\nbecause that's where the real like\nanxiety comes from\nI feel much better without it the longer\nI go without it the more\nconnected to me I feel the more focused\nI feel the more productive I feel the\nmore balanced I feel\nso yeah it's definitely a good thing\nbut I'm definitely addicted to it and\nI'm\nsure the majority of us are and don't\neven know it or maybe we do know it\num but when I was committed to being off\nof it\nit got really good it sucked at first\nit's very uncomfortable\num\nbut then it got pretty good\nand I don't know when I started like\ncreeping back in\n[Music]\nbut but I did and I'm back\nand I think I'm ready to be gone again\nso thank you for for that\nhave you ever whoa\nthis is okay\nhave you ever dealt with trauma-induced\naddiction such as\na behavior-based addiction things that\nmight be not as good for you when doing\nthem frequently but feel so good at the\nmoment just to regret it afterwards\nyeah yeah I'm sure a lot of us can\nrelate to that\nfood alcohol I think those are the two\nfood weed alcohol I think those three\nare like the most common\nthere are there are many many more\nuh\nyeah from a young age I've\nI look at those as avoidant\num\navoidant behaviors or\nor tools\nand they all made it so much worse and\nso much harder to heal\nbut\nit was all I knew and it was all I had\nthe strength for at the time so if it's\nsomething that you are trying to\novercome\nah\ntry not to beat yourself up too much\nthere's a lot of guilt that comes with\nthe Escape methods\nyou feel gross after you beat yourself\nup\ndepending on what it is that you choose\nyou can hurt other people too\n[Music]\nreally tough it's really really tough\nand it's like\nwhat if that's all you have though at\nthe time like what if that's all you\nknow what if you don't have the\nresources or you're just so broken that\nyou don't have the energy\nto find the resources even if they are\navailable\nand then it becomes a cycle and you keep\ndoing it\nand\neverything just keeps getting worse\nI know all about it\nand I also know that\nI could not begin my healing Journey\nuntil I\ngave it up\ngive them up\nthe things that I turned to\num\nand it's hard because they become like\nyour best friend your only friend it's\nthe only thing that gives you some sort\nof relief\nfrom the pain and from your mind\nbut it's so short-lived\nand with um\nwith the good tools and the good methods\nand the good behaviors\nyou get ah you get long much longer\nstretches of peace\nbut it does take work\nand it takes discomfort\nwhen I decided that I was\num I was just gonna not run away from my\nfeelings\nthe first couple of months were\nexcruciating I couldn't I couldn't sleep\nI could not make my mind just shut up\nso many thoughts so many feelings that I\nhad avoided just all came at once I will\ncry myself to sleep every night\nand it was so much that I didn't even\nknow where to begin if I if I were to\ntell someone or talk to someone that\nwould too it was just too much\nso I was just alone in my feels\nand it sucked\nand after the first month or two things\nstarted to feel a little different I\nstarted to\nsee things differently like literally\nlike visually see things differently\nand\nI was so proud\nbecause when you look back at all of\nthat pain and suffering that you've just\nbeen through like you can't help but be\nproud of yourself\nand you should be\nreally feel for anyone that's going\nthrough that\nokay\nuh\num next if you've done 16 personality\ntests which one did you get I don't know\nif I have I probably have but I don't\nremember it's weird though some of you\nknow my some of you know my what's it\ncalled what's it called the\nBriggs Myers-Briggs I'm seeing people\ntalking about my my\nsign it's not my sign my Myers-Briggs\npersonality type and like I don't even\nremember it most of the time and I'm\nseeing you guys answering questions like\nsomeone asks what it is and then someone\nelse answers and tells them what I am\nand I'm like oh yeah that's what I am\nit's wild you guys\nit's so crazy to me to see but cool\ncool\nwith Mom\nwhat the\noh well that's what they're saying WTF\ncan I say WTF\noh hi where are you going\nare you gonna sit on my shoulder are you\nkidding me you think you're a cat\ngood gracious me well one of the reasons\nI suggested to Amanda that maybe I could\nhelp her with this was because she had\ntold me that so many people are confused\nabout her Origins whether she's black\nwhite or whatever so I said well maybe\nif they met me it might help but it also\nstrikes me it might be more confusing\nI married a white Jamaican man and his\nHeritage is from Portugal his mother was\nan adopted white child from Washington\nDC I believe and she was brought up by a\nblack woman in the countryside of\nJamaica that's a whole story in itself\nafter Amanda's father and I gave birth\nto our two children\nAmanda came out as Fair as Amanda is and\nher brother came out a little darker but\nmy father typical Jamaican man had dark\nbrown eyes and both my brothers and I\ngot brown eyes so it was it was\ninteresting to have two children with\nbeautiful colored eyes\nyou know it's a wonderful thing to be\nunique\nin our world\non the one hand we want to be unique but\nthen on the other hand we all want to\nfit in so it's like you're in a constant\nfight ridiculous ridiculous\nanyway I think that's sufficient don't\nyou\nyeah okay I like this one you are\nbeautiful your voice is calming me with\na whenever I'm not feeling okay you\nnever disappoint us we love you as you\nare and for who you are keep fighting\nand thank you\nyeah\nit must be very hard to control your ego\nwith all these comments\nno I just automatically go into imposter\nsyndrome\noh\n[Music]\nyou know when someone gives you a\ncompliment and you don't feel like you\ndeserve it\n[Music]\nyeah that's called imposter syndrome\nit's more complicated than that but\nsays dude I'm just an O I never knew\nthere was a face reveal prior to this\none and you were the person I least\nexpected to do a face reveal you have a\nbeautiful voice but damn you have a\nbeautiful face too this is from Dean\nGustin\nI cannot stress how much this channel\nhas helped me and how this channel has\nbecome my comfort place so thank you so\nmuch\noh\nI love those ones yeah it means you're\nlike a nice soft pillow for people to\nput their heads on when they're feeling\nheavy and burdened\nisn't that a nice concept\n[Music]\nyeah you don't think it's nice to think\nof yourself as a big pillow\nnext what goals and aspirations do you\nwish to accomplish in this lifetime\nand also what motivates you to\naccomplish that goals\nokay so first I'll go to the what\nmotivates you to accomplish that goals\num\npain\ndiscomfort I\nwhat motivates me is all of the things\nI've felt\nand then thinking about all of the\nthings that other people feel and how\ncomplicated and wild this world is and\njust the want to\nto know more\nand\nand to want to like make sense of it or\nmake the pain have a purpose but then\nalso\nwow\nI don't know I don't know I don't know\nit started\nit started I think and this has always\njust been a thing like from when I was a\nkid\nif I hurt or if I feel something\nunpleasant I know that someone else has\nand probably in a much worse way and\nI want to make them feel better\nit's just a thing that's in me\num\nI want to figure out how to make them\nfeel better or how to turn it into a\npositive how to take that and and just\nget stronger and grow\nso um\nthat has led me to want to know more\nabout neuroscience and psychology and\nbiology and\nphysics and Science and\nthe world just you know everything about\nexisting here\num drives me\num\nand then what goals and aspirations do I\nwant to accomplish\nI just want to make a positive\ndifference\num and I know that you I know that I\nhave\nbut\nit just doesn't feel like enough and I\ndon't think it ever will so yeah I just\nwant to do more but I also want to do\nmore creative stuff\nyou know I wanna I wanna I wanna book a\nrole where I get to go to the studio on\na regular basis and be a really cool\ncharacter that I love that I get to step\ninside and become for a while I want to\nbe able to do that for a while because I\nlove it so much and I've I've only had\nsamples I would love to have some more\num\nand I would love to travel and meet more\npeople and see more of this planet\nwhere am I from I love your voice a lot\nit's so peaceful and sweet\nI am first generation Canadian my mom\nand dad are both from Jamaica\nand I am from Vancouver British Columbia\nand thank you for the compliment\nwhoa you're still here\nI'm impressed I have so much more\nfootage with Alicia and my mom and\nanswering your questions\nbut I think I should wrap it up here if\nyou'd like to see the extended version\nhop over to my channel it'll be there in\na while I still have to edit it\n[Music]\n[Music]\nand if you have\nhahaha\nI'm gonna I'm gonna turn down
