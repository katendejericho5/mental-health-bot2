    "transcript": "the magical thing about having finite\ntime on Earth is that we get to exist at\nthe same time as the people we love\nwhether they're friends family or\nsomeone really special who you love\nromantically\nbut sometimes these people aren't in our\nlives for very long people move they\npass away or maybe a relationship ends\nsuddenly\nbut sometimes the end comes much slower\nas you mature and grow you don't even\nrealize that it's leading to the end of\nthe relationship one day you might think\nabout the relationship whether it's with\nfriends or a partner and think\nhave I outgrown them\nnow that you've found yourself watching\nthis video we're here to ask a few\nquestions that might help you figure\nthis out\nis the spark still there\nintimacy and affection will waver over\nthe course of a relationship so don't be\ndiscouraged just yet that's natural as\ncouples therapist Dr Bruce tallmer\nexplains in his book reigniting The\nSpark why stable relationships lose\nintimacy and how to get it back\nrelationships can end by fire or ice\nlet's take a look at what a\nrelationship's death by Ice would look\nlike according to Bruce Chalmer\nbasically the passion behind the\nrelationship has died arguments aren't\neven worth having anymore sexual\nintimacy has dried up things between you\nand your partner have become dreary and\npredictable Dr Chalmer goes on to say\nthat if this problem isn't addressed you\nwill end up feeling alone miserable and\nunfulfilled the solution is to restore\ncommunication and seek intimacy\nbut the root cause may be that you are\nbeginning to outgrow your partner\nPetty arguments aren't worth it anymore\nyou don't feel attracted to them like\nyou used to but if you aren't convinced\nask yourself\ndo you still share the same goals our\nDirection in life is bound to change as\nwe discover more about ourselves and\nfind new things we're passionate about\nour goals change with us for example in\nrelationships the relationship might\nhave started with an understanding that\nneither of you want kids\nover time you might have grown to\nrealize that you actually would like to\nhave children eventually\nthis is something to discuss as soon as\nyou realize this change in yourself\nbecause there is a limit to how long you\ncan go without discussing it this also\nisn't something that either partner can\nbe asked to compromise on\npsychologist Judith garer and colleagues\npublished a study in the Journal of\nresearch and personality they found that\nthis can be fatal for the relationship\nbut also found that your effective\nwell-being which is how often you\nexperience positive emotions or Good\nMoods is positively impacted by sharing\ngoals with your partner if you feel like\nyou've lost your sense of self and are\nnot sure what your goals are outside of\nyour relationship\nmaybe you should ask yourself are you\nbecoming or are you already codependent\naccording to Medical news today in its\nsimplest terms a codependent\nrelationship is when one partner needs\nthe other partner who in turn needs to\nbe needed the circular relationship is\nthe basis of what experts refer to when\nthey describe the cycle of codependency\nit's nice to know that you have someone\nyou can rely on but it's important to\nremember that you can do things on your\nown you should still feel like you can\nmake decisions that affect the\nrelationship while in a relationship you\nshould still be aware of who you are and\npursue the things that you enjoy\nclinical psychologist Mimi bommersbach\nand colleagues found that there is a\nrelationship between codependency and\npower if you feel like your partner is\nmaking all of the decisions or none of\nthem there is an imbalance in power this\ncan indicate that one of you is\noutgrowing the other interestingly the\nstudy also found that this issue affects\nboth men and women alike are you in\ndifferent transitional stages transition\ncan mean a lot of things going from high\nschool to university is a transition\nmoving away is also a transition there\nare also transitions that happen inside\nof us as we learn more about ourselves\nand become different people from who we\nwere for example a year ago authors\nWilliam and Susan Bridges came up with\nthe bridges transition model which\nidentifies three phases these are the\nending the neutral zone and the new\nbeginning the ending could be finishing\nschool or moving out the neutral zone is\nonce you've moved out or found a new job\nbut you aren't fully adjusted the new\nbeginning is actually what it sounds\nlike you finally made a new group of\nfriends or started that new job and\nyou've gotten to know everyone\nwhen there are differences between you\nand your partner stages in life it can\ncreate a rift if you need to move on but\nyour partner doesn't want to or if your\nAmbitions disrupt what they are\ncomfortable with at the moment it could\nlead to conflict\nit seems like an inevitable end you\ncan't compromise on the fact that you\nare changing so what can be done a\nsolution offered by William and Susan\nBridges is communication learn how to\ntalk about what you're feeling and your\nconcerns and identify what aspects of\nyour life is changing\nit is sad but also natural that\nsometimes the person you're with just\nwon't be interested in the transition\nthat you are undergoing\nall of this ultimately indicates one\nthing you are outgrowing the\nrelationship and the solution of\ncommunication might not work for\neveryone because you still have to ask\nyourself\nare you feeling burnt out as we get\nolder and our attention becomes divided\nwe should be excited to have some free\ntime to spend with our partners clinical\nsociologist Rula alsawalka explains that\nburnout becomes more likely as the\ncouple ages and can be caused by\nCollective and individual problems such\nas emotional fatigue work exhaustion and\na failure to fulfill the requirements of\ntheir marital relationship especially\nthe emotional requirements this isn't\nthe same as losing interest or\nattraction towards your partner this is\nfeeling genuinely drained when around\nthem your partner makes things more\nexhausting for you instead of making\nlife more tolerable finally we return to\nDr Bruce Chalmer and how the fire style\nof Destruction will destroy your\nrelationship\naccording to Dr Bruce your relationship\nwill become a war zone constant\narguments broken up by a few moments of\nTruth can leave you feeling burnt out if\nyou're arguing with your partner often\nbe honest with yourself and take\nresponsibility for the fights that you\nstart this way of living is extremely\nunhealthy and is a culmination of all of\nthe problems we've discussed in this\nvideo if you've tried communicating your\nconcerns with your partner and you still\nfeel like there's a disconnect between\nthe two of you maybe you've outgrown the\nrelationship it's sad to say goodbye to\nsomeone especially when you've been\ntogether for a long time but letting go\nof someone is part of the process of\ngrowing sometimes in order to fully\nrealize our potential we need to leave a\nrelationship\nif you found these questions helpful let\nus know in the comments remember to\nleave a like on the video and subscribe\nto see more videos like this if you're\nstruggling with a relationship that you\nfeel like you have outgrown remember to\ncommunicate with your partner you might\nfind that they feel the same way and you\ncan find a solution or move on to\nsomething that is healthier for both of\nyou we genuinely hope that this has been\nhelpful\nthen remember you matter"
