    "video_title": "The Truth About Domestic Violence with Clinical Director, Danielle Holtjer Ep 1",
    "transcript": "all right in three two one action\nall right so we're here sitting here\nwith uh Danielle holtcher uh who is a\nregistered clinical counselor and the\nfounder of Skylar Counseling Clinic here\nin Vancouver uh Daniel thank you so much\nfor being here with us today yeah you're\nwelcome thank you for having me no thank\nyou of course so we've already had a\nconversation already but I would like to\nask you to tell us a little bit more\nabout your background not just in the\ntopic that we're going to be talking\nabout today which is in domestic\nviolence but also just your general\nbackground please yes yeah absolutely so\nmy love for counseling started off in my\nundergrad actually in neuroscience and I\nwasn't having too good of a time and I\nreached out to a counselor and it was\nnot a very good experience so I I think\nfrom that really\num\nhave this love and passion for you know\nfighting mental health stigma for\nproviding good counseling services and\nensuring that other people don't have an\nexperience like that\nduring that time I just wanted to be\nsurrounded by kindness and warmth and so\nI started working at a crisis line here\nin Vancouver for sexual assault and it\nwas lovely it really opened my eyes to\nwhat's like really good quality support\nlooks like and from there it just my\ncareer kind of took off I started\nworking with the police with victim\nservices\nand then I did my Master's in counseling\npsychology where I actually worked a bit\nin India as a couples counselor for\narranged marriages that had extreme\ndomestic abuse in them so and then fast\nforward coming back to Vancouver I\nworked for the health authority in\nsubstance use and addictions so there\nwas a lot of domestic violence\nintegrated in that as well and that led\nme to here to Skylark in private\npractice and seen all sorts of clients\nand populations and helping people with\ndifferent concerns and work with a team\nof amazing counselors so yeah so what\nled you to India so that's that's kind\nof like it's really cool that you were\noriginally in Canada and then you moved\nyour way to India and then you came back\nhere like what was the reason behind\nthat yeah I think I wanted you know an\nexperience that was so different from\ngrowing up in the Okanagan growing up\nhere in BC\num and it just the culture and thought\nreally spoke to me so the people there\nwere so lovely and warm and welcoming\nand there was an opportunity for uh\nsupporting a team there and I just kind\nof jumped on it and uh yeah the rest is\nhistory so that's pretty wonderful\nthat's awesome so um we we'll start\njumping into talking about domestic\nviolence as well so um again this is not\nan easy topic to talk about so um we\nwant to make sure that we um stay\nsensitive like toward um people who may\nbe like you know going through this\nright now um so we'll start with\ndomestic violence in terms of different\ntypes so\num in your professional experience\num what are the different types of\ndomestic violence other than just a\nphysical violence yeah yeah absolutely\nso there's physical there's emotional\nthere's sexual there's Financial there's\nverbal so those and physical as well\nlike you mentioned so those Encompass uh\nall the types of domestic violence\nSo speaking of verbal as well so you\nmentioned verbal so that's the part that\nalways confuses me here so from what I\nunderstand is that there is a difference\nbetween healthy conflict versus verbal\nabuse but we know that you know not\neverything it has to be categorized into\nsomething like verbal abuse so what is\nthe line between let's say verbal abuse\nand healthy conflict yeah that's a great\nquestion abuse is a destructive pattern\nof maltreatment so if someone loses\ntheir temper once and says the wrong\nthing like you say it's we all make\nmistakes that's conflict uh it might not\nbe ideal healthy conflict but I think\nthe concern is where it starts to\ndisintegrate one's identity or someone's\nneeds so it really is a more profound\nlong-term and usually with domestic\nviolence it's not just one type so it\nmight be emotional and verbal and\nphysical all at the same time or all at\ndifferent times so they really overlap\nin that way right okay so it's not just\none thing just because somebody said\nthis once yeah it wouldn't be considered\na verbal abuse necessarily but if the\npattern continues over and over it could\npotentially be labeled as domestic\nviolence or even verbal abuse yeah\nexactly okay thank you um we also want\nto ask a little bit in terms of so what\nare some common myths about domestic\nviolence and the reason why I ask this\nis because again like in my mind\ndomestic violence is caused by a male\nfigure toward a female figure and I'd\nlike to ask is that always true and if\nnot like what are some different common\nmyths that people may have about\ndomestic violence yeah absolutely I\nthink you know one of the main myths\nthat I hear a lot is that like you say\nit's a certain type of population and\nthat's not the case\num it's everyone could be anybody at\ndifferent times different days different\nmonths uh and and so I really think\nthat's what makes it tough to Define is\nbecause there is such a diversity of\nfolks that are impacted by it\num some of the Mists like you\nhighlighted are that you know it's\nalways men again not the case\num you know or that there's nothing that\nwe can do about it\num or that there you know people can't\nchange I hear that a lot\num so there's often like ageist beliefs\nas well that if you know people are\nolder or younger or there's children\ninvolved like all of that it's really\num specific I think Case by case right\nokay so we shouldn't we should never\njust assume that it should be just one\nperson doing it to another where it's it\nshouldn't be a stereotype a stereotypes\nexactly right yeah okay so I'd like to\nask a little bit more about you were\nsaying something about change so it's\nvery easy in my opinion to demonize one\nperson and label them as he's an abuser\nhe's an evil person or they're an evil\nevil person so\num I'd like to ask a little bit more\nabout that is it true that we can label\nsomeone as\num he's an abuser and there's no room\nfor a change or in your professional\nexperience do you think there may be\nroom for improvement especially if they\nhave like shame and guilt about what\nthey had gone through yeah absolutely\nabsolutely you know I I have had clients\nthat are you know 60 plus a 90 year old\nclient actually\num and people that wanted support with\nuh substance use for example so they\nperhaps were drinking a lot their whole\nentire life and that at certain points\nin time they're they're just done and\nthey want to change and so I really do\nbelieve that at any time people can\nreach out and make huge huge changes in\ntheir life so yeah how long does that\nusually take because I feel like it's\nnot like a one day like I'm all of a\nsudden a better person all of a sudden\nbut rather it doesn't sound like an easy\nprocess how does it like usually work\nyeah yeah I think sometimes it could be\na stemming from an event\num so if you know the police are\ninvolved somebody might really kind of\nhave their eyes opened\num and change change overnight in that\nway way but I would say the majority of\ntime it is it is a process we all make\nmistakes and especially if we have a\ncertain pattern in our mind or\ndifficulty with emotional regulation it\ntakes a lot of work and a lot of time to\nlearn new coping skills and strategies\nso again it depends per person but I\nthink honestly if there's there's a will\nthere's a way yeah yeah well speaking of\ndifferent coping methods is it always\nrecommended that people who want to\nimprove themselves always seek the help\nof a mental health care professional or\nis it something that they can be doing\nwithout the help of a mental health care\nprofessional yeah yeah absolutely I\nthink it depends on the person honestly\num there there are people that I think\nthe benefit of the internet these days\nyou know you can find so much absolutely\nyou know with social media and just\nreally kind of deep diving into some of\nthe resources available I think where\ncounseling comes into play is it makes\nthat process more efficient of course so\npeople might be able to get from A to B\nby themselves but with a mental health\nprofessional that kind of knows the way\nit just makes it so much easier and\noften like less isolating or lonely and\nit's always nice just to have kind of\nthis neutral opinion where you know it's\nlike okay this does make sense or I\nshould be doing this or yeah I do need\nto take accountability for that so I\nthink it really helps well I'd like to\nask a little bit about that so in terms\nof resources what do you think is a\ngreat free resource that people can use\nand the reason why I ask is this if I\nhave like let's say a cough and I go\nonline already like the website\ndiagnoses me you have Ebola or like\nsomething like that right so that's the\nlast thing that I would want so do you\nhave any like free resources like any no\nof any free resources that people can\nuse to seek help whenever they want to\nin this case in this case absolutely I\nthink it depends on location so here in\nVancouver like I mentioned there's uh\nwomen against violence against women\nthey have an amazing crisis line\num often just Googling support resources\nfor domestic violence in your community\nUBC a lot of the universities UBC SFU\nWestern uni they have webinars on\ndomestic violence that are free so if\nyou're curious of a little bit deeper or\nmore about it or if it applies to you or\nyour friend you can do research that way\nas well\num yeah as as well there's also the\nending violence Association of Canada\nand their website is beautiful with all\nsorts of resources just to kind of\nacross Canada so yeah awesome so I'd\nlike to ask about\njust the current system that is set up\nfor people with domestic violence so so\nthis is a little bit more of kind of\nlike your opinion on so with the current\nsystem that they have set up uh in this\ncountry or not just in this country but\num but I'd like to ask if you could\nchange something about the the current\nthe way the current system runs and\nhelping people like this like what would\nyou change personally oh that's a great\nquestion I would say what would I change\nmore accessibility\num so again as I was mentioning uh on\nthe internet there's so many resources\nbut I I love in person you know where\nyou can just walk into a certain\norganization\num and I think just uh more people\nknowing about it so more discussions\nlike this where you know we we talk\nabout it and we fight shame and stigma\nsurrounding domestic violence and and\nproviding more facts and discussion\naround like what to do who to talk to\nthat kind of thing so that's sort of a\nchange thank you I think you mentioned a\nreally important point about\naccessibility unfortunately in the world\nwhen that we live today we always feel\nlike accessibility is always lacking\nright and um so it's something that\nhopefully\num we can improve our system upon I\nthink it's definitely something that we\ncan definitely improve upon and um so\nI'd like to\num Veer the question a little bit toward\na little bit of scenario so um I'd like\nto try to present like several different\nscenarios that I can think of in terms\nof kind of like who might be facing or\nwho might be witnessing um domestic\nviolence so the first scenario that I\nlike to present is let's say I'm a high\nschool student or a grade school student\nand let's say I can see that my or I'm\nsuspecting that my friend or class\nclassmate is being physically abused now\nthey didn't explicitly say it but I can\nsee let's say bruises or let's say I can\nsee physical evidence as that leads me\nto believe that there may be a there may\nbe domestic violence\nbut I'm afraid to approach because I'm I\ndon't want to assume anything but I only\nmake sure that I help this person what\ncan I do as a student as a friend or a\nclassmate yeah absolutely I think\nreaching out to the school guidance\ncounselor they have a lot of resources\nteachers again with their training are\namazing in terms of linking people and\nknowing like the steps of of what to do\nif there is concerns like that talking\nto parents caregivers any sort of adult\nfigure I think that can support and\ndirect towards resources I think as well\nagain the internet is an amazing\nresource so Googling how to how to help\na friend what to say what not to say\nthose sorts of things but I think the\nprimary piece is it takes a village so\ninviting other people in again two\nbrains are better than one so five\nbrains are better than two you know so I\nthink the more people the better so is\nit better even if I'm just suspecting it\nis it better to speak up about it or is\nit better to just wait like which one\nwould you think is more like wise to do\nis it better to speak up and like right\naway do something about it or is it\nbetter to wait to make sure that\nsomething is happening you can see what\nyou mean yeah I think it's\nit's better to speak up you know it to a\nperson that you trust so someone that is\nnot going to tell the whole school or\nyou know really like harm the person\nthat you're concerned about\num because we we never know right like\nyou say if there's bruises it could be\nfrom soccer practice or something else\nbut if you are seeing multiple multiple\nvariables and it just it's not adding up\nor you're worried about your friend\nabsolutely I think\num kind of pulling in an adult figure to\nhave another set of eyes to look at the\nsituation is really helpful and I think\nthe word trust as you were mentioning is\nvery important because I've seen many\npeople they would tell somebody else but\nthen the person that they told they told\nthat information to doesn't know exactly\nhow to handle it basically so and that's\ncaused all sorts of problems as a former\nteacher myself as I've seen things like\nthat happen so thank you so much for\nmentioning but trust piece so I'd like\nto move on to the second scenario which\nis\num probably in the workplace let's say\nI'm an adult in the workplace and I'm\nseeing that well the co-worker or friend\nthat I have it's clear to me that there\nare signs of domestic violence let's say\nand you and I tell them that it's that\nthis is domestic violence they need to\ndo something about it but the friends\nkeep saying it's okay oh it's okay it's\nprobably just my fault or something like\nthat which happens a lot more often than\npeople may realize so in cases like this\nhow can we help someone who may be\nsaying well I'm not going through\ndomestic violence like it's okay but\nit's clear that there are certain signs\nof\num I see I think really supporting this\nperson with a non-judgmental framework I\nthink a lot of us were very protective\nby Nature as human creatures and we want\nto fix and we want to save and we want\nthem to break up with this person or you\nknow really kind of change their\nsituation and I think when we start\npushing people in a certain direction\nthat's when they don't like to be pushed\nand they get defensive or you know they\nthey start kind of muting their\nconversations or changing their story so\nI think if we can just be curious about\na person's circumstance and ask them you\nknow hey how can I help you or you know\nlike what happens last night you know\nI'm here to listen I'm here to support\nyou in any way that I can just really\nbeing empathic and compassionate as\nopposed to\num kind of labeling it for them like\nsaying something like oh you know that's\nreally horrible you need to do this you\nneed to do that I think when we start\ngetting too prescriptive or directive\nwith with folks that that aren't ready\nto hear that yet\num it might guide them in the wrong\ndirection\nright okay so as difficult as it may be\nit takes a lot of patience it sounds\nlike yeah absolutely absolutely and I\nthink it's important to you know to\nhighlight that yeah like that's that's\nnot normal you know and normalness is\nsuch a loaded word and but I think with\ndomestic violence within households it\nis very normalized and people get used\nto it and it doesn't seem like that big\nof a deal but I think when a friend says\nyou know I'm concerned about you you\nknow uh you seem and just labeling\nobservations like you seem really quiet\nthese days or I haven't seen you at\nSocial Gatherings very much or you know\nyou seem really upset every day at work\nthose sorts of things I think can be\nreally helpful to draw awareness to the\nperson of like what's what's really\ngoing on here yeah absolutely\num because it's it always hurts to see\nwhen a family member or a friend going\nthrough something like that and you know\nsomething's wrong you know something is\nup and you want to do something about it\nbut I feel like as you were mentioning\nif we're so adamant about helping them\nthen sometimes it pushes people away and\nit makes them even more sheltered in\nthat place so I think what you mentioned\nis actually very very important which is\nvery difficult for us to do right\nbecause we want to do something about it\nright away we want them to be okay but\nthank you so much for mentioning that in\ncoming from a very compassionate place\nif you will yeah yeah absolutely and I\nthink you know normalizing resources too\nlike counseling like if you've had a\npersonal counseling experience\ndescribing that\num you know being able to name resources\nin the community like oh I heard this\norganization is really great or this\ncrisis line is really great or even\ntesting out resources for people so\ncalling the crisis line as a friend and\njust inquiring and saying like oh yeah I\ncalled them you know a few weeks back\nand they're really warm and friendly\npieces like that just remove the fear\nand barriers for people when they're\nmaybe thinking about reaching out to a\nresource but not sure what to expect\nright so I want to talk to you a little\nbit about\num kind of like reaching out for\nresources you were mentioning about out\num reaching out for counseling I believe\nthat there are still stigmas against\ncounseling which again this is it's kind\nof like if I break my arm people say go\nto the hospital but if I'm mentally ill\npeople don't say well let's go to the\nhospital people say you're fine so what\nkind of stigmas are there um when it\ncomes to counseling um including this is\ngenerally as well as for domestic\nviolence and what are some stigmas as\nwell as like what how can you can you\nspeak a little more about like kind of\nlike breaking out of those stigmas a\nlittle bit kind of like what are the\nstigmas and how can we make sure that\nthis stigma is not true for people who\nare\num considering it basically yeah\nabsolutely I think you know when it\ncomes to stigma around mental health\nyou're right it is absolutely there and\nyou know it's with the internet and\nparticularly with covid actually it's\nbecoming more and more normalized to\ntalk about\num but I think you know we do have to\nchoose our audiences so for example if\nwe're in a workplace where it's not not\nsafe to disclose we have anxiety\ndepression PTSD whatever it is and then\nthere's other workplaces where it is\nreally safe so it's really kind of\nassessing for yourself how you feel and\nit's okay to put a foot in the door\ntechnique you know like asking someone\nlike yeah have you ever been to\ncounseling before right you know and see\nwhat they say and if they're like oh\nnever that way I would never do that it\nsounds horrible like then it's okay so\nyou know your audience a little bit more\nthere or as if somebody's like yeah I\nreally heard great things about\ncounseling you know again that that\nperson is probably going to be warm and\napproachable with that dialogue so\num yeah yeah yeah I really hope that a\nlot of people heard that because it's\nimportant for us to know that it's not a\nbad thing the counseling is actually a\nvery very open and approachable way and\nhopefully the sigma is I guess broken\nlike through the talks that we have so\nthat um people can like approach\ncounseling with I guess an open mind\nhopefully that's what we want yeah\nabsolutely and and then it's it's not a\nplace where you have to go and talk\nabout something specific it really is\nclient-led so if you want to talk about\nXYZ absolutely and if you don't want to\nabsolutely I think that's also a part of\nthe stigma of counseling is that you\nknow it's going to be awkward\num or I have a lot of clients say like\noh I don't know what I want to talk\nabout or the alternative like I have too\nmany problems I don't even know where to\nstart\num and I think that's our job as\ncounselors is to guide people through\nthat the awkwardness is on us you know\nuh saying the right thing is on us and\nusing the different techniques and\nstyles like people you know they don't\nhave to worry about that\num I think finding a licensed counselor\nis really important because they check\ncertain boxes with education and\nexperience and ethics so reaching out\nand and you know doing your research\nwith mental health and with counseling I\nthink is important as well so yeah thank\nyou so much for that Insight um I'd like\nto talk a little bit about so this I\nthink this topic is a little more\nsensitive than the topic that we've been\ntalking about which is basically talking\nabout people who are perpetrators of\ndomestic violence so again as I was\nsaying earlier it's very easy to just\nlabel people and say these people are\nevil these people cannot be changed but\nof course we want to come from a place\nof compassion and so I'd like to ask\num how often are abusers themselves\nabused Ah that's a great question\num the statistics vary on that one but\nfrom my personal clinical experience\nusually most of the time hurt people\nhurt people so those patterns come from\nsomewhere whether it's from parents way\nback when or neighbors or I think\nsocietally too there's a lot of violence\nthat's accepted or normalized so you\nknow these these patterns these neural\npathways are built on years and years\nand years it's not something that kind\nof automatically happens overnight so I\nthink you know for folks that are\nstruggling with being with abusing\nthemselves or you know not being in\nalignment with their values again to\nreach out to a counselor honestly to\ntalk about what what can I do to manage\nmy anger you know what can I do to\nmanage my substance use so I don't\nbecome the person that I don't want to\nbe\nso how how common is substance abuse in\ndomestic violence isn't always that\npeople who\num are abusers\num do they always have substance abuse\nissues or is it pretty common or is it\nnot so common yeah it's it's common but\nnot always right\num again I think it looks very different\nlike um like Financial abuse looks very\nvery different than verbal abuse right\nso\num it really kind of is contingent on\nthe specific type or\num you know the family culture too as\nwell now I'd like to change the\nconversation a little bit toward people\nwho are abused uh people who are abused\nin a domestic violence situation so how\noften is it that people who are being\nabused themselves don't realize that\nthey actually are being abused and what\ncan we do to help them realize it so I\nthink we spoke about it earlier a little\nbit but um how often does it happen that\nthey don't even realize that they're\nbeing actually going through this yeah\nyeah I think pretty often you know in\nterms of stages stages of of change that\nthere is a period of time and it does\nvary person to person where we struggle\nwith denial we struggle with again\nnormalizing behaviors that shouldn't be\nnormalized and it can be very\noverwhelming and that's a protective\nInstinct within our brains I'm like okay\neverything's fine it's all good it was\njust once or it's just a rough six\nmonths or it's just a rough year or\nthey're yeah struggling with alcohol and\nit's not really them you know there's\nall the reasons in the world why\nsomebody can still have a heart of gold\nbut still act in ways that are\ndestructive to other people\nso um now I'd like to shift the\nconversation towards you as well so\nwhere could we find you do you have like\nuh in terms of social media and website\nyeah yeah absolutely it's a\nscholarclinic.ca\nemail us at connect Schuyler clinic.ca\nwe have a whole team of people um that\nare dedicated to counselor uh match\nconsultations so matching people that\ncall in with the right counselor I know\na lot of people struggle with myself\nincluded when I when I first started\nCounseling of how do I know what's a\ngood counselor the right counselor for\nme and I think you know having a\ncounselor or a mental health\nprofessional support you and what to\nlook for whether you want a\nstraightforward counselor or a gentle\ncounselor or counselor that uses humor a\nlot of the time or a male therapist\nnon-binary therapist like there's so\nmany choices and so as having someone\nsupport you in those questions and\ndirecting you where to go I think is\nreally helpful so yeah absolutely\nwebsite email a phone call to just\nGoogle Scholar Counseling in Vancouver\nand we'll pop up great and um I as for\nthe last question from me would be do\nyou have a message that you would like\nfor us to hear about domestic violence\nif you have a message that you would\nlike to share with us please yeah yeah\nabsolutely I think you know just\nreaching out for support again you know\nthere's there's so many people I think\nthat struggle with domestic violence and\nabuse and they don't know where to go or\nthey think they're the only ones they\nthink they're alone\num and there's a sense of hopelessness\nand fear and I think again reaching out\nfor support with with this is is just so\nhelpful and eye-opening in terms of like\nokay there's a whole nother world out\nthere or you know my relationship can\nshift or I can change or there's stuff\nthat we can actually do to make our\nquality of life better and be happier\nand feel safe in our homes\nall right so I'd like to switch the\nconversation over toward the audience so\num our subscriber sent us a few\nquestions that um I believe are really\ngood for our conversation today so I'd\nlike to start by asking so at noisy\njaden.o asks how does domestic violence\naffect the physical and mental\ncapabilities of a person that's a part\none of the question that's a great\nquestion I think it dissolves our sense\nof worth over time so for example a lot\nof us grew up with cartoons where there\nwas a little devil and a little angel on\nher shoulder and the angels like oh\nyou're so great you're so awesome and\nthe devil's like oh you're not very good\nyou're stupid you know you're not gonna\namount to anything and the way I I see\nit as a metaphor is that like if there's\nsomebody telling us you know all the\ntime or even multiple times a day over\nweeks months years we start to believe\nit you know where we're like oh I guess\nI I don't deserve this or or I just\nrather I do deserve this or you know I'm\nnot a very good partner or you know I I\ndon't have the capabilities to leave\nthis relationship or this situation so I\nthink it really builds over time in\ncompounds and it kind of becomes harder\nand harder to recognize as us being\nsucked down you know\num and a like really stressful\nenvironment where\num we feel scared and alone and not sure\nwhat to do I'd like to ask a little more\nabout the mental side that you were\nsaying earlier so obviously with years\nof somebody maybe months or even years\nof somebody telling you a certain thing\nand certainly that internalizes those\nbeliefs right so if somebody is going\nthrough that how do we help them break\nout of that internalized State yeah\nabsolutely I think really verbalizing\nhow much you care about them or very\nverbal creatures and even if the\nintention is there and it seems like\ntotally obvious that we're their number\none fan I think explicitly saying the\nwords like I love you you're awesome\nyou're great you know I really like this\nparticular thing when I do couples\ncounseling a lot I talk about\ncompliments and how to give a compliment\nand really the main thing is like the\nmore specific the better so for example\nif I call someone nice it's very easy\nfor me to challenge that in my head of\nlike oh but I was mean yesterday and you\nknow I I did this thing six months ago\nor I'm not that good of a person and\nthey just don't know me whereas if it's\nspecific of like yeah it was really nice\nthat you showed up for my birthday party\nlast week or that you got me groceries\nor that you listen to me talk about my\nrelationship last week on the phone\num it's pretty it's more difficult to\nargue internally with evidence that's\nlike well I guess I I did actually call\nthem or I did truly attend the birthday\nparty so it's a little bit more concrete\nright because it's hard to challenge a\ncomment like I went to your birthday\nparty so so thank you so much for that\nso so it's really hard to challenge that\nthank you for that insight and uh second\npart of the question would be how does\nthe feeling of sadness and manipulation\ngo away or like does it go away or how\ndo we cope with it absolutely you know I\nI think emotions are tough they're\nthey're typically on a spectrum so\nyou know with mild sadness for example\ndistraction might work right if I'm\nfeeling sad I'm gonna watch Netflix or\nI'm gonna go for a walk or stay busy\num kind of really dive into work but I\nthink when it starts to build and it\nbecomes overwhelming and we're crying\nevery day or\num you know we're not functioning at\nwork or you know\num we are buying ketchup in the grocery\naisle at the grocery store and that's\ntotally overwhelming\num I think kind of looping in mental\nhealth support whether it's your doctor\nor counselor there's medications\navailable I think talking about it too\nis really important so\num in our brain if we're in distress a\nlot of the time so in fight flight\nfreeze in panic mode or we're really\nreally upset it's hard to think clearly\nso talking about it brings it from the\nmiddle of our brain and fight flight\nfreeze to our prefrontal cortex behind\nour forehead where we can have executive\ndecision making or logic or weighing the\npros and cons of yeah I don't want to be\nin this situation anymore or I deserve\nbetter than this so I think the more we\ntalk about it with loved ones or people\nthat are safe the better\nso it's almost like calling out those\ninternal thoughts as well as things that\nwe go through instead of just letting it\nBrew yeah exactly exactly or even\njournaling like writing it down again\nshifts it in areas of our brain so it's\njust a different type of processing or\neven just talking to yourself or to your\nplant or to your animal\num I think really just kind of\nverbalizing and finding the language is\nreally important and we can almost role\nplay and rehearse with ourselves of like\nsharing our story just with our bubble\nyou know and then expanding that to the\npeople that we feel safest with and then\nkind of expanding from there\nall right thank you so much for the\ninsight and um I believe it was this is\na zaddy luthien asks uh what early\nwarning signs can you look for when you\nfirst meet someone to help you not fall\nfor an abuser to begin with yeah that's\na great question I think\num probably number one is emotional\ndifficulty with emotional regulation\num so if somebody loses their temper\nreally quickly and it's directed towards\nsomeone or something so towards an\nanimal\num if there's like kind of acts of\nviolence like throwing throwing a\ncomputer or throwing their phone\num or uh like severe substance use it's\noften domestic violence is about a lack\nof control a lack of self-control so\nreally looking for people's healthy\ncoping you know do they have a routine\nthat keeps them balanced\num are they happy do they Journal do\nthey talk to a mental health\nprofessional all and I think really it's\nmore so about looking for green flags as\nopposed to red ones so what does this\nperson do to support their own mental\nhealth so when stuff goes sideways they\nhave the coping tools and mechanisms to\ndeal with it accordingly well so\nspeaking of that I feel like in the\nbeginning of relationships as people say\nthis is when we see the best of each\nother right and it's not just because\nwe're masking it better but also I\nbelieve that you know our brains tell us\nhow awesome this person is in the\nbeginning and so we have tunnel vision\nso usually how long do you think it\ntakes for us to kind of like observe to\nmake sure that this person does indeed\nhave great coping mechanism as you're\nmentioning like how long does that\nusually take in your opinion yeah that's\na that's a really great question I think\nhonestly it's it's dependent on life\ncontext so for example I might be\num healthily coping with my work with my\nrelationship but maybe I lose my job and\nmaybe I start to drink more\num or maybe I get into a new\nrelationship and this person is so\ninfuriating and I just don't want to\ndeal with them anymore so I think those\nsorts of variables outside of ourselves\nalso impact the way we handle stuff as\nwell so you know it's it's we're as\nhumans always a work in progress you\nknow and I think establishing our own\nlines and boundaries whether it's two\nweeks from now 10 years 20 years from\nnow of just knowing like what is\nacceptable to me in a relationship what\nis acceptable to me in a house on a\ndomestic team so to speak and going from\nthere yeah I think that's always a very\nvery difficult part honestly because\nwhen you first start a relationship you\nknow you only want the best for this\nperson and it's very easy to be in\ndenial but\num I think it'll be great that you know\nbased on what you were saying that\npeople are able to make a better\ndecision for themselves hopefully in the\nlong run as well yeah and so we're going\nto move on to another question by let's\nsee Athena baker1829 asks how do you\nappropriately appropriately oh let me\ntry that again how do you appropriately\ntalk to kids about domestic violence\neither for preventative purposes or if\nyou as a as a bystander feel that\nsomething is not right about this\nchild's situation absolutely I think\nit's depending on the age so like uh I\nthink we would talk to a six-year-old\ndifferently than a 15 year old for\nexample so really from a young young age\nas young as possible talking about\nconsent you know\num and respectful behavior and what does\nrespectful Behavior look like I think in\ncertain families respect looks like\nobedience\num respect looks like not swearing\nrespect looks like talking to each other\nand talking about emotions being okay\nbut again it does it does vary per\nhousehold right and per family so using\nwords that the child at whatever age\nthey're at would use so a 15 year old\nwill have a lot broader verbal capacity\nthan a six-year-old and again Google is\namazing for this of you know what what\nare some typical phrases that I could\nsay to explain to an eight-year-old or a\nnine-year-old and again mental health\nprofessionals and Physicians as well\nactually will be able to describe a\nlittle bit more of the developmental\nstages that kids are at so you know\nwhether they have abstract correct\nthinking so kind of complexities outside\nof themselves or whether you know a\nyounger kid is just so self-focused and\nthey haven't really fully developed a\nsense of compassion yet so it might be\nmore helpful to talk about domestic\nviolence just pertaining to themselves\nas opposed to somebody else does that\nmake sense yeah so I wanted to ask a\nlittle more about so let's say you win\nthis\num domestic violence and you want to um\nhelp the child out or and so let's say\nthis child is involved in domestic\nviolence\num what's a good way to because you want\nto make sure that you\num help this person but not also get I\ndon't know this is kind of like um it's\na very sensitive topic right for someone\nthat young how do how do you start how\ndo you even start that conversation yeah\nyeah absolutely\num I think through the parents or\ncaregivers as an adult here in Canada if\nyou suspect any sort of child abuse or\nneglect we have we all have the duty to\nreport it to to the Ministries the\nministry of child and family development\nso again their 24-hour line is amazing\nI've called that number myself and\nthey're so supportive and they have the\nlist of questions and evaluations and\nassessments and they're experts in that\nso again if it's like oh I'm not really\nsure like when in doubt just call and\nyou can ask questions for yourself and\nget more information there's again like\nso many variables in it and it's so\ntough and I think for for most children\nit's just it's so complicated and it's\nso hard to understand that really the\nonus falls on the adults surrounding\nthese kids right so whether it's family\ncommunity teachers again any sort of\nauthority figure\nlooping in more support and experts in\ndomestic violence so there can be all\nhands on deck so to speak\nand I like to ask a little more in terms\nof educational context and let's say I\nam running a class on domestic violence\nand again again this is not suspecting\nsomebody who has domestic violence but\nrather for educational purposes on\nrunning a class and let's say we need to\ntalk about domestic violence in in the\nclassroom like how would you go about or\nwhat would you advise um that teachers\nconsider when we are talking about\ndomestic violence to little kids yeah\nabsolutely I think talking about a\nsafety plan uh that's one term that\ncounselors use a lot of like okay what\nto do if so if a child reports\num you know that Mom and Dad or parents\nare arguing about certain topic and\nthey're yelling what is that little kid\ngoing to do\num or who can they call or where can\nthey go\num or if there's a kind of sibling\nconflict you know how what do you say to\nMom and Dad or what do you say to you\nknow the the parents or the the\nauthority figures of the households so I\nthink again practicing and role-playing\nwith them so verbally saying it\num or who who can you tell like oh you\ncan tell your teacher or you can go to\ncounseling about it in the school just\nreally linking them to resources I think\nis important as well\nyeah excellent so then we'll go to\nquestion number five so uh Kevin fluence\nasks what are the best ways to help\nsomeone who is willingly refusing to\nleave an abusive domestic partnership\nwhich we already touched upon but I was\nthe last I like to ask anyway yeah\nabsolutely I think again coming at it\nfrom from an empathic standpoint so\noften uh we're taught that empathy is\ntreat others how uh we want to be\ntreated but true empathy is treat others\nhow and they want to be treated so if\nthey are wanting space and they don't\nwant to talk about it then they don't\nwant to talk about it if they're\nexperiencing domestic violence chances\nare their boundaries are non-existent or\nvery few and far between in the\nhousehold so if they're struggling with\nfeeling heard and seen it's our job to\nprovide a safe space it's not our job as\nfriends and support to fix them or\ndirect them in a certain direction it\nliterally is just like hey I'm here to\ntalk if you you want you know I see you\nI hear you you're awesome no matter what\nand what can we do about this and if\nthey're not at that place yet then it's\njust an open conversation so again I\nthink for a lot of people like it's it's\nchallenging to know like where the line\nis you know like what's acceptable\nwhat's unacceptable and I think for a\nlot of folks the line shifts so as\nsupport and as help we can also help\nidentify those lines of okay so last\nweek you know or six months ago you said\num that you didn't want to tolerate\nswearing in your relationship and now\nI'm hearing that like there's a lot of\num verbalized uh swearing or uh kind of\nname-calling and I'm just curious like\nhow how are you feeling with that or\nwhat can I do to help support you with\nthat okay so we'll continue with\nquestion number six AC Knight asks how\ndo you set firm boundaries with others\nin domestic violence that's a another\nreally great question I think\num it's a phased approach so for example\nif I if someone does something that I'm\nnot comfortable with and I say pretty\nplease can you please stop um and they\nlisten great beautiful\num if someone uh if I set a boundary\nwith someone and say hey like would you\nwould you mind speaking to me in this\nway or lowering your voice\num and they don't listen you know we're\nkind of put in between a rock and a hard\nplace so do I increase my voice\num to kind of overpower theirs or do I\njust take a step back and I think the\nmajority of the time if somebody is not\nlistening to your boundaries chances are\nthey're in fight flight freeze they're\nnot thinking clearly and just to say\nokay you know I'm just gonna leave the\nroom or I'm just gonna leave the house\nI'm just gonna go for a drive and remove\nyourself so we can use our words to the\nbest of our capability you know being\nrespectful polite language with boundary\nsetting and at the same time if somebody\ndoesn't listen they don't listen and we\ncan't um we can verbalize our boundary\nbut can't force them to not do XYZ so\nreally it's about what can I do in my\nbubble or what's my responsibility in\nterms of keeping myself emotionally and\nphysically safe\nand when you do so do set those\nboundaries and what can you do if the\npeople that we're working with don't\nrespect such boundaries how can like\nwhat what are some next steps that\npeople can take yeah yeah I think again\ncreating a safety plan like okay if this\nperson's not listening to what I'm\nsaying I'm gonna go over to this\nfriend's house\num or I'm going to let them do their\nthing however they cope um and I'm going\nto re-engage in this conversation\ntomorrow when things are more calm\num and I think again really taking a\nmoment to think and pause with whatever\nbehavior is happening on your end of\nthings like will this lead me in the\ndirection that I want this relationship\nto go so for a lot of people if somebody\nis yelling and swearing at you for\nexample to yell and swear back it kind\nof um trigger ping pong like we kind of\nescalate each other so I think a lot of\nthe time if someone's having a hard time\nor being abusive or is intoxicated or\nnot thinking clearly for whatever reason\num it's really just kind of taking a\nstep back and protect ourselves in that\nway\nso the second question is that the same\nperson asked was do perpetrators really\nlove their Partners slash victims or is\nit just not there it's a very\ninteresting question I love that I you\nknow that's something I think about a\nlot and a lot of clients ask me is what\nis the definition of love and I think\nwhen we just\num Define it as an emotion uh caring for\nsomeone absolutely people can behave\npoorly or not in alignment with their\nvalues\nand still care and want the the best for\nthe person so there's a misalignment\nwith their behaviors and what they who\nthey want to be essentially however if\nwe shift the definition of Love within\nlike a healthy framework for example\nthat you know if somebody has healthy\nlove towards someone they're going to\ntreat them with respect they're not\ngoing to hurt them they're going to want\nthe best for them and I think that's the\nversion of love that I tend to encourage\npeople to go towards a lot of us grew up\nin households where\nlove was verbalizing I love you and then\nbeing disrespectful towards each other\nso I think as we form our own\nrelationships you know it's really on us\nto Define what that relationship looks\nlike and what we what's appropriate to\nus or what's within our comfort\nand her happiness I think\ngreat so question number seven uh a days\nAmanda asks how does domestic violence\naffect children\nabsolutely so much so so much I think\num children are so vulnerable and their\nbrains are forming and they're figuring\nout what's right and wrong and what's\nacceptable and what's unacceptable so\nwhen we uh like swear or yell in front\nof our kids or throw things that teaches\nthem that that's okay to do even if we\ndon't explicitly verbalize it it becomes\nnormalized so you might notice that\num a little one is starting to behave in\nsimilar ways to parents or caregivers so\nI think again it's about healthy coping\nstrategies when we get angry verbalize\nit and take a step back take a moment of\npause do what we need to do in order to\nlike kind of re-ground ourselves and if\nwe can exhibit that behavior to the\nchildren around us and teach them how to\ntake a moment and just verbalize their\nfeelings and breathe then they will\nstart to form healthy behaviors as well\nthe same person wanted to ask will they\nuh will they by me they I mean our\nchildren well children also cultivate\nthe same kind of like domestic violence\nand instilled within them basically\ncultivate the same thing yeah yeah yeah\nI think we're we're creatures that learn\nthrough role modeling so if one behavior\nis deemed acceptable in a household then\nI think we all kind of learn from each\nother like okay so that's that's what I\ndo or what I say to get to where I want\nto go so if pretty please doesn't work\nif I scream and yell and throw things\nand then I get what I want then you know\nI'm gonna do that again and we often\naccidentally positive positively\nreinforce children\num when they do have a temper tantrum\nwe're like okay here fine just take it\ntake the iPad and go\num and that teaches them unconsciously\nthat okay so if they yell and scream\nthen they get the iPad so they're more\nlikely to do that again as opposed to\nsaying okay this is not good time for\nthe iPad right now just take a breath\nsit down and let's talk about it let's\ntalk about how you're feeling so if\nadults aren't conducting themselves in\nthat way then chances are kids are they\nseem to hear everything in a house you\nknow like kids are absorbing that\ninformation as well okay so is domestic\nviolence ever the fault of the victim\nall right I love that question uh short\nanswer no\num fault I find is divided into two\ndifferent categories one is\naccountability and one is responsibility\nso absolutely we all have the\nresponsibility to look after ourselves\nto protect ourselves\num to Define what emotional safety means\nto us but if somebody swears at me or\nhits me that is that that is not on me\nthat's they are in charge of their own\nbehavior and I am charge of my behavior\nso I can take a step back again I can\nreach out to different resources\num but at the end of the day if\nsomeone's behaving poorly towards me\nregardless of what I do it's not my\nfault\ngreat and how does one find Healing from\ndomestic abuse and with that I'd like to\nalso ask about you were speaking about\nchildren how does how do children who\nwent through domestic violence\num heal from domestic abuse as well yeah\nyeah I think a big part of\num anyone's experience is defining their\nstory so it's finding the words of like\nokay what what happened what did they\nsee what did they hear going through all\nthe senses\num you know when did it happen and then\nhow does it make them feel defining all\nthe emotions and what can you do about\nit\num and I think again it varies with the\nages of kids and the ages of adults as\nwell or the past experience that adults\nhave had but I think really talking\nabout it and brainstorming with someone\nof different ideas of you know\njournaling or music writing music often\nreally helps people heal or listening to\nmusic or\nvolunteering you know like volunteering\nat an organization to really like build\nour confidence our self-worth our sense\nof community domestic violence can be\nreally really isolating where we feel\nreally alone and really scared so\ngetting our needs met in different ways\nis important as well\nuh yeah thank you for mentioning that I\nthink that's something that you know a\nlot of people may go through but don't\nknow how to exactly navigate through\nbecause obviously when you go through\nsomething traumatic for a long time it's\nso hard to navigate your emotions or\nnavigate your life in general so I think\nit's important that you know we find\ndifferent ways to channel that if you\nwill to in terms of healing and um the\nlast part that I wanted to ask about was\nabout forgiveness\num as someone who's also been through\nnot domestic violence necessarily but\nfor someone through someone who's been\nthrough abuse in general I found it\npersonally very difficult to find to\nfind acceptance slash forgiveness so\num in addition to the question that um\nthis person was asking is forgiveness\nsomething that could be achieved or is\nis something that that should be\nencouraged or is acceptance like okay\nlike is is that like just okay with just\nacceptance yeah yeah that's a great\nquestion I think\nwith forgiveness\nit's for ourselves so if I carry that\nanger around for years and years and\nyears it hurts me\num I often describe to people that we\nall have emotional backpacks and every\nnegative event is a rock in the backpack\nuh or challenging event so big traumas\nare perhaps bigger Boulders or things\nthat kind of irritate us day to day like\nwith our job being frustrating we just\nput these rocks in the backpack and it's\nweight it's emotional weight and it\nmakes us it harder to navigate other\nexperiences in our life so really taking\nthe rocks out of the backpack taking a\nlook at them and disintegrating them\nthrowing them away whatever we want to\ndo and if that's forgiveness absolutely\nI I think another piece that people\nquestion is you know is forgiveness the\nsame as signing off on someone's\nBehavior it doesn't mean that it's\nacceptable absolutely not there's a way\nto forgive and still keep distance to\nkeep your boundaries again you know\nwhether you want a relationship or not\nwith this person there's different\num different levels of closeness with\nthe relationship so it could be a phone\ncall once every six months it could be\nyou know seeing someone once every five\nyears and if someone is in your life\nregularly that you need more space from\nI think you know Finding ways to get\nthat space if that's needed\nyou know I really hope a lot of people\nheard that because you know people\nwho've been through abuse probably find\nit very difficult to forgive somebody\nand um as you said I think it's very\nimportant that you mentioned that it's\nfor ourselves right it's for our own\nrecovery and um I really hope that by\nyou know people by by listening to you\npeople will\num I guess find ways to learn how to\naccept what they've been through but\nalso learn how to forgive for themselves\nso that they can find recovery\nabsolutely absolutely and I think too\nlike forgiveness is not a particular\nmoment in time it definitely is a\njourney and maybe you know this year I\ncompletely forgive person X but next\nyear something comes up that's\ntriggering for me or I start reliving\ncertain experiences or have new\ninformation and nope I don't forgive\nthem anymore so it really Ebbs and flows\nand its healing is not linear so it's\nreally kind of up and down and again\nforgiveness I think is subjective and\nit's um yeah it can be defined\ndifferently in a good way\nthank you so much for your time today\nDaniel\num you are our favorite guest so far now\nlet's let's clarify you're the only\nguest we've had so far but um you have\nbeen amazing and I'm sure that you're\ngoing to set an amazing standard for all\nthe guests that are coming from uh this\nfourth so uh thank you so much for being\nhere with us today thank you so much\nthank you"
