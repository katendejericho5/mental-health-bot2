    "transcript": "ADHD was once thought to be a\ndevelopmental condition but today it is\nacknowledged as a persistent issue that\ncan last well into adulthood\na study led by psychologist Dr Margaret\nSibley reveals that it persists in 5 to\n75 percent of people\nwith ADHD may be diagnosed in childhood\nor later as an adult we may be familiar\nwith the signs of ADHD that emerge early\nin life like behavioral issues at school\nbeing unable to sit still in class\ndifficulty following the teacher's\ninstructions or finishing tasks but what\ndoes ADHD look like in adults are they\nsimilar to the signs displayed during\nchildhood or are there any differences\nin this video Let's explore together\nsome of the signs of ADHD in adults\nmental restlessness\nperhaps you're accustomed to the fact\nthat the letter H in ADHD refers to\nphysical hyperactivity where one\nexcessively fidgets and moves about\nconstantly but did you know that the\nletter H is also associated with mental\nrestlessness professor of cognitive\npsychology Dr Kimberly Quinn says that\nthe ADHD mind is constantly filled with\na flock of very busy hummingbirds\nzipping in and out with each new and\ninteresting flower end with a constant\nBuzz\nADHD brain is the internal motor that\nwon't simply shut off okay more Yusuf a\nfellow adult with ADHD describes this\nexperience as having continuous inner\nchatter and overthinking that causes\nemotional burnout and mental exhaustion\nby the end of the day this internal\nrestlessness in adults with ADHD was\nmeasured using the internal restlessness\nscale in a study by psychology Professor\nDr Lisa wayant according to this study\ncollege students with ADHD have much\nhigher ratings of internal restlessness\nthan college students without ADHD ready\nfire aim we all know that life does not\nhave a rewind button but throw impulsive\ncomments into the mix and you might\nenter a realm of awkward social\nsituations\nprofessor of Clinical Psychology Dr\nRussell Ramsey explains that adults with\nADHD experience this constantly\nspeech spontaneity is part of the\npackage they may find themselves\nblurting out responses before the entire\nquestions are laid out interrupting\nothers mid-sentence or finishing other\npeople's thoughts this impulsivity is\ndue to hyperactivity manifested inside\nthe brain adults with ADHD have many\nideas and thoughts circling in their\nminds and they fear that they may forget\ntheir thoughts if they wait too long\ncausing them to blurt out things and\ninterrupt discussions they engage in\ntrapped in the now\nwhenever the topic of approaching\ndeadlines is brought up in the\nconversation I bet you'll hear a long\nsigh followed by oh no that reminds me\nthere is a universal understanding that\ndeadlines are stressful and can trigger\na feeling of anxiety\nthis is especially true for adult\nadhders who may display excessive\nemotional reactions to deadlines or miss\nthem entirely\npsychologist Ari tuchman says that\nadults with ADHD are frequently trapped\nin the current moment and are more\nabsorbed by what is happening now\nthey're much more affected by their\nsurroundings and find it easier to\ndisregard external cues\nit's more difficult to make room for the\nfuture until finally they enter the\nfuture\nand this is when Mayhem starts for\nexample even when they set the alarm\nclock for seven o'clock tomorrow morning\nthey're still up and about at midnight\nthis pattern of chronic procrastination\nis caused by executive dysfunction which\ninvolves difficulty planning or\ncompleting a job due to an inability to\nvisualize the final outcome\nloss for words you know predictive text\nwith text messages unfortunately for\nthose with ADHD their brains work like\nthe predictive text function\nlicensed clinical social worker Timothy\nKelly explains in a psych Central\narticle that when a person with ADHD\nspeaks their brain will deliver the\nfollowing line to them even when they\nhaven't yet finished the present\nsentence\nin other words their brain moves faster\nthan their speech leading to\ndisorganized thinking\naccording to psychology Professor Dr\nSusan Whitburn difficulty in organizing\nthoughts causes adults with ADHD to\nsometimes experience a loss of words\nwhen they want to explain things to\nothers\nunmotivated\nfeeling unmotivated the struggle that\neveryone can relate to\nbut neurodivergent adults experience\nthis feeling of laziness differently\nthey may try really really hard but are\nstill unable to accomplish their goal\nperhaps they see a pile of unwashed\nplates and cutlers turn around and flee\nthey may come again at another time but\nthe same cycle of running away persists\naccording to a study by research\npsychiatrist Dr Nora valko dopamine is a\nneurotransmitter that is active in the\nbrain's pleasure and Reward Center and\nis involved in the regulation of\nmotivation the researchers found that\nthere was not enough dopamine and\ndopamine transporter in the brain of\nadults with ADHD which subsequently\ninterfered with the dopamine reward\npathway\neven when adults with ADHD believe there\nwill be a reward at the end they still\nfind it hard to complete their tasks\ncan you relate to any of these signs I\ncan if you do we urge you to talk to\nyour family doctor or mental health\nprofessional to get it evaluated\nremember having ADHD does not mean\nsomething's wrong with you you're not\nweak defective or lazy your brain is\nsimply wired differently cognitive\npsychologist Dr Quinn even reveals that\nADHD can actually be reframed as a\nsuperpower\nyou use your intelligence in unique ways\ntackling issues and providing ideas that\nnobody has ever thought of before thanks\nso much for watching and we'll see you\nin the next video and remember you\nmatter"
