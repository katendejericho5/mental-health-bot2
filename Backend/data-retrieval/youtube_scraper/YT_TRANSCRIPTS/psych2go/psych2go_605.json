    "transcript": "in the 1980s a group of Japanese\ntourists set out on a journey to visit\nParis the city of love impatient and\nexcited they couldn't wait to finally\nland and share a kiss under the\nbeautiful Eiffel Tower but what was\nwaiting for them was far from what they\nhad expected the city was overcrowded\nand polluted and instead of fashion\nmodels homeless people walk the streets\nthey were so shocked by this discovery\nthat they experienced severe\npsychological distress\nanxiety hallucinations delusions and\neven some heart problems and dizziness\nsurprised by these symptoms a Japanese\npsychiatrist\ncoined the term Paris syndrome a sense\nof extreme disappointment when visiting\nParis it may not be cited in the\ndiagnostic and statistical Manual of\nmental disorders but experts believe\nthat Paris syndromes should be\nrecognized as a rare but real phenomenon\nprofessor of Sociology at the University\nof South Carolina Matthew de Flem said\nthat it should be regarded as an extreme\nform of culture shock have you ever\nthought that being disappointed by a\ncity could bring people so much distress\nunfortunately there are many\npsychological disorders with rare and\nunusual symptoms symptoms that bring as\nmuch suffering as commonly known mental\nillnesses let's find out more about\nthese extremely rare symptoms\nAlice in Wonderland syndrome\nlet's dive back into our childhoods for\na moment and remember Alice and her\nAdventures in Wonderland\nafter falling down the rabbit hole she\nfound an odd looking potion bottle and a\nmagical cookie\nthe odd looking potion made her become\nsmaller and smaller and the Magical\ncookie made her grow bigger\nbut not back to her regular size she\ngrew bigger than the white rabbit's\nhouse Alice's story later became more\nthan a bedtime story it gave the name to\na psychological disorder called Alice in\nWonderland syndrome\n2017 paper published in Journal of\nNeuroscience and neuropsychology\ndescribed a case study of a 30 year old\nman suffering from this illness he came\nto the hospital because of a persistent\npulsating headache he felt on the left\nside of his head\nhe'd been dealing with these painful\nattacks at least one week but the odd\nthing about these headaches was what\nhappened before them\nhe said that he saw objects around him\ndistorted some of them were much larger\nthan they normally are but when he\nlooked down at his fingers he saw they\nsuddenly appeared much smaller the\ndoctors then realized that he was\nsuffering from Alice in Wonderland\nsyndrome like when Alice began getting\nbigger and then smaller patients with\nthis syndrome suffer from visual\nhallucinations that are called\nmicrobesia and macropsia and just like\nthe patients we described they also\nsuffer from intense headaches around 30\nminutes after hallucinating the garage\ndelusion\nlet's take a look at another case study\na 24 year old male veteran suffered from\na wide range of psychological disorders\nhe struggled with depression anxiety\nborderline personality disorder but what\nbrought him to the hospital one day was\nwhen he started to suspect that his\nmother wasn't actually his mother\nhe believed that she was actually\nreplaced by a government employee who\ncame to punish him for what he did in\nthe military even after he got to the\npsychiatric unit he stated that his\nentire family had been replaced by\nimposters\nthis case study published in the journal\nFederal practitioner in 2017 describes\nan example of a Cabra delusion the key\nsymptom of this disorder is\nmisidentification of people\npatients don't recognize people in their\nlives their friends Partners family\nmembers or even pets instead it seems to\nthem like they are actually duplicates\nimposters with bad intentions\ndealing with this disorder seems\nextremely difficult it must be so\nexhausting not knowing who to believe\nnot being able to trust anyone but\nluckily a broad illusion can be treated\nwith the correct dose of medications the\nman from our example was able to leave\nthe hospital after only six days\nMania do you sometimes get indecisive it\ncould be about a small thing like\ndeciding between chocolate or vanilla\nice cream or you just can't decide\nbetween two universities or two jobs we\nall have trouble with deciding from time\nto time but to people who suffer from a\nbulomania this indecisiveness becomes\npathological a performance psychologist\nHayley Perlis said for psych Central\nthat abulomania makes a person\nindecisive to the point of obsession the\nconstant dilemmas severely affect their\ndaily lives\nhave you seen the TV show the good place\nif you have you might remember chitty\nanagonia an Ethics Professor who had\nsuch a hard time making any decisions he\ncouldn't decide on his stance for his\nmanuscript and what books to read which\nmuffin to choose and his inability to\nchoose a bar to go to even caused his\ndeath and brought him to the good place\nalthough we don't know if he actually\nsuffers from abulomania or not one of\nchitty's quotes could possibly describe\nthe struggles these people face\nmy entire life has been a torture\nchamber of indecision\nvisual agnosia and last but not least\nhave you heard about the man who mistook\nhis wife for a hat\nthis is the name of a book written by\nOliver Sacks who was a famous\nneurologist and writer in his book he\nIllustrated his patient's story the\nstory of Dr P who literally mistook his\nwife's head for a floating hat Dr P was\nsuffering from a rare condition called\nvisual agnosia\naccording to the National Institute of\nneurological disorders and stroke visual\nagnosia is an inability to recognize and\nidentify objects or people and is caused\nby brain damage people with this\ndisorder are unable to describe an\nobject even if it's sitting right in\nfront of them like in the case of Dr P\nthey might have trouble recognizing\nfaces of the people they love which must\nfeel so lonely and scary and in some\ncases as sax wrote in his book they can\nsee faces an object such as water\nhydrants or doorknobs apart from Dr P Dr\nsack's book describes a few more rare\nneurological disorders including a man\nwho can't remember anything for more\nthan a few seconds and two women who\nreported hearing loud beautiful music in\ntheir heads we linked the book in the\ndescription in case you want to check it\nout as we said before these disorders\nmay be rare but they are very real to\nthose who struggle with these terrible\nsymptoms hopefully by learning more\nabout them we can help raise awareness\nabout this side of mental health that is\noften neglected apart from these four\ndisorders psychologists have also\nidentified some rare fears that people\nmight have to learn more about them\ncheck out seven rarest phobias you may\nhave never heard of"
