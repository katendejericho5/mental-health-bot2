    "transcript": "hello psych2go viewers Our Guest for\ntoday's live stream is Anna Runkle host\nof her very own amazing YouTube channel\nwhich has been viewed by millions of\npeople and it makes empowering content\non the topic of childhood trauma and\nabuse and her expertise on this subject\ncomes from her own experiences of trauma\nwelcome Anna thank you for joining us\ntoday thank you Michelle\nso can you tell us a little bit about\nyourself and your background as well as\nwhat inspired you to help others with\ntheir childhood trauma through your\ncontent\nyeah\num so I grew up in the hippie days of\nBerkeley and our house was sort of a\ncommune some of the time and it wasn't\nlike the peace and love kind it was like\ndrugs and alcohol so there I grew up\nwith a lot of alcoholism and addiction\nin the family and a lot of the problems\nthat go along with that which are well\nknown and when I grew up I was\ndetermined to be the kid in the family\nwho had it together who got straight A's\nWho Rose above all that stuff and I did\npretty well I think if you're going to\nhave a coping mechanism for growing up\nin a hectic environment that's at least\nthat one you end up with a job but you\nend up carrying so much stress and so it\nwas in my 20s and especially towards my\nlater 20s when it started to really\ncatch up with me and I had stomach\nproblems and relationship problems and I\nyou know I had I was academically really\naccomplished but I would get on the job\nand my own what I now know was\nneurological dysregulation would make it\nreally hard for me to con consistently\nfocused to stay you know calm to show up\nand do the job and not get into\nconflicts with everybody I was starting\nto it was really starting to fray at the\nedges there and so I had a um Perfect\nStorm of traumas happen one night I was\nI was randomly attacked on the street\nviolently assaulted and they broke my\nteeth and my facial bones and\nand in the same two weeks somebody broke\nup with me and my mom died and that that\nwas the that was the period of time that\nsort of turned me into who I became for\nbetter and worse and at first it seemed\nlike a disaster I couldn't read I\ncouldn't use a telephone\nI went to the doctor the doctor said\nyour brain scan looks fine and we now\nknow I had PTSD from the assault and I\nhad childhood PTSD and this is not\nuncommon that somebody who had a rough\nchildhood is sort of holding it together\ncompartmentalizing it then something bad\nhappens and boom it gets out and then\nyou can't get the genie back in the\nbottle it's very hard to control and at\nthat time you know this was in the late\n90s or mid 90s they did not know what it\nwas they said you're fine and they said\ngo to a therapist go talk about it so I\nwas going three times a week to talk\nabout what happened and you know the\nattack was very interesting in a therapy\nenvironment but the more I talked about\nit the worse I got that we now know that\ntalking about trauma is not always the\ntherapeutic thing there's a time for it\nthere's a place for it but it's not the\nsolution all by itself and it wasn't\nknown then and so I was going down down\ndown and I felt like I was at the end of\nmy rope\nand I told a friend I said I just I\ndon't think I can kind of stay around\nyou know I think I've come to the end of\nthe road here and I'm I'm speaking\ngently here because I just feel like\nthose words are so triggering they are\nfor me too\nshe said you know I felt that way she\nwasn't even a friend I barely knew her I\ngave her a ride one night and she said\noh I felt that way come in have a cup of\ntea let's talk and I went into her you\nknow she had this funky Warehouse\napartment and we had some tea and we\nended up staying up all night talking\nand she had said do you want me to show\nyou she was a sober alcoholic no I'm not\nan alcoholic but I was sort of acting\nlike when she goes do you want me to\nshow you what I did to get sober and she\nshowed me something\nthat is from some people in AAA not\neverybody in a a does it but it's this\nway of writing fearful and resentful\nthoughts a very specific technique that\nI now call The Daily practice\nand it's sort of a prayerful thing\npeople can do it as a prayer or as a um\nas a release statement and then\ngo into meditation and she suggested I\ngo learn meditation I learn\nTranscendental Meditation at that time\nwhich was very compatible with what I\nwas doing\nand\nI didn't expect anything to work I had\nread dozens of books I had gone to 11\ndifferent therapists I had tried so many\nthings to feel better\nI was just like oh one more thing but\nwhatever she said you don't really have\nanything to lose to lose and this thing\nall of a sudden made this dramatic\ndifference and within two weeks Not only\nwas I out of PTSD I was out of\ndepression I was\nhaving an ability to focus my mind like\nI had never had in my life and I had\nbeen a bright little kid I was bright\nbut by the time I was 30 I would not I\nwas so it was so hard for me to pay\nattention or not be kind of triggered by\neverything going on around me that I had\nsort of lost access to my intelligent\nand boom it came back\nso it was really a powerful experience\nand I thought this isn't going to last\nbut it's now 29 years later and it's\nlasted\nthat I now know was me learning how to\nneurologically re-regulate that was not\na language those were not words for that\nback then but you know I've been staying\nwith my practice I've been continuing in\nmy healing and my recovery and changing\nmy life all this time and now I know\nthat's called neurological dysregulation\nand that's known I you know I read about\nit in Bessel vanderkolk's book and Pete\nWalker's book vessel Van Der kolk body\nkeeps the score a lot of people have\nread that and Pete Walker\num cptsd from surviving to thriving\nI read those books they came out in 2013\nand 2014\nrespectively and\nit absolutely blew my mind I was like oh\nthis is a thing I have a thing this is\nnot just me being a weird and\nproblematic person I have classic common\nnormal symptoms of complex PTSD that's\nthe kind of PTSD that comes from\nchronic ongoing exposure to stress and\nI'll tell my childhood was very very\nstressful violence you know drugs people\nhaving sex on the floor you know when I\nwas five I was given LSD when I was four\nyears old accidentally you know just\nthings kept happening and we were very\npoor and no matter how much I tried to\nact normal you know there was only so\nmuch I could\ncover at home now we were hungry\nsometimes we weren't supported I didn't\nwhen it was time to go to college I had\nno idea how you'd do that like nobody\ntold me people just assumed\nI think I looked okay on the outside\nsort of I was very dirty I often had\nlike Rat's Nest but by the time I was in\nhigh school I knew how to brush my hair\neverybody just assumed you know there's\na white girl she must be supported at\nhome to do this and there was nobody\nto tell me and so I didn't even I didn't\napply I walked to the university when\nthe semester was beginning and I was\nlike how do I go here and they were like\nwell you have to apply last year you\nhave to take these tests yeah I I just\ndidn't even know any of that\nso I had a lot of growing up to do at\nthat time\nbut back to that time in in the mid 90s\nwhen I first learned how to re-regulate\nthat put me on a Level Playing Field\nwith people who were non-traumatized but\nwhat I didn't know is how you do life I\ndidn't know how you do relationships how\ndo you apologize how do you accept an\ninvitation how do you um tell somebody\npolitely no you would not like to go on\na date with them like I was feral I\ndidn't know any of this stuff\nand so once I was re-regulated I could\nstart to get busy learning how you do\nlife and solving the problems of my life\nand I had problems you know I just I had\na lot I had a lot of problems to solve\nlike I was a really heavy chain smoker I\num I I was really\num\nself-centered I would say which I think\nis really common when you have trauma\nyou think about your own feelings and it\nmay be not so much other people's\nfeelings and so then I was on the\njourney to understand like how to be a\ngood person how to be empathic towards\nother people and that's been like the\nmost exciting thing in the world so\ncrappy childhood fairy came about this\nis like a long story are you with me so\nfar yeah okay keep going okay so so this\nbecame this thing that I taught people\non the side and I started going to\nAl-Anon which is the 12-step program for\nfamilies of Alcoholics and it helped me\nso much back then and there I showed\nthem these techniques that I was using\nto get re-regulated and I was told you\nknow if you want to recover and stay\nrecovered you have to be willing to give\nit away to other people so I over over\nthe years I sponsored about 300 women\nand I showed them how to do this and\nmany of them continued and some of them\ndidn't and you know just like a normal\nrange of outcomes with that but I had a\nlot of practice listening to people and\nshowing them how to do this written\ntechnique now what's really cool about a\nwritten technique is we now know that\ntalking about trauma can reactivate\ndysregulation and Trauma symptoms you\ncan write those same thoughts out and\nexpress them you can write them and read\nthem to somebody and it does not in most\npeople it will not activate it will not\nre-trigger that dysregulation\nso I want to say something about\ndysregulation what it's like and a lot I\nthink everybody gets dysregulated\nsometimes\nbut what it's people with complex PTSD\nget disregulated more often they might\nhave a harder time getting back out of\nit and when it happens it's more intense\nperhaps you know but everybody does it\nand so you can think of like a newborn\nbaby and if you've ever met a newborn\nbaby and when they start crying they\nturn red they arch their back they're\nlike\nthen they get held by the mom they touch\nthat body you know maybe they nurse\nthere's touch and there's maybe some eye\ncontact\nthere's verbalizing and and the baby\ngoes ah\nand then they open their eyes and\nthey're attentive again that's what it's\nthat's re-regulation and we're all still\nworking on that as adults you know we're\njust better at hiding it but always not\nnot that good right right\nso that's um so that's what it's like\nand when as an adult getting\nre-regulated can feel like\ndiscombobulation numbness spacing out\nthere's an emotional component you can\nhave emotional dysregulation and like\nthe the helping professions know about\nthat one because it affects other people\nso dramatically they might not notice\nthat you're checked out or numb but\npeople can tell when you're emotionally\ndysregulated because you're flying into\na rage or you're you know freaking out\ncrying or it can also it can also get\nyou can also be very disregulated around\npositive feelings like falling in love\nwhere it's too much you know it's it's\nlike not quite anchored in the\ninformation available like is this\nappropriate is it safe and so what\nyou'll see is people who have childhood\ntrauma can get into some really dodgy\nrelationships very quickly\nand their attachment wounds will just\nlike activate and go hold on hold on\ntight rush in hold on and then if you\nhave abandonment wounds it's really hard\nto get back out yeah so that's a typical\npattern that can happen so emotional\ndysregulation is probably the big killer\nof relationships so a person can be a\nvery kind good person but when they when\na certain thing triggers them and when I\nsay trigger I mean neurological trigger\nof the phenomenon of dysregulation you\nknow we use trigger for a number of ways\nthat we would respond to things that\nhappen but when I'm saying it I mean it\nsets off dysregulation so something\ntriggers a person and typically that\nwould be like criticism feeling left out\ntoo much noise\num being pressured having to hurry you\nknow there's those are some common cptsd\nsymptoms uh triggers so that happens\ndysregulation begins and it's very very\ndifficult to pay attention to think in a\nstraight line you know if you're ever\nlike trying to pack your suitcase in a\nhurry to get to the airport and going\num Where'd I put everything Where'd I\nput everything it's like that just like\nthat it's like that yeah\nI'm so sorry go ahead no you go\num for our viewers I just wanted you to\ndefine and explain what complex PTSD is\nfor those who maybe don't know yeah well\nso regular PTSD or post-traumatic stress\ndisorder\nsort of came to the public attention\nback in the 80s when people were coming\nback from Wars\nreally messed up and they were like oh\nlet's call this PTSD\num and the symptoms would be typically\nemotional dysregulation\nflashbacks maybe nightmares\nhighlight High rate of addiction High\nrate of suicide things like that complex\nPTSD is the kind of PTSD that comes\nmaybe not from an acute like I was in\nthis one battle I was in combat I almost\ndied I saw my friend die that could\ncause PTSD complex PTSD is a kind that\ncomes from just chronic ongoing stress\nand some things that could cause that\nwould be\num growing up in an abusive family being\nneglected you know you'd think that\nabuse was like oh hands down like the\none that caused the most problems but\nbeing neglected has a lot of\nneurological repercussions like if\nsomebody was not attending to you when\nyou were in your formative you know your\nbrain was forming first three to five\nyears\nuh it can be very difficult to feel\nconnected to people to read other\npeople's emotions to self-regulate so\nthese luckily these things can be\nlearned you can learn and practice but\nit's a real setback and so a lot of\nthings that have probably been diagnosed\nas ADHD ADHD is a thing but maybe not\neverything diagnosed as ADHD\nis is that sometimes it might be just\ncomp just complex PTSD it makes it hard\nto focus\nso um complex PTSD is um it's what we\nknow about it so far and I say we\nmeaning what's been validated by the\npeople who are empowered to do that you\nknow I bring a lot to it but technically\nbecause I'm not a licensed professional\nI'm not a therapist or a doctor I can\ntell you my anecdotal experience\nbut what is recognized is that it um it\nhas symptoms similar to PTSD but there\nit's it it often has a much bigger\nrelational component very hard to\nconnect difficulty in the Romantic\nrelationships and I think PTSD could do\nthat to could do that too but some\npeople say you know like right now in\nthe DSM manual there's a lot of debate\nthey it's not recognized in the United\nStates it is in other countries as a\nit's got a code and it's a distinct\nthing\nhere that they're debating should we\nlump it under borderline personality or\nPTSD and you know if you ask me and my\nmy students we would go oh it's not\nquite either one of those things it's\nits own thing but nobody asked us\nand also there's not really any official\ntreatment that has been proven to work\nto help it\nand that has not stopped the um you know\nuh medical and Mental Health Care World\nfrom just sort of pushing people through\na standard thing that you might do for\ndepression which is talk therapy\nmedication\nbut the thing is talk therapy it it's\nnot always well targeted for complex\nPTSD especially because the talking can\nre-trigger trauma and I'm I'm living\nproof\ntherapy can do more harm than good when\nyou have complex PTSD I would just go\nsit outside in my car I would go to a\ntherapist and we'd talk and I'd always\ngo in like with the greatest intentions\ngoing well this is what's going on this\nis what I'm working on this is what I'm\nhaving a hard time with by the end of\nthe 50 minutes I would be a puddle\nand I would have to go sit in my car and\nwait 45 minutes to drive home I was so\ndisregulated I couldn't even use my\nhands do you feel that sometimes with\ntalk therapy for some people it might\nre-traumatize them in a lot of ways yeah\nit did me and I thought that I was just\nlike a weirdo and then I started this\nYouTube channel in 2016 and I said well\nI learned this technique because I would\ngo to therapy and it was just like\nwrecking me and wasn't helping and you\nknow I I thought that I was a hopeless\ncase and then I tried this and it worked\nand why don't you try it if you feel\nlike you need some help and that's when\nI began to hear back from people going I\nhave that I have exactly what you\ndescribe\nand I was going to also add with\nmedication often if you go to 10\nappointments on your insurance and you\nhaven't improved they'll say well let's\ntry medication but this process of\nlearning to re-regulate which you know\nvirtually everyone does eventually\nre-regulate but you can you can learn to\ndo it faster and better and to go oops\nI'm disregulated I'm noticing the\nsymptoms I'm going to pull back from\nthat so if you can notice that and you\ncan re-regulate yourself it's a it's\nit's completely life-changing but if\nyou're on anything mind-altering\nincluding many psychoactive you know\nantidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs it\ncan kind of\num put a damper on how well you can get\nre-regulated how well you can sense that\nand so even while drugs may be very\nnecessary for people because of you know\nother things going on it's not\nnecessarily well targeted for cptsd\nsymptoms\nso the techniques that I was teaching\npeople I I was so shocked you know\nthere's like half a million people using\nmy daily practice now and uh all over\nthe world you know people I've had you\nknow women who they do the daily\npractice secretly because they live in a\nyou know a Middle Eastern country where\nthey're not supposed to be on the\ninternet and we're you know or they're\nright now they're in Russia and they're\nnot supposed to be in communication with\nthe United States and we're just like we\nhave a PDF for you here you go here's a\nPDF this is how to do the technique and\nre-regulate so we work with people all\nover the world for for free with this\ndaily practice I have paid courses but\nthe daily practice is just shared for\nfree with anybody who wants to learn it\nand I think sometimes people try it and\nthey go I don't like it or focusing on\nthis doesn't feel good to me and um but\nthere are so many people who have resp\nresponded strongly to it and had a\nsimilar experience and if it hadn't been\nfor people hearing how I described what\nit was like to be me when I was\nstruggling and what it was like when I\ngot dysregulated I would never have\nknown that I have a normal thing\nand there are other people like me all\nover the world so it feels a bit like a\nmovement yeah and I think that's a good\npoint like people when they're going\nthrough something and they want to seek\ntreatment they should explore every\noption different options not just talk\ntherapy I mean for a lot of people talk\ntherapy is extremely effective but it's\nnot for everyone so it's important to\nyou know explore different options and\nor maybe different therapists because\nsometimes people feel like they have to\nstick to one therapist like maybe that\ntherapist doesn't work for you but\nthere's another one who does so yeah\nwell there are a lot of types of\napproaches to treating trauma and\nthere's like body centered stuff and\nmovement oriented treatments there's um\nsome people are using psychedelics some\npeople are you know there's many ways\nthat people approach this and I\nencourage people\nif they have an intuition that something\nsounds good it appeals to them it's\nworth a try but on a practical level a\nmajority of people simply can't afford\nprofessional help they do not have\naccess and even\nyou know it depending on what help what\ncountry they're in or what health\ninsurance system they have it it's it\ncan be a very long wait to get access to\nprofessional help and so\nyou know I feel really good about\noffering tools that can help bring that\ncomfort and ease and relief like right\nnow I and I feel strongly like\nwhen a person is trying is this going to\nhelp me is this going to help me I do\nfeel like you should feel Improvement\nfairly quickly and I hear some people\nwho have stayed years in something and\nthey go well I keep being told that it's\ngoing to take a long time of feeling\nworse before it gets better and I think\nyou know if that had happened to be me I\nwould not be alive\nif I had not found something that helped\nme now and helping me now doesn't mean\nit's going to solve all my problems\ntonight but\na person with cptsd needs a way to get\nemotional relief\nexactly and you know from that how can a\nsurvivor of abuse begin the healing\nprocess after falling into destructive\npatterns in adulthood such as getting\ninto abusive relationships\ndestructive behaviors\nyeah that's um\nso part of what I work with people a lot\non is relationships romantic\nrelationships and so there are a few\ndifferent patterns that you see often\nand one is getting into abusive\nrelationships and I I can talk about\nthat but I feel like there is some\nawareness about that\nsomething that there's not a lot of\nawareness about that may be even more\ncommon is getting into romantic\nrelationships with people who are not\nemotionally available or available at\nall or even know who you are\nand when there's an obsession with\nsomebody you can't be with that is\ncalled limerence and it's like an\naddictive\num it's it's this delicious Happy\nfeeling that you've sort of come into\nTechnicolor as a person but it depends\non\nlonging for somebody and imagining what\nit would be like if they felt the same\nway\nand people I've I've just you know I I\nanswer a lot of I do I'm sort of like\nDear Abby or you know I give advice on\nYouTube I do one teaching video every\nweek and then I answer two letters a\nweek and in my letters I'll often handle\nthe relationship stuff but it's I I've\nanswered hundreds of letters now and\nthere's such a clear pattern that for\npeople who were neglected often with an\nalcoholic parent like I had\nthat I call it uh crap fit you fit\nyourself to crap when your parent\ncouldn't really love you but as a child\nyou needed to believe that you were\nlovable and loved\nyou develop an imaginary sense of love\nand you can talk yourself into it you go\nyou know my dad may not have called me\nin a year but I know he loves me and we\nhave this incredible special\nrelationship and I know he thinks of me\nand I wait for him at the window every\nnight just in case he comes home like\nthat's the sort of thing a child who has\nbeen neglected or abandoned will do\nand it becomes like a superpower that\nprotects the child and helps them\nsurvive into adulthood and then there\nComes A Time\nwhen it's a male adaptation and it's too\neasy to just be hooked on somebody so I\nI help people who are um maybe they have\nan X that they just cannot get over or\nthey have a platonic friend who they\ncannot confess their feelings but\nthey're just completely hooked on them\nand devastated every time the other\nperson goes out on a date\nit's a strange kind of looping addiction\nwhere it requires you to have hope like\nhope is the dope I say\nhope that it can turn into something as\nessential for the limerent thing to\ncontinue\num but often people who are limit\nlimerent won't say anything because on\nsome level we know that if you say\nanything the whole thing is going to\ncome down like a house of cards the\nperson's gonna go uh what no I'm married\nor no I'm not interested or that's not\ngoing to happen and that would take away\nthis thing that's giving you this like\nhappy place\nand I've noticed it happens for people\nwho had trauma in the past who were\nneglected and whose lives today feel\nempty they don't have a lot of friend\nsupport they don't have a lot of Joy\nthey're you know the job the apartment\nwhatever they've put together in their\nlife it's like not enough for them to\nfeel good\nand to be growing as a person and so\ninstead of like the you know the good\nthing to do if you had it if you had if\nyou had every resource inside is you'd\nbegin to work on yourself and you'd make\nfriends and get you know\nand what happens with limerence is\ninstead you just kind of hit your\nimagination on this ghost who you can't\nhave and all this energy that would be\ngoing into\nfalling in love maybe having a family\nall that it's just going into nowhere\nit's very tragic yeah so I help people\nwith that and for that I I help people\nrebuild a life a life that has joy and\nconnection and support with people\nyou'll often hear people like women who\nhave been through neglect and abuse will\nsay I don't really have women friends\nand likewise men\nand it's a it's a sad it's a sad\nsituation and so I help people learn to\nhave friends again in a lot of ways do\nyou think that limerence is like an\nemotional Escape for the traumatized\nindividual who's like disconnected and\nmaybe emotionally numb\nyeah I do I think that that emotional\nnumbness and depression there's a couple\nof ways that people with trauma will\nwill try to self-medicate unconsciously\nthis is not nobody does this on purpose\nyou know but to get up and out of that\ndepressed state um one is to be angry\nyou know you have all these people who\nare just like oh it's angry\nand if they can't get it from real life\nthey watch the news all the time and you\nknow I I do feel that a lot of the way\nsome people have really gotten into\nsocial division as a whole Pastime just\nto be so angry at this group or that\ngroup all the time\nthat it's um it's a it's people trying\nto get up and out of depression because\nanger anger's not great but anger is\nbetter than suicidal depression it feels\nalive but you can't stay there forever\nand so soon that needs to be kind of\nworked through and I don't mean\nsuppressed but whatever you know people\nused to tell me you need to go talk\nabout this and so I'm here to tell\npeople I relate if people tell you you\ngot to work through your trauma you got\nto love yourself if you feel alienated\nwhen people say that like what are you\neven talking about I don't even know\nwhat you're saying like how would you\neven do that I hear you that's how I am\nand so what I learned was a practical\ntool where I could release fearful and\nresentful thoughts not so that I could\npretend everything's fine but so that I\ncould have less like hamster wheel\nthinking about everything troubling me\nand have true thoughts and have lucid\nthoughts and be like you know what I'm\ngoing to do something about this problem\nor I'm going to confront this person or\nI'm going to like ignore that problem\nyou have a choice about how you deal\nwith things that are hard but it's not a\nchoice when cptsd is just making all\nthat noise in your head it's just sort\nof like self-suppression until you have\na big freak out and just blow up at\neverybody\nand burn your Bridges and that's how\npeople hurt their careers and their\nrelationships and hurt their kids and\nit's a really hard thing and there is a\nway to calm those symptoms and and begin\nfrom there to to make changes and that\nanger is kind of like a facade and a\nbarrier that keeps people good people\nfrom coming into their lives right yeah\nit does or yeah for good people because\nit will attract a certain kind of person\nwho's like yeah misery loves company I'm\nwith you I hate those people too yeah\nyou know let's hate them together let's\njust sit around and drink beer and watch\nTV about how much we hate everybody and\nI just like it's so toxic but I\nunderstand because it's got a little\nlife in it you know yeah exactly it's\nvery attractive versus depression and\npeople are very depressed and the\npandemic did not help yeah I know like\nrace of um I was reading about something\nresearch shows that like rates of\ndepression even suicidal ideations went\nup during that time and that's very\nscary like it was a mental health crisis\nyeah there still is there's still is and\nwhat I notice because I I sort of hear\nthe murmur of my YouTube Community every\nday and I you know you have you're on a\nYouTube channel too and but I read the\ncomments and I it gives me a read like\nhow's everybody doing and they're\nself-selecting they come to my content\nbut I've I noticed that as we went into\nthe pandemic people had a certain set of\nfeelings and as it wore on they started\nto be show real signs of mental health\nwear and tear and then things got better\ntowards the end and I'm seeing this like\nsecond dip right now where people\nthere's a real pessimism and cynicism\nnot in everybody but just a lot more\nthan there used to be like it's hopeless\npeople are no good I give up it's just\nyou know I'm gonna just me and my dog\nand I'm not gonna deal with people\nanymore and um I'm I I'm always there\nlike trying to gently just say hope\nthere's there's reason to hope you can\nheal these symptoms\nconnecting with people again is a choice\nthat you have and so that's I teach some\nI teach a course called connection boot\ncamp where it's like a 30-day program to\njust a little at a time have one\nconversation a day then go back to your\nsafe place recover\nand then go back out you know say hello\nto the person who brings you your mail\nand just gradually come back and and\ntheir needs this is my observation then\nwhat a person needs to make any change\nthat's difficult when there's trauma\nanytime you stick your neck out like for\nme having a YouTube channel was very\ntriggering you know I get criticized I'm\nputting my dirty laundry out there I\njust you know shame comes up you know\nand now I did a bad job with a stupid\nvideo I look terrible you know it comes\nup all and sometimes people will\nhelpfully say yes I'm awful\nyou're always going to get haters and\nyeah of course yeah of course mostly I\nget so much love I've never had anything\nlike it so I don't mean to I don't mean\nto paint it like that but it'll come and\nit stopped me for years from sharing\nthis publicly I just was so afraid of\nhow people would take it and I had\nworked for 30 years like in healthcare\nand Community clinics and you know\nhelping people helping organizations\nimprove their patient experience so I\nwas very used to controlling my language\nbeing appropriate not saying what I\nthought but what the organization\nthought and so it was this really big\nthing for me to begin to express myself\nand my experience and my opinions about\nthings which are sometimes different\nthan the opinion you're supposed to have\nabout like how does recovery work from\ntrauma you know what really is it\nbecause sometimes I'm there I don't know\nthat's not my experience that that works\nthis works for me and so that was very\ndisregulating for me and then I I\nstarted up slowly I would put something\nout there and then I'd have to use my\ntechniques I'd be writing I have fear\nI've screwed up here I never should have\nsaid that fear this will ruin my career\nso for me a little kind of silver lining\nof the pandemic was it did ruin my\ncareer I had a video production company\nI was making all kinds of patient\neducation and it um in the pandemic you\ncouldn't make videos and I just started\nworking on crappy childhood fairy which\nhad been sort of a side project for me\nand then my audience and me we met each\nother we found each other amazing the\nwhole thing just like blossomed and it's\nbeen fantastic and I have a lot of\nfriendships with therapists and doctors\nand also clients who are in mental\nhealth and medical health and uh you\nknow we're teaching each other and we're\nsort of growing a new understanding I do\nfeel that we're in the midst of a\nrevolution\nand it's gone a long way towards helping\nme be resilient against people who would\ncriticize me online and I get that\nthey're like who the hell do you think\nyou are trying to help people recover\nfrom PTSD and I used to just get so\nupset and want to defend myself and now\nI'm just like\nthat's so sad that somebody is actually\npracticing and they don't realize that\npeople who have recovered from cptsd do\nhave something to bring to the table but\nabsolutely it's kind of their problem\nnow yeah yeah I mean lived experience is\nabsolutely valid absolutely and so like\nwho would know better than someone yeah\nlived it right yeah yeah of course well\nI was just gonna say though but I um my\nbackground my educational background I\nhave a master's in public policy and I\ndid I worked at a very high level at a\nnational Healthcare organization before\nso sometimes when people are sort of\ncritiquing my opinion and it's true I'm\nnot licensed in mental health but I have\n30 years of helping people recover\none-on-one using a 12-step program which\nis certainly recognized as a you know a\npositive and legitimate way for people\nto heal and um and I read books and I'm\nvery well educated and I know how to\nread studies and think critically about\nwhen we're looking at data that's like\nmaybe trying to you know get you to\nthink want something rather than know\nsome know the truth and um so I thought\ncritically about what I was seeing and I\nI put it together with my experience and\nthen mentorship\nfrom various areas of my life when I\npeople were helping me I I've got to\ntell you at some point in this interview\nyou know how bad it got for me even\nthough I knew how to re-regulate\nI was still having very self-destructive\npatterns in my life around relationships\nin particular yeah and um it wasn't\nabuse in my case it was I I twice found\nmyself\nnot realizing I had gotten into it but\nsort of waking up in the middle of a\nrelationship realizing I was with a drug\naddict\noh my gosh yeah but it's amazing and\nempowering how you've taken that pain\nand turned it into power to help others\nand I wanted to mention\num you went to a really prestigious\nUniversity you went to UC Berkeley right\nyeah yeah that's amazing yeah I was\nolder when I did it because when I was\nthe age for that you know it was a\nlittle harder for me to put stuff like\nthat together but that was part of my\nrecovery I was a year I got the daily\npractice within about six months what\nwas what that loose that my Lucid\nthinking was like\nI should be in grad school I'm an\nintelligent person I've been like\ntotally like wrecked with life problems\nbut like things were coming together so\nquickly and I was able to get into it's\na very difficult program to get into and\ndefinitely hard to get through yeah so\nthat's that was a really meaningful\naccomplishment to me and it empowered me\nto um express my opinion in a way that\nwas careful honest legitimate that's\namazing and yeah um really it is\nempowering and you're turning your pain\ninto Power which is something that\ninspires others and so I wanted to move\non to audience questions and so the\nfirst one we have here is by Liam hey so\nI have childhood trauma is it normal to\nbe a whole different person and push\naway almost everyone that is even close\nto that trauma\nyes it's perfectly normal sounds like\nyou're one of us um it's it isn't it is\nnormal that I I take it from like family\nof origin or people you used to know and\nthat getting around them basically is a\nneurological trigger for you to kind of\nlose it so there's some things people\ncan do I I feel like our culture has\nbeen very quick to think in a black and\nwhite I think black and white thinking\nis a trauma symptom one of many and\nblack and white thinking says either I'm\na I'm totally loved and accepted by my\nfamily or I have to cut off all contact\nand I'm always here going well let's see\nwhat the gray area is and I teach people\nthere are ways that you can have a\nrelationship with people from your past\nthat are very very boundaried and that\nyou can learn that you don't have to um\nlike when they go how are you doing\nseems like seems like you've put on a\nlot of weight you know or something like\nthat that you you know with super\nboundaries you just ignore things that\npeople say and you're like I'm really\nhappy to see you do you need any\ngroceries mom you know I'm running to\nthe store and you can be of service and\nyou can have the kind of relationship\nyou want and not open up every part of\nyourself to the person and that when you\nhave cptsd it's really hard to recognize\nwhere boundaries can be and how to\nactually hold them so a lot of us we\nfirst learn how to have boundaries\naround people that are hard for us to be\naround and it's sort of like I always\nthink it's like we have a developmental\ndelay where first we have to be two\nyears old and go no no no no then we\nhave to be 13 years old and go mom\nright and then but you know in healing\nwhen we're healing from the drama we can\naccelerate really fast and get back to\nour right sized age and just be like Mom\nI love you we're not going to talk about\nweight today thanks do you need\ngroceries you know like um setting your\nboundaries establishing them like yeah\nbut that's another one of those things\nthat like normal healthy people talk\nabout they talk about boundaries or\nloving yourself or you know oh i s you\nknow go get a good therapist well I just\nwant to say like\nhow would anybody know what that is\nright not everybody is good or a fit\nthere's not transparency around that but\nif you're from the you know I just call\nit the wrong side of the tracks you know\nI was poor I didn't know these things I\ndon't know what a good therapist is I\nwas very gullible and easy too easy to I\nwould just get into weird things and\nthen think I had to stay and think it\nwas just me and so we can't make\nassumptions that people know when you\nsay you need to set boundaries I\nliterally didn't know what that meant\nand had to read books and\num I learned a lot from 12-step programs\nwhere people who had been doing it\nlonger than me were talking in the group\nabout problems they had and how they\nsolved them that's a lot how I got\nsocialized on how to be a person it was\nreally helpful that makes sense not\neveryone knows those mental health terms\nyeah no not if your mom's on on heroin\nshe didn't tell you about boundaries\nokay I agree with that right absolutely\nor if you have a family who doesn't even\nbelieve in mental health to begin with I\nguess yeah yeah\nironically sometimes parents who totally\nbelieve in mental health can be equally\nfull of it you know oh right yeah and\nthen you know like well I'm you know I'm\nthe exception who gets to do things in\nmy own weird way but what I say goes I\nknow how people you know you're just\nhaving a complex and can be just as\ninvalidating just as not hearing a kid\nwho needs to be heard and understood and\nguided you know so I always remind\npeople\num wherever the trauma came from like\nthat's not the source of trauma like\npeople can be bad parents with any\nbelief system you know any religion or\nlack thereof or in a school system or a\nchurch or you know it can happen\nanywhere it's really just like this\nnegative part of human nature that can\nhappen so we can't get it too mixed up\nin like you know oh it's these you know\nit's um you know religious people are oh\nit's dads or oh it's uh you know it's\njust like people are very quick to\nstereotype who would be a victim of\ntrauma and who isn't\nand um there there are certainly\nsocioeconomic patterns but they don't\nmean much and assuming that people are\ntraumatized because they come from a\ncertain group or that they're not\nbecause they come from a different group\nis very wrong thinking it's always like\nmore complex than that and so um Cactus\nasked I have difficulty in expressing my\nemotions what should I do\noh well not being able to express\nemotions\nis sometimes a form of dysregulation\num or like flat affect it's called or a\nfreeze response there's a number of\nthings it can be and so I don't know you\nso I can't really tell you exactly\nwhat's going on with you but\nit's definitely one of the sides of\ncomplex PTSD some people feel Frozen for\nlike years at a time some people have a\nhuge emotional outburst and then go flat\nand they their face shows nothing it's a\nweird it feels like a migraine you know\nwhere you go you get very upset and then\nit's like I don't care I don't care what\nanybody thinks\nso getting in touch with emotions I\nthink for a person like me I was always\ntold you have to feel your feelings\nand that was a stereotype of what a\ntraumatized person needs to do\nI feel my feelings I'm you know I've\nI've I get flat affect sometimes but the\nfeeling your feelings is not a cookie\ncutter solution for people people are\nvery different some people are feeling\ntheir feelings too much and they need to\nlearn to\num manage their emotional regulation\nlike re-regulate emotionally so that\nthey're so that you have access to this\nis how I feel about it\nsome people though you could be\nemotionally dysregulated this was maybe\na little more my speed was I would get\nvery very upset about things but really\nin the end before I had learned began my\nrecovery I would I would be confused\nabout what I thought I knew what I was\nfeeling I'd be angry but really when I\nwas angry I was sad and when I was\ndepressed really I was angry and you\nknow there was there was all this stuff\ngoing on I thought that I had to hide\nhow I felt I didn't think my feelings\nwere acceptable so I had all these\nlittle Dodges that I would do kind of\ntrying to\ntrying to get people to care about me\nwithout risking that they would push me\naway and getting pushed away is\neveryone's core fear and it is something\nthat happens with cptsd we push them\nthey push us and there's so many subtle\nways that we do that and it's very\npainful\nbut there's a way that you can teach\nyourself and I always thought we kind of\nneed a charm school like an etiquette\nschool for people who have this so that\nwe can learn like when I'm feeling\nreally triggered around a group rather\nthan just going blank or running away or\nshutting down or getting really angry\nthat um I can take I can like what I do\nis I write my fears and resentments I\nask for them to be removed I take a\nminute I can text my friend if I need to\nand go I'm just like everybody here is\nlike talking really judgmentally about\nsuch and such and I I just feel really\nupset I feel like I want to argue with\nthem and my friend will go haha I\ntotally know that feeling and\nand then I go okay fortified I go back\nout there and I can be professional\nneutral polite or I can say I'm sorry I\ndisagree with that my choices are back\nso I think when you can't feel your\nfeelings you've lost you've lost\nDimension and I call it color like\nyou're not in color right now\nand um yeah and it's a it's a male\nadaptation and it I've I've seen\nthousands of people come back out of it\nif they had an outlet\nfor the bad feelings fearful and\nresentful feelings that was comfortable\nand you know worked for them you know I\ncall it pooping it out you know like you\njust get a lot of sorry\nit just piles up it's got to get out and\num it's got to get out and that's that's\nthe technique I have is it just helps\nlike just it's like rinsing your\nfeelings out periodically a couple times\na day so they're just moving and moving\nalong and you're not just like getting\nthem pressed down to where if you're\ngonna stay alive and cope with it you\nhave to shut it down and nobody's you're\nnot doing this consciously I'm sure so\nbut once you have an outlet for a little\nwhile and a way to rest your mind you\nmight find that your feelings come back\nout like little dandelions between the\ncracks of the sidewalk you know they're\nthey can't help but come out they're\nthere but they're waiting for there to\nbe sunshine and rain and safety it's\nthat inner child right\num I know a lot of people feel that this\nis one of the things about me in\nparticular I just don't relate to that\nconcept I I'm like me all the way\nthrough\nbut I know that people to me to me\nthat's a metaphor I think for some\npeople it's definitely like a part of\nthemselves that they feel very\nin touch with and feel love for and it's\na way that they can understand the\num tender importance of their feelings\nand their need for safety and for things\nto be good and so they use that\ntechnique yes and then um Leia asked I\nfeel like I've never believed in love is\nthat normal when you have complex PTSD\nI've certainly heard a lot of that not\nto believe in it and uh yeah I feel like\nI want to jump in there and fix that and\nsay No Love is Real it's real it's all\naround us and it's but it's very hard to\ndetect when you've been hurt so badly\nthere's a little bit you know I should\nmention something too and I don't know\nif this is true of of Leia at all but\nbut um sometimes there's an overlap with\npeople who are on the autistic spectrum\nand cptsd there are similar symptoms\nit's not the same thing one is something\nthat a person is born with and one is\nlike basically an injury it's a\nneurological injury to the ability to\nconnect and self-regulate\nbut the symptoms can be the same and\nthat love feels very fraught it's like\nwhat's everybody doing here they're all\ngetting together and having you know\nboyfriends and girlfriends and I just\ndon't get how you do that and why or or\nI would get this in mom's group my kids\nare college age now but I would be in\nMom's groups and I would go hang out\nwith these moms and they would all be at\nthat\nand I would just be under a lot of\nstress like am I acting right am I\nsaying the right thing\nand that's like that weird you know a\ndisconnection people you could feel it\nin a group you could feel it with an\nindividual and you could feel it in\nRomance and it's one of those things\nthat could be it could be a number of\nthings but I sure see a lot of it um\nfrom people who have been hurt so many\ntimes starting with their own parents\nthat they just think that's just a lie\nthat other people are doing that there's\nthat there's actually I think that we\nmy theory is and it's not just my theory\nbased on what I read and how I\nunderstand things\nI think um there's a there's a\nresearcher in England who calls it the\ninter-brain and says it's sort of like\nWi-Fi his name's Digby tantum\nand uh it's sort of like a Wi-Fi\nmetaphorically where people can\ncommunicate non-verbally with each other\nand so when you walk in and you can tell\neverybody's really sad you go hey\neverybody well a person with cptsd or\nAutism Maybe Can't detect then when they\nwalk into a room that everybody's really\nsad something has happened what what\nhappened so we might come in going hey\neverybody and everybody looks at you\nlike what is wrong with you why are you\nlike this\nwhy do I know that feeling and then the\nshame and like why don't I know this why\nam I such a stupid idiot\num is it because I'm poor is it this and\na lot of times it's there's a\nneurological injury going on and you can\nlearn you can learn the reconnection\ngradually and we never know you know we\nwe do know that the brain has plasticity\nsome injuries Maybe\nare not so easily fixed but we can learn\na work around and so some one type of\nperson I really admire as a role model\nis people who have lost a limb and you\nknow or two and they get a prosthetic\nleg and they begin to learn to walk\nagain and then they start working again\nand you know some people go on and do\nOlympics and that's great but even just\npeople who just carry on and they they\nhave a purpose in life and they're\nliving life they're having problems and\ngood things and falling in love and they\nhave a prosthetic leg and so it's not\nexactly perfect they can't grow their\nleg back but they're carrying on and I\nthink that trauma is a lot like that in\nsome ways there's a lot we can fix and a\nlot where we learn to carry on\nexactly yeah so the audience segment is\nover now thank you so much for that Anna\nwe really appreciate you being on today\nit was amazing and um honestly we really\nappreciate the work you do it's really\nempowering thank you\nthank you so have a good day everyone\nbye bye-bye"
