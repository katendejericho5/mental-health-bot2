trying to\nstay focused during a lecture or class\ndo you dread or attempt to avoid tasks\nthat require you to focus for longer\nperiods of time the diagnostic and\nstatistical Manual of mental disorders\nstates that those with ADHD are often\ndistracted by extraneous stimuli whereas\nsomeone with anxiety will often look for\nways to distract themselves away from\ntheir negative thoughts do

you're\ndistracted when you're anxious but also\nwhen you're calm suggesting you might\nhave both anxiety and ADHD\nnumber two do you live in the present\nmoment the future or the immediate\nmoment\ndo you notice that many of your thoughts\ninvolve worrying about the future and\nnot about what's happening in the moment\ndo you find that when you're at school\nyour mind drifts from the lecture and\nstarts worrying about what could go\nwrong next week\noftentimes anxiety is a mental state\nthat makes someone want to prepare for\npossible negative scenarios in their\nmind it

predisposes them to\nprioritize short-term rewards and\nactivities versus spending time thinking\nor worrying about the future this\ndoesn't mean that people with ADHD don't\nhave anxious thoughts about the future\nthough both can occur and are not\nmutually exclusive number three your\nhealth is suffering ADHD can lead you to\nneglect your health do you notice that\nyour impulsivity results in

pounding or\nyou didn't notice you were nervous until\nyou looked down and saw that your hands\nwere sweating anxiety isn't just felt in\nthe mind but it's in the body too\nnumber four do you feel impulsive or\nhyperactive do you ever notice that when\nyou're feeling anxious you start\nfidgeting or moving around in your chair\ntrying to get comfortable people with\nanxiety may find it hard to stay still\nor relax when they're anxious but\nsomeone who has ADHD will have symptoms\nof hyperactivity and impulsivity most of\nthe time even when they aren't anxious\nyou know when you're writing an\nassignment and you feel overwhelmed\nbecause your computer has multiple tabs\nopen at once this is how someone with\nADHD can feel most of the time it can\nfeel like you're always having to fight\nthe distractions around you and in your\nmind making everyday interactions a\nchallenge\nLiza koshy even joked on Twitter that\nshe is too ADHD for life and when\ntalking about the difficulty

with\nthis dress by withdrawing medical news\ntoday states that while the diagnostic\ncriteria for ADHD do not currently\ninclude problems with emotion and mood\nregulation such as social withdrawal\npeople with ADHD may experience these\nissues do you often feel rejected\nbecause your symptoms of ADHD make you\ndifferent from your peers medical news\ntoday says ADHD experts suggest
