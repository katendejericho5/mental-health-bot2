injury\ncould be you and you don't even know it\nyet while introverts are often\nmisunderstood and underestimated they\npossess a unique set of qualities that\ncan be quite intimidating to others in\nthis video we'll explore some of the\nways introverts can unintentionally\nintimidate people and Judson light on\nthe fascinating psychology behind it\nseparate from society being independent\nis often encouraged and rewarded in\nadulthood but wouldn't introverts choose\nto spend time alone on a regular basis\nand drift apart from the crowd this can\nbe interpreted as a problem by Society\npeople particularly extroverts can't\nfathom why anyone would want to spend so\nmuch time alone psychologist and\nrelationship coach and amaris Mendoza\nsays that sometimes being independent\nhaving a strong mindset and personality\ncan come off as rude and intimidating\nrubbing people the wrong way by Nature\nintroverts are often self-sufficient\nthey enjoy their alone time and do not\nnecessarily need to be surrounded by\nother people to enjoy themselves they do\nnot need many friends to be happy and\ncan be remarkably selective with their\nSocial Circles other Beth Bulow often\ndubbed the introvert entrepreneur admits\nthat introverts are pretty picky about\nwho they allow into their lives but\nbelow argues that this quality causes\nintroverts to be loyal attentive and\ncommitted friends\nbig brained in her book quiet kids help\nyour introverted child succeed in an\nextroverted World author and educational\npsychologist Christine Francesca argues\nthat introverts prefer the\nneurotransmitter called acetylcholine as\nopposed to dopamine contrary to dopamine\nacetylcholine Powers our abilities to\nself-reflect and focus\nsimilar to how an extrovert craves\ndopamine an introvert will crave\nacetylcholine allowing them to absorb\ninformation faster than most others\nintellectual individuals like Albert\nEinstein and Bill Gates are excellent\nexamples of the intelligence and\ninquisitive nature many introverts\npossess however many people are often\nintimidated by it clinical psychologist\nand author of Joy from Fear Carla Marie\nManley says our strongest feelings of\nintimidation often correspond to our own\ninsecurities for instance if at some\nlevel we're afraid we do not match up to\nsomeone showing a high IQ or strong\nInsight we often find ourselves\nintimidated by that same person we may\ncompare ourselves to them bringing out\nour insecurities and inspiring feelings\nof jealousy\nthe awkward silence not all introverts\ndislike small talk but most enjoy quiet\ntime they enjoy being alone with their\nthoughts and thinking long and hard\nbefore they speak some people however\ncannot injure even small periods of\nsilence and crave conversation and\nthat's not entirely anyone's fault in\nfact the results of a study of 580\nundergraduate students undertaken\nbetween 2007 and 2012 suggested that\nconstant accessibility and exposure to\nbackground media have created a mass of\npeople who fear silence the result of\nthis study were consistent with the\nresearch of doctors Michael Bittman of\nthe University of New England and Mark\nsitharp of the Australian Institute of\nfamily studies that humans need for\nnoise and struggle with silence is a\nlearned behavior emotions Under Wraps\ndisagreements between friends and family\ncan be heated at times words are said\nand emotions run High however psychology\nblogger and author of introverts in love\nSophia dembling insists that introverts\nand extroverts approach conflict\ndifferently psychotherapist Nathan\nfields for example says when an\nextrovert argues there may be a more\nwordy approach to it a more emotional\ncomponent whereas the introvert tends to\nbe more rational and reasonable about it\nfeeling less comfortable experiencing\nthe emotion and ambiguity this lack of\nemotional response can sometimes be\nintimidating or inhuman to people\nunfamiliar with it but please keep in\nmind that introverts are not always\ncomfortable with sharing their emotions\nand purposefully choose to keep them in\ncheck introverts can feel just as much\nas anyone else but tend to keep their\nemotions in check to avoid becoming\noverwhelmed easy to read often Curious\nby Nature introverts are also often very\nobservant of their surroundings making\nthem capable of noticing things not\ntypically noticed by others an introvert\nmay be able to guess your favorite color\nbased on your clothes or may guess you\nhave a cat or dog at home based on any\ndander you have on your clothes Dr\nJennifer Ken wielder the author of The\nintroverted leader building on your\nquiet strength says that the typical\nintrovert uses his or her observant\nnature to read the room they're more\nlikely to notice people's body language\nand facial expressions which makes them\nbetter at interpersonal communication\nhowever this concentration and insight\ninto others can be intimidating for some\npeople whenever we catch others eyes on\nus our first reaction may be to assume\nthe person watching is silently touching\nus it can activate our insecurities and\nwill need to get away from the person\nbringing them to the surface\nbeing told you're intimidating just for\nbeing yourself can be very difficult to\nhear it can be done right hurtful at\ntimes but that is why it's important to\nconsider how introverts function no two\npeople are guaranteed to be the same an\nextrovert may want to be the center of\nattention while an introvert wants to\navoid the spotlight people are built\ndifferently and our differences may\nappear intimidating and unapproachable\nbut they also make us unique if
