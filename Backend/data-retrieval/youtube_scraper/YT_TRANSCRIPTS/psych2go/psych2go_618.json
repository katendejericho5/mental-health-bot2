psychologist Laurie Helga\nbelieves that people who are comfortable\nwith silence are often perceived as\nmysterious because they don't feel the\nneed to fill every moment with small Doc\nin a society that values being outgoing\nand talkative silence can sometimes be\nviewed as awkward or uncomfortable but\naccording to Halco it's in silence where\nintroverts truly shine plus being\ncomfortable

psychology\nof Discovery and invention thinking\noutside the box and coming up with\ninnovative solutions and ideas are\nHallmarks of creativity and people who\npossess these traits are often seen as\nmysterious research has also found that\nhaving a unique perspective can lead to\nGreater creativity and innovation in\nvarious areas people are often drawn to\nthose who can offer a different way of\nthinking and challenge their own\nperspectives Dr chick sent me high notes\nthat people who are different have a\ncertain appeal because they break the\nroutine and when they break the routine\npeople pay attention so if you have a\nunique and unconventional perspective on\nthings this can make you more\ninteresting and attractive to others\ndon't be afraid to embrace your\ncreativity and share your unique way of\nthinking with the world confidence\nhave you ever noticed how some people\nexude a certain kind of quiet confidence\nthat's just so alluring clinical\npsychologist Dr Ellen Hendrickson and\nauthor of how to be yourself quiet your\ninner critic and Rise Above social\nanxiety suggest that a subtle confidence\ncan be an alluring trait while\nconfidence is attractive those who\npossess a quiet understated confidence\nare particularly intriguing as they\ndon't feel the need to boast or show off\nsubtle confidence stems from a deep\nsense of self-awareness and\nself-acceptance rather than a need for\nexternal validation people are often\ndrawn to those who exude a quiet\nconfidence because they appear calm and\ncomfortable in their own skin without\nthe need for external validation it can\nbe refreshing to be around someone who\nis confident in their own worth without\nneeding to constantly prove themselves\nin a world that often values external\nsuccess and achievement but just a\nfriendly reminder that while being\nmysterious can be appealing to some\npeople it's not the be-all and end-all\nin life it's important to be genuine and\ntrue to who you are rather than trying\nto put on a facade to appear more\nalluring however if others do find you\nintriguing and attractive then that's a\npleasant bonus to enjoy
