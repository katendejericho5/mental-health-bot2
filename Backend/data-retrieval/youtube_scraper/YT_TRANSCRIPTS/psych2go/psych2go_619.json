    "transcript": "sexuality the capacity for sexual\nfeelings is a complex aspect of our\nexperience but it becomes even more\ncomplex when you realize that you don't\nfeel it at all\nfor some people this lack of sexual\nattraction can indicate asexuality a\nvalid sexual orientation\nstill sometimes feeling asexual can be\njust the surface level of some deeper\nemotions that prevent you from feeling\ncomfortable with sex\nthese two can often be tough to tell\napart to help you navigate this here are\nsome signs it's the sexual disorder not\nasexuality racing heart when there's a\nhot sexual scene in the middle of your\nfavorite TV show or if you get a DM from\nsomeone trying to make a move on you how\ndo you react\ndo you simply think like nah not\ninterested or do you get all anxious or\ntense and just want to get out of that\nsituation according to the diagnostic\nand statistical manual individuals with\nsexual aversion disorder feel extreme\naversion and persistently avoid sexual\ncontact they're overwhelmed with fear\nand anxiety if they even think about\nhaving any kind of sexual interaction\nbut those who are asexual aren't usually\nso bothered with sexual themes they\nmight avoid them simply because they're\nnot interested but not because they're\nrepulsed by them I won't look\nthat lack of Interest might be another\nway to distinguish the two in a 2021\nstudy asexual individuals and those with\na sexual aversion disorder were shown\nsexual and non-sexual images the\nresearchers wanted to know if any of\nthese groups would pay greater attention\nto the sexual ones as expected the\nresults showed that asexual participants\npaid less attention to images depicting\nsexuality\nbut those with sexual dysfunction did\npay attention and they initially focused\non the sexual image instead of the\nnon-sexual one this suggests that those\nwith sexual disorders may still be\ninterested in sex-related things but not\nas intensely as they did before the\nonset of their Disorder so if you do\nfeel some interest and some sexual\nattraction but feel held back to act on\nit it may be worth exploring these\nfeelings further\nfeeling bothered\nthe anxiety and the lack of interest in\nsex could make a person feel a bit down\nabout themselves\ndo you feel that way it could be a sign\nthere's something more than asexuality a\n2015 study compared groups of asexuals\nand those with a sexual desire disorder\nstudy findings showed that those with\nthe disorder had significantly greater\npsychological distress and even higher\nlevels of depression than asexuals did\nthis might mean that those who suffer\nfrom some kind of sexual dysfunction\nfeel bad about it and wish they could\nchange they might feel like their lack\nof sexual desire makes their lives\nemptier or their relationships harder to\nnavigate and while asexuals still may\nhave some difficulties with romantic\npartners and societal expectations\ngenerally they don't mind their\norientation and are able to accept\nthemselves the way they are\nthe beginnings\nthe same 2015 study found another key\ndifference between the two groups\nasexuals described their experience as a\nmore lifelong pattern of no sexual\ndesire or attraction this was different\nfrom the group with sexual desire\ndisorder they remember having sexual\nfeelings and experimenting with sex in\ntheir younger days so as an asexual it's\npossible that you've always had a\ndifferent experience with attraction\nthan those around you you may have felt\nconfused by your peers experiences of\ndeveloping crushes and dating but later\nrealized that your lack of sexual desire\nor attraction was Duty or asexual\norientation\nbut if you have experienced sexual\nattraction in the past but now feel\naverse or uncomfortable around sex it\nmay be helpful to reflect on whether\nthere was a specific experience or event\nthat triggered this change\ncould something have happened that was\ndifficult for you to handle and made you\nfeel this way\nif that's the case talking to a mental\nhealth professional can provide a\nsupportive and non-judgmental space to\nexplore these feelings further so now\nthat you've heard the differences do you\nthink your lack of sexual attraction\nmight actually be something deeper or do\nyou think it's just the way you roll\nhopefully this video helped you gain\nsome more insight into your own\nsexuality as well as sexuality in\ngeneral\nif you do question your sexual\norientation and wonder if it's something\nelse we encourage you to seek help from\na sex therapist or any kind of\nprofessional and if you're still not\ncomfortable talking about it simply\ngetting to know about yourself more\ncould be a great first step in the\nmeantime please remember that your body\nis amazing and regardless of your level\nof desire you are deserving of love and\nrespect\nthis video has helped you or you think\nit could be helpful to others please\nshare it and remember you matter"
