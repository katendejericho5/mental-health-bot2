    "transcript": "narcissism is a very hot topic nowadays\nbut it's very important to note that\nnarcissism isn't a one size fits all\nlabel there are so many different types\nof narcissists and levels of\nnarcissistic tendencies that it's hard\nto diagnose someone with just one type\nsometimes just like everyone else's\npersonalities there are multiple\ndiagnoses mixed in today we're going to\ndelve into the depths of what happens\nwhen a sexual narcissist meets a dark\nempath if you're a book boyfriend or\nbook babe you might have gotten excited\nwith vision of Christian Gray and Tamlin\ndancing in your head alas this\nparticular mixture of qualities is not\nwhat you think let's talk about it in\nthis corner we have the sexual\nnarcissist this is not your traditional\nnarcissist this type of narcissism\npertains only to the individual sex life\nthis is the individual who can't stop\nbragging about their sex life or skills\nin the bedroom some key characteristics\nof the sexual narcissist are sexual\nexploitation sexual entitlement low\nsexual empathy and an exaggerated sense\nof their skills in bed studies show that\nwhen sexual narcissism is present in an\nindividual there is greater potential\nfor infidelity in the early years of a\nmarriage there is also greater potential\nfor sexual acts of aggression to be used\nin the bedroom to meet their sexual need\nfor satisfaction what does all of this\nmean the sexual narcissist will do\nanything they have to to satisfy their\nsexual needs do they need to manipulate\nyou lie to you whine and D in you tell\nyou what they want marriage and kids did\nI just describe Barney Stinson anyway my\npoint is that the sexual narcissist\nisn't worried about anything else but\nmaking sure they're satisfied in the\nopposing Corner we have the dark empath\nnow this one has layers like ogres and\nonions of course to get a dark empath\nfirst we need to start with a dark Triad\ndoes anyone remember what they are I'll\ngive you 5 Seconds to drop your guess in\nthe comments five 4 3 2 1 the dark Triad\nis not narcissism psychopathy and\nmelanism quick recap narcissism equals\nworried about themselves psychopathy\nequals no empathy melanism equals\nmanipulating others for personal benefit\nI know they already sound like a winner\nbut wait there's more to get a dark\nempath you take the dark Triad and add\nempathy but you just said psychopathy is\nno empathy I know stay with me the\ntraditional dark Triad is someone who\nonly cares about themselves their ideas\nand their own goals they will manipulate\nand deceive anyone around them in order\nto get what they want on top of that\nthey don't have empathy so they don't\nunderstand nor care how their words or\nactions impact others once we add\ncognitive empathy in there it's used as\njust another tool to manipulate people\ncognitive empathy or empathetic accuracy\nis how well someone can perceive and\nunderstand another individual's emotions\nit's like having a blueprint of the\nperson's mind and knowing which switches\nto fli clip our two contenders have been\nannounced now what happens when the\nsexual narcissist interacts with a dark\nempath this is going to be messy let's\ncall our sexual narcissist Ned and her\ndark empath Emily while on a tender Doom\nscrolling spre Ned pops onto Emily's\nscreen Emily the dark empath does the\ntypical due diligence checking every\npicture checking his height his bio a\nwhole nine to the passer by this is just\na single girl hoping she just found the\none to to go subscribe her we know that\nEmily's doing her research on Ned she\nfinds out that Ned is an animal lover\nhe's close to his grandfather and his\ndreams to become a lawyer she puts these\ntidbits of info in her back pocket for\nlater when Ned the sexual narcissist\nsees that he matched with Emily the\nfirst thing he notices is how hot she is\nhe knows that being seen out with a\ncutie like her would definitely up his\nstatus in the dating world he might even\nbe able to find a younger hotter chick\nthat goes to message Emily what should\nhis opening line be good choice you'll\nnever find better than me no too much\nalthough accurate in Ned's opinion I'm\nso glad you swipe right on me I would\nhate for you to miss out in the night of\nplanned for us perfect it lets her know\nthat she'll miss out in my amazing self\nif she says no his goal is to end the\ndate in the bedroom if you know what I\nmean Emily receives and reads the\nmessage and sees that Ned is a bit cocky\nshe decides to see if she can manipulate\nhim into taking her out in an expensive\ndate for a free dinner using what she\nlearned about Ned from his profile now\nthis example is not to say everyone\ndating apps is out to manipulate you or\nbad people all we're saying is get to\nknow the people you date no matter how\nyou meet them before getting too\nattached you may be looking for an\ninnocent date in some companionship but\nyou never know what someone else's\nintentions are we never want to go\naround diagnosing people when we're not\nmedical professionals but it's important\nto know about different conditions and\ntheir characteristics as always please\nreach out to a mental health\nprofessional if you are struggling with\nthese qualities within your own\npersonality have you ever met a sexual\nnarcissist or a dark empath do you\nbelieve you could be one or the other or\nboth we'd love to hear about your\nexperiences until then be mindful of who\nyou let into your circle don't forget to\nlike And subscribe and we'll see you\nnext time"
