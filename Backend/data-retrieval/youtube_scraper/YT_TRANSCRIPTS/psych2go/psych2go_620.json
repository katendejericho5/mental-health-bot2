    "transcript": "hello psych2go viewers Our Guest for\ntoday's live stream is Jonathan Decker\nJonathan is a licensed marriage and\nfamily therapist with a master's degree\nin Family Therapy and a bachelor's in\npsychology he is The Clinical Director\nof the trauma healing Clinic mended\nlight and he is the founder and host of\ntwo amazing YouTube channels Cinema\ntherapy and mended life Welcome Jonathan\nthank you so much for joining us today\nhello and thank you for having me sorry\nif you hear if you're it sounds like my\ncomputer is dying uh it's\nit's a driver issue but we're good it\ngoes like like for about 30 seconds when\nwe start and then we're fine see now\nit's all in peace no problem you're good\nI don't I can't even hear it anymore\nokay good that's good so hello thanks\nfor having me today of course um I love\nyour channel I'm a big fan of both\nthey're amazing and I just love how you\ncombine media and movies with mental\nhealth I think that's so interesting and\nunique\nthank you thank you yeah uh it's a I\nhave this I have this intense love of\nCinema that wouldn't leave you know I I\ndecided to become a therapist instead of\na filmmaker or an actor and so I thought\nwell I can leave this behind and it just\nwas there gnawing at me all the time and\nI thought what am I supposed to do with\nthis and my wife likes to say you have\nyour passions for a reason right that if\nthere's something inside you that won't\nleave you alone then it's meant to it's\nmeant to go out into the world or it's\nmeant for you to create it just for\nyourself but it can't just stay inside\nand not you got to do something with it\nso this is what we did\nI love that because it's very relatable\nother people feel like maybe they have\nto give up a hobby or something because\nof their career when you really don't\nhave to you can find ways of like\nincorporating it all\nI love that so for starters can you tell\nus what inspired inspired you to become\na mental health content creator and a\nlittle bit about your background\nyeah uh so I was born and raised in\nArizona and uh had a very nurturing\nempathetic mother I I mean I have a very\nI have a very kind-hearted father but my\nempathy my compassion the\nthe skills that I\nput to use in therapy are very much her\nshe didn't have a degree in counseling\nbut she was always the person that\npeople called for a listening ear for\ngood advice and she was just naturally\ngifted at connecting with people and\nhelping them to resolve their problems\nor helping them to feel seen and loved\nand heard and I think I inherited that\nfrom her uh but in high school I you\nknow made movies with my friends and\nwhen I got to college I thought okay do\nI go into film or do I go into therapy\nand I decided to go into therapy\num and so when I how did I start making\ncontent where I'm I'm blend the two it\nreally came down to I used to use movie\nclips in presentations uh and I use\nmovie clips in courses that I would\nteach in the community relationship\ncourses there's a course called how to\navoid falling in love with a jerk uh\nbased on the book based on the book by\nthe same name I was a certified\nfacilitator of that but I would pepper\nit with clips from the office or you\nknow close from Star Wars or all sorts\nof stuff to drive home the points and I\nand I saw really clearly that\num Mental Health\nconstructs and theories and modalities\nuh the the language of Academia in my\nopinion kind of suffocates the heart and\nsoul of psychology and what and what I\nmean by that is\nthere's how and I and I don't mean to\ndisparage Academia obviously the the\nresearch that people do helps millions\nof people\nbut I don't know your average person\nwho's going to pick up a journal an\nacademic journal and really dig into it\nand and get what they need out of it\nthere has to be some sort of translation\nmechanism between Academia and the\nmainstream and when I was using movie\nclips uh to teach these Concepts I\nrealized that that makes the abstract\nmore concrete people can see what it\nlooks like right if they can see\ncharacters going through it it's the\nreason why we connect so much to stories\nis the reason why we learn so much uh\nfrom the journeys of of these characters\nis because we want to vicariously\nexperience something that is healing for\nus or that is helpful for us the issue\nwith movies of course is that even when\nthey get it right they take something\nthat takes years and condense it down to\ntwo hours and so we have to be realistic\nabout what the journey actually looks\nlike\num\nbut that that's the power of it and I\nfeel like\nmy talent and I don't say this with any\nsort of boasting because I think we all\nhave talents and gifts and we all have\nweaknesses and I've been to so many\nacademic conferences where I thought\nuh I could never come up with this level\nof research this level of intricacy this\nlevel of of quality but I could probably\npresent it better because I have a\nbackground in stand-up comedy right and\nso and so and so when it comes to you\ntaking this material and help having it\nreach people in a way that lands uh\nthat that's kind of where this all came\ntogether and Alan uh who if you watch\ncinemotherapy He's My co-host he's my\nbest friend uh we you know we were\nCollege roommates and uh I just knew\nwe'd done some films together he had I\nknew I couldn't pull off a show because\nwe were looking at creating basically a\nhalf an hour television show every week\nbut I knew he had the talent and he had\nthe skills and he had the know-how from\nhis years in the film industry uh to\nproduce this thing and I also knew he\nwould be just we were good on camera\ntogether so that's where all this kind\nof came together\nthat's amazing because what you do is\neducational but it's relatable like you\nmake it in a way that's relatable and\npeople can connect with it instead of it\nbeing like academic jargon kind of yeah\nyeah that's that's the idea is we're\ntrying to entertain people into learning\nsomething oh my gosh that's smart\nmy wife Alicia she calls it edutainment\nright that's that's our brand of what\nwe're doing is edutainment and I grew up\nwith Bill Nye the Science Guy you know I\ngrew up with these other figures Mr\nRogers these people that you learned\nthings but you didn't it didn't feel\nlike learning and that's the thing is\nlearning should be exciting it should be\nemotionally involving it should be uh\napplicable in day-to-day life and\nsometimes uh in our in our quest to\nto be intelligent\nwe sucked the life out of it right and\nso we're trying to put life back into it\nit can relate to that being in grad\nschool\nyeah yeah so\num thank you for that so tell me tell me\nreally fast what are you studying a\npublic administration oh cool and public\npolicy okay there's a lot of good work\nthat needs to be done there exactly to\nmake a major difference where are you\nstudying USC\nnice okay yeah I've been to USC campus\nbefore\nI know it's really nice huh it's super\nnice yeah as I as our club was there\nbecause the gotmans were presenting and\nyeah no I liked UFC a lot very cool so\nawesome yeah so let's do this thing do\nthis okay first starters based on your\nexpertise as a therapist how do you\ndefine a toxic relationship in general\nuh\nI think what makes we have we have to be\ncareful because that word is is thrown\naround so much now that anytime someone\nloses their temper or acts selfish for\nfor a time or uh is petty we may be\nquick to label that relationship toxic\nbut if that's the case all relationships\nare toxic and that's we're human and and\nI think the issue is uh speaking of that\nclass how to avoid falling in love with\na jerk what's the difference between a\njerk and someone who acts like a Jerk\nIt's\nis consistency and degree right okay\nyeah and so so a relationship to me is\ntoxic not if it has\nnot if it has ugly moments\num but one how consistent are things\nmiserable and prohibitive to growth and\nprohibitive to\num\nto what's the word I'm looking for\nself-actualization and what makes a\nrelationship toxic is do I feel we we\nget into relationships to feel safe\nrespected and loved mm-hmm\nand what happens if a relationship over\na prolonged period of time we don't feel\nsafe respected and loved and not only\nthat but there are people in the\nrelationship who are not showing\naccountability or humility or\nwillingness to change and effort to\nchange right and so a healthy I think we\ncan say what's Toxic by talking about\nwhat's not toxic what's not toxic is a\nrelationship where I feel supported in\nmy dreams what's not toxic is a\nrelationship where I feel like\nI'm seen and understood\nand desired for who I am\nwhat's not toxic is finding that sweet\nspot between I'm accepted for who I am\nbut I'm growing into a better version of\nme right oh yeah because there's a\ndifference between I am who I am my\ntastes my desires my preferences my\ninterests they are what they are and\nI'll always be this person but I can\nwithin that become the better version\nand someone trying to say who you are\ndoesn't work who you are needs to change\non a fundamental level right there's big\ndifference from that and I would say the\nsecond one isn't is indicative of a\ntoxic relationship\na toxic relationship looks like\ngaslighting it looks like blame shifting\nlies and manipulation\nand a toxic relationship looks like\num\nit's not just accountability\nI we need accountability but we also\nneed efforts and look I've seen toxic\nrelationships turn into healthy\nrelationships that's that's why I became\na couples therapist right I've seen that\nhappen I've had a hand in that happening\num the hard part about that is people\nsee toxic relationships turning to\nhealthy relationships they stay in their\ntoxic relationship and think if I just\nhold on a little longer and what I would\nsay is you need to see\nsincere humility and accountability and\neffort to change if you're even going to\nconsider staying\nand then my last part of this\nmulti-layered answer to your question\nis it's not it's consistency and its\ndegree\nbecause what I tell people the reason\npeople stay in toxic relationships is\nbecause of the good things and the good\ntimes\nthe fact is very few people are all out\nmonsters\nmost people want to feel safe love and\nrespected and they may go about it in\nmaladaptive ways or they may have\nlearned to be selfish or they may have\nlearned to be hurtful but we stay\nbecause\nin a toxic relationship with toxic\npartner sometimes is sweet sometimes\nit's kind sometimes it's caring and for\nsome that's a deliberate manipulation\nand for others it is sincere they just\ndon't have their demons under control\nright and so what I tell people is it's\nnot what they're like at their best it's\nwhat they're like if they're worst\nwow yeah because we stay because of what\nthey're like at their best but and so\nthat's and that's the other question\nlike what do they like at their worst\nbecause\nyeah listen I've I've made a lot of\nmistakes about in my marriage uh I\nthere's something on our mental light\nChannel my wife and I are we've got a\nnew video series called marriage\nproblems because so many people just\nassumed that we had this perfect idyllic\nmarriage and that we never fought and\nthat we never and uh\nand so we we created these new videos to\nsay well we're going to talk candidly\nnot to air our dirty laundry but like\nwhat we struggle with and what we've\nlearned from it\nand so I've made a lot of mistakes in my\nmarriage uh and I and I've made a lot of\nmistakes as a person but one thing that\nI have going for me Alicia says is that\nI don't have a mean bone in my body\nand so I remember one time I said to her\nI'm sorry I got so mad and she said when\ndid you get mad and I said about about\n10 minutes ago and she says that was you\nmad\nand I said yeah and she goes we're going\nto be fine right\nokay yeah\nso when it again you may have somebody\nwho at their worst\nthey can be rude condescending critical\ndefensive withdrawing\nbut is their worst abusive\nif their worst is actually abusive it\nmay not matter\nwhat their best is like\nthat's a good point it's like how do\nthey treat you when they're upset do\nthey still respect you do they cross\nyour boundaries that's a really good\npoint yeah absolutely\num thank you for that and honestly I\nlike that you approach it with empathy\nbecause even the people who are toxic or\nor who are being like rude you have to\napproach it with empathy because they\nprobably have their own traumas most\nlikely they do yeah and I you know I\nI don't like to label people toxic even\nif it's the case because I feel like\nthat denies with that label it makes it\nharder for them to shake it whereas it's\nit's very it's a lot healthier in my\nopinion to label a behavior as toxic and\nI I don't like to say I mean in cases of\nabuse there's good and bad but a lot of\ntimes if you tell a person their\nbehavior is bad they're going to defend\nthemselves and tell you why their\nbehavior is good and so I just like to\nask the question\nis it working\nmost people will defend all day what\nthat what they're doing is right but if\nyou ask them if it's working most people\ncan say no it's not\nat that point at that point let's\nexplore some other options right let's\nexplore some other ways of approaching\nthis\nyeah well thank you for that and I do\nlike what you mentioned about maybe not\nlabeling people because then people live\nup to that label right yeah sometimes or\nit might make them feel like they want\nto yeah like the fox in zootopia right\nright if I'm always treated like a\npredator then or if I'm always treated\nlike I'm good I'm bad then I'm just\ngonna be that way because you know\nanyway right\nthank you for that and in terms of toxic\nbehavior in what ways what are some\nexamples of like crossing boundaries in\nin any general sense like friendships um\nromantic relationships like what are\nsome examples of crossing boundaries for\npeople who maybe don't know\noh\nI think it's important to recognize I'm\ngoing to answer I'm going to answer that\nI'm going to do a real quick detour that\nmost people\nwant to feel safe loved and respected\nand so most boundary violations\nare people making a desperate attempt to\nfeel safe love and respected or reacting\nto not feeling that way\nand so the best way to not cross over\nanother person's boundaries is to do the\nwork to feel safe loved and respected by\nyourself\nbecause then you're not you're not\nconstantly because I've been I've been\nneedy and I've been desperate and I've\nsaid and done things that were\npathetic or rude or demanding you know\nyounger me and uh\nand I and I realized it came from a\nplace of insecurity that came from from\na place of fear\nand so\none when you're dealing with somebody\nwho's crossing boundaries I'll answer\nthe question of what what boundary cross\nboundary violations look like but it's\nimportant to to draw your boundaries\nmore firmly and you don't need to judge\nthe the person\nin order to save for yourself does this\nwork for me or does it not work for me\nright you don't you're not obligated to\nstay in any relationship\nuh even relationships like marriage uh\nyou know in cases where I'm not saying\nif it's hard to leave I'm saying in\ncases where\nyou're trying to spend your life with\nsomebody right\num is this a relationship that is going\nto be\nthat's going to help you to become your\nhighest and best self so boundary\nviolations look like\non I mean the easiest answer is you tell\nsomebody what works for you and what\ndoesn't and they trespass over it yeah\nyou tell somebody what you need to feel\nsafe loved and respected\nand they say well what I want matters\nmore\nbecause a healthy conversation is oh\nthat's what you need to feel safe loved\nand respected\nthat's not a fit for me because here's\nwhat I need to feel safe loved and\nrespected can we come to some sort of\nconsensus or do we need to either end\nthe relationship or adjust the nature of\nthe relationship so it's you know so\nit's now a friendship or with family\nmembers you know I I have family members\nwho are boundary crossers\num if it were extreme or abusive I would\ncut them out of my life even though\nthey're family because nobody\nno no obligation is worth your mental\nand emotional health\nbut other people I say okay we're gonna\nhave a Sunday dinner relationship you're\nnot going to get to know my My Darkest\nSecrets because you cross the boundaries\nthrough gossip\nright or I'm not going to rely on you as\nmy Confidant or I'm not going to call on\nyou in my hour of need because you've\nshown that sometimes you'll be there and\nother times you say you'll be there and\nthen you back out at the last minute\nright what you've shown me is that I\ncan't trust you doesn't mean I stop\ncaring about you it means now we have\nSunday dinner relationship and we chit\nchat for a couple hours and it's fine\nand it's loving and it's genuine and\nit's sincere but it's not as profound as\nit could be because the trust isn't\nthere it's like keeping them at an arm's\nlength yeah and I guess I could go into\nthere are hundreds of examples of what a\nboundary violation looks like but I\nthink the simple definition like I say\nis if you say this is what I need to\nfeel safe loved and respected and the\nother person uh repeatedly crosses that\nline\nwithout accountability or effort to\nchange and and it takes both because you\ncan have someone who crosses your\nboundaries a thousand times and they\nkeep telling you they're sorry but\nthey're not trying to be different\nand\nI I don't know that you need to stay\nthere exactly exactly\num I like what you mentioned about like\nyou can genuinely like a person but\nrealize that they are not respecting you\nand that they're crossing your\nboundaries so you can't have a profound\nrelationship with them that doesn't mean\nyou hate them yeah no and I I don't even\nhave to judge them I can just say well\nthis is where they're at based on their\nlife experiences and their choices this\nis what they're able to bring to the\ntable and what they're able to bring to\nthe table\nmakes me feel disrespected unloved or\nunsafe\nright\nI agree with that\nso in terms of Trot like well I wanted\nto bring this up because I think this is\nimportant and something that people\ndon't\nalways like want to talk about maybe\ntrigger warning we're going to talk\nabout trauma but um how does trauma\nresult in people staying in toxic\nrelationships even when they know\nthey're unhealthy\nso here's trauma is\nfor some people it's my world used to\nfeel safe\nthe people\nthe world around me how I experience\nlife I there's a lot of Hope and a lot\nof stability and then that was ripped\naway\nuh by a traumatic act or series of Acts\nor incidents\nfor other people they never had the\noriginal I feel safe or I felt safe\nright\nand so what ends up happening is\nnow my life is fear\nand when I'm in an unhealthy\nrelationship and I know it's unhealthy\nand I refuse to get out most often is\nbecause I'm afraid\nI'm afraid of what the other person\nwould say or do to me if I tried to\nleave\nI'm afraid of what the other person\nwould say or do to themselves if I tried\nto leave\nor they've got me convinced or life\nexperience has me convinced that I can't\nthrive on my own I can't survive on my\nown I need to be taken care of even if\nit's by somebody who is hurtful and\ncruel\nI recently read this book\ncalled feel the fear and do it anyway\nby Dr I think it's Sue Carroll I can't\nremember exactly her name but feel the\nfear and do it anyway\nand in that book she talks about\nmost of our fear no matter what the the\nsurface of it is comes down to the same\nthing which is the feeling that I can't\nhandle this\nand that's why we're afraid\nand so the The Cure is to grow in\nconfidence in your ability to handle\nthings\nfor some it's self-defense classes for\nothers it's Financial Independence you\nknow doing online courses or watching\nthe videos or uh you know whatever or\nfor others is going to therapy and\nlearning how to be emotionally uh\nindependent\nand you get to a place where okay\nI can be on my own now\nI don't need this relationship to\nfulfill me or to feel taken care of\nand the problem with abusers one of many\nproblems with abusers\nis they're keen on convincing the abused\non their own inability to function\nwow right it's a form of gaslighting\nyour own inability to think your own\ninability to reason you need me no one\nelse will ever love you these types of\nthings and of course it's not true\nand so I I really do think\nthe more I do couples therapy and the\nmore I do trauma therapy\nthe more I think the core of most of our\nproblems is insecurity\neven even arrogance and ego in in\negotistical Behavior comes down to\ninsecurity\nright if I have to posture and project\nhow great I am and how in control I am\nand how I know everything and how I\ndon't make mistakes so this isn't my\nfault or that's not my fault or look\nwhat you made me do\nwe it comes across his strength but it's\na counterfeit\nright I'm afraid that people will see my\nweakness including me so I have to bury\nit so deep that I don't think I have it\nreal confidence\nis owning your mistakes real confidence\nis owning your weaknesses and real\nconfidence is trusting in your ability\nto say okay I don't know how to do this\nbut I'm as capable as anybody and I can\nlearn\nright exactly so why do people stay in\nabusive relationships I think it's that\nI think that's in excuse me I think it's\nthat insecurity in a lot of cases in\nsome cases it's just plain I don't feel\nphysically safe if I try and leave right\nlike oh yeah\nexactly in some cases it's not the other\nit's almost not the other person's\ndecision like they're in an abusive\nrelationship or it's D like domestic\nviolence other case in other cases\nthough what you're trying to say or what\nI'm interpreting it as\num are you trying to say it's like a\nthat fear stems from like a loss of\ncontrol in some ways yeah yeah like a\nloss of control and maybe a lack of\nself-love\nit's definitely a lack of self-love and\nthe the loss of control thing is\ninteresting because people try to\ncounter that by controlling people\naround them or controlling their\ncircumstances but the only thing you\nreally can control and this is this is\nthe power of it I can control me I can\ncontrol my mind I can control my\nemotions and if it feels like I can't\nit's because I haven't learned the right\nskills and practiced them enough the\nfact is it's going to be rough for a\nwhile trying to trying to do that\nbut any of us can self-soothe any of us\ncan re-engage when we're calm and\nclear-headed any of us can assess a\nsituation and make strategies or any of\nus can also call in backup and use\nresources that are available to us right\nto help us get into a good place and so\nthat I'm interested that you said\ncontrol because we do feel like our\nlives are out of control but the the\nsolution isn't what so many people do\nwhich is to try and control their life\nor their environment it's it's to\ncontrol themselves is to master\nthemselves exactly so like a powerful\ntool is having a strong sense of self\nessentially it's like a barrier like I\nknow who I am and I'm not gonna let\nanyone break me yes and and to build on\nthat I know my worth\nright wow yeah exactly I know my worth\nso\na lot of people are in abusive\nrelationships because they believe\nthat's what they deserve they believe\nthey're trash or they believe that\nthey're lesser or they believe all sorts\nof negative false things about\nthemselves and what I like to tell\npeople and Alan actually said this one\nof our episodes so I'll quote him he\nsays\nyou're not that special\nyou're just a sack of meat and bones\nlike the rest of us and what he meant by\nthat is we because in the context I know\nthat sounds harsh but what the context\nwas is we all have strengths\nand we all have weaknesses so either all\nof us have Worth or none of us do\nbecause we're all basically the same\nlike the strengths take different forms\nand the weaknesses take different forms\nbut most people aren't willing to say\nthat their neighbor their friend their\ntheir family member their loved ones are\nworthless or that a stranger that they\nmeet is worthless but they believe that\nthey're worthless and so Alan's point is\nwhat makes you so special that everybody\nelse has worth and you don't\n[Laughter]\nlike we're all just sex and meat doing\nthe best we can and so so either either\nwe all have Worth or none of us do and I\nchoose to believe that we all do in\nwhich case\nuh\nI don't deserve to be treated poorly\nright because no one does\nright\nI don't I don't deserve\nabuse or neglect because no one does\nright we all have that innate worth\nAlicia and I have created uh this\nprogram because mended light is our\nother YouTube channel and uh Cinema\ntherapy exists kind of like that that's\nthe YouTube channel is the business\nright but the menu like that channel is\nkind of a Gateway people choose\num to get support for trauma and we have\na trauma recovery program and part of\nthat is understanding and embracing your\ninnate worth as a human being and just\nhow crucial that is to finding your\nlight yeah and then that's and that's\nwhere the name mended light comes from\nis the idea that we all have we all have\nlight within us that we can share that\nwe can shine that we can use and when\nyou experience a trauma when you\nexperience abuse when you experience a\ntoxic relationship oftentimes it feels\nlike that light is flickering or dimming\nor going out and so how do we mend that\nthat's where that name comes from\nI love that and honestly since you're\nlike the cinema guy it's funny when you\nwere talking about like we accept the\nlove we think we deserve that's like\nPerks of Being a Wallflower yes yes\nthat's the love we think we deserve you\nknow what's funny is I hadn't seen that\nmovie until last year uh because we did\nit for an episode and but I have been\nteaching that principle and that that's\nthe thing is\ngood ideas don't really originate from\nany one person right you know anytime I\nsay something that people think of that\nwas wise or helpful they're like did you\ncome up with that I'm like\nkind of\nI'm sure others have had that thought\nand the only reason I had the thought is\nbecause\nI've read and watched and listened to\nthe the thoughts and learnings of so\nmany other people that have stimulated\nmy brain right so exactly\nand do you think going off of that\nconcept of we accept the love we think\nwe deserve do you think it's almost\nsubconscious sometimes like triggered by\nmaybe traumas or just a subconscious\nthing it's not always something that\npeople are aware of oh yeah like I think\nthere's a huge disconnect sometimes\nbetween our logic and our emotion and\nwhat we think and what we feel because\nif you look at uh brain biology right\nand you look at neural Pathways and how\nthese things develop across time you can\nhave light bulb moments and insights\nwhen you grow and mature\nbut in a high pressure situation or in\nan emotional situation you're going to\ndefault to childhood\nyou're going to default to the emotional\nlike so if I was raised by abusive\nparents I may believe I'm worthless and\nwhen there's a problem or somebody else\nis angry I caused it\nright and I can learn as an adult excuse\nme I might sneeze here on the air I'll\nbe looking at the lights okay\nexcuse me bless you\nthank you\nI may I may learn as an adult\nno of course a child's not responsible\nfor the behavior of their parents right\nand no of course I'm not worthless\nbecause everybody has worth and I may I\nmay\naccept that on a logical level but on\nthe deeper level\nemotionally I still feel like I'm\nworthless because that that's what I had\nfrom childhood and so how do we how do\nwe merge the two is being aware is\nbringing the subconscious into the\nconscious\nis when you feel triggered when you feel\noverwhelmed or flooded or sad or\nself-loathing\nto not just accept your\nsubjective\nuh feelings as objective reality\nright and so so to be able to say okay I\nfeel worthless and that feels a hundred\npercent true to me\nbut just because I feel it's true does\nthat mean it actually is true\nright and to be able to challenge it and\nsay what am I going to replace that with\nI like to compare neural Pathways\num and your psych2go audience knows all\nabout neural Pathways I imagine some\nplaces I have to explain this more which\nis fine but like I like to compare them\nto hiking trails in the brain right and\nthe more Trail gets hiked on the more\nwell-worn it is the more naturally you\nknow in this case uh the neurons but but\nthe more naturally the hikers just tend\nto gravitate that way and to create a\nnew Trail takes a lot of work and you're\nnaturally going to gravitate towards\nwhat was there before until you use the\nneutral enough that the old one gets\ngrown over from disuse right and the\nbrush and the everything in the grass\ncovers it and it's the same way with\nwith our thoughts and with our feelings\nabout ourselves and so it's not enough\nto have a light bulb moment in most\ncases you have to follow up that light\nbulb moment with continually\nshepherding the brain right towards\ntowards the new Trail and towards I had\nthis I had this insight about who I am\nand who I want to be and my relationship\nwith the world\nand I I know it's true cognitively but\nemotionally I find myself struggling to\nbelieve it\nand it just takes practice of of of\ndeliberate redirecting and so that's why\nlists are really handy like the negative\nthoughts and the positive thoughts and\nwhat you're going to replace with and\nit's not just replacing a negative\nthought with a positive thought because\nif the positive thought is BS then your\nbrain's going to reject it you have to\nreplace it you have to replace it with a\npositive thought that's real\nand sometimes the positive thought\nthat's real\nis I can be better\nbecause if if you try and say I'm you\nknow let's say I have a problem like\nscreaming at my kids I could tell myself\nwell I'm a great dad all day long but\nthe brain is going to reject that\nbecause it has all of this evidence of\nthese negative experiences but the\npositive thought I can replace it with\nis\nI have it every Power Within me to be\ndifferent\nand that's empowering that is empowering\nI agree with that like you have to and I\nI think that what people need to\nunderstand that a lot of the times\nhaving a strong you know self-identity\nand strong self of sense of self and\nself-love is a journey it's a process\nit's not just something that's like this\nI mean maybe for some people it's easy\nbut for most of us it's a process of\nlearning and it's practice like what you\nmentioned yeah and and self-love isn't\nselfish\nand sometimes selfish behaviors we we\nact selfishly in the name of self-love\nbut what what is self-love it's\nrecognizing that other people matter\nif I'm going to if I'm going to be there\nfor other people I have to be there for\nmyself first so I have something in the\ntank\nlike just recently I've started\ndisciplining myself to get up because I\nwas feeling old old and out of shape and\nit wasn't the Aesthetics of how I looked\nit was more just how I felt right and I\nfound myself grumpy and irritable and\nhaving a hard time focusing and So\nlately I've been prioritizing getting up\nearly and going to the gym and I tell\npeople exercise for sanity not for\nvanity like swimsuit season whatever the\npsychologically the reason to exercise\nis so you're sharp and so you're calm\nand so you're at peace and so and and\nyou have the discipline and just that\none simple act has completely changed\nit's not completely that's an\nexaggeration it's majorly changed my\nrelationships it's changed\nthe level of whether I feel resentment\ntowards the people in my life for taking\nmy time which I shouldn't because I\nchose to have them in my life but if I'm\nnot taking care of myself their very\nexistence is a is a burden which wow\nthey're not but you know what I mean and\nthat and that's and let me be clear\nthey're not a burden but I could feel\nthat way about them if I'm not looking\nafter myself and the beautiful thing\nabout loving yourself like truly loving\nyourself is it allows you to love others\nmore completely\nwow that's powerful could you say that\nagain for everyone in the room sure\nsorry I've got the air vent right\nunderneath me and it's blowing dust\nparticles\nthe best part of loving yourself of\ntruly loving yourself is it empowers you\nto love others it's like a tool to love\nothers more profoundly deeply and holy\nright yes because if you're just trying\nif your life is all about loving others\nwhat I've discovered is sometimes you do\nthat because you want others to validate\nyou or see you as a good person or you\nwant them to you want the kickback of\ntheir appreciation or their gratitude\nand so it's not it's not genuine real\nlove\nit's kind of selfish whereas if I don't\nneed others to fill that need for me if\nI genuinely fill it for myself then\nanything they give me in reciprocation\nis a bonus and it's it's a wonderful\nthing\nbut even if they never do I know who I\nam yeah and\nit helps me to make sure that my love is\nactual love instead of\nI could put quid pro quo right so for\npeople pleasing yeah yeah\nthis is only tangentially related to\ntoxic relationships but I think it's\ntalking about how to build a healthy\nrelationship so we're still yeah\nabsolutely that's I mean the positive\nand the negative right this is perfect\nso now we're gonna go to the audience\nquestions segment so the first question\nI have is from Sierra she asks what's\nthe best way to intervene when someone\nyou love is in a toxic relationship\nyou know that word intervention\nwe usually use it to mean that you're\nnot able to manage your own life anymore\nand for your own good we're taking the\nreins of your free will from you and I'm\nnot saying that's never the right thing\nto do\num I'm saying you got to be careful\nbecause\nmost often that'll backfire\nmost often what's going to happen is if\nyou try and intervene and sabotage a\nrelationship you're going to lose your\nability to connect with influence be\nthere for that person and they're going\nto go deeper into the abusive\nrelationship\num\nthe best way to to intervene is just to\nspeak your mind\nI one of my favorite phrases uh not in\ntherapy as much but just in like my\npersonal relationships with people\nis I'm gonna say this once and then I'm\ngoing to leave it alone\nbecause generally speaking I don't like\nto intervene in people's lives unless\nthey invite me to right in therapy I've\ngot I've got the I've got the invitation\nexcuse me I got a little sniffle now in\ntherapy I've got the invitation\num\nin personal lives it's harder because\nyou can be interpreted as a know-it-all\nwho's\nsick in their nose where it doesn't\nbelong right speaking of which excuse me\num\nand so what I like to say is\nI'm going to say this once and I'm going\nto leave it alone\nI'm also coming at this from my own\nperspective so take that for what it's\nworth I'm concerned and here's why\nand then speak your piece\nand\nand you can even own up front like you\ncould strip away any reason for\ndefensiveness\nyou could say things like I may not have\nall the information I only have my\nperspective like things like that\nuh decrease and diminish people's need\nto push back against you and increase\nthat they're going to hear you\nand then I would just say\nI want you to know like out of respect\nfor you I'm not gonna beat this drum\nbecause you're a grown person you can\nmake your own choices I also want you to\nknow that if this ever goes sideways or\nif you ever decide you know to be done\nwith this relationship\nI don't want you to feel like I'm gonna\nsay I told you so or give you a hard\ntime\nwhether you stay in this relationship or\nnot\nI'm your ride or die I'm here for you\nso don't don't hesitate to use me you're\nnot a burden\nI love that phrase you're not a burden I\nlove that yeah because so many people\ndon't reach out for help because they\ndon't want to be a burden and what I\ntell those people is why would you deny\nsomeone the chance to love you\nright that's so true because if they're\nif they're your friend they want to be\nthere for you right if they're if\nthey're a friend or family like and and\nby family I mean that in terms of um of\ncloseness and love not blood because you\ncan have family that's not really family\nand you can have friends that are\ndefinitely family wow yeah that's true\nI'm I'm blessed to have both but like if\nthey're truly family\nthey want to be there for you\none of the hardest things for me is my\nmom had a lot of health problems before\nshe passed away and she kept them from\nthe kids even a lot of them from the\nkids even though we were adults and I\nremember that made me so mad\nbecause she wanted to protect us and\nspare us and didn't want us to worry and\nI'm like we're worried anyways\nand we're adults we don't need you to\ntake care of us anymore\nyou're denying us the opportunity to be\nthere for you the way you were there for\nus I remember I told her this and then\nwe had a few years where she started to\nlet me know more of all the stuff she's\ngoing through and it was good like even\nthough she passed away\nI was glad to have the time to be there\nfor her so anybody who's watching this\ndon't underestimate people's desire to\nbe there for you\nso beautiful because healing happens on\nboth sides in that situation like you\nguys are able to heal also your mom as\nwell\nyeah\nI apologize folks I I have I\nI have ADHD and so I go off on tangents\ndon't apologize no well you're giving\namazing advice\nI okay thank you I I do feel like I keep\nstraying from the topic because I'm like\noh this might be helpful or oh that\nmight be helpful but no when it when it\ncomes to our YouTube channels afterwards\nwe we filmed these episodes or we film\nthese videos and then we go over them\nand we and Alan has ADHD too and so our\npoor editors like afterwards we're like\nyeah let's get rid of all of this let's\nlet's keep this and it feels more\nstreamlined but if you ever actually\ninteract with Alan or I it's a bit more\nlike when you're when you're an expert\nand you're full of advice and knowledge\nit can be hard because you just want to\nput it all out there right\nyou're\nkind to say so and thank you that is no\nthere's there's truth to that like\nI just want to help yeah of course and\nso Brianna asks how do you recognize\ntoxic traits in yourself this is a great\nquestion okay uh and Brianna and\neverybody else because I've been\nMeandering I'm going to start giving\nshorter answers so I can get to more of\nthe questions so I apologize I don't\neven feel jilted how can you recognize\nuh\nlearn about them this so the book is how\nto avoid falling in love with a jerk I\ntaught that course by Dr John Van Epp I\ntaught that course in the community and\nI can't tell you how many people came to\nthat course because they thought they\ndated a bunch of jerks and then they're\nlike I just realized taking this course\nthat I'm the jerk and I have work to do\num so I think I think learning about the\ntraits and then here's the really hard\none\num listening to people when they tell\nyou because oftentimes they're\nthey're speaking to the behavior\nand you're speaking to your intentions\nright and so when someone tells you that\nyou're being a jerk or When someone\ntells you that what you're doing is\ntoxic or harmful you're probably quick\nto say no it's not because you know that\nyour intentions are quite the opposite\nright it's like the mother in um\nuh what's the seeing red no turning red\nuh the Disney if you've seen that uh\nit's like the mother in turning red\nor or in everything everywhere all at\nonce same thing\num where these mothers can't for a long\ntime see themselves as toxic and even\nsometimes abusive because their heart's\nin the right place and they can't\nimagine that what they're doing is\ncausing harm\noh wow that's a great point\nand so and so how do you recognize talk\nto trace and toxic traits in yourself\nI've never met a toxic a person who was\ndisplaying toxic behaviors who at least\nearly on saw that their behaviors were\ntoxic right all of them thought I'm\ndoing good I'm trying to help\nthis is needed this is right right\nyeah so I think you need we need to\nlisten to other people and that doesn't\nmean that if someone says something you\njust accept it as truth but you\nshouldn't dismiss it out of hand either\nI have learned I've always seen myself\nas a as a good person because I am a\ngood person like I try and do right by\nothers and I try and help and I try and\nbe kind of compassionate but something\nI've learned the past couple years uh in\nmy marriage speaking of the the video\nseries I'm doing with my wife on men\nDelight right now is I had major blind\nspots of\nselfishness\nand\num\nand dishonesty\nand they started with being dishonest\nwith myself\nand because I believed myself to be such\na good person\nwhen she told me when my wife told me\nI'm like what the hell are you even\ntalking about\nwho are you talking to like what is this\nthis isn't me and it took a long time\nfor me like to clear the cobwebs of my\nown my own\num to clear the cobwebs of my own\nperspective and see hers and so exactly\nyeah I think it's the ability to\nself-reflect as well like always\nreminding yourself okay what I mean\nthere are things that I do wrong I need\nto assess myself I wanted you to see\nthis John though um Oni said my mom has\nbreast cancer and did something similar\nto us so your random gem helped me out a\nlot thank you John\nthank you thank you only girl and please\nplease give your mom doesn't know me so\nif I say give my love to your mother\nshe'll be like who's that and who cares\nshe'll be like thanks but give my love\nto your mother um she could watch this\nwhich sounds like a schoolyard insult\nnow that I hear it coming out of my\nmouth anyways we'll keep moving okay\nokay\num before you go to the next question\nthe tricky thing about self-reflection\nis even that could be taken to an\nextreme where now it's a neurosis and\nyou're obsessively thinking did I do the\nright thing did I say the right thing or\nmy motivation's right and then here's\nthe thing about mental health guys we're\nall messed up in one way or another\nright we're all it's just different from\nperson to person and when people say\nthis is what I think and feel is that\nnormal I always tell them the same thing\nwhich is there's no such thing as normal\nso just embrace our Collective Beauty\nand our Collective Brokenness and then\nwe just work through it as best we can\nexactly do you see this one I wanted to\nhide it NORAD asks how do I distance\nmyself from someone who is being too\ntoxic I always feel like I'm hurting\nhurting them even though it's hurting me\nby staying around that energy which I\nthink we can all relate to that it can\nbe so hard to leave\num\nhere's what I would say\nit will hurt them\nbut your job isn't to spare the people\nyou love pain I'm reminded of Marlon in\nFinding Nemo when he's like I promise\nthat I would never let anything happen\nto him and Dory says well that's a funny\nthing to promise if you never let\nanything happen to him then nothing will\never happen to him\nthe fact is relationships are a Gamble\nand\nC.S Lewis and others have said that pain\nis the price that we paid to experience\nlove\nright and you can live without you can't\nreally live without pain but you can\nminimize Pain by living without love but\nthen what's the quality of life of that\nright\num exactly and and so and so\nif you're in a relationship with someone\nand it's toxic\nand it's demeaning to your let me let me\nfind the exact phrase because I like\nthis phrase a lot\na prolonged I've heard someone say like\nwhat's just cause for breaking up or\njust cause for divorce it's a prolonged\nand apparently irredeemable relationship\nthat is destructive of a person's\ndignity as a human being\nwow if being in this relationship is\ndestructive of your dignity\nI I applaud you for your selfless\nconcern for the other person\nbut this is a virtue turned into a vice\nright that that level of of selfless\nsacrifice\ncomes to an extreme where it's now\nsomething that not only hurts you but\nlet's say you don't really care too much\nabout it hurting you you're worried\nabout the other person well it's hurting\nthem\nbecause they're now with somebody who\nevery day wishes they weren't\nmm-hmm right\nand so\nso I I build a lot of media references\nbut stinging the police if you love\nsomeone set them free\nI think that staying means nothing\nunless someone's free to leave and so\nyou have to make yourself free to leave\nif this if this relationship isn't going\nto work\nit's a mercy to end it sooner rather\nthan later\nyeah and pain is a part of life but it's\nknowing when to walk away and so I like\nthat point that you made because you\ncan't completely avoid pain right I mean\nit's just a part of The Human Experience\nright yeah and the person that you're\nwith that you're concerned about maybe\nthis will be the wake-up call they need\nexactly\nthey'll always regret hurting you and\nlosing you but now they're like oh this\nis what happens when I act like this\nsometimes people change sometimes they\ndig deeper into their bitterness and\ntheir View and their views on the world\nbut that's not really up to you\nexactly and so it's going to be the last\nquestion the last audience question how\ncan you help someone who's a narcissist\nbut doesn't realize it when you talk\nwith them about it and then they get mad\noh wow\nokay there's a shorter version and a\nlonger version\nthe shorter version is\nremove\nthe expectation from yourself\nthat it's your duty to\noh I was gonna say duty to help them but\nI'll actually change that to strip\nyourself of expectations of outcomes\nthere there is no one right way\nand there are people that you could do\neverything right you could do it in the\nyou can in the healthiest way possible\nyou could and there there's too many\nwalls there\nthere's too many walls of\nself-protection and in case of a\nnarcissist\nthere's this fear of if I am wrong or if\nI've made mistakes then that's weakness\nand so I can't be wrong and I can't make\nmistakes uh and so how someone like that\nyou're fighting this endless battle to\nget them to acknowledge that they've\ndone wrong that they've made a mistake\nthat they're flawed and they are deeply\ndeeply invested\nin not coming to that conclusion and so\nthey'll fight you tooth and nail\nand so the question to ask yourself is\nnot how can I get them to see it\nthe question to ask yourself is what is\nmy side right what is out of human\nkindness what can I say\nso that at least this thought is planted\nin their mind that they may recall later\nthat it may come back to them later and\nhelp them\num\nyou can say to someone like that\nand I and I guess you you said they're a\nnarcissist and they won't see it even\nwhen you tell them well maybe don't tell\nthem they're a narcissist\nbecause they don't see themselves as a\nnarcissist so they're going to reject\nthat and it's maybe try a different\napproach of talking about is this\nworking like okay let me tell you the\nbehavior of yours that that hurts me and\npushes me away and makes me not want to\nbe around you\nand you can tell me what you're trying\nto accomplish with that behavior\nand then I'll tell you what you can do\nthat would actually give you that result\nright so essentially remove the labels\nand just discuss the behavior yeah I\nlove that yeah it's more effective\nyeah so thank you these are great\nquestions yeah amazing we have amazing\nviewers so thank you for those questions\nto everyone watching and um so these are\ngoing to be the last questions it's\nmental health awareness month and so I\njust wanted to ask since you're a mental\nhealth professional how do we eliminate\nthe stigma around seeking mental health\ntreatment\nI think the more we talk about it uh\nthe more we talk about it\npersonally not using third person\nlanguage talking about somebody else\ngoing to therapy that\nhere's our I guess here's the hard thing\nI can't ask this as a therapist but I\ncan't ask this as a person as a\ntherapist I could never ask one of my\nclients to speak publicly about going to\ntherapy right because I don't have the\nright to ask them that what I can say is\nthat the people who do normalize it\nuh Karen uh Gillen or Gillum I can't\nremember her last name but uh she plays\nnebula in Guardians of the Galaxy she's\nalso in the in the Jumanji movies uh she\ndid a post recently that just I loved it\nso much in my geeky therapist heart just\nloved this post\nshe shared a screenshot of a day that\nshe was filming Guardians of the Galaxy\nin full nebula makeup and she forgot\nthat she had a couples therapy session\nwith her husband and so she didn't have\ntime to take the makeup off off like she\nrushed from the set and it was virtual\nand so like they scratch out the\ntherapist space so you could but it's\nher and her husband and then a therapist\nwith a face scratched out and she's in\ncouples therapy\nas nebula with the makeup oh my God\nhey my husband and I go to couples\ntherapy and I have no problem owning\nthat before the world that that's a\nhealthy beautiful thing to do\nand there are quite a few there are\nquite a few celebrities who do that\num\nat mended light we have merch that says\ngoing to therapy is cool like on water\nbottles and stickers and decals and\nstuff I love that but just just the idea\nof you know we don't find shame in going\nto the dentist\nmy teeth needed work we don't find shame\nin going to a cardiologist right but for\nsome reason when it comes to the brain\nor when it comes to the heart\nfiguratively speaking there's all sorts\nof Shame around that like strong people\nshouldn't have to go but I think we're\nwe're moving past the age of stoicism\nwhere where you can't\nwhere you can't acknowledge\nvulnerability where you can't\nacknowledge mistakes where you can't\nacknowledge\nstruggles uh that that's human and the\nmore the more any of us do it like I've\ngone to therapy I'll tell you that right\nnow I'm the therapist and I've gone to\ntherapy I'm I'm the therapist and I've\nneeded to work on my marriage right I\nlike\nlife is hard emotions are hard\nthe mental illness is hard\nand no one's immune even you called me\nan expert like the fact is it's it's\nreally easy\nIt's relatively easy when it's not my\nlife when it's not my emotions when it's\nnot my issues\nI'm frankly pretty good at what I do\nand I'm not saying like I've got this\nterrible family life or I'm or anything\nlike that like I love my wife I love my\nkids what I'm saying is\nwe've all got struggles and we need to\nnormalize that so that it's not scary to\ntalk about because people feel alone\nwhen they can't when they feel like\nnobody else is going through this\nor they think everyone who's going\nthrough this is super messed up and so I\nguess I'm just one of these messed up\npeople and that's why I tell everyone to\nembrace that we're all messed up it's\njust it just looks different from person\nto person\nand their strength and power and\nvulnerability I think people need to\nremember that and so thank you so much\nJonathan for being here we really\nappreciate it\num thank you for all of the viewers for\nasking their questions and I hope that\neveryone has an amazing day thank you\nthank you thank you all Take Care thank\nyou"
