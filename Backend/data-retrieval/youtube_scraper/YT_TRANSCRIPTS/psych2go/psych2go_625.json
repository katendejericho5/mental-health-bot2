    "transcript": "are they feeling it too are you feeling\na bit of sexual attention with someone\nbut can't tell if they feel the same way\naccording to Zana rangalova PhD and\nAdjunct professor of human sexuality at\nNew York University it is absolutely\npossible for one person to feel like\nthey have sexual chemistry with someone\nand for that feeling not to be\nreciprocated so where do you even begin\nto tell if someone reciprocates that\nfeeling well you could always ask them\nand communicating your feelings about\nthem could be a good idea but if you're\nlooking for a few hints first to tell if\nthey feel it too then you're in the\nright place but what really is sexual\nchemistry according to Dr vangelova\nsexual chemistry is the very strong but\nineffable feeling that you feel in your\nbody when you're attracted to someone\nand Rachel Hoffman explained to Insider\nthat when you feel a magnetic pull or\nspark towards someone when you're not\nengaging in physical intimacy this is\nwhat we call sexual tension but not\neveryone experiences sexual attention as\nquickly as others rangalova explains in\nan article in shape that demisexuals who\noften experience sexual desire for\nsomeone only when an emotional\nrelationship is first present may not\nhave sexual chemistry with one person\nuntil a year or more into their\nemotionally strong relationship so it's\ndifferent for everyone but when it does\nhappen there are some common signs what\nare these signs you may ask well here\nare seven common signs someone may feel\nsexual tension with you words left unset\nevery time you depart with this specific\nindividual it always feels like there's\nsomething they wanted to say but are\nheld back a bit of hesitancy and then\nmoving on it may feel like you both want\nto scream out I like you but silence\nseems so much easier to you both right\nnow according to an article from\nHealthline this could be a deliberate\ntactic to lean due to making a move or\nit could be them getting tempted to take\nthings further but checking it out\nperhaps it's time to ask them out on a\nromantic date to see if they feel the\nsame way about you no silence instead\nyeah okay they're so funny wait they're\nnot though oh Pablo you're so funny why\ndid the chicken cross the road to get to\nthe other side\nyour anti-humor wait who's Pablo he's my\nimaginary boyfriend to provide context\nto this situation yeah chickens crossing\nthe road may not be funny when someone\nelse is telling the joke but when Pablo\ngets to that punch line you're laughing\nwith tears in your eyes\nbelow point being they're funnier to you\nbecause you're attracted to them\nresearcher and award-winning sex\neducator Justin lamellar PhD explains in\nmen's health that when people feel an\noverwhelming attraction to each other a\nlot of positive affect tends to be\nexchanged and that includes frequent\nSmiles ever find yourself stuck in a\nsmile or giggle anytime you look at your\ncrush limiller explains that smiling is\na natural response when someone makes\nyou feel good then it creates this\nfeedback loop where one person smiles\nand that gets the other to smile even\nmore limiter notes it's also the case\nthat when you're really into another\nperson you tend to think all of their\njokes are funnier\npart of flutter\never feel your heart pick up the pace as\nsoon as you spot your crush according to\nHealthline attraction causes a boost in\nthe chemicals oxytocin dopamine and\nnorepinephrine this surge of chemicals\ncan make you feel euphoric and cause\nphysical reactions like making your\nheart race faster next time you give\nyour crush a big old hug maybe you'll be\nable to pick up on just how fast their\nheart is beating normal\na pause and a gaze do you both hold eye\ncontact a bit longer than with others\nwhen you look into each other's eyes\ndoes it feel more like a gaze if there's\nthat lingering moment before turning\naway from each other's eyes they may\njust like you or perhaps quickly looking\naway when your crush meets your eyes is\nyour go-to Healthline explains that the\nkoi gaze where you make eye contact and\nthen look away as a common non-verbal\nflirting cue according to a 2014 study\nthat looked at flirting Styles so make\nsome eye contact turn away to let them\nknow you like them but then look back at\nthem to make sure they know you do like\nthem and aren't just staring off into\nspace or something you know because that\nhappens flirting can be so confusing a\ntouch here or there ever feel a gentle\nbrush from your crush's hand how about a\nlingering hug Rachel Hoffman explained\nto Insider that when someone likes you\nhe'll put his hands around your back\nwhen he's talking or maybe he guides you\nthrough a crowded bar she adds that if\nhe reaches for your hand then you can\nalmost guarantee that he's into you does\nthat guy you like put their arm around\nyou on the couch or does that girl you\nhave feelings for grab your hand to lead\nyou towards that party they may just be\nattracted to you palms are sweaty not\nmom's spaghetti let's say you finally\nask your crush out so you go out to an\nItalian dinner with them romance is in\nthe air you always get a little heated\nwhen you're eating your favorite Italian\nDish but this time it's different you're\nnot excited about the spaghetti with the\nperson sitting across from you if you\nnotice your palms are pretty sweaty it's\nlikely due to the sexual tension you may\nbe feeling according to Healthline\nnorepinephrine is also a major player on\nyour body's fight or flight response\nwhich is why you sweat when you get all\nworked up around someone you're sexually\nattracted to flirting\nof course a common sign of sexual\ntension is flirting this isn't to say\nflirting has to be present in order for\nthere to be sexual tension but it\ncertainly helps keep those sparks flying\ndo you notice they keep the flirty\nbanter going who starts the flirty\nconversation according to Healthline\nteasing each other is a common flirting\ntactic that people use to provoke\nplayfulness so get playful gift
