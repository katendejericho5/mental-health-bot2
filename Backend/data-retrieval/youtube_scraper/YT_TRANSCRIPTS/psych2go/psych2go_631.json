    "transcript": "there's a quote from the TV show BoJack\nHorseman written by showrunner Raphael\nBob waxberg that goes when you look at\nsomeone through rose-colored glasses\nwhile the red flags just look like flags\nand though the original context talks\nabout red flags and romantic\nrelationships the same can certainly be\ntrue for ourselves too don't you think\nbecause as hard as it is sometimes to\nspot the warning signs in our own\nrelationships and in the people we love\nit might be even harder to spot them in\nourselves because of our Tendencies to\nempathize and rationalize with our own\nchoices and actions with that said here\nare six red flags you need to look out\nfor in yourself according to experts\nnumber one unconstructive self-talk\npsychologist Dr Elizabeth Scott defines\nnegative self-talk as any inner dialogue\nyou have with yourself that may be\nlimiting your ability to believe in\nyourself and your own abilities and to\nreach your potential in fact research by\nkinderman schwanner pondin and Thai\nfound that negative self-talk increases\nthe risk of mental health problems such\nas decreased motivation feelings of\nhelpless business and even depression so\nif you are guilty of constantly putting\nyourself down and having a lot of\nself-deprecating thoughts even the ones\nyou pass off as jokes then talking to a\nprofessional or applying effective CBT\ntechniques for example thought stopping\nmindfulness Etc can help you minimize\nthis 2. neurotic need for social\nvalidation do you feel that you're too\nmuch of a people-pleaser does your\nself-esteem often go up and down\ndepending on other people's opinions and\nfeelings towards you perhaps you feel a\nstrong need to always get everyone else\nto like you regardless of whether or not\nyou even like them all of these are\nsigns that you may have a neurotic need\nfor social validation and this is a red\nflag because according to mental health\nand wellness author Marissa pomerantz\npeople with too high a need for social\nvalidation often have low self-esteem\nand stay in or even chase after\nunhealthy one-sided friendships and\nrelationships neurotic need for control\nconstantly needing to fix other people's\nproblems for them running to their\nrescue even when you don't want to in\nmicromanaging everyone around you are\nall not only red flags but telltale\nsigns that you may have a neurotic need\nfor control according to Dr Christine\nAdams in an article for psychology today\npeople who struggle with this most\nlikely grapple with strong feelings of\nhelplessness and to cope become overly\ndemanding in their way of relating to\nother people number four toxic\nperfectionism related to the earlier\nPoint Dr Christine Adams also talks\nabout something she calls self-control\nfreaks or what is more commonly known as\ntoxic perfectionism the problem\naccording to Dr Adams is that people\nlike this expect themselves to perform\nperfectly and without error and as such\nare only setting themselves up for\nfailure and disappointment this is not\nonly a definite red flag and a weakness\nbut a harmful habit for your mental\nhealth number five avoidant attachment\nin an article from betterhelp which was\nmedically reviewed by licensed clinical\nsocial worker April Justice people with\navoidant attachment Styles tend to be\nemotionally detached and closed off they\noften feel uncomfortable with long-term\ncloseness and Intimacy in relationships\nas a result their knee-jerk response is\nto a avoid the other person or manifest\nother self-sabotaging behaviors such as\ncheating ghosting and never asking for\nhelp instead of communicating with the\nother person and collaborating on\nresolving the issue with them and number\nsix social media addiction another red\nflag you might not realize you have is\nsocial media addiction researchers like\nwho and others found in a 2019 study\nthat it negatively affected college\nstudents mental health and academic\nperformance an article from Healthline\nwritten by Medical Health practitioners\nDr Christine cherny and Dr Timothy Legg\nfound that some possible downsides of\ntoo much social media consumption are\nlow self-esteem increased feelings of\nloneliness anxiety or depression the\nonset of social anxiety disorder\ndisrupted sleep patterns decreased\nphysical activity ignoring real life\nrelationships and reduced ability to\nempathize with others so do you see any\nof these red flags in yourself let us\nknow in the comments below if the answer\nis yes then know that you're not alone\nmost of us are struggling with at least\none or more of these what matters most\nisn't that we strive for Perfection but\nfor growth and self-development and as\nwith any other challenge we encounter\nthe first step to overcoming it is to\nacknowledge the problem Dr itai itsen a\npositive psychologist in professor at\nnaropa University suggests that we can\nchange ourselves for the better in a\ngradual three-step process of setting\ngoals for ourselves over three weeks\nwith increasing difficulty but of course\nif you are seriously struggling with any\nmental health concerns do not hesitate\nto reach out to a psychologist or a\ncounselor today and get the help and\nsupport you need and deserve"
