    "transcript": "your brain is your body's Powerhouse of\ncognition and is one of the vital organs\nessential for your survival but did you\nknow that there are habits that can kill\nyour brain we're not just talking\npsychologically but also physically some\nhabits can degrade neurons and worsen\ncommunication between them slowly\ndegrading your brain tissue and making\nyou more susceptible to Serious\nneurodegenerative diseases being aware\nof some of these habits can be helpful\nin keeping your brain in Optimal Health\nwith that said here are seven harmful\nhabits that kill your brain\nnot giving it a challenge how often do\nyou challenge your mind did you know\nthat failing to engage in mentally\nstimulating activities can lead to\ndecreased cognitive function and memory\nloss according to the National Institute\nof Aging older adults who participate in\nmentally stimulating activities such as\nvolunteering or taking an educational\ncourse have improved cognitive function\ncompared to those who do not engage in\nsimilar activities furthermore according\nto researchers from the Albert Einstein\nCollege of Medicine engaging in new and\nmentally stimulating activities in an\nenriching environment can increase the\ngrowth of new neurons in the brain and\nstrengthen existing connections so try\nstimulating your brain more often\nwhether it be by learning something new\nplaying a game of chess or reading a\ngood book it's better than not doing\nanything at all not hydrating\nmake sure you stay hydrated is something\nthat you probably hear all the time but\nhydration has its benefits especially\nfor brain health according to\nneurosurgeon Dr Imran fayas prolonged\ndehydration can cause your brain to\nshrink in size and mass which is a\ncondition common to the elderly who have\nbeen dehydrated for many years\ndehydration can also decrease blood flow\nto the brain leading to decreased oxygen\nand nutrient delivery this can result in\nreduced brain function and increased\nrisk of developing neurological problems\nthe brain itself is made up of 85 water\nwhich gives the brain energy to function\ncontinuously hydrating means that you'll\nbe able to think faster have better\nfocus and greater Clarity so be sure to\nkeep a water bottle handy and make sure\nyou're hitting hydration targets a good\nGeneral amount according to Healthline\nis to drink eight cups of water daily\nyou'll be doing a favor for your brain\nand your body not addressing chronic\nstress you find yourself pushing away\nsome of your stress without actually\naddressing it work or life just piles up\non you and you just shove all of your\nfeelings away sound like you\nsometimes you might find yourself so\noverwhelmed or busy that you forget\nyou're stressed in the moment not\nrealizing that you're chronically\nstressed and therefore not addressing it\ncan possibly lead to harmful changes in\nyour brain according to an article by Dr\nSonya J lupian and others at the\nUniversity of Montreal chronic stress\ncan lead to changes in brain structure\nand function including decreased brain\nvolume reduced neuroplasticity and\naltered neurotransmitter levels chronic\nstress has also been linked to increased\nrisk of developing mental health\nproblems such as depression and anxiety\na study published in the Journal of\nNeuroscience also found that chronic\nstress can lead to decreased\nneuroplasticity which is the ability of\nthe brain to change and adapt in\nresponse to new experiences this can\nresult in decreased cognitive function\nand increased risk of developing\nneurological problems\nconsuming too much salt\never get hungry for foods like chips\nPizza steak and salted nuts eating too\nmuch salt might actually not be the best\nfor your brain a 2019 study by a teen\nled by researchers at will Cornell\nmedicine found that high levels of\ndietary salt caused a chemical change to\na protein called Tau this change called\nphosphorylation causes Tau to Clump\ntogether in the brain which is\nassociated with types of dementia\nincluding Alzheimer's disease sometimes\nsustainable diet changes can go a long\nway in impacting your brain health\nconsuming less salt can actually be\nbeneficial by lowering your risk to\nthese neurological diseases\nmultitasking are you a multitasker and\noften try to do many things at once\ndifferent people handle multitasking in\ndifferent ways while some may have no\nproblem with it others can find it to be\nvery difficult despite the fact that\nworking on multiple things at once can\ncause the quality of the work to suffer\nour growing digital world has made\nmultitasking more prevalent Studies by\nMador and others of Stanford new\ndiversity have shown that multitasking\ncan lead to decreased attention and\ndecreased ability to process information\neffectively this can result in decreased\ncognitive function and an increased risk\nof poor short-term and long-term memory\nmultitasking has also been discussed to\nhave permanent effects on the brain a\nstudy from the University of Sussex\nperformed MRIs on the brains of people\nwho spent time on multiple devices at\nonce e MRI scans found that those\nsubjects who multitasked had less brain\ndensity in their anterior cingulate\ncortex the area Central for empathy and\nemotional control\nwhenever possible it's best to try to\nfocus on one thing at a time that way\nyour cognitive ability and performance\nwould be enhanced and you'd be able to\ndo things better\ntoo much screen time you know that\nglaring device you seem to have your\neyes on all day all the time think about\nhow much you use it it turns out\naccording to research by Dr Gaia Dowling\nhaving too much screen time is not great\nfor your eyes or your brain health\nstudies have found that excessive screen\ntime can actually make changes to the\nbrain structure and function in a study\nof over 4 000 children who used\nelectronics for more than seven hours a\nday the cortex which is the outer layer\nof the brain that processes external\ninformation was found to be thinner\ncompared to those who used screens less\nwhile specific outcomes from cortex\nthinning are not yet known it goes to\nshow how much screen time can affect\none's brain and decreased cortex sizes\nare often associated with decreased\ncognitive function and an increased risk\nof mental health problems\nslouching poor posture\nare you hunched over right now watching\nthis video if you are maybe try sitting\nup straight\n posture can actually impact brain\nhealth because it reduces flow to the\nbrain according to researchers Garrett\nPearson and sabuti at the University of\nColorado when you slouch or hunch over\nyou can press the veins and arteries\nthat bring blood to the brain which can\nlead to decreased oxygen and nutrient\ndelivered to the brain harming your\nbrain health moreover a study by San\nFrancisco State University examined how\nstudents were called past experiences\ngood and bad they were told to recall\nmemories twice once while slouching and\nonce while sitting up straight the study\nfound that 86 percent of the students\nfound it easier to recall negative\nexperiences when slouched on the other\nhand 87 percent of the students found it\neasier to recall positive experiences\nwhen sitting up straight\nso by improving our posture you might\njust be doing a favor for your brain and\nmental health\nand there you have it seven harmful\nhabits that kill your brain do you\nrecognize any of these habits any of\nthem catch your eye recognizing these\nharmful habits and doing your best to\nchange them can be helpful for your\nbrain health in the future as always\nplease remember to
