    "transcript": "intelligence is multifaceted while we\ntend to think about smart people as\nthose who are studious and have perfect\ngrades it turns out there's a lot more\nto it than that intelligence can range\nfrom your ability to create music play\nsports to how you understand yourself\nand much more an important type of\nintelligence in particular is social\nknowing how to work effectively with\nothers while managing and communicating\nyour feelings is extremely important but\nhow can you tell if you're skilled in\nthis area in this video we will be\nlooking at some signs of high social\nintelligence what is social intelligence\npsychologist Dr Sandeep atra an expert\non social intelligence describes it as\nthe ability to observe and interpret\npeople's emotions and non-verbals in\ncommunication\nthis means you're able to understand\nwhat people are feeling and trying to\nsay which allows you to communicate\neffectively with them he states that\nthis leads to Greater interpersonal\nEffectiveness and self-management\nnow that we know how social intelligence\nis defined let's look at how we can\nidentify it\nhigh in emotional intelligence as we\nmentioned earlier intelligence comes in\nseveral different forms one form is your\nemotional intelligence known as EQ and\nit is defined by Healthline as the\nability to use your emotions\nconstructively this has to do with your\ncapacity to empathize with others manage\nyour feelings and healthily express your\nemotions\nas you know social intelligence deals\nwith the ability to interpret social\nsituations and act wisely in them so\nhaving a high level of EQ will\ndefinitely come in handy psychotherapist\nAmy Morin explains that high EQ\ninfluences your ability to act in social\nsituations especially when strong\nfeelings are involved\nfortunately emotional intelligence is\nhighly malleable meaning that even if\nyou have a low EQ there are ways for you\nto improve it for example according to\nvery well mind you can improve EQ by\ntaking time to practice listening to\nothers empathizing with them and\nreflecting on your interactions with\nthem understanding how others tick\ncommunication is complicated there are\nso many unspoken rules that you can\nbreak without knowing sometimes even\nwithout saying anything at all people\nwith high social intelligence are great\nat reading the room they know what words\nto say and how to use them therapist Amy\nMoran states that people skilled in this\narea can seemingly hold a conversation\nwith anyone variable to skillfully use\nhumor when it's appropriate and make the\npeople around them feel comfortable they\ncan recognize if a person needs more\nspace or engage with someone that's\nhighly talkative if you have a high\nlevel of social intelligence you may\nnotice how you're able to read people\nand get the best out of them even if\nthey're not the most social beings in\nthe room\npeople like talking to you one of the\nbiggest signs that you have high levels\nof social intelligence is that people\nenjoy socializing with you perhaps\nyou're someone people can go to and not\nfeel judged or drained by psychologist\nDr Sandeep atra states that this is\nespecially important when you are in a\nleadership position after all wouldn't\nyou yourself want to work under someone\nuplifting understanding and reassuring\nthe people in your life will naturally\nfind ways to be around you more when you\nmake them feel good perhaps you see\npeople for how they are versus\ncategorizing them into stereotypes\nultimately people will pick up on how\nyou treat them so if you find that\npeople are seeking you out then you can\nfeel confident in your ability to make\npeople feel comfortable\nappreciating differences\nhaving high social intelligence allows\nyou to appreciate other people's\ndifferences with so many cultures and\nways that people interact with others\nyou may realize that a one size fits-all\napproach will not work it's important to\nmeet people where they're at as everyone\nhas different communication needs very\nwell mind explains how our experiences\ngrowing up give us a specific way of\nviewing the world that can be easy to\nproject onto others socially intelligent\npeople often understand this and will\ntake the time to learn how to best\ncommunicate with different types of\npeople\norganizational psychologist Dr Ronald\nRiggio states that people high in Social\nintelligence are great at playing\ndifferent roles they can effectively\nadapt their communication strategy to\nother people to get them to feel\ncomfortable if you find yourself\nappreciative of other people and\nembracing their differences rather than\nrunning from them then you may have high\nsocial intelligence\nactive listening we've all walked away\nfrom Bad conversations before where you\ncan tell that what you're saying is only\ngoing in one ear and out the other but\nthink about people you've talked with\nwho genuinely listened to what you had\nto say weren't those much more pleasant\nDr Ronald ruggio explains that people\nhigh in Social intelligence listen not\njust respond but to understand the other\nperson this helps them Forge a deeper\nconnection as let's face it it feels\ngood to be heard while not everyone may\nhave this skill it is something you can\ndevelop taking time to listen to others\nprocess what they're saying and ask them\nquestions is a great way to build up\nthis ability and improve your social\nintelligence\nConflict Management can you think of\nsomeone in your life that you always\nhave to walk on eggshells around\nhaving high social intelligence makes it\neasier to navigate the Minefield of\npeople's emotions and engage in\nconflicts without snowballing into a\nbigger issue Dr Sandeep atra believes\nthat people high in Social intelligence\nconsider multiple factors in a person's\nBehavior\nsomeone who is angry isn't doing so just\nto be a jerk\nthere are multiple factors at play that\nare happening behind the scenes that are\nmaking them act out similarly having a\nstrong ability to empathize and work\nsocial cues allows you to de-escalate a\nsituation before it gets out of hand\nhow do you deal with stressful and\nawkward situations\nconflict is inevitable and impossible to\navoid however the key is being able to\nmanage a situation so things don't get\nhair\nsocial intelligence is just one type of\nintelligence among a myriad of others\nlike other forms of intelligence it can\nbe improved over time with practice\nsometimes it takes making some changes\nin the way you interact with others\nwhile other ways may involve you working\nwith a professional in any case learning\nhow to deal with people is a skill that\ncan continuously be improved upon no\nmatter who you are or where you're at\nthere's always something you can do to\nlevel
