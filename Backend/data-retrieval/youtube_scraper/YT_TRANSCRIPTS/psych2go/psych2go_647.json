    "transcript": "there has been a huge decline in mental\nhealth around the world which is why\nwe're so committed to creating more\ncontent than we ever have stay tuned and\nthanks for being a part of our journey\nit's been drilled into our heads\nrepeatedly whether it be by friends\nmovies or other media family is the most\nprecious treasure but what if there's\nsomeone who is outright toxic\nhow do you know perhaps you were\nsurprised to learn that things that\nhappened in your home were not what\neveryone else experienced we understand\nthat seeing and accepting someone as\ntoxic can be difficult when it comes to\nfamily so let's look at some signs that\ncan reveal the toxicity number one they\nconstantly overstep your boundaries and\nprivacy have you told a family member\nabout your boundaries that there are\nsome things that you are just not okay\nwith no matter how they spin it do they\nthen ignore you and do it anyhow it\ncould be anything from teasing you about\nyour weight to making you live their\ndreams for them\nthey just repeatedly stomp over the line\nlike it doesn't exist they may even try\nto say things like this is good for you\nor that you should learn to accept what\nthey're doing despite evidence to the\ncontrary this is toxic behavior it's\ndisrespectful to you as an individual\nand no matter how they spin it this is\nnot healthy and you aren't obligated to\ntake it number two they always demand\nsomething from you\nmy way or the highway is the prevailing\nattitude with this toxic family member\nthere's no bend or compromise unless\nit's you doing the bending no matter how\nmuch you do it's never enough there's\nalways something more\nthe asks are so frequent that eventually\nyou start to lose the ability to step\nback and gauge the situation they keep\ndemanding and nitpicking far beyond what\nis reasonable or considerate\nand should you bring up your own needs\nyou're likely to be shamed or guilted\nfor daring to think of yourself and your\nown well-being\nwe'll tell you something here\nyou're not selfish for wanting to live\nyour own life and you're not a bad\nperson for assessing the situation\nthat kind of constantly demanding\ndynamic is unhealthy and not the norm\nnumber three they don't recognize your\nachievements hey you got that\ncertificate sweet you got second in an\ninternational competition you got the\njob you wanted you're proud of yourself\nbecause this wasn't just a participate\nand watch thing you didn't cheat you're\nnot asking for a prize for eating a\nhealthy salad it's something significant\nbut did all those achievements just get\nshoved in a back closet never to be\nmentioned again\nor maybe they are mentioned but only in\nterms of how you fell short\nwhy didn't you get first place\nyou have every right to feel\nunappreciated and unacknowledged don't\nlet them tell you that you're\noverreacting or that you're being\nconceited this is a terrible and\nunhealthy behavior that they may say\nserves to keep you humble but really\nit's just a way of keeping your\nself-confidence low allowing them to\ncontinue feeling superior and in control\nnumber four\nall of your problems are ignored called\nattention seeking or sad excuses\nthe scene\nyou approach a family member about how\nyou're overworked showing signs of\nburnout and need a break or you find\nthat the grief you're experiencing from\na loss is extra difficult so you need to\npostpone doing that favor for the family\nmember\ndid you just get nervous fearful or\nmaybe feel hopeless did your mind\nimmediately start resisting saying no i\ncan't do that\nwhy\nmaybe you know they'll just shrug it off\nwith a yeah yeah what else is new or\nroll their eyes and pretend not to hear\nyou perhaps you're anticipating being\nscolded for being a spoiled bratty\nattention seeker or a lazy good for\nnothing it might be followed up with a\nbitter chaser of i went through this and\ndidn't need a break just to make you\nfeel that much more inadequate\ndisregarding your feelings and your\nindividual right to your emotional\nresponse is toxic and not right\nattention love and reassurance during\ndown times is a basic need not a flighty\nrequest their inability or unwillingness\nsays a lot about them and not a bad\nreflection on you number five\nyou are at fault for everything is\neverything you say or do taken\nnegatively are even your most\ncompassionate actions twisted into\nsomething ugly have you found yourself\nbeing blamed for impossible things\nuh yeah that's bad poison\nno you shouldn't be treated this way\nnor is it a normal part of family life\ncatch this sign by taking a small step\nback\ntrust your mind and ask yourself things\nlike\ncould this truly possibly be directly my\nfault\nis what i did really that awful\nyou aren't obligated to be a dumping\nground scapegoat for their issues so\nyeah 90 on that test is a great score\nand no you're not at fault that a family\nmember forgot their own lunch the\nconstant blaming and criticizing can\nhave you build up resentment and anger\nif you feel trapped being expected to\naccept this\nknow that this toxic behavior is not\nsomething expected to be a part of life\nand you have every right to let it and\nthem go\nnumber six gaslighting this term has\nbeen around long enough now that any\nsearch with just this word will bring up\na whole lot of hits how do you catch it\nhappening\ntake note if you sense they lie to you a\nlot\none or two times of no you owe me a\ncoffee remember can really just be a\nmistake but\nif everything you know is make-believe\naccording to them and memories\nconcerning them seem to be almost\ncompletely revised\ngood chance they're gaslighting you\nthey're trying to ensure you don't trust\nyourself the low confidence ensuring\nyou'll never do better than them and\nthey'll never have to take\naccountability for their own\nshortcomings\nneedless to say not normal not healthy\nand very abusive\ndid these signs bring new meaning to\nanything you might have experienced have\nyou seen this happen to others\nhow are you handling it feel free to\ndiscuss give us a like and we'll see you\nsoon"
