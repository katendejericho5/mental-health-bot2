    "transcript": "there's a famous adage that goes if you\nwant something you've never had before\nyou need to do something you've never\ndone before similarly people often offer\nthe advice nothing changes if nothing\nchanges to those who find themselves\nstuck be it in their personal life\ncareer or even their relationships\nnow would you agree with these sayings\nbecause if not then the paradoxical\nsecret we're about to tell you now is\nbound to surprise you and make no sense\ndefining the Sherlock Paradox see the\nway our minds work is a lot like the\ngreat detective Sherlock Holmes always\nlooking for Clues and piecing things\ntogether and the Sherlock Paradox of\nAttraction posits that our perceptions\nof ourselves which we confirm with\nevidence from our experiences and\nenvironments greatly influences how\nothers in turn perceive us to be\nin fact a 2012 study by Krantz Friedberg\nand Andrew 7 found that the effect of\nphysical attractiveness in predicting a\nperson's popularity depended on their\nself-perceptions regardless of how\nobjectively attractive they are\nso whatever it is we believe about\nourselves we then start to interpret our\nexperiences and other environmental cues\nin a way that confirms these beliefs\nthis is called a self-fulfilling\nprophecy which researchers Madden\nWillard Gull and sure Define as a belief\nthat leads to its own fulfillment by\nshaping an individual's behaviors and\nexpectancy consistent ways simply put\nthis means that even if we believe\nsomething about ourselves it isn't true\nwe make it come true by thinking and\nacting as if it already is\na very good example of this and how it\nrelates to our relationship and romantic\nattractiveness is the idea of contingent\nself-esteem or CSE for short first\nstudied by researchers ni Bush conveyo\nand cook in 2008 CSE is a core component\nof our self-perceptions based on\nexternal factors such as popularity\nromantic success the approval of others\nand how we think we compare to those\naround us\nlike most of our beliefs CSE is often\nformed in our childhood our early\nexperiences teach us what to think of\nourselves based on how other people\ntreat us if they like us and we have a\nlot of friends we might get the idea\nthat we're wanted attractive or well\nliked if they reject criticize or\nabandon us however then it'll form this\nbelief in us that we're not enough for\nthat something is wrong with us then\nonce we have this belief about ourselves\nbe it positive or negative we then begin\nto behave in ways that are aligned with\nthese beliefs only making them stronger\nover time say for example you have a\nnegative perception of yourself perhaps\nyou think I'm unattractive so you start\nacting like you are and think everyone\nelse thinks it too you don't make much\neffort to look good you don't try to\nflirt with your crush or let them know\nyou're interested and you always put\nyourself down never believing anyone who\ncompliments you\npeople like this who are overly\nself-critical and insecure then become\nunattractive to others not because of\nthe way they look but the way they act\nways to apply the Sherlock paradox\nhow let's turn it around shall we\nthe question I'm sure you're dying to\nask the entire reason why you're even\nhere in the first place\nhow do we use the Sherlock Paradox to\nmake ourselves more attractive\nwell it's simple really\nthe principle is much like that of a\nChinese finger trap the more you try to\nget something the harder it seems to be\nso you have to do something paradoxical\ninstead the opposite of what you want to\nachieve\nbut how on Earth is that supposed to\nwork you're wondering keep in mind these\ntwo things reactants and reverse\npsychology recall a time when someone\ntried to push you to do something or act\na certain way\ndidn't their pressure only make you want\nto do the opposite that's called\nreactants and it happens in romantic\nattraction too the main reason why\nreverse psychology works is that when\npeople feel pressured to act a certain\nway they often prefer to do the opposite\nin order to assert their autonomy this\nis based on brem's 1989 reactants Theory\nso to answer your question there are two\nparadoxical ways to attract your crush\nfirst is to act in a way that's the\nopposite of what you want and second is\nto make yourself more attracted simply\nby believing it some concrete examples\ninclude giving them space when you want\nto get closer to them showing them that\nyou're okay who is spending less time\ntogether showing a willingness to be\nless physically close or intimate when\nyou actually want to be more physically\naffectionate making less of an effort to\nwoo them and get their attention thereby\nmaking yourself seem more secure and\nsure of yourself the most important of\nall planting a belief that you are\nattractive and that your crush would be\nlucky to have you then look for signs\nthat point to yes and act accordingly to\nstrengthen this belief and make it come\ntrue\nso what are some ways you plan to start\napplying this paradoxical secret to\nattracting your crush remember nothing\nin life is possible if we don't first\nthink it possible confidence is key to\nattractiveness and a strong sense of\nself-confidence starts with a simple\nbelief"
