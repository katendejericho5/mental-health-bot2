    "transcript": "- Your heart rate and breathing quicken,\nyour skin feels hot, and\nall you can do is see red.\nWe've all felt that\nseething anger bubble up\ninside us when we think about\nsomeone who has wronged us.\nMaybe it's a friend who\nbetrayed your trust, a colleague\nwho undermined or humiliated you at work\nor a family member who hurt you deeply.\nHatred is a powerful emotion,\nbut what does it really do to us?\nLet's take a moment to explore\nthe psychology behind hatred\nand how it affects us on\na deeper level, the poison\nof resentment.\nWhen you hate someone,\nhow often do you find\nyourself ruminating on\nwhat they did to you?\nHow much mental and emotional\nenergy do you spend reliving\nthe pain and anger?\nIt might feel satisfying\nat first validating even,\nbut over time,\nruminating on your hatred can be\ncorrosive to your mental health.\nYour brain becomes fixated\non the negative experience,\nunable to let it go.\nInstead of bringing you\nclosure, it only serves\nto intensify your negative emotions\nand your perspective may\nbecome more distorted.\nYou might find it difficult to express joy\nor find peace as your mind\nis consumed with thoughts\nof revenge or retribution.\nStudies have also shown\nthat prolonged anger\nand resentment can lead to\nincreased stress levels,\nelevated blood pressure and\nweakened immune function.\nThe prison of the past hate\noften stems from unresolved\nhurt, and when we cling to resentment,\nwe trap ourselves in a cycle\nof negativity, a prison\nof our own past.\nSuddenly, anything and\neverything that has to do\nwith this person you hate becomes\ntinted by this bitterness.\nBut here's the truth. You may\nnot have created this prison,\nbut you have the power\nto set yourself free.\nPractice forgiveness and\nacceptance, not for their sake,\nbut for your own peace of mind.\nEngage in self-care activities\nthat nourish your soul\nand bring you joy\nand don't hesitate to seek\nsupport from trusted friends,\nfamily, or therapist,\nthe burden of holding on.\nIf you've ever held a grudge\nagainst someone, then you know\nhow heavy hate can be,\nand the longer we hold onto it,\nthe heavier the burden becomes.\nIt clouds our judgment,\ncolors, our interactions\nwith others, and robs us of\nthe joy and freedom we deserve.\nThe loss of empathy when you\nhate it can make you feel\nangry, rude, envious,\nprideful, and selfish.\nThese emotions can make it harder for you\nto feel more empathy,\nnot just for the person\nwho wronged you, but for others too.\nYour capacity for understanding\nand compassion shrinks\nas your resentment grows.\nYou might find it difficult\nto relate to the struggles\nof friends or family members\nbecause your own grievances\nloom so large in your mind.\nNow, understanding why someone\nhurt you doesn't justify\ntheir actions, but it\nmight bring you some peace.\nClosure and clarity.\nHurt people, hurt people after all,\nand when we hate that\nbitterness stops being about\nwhat someone did to us\nand more about what we are\ndoing to ourselves, the power\nof forgiveness.\nNow, we're not saying\nthat forgiveness is easy.\nIn fact, it's one of the\nhardest things we can do,\nespecially when we've been deeply wounded.\nBut forgiveness isn't about\nexcusing the other person's\nactions or pretending\nlike nothing happened.\nIt's about freeing yourself\nfrom the chains of hatred\nand reclaiming your own power.\nForgiveness is often\ntouted as the antidote\nto hate and for good reason.\nWhen we forgive, we release\nourselves from the grip\nof negative emotions that\ncan otherwise consume us.\nPsychologists like Jeremy Sutton\nand Lauren Taan have found that\nit reduces stress, anxiety,\nand depression, as well\nas improves relationships\nand overall wellbeing.\nBy choosing forgiveness, we\npave the way for healing,\ngrowth, and freedom,\nthe path to empowerment.\nSo what can you do if you're struggling\nwith hatred and resentment?\nUltimately, the journey from\nHate to love is a personal one\nthat requires you to look\ninside yourself, open your mind,\nand let go of your ego.\nIt's not always easy, and\nit's certainly isn't quick,\nbut it's worth every step of the way.\nIn the words of Haruki,\nMurakami, pain is inevitable,\nbut suffering is optional.\nSo take a moment to reflect what kind\nof life do you want to lead?\nOne filled with bitterness and resentment,\nor one filled with love and resilience.\nYour journey toward healing\nbegins with a single step,\na choice to let go of\nthe hatred that binds you\nand embrace the freedom\nthat forgiveness brings.\nIf you found this video\nvaluable, we invite you to like,\nshare and subscribe to our community\nfor more insightful content,\nlike nine uncomfortable Signs,\nyou're healing emotionally,\nand do you have an emotional wound?\nHere are seven signs.\nDon't forget to share your insights\nin the comments down below.\nThanks for watching."
