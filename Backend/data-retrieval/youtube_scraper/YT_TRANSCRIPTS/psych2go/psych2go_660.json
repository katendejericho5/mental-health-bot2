    "transcript": "it's my last year of high school I've\nalways been someone who thrived at\nschool an overachiever well known by\nmany and favored by the teachers today I\nsit with my closest friends and\neverything is perfect\nit feels like any other regular senior\nday until my friend asks me\nwhat do you want to do after high school\nI freeze\nI freeze because I have no idea what to\nsay I've always run away from the\nthought of going Beyond High School the\nunknown scares me\nit's like leaping from one Cliff to\nanother but I wonder if I would even\nmake the jump\nif I would just fall through instead so\nI make up some lie and say I want to be\na doctor\nwe end up spending the rest of lunch\nsharing updates on our grades and how\nsome have already gotten acceptance\nletters from their favorite universities\nI'm not completely present though and I\nstart to think what if I don't get into\nthe programs I want what if I'm not good\nenough or smart enough so when I get\nhome I mindlessly get to work I open all\nof my textbooks and homework and\norganize my space so it is perfect not a\npencil or paper out of line my mind\ntells me that success starts with a\nperfectly tidy space\nI look at my desk and it looks visually\nperfect but my mind steers towards\ndarker thoughts telling me that if I'm\nnot successful my family will suffer\nbecause I cannot support them\nI realize that I fear this above all\nsometimes my family is all I have\nthey've done so much for me and I feel\nif I can't support them for their needs\nI will be incomplete in some way it also\ntells me that I have to double check\nthat I have everything I need for my\nbackpack even though I know I do because\nif I leave anything out I will fail next\nit Whispers to me reorganize those\nmarkers it's not good enough as it is so\nI do and when I think I've organized my\nspace enough it convinces me that I\nhaven't and I organize it again I find\nthat I'm obsessed with chasing this idea\nof perfection even though I know in the\nback of my mind it is not possible it's\nan exhausting strenuous cycle and in the\nend I've accomplished close to nothing\nand am no closer to calming or relaxing\nmy mind\nlater I invite my friends to my house I\nhaven't spent much time with them these\npast few days and I miss them when they\ncome into my room I expect to loosen up\nand enjoy my time but for some reason I\ncoil back up as one friend sits at my\ndesk poking at my organized pens another\nflops right onto my bed crumpling the\nsmooth sheets one of them plays with the\nitems on my dresser accidentally\ndropping my belongings on the floor\nside of them in my space touching and\nmessing up my things makes me feel a\nlittle crazy and violated\nit makes me feel like everything in my\nbrain that I worked so hard to keep neat\nfor hours is once again scattered within\nminutes\nto clean it my mind screams clean it or\nelse someone might hurt themselves\nso I do as my mind says trailing after\nthem and cleaning in their wake trying\nto undo the mess they made\nas I'm cleaning I noticed my friends\nlaughing at me why are you being so\nuptight they say you are so boring now\nI know I should ignore their comments\nlogically I know that I've just started\nto be like this so precise about the\nspace I live in my mind constantly\nracing and thinking\nthis change they see in me must be\nconfusing for them I should try to\nexplain what's going on in my head but\ncan't they see how much of a mess\nthey're making that someone might hurt\nthemselves might slip and fall who are\nthey to tell me I'm boring when I'm\ntrying to help them their ignorance\nmakes me angry it leaves me feeling\nconfused so instead of bottling it all\nup I yell at them I tell them that I'm\nnot the problem and that they are I tell\nthem that they are horrible friends\nI watch as their faces fall into hurt\nconfusion and shock\nsuddenly my palms are sweaty and I feel\na little dizzy my heart is racing and my\nbreath comes quickly just go\nI managed to say they run out of my room\nbut this attack that I'm feeling\ndoesn't stop I barely notice when my\nknees buckle and I slide to the floor it\nfeels like I can't breathe and time has\nstopped my thoughts race\nwhat have I done what have I done\nit's all I can think\nwhat if they hate me forever what if\nthey never forgive me what if what if\nwhat if\nI close my eyes and try to steady my\nbreathing it is so very hard to calm\nmyself because I feel Frozen\nand numb\nwhen I try to sleep more thoughts begin\nto bombard my head and my thoughts steer\nin a slightly different direction\nI wonder if I locked the door I fear if\nI didn't someone might break in and hurt\nmy family I wonder if I should sanitize\nmy room because there might be germs\nthat will make me sick\nI start to become hyper aware of\neverything I do physically\nmy breathing my blinking my heartbeat\nall these thoughts are my only company\nas I fight for sleep\nI thought that my panic attack would be\na pivotal moment and cure this craze\nthis Obsession I have with being perfect\nI thought it would take away these\nintrusive thoughts instead it only made\nit worse not only do I spend my days\nthinking about my grades and University\nbut now also about the well-being of my\nfriends and how I've hurt them in\nirreparable ways\nI think that every small misstep in my\nlife will hurt those around me\nI also start to become very aware of\neverything I do\nfor instance I could be eating dinner\nsomething so simple and become very\naware of my chewing and I wonder if I'm\nchewing correctly or not\nit also comes to a point where my\nintrusive thoughts are automatic they\ndon't need an external trigger they\nconstantly exist in my mind I just can't\nstop thinking\nit has been a few weeks I haven't seen\nmy friends in what it feels like forever\nthey have called me and texted me but\nI'm far too distracted I spend my days\ncleaning my room and satisfying those\nintrusive thoughts in my head\none morning my little sister came into\nmy room with some breakfast in bed\nat first I thought it was nice of her\nuntil she spilled the orange juice on my\ncleaned floors\nI was absolutely livid I spent so much\nof my time keeping my space clean and\nshe just\nruined it\nso I screamed at her I told her to take\nher breakfast somewhere else and I\nwatched her face crumple and eyes filled\nwith tears but all I could see was the\njuice on the ground and I didn't care\nthat I hurt her feelings\nat all\nit takes a while\nmonths even to realize that this is too\nmuch for me alone to Bear my thoughts\ndrown and prevent me from sleeping they\nalso distract me from school and my\ngrades drop\nI cannot live like this reluctantly I\nseek the help of my grandmother\nsomeone I trust fully\nI tell her everything I've been going\nthrough these last few months and helped\nmy mind just won't stop turning I tell\nher it sends me visions of these\nintrusive thoughts and tells me to keep\neverything perfect and that it feels\nlike I'm not in control of my mind\nand then I hate it\nmy grandmother says that getting help\ncould change my life so we find\nprofessionals and doctors that can help\nme\nAt first I felt like I was completely\nalone in my differences that I was alone\nin these intrusive thoughts and\nobsessive Tendencies\nit felt like a relief when the doctors\ntell me that many people suffer from the\nsame mental illness I have OCD\nI start visiting an exposure therapist\nwho helps me overcome the harsh ways of\nmy OCD\nthe therapist helps me face some of my\ngreatest fears\nshe makes me exist in a messy room in a\nsituation that I can't control\nthe first few weeks are awful forcibly\nliving in a scattered environment makes\nme feel vulnerable and unsteady\nI feel like everything is spiraling out\nof control too fast and I just cannot\nkeep up with it\nwith perseverance though\nI'm able to learn how to coexist with\nthese imperfections and with time I\nlearned that I'm starting to become okay\nwith that\nit turns out they were right with\ntherapy I learned how to manage and\ncontrol the compulsions I feel the\nthoughts in my head don't run as fast so\nnow I'm not so fearful of every little\nthing all the time\nit feels like I finally have some\ncontrol over my mind\nI'm even finally able to get back on\ntrack with school and my friends\nI tell them about how I've been\nstruggling with OCD and they don't laugh\nor tell me I'm boring\nI understand I'm able to go to the mall\ngo out to dinner and overall be more\nsocial without worrying so much about\nevery little thing\nand what a relief that is\nit finally feels like I'm in control of\nmy life\nsomething I haven't felt in a long long\ntime"
