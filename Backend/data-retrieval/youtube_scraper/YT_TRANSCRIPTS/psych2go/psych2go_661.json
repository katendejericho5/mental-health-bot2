Sensations and\nsexual experiences\nfollowing that participants reported\nhaving these fantasies to meet\nunfulfilled sexual needs Escape reality\nfor a while or Express or fulfill a\nsocially taboo sexual desire see lots of\npeople have seemingly taboo sexual\nfantasies which is why it's important to\ndiscuss this topic according to an\narticle from Insider evidence suggests\nthat those who have sexual fantasies\nexperience less anxiety and a greater\nsense of self-esteem\nso what are these seemingly taboo\nthoughts well here are four of the most\ncommon sexual fantasies like it

make you think of BDSM which\nstands for bondage discipline domination\nsubmission sadism and masochism\nthere's a psychological component that\nis often involved in BDSM many for\nexample like psychological role play\nwhere an exchange of power is often\npresent\ncosplay and role play\ncosplay\nisn't that the thing people do at Comic\nCons well hey some may do it in the\nbedroom too\nroleplay and cosplay are different\naccording to an article from Insider\ncosplay is the act of dressing up like\nsomeone or something else often from a\nbook movie or video game it's not\ninherently sexual but some people enjoy\nimpersonating a character during sex\nhowever the term role play often has a\nsexual connotation as it has often been\nused to fulfill sexual Kinks or

desire\ncertified sex therapist sorry Cooper\nexplains in an article for psychology\ntoday that the old saying that the brain\nis the biggest sex organ still holds\ntrue how we become aroused in a sexual\nscenario either Solo or with a partner\nbegins with fantasy and Imagination\nCooper goes on to explain that often her\nclients are shy about sharing personal\nfantasies out of fear of being perceived\nas strange bizarre or disgusting by\ntheir partner she adds that not being\nfully open about one's sexual desires\nand needs can lead to problems down the\nroad in the relationship\nit
