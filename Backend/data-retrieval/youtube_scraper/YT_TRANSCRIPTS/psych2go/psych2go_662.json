    "transcript": "how does attachment Theory affect sexual\nrelationships the original study by John\nballview and Mary Ainsworth mainly\nfocused on infants but psychologists\ntoday believe it also influenced adults\nand their relationships with their\nparents friends and romantic Partners in\nthis video we'll examine studies that\nrevolve around the four attachment types\nand how each style of attachment may\naffect sexual relationships\nanxious\nhave you ever been told that you're\nneedy or possessive chances are you may\nbe anxiously attached to your partner\nanxious attachment types have a deep\nfear of Abandonment by their Partners\nwhich manifest through being demanding\nor clingy this may even lead to strong\njealousy when they feel their partners\nare emotionally unavailable\nthis pushes the anxiously attached to be\noverly compliant in order to try and\nplease their Partners so how does their\nanxious tendency affect their sexual\nrelationships in a 2021 study researcher\nWalter odera oweno and his team surveyed\n367 secondary students in Nairobi where\nthey were asked to fill out questions on\ntheir attachment Styles and risky sexual\nbehaviors they found that those with\nanxious attachment styles were more\nlikely than other styles to be involved\nin Risky sexual behaviors this aligns\nwith the behavior of anxious Styles and\ntheir desire to please their Partners\nover their own wants needs or even\nsafety so if you feel that you tend to\nbe anxious in a sexual relationship\nhaving open communication about your\nanxiety can be very helpful in addition\nhaving clear boundaries and speaking up\nabout them can be effective ways to\nprotect yourself from being overly\ncompliant in sexual relationships and if\nyour partner is anxious it can always be\nhelpful to gently remind them that\nyou're not leaving them and that they\ndon't have to go about above and beyond\nto try and please you\navoidant\nas the name suggests people who are\navoidantly attached tend to be will\navoidant this attachment style can\ndevelop an infancy when the primary\ncaregivers are emotionally unavailable\navoidant attachment Styles tend to avoid\nconfrontation and conflict and fear\nIntimacy in relationships\ncan lead the avoidantly attached away\nfrom forming healthy relationships if\nthey continue to let their fears dictate\ntheir bond with others so what does\nresearch say about their sexual\nrelationships\n2007 study of 273 French Canadian\ncouples between the ages of 18 and 35\nshowed that there was a positive\ncorrelation between avoidant Detachment\nand avoidance of sexual encounters this\ncorresponds with avoidant attachment\nStyles and their tendency to stay\ndistant and detached from relationships\nand to sexual relationships tend to be\none of the most intimate forms of\nbonding many avoidant types may try to\ndetach themselves during sex or even\navoid sex completely so if you are in a\nrelationship with someone who tends to\nbe avoidant it's important to let your\npartner feel that they aren't pressured\ninto sexual relationships while giving\nthem enough space to feel independent\nand self-sufficient in their decision to\npursue sexual intimacy fearful also\nreferred to as disorganized attachment\nfearful attachment is often associated\nwith an unpredictable or abusive\nchildhood they tend to have a hard time\ncontrolling their emotions and struggle\nwith depression anxiety confusion and\nfear this can also manifest if they have\na history of abuse neglect act or trauma\nand unsurprisingly fearful attachment\nStyles also struggle with sexual\nintimacy a 2019 survey on 600 men and\nwomen between the ages of 25 to 45\npublished by the American Psychological\nAssociation suggested that fearful\nattachment style was predictive of more\nand frequent sexual partners and greater\nsexual compliance and since fearful\nattachment Styles may have a hard time\nregulating their emotions in their\nrelationships this can potentially\nresult in self-sabotaging behaviors such\nas having multiple sexual partners or\nengaging in Risky sexual behaviors so we\nadvise that if you are in a relationship\nwith someone who has a tendency to be a\nfearful attachment style having clear\ncommunication on expectations and\nboundaries is key to a healthy sexual\nrelationship and as with any other\nattachment Styles it's important to be\naccepting and validating as people who\nhave fearful attachments may need help\nin navigating through their emotions\nsecure as the name suggests secure\nattachment Styles tend to feel secure\nand positive about themselves they tend\nto be comfortable with intimacy and\nclose friendships and romantic\nrelationships they're also able to\ncommunicate their needs and boundaries\nclearly because they're secure in who\nthey are and how they see themselves and\nbecause of their healthy mindsets about\nrelationships secure attachment Styles\nalso form healthy sexual relationships\nwith others according to the\naforementioned 2021 study on risky\nsexual behaviors secure attachment\nstyles were much less likely to\nparticipate in Risky sexual behaviors\nthan other styles the research alliance\nwith secure attachments and their\nability to communicate their boundaries\nand sexual needs and because of their\nself-assurance they're less likely to\navoid intimacy engage in self-sabotaging\nbehaviors or be overly compliant during\nsex as such they are great models for\nother attachment Styles and what we\nshould strive to be in our relationships\nwhile everyone has their own habits and\npreferences it's important to remember\nthat communication is vital in\nmaintaining a healthy sexual\nrelationship and though each attachment\nstyle comes with its own difficulties we\ncan minimize the challenges by speaking\nopenly and honestly about our sexuality\nwithout judgment and if needed speaking\nto a mental health professional can help\nus start taking charge of our sexual\nrelationships and make sure that we\ndon't feel pressured abandoned or judged\nfor how we express our love and most\nimportantly accepting that truly great\nsex happens when we understand and\naccept each other for exactly who we are\nwithout forcing our own desires upon\neach other how about you how does your\nattachment style affect your sexual\nrelationship if you feel comfortable\nsharing with us leave it in the comment\nsection and remember you matter\n[Music]\nforeign"
