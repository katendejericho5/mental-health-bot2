    "transcript": "if you've ever been in love or got lost\nin a daydream of romance you may have\ngotten the idea in your head that those\nintense feelings of true love will last\nforever but real love is more than just\nthe initial feelings of butterflies the\nstrong attraction and the intense\nfeelings that come with romantic love\nmay fade in and out during a long-term\nrelationship relationship specialist and\npsychologist Mark e sharp PhD explains\nthat after those beginning feelings fade\nmost couples are left with feelings of\nconnection and affection even so most\ncouples have to work to keep their\nrelationship lasting even those who\nexperience real love that lasts the test\nof time have to work at it so how do you\nfind a love like this where do you even\nbegin that love to give but to who\nlove can take a lot of work even if it's\nfor yourself relationship expert\nMargaret Paul PhD States in a mind-body\ngreen podcast and article that there is\na big difference between trying to get\nlove and actually sharing love we can't\nshare love if we don't have love to\nshare so does this mean you can't love\nanyone if you don't love yourself no but\nloving yourself sure does seem to make\nthings easier in relationships\ninsecurities and harsh judgments about\nyourself can hurt a relationship you may\ncommonly look to only your partner to\nsoothe these self-doubts and assure\nyourself and while most people love\nAssurance from their partner it could be\nunhealthy to rely on only them for those\nharsh insecurities To Be Tamed\nrelationship expert Margaret Paul puts\nit into perspective by asking that\npeople imagine their inner selves as a\nchild she explains you will not be going\naround neighborhood trying to find\nsomebody else to take care of your child\nright you take care of that child\nyourself perhaps figuring out the next\nsteps as you go along apply that logic\nto yourself what would happen if you\nasked someone else to care for your\ninner self the love of your life may\ngladly help care for your inner child\nbut feelings of rejection and\nabandonment men come into play from you\nin regards to yourself even if your\npartner loves your inner child that kid\nis still going to look up to you feeling\na bit neglected Paul says that when you\ndon't love yourself that's what happens\non the inner level\nbeware of these red flags\nif you want to find a love that's\nhealthy and lasts then you should be\naware of these common relationship red\nflags for starters a good relationship\nshouldn't revolve around needing to feel\nneeded falling into emotional dependency\nearly in the dating process with your\npartner can often be a bad idea\npeople often want to feel needed and can\ngo into relationships mainly looking for\nthis type of satisfaction psychiatrist\nAbigail Brenner MD explains in\nPsychology today that the need may be\nthat you my partner must do certain\nthings for me to make me feel secure and\nsatisfied or that you allow me your\npartner to feel needed by fulfilling\nyour needs\nbut she warns that this will often lead\nto a relationship with little or nowhere\nto grow on a first date it's also a good\nidea to look out for the big red flag of\nsomeone negatively ranting about their\nex psychotherapist Katie Gillis explains\nin Psychology today that it shows an\nenormous lack of respect towards others\nin their life and ultimately speaks to\ntheir integrity there is an appropriate\nway and time to discuss concerns and\nissues with previous Partners so watch\nhow this is done then there's some other\nclassic red flags lying jealousy\negocentrism controlling manners the list\ngoes on but perhaps one red flag that\npeople sometimes try to convince\nthemselves out of is simply feeling\nuncomfortable around them what yes it's\nsometimes obvious that we as humans\nwould turn away from what makes us\nuncomfortable but psychologically\nthere's more at play here\npsychotherapist Katie Gillis explains\nthat trauma survivors specifically those\nwith a family origin of trauma have\nlearned a coping mechanism to ignore or\neven deny their reality\nshe goes on explaining that poor\ntreatment is often normalized in their\nadult relationships due to them being\ntaught as children that those who are\nsupposed to provide love and comfort\noften end up hurting them a healthy\nloving relationship shouldn't be filled\nwith ill treatment Gillis recommends to\npay attention to the amount of time you\nspent trying to decipher untruths or\nlies\nwhen you catch yourself saying that just\ndoes not make any sense trust that\nfeeling if you're often feeling\nuncomfortable but find yourself\nautomatically dismissing it that is an\nimportant red flag that you shouldn't\nignore\nthe green flag that may lead to love\nOkay so we've talked about red flags but\nwhat about green flags common green\nflags in a relationship can be\nconsistent kindness trustworthiness\ncommunication reliability and\nprioritizing each other but there is one\ngreen flag you can look out for to see\nif you found a partner that could truly\nlove you or already does a 2006 study\npublished in the Journal of Personality\nand Social Psychology found that how\nyour partner reacts to your good news\nrather than just bad news can reveal a\nlot about your relationship 79 couples\nwere videotaped discussing good news and\nbad news to their partner researchers\nobserve the partner's behavior and\nresponse to hearing the good news and\nbad news the person giving the news\nrated how understood validated and cared\nfor they felt during the reveal of news\nafter two months the researchers checked\nin on those couples again and found that\nresponses to positive event discussions\nwere more closely related to\nrelationship well-being and breakup than\nwere responses to negative event\ndiscussions the results are discussed in\nterms of the recurrent but often\noverlooked role that positive emotional\nexchanges play in building relationship\nresources so if you want a clue into how\nyour relationship is going reveal some\ngood news to your partner do they\npassively approve or show genuine\nexcitement Mutual Delight or are they a\nbit detached in response to your joy if\nyou're mutually sharing the happiness\nthis good news brings then that seems\nlike a pretty green flag making your\nlove last\nso perhaps you're thinking all is going\npretty well love seems to be in the air\nbut how do you make it last\nwell there are a few things that may\nhelp for one a strong Foundation is\nvital\nin an article for psych Central licensed\nmarriage and family therapist mudita\nrastogi PhD explains that your interests\nopinions and experiences can change as\nyou grow but if you share the same core\nbelief systems you will have a platform\nfrom which to build a strong\nrelationship\ncore beliefs and values can be very\nimportant in a long-term healthy\nrelationship but what about the little\nthings\nwhen one first starts dating perhaps\nindeed looking for love they may get too\nhung up on sharing similar interests the\nsmall ones but this doesn't always lead\nto a successful relationship similar\ninterests and hobbies aren't as\nimportant as you may think initially\nlicensed associate marriage and family\ntherapist Sheila Tucker lamft explains\nto bustel that we're often led to\nbelieve that we need to be compatible in\nevery area of our lives in order for a\nrelationship to work however\nrelationships often work best when you\nhave the ability to do both things apart\nas well as together\nso while core values and beliefs seem to\nfoster a loving and healthy long-term\nrelationship varying hobbies and\ninterests can as well you may just both\ntake an interest in each other's\ninterests as long as you get to know\neach other and if not some time doing\nyour own thing is healthy too as long as\nyou both spend quality time together\nduring other moments but what about\nconflict you may ask well clinical\npsychologist Jana dubinski psyd has\nfound in her research that conflict is\nbound to happen with all couples at some\ntime the key here is how they handle and\nmanage their conflict\nso instead of focusing on winning the\nfight listening to understand what your\npartner is trying to express seems more\nvital don't you think dubinsky continued\nto explain in an article from Psych\nCentral that we don't have to agree but\nwe must work to understand so once you\nfound love it's best to not only enjoy\nit but to truly try to understand the\nsource of it all as well\nwho is it you love and what is it\nthey're trying to say you love them\nafter all so take a listen love is a\nmagical thing and if you're searching\nfor it we want to hear what it is you're\nlooking out for give us the good news\ncomment down below what it is you're\nlooking for in a loving partner you\ncan't always rely on signs to find Love\nsometimes things simply don't work out\nbut rather use those signs and\nrelationship Flags to find a partner\nthat could just one day be your love\nhopefully one that lasts that test of\ntime if you both put in that commitment\nand work often every long-term\nrelationship needs we hope you've\nenjoyed this video if you did don't\nforget to click the like button and\nshare it with
