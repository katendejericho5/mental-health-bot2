    "transcript": "have you ever wondered why people are\nthe way they are what determines a\nperson's nature and what could make\nsomeone good or evil philosophers\ndramatists and theologians have wrestled\nwith these big questions for as long as\nman has been able to ponder them and in\nthis modern day and age the search for\nanswers continues to be carried out by\npsychologists and social scientists\nalike\nbut have you ever heard of one very\nnotable psychologist who asked himself\nthese very same questions and got more\nthan he bargained for\nor many Philip zimbardo is largely known\nas The Man Behind the psychological\nexperiment that shocked the world\nthe infamous 1971 Stanford Prison\nExperiment more than 30 years after it\nended however zimbardo has since then\ngone on to set the record straight about\nwhat really happened and what it all\nmeans and what he calls the psychology\nof evil but first a brief history\nin August of 1971 Philip zimbardo a\npsychology professor at Stanford\nUniversity received funding from the U.S\nOffice of Naval Research to study the\npsychological effects of becoming a\nprisoner or prison guard thus he and his\nresearch team selected over 24 healthy\nintelligent middle-class male college\nstudents from U.S and Canada who\nhappened to be in the Stanford area to\nparticipate\nonce they agreed a simple coin toss\nwould then determine whether they would\nplay the role of a prisoner or prison\nguard for the next two weeks they would\nbe studied zimbardo and his team turned\nthe basement of Stanford's psychology\ndepartment building into a makeshift\nprison closing off the corridors barring\nup the windows and replacing the doors\nwith steel bars at one end of the prison\nHall was a videotape recorder and an\nintercom system was secretly installed\ninside every cell to monitor prisoners\nconversations\nthe question zimbardo posed were what\nhappens when you put good people in an\nevil place\ndoes Humanity win over evil or does evil\nTriumph\nwell his studies seemed to support the\nlatter hypothesis\nbecause after only six days the\nexperiment was terminated due to the\nalarming indignities and inhumane\ntreatment the guards had been inflicting\non the prisoners\nprisoners were repeatedly beaten and\nhumiliated while also experiencing\nphysical and emotional harassment from\nthe prison guards sometimes for no clear\nreason in fact after only two days the\nprisoners staged a rebellion against the\nguards within the first four days three\nprisoners had become so traumatized that\nthey were released\nmany guards quickly became cruel and\ntyrannical While most prisoners became\ndepressed and disoriented\nthe public was understandably outraged\nby this and the experiment quickly came\nunder Fire for its unethical practices\nenabling the abuse of participants and\nillegally recording them just to name a\nfew\nin fact it's often cited as one of the\nmost important reasons why the American\nPsychological Association has since then\nput greater care into examining and\nsafeguarding the ethical grounds of\npsychological research\nstill in spite of all this zimbardo\ninsists that the Stanford Prison\nexperiment's greatest and most lasting\nLegacy is what it teaches us about\nhumanity and its boundless capacity for\nboth good and evil the Lucifer effect\nevil zimbardo said is simply the\nexercise of power in his 2008 Ted Talk\nhe recounts the events of his Infamous\nexperiment as a way to explain the\nconcept of the Lucifer effect saying\nthat it is the negatives that people can\nbecome and not what they are\nbecause this experiment showed that For\nBetter or For Worse people will readily\nconform to the social roles they are\nexpected to play zimbardo believes that\ngood and evil lives within every one of\nus and that the barrier between the two\nis permeable it is only the situation\nthat evokes one over the other\none thing he calls the Lucifer effect\nand the hero effect\nand so what we're interested in is what\nare the external factors around the\nindividual the bad Barrel not the bad\napples if you want to change a person\nyou've got to change the situation if\nyou want to change the situation you've\ngot to know where the power is in the\nsystem\nthe hero effect\nbut of course just how good people can\nturn evil in the wrong situations the\nopposite can also be true the right\nconditions may just make unlikely Heroes\nout of anyone we may not always have to\nbe victims of our own circumstances\nto quote zimbardo once again heroism is\nthe antidote to evil and we must promote\nthe heroic imagination especially in our\nkids in our educational system we want\nkids to think I'm the hero in waiting\nwaiting for the right situation to come\nalong and I will act heroically\nwhat zimbardo is proposing is nothing\nnew in fact it's a basic premise of\nsocial psychology known as the power of\nthe situation according to the American\nPsychological Association\npower of the situation posits that our\nthoughts actions and emotions are\nsubstantially influenced by social\nsettings\nwhat is relatively new however is this\napplication of this concept to the way\nwe think about Good and Evil in human\nnature in fact zimbardo even founded a\nnon-profit research and education\norganization called the heroic\nimagination project which is dedicated\nto designing Innovative strategies by\ncombining psychological research\nintervention education and social\nactivism to create everyday Heroes\nequipped to solve local and Global\nproblems their tagline\nWe Believe ordinary people can do\nextraordinary things we train everyday\nHeroes\nbecoming an everyday hero is so how do\nyou become more heroic in your everyday\nlife you ask well according to zimbardo\nand the research he's inspired there's\npower in picturing oneself as a hero in\nwaiting and using our heroic imagination\nbecause the more we mentally prepare\nourselves to intervene and challenging\nbut mundane situations like standing up\nto a bully or helping a stranger the\neasier it becomes for us to tap into our\ninnate potential for bravery positivity\nand altruism\nother ways we can cultivate our heroic\nimagination include simple exercises\nsuch as asking ourselves who we think of\nas our heroes determining what\ncharacteristics they all have in common\nin trying to model their behaviors\nlooking for opportunities to be a little\nmore heroic in our everyday lives and\nchallenging ourselves to be the first\nperson to act in difficult situations\nbecause in the end the opposite of a\nhero is not a villain\nbystander so are you ready to unlock\nyour heroic imagination today\nwhat are some ways you can be a little\nmore heroic in your everyday life"
