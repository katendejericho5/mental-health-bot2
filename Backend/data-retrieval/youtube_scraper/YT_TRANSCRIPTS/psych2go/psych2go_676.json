    "transcript": "all big things come from Small\nBeginnings the seed of every habit is a\nsingle tiny decision but as that\ndecision is repeated a habit sprouts and\ngrows stronger success is the product of\ndaily habits not once in a lifetime\nTransformations this quote was written\nby author and motivational speaker James\nClear in his book Atomic habits one of\nthe best-selling self-help books of the\nlast decade and it promises to help its\nreaders break long time bad habits and\nadopt better ones instead through\nnothing more than simple everyday\nroutines the secret according to clear\nlies in first understanding the power\nour habits have over us with that said\nif you've been having trouble being more\nproductive lately but aren't quite sure\nwhy take this as a sign to start looking\nmore closely at your day-to-day habits\naccording to self-help experts and\npsychologists here are some of the most\ncommon habits keeping you lazy number\none an overly comfortable environment\nthis first one might surprise you but\nremember there's a reason why they say\nwe need to get out of our comfort zone\nmore because when we're overly\ncomfortable be it in our workplace with\nour academic standing or around our same\ncircle of long time friends it can be\neasy to become lazy and complacent\nsurrounding ourselves with only what's\neasy or familiar doesn't give us any\nreason or opportunity to push ourselves\nfor the better in fact one study by\nLaura perseras found that for foreign\nexchange students in Berlin leaving\ntheir comfort zones incited greater\nself-discovery and personal change\nnumber two the attention economy ever\nwasted an hour or two without meaning to\njust by browsing through your social\nmedia feed deciding what to post or\nscrolling through a few Tick Tock videos\nwell according to therapist Dr Ralph De\nla Rosa constantly being overloaded with\ninformation from having the internet at\nyour fingertips can make anyone prone to\nprocrastination and getting distracted\nall the time end the fast-paced\nhyper-connected lifestyle of being on\nsocial media too much can easily make us\nlazy and self-absorbed so maybe it's\nbest to skip the Bedtime browsing and go\non a social media detox every now and\nthen number three negative thought\npatterns according to cognitive\npsychology there are a lot of negative\nthought patterns that can seriously\nhinder a person's ability to function\nhurt their self-confidence and make it\nhard for them to feel motivated\nthese are called cognitive distortions\nfirst studied by a psychologist and\nPioneer of CBT Dr Aaron Beck some\nexamples include all or nothing thinking\nif I don't get the grade I want I'll be\na total failure over generalization it\nrained on my way to work today so I was\nlate why do bad things always happen to\nme and catastrophizing my crush rejected\nme I'll never find love\nnumber four lack of self-care here's\nsomething that might surprise you when\nstudying about the life of the late\ngreat scientist Albert Einstein\nbiographers were able to deduce what his\nday-to-day routine was like and many\nproductivity experts have used this\nknowledge along with the daily routines\nof other successful people to apply\ntheir teachings but you know what the\nsurprising part is Albert Einstein slept\n10 hours a night napped in the afternoon\ntook daily walks practiced violin and\nspent two hours a day doing nothing but\nthinking and while we're not saying that\ndoing everything Einstein did is bound\nto guarantee you success too the main\ntakeaway here is that self-care is key\nto productivity after all sleep\ndeprivation a sedentary lifestyle poor\nnutrition and then all work no play\nattitude can all contribute to a feeling\nof laziness and burnout\nnumber five poor planning prioritizing\nand organizing last but certainly not\nleast on our list of habits keeping you\nlazy is poor planning prioritizing and\norganizing all of which are important\nlife skills and when we don't hone or\nvalue these skills enough our\nproductivity can really take a turn for\nthe worse poor time management for\nexample leads to constantly running late\nand plenty of missed deadlines while an\ninability to plan and organize can make\nachieving long-term goals seem\noverwhelming and impossible according to\na study by German Scholars vegetino\nnastase and licatis time management\nskills were strongly Associated not only\nwith academic achievements but also life\nsatisfaction so not knowing how to\nprioritize tasks or set your own goals\ncould be what's holding you back from\nrealizing your full potential so if you\nfind yourself struggling with laziness\nit's important to first identify what\nyou may be doing to contribute to the\nproblem only then can you begin to work\non making positive changes and Lasting\nImprovement in your productivity\nin her Blog the best brain possible\nself-help Guru Debbie Hampton states\nthat we are all creatures of Habit For\nBetter or Worse even though they know\nwhat they want to change it's common for\npeople to come to me because they\nhaven't been able to take the step from\nawareness to action Insight isn't enough\nso what bad habits do you need to break\ntoday and what's your plan of action"
