    "transcript": "- [Narrator] We humans have made\nthe finding a partner\nritual so complicated\nthat even experts are\nstill finding new tips,\ntricks, and hints.\nThis dance can often feel unnatural to us,\nmaking initial forays\nor revisits after long breaks unnerving.\nWe even have a name for the dance, dating.\nIt's a jungle out there,\nand we'd like to give you some tips\nto help you navigate the new terrain\nor help you reacquaint yourself,\nexpansion pack included.\nNumber one, know yourself.\nBefore you even contemplate\nwho the other person is,\nyou definitely need to know you.\nThis will save you an incredible amount\nof frustration and time\nif you already know\nthe fundamental basics of what you need\nin terms of values, treatment,\nbeliefs, ideas, and support.\nThink of it as the absolute essentials,\nthe deal breakers, if you will.\nFor example, you can\nprobably live with a person\nwho likes a different brand\nof chocolate than you,\nbut you might never be able to\nstay with someone who refuses\nto comfort you when you're crying.\nSpending some time exploring\nwhich behaviors you value\ncan help you develop reasonable\nand tangible expectations.\nWhen you understand this, you\ncan confidently allow yourself\nto cross off the list those\nwho don't meet your needs.\nNumber two, go at your own pace.\nYay, who's in the whole\ndating thing again?\nAnd that's right, it's you.\nYou're a part of this, and\nso you have every right\nto decide how you are\ngoing to go about it.\nSure, other people may try to nudge you\nin particular directions,\nbut you are the only one who 100% knows\nwhat's going on inside and\ncan tailor your speed to it.\nIn fact, being rushed could\nbe considered a red flag.\nIf someone keeps pushing, rushing,\nand insisting despite\nyou indicating otherwise,\nthis is a sign that the other person\ncan't take no for an answer,\nwhich in turn implies\njust how little your needs matter to them.\nNumber three, think of\neach step as practice.\nDo you expect to hit a hole in one\nthe first time you play golf?\nWell, dating is kind of similar.\nIt takes practice.\nThese days, online meeting through texts,\napps, and even online\nforums is far more common.\nNo one you know has vetted these people.\nAnd if you are used to meeting people\nin the traditional way,\nthis can be daunting.\nCertain behaviors show up\nmore often than others.\nFor example, if you're heteronormative,\na woman will have to\ndeal with many messages\nfrom men with a blunt,\naggressively sexual approach,\nwhile the men deal with\nghosting from the ladies.\nInterestingly enough, if you're pursuing\na same sex relationship,\nthere is a tendency for less pressure\non who sends a message first,\nand a lot fewer in-your-face\ninappropriate replies.\nNumber four, communicate and be honest.\nAs nerve-wracking as it might be,\ndating is supposed to be\na good thing, a fun thing.\nAnd there are a few things less fun\nthan severe discomfort\nfrom awkward silences\nor cringey outbursts.\nQuite often, many of these painful dates\nstem from one or both\nparties not being honest\nor communicative about their intentions,\nactual wants, needs, and boundaries.\nCertainly, first\nimpressions are important.\nWe're not telling you\nto go on a first date\nin you're binge watching PJs\nafter not having brushed your hair.\nBut think of it more like,\nif you are not actually\na hotshot kajillionaire,\ndon't act like you can make it rain.\nThe truth will out eventually.\nAnd that leads to seriously awkward,\nsometimes super\nembarrassing confrontations.\nOh, and wasted time, so much wasted time.\nYou do want to tell just enough\nso both of you understand each other.\nSpilling everything with\nall details and history\nin a torrential flood, especially\nearly on, is overwhelming.\nWhile it may not be advisable\nto gush marriage on a first date,\nit's a good idea to be forthcoming\nabout why you are dating,\nwhether it's a hookup, a long-term thing,\nor even just, I haven't\nmet anyone new in a while.\nIn the same vein, don't go on\nand on about past partners.\nBut being honest about the big stuff,\nlike being widowed, or\ndivorced, et cetera,\nwill help steer interactions\nin the right direction.\nGiving some general but honest info\nwill help avoid red flag status too.\nIt's about balance.\nIf you're returning to the dating scene\nafter being away for a super\nlong time and give no reason,\nthat seems suspicious.\nOn the flip side, if you spill\nevery single moment of your past\nlike you're trying to find\nabsolution through therapy,\nthis is also not good.\nOkay, number five,\nwatch out for red flags.\nAnd speaking of those red flags,\nlook out for the four major ones,\ncriticism, defensiveness,\nstonewalling, and contempt.\nBut what exactly am I\nlooking for, you ask.\nDon't worry, we got you covered.\nCriticism isn't a one-off you're late.\nIt's an all or nothing thing\nwith the criticism flag.\nSo more like, you're always\nlate or you never notice me.\nSo the movies were right on this one.\nOnly a sith deals in absolutes.\nDefensiveness is like a pre-attack.\nEverything you say\nbecomes the opening salvo\nfor a debate, fight, or a guilt trip.\nAn offhand comment of\n\"It's raining pretty hard,\nwhy'd you park so far away,\"\ngets a response of \"I don't\nwant my car to get scratched.\nDo you know how much that costs?\nIt's just rain, what's your problem?\"\nOr asking for fun, \"Do you\nthink a hotdog is a sandwich,\"\nand you get a full-blown insulting tirade\nabout giving an inane reasoning\nto manipulate a result.\nI mean, come on, sometimes a\nquestion's just a question.\nStonewalling, on the other hand,\ntakes an inactive approach,\njust like it sounds.\nYou say a thing or trying\nto talk after a conflict\nand the other person doesn't\nrespond or they go offline.\nYou explain your stance,\nand they either act like they don't care\nor they simply act like you\ndidn't say anything at all.\nContempt, the most sinister\nof the four horsemen of\nthe, I mean, of dating.\nContempt goes hand in hand\nwith being condescending.\nThey'll behave in a mean-spirited manner.\nHumiliating you or otherwise making sure\nyou know they're superior in some way.\nSo demeaning jokes at your\nexpense on a first date?\nRun away.\nIn fact, if any of these red flags\nmake themselves clearly, absolutely known,\nthe best course of action\nis to turn and leave,\nand not after giving it a go for a year.\nLeave quickly.\nYou'll have noticed that they all entail\nthe flag bearer, not\ncaring about their partner\nor at worst using their partner as a tool.\nLike a sport though, dating\nalso has a yellow flag,\nwhere there's unease but\nyou're not really sure\nif it's really a thing.\nWhen in doubt, ask an expert.\nYou could also sit back and ask yourself\nhow you'd feel if this\ntreatment was being received\nby someone close to you.\nWhen put in that light, we\ntend to lose the rosy glasses\nof initial dating forgiveness.\nNumber six, tell someone\nyou know where you are\nand be aware of your surroundings.\nI know you've been\nwatching those docuseries\nor at least have seen the newsfeeds.\nYou know the ones,\nwhere the aftermath involves a friend\nor family member of the victim saying,\n\"We had no idea where they were.\nIf only.\"\nAlways let someone you trust\nknow where you are and with who.\nYou never know when something may happen.\nIt might be something petty,\nlike, \"This is super awkward.\nCan you conveniently show up or call\nso I can leave this date?\"\nOr, on the other hand, it\ncould possibly save your life.\nAs much as we're all digitally connected,\nalways remember that\nsomeone you met online\nor while waiting for coffee\nis not someone you know.\nDating is complex.\nWe want to arm you with your best chance.\nSo stay tuned for part two and\ntake that stride and pride.\nWe're here for you."
