we're\nbound to see groups of children heading\nto school and universities\nheartbreaking to do the math\nparents are viewed as superhumans people\nwhom we can rely upon who are supposed\nto have our back at any stage but a lot\nof times they can say hurtful and\ndestructive things without realizing the\npsychological damage they cause their\nkids\na study including German citizens showed\nthat negative words cause subjects to\nrelease stress and anxiety-inducing\nhormones so words have an impact\nwhether you're a parent or a child\nyourself these eight things can be\nhelpful in recognizing the toxicity that\nsurrounds children number one let me do\nit on the face of it this doesn't\nnecessarily seem negative but one said\nin a condescending manner it can make a\nchild feel that they're incapable of\nproducing an efficient outcome\nthink of this a child is trying to\nbutton up their shirt and after five\nminutes of struggling you jump in and\nfinish their difficult task how does\nthat make them feel it feels\ndiscouraging and cuts down their\nconfidence this is a manifestation of\nover parenting which is associated with\nhigher levels of narcissism and more\nineffective coping skills like\ninternalizing and distancing for example\nwhich in turn are related to Greater\nanxiety and stress in young adults and\nchildren\nnumber two\ncan you change your appearance\nyour 15 year old puts on a dress and\ndoes their hair to go to a friend's\nparty you stop them so that they can fix\ntheir appearance according to what you\nthink would look better even when\nparents know their children Inside Out\ntelling someone that the way they've\nchosen to look is not appealing can be\ndevastating to handle you being\njudgmental might not only bring down\ntheir confidence but also make them shy\naway from being their true selves and\nshowcasing their own taste if prolonged\nit could emerge in forms of\nself-consciousness or even eating\ndisorders in a study by UCL in 2015 the\nquality of the parent-child connection\nwas examined using a sample of 5 362\npeople wherein they were shown to be\nhappier and more content as adults if\nthey felt their parents were less\npsychologically controlling and more\ncaring when they were young\nnumber three you disappoint me\nwhen your child gets to know that\nthey're a disappointment to you it can\nmake them feel inadequate as they're not\nable to meet the standards you've set\nfor them as their parents by saying this\nyou're telling them that they don't live\nup to your expectations and therefore\nfeelings of unworthiness flow from\nwithin number four\nit's your fault now think of yourself as\na five-year-old playing around the house\nand you accidentally knock over a\nbeautiful vase sitting on the shelf one\nof your parents comes home from work and\nthey unleash their intense anger and\nrage on you\nhow are you as a five-year-old bound to\nfeel\nthe impact of a parent's rage may be\nfelt by children even after they grow up\nwhich can include Rising depression\nsocial alienation and abuse in a study\ninvolving children aged five to six\nthose who enacted achievement situations\nin which teacher criticism was presented\nwere more likely to make Global negative\nself-judgments including negative\njudgments of their goodness number five\nwhy don't you try to be more like them\nit's natural to idolize someone but\nasking a child to be like someone else\ndoes not only make them feel ignored but\nunaccepted the way they are this\nconstant comparison by their supposed\nstrongest Ally whether intentional or\nnot can have devastating consequences\nfor a child as a result many people\nsuffer from low self-esteem chronic\nself-doubt and even depression\nnumber six you're too sensitive not\nletting a child feel their emotions is\none of the worst things a parent could\never do emotional neglect follows when a\nparent fails to pay attention to their\nchild's emotional needs as a result they\nstop seeking support and these issues\ncan get manifested in their adult life\nthey might end up feeling clueless while\ntrying to deal with their emotions in a\n2021 longitudinal study of\n3265 children it was found that\nchildhood emotional neglect was\nsignificantly associated with depressive\nsymptoms and late adolescence\nthe emotionally neglected children are\nprone to feeling guilty becoming\nemotionally unavailable themselves and\nhave a hard time trusting others worst\ncase they may even keep such a parenting\nstyle running when it's their turn seven\nthey have it worse than you\nhave you heard of the term toxic\npositivity let's break it down if a\nchild indicates that they need their\nparents to acknowledge the sad and\ndepressed emotions that they're feeling\nbut all they're offered is a remark\nwhich forces them to be grateful for\nwhat they have\nthe child is likely to feel that their\nemotions are invalidated this will full\nsuppression of negative emotions

emotional experiences were\ncommon and number eight we'll do this\nthe next time we're here\nchildren can be fuzzy and adamant on\nthings however that doesn't mean it's\nokay for parents to make empty promises\nabout instances that they know very well\nwon't happen according to research by\nKen Geiser koymon and tomasello in 2017\nyoung kids honor their own word and\nanticipate that others will do the same\ngetting a promise broken by a parent can\nbe viewed as betrayal by a child and may\ndeteriorate the relationship whereas\nwhen that word is kept it can help\nFoster a sense of trust and certainty\neach parent comes with their own flaws\neven when they blurred out these things\nunintentionally a child can be easily\ninfluenced have you heard these phrases\nbefore let us know which ones and the\nimpact they had on you\n[Music]"
