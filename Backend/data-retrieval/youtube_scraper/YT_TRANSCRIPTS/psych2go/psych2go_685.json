hidden getting rejected is\nsimply out of the question so we can't\njust ask if you can relate here are some\nnon-verbal signs your crush likes you to\nmake it easier to ask them out\nthe window to the soul and heart\ncan you really know someone's true\nfeelings by staring into their eyes you\nmay have heard the saying the eyes are\nthe windows to the soul before but do\nyou know that pupils are literally the\nwindows to the eye cognitive\npsychologist Dr David Ludden explained\nthat the eyes may reveal a great deal\nabout another person's emotional state\nfurthermore according to a 2015 study\nabout pupil size it was found that the\nsize of your pupils speaks volumes about\nyour emotions and intentions since we\ncan't control the size of our pupils our\npupils are a genuine indication of\nsexual or social interest\nthe bigger the pupils the more\ninterested we are imagine you're\npolitely pretending to be interested in\nwhat your neighbor is saying as she\ndescribes every detail of her trip to\nthe spa you're so committed to your\ncharacter that you decide to fake a\nsmile even though your mouth is smiling\nyour pupils will be small giving away\nthe fact that you couldn't be less\ninterested\nokay what does this mean\nthe next time your crush looks at you\nlock eyes and just for a moment do their\npupils get bigger if so this might be a\nsign they have a crush on you\npreening\nwhen you're getting ready for a date do\nyou spend the majority of the time in\nfront of a mirror making sure\neverything's in its place\ncourse you want to make a good\nimpression but what about your crush\ndoes your crush brush their hair away\nfrom their face while you look away\nmaybe they tuck at their clothes and\nbrush off lint when they see you\nunexpectedly according to a study led by\nresearcher John dally these patterns of\nbehaviors oriented towards improving\none's physical appearance in Social\nenvironments are known as preening yeah\nlike a bird researchers Mark Knapp led a\nstudy that explained that we Preen more\nwhen we're forming an intimate\nconnection rather than when we're in a\ncommitted relationship what does this\nmean we usually Preen ourselves in the\nflirting or Crush phase of the\nrelationship to get them interested more\nthan those in a committed relationship\nso if you notice that your crush has\nsome oh my God how do I look moments\nthey might like you\noff balance or magnetism the next time\nyou're talking to your crush take a\nmoment to check how your body looks\nwhere are your arms and legs where is\nyour body facing are you leaning in any\ndirection couple's therapist Terry\norbuck stated in Women's Health magazine\nthat when someone is leaning towards you\nit gives a signal of interest and trust\nthis can even mean that they want to be\nphysically closer to you or intimate\nwith you how does your body look when\nyou're mad crossed arms not facing the\nperson you're mad at strong stance with\nhip popped out if you're standing legs\ncrossed if you're sitting the next time\nyou're sitting in front of your crush\nlook at their body posture is their body\nangled towards you is there chair\npositioned nearer to yours if so there\nmay be a high possibility that they like\nyou Mirror Mirror according to sex and\nrelationship therapist Courtney getter\nin a mind-body green article we\nunconsciously imitate someone's\nbehaviors mannerisms and other gestures\nwhen we find them attractive this active\nimitation is known as mirroring it's a\nnon-verbal way to demonstrate empathy\nand affection a signal of connecting and\nbonding and that you're engaged in the\nconversation you're having does your\ncrush uncross their legs after you\nuncross yours do they speak using the\nsame words as yours professor of\nPsychology and Neuroscience Dr Yuri\nHassan and his colleagues found that\nthese shared behaviors are more than\njust mirroring functional MRIs were used\nto investigate the brain movements of\nlisteners and speakers they found that\nthe listeners brain movements react to\nthe speakers and the connection becomes\na wireless form of cerebral bonding So\nafter talking with and hanging out with\nthat special someone enough mirroring\ntends to be the result well I guess it's\ntrue as the saying goes imitation is the\nsincerest form of flattery you\nremembered let's say one of your friends\nsuggests in the group chat that you all\ngo for dinner at a seafood restaurant\nsuddenly your crush speaks up and\nsuggests the new Indian restaurant\ninstead because they remember you're\nallergic to Seafood marriage and family\ntherapist Allison Osborne Corcoran\nreveals in a best life article that when\na person is interested in you they make\nan effort to catch even the smallest\ndetails or things you've mentioned to\nthem even in passing maybe they'll\nremember your order at Starbucks or even\nyour cat's birthday cognitive\npsychologist Dr Sandra langleg led a\nstudy that demonstrated when we admire\nsomeone we tend to remember information\nassociated with them better for example\na person is more likely to notice and\nremember their beloved's favorite dish\non a restaurant menu or which pillow is\nyour favorite to lay on they remember\nthose seemingly insignificant details\nbecause the person is significant to\nthem when we care about someone we make\nan effort to recall things that are\nsignificant to the person there is no\nSurefire method to know if someone likes\nyou unless they explicitly tell you\nhowever actions always speak louder than\nwords if they like you they'll show you\nbut sometimes you have to take the first\nstep yourself and simply ask life is too\nshort to spend time second guessing\nright are there other non-verbal signs\nyou can use to tell if someone likes you\nlet us know in the comments we hope\nthese signs help you to ask your crush\nout thanks for watching and we'll see\nyou next time"
