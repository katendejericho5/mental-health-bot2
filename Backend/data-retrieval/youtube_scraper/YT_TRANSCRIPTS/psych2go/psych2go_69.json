    "transcript": "has anyone ever given you bad advice\nbefore well you're not alone but what\nmade you realize it was bad advice in\nthe first place was it just a gut\nfeeling a Pang of Doubt or a light bulb\nmoment where the better answer suddenly\ncame to you we all receive a fair share\nof wisdom from friends family and the\noccasional self-help book but sometimes\nit's The Road Less travel that leads to\nthe most exciting destinations so let's\ndive head first into some conventional\nwisdom that you're probably better off\nnot taking to heart and why money can't\nbuy happiness we've all heard the saying\nmoney can't buy happiness but let's face\nit the world's like a persistent\nsalesperson always trying to convince us\notherwise sure not everyone's dreaming\nof being a CEO or having a goldplated\nyach and a lot of the time building\npersonal wealth can feel like a slow\nfrustrating uphill climb but let's be\nreal Financial insecurity and\ninstability is so much more terrible for\na person's mental health yes money\ndoesn't guarantee happiness but having\nenough to cover the basics and enjoy a\nfew luxuries certainly goes a long way\nin helping us find it faster and easier\nin the end it's all about striking that\nbalance between Financial comfort and\nour other priorities in life fake it\ntill you make it faking it till you make\nit seems like good advice to build a\nperson's confidence and go off after\nwhat they want right but be careful not\nto buy too much into this idea because\nit overlooks the value of time and\neffort in achieving success all of the\ngreats put in the work to consistently\nlearn practice and fail at what they do\nbefore mastering it true confidence\nisn't built on a shaky Foundation of\npretending but rather on a dedication to\nlearning stumbling and Rising again\nFollow Your Passion Above All Else\npassion is often hailed as the golden\nticket to happiness and fulfillment in\nlife but what if I told you there's more\nto the story sure having something\nyou're passionate about is great but\nblindly pursuing it without considering\npracticality and sustainability will no\ndoubt leave you burnt out and eventually\nresenting the very thing you love take\nCamelia Clark's advice for aspiring\nactors for example she says not to\nbecome an actor unless you're absolutely\nsure most of being an actor is being\nunemployed and if there's anything else\nyou can do I mean this is from the\nbottom of my heart that would bring you\nJoy do that instead I've had some of the\nbest moments of my life doing it but\nI've had some of the worst and you've\ngot to be there for the worst and you've\ngot to ride through the worst to get the\nbest so rather than following your\npassion Above All Else align your\npassion with your purpose balance it\nwith pragmaticism and you'll find\nyourself on the road to more fulfilling\nendeavors\nsuccess means doing it alone in a world\nthat glorifies self-made success stories\nit's easy to fall into the Trap of\nbelieving you have to go it alone but\nhere's the reality check behind every\nTriumph there's a team mentors\ncollaborators and loved ones cheering\nyou on thinking that success means doing\nit alone will make your journey so much\nharder and the destination much less\nsweeter when you reach it so don't be\nafraid to lean on others and learn to\nask for help when you need it surround\nyourself with people who Inspire and\nuplift you in the words of Helen Keller\nalone we can do so little together we\ncan do so\nmuch never give up ever heard of the\nsunk cost fallacy it's like ordering a\nterrible meal but finishing it because\nyou've already paid well life can be a\nbit like that too when we're stuck in a\nbad situation sometimes we don't just\ncut our losses and move on but continue\nto cling stubborn to a sinking ship sure\nresilience is important but so is\nknowing when to change course and quit\nwhile you're ahead it's okay if your\nbusiness fails or your relationships end\nno matter how hard you try you can't\nforce things to work out but the good\nnews is life is constantly moving\nforward and when one door closes another\nalways opens so instead of never giving\nup learn to Pivot and adapt\ninstead avoid failure at all costs we've\nalways been fed the idea that failure is\nthe sworn enemy of success right well\nlet us let you in on a little secret\nfailure isn't the end of the world in\nfact plenty of the most successful\npeople on the planet have failed more\nthan a few times in their life before\nsoaring to Greatness Walt Disney faced\nrejection and bankruptcy before turning\nhis dreams into Reality Steve Jobs was\nonce shown the door by the very company\nhe founded even the iconic Beatles were\ninitially rejected by a record label\nbecause failure isn't a full start it's\na comma in the sentence of your\nautobiography so Embrace failure as a\nstepping stone not a stumbling block in\nthe wise words of Michael Jordan I\nfailed over and over and over again in\nmy life and that is why I succeed\nremember life is not a one-size fits-all\njourney and the advice that works for\none person might not resonate with\nanother in a world brimming with\nwell-meaning suggestions and\nconventional wisdom it's important that\nyou know how to think for yourself and\nquestion
