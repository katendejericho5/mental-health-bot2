    "transcript": "depression and anxiety are now being\nspoken about readily in mainstream\nSociety this means that there are also a\nplethora of resources that discuss how\nto deal with it when times are bad these\ncan range from that grounded in science\nall the way to the personal testimony\ntaken as fact so what actually works one\nof the more grounded theories is based\non diet not going on a diet but what\nkind of foods you eat dietary changes\naren't a cure but they can help with the\nsymptoms of depression the dietary\nrecommendations have also varied across\nstudies but there were some similar\nsuggestions that ran through most of\nthem let's take a look at those because\neating smarter is never a Bad Thing\nnumber one healthy fats that's right\nfats can be healthy these fats often\nhave fancier names like Omega something\nor monounsaturated and polyunsaturated\nwhere do you find them well looking at\nthe fins they have a diet high in fish\nchicken and cheese that's low in the bad\nfat group they found this diet helped\nprotect or prevent middle-aged Finnish\nmen from depressive symptoms is it magic\nno it's inflammation reduction at least\npartially see depression is associated\nwith inflammatory activation of the\nimmune system and that wreaks havoc on\nthe nervous system what follows then are\nall the icky symptoms like fatigue or\nchronic discomfort okay antidepressants\nhave been shown to decrease inflammation\ntoo so maybe we're on to something other\nplaces you can munch on these good fats\nare by eating fish that have their\nomega-3 game on point like salmon tuna\nand mackerel is it just us or do you\nfeel like some sushi too if you're more\non the vegan side of things avocados and\nnuts like walnuts and pecans work too\nnumber two plenty of fruits and\nvegetables so speaking of them avocados\nfruits and vegetables generally do help\nreduce inflammation in addition to\nproviding vitamins as if that weren't\nalready pretty sweet fruits and veggies\nalso have another secret weapon\nantioxidants\nhey that's a real term and a real thing\nkeep watching we'll explain depression\nand anxiety cause Oodles of stress\nthat's stress like any evil entity has\nhenchmen one of them is called oxidative\nstress oxidative stress will mess you up\nits activities hinder your body's\nability to detox and repair itself and\ncan actually change your brain structure\nit's also been linked to other baddies\nlike Alzheimer's ALS and multiple\nsclerosis so here's where the fruit and\nveggie superheroes come in that\nantioxidant weapon neutralizes the\nhenchman's activities the henchman\ncauses an imbalance and the antioxidants\nrestore the balance evil plan foiled you\ncan gear up on this with berries leafy\ngreens beets and bonus dark chocolate\nyep we said chocolate number three to be\nwell have some B12 and B9\nyes we meant vitamin B9 as in folic acid\nnot benign although if you like the pun\nwe'll take it seriously though folic\nacid and b12 are both necessary for the\nproduction of Serotonin serotonin a mood\nstabilizer is one of the five happy\nhormones so you definitely want that\nproduction going smoothly serotonin is\nproduced in the gut so when you're\nfeeding yourself folic acid and b12 rich\nfoods they're feeding it too so have\nsome poached eggs cheese maybe a banana\nand be happy number four love the green\nas a whole did you know that a grain has\nlayers you've got the outside bit called\nthe hull then a fibery bit called the\nbran under that the starches and the\ninnermost bit called The Germ now we get\nrid of the hull because that's not\nreally edible and from the bran to The\nGerm that is whole grain goodness much\nof the Shiny Bright Foods we can get in\nthe stores like white bread only\ncontains starches and germ hey they got\nrid of the brand layer that brand layers\ngot Goods like B vitamins and minerals\nwell the inclusion of the grain as a\nwhole is a big part of diets like the\nMediterranean and alternative healthy\neating index diet and has been shown to\nreduce the risk of depressive symptoms\nthe Mediterranean diet includes some of\nthe previously mentioned helpful foods\nand consists of whole grains vegetables\nlegumes fruits nuts seeds and spices\nnumber five consider taking amino acids\namino acids might sound all sciency but\nnot to worry they're simple so simple in\nfact they're building blocks they're the\nbuilding blocks that make proteins we\nneed them yet our bodies don't produce\nthem so we have to eat them one of those\nwe need it but don't make it amino acids\nis tryptophan tryptophan is essential to\nmake serotonin so you may need enough of\nthis you've heard about how tryptophan\nis in all sorts of food from chicken to\nTurkey to tofu so eat up foods like\nquinoa eggs and red meat contain all the\namino acids so take care of your gut and\ndig in and number six go low sugar\ncutting back on sugar has become a\npopular Trend nowadays and for good\nreason taking in an overabundance of\nsugar not only limits collagen\nproduction but can also impact your\nmental health\nunlike the helpers mentioned before\nsugar increases inflammation making\ndepressive symptoms worse sugar is hard\nto avoid though because it's sort of\nwell everywhere the good news is that\nit's not really sugar that you have to\nwatch out for it's the glycemic index\nyou want to keep low the glycemic index\nis a measure of how quickly a food makes\nblood sugar rise\nthe GI can even change depending on how\na food is prepared like a baked potato\nhaving a higher GI than a boiled one a\nquick check on a food's glycemic index\nwill help you on your journey of healthy\neating you are what you eat we know this\nand yet often forget that our bodies are\nnot solo instruments but a whole chorus\nOpera and Orchestra working together it\nonly makes sense that what we digest\nwill have a domino effect on everything\nelse have you heard of any of these tips\nbefore did we give you maybe some\nhealthier alternative snacking ideas\nplease remember that before implementing\nany drastic changes have a chat with\nyour doctor we hope you enjoyed the\nvideo feel free to like and share and\nsee you next time"
