    "transcript": "American writer Isaac Asimov once wrote\nin life unlike chess the game continues\nafter checkmate\nthis is how life after trauma often\nfeels after our King gets captured and\nwe feel like the game is lost\nstill have to keep playing\nand just like the chessboard the game of\nlife holds different pieces we may\nexperience trauma in different ways in\nthis video we'd like to validate some of\nthe experiences you may have encountered\nthose traumatic events that felt like a\ngame last and most importantly keep\nwatching until the end to learn how to\nheal and be the one to give the final\nCheckmate let's begin\nthe mean voices let's start with\nchildhood a time when trauma is supposed\nto be just a weird unknown word for many\nchildhood becomes a bitter memory of\nbullying have you ever been bullied do\nyou still feel that sting when you\nremember\nsome people might wave their hand and\nsay ah kids will be kids\nbut researchers wouldn't agree according\nto a 2015 research paper published in\narchives of disease in childhood the\nbullying you went through may have been\nso traumatic that you still feel its\neffect today maybe you have trouble\ntrusting people and making friends or\nhave very low self-esteem and sometimes\nall those mocking mean looks and toxic\nwords your bullies sent your way leave a\npermanent scar\na post-traumatic stress disorder a 2012\nstudy published in Journal of abnormal\nchild psychology found that between 30\nand 40 percent of bullied teens show\nsymptoms of clinical PTSD\nso if someone tries to downplay what you\nwent through don't let them being\noverwhelmed by Trauma from this\nexperience is completely valid\na broken home trauma might have found\nyou inside your home the same home that\nwas supposed to be filled with family\nwarmth and love but sometimes love Fades\nand families break with one word divorce\naccording to Census Data 15 of every one\nthousand marriages ended in divorce in\n2019 and even though divorce is a\ndifficult experience for the couple\nchildren get especially hurt by it were\nyou a child of divorce if your parents\nseparated when you were young it's\npossible it felt like the end of the\nworld maybe you were afraid that your\nparents would stop loving you just as\nthey stopped loving each other or maybe\nyou felt guilty like it was somehow your\nfault Scott Carroll said for\nfatherly.com that children often deeply\ninternalize their parents divorce and\nalthough they might learn how to deal\nall those intense feelings can be so\ntraumatic for a young child's heart that\nthey struggle with consequences in\nadulthood\nstab in the back\nlove is not only destroyed by divorce\nsometimes it breaks due to the ultimate\nbetrayal infidelity\nhave you ever been cheated on\nbeing betrayed this way by someone you\nthought loved you can feel like the end\nof the world\nmay seem like your trust towards anyone\njust got shattered into a million pieces\njust like your heart\nand for some these fears persist even\nafter the ones who betray us are long\ngone that's when you might experience a\ntype of anxiety which is unofficially\ncalled post infidelity stress disorder a\n2013 study published in the Indian\nJournal of psychiatric nursing suggests\nthat people who experience this disorder\nhave symptoms similar to PTSD they keep\nre-experiencing that trauma they avoid\nanything that reminds them of it and\nthey feel emotionally numb detached or\nangry the hatred of people\nanother trauma is born out of something\nthat should be celebrated\nbut instead often looked down upon\ndiversity\nmany individuals are subjected to abuse\njust because they're not the same as\ntheir abusers we're talking about\ndiscrimination based on race sexuality\nreligion nationality gender and any\nother characteristic it's not just a\nterrible Act of Injustice towards a\nhuman being and their rights\naccording to a 2016 research study\npublished in the Journal of\npsychological trauma\nexperiencing discrimination often leaves\na deep psychological scar that also\nmimics PTSD a recent 2022 research study\npublished an American Journal of\nPsychiatry even suggests that racial\ntrauma hopelessness and depression can\nbe passed down from one generation to\nanother through the red light\nfinally trauma is not always caused by\nemotional factors physical events can\nleave an impact on our souls and bodies\ntoo one common example of this is\ntraffic accidents we hope you never had\nto go through a car accident but if you\nhave you may have felt frightened for a\nvery long time after it happened\na 2018 research paper published in BMC\nPsychiatry shows that after the accident\nyou may suffer from an acute stress\ndisorder a stress response that occurs\nwithin a month of a traumatic event if\nleft untreated this condition can lead\nto an actual PTSD diagnosis\nyou may start having flashbacks\ndisturbing nightmares about the event\nand try to avoid traffic at any cost let\nyourself heal\nhave you experienced some of these\nevents or some other type of trauma if\nso we want you to know that it's 100\npossible to set yourself free from these\nexperiences because as Carl Jung said\nI am not what happened to me I am what I\nchoose to become and choosing a path to\nrecovery is the best gift you can give\nyourself\nthis path is often described through\nthree stages in our 2002 research paper\nJudith Hermann MD talks about these\nstages\nthe first stage is establishing safety\nthat's when you'll realize that the past\nis the past and it cannot hurt you\nanymore\nafter you know you're safe you'll begin\nto start the second phase reconstruction\nthis phase might be painful since you'll\nbegin to share your traumatic story but\nthis is very important in your healing\nbecause it will allow you to process\nreclaim and transform your painful\nmemories\nand finally the final stage of recovery\nis integration and post-trauma growth\nthat's when you'll be building your new\nsense of self the one that's filled with\nself-love self-compassion and strength\ntherapy is especially important if your\ntrauma caused you to suffer from a\nStress Disorder so please seek\nprofessional help if you need it could\nyou be struggling with complex PTSD\nwatch this video to find out\n[Music]"
