    "transcript": "do you have an inner critic living in\nyour mind rent-free or is your inner\nvoice gentle and encouraging we all talk\nto ourselves throughout the day but\nsometimes we may forget to be kind to\nour own minds\nyou try to be polite and compassionate\nwhen you talk to other people but not to\nyourself\nbeing nice shouldn't be reserved only\nfor others after all the way you talk to\nyourself can impact how you feel how you\nsee the world and most importantly your\nmental health\ncould your inner voice be making you\ndepressed well this video is here to\nhelp you recognize some signs of toxic\nself-talk towards the end you'll find\nsome tips on what steps you can take to\nhelp yourself so number one over\ngeneralization\nI never do anything right I always mess\nit up nobody likes me do some of these\nphrases often go through your mind\nthis way of inner thought is called over\ngeneralization when you over generalize\nyou see a single negative event as a\nnever-ending pattern of defeat you\nassume the worst and believe that one\nlittle mistake equals failure\nfor example getting a low score on a\nmath exam automatically means you are\nterrible at math\nor maybe you go through a bad breakup\nand start believing you're bad at\nrelationships in general or even\nunlovable according to research\npublished in the biological Psychiatry\nJournal this type of thinking has been\nassociated with anxiety disorders\nif you speak that way to yourself too\noften it takes a toll on your self-image\nthat's like I'm not good enough or I\ncould never be successful could keep you\nfrom fulfilling your full potential and\nharm your professional or school life\nnumber two personalization\ndoes your inner voice make you feel\nguilty does it blame you for things all\nthe time this is personalization\nbelieving you're responsible for events\nthat in reality are out of your control\nfor example your date gets canceled and\nyou instantly think they changed their\nmind because they're not interested in\nyou in reality maybe something urgent\ncame up but you're toxic in her voice\nturns it against you\na study published in the European\nJournal of Psychiatry found that\npersonalization is generally connected\nto heightened anxiety another\ninteresting study published in the\njournal psychology of Aesthetics\ncreativity and arts examined the link\nbetween depression and personalization\nby studying depressed poetry writers\nresearchers found a slight tendency for\ndepressed poets to engage in more\npersonalization but this inner talk is\nnot poetic at all it only makes you lose\nconfidence and joy\nnumber three mental filtering do you\nsometimes tend to focus on negative\ndetails for example when getting\nfeedback from your boss or a teacher the\nfeedback may be generally good but one\nlittle critique catches your eye would\nyou instantly forget everything else and\ndwell on that one negative mark this\ntrain of thought is called mental\nfiltering it's like filtering out the\npositives of a situation in some cases\nit may be hard to see positive aspects\nof things but looking at things in\nnegative ways can make you feel anxious\nand depressed over time mental filtering\ncan become an automatic habit and easily\ngrow into a pessimistic Outlook\nresearchers in 2017 found that this\nnegative perspective makes you feel\nhopeless about life it can also trigger\nfeelings of sadness disappointment anger\nand fear\na great way to combat mental filtering\nis practicing gratitude if you're\ninterested in how gratitude Works feel\nfree to check out this video\nand number four polarization\npolarization means you're thinking about\nyourself and the world in an All or\nNothing way\nyou see things in extremes they're\neither black or white without a gray\narea between them\nfor example you may decide to eat\nhealthy and cut down on sugar but one\nday you just can't resist and you take a\nbite of your favorite chocolate bar\nso you think to yourself my diet is\nruined now I shouldn't even try anymore\ndo you think like that sometimes\nbut why would one cheat day mean that\nyour whole progress is ruined all of a\nsudden\nthis type of thinking leads to\nunrealistic standards and it lowers your\nmotivation as a result you're\nunintentionally setting yourself up for\nfailure\npolarization can also hurt your\nrelationships that's because shifting\nfrom idealizing to devaluing people like\nthey're either great or terrible and\nmake it harder for others to enjoy your\ncompany and back to the chocolate bar\nyour eating habits could suffer a study\npublished in journal eating behaviors\nfound that polarized thinking may make\nyou look at certain foods as either good\nor bad consider your body is either\nperfect or revolting or eat and binge or\nfasting Cycles\nhow to help yourself\nso how do you help yourself when your\nmind wanders into this territory\nfirst you should pay attention to how\nyou talk to yourself it's important to\nnotice and realize toxic thoughts when\nthey happen after you realize your inner\nvoice is negative challenge it\ntake a step back and consider these\nquestions\nis there evidence that supports my\nthoughts\nam I considering all angles or am I\nleaving things out\nas everyone else see it this way and\nfinally reframe what you think research\npublished in the journal developmental\ncognitive Neuroscience found that\nreframing can be a powerful tool against\ntoxic self-talk\nit's a process where you identify\nnegative thoughts and replace them with\npositive and empowering ones for example\ninstead of saying I never do anything\nright try consciously saying something\nlike I am capable of doing things\nsuccessfully at first it may feel silly\ntalking to yourself that way but a study\npublished in Jama Psychiatry shows that\nwith practice this technique helped\npeople decrease the symptoms of anxiety\nand depression so at least consider\ngiving it a try\ndo you resonate with some of these\npoints would you like to challenge our\ntoxic inner voice and talk to yourself\nwith love and compassion let us know in\nthe
