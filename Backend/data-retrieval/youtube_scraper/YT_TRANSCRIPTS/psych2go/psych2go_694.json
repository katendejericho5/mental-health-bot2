dang\nI'm stinky\nthere may actually be something else\ngoing on according to research our body\nodor can surprisingly reveal a few\ninteresting things about us we know what\nyou're thinking really how but there's\nsome pretty fascinating studies some\npublished by renowned researchers on\nwhat exactly our scent may say about us\neven if we're unaware initially what\nthose things are\nso we're about to break down some scent\nstudies for you here are a few of the\nthings our body odor reveals about us\nnumber one if you're attracted to\nsomeone\ndo you have a crush are you hoping\nthey're just as attracted to you as you\nare to them well you may want to pile on\nthe fragrance or not Swiss biological\nresearcher Klaus whitakind is known for\nhis famous 1995 sweaty t-shirt study in\nthe study researchers had 44 men wear a\nclean cotton t-shirt for two nights one\ndays left the men were told to keep the\nt-shirts in an open plastic bag when\nthey weren't wearing it they were also\ngiven odor-free deodorants and told not\nto eat any spicy foods or participate in\nany activities that could affect the\nsmell of their t-shirt the day after the\nmale participants two nights in these\ncotton t-shirts the researchers then\nplaced the shirts in identical boxes and\nhad 49 women smell each box one at a\ntime\nt-shirts were separated into boxes based\noff the MHC jeans three shirts that were\nsimilar MHC jeans in a box and three\nshirts from males with dissimilar MHC\njeans where possible women smiled the\nshirts during the second week of their\nmenstrual cycle so what did the\nresearchers find women who weren't on\noral contraceptives preferred the men\nwith MHC genes different from theirs\nthis was after they rated the scents\nbased on their pleasantness intensity\nand sexiness the study even states that\nthe odors of MHC dissimilar men remind\nthe test women more often of their own\nactual or former mates than do the odors\nof MHC similar men so did your crush\nturn you down it could just be due to\nyour dissimilar MHC jeans my friend too\nbad or they just weren't feeling it nah\nit's probably your armpits number\nill did you know that your scent can\nreveal if you're sick a study published\nin European Urology found that a dog\ntrained to recognize the smell of\nprostate cancer could identify 30 out of\n33 prostate cancer patients correctly\nbased on the smell of their urine\nsamples\ntime to train Buster open the toilet\nseat but what about t-shirt smells again\nwell in another study researchers\ninjected subjects with a compound that\nwould mess with their immune system\nmaking it seem as if they were sick the\nresearchers then had other participants\nwhile their t-shirts and you guessed it\nthe participants could identify which\npeople were more likely sick number\nthree if you are extroverted neurotic or\ndominant are you extroverted dominant\nneurotic unsure time to smell your\narmpits a 2012 study published in the\nEuropean Journal of Personality found\nthat people who were neurotic or\ndominant could be identified by their\nscent\nhow did they collect these 10 samples\nyou may ask you guessed it cotton\nt-shirts a classic 30 male and 30 female\nsubjects wore a cotton t-shirt for three\ndays straight then 100 males and 100\nfemales rated the T-shirt scent the\nratings were then compared to a\nself-assessed personality test the\nT-shirt wearing subjects took before\nthere was a connection from scent to\nthree personality types extroversion\ndominance and neuroticism subjects with\nthose self-assessed personality traits\nhad specific sense that kept being\nidentified from the participants who\nrated those smelly T's number four\nreveals your age can someone smell their\nage a 2012 study published in the plos\none found that the elderly actually have\na specific scent the study States body\nodors were sampled from three distinct\nage groups young 20 to 30 years old\nmiddle age 45 to 55 and old age 75 to 95\nindividuals Perpetual ratings and age\ndiscrimination performance were assessed\nin 41 young participants\nwere these body odors sampled from\ncotton t-shirts we may never know but\nthe study findings are pretty\ninteresting the study explains\nparticipants were able to discriminate\nbetween age categories with body odor\nfrom old age donors mediating the effect\nalso after removing variants explained\nby intensity differences similarly\nparticipants were able to correctly\nassign age labels to body odors\noriginating from old age donors but not\nto body odors originating from other age\ngroups\nso do old people have a distinct smell\naccording to this study they may and no\nit's not the smell of old books or\nchicken casserole number five what

after\neating junk food Alters the makeup of\nperspiration in some people when it\ncombines with bacteria on the skin\nleading to changes in odor so if you\ndon't want to smell like your blood
