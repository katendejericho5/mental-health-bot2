    "transcript": "has anyone ever told you you were too\nnice for your own good do you often feel\nlike being too much of a people pleaser\nhas a negative impact on your life\nwhile it's easy to beat ourselves up for\nthe way we let people treat us\npsychologists have actually discovered\nthat being this way having a fond\nresponse as they call it is one of the\nways we adapt to perceived threats and\ninternalize our trauma to be more\nspecific it was therapist Pete Walker\nwho first studied and wrote about this\nphenomenon in his book complex PTSD from\nsurviving to thriving\nWalker who specializes in cases of C\nPTSD defines fawning as a maladaptive\nway of creating safety in our\ninterpersonal relationships by\nessentially mirroring the imagined\nexpectations needs and desires of others\nthis happens when our sympathetic\nnervous system becomes activated due to\nsome perceived threat in our environment\nour bodies will then go into either\nfight flight freeze or Fawn mode and\nwhen someone experiences something\ntraumatic early on in their life it can\nkeep them stuck in one of these four\nmodes so basically fawning is a\nmaladaptive response to extreme\npsychological stress\nwith that said here are seven telltale\nsigns according to experts that your\nproblem with being too nice just might\nactually be fawning a manifestation of\nyour trauma\nnumber one you don't feel seen if you\nare someone who's prone to fawning\nyou're probably the go-to person for a\nlot of people whenever they need a favor\nor want some help with something this is\nbecause according to self-help expert\nPhoebe prep when we Fawn we disregard\nour own wants and needs and decide in\nthat moment that the one thing that's\nimportant is giving the other person\nwhat they want and need and by being too\nmuch of a giver you end up struggling to\nfeel seen by others for who you are as a\nperson and not just what you can do for\nthem\nnumber two your values become\ncompromised one of the reasons why\nfawning as a trauma response can impact\nus so negatively is because it erodes\nour sense of self according to an\narticle by the dawn Wellness Center in\nrehab people fond to avoid conflict and\nTrauma by over-appusing people but this\ncan lead them to compromise their values\na lot of the time people who are like\nthis often find it difficult to stand up\nfor themselves and what they believe in\nand instead validate behaviors attitudes\nor views that they don't even agree with\nnumber three you feel responsible for\nother people's reactions\nanother important Point brought up by\nthe dawn Wellness Center and Rehab in\nthe article mentioned earlier was the\nfawning types tend to feel a misplaced\nsense of guilt and responsibility over\nother people's feelings and reactions in\nfact they're usually more invested in\nthe happiness comfort and validation of\nother people than they are in their own\nthis can manifest as strong feelings of\nguilt self-blame and self-loathing over\nthe negative reactions of others towards\nthings that aren't even their fault or\nin their control\nnumber four\nyou're terrified of making decisions for\nothers similar to our earlier Point\nfawning is a trauma response can make us\nterrified of choosing things for other\npeople even something is inconsequential\nas where to eat dinner or recommending a\nshow to someone can leave us reeling\nfrom intense dread and panic wondering\noh no what if they hate it why well\naccording to an article by Psychology\ntoday this is because your constant need\nto please others and always looking to\nthem for how you should feel makes you\ndoubt or disregard your own feelings and\nexperiences\nnumber five you feel guilty about\ngetting them angry\naccording to the mental health experts\nat Kiran trauma clinics people who tend\nto Fawn as a trauma response commonly\nexperience deep feelings of anger and\nguilt towards themselves because of it\nthey don't allow themselves to get angry\nat others for taking advantage of them\nor disrespecting their boundaries\nevery time they even try to speak up\nabout it they feel immensely guilty and\ninstead end up enabling and excusing the\nbad behaviors and mistreatment of others\nyou over apologize\nmuch like our earlier Point fawning as a\ndrama response often results in a lack\nof personal boundaries low self-esteem\nand loss of personal agency and autonomy\nin the most common manifestation of all\nof these\nover apologizing this is because fawning\noften stems from rejection trauma so in\norder to avoid being rejected by others\nwe learn to take the blame for\neverything and just apologize to keep\nthe peace\nand number seven\nyou don't know how to say no\nlast but certainly not least not knowing\nhow to say no to people is arguably the\nmost telling sign of all that being too\nnice isn't your problem\nit's your trauma response fawning and\naccording to an article from sex Central\nfun types are almost always stretched\ntoo thin they're so weird to please\nother people that they say yes to\neverything no matter how inconvenient or\ntiresome the worst part however is that\nthey overwork themselves not because\nthey just genuinely have so much love\nenergy and patience to give but because\nthey fear that the moment they say no\nothers will immediately turn on them\nso do you relate to any of the things\nwe've mentioned here did learning about\nall these signs make you realize you\nmight be fawning as a result of some\nunresolved trauma\nwhile we might think that fawning and\npeople-pleasing is the ideal way of\nbuilding relationships with others these\nconnections will ultimately be draining\ninauthentic and unfulfilling for us\nbecause it doesn't allow us to have our\nown sense of identity or validate our\nown feelings and experiences\nif you are seriously struggling with\nrecovery from trauma please don't\nhesitate to reach out to a mental health\ncare professional today and seek help\nand to quote self-help Guru Phoebe brieb\nbeing a nice person means making your\nown wants and needs but also listening\nto what other people want and need and\nfinding a middle ground this is\nexercising kind communication unlike\nfawning which is never asserting our own\nwants and needs kindness is not\nequivalent to being a doormat erasing\nyour sense of self or never speaking up\nfor yourself"
