    "transcript": "do you have that one person that gives\nyou butterflies when you speak to them\nand leaves you feeling the flutters\nafter being around them just for a\nlittle while\nyou know you like them for some reason\nbut you can't exactly figure out if they\nfeel the same way\nyou think do they keep smiling at me to\nbe friendly or because there's something\nmore are they laughing at my jokes just\nto be nice or because they genuinely\nthink I'm funny are they hanging out\nwith me for fun or because they want to\nget closer making new relationships is a\nchallenging task in itself but having to\nfigure out if this person likes you back\ncan be exhausting when they're giving\nyou mixed signals\nbefore you get carried away with your\nfeelings for this person let's slow down\nfor a second and think about the\npossibilities\nsure it may seem like they're having a\ngood time with you but what if their\noutward happiness is coming from\nsomewhere or someone else let's explore\nsome signs that someone is in love but\nnot with you\nexcuses scenario one you two may have\nyour moments of fun hanging out but then\nwhen you try to make plans with them\nagain they keep coming up with an excuse\nfor something else they got going on\nFriday Night comes around you're\nscrolling through social media and Bam\nthere they are in their cute outfit\nposting selfies and story updates with\ntheir friends hashtag Friday Vibes more\nlike hashtag sad vibes\nand that's if they even tried to make an\nexcuse to avoid making you feel left out\nyou give it a fair shot by asking if\nthey want to hang out a few times but\nthey bring up plans they have with other\npeople or a suspiciously special other\nperson\nit seems like this person is going out\nof their way to hang out with others and\nnot so much with you it's likely that\nthey don't feel the same way think about\nit when you're attracted to someone\naren't you willing to put in the effort\nto strengthen your connection with them\nso why wouldn't they do the same if they\nfeel the same way as South University\nexplains according to licensed\npsychologist Dr Rachel needle specific\nchemical substances such as oxytocin\nthan ethylamine and dopamine have been\nfound to play a role in human\nexperiences and behaviors that are\nassociated with love\nthey make us alert excited and wanting\nto bond\nthe bottom line is if they don't seem\nalert excited and well wanting to really\nbond with you in particular they're\nprobably Not That Into You\none-sided\nso maybe your conversations can go on\nfor hours and even days through text\nthey seem like a great listener never\ncutting you off ready to hear you out\nexcept these listening skills are\nstarting to get suspiciously good they\nrarely add anything of their own to your\nconversations and it's now starting to\nfeel like it's you doing all the talking\nbut this doesn't make any sense you\nthink to yourself I've seen them\nspeaking for a long while with their\nfriends tell you what\nit's not you it's it's totally them\nAlpine explains time spent with loved\nones should re-energize and fulfill you\nmore often than not feeling lonely empty\nor even dissatisfied afterward can\nsuggest an unbalanced relationship if\nthey don't seem like they're having a\nparticularly special time with you but\nseem to be really engaged in\nconversations with someone else it's\ntime to stop chasing after this person\nwho may not be as interested as you\nhoped breadcrumbing\nif they do seem to be actively engaged\nand attentive when spending time with\nyou do their responses seem effortlessly\nresponsive like they're genuinely there\nfor you and with you or do they seem\ncalculated if they're still keeping in\ntouch but not as much as you hope they\nwould then they might even be\nbreadcrumbing you breadcrumbing is a\nrelatively new dating technique that\nCosmopolitan describes as when they send\nyou sporadic messages slide into your\nDMs here and there or throw you a like\non Instagram just frequently enough so\nyou don't lose interest but not too much\nso the relationship actually moves\nforward\nthis might be a card they pull when they\nhave their eyes on someone else but need\na backup in case their first love\ndoesn't really turn out as hoped\nthe New York time explains that this\ncould be used as a way of keeping a\ndating prospect on hold\nif they seem like they like you but\ndon't like you like you then they\nprobably don't really like you after all\nindifferent\nin addition to their behaviors our\nactions seeming forced it might be\nhelpful to reflect on this person's body\nlanguage during your interactions with\nthem body language researcher Albert\nmorabian who first broke down the\ncomponents of face-to-face conversation\nfound that 55 of human communication is\nnon-verbal 38 is vocal and a remarkably\nsmall seven percent is actually the\nwords we speak\nbody language can have an incredible\nimpact on how we convey and interpret\nmessages it's part of 90 of non-verbal\ncommunication\nif they seem to be verbally responding\nto what you're saying to them but still\nfeels like something is off then they're\nprobably not fully in the moment\naccording to International consultant\nspeaker host and best-selling author Ali\nCraig some observable body language\nindicators of questionable interactions\ncan include lack of eye contact pointing\nfeet away from you pointing their torso\naway from you and surprisingly enough\nholding eye contact for too long body\nlanguage expert and author Stephen Keel\nexplains this last indicator as a common\nsign of dislike sharing that excessive\neye contact can be a way to not have\nothers find out how a person truly feels\nabout them Jill says since we know\nlooking away will be interpreted as rude\npeople overcompensate by making too much\neye contact to ensure they aren't\nperceived as inhospitable if you don't\nfeel the same energy they seem to\ntypically have with that other person or\npeople they're probably not as\ninterested personal therapist\nit can be a cute thing to have someone\ncome to you for advice like oh they\nvalue what I think about something but\nthis turns from cute to concerning when\nthat seems to be all they come to you\nfor if every interaction you have with\nthis person you're crushing on seems to\nfeel like a counseling session to help\nthem manage their personal life problems\nespecially when you're not as involved\nor welcome in their personal lives and\nthey're just hanging on because they\nneed someone as a resource for venting\nand solution seeking\nif this is especially about the\nrelations with others then that's a huge\nhint that their priorities are\ncompletely different as Healthline\nexplains without equality and mutual\nrespect relationships can easily become\nunbalanced and insecure a healthy\nrelationship requires active\nparticipation and equal efforts from\nboth sides to reciprocate how much you\ncare for each other\nif you're starting to feel like you're\ndoing all the caring then it's not worth\npursuing someone who's not doing the\nsame for you always preoccupied a huge\nsign that someone is not interested in\nyou but is in love with someone else is\nwhen they seem to constantly have\nsomething or someone else on their mind\nyou're always the one initiating\nconversations reaching out to them feels\nmore like a chore and their texts start\nfeeling more like stale replies rather\nthan ways to actively engage with you\nwhen you do get a hold of them there\nseems to be a barrier between the two of\nyou which may feel like unspoken\nboundaries they have to put up to keep\nyou at a distance\nit's normal and important to have\nboundaries but it's more important for\nsomeone to communicate their concerns or\nfeelings within a relationship so both\nparties know how to move forward if your\ncrush still spends time with you but\nisn't putting in the same energy as you\nare or seems to be impartial with you\nbut significantly more energetic with\nsomeone else and they probably don't\nhave intentions of taking this Beyond\njust casual interactions whether this is\njust a casual crush or someone you wish\nyou could connect with on a deeper level\nknow that you deserve the best when it\ncomes to being loved and cared for it's\nnot you that's the problem because it\ntakes two getting into a relationship\ntakes a lot of time and effort and it's\nonly reasonable to set your expectations\nHigh when pursuing someone to experience\nlife with no matter what stage you're at\nand finding that special someone and\njust as a reminder everyone is unique\nand beautiful in their own way and gets\nto choose whether they want to pursue\nromantic love or enjoy their own company\nwe hope you found this video helpful and\nif you have suggestions for any other\nmental health topics you would like for\nus to cover comment down below thank you\nso much for watching and remember you\nmatter"
