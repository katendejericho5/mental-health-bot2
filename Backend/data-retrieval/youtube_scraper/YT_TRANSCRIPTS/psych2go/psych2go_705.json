    "transcript": "psychologist Carl Jung said the most\ndangerous psychological mistake is the\nprojection of the Shadow onto others\nthis is the root of almost all conflicts\naccording to sex Central projection\nhappens when someone places their own\nbeliefs or emotions onto someone else\nit often happens unconsciously and\nsometimes people project their own\ninsecurities onto others\nwhen someone projects you might\ninternalize their hurtful comments and\nbelieve them to be true but if you can\neasily recognize when someone is\nprojecting it can help you become more\nresilient and take their negative\ncomments less personally let's talk\nabout three signs someone is projecting\ntheir insecurities onto you let's go\nrepression Zion has had a huge impact in\nrevealing the significant role\nrepression plays in projection in 1997\nLeonard Newman and colleagues conducted\na study where they ask people which\nnegative traits they found most\nthreatening then observed how\nparticipants reacted to these traits in\nthemselves and others they found that\npeople who repressed their emotions were\nmore likely to deny having the\nthreatening trait themselves but they\nwere quick to say someone else at the\ntrait repressors also avoided talking\nabout the traits they found most\nthreatening interesting so how can you\ntell whether someone is raising a\nlegitimate concern or projecting a\nrepressed and security onto you the next\ntime you think someone might be\nprojecting ask yourself do they have\nthis trait themselves and try hard to\ndeny or repress it have they talked\nabout how much they hate this trait\nbefore or have a strong reaction to it\nif you answered yes this might be a\nprojection rather than a legitimate\nconcern reaction have you ever had a\ncrush on someone and didn't want anyone\nto know if anyone ever asked you if you\nhad a crush on the person what do you do\ndo you overreact do you pretend this\nperson is so annoying and disgusting\nthat you couldn't possibly like them\naction kind of works the same way\naccording to National Certified\ncounselor Tanya Peterson overreaction is\na major sign of protection if someone is\nprojecting their insecurities onto you\nyou might notice that they get extremely\nangry or upset with you even when\nthere's no conflict and you don't\nunderstand why\nlike all psychological defense\nmechanisms projection is a response to\nuncomfortable emotions these feelings\ncan cause someone to blow up at\nsomething that might seem minor to you\nsomeone has an emotional reaction that\nis disproportionate to the situation\nthey may be projecting this insecurity\nonto you it may also be a good idea to\nremove yourself from the situation too\nthe blame game imagine your partner\naccuses you of cheating even though they\nhave no evidence\nand you've never even thought of being\nunfaithful to them why would they do\nthis\nPsychology today states that this is a\ncommon example of projection in romantic\nrelationships we might fall asleep blame\nour partner for cheating when we have\nthe desire to cheat ourselves according\nto my therapist people often project\nblame onto others in order to feel\nbetter about their own problems\nhave you ever been in a situation where\nsomeone starts blaming you out of\nnowhere for something that you didn't do\nthis could be a sign that they're\nprojecting an insecurity onto you when\nyou realize that someone is projecting\nyou recognize that what they're saying\nhas nothing to do with you and\neverything to do with them knowing this\ncan help these outbursts staying a bit\nless and help you navigate this type of\ninteraction now we want to hear from you\npsychic hours has anyone ever projected\nonto you be honest have you projected on\nto someone else before we hope that\nafter watching this video you'll be able\nto identify the signs that someone is\nprojecting their insecurities onto you\nshare your thoughts and experiences in\nthe comments below and don't forget to\nlike And subscribe until next time\nforeign"
