person\nthis can be the first step towards\ntaking care of your own safety and\nmental and physical health\nlet's break down the most common signs\nof a manipulator\nbefore we get started please keep in\nmind that this video serves as general\nguidance purely for educational purposes\nand is not to be taken as a substitute\nfor professional advice or assistance\nnumber one\nthey are too much too soon emotional\nmanipulators are skilled Liars who have\nan ultimate goal in mind at all times\nthis usually involves gaining some sort\nof power they'll do whatever it takes to\nachieve this starting by skipping the\nimportant steps of a strong Foundation\nof a relationship whether it's a\nrelationship or at home emotional\nmanipulators seem to rush to get to The\nSweet Spot of shared vulnerability have\nyou ever heard of the term love bombing\nthis is when an abuser establishes a\nfalse sense of intimacy through\noverwhelming signs of adoration and\nmaking you perceive them to be\nemotionally open and sensitive Dr\nSuzanne deck is white licensed counselor\nand professor at Northern Illinois\nUniversity explains that when the\nnarcissist uses this strategy they do so\nto capture their prey before the prey\ngets too wise to the game their\nnarcissistic Tendencies cause them to\nmirror your desires well allowing them\nto create a Persona of who they want you\nto believe they are except it's all an\nillusion they overshare too much too\nsoon an act to portray sensitivity all\nwhile playing a ruse of making you feel\nspecial this makes the victim feel as\nthough they've made it into the\nexclusive Inner Circle of the\nmanipulator gaining their concern and\nsympathy while making it so that the\nvictim is now responsible for their\nfeelings\nnumber two they pretend to be concerned\nyou are stuck in a rut and need some\nsupport and reassurance your manipulator\nwill initially display a sense of\neagerness to take action and help but\nthis energy will soon turn into\nreluctance and indifference towards your\nsituation when a victim needs help in\nany situation an emotional manipulator\nwill find a way to make it about them\nhelping the victim in any way will go\nnothing short of their toxic urge to\nremind them that they are a burden\nemotional manipulators can pretend to be\nconcerned about their victim only when\nit's convenient to them and that's as\nfar as they'll go to show care for\nanyone number three they refuse to help\nresolve problems emotional manipulators\ntend to create a reason to have an\nargument and often feed off unresolved\ntension as it serves their power in\nthese situations the manipulator takes\nadvantage of the victim's emotional\nattachment to them by putting the blame\non them according to Anita chopala a\nlicensed marriage and family therapist\nin a healthy relationship both Partners\nwill listen to each other and be willing\nto compromise a manipulator will have a\nmy way or the highway attitude about it\nemotional manipulators claim the role of\nthe victim nothing is ever their fault\nno matter what they do or don't do for\nthat matter if they get upset it's on\nyou for upsetting them and if you get\nupset that's also on you for having\nunreasonable expectations from them in\nhealthy relationships the two partners\nwill always share core values around\nsome form of respect and empathy that\nthey'll uphold even during tough times\nthey continue to look out for each other\nno matter the height of the obstacles\nthat test them an abusive relationship\nhowever the abuser removes themselves\nfrom the situation and avoids addressing\nthe victim's concern in any way they\nview conflict as you versus me rather\nthan us versus the problem thus in a\ntoxic situation the victim is cornered\ninto giving up their side to avoid\ndealing with a person who refuses to\nlisten to them Number Four The Gaslight\nyou emotional manipulators are\nunsettingly good at bending reality to\nmake themselves appear to be the victim\nin any given situation gaslighting is a\nform of emotional abuse which can be\nchallenging to identify at first and has\nlong lasting effects on a victim's trust\nand self-esteem according to psychology\ntoday by manipulating the victim to\ndoubt his or her own sense of reality\ncontinually saying things like that's\nnot how it happened or you're crazy the\ngaslighter asserts control over the\nrelationship leading the victim to rely\non the perpetrator for a sense of\nreality gaslighting gives the\nmanipulator a free pass to dismiss their\ntoxic behaviors and refuses to\nacknowledge their wrongdoings the tactic\nserves as a way for them to turn the\nissue onto you and distract you as you\nthen become consumed with feeling at\nfault for the problem at hand\ngaslighting can instill self-doubt\nanxiety and confusion and can cause a\nperson to develop serious mental health\nconditions such as depression the victim\nfalls into the Trap and the gaslighter\nmoves on with no remorse number five\nthey isolate you from others emotional\nmanipulators can restrict you from\ncontacting and meeting with friends and\nfamily to socially isolate you a study\npublished in the National Library of\nMedicine under the national Center for\nbiotechnology information explains\nisolation aims to undermine the victim's\nlife and identity outside the\nrelationship and Foster a sense of\ndependency this can look like them\nstopping you from hanging out with your\nfriends going home to see your family or\nhanging out with anyone

Social\nCircle and support emotional\nmanipulators gain control over your\ncontacts and connections so they can\nultimately gain more control over you\nthe more severe the isolation the more\nsevere the abuse alternatively victims\ncan be influenced into self-isolation\ndue to the fear of retaliation coercion\nfrom the manipulator or an attempt to\nstop the abuse altogether number six\nthey know your weaknesses and can use\nthem against you emotional manipulators\nare highly aware of their victims\nweaknesses and are always on the lookout\nto use them against them this abusive\ntendency stems

professor and\nauthor of communication success with\nfour personality types and how to\ncommunicate effectively and handle\ndifficult people Preston Nye explains\nsome manipulators liked and made\ncritical remarks often disguised as\nhumor or sarcasm to make you seem\ninferior and less secure by making you\nlook bad and making you feel bad the\naggressor hopes to impose psychological\nsuperiority over you for instance they\nmay notice that you are struggling with\na pressing insecurity so they might use\nthis against you by pointing it out or\ndrawing attention to

wrongdoings\npersonal flaws and even skillfully\ninfluence you to feel a sense of\nobligation towards them for anything\nthey might have done for you in the past\nthis helps them gain more control of the\nvictim by exaggerating your guilty\nconscience and causing you to feel\nresponsible to put aside your needs and\nfavor their preferences instead\nemotional manipulators use guilt as a\ntool to wield their victims actions and\nmotivate them to disregard their\npersonal desires so they can stay\ndominant their game runs on making you\nfeel dependent on them so they can\nsustain their control
