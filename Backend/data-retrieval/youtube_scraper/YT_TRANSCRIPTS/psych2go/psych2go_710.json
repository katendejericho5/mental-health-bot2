    "transcript": "love and romance are usually explained\nthrough the words of poets and musicians\nbut that hasn't stopped psychologists\nand neurobiologists from offering their\nown scientific and clinical takes on the\nsubject of passion so what is passion\nlove can be passionate but so can sexual\ndesires\nso how do we tell the difference\nwe're here to take a look at what the\nexperts have to say about love and sex\nso you can decide if what you're feeling\nis really love or intense sexual\nchemistry\nsex and attachment\nwe express and feel love in a lot of\nways we have Love Languages and\nattachment styles that tie into our\npsychology and make us who we are\nhow we express our sexual desires is no\ndifferent\nthey also relate to our attachment\nStyles and can tell us a lot about how\nwe really feel about our partner\nrelationship expert Dr Emily imped\nconducted a study that explored the\nrelationship between attachment and\nsexual expression these attraction\nStyles relate to sex specifically and\nmay not be your overall attachment Style\nwhen she and her colleagues found was\nthat an anxious attachment style to sex\nLED people to want to please their\nPartners sex for people with anxious\nattachment was about expressing love in\nother words it had a purpose Beyond lust\nand didn't replace other aspects of love\nand romance in the relationship people\nwith avoidant attachment style were more\nlikely to Simply use sex to avoid\nconflict their relationships heavily\ndepended on sex to survive in other\nwords the relationship was built on\nsexual chemistry and not love\nif you feel like you and your partner\nare only ever having sex and not doing\nmuch else\nthat can be great you may both have a\nhigh libido and suit each other in that\nway while this can also say a lot about\nyour or your partner's desires what are\nyour goals when you have sex\nare you and your partner\ncaring about each other's needs\nwhen you have sex you take\nresponsibility for someone else's safety\ncomfort and pleasure in another piece of\nresearch by Dr Emily impet and her\ncolleagues published in current Sexual\nHealth reports they discuss what it\nimplies when the needs of your partner\nare a priority when we prioritize our\npartners it cultivates desire our desire\nfor them and their desire for us grows\nit can come from genuine care and\nappreciation\nyou may want to provide the best\nexperience possible because you know\nthat you want to be with this person for\na long time\nhaving great sex encourages that long\nlasting Bond\nbut once again if it seems like the\nentire reason the relationship exists is\nfor sex that could be contradictory to\nthis goal ask yourself if the goal of\nsex for both of you and your partner is\nto express love to please one another\nor if the goal is something more\ntemporary and one-sided\njust because the sex is good doesn't\nmean there is a real connection you can\nhave bad sex but still be cared for and\nappreciated in a genuinely loving way it\nall depends on what you actually want\nout of it\nis there literally romantic chemistry\nobviously this isn't something you can\ncheck for yourself on a chemical level\nbut you can become aware of your own\nthoughts how often do you find yourself\nfor example mesmerized by the symmetry\nof their face wanting to make them laugh\nor genuinely wanting their opinion\ncompare that to how often you feel a\nsexual urge around them\nare you able to be in their presence and\nnot think about sex\nit's easy to get these feelings confused\nas neurobiologist Samir Zeki writes in\nthe neurobiology of Love published in\nfeb's letters\nrelease of dopamine puts one in a\nfeel-good state and dopamine seems to be\nintimately linked not only to the\nformation of relationships but also to\nsex which consequently comes to be\nregarded as a rewarding and feel-good\nexercise this is why it's important to\nidentify your own desires if you're\nhonest with yourself do you feel an urge\nto express romantic love with your\npartner without the end goal being sex\ndo you want romance and love with this\nperson for the sake of it and when you\ndo have sex do you feel the same after\nsex\nmaybe you think your goal really is a\nromantic connection and sex just happens\nto be a product of that that's true for\na lot of people but if you're still\nquestioning your or your partner's\ndesires ask yourself what it's like\nafter sex\ndo you still want their company even if\nthere won't be more sex\nis there still desire after sex\ndesire for love and affection\nor do you feel like you want to be by\nyourself\nif you find yourself switching off after\nsex in other words you don't really feel\nlike talking or hanging out after sex\nthat could be the result of only having\nsexual chemistry and not real love as Dr\nSamir Zaki continues sexual arousal and\norgasms deactivate a region in the\nfrontal cortex that overlaps the\ndeactivated region observed in romantic\nlove\nfor a brief period when aroused sex does\nbecome the focus\nbut if you're in love those romantic\nfeelings should come back after sex\nsexual chemistry cannot and should not\nreplace love permanently\nhold on to love if you have it if you\ndon't have love but you do have sexual\nchemistry make that known to your\npartner or friend with benefits as long\nas it's safe and healthy and you both\nbenefit from it enjoy it while you can\nbut don't be afraid to pursue real love\nwhen you do find it\nvideo taught you something new or gave\nyou some perspective let us know in the\ncomments and don't forget to leave a\nlike if you want to continue to learn\nmore about psychology subscribe to\npsych2go for more videos like this\nthanks so much for watching until next\ntime"
