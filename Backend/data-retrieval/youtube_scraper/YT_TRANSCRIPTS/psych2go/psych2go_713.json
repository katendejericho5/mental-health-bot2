refers to the\nrealization of one's potential\nwhich is the process of self-fulfillment\nPeak experiences and life appreciation\nMaslow puts these into a pyramid-shaped\ndiagram detailing each step to achieving\nthis while we will be looking at some\naspects of this theory in this video\nwe'll also be gathering expert opinions\non personal growth as a whole\nyou're looking ahead\nlife is unpredictable at times messy and\nit can be hard to think further ahead\nthan dinner time when you're in a\nsituation that's unstable and needs your\nconstant attention with an endless list\nof to-do's and loose ends you may feel\nlost however finding yourself feeling\nthat the future is not full of worries\nand Treads can be a sign of personal\ngrowth that you're now in a place

your history fit\ntogether today\nthis doesn't mean that you haven't\nstruggled or minimized the bad but you\ncan now accept what has happened\nfurthermore self-acceptance is one of\nthe points in Maslow's pyramid of\nself-actualization Mind Body green\nexplains this point as the ability to\naccept your quirks and desires without\nneeding to apologize for them\nmore emotionally intelligent\nhow
