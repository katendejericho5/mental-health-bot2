    "transcript": "what makes you attracted to someone you\nmay have a list of traits or features\nyou commonly find attractive in others\nbut there's another list of weird things\nthat may subconsciously attract you to\nothers as well you're likely unaware of\nthese bizarre situations or features\nthat attract others things you may not\neven realize like how can being nervous\npossibly benefit you on a date\ndoesn't matter which ear you speak into\nwhen first talking to someone and how\ndoes watching a movie about a terrifying\nclown increase your chances of a second\ndate\nwe're about to explain why here are five\nweird things that can increase\nattraction\nyou know eat your green vegetables\neating more fruits and veggies may just\nincrease your chances in the dating\nworld like Spider-Man always says work\nout get plenty of rest you know eat your\ngreen vegetables according to a 2017\nstudy published an evolution and human\nbehavior Peter Parker may be right the\nstudy found that female study\nparticipants were less attracted to the\nodors of male participants who ate\nrefined carbs they were instead more\nattracted to the participants who had\nmore fruits and vegetables in their diet\nthe study notes that the greater fruit\nand vegetable intake was significantly\nassociated with more pleasant smelling\nsweat with more floral fruity sweet and\nmedicinal qualities independent of sweat\nintensity who knew Spider-Man's pits\ncould smell so sweet the propinquity\neffect\nsimply being near someone repeatedly\nover an extended period of time May\nbuild your attraction to them and or\nform a strong relationship with them\nthis is called the propinquity effect in\nPsychology according to the American\nPsychological Association it's the\ntendency of individuals to form close\nrelationships with people they\nrepeatedly encounter that is the more\noften one comes into contact with\nanother person the more likely it is\nthat one will form a friendship or\nromantic relationship with that person\nso simply going on your routine walk in\nthat crowded Park and noticing the same\nfamiliar faces soon may have you finding\nsome of those faces attractive or\ngenerally feeling closer to them or\nseeing that same pizza delivery guy\nevery week may just have you craving\nMore Than Just Pizza\npsychologist Nick Hopson explained to\nbustle that our brains like that sense\nof familiarity adding that we then take\nthat feeling of the familiar and\nconvince ourselves that the pleasantness\nit induces within us is because of the\nattraction itself so attraction or\nfamiliarity\nPizza Time\nmisattribution of emotions\nah your first movie date romantic comedy\nor horror movie well I love Sleepless in\nSeattle uh I'm gonna stop you right\nthere who doesn't love Tom Hanks and Meg\nRyan but a classic romantic comedy may\nnot be the way to go this time in a\nfamous 1973 study on the psychology of\nAttraction psychologists Donald Dutton\nand Arthur ehring had an attractive\nfemale experimenter ask male subjects\nbetween the ages of 18 to 35 a series of\nquestions\nin order for the male test subjects to\nget to the female experimenter they had\nto cross a bridge\nhalf of the men had to cross a high\nrickety Bridge while the other half\ncrossed a stable and low bridge the\nexperimenter then showed each subject in\nambiguous image and asked them to tell a\nstory about what could be taking place\nin that picture at the end of the\nquestionnaire the woman then gave each\nman her phone number and said they could\ncall her if they had any questions about\nthe study\nwhen looking at the results the men who\ncrossed the unstable adrenaline-inducing\nBridge wrote stories on their\nquestionnaire that included more sexual\ncontent and imagery than those on the\nlow bridge\nand only two out of the 16 subjects went\nover the low stable Bridge called the\nfemale experimenter back while half of\nthose who crossed the High scary Bridge\ncalled the woman after the experiment\nwas finished researchers Dutton and\nAaron theorized that the scary bridge\ncreated feelings of arousal in subjects\nsubjects misattributed this arousal as\nfeelings for the attractive female\nexperimenter this is known as\nmisattribution of emotions so if someone\ngoes on an exciting adrenaline-inducing\ndate they may mistake these feelings of\narousal as feelings for you the same\nthing can happen if you're watching a\nscary film or horror movie A lot of\npeople love watching horror films due to\nthat intense energy the movie elicits\nfrom them psychologist Nick Hobson\nfurther explained to bustle that putting\nsomeone in a high energized emotional\nstate may make them more attracted to\nwho they're with than if they met them\nduring a calm setting opposite notes\nthat we incorrectly believe that the\nexcitability we're experiencing is\nbecause of the energy in the interaction\nwith a potential partner a night in\nwatching the horror film it with pizza\ndelivered sounds like a day to me who\nknew Pennywise the Clown could make you\nfeel such a way\nthe right ear or the left ear people may\njust like what you have to say if they\nhear it first in a certain side of your\near at least according to a 2009 study\nfrom researchers in Italy researchers\nDanielle marzoli and Luca tomasi had a\nwoman request a smoke from a total of\n176 people at a club the people she\nspoke to male or female were twice as\nlikely to give her a cigarette if she\ndirected her question towards their\nright ear\nthe study states that in their last\nstudy subjects showed a greater\nproneness to meet an experimenter's\nrequest when it was directly addressed\nto the right rather than the left ear\nmany believe this is due to language\nprocessing taking place primarily in the\nbrain's left hemisphere and the left\nside of the brain receives its auditory\ninput from the right ear it seems it's\njust the right side to doctor right am I\nright\nnervousness For Better or For Worse\na 2020 study published in the journal\nadaptive human behavior and Physiology\nfound that yes people are often nervous\naround someone they like the study\nstates that participants reported that\nthey did indeed experience a cluster of\nanxiety-related physiological and\nbehavioral reactions during an initial\nencounter with someone they found highly\nattractive but what if it's not such a\nbad thing after all the study explains\nthat nervous responses benefit in\nfinding someone that reciprocates those\nfeelings of Attraction Behavioral\nAnalyst Dr Wendy L Patrick PhD explains\nin an article for psychology today that\nthis point in the study might be\nparticularly true given that nervous\nreactions include positive affect such\nas smiling and laughing Patrick goes on\nto explain that the studies researchers\npoint out that although we might think\nthat nervous reactions could create an\nimpression of being awkward clumsy or\nuncomfortable such responses could be\nevidence of romantic interest and\nTrigger reciprocity makes sense doesn't\nit wouldn't you you want to know if\nsomeone was just as nervous as you were\nbecause they liked you back\nthat may just make things easier when\nyou ask them out on a date next\nPizza Time\nwere you surprised to learn how these\nthings increase attraction which one\nsurprised you the most let us know in\nthe comments down below are you now\nmotivated to ask someone you like out\nwhen in doubt take a piece of good old\nadvice and veggie pizza and ask them out\nto watch a movie it chapter two or maybe\ngood old Spider-Man oh and remember to\nask them in their right ear first\nwe hope you enjoyed this video and
