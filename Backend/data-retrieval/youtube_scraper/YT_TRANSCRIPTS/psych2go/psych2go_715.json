all amazing so yeah let's let's\nhave a great conversation I'm so excited\nof course so to those who have just\njoined you can let us know where you're\ntuning in from what perhaps to start the\nconversation what gives you meaning\nbecause we'll be really delving into all\nthose kind of Wellness topics around\nmeeting around resilience today\nand while people do that I'd love to\njust kind of dive in to ask whether\nyou'd like to share more about your\nstory to the psych2go community\nyeah\num first of all sorry I was getting a\nlittle distracted by all the people\njoining from all over the world wow you\nguys are joining from like Australia\nAlabama Michigan so cool\num and the question was what I enjoy\nabout the sec2o community yeah what yeah\njust tell us a little bit more about\nyour story\num your involvement with the Mental\nHealth Community your advocacy work\nyeah yeah\nso\num where should I start you know first\nof all I think it's worth mentioning\nbecause I think we do have a global\nCommunity here I moved to the states\num when I was 11 years old from South\nKorea so I you know kind of started that\nimmigrant life with my family first\ngeneration Korean\num and you know moving to the states\nthere were a lot of challenges that I\nthink immigrated immigrated families go\nthrough and\num yeah a lot of it affected my family\nin different ways so I know we talked\nabout this a little bit before our chat\nbut really one of my things is that one\nof my really close family members\num you know fell into depression and\nalmost took her life and\num and I was very young I was about 17\nyears old\nand ever since then thankfully she's\nstill alive today\num but ever since then I really started\nquestioning like why do people do what\nthey do what makes people so happy what\nmakes people so unhappy what leads them\nto live a life where you know they get\nto continue to want to live and all that\nkind of stuff at a very young age\nso I got really interested in Psychology\nlike all of us here and um yeah one of\nmy degrees was in Psychology I loved\npsychology so much I wanted to just\nunderstand humans and why people do what\nthey do\num and I actually just went on my\njourney of being in the corporate world\nfor 10 years and there's nothing wrong\nwith being in the corporate world by the\nway\num\nbut I think for me for whatever reason\nit didn't feel aligned because I just\nnever knew that I had other choices\nand I'll come back to that in just a\nlittle bit but\num in 10 years uh that I was there I\nstarted to feel unfulfilled and just\nkind of burnt out\num I definitely overachieved\num not really dealing with some of the\nthings I've gone through in my life in\nthe beginning of my Those Years anyway\nlong story short\num and 2015 is when I really was hit\nwith this fact that life is short\npeople's you know lives expire and one\nof the ways I found out was uh my dad\num was diagnosed with cancer and two and\na half years later\nof just horrible cancer battling he\nended up\num yeah he ended up passing away and not\nonly did that really shock like me in\nthe sense that wow like this is life\ndoes end\num and we know that logically but I\nthink that was the first time that I\nreally connected to that fact\nin my heart and my body\num and after he passed away I just\nreally decided to go after my dream and\none of my passions has always been\nlearning about humans helping humans\nhelping people find what makes them\nhappy helping people find what they're\nreally excited about and I really\ndecided to dedicate my life to it\nbecause guess what like\neveryone's life ends and we have only\none chance to really live out our lives\nlive out our dreams so um I quit my job\nat the time and\num I started this journey of building my\ncoaching business really Desiring to\nhelp people and\num really making a stand for what I'm\npassionate about which is mental health\nadvocacy eliminating stigma around that\nas well as really helping people see\nthat we can live in infinite realm of\npossibilities\nso yeah\num and I I'm getting delightfully\ndistracted by these chats\num and one of the things that we'll talk\nabout I'm sure is I definitely have ADHD\nso if I get a little distracted you know\nwhy I I you know I've learned to embrace\nit but I'm really like oh like it's so\nnice to be able to connect with all of\nyou guys from all over the world and I'm\ntrying to stay focused so here I am\nwell first they have to say is thank you\nso much for opening up to us you know\nbeing vulnerable sharing the really the\njourney that you have you've gone\nthrough it's a lot I'm really sorry to\nhear about your dad to hear about your\nfamily member\num you know I feel for you and I also\nfeel that you're so so resilient just\ngetting to\nyou know take that experience and here\nyou are coaching here you are writing a\nbook here you are share your experiences\nhoping to inspire others I think that's\nsomething that is just truly amazing so\nthank you so much for sharing all of\nthat yeah it actually want us to hear a\ncool story so today of all it's right\nbefore this one of my friends from\nseventh grade posted on like Facebook\nhe's like oh I just got Yuri's book so\nexcited to read it or whatever\nthis is my book by the way and um it was\nactually extra special because he was my\nfirst friend when I moved to the states\nwhen I didn't speak any English and I\nwill never forget how like he'll just\nnever know how much that meant because\nyou know here I was this ESL student\nsomebody who didn't speak English and he\ntook me on as a friend without you know\neven though we couldn't really\ncommunicate and a lot of people you know\nback then kids can be mean\num they totally made fun of me and you\nknow there's like some indirect and\ndirect pulling back then because I\ndidn't speak English but there's people\nwho just took me on as exactly as I am\nand you know many many years later now\nI'm able to like give him my book and\nsay like look at this book I wrote in\nEnglish you know we started off when we\ncouldn't even talk to each other so\nit's um it was really special\num so yeah I think I've found a way\num to really turn these difficulties in\nmy life\num and reframe it and continue to make\nit into my own fairy tale my own story\nI'm like for me these moments I really\ncherish because it it makes everything I\nwent through when I was in seventh grade\nworth it like these moments and I also\nknow that when I'm going through a\ndifficult time now I know that there's a\nyou know future self that hasn't\nhappened yet that's already thanking me\nfor going through this because it's\ngoing to give meaning in that moment\neven more\nso yeah\nwould you like to walk us a bit through\nwalk us through how the process was you\nknow really\nbeing developing resilience because I\nthink that this is a bit philosophical\nbut I don't think anything is in like\nanything is just innate like we're not\nborn with resilience we're not born with\nperseverance so how is that something\nthat you really\nyou know it took to the next level\nthrough your book through your speaking\nengagements and so on\nI agree that's philosophical and I want\nto offer a slightly different\nperspective maybe we are born resilient\nwe learn fears along the way which is\ngood because\nyou know that protects us in a certain\nway\nbut\num\nand I want to actually start off by\ntalking about what fear means so that it\ncan talk about how I was able to channel\ndifferent emotions like anger to really\nhelp me push forward\num you know so fear is a really I love\ntalking about this you know fear is like\nan actually very\nuh common as well as healthy emotion and\nsensation in our body\nbecause back in the day when you know\nthere were Tigers chasing us we need a\nfear so that we can like hyper Focus all\nof our attention all of our resources\nand go after what it is so like we need\nto do which is survive\nand over the years over the thousands of\nyears we've now created this you know\num system where we can activate that\nsystem without having to you know\nwithout being chased by a tiger\nbasically so then we have all these\nfears about what it means when we fail\nwe have all these you know stories about\nwhat it means when we are faced with\nchallenges when we feel like you know we\ndon't know what to do because we're\nscared that we're going to make the\nwrong choice and it really comes back\ndown to that fear response of fight\nflight or fawn\nor freeze right\nso with that said knowing that I think\nwhen we know that these fear anger\nfear-based emotions are actually coming\nfrom a place where it's actually a\nsocially\nconditioned response\nwe can also reframe the social context\nof what that means and make it into\nsomething that we can Leverage\num and as far as for me when I was\nyounger and so the reason I give that\nbackground is because I want to explain\nhow I Channel motivation Now versus how\nI used to back then both are really\npowerful but just a little bit different\nenergy so when I was you know 12 11\nyears old I was I was not happy I was\nangry that you know I came from the I\ncame from Korea where I used to be like\nyou know very social had a lot of\nfriends and then I'm dropped off in this\ncountry where I don't speak any of the\nlanguage I'm culturally inept and I just\ndon't fit in\nso then\num and then all of a sudden people\nthought I was in quotes like stupid and\nall these things just because I didn't\nspeak the language\nso it angered me I was you know so what\nI wanted was to prove them wrong\nI took massive inspired action\num because of that anger and this is\nsomething that I talk about with my\nclients often this energy of anger it's\nactually really powerful when people are\nangry people do amazing things\nI mean sometimes scary things depends on\nhow you channel that energy right but\npeople can do really drastic bold things\num so for me what I did was I'm like I\ndon't want to be this person who doesn't\nspeak English who is bullied anymore I'm\ngoing to learn English I'm gonna speak\nit better than that much\nso it came from that like spiteful place\num channeled that anger I read 30 books\nin 30 days in the language I didn't know\nwhich was English at the time and within\njust a few months I was out of the\nEnglish second language class\nI was in a normal English class I\nremember going back after the summer to\nthe teacher being like hey like I'm\nready to move out of the English class\nand\num the teacher is like oh Nobody Does\nthat I'm like I'm ready like give me a\ntest or something like I'm ready\nso I took the test and I tested out and\nit was it was um a moment I realized\nlike when I take inspired Massive Action\nlike anything is possible if you can\nlearn English in just two months like\nwhat else is possible so at a young age\nI learned that now I explained that\nthough\nbecause when we take Massive Action\nalthough the outcome is always good\nright like in a good way if we do it in\na good way however it can have\nconsequences when it's coming from that\nTrump traumatized or scared or uh\nspiteful place\nso\num you know back then all I was doing\nwas proving them wrong like who the heck\nis they anyway right so for me it was\nalways coming from this place of\ncomparison and competition back then\num\nand I realized I wasn't healthy because\nall I can do\nis come back to neutral but I wasn't\nfeeling more confident I wasn't feeling\nmore worthy just because I was\nconstantly you know trying to just prove\nthem wrong\nso I explained that because now\num when I talk about resilience because\nI'm moving towards a goal and a vision\nwhich is completely different energy you\nknow I get excited and I keep moving\nforward with this mission to you know\ncreate infinite possibilities for people\nfor and for myself and to be the example\nof that and to help people understand\ntheir emotions and to create their own\nhappiness because what I get excited\nabout is this like world I can see where\nmore people are connected where more\npeople are actually happy so they're\nhelping each other and just more Harmony\nin the world more love in the world and\nthat Vision like pulls me forward now\nand I think in that way it also helps me\novercome challenges and be resilient but\nthere's like two different ways to\nachieve that so I hope that answers your\nquestion\nyeah definitely I see the it's like the\nthe way that you appraise the situation\ndrastically changed it's as if\nkind of the the saying like you see the\nglass half full and so then you come\nfrom a place that you do something for\nyourself rather than for you know\nproving other people wrong or you know\ndoing it because you feel some sort of\nnegative emotion that you want to\neradicate so it's not like you're doing\nsomething to get rid of something bad\nbut to bring in something good yes yes\nto yeah to I think there's two ways that\npeople take\num action one is because we're trying to\nmove away from Pain and the other is\nwe're trying to move towards something\nthat is more pleasurable or to\num create something that we are more\nconnected to\nso I'm just looking at some of these\ncomments here and I'm curious you guys\nlike um where are you guys coming from\nand what questions do you have from me\nas you do that I'm just going to quickly\nlighten the room a bit as you probably\ncan tell I'm I'm based in Montreal so\nit's getting pretty late even with the\ndaylight saving time so it's getting\npretty dark so hopefully yeah improve\nthe situation\nget a lot better but\nit's gonna let me know what you think\nfrom Mexico from Egypt from the US from\nCanada\nso cool\nand speaking about\nthe process of you know being resilient\nI think for most people it often\ninvolves things that people find give\nsome Joy so I'm quite curious you know\nin a time when things are difficult in\nthe time when things are sometimes sort\nof hopeless what did you find gave you\nJoy what were sources of inspiration for\nyou what did you look towards for that\nsource of Hope\nyeah I think um when I talk about\nfinding hope\num\num\ntwo situations come to mind I'll start\nwith one of them which was um\nso I I talked about this briefly\num one of my parents\num almost took her life and\num she there was a period in my life\nwhere she was in the hospital and I was\n17.\nso it was scary and I realized I had two\nchoices and I think this is when I start\nto realize like what I can do to start\nto create the life I want and manifest\nthings\num\nso I remember she was in the ER she was\nin the uh or IC or whatever for\nmy gosh it's like a big blur for me\nduring that time but I think a week or\ntwo or so\nand\nthat's when I had just gotten my license\nso I was driving I was 17 and I was\ngoing to high school and all that and\nI remember\nI mean obviously I was scared and\nheartbroken like my family just felt\nshattered and\nI remember I sat down with myself\nfor the first time because I felt like I\nwas like really alone in that anyway\nI didn't have anyone I can talk to about\nlike what just happened\nbut\nI had to make a choice\nand that choice was I can just be\ncompletely broken from this\nwhich I think at the time I mean my best\nfriends of my teachers that I did talk\nto\nthey're like you're you're allowed to be\nlike completely\nyou know they didn't use these words but\nshatter from this this is a hard thing\nbut I remember thinking I'm like no no\nno no like I want my mom\nto have something that she can't come\nback to when she's like out of her coma\nand\nbe grateful that she did like that's who\nI want to be and when I think about that\ntype of person\nthat's the person who\nit has applied to all the colleges who's\ngone into a bunch of schools who's gonna\ndo well who's going to be successful\nlike that is\nthe reality that my mom would want to\ncome back to and I don't know how else\nto communicate with her right now\nbecause she couldn't\nbut that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna\ncreate the reality that she'd be happy\nto come back to\nand you know I didn't call that\nmanifesting back then I didn't call that\nmindset back then I didn't call that\nresiliency back then it just made sense\nlike why would someone who just didn't\nwant to live want to live\nprobably a life that they can feel\nhopeful about\nso that gave me a source of inspiration\nthat gave me motivation so I remember\nduring that time\num you know uh\nbeing an immigrant I already had to do\nmost of this by myself anyway which is\nlike writing all the college essays and\nall that but like I really had to be\nresourceful\nI talked to all my teachers about\napplying to colleges I mean they told me\nthey're like here you don't even have to\ncome to school like take some time off\nif you need to I was like no no no like\nI'm gonna create\nthe future that my mom would be so happy\nthat she came back to\nso they helped me\num write my essays and I\num\nI\nactually wrote about the experience\nwhich even now when I think about it's\npretty bold as a 17 year old I'm like I\ncan't believe I wrote about that\nsituation my mom almost dying\nand really being vulnerable that way\nwhich\num I think got me into a lot of these\nschools and which got me um scholarships\nso by the time that she did become\nhealthy again\nyeah she was glad that she came back I\nwas on track to be continued to be\nsuccessful\nso I think in each of these moments when\nwe do overcome when we are faced with\nchallenges we have choices\nand I think it really just comes down to\nbeing able to kind of see past that\nchallenge because a lot of times and\nthis is what happens when we're stuck in\nthat survival mindset when we are stuck\nwith that fear which is we can't see\npast that we can't see past that fear we\ncan't see past that particular incidents\nor events so we think it's hopeless\nbut there's like a life after that\nchallenge right so then when we can\nsearch a channel like what would that\nlook like in the future or after post\nthat challenge and like really play out\nthe whole story it just makes sense to\ncontinue to\ntune in to a life that we truly want\nso I think you know it starts with\ngetting clear of what is it what would\nexcite you not just like dwelling on\nwhat is hurting me right now but like\nwhat do I really want like this is cool\nbecause I mean it's not cool per se but\nin the bigger picture it's like showing\nyou what you really don't want\nand then that could be an opportunity\nfor you to create what you really do\nwant\nyou know you can just look at the\nopposite of that\nso yeah\nI really hear the impactful role that\nyour mom played to really guide you\nthrough those those moments when you had\nto apply to college for the first time I\nknow as a first generation student as\nwell it is so difficult because you\ndon't know what to like where do you\neven begin you know like there's the\nSATs the act so this goes on oh my\ngoodness and if you're playing\ninternationally it's a whole different\nball game\nit's really difficult but just hearing\nhow you manage to to go past it to\nreally hold your mom's you know you hold\nyour mom close to your heart throughout\nall of it was just yeah very inspiring\nand another theme that I notice as well\nis really how I would say future\noriented you are because oftentimes like\nyou mentioned the lack of Hope comes\nfrom not being able to see that there's\nanything better than what you currently\nhave so it could it could it can and it\nis quite difficult to imagine a future\none I don't know one day\neverything will be normal everything\nwill be the way that you want it to so\nI don't know do you have any kind of\nspecific advice to people out there who\nare still struggling who are trying to\novercome a difficult moment who\npotentially don't see\na better future\nyeah yeah\num\nand here's the thing it's really hard to\nimagine the future though when we are in\nthat survival mindset\nbecause when we're running away from\nTigers we're not thinking about what\nshould I eat what kind of Life do I want\nto create what kind of business do I\nwant to create what kind of book do I\nwant to write\nwe're thinking about surviving\nso this is why I have such fun helping\nmy clients see the benefits of things\nlike meditation things like\num exercising which actually brings you\nback to a relaxed State literally\nphysically in your body so that you can\nmove away from the survival\nphysical state\nlike so when we are stressed out or when\nwe are burnt out or when we are stressed\nor scared or whatever\nwe're actually increasing the levels of\ncortisol in our body which is the same\nresponse that happens when we are you\nknow running away from tigers\nso in our body we think that we are in\ndanger like literal danger even if we're\nnot like even if our physical body is\nnot in danger we think that we are\nso what do we do this is why people\ncan't sleep this is why people can't\ndigest things when they're stressed\nbecause your body thinks that you're\nrunning away from something really\ndangerous and when you're running away\nthe only thing you're thinking about is\nsurviving in that mindset it feels\nreally hopeless because the only thing\nthat you can think about is surviving so\ntherefore you can't predict the future\nor you can't create the future\nso one of the things that you can do to\nstart is to calm down your nervous\nsystem whatever that takes for me it's\nexcuse me for me it's meditation for me\nit's journaling for me it's connecting\nfor me it's giving for me it's you know\nall of those things\nso it allows me to\nstart to connect to that\nyeah that's amazing I second the the\nnotion you said about mindfulness it is\nvery very powerful\num there have been tons of studies done\non how it can improve General well-being\nbut simply\nit's just great all around I love it I\npractice every morning as well every\nmorning every evening even brief\nmindfulness interventions were found to\nbe quite effective for producing\nGeneral like stress levels so\nthat's something that worked personally\nfor me as well\nyeah\num and I'm curious from the chat you\nguys like\nwhat um yeah what kind of challenges are\nyou moving through right now or have you\nmoved through in the past\nI would love to bring some intention to\nthis chat and talk about\nhow I can support you because that's why\nI'm here\nexactly yeah let's give a few moments to\ndo that because I know you give such\namazing advice\num so if people have anything specific\nthat they want to bring up then we can\nallocate some space for that\nI'm seeing um somebody said it's shrooms\num and I would actually talk about that\nbecause\nI'm not an advocate of any of these\nthings\num because I think it can be done like\nbut naturally but I will say this the\nreason things like shrooms has gone so\nmuch popularity over the years is\nbecause it does exactly what meditation\ndoes it does exactly what breathwork\ndoes which is you know it really\ninterrupts the current neural circuits\nso that you're able to create different\nways to think about things\nthere's no judgment about how you get\nthere however I prefer the more natural\nways which\num you know is free and available at all\ntimes which is you know different kinds\nof meditations\num breath work like this all does a very\ndo similar things so get anxiety from\nfeeling lonely when I think I'm ghosted\nor rejected okay\num anxiety from feeling lonely I think I\nam ghosted or rejected\nor rejected one thing that we're\nthinking about is that\nwe think that it's about us\nthere's like this underlying core belief\nabout what we are worth so when people\ndisappear and do their own things we\nthink this because we're not enough\noftentimes has nothing to do with you\nfor me right it has to everything to do\nwith what's going on in their own life\nwhat they're available for emotionally\nor not emotionally you we don't see it\nfrom their perspective we take it on\nfrom the perspective that already exists\nso if you're if your belief about who\nyou are is that you're not worthy\nof that connection or other connections\nthen it might the automatic thinking\nmight go to like oh I've been rejected\nbecause that person left me\num but in reality they're probably\nmoving through their own things that\nyou're not aware of that is being\nprojected in the dynamic that was\ncreated there so one thing that you can\nthink about is that most people are just\ndoing what's best for them that has\nnothing to do with us and I know in that\nmoment sometimes it's really hard to\nlike internalize and it's a constant\npractice you know just to like really\nlet that go and just say okay what could\nthis mean for them and what can I focus\non again it really comes back down to\nfocusing on what you want if that person\nyou know Concord rejected you and by the\nway I heard this quote once where\nrejection is God's protection from you\nknow what you really want so go back to\nwhat you really want do you want\nsomebody who rejects you and ghosts you\nif if not like\nthat's not your person you know focus on\nwhat you want probably somebody who\nloves you and accepts you\nyeah\nI just like to add I think that no\nmessage is the most powerful message\nthat you can get\nso by them not responding it's telling\nyou volumes right there it's telling you\nthat perhaps they have other priorities\nit's telling you that maybe they\nperhaps even had had time to respond yet\nbecause they're busy perhaps it's\ntelling you that they\nunfortunately\nprobably aren't great at communicating\nso you can take that for what it is and\nultimately you know that it's in your\nhands to want to respond or not\nyeah I love that\nhonestly I'm currently under a lot of\npressure\nand instead of spending time with my\nfamily I'm running around collecting\nlast few documents for moving abroad and\nmy flight is on Monday\none thing that really helped me in my\njourney and this broke my head when I\nlearned this because I'm like what do\nyou mean pressure is not real\nlike think about what pressure actually\nmeans\nyou know we run around saying like oh\nthat person is pressuring me or I\npressure from this like what is pressure\nreally\nit's it's what we decided is either\nimportant or not important we're the one\ngiving energy to that at the end of the\nday\nyou're a person with free will\nyou can choose to do whatever you want\nyou can say your job is giving you all\nthe pressure in the world but you chose\ninto that jaw\nso at the end of the day it's you you\ncreating that imagined idea of pressure\nit's because you care about it\nSo when you say you're under a lot of\npressure it's it's such a strong imagery\nlike what if you get to say I am above\nall the challenges I'm overcoming them a\nlot of times how we speak to ourselves\nand others really creates a reality\nactually 100 of time\nMonica tank saved my life\nsure\nI think you're the one here who's really\ngiving all those amazing insights so\nit's really you who are you who's doing\nyou know mobile Community a great\nservice you believe that I believe in\num\nI just want to share a comment that a\nperson\nsent in the chat that's quite related to\nwhat a person the whole scenario that we\nwere just discussing it's not to\nyou know invalidate whatever someone's\ngoing through it's very real but the\nsame time I want to flight them most of\nthe time for me at least I noticed that\nI catastrophized a lot so I suffer more\nin imagination than what is truly\nhappening so sometimes just taking a\nstep back and using accurate language so\ntelling myself objectively these are the\ndeadlines that I have to set these are\nthe deadlines I have to meet whatever\nand then really thinking about\nprioritizing and really understanding\nwhat actually needs to be done what\nactually doesn't need to be done and all\nthose extra emotions that I'm piling on\ntop of it like oh my gosh I'm not going\nto be able to do this all that kind of\nextra fluff it's not helping so that's\nmy thoughts on that and uh thank you to\nDuke of cooker's Lane for\nvery very relevant I love that we suffer\nmore in imagination than reality that's\nso true and\num I want to offer a practical way to\nreally uh reframe that\nso think about\nwhat is the thing that's stressing you\nout like what if you guys are stressing\nout right now think about that and then\njust like Monica said think about all\nthe stories you're creating around\nwhat's actually going on so there's like\nthe objective facts of what's going on\nokay uh Monica has a deadline on this\ndate Monica has a deadline in this state\nMonte Castle deadline this date she\nneeds to spend these many hours on those\ndeadlines those might be the facts but\nwhat are the stories that you might be\ncreating Monica is that\nokay then I'm not gonna get any sleep\nI'm gonna be so tired I'm gonna be so\nstressed out like you're creating all\nthese stories before it ever happens\nright and I'm not saying you I'm just\nusing you as an example\nit's very relatable for anyone as well\nso totally fine I do this too you know\nI'll be like oh I have to do this I have\nto do that and then I create all these\nstories about what that means about me\nwhat you can try on is what is another\nstory you can create like what are the\nfacts what's another story that you can\ncreate around these facts\nwhat if the story gets to be oh my gosh\nI have all these deadlines\nand Monica I know you're becoming a\ndoctor right doctor yeah yeah yeah\nexactly Med med student\nby the way I so look up to her um I was\nvery touched I used that you look up top\nme but you're you're going to be a\ndoctor saving literal lives\num so anyway with that said wow like I'm\na step closer to becoming a doctor like\nthat's what your deadline could mean if\nyou like zoom out\nor\num you know wow I wonder who I'm gonna\nbecome after I move through this\ndeadline even though it's challenging\nthat's something I thought about too\nwhen I was moving through this challenge\nwhen I was young\num you know really moving through that\ntime of like almost losing my mom and\nbeing like I wonder who how strong I'm\ngonna be after I go through this\nlike nothing's gonna scare me anymore\nlike if I can go get through this oh my\ngosh I'm gonna be unstoppable and that\ngave me a little bit of hope that I\nneeded at the time\num even when my dad was sick\num obviously\nyou know I think for me connections are\nreally important so it affects me a lot\nand uh when my dad was really sick he\nwas uh you know diagnosed with cancer\nand for any of you guys who've gone\nthrough that Journey with your with\nanyone that you know it's it's really\nreally hard and to watch somebody you\nknow just really\num be super sick in front of you anyway\nwith that said um and I had I felt a lot\nof anxiety I was you know moving through\nall sorts of emotions but during that\ntime I remember being like\nokay like\nif I can get through this\nI'm gonna be so strong\nand learning so much about myself I'm\nlearning so much about life and death\nand everything in between\nI even thought about the fact that my\nmom at the time hadn't lost a parent yet\nI'm like\nyou know when I lose my dad\nI'm gonna be able to understand so many\nmore people who either will or have lost\ntheir parent because for the most part\nstatistically that's something that\neveryone will go through\nand in a way I'm lucky because I'm gonna\nhave so much empathy and understanding\nfor these people for the rest of my life\nat such an early age that I can be\nthankful for\nand really seeing like trying so hard to\nfind a gift in that and\nobviously you know I don't wish that\nupon anybody but it did give me that\nreframe to be like okay\nlike even though this is hard like this\nis gonna allow me to connect to people\nin such a special way because everyone\nwill go through this and I get to be\nthere for them\nand so again I think it's about future\npacing it's about creating a different\nmeaning about what what that means that\ndoesn't mean that what you're going\nthrough and the story that you initially\ncreated isn't valid but it's equally\nvalid as any other stories you can\ncreate about this\nthey can both exist they can all exist\nso I hope that supports you\nthat is very touching truly just seeing\nhow you\nyou're your mindset throughout it all\ntrying to find\ntry to find a gift in situations where I\nthink pretty much anyone would agree\nthat it's so hard that all you want to\ndo is sleep in bed and not leave and and\nto find that energy Define that that\nsource of\nnot really motivation but that source of\nyou know just how you how your mom\ninspired you to\nto\num\novercome your challenges through you\nknow applying to college all all of that\nit's impactful\njust finding that one thing I think or\none or two things that help push you\nthrough is I think a good good piece of\nadvice that I'm taking from this also if\nyou feel like sleeping\nsleep\nI think in a society we have put so much\npressure about\njust pushing through and I don't think\nthat's what resilience really means\nyes I think it's finding the strength to\nmove through certain things of course\nbut sometimes that looks like sleeping\nyou need to sleep if you need to rest I\nwish I knew that actually earlier on\nwhile I am very\num grateful that I got through some of\nthese experiences with strength I also\nwish I knew to rest more to be honest so\nif you need to sleep take a freaking nap\nand calm down your nervous system that's\nokay\nyou know\nyeah definitely resilience looks\ndifferent for everyone I think the\noverall takeaway is that it's really\nknowing yourself knowing what your body\nneeds and doing having the the grit\nHaving the courage to do exactly that\nbecause sometimes you know our body's\nvery good our body will send us signals\nover to cold you know I just as an\nexample the hypothalamus has this whole\nlike set point you know it's going to do\nthings gonna change the way that we\nmetabolize\nfood the way that we break down glucose\nall of that to make sure that we are\nfeeling comfortable that's that's just\none example when we're hungry our brain\nis going to release some hormones to\nencourage us to eat things like that\nlike our body knows what is what it\nwants for the most part and so\nthe problem really comes when when our\nminds get in the way when we know that\nwe're so tired but we want to continue\nto push through because for whatever\nreason\num we're just telling ourselves to do\nthat even though we know it's not in our\nbody's best interests so I think really\nbeing resilient is listening to yourself\nlistening to your body and knowing that\ntruly your God knows what is the right\nthing to do and following that\nI don't know I didn't put it that\ngracefully but hopefully that message\ngets across that's beautiful I I love\nthat so much and I think um also\nalso\num\nto get a little bit woo-woo if you'd\nlike if you have a god of your own if\nyou just would like to connect to your\nbest self you want to connect to the sky\nthe universe whatever you want to call\nit\num\nthat's something that you can also\nconnect to during the time of these\ndifficult times I prayed a lot I\nconnected to something bigger than\nmyself and that gave me strength too and\nyou don't have to call that anything\num it's not about a religion but it is\nabout\nacknowledging that there might be other\nways to\nfeel divinely protected and guided\nand I do believe in that because if if\num you know I I think we talked about\nthis the other day the universe God\nwhatever you want to call it is\nconspiring for us at the end of the day\nI truly believe that in my heart that we\nare\nwe are gifted these difficult\nexperiences because our journey is not\nsupposed to be quote-unquote easy and\nconvenient but it's supposed to help us\ndiscover who we are what we're made of\nwhat our Spirits are made of what our\nsouls are about\nso and eventually our souls will evolve\nthrough that so\nif that's the case like\nwe can continue to connect to something\nthat's bigger than us and you know and\nthere's also scientific research on\nevidence that whether you believe in the\nstuff or not that praying is actually\nmost beneficial for the prayer not the\nprayee because it's just another form of\nmindfulness calms on your nervous system\ncreates hope it connects you to\nsomething bigger\num and I found that to be really helpful\num it would be impossible for me to talk\nabout resilience without talking about\nmy spiritual connection to the universe\nwhatever you want to call it\nI think there is a way that you can\nreally Source I mean some when I do\nthink about and for me maybe that being\nthat\nthing that's bigger than us doesn't even\nhave to be a being outside of us it just\ncould mean like your future self because\nshe you're here whoever knows like they\nknow they know that\nI mean if they exist they're fine\nsomewhere in the future so they must\nknow how to get through this connect to\nthat if it's weird for you to connect to\num\nyou know some sort of God or universe or\nwhatever just connect to your future\nself and ask them questions how did you\nget there\nhow did you overcome this journal about\nit let it flow through you\num we can Source infinite energy that\nway I think every one of those moments\nthat it was really difficult for me I\nthink I met and I was Guided by My\nFuture Self like when I was 17 I swear I\nI was talking to my you know wiser stuff\nback then\num I think one of the ways that I\nchannel that was through writing I write\nI looked at some of my writings and my\npoetry from when I was very young and\nI'm like how did I know to write that\nand some of the Poetry uh poems that\nI've written didn't even make sense\nuntil I was way older like but I wrote\nit it was almost like I was like meeting\nmy future self in those moments so I\nthink it's possible\nI think it's so amazing to see how\nresilience for you really encompasses\nelements of spirituality elements of\nwhat people would call like principles\nand cognitive behavioral therapy\nprinciples of mindfulness your things\nthat make you excited things that make\nyou happy that of writing using your\nvoice to inspire others it all comes\ntogether and I just think it's it's\ntruly so inspirational just hear you\nspeak about so many different domains so\neloquently seeing those connections how\nthey relate to get together so\nit's truly amazing\nthank you Monica you're amazing\nI appreciate you you're such a great\nlistener and you ask such great\nquestions I really appreciate you\nfeelings mutual and I could definitely\nsee that in the community chat as well\nso thank you everyone\num\nlet's see if it's anything else but I\nhave I guess a final question for you\nand I think\nit kind of encompasses themes that we've\nchatted about right so themes around\nhappiness themes around building\nresilience overcoming challenges so if\nyou were to give one advice to your\nyounger self to perhaps\nthe community\nwhat would it be\nmy younger self\num\nfor my younger self\num\nmy younger self was just kind of like\ngive you a two-second background of my\nyounger self so in my late late teens in\nmy early 20s\nI didn't really have a lot of tools to\nmanage my stress and the trauma that\nI've gone through and all that\nit resorted a lot to very unhealthy\nhabits\nlike overachieving like drinking a lot I\nmean that was a part of my journey to be\nhonest and I wish I\nand I did eventually find healthier ways\nto manage my Stress and Anxiety which\nwas for me yoga\num meditation helping others that it's\nalways that all been very helpful but I\nwish\nI asked for help earlier\nI wish I\num\nfound a therapist or some kind of Mentor\nor somebody who can really actively help\nme sooner to help\nif I'm healthier coping mechanisms\nbecause you know I've I've talked to\npeople who self-harm and all that\num\nI think I was self-harming myself maybe\nnot directly but absolutely indirectly\nyou know I I did not have the healthiest\ncoping mechanisms\nand I really feel for the people who\nresort to that and I want to remind you\nand let you know if you're one of them\nand myself from my younger years if I\nget to give myself advice there's\nhealthier coping mechanisms\nand\nI can say this now because even though\nI've gone through a lot of things with\nresilience back then it was still coming\nfrom a survival mindset so while I could\nsee kind of like the short term\npossibility of what's possible I don't\nthink I really saw long term meaning\nlike when I'm like 50 67 year old\nand when I think about those years now\nI'm like wow I really wish I took care\nof myself better back then to manage my\nstress and anxiety and have compassion\nfor the years I didn't however I also\nwish I did so\nI think seeking help earlier asking for\nhelp\num and not having this responsibility to\nfeel like I have to do everything on my\nown I was hyper independent\num so that's one thing but also that\nshe's loved now she will be okay\nbecause I don't know if I knew that\nsometimes I think I like you know\nobviously knew that it's like I'm here\nbut there's times I was really scary so\njust yeah and I think I'm telling you\nsometimes I feel like these moments when\nI say these things out loud whether in\ninterviews or just journaling or\nwhatever I really feel like my younger\nself heard me my future show\nbecause\nI don't know how I got through that\nsometimes\nbut um yeah\nthank you so much for sharing truly\nbeing so open and so vulnerable it's not\neasy and uh thank you yeah thank you\nyeah\num\nso I'm just reading some of the comments\nhere\nyeah I I'm also reading it and just so\ngrateful for the community for joining\nour conversation today I know we touched\nupon so many different topics from\nWellness resilience happiness challenges\nspirituality you name it and getting to\nget a bit of an insight into your\namazing your powerful mindset is yeah\nit's truly an honor and I really hope\nthat everyone here also enjoyed the chat\nso I just want to also flag for people\nwho are watching the link for Yuri's\nbook is in the description box it is\ntruly so amazing you know\nI'm just so inspired to hear that you\nhave come so far from not being able\nable to understand English and now\nwriting a book to influencing others you\nknow that is something\nthat few people can do so thank you so\nmuch for your time today for sharing\nyour journey\nand\nwe'll definitely be chatting again soon\nyes yes thank you so much Monica I'm so\ngrateful that you invited me for
