    "transcript": "Band-Aids can help when you get hurt but\none of the wounds you cannot see\nemotional abuse might not be visible but\nbeing constantly wounded emotionally\nwears you out leaving scars internally\nemotional abuse can have a traumatic\nimpact on the nervous system research\nnow includes the impact from emotional\nabuse as cptsd or complex post-traumatic\nstress disorder A variation of PTSD that\nhappens because of trauma that is\nongoing and where you cannot leave the\nsituation here's a list of signs that\nyou've been emotionally abused to help\nwith early identification of abusive\nrelationships number one A kingdom of\nisolation\nwhether it's from a partner or even\nParents emotional abuse has the tendency\nto leave you feeling sapped researchers\ntheorize the emotional abuse May\ncontribute to the development of\nconditions such as chronic fatigue\nsyndrome\nliving each day walking on eggshells\nleaves you feeling drained emotionally\nabuse people withdraw to feel safe you\nbegin to dread social interaction of any\nkind as you have little strength to\nanswer for any conversation you had or\nan action you took that the abuser did\nnot approve of\nwe can take the form of isolation where\nyou don't go out or speak to anybody it\nmay also be to try to avoid or become\ninvisible to the abuser in hopes that\nthe abuse will stop\nnumber two\nthe reign of worthlessness emotional\nabuse can alter your perception you can\nspend years thinking you're worthless\nI'm not good enough that don't matter\nemotional abuse leads its victims to\nplay these thoughts on repeat\nresearchers have demonstrated that\nemotional abuse is strongly associated\nwith low self-esteem more so than other\nforms of abuse the insults and criticism\ngradually eat away at the victim's sense\nof self-worth you begin to see yourself\nThrough The Eyes of all those\ninsinuations and even blame yourself for\nthe abuse number three\nThe Fortress of avoidance\ngrowing up in a strictly controlling\nenvironment you struggle with being\nvulnerable you learn to use secretive\nBehavior as an escape route to avoid\nconflict a study shows these individuals\nadopt avoidant attachment style you are\ntaught to disregard uncomfortable\nfeelings and as a result you're now\nquick to avoid such situations even as\nan adult you avoid connection whenever\npossible to minimize further hurt it's\ndifficult for you to open up to someone\nresearch shows this can take a toll on\nyour relationships as you try to brush\neverything under the rug instead of\naddressing the issues\nnumber four the non-stop blame game\nis it normal for you to apologize to\ninanimate object like a chair or a sofa\nafter you accidentally bump into it do\nyou blame yourself for things out of\nyour control\nresearch has shown that an abuser often\ntries to shift all blame and guilt onto\nthe victim making you believe that the\nabuse is your fault\nadd this to the supposed reinforcement\nof outside events the victim comes to\nbelieve that they are the cause for\neverything and so automatically\napologizes for anything that goes wrong\neven when there's no way to control or\nknow about the situation at all number\nfive a battle of frequent outbursts\nit's a hard pill to swallow when someone\nclose to us constantly blows hot and\ncold\nserving as a tool for intimidation\naccording to research this emotional\npush and pull can leave you feeling\nrejected confused and frustrated you\nbecome extremely hyper Vigilant being\nafraid to make even the smallest mistake\nyou overanalyze everything to try to\nminimize chances of conflict the anxiety\nof keeping things in control leaves you\nfeeling extremely wound up and so you\ncan break down even at the slightest\nhint of things going south it can also\nbe expressed as anger instead of sadness\nalthough suppressed emotions of\nviolation developed throughout abuse\ncome out when you feel like all your\nefforts want to waste and number six\nconceal don't feel\ndoes it seem like you're moving through\nthe motions of life with little to no\nenjoyment or do you feel like you can't\nconnect with people normally because you\njust don't feel like yourself\nevery word that flies towards you\nregisters is a dart on your emotions the\nbrain interprets emotional abuse as\ntrauma and hence triggers mechanisms to\nhelp you cope one such coping mechanism\nis emotional numbness\nstudies show that people who were\nemotionally abused as children are more\nlikely to experience emotional\ndysregulation including emotional\nnumbing as adults victims use this as an\nescape switch for the distressing\nsituations faced in an emotionally\nabusive relationship you learn to seal\naway your feelings in an attempt to\nprotect yourself and detach from painful\nfeelings related to the situation it's\nscary to reach out for help but it's one\nof the best ways to end the cycle of\nabuse and get your life back and you're\nworth it if you found this video helpful\nbe sure to share it with others who\nmight need to hear it for more related\nvideos
