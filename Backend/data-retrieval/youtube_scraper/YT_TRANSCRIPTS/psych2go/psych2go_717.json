    "transcript": "what is self-love\naccording to psychology today self-love\nis an umbrella term for different acts\nof love we perform toward ourselves\nphysically and non-physically this means\nbeing trusting respectful and forgiving\nto yourself\nlacking in this area can not only affect\nyour mental state but also influence\nyour relationships so how can your lack\nof self-love affect your relationships\nlet's take a look you have difficulties\nsaying what you really think\nhaving good self-esteem allows you to\nexpress your needs to others without\ntaking it personally if they don't fully\nagree lacking in this area can make it\ndifficult to communicate what those\nneeds are and lead to a less fulfilling\nrelationship you may find yourself\njumping through hoops to appease your\npartner instead of being open with what\nis bothering you licensed clinical\nProfessor counselor Katrina fager states\nthat in many cases having a low\nsensitive self-love comes from childhood\nperhaps you didn't feel that the adults\nin your life believed in you or you\nweren't given a healthy model of how to\nbe self-assured\nwhenever the case may be you may find\nthat problems arise in your relationship\nbut you're unable to properly address\nthem\nyou do not enforce boundaries\nit's difficult to say no to someone you\nworry about how they react or if they'll\nleave you\nthis can make it so bad that you\noverlook your partner's bad habits out\nof fear that they'll react poorly if you\naddress it\nDr Elizabeth Scott a psychologist and\nauthor states that this is called\nrejection sensitivity rejection\nsensitivity causes you to act in ways to\navoid any kind of rejection real or\nperceived and it can happen at your own\nexpense\ndoctors got further states that\nneglecting your boundaries can lead to\nfurther issues like resentment stress\nand even problems with your physical\nhealth\nsetting boundaries is a healthy part of\nany relationship and allows you to be\nclear with others on what you are and\nare not comfortable with\nhaving a lack of self-love can lead you\nto neglect your needs and put others\nabove you though this may seemingly keep\nthe relationship from failing it makes\nit difficult for you to feel fulfilled\nand also creates room to be taken\nadvantage of trying to be someone you\nare not in a relationship a lack of\nself-love might make it tough to be your\ntrue self\nyou might put a lot of effort into how\nyou look and how someone else perceives\nyou for example you might play up parts\nof your personality to another person\nthat you wouldn't around other people to\nmake yourself seem more positive\ntalkative or level-headed therapist\nStuart fensterheim states that in many\ncases this is a coping mechanism for\nsomeone sensitive to how others perceive\nthem to appease the people around them\nthey create a Persona that other people\nwill like to avoid rejection while it's\nimpossible to win everybody over you may\nfind that being authentic to yourself is\nmuch more fulfilling and pulls in closer\nrelationships even if they are fewer\nfensterheim further warns that many who\ncontinue to live in an inauthentic way\ncan lead to feelings of self-doubt and\nfuture uncertainty the phrase be\nyourself is the biggest takeaway you are\nconstantly worried about your position\nin the relationship in a relationship\nlow self-esteem and a lack of self-love\ncan lead to jealousy and insecurity\nyou may doubt your worth in the\nrelationship and assume it's a\ncoincidence that they like you people\nwho lack self-love often worry that\ntheir partner will be attracted to\nsomeone else or that they'll leave their\nrelationship at any moment an article\nfrom Psych alive terms this as\nrelationship anxiety this is where you\nworry about different aspects of your\nrelationship and put immense stress on\nyourself these thoughts can brood and\noverpower you making your relationship\nunpleasant it's important to have\nconfidence in yourself and your partner\nto trust in each other in the end\nfeeling insecure in the relationship can\nfurther hurt it rather than addressing\nthe weaknesses\nsettling for whatever comes your way\npeople with a lack of self-love are\nusually ready to commit to the first\nperson who shows any interest in them\nand they lose a lot of their thoughts\nand opinions when it comes to who they\nchoose to be in a relationship with\nthis can lead to settling for behaviors\nthat you are not okay with many people\ndo this out of fear of losing a\nrelationship and being alone however Dr\nJill Weber from Psychology today states\nthat maintaining higher standards will\nbenefit you as you have more control\nover getting what you want out of life\nshe states this will help with your\nself-esteem and will make it easier to\nstep away from Bad situations\nit's important to know your values and\nuphold them even though it may be\ndifficult and you may face rejection you\nwill find that it will be more\nfulfilling to be in the company of\nsomeone who cares\nversus settling for Less self-love is\nimportant for your well-being and in\nturn important for the relationships in\nyour life\nimproving this skill can be difficult\nbut it's possible by starting with small\nsteps you may find that speaking to a\nqualified mental health professional is\none of these steps in other cases taking\nthe time to have an honest and open\nconversation with your partner about\nthings to improve on can help get the\nball rolling getting in
