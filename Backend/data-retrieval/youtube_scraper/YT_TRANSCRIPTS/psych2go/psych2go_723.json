    "transcript": "sometimes it's hard to tell whether or\nnot a person likes us especially when\nour nerves get in the way and we start\nseeing everything as a sign don't worry\nhere at psych2go we have compiled a\nshort list of five common things to look\nout for to determine whether or not that\nperson likes you or who you are\nmirroring\nmarrying is synchronized movements we do\nwhen we like someone or are with friends\nor family\nimagine Health a psychology Service\nwebsite says that this is called limbic\nsynchrony and it happens due to the fact\nthat when we used to live in tribes\nbeing in sync with the members of your\ngroup was vital for survival\nsome of the things that can happen when\nwe are mirroring are copying another's\nbody language or things like speech tone\nvibration pitch volume even using the\nsame words or speech patterns as someone\nelse copying someone's facial\nexpressions and facial movements when\nyou laugh or yawn\nmimicking seated or standing postures\nand coordinated walking\nmirroring body language is a non-verbal\nway to show empathy States imagine\nHealth it signals that we are connected\nto that person in some way\nmirroring happens due to nerve cells in\nthe brain called mirror neurons that\nunconsciously make you mimic another\nperson's movements when you like or\ntrust them when friends or family are\ninvolved mirroring takes a slightly\ndifferent meaning than when you like\nsomeone according to imagine Health when\nit comes to family and friends mirroring\nis a sign of comfort and Trust\nit's a way to better understand others\nand connect with them\nsee if you notice people marrying each\nother next time you go out\nanother type of body language that we\nneed to look out for when liking someone\nor when we want to know if someone likes\nus is space typically when we like\nsomeone we tend to move closer to them\nor face them with as much of our bodies\nas possible\nthis happens because we want the other\nperson to know that we're interested in\nthem and we're paying attention\nwith our full attention on them we hope\nthat they notice and pay the same\nattention to us\nthis can look a few ways according to\nscience of people intimate space Zone\ndoes this person get really intimate\nwith you by entering your intimate space\nZone the intimate zone is 0 to 18 inches\nfrom your face\nleaning does this person lean in towards\nyou or do they move away\nleaning is a non-verbal cue of\npartnership agreeableness and\ncamaraderie\ntouch does this person find subtle ways\nto touch your arm or hand we use Touch\nto Signal connection if someone has done\nthis it may mean that they're interested\nin or like you\nasking questions have you ever wondered\nwhy people who like us ask questions\nasking questions opens up communication\nchannels and helps us get to know the\nother person better it also lets the\nother person know that we're interested\nin them and that we're paying attention\nto them Linda Bloom a licensed clinical\nsocial worker and her husband Charlie\nwho has a master's degree in social work\nexplained in an article for psychology\ntoday not asking questions invites\nopenness\naccording to the blooms cultivating the\nart of asking questions of others and\nourselves helps us open our potential\nfor learning by asking questions and\nbeing sincere with our emotions we can\nenhance our relationships the blooms\nfurther explained that asking questions\nis the antidote to mind reading or\nassuming things about our partner or\npotential partner by preventing the\nhardening of the Mind due to the\narrogance that mind reading or assuming\ncan cause\nif you want to know if someone likes you\nbecome aware of whether or not they're\nasking questions to get to know you\nbetter\ndo they listen are they focused on you\nif you like someone and want to get to\nknow them ask them questions and listen\neye contact\neye contact has been found to strengthen\nrelationships and increase attraction\nbetween people if you want to know\nwhether or not that person likes you\nnotice that they keep eye contact with\nyou during and outside the conversation\nlicensed psychologist Marty Cooper head\nof Cooper mental health counseling\nstates that a study found that as we\nmake eye contact oxytocin the love\nhormone is released\nuh what does this mean Cooper explains\nthat eye contact leads to engagement\nlooking into your partner's eyes during\nconversations is a great way to make\nthem feel heard show them you care and\nexpress your love eye contact also helps\nbuild intimacy by helping people connect\nwith others emotions through their eyes\nCooper says that eye contact is\nessential for bonding and keeps the\ninteraction alive over time now does\nthat mean that you have to stare at\ntheir eyeballs all the time no in fact\nthere are different types of eye contact\nthat Cooper discusses\nboth accidental and conscious glances\ncan indicate attraction intense eye\ncontact signals a strong bond and\nattraction lingering glances occur\nbetween couples during conversations and\nsuggests that they really connect with\neach other\nsee if you can catch your person looking\nat you and try to identify what type of\neye contact they're making it might tell\nyou whether they like you or not\nemotional attentiveness\nour emotional needs are a part of who we\nare that can't be denied\nif you want to know whether or not your\nperson likes you for who you are notice\nif they're emotionally attentive to you\ndo they pay attention when you're sad or\ndown and offer a helping hand do they\nwork to learn and accommodate things\nlike your love language whether theirs\nis different from yours or not\ndo they take into consideration and\nrespect your emotional needs such as\naffection security Independence and\nTrust\nif they do then there's a high\nprobability that they like you not only\nsuperficially but also for who you are\nemotional needs are a big part of\nourselves and our relationships that we\noften need to address in order to stay\nhealthy\na Healthline article states that\nemotional needs shift change and new\nones can be discovered over time\nsomeone who takes the time to learn all\nof your needs and adapt accordingly is\nsomeone who is both interested in you\nand deeply cares about you especially\nwhen fulfilling your emotional needs is\nnot the other person's responsibility\nyet they offer to do it anyways\nwe hope this has helped you understand\nwhat people do when they like someone do\nyou think someone likes you and you want\nto find out try to notice if this person\ndoes some of the things on this list and\nthen let us know in the comments and\nplease share this video with others if\nyou enjoyed it until next time and don't\nforget you matter"
