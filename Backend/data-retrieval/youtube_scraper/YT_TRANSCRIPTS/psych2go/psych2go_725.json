something she's personally taught me\nthat I think was really helpful was how\nto daydream again I think we get so\nstuck in our negativity uh we forget to\ndream and to look forward to the future\nwe just get scared about the future\nwhich is what anxiety is right\num so she is a life coach and she's mine\nas well as well as psych2go CEO the\nYouTube channel owner she is our life\ncoach and

on\npsych2go we talk about that mental\nhealth piece and um I'm just really glad\nto be able to\ndo this with you so yeah yes thank you\nyeah\nthank you so much for the introduction\num yeah so Melody is a dear soul sister\nas well as dear Soul client of mine we\nmet through our friend Leonard a long\ntime ago in Korea during the pandemic\nand when I saw her I just knew that we\nwere going to work together not like\nwork together but like I knew we were\ngoing to collaborate and somehow I saw\nthis potential in her that I don't think\nshe even solved for herself yet\nand I could see that everything that she\nwas going through at the time was going\nto be such a powerful part of her story\nso I'm just really grateful that I got\nto work with you I got to connect you\nand psych to go and\num that was in 2020 right 2020 or 2021\nwhere we got to live stream\nand\num yeah in the last year and a half\nyou've really just run with your mission\nto serve the world and create impact\npositively\num with your community that you created\nfrom that day and I'm really proud of\nyou and you know working as your coach\nhas been such an honor to be able to\nwitness that transformation very\nintimately as well and I'm so proud of\nyou she's a big she's a baddie but she's\namazing so yeah so I'm really excited to\nshare her transformation\nand so on so we'll be talking about all\nof that today\num\nso yeah let's get started with this so I\nthink you know before we talked about\nthis last time that we had a live stream\nlike this we started out with a story\nand it was really powerful and today we\nactually wanted to start with the story\naround forgiveness and this is one of my\nfavorite stories in the world it's a\nshort story so I'm going to be reading\nit for you guys in just a little bit but\nsuch a powerful story\num so with that said how many of you\nguys have aspects of yourself that you\ncan forgive and let go\nif you have something\num say\nI forgive myself in the chat\nI forgive myself there's something that\nyou\nwant to\nforgive aspects of yourself reading lame\nI promise it'll be really powerful I can\nforgive and let go yes yes yes yes\nit's okay if you don't feel comfortable\nenough to share out loud or publicly\neven if you can think inside yourself or\nyou have a journal nearby if you can\nwrite down something that you want to\neven if you can't forgive yourself\nat least identify something that you\nwant to forgive yourself for yeah that's\nreally powerful and if there is somebody\nother than yourself\nyes\nI found that\nin my own Journey while I see you guys\nresponding here\num\nwe are mirrors and we project what we're\ngoing through so if there's someone else\nin your life that's really difficult to\nforgive and if you can identify that\nperson\num I find that it's hard to forgive\nothers if I also don't know how to\nforgive the worst parts of myself and\nsomething I've been working on\nparticularly in the last two years\nespecially since the last live stream\nwas forgiving my father and I'll\nprobably go into this a little bit more\nbut I just want to share with you guys a\nlarge part of why I'm a mental health\nAdvocate is because I lost my father to\nsuicide and so I've spent a lot of time\nthinking about what drives a person to\na place like that and I've had to\nforgive him for leaving right and then\nwe have abandonment issues and all these\nthings and that anxiety like what is my\nfuture going to look like so\num maybe find someone that's you felt\nyou wronged you or is really hard to\nforgive and yeah I guess I guess just\nidentify that person and identify pieces\nin yourself\num those are things that have helped me\nat least come to terms with my anxiety\nand um other parts of I guess my\nBrokenness and being lost growing up\nso\nyeah that's that's a little bit there I\nsee what you guys are saying here that's\nsuper this is super beautiful\nso think about that person that you can\nforgive today\nlike another person outside of yourself\nand then aspects of yourself that you\nwant to forgive because we all have\nthose aspects but also somebody that you\ncan forgive\nand with that person in mind today I'm\ngoing to read you a story and I promise\nit's a really powerful story it's by\nsomebody who wrote on a really beautiful\nbook called conversation with god his\nname is Neil Donald Walsh\nbut this story is called the little soul\nand the sun it's actually a children's\nbook but it's really really powerful\naround forgiveness\nso if you're ready to listen to this\num and any time during the story\nsomething resonates\nI want you to say\nforgiveness is power\nin the chat let us know that it's\nresonating with you\nlet us feel connected to you\ncool\nthank you guys\nwho reads the story\nOnce Upon no time there was a little\nsoul who said to God I know who I am\nand God said that's wonderful who are\nyou\nand the little soul shouted I am the\nlight\nGod smiled a big smile that's right God\nexclaimed you are the light\nthe little soul was so happy for had\nfigured out what All Souls in the\nKingdom were there to figure out\nwow said the little soul this is really\ncool\nbut soon knowing who it was was not\nenough the little soul felt stirrings\ninside and now wanted to be who it was\nand so the little soul went back to God\nwhich is not a bad idea for All Souls\nwho want to be who they really are and\nsaid hi God now that I know who I am is\nit okay for me to be it\nand God said you mean you want to be who\nyou already are\nwell replied the little soul it's one\nthing to know who I am and another thing\nall together to actually be it I want to\nfeel what it's like to be the light\nbut you already are the light God\nrepeated smiling again\nyes but I want to see what that feels\nlike right the little soul\nwell said God with a chuckle I suppose I\nshould have known you're always you\nalways were The Adventurous one\nthen God's expression changed there's\nonly one thing\nwhat ask the little soul\nwell there's nothing else but the light\nyou see I created nothing but what you\nare and so there's no easy way for you\nto experience yourself as who you are\nsince there is nothing that you are not\nhuh that the little soul who is now a\nlittle confused think of it this way\nsaid God you're like a candle in the sun\noh you're there all right along with a\nmillion gazillion other candles who make\nup the sun and the sun would not be the\nsun without you nay it wouldn't be a sun\nwithout one of its candles and that\nwould not be the Sun at all for it would\nnot shine as brightly yet how to know\nyourself as a light when you are in this\ndelight that is the question\nwell the little soul perked up your God\nthink of something\nonce more God smile I already have God\nsaid since you cannot see yourself as a\nlight when you are in the light will\nsurround you with Darkness\nwhat's darkness the little soul asked\nGod replied it is which you are not\nWill I Be Afraid of the Dark cried the\nlittle soul only if you choose to be God\nanswered\nthere's nothing really to be afraid of\nunless you decide that there is\nyou see we're making it all up we're\npretending oh is that the little soul\nand felt better already\nthen God explained that in order to\nexperience anything at all the exact\nopposite of it will appear\nit is a great gift God said because\nwithout it you could not know what\nanything is like you could not know warm\nwithout cold up without down fast\nwithout slow you could not know left\nwithout right here without there now\nwithout then and so God concluded when\nyou are surrounded by Darkness do not\nshake your fist and raise your voice and\ncurse the darkness rather be a light\nunto the darkness and don't be mad about\nit then you will know who you really are\nand all others will know too let your\nlight shine so that everyone will know\nhow special you are\nyou mean it's okay to let others see how\nspecial I am ask the little soul\nof course got chuckled it's very okay\nbut remember special does not mean\nbetter everybody is special each in\ntheir own way yet many others have\nforgotten that they will see that it's\nokay for them to be special only when\nyou see that it is okay for you to be\nspecial wow said the little soul dancing\nand skipping and laughing and jumping\nwith joy I can be as special as I want\nto be\nyes and you can start right now said God\nwas dancing and skipping and laughing\nright along the little soul\nwhat part of special do you want to be\nwhat part of special the little soul\nrepeated I don't understand\nwell God explain\nbeing the light is being special and\nbeing special has a lot of parts to it\nit's special to be kind special to be\ngentle special to be creative special to\nbe patient can you think of any other\nways to be special\nthe little soul sat quietly for a moment\nI can think of lots of ways to be\nspecial the little soul claimed\nit is special to be helpful it is\nspecial to be sharing it is special to\nbe friendly it is special to be\nconsidered of others yes God agreed and\nyou can be all of those things or any\npart of special that you want to be\nat any moment that's what it means to be\nthe light\nI know what I want to be I know what I\nwant to be the little soul nouns with\ngreat excitement\nI want to be the part of special called\nforgiving\nisn't it special to be forgiving\noh yes\ngotta share the little soul that is very\nspecial\nokay set the little soul that's exactly\nwhat I want to be I want to be forgiving\nI want to experience myself as that good\nsaid God but there's one thing you\nshould know the little soul was becoming\na bit impatient now it's always seemed\nas though there was some complication\nwhat is it the little so sad\nthere's no one to forgive\nno one the little soul could hardly\nbelieve what had been said no one God\nrepeated everything I have made is\nperfect there's not a single soul in all\ncreation less perfect than you look\naround you\nit was then that the little soul\nrealized the large crowd had gathered\nSouls had come from far and wide from\nall over the kingdom for the word had\ngone forth that the little soul was\nhaving this extraordinary conversation\nwith god and everyone wanted to hear\nwhat they were saying\nlooking at the countless other Souls\ngathered there the little soul had to\nagree none appeared less wonderful less\nmagnificent less perfect than the little\nsoul itself\nsuch with the Wonder of the Soul\ngathered around\nand so bright their light that the\nlittle soul could scarcely gaze upon\nwho then to forgive\nto ask God boy this is going to be no\nfun at all Grumble the little soul I\nwanted to experience myself as the one\nwho Forgives I wanted to know what part\nof special that is like\ncan you guys hear me okay\nyep dipped out just a little bit but\nthe first part we're good to hear you\nokay not to worry a little soul\nwho then to forgive ask God boy this is\ngoing to be no fun at all grumbled a\nlittle soul I want myself as the one who\nForgives I wanted to know what that part\nof special feels like and the little\nsoul learned what it must feel like to\nbe sad but just then a friendly Soul\nstepped forward from the crowd not to\nworry little soul the friendly Soul said\nI will help you you will the little soul\nbrightened but what can you do why I can\ngive you something someone to forgive\nyou can\ncertainly cheer up the friendly soul I\ncan come into your next life and do\nsomething for you to forgive\nbut why why would you do that the little\nsoul asked you who are being of such\nutter Perfection you who vibrate with\nsuch a speed that it creates a light so\nbright that I can hardly gaze upon you\nwhat could cause you to want to slow\ndown your vibration to such a speed that\nyour light your bright light would\nbecome dark and dense what could cause\nyou who are who are so light and you\ndance upon the stars and move through\nthe kingdom with the speed of your\nthought to come into my life and make\nyourself so heavy that you could do this\nbad thing\nsimple the friendly Soul said I would do\nit because I love you\nthe little soul seemed to surprise to\nthe answer\ndon't be so amazed at the friendly Soul\nyou have done the same thing for me\ndon't you remember\noh we have danced together you and I\nmany times through the eons and across\nall the ages have we danced across all\nthe time and in many places how we\nplayed together you just don't remember\nwe have both been all of it we've been\nup and down a bit the left and the right\nof it\nwe have been here and the Dare of it the\nnow and then of it we have been the male\nand the female the good and the bad we\nhave both been the victim and the\nvillain of it thus we thus have we come\ntogether you and I many times before\neach bringing to other the exact and\nperfect opportunity to express and\nexperience who we really are and so the\nfriendlies will explain further I will\ncome into your next Lifetime and be the\nbad one this time I will do something\nreally terrible and then you can\nexperience yourself as the one who\nforgives\nbut what will you do the little soul\nasks just a little nervously that will\nbe so terrible\noh replied the friendly soul with a\ntwinkle\nwe'll think of something\nthen the friendly Soul seemed to turn\nserious and set he in a quiet voice\nyou're right about one thing you know\nwhat is that that little soul wanted to\nknow\nI will have slowed down my vibration and\nbecome very heavy to do this not so nice\nthing\nI will have to pretend to be something\nvery unlike myself\nand so I have but one favor to ask of in\nreturn this part always makes me cry\noh anything anything cry the little soul\nand begin to dance and sing I get to be\nforgiving I get to be forgiving\nthen the little soul saw the friendly\nSoul was remaining very quiet what is it\nthe little soul asked what can I do for\nyou you're such an angel to be willing\nto do this for me\nof course this friendly Soul was an\nangel got interrupted everyone's always\nremember I have sent you nothing but\nangels\nand so the little soul wanted more than\never to Grant the friendly Soul's\nrequest what can I do for you the little\nsoul asked again\nin the moment that I strike you and\nsmite you the friendly Soul replied and\nthe moment that I do the worst to you\nthat you could possibly imagine in that\nvery moment yes the little song\ninterrupted yes\nremember who I really am\noh I will cry the little soul I promise\nI will always remember you as I remember\nI see you right here right now good set\nthe friendly Soul because you will see\nI will have been pretending so hard I\nwill have forgotten myself and if you do\nnot remember me as I really am I may not\nbe able to remember for a very long time\nand if I forgot if I forget who I am you\nmay even forget who you are and we will\nboth be lost then we'll need another\nsoul to come along and remind us both of\nWho We Are\nno we won't the little soul promised\nagain I will remember you and I will\nthank you for bringing me this gift the\nchance to experience myself as who I am\nand so the agreement was made\nand the little soul went forth a new\nlifetime excited to be light the light\nwhich was very special and excited to be\nthat part of special called forgiveness\nand the little soul waited anxiously to\nbe the to experience a selfless\nforgiveness and to think whatever other\nSouls made if possible in all the\nmoments in that new lifetime whenever a\nNew Soul appeared on the scene whether\nthat new Soul brought Joy or sadness and\nespecially if it brought Sadness the\nlittle soul thought of what God had said\nalways remember God smiled I have sent\nyou nothing but angels\nthat's the story it's very beautiful\nthank you\nright\nthank you for sharing\nthank you for listening you guys what do\nyou guys think about the story oh this\nmakes\nyou read it beautifully and I was\nwatching the comments and they enjoyed\nthe story very much\nbeautiful story right and Light\nI'm curious what you guys think as well\na lot of people seem to be resonating\nyeah it's such a beautiful story it\nhelps me so much when I just need to let\ngo and you know we can just let go\nanytime like that\nand I know we promised that we would\nalso bring in kind of The Logical\nscientific you know side of this which\nis you know um this is something I talk\nto my clients about often whether we are\nholding on to resentment or fear or\nanger it's really about\nletting go of our commitment to feel\nthat way and in Neuroscience we call it\nthe refractory period and that's how\nlong we decide to hold on to these\nfeelings and that we actually always\nhave power over so remembering that\nalone and starting to practice that even\nthough it might be hard in the beginning\nit can be really powerful so anyway\num thank you for listening and now I've\ntalked enough I want to hear from Melody\nMelody first of all\num share with us where you were when we\nfirst had the conversation\nuh many many days ago many months ago I\nthink it was during Kobe so it must have\nbeen 2021. and we got to meet we got to\nconnect and something in my heart was\nlike please share your story and you've\nturned that into something so powerful\nso impactful so share with us where you\nwere where you are now and just share\nwith us your journey of turning pain to\npower\nwell\nthank you for that I I also just I think\nin my oh\nokay in my own uh Reflections while\nlistening\num to the story sometimes it takes me a\nlittle time to digest and I'm wondering\nif those in the audience are as well\num I think the biggest takeaways for me\nwas hearing\nhearing the word Angel what stood out to\nme the most and I I do want to say that\nI think your presence in my life is is a\nbit like an angel you know drops of\nlight and I could I could feel the\nemotion for you in this story so I'm\nreally glad you shared it\num because you know you and I connected\nlike you said in the last live stream\num this was in May of 2021 uh at that\ntime everybody who is listening right\nnow I was really lost and um\nreally processing\nthat was the first time that I had\nshared a what happened to me\nin my family every family and every\nperson goes through their own sets of um\ndifficulties\nbut I guess the one that was hard for me\nwas losing my father and Yuri had\nconnected to me as well that she's lost\nher father as well\num of course like that what I'm sorry\nyou guys I ramble a little bit it's the\noverthinking brain but\num\nuh that live stream was the first time I\nshared about his suicide publicly I had\nalways told people it was an accident\nbecause that's what I was led to believe\nand so\neven in the understanding of um\nthe truth behind his death which was a\nchoice right and I know a lot of you\num probably struggle with depression\nI've had my struggles I know Yuri's had\nhers as well um\nwith multiple things\num it's really hard to\ngrapple with it was very painful and\nthat's why our\nour title for today is from pain into\nPower\num\nbecause during that time during that\nlive stream I shared for the first time\nwhat happened to me and I'm just a I'm\njust a human being like you know I grew\nup in the suburbs like I don't know like\num but that was really hard for me and I\nwas so sad I was super lack of a better\nword and I shared that story the\nstarfish story\nthat was a story that impacts me and\ntoday we heard what impacts Yuri\nand um\nthat story is just about how\nif you can just help one person that\nmakes all the difference and uh where am\nI going with this ah so then a lot of\nyou guys here in the comments you guys\nwere just sharing like we're starfishes\nand I was like oh you know what that's a\ngreat idea so I'm gonna make a Discord\naround the starfish idea and came out\nwith starfish Community well what do you\nknow here we are a year and a half\nalmost two years later I've still been\nworking on starfish and I look at that\nmoment that painful moment where I was\ncrying in front of a bunch of strangers\nI don't know you guys and yes I am\nwearing pajamas I saw you guys comments\num\nyeah\nthat space has changed my life because\nI've been able to connect\nwith so many of you\nand hear about what your lives are like\nand\nas painful as it is uh to Grapple with\nwhat would bring a parent\nto such a dark place\nor to lose somebody\nyou know whether that be death or\nbreakup or anything\nand then hear and connect with other\npeople who what pains them that was\nreally powerful\num\nI\nhave found and assigned myself some\nmeaning\nand um\nsometimes all it takes is a window of\nopportunity and a moment of inspiration\nand you can ride that momentum into a\nbetter future and you don't even know\nwhat it looks like for me at least I\nthink of it as\nsome days we have great weather some\ndays we have thick fog and on those\nsticky thick Bucky days\num you can only see like one or two\nsteps ahead of you right like you're\nlike I don't know where I'm going and\nthen you take one step at a time and\nthen some days it's a sunny bright day\nyou have a lot of energy and you're like\nyep that's where I'm going I know\nexactly where I'm headed this direction\nbut every day changes and you lose\nrandom things along the way and like\nmost of the time it's people\nand that's What Hurts the Most and pets\nlike low-key pets are great I um\nthat that's a little bit more about how\nmy life has gone since the last live\nstream and I really love connecting with\nyou guys right now\num\njust seeing what you guys have to say in\nthe comments and so to bring back the\nattention to you guys I I wonder what's\nsomething\nwhat's something really painful for you\nright now\num because it's like you know you look\nat these things that are so painful and\nyou can't imagine\nuh how could that transform into\nsomething powerful like how how can I\nuse something painful and make meaning\nout of that that sounds ridiculous I\ntotally understand\num so I'm wondering what do you guys\nwhat is paining you what is what where\nis your heart what is weighing you down\nor what is pain in your mind I suppose\nand yes I can be a little Derpy so hello\nto answer that I would love to just\num address some of these comments here\nfirst of all I think thank you for\nsharing Melody and I know this is a very\nvulnerable story for you and I really\nacknowledge you for really\nthis is one you know among many things\nbut one of the things that I really\nadmire about you is you have this\nability to really dig deep to speak from\nwhat's truly authentic and present for\nyou and sometimes that's going to look\nless than perfect I love that I think\nthat's most perfect because you know\nwe're humans and we're supposed to like\nyou know the only reason we strive for\nPerfection is because we think we're not\nperfect already which is so silly\num and yeah I'm seeing some of these\ncomments and listen like there's so many\npeople who are moving through or have\nmoved through either losing their parent\nalso or losing somebody close to them\nand guess what if you haven't not to\ninsult\nfear around this because you shouldn't\nfear this\nwe're all gonna lose somebody we love at\none point I mean that's really\nthe cycle of life I mean it's silly to\nbe in the solution that we think we're\nnever going to lose someone we love\nso if you have lost someone if you are\nscared of losing someone that you love\nwell congratulations you're human and\nthat's okay\nand that's why we get to connect and\nshare these human experiences and\nvalidate and support each other knowing\nthat this is so normal there isn't one\nperson in this world who's not gonna\nexperience grief in some way I promise\nyou\nsomebody just said and I want to address\nthis because this I I'm not triggered by\nthis but I don't want people to\nthink I think there's a stigma when\npeople are moving through difficult\nchallenges like\ncoming back to neutral for some people\nis a really big deal and when we talk\nabout power it's you know coming back to\nneutral as well as making something out\nof it and wherever you are in that\njourney I really acknowledge you because\nI've been every part of that journey and\nit takes immense amount of power in the\nfirst place is to acknowledge what's\ngoing on\nand so I don't think we're confusing\npower with complacency in fact since\nI've lost my dad in with you know from\ncancer\nI've turned my life into a whole\ndifferent direction I was in the\ncorporate world nothing wrong with being\nin the corporate world I just knew I\nwasn't personally aligned with who I was\nand what I was supposed to do with my\nlife and what I really wanted to create\nfor myself equip my corporate job\num I\nbuilt a business\num\nactually a few but um one of them being\nmy heart Mission driven\npractice my coaching practice and\nobviously Melody is one of my clients or\nwas and\num psyched to go was one of my clients\nand I've written books and I'm\npassionate about what I do and Melody\nhas created this whole Community since\nher addressing her pain and sharing\nshe's helping a lot of people and she's\ndoing it because she genuinely cares\nbecause she genuinely wants to create an\nimpact\nand I think that's really powerful so I\njust want to address that here we are\ncreating the safe space By the way for\nsupport and love and while all comments\nare appreciated I really want to invite\nall of you guys to be in this safe place\nthe supportive place not for us but for\neach other you know we're good we're\ngood but like we're here to support you\nso no judgment in this\nand then also\noh yeah let's um let's uh address some\nof these comments I know you asked them\nfor what they're moving through let's\nsee what they have to say\nso many people are moving through\nsomething\nI hear a lot of\nloss\nfriendships\nbreakups\ntrauma from parents family I'm sure\num\nperfectionism\nwe've been like the struggle with that\noh yes friends and families being\nunsupportive\nbeing sad is absolutely okay I'm going\nup so getting all up there being bullied\novereating under eating I'm sure as well\nautism\nuh\nby the way I autism is not a bad label\nat all it's a neurodivergent label and I\nalso attribute\nneurodivergence to myself\nbut not a lot of people will be able to\nunderstand\nthat experience\num\ndifficulty with friendships yep\nrejection it's all very difficult things\nthank you guys for sharing coming back\ndown\npeople are sharing this I want you guys\nto realize that you probably all have\nfelt that emotion at one point in your\nlife\nwhether you know they're scared they're\nafraid they're\num you know shame guilt whatever all of\nthese feelings are normal\neveryone experiences at one point just\nin different variations\nwith that said you know our our chat\nbeing about turning pain into Power\nLet's do an exercise right now it's an\nexercise that I help my clients with at\ntimes\nand it's an exercise around reframing\nbecause I can look at my hardships in my\nlife you guys I almost lost somebody\nthat is very close to me to Suicide also\nI've lost my dad to cancer it's been\nsome difficult challenges in my life\nhowever\nI had to learn to reframe these as a\nblessing and like At first like some\nmight feel even triggered like how could\nyou see that as a blessing but I truly\nbelieve that because of those things\nhappen\nI get to be who I am today\nso\nI just want to say\nwith whatever you're sharing or not\nsharing that you're holding in your\nheart as we talk about this like that\nmost painful thing that you're holding\non to\nI want to ask you two questions\nwhat benefit or what blessing has come\nfrom that\nand I want you to dig deep if it's hard\nfor you to get at you know really like\nconnect to that so for example\nI know that for me even though it was so\ndifficult to almost lose one of my\nparents to suicide\nI am here talking to you guys being able\nto connect being able to connect with\nMelody being able to connect with other\npeople who either have experienced these\nmental health challenges\nand or who are you know who have been\naffected by Suicide I've actually also\num volunteered and raised a bunch of\nfunds for American Foundation For\nSuicide Prevention helping other people\nsave their lives I've helped save some\nof my clients lives with or without\nknowing\num\nand I know\nfor you you've done you know Suicide\nHotline you've done different things to\nimmediately turn that into practical\npower as well\ntell us a little bit about that\nyeah um I also want to comment a couple\nthings here and talk about that address\nthat as well um I just\nI just see you guys being really\nvulnerable and sharing authentically I\nknow we're all a bunch of online\nstrangers I may not ever really meet you\nguys in person or see you or what I do\nhear everything you guys are moving\nthrough\num\nI I do want to say that the things that\nI hear\num also I see DJ Bond you said I learned\nI cannot stop someone I love from\nkilling themselves\num I I like to raise awareness around\nlike suicide awareness I'm not afraid to\nsay the word suicide but I know it makes\na lot of people uncomfortable uh I work\nfor a suicide hotline I actually have a\nshift tonight after this\num but\nyou hear some really\nterribly sad and heartbreaking things\nwhen um\nand over the phone too in their voice uh\nwhat people are moving through and kind\nof sometimes people are calling hotlines\nat the lowest moments of their lives you\nknow you never really wake up and think\nlike yep that's what I want to do today\ncall a hotline like it's um\npeople out there were really hurting and\nI see I see you guys sharing right now\nas well\num thank you for that sometimes just\nvoicing what you're moving through is a\nrelease in itself and\nthat's part of that transforming pain\ninto Power you need to\nlet things pass through\nand kind of to tap into also\nwhy we're talking about spirituality\ntoday it's not so much we're not really\ntrying to get into religion right it's\nmore the practice of\nwhat can you do\nto improve your spiritual health and\nyour mental health because they're\ninterconnected just like you guys know\nphysical health right physical mental\nhealth that's those are connected so is\nspiritual\num spiritual you can kind of Link the\nsoul and it's kind of introspection\nlooking into yourself I have found that\nwhen I meditate\nand even Studies have been done\nyou know you're more likely to have\na calmer nervous system\nyou're going to have reduced levels of\nstress\nyou're going to feel more grounded\nyou're going to have higher levels of\nfocus\num it's not easy but I just passed 50\ndays of daily meditation and 50 days of\nyes thank you\nuh\nsee that physical piece important I made\nit past 50 days of gym for the first\ntime in my life 50 days of meditation\nthat's the spiritual piece and then the\nmental piece is that gratitude streak\nand I know a lot of us here on psych2go\nwant to talk about the mental but\na little bit of that spiritual stuff can\nbe helpful and I know prayer is kind of\nlinked to more like religion and\nwhat is that like we don't like to talk\nabout that sometimes right because a lot\nof us also have been through religious\ntrauma and I'm not afraid to talk about\nit and if you can relate to that feel\nfree to share\num\nbecause it's hard when people press\nthings onto you right like their their\nbeliefs but\nat the end of the day it's kind of it's\na very subjective and individual\nexperience of learning\nwhat what do you know about the universe\nand not to get a little existential but\nwhy are we here why are we on a rock in\nspace you hear that a lot right like\nwhat are we doing here and so\nkind of exploring that and letting\nyourself think about it\nis healthy\nand they're all interconnected and so in\nthe last two years I thought I was just\ndoing the mental health thing but while\nI was going down that mental health\nJourney\nI found and stumbled across a lot of\nspiritual stuff too\nand\nI don't know wherever you guys are here\nthat in the comments all of you guys I\ndon't know where you are in your\nJourneys I don't know you you kind of\nknow me but not really\num there's so much so little you could\nknow about someone based off of like a\nlittle bit of an interaction or even\njust a couple photos right or like a\ncouple of paragraphs but I know in my\nintention With Yuri here today is that\nyou're here for a reason and I'm here\nfor a reason\nin this call where this live stream and\nwe're all trying\nwe're all trying to be okay\nand it's okay not to be okay\nI've been very not okay so is Yuri\nbut we don't want to be suffering and we\ndon't like pain\nso how can we transform that and\ntransmute it into something better\nand um\nthose are a couple of my thoughts there\nYuri I don't know I want to pass it to\nyou because I'm going to read the\ncomments now\nyeah thank you for sharing and um and\nthis is one thing I think about you guys\nif you aren't sure\nwhat spirituality means to you one thing\nthat you can start with is think about\nliterally like the best version of\nyourself that could exist you know the\nthere's a movie called every everywhere\neverything all at once I think that's a\nmovie that won like nine Awards this\nyear I love that movie because it talks\nabout how there's all these parallel\nuniverses and how all these different\nversions of ourselves could exist what\nthat means is with every action that you\ntake whether it's a micro action or a\nbig action\nit really changes the course of your\nlife\nand so\nimagine that there's a version of you\nlike the most Divine most best version\nof you that it could possibly exist\nif nothing else even if you're atheist\nor if you have your own God and you want\nto understand what that all means or how\nthis relates to spirituality one thing I\ndo is I constantly pray and ask and\nConverse with that version of me the\nbest version of me that somehow exists\nin the future the most Divine version of\nmyself\nfor me it's all about just connecting to\nthat connecting to who I can become if\nthere were parallel universes if there's\na frequency of myself that I can tune\ninto that is that version like I'm just\nreally trying to tune into that and\nconnect to that through meditation\nthrough prayer you're literally just\npraying for your highest self\nso it has nothing to do with religion\nGod anything you can they can coexist\nthey can exist separately or you don't\nhave to believe in religion it's\nactually not um it's not even that much\ncorrelated\num it's a separate thing because I think\nspirituality at least for me and you can\ncompletely you know interpret this in\nyour own way but it's about my\nrelationship to my higher self it's my\nrelationship to the world around me so\nit doesn't have to be about a God or\nanything and everything is gone yes\num\nI want to answer some of these questions\nwhy does kindness and forgiveness push\naway the feminine\nit's not the kindness and the\nForgiveness that's pushing away the\nfeminine\nit's the limiting belief that it is\nlisten like read this statement right\nhere it says why does that push away the\nfeminine you somewhere deep down believe\nthat by you being kind and forgiving\nyou're pushing away the feminine\ntherefore you're asking this question so\nthis isn't so much about your kindness\nor forgiveness that's actually getting\nin the way it's the thought itself that\nit is getting in the way that's getting\nin the way if that makes sense\nalso it's interesting that you said why\ndoes it push away the feminine not the\nmasculine or not people so I would be\nKeen to understand your relationship to\nthe feminine even if you don't know it\nright now there might be some resentment\nthere must might be some unhealed or\nparts of your relationship with the\nfamine that you get to actually forgive\nso in that way maybe you're not\nembodying forgiveness as much as you\nthink you are because\nwhy why are you grouping the feminine\nass someone or group of people or\nwhatever the energy that's against you\nso my question is what can you do to\nneutralize that and really forgive\nand I hope that helps\nand what else do you mind put pinning\nthe one where someone asked uh is it\nnormal to be numb to almost all of the\ntragic events that I have that happened\nin my life is it all right if I answer\nthat one\nyeah sure okay keep that one there um\nthe Alchemy I like I was thinking\nAlchemy as well so whoever wrote that\ngreen thumb I just want to address just\nreal quick Miss Jade I see is it normal\nto be numb\num\nnormal is again something you just\ndifferent different depending on who you\nask but\nit is expected to a degree that if you\ngo through so much pain your nervous\nsystem can't handle it your brain\nliterally will try to protect you I'm\nsure you guys maybe have heard those for\num\nthe four responses right so you have\nfreeze and you you just kind of stop in\nyour tracks you have fight which you\nwant to fight people flee which is when\nyou run away and there's fun which is\nwhen you try to win the other side over\nthat's like a whole other topic but in\nthe case where like imagine you're a kid\nimagine your kids stuck in a really\nscary situation you're really small\nand you're not strong enough to fight\noff the bad people like let's just say\nthere's like a scary monster you can't\nfight them off you can't run away you're\nstuck in the room so the last thing you\nhave left is freeze and you kind of just\ngo into yourself their brain is actually\nable to withdraw into itself and you get\nyou get locked inside of like a little\nroom in your own head where it's not\npainful anymore so no matter what\nhappens to you out here\nit doesn't matter because you've just\nlocked yourself away and to a degree\num I also have seen I think way earlier\nin the comments\num that's a little bit why people\nself-harm and again I'm not afraid to\ntalk about these things out loud in this\nspace it's a safe container and talking\nabout these things\nlessens the stigma but when you feel so\nnumb sometimes you want to know that\nyou're still human or that you're still\nalive and\nself-harming can be a part of that\nthere's actually like um\njust to get a little bit more sciency\nyou can actually when it gets so bad\nwhen you self-harm your brain will\nnaturally release opioids which is\num\npain relief your brain can create its\nown pain relief so yes basically\nuh it is possible for you to feel super\nnumb and it's just like a block so\nno one likes being constipated it's a\nlittle bit like being emotionally\nconstipated\nand it's hard how do you stop being\nconstipated that's a whole other topic\nbut I just wanted to address and\nvalidate it's okay if you're feeling\nnumb\num life is really hard to put an\nunderstatement and there's we experience\nso much pain sometimes we just can't\ntake it anymore\nso\nanyway and I wanna I wanna end I want to\nyou know add this in because\nthere's two aspects of this first of all\nI think it's really powerful to be\npresent with what you're feeling\num and this is what therapy is amazing\nfor right and sharing in these kind of\nways\nwhat's real to you what's true to you\nthat's all powerful\nI've actually helped people my own\nclients who've had self-harming\nTendencies and they stopped\nand that's possible the truth is though\na lot of y'alls who might be\nself-harming\nyou're present to it you're stuck in the\nstory that it's helping you\nbut I will also want to challenge you\nwith so much love\nwho would you be without story\nare you committed to being\nthat person even though it's no longer\nserving you\nand can you maybe play into the\npossibility\nthat you were just you not the story of\nyou are this person who self-harms\nwithout making it bad without making it\ngood just being like well who is who am\nI if that part of my identity no longer\nexisted\nbecause there's like this escalation of\ncommitment that happens\nwhere we would rather hold on to our old\nidentity\neven if it doesn't serve us just because\nit's comfortable how many years months\ndays have you been telling yourself I am\nthis person who self-harms and then all\nthe input that you get and then your\nreaction and all the things that you get\nfrom that\nyou've created a system it's a\nself-soothing system so I acknowledge\nyou for creating something however\nsometimes we get to look at our habits\nand negative thinking self-harming is\nalso\na habit\nand I say that with love because once\nyou can see that you have a choice\nthat's when you can turn that into power\nyou have to be able to imagine yourself\nas a new identity\nthis is and this is what I can do this\nis my superpower when I saw Melody\nwe're not even saw Tai from psychico or\na lot of my clients I can immediately\nsee\nthat new identity for them with all the\nthings that they want and more\nso for me I'm not of course I have\nexercises that work on these microshifts\nbut really what I'm committed to\ncreating is a new identity for my\nclients and this is also available for\nyou guys if you really let this land I\npromise There's an opportunity for you\nto shift\nwho are you without the thing the pain\nthe story around the pain like just\nimagine for a moment and it's weird\nbecause sometimes I feel this too\nsometimes I'm like in a bad mood and I\nhave to really challenge myself and then\nlike be an observer I know we talked\nabout books on Melody one of the books\nthat we love is an untethered Soul by\nMichael Singer and he talks about this\nbeing an observer of yourself being an\nobserver over your Consciousness and\nyour emotions when you see this you'll\nsee that there's like this weird\nattachment\nof you wanting to stay mad you wanting\nto stay angry you're wanting to stay\nresentful you're wanting to stay even\nguilty or shameful like it's weird but\nif you can really see that part of you\nand be like oh that's there\nwhat would it feel like if I didn't feel\ncommitted to feeling that way and like\njust let go for a bit\nwhy do I have such resistance about\nletting go about being mad\nand when you can really start to like\nnotice these different parts of you\nand say okay I'm gonna just try on this\nidentity who is not mad ever\nand your mind is immediately going to be\nlike well that's human existence do you\nhave like you can't be perfect you can\nfeel you know good all the time\nokay yeah but we can strive for it why\nnot\nand\nif that isn't inevitable why commit to\nfeeling that when you don't have to\nI think there's also time and place for\nyou to be present with what you're\nfeeling and let that move through you\nand be patient I'm not talking about\nthose signs I'm talking about the times\nthat you know that that time has expired\ndeep down you know that you being\nharmful to yourself is no longer serving\nyou\nyour family your friends anyone around\nyou and it's time for you to shift do\nsomething different to love yourself\nin those moments I invite you guys to be\ncourageous because when we talk about\nturning power or I'm sorry turning pain\ninto Power there's one thing I mean two\nthings actually I'll say that is\nabsolutely necessary for that to happen\none is courage\nit takes courage to say I don't want to\nresonate with this person who self-harms\nanymore that is not me anymore\nI don't want to label myself as someone\nwho's mad angry sad all the time anymore\nand then it takes kind of commitment to\nthis new identity\nyou know one thing I saw on you melody\nI saw your commitment to be a leader\nthat identity shifted for you massively\nand that really changed for you right\nso\nyou did I might want to think about that\nnew part of your identity\nand this is going to be a little bit\nchallenging if you've been living in the\nsurvival mindset for so long in the\nfight flight you know flea Fawn state\nfor so long but I really challenge you\nto think about this and this can change\nyour life if you let it\nwhat is that one new part of your\nidentity that you're willing to commit\nto\nfor Melody she committed to meditating\nevery day she committed to working out\nevery day this is their new identity\nemerging\nevery day it's through these everyday\nhabits\nso for you guys what is that one thing\ndo you want to be smart okay then how\nmany books do you commit to reading do\nyou want to identify as someone who has\novercome the challenges okay then what\nis the new identity like like what is\nshe or he or like what are they like are\nthey are they\nhappier do they smile more these are\nlittle things we can do every day\njust to tune into who we're becoming\nso I want you guys to remember that\nthere I want you to remember or think\nabout what do you get to be courageous\nabout right now today and what do you\nget to commit to in your daily\nbasis so that you can actually shift\nyour identity to something else\nso\nthat's what I wanted to share because\nit's good it's good to validate it's\ngood to have a safe place and now that\nwe've determined that this is a safe\nplace I also want to powerfully remind\nyou guys that you don't have to stay\nthere you don't have to feel bad all the\ntime\nthis life I mean look around you guys\nlike I am in awe every single morning I\nwake up and say holy moly whether\nthere's a Creator or God or whatever Big\nBang or whatever you believe in or not\nlike how is it that all of these things\nwere created it's absolutely amazing\nlook at the flowers like the perfect\nlittle petals look at these bugs\nhow do they like lay eggs and like I\nmean all these things are actually\nmiraculous Einstein said this they\neither look at life as if nothing's a\nmiracle or everything's a miracle that's\nabsolutely\nso anyway yeah no go ahead Lily\nso thank you for being here you guys\nknow some of y'alls are leaving\num it's amazing to have you guys here\nand Melody what what do you have to add\ntoday\noh tell us about what you've created\nthis is\nyes um I just wanted to touch I think\nthere's so many so many topics that\nyou've touched on that are we could\ntotally expand on so unfortunately\nI wish wish we had more time but um I\nsee you guys as well sharing as always\nand I I resonate a lot I think the one\nthing I wanted to fixate on that you out\nof the many great things that you shared\nis you know um\nshaping the new identity\nand I think\na piece of that is\nLetting Go which we've talked about a\nlittle bit as well\num releasing of the past right we can't\nlike for example if your identity is I\nhurt myself and I want to be\nhonest with you guys I\nused to hit my head a lot like BBD BPD\nVibes you know when you're like really\nmad you don't know how to handle it but\nI'm like I can't hurt other people so\nI'm just gonna hit myself like that's\nyeah she crazy yes I get it it's all\ngood but\num when that's your identity\nsometimes you just realize you don't\nwant to be that anymore and you have to\nlet go and it's not that easy right and\nit's easier said than done\nI get that\num it also takes time\num\nI've been on a journey for the last two\nyears I'm still not where I want to be\nbut I just want to share about letting\ngo uh releasing of the past\nmaking room\nfor new things and that's why I have\nthis plant and I also want to share with\nyou guys why is my hair short\nwell let me tell you I\nshaved my head in October\nso there's like there's like people\nwondering like why is there a trend of\ngirls shaving their heads well it's kind\nof you know they say that hair holds\nmemory I'm not telling you guys to go\nshave your head and then that's going to\nsolve your problems it's not okay but\nfor me I'm very expressive about what\nI'm moving through\nwith my appearance and I think that's a\nbeautiful thing about\num Beauty and Fashion as well by the way\nfor like also feminine folk\num but I shaved my head and now my hair\nis growing back and I feel like a new\nidentity is growing with my hair and\neven this plant I came into this little\nAirbnb space and these plants were dying\nI had lots of dead leaves on this little\ndude\nbut\nI saw that it just needed a little help\nand I took off all

recommendation so I\nhave two book racks and also Yuri has\ntwo book racks in our one of our books\ncoincide but my book recommendation to\nall of you guys\num\nis the untethered soul I just finished\nreading it yesterday and it's a lot\nabout if you I know a lot of psych2goers\nyou guys are\nobviously watching this like to go\nvideos because you want to know more\nabout yourself and that's introspection\nthis in the untethered soul is about\nlooking inwards and about observing\nthose negative thoughts and realizing\nthat they're just like clouds\noh that one looks like a\nhorse\nand then it passes you get to attach to\nthem they get stuck right and then you\nget it's painful sometimes the clouds\nare not nice either they have like\nthunder clouds right okay anyways I'm\ngoing on a ramble that's my first book\nrecommendation and\num I also want to recommend Yuri's book\nwhich is creating true happiness I read\nit last year when she gave it to me\num I find that she has a lot of really\nif you like again introspecting there\nshe is\num there are a lot of really powerful\nprops that she walks you through each\nchapter and um\nit was helpful for me so I dog dog-eared\na lot of them because I want to come\nback to those questions revisit them\nbut those are my two book\nrecommendations for all of you guys to\nleave you with something\num there will be a link eventually\nsomewhere to starfish but\nbooks are powerful you know you can\nreread them and journal prompts are even\nbetter and you can share them with your\nfriends so I don't know\ndo you have Book Rack Siri\nyeah\num\none of them I would say\nseven spiritual laws of success by\nDeepak Chopra that was a book that\nreally changed my life\num the direction of my life I mean I've\nread many many books untether soul is\none of I wonder did I recommend that\nbook to you anyway it's a powerful book\num I love that book as well the seven\nseven spiritual laws of success is a\nvery simple book\noh and actually one more\nobviously my book I love my book if you\nguys want to learn a little bit more\nabout my stories there's a lot of\njournaling prompts here\num\nstories of other people\nuh a lot of the intimate moments that\nI've had you know some people are asking\nlike how did you let go of your grief\nand you know sense of loss around your\nloved ones I talk about all that\num\nso that's one but um also\nuh what book was I gonna say here's the\ntop of my turn there's another book I\nwas gonna say oh oh The Alchemist since\nwe're talking about turning\npain into Power The Alchemist is a\nreally powerful book that's also very\neasy read but also one of those books\nthat you read and every single time you\nget something new out of it by Paula\ncuello that's a
