    "transcript": "was there ever a time where you felt a\nspark with someone you were talking to\nmaybe it was a blind date or someone\nyou've met in a bar but it felt like\nthere was a connection or maybe you felt\na spark while reading a romance novel\nand so you're curious about in-person\nsexual attention sexual attention is\nwhen we feel sexual attraction or\nchemistry with someone but don't have\nsex either right away or ever our brains\ncan often judge how we feel about\nsomeone quickly a 2015 University of\nPennsylvania study of over 10 000\nparticipants found that most people make\ntheir decisions about attractiveness\nwithin the first three seconds of\nmeeting someone and considering our\nbodies respond to the signals our brains\nsend out we might notice some signs of\nAttraction and sexual attention between\nus and our Person of Interest\nnow with all aspects of sex and sexual\nattraction it's important to be aware\nthat some signs of sexual attention can\nbe misread what you might think of is\nawkward but fun flirting might be\nsomeone else's I'm feeling uncomfortable\nso go slowly with these things and be\ncareful about reading the signs here are\nnine signs you might be experiencing\nsexual attention number one attraction\nthe first and very obvious sign of\nsexual tension is attraction we can feel\na connection with a new person that\nisn't sexual at all so a big difference\nbetween a friendly connection and a\nromantic one is the Attraction part so\nyour first question to tell if what\nyou're feeling is sexual tension is to\nask yourself am I attracted to this\nperson do you find yourself checking\nthem out remember our brains know these\nthings sometimes before we realize it\ntake a moment to think about how you\nfeel about your new interest it's a good\nway to get in touch with your own\nthoughts and feelings before you go\nfurther you might not be able to tell if\nyou're special someone feels the same\nbut maybe with some of these other signs\nyou can get a better idea\ntwo awkwardness this isn't always\npresent but sometimes if we're attracted\nto someone and still figuring out our\nown thoughts and feelings about them we\nmight feel awkward\nwe might be too busy thinking about the\nright thing to say or we just keep quiet\nto make sure we don't say the wrong\nthing this can lead to a bit of\nawkwardness until we're a little more\nsure of ourselves than the other person\nbut it's important to remember that\nawkwardness can also be a sign of other\nthings such as shyness so while awkward\nconversations can be a sign of sexual\nattention it shouldn't be the only way\nto judge it number three immediate\nconnection\non the complete opposite side of\nawkwardness you might both feel an\nintense and instant connection to one\nanother\nyou've probably heard people describe\nthe feeling of having known this person\nfor a long time despite having just met\nyou might feel that same sense of\nconnection as you talk to them\nthis chemistry the way you two just seem\nto click could indicate a level of\nattraction or sexual attention\nnumber four similarities you might have\nheard that Opposites Attract but in some\ncases of Attraction like attracts like\nso in addition to an immediate\nconnection you might also notice that\nyou and them share a lot of similar\nfeatures this could include shared\ninterests Hobbies or goals but it might\nalso include having similar physical\nfeatures as well such as the same hair\nor eye color scientists call this\nassortive mating where we Bond or\nconnect with people based on\nsimilarities we can observe so it's\npossible that those similarities you're\nrecognizing might be a piece of\nAttraction and it could be contributing\nto that immediate connection you're\nhopefully both feeling\nnumber five Speedy heart and sweaty\nPalms we usually tell kids that\nbutterflies in the stomach mean we like\nsomeone that's not far off do you notice\nyour heart starts racing more around\nthat special someone or do you notice\nyour palms start to get a little sweaty\nthese are usually signs of Attraction\nbut in a 2022 study that set men and\nwomen up on blind dates it found that\nthose who were mutually attracted to one\nanother experienced heart rates and\nsweaty Palms that increase and decreased\nat the same time why does this happen\nwell it could be because attraction is\noften caused by hormones like adrenaline\nand narpinephrine getting ramped up\nwhich leads us to getting excited hence\nthe racing hearts and sweaty Palms so if\nyou and your partner are both noticing\nthese signs you might be feeling a touch\nof sexual tension number six\ntouch that excites both of you are you\nboth feeling a little touchy no I don't\nmean you're feeling grumpy but are you\nboth finding little ways to touch each\nother\nthis could be the brush of a hand or a\nlight touch on the arm or even leaning\ncloser to one another when talking if\nyou're hugging you might notice that you\nboth hang on a little longer than you\nwould with others when we find someone\nattractive we want to get closer to them\nand one of the ways we do that is\nthrough touch but the touches are\nusually ones that affect both of you\nyou're both feeling some level of\nexcitement from them so if you're\nfinding that both of you are touching\neach other slightly more that may be a\nsign that you're both experiencing\nsexual tension\nnumber seven you enjoy one another's\ncompany\ndo you both find that you can't get\nenough of one another you can talk for\nhours and hours and still not be tired\nof each other maybe you realize you feel\nimmediately comfortable with each other\nor you both feel secure in each other's\ncompany and you might even be a little\nworried that when you both separate for\nthe evening you'll miss the conversation\nor feel like you even missed an\nopportunity\nsure some of these signs can also mean\nyou're experiencing a friendly\nconnection but when you combine it with\nthe Attraction part it's usually a good\nindicator that sexual tension is\noccurring eight your conversations are\nvery flirty while you're enjoying your\nendless conversations you might also be\nfinding your talk is a little\nflirtatious are some dirty jokes coming\nup does complimenting each other come\nnaturally and are you finding you're\nboth bouncing off each other in the same\nplayful way if so this may be a good\nsign you're both feeling sexual tension\nbut if you're finding you're a bit alone\non the flirts don't be too pushy there's\nnothing that'll kill sexual attention\nquicker than trying to force the\nconnection and number nine you continue\nthinking about them after you've\nseparated\na big sign you're feeling sexual\nattention is that they're still on your\nmind even after you've been separated\nfor a bit are you constantly thinking\nabout your conversations or how good\nthey looked in their outfit or maybe\nyou're trying to figure out what your\nnext conversation will be perhaps you're\nalso thinking about when you'll see them\nnext if you continue to think about them\nno matter how much time you've spent\ntogether you might be experiencing some\nattraction\nif you find out the other person is\nfeeling the same that's probably a good\nindication you're both feeling sexual\ntension\nnavigating the world of dating and sex\ncan sometimes be a challenging thing\nwhat we think is a sign of Attraction\ncan be someone else's shyness or even\ndiscomfort it's important to remember\nthat even using these signs it needs to\nbe felt on both ends and while we can't\nalways tell what someone else is feeling\nit's good to understand our own feelings\nabout someone else sexual tension can be\na fun and exciting start to something\nmore meaningful but only if for sure\nboth people are feeling that same pull\nhave you ever had a time where you\nexperience sexual attention with someone\nelse let us know in the comments below\nthanks for watching and don't forget to\nlike And subscribe for more\nforeign"
