    "transcript": "you've seen the Trope of all perhaps the\nBroody Brilliance of Sherlock Holmes or\nmaybe the earnest but awkward Genius of\nPeter Parker the frequent depiction of\nthe intelligent person as being separate\nand alone sometimes not by choice when\npeople think of intelligence one of the\nbiggest stereotypes is that smart people\ntend to be Learners while not every\nintelligent person is like this in fact\nmany are very popular there is some\ntruth to this intelligent brains operate\ndifferently so to understand this better\nwe'll explore why intelligent people are\nmore lonely they don't fit in having a\nhigh level of intelligence can make\nsomeone an outcast intelligent people\nspend a lot of time in the inner World\nwhich can come across as detached and\naloof they often have ideas that can\ncome across as confusing or boring to\ntheir peers making it difficult to find\ncommon ground this can make them more\nawkward in conversation the things that\nthey say and do are eccentric and odd\nthat two others may just seem wrong an\narticle by the supporting emotional\nneeds of the gifted organization brings\nup the idea of over-excitabilities which\nare sensitivities and needs in specific\nareas and in select actual over\nexcitability can lead to intelligent\npeople craving conversations that are\nabstract and idea Centric which can be\ndifficult to get out of people they may\nnot get the same stimulation out of\ngossip as they would talking about\nphilosophical ideas art or something\nthat they're passionate about\nintelligent people need lots of\nstimulation intelligent people often\nneed an extra challenge whether it's\npersonally academically or socially for\nexample they may be more emotional\nenergetic and have a Wilder curiosity\nabout the world around them than others\nwhile this makes him stand out it's also\na cause for a lot of misunderstanding\nthe psychologist Valeria sabera states\nthat intelligent people may actually\nsuffer from poor grades in school this\nis often because the work isn't\nstimulating enough but without context\nit can bring them labels like lazy\ndifficult or in some situations dumb\nwhen in reality they are not in a\nsituation where they can grow and in\nother scenarios they may be perceived as\ncold or intimidating even though that's\nnot the truth these misunderstandings\ncan create unnecessary labels or stigma\nmaking the person feel bad about\nthemselves high levels of empathy people\nwith high intelligence often have a\ngreat deal of empathy towards others\nwhich can make things challenging\ntragedies in the world can hurt them and\nproblems with other people can impact\ntheir well-being too another\nover-excitability from the same\norganization deals with emotionality and\nempathy having a high level of empathy\nmakes it difficult when dealing with\npeople and their issues so people like\nthis often will need more time to\nthemselves similarly news events and\nethical problems can Aid in bringing\nthese people down causing them to unplug\nwhile intelligent people may seem cold\nand distant really they feel so much\nthat they need time to themselves to\nprocess too much self-isolation can lead\nto loneliness along with the stigma that\ntheir recharge time makes them appear\ncold\ntheir brains process information\ndifferently those who are highly\nintelligent think differently from the\npeople around them while this can make\nit hard to fit in and can be easy to\nmisunderstand there's more to it being\nable to process and form ideas quickly\nmay cause them to ramble about things\nthat might not make sense to others a\npsychologist Valeria sabata states that\na highly intelligent person's brain can\nbounce so many ideas off a single\nstimuli that their ideas may not be\nentirely coherent to others or\nnecessarily accurate what makes sense to\nthem might be difficult to explain to\nother people which can create challenges\nlike offending someone when they don't\nmean to an article from the school of\nlife gives an explanation that the out\nthere and radical ideas that intelligent\npeople may have can offend others\nunintentionally furthering their\nalienation thinking differently affects\nhow they view the world and how the\nWorld Views them\nintelligent people have different brains\nwhich can lead to great things but also\nbe alienating having difficulties\nfitting in building connections finding\nchallenges and emotionality can make\nfinding your place difficult it's not\nimpossible however getting involved in\nactivities whether in your community or\nonline with people that share your\ninterests is a great way to build\nrelationships the world is a big place\nand now is an easier time than ever to\nget connected we hope this video has\nhelped explain some ways that\nintelligent people can feel lonely or\ndifferent from others what have
