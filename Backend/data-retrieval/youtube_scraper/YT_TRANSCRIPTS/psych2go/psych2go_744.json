    "transcript": "hey sector goers do you wonder why some\npeople act manipulative even though they\nseem like a kind person being\nmanipulative can come from environmental\nfactors for example if you were raised\nin a highly competitive environment with\nlittle to no room for steady growth and\naffirmation you would likely resort to\nunderhanded acts and mind games to get\nwhat you want chances are you have good\nintentions in mind manipulation usually\nbecomes your survival tactic when you're\nnot acquainted with healthy ways to\ncommunicate with others in today's video\nwe will be discussing six signs that\nyou're unintentionally manipulative\nalong with some tips to help number one\nyou tweak fact or events to your\nadvantage when you're retelling an event\nto someone do you notice yourself\nleaving out parts or twisting events\nbecause the original version doesn't fit\nyour narrative\nthis is a form of manipulation you're\nprobably twisting facts because you want\nthe other person to go along with your\nside of the story you probably don't\nwant to be in the wrong because it puts\nyou in a vulnerable position and may\neven change others opinions of you\nshould try to catch yourself next time\nyou're changing the facts of a story\nit's not easy to change something you're\nused to doing but the important thing is\nthat you've recognized it after a while\nyou'll probably notice it more and more\nand give yourself chances to choose a\nbetter option number two you've\nunknowingly mastered the blame game\ndo you always try to point out other\npeople's mistakes playing the victim\noften ends up with more problems than\nSolutions it can Brew anger start fights\nand even end relationships it's good to\nhold someone accountable for their\nactions but when it looks like it's\nalways them who's wrong there may be an\nissue before pointing fingers at who's\nwrong try considering their side first\nmistakes will always be mistakes but by\nconsidering their perspective you're\nlearning to look at things with a more\nopen less judgmental mind also when\nyou're the wrong one the best thing to\ndo is just accept it do your best not to\nblame others it'll just repeat the cycle\nand complicate things mistakes are\nlessons and each one is an opportunity\nto grow\nnumber three your go-to line is I\npromise do you have a habit of making\npromises and shrugging them off later on\npromises bear weight it requires a\ndegree of responsibility to uphold it's\nbasically a personal agreement or an\nUnwritten contract that when broken puts\nthe trust between you and another person\nat risk so when you have a habit of\nmaking promises and end up breaking or\nforgetting them there's a high chance\nthat you're leading on and hurting the\nother person remember that you don't\nhave to make promises especially if you\ndon't think you can keep them if you\nnotice that it's difficult for you to\nstick to a problem that's okay trying\nyour best improving yourself through\nactions is always much better than false\nwords and hope number four you do good\nthings for others while expecting them\nto return the favor\nhave you ever been super kind to someone\nbecause of an ulterior motive in mind if\nthe answer is yes don't beat yourself up\ntoo much plenty of us have also been\nthere now the issue arrives when you're\ndoing everything just for the benefits\nwhen you're being nice to someone or\ngiving them gifts because you want to\ngain something in return that's already\nmanipulation plus it can greatly hurt\ntheir feelings if they find out it's why\nyou are kind to them in the first place\nit causes hurt and confusion when you're\napplying the same method to genuine\npeople with pure intentions being\nstrategic and having good people skills\ncan get you far but sometimes putting\nother people first with no underlying\nmotives can help them and you immensely\nit's good to be selfless sometimes\nnumber five you tend to exaggerate are\nyou the type of person who tends to\nspeak in hyperbole do you exaggerate\nfacts to the point where they seem more\nextreme than the actual truth for\nexample you have a friend who borrowed\nsome money from you and forgot to pay it\nback because you're angry you tell the\nother friends about the issue and\ninstead of saying the original amount of\nmoney borrowed you declare a bigger one\nthis can cause conflict among you and\nother people if your main intention is\nto persuade it's always better to relay\naccurate information first before\nsharing your own opinion not adjusting\nthe whole story itself to fit your\nnarrative\nthat way you're being honest and open\nabout how you feel and number six\neverything always seems to go your way\ndo you notice that nobody seeks to\ncontradict you anymore is everyone\nfollowing what you want even if they\nclearly prefer something else when\neveryone appears to be subservient to\nyour every wish it probably means that\nyou've gotten the hang of manipulating\nthem or they've grown tired of it you\nmay not notice it but you probably\ndisplay manipulative behavior when\nthings don't go your way the people\naround you may be trying their best not\nto let that happen by going along with\nwhatever you want often you\nunconsciously resort to these acts\nbecause you don't know how to\ncommunicate your needs properly\ndirect communication is highly important\nand it's good to accept that not all\nthings will go your way sometimes do you\nsee yourself in any of these signs if so\nthen please take this as a reminder to\nnot let guilt get the best of you every\nhuman is prone to being manipulative\nyou're already an amazing person for\neducating yourself on this topic it\nshows that you have a better healthier\nroad ahead of you once you take the\ninitiative to build better habits the\nfirst step is to recognize this behavior\nand then make peace with it identify why\nyou act the way you act and be gentle\nwith yourself as you take small steps in\nhealing it's never easy to face negative\naspects about yourself but there's no\ndoubt that you can do it and come out a\nbetter person than yesterday thanks for\nlistening see you next time"
