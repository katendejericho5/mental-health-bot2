questions you might think\nyou're an introvert you might be wrong\nif the thought of social interaction\nmakes your heart race and your palms\nsweat this could be a sign of social\nanxiety disorder according to the UK's\nNational collaborating Center for Mental\nHealth social anxiety is\nthe persistent fear of one or more\nsocial situations where embarrassment\nmay occur and the fear or anxiety is out\nof proportion to the actual threat posed\nby the social situation as determined by\nthe person's cultural norms how can you\ntell if you're an introvert or if you're\nsocially anxious here are five signs it\nmight be social anxiety\nit's ego dystonic do you actually enjoy\nbeing alone in a 2020 interview clinical\npsychologist Dr Romani durvasula points\nout that introversion is ego synthonic\nthis means introverts enjoy being alone\nand recharge this way rather than going\nout to blow off some steam\nsocial anxiety on the other hand is\negotistonic meaning it's out of touch\nwith your preferences many people with\nsocial anxiety are actually extroverts\nwho love the company of others but they\nisolate themselves out of fear which\nmakes them miserable Dr durvasulo\nsummarizes the differences with this\nbeautiful quote\nintroversion is your way social phobia\nis in your way\nlet's say your friends invite you to\nhang out at the mall if you're an\nintrovert you might decline because you\ntruly prefer to relax alone after you\ndecline you also don't worry about what\nthey think of that\nif you have social anxiety you might\nfeel compelled to decline even though\nyou want to go out being around your\nfriends makes you feel like Piglet from\nWinnie the Pooh your anxiety may have\nyou convinced they secretly hate you or\nthat you need to watch your every move\nso that your fear outweighs your desire\nto hang out\nnow you're home wishing you could be\noutside with closed blinds and a phone\non airplane mode this is not\nintroversion\nall eyes are on you\ndo you worry that others talk about you\nbehind your back a lot according to the\nNational collaborating Center for mental\nhealth people with social anxiety are\nconstantly on the lookout for negative\njudgment embarrassment or humiliation\nit's natural to wonder what others might\nthink about you but not if it's a\nconstant and overwhelming worry\nthese worries aren't just small doubts\nbut often full-blown anxiety attacks a\nstudy by Temple University investigated\nthe causes of social anxiety and found\nthat the distress was as intense as\npost-traumatic stress syndrome let's say\nyou're stuck in a dinner party\nconversation if you're an introvert this\nmight be your own personal torture your\ninner monologue might sound like how can\nanyone enjoy these boring conversations\nhow long do I have to smile and Nod when\ncan I leave and go home to do something\nenjoyable\nbut if it's social anxiety you might\nfeel like you're being buried under an\navalanche and your inner monologue might\nsound more like am I sweating can\neveryone tell how nervous I am do I look\nstupid did I say something dumb over and\nover again your inner monologue can be a\ngreat clue as to whether you're\nintroverted or have social anxiety\nthinking at light speed contrary to\npopular belief social anxiety is not\njust about large events like\nperformances or public speaking these\nthings would make most people anxious\nsocial anxiety therapist Arlen kuncik\nnotes that social anxiety torments\npeople during smaller events like\nanswering the phone buying groceries or\ngetting a haircut it's not just about\nhow large the interaction is it happens\nanytime others are around let's say you\ngot some lunch at the food court and you\nneed to walk across the room to get to\nan empty table as you walk you might be\nwondering if everyone is staring\nchanting not to trip in your head\nquestioning if you look cool or asking\nyourself if they can tell you're nervous\nall the while you feel your brain has\nbeen hijacked by fear from inside out\nyou suspect it's not normal to be shaken\nby such a small thing and you're right a\nneuroimaging study by the West China\nHospital of Sichuan University showed\nthat the amygdala the part of the brain\nthat regulates stress as an overactive\nand debilitating fear response in those\nwith social anxiety so next time you're\noverthinking thank your amygdala\nthink think and think some more how much\npreparation do you put into social\ninteractions do you rehearse it like a\nperformance do you wonder about all the\nways that you could fail before it\nhappens\nstudies published in the Journal of\nabnormal psychology and the\nTransylvanian Journal of Psychology\nshowed that social anxiety traps you in\nan inescapable Whirlwind of anxious\nthoughts for weeks before an anticipated\nevent in even weeks afterward let's say\nyou want to call to order a pizza\ninstead of just calling you rehearse for\nhalf an hour practicing every word to\nmake sure you don't mess up\nafter you finally muster the courage and\nmake the call you reflect on the entire\nconversation over and over in your mind\nyou stay up at night wondering if you\nmade any mistake with thoughts like\nwhy did the other person pause after I\nspoke did they think my question
