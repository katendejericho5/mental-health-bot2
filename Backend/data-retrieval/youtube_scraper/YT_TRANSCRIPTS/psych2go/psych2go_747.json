of helplessness and\ndistress if you have experienced any of\nthe behaviors above know that there's\nalways room for growth and using the\nopportunity to grow for the better is\nthe first step to getting there we all\nhave a fair amount of flaws and\nstruggles some weaknesses we can see\nright before our eyes while others\nunveil themselves when we least expect\nthem all you need is to know when to\nwatch for the signs and recognize\nunhelpful behaviors or thoughts you may\nbe having you deserve to love and be the\nbest version"
