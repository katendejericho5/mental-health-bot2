    "transcript": "when you think of a toxic friend or peer\nwhat's the first thought that comes to\nmind is it someone who gossips\nfrequently maybe someone who's bossy and\na nightmare to work with well what about\nmachiavellianism\nmachiavellianism refers to a personality\ntrait that is characterized by an\nability to be extremely manipulative\ndeceitful and cunning as a means to\nachieve one's goals such as power and\nstaff\nand it's one of the three tenets of the\ndark Triad which includes narcissism and\npsychopathy individuals with a\nMachiavellian personality profile can be\nincredibly manipulative put it this way\nif someone with the Machiavellian trait\nwas a soul Reaper manipulation is their\nzampa Kudo as a matter of fact there are\nmany clear-cut examples of this type of\npersonality in movies and television\nsuch as Frank Underwood from House of\nCards the ambitious and conniving\npolitician who stops at nothing to\nachieve his goals and further his\npolitical career then who can forget\nWalter White from the show Breaking Bad\nthe embattled anti-hero and drug kingpin\nwho ruthlessly destroys anyone who gets\nin his way\nsounds kind of scary right well although\nthese are extreme examples Machiavellian\nindividuals definitely exist and they\ncan make any setting toxic these four\nsigns can help you figure out if you\nhave a peer or friend with the\nMachiavellian quality but let's dive\nright into the signs number one\nexcessive gossip\nhave you ever met someone who seems to\nbeam with joy when speaking negatively\nabout others\ngossip is a predictable and inevitable\naspect of life and it's not abnormal for\nsomeone to gossip occasionally however\ngossiping becomes very dangerous and\ntoxic when taken to the extreme such as\nstarting vicious rumors and using others\nto obtain personal information that\ncould be damaging to their reputation\nindividuals with the Machiavellian trait\ntend to weaponize any information that\ncomes their way and have a talent for\nmanipulating harmless statements into\nsomething that conveniently fits their\nnarrative so be extremely careful and\ntread with caution when saying anything\nto them\nnumber two highly competitive possessing\na strong sense of ambition is generally\nsomething positive and admirable in\nwhich it is there's nothing wrong with\nbeing competitive however when a person\nis so competitive that they're willing\nto compromise their own values and hurt\nother people to achieve their goals\nthat's when it becomes toxic according\nto Professor Mariana bakarova PhD people\nwho would score highly when being tested\nfor machiavellianism for instance are\nvery motivated by money power and\ncompetition and winning unless so on\ncommunity building so you can see why\nbullying would come easily for\nmachiavellians coercion and intimidation\nare just a few of the tactics that\nMachiavellian individuals use to gain\nleverage whether it's in school the\nworkplace or in social situations so if\nyou're seeing an almost ruthless\ncompetitive streak in one of your\nfriends peers or acquaintances this\ncould be a sign of machiavellianism\nnumber three\ninsincere flattery another prevalent\nbehavior of a Machiavellian individual\nis the use of insincere and excessive\nflattery especially to those in\npositions of power and influence take it\nfrom the queen be herself Regina George\nshe uses that oh my God where did you\nget that it's so cute line then turns\naround and bashes that same thing she\njust complimented\nlatter is can appear to be very charming\nand friendly but if the Machiavellian\ntrait is present then that flattery can\ncome with an ulterior motive social\npsychologists and authors of studies in\nmachiavellianism Richard Christie and\nFlorence gayes emphasize the fact that\nmachiavellians tend to use their\nrelationships for personal gain instead\nof a deep meaningful friendship they\nform weak superficial bonds with others\nthis way it's easier to pick up and put\ndown the Friendship when needed if you\nnotice your friend or acquaintance is\nconstantly showering a person of power\nor influence such as a teacher a boss or\neven a celebrity with gifts and\ncompliments but then proceeds to treat\neveryone else poorly this could be a\nsign of a Machiavellian trait and number\nfour manipulation this component is\nCentral to a machiavellian's cold and\ncalculated nature and can manifest in\nseveral different ways some examples of\ntheir manipulative tactics include\ntrying to generate sympathy from others\nthrough deceit turning others against\nsomeone else or even gaslighting\nprotecting ourselves from being\nmanipulated by these types of\nindividuals is vital and according to\nlicensed psychologist Diane Grant PhD\nthere are several ways you can avoid\nfalling prey to Mach rebellions such as\nsetting boundaries building supportive\nrelationships and avoiding trusting them\nwith any vulnerabilities\nso do you have a Machiavellian person in\nyour life how are you dealing with the\nsituation let us know in the comments if\nyou like this video be sure to hit the\nlike button and
