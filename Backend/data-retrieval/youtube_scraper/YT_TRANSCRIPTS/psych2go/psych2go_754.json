    "transcript": "are you feeling a bit out of sorts did\nyou go from On Top of the World to\nfeeling lost and wondering why am I\nstill like this\nwell you're not alone and this isn't\nabnormal it happens to the best of us so\nhere are some handholds and guideposts\nto help you get back to being you number\none step outside of the person you have\nbeen naturally when we say get back on\ntrack we don't mean go backwards and\ndon't change that's not helpful in fact\nbeing the person you were is what led\nyou to being stuck where you are now so\ntrying something a little different\nmaybe just the thing you need\nweird and scary as it sounds you've\nprobably already done it before I think\nI think of your younger self and all you\nlearn from your mistakes like the time\nyou learn that vanilla extract really\ndoes not taste like it smells\nyou learn to adapt and change your point\nof view\nlike smell and taste don't always match\na question you can ask yourself is while\nlooking at yourself from the outside\nwhat do I want out of this what do I\nwant out of me this may require you to\ncome out of your comfort zone but it\nwill be worth it unleash the latent\npotential hiding inside you and push the\nboundaries of what you can achieve\nnumber two be kind to yourself\nhumility is a good thing but don't go\noverboard having your inner monologue\nbecome a constant Rose Fest isn't\nhelpful to you all that self-blame and\nshame is acting as a blockade\ndealing with a mistake would stop at the\ninner scolding of you suck and doesn't\nallow for those next steps of\nrecognition and trusting yourself to\nlearn from it and do better\nself-compassion contributes to a wide\nrange of positive outcomes for our\nwell-being like interconnectedness with\nothers optimism and wisdom to name a few\nwhy it's because you can only access and\nlearn these things when you believe you\nare worthy of them number three let go\nof regrets the past is really the past\nit sounds cliche but that doesn't make\nit untrue unless you have your own\ntardis you can't change the past but you\nhave the choice of how to respond you\ncould keep up with the ruminations of\nwhat if which will only keep you awake\nat night and make your present full of\nanxiety and bitterness or you could\nacknowledge it understand its cause and\nyour role in it just learn and adapt\nthat incident is now a learning tool\nrather than a punishment instead of\nletting the past ruin your now or your\nfuture make it a part of your life's\nmural\nnumber four trust that you are in the\nright place at the right time Theodore\nRoosevelt had the right idea when he\nsaid comparison is the thief of Joy with\nthe rise of social media it is nearly\ndifficult to avoid social comparison\ntheir Instagram Tick Tock and Facebook\nposts distract us every time we look at\na screen you wonder why you're not doing\nwhat they're doing or why your life is\nbetter hang on you're trying to get your\nlife back on track not someone else's\ntrying to hitch on to someone else's\ntrack means working with incomplete\ntools that aren't yours it's okay to try\nnew things\nbut the final Masterpiece would be yours\nsince it's yours trust that you're at\nthe right place at the right moment for\nyou number five realize no one owns you\nsimilar to the previous point you have\nto live your own life yes it's great to\nbe aware of social norms and support\nfriends but if you find yourself taking\nthe extra mile to avoid being negatively\njudged by others like a puppet where\nyour own needs are negligible and other\npeople are dictating your every move\nthis is beyond social courtesy you've\nrelinquished your life to someone else\nas well-meaning as others might be only\nyou have the entirety of your story only\nyou can do what's right for you number\nsix never underestimate your strength to\nmove forward have you ever doubted your\nstrength to take another step forward\nit's all just too much when this happens\nyou can always look back at your life\nwhere similar issues have Arisen despite\nthe hardship you survived then so you\ncan do so now eventually the difficulty\nwill pass and you will look back at this\ntime and feel grateful and stronger for\ngetting through it\nnumber seven give up overthinking and\nworrying overthinking is when healthy\nunderstanding and knowledge overwhelms\neverything even the broader picture and\nlogic to get back on track it's\nimportant to make decisions and work\ntowards a goal but they're also the two\nthings you stop doing when you overthink\noverthinking creates a vicious cycle of\nworry that steals your peace it's\nbasically the hamster wheel of I hate my\nlife so stop the ride you want to get\noff doing so means doing things you\nenjoy and trying new things you can ask\nyourself what is my worrying doing to\nhelp the situation it may not be easy\nbut nothing good ever was baby steps my\nfriend try setting aside a small amount\nof time say 30 minutes every other day\nto explore new distractions or\nexperiment with existing ones at the\nvery least that's 30 solid minutes of\nnot worrying which is great getting back\ninto you is a process just like any\nother major project you'll feel like\nyou're making progress sometimes and\nregressing other times\nremember self-compassion and celebrate\nthe progress you achieve you may well\nfind that the you that emerges is\nsomeone even better than before\nand you have all your life experiences\nto thank for it do you resonate with any\nof these points\nfeel free to comment and discuss\nthanks for watching and see you soon"
