    "transcript": "sexual disorders\nthat is today's topic now the first\nthing some might think are sexually\ntransmitted diseases or other biological\nrelated issues but we're not teaching a\nhigh school sex ed class we're tackling\nthe taboo around sex and explaining what\na sexual disorder is and how they can\naffect your life so let's talk about a\nfew of the rare sexual disorders to arm\nyou with a little more knowledge to care\nfor yourself\nnumber one hypoactive sexual desire hype\nER means a lot to the point of maybe too\nmuch hype o means less than what's\nconsidered average\nhypoactive sexual desire is having very\nlow interest in sex that's how normal\nend healthy sex is with age it's normal\nto slow down and have times where sex\nisn't on the priority list but there is\nstill some activity happening hypoactive\nsexual desire which will shorten to hsd\nis when that non-interest is persistent\nand causes anxiety if you ignore it it\ncan cause friction in your romantic\nrelationship and even become disruptive\nhsdd is an absence of sexual interest\nnot a passing feeling so if someone's\nmeh with their partner but still gets\nhot and bothered looking at a\nfirefighter calendar\nnot hsdd biological factors such as\nhormonal imbalances and situational\nissues can cause hsdd but wait the good\nnews is that there is treatment talking\nto a healthcare professional can help\nfigure out what next steps need to be\ntaken number two post orgasmic illness\nsyndrome post-orgasmic illness syndrome\nor pois is an autoimmune disorder that\naffects those who produce semen think of\nit like allergies for those with\nseasonal allergies going outside is a\nterrible ordeal without having an\nantihistamine at hand the same goes for\npois after finishing sexy time flu-like\nsymptoms kick in those flu-like symptoms\nare an immune response if you have pois\nyour body treats the excreted semen like\nbacteria to make you sick and symptoms\nshow up nearly every single time it can\nlast up to a week after orgasm too\nunfortunately there isn't a cure for\npois however you can manage the symptoms\nby cleaning up the area after sexy time\nis over upon doctor approval intake of\nappropriate symptom dampening\nmedications may also be an appropriate\ntreatment number three\nsexual aversion disorder sexual aversion\ndisorder or sad is similar to hsdd but\nit's more extreme sad has six subtypes\nand based on the cause it can be mild or\nsevere so while hsdd is meh to have sex\nsexual aversion disorder turns that meth\ninto active fear of sex\nsphere manifests as constant rejection\nand active avoidance of all sexual\ncontact with their partner\nas bad as that sounds since it's a form\nof hsdd the same treatments can apply\nnumber four coitalsphalgia\nyou know what's normal to be felt after\nan orgasm\ngood things relaxation warmth sometimes\nlightness\nthat thing called the Afterglow\nno it's not normal a migraine\nunfortunately colloidal stefalga is just\nthat an orgasm so strong it gives you a\nmigraine not something to celebrate as\nstrange as it sounds sex causes stress\nbut it's not the kind of stress you're\nthinking about the kind that comes from\nspending too much time at the office\nwhen you orgasm there's a massive amount\nof oxytocin and dopamine being released\ninto your bloodstream that is why it\nfeels so good and can sometimes make you\nfeel really intense emotions however\npost-coitus your hormones lower but\ntheir effect on your body does not\ndiminish immediately high levels of\noxytocin like the ones released during\norgasm can tighten your blood vessels\nand eventually increase the pressure in\nyour head thus giving you a headache\ntypically men experience coitalsophagia\nbut it can affect some women too\nalthough it's kind of scary because the\nhead pain is pretty sudden it's not\nfatal treatment can include simply\ntaking regular migraine medication and\nexercising exercising can reduce the\nchance of vasoconstriction during\nphysical exertion number five retrograde\nejaculation no it doesn't have anything\nto do with Mercury being in retrograde\nthankfully we're done with that but for\nthose who do have retrograde ejaculation\nit might feel like the planet Mercury\nmight be at fault why\nbecause retrograde ejaculation means\nyour semen flows in the wrong direction\ncrazy right gravity or the tide of the\noceans having nothing to do with it\nsimply but the reason semen is slowing\nbackwards is because of your sphincter\nyour sphincter is a muscle located at\nthe neck of your bladder during coitus\nit tightens to prevent your semen from\nmixing with other fluids kind of like\ntraffic control under normal\ncircumstances it blocks flow in the\nbladder Lane and allows the sperm to\npass through the vas deferens prostate\nand urethra before exiting out of the\npenis with the retroactive ejaculation\nthe sphincter goes on a break and\neverything is left to sort itself out\nthe sperm flows where it wants and winds\nup at the bladder the sphincter is on a\nPerma break and those muscles don't\nclose so if semen takes the path of\nleast resistance up the neck of the\nbladder which is shorter although it's\nnot harmful and it doesn't affect your\nability to feel pleasure it can be\nawkward especially if you and your\npartner are trying to conceive if it has\nbecome a serious concern reach out to\nyour doctor to come up with a solution\nplan sex is a wonderful thing it would\ndo all of us a heap of good to know a\nlittle more about it if for nothing else\nto recognize when our health is\ncompromised bottom line if you've got\nquestions medical professionals have\nmany answers so reach out and get to\nknow more about this excellent aspect of\nlife we think you'd be super sexy if you\ntouched our like button by the way just\nsaying"
