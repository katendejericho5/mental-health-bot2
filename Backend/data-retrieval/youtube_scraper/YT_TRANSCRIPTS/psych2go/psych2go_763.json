is a highly\nintelligent Society whereby members are\nrequired to have an IQ of 130 and above\nthe researchers concluded that\nindividuals with high IQs are more\nlikely to suffer from mood and anxiety\ndisorders nearly 27 percent of Mensa\nmembers were reported to suffer from a\nmood disorder such as depression while\nanother 20 reported they were diagnosed\nwith anxiety disorder intellectuals were\nalso found to be 182 percent more likely\nto develop at least one mood disorder\nthan the average person so what are some\nof the reasons highly intelligent people\nare more likely to be depressed\nnumber one\noverthinking and over analyzing\naccording to the same 2018 research led\nby researcher Ruth karpinsky and her\ncolleagues intellectuals are likely to\nhave intellectual and psychological\noverexcitabilities Dr Nicole Tetro a\nco-author of the study explained in a\nsubset of the high IQ population a minor\ninsult such as a clothing tag or an\nunnatural sound May trigger a low-level\nchronic stress response which then\nactivates a hyper body response due to\nintellectuals hypersensitive and\nhyper-aware traits they are more likely\nto have their mind flooded with thoughts\nthey tend to overanalyze over worry and\nsometimes react more severely than an\naverage individual as they realize the\nseverity of each action and its\nconsequences as an example they may over\nanalyze comments from their boss\npossibly thinking of the worst outcome\nin their head regardless of the truth or\nin a social Gathering individuals with\nhigh IQ may have a hard time relaxing\nand enjoying the party as they're\nconcerned about themselves and their\nsurroundings such as whether their\nfriends are enjoying themselves\na highly intelligent person may dwell on\nquestions that the general population\nwouldn't worry about such as\nphilosophical questions\nas the saying goes ignorance is bliss\nbut your average person may not have\nthis extra weight these questions they\nPonder without proper social support\nindividuals with high IQs may end up in\nan endless tunnel of questions and\nnegative thoughts that could lead to\nanxiety helplessness and depression two\nhigh expectations according to Dr Leon F\nSeltzer in an article from Psychology\ntoday many highly intelligent\nindividuals realize their potential\ninabilities and with that they have\ngreat expectations of themselves they\ncan be rather hard on themselves and\nhave difficulties accepting and being\nsatisfied with their achievements it\nbecomes worse if the people around them\nhave the same high expectations and so\nintelligent people have a risk of\nfalling into a cycle of disappointment\nwhen they can't achieve the unrealistic\nstandards they've set\nthree two accustomed to easy success\nwhile it's different for everyone some\nwith a high IQ may just have an easier\ntime in school this may allow them to\ngrow up accustomed to easy success in\nschool as most schools grading systems\nrely on Concept in theory however\nsuccess in reality is not solely reliant\non intelligence it's a mix of\nintelligence skills practicality and\ncreativity\naccording to psychology today they grow\nup having it easy in school they may\nlack the perseverance to learn new\nskills outside of class and adapt to\ndifferent circumstances Dr Seltzer also\nmentions that intelligent people may not\nbeing accustomed to struggling to learn\nnew things when they're in situations\nthat demand they exert themselves so\nthey can procrastinate or abandon the\nEndeavor

may\nchallenge them and number four\nindividuals with high IQs may have\ndifficulties making and maintaining\nfriendships\nat times being smarter and more\nknowledgeable can easily be\nmisunderstood as arrogant according to\nthe same article by Dr Seltzer from\nPsychology today some may find it\nchallenging to be good friends with\nsomeone smarter they may feel inferior\nand in a different League compared to\nhighly intelligent individuals\nintelligent individuals may even feel\nfrustrated when others can't understand\nwhat they are trying to convey despite\nrepeating what they say and using\nlayman's terms because of this\ncommunication may be difficult\nespecially when both parties are not\nalways in sync and may not understand\neach other well a study on children with\nhigh IQs in Seattle published in the\njournal Roper review revealed that their\nparticipants tended to be friendly with\nolder kids they also agreed that being\nsmart made it hard for them to make\nfriends of their own age\nso do you relate to any of these reasons\nit can be easy to assume that those with\nhigh intelligence will always have it\neasy in life but the reality may be far\nfrom it if you relate to any of these\nreasons which problem do you have the\nhardest time with\nit's a great first step to admit the\nproblem you're having then you can work\non accepting and integrating Solutions\nwith
