    "transcript": "hello everyone my name is Michelle Rivas\nand I'm the host of ask an advocate\nwhich is a series on psych2go that's\ndedicated to spreading mental health\nawareness and promoting Mental Health\nAccess I'm extremely excited today to\nintroduce Our Guest Lauren Kennedy from\nliving well with schizophrenia it's a\nYouTube channel she has tons of\nsubscribers and is doing amazing work\nLauren is a mental health Advocate who's\npassionate about spreading awareness and\ncompassion around schizophrenia Lauren\nearned her Bachelor of Arts degree in\nSocial Development studies and a\nbachelor of Social Work Lauren was\ndiagnosed with schizoaffective disorder\nso she offers a unique perspective I'm\nstemming from her own lived experiences\nand her time as a social worker\ntoday we're going to be discussing the\nstigma around schizophrenia and the\nimportance of fighting these harmful\nstereotypes and problematic narratives\nwe're also going to be touching on\nMental Health Awareness access and\ndebunking the myths about schizophrenia\nso let's start the stream by debunking\nAnd discussing the different types of\nproblematic myths that are perpetuated\nabout schizophrenia in a survey and I\nwanted to start out with this because I\nthink that it's really important in a\nsurvey conducted by the National\nAlliance of mental illness they found\nthat 64 of the American population still\nbelieves that people diagnosed with\nschizophrenia have two or more separate\npersonalities which simply isn't the\ncase\nso I just wanted to know Lauren\nwhat are the common myths about\nschizophrenia and how how has it\naffected you personally\nsure so\num I think probably the most common myth\nabout schizophrenia is what you just\nmentioned where people assume that it's\nmultiple personalities and that's just\nnot the case that's actually a whole\ndifferent mental health disorder called\ndissociative identity disorder where\nsomeone has dissociative\nyou know symptoms where they have\nmultiple personalities\num but schizophrenia is not that at all\nit's very very different and so that is\none really really common myth associated\nwith it I think another really common\none is that people who are living with\nschizophrenia are dangerous or violent\nin nature and that really is not the\ncase it's not a symptom of schizophrenia\nto be violent I think the rate of\nviolence in people who are living with\nschizophrenia is one percent which is\nactually the exact same as the general\npopulation so there's no difference\nbetween people who are living with\nschizophrenia and the general population\nin terms of violence\num actually you know it's important to\nnote that probably people with\nschizophrenia are oftentimes more likely\nto be the victims of violence than the\nperpetrators and so that's kind of a\nharmful stereotype as well\num some other ones include that\nschizophrenia only involves\nhallucinations or delusions I think that\nthat's kind of people's\nBaseline understanding of what\nschizophrenia is but there's a lot more\nto it than that there's actually two\nwell actually three different kinds of\nsymptoms there's positive symptoms which\ninclude things like hallucinations and\ndelusions and paranoia and that sort of\nthing\nand then there's also negative symptoms\nand cognitive symptoms that kind of go a\nlittle bit more on unaddressed or not\ntalked about as much and these negative\nsymptoms include things like blunted\naffect or reduced motivation or you know\nthings that almost sort of look like\ndepression sometimes they are a little\ndifferent but there's a lot more to\nschizophrenia than people generally\nunderstand\nno I totally agree with you and how do\nyou feel like these myths have impacted\nyour life\num I think that\nit's made me really\nfearful of sharing my diagnosis with\npeople because people have these\nmisrepresentations in their mind about\nwhat it means to live with schizophrenia\nand you know like another one is that\npeople believe that people with\nschizophrenia can't be treated or worse\nthat they can't be you know living\nnormal lives out in the community with\neveryone else and so I think that's a\nparticularly harmful one for me anyway\nthat I've experienced where people are\nkind of surprised that I'm living my\nlife the way I am and you know Finding\nmeaning and purpose and fulfillment from\nmy life I think that's surprising\nunfortunately to some people yeah and\nwhat do you feel like is the influence\nof problematic narratives in the media\nabout schizophrenia and how do they\nperpetuate the stigma and the\ndiscrimination against people with\nschizophrenia\nyeah I think a lot of what we're fed\nabout schizophrenia in popular culture\nand media and stuff is kind of the\nstigmatized depictions of schizophrenia\nyou know the first thing that comes to\nmind is shows like Criminal Minds where\nthere is a serial killer who has\nschizophrenia and that's kind of the\nstory arc that we're given in popular\nculture and obviously that's incredibly\nharmful because that's really not a very\nnuanced or accurate even depiction of\nmost people's experience living with and\nmanaging an illness like schizophrenia\nand I feel like honestly these\nproblematic narratives like really\ninvalidate individuals and they trigger\neven more symptoms and honestly\nexacerbate the issue and so in what ways\ndo you feel like these narratives\ntrigger other symptoms and individuals\nwith schizophrenia such as maybe anxiety\nand depression\num but I think that's something\nimportant to talk about in relation to\nhow these narratives impact people is it\nreally\nperpetuates\nself-stigma and internalized stigma\nwhich is basically when you take the\nmessages you're being fed from society\nabout you know misconceptions about what\nit means to live with an illness like\nschizophrenia and you start to believe\nthem yourself and you start to feel\nshame or\nstigma essentially self-stigma\ninternalized stigma around these\nmessages you were receiving from society\nno I totally agree with that and in like\nwhat ways do you feel like our society\ndiscriminates against people who have\nbeen diagnosed with schizophrenia\num like how do you feel like they\nstigmatize them and how does it affect\nthem\nyeah I don't think anyone sets out to\nlike discriminate against people with\nschizophrenia it's a lot more\nan issue of all the things we've been\ntalking about these misconceptions and\nmyths that Society is in general holds\nabout people who are living with\nschizophrenia and so that stigma and\nthese\nmisinformed ideas about what it means to\nlive with schizophrenia negatively\nimpact people who are living with\nschizophrenia you know I have been\npushed out of jobs before because people\nfound out about my diagnosis and didn't\nreally know how to support me or what to\ndo about it and so it was easier to just\nkind of push me out and I think that is\nwhat shows up a lot is just this lack of\nEducation around what it means to live\nwith schizophrenia and then leading to\npeople just kind of not wanting to even\ngo there not wanting to deal with it\nwhich essentially ends up being\ndiscrimination against people who are\nliving with schizophrenia exactly and\nyou mentioned that like sometimes\nthere's a lack of education and the\npeople around you may not know like what\nto do so how do you feel that family\nmembers and you know romantic partners\nand friends can best support someone who\nhas been diagnosed with schizophrenia\nand approach it in a way that's like\nnon-judgmental\nyeah I think being as open as possible\nto learning as much as you can about the\nillness and that both means you know\ndoing research about what exactly the\nillness entails but I think more\nimportantly trying to learn from your\nloved one about what their experience of\nthe illness is and trying to really kind\nof sit with them through their\nexperience of it and to get a better\nunderstanding of how to empathize and\nhow to support them through it\nand like when you were starting out and\nyou had like been first diagnosed about\nschizophrenia I know you go\num into detail about your journey on\nyour YouTube page and I'm just wondering\nwhat has helped you navigate through\nthat and like what resources have you\nused and that you would recommend to\nothers where maybe dealing with the\nissue especially people who have been\ndiagnosed um like newly\nso what has helped me kind of learn how\nto navigate my illness yeah and like\nover time has helped yeah yeah so I\nthink that something that has been super\nsuper pivotal for me in terms of\nlearning how to manage my illness in a\nway that feels good for me has been\naround working on self-acceptance and\nyou know that definitely plays into what\nwe're talking about today about\nnavigating managing stigma and that\ninternalized stigma that I was talking\nabout and kind of reading through that\nto work on\nI would all want to say coming to a\nplace because there's no real end\ndestination of self-acceptance it's kind\nof an ongoing process throughout your\nentire life and your entire Journey with\nmental illness but working on engaging\nin that process of\ncoming to a place of self-acceptance for\nyourself is really really important and\nI think that's probably been the most\nimportant component of me figuring out\nhow to manage my illness and then of\ncourse you know obviously more tangible\nthings like learning what medication and\ntreatment and what tangible things help\nme to live well but the self-acceptance\ncomponent has really been a\ngroundwork I guess that needed to be\nlaid to figure out everything else\num and honestly I like touching on\nstereotypes again in some ways the media\ndoes perpetuate these problematic\nnarratives but I also think the media\ncan actually help with the issue if they\ntransform sort of like their narratives\nlike they can actually make a positive\nimpact and so in your opinion what can\nthe media do to actually help Empower\nindividuals with schizophrenia and sort\nof dismantle those problematic\nnarratives\nyeah I think there's so much room to\ncreate more nuanced depictions of people\nwho are living with schizophrenia\nthere's one show that I actually really\nliked in terms of this and it was a show\ncalled Maniac it was with Emma Stone and\nJonah Hill I think and it just did a\nreally wonderful job of creating a\ncomplex character who was dealing with\nschizophrenia but who didn't fall into\nthese common tropes that we see in media\nof being violent being\nyou know kind of just unhinged or\nwhatever it didn't fall into that it\nreally it really did Justice to the\nexperience of living with schizophrenia\nand also to the rest of his character as\nwell because I think that's something\nreally important to understand is that\npeople who are living with schizophrenia\nare people you know just like anyone\nelse and I think that's really important\nto remember that there's so much more to\nsomeone than just managing an illness\nlike schizophrenia\nand I like that you mentioned that\npeople's schizophrenia are just like\npeople like everyone else and it should\nbe something that's just more widely\naccepted and so I'm wondering\nhonestly if you were to like really um\nthink about it when it comes to\nindividuals dealing with schizophrenia\nwhy do you feel like advocacy is\nimportant\nyeah I think advocacy is important for\nyou know any Mental Illness but I think\nespecially for illnesses like\nschizophrenia that are really still a\nlot more stigmatized in general Society\nI think we've come a really long way in\nterms of talking more about things like\ndepression and anxiety which is\nwonderful but there is still so much\nkind of\nmisunderstanding and lack of education\nand awareness around illnesses like\nschizophrenia or like dissociative\nidentity disorder or you know those more\nstigmatized illnesses like that and so I\nthink that advocacy and kind of showing\nwhat it means to actually live with the\nillness of sharing that more and\nproviding that education is really\nreally important\nand I just wanted to know why do you\nfeel like um individuals might like\ndiscriminate or not necessarily\ndiscriminate but have misconceptions\nabout individuals with schizophrenia\nlike where do you think that comes from\nyeah um I don't really know why we have\nthis narrative within Society that's\nkind of misguided in terms of what\nschizophrenia is I think that you know\nwhat we've been talking about about\ndepictions in the media has definitely\nplayed a role in terms of our\nunderstanding our Collective\nunderstanding of schizophrenia and so\nyeah unfortunately it is what it is\nthere is a misunderstanding of\nschizophrenia within society and so I\nthink that a lot more work needs to be\ndone to better educate ourselves about\nwhat it actually means\nand I know that a lot of individuals\nstruggling with schizophrenia and I've\nheard this time and time again have\nsometimes trouble accessing Mental\nHealth Resources accessing therapists\nand you know medications and everything\nthat they need why do you think that it\ncan be very difficult for individuals to\nbe diagnosed with schizophrenia and get\nthe help that they need\nyeah I mean I think that's a really huge\nbroader discussion about the state of\nmental health care and where we're at in\nterms of that and it is an unfortunate\nreality that a lot of people who are\nstruggling with psychotic symptoms or\nother mental illnesses as well are not\nbeing able to access adequate care and\nsome of that also has to do with\num an individual's capacity at any given\ntime to advocate for themselves\nunfortunately the way our system is set\nup it does require you know a fairly\nHigh degree of being able to advocate\nfor yourself or having someone who can\nadvocate for you in order to access\nproper care and so sometimes that really\nis a barrier for people who are\nstruggling with schizophrenia symptoms\nto properly access care\nand so if someone is maybe they're\nthinking that they might have\nschizophrenia or family members might\nassume that they have schizophrenia what\nare some good steps in the right\ndirection that they should take if they\nfeel like they might have it\num what can they do to sort of like\nhandle the situation\nyeah so the absolute number one thing\nyou should do if you have any you know\nfeelings that you might be dealing with\nan illness like schizophrenia is to talk\nwith your doctor about it they will be\nthe best person to kind of talk to you\nabout your concerns and to figure out\nkind of where to go from there and they\ncan connect you with further resources\nif you need whether that's a therapist a\npsychiatrist and they can just kind of\nbe a good springboard to figure out\nwhere to go in terms of figuring out\nwhat's going on with you what the things\nthat what's happening with the things\nthat you're concerned about\nI think that um this next topic is a\nreally important one to touch on um how\ndo you feel like schools like high\nschools\num you diversities colleges can support\nstudents who might be dealing with\nschizophrenia like what resources can\nthey provide\nyeah that's a great question because I\nthink that that is something that I have\nstruggled with is kind of falling\nthrough the cracks in the University\nsetting and I think that's something\nthat a lot of people who are navigating\nillnesses like schizophrenia deal with\nas well I'm not super sure what the\nanswer is in terms of what they can\nprovide but I mean accommodations if you\nare dealing with it illness like\nschizophrenia don't be afraid to go to\naccessibility services or whatever it's\ncalled at your school and talk about\nways that you can access accommodations\nto help you\nhelp you succeed in school because the\nreality is that you have different needs\nthan a regular neurotypical student and\nso it's I think this is something that I\ngrappled with for a long time is feeling\nthat I was kind of cheating by getting\naccommodations or you know that I was\ngetting preferential treatment but\nthat's not the case accommodations are\navailable to kind of even the playing\nfield and to kind of get you to a place\nwhere you are able to succeed while\nstill doing all the same work as your\npeers and still putting in the safe\neffort but yeah don't be afraid to go\nand figure out accommodations with your\nschool\nso now I'm going to start um the\naudience question so the first one I\nhave here is Lauren how do you deal with\ndiscrimination at work\nyeah that's a really tricky one and you\nknow I have a lot of videos on our\nYouTube channel talking more about this\nissue because it is kind of a\ncomplicated one and I think it does vary\nfrom situation to situation whether you\nfeel safe disclosing at your work or not\nor if you think that that's going to\ncause bigger issues and so dealing with\ndiscrimination at work I think\nagain the self-advocacy component comes\ninto place\nas much as possible work on\nsharing you know what your needs are\nwith your employer and what you are\nthinking is feeling unfair if you do\nfeel like you've been wrongfully\nterminated or pushed out of a job\nyou do kind of have legal rights\noftentimes and I don't know the\nlogistics about that but don't be afraid\nto to seek out legal help if you do feel\nthat you've been wrongfully\ndiscriminated in the workplace\nthank you and then the next question is\nby\num Carmen how do you open up with family\nmembers about your schizophrenia\nespecially if you've just been diagnosed\nyeah so that can feel like a really\nscary thing for you know a lot of the\nreasons that we've been talking about\ntoday are on stigma and internalized\nstigma and all that stuff I think that a\nreally good kind of way to connect with\nyour family is trying to be leaning into\nvulnerability with them if it feels safe\nif you feel that you're going to be met\nwith support from your family trying to\nbe as open with them as possible so that\nthey can learn from you and better\nunderstand what your experience is like\nnow that said there are going to be some\nsituations where you will be met with\nlack of support and that's unfortunate\nbut try to find people in your life who\nyou do feel comfortable opening up to\nbecause having that level of support and\nunderstanding can be extremely\nbeneficial\nand then Max asked um Lauren how do you\ndeal with the people around you\num if they can't accept the fact that\nyou have a schizophrenia diagnosis and\nthey're treating you differently due to\nit\nOkay so\nI mean that you need to have a bigger\nconversation with the person about you\nknow what exactly they're not accepting\nor why they're treating you differently\nbut kind of the same thing I just\nmentioned about trying to be as you know\nopen and vulnerable as possible in terms\nof educating them on your experience and\nsharing with them your experience at the\nend of the day if they just don't accept\nthat and they're not going to support\nyou I think you need to kind of ask\nyourself if that's you know someone you\nwant to keep in your life but you know\nagain figuring out people in your life\nwho are going to be able to be\nsupportive presences and accept you for\nwho you are I think is probably the most\nimportant thing\nthank you and I'm trying to check um if\nthere's more audience questions\nso uh one question is how do you deal\nwith if you have a schizophrenia\ndiagnosis how do you deal with\ninternalized feelings of self-hatred and\nhow do you navigate that so that you can\nget to a place where you feel\nself-acceptance\nyeah so this is a tricky thing to like\ntalk about how to actually work on\nself-exceptions it's a big topic and\nit's a difficult thing to work on you\nknow navigating all the internalized\nshame and stigma and whatnot I think\nthat a good place to start is learning\nabout your illness I think that that's\nsomething that really helped me in terms\nof creating our YouTube channel was I\ndove really deep into what schizophrenia\nis what it means for me what my\nexperience is and I really you know got\nacquainted with that and I really\nkind of educated myself on what\nschizophrenia is what my experience has\nbeen and I've kind of worked on coming\nto a place of accepting what that means\nfor my life what kind of changes I've\nhad to almost mourn from before\ndiagnosis and working on accepting that\nI'm accepting me as a complicated\nnuanced person who also lives with an\nillness like schizophrenia and maybe\nworking less on conflating my identity\nwith having schizophrenia\nand then we just got a question Lauren\nhow do you deal with with or when you\nhave hallucinations\nyeah so I have them less often because I\nmy medications do a really good job of\nmanaging them I do have breakthrough\nsymptoms every now and then\num but they're not super distressing and\nso I'm kind of able to just either\nignore or talk with my partner about\nthem I think I find that really helpful\nto vocalize when I'm experiencing\nsomething\nor or just ignore it or tune it out with\nmusic or distraction of some kind\ndistractions really helps me and moving\nmy body is also something that really\nhelps me I love to run and when I'm\ndealing with a lot of symptoms running\ncan be a really helpful thing for me and\nso just figuring out what what feels\ngood for you and what helps soothe you\nand kind of re-ground you within reality\nis really helpful\nthank you and I agree running is great\nmedicine and it helps you and it\nactually um increases like the certain\nhormones in your brain that um like they\nincrease the motivation and stuff like\nthat so I definitely agree with that and\num Tim asks my brother has this\ncondition and he's no longer on\nmedication he seemed to be the same when\nI last saw him is there like anxiety\nlinked with it does everyone need to\nstay medicated\nI think that's a really really personal\nquestion\num to figure out with your doctor or\nwith your brother's doctor\num I know some people who have\nschizophrenia who are able to manage it\ncompletely off medication and that's\nreally wonderful if they're able to you\nknow live in a way that they want to\nlive while off medication for me that\nhasn't been possible yet I have needed\nto stay on medication but\nI think that's you know navigating how\nto come off medication or how to how to\nbalance that is really important to\nnavigate with your psychiatrist\num another question is how do you deal\nwith feelings like you are burdening\nothers such as family and friends by\nneeding a bit more support there's\nactually a question that's come up a lot\nso yeah\nyeah I really empathize with that\nbecause I know I know\nfeels feeling like you're a burden on\nother people feeling like you know\nit's all about supporting you and I know\nthat that can be a really difficult\nthing to navigate I think what's really\nimportant to remember is that\nit's okay it's okay to need a little bit\nof extra support it's okay to need to\nlean on your loved ones and\nI can almost guarantee that they want to\nbe able to provide that support for you\nand you know in any relationship there\nis a degree of reciprocity and\nreciprocal nature and I'm sure that\nthere are ways in which you provide\nsupport for them it may not look the\nsame as the support they give to you but\nthere are ways that you can kind of\nreturn that support and reciprocate as\nwell if that kind of just helps me any\nway to feel a little bit less of a\nburden and feel like I'm giving\nsomething as well but it's really\nimportant to remember that it's okay to\nneed extra support\nthank you and Mike asked um why how do\nyou deal with a friend who is turning to\ndrinks and drugs to deal with their\nschizophrenia and what is the effect\nyeah self-medicating can be a really big\nproblem I think particularly with people\nwho are living with schizophrenia it's a\nreally hard illness to manage and so you\nknow self-medicating can be a really\nenticing thing to turn to and I would\nencourage you to encourage them I guess\nto speak with their doctor about it or a\ntherapist or someone who can maybe help\nthem figure out how they want to cope if\nmaybe it doesn't involve self-medicating\nand maybe figuring out more\nhealthy or sustainable coping mechanisms\nand coping strategies\num and I had a question and this is one\nI had listed how do you increase empathy\nand compassion in our society around\nindividuals who have schizophrenia and\njust mental illness in general\nyeah I mean that's kind of the thesis of\nmy YouTube channel is trying to increase\nempathy and compassion in the general\npopulation for people who are living\nwith illnesses like schizophrenia and I\nthink that the way to make that happen\nor to go about that is again leaning\ninto vulnerability and sharing openly\nabout what it actually means to live\nwith the illness and sharing you know so\nthat people can see that people who are\nliving with illnesses like schizophrenia\nagain are first and foremost people\nthey're nuanced complicated people and\num I think once you\nview it through that lens it is a lot\neasier to empathize with someone in\nterms of schizophrenia being a challenge\nthat they face rather than being what\nthey literally are it's a part of them\nit doesn't Define them right yeah yeah\nand then um someone asked is there any\nat home remedies that will help with\ndealing with hallucinations or paranoia\nnot that I know of you know I have my\nown coping strategies I don't know\nenough necessarily home remedies I think\nthat you know if you're looking for that\nkind of thing again that's really\nimportant to discuss with your doctor\nthey would be able to better guide you\nin that sense\num Lauren could you share some of your\nown coping strategies that have helped\nyou deal with the illness\nyeah so\num I think actually a really big one\nthat probably doesn't go talked about\nenough is creating social connections I\nthink that that has really helped me to\nfigure out how to positively manage my\nIllness but then also things like\nexercise nutrition sleep sleep is a\nreally really big one for me making sure\nthat I get enough sleep and kind of\nregularly scheduled sleep has been\nreally important in managing my illness\num but yeah like I mentioned running\nexercise is really important for me to\num yeah those are kind of the pillars I\nguess of how I manage my illness\num another person asked how do you\nbalance wanting to do better in life\nwith balancing giving yourself Grace I\nguess what they're probably trying to\nsay is how are you kind to yourself in\nmidst of like being newly diagnosed\nsure\num something that helped me early on was\nto think of whatever I was facing as\nbeing something that someone else in my\nlife was facing and how would I how\nwould I treat that person and rarely if\nactually never was it harshly or from a\nplace of judgment or you know criticism\nit was always with Grace and compassion\nand so you know when you realize that\nthat's what you would give to someone\nelse I hope that it makes it easier to\nbe like well I should give that to\nmyself too you know I'm worthy and I\ndeserve a little bit of extra Grace and\ncompassion and empathy from myself too\num and another question is should\nschools increase education about mental\nillness should that be incorporated in\nour school system because I feel like\nthat's a part of advocacy is educating\npeople on it like if we don't have in my\nopinion if we had like a system of\nmandatory education on mental illness\nthen I think it would decrease that\nstigmatization and what's your opinion\non that\nyeah I agree I think that there is\nabsolutely no harm in having more\neducation especially at an earlier level\nwhere you know early intervention is\nreally important especially with\npsychotic illnesses early intervention\nis talked about a lot as being a really\nimportant thing and so if we can provide\nincreased education to a population\nwho's perhaps that increased risk of\nexperiencing a first episode of\npsychosis or other mental illnesses\nthere's absolutely tremendous benefit in\nthat\nand then another question is Lauren what\nwould be the best way to interact and or\napproach someone with schizophrenia\naside from normal or everyday life like\nwhat's the challenge of interacting with\nsomeone with um with it and how to\nunderstand them\num\nI think I'm just going to bring it back\nto again understanding that that person\nis a person first and foremost and so to\nreally kind of try to treat them as you\nwould anyone else I'm thinking maybe\nyou're talking about more if they're\nactively experiencing delusions or\nwhatnot in which case the way you would\ntalk to them differently I guess is to\njust try to validate how they're feeling\num I think that that's a really\nimportant place to focus on is how\nthey're feeling because oftentimes if\nyou're experiencing a delusion it can be\nconfusing it can be scary and it's hard\nto ground yourself in reality and so\nfocusing on how they're feeling is a\ngood place to start and not feeding into\ntheir delusions so if they're like the\nsky is purple right now like I the sky\nis purple you can be like okay well\nis that making you feel scared and\nfocusing on how that makes them feel and\nthen being like well that's not how I'm\nexperiencing it but I hear that's how\nyou're experiencing it so validating\nthat without buying into it and without\nnegating it as well just saying that\nthat's not how I'm experiencing it but\nif someone is not you know struggling\nwith a delusion or something like that\nor a hallucination in the moment talk to\nthem the way you would anyone else they\nare people and\nyeah\nsomeone asked and I'm not sure I'm not\nfamiliar with this organization but\nsomeone\num asked do you have any opinion on the\nhearing voices organization\nare you familiar I don't know much about\nthem I have heard a bit about them um so\nyou know no I I don't know much about\nthem okay\num let me I'm trying to find a few more\nquestions\nthey're with me\noh a great question how can work or\nschools create a community to help\nothers dealing with mental illness in\ngeneral like how can we Foster a\nsupportive community on this issue\nyeah\num I think kind of a lot of what we've\nbeen talking about already in terms of\nbeing open to educating yourself about\nthings that other people are facing\nwhether it's your work colleagues\nwhether it's whoever it is being open to\nlearning from them and creating you know\na supportive Dynamic I think is really\nthe best way to go about it kind of on\nan individual level in terms of like\nworkplaces or schools creating Community\nI think there's lots of really great\nwork being done around you know advocacy\ngroups or support groups and so I don't\nknow just keep going in that in that\ntrajectory I think also a really\nimportant component of increasing\nsupport for mental health in the\nworkplace and in schools is working on\nbettering services available to people\naccommodations and services available to\nstudents and employees\nI agree\num Michael asked I have suffered from\nhppd in the past it's schizophrenia also\ninducing shifting and breathing or is it\ncomparable to hppd in general\nI'm not sure what hppd is\num yeah sorry about that I mean I wasn't\nsure either\num yeah I'll move on to the next\nquestion okay so Jorge asked what do you\nthink about micro dosing\nyeah so I have a specific video on our\nYouTube channel about my experience with\num I'm assuming micro dosing mushrooms\nis that\nI'm not sure\nyeah\nwell we have a couple of videos one\nwhere I talk about my experience with\nmushrooms and it wasn't\num a positive experience I wasn't micro\ndosing so I don't know personally about\nthat we do have a video though with Dr\nTracy marks who also has a YouTube\nchannel\num she's a psychiatrist and she shares\nmore about alternative treatments for\nschizophrenia and so that might be\nsomething you want to check out um but\nthere's not a lot known yet on\nmicrodosing so I won't give any answer\nto that but it is it has been on my\nradar\num so one of the commenters um actually\nclarified their question about hppd they\nsaid that hppd is basically drug-induced\npsychosis so that's what they were\nreferring to\nokay and so what was the question let me\nsee\num\nthe question was\ntrying to find it\nokay so I think this was actually so\nthey asked the question prior but I\nthink this is what they're getting at\ncan someone develop schizophrenia from\npsychedelics so that I think that's what\nhe was getting at with hppd\nokay\num I actually don't know the answer to\nthat I I I don't know I know that\nsomeone can develop schizophrenia from\nmarijuana usage\num that can be a trigger for psychosis\num so that is definitely something to\nlook out for it doesn't mean that if you\nsmoke marijuana you're going to develop\npsychosis but if you have a\npredisposition for it it can be a\ntrigger to the onset of psychosis I'm\nnot sure about psychedelics though\num would you when it comes to like drug\nuse and schizophrenia what are your\nthoughts on it and maybe your advice on\nthat matter\nyeah so\nyou know honestly I have experimented\num somewhat with marijuana and I like I\nsaid with\num mushrooms or psychedelics and\nit has been\nlike I wouldn't advise it if you are\ndealing with an illness like\nschizophrenia because it does become\nvery difficult to stay grounded in\nreality and there are very real\num\npotential\nissues or pitfalls I guess with\nexperimenting with substances that\nfurther alter your mind and so it's not\nsomething that I would recommend if you\nare living with an illness like\nschizophrenia just because there already\nis that kind of difficulty with staying\nconnected with reality at times and so\nadding a substance that is kind of\nliterally meant for that makes it hard\nand it has been difficult for me to kind\nof come out of episodes as a result of\nthat and again like I said marijuana\nusage can also trigger the onset of\nschizophrenia so it's definitely\nsomething to\nbe cautious with\nI agree Lauren and also if you're going\nto try a substance you should probably\nat least let your doctor know because\nthen they could give you advice on it so\nthat is a great place to start if you\nare curious about trying a substance\ntalk with your doctor about it first\nthey're going to be able to provide you\na lot better\num information on what the experience\nmight be like or what to look out for or\nmaybe why you shouldn't do it exactly\nand I'm going to take two more questions\nso this one is from Sue what\naccommodations might be most helpful to\nuse in public settings like a workplace\nschool or a doctor's office\nyeah\num\nso a a really helpful accommodation for\nme was shortening my work week and so\nyou know I was working nine to five\nMonday through Wednesday and taking a\nday in the middle like Wednesday off was\nreally helpful or Friday or whatever\nwhatever works out with your work for us\nbut figuring out how to reduce the X the\nprolonged stress I guess because\nultimately the stress is what triggers\nsymptoms and so figuring out how to kind\nof mitigate that a little bit is really\nbeneficial but that can look different\nfor other people you know that may not\nbe helpful for some people but figuring\nout what accommodations will help you be\nable to manage your expectations at work\nor wherever it is at school and kind of\ngoing from there\nokay and then this is the last question\nand I think this is a really good one\nbecause it just um sort of touches on\nmental health and lifestyle\num I was wondering if so the question is\nI was wondering if you have any tips on\nmanaging money when your mental health\ngets bad I find when my symptoms get bad\nI struggle with managing money as\nspending becomes a coping mechanism\nyeah I've definitely struggled with that\nas well\num\nsomething that's helpful for me is you\nknow learning this pattern of behavior\nlike it sounds like you're doing and\nbeing aware of that which is a great\nfirst step and then kind of placing in\nprotective measures I guess to guard\nyourself from falling into that trap\nwhen you're in a period of unwellness so\nfor me that has looked like asking my\npartner before making any sort of\npurchases and just kind of having that\nsounding board before you know\npotentially overspending or whatever it\nmay be it may look like setting limits\non your credit card or your debit card\nor whatnot when you're struggling so\nthat you literally can't do that\num\nor it could it could just be asking\nsomeone for help navigating that when\nyou're not well but that is that is\nsomething that I think a lot of people\ndo struggle with who have illnesses like\nschizophrenia or bipolar disorder or\nsometimes even depression any mental\nillness this can be a symptom of and so\nyeah it's a great thing to be aware of\nand to ask for help with\nso just touching on that my question\nwould be so should you maybe like if you\nhave certain unhealthy coping mechanisms\nshould you let your support system know\nso that they can get involved is that\nsomething that can help you like if you\nknow that you have like maybe an issue\nwith spending should you let you know\nyour partner know or a friend know so\nthat they can do something about it\nperhaps I think that's really helpful it\ndepends on your comfort level of course\nwith that person and with wanting to\nchange your coping strategy you know\nlike I've had maladaptive or negative\ncoping strategies before where I haven't\nbeen in a place where I've wanted to\nchange it yet but if you do find\nyourself which you know poses its own\nsets of problems so I guess working\nfirst on accepting that it's not the\nhealthiest way to cope and working on\nfiguring out better more sustainable\npositive coping mechanisms and you're\nright what has been helpful for me in\nthe past is particularly letting my\npartner know what I'm struggling with\nwhat kind of coping mechanisms I'm\nleaning on and that I want help changing\nand having that support can be really\nhelpful\nokay well that was the last question and\nthank you so much for joining me Lauren\nthe work you're doing is amazing it's\ninspiring and when I came across your\nchannel I knew that you were making a\ndifference in the world you are making a\ndifference in the world so thank you so\nmuch if any of you are interested in\nschizophrenia resources and videos\nplease check out
