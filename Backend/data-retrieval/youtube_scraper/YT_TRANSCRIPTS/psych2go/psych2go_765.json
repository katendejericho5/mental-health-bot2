    "transcript": "our thoughts feelings and overall mental\nhealth play a large part in how we\nexperience sex mental health and sex are\nstrongly connected in many fascinating\nways for example the brain releases the\nneurotransmitters dopamine serotonin and\noxytocin during sex what does this do\nthis increases one's happiness and\nrelaxation while also temporarily\nreducing those negative feelings I can\ncome along with depression with our sex\nlife affecting our mental health and our\nmental health affecting our sex life\nthere are a lot of interesting facts to\nlearn about the two together so here are\nfive psychological facts about sex and\nmental health number one feeling sad\nafter sex it could be post-coital\ndysphoria you've just had great sex but\nthen you start to cry what's going on\nhere this is actually called post-coil\ndysphoria or PCD and it was quite common\nthis is is when one experiences intense\nsadness distress or anger post sex or\npost-orgasm according to a 2015 survey\nof college women published in the\nJournal of sexual medicine 46 of women\nexperienced it at least once while five\npercent said they felt sad and lonely\nafter intercourse several times in a\nperiod of four weeks post-coital\ndysphoria happens to males and females\nand the authors of the study also state\nthat there appeared to be no\nrelationship between PCD and Intimacy in\nclose relationships so you may find\nyourself suddenly sad and in tears even\nthough a few moments ago you were having\nthe time of your life there's still much\nresearch needed on the cause of this but\ncertified sex therapist Ian Kerner\nbelieves that it has to do with a\nrelease of hormones or perhaps\nvulnerability Kona explained in an\narticle from Essence that post sex is a\nreflective period and that can bring up\nemotions and experiences you normally\nkeep under\nnumber two positive self-image and\nmasturbation the 2011 study found that\nmasturbating may just improve how you\nview yourself the study states that\namong women masturbation in childhood\nand Adolescence has been associated with\npositive sexual experiences later in\nlife and a healthy self-image in another\nstudy of adolescent females aged 16 to\n18. those with negative or in different\nviews about masturbation reported\nnegative First sexual experiences\ncompared with those who hold positive\nviews of masturbation that can make a\nbig difference depending on if you've\nmastered masturbation\nno one well the studies results\nindicated the majority of males reported\nmasturbation at 73.8 percent while\nfemales reported at 48.1 percent the\ntopic is still highly stigmatized with a\nnegative view the study States Under\nreporting by adolescence has been found\neven with the use of confidential\nreporting techniques further showing the\nshame and guilt that can be rooted in\nthis topic for some the study goes on to\ninclude highly interesting information\non the topic with sex education often\nemitting the topic of masturbation\nparents having a difficult time\ndiscussing the topic with their child\nwith some having the study says the hope\nthat their children will view\nmasturbation unfavorably the study also\nexplains that in 1994 when U.S Surgeon\nGeneral Jocelyn Elders recommended\nincluding masturbation as a topic in\npublic sexual education she was heavily\ncriticized and ultimately resigned so\nwhat's all the fuss it looks like from\nthe results of this study your sexual\nexperiences and self-image may just have\na chance to improve a bit number three\nheart attack myth unless you're cheating\nwell it's often depicted in movies\nsomeone suddenly going into cardiac\narrest during sexual intercourse it's\nalso not likely to happen but rather\njust great comedic timing it's very rare\nto have a heart attack during sex with\nless than one percent of heart attacks\noccurring during sex but still people\ntend to hold on to this heart attack\nmyth what is fascinating is that\nresearch has discovered that at the off\nchance heart attacks do happen during\nsex it more often happens to men when\nthey're cheating when in comparisons\nwhen someone's having sex with a spouse\nsome believe it could be due to the\nguilt anxiety and overall psychological\ndistress that can arise from cheating\nwith the stress affecting the heart a\n2012 study published in the Journal of\nsexual medicine explains that several\ninterpersonal sexual and biological\nfactors are associated with having\nextramarital Affairs unfaithfulness in\nmen seems to be associated with a higher\nrisk of major cardiovascular events ah\nwhat sex does to the heart number four\narousal non-concordance as mentioned\nbefore our thoughts immersion and state\nof mind are an important part in Sex and\narousal a research study published in\n2020 found that sexual inactivity\nincreased among U.S adults predominantly\nyounger men between 2000 and 2018 with\npotential Public Health implications so\nwhy is this happening the study's\nauthors have a few ideas the study\nstates that rates of depression and\nanxiety have increased among young U.S\nadults U.S adolescents are increasingly\npostponing the start of adult activities\nincluding sex and dating and it has been\nhypothesized that the introduction of\nsmartphones has resulted in less\nopportunity for and skills in real world\nhuman interactions so how much can\nanxiety affect someone's sex life well\nfor one it can be pretty difficult to\nrelax enough to enjoy sex if you're\nexperiencing anxiety there's also\narousal non-concordance this is when the\nMind does not match up with what the\nbody is feeling your body may be aroused\nbut your mind is just not feeling it\ntoday or the other way around this often\nhappens to males and females with\nanxiety self-consciousness can also play\na role along with anxiety when it comes\nto sex according to Joe courts certified\nsex therapists and psychotherapist with\nmales not performing can make them even\nmore anxious which then perpetuates the\nerectile dysfunction he goes on to note\nbut it's not really an erectile disorder\nit's anxiety interfering with erectile\nFocus for a woman experiencing arousal\nand orgasm may become difficult if they\nhave anxiety physiologically speaking\nanxiety can take over pleasure in\ncertain cases the 2018 study published\nin the journal Women's Health explains\nthat low sexual desire is strongly\nlinked to depression lack of subjective\narousal and pleasure are linked to trade\nanxiety the sensations of physical\nsexual arousal may lead to fear rather\nthan to pleasure the study goes on to\nexplain that the most common type of\nsexual pain is 10 times more common in\nwomen with previous diagnoses of anxiety\ndisorder clinicians often do not\nroutinely inquire about their patients\nsexual concerns particularly in the\ncontext of psychotic Illness but careful\nassessment diagnosis and explanation of\ntheir situation is necessary and in\nkeeping with patients wishes number five\ntime to get creative remember a good old\noxytocin this hormone is released during\nsexual activity and linked to the\nintensity of orgasms according to\nHealthline but did you know that there's\na love hormone can also get you feeling\ncreative UK psychologist Dr Becky\nSpellman explained in an article for the\nprivate Therapy Clinic that although\noxytocin is in 10 to make you feel\ncloser to your partner it's also able to\ncreate cognitive flexible Pathways in\nthe brain which can foster creative\nthinking and improve problem solving the\npower of oxytocin and sex so did you\nlearn something new about sex and mental\nhealth what were you most surprised
