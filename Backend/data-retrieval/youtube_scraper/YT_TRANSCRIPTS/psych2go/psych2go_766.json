    "video_title": "How Your Brain & Body Respond To Sexual Stimuli?",
    "transcript": "light stemmed hands are everywhere and\nour minds are moving just as fast as\neverything else yeah we're talking about\nsex we all know what happens on the\noutside but until recently we didn't\nrealize that anything was happening on\nthe inside in earlier times we looked to\nreligious head figures for relationship\nand sex advice it took a while for\npeople to come around to the idea of sex\nand our sexual nature being something\nworth studying scientifically one of\nthose ideas that needed to be studied\nwas how human beings respond to sexual\nstimuli before we can talk about the\ndifferent theories on how we respond to\nsexual stimuli let's explain what the\nbody's sexual response cycle is as we\nknow it today what is a sexual response\ncycle to put it simply a sexual response\ncycle is how we respond mentally and\nphysically to sexual stimuli when we're\ntalking about sexual response models\nwe're talking about how our brains\nrespond to sexual stimuli and how that\ncreates the changes in our bodies to\nprepare for sex this is how we\nresearchers know there's a pattern for\nhow most human beings respond and if we\ncan create a measure for it there are\nmultiple models or visual\nrepresentations of our body's responses\nto sex each of these models talk about\nthe sexual response cycle in a different\nway and because human beings are unique\nyou might find that not all of them fit\nyou so which one do you think fits you\nbest let us know at the end of the video\nMasters and Johnson\n1966. today sex is recognized as an\nimportant and healthy part of a\nrelationship when we have issues with\nsex now it can be seen as a medical\nconcern but in the 1960s it was a\ndifferent story it was a big deal when\nWilliam H Masters and Virginia E Johnson\nbegan interviewing and physically\nassessing prostitutes volunteers and\neven themselves to understand how human\nbeings responded to sexual stimuli using\n11 years of research on 382 women and\n312 men their model suggested sexual\nresponse had these stages excitement\nplateau\norgasm and resolution\nand how does this play out in real time\nwell it all starts with excitement this\nis where sexual arousal begins you see\nthem cross the room eyes locked hard a\npounding here we might start feeling the\nphysical changes that come with sexual\nexcitement when we reach the plateau\nthat arousal has grown and intensified\nthis is the stage where you may be\nhaving sex or masturbating it's the\npoint where things are just feeling good\nPlateau lasts until the orgasm phase\nwhich is obviously where you have an\norgasm most people might think this is\nwhere sexual response would end but here\nthere is also a resolution that's where\nour bodies start calming down and\nreturning to the pre-excited state\nKaplan 1979. while the Masters in\nJohnson Model is probably the most\nfamous and widely used it really focused\nmore on what researchers observed in\npeople this means it was about physical\nrather than psychological or\nphysiological response Helen Kaplan a\nsex therapist noted something was\nmissing from this model she adjusted\nMasters and Johnson's model so it could\nalso apply to people who had sexual\ndisorders her model had only three\nstages desire arousal and orgasm\nbefore this model sexual response was\nbelieved to only happen physiologically\nnot psychologically adding the desire\nphase made people recognize that human\nbeings could feel a need or urge for sex\nthis model came out at a time when sex\nwas sometimes considered just another\nmarital Duty so finding it had a\npsychological element was a unique idea\nit recognized that sexual response\nstarts in the brain and it's the body\nthat responds\nWhipple and Brash mcgreer 1997. up until\nthis point researchers suggested that\nsexual response is linear meaning each\nstage happens subsequently but what if\nwe didn't respond in a straight line\nwhat if we repeated some stages over or\neven skipped one that's one of the big\nthings Beverly Whipple and Karen Brash\nMcGregor considered in their model they\neven went back to four stages this time\nthe stages are seduction Sensations\nsurrender and reflection seduction\nincludes desire so it would be where you\nmight start feeling aroused the\nsensations phase is where you start\nfeeling the excitement and even the\nplateau stage at that point you're\nhaving sex and enjoying the excitement\nand Sensations that come along with it\nthe surrender stage is the orgasm point\nand reflection is the resolution but\nthis reflection also includes thinking\nabout whether sex was enjoyable or not\nif it wasn't it might mean you decide\nnot to engage in that connection again\noh and why is this circular and not a\nstraight line well this model assumed\nthat women required their sexual\nencounters to be enjoyable in order to\ngo again so if they liked it they would\nchoose to engage again thus creating a\ncircle of sexual response on top of that\nthey were also suggesting that women may\nrequire more in their own sexual\nresponse than men bassan 2000. each\nversion of the sexual response cycle\nbrings something unique to sexual\nresearch as a whole rosemary passan's\nmodel was no different\nshe thought of different factors like\nbeing in a long-term relationship or how\nyour gender can impact your response we\nknow Men Are from Mars and women are\nfrom Venus but we didn't know that\nincluded how we get turned on and back\noff she recognized that testosterone was\na key player in male sexual response\nmaking it a biological function but that\nwasn't always the case for women she\nlooked at different sexual disorders\ntypically experienced by women such as\nhypoactive sexual desire disorder and\nconsidered how women's sexual response\ncould often be more mental or\npsychological and less biological the\nbassan model is a bit more complex since\nthe stages aren't like the other models\nwe started a place of sexual neutrality\nwe're not feeling sexual but we might be\nopen to it if we find the right stimuli\nwhen that stimuli hits it triggers both\nthe psychological and biological\nresponse we might start experiencing\ndesire or arousal and we can go back and\nforth between the two now unlike the\nother models this one doesn't really\ndiscuss physical sex or orgasm but it\nsuggests that the goal of sex might be\nemotional intimacy and physical\nsatisfaction which for some might not be\nstrictly orgasm without the intimacy and\nconnection it might mean you decide you\ndon't want to continue having sex with\nthis person that bond is what helps the\nlong-term relationship part and it means\nyou might not start sex each time at\nsexual neutrality and that's the gist of\nthis model it might not focus on the sex\nas much but it does hit a lot of points\nthat the straight line models don't like\nwe said sex affects everyone in some way\nor another it's how you got here am I\nright you might even be wondering does\nthis include those who identify as\nasexual the answer is yes it can even\nscience knows inclusivity matters in an\narticle about asexuality medical news\ntoday says some who identify as asexual\nwill experience arousal and some will\nmasturbate while having no interest in\nhaving sex with another person there's a\nlot more research to be done and a whole\nlot more we can learn hopefully this has\ngiven you a little more insight as to\nhow research currently thinks about\nsexual response no matter what model you\nrelate to the most sexual interest\nusually starts in the brain and where\nthe brain goes the body usually follows"
