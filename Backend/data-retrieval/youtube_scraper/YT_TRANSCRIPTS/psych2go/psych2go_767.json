    "transcript": "do you have a feeling someone likes you\nmaybe you've been on a few dates with\nyour crush but you can't tell if you're\nreading their signals right do they like\nyou or not well according to research\nthere are a few common signs here are\nsome psychological signs to help you\nrecognize when someone really likes you\nnumber one that awkward moment when a\n2020 research study published in the\njournal adaptive human behavior and\nPhysiology wanted to look at perceived\nnervous reaction when someone first\nmeets with someone they find attractive\nthe researchers documented their 280\nstudy participants retrospective\nself-reports and found that basically\nthey were nervous wrecks most of the\ntime along with blushing giggling and an\nincreased heart rate the study states\nthat both sexes reported speaking faster\nand being less able to express\nthemselves clearly and women reported\nusing a higher pitch and having a more\nunsteady tone of voice during an initial\nEncounter of Attraction what's also\ninteresting is that the researchers\nasked the participants to rate the\nreactions of others around them to see\nif they would view nervous Behavior as\nthe sign someone was attracted to them\naccording to the study participants\nreported observing similar nervous\nreactions by others whom they perceived\nwere attracted to them\nlet's go back to all those memories of\nyou around your crush someone you really\nreally liked were you extremely nervous\neven if you were trying to hide it I bet\nyou may have acted a bit awkward at\ntimes I'm right aren't I if you notice\nsomeone's Behavior strangely shifts when\nthey notice you this could be a sign you\nmake them nervous why attraction so if\nyou notice they're stumbling over their\nwords or get lost in your dreamy eyes\nthey were probably just unprepared for\nhow amazingly attractive you are and\nconsequently act a bit awkward only when\nthey're around you number two forced\nsmile versus Giddy and genuine smile\nmaybe they aren't just awkward but they\nbecome a bit giddy when they see you\nwhen you see them next pay close\nattention to how often they smile and\nwhat kind of smile they have on their\nface there are a few common facial\nexpressions that could give way to what\nsomeone is really thinking or feeling a\ndecent smile is one of them want to know\nif someone is genuinely smiling in\nDelight you can simply look out for this\nsmile according to Healthline this\noccurs when the zygomaticus major muscle\nlifts the corners of your mouth at the\nsame time the orbicularis oculi muscle\nlifts your cheeks and crinkles your eyes\nat the corners basically it's the type\nof smile that reaches up to your eyes\ncausing those wrinkles by your eyes\nknown as crow's feet to appear this type\nof smile appears when someone is\ngenuinely happy as opposed to a polite\nand kind smile or even a forced smile if\nyou notice they suddenly have a genuine\nand giddy smile when you approach it\ncould mean they really like you now do\nthey like you as a friend or someone\nmore watch out for that nervous\nawkwardness as well number three what do\nthey say when they're busy have you\nasked this particular person out if you\nhave good for you what did they say did\nthey mention that they were busy at\ntimes\nif they left it at a I'm sorry I'm busy\nit could be that they just aren't\nfeeling it romantically or maybe they\nare indeed really busy but if they\nmentioned another time they're available\nto hang out this is a good sign that\nthey may like you sometimes people\nsimply say they're busy so as not to\nhurt someone's feelings ask them when\nthey're free if they aren't quite sure\nand don't follow up with you it's a\npretty clear sign that they're not into\nyou romantically but if they give you a\ntime and date to reschedule there's a\nfair chance that they may like you do\nyou like them number four their voice\nchanges around you so you notice someone\ntalking casually with their friends\ntheir voice appears to be normal but\nthen you approach the group and suddenly\ntheir voice changes language and speak\nresearcher Dr Marina kalashnikova from\nthe University of Western Sydney told\nABC radio Melbourne's Lindsay Burns that\nthe voices of the two people who are\nspeaking to each other if they are\nattracted to each other or if they\nexperience positive emotions towards\neach other they start becoming more\nsimilar she explains this could mean\nthey even start to mimic you or their\npitch may change if they like you she\nfurther explains that changes in the\npitch of our voice or the rate of our\nspeech so how fast we're speaking are\nhappening according to how we feel about\nthe conversation but without our\nconscious control\nnumber five their pupils do what you\nhave a hunch this person really likes\nyou and so far you've noticed a few\nsigns but a subtle sign to watch out for\nis if their pupils dilate when they look\nat you one 2016 study published in the\njournal Evolution and human behavior\nfound the pupil size can determine\nsexual interest\nlooking at the results from their study\nparticipants the study concluded that\nconsistent with the notion that pupil\ndilation is a reliable cue to sexual\narousal sexually interested faces\ncontained objectively larger and darker\npupils than did sexually disinterested\nfaces and according to body language\nexpert Patty Wood author of success\nsignals a guide to reading body language\ndilation is a brain response that occurs\nwhen you like and are attracted to\nsomething\num so if you notice someone's pupils\ndilate when they look deeply into your\neyes mid-conversation this could likely\nbe a sign that they're attracted to you\ntheir eyes are just really excited to\nsee you the good thing is if your pupils\ndilate an attraction as well it's a\ngreat thing to be revealed perhaps\nyou're both a match made in heaven and\nnumber six\nsomething has changed\nhmm you notice your crush talking with a\ngroup of friends you've seen how they\ntalk to other acquaintances as well but\nyou notice they tend to noticeably\nchange their vocabulary and manner only\naround you perhaps you even noticed them\nhugging you a bit longer than their\nother friends according to Dr Jeremy\nNicholson doctor of Social and\npersonality psychology and an article\nfor psychology today when someone is\nattracted to you they will likely find\nsome excuse to touch you more and will\nbe more receptive to your touch as well\nthey may even increase their touching\nover time going from friendly handshakes\nto more intimate Embraces or maybe you\nnotice their behavior simply changes\nonly around you this plays into how\npeople tend to mimic another's subtle\ngestures and behavior if they like them\nincluding changing their expressions Dr\nMarina kalashnikova further explains\nthat we would use more similar\nexpressions for example to sound more\nlike\nshe explains that this can sometimes\nhappen fast over a conversation so do\nyou notice someone unconsciously changes\nthe way they speak all because they're\nsimply an awe of you or are they just\nreally nervous around you again it can\nbe difficult to tell if someone likes\nyou at first but hey if you watch out\nfor these times and all goes well it may\nbe a sign that you should ask them out\nalready and that is if your pupils\ndilate around them we hope you enjoyed\nthis video and if you did don't forget\nto click the like button
