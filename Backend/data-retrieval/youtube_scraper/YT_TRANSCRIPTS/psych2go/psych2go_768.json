    "transcript": "we know you know and just want to make\nit clear that the psych in psych2go is\nshort for psychology so the terms we use\nare usually referring to an actual\nclassification or an actual\npsychological concept not the Casual\nspeak definition so in this case a\npeople-pleaser isn't just someone who\ndoes nice stuff for people it's a\npractice where you're nice to people for\nall the wrong reasons and perhaps aren't\naware that they are the wrong reasons\nperhaps you tell yourself certain\njustifications because the truth is hard\ngood is not always nice look at Batman\nforce of good yes nice the batarang says\nno or Jack Bauer good yes nice you're\njoking right the truth can be\nuncomfortable and perhaps you need some\nexplanation on how being a people\npleaser is actually selfish let's break\nit down\nnumber one\nit consumes you leaving no room for\nanything else selfishness in its most\nbasic form is thinking of yourself and\nthat's what a full-on people pleaser\ndoes the majority of time and energy\nthat's spent on obsessing about what\nother people think of you the starting\nand endpoint of any thought up scenario\nis you and you 100 of your thoughts\nwhere other people are involved is based\non what can I say to fit in or how do I\nact so they view me in a good light or\nare grateful to me thoughts like what do\nthey actually need or how can their\nsituation be helped or squeezed out\nespecially if doing the right thing\ninvolves opening a can of Jack Bauer on\nsomeone\ntwo\nit's mainly about helping yourself and\nnot about helping them when someone asks\nfor a pleaser's input or opinion on\nsomething and their answer is carefully\ncurated like a bonsai tree only leaving\nin or embellishing the prettiest Parts\nwhilst discarding the rest entirely\nwho is that really for\nsure the asker feels superficially\nsatisfied but the real prize is a boost\nin self-esteem the pleaser gets by\nseeing their work flourish like I made\nthis moment happen I made them feel\nshiny and I am the light in the darkness\nI\nlet's not get carried away here\nwhy is this selfish\nbecause instead of taking responsibility\nfor their own self-worth they make\noutside scenarios for feeding perhaps\nit's from an extreme fear of rejection\nor conflict regardless the bottom line\nis still that the goal is a feeding\nSource rather than helping someone else\nin fact it's often harming the other\nperson in the long run because they've\nbeen essentially told a lie\nnumber three you look for approval and\nvalidation from others building off the\nlast point the people pleaser's own\ninsecurities make them constant external\nvalidation Hunters which involves also\nproactively baiting the trap for\napproval and not just responding nicely\nwhen asked for input\nas they are constantly worrying about\ngarnering disapproval or being dismissed\nby others the people pleaser will try to\nbe recognized and accepted by everyone\nthey may also perform random acts of\nwhat they think is pleasing expecting a\nreward for example a pleaser gives their\nfriend a truly random surprise gift not\nfor a reason like the friend was feeling\ndown and the gift might not be something\nthe friend ever wanted so the reaction\nmay be muted the people pleaser feels\nsulky and betrayed because they were\nangling for adulation and gratitude the\nhard truth is that we only control\nourselves our own thoughts and our\nreactions not others thoughts or\nreactions\nnumber four you start from a place of\nemptiness more like a vacuum The\nEmptiness of space\nthere's a need to be sated\nthat sweetness that's being offered\nisn't from a place of happiness and\nfulfillment there is no cake\nthe cake isn't just a lie it's an\nanglerfish lure drawing others in to\nfeed its belly healthy true pleasing\ncomes from when the person is whole\nsolid and happy with themselves their\nassistance is to share the joy growth\nand knowledge to spread goodness\nand number five you take away the\npersonal agency of others\ndefinitely help your friend if needed\nbut forcing help is another story The\noverbearing over helping does more harm\nthan good it enables and encourages\npeople to not do or think for themselves\nwhen the people pleaser insists on\nhelping despite their own needs and\nwants it sets up a situation where the\nother person owes the pleaser\npleaser is claiming responsibility of\nothers feelings thoughts and actions\nit's basically theft kudos to you for\nwatching and listening this video this\nvery well could mean that your heart is\nin the right place and you want to do\nbetter and help others\nthat starts with being good to yourself\nunderstanding that being truly good\nmeans finding and maintaining that\nmiddle ground between meeting other\npeople's needs and meeting your own it\ncan be tough especially if you've been\nfriendly on one side for a long while\nPro help is out there to guide you on\nthe path of authenticity so you're not\nwithout a map did any of these points\nmake you see your actions or another's\nactions in a different light what\nexamples of nice things are you\nwondering if they're just people\npleasing comment share discuss and tap\nthat like button but don't do it just to\nplease us do it if you truly like us\nthanks so much for watching and we'll\nsee you soon"
