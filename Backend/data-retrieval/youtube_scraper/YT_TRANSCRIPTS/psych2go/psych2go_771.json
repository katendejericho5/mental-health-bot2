    "transcript": "you just as you are can positively\ntransform the youth mental health space\nhere's how\ntoday we'll talk about the importance of\nLive And and living expertise for system\nchange\nI'm Monica and I'm a neuroscience\ngraduate and also a youth groundbreaker\nwhich you'll get to hear more about\nlater\nand today I am joined by Shawna and\nTravis from frame to discuss the value\nof your lived and living expertise\nwelcome both\nthank you so much for having us\nthank you so much for your time to be\nhere and to really talk to us about\nlived and living expertise and so to\nbegin let's just Dive Right In and start\noff with would you like to tell us a bit\nmore about frame\num and what you really think about\nliving and lived expertise\nsure I'm happy to start us off Monica\nand hello to everybody thanks for having\nus uh so frame is really a backbone\norganization across the Canadian youth\nmental health and substance use system\nwe're in the business of knowledge so\nwhat that means is that we really want\nto make sure that the best services and\nprograms and solutions for young people\nand their families and their communities\nare being shared and that others know\nwhat they are and how to use them and\nhow to maybe apply them in their context\nso a lot of what we do is about\nconnecting people building relationships\nand making sure that we have timely\nSolutions uh to the problems that are\nimpacting young people and their\nfamilies in real time today\nuh one of the things that we're really\ntrying to do at frame is we're trying to\npush forward this concept of knowledge\nmobilization or sharing knowledge in\nthat way so that we're thinking more\nabout knowledge equity and what we mean\nby that is that we're really valuing the\nexperiences of young people who have\nstruggled with mental illness or\nsubstance use challenges and we're\nintegrating their experience into the\nconversations into the policy that's\nbuilding the system and the way that it\nworks it's actually building the\nprograms and the solutions so when we\ntalk about lived expertise we really\nmean lived experience but I think we're\ngoing to talk a little bit more about\nwhy talking about it as expertise is\nvery important for the time that we're\nin right now and what we're trying to\nachieve but it's really that it's the\nexperience you hold as an individual\nthat has value to help us make better\nSolutions\nyeah maybe I'll just jump in and say\nthat a lot of what we do as an\norganization involves what's called\nknowledge mobilization you might have\nheard this uh called the knowledge\ntranslation or knowledge transfer but\nbut really it's all about the so what\nand now what right we know that\nin this sector a lot of research gets\ndone and then the findings come out and\nso it's sort of our job to say so what\nand now what right what can we do with\nthat knowledge how can we put it into\npractice to help people uh and I think\nsite to go is a great example of\nknowledge mobilization and translation\nright they take these amazing research\nfindings and translate them so that you\ncan understand them right and so that it\ncan be shared uh and put into practice\nso that's a lot of what we do at that\nframe\nso you're speaking about knowledge\nmobilization I think the really key\nconcept that you highlighted very well\nis how do we then integrate this living\nexperience or what people say living\nexpertise into knowledge translation and\nI say this kind of live expertise kind\nof lived experience interchangeably but\naren't they interchangeable or does it\nactually differ\nyeah I mean I think that the terms are\nused interchangeably part of the reason\nthat we talk about lived expertise as a\npart of experience as opposed to just\nexperiences we're really trying to push\nand change the rhetoric around that\nright I think lived uh experience is\nexpertise and we should value that\nexpertise just as much as any other\nexpertise and that includes you know\nproviding people say with honorarium and\ncompensation when they talk about their\nlived expertise and share that knowledge\nbecause just like you'd value any other\nexpertise and so that's that's sort of\nwhy we prefer that term\num there are different terms used across\nthe world I think in the UK for example\nthey use the term uh experts by\nexperience or expertise through\nexperience or experienced experts which\nI really like as well but but that's\nreally why we focus on that and and so\nframe uh the way that we work in\neverything that we do is we try to\ntriangulate evidence right and so\nthere's three sides to that triangle the\nfirst one being sort of the research and\nthe evidence and the academics what what\ndoes that say\nthe other side of the triangle is at the\nservice provision level so what are\nservice providers doing what are they\ndoing you know what are they doing in\ntreatment how do they conceptualize that\nthe evidence how's it being put into\npractice but then the third and arguably\nI would say the most important part of\nthat triangle is what are people saying\nwith lived and living expertise and how\ncan we further amplify their voices and\ncapture and use that knowledge\nyeah one thing I might add as well is\nthat part of what we think about when we\ntalk about lived expertise is the social\njustice movement behind including people\nwho access services within the designing\nof that service and to Travis's Point\nreally trying to create an understanding\nof the validity of that as something\nthat needs to be\nintegrated into how we think about what\nwe're going to do and so part of the\npush language is important and we know\nthis part of the push to decolonize our\nsystems of Health Service and to also\ncreate more accessible anti-racist\nsystems of service within youth mental\nhealth and substance use is to integrate\nthe experiences of those who have access\nservices or who are trying to access\nservices or maybe who haven't accessed\nServices because they haven't worked for\nthem and so this language piece is\nreally important we're talking about\nexpertise because we're also trying to\nbreak down these systems of hierarchy\nand dismantle them\num so that we're all coming together to\ninform what we want our systems to look\nlike and fundamentally our world to look\nlike so\nso we're really touching upon the\nimportance here of being able to include\nthe voices of those who have access\nservices or who have not accessed\nservices for whatever reasons or\nwhatever barriers and I'm just curious\nas if you can go into some of the\nresearch that point to the importance\nand the impact of including these voices\nyeah so I mean I\nI this gets intertwined with a concept\ncalled epistema side and epistema side\nis really the the sort of destroying or\ndevaluing of different knowledge systems\nand I would argue that you know in this\nin the world that we live in today we\nhave sort of devalued uh cultural\nknowledge traditional knowledge but also\nthe knowledge from lived and living\nexpertise and so when we look at the\nresearch and we say who you know who's\ndoing uh great work at really valuing\nthose voices and incorporating those\nvoices into say service design or\nprogram delivery\nDefine that\nby having those voices at the table by\nincluding them in a very meaningful way\nengaging them uh meaningfully that you\nproduce higher quality research more\nrelevant outcomes with practical impact\nyou increase the likelihood that you\nknow the products or treatments that\ncome from it will be accepted and then\nyou increase research trust in research\nand those organizations as well\num also though it's sort of a two-way\num it's a mutually beneficial process so\nthose people that also get to share\ntheir experiences and and get uh to\nshare their knowledge they get increased\nempowerment they get hope\num they get increased capacity\noftentimes they get increased training\nuh and and oftentimes they get they also\nget provided honorarium for sharing\ntheir knowledge too\num and do you have any thoughts on what\nmight some of that involvement look like\nbecause I've personally been involved in\nframes like very own initiatives but I\nwould love it to hear perhaps how other\npeople might be able to get involved as\nwell\nsure so there's there's lots of ways\nthat we can get involved and and folks\ncan get involved so Travis I can start\nand then maybe you can jump in because\nI'm sure there's there's pieces that\nI'll miss but I think there's things\nwithin frame but then there's also\nthings within the system more broadly or\nwith part our partner organizations that\nwe're really seeing\num this we're seeing a shift that folks\nare starting to understand that they\nhave to work in a different way\nresearchers policy workers service\nproviders there's more of an\nacknowledgment now than there ever was\npreviously in the mental health and\nsubstance use system that we need to\nintegrate the voices of Youth and their\nfamilies\num so with frame we have a network\ncalled groundbreakers so groundbreakers\nis a network of over 300 lived experts\nfrom across the country and we really\ntry to work with groundbreakers from\nacross kind of the country with\ndifferent levels of experience and\nexpertise different identities to help\nthem find\nOpportunities where they can leverage\ntheir lived experience and they can\nreally feel like it's being implemented\nin a meaningful way so sometimes that\nlooks like working with researchers who\nare working on a grant where we want to\nmake sure that it's actually informed by\nlived experience sometimes that means\nworking on a policy recommendations in\npartnership with service providers or\npolicy developers sometimes that means\nsupporting service providers when\nthey're trying to improve a program and\none of the things that we really want to\ntry to achieve with groundbreakers is\nthat deconstruction of hierarchy and\nvalue around different types of\nexperience so it's actually a\nfacilitated process that frames supports\nwhere we match young people and\ncaregivers with these opportunities and\nvice versa so that we're actually\ninforming all of the different types of\nefforts we're making to make things\nbetter with the perspectives of\neverybody in the experience of everybody\nso groundbreakers is open to anyone to\njoin so definitely folks can feel free\nto to check it out\num you can find it easily on our website\nand we have at this point over 300\npeople people that are part of\ngroundbreakers making it the program\nthat it is Monica you've worked with us\non groundbreakers before\num so that's one of the ways that we're\nreally trying to create a movement of\nlived experts and and articulating it as\nsuch because what we say when we're\nbringing we're kind of like working with\nwith folks that join groundbreakers is\nthat it's not only your lived expertise\num that brings value to the work but a\nlot of groundbreakers and a lot of young\npeople across this country hold lots of\ndifferent forms of expertise that can be\nvaluable in addition to their lived\nexpertise so part of it is also about\ninvesting in leaders of the future how\ndo we make sure that we're helping young\npeople achieve their own goals\num in the work that they're doing and\nleveraging their lived expertise to\nachieve that but not only sort of\nfocusing on their lived expertise as the\nmost critical piece they bring to the\ntable\nyeah I just wanted to add on as well\nbecause you mentioned groundbreakers and\nas a groundbreaker I think it's just\nbeen an absolutely amazing experience\num just as an example one of many things\nI've been involved involved with was the\nGrand adjudication LCL\num Grant and just to see how I got to\nincorporate my own experiences like\nnavigating the system getting to\ninteract with youth on the psych2go\nplatform and then seeing how that could\nbe translated into research that\nultimately forms the basis of policies\nand\num kind of changes that we'll see has\njust been incredible and it's really a\nprocess where I got to work with a bunch\nof different people with different\nexperiences as well so that's just one\nof the many things that I\num really really enjoyed and I also just\nwanted to mention too I think this\nstream in of itself which is a part of\nthe asking expert and ask an advocate\nstream really encourages you like as you\nknow listeners as Watchers to share your\nexperiences so if any of you watching\nwould like to come on and share your\nexperiences about I don't know going\nthrough the mental health kind of system\nbecause sometimes it can be very very\ndifficult then you know email me because\nI always want to find ways to get youth\ninvolved with the advocacy and creating\nhealthier spaces\nso that's my little first little note of\nthat and if there's anything else you'd\nlike to add Travis uh just to say to you\nthat you know sharing your lived in uh\nliving expertise it can be difficult\nright and not everybody's at the point\nwhere they where they can openly share\nthat or is willing to and so one of the\nthings that we do at frame and one thing\nthat's really important to us is to have\nsort of varying degrees of engagement\nright so you don't have to you know\nthere's this uh there's this idea of a\nladder or a traffic light system where\nthere's inappropriate types of\nEngagement and those are like tokenistic\ntypes of Engagement where maybe uh an\norganization will have a young person\ncome on as the token youth uh and they\nsee a few lines but then nothing really\nhappens with that knowledge you know\nthey're not really meaningfully engaged\nand we strive for Meaningful engagement\nin all we do and so sometimes\nwe're just looking to uh inform or\nconsult young people and there's\nmeaningful ways to do that uh and and\nsometimes uh us uh sells frame or our\npartners are looking to to to go all the\nway right to have youth sort of co-lead\nin true partnership uh creation of\nknowledge products or or or harnessing\ntheir knowledge uh and so when you do\nsign up for groundbreakers if you do\nhopefully you do uh you you'll you'll\nsee a whole range of opportunities right\nuh for you to engage with yeah and so\nwhatever you're most comfortable with uh\nwe encourage you to do so because we\nlove hearing we love hearing your lived\nin living expertise and we can do the\ngreat work that we do in system\ntransformation without without your\nvoices so yeah\nyeah I just wanted to also add that yeah\nmeaning meaningful engagement could look\nso different for everyone because for\none person being meaningfully engaged\nwould mean being informed of oneself of\nyou know what the system looks like how\nto actually access Services whereas for\nsomeone else it might be actually\nsharing their personal experiences so I\nthink that's a really important thing to\nhighlight and one thing that I found\nvery valuable through working with frame\nthrough working with psych2go and just\nthrough my studies\num that truly meaning is different for\neveryone and all of them all the\ndifferent forms are valid\nI think a really nice piece like around\nengagement and what's really important\nis that this kind of sentiment that\nClarity is kindness right so whatever\nway you can engage as an organization or\nas a group of people and whatever the\nscope of that work is being clear about\nthat up front with young people that\nyou're working with is really important\nI think Monica to your point people have\nwhen people have different expectations\ncoming into something and those aren't\nclarified from the beginning it can\nreally start to feel like a tokenistic\nexperience or one that isn't lining up\nwith what you expected or what you had\nhoped for and to Travis's earlier Point\naround what is the value of being\nengaged and these these Sentiments of\nyou know feeling hopeful feeling\nempowered and feeling like you're\ncreating impact we're going to erode\nthat if we don't have that Clarity and\nthat agreement that shared agreement\nfrom the very beginning\nso we really talked about the forms of\num sharing lived experience lived\nexpertise and then we talked about the\nimportance of doing so so if people are\nwatching now and really are asking\nwhat's the next step how can I myself\ncapitalize on sharing my loot expertise\nwhat would you say to love\nI think there's a few things for folks\nto consider too because one of the I\nthink one of the really important\nReflections that we've heard from a lot\nof Youth experts yourself included\nMonica is that an individual's\nexperience doesn't equate to an entire\ncommunity of young people's experiences\nyouth aren't homogeneous youth have\nreally different experiences even if\nthey have a shared\ndiagnosis or they have a shared\nexperience in a system\num and so I think one of the things\nthat's really important in terms of\ngetting involved is really thinking\nabout what's the piece of your lived\nexperience that you feel willing to\nshare safe to share prepared to share\nand in what ways and what are you hoping\nto achieve\num by sharing it and I think another\nthing that's really important for us to\nthink about you know and I have lived\nexperience as well and every time I\nthink about sharing my own lived\nexperience\num you have the right and you should\nfeel you have the permission\nuh to share it or to not and in terms of\nthe circles that you've been kind of\nbrought into and one of the things that\nI think we're really trying to think\nabout in terms of um engaging with lived\nexperts is that you know sometimes we\ncan put out\num a request and say hey we need some\nfolks that have this type of lived\nexperience to help us build something\nbetter\num and it's up to that person to\nself-identify and then we don't really\nhave a right to continue to ask them to\nbring that lived experience every time\nwe're working with them in that capacity\nwe know that they have that lived\nexperience and it's informing the work\nthat they do\num and so you I don't think that you\nhave to lead with your lived experience\nevery time in every situation even if\nit's something that's being\num that's informing that work or a value\nto that work and feel empowered for that\nif you know feel empowered to put\nboundaries around how and when you share\nyour lived experience and make sure it\nalways feels safe I think safety is an\nongoing\nassessment piece for individuals um and\nit might have felt good to work with a\ngroup of people or an organization at\none point in time and then through the\nlife of that work or over time it\ndoesn't feel good anymore and that's\nokay as well\num but there's definitely ways I think\nright now that folks can if they if\nthey're feeling like those pieces are\nthere for them and they want to they\nwant to integrate their lived experience\nthere's definitely ways so Travis maybe\nI'll let you speak to that a little bit\nyeah in terms of you know if you really\nwant to use your voice and to help\num help shape the system into what you\nwant it to be you want to be the change\nthat you want to see in the world I\nthink finding local Grassroots\norganizations right mental health\norganizations can be a very powerful way\nfor you to get your your knowledge out\nthere\num but more more than that too I think\nthere's a lot of power in storytelling\ntelling stories uh and and this doesn't\nhave to be your personal story right it\ncould be the story of experiences of\nothers but really\num\ntelling a story helps people empathize\nwith the situation understand it uh and\nand helps them remember it so that they\ncan tell it to others as well and so um\nsharing your story in a safe way can be\na very powerful way to get your\nknowledge and lived expertise out to the\nsystem uh getting it shared and getting\nit used\nhow does storytelling really look like\nbecause I think I guess for some people\nwho might be sharing their stories for\nthe first time it's hard to know where\nto spilly start\nyeah I think that's such a great and\npertinent question Monica and I I think\neven as you've like you're someone who's\nmaybe shared your story for years it's\nstill something that kind of comes up is\nhow do I how do I share my story and how\ndo I keep sharing it in a meaningful way\nand I think there's a few things that I\nwould recommend for folks that are maybe\nthinking about sharing their story or\nthey want to start sharing their story\nand one is really about about again\nunderstanding purpose what's your\npurpose in sharing your story is like a\nfirst step would you what change do you\nwant to see\num by sharing it and do you feel\ncomfortable expressing that change to\nfolks so if you're coming in to an\nopportunity and sharing your lived\nexperience\num can you be clear about I'm sharing my\nlived experience for this reason this is\nwhat I want to see come out of it\num because people's stories aren't\nreally just there for consumption\nuh right and I think that's really\nimportant is if you're sharing your\nlived experience you have a right to\nexpect that it's being shared with\nimpact\num and that you want to see that impact\ndelivered so we're holding we're holding\nthose that we're sharing our lived\nexperience with accountable you know\nyou're giving a gift and it's a personal\nit's a very personal gift\num to help make things better so having\nexpectations of how that looks I think\nare reasonable one of the ways that you\nmight want to start\num definitely like Travis spoke a lot\nabout groundbreakers which is a great\nway to get connected not even just a\nframe but to others to understand what\nthe sector looks like Monica's here\nshe's offered for folks to reach out\nwith her I'd say look for your Champions\num look for the organizations and the\nindividuals who are trying to create\nPathways for lived expertise to be\nintegrated into the work and into the\nsystem\num we're here to help we want to help we\nwant to provide platforms for your voice\nto be heard so definitely look for those\nChampions\num and ask\num I think is another really important\npiece\num and I think Monica you're sharing\nsome stuff so that's great\num providing specific Avenues but I\nthink one that's definitely one of the\npieces that can be most effective and\nalso young people are a force across\nthis country\num in Canada and Beyond right I know you\nhave folks from from around the world as\nwell and I think that\num the networks you create together are\nsome of the most powerful mechanisms\num\nand finding out how you can really\nleverage your voice and one of the other\nthings the kind of the last thing I'd\nsay about that is you don't have to\nleverage your voice in isolation\num find your communities find your\nnetworks and and band together to share\nCollective stories and to\num kind of demand Collective action so\nyour voice doesn't have to be a soul\nvoice it can be a community voice\nthere's also I want to add a really\ngreat resource on the frame website we\nhave this uh this program called our\nfellowship our knowledge mobilization\nfellowship program and last year uh two\nof our fellows so these are two\ngroundbreakers that were sort of uh\nchampioned and and uh created a\nknowledge product based on a need in the\nsystem they created this document called\nthe ask document which which I can share\nin a little bit later and what the ask\ndocument is is it's a document for you\nto take with you in any engagement\nopportunity to ask the tough questions\nright of those that you're engaging with\nto know am I being meaningfully engaged\nor am I being tokenistically engaged\nright because sometimes it might be hard\nto figure out like what questions to ask\nand what should my expectations be as a\nperson with lived in living expertise\nbeing engaged with and so this document\nis really a sort of reflective uh\npamphlet for you to work through with\nthose to try to tell you you know uh am\nI being meaningful engaged or how could\nthis how could this be better so that\nI'm sharing my story with purpose and\nthat you know I I'm making an impact\nthrough sharing my knowledge\nexactly I think there's just to what you\nsaid earlier Sean and Travis just so\nmuch power in Collective action and\nfinding a community that really\nresonates with you\num just within the mental health space\nthere are folks who have perhaps\nexperienced I don't know loss who have\nexperience big changes in their life and\nthen within that sub-community there's\num probably people who have experienced\nthe exact same thing as used to really\nspeak to the point that you're not alone\nand uh one great one great Avenue is to\nreally get involved with the ground\nBaker's Network I mentioned it earlier\nbut I'll link leave a link in the\ndescription box as well other good\ncommunities\num I know kids help phone is also they\nhave a wonderful wonderful resource\nwhere you can talk to counselors there's\nchild's helpline International for those\nwho are located internationally and we\nalso have a Discord on psych2go it's\ndiscord.gg it's like to go for are\npeople all around the world to really\nshare their experiences and if for those\nwho are Keen to come in person and\nlocated in Vancouver there is the\nwonderful conference coming up I will\nleave it to Shauna and Travis to tell\nyou more about that because at week\npresent uh virtually though and so will\ntons of other Advocates and those\npassionate about youth mental health\nchange\nthanks Monica yeah so next week we have\nour learning Institute\num in Vancouver BC but we also have a\nvirtual\num option so we're doing a hybrid event\nand really our learning Institute\nhighlights all of the incredible work\nthat's happening across Canada\num and Beyond in the youth mental health\nand substance use sector and this year\nwe're expecting a lot of Youth Advocates\num so real leaders\num who have experience in sharing their\nlived expertise to create system\ntransformation so it's a great\nopportunity if folks are in the\nVancouver area as Monica said\num or may be interested in traveling for\nthe conference it's two days\nwith a meet and greet pizza party the\nfirst night if you want to come a half a\nday early and join us which will be all\nthe the youth groundbreakers\num having a having a bit of a\ncelebration before the event but it's a\ngood opportunity to really meet other\nyoung people who who have experience\nadvocating and using their lived\nexpertise so a great learning\nopportunity for those who are interested\nin potentially starting to share their\nstory and also a great connection\nopportunity for those that maybe have\nsome experience doing that and want to\nwant to meet with other youth Advocates\nso that's happening you can find more\ninformation on our website and the kind\nof theme this year that we're really\nfocusing on is how do we build\npartnership and collaboration\nacross the sector so to Travis's very\nearly Point around triangulation of\nevidence and working with service\nproviders and researchers scientists\nyoung people their families and their\ncommunities and cultural experts coming\nall together to really understand where\nhave we seen success in that uh across\nthis country and Beyond so that we can\nlearn how to keep doing that and\ncontinue to do a better job at that\nforeign\nyeah I just want to add a little plug to\nthat that our final plenary session of\nthe conference we'll be uh talking\nspecifically about storytelling and uh\nyou might recognize some of the people\nat that plenary because uh site to go uh\nwill also be giving a talk at that final\nplenary so so that is wonderful and\nwe're so glad to have uh psych2go uh\nbeing present uh but if you join\ngroundbreakers it's free to join Brown\nBreakers by the way if you join\ngroundbreakers then you can sign up for\nthe virtual conference for just twenty\ndollars Canadian so uh cheaper for the\nthe Americans uh listening but uh but\nyes uh and it'll be great experience and\nwe we're also having a special\nnetworking session for virtual uh\nattendees as well so encourage everybody\nto sign up\nyes and with that I'm so so grateful\nthat both of you came to really share\nyour expertise on how to get involved\nand what meaningful engagement really\nlooks like and I'm just really thankful\nfor everything so thank you so much\nthank you thank you so much Shawna and\nuh yeah thank you so much also the\npsych2goers for watching I just wanted\nto before I leave to highlight that yeah\neveryone here I think you and I and yeah\ntruly everyone can bring so much lived\nexpertise just as you are and should you\nchoose to get involved in whatever\ncapacity there are resources there\num we've listed a couple of them in the\nStream so feel free to go back and watch\nthem\ngroundbreakers the learning Institute\num searching online for your local\norganization simply just sending out an\nemail and seeing you know this is my\nexperience I'd love to help through XYZ\nand just being proactive and so that's\nall from me uh thank you so much again\nand if you have got any other comments\nor thoughts you can leave in the comment\nsection and I will try to get back to\nyou all\nthanks everyone bye thanks for having us\non thank you bye"
