    "transcript": "hi everyone so there's a lot of\nmisconceptions around neurological and\npsychiatric conditions that sometimes\nit's really hard to tell apart facts\nfrom fiction\nI'm Monica and I host the ask an expert\nSeries where we aim to tackle these\nmisconceptions\num specifically about Psychiatry and\nneurology with experts\nand today our topic is Tourette Syndrome\nwhile we can get the radical information\nfrom things like books or from Googling\nI think there's so much value in\nbringing clinicians who have worked with\npeople with Tourette Syndrome or other\nkind of associated conditions and those\nwith lift expertise to join this\nconversation and so today I would like\nto give you all a welcome again to our\nexpert Nathan Peterson hello hello hi\nthanks for for bringing me back I love\nbeing here\nthank you so much for coming back and\nfor sharing your expertise\nso for everyone who has not yet\num watched your last stream or husband\nor channel would you like to tell\neveryone about kind of what kind of\nthings you do\nyeah and I have a whole YouTube channel\nbased off of OCD anxiety ticks and\nTourette's hair pulling and skin picking\nand I I picked this realm because I\nfound there weren't too many videos that\nwere online talking about these things\nand I love my goal is to make it all\nsimple like as easy as possible for\npeople to understand and and so far it's\nbeen doing well I really enjoy it it's\nuh\nsimple defined OCD and anxiety\nis the channel name\namazing yes it's linked in the\ndescription box and yeah let's just dive\nin because I feel also that having gone\nthrough post-grad Tourette's was never\nsomething that people brought up so it's\nsomething that's commonly misunderstood\nsome people might not even know what it\nis so I guess in simple words what is\nTourette's syndrome\nyeah well I know we we see things online\nor movies or TV shows Tick Tock is one\nthat kind of started some Trends on on\nyou know Tourette Syndrome but you know\nthere are a lot of misconceptions as\nwell\nI know it's a neurological disorder and\nso it's something that you know still a\nlot of people are trying to understand\nexactly what's happening in the brain\nwhat we do know is that\nyou know I had a neurologist kind of\nshare this with me that it's almost like\nthere there's a signal in the brain that\nis being sent\num they use the the basal ganglia I\ndon't want to get too technical\nfor the brain but it says like the the\nstop signals that are supposed to tell\nthe brain like keep going or or don't\nkeep going it's kind of faulty and so\nthere's a signal that's being sent in\ntheir brain and it's almost like it\nneeds to jump over this little hump is\nthe way they explain it jump over\nbecause it's the connection is just not\nmade fully and so that means that the\nthe brain and body is compensating in\nsome way so it's doing doing either a\nbody movement or a vocal movement uh\nwhere somebody might be you know moving\ntheir eyebrows or their eyes or they\ncould be saying something out loud or\ngrunting or breathing really loudly out\nof their nose and\na lot of times it's involuntary the\nperson doesn't even know they're doing\nit\num someone else might bring it to their\nattention like hey did you know that\nyou've been blinking a lot and sometimes\nthey just don't know\nit usually starts when somebody's a\nlittle bit younger I know doctors\nlook for it\na non-said before somebody is 18 years\nold and so\neach person is different but they\nusually don't diagnose it as\nyou know an issue until somebody has\nthese ticks lasting for a year or longer\nand so something that I didn't know\nuntil I started working with this is\nthat a lot of a lot of people actually\nhave tics a lot of kids will have a tick\nand maybe it lasts a day it lasted two\ndays three days could be a few weeks but\nthen it just kind of goes away and it's\na quick thing where all of a sudden I'm\nlike blinking a little bit and then my\nbody just compensates and figures it out\nand moves on develops for some people\nthe brain doesn't do that and\nand that's where you know they they have\nTourette's Syndrome\num\nwhich mainly has those vocal ticks\nconnected to it and what we normally see\non on TV I'm just like rambling here\nbecause I love talking about it but what\nwe normally see is people are like\nswearing or they're you know saying\nthings really really loudly and that's\njust like a small little piece of the\npuzzle a lot of vocal ticks are grunting\nuh or just making a humming noise or it\ncould be just anything that comes out of\ntheir mouth\num and that's a super super quick\nrundown of kind of like what a what a\ntick or yeah what a tick looks like\nokay so essentially it's like it's a\nneurological condition marked by these\ninvoluntary movements or what ticks you\nknow like that's the word for it and uh\nplease correct me if I'm wrong about in\nmy summaries I'm just trying to also\nmake sense with it and learn alongside\neveryone\num and it usually starts when people are\nyounger\num kind of the etiology you would say is\nlike because of the inhibitory\nmechanisms not quite working in the\nbrain and the basal gangla you were\nsaying and that manifests in\nbunch of different kind of takes so like\nvocal takes some other kinds and yeah I\nsee okay\nI mean what we do know is it tends to be\ngenetic and so\nsomewhere somewhere down the family line\nsomebody could have ticks they could\nhave uh OCD they could have anxiety kind\nof on that same family tree and so\nusually doesn't just come out of the\nblue you know no one's ever had it in\ntheir family kind of thing uh\nand so that's that's one marker I know a\nlot of doctors look for is like well\nlet's look at your family history to see\nif if you've had this before and\nfor a lot of people if they do it\nactually tends to go away uh\nby the time they're 25 you know the\nbrain starts developing but if it\ndoesn't but around that time it's it's\nlikely that it'll probably will stick\naround for a little bit longer maybe\ntheir whole life and but that's that's\nwhere treatments there for some people\ndon't need to do treatment we\nit's a little bit different than kind of\nthe traditional like let's stop this\nthing\num there's a lot that goes to it of like\nactually if you don't want to stop it\nlet's just embrace you being you\nand I think we we see that sometimes on\na\nlot of different shows people have just\ncompletely embraced it and that's just\nwho they are and it's not a shameful\nthing it just is what it is\nright and so I think\num one kind of question that came up in\nmy mind as you were kind of explaining\nyou know the the treatments and things\num and questions that came up from the\ncommunity was that how common is trust\nsyndrome how often do people have it\nwhat's the prevalence and how often do\npeople who have it see treatment\nit's a great question\nI know\nI mean I wish I had this this is stats\nready here but I can tell you that there\nare very few therapists or Specialists\nthat actually work with it uh if you go\nto the you know Tourette's website you\ncan kind of see a list of providers\nthere and there's like two or three or\nfour sometimes in one area\num and there are a lot of people seeking\nhelp usually I see a parent bringing in\ntheir child and that's that's the most\ncommon thing that I see it it's a lot\nmore prevalent than than we would think\nI know\nif a lot of people are really good at\nhiding it and so most of the people I\ntalk to who say well does anyone in your\nclass know that you do this and they're\nlike no I'm really good at hiding it no\none no one even knows I'm like well how\nmany others are in there they're hiding\nit as well that you don't even know\nit's it's you know super General answer\nbut it's way more common than we think\nand I as I mentioned at the beginning a\nlot of people like huge percentage of\npeople will have a tick for a day or two\nor three and then not and then switch it\nto something else and then it goes away\nit's kind of the way that the bodies or\nsorry the brain is developing in that\nmoment and and that's just how it works\nso let's use this opportunity also to\ntackle another kind of common question\num someone thought that it was a forever\nthing I really had no idea about\num the how long it lasts that you were\nsaying that typically by 25 if it's not\ngone it would be long lasting is that\ncommon or what does the disease progress\nor process look like yeah a lot of times\nticks come and then they go and then\nsometimes they go and they don't come\nback the brain is making all those\nneural connections and and like hey this\nis good we figured it out on our own\nwithout having to really do treatment\nbut there are a lot of people where it\nis a lifelong and\nfrom from what I've seen in the research\nthey they don't worry about it too much\nuntil the brain is fully developed and\nthen they can see a lot of markers for\nthis is going to last a little bit\nlonger maybe your whole life at this\npoint just because that's just how how\nthe brain is and but there is really\ncool treatment that can help people\nlearn what to do with it even if it is\nlong term even if they have it their\nwhole life there's treatment to help\nthem reduce even the urge to do the tick\nand\nyeah live the life they they want to\nlive or the treatment is\nlike I said totally embrace yourself and\nbe okay if you make a noise out in\npublic you make a noise if you don't\nthen you don't then love yourself no\nmatter what\nwhat are the other treatment mechanisms\nor treatment methods that\num people typically use uh so you\nmentioned one just embracing it does it\nget to a point where it's so\ndebilitating that something has to be\ndone because it interferes with their\nlife I would imagine so unfortunately\nyeah you know so the the treatment that\nwe use is called C bit cbit and it\nstands for the comprehensive behavioral\nintervention for ticks and it's really\nlike the treatment for ticks and really\nwhat it's all about is\nhelping someone really recognize why\nthey're doing it uh because if they\ndon't know they're doing it it's hard to\nstop it and so awareness training is the\nfirst the first part it's knowing that I\nI have to be really aware when this is\nhappening what my triggers are so if\nit's at school or if I'm taking a math\ntest or if I'm playing a video game it\nhappens a little bit more or it's when\nmy sister yells at me or you know\nwhatever it is we literally kind of have\na tracking sheet and we look through\neverything what are the emotions what\nare the feelings what are the triggers\nand then once we know all of that we\nlook at\ncreating what's called a competing\nresponse I'm going through this really\nquick because we don't have much time\nbut\ncompeting response really is how can I\nmake this\nso inconvenient or harder for me to do\nthe tick that my brain learns that I\ndon't need to actually do it so an\nexample might be you know there's\nsomething that's called a pre-monitoring\nurge it's an urge that somebody gets\nbefore the tick happens and the way I\nusually try to explain it is like if you\nare doing a staring contest with\nsomebody and you're really just focusing\non it there's a point where your body is\ngoing to start saying you better blink\nyou gotta blink you gotta blink it's\nreally uncomfortable and the eyes are\nstarting to water and you can feel it\nand it's almost like unbearable but it\ndidn't start unbearable\nit it gets there at some point and so\nthat's kind of that urge that people are\nfeeling is like I have to do it whatever\nit is and I don't feel relief until I do\nit and so what we what we do with the\ntreatment\nis with you use these competing\nresponses which it could be let's say my\ntick is blinking so I'm like blinking\nblinking competing response would be I'm\ngoing to really focus on my eyes and I\nmight be looking straight ahead and I'm\ngoing to do really like methodical\nblinking so maybe every like five\nseconds 10 seconds you know every\nperson's different we blink and we feel\nthat urge from probably zero to ten like\nhow badly do I want to you know make\nthis movement and if it's a let's say\nit's a six out of ten I'm going to do\nthis methodical blinking until that urge\ngoes down usually by half or more and we\ndo that for at least a minute or longer\nif we can and then\nyou know that's just a quick example but\ncompeting responses can be anything it\ncould be you know touching my chin it\ncould be playing with a fidget\nit could be anything like touching even\nthe muscle so even if I'm doing a\ncompeting response with you know a tick\nthat's on my face I can still play with\na fidget it has nothing to do with my\nface but I'm really focusing on this\nmoment and the important part is we're\nnot sitting there and saying like don't\ndo it don't do it don't do it don't do\nit because the more we do that the more\nthe body is actually going to want to do\nthe tick so instead we reframe it as I\ncould totally do this right now but I'm\njust actually choosing not to and\nso it's sitting through that distress\nthat urge and allowing that to reduce\nall on its own and it starts retraining\nthe brain which is a really cool part\nlike it literally retrains it to say hey\nI I know I told you the only way to feel\nbetter and feel relief is to do it but\nyou didn't do it and you actually feel\nbetter so like something's up here I\nneed to learn from this experience that\nmaybe I need to stop sending you as many\nurges because you're just not giving\ninto it\num one thing that is interesting about\nit is\nit often once we start working on one\ntick so it could be someone's clenching\ntheir jaw or their their nose twitching\nor their arm is moving and we start you\nknow good competing responses like\nholding your holding your arm or or\nmaking a fist the brain's like okay fine\nif you're not gonna do that one let me\nswitch it over to this other one and\noften wants to switch somewhere else in\nthe body trying to like get you fine if\nyou're not doing that let me compensate\nover here and and that's what it loves\nto do so we're prepared for like all the\nticks for anything that comes our way\num\nand an important piece is is taking that\nshame away from it as well that\nwe don't want the person to be like Oh\nI'm still doing the tick and now\neveryone's judging me and I'll never get\nbetter and now my parents you know we\nactually there's a lot of\nself-compassion that comes along with it\nof just like man if you do it you do it\nand cool you did it and if you want to\nstop let's learn from that experience\nand figure out what we're going to do\nnext time that you feel that urge and we\nknow what happens in the car a lot so\nwe're going to be really prepared for\nthose competing responses or and we work\nup to\njust making this more of a lifestyle for\nsomebody and you know to that person's\nquestion it's all it is sometimes a\nlifelong thing and so someone might be\ndoing competing responses their whole\nlife but at the beginning it might be a\nlot but then it it gets smaller and gets\nsmaller where it's maybe every once in a\nwhile they're doing one maybe they're\nletting some ticks go every once in a\nwhile because we've learned to just say\ncool whatever it is what it is\num but my important thing for me is like\nif it's not interfering in their life\nmaybe it's not something they really\nneed to change too much\nand I know you asked another question\nbut I uh forgot what you said\nno that's super super descriptive I I\nlearned something new like cbit so step\none really recognizing it because\nsometimes the person themselves don't\nrecognize that they are exhibiting some\ntics and then number two step two I\nguess uh coming up with a competing\nresponse and then interestingly I think\num the thing that really gave me like a\nparallel close parallel was\num that with OCD because you were\nmentioned I mean I have no idea about\nthe the ideology and all that but the\nfact that there's some kind of\nlike urge to act something else so like\na compulsion like you gotta act out the\ncompulsion to stop the session sort of\nthing gave me a bit of a parallel in the\nfact that\num both of them kind of used similar\nsort of I say similar but sort of\nsimilar sort of treatment mechanisms uh\nI think yeah it was something really\ncool so I wonder if there's any any\nrelationship there with OCD yeah there\ndefinitely is\num it's on the same tree it's so family\ntree of\nthere's a lot of people who have OCD who\nalso have ticks and sometimes the tick\ncan actually be a compulsion for\nsomebody and sometimes it it's just a\nplain old you know tick where the person\nfeels the urge and and they do it\nsometimes people have a really hard time\nrecognizing an urge because they've\nnever really paid attention to it and so\nthat's why it's you know people might do\nliterally hundreds in an hour and not\neven realize they're doing it and other\npeople know every single time and so\njust even being aware\nwe might set timers throughout the day\nthat go off and say be mindful and it\nmight be five minutes I'm just going to\npay attention to my body and see how I'm\nfeeling and every time I feel an urge\nmaybe I put my finger up just to\nindicate oh I'm noticing oh yeah I'm\nnoticing oh I'm noticing and we might\nnot try to stop any ticks of that moment\nwe're just gonna learn how the body's\nfeeling and be really good at it\nand that that really is a huge component\nto it is just like we've got to know how\nit's happening and we know that math\ntest is coming up we're going to be\nprepared for it and you know we often\nwork with that anxiety as well sometimes\nthere is anxiety\nthat's going to be a huge component and\nwhy somebody is doing some of these\nticks and so it's a whole well\nwell-rounded approach we've got to take\ncare of all of it and so we can reduce\nsome of these stressors and and triggers\nin someone's life\nlots of questions\num just based on based off of what you\nsaid\num the first one being does the severity\nof the ticks correlate with the duration\nof the treatment length in order to see\nremitted symptoms and can they be\nremitted like eventually completely of\nsomeone who's very very serious like\nmaybe having like 100 some tics and I\ndon't know an hour or so that becomes so\ndebilitating what does that really look\nlike then yeah that's an awesome\nquestion I know\nwhen I first started working with this I\nwas thinking okay well this person came\nin they only have like three ticks I\nthink we you know this is going to go\nquick and this other person is doing a\nlot of different multiple like complex\nticks is what they call it\num they're doing so many so man they're\ngoing to be in here for a long time and\nI realize that what's really cool is\nlike the treatment tends to work for\nthose who tend to for those who try it\nand do it\nand I know the protocol people have\ndifferent protocols but I typically\nstick to kind of a 12-week protocol and\nit's like we're going to do awareness\ntraining for a while we're going to\nwrite out all the competing responses\nwhen you're going to practice them\nthe ideal thing would be anytime you're\nfeeling an urge to do it incentives are\ngreat for parents to give based off of\ntreatment if their child is doing it\nand\nwe we just like knock it out and we we\ndo it for every single urge if we can if\nwe miss them that's cool too\nBut ultimately what I find is you know\nto kind of answer the question\nI see the treatment work the same for\nsomeone who has really really complex\ntics versus someone who's just really\nsimple in what they're doing\num they might have to work a little bit\nharder because it's you know it's\nhappening a lot per minute and\nyou know so that that might be a little\nbit tougher I guess just to figure out\nthe competing responses for them to do\nbut I do find that once they start\nworking on it it can be really hard but\nit does get easier it's a skill that\nthat has to be learned and\num those who I've seen kind of soar and\ndo really well are ones who came back\nand they're like man I did it as much as\nI could I set up set my timers and I was\nready to go and other people are like I\ndid it once and it didn't work and it's\nnot working for me I'm like well that's\nnot how it works it's a skill we gotta\npractice it often and I have seen some\npeople where they've tried really really\nhard at the treatment and it still isn't\nworking that well and that that's the\nthe part that like dang it like I wanted\nthis to work so bad\nthat's where sometimes people look at\nmedications which we've shown for ticks\nsometimes don't work as well as we'd\nhope\num\nand so it's finding are there other\nthings that are happening whether it's\nADHD or OCD that's connected to this\njust to kind of find out\num yeah yeah where you at and what can\nwe do with it\nand so cbit is that also used for adults\nas well because you we've I think we\nmade it clear that it's also used for\ndifferent severities\num but it's used for the same\ndemographics as well yeah yeah and for\nthe adults that I see it seems like\nthey're more motivated to to do it\nbecause they know like I have to do it I\nmean I've come in here I'm paying the\nmoney I gotta I gotta work on this stuff\nfor kids it's usually their parents that\nare bringing them in that are like I\ncan't keep hearing them make this noise\nat the dinner table or whatever it is\nand and so there's a there's a lot of\nbuy-in that a therapist has to do with\nthe child to be like why is this worth\nit for you to to want to stop and\nso there might be a lot of kind of like\nmotivational interviewing with the with\nthe individual and like figure out what\nit's worth for them and the the hard\npart is\nIf the child doesn't want to stop we\ncan't force it and so we have to teach\nthe parents to ignore it which is like\nthe most horrible answer most of them\nare like no you can't tell me that like\nI can't just ignore it but but we have\nto\num\nand a lot of parents don't like that but\nif we don't ignore it it ends up\nbringing a lot of Shame a lot of guilt\nto the individuals some anxiety because\nthey they can't stop it it'd be easy\njust to say stop but they can't and so\nthere's sometimes a lot of training for\nthe parents as well of what their role\nis and all of this and\nI mean the simple answer is don't bring\nit up unless\nit's part of the treatment plan to say\noh we came up with this together use\nevery day at four o'clock I'm supposed\nto do this and if I'm sitting on the\ncouch like you can remind me but your\nyour job isn't to say stop it stop doing\nthat go somewhere else or we won't bring\nany shame to it and it's hard as a\nparent I'm sure to to just sit back and\nhear all the noises or see the ticks but\nif that person's living a happy\nlife then that's the important part is\nlike let him do the ticks Let Him Live a\nhappy life that's kind of the other\naspect of the treatment is being really\nrealistic of\nwhat do we actually need to do\num maybe we're just reducing ticks 25 of\nthe time and the rest of the time we're\ngood\nit's not an All or Nothing approach\nsometimes\nall right so it's pretty holistic in\nterms of including the patient but also\ntheir families or whoever their\ncaregivers are so that's quite\ninteresting to know as well and you also\nmentioned that there were\npharmacological treatments as well\num so is it kind of that if cbit doesn't\nwork then they go to pharmacological or\nis it like in conjunction what is the\nyeah combination you know since I since\nI don't prescribe anything my my\nthoughts are always like let's really\ntry the treatment first like just do it\nso well and we have really good evidence\nthat we've we've done it\num and if not then maybe go see a\npsychiatrist to see if a lot of people\nwill try\num natural things first uh NAC is a very\npopular one\num I know I always botched the name of\nit I don't know I'm going to try NAC you\ncan look it up online\num and if you can say it I'll be very\nimpressed\noh and acetylcystole there you go and\nacetylcysteine sorry yeah yeah yeah\nI just I've tried to say that in one of\nmy videos and I said it like probably 15\ntimes had to redo yeah okay\na lot of people try that\num there is some research some people\nworks really well other people not so\nmuch some people will try something like\ninositol as well that's another natural\num and I'm seeing that actually more in\nmultivitamins for kids they're just like\nthrowing that in there\nhow effective are they\nuh-huh\nfrom from what I've seen\nnot as effective as I would like it to\nbe some people it's just like man this\nworked really well other people not but\nit's like seems like it's worth a try if\nthat's what someone wants to do\num according to the research it showed\nlike not as effect not the effect of\nthis is not as great\num as we would hope\nsome people try ssris\nand that has seen some effect but still\nthe treatment tends to be the best the\nbest method okay yeah ssris tend to be\nused for a lot of things I just realized\nwhen I was looking out to study the\ndrugs\num yeah they use it for anxiety\ndepression I saw some people use it for\nlike\num Eating Disorders as well it just\nseems like the indication is\nvery very wide so it's I think it's a\nbit difficult to know what kind of\nTarget\nit's supposed to Target given that it's\nused for so much so many very\nheterogeneous disorders it's true yeah\nbut I definitely see how cvit is more\ntargeted for Tourette's so yeah in full\nsupport of starting with that it's not\nlike I make the make the guidance lines\nor anything but it's always good to to\ntry any different things and see what\nworks\nyeah\nand are there any other kind of\ntreatments apart from cbit that\npeople focus on in terms of Tourette\nsyndrome\nyeah I know that tends to be kind of\nthat like that is the the treatment that\nreally works uh often we use exposure\nand response prevention if there is\nanxiety of some kind or if there are any\nobsessions where we are literally facing\nvarious fears and we're teaching\nsomebody to respond to it in a different\nway so it might be\num let's go to class and sit next to\nthat person you're really nervous\nyou're going to do the tick necks too\nand we're going to just actually learn\nto be more uncertain if you're going to\ndo it or not and your job isn't to like\nsit there and try not to do it it's\nactually just be like if it happens it\nhappens if it doesn't it doesn't\num\nand then we challenge some people we\nlearn to challenge thoughts using\ncognitive behavioral therapy of\nlike let's let's go through any thinking\nerrors you have or any unhelpful\nthinking\nthoughts and we're going to challenge it\nand the way I typically challenge\ndifferent thoughts is\nif the first thought that comes to my\nbrain\nif I can actually prove it and prove it\nmeans that like I'm standing in front of\nJudge Judy and I have to prove it like\nwould I win the case or not and it's a\nlot of thoughts where we're working on\nlike someone's going to judge me at the\nstore if I make a noise or\num this person's gonna laugh at me or\nnobody likes me because I'm doing these\nthings we're like okay well I actually\nhave to prove it and I have to use\nevidence for and against and kind of go\nthrough that whole process of just\nteaching the brain to live life let\nthings be and\nsometimes bad things do happen sometimes\npeople do laugh and we work through that\nas well\num some sometimes the treatment is all\nabout responses as well how can I\nrespond to somebody at school that says\nsomething about my tick or\num you know can I give them a little\ncard that I made that says hey look this\nis what Tourette's is or whatever it is\nso it's working through just like let\nthe person be them and any other aspect\nof their life that's not going well we\nwant to work on that as well\nI really love the last part it goes to\nspeak about the importance of awareness\nfor psychiatric neurological conditions\nbecause I feel like lots of times people\ndon't quite know what Tourette syndrome\nis or any sort of disorder so when\npeople kind of look at someone else and\nnot really understand it comes from more\nof a place of just not knowing rather\nthan anything malicious so I think if\npeople really take the time to\nunderstand what other people might be\ngoing through that could be much more\nyou know quieted down that aspect of it\nso I'm really glad that you're able to\ncome and chat with us to help educate\npeople and to tackle a lot of\nmisinformation around Tourette's\nsyndrome and I know you do a lot of\nthings with anxiety and OCD as well in\nyour channel so thank you so much for\nall that you do yeah I appreciate it I\nknow it's super important to get this\nknowledge out there\num because there there is a lot of\nmisconceptions about ticks and\nTourette's and we want to care about the\npeople that go through the these and not\nmake light of the situation and\nsometimes the world does that and it's\ngood to

some of the\ntreatments\num things that we talked about so cbit\nI've talked about CBT just learning how\nto\nyou know be better able to understand\none's own\nkind of challenges and be able to\nhopefully educate others about it as\nwell because at the end of the day it's\nabout acceptance so I'm in full support\nand I really hope that the community\nalso benefited a lot from this chat
