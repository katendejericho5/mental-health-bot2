    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Bestselling\nauthor, Susan Cain once wrote\n\"In a culture that praises\nthe extrovert ideal,\nintroverts are dramatically undervalued\nand because of this\nsociety is losing out.\"\nThat quote can be found\nin her hit novel, Quiet:\nThe Power of Introverts in a\nWorld That Can't Stop Talking.\nAnd as the title states\nit can be a struggle for\nintroverts to stay true\nto their quieter and more reserved nature\nwhen surrounded by people who\njust don't seem to get it.\nBut there's power and beauty to be found\nin being an introvert too,\na mystery that only unfolds to a few.\nAs author and comedian\nMicahela Chung once said,\n\"Don't underestimate me because I'm quiet.\nI know more than I say,\nthink more than I speak\nand observe more than you know.\"\nWith that said, here are five things\nthat make introverts\nincredibly attractive.\nNumber one, they are hard to get.\nWhile plenty of people will\ngive you dating advice,\nsaying that playing hard to get\nwill make you more attractive,\nfor introverts, it's not an act\nthey really are hard to get.\nThat's why it's so rewarding\nwhen you finally do win one over\nand get them to open up to you\nbecause it's not something\nthat they do just for anyone.\nA 2018 article from Time Magazine\nwritten by journalist\nCarly Breit states that\n\"Introverts are attractive\nbecause they make you\nwork for their attention,\nbut once you succeed, they'll find\nthat it often leads to lasting loyalty,\ndeep friendship and a loving\nromantic relationship.\"\nWe all know that finding\nthe perfect partner\ncan be a challenge\nbut what if there was a way\nto make the process a little bit easier?\nIntroducing our sponsors, So Syncd,\nthe introvert friendly dating app\nthat pairs couples based\non their personalities and interests.\nThink about it.\nWhen you are dating\nsomeone who truly gets you\nit's like a breath of fresh air.\nSo Syncd is designed to help\nyou find that special someone\nwho really understands you.\nThe app takes the guesswork out of dating\nby using a comprehensive personality test\nto match you with compatible partners.\nOnce you've taken the test,\nyou'll discover your personality type,\nwhether you are an INFJ, so thoughtful\nor an ENFP, so curious\nand you'll be able to see who\nyou are most compatible with.\nFrom there, it's up to\nyou to make the first move\nand start messaging.\nBut don't just take our word for it.\nListen to Hannah, a Psych2Goer\nwho discovered So Syncd\nthrough one of our videos.\nShe downloaded the app, found Brandon\nand deleted the app\nwithin a matter of hours,\nfound Brandon and deleted the app.\nSo why not give So Syncd a try\nas our sponsor for today's video.\nDownload the app today\nand give yourself a chance\nto find deeper more meaningful love.\nWith So Syncd, you'll be on the fast track\nto finding your perfect partner.\nNumber two, they have great composure.\nPsychologists define\nintroversion and extroversion\nas personality preferences.\nAs Heidi Eve-Cahoon wrote\nin her research article\nUnderstanding the Introvert Preference,\nand because introverts\nprefer their inner world\nto their external one,\nthey often process things internally.\nThey keep their thoughts\nand feelings to themselves\nand only share it with\nothers when they're ready.\nThis means that while\nothers might immediately\nhave an emotional outburst,\nintroverts do a good job of\nmaintaining their composure.\nThey seem more calm and\nthoughtful than most\nbecause they rarely ever lose their cool\nwhich only serves to make\nthem more attractive.\nNumber three, they're\nintellectually stimulating.\nAgain, because introverts\nprefer interacting\nwith their inner world more\nthan their external one,\nthis makes them great at deep\nintellectual conversations.\nIncredibly creative and self-reflective,\nthey're often fascinated,\nincredibly wanna learn about\ntheir interests deeply.\nIn fact, one study by\nresearchers Batey and Furnham\nfound that introverted\nart students excelled more\nthan their extroverted classmates\nbecause they spent more time on their own\nmastering their craft.\nAnd the same can be said for\nmany common introverted hobbies\nlike reading, writing, music, and film.\nSo you'd be hard pressed to\nfind someone more interesting\nto talk to once they get\nused to you, of course.\nNumber four, they're very self-sufficient.\nIn an article written by\nbehavioral health expert,\nDr. Natalie Frank, another quality\nthat makes introverts\nuniquely attractive to many\nis their strong sense of\nautonomy and self-sufficiency.\nTheir desire for privacy\nmakes them more independent\nwhich in turn makes them\nbetter able to take care\nof and make decisions for themselves.\nAnd there are fewer things more admirable\nthan someone who knows who\nthey are and what they want.\nThey don't need to look to anyone else\nto decide that for them\nor tell them what to do to get it done.\nThey can handle a lot of\nthings just on their own.\nAnd number five,\nthey want personal more\nthan social validation.\nLast but certainly not least,\nthere's something to be said\nabout an introvert's lesser\nneed for social validation\nbecause according to Dr. Natalie Frank,\nit's this desire for personal validation\nover social validation\nthat makes them more authentic than most.\nIntroverts choose to be\nguided by their morals,\npassions, and goals\nrather than the opinions\nand expectations of others.\nAnd sure, some people\nmight judge them for it\nsaying they're weird or\nhard to get along with\njust because they don't try to fit in\nas much as everyone else.\nBut to an introvert, that doesn't matter\nmore than being who they really are.\nSo do you agree with the\nthings we've mentioned here?\nAre you an introvert wondering about\nwhat traits of yours\nmake you more attractive?\nor maybe just an extrovert\nappreciating the other type.\nEither way, it's important\nthat we celebrate and\nappreciate ourselves and others\nno matter our differences.\nWith that said, what are some traits\nyou think make introverts more attractive?\nLet us know in the comments\nbelow, and thanks for watching."
