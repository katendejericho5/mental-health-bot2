    "transcript": "gaslighting is a term inspired by a 1944\nfilm called Gaslight in this film a\nhusband tries to manipulate his wife\ninto believing she is losing her mind to\nget her taken into an asylum and steal\nher Jewels one of the most prominent\ntactics was affecting the gaslights in\nthe house to flicker but would deny that\nanything was out of the ordinary when\nconfronted in a previous video five\nphrases Gaslight is used to control you\nwe talked about some gaslighter phrases\nin this video we'll dive deeper into the\ngaslighters themselves let's begin they\nwork subtly gaslighting comes in many\nforms some are overt in their\nmanipulation tactics meaning that you\ncan easily spot when they're doing it\nfor many however it is not that easy\ngaslighters can be sneaky with how they\nmanipulate you and you may not realize\nit until later Taylor Bennett a writer\nfrom thriveworks States in a\npeer-reviewed article that the\never-changing nature of gaslighting\nmakes it incredibly difficult to\ndiagnose manipulators can bring others\ninto the fold which can make it extra\nextremely difficult to trust your\njudgment when you have multiple people\nagainst you they may change details lie\nto others and set you up for failure in\norder to gain control over you and you\nmay be unable to identify it until you\nlook back at the whole situation they\noften have narcissistic traits\nmanipulation is a common symptom in\ncluster B personality disorders\nespecially so in narcissistic\npersonality disorder as personality\ndisorders occur on a spectrum a\ngaslighter may have symptoms of NPD but\nalso comorbidity with other conditions\nlike anti-social personality disorder Dr\nShona Waters an organizational\npsychologist states that it's common for\ngaslighters to have low self-esteem and\nmay find that their Antics help cover it\nup when looking at a condition like NPD\nit's common to have a deep sense of\ninadequacy they may find that having\ndominance over others masks this hidden\nfeeling these conditions are on a\nspectrum meaning that a person can have\ntraits but not the full condition not\nevery gaslighter has NPD and not every\nperson with NPD gaslights but the two\ncan overlap gas lighting is a learned\nbehavior Olivia guy Evans a psychology\nwriter from Simply psychology states\nthat gaslighting is a learned behavior\nrather than an innate one she says that\nmany gaslighters were brought up in a\ntoxic environment where they were\nexposed to gaslighting or needed to use\nthe technique to protect themselves for\nothers she explains that they can resort\nto manipulation because they cannot\nhandle criticism in many cases\ngaslighting behavior is a reflection of\nsomething that has happened to them it\ncreates a power imbalance and can put\nthem in a very powerful position in\nsituations where they felt powerless\nthey may resort to gaslighting to regain\na sense of control\nthey want to confuse you confusion makes\nyou vulnerable gaslighters are keen on\nmaking sure that you can't trust your\njudgment as it makes you more willing to\nlean on them therapist Dr Stephanie sock\nstates that gaslighters are Masters at\nlying they lie in ways that confuse you\nand make you feel that you don't\nunderstand the situation they twist\nfacts cover up evidence and shift the\nblame around so they're never in the\nwrong slowly over time you may begin to\nfeel that you truly contrast your\njudgment as they seem to know all the\nanswers sometimes they can be bold and\nrisky in their stances such as saying\nsomething that goes directly against\nwhat you have witnessed maybe your\nromantic partner asked you to buy\nsomething for them but then proceeds to\nact like they never did and belittle you\nfor doing it this bold move can confuse\nyou and make you wonder if you really\ndid do something wrong other cases are\nmore subtle such as changing small\ndetails to throw you off\nrumors are everywhere one sign of\ngaslighting that commonly presents\nitself in the work environment is rumors\nyou may begin to hear things about you\ngoing around that are false suddenly\nyou're the bad person but no one will\nbelieve you when you speak up\ngaslighters can pull other people into\ntheir narratives to further manipulate\nyou psychologist Dr Romani devasula\nbrings up the idea of tribe gaslighting\nthis is when others start to get\ninvolved and make gas like you without\nknowing for example if you are being\ngaslit by a manager and try to confide\nin another co-worker they may act as if\nyou are being irrational and take the\nmanager's side instead of listening or\ntrying to understand they call you the\nproblem this can also extend to friends\nand family where they are being\nmanipulated into believing you are in\nthe wrong and further the gaslighting by\nletting you know dealing with a gas\nlighter is exhausting and you may feel\nyou can never win because of the subtle\nnature of gaslighting it can be hard to\nidentify if you feel that you're a\nvictim it's always helpful to confide in\nsomeone you trust if it's a serious\nsituation involving work then getting in\ncontact with human resources can help\nmake a difference it's also always a\ngood idea to speak to a mental health\nprofessional if you're finding that\nyou're struggling thank you for watching\nthis video If you enjoyed it please give\nit a like and share it with someone who\nyou think will benefit from it let us\nknow your thoughts on this in
