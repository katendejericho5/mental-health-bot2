    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Sex can bring\nup a lot of emotions.\nWe usually think of the good ones,\nthe physical sensations\nand the positive feelings\nthat come from having sex.\nThere are also a lot of\npsychological and emotional benefits\nthat come from sex.\nSex can boost serotonin levels,\nwhich can make one feel relaxed\nfrom feeling stressed or anxious\nand it can improve one's mood.\nAccording to a 2003 study,\nsex may also have an effect\non how we process and\ndiscuss our emotions.\nHow?\nWell, in this video,\nwe'll be discussing how,\nalong with more of the ways\nsex may help our mental health.\nHere's how sex can\nbenefit our mental health:\nNumber one, anxiety and depression.\nA 2021 study from the Journal\nof Sexual Medicine showed\nthat those who were able to\nmaintain a sexual relationship\nwith their partner during\nthe COVID-19 lockdown\nexperienced less anxiety and depression\nthan those who were unable\nto have sex during lockdowns.\nThe study also suggested\nthat regular sexual activity could reduce\nsome of the negative symptoms associated\nwith anxiety and depression for a while.\nThe benefits there,\nbut sometimes it can be\ndifficult to enjoy sex\nwhen you have anxiety, for example.\nThere's arousal non-concordance, for one.\nThis is when the mind does not match up\nwith what the body is feeling.\nYour body may be aroused,\nbut your mind is just not feeling it today\nor the other way around.\nThis often happens to males\nand females with anxiety.\nSelf-consciousness can also play a role\nalong with anxiety when it comes to sex.\nAnd according to a 2018 study published\nin the journal, Women's Health:\n\"Low sexual desire is\nstrongly linked to depression.\nLack of subjective arousal\nand pleasure are linked to trait anxiety:\nThe sensations of physical sexual arousal\nmay lead to fear rather than to pleasure.\"\nSo basically, sex has different benefits\nor drawbacks depending\non your relationship\nwith sex and how you feel having it.\nTo hear more psychological facts about sex\nand mental health, check out our video,\n\"5 Psychological Facts About\nSex and Mental Health.\"\nThe links in the description box.\nNumber two, sex and stress.\nWhile stress can\nsometimes help motivate us\nto accomplish things,\nit can also be harmful\nphysically and mentally.\nLuckily, sex may help with stress as well.\nHormones like oxytocin, sometimes\nknown as the love hormone,\nare released in your body during sex.\nThese hormones coming to\nlife during sex can help\nin both feeling connected to\nyour partner and relaxation,\nwhich can both be beneficial\nfor anxiety and depression overall.\nIn addition, a 2009 study\nfrom the Journal of Sexual Medicine\nfound that both men and\nwomen were more satisfied\nwith their mental health\nif they were engaging in sex regularly.\nNumber three, quality\nof your relationship.\nRemember when I talked about\nthat love hormone, oxytocin?\nWell, while it can help you relax,\nanother benefit of that oxytocin release\nis that it also increases\nfeelings of intimacy\nwith your partner.\nSex, especially orgasm, can\nhelp us feel more trust,\npassion and love for our partners,\nand all of these positive\nfeelings help improve\nthe overall quality of our relationship.\nIf we are happier in our relationships\nand feel very connected to our partners,\nit can also be helpful\nto our emotional relationship with them.\nAnd number four, processing\nand discussing emotions.\nThere also may be a link\nbetween frequent sex\nand one's ability to process\nand manage their emotions,\nespecially in women.\nA 2003 study from the\nArchives of Sexual Behavior\nfound that one having less sex,\nwomen were more likely to\nhave trouble processing\nand expressing their emotions.\nSo having more regular sex\nmight mean a greater ability\nto connect and work with your emotions.\nDid you know that sex could have benefits\nbeyond just physical?\nIt won't solve all your issues,\nbut it certainly can\nhelp with some things.\nManaging our mental health\nisn't always an easy thing.\nDepending upon what we're going through\nand how we handle it,\nit can lead to a lot of different stresses\nand complications in our lives.\nWhile sex certainly isn't the solution\nto managing our mental health,\nit may be something additional\nthat can help relieve a bit of\nstress we feel from the day.\nThanks so much for watching.\nIf you like this video,\nlet us know with a like\nand comment down below.\nIf you want more videos like this,\nhit the Subscribe button\nand notification bell icon\nto get updated on when we post\nour next psychology video.\nWe'll see you next time."
