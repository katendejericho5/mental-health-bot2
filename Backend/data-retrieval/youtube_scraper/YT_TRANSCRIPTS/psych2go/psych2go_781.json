    "transcript": "many introverted characters in pop\nculture are accepted and celebrated for\ntheir introversion however introverts in\nthe real world don't experience that all\nthe time\nkind of like the opening musical number\nin Beauty and the Beast where the entire\nVillage is making fun of Belle\nintroversion can be seen as a problem or\nsocial hindrance instead of a quirky\nattribute in a society that seems to\nprefer extroverts being an introvert can\nbe challenging outgoing personalities\nare praised over soft-spoken and\ncontemplative ones schools and our jobs\nare designed to cater to extroverts\nintroverts are often forced to act like\nan extrovert but what makes these two\ntypes so different many people fall on a\nspectrum somewhere in between yet we've\nassumed that these attributes depend on\nhow a person relates to others but these\ntraits are linked to how you respond to\nsocial stimuli Scott Barry Kaufman of\nthe imagination Institute explained the\ndifferences between how an extrovert and\nintrovert brain engages in the dopamine\nreward system dopamine is a\nneurotransmitter that Awards behaviors\nand encourages you to repeat them again\nin a way it's also responsible for the\nhabits you create but I digress\nwhen it comes to introverts and\nextroverts an extrovert's brand is\nmotivated by social stimuli or rewards\nlike food and social status\nwhen faced with these Rewards or the\nexpectations of a reward an extrovert's\nbrain experiences more neurological\nactivity this activity is pleasant and\nmotivates an extrovert to receive more\nsocial stimuli for an introvert the\nexperience is different an introvert's\nbrain is more susceptible to dopamine\nincreases and gets overwhelmed easily\nthis is why the introvert Fizzles out\nwhen in Social environments with too\nmuch stimulation introverts do not\nThrive with healthy doses of dopamine\nthey prefer acetylcholine acetylcholine\nis a slow releasing neurotransmitter\nfrom the parasympathetic nervous system\nit is also the primary reason why\nsomeone may prefer a quiet evening at\nhome rather than being at a party\none Theory presents that introverts may\nhave more acetylcholine receptors than\ndopamine receptors\nputting aside neurological differences\nneither introverts nor extroverts are\nbetter and there is no such thing as a\npure introvert or extrovert as stated\nbefore we all fall on a spectrum some\njust happen to lean more to either side\nand few fall right in the middle but why\nis it that we have to choose growing up\nI was led to believe that being\nintroverted was bad people around me\nfrequently misconstrued my quietness as\nshyness I would often dread\nparent-teacher conferences because the\nremarks always were she's a great\nstudent but she needs to participate\nmore as if my quiet temperament was\nproblematic teachers and adults\nencouraged me to be more assertive and\noutgoing I knew I didn't have to be\nassertive to be outgoing but I made the\neffort to follow their request I spoke\nmore during class involved myself in\nmore activities in past as someone who\nwas overly social in reality\nI was tired it wasn't that I didn't want\nto be social I preferred to stay at home\nreading rather than going out I ignored\nmy instincts and without realizing it I\nwas limiting my strength\nknown introvert Albert Einstein once\nsaid the monotony and Solitude of a\nquiet life stimulates the creative mind\na 2016 study shows the relation of\nacetylcholine in learning and encoding\nnew memories and information so when an\nintrovert is in a quiet and calm\nenvironment that's when they'll do their\nbest and profound thinking Western\nsocieties prefer extroverted individuals\ntherefore we assume that the person who\nspeaks loudest has the best ideas it's\nbecause of this bias that introverts are\noverlooked for leadership positions but\nmany world-respected leaders have been\nintroverts Abraham Lincoln Rosa Parks\nMahatma Gandhi Isaac Newton Eleanor\nRoosevelt and Charles Darwin so it is\noften the soft-spoken person in the room\nwho has the answers consequently\nintroverts make phenomenal leaders\ntraits that Define introverts like good\nlisteners and not micromanaging make\nintroverts good leaders they give their\npeers free reign to work through their\nproblems to find their unique Solutions\nintroverts can be passion\nthey just manifested differently while\nan extrovert may be more vocal\nintroverts usually take the lead when\nit's something they truly care about\nunfortunately introverts are forced to\nsuccumb to societal pressures everything\nin our society from mandatory camera on\nZoom meetings to forced group projects\nwork against introverts but the world\nneeds introverts as much as they need\nextroverts as a society we should\nencourage and listen to introverts\nbecause their ideas can change the world\nhow can we incorporate introverted\nPersonalities in society let us know in\nthe comments thanks for watching until\nnext time\n[Music]"
