    "transcript": "ever watch a video in a streaming series\nor an ad featuring groups of friends and\nfor the briefest of moments wonder why\ncan't I have that we do that too that's\nlegit natural humans are generally\nsocial creatures striving and thriving\nto get our group on though but how do we\nget there because you know you want\nmeaningful friendships not just a group\nfor show ironically that also means\nthere's a lot on the line here so you're\nnervous Let's help you out with some\ntips even better for this video we have\nAvery and Terry to help provide examples\nwhere needed wave hello YouTube let's\nget started number one highlight\nsimilarities as much as we know you're\nyour own strong individual person you\nwill tend to get along better with\nsomeone who has at least some of the\nsame interests sure it was easier in\nschool because everyone was stuck going\nto the same place the same room every\nday for hours on end so you were bound\nto talk to someone simply due to that\nfrequency that environment can be\nrecreated Now by you just participate or\njoin in a group think of stuff you\ngenerally like there's a cause maybe\nmudding keyboards maybe I like Pottery I\njust joined a pottery class\nthings I didn't think you'd be in a\nclass oh well thanks you too and it\nlooks like they're off talking about\nPottery I see beautiful friendship in\nthe making a group could be physical or\neven an online discussion thread when\nyou have something to talk about that\nfirst big step has been taken number two\nstart simple and open let's say you've\ninitiated conversation but then it\nsuddenly gets awkwardly quiet does this\nsound unfortunately familiar not to\nworry many of us tend to get ahead of\nourselves and we end up asking too much\ntoo soon we also tend to ask questions\nthat can be answered yes or no so start\nsimple and ask questions that start with\nthings like how or what\num Terry Avery okay to share what we're\ntalking about sure right\num hey Avery I saw you walking a dog the\nother day is that yours no okay guys\nthat's an example of closed questioning\nlet's show them open right\num hey Avery I saw you walking a dog the\nother day how do you get a dog oh a big\ngolden colored dog yeah no that's not\nmine it's my neighbors and I walk their\ndog on occasion I mean I love dogs but\nyou know expensive\nget that that dog looks so happy and\nfriendly it reminds me of the time I had\na job at a pet shop see open this will\ngive you more information and you can\nthen ask questions based on the answer\nthat they gave you this shows and\nconfirms that you're listening to them\nand hear about what they say after all\nthat you share something related about\nyourself think of it as a trust me\nthey've trusted you with some info and\nyou're now trusting them and all good\nrelationships are based on trust number\nthree joke around good non-aggressive\nhumor is a great way to bond with others\nit helps to break the ice and ease\nawkward sounds moments it lightens the\natmosphere which makes others\ncomfortable having a good sense of humor\nAssociates you with good times and\nconfidence so people may choose to speak\nand open up to you because they know\nit's not going to be swamped by a downer\nor a lecture number four share a meal\nand don't try to start a friendship when\nyou're angry food is good for the soul\nand it's good for making friends you're\nin a place of comfort and good cheer\nwhen eating a meal sharing that space\nwith someone means you now have more\nthan one person in that same happy space\nand conversation will naturally flow\nnumber five compliment them don't go\noverboard though because then it might\nfeel creepy or fake just be genuine and\nlet someone know when they've got\nsomething good going on it can be\nsomething simple like hair color or a\ncompliment on a skill they've likely\nbeen working on Avery Terry Europe hi I\njust wanted to let you know I think your\nMandalorian armor is amazing thanks I\nmade it you made that you have got to be\ncrazy talented now the person Associates\nyou with feeling good and the compliment\nhas also acted like an invite to talk to\nyou other people get nervous too and a\ncompliment is a great way to allay for\nyou that they'll be stopped number six\nseek\nno no no don't do this through Gathering\nminions or acting incompetent in this\nkind of help we mean being open to\nasking for someone for assistance or\nadvice and something you're truly and\ngenuinely interested in so it's not like\nyou're making them you're lucky you're\ncomplimenting them by acknowledging\ntheir expertise in an area if you're\ninquiring because you're curious you're\nacknowledging that what they're good at\nis a desirable thing generally it allows\nthem to perform small acts of kindness\nthe which can lead to increased\ncloseness and a connection they feel\nvalued and helpful and people like to\nknow that they matter the key to this\nthough is that the interest must be\ngenuine because pretend or polite\ncuriosity feels fake and makes it seem\nlike you're either being condescending\nor have an unsavory alteria motive\nnumber seven EO friends have friends too\nthis is where you're using the fact that\nthe odds are in your favor see if you\ncan be friends with your friends friends\nounces seem good after all you have lots\nof common interests with your current\nfriend chances can be good that their\nfriend has some overlapping interests\ntoo plus you trust your friend and thus\nthere's a bit of chance that their\nfriend is safe by being your friend's\nfriend they've embedded there's a far\nlower chance of unpleasant surprises and\nyou already have something in common the\nmutual friend number eight spend time\nlike anything new a bond needs to be\nnurtured so I mean you click with\nsomeone that's the critical time to\ncement the bond of course your older\nfriendships do need care too but the\nbond there is already pretty solid and\ncan survive longer periods of downtime\nand a new friendship pick an activity\nthat allows you to actually get to know\neach other interact over social media\nplay games or do that similar interest\nyou have hey that reminds me Terry I got\nsome new clay and potter's wheel and\nsome new designs we'll want to do some\npot sculpting this sounds great I have\nso much to tell you from the last couple\nof weeks let's see these two can catch\neach other up and continue to feel\nrelevant and needed in each other's\nlives number nine dealing with doubts\nand fear we all have these same doubts\nand fears mostly it's about things we\nhave very little control over like what\nwould that person think and what if it\ndoesn't work out part of dealing with\nthe doubts and fears is to realize that\nbecause we are all such varied\nindividuals no one can be good friends\nwith everyone meaning if your best\nefforts aren't reciprocated that's not\nthe feeling on your part focus on why\nyou're trying to be friends with the\nperson rather than worrying about their\nreaction which you can't control\napproach them because you're genuinely\ninterested not faking concern you're\nfocusing on them taking the spotlight\noff of you and that can also help you\nfeel less on\nwell I was in this group and this one\nperson was talking they seem to like all\nthe same movies I liked they'd even read\nthe series of books I thought no one\nelse had read but when I tried to talk\nto them they just insulted my opinions\nand kept shutting me down well then it\nsounds like you approached them with an\nopen mind and friendliness if they slam\nthe door on your face that says more\nabout them than you that's right Terry\nthat person's reaction was stating they\nwould not be a good friend to you Avery\nyou were genuine and good making friends\ncan be hard because we tend to focus on\nwhat they want and it can be easy to\nforget that what you really want is\nsomeone who gets along with you not you\nbending over backwards to change who you\nare for them friends will of course have\nan effect on each other but in the end\nif you have to do a 180 to be someone's\nfriend are they really friends with you\nor just with the ACT you are worthy of\nfriendship so go out there and get them\nwhat
