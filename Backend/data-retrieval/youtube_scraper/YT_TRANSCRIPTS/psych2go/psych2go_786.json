or touch at all such\nas emotional intellectual experiential\nand spiritual intimacy that is just as\nimportant to our relationship as the\nphysical kind\nall these types of intimacy can help\nstrengthen healthy relationships but\nsometimes you might notice yourself or\nyour partner avoiding or being unable to\nbe as close as you want to be\nperhaps they're anxious about being so\nopen or afraid to show their\ninsecurities with you if you're curious\nto know why you or your partner may be\navoiding intimacy here are seven reasons\nwhy we avoid intimacy rejection

in your\nrelationship\naccording to psychologist Dr Margaret\nPaul co-founder of inner bonding most\npeople have underlying false beliefs\nthat when triggered in their\nrelationship cause fears that lead to\ncontrolling protective and avoidant\nbehavior these false beliefs may involve\nbelieving that you're not enough for\nyour partner or that you need to give up\npart of yourself for your relationship\nin cases like this communication is key\nwhen you're open to learning about you\nand your partner's fears and underlying\nfalse beliefs your relationship becomes\nan ever-evolving one and that's a good\nthing\nfear of abandonment\nmost people who identify with fearing\nabandonment have an insecure attachment\nStyle\npsychotherapist Shaman ajan states that\nthis can become a hindrance to making\ndeep emotional and intimate connections\nwith a partner similarly according to\nholistic psychologist Nicole lipin baril\nhaving an insecure attachment style may\nlead to anxieties about whether or not\nyour own needs and desires can be met\nyou may expect the other person to\nabandon and hurt you in some way lemon\nBarrel even said\nquickly these attachment Styles if\nunresolved play out in adulthood for\ninstance if you were a clingy child\nyou'll generally be clingy towards a\nromantic partner later or if you've\nlearned that you can't rely on your\ncaregiver you may end up being unable to\nrely on a partner as an adult\navoidant personality disorder\naccording to the diagnostic and\nstatistical Manual of mental disorders\n5th edition DSM-5 avoidant personality\ndisorder is characterized by extreme\navoidance of social interaction driven\nby fears of rejection and feeling of\ninterpersonal inadequacy\nI'm sure a lot of us can relate to\nfeeling like this right this could be\nwhy many are anxious according to\npsychologist Maria Andreas this disorder\nis a combination of both genetic and\nenvironmental factors Studies have shown\nthat avoidant personality disorder is\npositively correlated with neuroticism\nand has a negative relationship with\nextroversion this suggests that these\npeople tend to be more anxious fearful\nand understandably more introverted and\nclosed off the next Point deals with\nchildhood sexual abuse skip to the next\npoint if you think this might trigger\nyou\nchildhood sexual abuse\naccording to therapist Wendy maltz's\ndefinition sexual abuse occurs whenever\none person dominates and exploits\nanother by means of sexual activity or\nsuggestion survivors of sexual abuse may\nexperience difficulties with trust have\na fear of intimacy\nfear of being different and have\ndifficulty establishing interpersonal\nboundaries in relationships\nin these cases it's important to keep\nthe lines of communication open with\nyour partner and perhaps consider\ntherapy as an option to help deal with\nthese childhood traumas\nprevious abuse\nfear of intimacy can also stem from\nemotional and physical abuse which is\ncommitted against intimate Partners\ncurrent or former spouses boyfriends and\ngirlfriends\nemotional abuse can include verbal\nassault dominance control isolation\nridicule or the use of intimate\nknowledge for degradation\nit impacts the mental health and\nwell-being of the victim and it is often\na precursor to physical abuse\nthere's a high correlation between\nphysical and emotional abuse and\nbatterer populations and verbal abuse\nearly in a relationship predicts\nsubsequent physical abuse\nchildren who are emotionally abused May\ngrow into adults who fear ridicule or\nverbal abuse if they share anything with\nothers\nwhich can lead to an inability to share\nand be vulnerable in adult relationships\ndue to these anxieties and fears\nif this is familiar at all please reach\nout to a qualified healthcare provider\nor mental health professional if you're\nstruggling parental neglect according to\nlicensed clinical psychologist\nAyanna Abrams a person's attachment\nstyle is the way they behave in a\nrelationship based on the way they were\ncared for as a child Abram's notes that\nnot feeling secure in your relationship\nwith your parent or caregiver can lead\nto three different types of attachment\nstyles\navoidant anxious or disorganized if you\nhave an avoidant attachment style you\ntypically avoid intimacy and this is\noften due to caregivers being largely\nunavailable\none study published in the international\nJournal of sexual health found having\nunavailable parents might even lead to\nsexual difficulties later in life those\nwith an anxious attachment style tend to\nCrave intimacy it usually forms when a\nchild has inconsistent caregivers who\nare not always there for them if you\nhave a disorganized attachment style you\ntend to both crave intimacy and avoid it\nthis tends to occur when a child grows\nup afraid of their caregiver\nthat's why it's also called fearful\navoidant attachment and it's been linked\nto poor coping skills erratic behavior\nand difficult or volatile relationships\nseparation and over-dependence\ndo you tend to call your parents for\nadvice when something goes wrong in
