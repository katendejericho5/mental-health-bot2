    "transcript": "do you often say things like I'm so\nsorry this is such a dumb question but\nor maybe someone was in a hurry and ran\ninto you and all you say is sorry was I\nin your way okay hold up that's a bit\ntoo much but do you feel like you\napologize for almost everything even\nwhen you're not in the wrong being sorry\nand apologizing for certain things is an\nimportant aspect of being polite you've\nbeen learning about it your whole life\nbut were you taught about the things you\nshouldn't apologize for why do you do it\naccording to Juliana brains PhD in\nassistant professor of psychology at the\nUniversity of Rhode Island over\napologizing can stem from being too hard\non ourselves or beating ourselves up for\nthings rather than recognizing everyone\nmakes mistakes and no one expects you to\nbe perfect to remind you that it's okay\nto not be perfect here are a things you\nshouldn't say sorry for number one for\nhaving an opinion according to Manhattan\npsychotherapist Panthea copor those who\nover apologize often feel like a burden\nto others as if their wants needs and\nthoughts are not important this feeling\ncan stem from many different Roots one\nof them being feelings of inadequacy as\na result of childhood trauma because of\nthat you may feel ashamed of having an\nopinion or maybe you're afraid to openly\ndisagree with someone but as long as\nyou're respectful towards everyone and\ndon't purposefully insult others you're\nentitled to have an opinion even if\nsomebody doesn't agree with you you\ndon't have to change your attitude and\nvalues just so they fit someone else's\npoint of view after all having and\nexpressing your own opinion is what\nshapes you as a person instead of saying\nsorry try saying I respect your opinion\nbut I disagree number two for putting\nyour needs first a family therapist\nKelly Hendrick says that you might over\napologize because you want to be seen as\na good person maybe you were praised for\nputting others first and learned that\nit's best to sacrifice yourself for\nothers or to think less of yourself\nbeing kind is something you should\ndefinitely strive for but neglecting\nyourself is not the way to do it you\nmight believe thinking of yourself is\nselfish but when you think about it\nisn't it selfish for others to make you\nput yourself last sometimes everything\ncan get so overwhelming and you just\nneed to take care of yourself without\nfeeling like you're letting others down\ninstead of saying sorry try saying I\nneed some time for myself or I'm not\ncomfortable with that number three for\nturning your phone off you know when you\njust want to watch Netflix without\ntalking to anyone but your phone\nconstantly rings with messages\nnotifications and calls and you can't\nget even one second of alone time and\nyou just want to turn it off or put it\non silent but you don't want to be rude\nby not replying taking time for yourself\nand not being available for a bit is not\nrude and everyone needs a break from\ntime to time including you so don't feel\nbad for putting the online World on hold\nfor a bit instead of apologizing say i'\nlike to enjoy some alone time tonight so\ndid

make you feel a range of emotions\nanger frustration fear extreme happiness\nsadness having and expressing emotions\nis what makes you human but sometimes\nyou may feel like you're being a burden\nif you express those emotions you think\nyou're annoying people around you with\nyour feelings and you feel tempted to\nsay I'm sorry I don't mean to bother you\nas Professor Brin says when we apologize\nfor feeling hurt or even for feeling\npassionate about something we minimize\nourselves in a misguided attempt to\nprotect others try to remember that no\nmatter what you have the right to feel\nand express your emotions instead of\nsaying sorry try saying I'm struggling\nand need support number five for crying\nsimilar to showing emotion sometimes\nlife gets down and you just need to have\na good cry have you experienced feeling\nbetter after crying like the weight on\nyour shoulder suddenly became lighter\nthat's how crying can help but when\nyou're around people and you feel the\nneed to cry you may feel embarrassed and\nAfraid what will they think of you if\nthey see your tears so you try to\nswallow your tears and start apologizing\nbut you're not crying on purpose it's\nsomething your body just does like\nsneezing or coughing and just like you\neveryone cries sometimes so if someone\nwants to judge you that's their problem\ndon't feel like you did something bad if\na teer escapes instead of saying sorry\ntry saying oh this got me emotional or I\nneed a moment to calm down number six\nfor the way you look have you ever\nexperienced Uninvited comments about\nyour appearance maybe you dye your hair\nof crazy colors or have piercings or a\nbunch of tattoos or maybe you're just\ntoo skinny or not skinny enough or you\nhave a few pimples on your face comments\nlike these can make you feel bad about\nyourself to the point that you feel like\napologizing for it Dr Elena torini a\nconsultant psychologist explains that if\nyou have feelings of

fear being\njudged but the truth is nobody should\nbring you down for the way you look you\nare free to express yourself through\nyour style and every little imperfection\nis what makes you beautiful and unique\nso instead of saying sorry say nothing\nand own your appearance number seven for\nnot taking other people's advice how\noften do the people you're close to give\nyou advice on how to live

hairstyle is bad but\nyou like the way it looks they might get\ntheir ego hurt if you don't listen to\nthem because they think they're right\nand can't comprehend why you wouldn't\nlisten but why would you it's your life\nand your choice\nit's okay for them to offer suggestions\nbut it doesn't mean you have to follow\nthem instead of saying sorry say I\nappreciate your opinion I'll think about\nit and make my own decision number eight\nfor\napologizing sometimes you really feel\nbad for things whether you're in the\nwrong or not maybe it's because you feel\nguilty about something or you have a low\nself-esteem you feel the need to say\nsorry and even if you apologize for the\nwrong things or apologize too much that\napology is still sincere and comes from\nthe heart there is
