    "transcript": "- [Instructor] There\nhas been a huge decline\nin mental health around the world,\nwhich is why we are so committed\nto creating more content\nthan we ever have.\nThanks for being part of our journey.\nDo you ever notice your\nclassmate or coworker,\nwho does not seem to talk\nmuch but when they do,\nthey always have something\ninteresting to contribute?\nOr maybe you are the\ntype to be more silent,\nbut have tons of thoughts constantly\nrunning through your head.\nOne thing is for certain,\nif you think Netflix has too many shows,\ntry looking inside an introvert's brain.\nThere is always a steady stream\nof thoughts running through their minds.\nIntroverts are introspective\nin their thinking\nand focus on internal\nthoughts, feelings, and moods.\nAre you curious what\nthese thoughts may be?\nHere are a list of five things\nintroverts think but never say.\nNumber one, \"I don't\nalways wanna hang out,\nbut I still wanna be invited.\"\nHave you ever felt so drained\nonce you reach the weekend\nthat you decided to\nspend your solitary time\nat home to recharge?\nIt's been a hectic week,\nand all you wanna do\nis retreat into a shell\nand read that new book you\njust bought the other day.\nHowever, you heard that\nyour friends had made plans.\nYou may not wanna go,\nbut you still wanna be invited.\nFor introverts, time alone is essential.\nThe conflict in their lives is\nbetween wanting to be invited\nto things but not wanting to go.\nNumber two, \"Would they think\nI'm boring and uninteresting?\"\nDo you ever think that you\nare uninteresting to others?\nPerhaps you're fond of\nenjoying your own time\nsipping tea in an isolated place,\nwhile creating imaginary\nworlds in your mind?\nIntroverts are usually quiet around people\nthey don't know very well.\nThey might be afraid\nof what the person might think\nof them or what they say.\nCombine this with their\ndislike for small talk,\nsome people may view\nintroverts as uninteresting.\nHowever, when introverts\nfind an interesting topic\nto talk about, they can\nramble on for hours.\nNumber three, \"Is it okay\nif I'm not saying too much?\"\nHave you ever been in a conversation\nand worried about how the\nother person perceives you?\nPerhaps you're on a date\nand you're more comfortable being the one\nto ask a few questions and\nlisten to your date talking\nand then it occurs to you.\nIs it okay if I'm not saying too much?\nYou know you are entirely invested\nin the person in front of you,\nbut you're not sure if\nthey're aware of that.\nPeople with introverted\npersonalities often observe things,\nwhile thinking in their heads constantly.\nApart from that, introverts\nthrive in silence.\nNumber four, is it obvious\nthat I sometimes ignore\nmy calls and messages?\nDo you become anxious when\nyour phone is ringing?\nCalls demand immediate attention\nand distract you from the task at hand.\nEven if someone they like calls,\nintroverts may not answer.\nIntroverts might also greatly appreciate\nif the person who wants to call them\nschedules the call over text.\nThis way they can look forward to talking\nwith the person and avoid the dread that\nalways comes with the\nsurprise of a phone ringing.\nNumber five.\n\"I hope they cancel our plans,\nso that I don't have to go.\"\nHave you ever received an invitation\nfrom your friend to hang\nout, but you secretly wish\nfor them to cancel the plans?\nWhen plans are canceled, you feel free.\nSometimes introverts tend\nto say yes to every plan\nand go outta their way to see people,\neven if these activities\nleave them feeling depleted.\nSo when their friends cancel\nplans, they feel relieved,\nbecause they don't wanna\nmake their friends feel bad\nwhen they cancel the plans themselves.\nThere are various types of introverts\nand not all of them are the same.\nEveryone has unique personality traits\nand no one fits into a\nsingle category or box,\nbut hopefully this video gives\nyou a better understanding\nof how people with\nintroverted personality types\nthink, act, and feel.\nTill next time, Psych2goers."
