you're with them\nthese kinds of people are what\npsychologists call Energy vampires their\nname does such because they feed on our\nemotional energy sucking us dry of\nemotion\nbut make no mistake not everyone you\ndislike disagree with or find hard to\nget along with is an energy vampire in\nfact a recent article by NBC News\nactually states that energy vampires are\noften friends family members and\nco-workers who feed on our willingness\nto listen attend and care for others\nwhich can leave us feeling mentally and\nemotionally drained if this sounds\nunsettlingly familiar to you

conflict and\npush other people's buttons just because\nthey thrive in crisis and love to stir\nup trouble just so they can be the\ncenter of attention they often make\nmountains out of mole Hills just to gain\nthe sympathy of others because they have\nan exaggerated sense of self-importance\nDr Christian Northrup even suggests in\nher book dodging energy vampires an\nempath's guide to evading relationships\nthat drain you into restoring your\nhealth and power that many energy\nvampires have similarities with those\ndiagnosed with anti-social borderline\nand or narcissistic personality disorder\nthe freeloader another type of energy\nvampire a lot of us encounter is the\nfreeloader and as you can probably guess\nfrom their name they often lurk in our\nschools and workplaces it could be a\nslacker group mate who isn't pulling\ntheir weight or a manager who leaves you\nto do all the heavy lifting yourself\nthen swooping in to take the credit\neither way the freeloader is known to\nprey on those too polite or too\npowerless to push back against them\naccording to NYU psychology Professor\nTessa West author of jerks at work toxic\nco-workers and what to do about them\nthe self-victimizing an article by the\nBerkeley well-being Institute describes\nthe self-victimizing type of energy\nvampire as the kind of person who\ndoesn't know how to take responsibility\nfor their actions or admit their\nmistakes rather they blame everyone else\nfor whatever goes wrong in their life\nand often expect others to caretake them\nfor it there woe is me attitude makes\nthem seem like Hypocrites to everyone\nbut themselves and their constant need\nfor you to take their side and affirm\nthis mindset can be emotionally draining\nthe dominating there's a kind of energy\nvampire that always tries to one-up you\naccording to an article by Healthline\nnever wanting to be outdone or outshone\nthese people don't want to share the\nspotlight narcissistic and envious they\ncan't be happy for you when you share\ngood news with them\ninstead they try to put you down with\nbackhanded compliments and thinly veiled\ninsults people who love to feel Superior\nover others like the dominating energy\nvampire can be exhausting to be around\nbecause of how they constantly compete\nwith you over the tiniest things\nyeah you won't let you win and they feel\nthe need to put you down just to make\nthemselves feel good\nThe Chronic critic\nnext we have The Chronic critic a type\nof energy vampire who gets their kid got\nto constantly criticizing those around\nthem preying on all your insecurities\nand while it may seem obvious enough\nthat people like this are red flags dear\nmental health it can sometimes be\ndifficult to recognize this behavior in\nothers especially if they're close\nfriends who appear friendly and\nwell-intentioned don't be fooled though\nthis kind of energy vampire will suck\nall your confidence dry if you're not\ncareful according to an article from\nPsychology today written by a\npsychologist Dr Sherry Bor Carter energy\nvampires are overly critical and find\nfaults with just about everyone and\neverything in their lives\nthe fake friend in need\nlast but not the least is the fake\nfriend in need eager to exploit your\ngood nature and use it against you this\ntype of energy vampire will first try to\nget close to you only then will they\nstart asking for favors leeching off any\nkindness sympathy or understanding you\nshow them usually they'll try to\nmonopolize your time by always asking\nfor your help and guilting you into\ndoing things you may not even want nor\nhave the time and energy for\ndemanding but emotionally manipulative\nenough not to seem like it they have no\nproblem taking advantage of your\nkindness because they never take no for\nan answer now did going through this\nlist bring anyone in particular to mind\ndo you think there might be certain\npeople in your life who suck your energy\nand leave you feeling drained\nwhoever this person might be always\nremember that it's not selfish to want\nto protect your own peace of mind and\nkeep yourself from getting sucked dry by\nenergy vampires\npracticing good self-care and\nestablishing clear healthy boundaries\nand keep you from getting overwhelmed by\ntheir negative energy and by recognizing\ntheir problematic behaviors and
