    "transcript": "caffeine it's everywhere according to a\n2013 study published in the Journal of\ncaffeine research caffeine is the most\nwidely used drug in the world in the\nUnited States more than 90 of adults use\nit regularly and among them average\nconsumption is more than 200 milligrams\nof caffeine per day more caffeine than\nis contained in two six ounce cups of\ncoffee or five 12 ounce cans of soft\ndrinks while many coffee lovers and\nenergy drink drinkers say they reap the\nbenefits of having caffeine is there a\ndownside to it all how exactly does\ncaffeine affect your mental health after\nall it's been a much debated topic so\nlet's take a look at whether caffeine is\nan overall benefit or risk to your\nmental health number one should you have\ncaffeine if you have a mood or anxiety\ndisorder or a mental illness\ndo you suffer from a mental illness do\nyou also drink coffee you may be\nwondering how this can affect your\nmental disorder well after all caffeine\nincreases heart rate and blood pressure\nso what does this do to someone with\nlet's say an anxiety disorder in a\npsychology today article the\nbronfenbrenner center for translational\nresearch notes that caffeine can trigger\nanxiety especially when drinking more\nthan one cup a day and in people who are\nmore sensitive to coffee's effects the\nauthor notes that it is important to\nunderstand there are large differences\nin how individuals process and react to\ncaffeine so have you noticed how\ncaffeine affects your disorder symptoms\na study published in the journal\nPsychiatry research focused on 43\npatients and found that anxiety disorder\npatients have increased caffeine\nsensitivity which leads to decreased\nconsumption it would seem to make sense\nthat anxiety symptoms could indeed\nincrease with even simply the increase\nin heart rate and blood pressure\ncaffeine can provide a 2005 Cambridge\nstudy public in the journal advances in\npsychiatric treatment notes that\npsychiatrists rarely inquire about\ncaffeine intake when assessing patients\nthis may lead to a failure to identify\ncaffeine-related problems and offer\nappropriate interventions\nexcessive caffeine ingestion leads to\nsymptoms that overlap with those of many\npsychiatric disorders caffeine is\nimplicated in the exacerbation of\nanxiety and sleep disorders and people\nwith eating disorders often misuse it\ntoo it antagonizes adenosine receptors\nwhich may potentiate dopaminogenic\nactivity and exacerbate psychosis in\npsychiatric inpatients caffeine has been\nfound to increase anxiety hostility and\npsychotic symptoms that seems like\nenough to not want to take another sip\nof that mocha right well kind of there's\nalso research out there that shows\ndiffering results highlighting the\nbenefits of caffeine an article from\nnocd explains that in a small study\nsponsored by Stanford University 7 of 12\npatients with OCD saw immediate\nImprovement on 300 milligrams of coffee\ndaily the author suggests that caffeine\nmay work better in one concentrated dose\neach morning than spaced out throughout\nthe day and reminds us that caffeine\nremains a well-known anxiety producer in\nmany people so why while there are\nstudies that suggest caffeine can be\ngood and bad for your mental health an\nimportant question to keep in mind is\nwhat do you notice it doing to your\nmental health\nnumber two Sleep disorders and insomnia\nmost people will generally order a cup\nof coffee to stay awake and get some\nenergy back so it makes sense that\nyou'll have trouble falling asleep when\nyou drink a ton of caffeine that same\n2005 study published in the journal\nadvances in psychiatric treatment\nexplains that caffeine reduces slow wave\nsleep in the early part of the sleep\ncycle and can reduce rapid eye movement\nor REM sleep later in the cycle caffeine\nincreases episodes of wakefulness and\nhigh doses in the late evening can\nincrease the time taken to fall asleep\nso if you consume more caffeine than\naverage don't be too surprised if you\nstruggle more and more with falling\nasleep number three mental performance\nwhat about the benefits there's quite a\nbit of research out there showing how\ncaffeine can improve mental performance\nvery well mined describes a 2012 studies\nresults and found that caffeine was\nshown to improve performance on a range\nof different tasks including vigilance\nresponse times information Asian\nprocessing and some but not all\nproofreading tasks\nget easy though don't think this means\nthe more caffeine the better the study\nalso compared people with a low daily\ncaffeine intake with those who consumed\na lot of caffeine each day and found\nthat the improvements are not too\nsignificant so the more caffeine you\nconsume the less improvements you'll see\nremember moderation is key\nnumber four\ncaffeine withdrawal\nso what happens if you drink a lot of\ncaffeine each day and then suddenly stop\nyou may realize you've become dependent\non it and experience caffeine withdrawal\nsyndrome an article by Stacy Liu\npublished with the American\nPsychological Association explains that\naccording to the DSM-5 caffeine\nwithdrawal syndrome occurs when people\nskip a dose of caffeine and experience\nheadaches fatigues depression and\ntrouble concentrating she goes on to\nexplain that research suggests many\npeople use caffeine just to avoid these\nsymptoms though others especially\nchildren in adolescents may not\nunderstand why they feel sluggish and\nhave a raging headache so while it's\nnice to get a few cups of coffee each\nweek or drink down those energy drinks\nperhaps before a big soccer game is\nimportant to know what caffeine does to\nyou feel great after a sip or two of\nthat mocha go ahead and drink a cup or\ntwo if you enjoy it moderation is key\nbut if you're not feeling the benefits\nof caffeine then maybe it's not worth\nall the buzz\ndid you enjoy this video If so make sure\nto hit the like button subscribe for\nmore psychology content and share this\nvideo with a coffee lover thanks
