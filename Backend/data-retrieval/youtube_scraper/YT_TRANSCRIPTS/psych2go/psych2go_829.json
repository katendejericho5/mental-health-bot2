    "transcript": "I remember when I Was preparing for\nexams just on the topic of like anxiety\nI would ask myself why am I expecting\nmyself to be so calm when on a\nday-to-day basis when I don't even have\nexams I'm already sweating all the time\njust worried about things you're putting\non boxing gloves and hitting yourself\nand I almost want to stop you from\nhitting yourself I shouldn't be upset\nright now and I I shouldn't be stressed\nbut if you are then now you're giving\nyourself the extra problem of not only\nam I anxious but now I have all these\nshoulds that I shouldn't be anxious and\nthat makes it even more complicated so\nat least be easy on yourself from the\nbeginning and recognize that as human\nbeings we are our emotions will ebb and\nflow though we'll go up we'll go down\nthen that's okay it's normal but I think\nit'll be less extreme if we accept it\nand it'll be more extreme if we say this\ncan't be happening I can't take this\nthat's where we really intensify our own\nemotions"
