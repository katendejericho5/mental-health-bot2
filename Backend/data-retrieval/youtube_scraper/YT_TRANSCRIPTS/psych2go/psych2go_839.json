    "transcript": "hey sector cars\nit's been said that loneliness is a\nuniversal Human Experience and chances\nare if you're watching this then you've\nprobably felt lonely too no one is\nexempt from feeling a sense of\nloneliness in their lives from time to\ntime no matter what their age race\nbackground or social circumstances may\nbe\nbut when left to its own devices it can\nbe a potentially damaging State of Mind\nto be in\nso why do we feel lonely and better yet\nwhat can we do about it\nwell here are six psychology-backed\nsigns to help with just that\nnumber one you have a good friend or two\nmost people tend to feel lonely when\nthey don't have as many friends as they\nlike or they have too many acquaintances\nthey don't feel particularly close to\nso if you have at least one close friend\nin your life you genuinely feel like you\ncan trust and who cares for you\nthen you're already doing so much better\nthan you probably think you are in fact\none of the most famous psychological\nstudies the 40-year Harvard study on\nhappiness has found that it's not the\nquality of our social relationships that\ndetermines our happiness but rather\ntheir quality\nnumber two you have people you can get\nhelp from\nmany people want to be popular and\nwell-liked never Without a Friend by\ntheir side or flaunting a million\nfollowers on social media\nbut we all know that deep down inside\nnone of that matters if the people you\nsurround yourself with don't truly care\nabout you as a person\nso if you've ever found yourself in a\ntough spot before or struggling with a\nproblem that someone in your life helped\nyou to solve be it a friend or a family\nmember then count yourself lucky you're\nnot as alone as you think you are number\nthree you have people who can give you\nadvice\neven though you might feel too scared to\nopen up and burden other people with\nyour problems or worry that they might\ntreat and look at you differently once\nyou do the truth is you'll never really\nknow until you try who knows you might\nalready have plenty of people in your\nlife who'd be more than happy to listen\nto what's troubling you and even offer\nsome advice like your parents your best\nfriend your teacher your guidance\ncounselor and so on\nnumber four\nyou can talk about your hobbies and\ninterests\nokay so maybe talking about all the\ntouchy-feely stuff is a bit\nuncomfortable for you that's okay a lot\nof people feel the same way but talking\nto someone about your hobbies and\ninterests can be just as fulfilling and\ntherapeutic too especially with those\nwho share the same passion as you\nfinding someone you can talk to about\nall the things that make you happy\nwhether it's a favorite film book or\nPastime is already enough to make us\nfeel a stronger sense of belonging and\nemotional connection with others\nnumber five\nyou have people you regularly check in\nwith\neven if you might not see them as often\nas you'd like or you feel like you've\ndrifted apart and aren't as close as you\nused to be that doesn't mean that your\nloved ones have stopped caring about you\nor that you don't matter to them anymore\nchances are even if they don't keep in\ntouch anymore they still check in on you\nfrom time to time and make sure you're\nokay Sunday brunch at your parents house\ngrabbing coffee with an old friend a\nquick phone call from your sibling all\nof these things tell you you're not as\nalone as you might feel sometimes\nbecause at the end of the day your loved\nones will always be there\nand number six you're careful about who\nyou let in\nbeing careful about who you let into\nyour life and your inner circle can reap\na lot of rewards but it can also make us\nfeel more alone than we really are we\nmight feel like we don't have as much of\na social media presence don't go out as\noften as other people think we should or\naren't constantly surrounded by other\npeople in our day-to-day lives\nregardless of all these things however\nit's still a lot better to choose your\nfriends wisely because then you can be\nsure that the people you do let your\nguard down around can be trusted\nso do you relate to any of the things\nwe've mentioned here has this helped you\nrealize that you're not as alone as you\nonce thought\nwhile it's tempting to push such a\npainful and scary feeling aside it's\nimportant that we acknowledge it and try\nto understand why we're feeling this way\nloneliness after all is just like any\nother human emotion it's meant to teach\nus something about ourselves we might\nnot yet realize maybe your loneliness is\ntrying to tell you to make a conscious\neffort to get closer to your loved ones\nor maybe it's telling you that something\nneeds to change in your life regardless\nwhatever the reason may be if you're\nseriously struggling with your mental\nhealth the best thing you can do is\nreach out to a mental health care\nprofessional today and seek help if you\nfound this video
