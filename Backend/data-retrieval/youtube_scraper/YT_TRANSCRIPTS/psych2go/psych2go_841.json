    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Did you know that up to 40%\nof the population is introverted?\nAccording to a study by a\nprofessor at McGill University,\nintroversion has many features\nthat are seen in depression,\nlike a limited need for socialization,\ntendency to be alone, and\nan aversion to events.\nHowever, depression and introversion\nare two very different concepts\nthat are often mixed together.\nPeople who are introverted\nmay mistakenly be labeled as depressed,\nwhile someone who is depressed\nmay be labeled as introverted.\nWhile it's true that many people are both,\nin this video will be looking\nat how you can tell the\ndifference between the two.\nDefinitions.\nIntroversion is a trait\ninvolving your preferences\nwith other people.\nAs an introvert, you may\nfind that you enjoy being\nby yourself more than\nbeing with other people.\nYou may find that social situations,\nwhile at times fun, drain you,\nand that you need time alone to recharge.\nDepression is the type of disorder\nthat affects your mood\nand ability to function.\nDepression is most commonly diagnosed\nas major depressive disorder,\nwhich this video will focus on,\nbut can show itself in other conditions\nlike persistent depressive disorder,\nseasonal effective disorder,\nand bipolar disorder, among others.\nWhen dealing with depression,\nyou may notice a lasting sad feeling,\nfeelings of numbness,\na lack of interest in doing\nthings you used to enjoy,\nfeelings of hopelessness or worthlessness,\nand difficulties carrying out tasks.\nWith that, here are some\nsigns that you're depressed\nand not an introvert.\nYou lack energy and motivation.\nOne of the most common\nhallmarks of depression,\naccording to the American\nPsychiatric Association,\nis a lack of energy and motivation.\nHaving depression can make even\nsmall tasks feel impossible\nand taking a nap feel much more desirable.\nThings that you normally would enjoy doing\nare just too hard,\nso you may find yourself sitting out\nof activities much of the time.\nThis is not usually the\ncase for introverts.\nIntroverts may find\nsocial activities draining\nand need recharge time later,\nhowever, they will likely have the energy\nto go out beforehand.\nA person who is introverted\nand not depressed\nwill likely not struggle\nwith feeling overly exhausted\nand unmotivated all the time.\nYou used to enjoy going out.\nAnother big sign of\ndepression is losing interest\nin activities that were\npreviously enjoyed.\nAccording to Crystal Raypole,\na psychology writer from \"Healthline,\"\npeople with depression may find\nthat going out with friends is\nnot as fun as it used to be.\nThis is different from introversion\nas introverts generally do not undergo\na sudden shift in their preference.\nIf you are an introvert,\nyou likely never really enjoy going out,\nno matter your mood.\nOf course, it is natural to\nchange preferences over time,\nand things that were\ninteresting at one time\nmay not be later.\nThis becomes problematic, however,\nwhen you find that nothing\ngives you any enjoyment anymore.\nYou have problems eating,\nsleeping, or working.\nDepression comes with a\nlot more than a low mood.\nYou may find that with it other\nareas of your life change.\nYou may find yourself\novereating or undereating,\nthat you sleep too much or too little,\nand that work is impossible.\nAs an introvert, you may find\nthat this is not the case.\nPsychology writer Jenn Granneman\nfrom \"Psychology Today\" in 2017 states\nthat introversion is\nrelated to your personality,\nand you likely wouldn't experience\na sudden shift in any of\nthese areas because of it.\nYou feel worthless.\nDepression comes with a lot\nof feelings of hopelessness\nand worthlessness.\nThat it is not necessarily\nthe case with introversion.\nAs an introvert, you may\nfind that you're optimistic\nand have a strong sense of\nself and hope for the future.\nAgain, as introversion\nis your personality,\nit'll not have such a drastic\neffect on your emotions.\nAccording to the American\nPsychiatric Association,\nfeelings of worthlessness and hopelessness\nare telltale signs of depression\nand should not be taken lightly.\nWhile introverts may present\nas quiet, reserved, or humble,\nthey do not have a bleak outlook on life\nthat is seen with depression.\nOn the contrary, someone who is depressed\ncan outwardly show\nextroversion and confidence,\nbut deep down feel gloomy.\nAnd finally, you isolate,\nbut not to recharge.\nIt's common with depression\nto self isolate from the outside world.\nIt's also common to do\nthis as an introvert.\nWhile this is the same activity,\nthey're done for different reasons.\nPsychology writer Jenn Granneman explains\nthat with depression,\nyou may isolate yourself\nbecause of feelings of\nunworthiness, hopelessness,\nor lack of energy and motivation.\nWith introversion,\nyou may keep to yourself just\nout of personal preference\nand not because of emotional distress.\nSo while introversion and depression\nare often lumped together,\nthey're two very different things.\nSome people simply\nenjoy their own company,\nand there's nothing wrong with that.\nIf you feel however that you're\nstruggling with depression,\nplease know that there are resources\nand there's help out there.\nGetting in touch with\nthe right professional\ncan be a great first step\nto getting your life back on track.\nThank you for watching this video.\nIf you enjoyed it, please give it a like\nand
