    "transcript": "Sexes or at least should be the sign of\nan unconditional acceptance that we feel\ntowards our partner and that our partner\nfeels towards us\nit is through sex that two people send\neach other those comforting hidden\nmessages\nI think you're beautiful\nI desire you\nI love you nobody even still many times\nour deepest desires go ignored it may\nfeel shameful and humiliating to admit\nthat we sometimes feel dirty for wanting\nmore sex but making love is the\nfundamental drive that makes us human\nwithout sex for most of us our\nrelationship starts to suffer and we\nstart suffering from the inside as well"
