    "transcript": "have you ever been with someone and\nwondered are they in love with you or\njust infatuated with the idea of you\nimagine this butterflies in your stomach\nhot doing the chaa and a constant smile\nplasted on your face ah the Blissful\nfeeling of being in love or is it\nsometimes what seems like love might be\nmore of a love story that they've\ncrafted in their heads than a connection\nwith the authentic you it's a tricky\nsituation and a hard truth to swallow\nbut recognizing the signs can save you\nfrom a World Of Heartache so let's put\nthe pieces together on this puzzle and\nexplore some telltale signs that someone\nmight be head over heels for the idea of\nyou and not the real\ndeal when will my reflection show do you\nfind yourself constantly hiding your\nquirks denying your passions or even\nchanging your opinions to align with\nyour Crushers expectations when we like\nsomeone it's easy to fall into the Trap\nof molding yourself into someone you\nthink they'd like too but if they fall\nin love with this character you've\ncreated instead of the real you what\nthen a genuine connection should\ncelebrate your uniqueness not suppress\nit approval seeking behaviors are you\nguilty of people pleasing especially\ntowards your crush when you're\nconstantly going above and beyond just\nto make your crush happy it's essential\nto ask are you doing it for them or\nbecause you fear losing the affection a\nhealthy relationship thrives on Mutual\nunderstanding not one-sided sacrifices\nwhat do you think will happen when you\nstop with these superficial acts of\nlove everything in common tell us if\nthis sounds familiar you meet someone\nand suddenly it feels like you've known\neach other forever you have almost\neverything in common or do you Rapid\nBonding and shared interests are\nfantastic but if it's all happening at\nwarp speed it might be a sign they're\nmore in love with the fantasy of a\nperfect connection than the real gradual\nbuildup of a genuine relationship so if\nit seems too good to be true it just\nmight be Whirlwind romance speed isn't\nalways an indicator of a successful\nrelationship while Whirlwind romances\nare the stuff of fairy tales they can\nalso be a potential red flag if your\npartner is ready to slap the label of\nrelation ship on your connection before\nyou even finish your first cup of coffee\ntogether it could be a sign they're more\ninvested in the idea of being in love\nthan actually getting to know you it's\nmuch better to pause first and ask\nyourself if you're genuinely getting to\nknow each other or just creating an\nillusion of a deep\nconnection on the rebound if your crush\nis still healing their wounds from their\nprevious breakup be careful they might\njust be on the rebound sometimes people\nrush into new relationships to escape\nthe pain of a recent breakup and\nbouncing from one relationship to the\nnext can be an indicator that someone is\nsearching for the feeling of Love rather\nthan a connection with a specific\nperson unrealistic\nexpectations expectations can be the\nsilent killers of relationships\nfantasizing about the perfect\nrelationship is natural but setting\nunrealistic expectations without\ncommunicating them is a recipe for\ndisappointment open honest conversations\nabout your desires and boundaries can\npave the way for a healthier connection\nso if you're constantly comparing your\ncrush to an ideal it might be a sign\nthat you're more in love with the\nfantasy version you have of them in your\nhead rather than the real\nthem denial and disappointment so how\nwell do you really know your special\nsomeone do you allow them to be their\ntrue authentic self around you if you\ncatch yourself not really letting them\nbe who they truly are it might be time\nto reassess expecting certain things in\na relationship is normal but when those\nexpectations become rigid ideals it can\nbe a slippery slope reality might not\nalways align with fantasy and that's\nokay a healthy relationship is all about\nembracing each other for who we truly\nare not trying to force someone into a\nPicture Perfect\nImage out of the comfort zone ever felt\nlike you were being nudged beyond your\ncomfort zone without a safety net while\nencouraging personal growth is essential\npressuring your crush to be someone\nthey're not is a red flag say for\nexample that you're an introvert and\nthey're an extrovert they keep getting\ninvited to all these social events that\nyou don't want to go to so instead they\njust stay home with you all the time but\ndon't you think it reaches a point when\nit starts to make them unhappy in the\nend it's better to respect their\nboundaries and support them in their\nJourney without pushing them into\nuncomfortable situations\nconceal don't feel got any reasons why\nyou and this person shouldn't be\ntogether what are some ways they might\nnot be a good match for you or maybe\nsome recent mistakes they've made oh you\ncan't think of any selective memory can\nbe a warning sign after all a balanced\nrelationship acknowledges both the highs\nand lows so if you find yourself only\nreminising about the good times and\nignoring your partner's needs or\nconcerns it's time for a reality check\nare you really in love with them or the\nidea of them empty conversations\ncommunication is the glue that holds\nrelationships together so if you or your\nspecial someone shy away from having\nopen and honest conversations it could\nalready be a clue that you're both more\ninterested in preserving a fantasy of\nyour relationship than actually working\non it because genuine connection comes\nfrom embracing the messy but beautiful\nreality of who you are as people and the\nunexpected edness of life when it comes\nto love it's important to keep our eyes\nand hearts open recognizing these signs\ncan be a step towards building a genuine\nconnection and letting love unfold in\nits most genuine form remember you\ndeserve to be loved for who you truly\nare don't settle for someone who's\ninfatuated with the idea of you hold out\nfor the one who sees you accepts you and\nloves you authentically so have you ever\nloved the idea of someone more than the\nactual ual person what made you realize\nit share your stories in the comments\nbelow you can
