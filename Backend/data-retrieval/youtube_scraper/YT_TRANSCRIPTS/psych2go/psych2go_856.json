    "transcript": "hi\nso there's this quote I came across\nabout anger that one moment of patience\ncan save you 100 moments of regret\nso the question then becomes how do you\nbecome that person who in the midst of\nturbulence and turmoil and angry\nemotions\nare calm\nby the end of this video you'll be able\nto walk away with practical tips that\nyou could apply right away to improve\nhow you manage your emotions with\nyourself and your emotions with others\nI'm Monica and I recently graduated with\na degree in neuroscience and I'm now\npursuing medicine\nI'm really passionate about making\nPsychiatry accessible for everyone so\nthis video is a part of the ask an\nexpert Series where we chat about mental\nhealth topics and psychological topics\nwith experts\ntoday I am just so honored to have Dr\nConti back you may remember him from our\nlast live stream which is accessible\nfrom the ask an expert live stream\nplaylist welcome back Dr Conti thanks\nfor having me I'm glad to be back so\nmuch thank you so much for being back\nand I'm so excited for our chat today\nI feel like we have so much to cover and\nso much information and I love that you\nopen saying that we're going to give\neveryone practical examples because what\nwe're going to do is give you really\nreal world stuff that you can\nimmediately take after watching this\nvideo and help your life uh find more\npeace\nexactly with something like anger I feel\nlike it can be so exhausting to just\nhold it in with yourself or just be\nsometimes angry with yourself or angry\nwith others like you know if only we can\nfind a way to better manage that and\nthat's exactly what we'll be just going\nto be diving into today\n100 you know it's fascinating because we\nare the only ones who have unrestricted\naccess to our minds and when you think\nabout this it is it really is powerful\nbecause if we really truly realize that\nthen we'll stop giving our power away to\nother people like we let people who\nanger us who do things we don't like to\ncontrol our inner world and once we\nrealize this we say wait a minute I\ncan't do this anymore\nyou know that really brings up a really\nimportant point and like the kind of\nfirst main idea that I want to bring up\nregarding anger about how to really\nrecognize and control how sometimes\nanger really comes from within because\nsometimes we often think that we're\nangry because someone else made us angry\nor something has happened that just is\nthe reason why we're angry but\nultimately\nit's our decision it's our ability to\ncontrol that what we kind of filter from\nthe world\num that ultimately causes us to be angry\nso I guess we can just jump right into\nany kind of practical tips on how to\nbetter you know have control of your own\nemotions\nyeah the very first thing and we hit on\nthis um last video but if someone hadn't\nseen that yet I want to jump in with\nthis at the beginning and that is this I\nbelieve there's a difference between the\ncart what I call the cartoon world and\nthe real world so our cartoon world and\nI call it cartoon world because it's not\nreal it's the world that it's according\nto our shoulds so people should think\nthe way I want them to think they should\nfeel they should believe what I want\nthem to believe they should do what I\nwant them to do and then there's the\nreal world so there's our cartoon world\nand then there's our the real world and\nthe what I've done for my career is help\npeople learn to align their expectations\nwith reality in other words so Monica\nlet's say I'm driving down the road and\nI'm gonna get I gotta get somewhere and\nwhen I when I'm on the road there's a\nbunch of traffic and I say to myself in\nmy cartoon world this traffic shouldn't\nbe here this shouldn't be happening to\nme right now I'm gonna be really angry\nbut if if I align my expectations with\nreality which is anytime I go out on the\nhighway there could be traffic now I'm\nmore prepared for it doesn't mean I'll\nbe happy when I see the traffic but it\nmeans I'll be more prepared for it and I\nthink that's a really good place to\nAnchor our conversation is that we\nMaster what we practice and if we\npractice being impulsive and reactive\nwell we get really good at that but if\nwe practice being Mindful and in control\nwell we get really good at that too\nI love the last part you just said\nespecially we Master what we practice I\nremember when I Was preparing for exams\njust on the topic of like anxiety\num I would ask myself why am I expecting\nmyself to be so calm when on a\nday-to-day basis when I don't even have\nexams I'm already you know sweating all\nthe time just worried about things like\nit makes no sense so it just bringing it\nback to what we were talking about with\nyour example like having tips to be able\nto just go through every your everyday\nwithout you know having emotional\noutbursts is a way that it's kind of\nprotected so when we have those\nexperiences that can you know drive your\nemotions up it's not you know\noverflowing or it's not going crazy so\nit's a really good point you brought up\nthere well it's it's almost as if if I\nso if I'm talking to you during those\nmoments when you're struggling I would\nalmost want to almost have this Vision\nthat you're putting on boxing gloves and\nhitting yourself and I almost want to\nstop you from hitting yourself like I\nshouldn't be upset right now and I I\nshouldn't be stressed but if you are\nthen you're now you're giving yourself\nthe extra problem of not only am I\nanxious but now I have all these shoulds\nthat I shouldn't be anxious and that\nmakes it even more complicated so at\nleast be easy on yourself from the\nbeginning and recognize that as human\nbeings we are our emotions we'll ebb and\nflow though we'll go up we'll go down\nthey'll be then that's okay it's normal\nbut I think it'll be less extreme if we\naccept it and it'll be more extreme if\nwe say this can't be happening I can't\ntake this that's where we really\nintensify our own emotions\namazing so just already for those who\njust joined us I have written down in my\nhead to number one practice being\nobjective aligning what we kind of see\nwith what actually or what we think with\nwhat is actually happening number two\njust being able to master what we\npractice and hopefully kind of be\naccepting rather than oh just kind of\nrejecting whatever is coming to us and\nhow we feel\num and I wonder if this is really kind\nof well I think actually this is quite\nGeneral like it would apply to anything\nbut any sort of tips that are more kind\nof situation specific\num whether it's like I don't know being\nangry because you know you messed up\nabout something whatever it is there we\ngo let's go that's a perfect one so I\nquite literally did this this morning I\num I can I forgot to uh let my wife know\nabout my schedule so I confused my\nschedule for what I have going on this\nweek so we ultimately remedied it and we\nfixed it and I could switch days on\nthings but in that moment when I\nrealized that I forgot I dropped the\nball and I messed up my schedule I had\nthe immediate thoughts that anybody\nwould have like I practice this every\nday day in and day out but in those\nfirst moments when I thought oh no I\nmessed this up my thoughts could go\nreally negative really quickly and I\ncould get down on myself what I had to\ndo was say stop I'm a human being of\ncourse I'm gonna make mistakes I'm not\ngonna minimize it I'm going to own it\nbut then I'm gonna do the only thing I\ncan do which is work with what I can do\nso I talked to the people about the\nschedule we figured out what we could do\nwe made a plan and we fixed it because\nspending a whole bunch of time saying oh\nthis is terrible and I'm awful that\nwould not really be productive and then\nthat would not help the rest of my day\nmatter of fact I'll give you a little\nteaching tale that I think can be really\nhelpful for this so I like this concept\nso you me we've all messed up and then\nwe get mad at ourselves when we mess up\nso in the land of fools there was this\nguy who had 250 cows and one of his cows\naccidentally fell off a cliff and then\nhe said to himself well now my herd will\nnever be complete it's not complete\nbecause one of them is missing so he\njust started driving the rest of his\ncows off the cliff and as he's driving\noff all 250 cows the the that somebody\nsays to him what are you doing he said\nwell my herd will never be complete so I\nmight as well just get rid of all of\nthem and the people just hit their heads\nand laughed at this foolish man who got\nrid of his 250 cows all because he\nmessed up on one of them and it's a\nteaching tale so don't worry no cows\nwere harmed in the making of This\nmetaphor but the great thing about this\nlesson is if we mess up and then we\nstart beating ourselves up we start to\nlet those mistakes compound and so it\ncomes back to saying why am I pushing my\nmetaphorical cows off the edge of the\ncliff yes I lost one but that doesn't\nmean I'm going to drive the rest of them\noff the cliff\nyeah so I think it kind of when you were\ngiving that story it really reminds me\nof the idea of like just taking\nresponsibility because at that time like\nwhen that person is like you know\nthrowing out their cows or whatever\ndriving them off the The Cliff to them\nthey're like oh like I don't even know\nwhat what do you think is going on their\nminds like hypothetically when someone's\njust doing something that they know is\nactually causing something to be\nworsening the overall outcome like what\nis actually going on\nso I specialize in working with people\nconvicted of violent crimes my this has\nbeen my my the specialty of my\nprofession for what I've done for two\ndecades and what I see is that when\npeople live in shame they act out of\nShame so if I feel like I'm no good I'm\nworthless I'm nothing then why not hurt\nmyself or others and there is a\ndifference between guilt and shame so\nguilt is feeling bad about something\nwe've done to hurt someone that's normal\nthat's healthy like if we do something\nwe feel guilt we can learn from it\nthat's okay\nguilt is feeling bad about something\nwe've done shame however is feeling bad\nabout who we are and my research for\nmore than two decades has shown me that\nwhen people live in shame they act out\nof Shame so that's what happens in\npeople's minds when they can they start\nto get this sense of shame or I'm no\ngood and so and so they start to develop\nthis narrative that is really hurtful to\nto their own inner peace first and\nforemost but then that starts to go out\ntoward the world and now I say well well\nI already messed up this relationship so\nnow I'm just going to be angry at the\nnext person and I'm going to be spiteful\nto the next person and so until you stop\nand reset it can keep compiling no\ndifferently than the person who's\npushing the cows off the edge of the\ncliff\nso the idea of responsibility how does\none then kind of switch take that\nresponsibility to then say okay what I'm\ndoing is wrong like maybe it's not the\nmost productive let's just say not the\nmost productive and how can I become and\nchannel that into someone I want to be\nand someone who's like you know\njust being more doing more healthy\ndecisions actually more healthy so I\nthat's such a great question I think to\nme like that exemplifies your Insight\nand Consciousness to be able to say okay\nso what do I do so I I think that when\nwe can start to say now what now what do\nwe do the past is gone and there's\nnothing we can do no matter how much\nInsight we ever get to get one single\nsecond back the Futures hypothetical\nhasn't been created yet the only moment\nthat exists is this moment and so the\nquestion is what do we do from this\nmoment forward you know I did\num uh over 100 episodes of a podcast\ncalled tackling life with NFL legend Ray\nLewis first ballot Hall of Fame football\nplayer and we interviewed an astronaut\nonce did I tell you about read wise been\nthe last time we talked I mean I might\nnot have mentioned it but I don't think\nso I don't think you hear it yeah I did\nso Reed Wiseman is one of my favorite\ninterviews I ever got to do and he's an\nastronaut who walked in space and when\nyou think about the magnitude of that\nfewer than 200 people in the history of\nhumanity have walked in space and yet\nthis astronaut walked in space I got to\nspeak to it was awesome\nso one of the things that he said and I\ndon't remember if it was on our show\nwere off air what but it was this it was\nwhen you're in space and something goes\nwrong you don't have time to think oh I\nI can't believe Sally didn't fix that\nyou know I can't believe Bill let this\nhappen the only thing you can do when\nyou're hurling through space in a\nspaceship is work the problem what can I\ndo From This Moment forward so to me\nthere is a Brilliance to your question\nwhat do we do now the past is gone the\nfuture hasn't been created so what can\nwe do in this moment and what I say and\nthis is the most concrete thing that I\ncan give you is be accurate with your\nlanguage be accurate it wasn't the end\nof the world it wasn't the worst thing\nin the world you made a mistake so what\ndo I do now well I can be accurate with\nmy language I can I can stop myself\nfrom perpetuating this extreme language\nI'm terrible this was awful the person\nwho cut me off in traffic they're a\nhorrible person no the car drove a\nlittle closer to my car than I wanted it\nto you know the person at work said\nsomething that I would have preferred\nshe not say like as really when I'm\naccurate it really curtails the amount\nof anger that I'm about to have\ncan I just say this advice was shared\nfrom the last episode of The Last of the\npodcast and it is life-changing since\nyou've said that I have applied it to my\nown life not only for just like anger\nbut just on my day-to-day basis and it\nhas just elevated my happiness and the\nway that I see things so thank you I'm\njust going to type it in the chat for\nanyone here who has missed it because\nit's truly life-changing so thank you so\nmuch thank you no and I feel I feel um\ngrateful that you share it like that and\nphrase it like that because what I do at\nthis point in my career January I've\nbeen doing this work for 25 years and\nwhat I do is at this point in my career\nwhen I do presentations and I I do a lot\nof uh trainings on yield theory that I\ncreated so we'll do three day five day\ntrainings and what I do is I say look\nthese are exciting because I take 25\nyears of sitting down with people more\nthan 20 000 hours of clinical experience\nbeing last humbled to sit one-on-one\nwith people where they share their most\nintimate secrets with me and I take the\ninformation that was truly life-changing\nthose moments that made a change and\nhelped them shift and I get to give all\nof those in like a condensed way and\nthat's why I get excited about what I\nshare why I'm excited when you and I\nspeak why I love how hungry you are for\ninformation because when we can make\nthis information applicable to everyone\nout there who's watching it really is a\ngame changer life-changing stuff doesn't\nmean it has to be some you have to have\nthese lights come on and the music it\ngoes wait a minute this technique if I\napply it day in day out will radically\nshift the way I experience life that's\nwhat it is and I think this is perfect\nbecause it really draws back to the idea\nthat we mentioned earlier when I am\naccurate with my language I'm better\nable to disentangle my expectations with\nmy reality when I thought that I was\ngoing to get just last week when I sat\nin my med school exams 25 on my exams\nlike I was very sure I was like I'm\ngoing to fail this exam I'm going to get\na 25. I then took a step back I was like\nwait no I studied more than half of this\nmaterial my friends have quizzed me on\nthis and I've been able to answer more\nthan 50 of it I don't think I'll\nnecessarily fail but maybe I won't do as\nwell as I wanted to and even that like\nrecognizing that helped me realize what\nI told myself versus like what the\nreality really was and that in turn\nhelped me reduce my anxiety which you\nknow is amazing so I think being able to\napply this for like all the different\nscenarios whether it's anger anxiety I\ndon't know like sadness is a really\ngreat tool\num and with that I just wanted to pick\nup in the second point that you\nmentioned about yield Theory because\nwe've mentioned so many applicable tools\none that I think someone has just\nmentioned right now Dasha how to\ncommunicate without getting angry so\nfast like these kind of things but what\nis the theory behind it and I know uh\nyou created yield Theory and you know I\nwould love to learn more about the\ntheory sorry so I would love so I'm\ngrateful so here's here's let me take\nyou back to the beginning in 1998 I was\nin my room and I was in a meditation and\nI had this vision and here was the\nvision here's how it kind of came\nunfolded to me and I've spent the rest\nof that time refining it and now it is\nan evidence-based approach uh it's a\ntheory on counseling and it's I wrote\nabout it and walking through anger but\nlet me show you the initial metaphor so\nmy I was thinking like let's say a car\nis going down the uh the highway the\nwrong way and you want to stop that car\nwell you could drive head first into\nthat car head on and you could stop that\ncar but one or both of you is going to\nget pretty hurt but what if what if\ninstead of smashing into this car going\nthe wrong way instead you say you know\nwhat I'm gonna merge with it like at a\nyield sign I'm going to yield with this\ncar and I'm going to go I'm going to go\nwith I'm going to go with oh trying to\nget my hands to this guy so I'm going to\ngo with it now as I'm driving with this\ncar my car next to this car this is the\nhypothetical thought experiment so let's\nsuspend reality\nthe car says okay we're driving in the\nsame direction let's save some gas so I\njump in their car and now I'm seeing out\nof their wind chill I'm actually seeing\nanother windshield that they're staying\nout of and over time when they trust me\nI'll say it's a long enough Journey they\nget tired they say I want you to drive\nand now I get to be in their exact chair\nand then I can help steer them down a\ndifferent path and that was the original\nmetaphor for yield Theory meet people\nwhere they are do your best to see from\ntheir perspective and this is more than\njust walking a metaphorical Mile in\nsomeone's shoes this is me imagining\nthat I had a person's cognitive\nfunctioning so I had their intellect\ntheir affective range their ability to\nexperience emotions and their life\nexperiences and what I say and this is a\nthis is powerful metaphor this is this\nis big what I say is I believe that if I\nwould have lived every day as another\nperson I would have made every single\ndecision they made and the reason why\nthat's a very big assumption is this I\nwork with people I specialize in\nviolence I work with people convicted of\nviolent crimes I work with serial\nmurderers I work with people who are\nserial rapists so how can I say if I was\nthem I would have done everything they\ndid well first of all it's not a a\nphilosophical logical argument right\nit's an a priori argument that doesn't\nmake logical sense but here's what it\ndoes for me when I'm able to say because\nwe often say well I had a hard life and\nI didn't do that or I had a tough\nsituation and I didn't do that they knew\nyou had your brain doing that you had\nyour intellect doing that so imagine\nyou're that other person now here's what\nthis does it wipes away judgment for me\nso then when I meet people where they\nare and let's say someone's really angry\nI can listen to that person and I can\ntruly listen without judgment and I can\nsay look the past is gone I can't change\na single second of the past but if I\nlisten to you and I validate what you're\nexperiencing now we get you out of that\nanger and I can help move toward helping\nyou make better decisions\nso that's the substance and ultimately\nyield Theory comes down to doing three\nthings because I told you last time\nMonica I try to make things really\nsimple for people so I think we're\nalways skeptical of other people like\nwe're skeptical especially if someone\ndisagrees with us boy we can be\nskeptical all day but I always say I\nwant to be skeptical of my own ego I\nwant to be skeptical of my own thoughts\nI want to challenge my own thoughts so I\nsat back and I said to myself what do I\nreally do like I stand at a cell door\nand maximum security prisons and I I\ntalk to people I I sit in a comfortable\nZen setting in my office and I talk to\npeople what do I do and I do three\nthings and this is what I would tell\npeople to do I listen I validate and I\nexplore options so you're you're with\nthat family member who's so angry and\nmaybe they're being really self-centered\nI've seen a couple comments say how do I\ndeal with a narcissistic family and I I\nsee that word come up a lot in the chat\nand so think about this they're really\nself-centered you might your your\ninitial thought is I'm gonna go tell\nthem what they need to do differently\nbut they're not going to hear that so\nthat's like smashing the car head on you\ncan tell them they're wrong but they're\nnot going to listen to you but if you\nput yourself behind their eyes and you\ntruly listen to them and then you\nvalidate that experience like my\ngoodness that sounds like that was\nreally awful for you that sounds like\nthat was really difficult for you and\nonce they and here's the key not just\nvalidating but validate until they feel\nvalidated because you know as well as I\ndo we all want to be heard and if\nsomebody keeps saying things over and\nover again that person probably doesn't\nfeel heard so we can help them really\nfeel heard now that we're validating\nthem now they feel better neural\nlogically and you know this from\nNeuroscience when you're angry you're in\nyour limbic system you're in your\namygdala and you're getting really fired\nup that's that fight or flight response\nonce you feel validated and that\nemotional release now you move to more\nthe frontal cortex your higher level\ndecision making and now we can explore\noptions now we can say okay now where do\nwe go from here what's the best decision\nto make From This Moment forward so it's\npowerful I know there's a lot to take in\nbut it's it's powerful\nso I'm just going to summarize and just\nto make sure that I completely\nunderstood at the core of yield theory\nis to really take someone's perspectives\nand to see what they try to see what\nthey see and to meet them where they are\nand to really break it down it's to\nreally listen to actually think about\nthe meaning of the words they're saying\nnot just kind of listening like whatever\nlike actually what are they trying to\ntell me to validate to make them\nactually feel like they are heard not\njust saying yes I'm so sorry like no\nlike actually listening\num validating and then coming up with\nsolutions that you guys can both agree\nlike kind of meeting in the middle\nthat's kind of why John from it that's\nphenomenal that's that's phenomenal it's\nit's incredible because it's funny\nbecause like in this comments you have\ntons of people and they're all talking\nabout different things but I happen to\nsee on one they go well if Monica's\nshaking her head she's not listening and\nhere you go you just accurately\nsummarized everything I just said and so\nsometimes we look at other people and we\nhave a projection that what we're seeing\nseeing is the truth when we truly take\ntime to listen we go wait a minute maybe\nthe world's not unfolding the way I\nthink and that's challenging our own\negos honestly that's one of the toughest\nthings that any of us has to do because\nour ego is our sense of self and our ego\nwants to say I'm right and everyone else\nis wrong but that's not reality reality\nis we all can challenge our own egos\nand so I have a few follow-up questions\nactually one that has just been coming\nup from the chat what do you do in terms\nof exploring options when the other\nperson is unwilling to explore those\noptions because ultimately it takes two\nto tango doesn't it it does it does so\nmy co-career has been I've spent a lot\nof time with people who have been\nmandated to see me like think about this\nin the state of California I had a\ncenter for people convicted of violent\ncrimes now once they get out of prison\nfor committing a violent crime they were\nsentenced to 52 weeks of Anger\nManagement this is outpatient this is\noutside of prison\nand they had to come to this anger\nmanagement they had to pay for it out of\npocket so you can imagine how angry\npeople were to see me now I could sit\nand be like well they're just angry\nthey're resistant or I can put myself\nbehind their eyes and go wow if I just\nspent time in prison or jail and I got\nsentenced to do this too I would be\nangry as well\nand so I would really listen and I would\nvalidate that and I wouldn't force\npeople to talk I would say listen if you\nif you need more time you need more time\nlike who am I to say when you're ready\nto speak and because I wasn't doing it\nas a technique I wasn't doing it to say\nokay now now you should hurry up and\nspeak I was being genuine like if you\nneed time to be angry be angry and\nbecause of that when you truly let go\nthen people will be much more likely to\nactually speak so if you find someone\nwho's not ready to talk and you say well\nI did listen and I did validate them so\nthey should talk now you're probably\njumping to that cartoon world I I\nvalidated them enough now you're talking\nabout you you talk about your own ego\nand what you did and that's why I always\nsay Monica and this is a big one for\nthat person who asked that question when\nyou validate don't just validate till\nyou check a box and go see I did it\nvalidate until that person actually\nfeels validated and again you know this\nfrom Neuroscience when people are angry\nthey're in that limbic system and when\nyou can you could watch if people are\nspeaking to you and there's brain\nscanners they're under brain scan that\nanger once once you validate them it\ndissipates now you actually see blood\nflow in different parts of the brain\nspecifically going to that frontal\ncortex so this is I always tell people\nwhat I'm saying isn't rocket science\nthis stuff is I'm not saying this is\nrocket science\num it's pretty simple right less than\nvalidated explore options but it is\nneuroscience this is definitely\nNeuroscience yes I would just like to\nsay\num so when\nin class people were saying what's the\nbest way to kind of dissipate these like\nemotions sometimes during like you know\nanger and things like that honestly it's\nthe sleep\njust sleep in other words to just take a\nstep back until you feel ready to\naddress it when other people feel ready\nto dress it because the reality is that\njust like you said not everyone is ready\nto like let go of whatever they're being\nangry at and it's okay to have space\nbecause only through space only through\nfeeling ready are you able to\neffectively explore options whether that\nis like you know giving space through\nsleeping giving space through taking\nwalks giving space through I don't know\nmeditating any of these things are\nperfectly valid to just take a step back\nwell that's you're right you hit the\nnail on the head so think about this how\nmany times have we all been hangry you\nknow we're hungry so we get agitated and\nirritable we start an argument and after\nwe eat we go what were we mad about we\ndon't remember right or you stay up\narguing in a fight and it's because you\nstart arguing because honestly one or\nboth of you is overly tired so the\nprofound realization is this when you're\nhungry when you're tired when you're\nthirsty when your body's temperature is\nawful you're over overheated you're in a\npart of your brain called the\nhypothalamus and that is smack dab in\nthe middle of your limbic system so it\nmakes a lot of sense that when you're\nhungry you feel a little bit more\nagitated and irritable when you're\noverly tired and you haven't slept so we\nhave this new puppy she's a six month\nold Kane Corso she's awesome she's so\nfun she's beautiful I wish and she was\ndown here I'd pull her up so you guys\ncan see maybe next time I'll have her\nyes she's so she's so adorable but she\ndoes something my wife will say she's\nfussing it out when she's real tired\nshe's like and she looks like if\nsomebody's watching oh she's scary she's\nnot scaring us she's fussing it out and\nhow many of us do the same thing we're\nangry we're agitated we're irritable so\nif we could be mindful maybe now's not\nthe right time to get your point into\nthe other person but the challenge many\nof us face is that we're impatient and\nso when we want to tell somebody\nsomething we start talking at them\nrather than with them and I don't know\nif I told you about the Fool On The\nMountain last time but I want to share\nthat I think this will be a perfect time\nfor people to hear that story let's hear\nit there was a there was a person he was\nsupposed to lead a group of people up\nthe mountain so he ran to the top of the\nmountain and he got to the top and\nnobody was with him they were all at the\nbottom of the mountain so he started\nscreaming at them he's like you you\nshould be up here with me I started down\nthere I had it tough I made it up here\nand he's yelling and yelling at them\nwhere they should be but they couldn't\neven see him let alone hear him so he\nbecomes known as The Fool on the\nmountain and before we judge this fool\non the mountain how many times have you\nand I and all of the people who are\nwatching us right now how many times\nhave all of us at times talked at people\nlike you should understand what I'm\nsaying like like you shouldn't be\nthinking what you're thinking right now\nin those moments we were no different\nthan that fool on the mountain and so\nthat's why yield theory is about having\nthe self-discipline to leave where we\nare and go truly meet others where they\nare psychologically what they're ready\nwilling and able to hear and the reality\nis many times it's going to take more\npatience than what we want to give but\nhere's another key and this is one of\nthose moments that like I feel excited\nfor people to hear this because if I\ncould reach in your heart and have you\nreally feel this this would be a game\nchanger and that is when you truly let\ngo and you in interact with people and\nyou give them the compassion to say I'm\ngoing to meet you where you are and give\nyou the true space the truth is when\nyou're truly let go it'll happen so much\nfaster than what you think when you\nactually take the time you will you will\nvalidate it'll get you there so much\nfaster\nand patience is really the key of\neverything I think and that's why like\nduring the times when I Journal I always\ntell myself how can I be at a place\nwhere I feel like whatever could happen\nto me I have patience I have patience\nfor whatever that whatever is going to\nhappen\nto eventually happen like to take steps\nto make sure that whatever I want to\nhappen is going to happen sorry and I\nthink if I could just share some of the\nthings I found really helpful like\nmindfulness was truly a key to that I\nmean every single morning I will wake up\nand I will listen even two minutes of\njust mindfulness guided meditation it\nhas been so helpful to help me\nbe more patient with myself and to be\nmore patient with others and I think\nthat draws in so closely with being able\nto then practice yield Theory and to\nreap the benefits from it it's that that\nis exactly it so we have a question here\nfrom will J he asks do you have any\ntechniques to become more patient in\nyourself to become less impulsive and\nwill I love this question and hits on\nwhat Monica is talking about right there\nyou heard her use the word practice\nwe're practicing this so here's one of\nthe most pragmatic techniques you can\npossibly do here's how you begin to\ndevelop patience remember that we Master\nwhat we practice so if you practice\ndaily every time something doesn't go\nthe way you think it should you lash out\nall right you get really good at that\nbut so what do we want to do if we want\nto develop patience let's do the\nopposite so let's say I'm thirsty right\nnow I have big jar of water when I'm\nthirsty the moment I'm thirsty instead\nof grabbing it and Downing it I grab my\nwater and I use the exact phrase that\nyou use Monica which is mindfulness and\nI say okay I am thirsty it's not the end\nof the world let me take a moment\ntake a breath now after taking one\nbreath now I can drink\nthe next time I go to take a drink of\nwater I might take two breaths and what\nI'm going to do is I'm going to\nconsciously say when I want to do when I\nhave the impulse to do something I don't\nhave to satiate it I don't have to\nsatisfy it immediately I can take a\nbreath I can take two breaths three to\nfour and then I can do this I can\npractice this in other areas that's just\nthe first one that came to my mind\nyou'll have water right here whatever\nyou want to do will think about whatever\nyou have that you're about to do take\none breath now I'm mindful because I've\ndone this long enough that somebody out\nthere watching goes well I practiced\nthat I tried that once it didn't work\nwell just the way you can't do one\npush-up and think now you're strong and\nyou can't do 10 push-ups and think you\nhave to do them consistently over time\nand if you do enough push-ups and you do\nthem consistently over time you will get\nstronger that's a fact that's a\nphysiological fact and if you quit doing\npush push-ups for a long period of time\nyou'll lose that strength so it's\nsomething you have to practice the same\nis true with mindfulness if you've\npracticed it once a long time ago or you\nheard about mindfulness or you get\nexcited when you hear other people talk\nabout how they practice it that's not\nyou practicing it you have to actually\npractice it day in day out and I promise\nyou the more you practice it the better\nyou'll get at it and one more last\nthought on this will if you\nintentionally throughout your day say\nI want to get better at patients today\nwell here's a blessing the world is\ngoing to give you tons of opportunities\nthe universe can say here you go I'm\ngonna give you a bunch of opportunities\ntoday will\num the people you're around they're\ngonna make you up there every all kind\nof opportunities so now what are you\ngoing to do intentionally you're going\nto say I'm going to practice patience\njust as sure as I would practice weight\nlifting by having those weights I'm\ngoing to have all these Troublesome\nmoments I'm gonna practice patience\nI love how you brought that up because\nwhen you were saying that I just thought\nlike people go to exercise to feel\nhealthier like physically this is just\nthe same practicing mindfulness it's\nlike going for an exercise but for your\nbrain I love it it's like a little like\nit's not like you go exercise and the\nnext day you'll be like having the\nfigure that you always wanted to have it\ntakes time and just like that like At\nfirst I would like to say like I was\nkind of I don't know not really sure\nabout whether mindfulness would work or\nnot because I've just heard it's been so\ncommercialized things like that but when\nI actually was open to it like adjusting\nthat initial down being like okay I'm\nwilling to challenge my preconceptions\nand then practice it not just for a day\nbut for a month and then tell myself\nafter a month if I don't like it that's\nfine but like actually having that\nconcrete date I was actually able to\nreally kind of take in all what\nmindfulness has to offer and so I'd like\nto kind of give that advice if I may for\nyou know everything that was mentioned\ntoday you might have applied it before\nbut have you actually like really really\nbelieved it like or at least was open to\nit because if you do something but then\nyour mind is like oh I actually don't\nreally believe in it you're like\nfighting yourself and that's not gonna\nwork you know like that has been one of\nmy learning points in the past few\nmonths so I thought I'd just share that\nyeah I coined a term called the foot and\nthe water principle and so I got this\nfrom uh well my Center when I was in\nCalifornia I'm not there anymore but\nwhen I was in California my Center was\nin South Lake Tahoe California and so uh\nTahoe is a mountain lake it's a cold\nlake so if somebody wants to say that\nthey swam in Tahoe they can't just tap\ntheir toe in the water be like oh I swam\nin Tahoe no if you want to say you swing\nyou gotta dive all the way in and in the\nsame way if you practice any of the\ntechniques that we've talked about today\nand you do them one time and you go see\nit didn't work well then you were\nlooking for it to not work and of course\nyou're gonna find find that if you want\nto see something not work of course\nyou'll not it won't work so it's a\nmatter of doing it like you said\ndedicate yourself for a month to\nsomething practice it constantly but if\nyou're practicing it trying to say it\ndoesn't work I have a really good\nexample for this so\nin martial arts I did martial arts my\nwhole life and in martial arts let's say\nsomeone comes to a gym and they're\ntrying to learn what to do if someone\npushes you if you're trying to learn\nwhat to do and you go up to the teacher\nand the teacher says go ahead and push\nme and you walk up and you just you lean\nAll Your Way backwards and you just try\nto push like you're just trying to run\nbackwards the teacher is going to say\nthat's not how people push you don't run\naround going let me jump backwards you\npush you go through it but if you want\nto walk into that martial arts studio\nand say these martial art techniques\ndon't work see I go like this and it\ndoesn't that you're not actually doing\nit so if you're going to do mindfulness\nand not actually do it then of course\nyou can confirm what your ego wants you\nto believe which is that you're right\nand whatever you believe right now is\nabsolute truth and you have nowhere\nnothing else to learn in your life your\nego is going to try to convince you of\nthat but to challenge it is going to\ntake effort and practice but I promise\nyou it's worth it it's it's it's worth\nit like I'm easy to find in an internet\nage I don't give people stuff that\ndoesn't work and I promise you this\nstuff works it does take effort we\nMaster what we practice\nabsolutely I know we've covered a lot\ntoday so just to wrap up I want to give\nsome of my own thoughts and just like\nsummary of some of the tips that you\ncould literally practice right after\nthis video I think one of my favorite\nones is just being accurate with your\nlanguage making sure that what you\nperceive as your expectations actually\naligns with what reality is because that\nis a great way to reduce you know anger\njust stress any sort of negative\nemotions I've tried it myself and it\nworks and I'd love to hear from the\ncommunity if you've tried it as well and\njust you know get in touch and let me\nknow what works what doesn't and we will\nalways be able to have a chat in the\nfuture episodes with any further\nquestions further follow-up questions\nanother major point that I want to bring\nup again was just the idea about meeting\npeople from where they are on the idea\nof yield Theory being able to listen\nbeing able to actually validate and\nbeing able to explore options when you\nfeel ready and when others as well feels\nready\num so I think those are the main\ntakeaway points but there there's just\nso many wonderful valuable information\nthat you've shared thank you so much Dr\nConte for everything really I appreciate\nyou having me back on like I I I'm\nexcited about what you guys do you do\nsuch a you personally do such a great\njob psych2go does such a great job\nyou're spreading conscious information\nand awareness so I'm grateful to be a\npart of it and my door will be open to\ncome back on in the future because I\nfeel like there is so much more to talk\nabout there's so many different things\nfor instance one person asked if if um\njournaling is helpful and of course it\ncan be helpful absolutely a lot of times\nit can be helpful just because once you\nwrite your ideas down you crystallize\nthem so if I write it down I go wait\nthis sometimes our anxiety gets so big\nin our minds and our anger gets so big\nthat it's we're allowing it to just get\nbigger and bigger but then when we write\nit down we go I'm angry because\nso-and-so expressed an opinion that was\ndifferent than mine oh wait that's\nreally not as big as I thought and and\nso once we crystallize it yeah that can\nhelp a lot journaling can be super\nhelpful for people so that's something\nthat you like to rely on that's\nwonderful again there's so many\nquestions here and um what a you know\nI'm grateful to be a part of this uh\nprocess and coming back on the show for\nsure\nI know that so many people have just\nloved things that you've been sharing\nand I really want to direct them to your\nbook would you like to share a video\nabout your book and um\nhere we go everyone walking through\nanger so walking through anger and it's\nreally like if you like how I tell\nstories can't figure out the camera but\nif you like how I tell stories\num of well probably over a hundred\nlittle teaching tales in this book\num where I I love to teach with who Zen\nTales I was a professor and I loved when\nI taught every year I taught mostly\nMasters and doctoral students but once a\nyear I would teach undergraduate\nstudents and we would have up to 200\nstudents in the an auditorium and like I\nalways knew I wanted to keep their\nattention so I would tell stories a\nbunch and so when I tell this this book\neven if you don't struggle with anger\nit's really about how do you handle your\nown intense emotions whether it's\nanxiety depression and then how do you\nhandle other people when they're in a\ndifficult situation and I also have that\non audiobook too so I read that book for\naudible so it's on there so that's one\nway they can get a hold of me and then\nthe other one is I have a YouTube\nchannel as well\num and so yeah I'd love for people to\ncheck that out\namazing so everything is linked down in\nthe description box below until then\nplease let us know what you would like\nto hear next in the comment section or\nyou can get in touch through email at\nMonica that's like to go.net thank you\nso much and have a fantastic day\nthank you again"
