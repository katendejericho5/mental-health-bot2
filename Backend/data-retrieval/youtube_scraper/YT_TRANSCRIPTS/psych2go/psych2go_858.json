    "transcript": "some of us shoot up at 7am without the\nhelp of an alarm clock While others only\nat the pillow at 7am so what really\ndictates your choice of sleep schedule\nwell the Circadian rhythm of your body\nis responsible for regulating your sleep\npatterns genetics weighs less than half\nof your preference in your sleep\nschedule and its environmental social\nand personal factors that make up for\nthe rest of your sleep schedule\naccording to research reported in\nInsider 2022 there are six distinct\ntypes of sleepers morning Larks are most\nproductive from 9am to 11AM afternooners\nbeing the most active from 11 to 5 PM\nNappers wake up alert but as the day\nprogresses their energy dwindles before\nre-energizing by mid-afternoon\nnight owls tend to sleep much later\nSwifts are those super robots that are\nalert for the whole day until they\nnaturally fall asleep and finally the\nlast type are woodcocks and those are\nconstantly running on five percent of\ntheir battery's capacity from the moment\nthey wake up to bedtime\nso what does your choice of sleep\nschedule reveal about you here's a\ncomparison of the two extremes a morning\nLark and a night owl which one are you\nnumber one who's happier\na 2008 study published in the journal\nsocial indicators research found that\nmorning Larks are often happier and have\nhigher life satisfaction compared to\ntheir Night Owl counterparts a large\ncontributing factor to that is morning\nLarks get better social support as they\nfit better into the majority of society\nthat is most active in the daytime night\nowls on the other hand often have a\ntougher time integrating into society\npartially because they may not have the\nbest familial relationships as they miss\nout on family times with their sleeping\nschedules\nin the morning Lark's workplace they are\nable to be productive right from the\nget-go and operate easily in the\nstandard nine to five hours and as such\nmorning Larks tend to thrive in a\ncorporate world\nnumber two who's smarter\naccording to a study published in the\nJournal of Personality and individual\ndifferences night owls are often found\nto be more intelligent than morning\nLarks as opposed to the common saying\nearly birds get the worm\nthe study States the results indicate\nthat contrary to Conventional folk\nwisdom evening types are more likely to\nhave higher intelligence scores\nnight owls were also found to have\nbetter processing speed and better\nmemory retention than morning larks in a\nseparate study at University of liege in\nBelgium they found that both morning\nLarks and night owls are productive\nafter waking up naturally but morning\nLark's productivity falls off after 10.5\nhours of being awake\nnight owls proved to be more consistent\nwith their focus and productivity with\nfaster reaction time however night owls\nperform poorly academically but night\nowls are at a disadvantage considering\nschool always starts early\nnumber three who's more creative while\nboth early risers and late risers do\nexperience bursts of creative ideas\nstudies show that early risers do not\nhave these as much as the night owls it\ncould possibly be linked to morning\nLarks usually going by a routine in\ncontrast to night owls who have to learn\nearly on to be creative to adapt to\ntheir out-of-norm living Style\n2008 study on art students in Taiwan\npublished in the international Journal\nof Art and Design education found that\nmore than half of the art students felt\nmore creative after 10 pm\ncreativity strikes most when the mind\nwanders night owls are often left alone\nto a quiet atmosphere without the hustle\nand bustle of the city allowing their\nminds to freely roam\nso what does your sleep schedule reveal\nabout you\ntake everything with a grain of salt\nthere's very little research and much\nneeded studies on sleep personality and\nbehavior and most of us are not just a\nmorning Lark or night owl but a mix of\nboth\nwhat's most important regardless of your\nsleep schedule is that you have a good\ncycle of light and deep sleep and you\ncan wake up refreshed and feeling your\nbest\ndo you feel you're a mix of the two or\nare you simply a night owl or a napper a\nwoodcock sleeper feel free to let us\nknow in the comments down below\nif you enjoyed this video hit the like\nbutton and share it with a friend and if\nyou want to see more videos like this\ndon't forget to subscribe to our Channel\nthanks so much for watching psych2goers"
