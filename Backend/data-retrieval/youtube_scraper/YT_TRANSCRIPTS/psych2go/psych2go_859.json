    "transcript": "you know what's even better than just\nbeing in a relationship it's being in a\nrelationship and knowing where it's\ngoing it's understood that the hashtag\nrelationship goals posts aren't the full\npicture and that the intensity of the\ninitial infatuation levels out over time\nbut how do you know if you're not just\nleveling out but slowly making your way\nto the exit do you work even harder on\nthe relationship or are the signs\nmotioning you towards the solo fly zone\nwe won't tell you what to do and only\nyou can decide for yourself when enough\nis enough however here are some signs\nthat when frequent could mean it's time\nto make a relationship status change\nnumber one what is the problem no one\ncan agree to work on an issue together\nno matter the method you first have to\nall agree on what it is so you're both\nworking on the same thing if one partner\nbelieves the other is the source of all\nproblems and the other thinks that it's\nthe dirty dishes causing the fights\nfrustration will Skyrocket when each\nparty tries to solve a different problem\ncommon ground is required to make real\nchange each party making half-baked\npotatoes does not a meal make\nnumber two you would rather spend time\nanywhere else but with them\ncalm down we get it the pandemic force\ndoes all into constant Close Quarters\nfor way longer than any of us planned\nneeding to have a couple of hours of\nalone time here and there is totally\nnormal and healthy we're so not\ndiscouraging that what is a sign of this\nmight be the end though is when the\nfeeling of wanting to be away is\nconstant\nmaybe to the point where you might try\nactively finding other things to do\neither alone or with other people solely\nto not spend time with your partner\nnumber three you're getting serious cold\nfeet about the Future Let's whip out our\ncrystal ball and just kidding none of us\nknow the future all we can do is plan\nsmartly for it and have some contingency\nplans if things make a detour so when\nyou're looking ahead but realize that\neither your partner doesn't fit anywhere\nin that picture even if you really want\nthem to or if you feel deeply uneasy\nabout it don't ignore it this could be a\nchance to look at things as a whole and\nobjectively figure out why you feel this\nway number four you're both firmly\ngrowing in different directions\nchange is good even if it doesn't feel\nthat way in the moment a mark of growth\nis change however that doesn't mean we\ngrow the same way\nthis isn't good or bad just different\ndepending on your needs you may choose\nto get out the gardening gear and work\non growing together adjusting to each\nother's changes\nsometimes though the paths are wildly\ndifferent or one partner is rigidly\nfixated on their path so growing\ntogether isn't reasonable or possible\nthis might be a sign to flourish\nsomewhere else\nnumber five\nyou see only their flaws love is blind\nand isn't that true in the beginning we\ntend to ignore all the flaws at first\nover time sure when we see some and\naccept them along with their positive\ntraits\nshould the way you view them now be the\ncomplete opposite of the beginning and\ngnaw their flaws override everything\nelse that may be good about them\nmaybe things are starting to derail one\nyou're not only noticing mostly their\nflaws but are outwardly complaining\nabout them to your friends all the time\nto the point where they might start\nasking why are you even with them\nthat could well be a sign that Calling\nit Quits could be healthy for both of\nyou\nnumber six the prospect of another\npartner seems more appealing\ndon't worry too much about that cute\nbartender you saw or the attractive\nco-worker you noticed is attractive\nwe're still human and just because\nyou're in a relationship doesn't mean\nyou suddenly don't know what good\nlooking is\ndo note if while thinking about someone\nelse you're also entertaining leaving\nyour partner for them if the notice\nundermines the connection with your\npartner this could be a sign that the\nconnection is weakened and maybe on the\nverge of breaking number seven your\narguments are escalating\nagreements can be healthy helping us to\nlearn more about each other if they\nbecome discussions with solutions that\nis\nwas not healthy arguments that are\nconstant Petty and have no solution\nmaybe the argument was never meant to\nhave a solution and you're both just\nhurling anger at each other like\nsupercharged Fireballs the only intent\nbeing to hurt the other person so don't\nthrow in the towel if there's a fight\nbut it isn't a bad idea to assess what\nexactly is the goal of this fight if\nit's simply for Mutual destruction the\nrelationship May well be over our\nrelationships can be hard we know\nnothing truly good ever came easy so\nit's understandable that sometimes we\ngive more time thought and patience to\nour partners than we would to others\neven so it's always good to know your\nown boundaries so you can see when it's\nhealthier to walk than to stay did you\nrecognize any of these situations are\nyou noticing something in yourself or\nothers please discuss and comment we'd\nlove to hear from you as always thanks\nfor watching and we'll see you next time"
