your\ndepression or have left you to fight it\nalone\nnumber one your parents don't let you\nget professional help\ncoming to terms with your depression and\nrealizing that you are in such a dark\nplace takes a lot of strength and\ncourage\nwhat takes even more bravery is\nadmitting that you need help\nhave you ever talked to your parents\nabout seeing a therapist or a counselor\nbut they completely shut down the idea\nthey may not even listen to you or say\nyou don't need it because you're fine\nit can feel depleting and discouraging\nwhen your parents deny you of something\nthat you know can make your life better\nyou may begin to feel out of place and\nlike you don't belong in your own home\nsince they don't understand what you\nneed\nit can also be dangerous because you're\nnow left with untreated depression so\ndown the road it's more likely to spiral\ninto something more severe that can\nimpact more of your life\nnumber two they start to make jokes\nabout your depression and manipulate\nyour situation your parents might have\ntold you before to open up and not be\nafraid to talk about your struggles when\nyou do though you might find that your\nparents use your depression and problems\nas a spectacle for entertainment a\nsource of laughter instead of taking it\nseriously they might unfairly bring it\nup in social situations in a humorous\nway to humiliate you and make you feel\nsingled out\nthey might laugh and make a mockery of\nyour depression with others\nthis shows your parents your situation\nis a source of fresh gossip and news to\nIntrigue their peers meaning they don't\nreally take your depression seriously\nthey're using your real struggles as a\nway to direct attention onto themselves\nsomehow making it about them and leaving\nyou to feel isolated and even more\nunsupported\nnumber three your parents don't make\nchanges in day-to-day life to support\nyou with your depression do you live in\na family that is constantly go go go\nwhether it's different functions you all\nattend or extracurriculars do you find\nthat your family never stops moving\nwhen you have depression it's important\nto take a step back and slow down so you\nhave time to heal\nand as a teenager it's important to\ncommunicate this to your parents so they\ncan help relax your schedule that way\nthey have more time to have meaningful\nconversation with you and see what you\nneed that being said they might not\nunderstand the fact that you do need\nthis break and instead continue to go\nabout their daily lives they may\ncontinue to drag and force you into\nthese extra activities and are\ninflexible when all you really need is a\nbreak\nwhen you're depressed You're vulnerable\nand this exhausting strenuous routine\ncan leave you feeling even more depleted\nand unfulfilled\ntaking breaks from your busy life is\nimportant so your body can reset and\nrestore itself\nwhen your parents aren't mindful of this\nyour busy life can continue to weigh on\nyour shoulders and leave you feeling\neven more depressed\nnumber four they make excuses for your\ndepression\nhave you ever actually reached out to\nyour parents about your situation only\nto be met with unrealistic theories as\nto why you have depression in the first\nplace\nit might seem like they're almost in\ndenial making up different excuses as to\nwhy you're feeling a certain way they\nmight say things like no you don't have\ndepression you'll feel fine in the\nmorning or more commonly your phone is\nmaking you sad so put it away and you'll\nbe happy\nyou also might be stressing about school\nand they'll say we all have our\nstruggles\nthese are all comments parents make when\nthey don't understand depression and\ndon't care to further learn what you're\ngoing through\nthey think that your struggles are just\nan act of drama and attention seeking or\na strange teenage phase instead of an\nactual Cry for Help we know that\ndepression is not only directly caused\nby being on your phone and can be a\nproduct of other factors like trauma\nchemical imbalances conflict stress\nneglect and more\nsome parents refuse to open their eyes\nand look at the bigger picture of their\nchild's struggle and instead stay\nconstricted in the box they've spilled\naround them\nnumber five every time your depression\nis mentioned they argue with you\nliving with depression is exhausting and\ntakes a lot of strength to overcome so\nit's even more debilitating when there\nis added stress from conflict with your\nparents\nwhen you bring up your depression to\nyour parents does the conversation\nsomehow blow up into a massive argument\nand it's now somehow about them they\nmight even get offended that you brought\nup such a thing saying that you're\nungrateful for feeling such a way when\nthey've given you a great life they take\nthe fact that you're feeling depressed\nas a personal attack against their\nparenting skills and argue with you\nabout it\neven when you're dealing with the\neffects of your depression like fatigue\nlack of motivation and headaches they\nmight miss and not understand the fact\nthat these are signs of depression and\nsettle for the conclusion that you're\nlazy and bratty this ignorance of your\nsituation can spur anger in you and then\nescalate into an argument with your\nparents and their lack of understanding\ncan fuel your depression and further\nwear you down\nsome parents may think depression is a\nchoice and that the symptoms are a\nnormal part of a teen's development for\nexample they think a moody teenager is\njust a part of their growth due to this\nparents May minimize concerning symptoms\ndue to lack of knowledge\nsometimes parents are quick to assume\nteenagers do not have adult problems\ntherefore they think there are no valid\nreasons for teens to be depressed they\nmay be in denial because their image of\na healthy child is being shattered\nignoring their child's depression\nbecause of feelings that they have\nfailed as a parent it's also possible\nthat parents may be struggling with\ntheir own mental health problems\nthemselves and can't take on their\nchild's depression have you been\nnoticing any of these signs with your\nparents do you think they struggle to\nunderstand your depression and instead\nfuel it and make it worse if they do try\nto reach out to another trusted adult or\nfriend like a school counselor to get\nthe support you deserve"
