    "transcript": "nobody is perfect and that is a\nstatement everyone will quickly\nacknowledge as fact yeah when we\npractice it we don't tend to accept it\nat least not for ourselves it's funny\nhow it works we can forgive someone for\nbeing late for being rude for being\nself-centered for not replying to your\ntext messages for ignoring you we can\nforgive all of that but why is it when\nit's towards ourselves we are harsh we\ncriticize ourselves we judge ourselves\nwe look down at ourselves we talk down\nat ourselves why is that because the\ntruth is if nobody's perfect we're also\nnot perfect and that's completely okay\nbecause we're only human and flaws\nactually make us unique so I want you\nguys to remember we are all perfectly\nimperfect in our own ways and that is\nwhat makes us special"
