    "transcript": "is it hard for you to brush off other\npeople's comments about you sometimes\nyou may find yourself letting other\npeople's opinions and thoughts of you\ndictate the way you live whether it's\ndone in fear of being disapproved of or\nto impress or satisfy the expectations\nplaced on you this constant worry over\nwhat others think can place a huge\nweight on your shoulders so if this is\nsomething you worry about here are seven\nways to stop caring about what others\nthink\nnumber one showing gratitude for\nyourself and your accomplishments have\nyou taken a moment recently to look at\nhow far you've come it's all too easy to\nget caught up in trying to impress those\naround you with the best grades skills\nand financial income maybe you feel as\nthough you aren't earning enough money\nor accomplishing enough or worry that\nothers may look at you with shame scorn\nor even pity according to a study posted\nin the Journal of Happiness states that\nshowing gratitude not only to those\naround you but to yourself is an\neffective way of enhancing your mental\nwell-being think about all of the things\nthat you've done in the past couple of\nyears chances are you're not in the\nexact same place that you were and that\nyou've had to overcome some of your own\npersonal challenges and difficulties to\nget where you are today\nbe your own cheerleader and look inward\nto find validation and pride in what you\ndo and who you are number two alone time\nis okay unplug and step away how often\ndo you use social media\nthorough review of multiple research\npapers over the years has come to the\nconclusion that usage of social media\nmay help those who don't have much\ncontact with others feel more connected\nhowever for others correlations can be\nspotted for the opposite as well using\nsocial media when you're going through\ntough times may be making it harder for\nyou to shake off the way you feel as it\nmay be constantly reminding you of how\nyou stand compared to others it's no\ndoubt that when we connect with other\npeople we can let their opinions\nsuccesses mindsets and actions overpower\nhours so it may be helpful to take some\ntime alone and get away from the\ninternet and social media from time to\ntime number three we are all human\nnobody is Superman\ndo you compare yourself to others or\nbelittle your achievements in the face\nof somebody else this is such a common\noccurrence that just about everybody on\nEarth has done it however when you put\nothers on a pedestal you may end up\ndeluding yourself from the person they\nreally are you might even look up to\nyour Heroes so much that you end up\nfeeling insignificant in comparison\nthis can be especially true when your\nhero is somebody you know like a parent\nboss or a very smart friend but it helps\nto remember that even if they seem to be\nperfect they make mistakes too\nthere is no magic gift that only a\nhandful of people get when they're born\nand everyone can mess up from time to\ntime remember that this person is a\nbreathing living human being that has\nmade and still makes mistakes even if\nyou may not see them\nnumber four\nkeeping the focus on what you want\nare you doing the things you want to do\nevery person has different perceptions\ndesires hobbies and passions that they\nlove because of this you may find\nyourself caring about what other people\ntell you that you should want others may\ntry to reframe your wants or desires to\nfit their thoughts and feelings without\nfully thinking about yours so try to be\nselective of the things you care about\nif you spend all your time dealing with\neveryone's issues you're going to worry\nabout things that you aren't passionate\nabout or things that make you think why\nam I doing this or wait I don't like\ndoing this thing at all so to avoid\nfalling into these sinkholes spend less\ntime worrying about every small thing\nand try to repaint a picture of what you\ntruly want number five\nsculpt the person you are do you know\nwhy you feel the way you feel when\nsomeone else laughs at you or why do\ncertain words phrases or types of\npersonalities bother you and the way\nthat they do when you take the time to\nfocus on what everyone else wants you\nmay forget that there is a lot about\nyourself that you don't know\ndo you ever feel confused about your\nemotions\nthis can be a good indicator that you\nneed to learn more about yourself to\nfind out why you may feel nervous or\nscared of what others think of you\nknowing the source of this anxiety and\nworry may help you understand what it is\nyou're struggling with\nso you can work towards becoming better\nnumber six don't try to make everyone\nhappy you can't\nno matter who you are you can't make\neveryone happy personalities Clash\nopinions differ and everyone is\nconstantly changing not only how they\nview you but also themselves\nso while you may think that the whole\nworld is laughing and pointing at you\nwhen you've made a mistake\nthis is never the case people move on\nand forget this is why it's important to\nmake the distinction between how\nsomething makes you feel versus what\nactually happened striving to make\neveryone happy with your actions is\ntruly an impossible Act\none of which nobody in the world can\nachieve or has ever accomplished and\nnumber seven\nbuilding your self-esteem\nare you your own worst critic given that\nwe are responsible for making and\nlearning from our experiences we tend to\nput ourselves at the center of blame as\na result however when you only criticize\nyourself instead of trying to learn and\ncorrect your mistakes you run the risk\nof hurting and worsening your\nself-esteem having good self-esteem is\nimportant as it can help you assert your\nthoughts and needs and to be more\nrealistic when making decisions in turn\nit can help pry away that seemingly\ncompulsive need to check or analyze how\nand what other people think of you when\nyou're able to maintain a clear and\nwholesome image of yourself with all of\nyour strengths and talents you may find\nthat other people's perceptions and\nopinions of you will just roll right off\nyour back\nis this something you struggle with at\nsome point in another I think we all do\nlet us know in the comments below and if\nyou found this
