    "transcript": "empaths have frequently been depicted in\nthe media as a kind of real-life\nsuperhero their ability to feel what\nothers feel means they have a very high\nsocial tolerance and a strong drive to\nhelp or save people to top it off\ncompassion and affection actively flow\nfrom them which makes narcissists their\ncustomized Predators the narcissists\nvoracious need to feed is bottomless\nthey're custom made to trap and hold on\nto empaths draining them and never\ngiving them back\nthe empath believes they're providing\ncompassion like a safety blanket when in\nreality the narcissist is using that\nsame compassion as an anchor for their\nHooks dislodging and escaping those\nhooks requires shattering Illusions\nabout the narcissist and revealing the\nfaults inherent to the source of\nempathic behaviors so grab a glass of\nwater has some hard to swallow pills\naren't being served it doesn't taste\ngreat but they're good for you\nnumber one narcissists will never\nfulfill the covert contract here's the\nhard truth on some level we all do\nthings for some sort of self-benefit a\nholy person fasts to reach a higher\nplane of Consciousness giving to charity\nfeels good because we're helping others\nand empaths give goodness to get\ngoodness that's their covert contract\nnever heard of that well you wouldn't\nhave as being unspoken is the nature of\nthe covert contract it also fuels the\nhamster wheel of resentment the contract\nis an implicit expectation that giving\nemotionally earns a return of fulfilled\nemotional needs\nadmitting the expectation is a breach of\ncontract the empath perceiving\nthemselves selfish and effective so when\nthey don't get their meets net they ramp\nup the output assuming they haven't\nearned the return all the while silently\nfeeling hurt worthless and resentful\nunspoken expectation is frustrating for\nanyone with a narcissist it's a disaster\nto provide any return you have to care\nabout the other person and narcissists\ndon't they see others as mere feeding\ntrials and if a regular person is a\nsnack an empath is a catered\nall-you-can-eat buffet to leave the\nwheel the empath might need to admit\ntheir underlying beliefs face themselves\nlearn that they are absolutely in their\nright to enforce their boundaries and\nask for what they need whilst stating it\nkindly and respectfully of course number\ntwo you can't save someone who doesn't\nwant it empaths want to help improve and\nsave people they think\nI could really help them if I which can\nwork to an extent for many but not with\na narcissist to accept help means do you\nneed assistance assistance is needed\nbecause there's something that needs to\nchange changes are made because\nsomething could be better if it can be\nbetter that means it wasn't perfect\nbefore it follows that accepting help\nabout your behavior means accepting the\nidea that you could improve or change\nnarcissists by definition of their\nCondition Believe themselves and\nconstantly impress on others that they\nare idealized beings so they don't need\nhelp they don't need to fix what isn't\nbroken\nlacking empathy narcissists feel no\nissues in feeding off others for ego\nmaintenance they enjoy it if they\naccepted help they'd be double whammied\nthey'd have to stop feeding and they'd\nhave to admit they need some fixing the\nbitter pill is you can't help someone\nwho doesn't want to be helped they won't\nfix something they don't see is broken\nsolution\ntake a healthy swallow of water and\nrealize their delusion is not your\nproblem\nnumber three\nemotions can't replace your brain this\nis not simply a gut feeling gut feeling\nis often due to real evidence that is\nsubconsciously picked up but just isn't\nin clear detail empaths fall prey to\nemotional thinking emotional thinking is\nbased completely off feeling overriding\nlogic reason and anything else presented\neven if it's opposing hard tangible\nevidence\nthis is a risk when emotions are your\nsuperpower sometimes they go Rogue\nmaking the person turn away from the\nfacts an example is when someone feels\nthey're stupid despite achieving average\nor higher than average grades or even a\ndegree like any predator narcissists\nsniff out the opportunity knowing that\nempaths tend to choose emotion over\nevidence\nthey're set up as easy prey to fool and\ntrap The Narcissist simply overwhelms\nThe empath's Compassion trigger the\nempath who is completely unquestioning\nof their emotional thinking can\ndisregard any and all other abuses and\nsigns to help or care for the poor\nvictim any questioning and the\nnarcissist cranks the dial on the heart\nstring puller steering the empath away\nfrom outside wisdoms or truths\nto Break Free the empath needs to Value\ntheir mind and ask questions they have a\nright to know number four narcissists\nare disordered and morally bankrupt the\ndefinition of bankrupt is completely\nlacking in a particular quality or value\nthus being morally bankrupt narcissists\ncan't be trusted to do what most people\nwould do most people will have some\nlevel of predictability due to\nidentifying with how others feel for\nexample they won't lie to someone about\ntheir partner because it will hurt them\nor wreck their relationship\nnarcissists since they lack empathy\ntheir emotions are centered around\nthemselves they feel Superior and\nself-entitled to favorable treatment how\nthey choose to act depends only on\npersonal gain meaning they will lie to\nsomeone about their partner if it breaks\nthem up giving the narcissist a fresh\nego feeding supply unpredictability is\ncliffhanger-like and it gets worse when\nthey feel their supply pulling away or\nget getting low the empath gets clingier\nor more attentive trying to anticipate\nwhich way the narcissist will go thus\nthe narcissist gets more attention and\nhas reeled their supply back in\ncompassionate benefit of the doubt is\nemployed by the empath to disregard or\nhand wave questionable behaviors however\nthis needs to stop in order to confirm\nif they're being used questioning or\ncalling them out cuts off their supply\nthreatens the narcissist's idealized\nimage and forces them to look at their\nown insecurities\nthey would now view the empath as\nuseless maybe even dangerous they will\nleave them alone and by doing this the\nmanipulation stops number five\nit's all a fantasy it's not real\nthis is a two-fold fantasy on the first\nlevel the narcissists live in their own\nfantasy world of overblown\nself-importance where everything\nrevolves around their idealized selves\nthe second level is the empaths allowing\nthemselves to be fooled by the\nnarcissist's fantasy they are\nmanipulated into focusing on saving the\nnarcissist and believing They will\nreceive love in return\nneither which can nor will come true the\nwhole fantasy may be spun into a grand\ntragic Romance of soul mates seeking to\ncomplete each other\nwhen in truth it plays out more like a\nkarmic lesson of this is exactly\neverything love is not the empath has to\nin order to escape except this\ndisappointing truth and learn from it\nnumber six abuse means genuine love was\nnever a part of the picture\nlove does not involve abuse this isn't\nnegotiable abuse means this isn't an\naccident or a single bad day it's a\npattern of repeated purposeful conscious\ngarbage treatment over time this also\nmeans that the fake affection can be\nfrom any type of constant interaction\ndeemed a relationship\nit could be romantic familial or even\nthat co-worker who does you a solid if\nthere is a habitual pattern of abusive\nor denigrating Behavior they are devoid\nof emotional empathy the bitter pill\nhere\nit's one many of us non-narcissists have\na hard time with empath or not the truth\nis that no matter how nice The\nNarcissist was at the beginning of the\nrelationship or even after a fight they\nnever loved their partner\nthis is so emotionally psychologically\nunbelievable\nthe empath is grasping at shreds of\nReason saying that surely some of it was\nreal or it was real before something\nwent wrong\nhard fact is\nnarcissism isn't a part-time deal the\nwhole thing was a purposefully built\nillusion every single thing they did or\nsaid was with the cold singular purpose\nof keeping the ego meal Train Running\ngetting past this and out of the\nnarcissist clutches means accepting that\ntime lost can't be retrieved or\nretconned into something true\nthey need to Value their future\nstop letting it be drained and Wasted by\nThe Narcissist their best option is to\ncut off the supply and walk\nwe understand that if you're an empath\nbeing in a similar situation or are\ncurrently in one those six truths\nprobably felt like dry swallowing horse\npills like taking bitter medicine or\nwaxing though the results of partaking\nhave long-term beneficial effects\nthey're also necessary truths to truly\naccept in order to get out of the\nnarcissist's tar pit did you resonate\nwith or recognize any of these points\nlend and share your insights in the\ncomments we've thrown our rope of Hope\nand if it helps you or others maybe\nyou'll swing on to the next video\nthanks for watching"
