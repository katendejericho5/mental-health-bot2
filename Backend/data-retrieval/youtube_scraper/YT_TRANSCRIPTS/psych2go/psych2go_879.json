    "transcript": "easy to read someone's body language\nespecially if you're unsure or not\nexpressive\nexperts agree that communication is 80\npercent of our body language and not\nwhat we say\nbody language is a way in which we can\nget an understanding of how someone\ntruly feels so how can you read\nsomeone's body language more efficiently\nlet's explore that here are six ways to\nread someone's body language number one\nrecognize their normal behavior and\npersonality first\nyou can't read someone effectively if\nyou don't know how they normally ACT\nfirst\neach of us have our own unique\nmannerisms and behaviors that reflect\nour personality it's important to get a\nbaseline for how someone acts before\njumping to conclusions\nif you notice someone is nervously\ntapping their foot at your party does\nthat mean they have something to hide or\ndo they just not like parties or simply\nhave a habit of tapping their foot\nfocus on where their eyes go\nwhen in a discussion with someone pay a\nlittle attention to the direction their\neyes are lingering\nare they focused on you are they\nobserving the room are they looking at\ntheir feet if someone is giving you\ntheir full attention they're likely\ninterested in what you have to say if\nthey're staring you down though with a\nbit of a furrowed brow then they may be\na bit upset or trying to intimidate you\nof course when someone often drifts\ntheir gaze from your eyes they may be\ndistracted or hoping for the\nconversation to end and some people\nsimply don't like maintaining eye\ncontact for too long so this is why it's\nimportant to know someone's normal\nbefore you jump to too many strong\nconclusions how often does this person\nyou're talking to Blink if someone is\nrapidly blinking they may feel\nuncomfortable with the conversation\npupil size can be a key sign into\nwhether someone is interested in what\nyou have to say our emotions can cause\nour pupils to change in size when\nsomeone has very dilated eyes that may\nshow that they're highly interested in\nwhat you have to say or even attracted\nto you just pay attention to the\nlighting of the room before you jump to\nconclusions their pupils could be\ndilated simply due to a dimly lit room\nnotice their posture how someone holds\nthemselves can reveal a lot about them\nmaybe they hold their head high because\nthey've had a good day or maybe they're\nslumping in their seat because they\ndidn't quite get a full night's sleep\nnotice if someone holds their head high\nin a manner of confidence or maybe they\nhave a strong ego and puff out their\nchest\nJudith orloff MD notes that walking in\nan indecisive manner with your head low\nand coward could be a sign of low\nself-esteem in some cases posture can\nreveal much on how someone is feeling\nfor the day too so keep an eye out if\nthey're falling asleep in their chair\nduring class safe to say they're sleepy\nwhat are their lips doing another way to\nget a read on someone is to be aware of\ntheir lips and what they're doing when\nthey aren't the ones talking\nthey're biting their lip or chewing\ntheir bottom lip they could be nervous\nor worried if someone's mouth is parted\nfaintly then they're likely comfortable\nand relaxed a sign of fear can be when\none's lips quiver this could also be a\nsign that they're feeling sad compressed\nlips could mean they're a bit uneasy\nwith the situation her lips could also\nmean they've disapprove of what's going\non around them or that they don't trust\nyou biting their own lips could also\nmean that they're flirting with you\npay attention to what they're wearing\naccording to personality psychologists\nat the University of Texas Sam Gosling\nwe should notice what people choose to\ntell us about their appearance cause and\ncalls these signs identity claims and\nthey can include little things like what\nwe wear tattoos bumper stickers to even\nour screensaver Gosling explains that\nidentity claims are deliberate\nstatements we make about our attitudes\ngoals values Etc these are deliberate\nchoices so pay attention to what people\nwant to convey about themselves\nlook out for a particular facial\nexpressions there are a few common\nfacial expressions that can give way to\nwhat someone is really thinking or\nfeeling when someone's jaw is clenched\nand they grind their teeth that can be a\nsign of tension someone may feel bitter\nangry or contempt if their lips are\npursed deep frown lines forming and you\ncan bet they're worried or overthinking\nwant to know if someone is genuinely\nsmiling and Delight look for what is\ncalled the duchenne smile according to\nHealthline this occurs when the\nzygomaticus major muscle lifts the\ncorners of your mouth at the same time\nthe orbicularis oculi muscles lift your\ncheeks and crinkle your eyes at the\ncorners basically it's the type of smile\nthat reaches up to your eyes causing\nthose wrinkles by your eyes known as\ncrow's feet to appear this type of smile\nappears when someone is genuinely happy\nas opposed to a polite and kind smile or\neven a forced smile and there could be\nan easier way to interpret different\nSmiles Cardiff University's Magdalena\nrychlowska and her colleagues of\nresearchers developed a classification\nof smiles and their effect on others\nwith the help of a complex modeling\nprogram used in 2017. when you're giving\npositive feedback you can often show\nwhat rychlowska calls the reward smile\nthis is when your lips are naturally\npulled directly upwards your eyebrows\nlift and you form small Dimples at the\nsides of your mouth the dominant smile\nis used when one communicates friendship\nand liking this includes pressing your\nlips together along with an appearance\nof small dimples if you happen to notice\nsomeone you've been recently talking to\nusing the dominant smile they may just\nbe trying to tell you that they want to\nbe your friend if you watched all the\nway hopefully this was a good 101 body\nlanguage crash course for you we also\nhave a video here on sign someone is\nhighly attracted to you feel free to\ncheck it out\nforeign"
