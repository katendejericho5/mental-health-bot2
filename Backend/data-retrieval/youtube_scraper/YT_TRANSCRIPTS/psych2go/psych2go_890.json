    "transcript": "hey stick to goers welcome back to\nanother brand new video\nstanding on the counter in your bathroom\nyou eagerly take your well-lit selfie 30\nminutes of scrolling through filters\nlater you post it to social media\nbut then as you wait for the likes to\nstart rolling in have you ever wondered\nwhat does this say about me\nwhat do any of my posts say about me\nbelieve it or not our social media\nhabits can reveal a lot about us\none research study published in the\npersonality and social psychology\nbulletin looked at four studies that\nexamined the interface between how\nindividuals network their friendships\nand their attachment styles\ntheir findings our social network\nbehavior is closely connected to our\nattachment style\nconsidering our attachment style can\ninfluence how we pick our partners how\nwe develop friendships and how we end\nthem\nit's best to look at our social media\nhabits now all in an effort to see what\nit says about our attachment style and\nmore importantly what it says about us\nnumber one posting darker photos npr's\nangus chen once reported that your\nsocial media photos could suggest\nwhether or not you're depressed harvard\nresearchers andrew g reese and\nchristopher m danforth wanted to test\nthis theory\nresearchers created a computer script\nthat would examine individuals instagram\nposts the computer script accurately\nassessed whether individuals were\ndepressed they discovered that photos\nposted by depressed individuals were\nmore likely to be bluer grayer and\ndarker they also found humans aren't the\nbest predictors of depression when it\ncomes to assessing whether a photo is\nhappy or sad human ratings of photos\nwere found to be weaker predictors of\ndepression and were uncorrelated with\ncomputationally generated features\nnumber two deleting photos without likes\ndo you post on social media often\ndo you obsessively monitor the number of\nlikes of your posts\nespecially her selfies based on a study\nby penn state university your behavior\non social networks like instagram and\nfacebook can tell us how old you are\na common behavior that teenagers engage\nin on instagram is deleting photos that\ndon't get enough likes\ndong won li an associate professor of\nthe college of information sciences and\ntechnology at penn state university says\nteens want to be very popular so they're\nvery conscious of the likes they're\ngetting according to the studies it was\nalso shown that adults generally post\nphotos with\ndiversified topics in mind while most\nteens post photos that reflect their\ncurrent mood\nnumber three over filtering or enhancing\nselfies\nposting that highly edited photo of\nyourself may not only make others\nbelieve that's how you truly look but\nyour self-image of yourself may change\ndrastically as well a study from\nresearchers at australia's latrobe\nuniversity found that people who share\nselfies more often were reported to have\nsignificantly higher over-evaluation of\nshape and weight body dissatisfaction\ndietary restraint and internalization of\nthe thin ideal\nnumber four\nnot using filters on your photos okay\nlet's say you don't use filters in your\nposts what does this say about you\nin the same study by harvard researchers\nrhys and danforth they found those who\nare depressed are less likely to filter\ntheir photos it sort of makes sense\nbecause filters usually brighten up and\nenhance the contrast of the overall\nphoto which might not reflect the\nemotional state of the depressed\nindividual\nnumber five harsh comments and gossip\nyou may think throwing out a single\nnegative comment or two on a post won't\nmatter i mean will your followers really\nsee it or what about that recent post\nwhere you spread a bit of gossip a lot\nof people find negative comments and\ngossip as signs you're secretly an angry\nperson it shows that you're happy to\nspread hate about someone online for the\nworld to see\nforever\nwhy spread hate after all\nnumber six\nselfie after selfie\napparently according to research\npsychopaths tend to post selfie after\nselfie say what\nit might just be so\nresearchers from ohio state university\nfound that people who posted many\nenhanced selfies one after another held\na higher score on measures of narcissism\nand psychopathy\nobviously not all who post that many\nselfies are psychopaths but it could\nalso be an indication that you could\nhave a higher than average level of\nantisocial traits not only that\naccording to psychologist sarah schweitz\npsydee\nif you're posting these only me photos\non social media you might give people\nthe impression that you're full of\nyourself 7. you notice your online\nfriendships are disappearing\nso you can't help but notice your social\nnetworks are disappearing in front of\nyou you're losing followers you're not\ngetting as many likes\nwell one reason your followers are\ndwindling down according to researchers\nmaybe due to attachment to anxiety\nresearchers hypothesized that those with\nattachment anxiety may often give off an\noverwhelming intrusive or demanding vibe\nin their posts\nyeah that's right i said vibe the sad\nthing is those who worry about losing\ntheir connections and friends are more\nlikely to slowly start to lose a large\nnumber of their networks according to\nresearchers\nsome may show they want to control a\ncertain field or hang around their\nfriends more in response some people may\nfeel intimidated by these needs and pull\naway without realizing it\nresearchers say those with this anxiety\noften end up driving away the friends\nthey wanted to make and keep so\ndesperately\n8.\nfollowing strangers on social media\none study from researchers at pace\nuniversity found that following\nstrangers may not always have a positive\neffect\nthe researchers state that more frequent\ninstagram use has negative associations\nfor people who follow more strangers but\npositive associations for people who\nfollow fewer strangers with social\ncomparison and depressive symptoms\nnumber nine posting workout photos\nyou should feel great about improving\nyour health and working out at the gym\nexercising often is great in\nstrengthening your muscles increasing\nstamina and improving your overall\nphysical health but one study found that\nsharing inspiring images of your workout\nbody may have a negative effect the\nstudy found that people who posted\nfitspiration or fitspo photos scored\nsignificantly higher on the drive for\nthinness bulimia the drive for\nmascularity\nand compulsive exercise they also found\nthat a fifth of the subjects were at\nrisk for being diagnosed with a clinical\neating disorder\nas compared to 4.3 percent of the\nsubject group that opted out of posting\nworkout photos and 10.\nlack of interaction\nhave you ever heard of instagram\nbroadcasting it's a behavior that's been\nlinked to higher levels of loneliness\naccording to chia chen yang of the\nuniversity of memphis this behavior is\nmarked by uploading photos without\ntagging someone or often posting photos\nor updates that are not directed to\npeople in your life interacting and\nsocializing with others on social media\nis correlated with being less lonely but\nif you're not socializing with others on\nsocial media often you may feel a bit\nmore lonely in the long run\nas long as you don't get attachment\nanxiety feel free to get out there and\nstart commenting and
