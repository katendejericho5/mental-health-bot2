    "transcript": "hey psych2goers are you in a complicated\nsituation with your crush right now\nsometimes we are too blind to see that\nthe other person doesn't like us in the\nsame way we do them the person may be\nblunt and tell you directly which in\nthat case is a small Mercy however\nsometimes it may be difficult to gauge\nwhether your feelings are mutual so here\nare five signs that they are not\ninterested in a relationship number one\nyour crush doesn't make an effort\nestablishing a relationship means that\nboth parties need to put in the effort\nyou need to communicate figure out each\nother's interests and hobbies and spend\ntime with each other in the early stages\na romantic relationship May begin as a\nfriendship however the relationship\nchanges when both people pay more\nattention to the small things about each\nother interest in each other starts with\nsimple questions such as will they like\nthis this question unravels a slew of\nquestions which all point to one fact\nyou want to know more about them because\nyou've developed feelings Keen attention\nto small and insignificant details means\nthat you care about someone's well-being\ncomfort and opinion if your crush does\nnot make an effort to know more about\nyou and spend more time with you then\nthey're likely not interested number two\nthey talk about their love life\nthis sign is difficult to gauge because\nit all depends on the tone if you're\ninterested in someone you probably will\nnot talk about your love life with them\nof course that doesn't apply to everyone\nhowever if your crush approaches you and\nwants to treat you as a wingman or wing\nwoman there's a slim chance that they're\ninterested in you romantically number\nthree they keep you at an arm's length\nwhen people fall in love they tend to\nreveal secrets that they don't tell\nothers they seek to establish emotional\nintimacy and welcome the other person\ninto their inner world\nhowever someone who is not interested\nwill not do that they may tell you\nthings but they don't welcome you into\ntheir private emotional life number four\nthey flake out on plans another sign\nthat someone is not interested in a\nromantic relationship is flaking out on\nplans flaking out also refers to lacking\ncommitment when someone is in love or at\nleast interested they'll try to spend as\nmuch time as they can near the person\nthey like hence if your crush abruptly\ncancels plans consistently shows up late\nand actively avoids making plans with\nyou then they may not be interested and\nnumber five they flirt with other people\nthis is an obvious sign that they're not\ninterested some people may think that\nthe other person is playing hard to get\nand that could be the case people play\nhard to get to see if others are\ninterested but why would you chase after\nsomeone who lures you in to play around\nwith your feelings if it's obvious\nyou're interested if your crush is\nconstantly elusive then they might not\nlike you the same way did you relate to\nany of these signs figuring out whether\nsomeone is interested in you is\ndifficult if you are in an early phase\nof a relationship and are not sure if\nthe other person is interested notice\nthe way they act communication is also\nkey it's difficult to talk about\nsubjects like this but it can help both\nof you avoid heartbreak down the line"
