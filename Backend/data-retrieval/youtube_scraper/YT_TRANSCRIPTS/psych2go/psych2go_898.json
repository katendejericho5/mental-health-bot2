    "transcript": "If today was the last day of your life\ndo you think you'd have any regrets\nbefore you died no matter how wise\nsuccessful or accomplished you might be\nchances are you probably answered yes\nit's an inevitable part of life to fail\nand fall short at times\nand with those mistakes comes the desire\nto turn back time and do things\ndifferently the second time around\nfortunately for us however we don't\nalways have to make the mistakes to\nlearn the lesson we can always turn to\nolder Generations who have come before\nus and reflect on what their personal\nexperiences have taught them here are\nthe nine most common regrets people tend\nto have as they look back on their lives\nnumber one caring too much what other\npeople think\nperhaps the biggest reason why so many\nof us find ourselves unhappy and\nunsatisfied with our lives is that we\nspend so much of it caring about what\nother people think only to realize at\nthe end of the day that it doesn't even\nmatter because no matter how hard you\ntry you can never please everyone\njust do whatever you think is right for\nyou live for yourself not others it's\nyour life after all not anyone else's\nnumber two not following their passion\nin life one of the most baffling things\nabout human nature is that the more we\nwant something the more afraid we become\nof trying to go after it there are\nalways going to be a lot of reasons why\nwe stop ourselves from following our\npassions in life maybe it's too much\nwork it's too risky or it'll take too\nlong\nbut you're always going to regret\nletting that fear of failure win and\nsacrificing your dreams just because\nit's easier to settle for less to settle\nfor something more stable practical and\ncomfortable\nnumber three working too much another\ncommon regret people tend to have as\nthey get older is working too much and\nnot spending more time on the things\nthat really matter whether it's a hobby\nyou love seeing more of the world or\nspending time with friends and family\nall these things can add so much more\nrichness and meaning to our lives than\njust another day of slaving away jobs to\nmake a few more bucks number four not\nsaying how they truly feel\never like someone but never made a move\nonly to later found out they actually\nfelt the same way\nor stayed in an unhappy relationship or\na fake friendship just because you were\ntoo afraid to tell the truth about how\nyou really felt\neven our true feelings to ourselves no\nmatter how well our intentions might be\ncan cause heartbreak later down the line\nbecause of all the what-if scenarios we\nstart to make up in our minds\nnumber five\nnot standing up for themselves more\nwhile it might seem like the better\nchoice is to just keep our hurt feelings\nto ourselves instead of starting up some\ntrouble over time this can turn into a\nhabit of letting people walk all over\nyou so don't let your desire to be liked\nor your fear of Confrontation outweigh\nyour need for self-respect number six\nnot believing in themselves enough\nnot believing in yourself enough can\nlead to a lot of missed opportunities in\nthe future it can make you say no when\nyou really should have said yes\nit can keep you from really pushing\nyourself and discovering your true\npotential and it can keep a lot of doors\nclosed\ntake the chance life is too short to\ndoubt yourself\nnumber seven not taking better care of\nyourself\nwhen we're still young and healthy it's\neasy to sacrifice our health and\nprioritize other things more whether\nit's work money or fun we sometimes\nneglect our diet sleep and exercise but\nthe more we fail to take care of\nourselves and our well-being the more\nhealth problems and complications we\nwill most likely face in the future\nnumber eight not taking more risks\nthe truth is it's only human for us to\nwant to stay in our comfort zones and\nprefer what's safe and predictable over\nsomething new and uncertain\nbut no one ever accomplished anything\ngreat just by treading the water\nso try to be open to taking more risks\nputting yourself out there and living a\nlife filled with more Adventure\nand number nine\nnot living in the moment more\nwhen you're always busy and in a hurry\nconstantly chasing deadlines and setting\nnew goals for yourself it can be easy to\nlose sight of just how precious and\nshort-lived our time on this Earth\nreally is as the famous movie quote from\nFerris Bueller's Day Off goes life moves\npretty fast if you don't stop and take a\nlook every once in a while you might\nmiss it so don't get so caught up\nplanning your future or reminiscing\nabout the past that you forget to live\nright here in the moment\nso do you relate to any of the things we\nmentioned here there are always going to\nbe lessons we wish we'd learned sooner\nor things in our lives our choices or\nourselves that we could change\nbut as the ever so inspiring Maya\nAngelou quotes\nstop thinking in terms of if only I knew\nbetter you didn't know then what you\nknow now all we can do is our best then\nwhen we know better we do better\ndid you find this video valuable tell
