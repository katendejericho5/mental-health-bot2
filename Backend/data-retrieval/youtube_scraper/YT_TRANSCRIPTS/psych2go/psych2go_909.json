    "transcript": "Chinese philosopher latsu once said\nordinary men hate solitude but the\nmaster makes use of it embracing his\naloneness and realizing he is one with\nthe whole universe\nbut of course while many of us\nunderstand that loneliness is sometimes\nnecessary for us to come back to\nourselves reflect and grow\ndoesn't make the Journey of getting\nthere any less scary painful and\nconfusing psychology defines loneliness\nas a distressing feeling that\naccompanies the perception that one's\nsocio-emotional needs are not being met\nby the quality of one's inter and\nintrapersonal relationships numerous\nstudies show that chronic loneliness can\nhave a number of detrimental effects on\nour mental health life satisfaction and\noverall well-being\nfortunately recognizing loneliness is\nthe first step towards overcoming these\nfeelings and moving forward to a more\nfulfilling life\nwith that said here are seven of the\nmost easily overlooked signs that you're\nfeeling extremely lonely even if it\ndoesn't seem like it\nnumber one materialism\ndo you find yourself wanting more\nmaterial possessions lately have you\nstarted to feel that having certain\nstatus symbols in your life such as a\nnew car a bigger house or a higher\nfigure salary is the only way you can be\nhappy\nif so this newfound materialism you may\nbe feeling could be because of extreme\nloneliness in fact it's actually very\ncommon for materialism and loneliness to\ncompound and exacerbate one another\nsimply put the lonelier you are the more\nmaterialistic you tend to be and vice\nversa number two\nsocial media addiction\ndo you spend hours and hours on end just\nmindlessly scrolling through your feed\neven though it doesn't make you feel\nbetter well that's because too much\nsocial media exposure has actually been\nproven to increase feelings of\nloneliness isolation inadequacy and the\nend self-centeredness not only that\nsocial media has also become something\nof a crutch that people turn to whenever\nthey feel bored lonely or upset which\nstunts their emotional growth and keeps\nthem from developing healthy coping\nmechanisms and mental resilience number\nthree Envy\nanother often overlooked warning sign of\nextreme loneliness is strong feelings of\nEnvy towards others and their success\nwhy because jealousy is rooted in low\nself-esteem and a neurotic need for\nsocial acceptance we feel jealous of\nother people because we want what they\nhave\nso pay close attention to who you can't\nhelp but envy and why if it's someone\nwell liked with a lot of friends and\npopularity be it online or in real life\nyou might be feeling really lonely\nnumber four eating weight sleeping\nproblems from the outside looking in\nloneliness can seem a lot like\ndepression so it tends to mimic a lot of\nthe same symptoms too and since weight\ngain weight loss insomnia and\noversleeping are all common side effects\nof depression the same can be said for\nextreme loneliness\npeople who are extremely lonely might\nfind it hard to fall asleep at night\nbecause of it or they might do the\nopposite and you sleep as an escape from\ntheir problems they could gain weight\nbecause of too much comfort eating or\nlose it because loneliness is making\nthem neglect themselves and Skip meals\nnumber five constant boredom or\nrestlessness similar to the last Point\nfeeling extremely lonely but not even\nrealizing it can easily be mistaken for\nboredom and restlessness you find it\nhard to have fun or enjoy doing anything\nand spend your days aimlessly chasing\nwhatever random and momentary pleasure\nyou can find to distract you from an\naching emptiness inside that you don't\nunderstand\nthis feeling comes from a lack of\nEngagement challenge change and\nopportunities for self-growth in one's\nlife which could be caused by or is\ncausing you extreme loneliness number\nsix out of control emotions\nhow many times have you lost your temper\nor burst into tears these past few weeks\nare you feeling more emotionally\nvolatile and unstable lately but don't\nknow why\nbeing emotionally out of control is a\nvery Telltale sign that you are\nstruggling with your mental health and\nFeeling Extreme loneliness could be the\nreason why\nstudies say that when we are struggling\nwith loneliness it puts our brains in a\nconstant state of emotional distress\nthat impairs our ability to regulate our\nemotions\nand number seven inability to be alone\nwith yourself\nfinally but perhaps most importantly if\nyou find yourself unable to be alone\nwith yourself and with your own thoughts\nalways needing to be around other people\neven when you don't like them or don't\nenjoy spending time with them\nthen you're likely struggling with\nextreme loneliness because being\ncomfortable in your own company takes a\nlot of inner peace mental strength and\nself-acceptance\nafter all there's a reason why they say\nbeing alone isn't the same as being\nlonely so do you relate to any of the\nthings we've mentioned here\nhave you ever experienced any of these\nsubtle signs of extreme loneliness\nif you're struggling with your mental\nhealth in any way the best thing you can\ndo for yourself is to seek help reach\nout to a mental health care professional\ntoday and take the next step
