    "transcript": "in How I Met Your Mother Marshall is\ngoing to law school and is known for\ncompleting long research papers the\nnight before the deadline and getting an\nA on the paper too enter stage left the\nuptight\nprofessor she keeps giving Marshall\nlower grades so Marshall asks his pal\nBarney to get friendly with her okay yes\nthis is a TV show and this is a bit\nextreme to get a passing grade however\nthere's a reason the show did this we'll\ntalk about that later so stay tuned sex\ncan have a lot of crazy impacts on us\nwe've talked about the effects of sex on\nthe body so let's talk about the\nshocking effects of sex on your mental\nhealth number one life is good it might\nbe cliche but sex can just make you feel\ngood in 2009 two researchers from the\nUniversity of West Scotland did a study\nto see how one's satisfaction of Life\nchanged based on how often they were\nhaving sex they found that the two are\npositively correlated for both men and\nwomen the more they had sex the happier\nthey were with their sex life their\nrelationship life in general and their\nmental health this same pair of\nresearchers did a similar study in 2011\nto find out if satisfaction of life and\nmental health changed when they added\nvaginal orgasms to the picture it didn't\nchange squat the more sex and vaginal\norgasms the better your mental health\nand satisfaction of life is now this\nisn't to say to go have a bunch of exx\nto have positive impacts on your mental\nhealth we're simply acknowledging that\nhealthy and safe sexual relationship can\nhelp to strengthen your mental health\njust as exercise or practicing mindful\nwould number two negative act negative\neffect we are about to talk about\nchildhood sexual abuse and unal living\nif this is a topic you're avoiding feel\nfree to skip to the next point we can't\nignore the fact that sex isn't always a\npositive thing and it happens without\nconsent before we go further if this has\nhappened please reach out to a trusted\nAuthority or medical professional in 20\n8 Cambridge University released a study\nexamining the relationship between\nchildhood sexual abuse and the risk of\nmental health concerns as you might have\nguessed there is a higher risk for\nincreased Psychopathology levels some\nadults began abusing substance based on\nprevious abuse and some even ended their\nown lives abuse is no joke and it should\nnever be hidden if you are someone you\nknow is a victim please tell someone\ntiming matters have you ever watched a\nkids movie as an adult and caught a\nsuddenly placed in uendo Disney's famous\nfor him one of my personal favorites is\nfrom Toy Story while Woody is giving the\ntoys The Daily announcements he tells\nthem Andy's birthday party was moved to\nthat day Slinky starts helping Woody\ncalm the rest of the toys down and\nreassures them Andy won't get new toys\nand stop playing with them Mr Potato\nHead is over it all pops off his Mouse\nand starts tapping his rear with it as a\nkid that might have gone over your head\nas an adult you know Mr Potato Head is\nis throwing shade at Slinky calling him\na butt kisser this illustrates that what\nyou take away from something can depend\non what stage of life you're in the same\ngoes for sex a group of researchers led\nby Brian Soler acknowledged all prior\nresearch showing that having sex during\nadolescence can increase the risk for\nmental health issues in their youth and\nadded to it they took that data and\nadded authenticity as a factor in women\nif the sexual relationship is\ninauthentic adolescent sex can increase\nthe potential for mental health problems\nin men this additional Factor didn't\nalter impacts further it sucks and it\nalmost hurts to hear but some things are\nbetter to wait for a natural remedy\nremember Marshall and his Professor from\nearlier sure it's a TV show which is\nmeant to be dramaticized for comedic\npurposes but they weren't too off with\nthis one the University of Michigan did\na study in 2014 to see how stress levels\nchange in young women based on the\nfrequency of sex now there were\nparticipants in the study with mental\nillness and those without during the\nweeks they had sex the ladies with\ndiagnosed illnesses experienced a\nsignificantly decreased amount of stress\nit was a smaller change but even the\nparticipants without illnesses\nexperienced less stress you see being a\nlawyer who's quick on his feet Marshall\ncalculated Professor plus Barney plus\nsex minus stress equals Marshall passes\nthe class good job Marshall but maybe\nless manipulation tactics next time our\nour brains are so sensitive everything\nwe think say do eat or drink can impact\nit and this is why it's so important\nthat we learn as much about the brain\nand what affects it this way you can\nenjoy a positive healthy mental state\nlead into life do you know of any other\nimpacts that sex can take on your mental\nhealth let us know in the comments and\nthe next time you're stressed tell your\npartner you need some sexy time because\nscience said so until next time"
