it\nlet's go istp the virtuoso\nthe virtuoso is someone who is\noptimistic creative yet practical great\nat prioritizing and they're the person\nyou want in a major crisis\nbecause of their spontaneity they can\nget easily bored\nnot be one to commit to something and\nengage in risky behavior to spike their\ninterest\nthis can lead to a lot of unfinished\nthings or even failed relationships and\nfriendships\nif this sounds like you\ntry starting small is there a book a\nhobby or even a diy project that you've\nbeen wanting to complete\nschedule an hour every weekend where\nyou'll keep working on that thing\nwhatever it is until you finish it\nafter a few weeks try two hours or even\nlonger you can even practice making a\nsmall promise to a friend and following\nthrough this can help you practice\ncommitting isfp\nthe adventurer\nthe adventurer may sound like an indiana\njones copy but they're actually the\npassionate imaginative artistic person\nwho adventures in their mind\nthe problem with this is that an\nadventurer can be way too independent\nand become stressed\nthey can also become easily overwhelmed\nby their emotions\nif this is you try hanging out with one\nor two friends at once instead of a\ngroup\nif you're in a relationship maybe ask\nyour partner if they can help with the\nchores around the house or to take\ncharge of dinner one night\nif your emotions are your kryptonite try\njournaling if a really strong emotion\ncomes up grab your phone and type it out\nwhat do you feel why and what can you do\nabout it this

that they miss the big\npicture\ndoes this sound a bit like you\nif so it's cheesy but try to put\nyourself in the other person's shoes\nhow might the other person feel or what\nmight they think\nthis can help bring the entrepreneur\nback to remembering that everyone has\nfeelings\nesfp\nthe entertainer the entertainer is\nsomeone who defies tradition and opts\nfor more original things they love\naesthetics they love putting on a show\nliterally or figuratively and they have\nexcellent people skills unlike some of\nthe personalities we've mentioned\nalready the entertainer is actually\nreally emotional and can be more\nsensitive than others to conflict in a\nstudy centered around people-pleasing it\nwas discovered that the main reason for\nthis is self-preservation\nif i do what others want there can't be\nany conflict\nso how do you fix this one\nagain start small let's say you and a\nfriend go to starbucks for a quick\npick-me-up your friend says i'm getting\nan iced coffee you want the same the\ntypical entertainer response would be\nsure sounds good but not this time\npolitely let them know that their option\nsounds great but you've got your eye

which\nmakes them a bit uptight unable to relax\nand even unable to express emotions for\nthis it's very important the executive\nremembers that they can have their own\nmethods and beliefs\nbut that doesn't mean someone else's\nmethods or beliefs aren't valuable or\nequally correct\nnext time someone offers a suggestion on\nhow to do something instead of\nimmediately rejecting it try it out\nif you don't like it that's cool\nthank the person for showing you another\nway of doing something and move on\nthis can help you open up to new ideas\nand understand that agreement doesn't\nhave to be present for respect\nisfj the defender\nthe defender is another reliable\nobservant personality they're supportive\nenthusiastic and aren't afraid to get\ntheir hands dirty\nsince they're always so
