    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2goers.\nDo you have this strong,\nintuitive feeling that someone likes you,\nbut they never make a\nmove or flirt with you?\nPerhaps they're even a\nbit quiet around you too,\nbut you still sense something is going on.\nYour theory?\nThey have a crush on you,\nbut they're a bit shy.\nMany people can get extremely shy\nwhen they're around someone\nthey're attracted to.\nSo how can you tell if\nsomeone is shy around you,\nbut they like you?\nWell, here are six signs\nthey're interested in\nyou, but they're shy.\nNumber one,\nthey're very nervous; only around you.\nWho isn't nervous around their crush?\nSome people are great at hiding it\nwhile some start nervously sweating\nas soon as they interact with\nsomeone they really like.\nTheir stomach is full of butterflies\nand they can't seem to\nlook you fully in the eye,\nbut want to so badly.\nIf you notice your crash has clammy hands,\nis blushing or is exhibiting\nother nervous behavior,\nall while welcoming you with a smile,\nthen this could be a\nsign that they like you.\nThey're just a bit shy.\nNumber two, their friends\nhint that they like you\nand they joke with them about it.\nAre their friends often around them?\nDo you hear them crank up\nthe jokes and private giggles\nwhen they're suddenly around you?\nYou have a feeling they're\nwhispering about you.\nWhy?\nProbably because their friends\ntold you five seconds ago\nthat their friend thought\nyou were cute or sweet,\nor that they liked you.\nIf someone is shy and\nhasn't made the move,\nthey've likely told their\nfriends about the crush\nand in turn, their friends\nmay tease them about it,\neven in your presence.\nIf their throwing playful hints at you\nthat their dear friend has a crush on you,\nit's likely true,\nespecially if they exhibit\nmore of these signs.\nNumber three,\nthey're a bit awkward and\ntrip over their words,\nonly around you.\nAround their friends, they're\nchill and charismatic.\nAround strangers, calm and collected.\nBut around you, the awkward\nsilences are inevitable\nand they're tripping over their words\nas if they're running from\na stampede of emotions.\nYou notice they stammer\nor act a bit more awkward around you.\nIt could be that they really like you\nor are just pretty shy around\npeople they find attractive.\nNumber four, during conversations,\nyou have their full focus.\nWhen you're talking to them,\ndespite them tripping over\ntheir words, how are they?\nDo they give you their full\nfocus, attention undivided?\nAre they actively listening\nand giving you good eye contact\nor at least trying?\nHey, they're pretty nervous.\nWell, if you notice their attention\nis particularly with you,\nthen it's likely they wanna listen\nand get to know you better.\nThey're also giving the person they like\nthe respect they deserve.\nWho doesn't love a respectful\nand engaging conversation?\nIf they're a great listener only with you,\nthere's a good chance they\nlike you romantically.\nNumber five, they look at you from afar,\nthen turn away quickly in embarrassment.\nHave you caught them staring at you,\nonly to quickly turn away with a blush\nand look of embarrassment?\nThis is a common sign\nthat someone likes you.\nMaking good eye contact\nfrom afar to a stranger\ncan be a way of flirting with them\nbut people often do this\nunintentionally as well.\nIf they do it, it's likely\nthey wanna talk to you,\nbut are a bit shy and unsure\nof how to approach you.\nPerhaps if you like them\nback, you can approach them.\nAnd number six,\nthey don't turn down a\nchance to be around you\nand are very kind.\nWhen you do invite them out\nor suddenly have some time alone together,\nare they always there?\nDo they love to spend time with you?\nDo they treat you with\nkindness and respect too?\nIf someone often jumps at the\nchance to be alone with you\nand don't often turn down your invites,\nit's a sign they like you.\nThis could be friendly,\nbut if you notice they\nalso seize any opportunity\nto be by your side,\nit's likely they're interested\nin being more than just friends.\nOdds are if they have most of\nthese signs, they like you.\nThey really, really like you.\nThey're just a little shy.\nSo, do you think someone likes you?\nDo you think they're shy?\nFeel free to let us know\nin the comments down below.\nIf you enjoyed this video,\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share it with a\ntrue friend or a crush.\nDon't be shy.\nFeel free to share your\nfeelings about them too.\nHey, you never know.\nThis video could be a\ngood flirty icebreaker,\nunless you dread flirting.\nOh boy, sweaty palms, sweaty palms.\nSubscribe to Psych2go and hit\nthe notification bell icon\nfor more content like this\nand as always, thanks for watching."
