    "transcript": "you're not the same person i thought i\nknew you've changed\nlet's end this he hurled these painful\nwords to me one day the words were a\nweapon that ground me to dust the love\nof my three-year-long relationship was\nsuddenly nothing but ashes one short\nbreath could make it disappear\ni could hear my heart breaking my\nemotions were turning switching from\npleading for answers why can't he try\nharder to make our relationship work to\nthe anger of betrayal that jerk he\nshould be more understanding\ncrying used to be a healthy occasional\ncleansing release for me but now it had\nbecome an unwanted habit for me day by\nday i was imprisoned in the darkest\ncorner of my mind my daily routine\nconsisted of lying in bed the whole day\nfilled with endless mindless scrolling\nthrough social media\nevery time i would happen upon photos of\nmy friends with their significant others\ni'd find myself crying again\ni felt changed\ninstead of being happy for them like i\nwas before i felt envious i couldn't\nhelp but think maybe i did change\nmaybe it's true that it's my fault our\nrelationship ended\ni understood i needed help and sought\ntherapy which was good but it wasn't\nenough\nso i turned to my closest friends for\nsupport\nyes those same friends i found myself\nenvying\nthen came the wave of guilt i cleared\nall of my friends from my social media i\nremoved myself from my closest friends\nchat group the envy that built up inside\nof me made me feel unworthy of my\nfriend's love\ni felt i was a burden\none of them seemed to confirm this\nthought when she said you're not trying\nhard enough not to be depressed you're\njust draining the life out of our friend\ngroup just snap out of it\ni lashed out when she said that i even\nturned down each of my friends who\nreached out to me\ni was crushed by yet another wave of\nsadness\ni found myself being stuck in a vicious\nloop of sadness anger and guilt and\nfeeling unworthy of love\ni isolated myself from the world\neven though i was the one who turned\nthem away it felt like all my closest\nfriends distanced themselves from me i\nbegan to really believe that i was a\nburden that i had become the person who\nleeches from everyone for attention i\nfelt like i was some ego maniacal lost\ncause whom everyone had left because of\nthis awful change\nthen one day my therapist told me\nsomething that switched some sort of\nrelease in me they said the constant\nfact in life is change\nthis nudged me to think of my situation\nfrom a different perspective\nmaybe instead of this being an ending\nwith nowhere to go\nthis was a turning point in my life\nperhaps this lowest point is a stepping\nstone to change\na change for the better\ndepression puts you through a dark and\nlonely journey\nto those who have lost all their\nemotional support to those who are still\nbattling depression to those who feel\nlike life is meaningless\ni want you to know that you're not alone\nand you deserve to be loved and\ncherished you are not a burden you are\nnot a mistake\nyou are important"
