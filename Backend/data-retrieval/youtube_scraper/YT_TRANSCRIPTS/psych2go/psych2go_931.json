    "transcript": "- Do you struggle with relationships?\nIt's easy to get lost in life\nand in your relationships.\nIt comes and goes\nand there were probably\ntimes you wondered,\nwhat went wrong?\nThere are certain types of behavior\nthat damage your relationships\nand sometimes you don't even notice\nwhen you're doing them.\nSo today we're going to\nfind out what they are\nand how to prevent them.\nNumber one, refusing to say sorry.\nHow do you resolve fights\nor misunderstandings?\nDo you sometimes refuse to back down\neven if it's your own mistake?\nPracticing healthy communication\nis vital for relationships.\nThis includes the ability to admit\nthat you are the one at fault.\nThere is power in this act.\nIt shows that you are mature enough\nto look at your own shortcomings\nand capable of overcoming them\nto the best of your ability.\nBut why is it so difficult to say sorry?\nWell, saying sorry can\nlead to feelings of shame.\nThis can make you feel bad about yourself\nand rethink whether you're\na good person or not.\nIt helps to remember saying sorry\ndoesn't equate to you\nhaving a bad personality,\nsaying sorry just means\nthat you're willing\nto admit that you're wrong\nand you cherish the other person\nand will try to be better for them.\nNumber two, having low self-esteem.\nYou tend to be insecure\nabout your own self,\nskills or appearance.\nPeople who have low\nself-esteem try to diminish\nthese feelings by fully\nrelying on their relationships\nfor emotional or psychological stability.\nThis is called codependency\nand this can make a relationship go\nfrom healthy to toxic fast.\nBeing codependent can stem\nfrom abusive families,\nchildhood upbringing,\nor exposure to people with\nmental or physical illnesses.\nBut don't worry,\nthere's always room for growth.\nFor starters, you can try developing\nyour own self-care routines\nto encourage feelings of\nrelaxation and happiness.\nWhat makes you feel good?\nDo you like going to the spa?\nTaking long walks?\nDoing some exercise?\nIt's important to explore\nand identify the things you like doing\nso you can incorporate them\ninto your own schedule.\nSpend time with your supportive friends\nor even go to a therapist.\nSomeone will always be there\nto help you when you need it.\nNumber three, refusing to compromise.\nRelationships are about\ngetting close to someone else.\nBut being two different people,\nyou're bound to have some\ndisagreements along the way.\nAnd that's why we have\nthe magic of compromise.\nYou discuss your side of the story\nand get to a unified decision\nthat satisfies you both,\nleading to further growth as a team.\nBut do you feel like you're sacrificing\nmore than compromising?\nOr perhaps you feel like you're asking\ntoo much of someone already.\nThese types of situations\ncan cause negative feelings\nsuch as bitterness or\nresentment to develop.\nSo how do you prevent this?\nUnderstand that you, your friend, family,\nor partner are completely\ndifferent people,\nyou'll never be on the\nsame side all the time\nand that's okay.\nFind a new alternative\nthat works for you both\nand try to build an environment\nthat's both peaceful and yet\nopen to healthy arguments.\nCommunicate, and put yourself\nin their shoes as you listen.\nNumber four, always putting them first.\nWhen you love someone, you\nhave a natural inclination\nto shower them with affection.\nSometimes it comes at the expense\nof your own physical and mental health.\nYou go out of your way\nto make them feel happy.\nYou give them gifts,\ntell them compliments,\nand protect them whichever way you can.\nThat's all good, but are you also giving\nthe same treatment to\nyour own body and self?\nRemember that your\nrelationship with yourself\ncomes first before everything else.\nSo it needs some love and care as well.\nTry taking some time off for yourself.\nPursue your passions,\nhobbies, or even get new ones.\nKeeping your sense of independence alive\nis a way to stop depending on others\nfor your own emotional and\npsychological stability.\nOwn your life.\nYou matter.\nNumber five, always\nputting yourself first.\nThis is just the exact\nopposite of number four\nbut it needs to be said,\njust like how some people\nhave an inclination\nto always put themselves last,\nothers have the tendency to\nalways put themselves first.\nThis is not self love.\nSee self-love means nurturing yourself\nto become a better presence all around.\nYou give yourself time off,\ndistance yourself from toxic people,\nand grant yourself the\nchance to enjoy life.\nHowever, when you're doing\nwhatever you wanna do\nwithout considering\nother people's feelings,\nyou may come off as selfish.\nThis is why it helps to be\naware of your own actions.\nConsider how your actions are\naffecting your relationships.\nDid they seem to be hurt by what you said?\nAre some people putting\nsome distance away from you?\nKeep an eye out for\nany possible indicators\nand don't be afraid to face\nthem head on if you do.\nOpen up your feelings\nand admit your mistakes\nto those you feel you've wronged.\nIt's a sign of maturity\nand your loved ones\nwill certainly appreciate the effort.\nAnd number six, harboring grudges.\nAre you the type of person who\nlikes to hold onto a grudge?\nHolding a grudge is a defense mechanism.\nAnd some grudges last longer than others\ndepending on the cause.\nKeeping grudges may\ncage you in a whirlwind\nof negative emotions like anger,\nbitterness, resentment, and hopelessness.\nThere really aren't a\nlot of benefits to it,\nand can damage your relationships.\nWhen you're angry, give yourself some time\nto let this steam off.\nGo for a walk.\nDo some exercise and\ntry to get your mind off\nwhat is making you angry.\nAfter you've calmed down,\nreflect on what happened\nand try to build your way to a resolution.\nShould you talk it out with them?\nGive them space?\nWhatever it is, it's important\nto get to a conclusion\nwhich is what harboring\ngrudges doesn't do.\nPatience, understanding, and acceptance\nwill help you get through it.\nIt's certainly not easy,\nbut you're more than capable\nof being a better person.\nChoose forgiveness.\nHave you ever called it quits\nwith a friend or partner?\nWhy do you think it happened?\nPlease share your stories in\nthe comment section below.\nWe appreciate hearing your experiences\nwith different relationships.\nRemember, communication with yourself\nand the other person is essential.\nYou never stop growing as a person.\nWhat you experience now will\nbe a lesson for tomorrow.\nIf you found this video helpful, like,\nand share it with friends\nthat might find insight\nin this too.\nRemember to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the
