intense\nfeelings and getting attached to you\nthis can take the form of surface level\nconversations wherein they keep\ncommunication light and avoid any\ndiscussions of emotions past experiences\nor future aspirations further they can\nbe obs OB erve deflecting any\npotentially vulnerable talk and might\neven resort to humor or sarcasm as a\ndefense mechanism for the same they joke\nabout potential relationships as they\nstruggle with their feelings for you\nthey may find themselves joking about\npotential relationships with others this\nBehavior allows them to present a\nnonchalant front and divert attention\nfrom their true emotions they might try\nto distance themselves from the\npossibility of revealing their true\nfeelings for you by making light-hearted\nremarks or teasing about romantic\ninvolvement with other people this\nallows them to downplay their emotions\nand maintain a sense of emotional\nDetachment they use metaphorical\nlanguage the sad truth is crushes are\noften one-sided and are commonly kept\nhidden from the person they are directed\ntowards leading to difficulties in\ncommunication as a result it is not\nsurprising that individuals resort

appearance often show higher\nlevels of artistic creativity\nmasculinity and intelligence\nadditionally women were found to prefer\nmen who used more metaphorical\ncompliments when dating conclusively\nwoman's responses to such Behavior tends\nto fuel its occurrence as well as\nconfusion in understanding whether they\nactually like you or not they might\navoid direct contact you're surrounded\nby your group of friends having a\ndelightful conversation but there's that\none person even though you can see them\npay attention to every little detail you\nmention they rarely speak to you\ndirectly you might find them talking to\nthe group or someone else but just not\nyou from their perspective being\nstraightforward with someone whom they\nhave feelings for can be extremely\nintimidating this can even take the form\nof indirect playful teasing and\nlight-hearted mockery becoming their\nweapons of choice masking the depth of\ntheir\nemotions they put on a facade of\nconfidence in their attempt to conceal\ntheir feelings for you they might\nunintentionally adopt an overly\nconfident Persona as a shield against\nvulnerability in group settings you\nmight notice them boasting and bragging\nabout their accomplishments trying to\npaint themselves as irresistibly\ndesirable their voice might ring out and\nthey might enter a room radiating self\nassurance however
