    "transcript": "hey sector goers welcome back to our\nChannel\nour body language can reveal a lot about\nus more than we realize some people have\na keen intellect on body language\nthey're a Sherlock Holmes type and pick\nup on the little gestures and subtle\nmovements that can reveal our mood\nmotivation and desires some subtle\ngestures can be hints into whether\nsomeone is attracted to another how can\nyou recognize this subtle behavior and\nbecause\nwell recognizing the science is a good\nstart here are six body language signs\nthat may signal that someone is\nattracted to you number one clammy hands\ndo you get nervous around your crush\nwell if they like you too they may be\njust as anxious as you are stammering\nbreaking out in sweats and clammy hands\ncan be signs someone likes you so much\nyou make them nervous attraction can\neven make us a bit dumb sometimes\nresearch has found that sexual arousal\nshuts off parts of the prefrontal cortex\nof the brain this region of the brain is\nresponsible for critical thinking\nrational behavior and self-awareness\nnext time you're around them pay\nattention do they always break out in a\nsweat they can't speak as eloquently as\nthey usually do perhaps it's just that\nthey secretly have a crush on you number\ntwo look for a real duchenne smile have\nyou ever heard of the duchenne smile\nthere are a few common facial\nexpressions that can give way to what\nsomeone is really thinking or feeling\nEdition smile is one of them according\nto Healthline this occurs when the\nzygomaticus major muscle lifts the\ncorners of your mouth at the same time\nthe orbicularis oculi muscles lift your\ncheeks and crinkle your eyes at the\ncorners basically it's the type of smile\nthat reaches up to your eyes causing\nthose wrinkles by your eyes known as\ncrow's feet to appear this type of smile\nappears when someone is genuinely happy\nas opposed to a polite and kind smile or\neven a forced smile and there could be\nan easier way to interpret different\nSmiles Cardiff universities Magdalena\nright schlauska and her colleagues of\nresearchers developed a classification\nof smiles and their effects on others\nwith the help of a complex modeling\nprogram used in 2017 when you're giving\npositive feedback you can often show\nwhat richlauska calls a reward smile\nthis is when your lips are naturally\npulled directly upwards your eyebrows\nlift and you form small Dimples at the\nsides of your mouth the dominant smile\nis used when one communicates friendship\nand liking this includes pressing your\nlips together along with the appearance\nof small dimples lastly the deschen\nsmile is when your upper lip is raised\nyou wrinkle your nose and your cheeks\nget pushed upwards when smiling during\nthis smile you raise your upper lids and\nyou sort of sneer with the indentation\nbetween your nose and mouth naturally\ndeepening so if you happen to notice\nsomeone you've been recently talking to\nusing the dishen smile they may just be\ntrying to tell you that they like you\nnow to discern whether they like you as\na friend or as someone more number three\ntheir face is flushed when people get\nattracted to someone they can become\nanxious a kick of adrenaline and\nsuddenly they're flushing if you notice\nsomeone often blushes around you and\ntheir face becomes flushed when you're\ntalking to them they may really like you\nnumber four their pupils dilate another\nway to tell if someone is attracted to\nyou look into their eyes to see if their\npupils dilate according to body language\nexpert Patty Wood author of success\nsignals a guide to reading body language\ndilation is a brain response that occurs\nwhen you like and are attracted to\nsomething so if you notice someone's\npeople's dialing late when they look\ndeeply into your eyes mid-conversation\nthis could likely be a sign they're\nattracted to you the good thing is if\nyour pupils dilate an attraction as well\nit's a good thing to be revealed in a\nsignificant research study published in\nthe journal Scientific American\nresearchers showed male subjects two\nphotographs of the same woman in one\nimage researchers changed the size of\nher pupils to be faintly larger while\nthe other image was adjusted so she had\nsmaller pupils none of the men reported\nnoticing this light change the men\ndescribed the women with small pupils as\ncold hard and selfish the woman with\nlarger pupils were described as soft\nmore feminine and pretty many further\nStudies have had similar results when it\ncomes to women's preferences on pupil\nsize studies suggest that they are\nsimilar in some ways findings appear to\nsuggest that women who are attracted to\nnice guys are attracted to medium-sized\npupils while those who like bad boys are\nattracted to larger pupils well\nobviously we can't control the size of\nour pupils but dimming the lights will\nexpand them so when you're having a\nconversation with your crush and your\npupils dilate due to attraction they may\njust find you subtly more attractive due\nto this number five they groom\nthemselves when you approach them\nso you're approaching someone and you\ncan't help but notice that they suddenly\nreadjust their clothing fix their hair\nand straighten their posture this\nbehavior is a common sign of Attraction\nwhen we like someone we often want to\npresent our best selves and appear as\nattractive as possible so if you catch\nsomeone quickly grooming themselves as\nyou approach them go ahead and give them\na compliment in turn odds are may just\nmake their day and then you can notice\nif they strongly blush in response and\nnumber six they lean toward you you lean\nin your seat as that final scene plays\ntears streaming down your face as the\ndramatic scene comes to its dramatic\nconclusion why do you do this because\nyou are not only interested but\nemotionally invested in this show same\ngoes for people according to\npsychologist Jack Shafer people lean\ntowards people they like and distance\nthemselves from people they dislike\ninward leaning increases as report\nincreases meaning you may first turn\nyour head towards someone then your\nshoulders followed by your torso then if\nyou're really interested in what someone\nhas to say you'll lean towards them so\nwhen someone is attracted to another\nperson odds are they may just lean\ntowards them when they get the chance\nnot just for a kiss but because they are\ndeeply interested in what they have to\nsay and who they are let's just hope\ntears aren't streaming down their face\nit's just a movie it's just a movie but\nyou're too emotionally invested\nso are you now a real Sherlock Holmes\nwhen it comes to signs of Attraction\nwhich of these body language signs have\nyou noticed in someone let us know in\nthe comments down below if you enjoyed\nthis video don't forget to click the\nlike button and share
