    "transcript": "hey secta-goers do you feel that someone\nclose to you has internal struggles that\nthey fight every day\nor maybe that's you too\nmany people bottle up their emotions and\nconceal their troubles all to themselves\nadding your depression can be\ndebilitating\nif prolonged without necessary help\nthese feelings can turn into a state of\ndespair and isolation that can be\ndifficult for them to escape\nare you or a loved one hiding depression\nhere are some signs someone is hiding\ntheir depression\nnumber one they're pessimistic about the\nfuture\ndo they feel hopeless about their future\nwhen you ask secretly depressed people\nabout their plans they would either act\ndismissive curt or avoidant but in truth\nthese people often struggle to find\nmeaning in their future and instead view\nit in a negative light\nthey likely have thought hard about it\nbut they always seem to end up just\nshort of making sense of it\nthese feelings stem from a feeling of\ninadequacy and can cause mental anguish\nto both them and their close friends\nnumber two they have a hard time\nconcentrating\ndo you often lose their attention when\nyou speak with them are they losing\ntheir train of thought during\nconversations way too often\nthis shows memory and concentration\nissues a common symptom of depression\nthis worsened memory state is even\nharder for them to have an honest chat\nwith their friends and family\nsince it's hard and draining for them to\narticulate it they end up pushing their\nthoughts aside and further concealing\ntheir burdens which doesn't solve any\nproblems\nit helps when you can make a safe space\nfor your friend for an honest\nconversation\nbeing patient with their scattered\nthoughts gives them confidence that\nyou're there for them\nnumber three their body undergoes big\nchanges\ndo they complain about pains and aches\naround their body despite the absence of\nexternal injuries\nwhile depression is primarily a mental\nhealth issue it can present itself in\nour bodies too\ngaining or losing weight are some signs\nof depression as well as back aches\ndigestive problems headaches and chronic\nconditions\nresearch reports that people with masked\ndepression are more prone to common pain\nthan those who don't suffer from the\nillness\nso if they have unexplainable aches and\nare in a constant downcast mood\ndepression might be something they're\nfacing\nnumber four they get unusually quiet\ndoes it feel like their energy has been\nzapped for seemingly no reason\nwhile it's normal to just have nothing\nto say at times a pattern of long\nsilences may be a sign of something\nstirring up underneath\nwhile asking them whether their fine\ncould temporarily bring their minds back\nto reality\nthey'll eventually resort back to\nkeeping everything to themselves as a\ncoping mechanism\nthey may not feel sad per se but instead\nfeel a pervading feeling of dread and\nemptiness internally asking themselves\nwhat's the point\nalthough they try to appear normal and\ncould successfully do so enjoying a\nconversation with friends still feels\ndifficult they'd much rather retreat to\nthe solace of silence instead\nnumber five\nthey keep conversations surface level\ndoes it sometimes feel like they have a\nbrick wall put up\nsecretly depressed people can enjoy and\nhave normal conversations but when you\npry on their innermost insecurities they\ncan feel the burn of the pain again\nwhich forces them to hold back up\nfeelings of betrayal from the past could\nresurface transporting them back to how\nbad it felt during a time when they felt\nthe brunt of the impact\nalthough their composure doesn't waver\nand they don't break down or lash out\nthey'll stick with the solace of safe\ntopics because they know those topics\nwon't ever hurt them\nand number six they smile to hide their\npain\ndo they tend to brush off their feelings\nand smile them away instead\nwhat makes depression so sinister is the\nease with which one can hide it all\nbehind a smile\nthey force a facade of happiness to free\nothers from the burden of dealing with\ntheir problems\nhowever there are times where signs of\nthis facade show behind the cracks and\nreveal a shell of a lonely sad and\nhurting human in its wake\nin cases like this sharing your concern\nwith them and offering them emotional\nsupport may help them significantly\nwhile it might feel like prodding into\ntheir business they need to hear it is\nokay to let others share their burden\nin times like these knowing your near\nand dear ones support you can help to a\ngreat degree emotionally and might also\nencourage them to seek professional help\nso it's better to let them know that\nyou're there for them but not push the\nconversation any further if they are\nunwilling\nhave you seen any signs of hidden\ndepression that your friend may be\nfacing above do any of these describe\nyour experience leave a
