emotions doesn't\nhave to be a bad thing though\nfor example anger alerts you of a\nboundary being crossed while fear tells\nyou that there is some kind of danger\npresent\nbut when you ignore suppress or dwell on\nthese negative emotions for too long\nthey can cause you to feel worse about\nyourself\nthese negative emotions can fester\ninside and create deeply rooted\nresentments which can alter your\nperspective on life making you a\nprisoner to your emotions\nit takes a lot of maturity and\nself-awareness to analyze and break down\nyour negative emotions\nelizabeth scott phd suggests a method\ncalled tears\nwhich stands for teach express accept\nreframe and social support this distills\ndown to learning and listening to how\nyour body responds to negative emotions\nand using them to learn about yourself\nand to grow into a wiser and happier\nperson\nnumber two\npractice gratitude\nif you're stuck in the toxic hustle\nculture you won't be able to find\nlong-term happiness it

to\nappreciate the little things the things\nthat you already have in your life\nthere's plenty of research linking\ngratitude to happiness an article by\nharvard health states that practicing\ngratitude helps you acknowledge the good\nthings in your life and can help you\nfeel connected to something greater than\nyourself\npracticing gratitude forces you to look\npast your worries and perceived losses\nand to focus on the things that are\nbefore you now\nif you look closely you will find so\nmany things to be grateful for\ngratitude instills in you a sense of\ncontentment for the things you have and\nan acceptance for the things to come\none way to practice gratitude is to keep\ntrack of the things you are grateful for\nin a journal starting with

others even if it\ntakes time and effort it's important\nthat you make an attempt to keep in\ntouch with the people you care about and\ndon't take them for granted\nnumber six\nshare the happiness\nemotions are contagious they trickle\ndown through our interpersonal\nrelationships and affect those around us\nnicholas christakis professor of medical\nsociology and medicine at harvard\nmedical school\nfound that happiness is a collective\nphenomenon one of his studies suggests\nthat the closer whether in distance or\nrelation you are with someone who is\nhappy the happier you will become\nthe theory sounds a bit strange but\nthink about the last time you hung out\nwith a friend and how you felt after\nhow you both felt during or prior to\nhanging out are transmitted\nunconsciously in conversation which then\naffects how you feel\nthe great thing about this is that\nhappiness and other positive emotions\ncan be transmitted and come back to you\nso the more you spread happiness the\nbetter you will feel\nhave you tried to do any of these things\nand how did it make you feel let us know\nin the comments below the references and\nstudies used are
