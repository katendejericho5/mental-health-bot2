    "transcript": "hey sectors\ndo you feel guilty when you're upset for\nno reason\nlike many others you may think that\nyou're just being ungrateful or that\nit's wrong to feel\nsad\nangry or anxious when there's no\napparent reason for you to feel this way\nbut what if there's more to it than that\nwhat if you're not actually ungrateful\nbut you're depressed\nhow do you tell the difference\nwell people who often mislabel those\nstruggling with depression as emotional\nattention seekers who are taking\neverything they have for granted\nare those who don't understand what it's\nlike to live with a mental illness\nespecially not depression\nso with that said here are seven signs\nthat you're not actually ungrateful\nyou're depressed number one\nyou're more self-critical than usual\nare you really hard on yourself\ncountless studies have shown that\ndeteriorating self-esteem as well as\nstrong feelings of self-hatred and\nself-loathing are strongly associated\nwith depressive symptoms this is so much\nso that the american psychological\nassociation decided to add excessive\nfeelings of worthlessness as a criterion\nfor diagnosing a major depressive\nepisode\nso if you've been feeling a lot more\nself-critical than usual lately where\nyou constantly beat yourself up for\nevery little mistake and hyper fixate on\nall of your negative qualities and flaws\nthen this might be the reason why\nnumber two\nyou don't look forward to anything\nanymore when you're just feeling grouchy\nand unappreciative about everything the\nsimple solution would be to focus more\non the positive and find something good\nto look forward to\nbut when you're already going through\nthe throes of depression it can feel\nalmost impossible to look forward to\nanything anymore\nall the things you used to love so much\nlike your interests passions and\naccomplishments may no longer make you\nfeel anything\nlet alone anything good\nit may be hard to find joy or enjoyment\nout of anything no matter how hard you\ntry\nif you've been feeling this way then\nit's unlikely that you're just being\nungrateful but instead it may be a sign\nof depression do you relate to the two\npoints mentioned so far or know someone\nwho does comment below and share your\nexperiences to help encourage others to\nopen up about their experiences we will\nhighlight the ones that seem to be most\nimpactful in upcoming videos\nnumber three your emotions have become\nunstable and out of control\npeople who act bratty spoiled surly and\npetulant the moment they don't get what\nthey want or when something doesn't go\ntheir way may really just be ungrateful\nand immature they might be moody throw\ntemper tantrums and maybe even break\ndown or lash out on people for no good\nreason\nbut the same goes for those struggling\nwith depression too\nso how can we tell the difference\nwell for the latter there's usually no\ntrigger for it they just suddenly feel\nemotionally unstable when they rarely or\nnever used to before and it may manifest\nas either frequent anger and\nirritability or heightened sensitivity\nnumber four you've struggled with\nfeelings of depression for a while now\nwhen we're in a bad mood or feeling down\nit's easy to spiral into overly negative\nthoughts like this is the worst day ever\nor can nothing go right for me today\nthis can make you seem like you're being\nungrateful but if you've been struggling\nwith these dark thoughts and feelings\nfor a while now with no end in sight\nthen there might be more to it than you\nfirst thought\naccording to the diagnostic and\nstatistical manual of mental disorders\nthis persistently depressed mood must\nlast at least two weeks before it can be\nconsidered a depressive episode\nso think long and hard about when it was\nyou first started to feel this way\nnumber five you feel guilty about not\nhaving a good reason for feeling down\none of the key differences between\nsadness and depression is that\ndepression is often unprecedented that\nis to say there isn't always an obvious\ntrigger we can point to and say aha so\nthat's why i've been feeling depressed\nlately so if you're struggling with\ndepression without even realizing it or\ndon't have much awareness about what it\nis you may find yourself feeling\nterribly guilty as well for\nseeming ungrateful or being such a\ndowner all the time\nor what seems like no good reason number\nsix you're frustrated with yourself and\nyour inability to just get over it\nsimilar to our last point if you're\nsuffering from undiagnosed depression to\nthose who don't understand\nit can look a lot like you're just being\noverly dramatic and ungrateful\ntaking for granted all the good things\nyou have in your life\nand you will often hear from them\nsanctimonious unsolicited advice about\nhow happiness is a choice and that you\ncan snap out of your depression if you\nreally tried hard enough\nyeah no\ndepression isn't just something you can\ncure with some self-help books or a few\nmotivational videos mental illness is\nreal and it's just as serious and\ndebilitating as any physical illness\nand number seven\nyou can choose to stop being ungrateful\nyou can't choose to stop being depressed\nfinally but perhaps most importantly we\nneed to understand that mental illness\nisn't a choice\nsome people will struggle with mental\nillness for most of their lives and it\nwon't be because they didn't try hard\nenough\ndepression is an especially tricky one\nsince psychologists are still trying to\nfigure out what exactly causes it but\nthe challenges our brain chemistry or\npast traumas create for us\nare never too big for us to overcome\nespecially when we're not alone\nso if you think there's more to your\nrecent feelings of depression than\nyou just being ungrateful\nit might be time to talk to a\nprofessional about it seek help\nso did you relate to any of the signs\nwe've mentioned\ndon't forget to share a story about your\nown personal challenges to help inspire\na movement towards open dialogues we\nwill highlight the most impactful ones\nin a future video"
