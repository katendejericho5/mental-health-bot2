it\nto help you get your life together here\nare six things that may be controlling\nyour life\nnumber one\nalways being on social media\nwould you say you use social media a\nhealthy amount of time or are you on the\nverge of extremely unhealthy too much of\nany one thing can have negative effects\nand way too much social media such as\nfacebook can possibly make you feel\nworse\na 2013 study from the university of\nmichigan published in the journal plos\none found a correlation between facebook\nuse and dissatisfaction\nfor two weeks researchers text messaged\nsubjects to see how individuals felt\neach moment and how satisfied they were\nwith their lives\nas the research published states results\nindicate that facebook use predicts\nnegative shifts on both of these\nvariables over time the more people used\nfacebook at a one time point the worse\nthey felt the next time we text messaged\nthem the more they used facebook over\ntwo weeks the more their life\nsatisfaction levels declined over time\nso when you feel inclined to check your\nsocial media notifications every half\nhour\nit's time to reassess whether it's\nreally worth it at the very least please\nlock your phone away before you go to\nbed this means you'll likely have to\npurchase a real alarm clock to make it\nto school or work on time\nnumber two procrastinating\nare you guilty of procrastination\nfrequently procrastinating sometimes can\nmake us feel as if we have no control\nwhen it gets too late to complete the\noriginal required task\nall you want to do is sit down and\nfinish that art project due tomorrow\nbut you just got a new notification on\nyour favorite app and it just can't wait\none step you can take to stop\nprocrastinating is to put away any\ndistractions and work on the task at\nhand in a quiet place\nthen think in baby steps as you complete\nyour work divide the tasks into small\nachievable goals\nthe next task to ward off\nprocrastination and attempt to focus on\nthe next one\nnumber three judging yourself too\nharshly and negative thoughts\nhow critical are you of yourself\nare you over critical does your mind\nrace with negative thoughts and harsh\nself-judgment\nresearch continues to show that your\nthoughts about yourself strongly affect\nhow you feel\nthe best way to change any negative\nfeelings you may have is to counteract\nthem with a positive one according to\npsychologist patricia hartneck when we\nperceive ourself and our life negatively\nwe can end up viewing experiences in a\nway that confirms the notion instead\npractice using words that promote\nfeelings of self-worth and personal\npower so instead of saying i was\nhorrible at my math test use positive\nwords and self-compassion like i'll\nstudy harder next time then i'll do\nbetter on the next test number four\ngoing to bed late when you have time to\nsleep earlier\noh how many of you go to bed late when\nyou have enough time to go to bed on\ntime\nthe long hours spent hunched over your\ncomputer into the night may catch up to\nyou\nyou may feel pretty exhausted the next\nday if you don't get around eight hours\nof sleep\nwe need a good night's rest to recharge\nwith enough energy for the next day\nnot getting your eight hours of sleep\nevery night has been shown to negatively\naffect your mental health what makes\nthings worse is sixty to ninety percent\nof patients with depression also have\ninsomnia according to the sleep health\nfoundation\nso people whose emotional well-being may\nalready be

stay up late on your\nphone when you know you should be\nsleeping you're already ignoring a great\npart of your physical health as well as\nmental\nyour life can be filled with busy days\nand constant interruptions but it's best\nnot to ignore your mental and physical\nhealth\nmost of our health problems will arise\nlater rather than sooner if we don't\ntake care of our health now\nthe national heart lung and blood\ninstitute recommends that you get your\ncholesterol measured about once every\nfive years starting from the age of 20.\nthat's one way you can check on your\nphysical health
