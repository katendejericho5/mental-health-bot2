    "transcript": "think quick\nwhat are the most desirable things ever\nnot like a ps5 or a lamborghini but\nmoney affordable rent we bet love is in\nthere somewhere\nso if you're in a relationship you're\nprobably willing to let a few things\nslide that you wouldn't with your\naverage buddy\nthat's normal we all need a little give\nand take to make things work but\nwhen is it over the line\nwhen does that annoying thing get so bad\nthat it's gone into the realm of toxic\nit can be too easy to let things go\nuntil there may be imminent danger we\ndon't want that so let's go over what to\nlook out for\nnumber one\ncontrolling behavior\ndo you feel suffocated in the\nrelationship maybe getting the\nimpression that your life and choices\naren't even yours anymore\nthat could be a sign that the behavior\nof your partner has gone from\ncompassionate concern to controlling\npuppeteer\nthe occasional where are you going is\nfairly standard especially if you're\nliving together it's good to have\nsomeone know where you are just in case\nif the questions seem like they're\nplaying you like a video game character\nthough\nyou can't go there unless i want you to\nor\ni'll choose what interest you have and\nwho you talk to\nthis might be time to have a little chat\nto reassert your own personhood number\ntwo\nthere's a lack of communication\nall relationships are built on\ncommunication a relationship is a\nmulti-way street where all parties meet\non a common ground of understanding\nif you tell your partner that something\nthey did was hurtful and they listen to\nyou asking why it hurt or apologizing\nthen explaining themselves to further\nunderstanding that's communicating\nif the response is a stubborn that's who\ni am deal with it or a defensive i never\ndid that or even a victim blaming that's\nyour problem suck it up that is\ndefinitely not communication\nsimilarly if the conversations are\nsounding like you're running into a\nbrick wall that has offensive defenses\nthis is a sign your relationship has\nturned toxic\nnumber three\nthe give and take is consistently only\none way\na healthy relationship is all about give\nand take without this balance you're\nlooking at a crash and burnout when the\ngive is constantly on one side with the\ntake permanently on the other that's a\nhuge red flag\nif you find yourself constantly\nexhausted anxious and asking yourself\nwhat can i do for them\nyet they seem oddly laid back nonchalant\nmaybe even taking your efforts for\ngranted\nit's time to ask them and yourself\nwhat exactly is going on here\nnumber four\nthere are no boundaries in the\nrelationship\ndo you or your partner spout sugary\nproclamations like i'll be there for\nthem for anything i will do anything for\ntheir love\nthis is unrealistic and super unhealthy\nas close as you might be\nboundaries still need to be present\nyou know what it looks like when there\nare no boundaries\nit looks like vampirism it looks like\nconstant favors and ignoring your needs\nit looks like someone who doesn't have\ncompassion or empathy using their\npartner only to further their own goals\na healthy relationship requires mutual\nrespect\nand part of that respect is boundaries\nnumber five\nyour partner uses your personal\ninformation against you\nusing your personal information to harm\nyou\nthat is not a handwave offense\nthat's a capital red flag crime this is\njust straight up backstabbing and below\nthe belt dirty fighting\nchances are the information was told in\nconfidence as in it was understood that\nit is not for public consumption and you\nlet your guard down\nyou gave them your trust by being\nvulnerable\nusing that information against you just\nso they can look good further their own\nagenda prove their superiority or any\nother self-serving reason is grounds for\na call out or a break off\nnumber six\nthey do not acknowledge your\nrelationship in front of other people if\nyou're in a good healthy worth it\nrelationship why would you hide it under\nnormal circumstances if the relationship\nis hidden they're saying that they're\nashamed of it\nworse they might be saying they're\nashamed of you\nif they're ashamed of you why are they\nreally in this relationship with you\nanyhow you don't need that\nwave that red flag\nand number seven you are constantly\nsurrounded by negative energy\nfine saying negative energy might sound\na little too woo-woo but we're serious\nmaybe it's more solid sounding if we say\nthat the red flag is when your partner\nis constantly introducing and\nmaintaining negative emotional or\npsychological stress for example\nwhenever you talk to them about a new\ngoal instead of discussing ways to plan\nit out they're constantly finding\nreasons to shut it down\nbeyond conscientiously warning you of\npossible dangers that you may be unaware\nof they outright close off the\npossibility or denigrate you for wanting\nit\nthat is the negative energy we're saying\nis a red flag they're keeping you\ndepressed and underfoot despite your\nmultiple attempts to move forward\nwe are totally with you in this\nsentiment that relationships are\nvaluable\nbut we'll add in the healthy\nrelationships are valuable\ntoxic relationships will actively\ndeplete the goodness in your life so be\ntrue to yourself and don't accept the\nred flags which one of these points or\nbehaviors have you noticed before how\ndid you handle it feel free to comment\nshare and discuss thank you for watching\nand we'll see you soon"
