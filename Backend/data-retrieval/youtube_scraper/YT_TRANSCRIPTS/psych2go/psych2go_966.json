    "transcript": "hi welcome to ask an expert an interview\nseries where we chat with experts\nranging from clinicians to those with\nlived expertise\nmy name is monica and i'm a medical\nstudent with a strong interest in\npsychiatry and psychology\ni really love these fields because they\nreally give us a basis to start\nunderstanding ourselves and potentially\nour relationship with others\nand with today's topic the idea of\nattachment styles if you've ever been\nkeen to really understand how your\nattachment style could potentially\ninfluence your relationship with\nyourself and with others then do join us\nfor the next 30 minutes or so as we chat\nabout exactly that\nand with that as well i'd love to\nintroduce you to our wonderful guest for\ntoday's episode dr kirk honda\nhi welcome\nthanks glad to be here\ngreat to have you here\nshould you would you like to tell us all\nabout\nyourself a bit and the kind of work you\ndo\nsure\ni\nhave been a therapist and a professor\nfor 25 years in seattle\nin psychology marriage of family therapy\nand\n14 years ago i started a podcast and\nyoutube channel\nin which we currently make about 20\nepisodes a week\non all sorts of things so\nall things psychology related and\nsometimes not honestly so that's that's\nme\nthat's wonderful and i also hear that\nyou have a special interest as well in\nattachment theory and attachment styles\nso shall we just delve right in yeah\nlet's do it amazing\nuh i know a lot of people especially in\nthe psychical community are quite\ncurious to learn about the different\ntypes of attachment styles that there\nare so shall we begin with a brief\noverview of the different attachment\nstyles\nyeah\nso\ni want to have a caveat which is that a\nlot of the\ndiscourse and articles and youtube\nvideos about attachment styles online\nare good\nand i can stand behind a lot of it but\nit often\ngives a simplistic\num overview that people walk away with a\nsimplistic idea an introduction if you\nwill\nand\nthe\ngeneral premise i want to state so that\npeople can understand\nwhere it all comes from where the theory\ncomes from from john bolby\nand others that\nuh and this is my model this is the way\nthat i think about it and i use this not\nonly with my clients but i teach it i\nuse it my personal life\nwhen i feel hurt with by my wife you\nknow something that she does i sift it\nthrough my attachment model which is\nthus\nthat\nwe are creatures and other animals as\nwell where we have a stimulus\nwe have some sort of processing about\nwhat's what we're observing what you\nknow what we're picking up what we're\nperceiving\nand then it will motivate and we'll have\nmaybe an emotion about that and then we\nhave a urge to behave in a certain way\nfor survival for procreation this sort\nof thing so when it we clearly evolved\nto attach like a lot of other primates\ndo\nwe evolved to seek proximity that's what\nattached means seek proximity to\nattachment figures\nparticularly when we're zero to\nfive but really throughout our life\nwe're attachment oriented creatures\nuh arguably more so than any other\nanimal and we thus evolved mechanisms of\nemotion and behavioral motivation\nto keep us close so you can imagine\nsomeone's born two hundred thousand\nyears ago on the african savannah the\npleisocene and that person genetically\njust doesn't have those mechanisms that\ndrive them to attach to their attachment\nfigures and they wander off a little too\nfar from the tribe and they get\nliterally eaten by a panther or they\nfall off a cliff or they get lost and\nstarve that that would happen and so\nwe've been selected for people that have\ntremendous emotions\nuh and motivations to attach and so\nthat's the basis of attachment theory\nso when it comes to attachment styles\nthese are just descriptors categories of\nhelping us to understand the the common\nstyles that people will\nexhibit\nthat is a reflection of that stimulus\nemotion behavioral motivation style so\nwhen we understand the foundation we\ndon't necessarily slot people always\ninto one of the four categories because\nwe only have four categories for\nattachment styles and\nhow do we count you know eight billion\npeople on the planet so that means that\nyou know billions and billions of people\nare in one category it's hard to do but\npeople are different everyone's\ndifferent so everyone's going to have a\ndifferent combo for example for me\nmostly secure ish\nover time with a lot of therapy and a\nlot of work in my marriage and whatnot\nand i have a dash of avoidance and a\nsmaller dash of preoccupation so what am\ni do you call me secure\nyou know\nbut even that descriptor there's a lot\nmore to it so attachment styles are\nwhen someone is avoidant for example\nlike i have a dash of that 10 15\nthat when there's a stimulus of\nlack of proximity or distance\nemotionally or physically from\nattachment figures so say\nmy wife is stressed out and i get the\nvibe that she's\npreoccupied with other things and she\ndoesn't have time for me to make me feel\nloved and appreciated this sort of thing\nso that's the stimulus\nand then\ni have a perception about that like\nyou know and that can play a role right\nif i perceive it well she's stressed out\nthat's a different emotional response\nwhereas if i perceive it as\nshe wants to leave me or she's cheating\non me or something then that's a\ndifferent emotional response so the\nperception of it the cognitive\nperception of the schemas that this\nfilter through won't go into the detail\nin that but\nso i have an emote so i have a let's say\nthat i go down the road of like i feel\nlike she's rejecting me\nthen i have an emotion which is hurt\nyeah i feel hurt that i'm being rejected\nbecause i evolved to feel that pain and\nit's not just like\nintellectual pain when we measure these\nthings neurologically and monica you\nmight be able to comment on this since\nthis is your air we actually find that\nit's the same neurological\npain uh processing in the brain that we\ngo through when we actually stab\nourselves in the arm when we feel\ndistance it's it's painful so we you\nknow i might feel that pain and then i\nalso have fear anxiety about being left\nalone i evolved to have those emotional\nresponses to distance\nnow from there\ngod knows what sort of flow chart from\nthose emotional\nfeelings i might have because if\ni was younger i wouldn't necessarily be\naware of that pain i would just um as an\navoidant\noriented person i might distance myself\nfrom my emotions so effectively\nthroughout my life that i don't even\nrecognize\nthat i'm having a feeling but i start\nfeeling certain urges in my brain like\nyou know maybe i should\ntell her maybe i should scowl at her\nreject her back or divorce or something\nlike that you know certain urges certain\nsentences run through my mind but those\nare\nfar down the line in the flow chart of\nthe original stimulus and perception and\nemotion of hurt and anxiety\nso\nthen\nmy tendency from that emotion of hurt\nand anxiety if i'm avoided is to\ndistance and to shut down my emotions\nand say i'm okay on my own i don't need\nanyone else okay so that's generally\navoided if i'm preoccupied\nthen i would lean in and pursue i might\nget angry at her and say you're so\ndistant all the time and you never pay\nattention to me or you get too stressed\nout by work or\ni might triangulate someone i might call\nher mom and say like your daughter's\nbeing a jerk face you gotta talk to her\nyou know so i'm i'm indirectly now if\ni'm more aware of my preoccupation i\nmight have a different reaction to that\nso that's general preoccupation is to be\noverly anxious and overly focused and\noverly desperate i guess\nwhich can result in a whole variety of\nbehaviors\nbut it's more active more\nnoticeable avoidant people you you might\nnot ever know they're avoiding because\nthey'll just quietly become more\nindependent and they seem fine they\nmight not even know they're struggling\npreoccupied people typically they know\nthey're struggling and it's it's obvious\nto people on the outside but there but\nthey don't make no doubt about it both\navoidant and preoccupied people are\nstruggling avoiding people just they\ndon't look like they're struggling but\nthey're struggling okay\nso then if we look too disorganized or\nwhat we sometimes call fearful\nthese people\nit's sort of a special category of\ninsecure attachment style these people\nearly in life were abused they were\nterrorized by their attachment figures\nso\nsometimes it's it's described as a\ncombination to an avoiding preoccupied\nerase that from your brain because\nthat's just not accurate\nthe way to think about it is where it\ncomes from so you as a two-year-old are\nso\nyou'll see this if you've ever been\naround infants that when they're scared\nsay a stranger comes into the room they\nrun to their parent they run to their\nattachment figure and they'll hide\nbehind their attachment figure or if you\nenter into\na party\nwith your child they'll they'll be quiet\nand they'll stick right by you we\nevolved to do that\nnow\nthat looks different when we're older\nwhen we're 35 we don't necessarily we\nmight actually do that but it'll be more\nof a of a it'll look differently but\nanyway so when we're two\nwe seek proximity when we're scared\nand\nfrom danger so when we have some sort of\nindication of threat we run to our\nsecure base\nwell what if\nthe threat is also the secure base what\nif your parent is the threat where do\nyou run you don't know you have an urge\nto run away from threat desperately\nand run toward the attachment figure but\nit's the same person the person is\nthreatening you is the secure base and\nthe child doesn't know what to do and so\nyou'll see kids\nfreeze in place they'll dissociate\nthey'll flop on the ground they'll\nscream they'll sort of go back and forth\num high distress because they have\nnowhere to go with avoidant people with\npreoccupied people typically these\nindividuals had at least some way of\ncoping you know the avoiding person went\nto the self they\npreoccupied person\nclung to their parent\nbut the disorganized person there was no\nway to know where to go and so these\npeople tend to be fairly\nin distress throughout their life and so\nas they\ngain\nyou know their adults\nas they get closer to attachment figures\nlike a partner\nthey start to feel that fear of i'm\ngoing to be harmed and so they don't\nknow what to do they they are desperate\nfor closeness as all of us are but\nparticularly them because they've never\nhad it but the closer they get the more\nafraid they feel and they'll interpret\nit as a threat and they might even\naccuse their partner of doing things\nthat they're not doing and they can\nimagine things that are happening that\naren't that aren't actually happy it's\nnot delusional but it's emotional\ndistortion if you will\nsecure\nis often misunderstood as like\npeople that are\nwithout problems you know they're\nsecure you know securely attached\nindividuals they have no problems\nthey're they never overreact they never\navoid\num\nit's not true so\nevery secure person probably needs five\nyears of therapy 10 years of therapy so\njust give you an idea of\nwhat a secure person is in my mind these\npeople\ntend to not always but they tend to\nbe less distorted they tend to be able\nto regulate their emotions better they\ntend to balance independence with\ndependence they tend to\nknow when to reach out to and to whom to\nreach out to when they are sad and needy\nof other people and when they need to\nthey can kind of depend on themselves\nbut there's a balance but these people\nalso have problems you know i don't know\nif you can air up helicopters flying\nover here\nvery loud helicopter i've never heard a\nhelicopter in that lap\nanyway um so secure people\nuh\ntend to do better in life but they can\ncertainly\nhave and\nalways do have relationship problems so\nthat's in a nutshell\nattachment styles that's amazing i like\nthe way that you break it down from\nstimulus perception emotion and then\ncovering just like a just to summarize\nlike avoidant being the emotion uh the\nreaction of being distant preoccupation\nbeing to like lean in more to pursue\nmore um fearful just get a bunch of\ndifferent emotions like from freezing to\ndissociation just not knowing what to do\nbecause it's that that safe that safe\nperson is also simultaneously\nthreatening and finally the secure the\nless distorted that balance between\nindependence independence yeah it was a\ngreat\na great explanation and i really like\nthe way that you also like brought in\nthe idea like the whole theory of um\nkind of testing what a child would do in\nthe presence of like a stranger for\nexample because in my studies i've also\ncome across with across that study i\nthink it's called the strange\nthe stranger experiment or something by\nlike mary ainsworth and uh they brought\nin\nthey brought in a parent they also\nbrought in the child and then they would\nintroduce a stranger and see what what\nwould happen how they would react so\nit's actually quite interesting\nespecially because they bring in\nchildren um assuming that\na lot of this comes from\nperhaps like childhood experiences\nrather than something that's genetic i'm\nnot actually quite sure exactly so i\nwonder if you have any thoughts about\nkind of the the beginning of how people\ndevelop the attachment style that they\ndo\nyeah so\nregarding genetics it's hard to know the\nrole but there are likely different\ndials if you will that are turned up or\ndown when someone's born like someone's\na little bit more sensitive someone's a\nlittle bit more um independent so to\nspeak they're different\ndials that we have regarding our\ntemperament it's hard to know if that's\ntrue or not because we instantly start\nsocializing children as soon as they\ncome out of the womb but\nthey're uh\nso thinking about that but\nalso more importantly\nattunement is the key so\nwhen you're trying to avoid insecure\nattachment in children and adults it's\nall about attunement so attunement is\nthe parent noticing the child's\nemotional state\nyou know reasonably well and two\nreacting\neffectively to that emotional state\nreasonably well and reasonably\nconsistently\nso\nwhen you have that dynamic\nthen the child learns that they matter\nin the world and that they are okay\nbecause if you're reacting well to you\nknow if the child's sad or grumpy or\nuncomfortable and the parent chastises\nthe kid the kid thinks there's something\nwrong with me there's something wrong\nwith my emotions you know and i could go\ninto all the different manifestations of\nproblematic parenting but\nwhen you have attunement parent notices\nyou reasonably enough caregiver notices\nyou and responds well to you\nwhich often just involves like\njust reflecting like oh i see you're\nuncomfortable can i help you with that\nor\ni i notice that you're kind of grumpy\ntoday or oh that is upsetting i'm with\nyou you know just being seen by a parent\nis often just all that is needed\nand through that the child learns to\nbelieve that they're worthy as a human\nbeing they also get to know their\nemotions they also learn\noh that's what that is because children\nthey don't know what their emotions are\nthey're just you know emotional\nspontaneity machines but when the parent\nsays oh i see you're hurt or i see\nyou're uncomfortable i see you're angry\nor is this what you're feeling the kid's\nlike oh yeah i guess i am kind of angry\nand through that they learn i'm okay and\nmy and i can trust other people i can\nactually reach out i can emote and\nsomeone will be there to not harm me and\nbetter yet even just take care of me and\nnotice me\nso\nwhen you have that then you tend to have\nmore secure attachment in a child and\nthis will also happen later in life so\nyou can be raised relatively well and go\nthrough a really horrific\nset of long-term intense\nrelational experiences later in life and\nit can also alter your\nworking models and your attachment style\nso to speak\nso when you have a problem with that you\nhave neglect or you have inconsistent\nparenting or abuse or confusing\nparenting or the parent is blaming of\nyou or gets overly angry with your\nemotions\nthen you\nstart to\nfigure out based on how things are\nworking out for you\nthat the secure base that purse because\nyou know not only do we run to our\nparents to be close to them because they\ncan protect us from danger and threat\nbut also emotionally we reach out to our\nparents right so we will cry or we'll be\nuncomfortable or angry or happy or\njoyous or something and we need the\nsecure base to be there for us and to\nnotice us\nand\nwhen they're not then\nwe start to develop ways of coping with\nthat which we call avoidant disorganized\nand preoccupied so for the preoccupied\nperson\ntheir solution at two years old maybe\neven 18 months\nwas well in order for me to get more\nattachment security and attunement i\nhave to\nexaggerate my emotions which actually\nmeans it would be best if i felt my\nemotions bigger neurologically if\nactually just\nactually had bigger emotions and so\nneurologically\nthe child is conditioned to\nfeel bigger emotions and express them\nvery noticeably and very often and you\nknow that sort of thing so and through\nthat\nthey get you know they start with say\ntwenty percent attunement that they're\ngetting and they it bumps them up to\nfifty percent they're still not a\nhundred percent but they're better off\nwith that um you know coping style for\nthe avoidant person they're like\nwell if i avoid\nattachment figures then\ni don't have to feel the pain of it and\nso\nit will reduce i'm not getting more\nattunement because i'm i'm no longer\nsignaling that i need attunement but the\npain involved in the lack of attention\nis actually lessened so overall\ni'm better off by turning away or trying\nto turn away from my attachment figures\nso\nin a nutshell that's how\nall of this gets started\nyes thank you so much for giving us an\nin-depth explanation of that so it seems\nlike to me the kind of\nthe kind of tattoo style that seems the\nmost healthiest is the secure attachment\nstyle and how can one especially perhaps\nafter\nunfortunate experiences go towards that\nchange their mindset change the way that\nthey relate to others\nso there are two pillars that i\ntalk about which is the two pillars of\nattachment-based therapy and also to\nsome extent my style of psychodynamic\ntherapy which is that\none is awareness and two is corrective\nexperiences so the first step often\ninvolves awareness so the more you are\naware of\nyou know that stimulus perception\nemotion behavioral motivation\ncycle\nthen you can intervene you can be like i\nhave an urge right now to say i want a\ndivorce but if i work my way back in the\nflow chart given my new awareness of\nmyself i can say\nwell i'm guessing that okay if i'm if\ni'm feeling like i want to yell i want a\ndivorce\ni'm probably hurt and afraid\nokay what am i what am i what's what\ncaused me to feel hurt and afraid okay\nthis happened\nand\nif i actually\nand i'm assuming i can't tell my partner\nthat i'm hurt or afraid i'm assuming i\ncan't tell my partner\nyou hurt my feelings and so that's why\ni'm not saying that and instead i'm\nresorting to i want a divorce or some\nother\nveiled passive way of trying to\ncommunicate that i'm upset but i i can't\nbe directly upset because i learned in\nmy past that didn't work out for me so\ni'm indirectly upset but i've learned\nthat i shouldn't do that so i should be\nmore direct and say yesterday when you\nsaid this or my feelings\nmaybe i'm over sensitive i don't know\nbut\nyou know\ndo you do you agree with me am i am i\nokay feeling her you know that kind of\num so that's awareness so you're still\nhaving the urge you're still having the\nreactivity but you're intervening with\nsome self-awareness so this will get you\nabout halfway down the road\nthe other half is corrective experiences\nwhich means you experience relationships\nthat are secure\noften we can do this in therapy with a\nan attachment-based therapist or a\ntherapist that is doing attachment sort\nof work whether they know it or not\nhonestly\nor in a relationship spousal\nrelationship friend relationship mentor\nrelationship you experience someone that\nis attuned to you someone that pays\nattention to you that knows you that\ndoesn't punish you that doesn't turn\naway from you\nthat cares about you\nand it can be mutual right you can\nbe in a spousal relationship and have\nthat so\nor in therapy it's you know it's not\nit's not that way obviously but\nthrough that corrective experience you\nactually change your assumptions about\nyourself and other people and thus you\nchange your attachment style because\nfrom for example with the preoccupied\nplace you're you're assuming that you\nkind of don't matter\nand the only way people will pay\nattention to you is if you kind of force\nthe issue\nbut\nthat's that assumption isn't always it\nwas true when they were three but it's\nnot true necessarily about their partner\ntheir spouse\nso if they actually go through a secure\nuh earned security what we call it then\nthe assumption is like oh i used to\nreally feel like i didn't matter and\nthat other people\ni had to convince them to love me but\nyou know i don't i don't really feel\nthat anymore because i've had three\nyears of intense\nnoticeable\nlove and attention even when\ni didn't demand it so it's sort of\nretraining your brain and\nthen after the corrective experience\nwhich could for some people literally\ntake 25 years of therapy\nthen you no longer have to be super self\naware of things because you no longer\nhave the impulse to\nsabotage your relationships\nyeah sounds like it's it involves a\nwhole not just yourself but it also\ninvolves people that you interact\nyourself around to actually ultimately\nshape the kind of\nattachment style that you have so\num\ndefinitely very interesting and i know\nthat you mentioned earlier like the term\npsychodynamic\nis that the kind of modality you think\nthat's the most\nkind of\nattuned to promoting awareness and\ncorrective experiences or do you think\nother kind of modalities like cbt dvt\nmight also be appropriate\nyeah so\nthis could take a long time to describe\nbut generally speaking\nyes that\nand there are therapists that call\nthemselves attachment-based so you don't\nhave to look for another theory um but\nyeah a lot of psychodynamic but\npsychodynamic can mean a lot of\ndifferent things so it's hard to know\nwhat someone means by that but\ncommonly that does mean and you know the\nphrase corrective experiences actually\ncomes from psychodynamic therapy from\nthe 40s actually\npsychoanalysis and so\nyeah and then things like dbt cbt these\nkinds of uh you know therapies are\nperhaps\noriented towards that first pillar which\nis the self-awareness side but it\ndepends because you could go to a cbt\ntherapist and\nthey would have no idea or really no\norientation to help you with that so\nit's it's it's kind of trial and error\nto some extent\nbut if you go to someone that's\nattachment based that says i am a task\nspace you have a greater chance of\nthat therapist understanding what i'm\ntalking about\nokay perfect so attachment based therapy\nis the is the in of itself the thing\nthat\nwould be another word relational\ntherapies relationship therapy okay\nwonderful\namazing so essentially i think yeah\nwe're about 25 minutes in now um we in\nsome for those who have been watching\ni've talked about a bit about the\nattachment style we gave an overview um\njust a bit of a background of where that\nmight come from and kind of practical\ntips towards moving\ntowards a secure attachment style so\nthat is essentially what we talked about\nif there are any questions that'd be\nlovely to leave them in the chat and\nthen we can see if we can answer some of\nthem\notherwise i would love to direct some of\nthe psych2go viewers to check out dr\nhonda's very own channel which is linked\nin the description box below\num i'll just give it a few moments see\nif there's any other\nquestions that might come up\notherwise\nwe will definitely see you all next time\nfor the next episode of the ask an\nexpert series\num\nlet's see\nit doesn't look like there's any\nquestions but if any do come up just\nleave them in the comment section below\nand i'll do my best to direct your\nresources direct others to dr honda's\nvery own videos as well\nand yeah\nhope you enjoyed this episode thank you\ndr honda for joining us thank you to the\npsych2goers for watching and hope you\nhave an amazing day yeah thanks for\nhaving me bye"
