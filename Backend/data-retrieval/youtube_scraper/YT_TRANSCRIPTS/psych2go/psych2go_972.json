    "transcript": "[Music]\na key component of depression is feeling\nsignificantly sad and down\nas such if you've been smiling often\nother people may not have suspected that\nyou may be struggling with depression\nand you may not have realized it either\neven if you have been smiling and acting\ncheerful\nhave you also been feeling exhausted\nperhaps from keeping up appearances or\nfrom avoiding your more difficult\nemotions\nit's important to be honest with\nyourself and assess whether or not you\nmay be battling depression so that you\ncan address it sooner and seek proper\nhelp\nhere are five signs you're smiling\nthrough the pain\nnumber one\ndestructive perfectionism\nsome people make the mistake of assuming\nthat because a person appears put\ntogether they are not struggling on the\ninside\nhave you been dressing and grooming\nyourself to perfection\nhave you been pushing yourself hard at\nwork school or at home so that\neverything is pristine and flawless or\nperhaps in order to keep yourself\nsuccessful and accomplished at what you\ndo\nare you doing so to the point of being\nstrung out and worn out from feeling\nunable to allow mistakes\nit's important to consider the\npossibility that you're doing so to seem\nto others that you're on top of your\ngame\nyou may not want them to see how you\nreally feel on the inside\nit's also worth considering whether you\nyourself do not want to accept that you\nare struggling and may be in need of\nhelp\nwhile it may be a bitter pill to swallow\nit's important to remember that this bit\nof vulnerability is an act of true\ncourage that is necessary to overcome\nfor you to start healing and feeling\nbetter\nnumber two belittling your own hardships\nin comparison to others\ni'm fine i don't have it as bad as\nothers\nhave you ever thought this way\nyou might have convinced yourself that\nyou are not depressed by constantly\ntelling yourself that others have it\nworse than you in life and because\nyou're better off you can't or shouldn't\nbe depressed\nit is understandable to develop such a\nmindset as you may have even been told\nthis by other people in your life\nhowever\nto continue to do so would be to\ninvalidate your own feelings and\npersonal experience\nall pain\nis pain\nand people from different walks of life\ncan fall into a depression for different\nreasons no matter what background you're\nfrom depression is a very real and\npainful experience\nnumber three guilt\ncomparing yourself to others goes hand\nin hand with the guilt you may feel from\nbeing sad you may feel guilty that you\ncan't bring yourself to feel happy or\ncontent even though it seems to you like\nyou don't have much to complain about\nyou may also feel guilt from worrying\nabout placing burdens on others you may\nhave noticed that the depression you've\nbeen experiencing has affected those\naround you or you're worried that others\nwill be burdened with the task of having\nto take care of you especially if you're\nused to taking care of others instead\nyou might even feel like you're the one\nto blame for feeling depressed and thus\nshame yourself further into hiding it\nnumber four\ntoxic people around you\npeople are often not the best judge of\nthemselves and it's hard to think very\nclearly when depressed\nwhile it may be difficult for you to\ndetermine if you might be struggling\nwith depression it might be simpler for\nyou to assess whether you are or have\nbeen around people who were toxic to you\nor constantly hurt you\nmaybe your family didn't handle conflict\nwell maybe they handled issues with\nanger or were generally not a safe space\nfor you\nperhaps you're with a partner now who is\nemotionally unsafe to you or possesses\nnarcissistic traits\nyour environment may be a sign that your\nmental health is suffering\nnumber five\nrunning from negative feelings\nyou may not notice how far you've fallen\ninto depression if you've been running\naway from your negative feelings\nyou might feel the need to keep a tight\ngrasp on control and expend a lot of\nenergy worrying that something may\ndisrupt it you may be suppressing your\nfeelings in order to cope with the needs\nof the present and while doing so to a\ncertain extent can help you get through\nthe day\nlocking painful feelings away too\nrigidly can lead you to dismiss the\neffect that your difficult experiences\nhave caused you in the past and in\neffect dismiss and invalidate your own\nfeelings\nif you continue to do so without giving\nyourself a safe space to deal with your\npain and process your emotions\nyou may allow your depressive feelings\nto grow\naccording to the dsm-5 to be diagnosed\nwith depression these symptoms must\ncause clinically significant distress or\nimpairment in your social life work or\nschool or other important aspects of\nlife\nsymptoms can vary in severity and\nfrequency depending on the individual\nyou may experience most of these signs\nor perhaps only a few\nfor these reasons it's important to\nreach out to a professional for a\ncomplete diagnosis if you or anyone you\nknow could be struggling with depression\nplease don't hesitate to reach out to a\nqualified mental health care provider"
