    "transcript": "how old is your mind\nthe way you think\nthis goes beyond what books you've read\nthe years you've lived or the grades you\npull perhaps you've been told that\nyou're wise for your years or the other\nway around where you surprise people by\nunderstanding and learning like someone\nx number of years younger than you it's\none of the few times being markedly\ndifferent is considered a good thing and\nsome people manage to stay closer to\noptimal than others\nare you one of them\nlet's take a look at some ways you can\ntell\nnumber one you have bursts of energy and\nfocus\nyeah we know you can game for hours and\nyour twitch feed is blowing up right now\nbut that's not exactly what we're\ntalking about\nare you able to laser guide your focus\non a task to meet a goal\ndo you notice yourself still excited and\nworking on an objective that others quit\na long time ago despite in the beginning\neveryone saying they wanted the same\nthing\nthis can be a sign of your brain\nremaining flexible and ready to dance\nbeing able to retain that ability to\nassimilate and integrate new knowledge\nvia the same kind of focus and\ndetermination is a sign of intelligence\nnumber two you are aware of and value\nyour time does your relaxation still\ninvolve doing maybe it's not work but\nyou're still doing something\nand if you're forced to just sit and not\nread not talk not think uh\nyeah\nyou feel that hyper awareness of time\nyour time ticking away\nthat splinter in your mind driving you\nmad\nokay i'm kidding sorry you're not likely\nneo but mindless twiddling does bug you\nyou could be reading that article you\nput away for later you could be starting\nthat craft project you could be figuring\nout how to do that thing you could be\ndoing something that is meaningful\npurposeful\nand useful to you\nif you'd rather do that than a mindless\nactivity like blindly scrolling through\nsocial media\nor picking at your fingernails this\ndemonstrates a desire to learn and to\nstimulate your brain which is smart\nnumber three you enjoy learning\nhave you felt dissatisfaction and no\ndesire to participate in activities that\nstay the same the person next to you may\nbe content doing the same unchanging\nthing repeatedly and when you invite\nthem to take a new course with you or\nattend a convention where you can learn\nmore about something\nthey give you a look that says\nbut\nwhy\nbasically there is knowledge out there\nknowledge about that thing you like and\nyou hunger for it\nso you've had a lesson or learned a\nconcept and just like a good snack you\njust can't stop at one\nwe can always improve and our desire to\nclimb higher for ourselves also improves\nthat desire to be smarter\nfeed that need\nnumber four you can think sideways long\nways and always\nhave you gotten a responsive\ni never thought of it that way to a\nsolution or idea you've proffered\nmaybe you gave a creative working\nsolution and even though no one\nresponded you found your solution being\nused anyhow\ndon't worry some people just can't admit\nyou suggested something they hadn't and\nwouldn't have thought of this doesn't\nnegate the fact that you still blew\ntheir mind\nand thought outside the box give\nyourself bonus points for emotional\nintelligence though if they do admit you\nout thought them because you did\nsomething to make them willing to\nswallow their pride if you find yourself\nsurprising others with new perspectives\nideas and solutions especially with a\nwide variety of people you're flexing\nthat critical thinking muscle\nnumber five looking into who someone is\nnot what they look like\ndo you walk yourself back from making a\nsnap judgment of someone maybe you're\nwilling to give them the benefit of the\ndoubt until you've had the chance to\nobserve or know them more\nyou want to see the person behind the\npersona your conversation with them\ndoesn't skirt on the innate but delves\ninto finding out how they think their\nopinions and who they are\nhaving an ability to treat people for\nwho they are on the inside rather than\nhow they look on the outside is a deep\nsign of both kindness and emotional\nintelligence\nand number six your ship of emotions has\nan even keel\nshort version you think and chill before\ntackling a situation\nany situation\nwe mean even if you really just want to\ngive that prickly argumentative person a\ndope slap\nyou don't\nnot worth the assault charges you know\neven when your friend is doing something\nreally unwise you resist the urge to\nblurt out don't get carried away are you\neven thinking\nno\nno\nyou\ntake a good oxygen to the brain breath\nand think about how best to help and not\nharm\nyou consider how your words would affect\nthem so you put some thought into\nphrasing it as best as possible instead\nof whipping back with a curt verbal slap\nnaturally you need to feel what you feel\nthat's the human condition\nwhat's smart though is when you find\nways to deal with your feelings to the\nbenefit of everyone rather than\ndepending on reflex and impulse\nside note of reassurance occasionally no\nmatter how well you phrase something and\nhow thoroughly you've thought out an\naction\nsome people will still obstinately\nrefuse to be decent\nthat's on them not on you please don't\nstress\nyou're good you did your thing\ndo you feel smarter or better about your\nsmarts perhaps you've recognized one of\nthese points and now realize hey that's\na good thing\nperhaps you recognize these traits in\nsomeone else and you can now either have\nthem watch this video or give them some\ncomplimentary recognition and make their\nday feel free to share discuss feel good\nand feel smart and we know that you know\nanother smart thing is to like us and\nmaybe watch another one of our videos\nsee you soon"
