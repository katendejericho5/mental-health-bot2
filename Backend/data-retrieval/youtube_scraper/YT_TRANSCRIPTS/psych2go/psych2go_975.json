But talking too much?\nSurprisingly this habit can be a sign too.\nAnxious people often talk more\nto fill the perceived silence.\nThey wanna add value and avoid awkwardness\nbut it often stems from a place\nof nervousness and insecurity\nrather than authenticity\nand general inquiry.\nClosing thoughts:\nThere is no shame in having anxiety.\nThe important thing is that\nyou recognize the habits\nso you can learn from them and grow.\nDo you relate to any of the signs above?\nDo you have any more signs\nthat you think would fit this description?\nIf so, share them in the comments below\nand remember to like and share this video\nwith people who could benefit.\nAs always, the references\nand studies are listed\nin the description.\nUntil next time friends.\nThanks for watching."
