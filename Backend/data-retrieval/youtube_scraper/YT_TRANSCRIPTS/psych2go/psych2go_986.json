    "transcript": "hey sectagors how are you all doing\ngood\nno\nwell from the title of this video i wish\nsome of you are going to say you haven't\nbeen feeling your best lately\nyou've perhaps been feeling depressed\nrecently and aren't quite sure why or\nyou're just not in a good mood lately\nmaybe you have a hunch as to why or\nmaybe you think it's a few little things\nhere and there\nwe all have our reasons but do you know\nthere are some weird little things that\ncan change your mood for the worse\nfor example how can cat videos cause you\nto feel sad or leaving your sunglasses\nat home on a sunny day\nweird things can affect your mood\nthese small things could just be making\nyou feel a bit down lately so here's why\nnumber one\nyou're around blue light before bed\ndo you get on your tablet or a phone\nright before bed\ndo you let the calming meows if cat\nvideos put you to sleep\nwell\nthat's enough no more cat videos\nactually it's not the cats that are bad\nfor you but the blue light emitted from\nyour screen that could be\never heard of our circadian rhythm\nit's the internal clock we all have that\ninfluences how alert we are our\nmelatonin secretion and cortisol it\naffects our behavior and changes within\na 24-hour cycle so blue light slows the\nrelease of melatonin and messes up your\ncircadian rhythm\nthis can make it much more difficult to\nfall asleep because our brain releases\nmore melatonin before bed during the\ndark hours of the evening so using your\nphone computer or watching tv can cause\nyou to have difficulty falling asleep\naccording to webmd poor sleep is linked\nto health problems like high blood\npressure obesity depression type 2\ndiabetes heart disease and even some\nkinds of cancer\ncircadian rhythms have also been known\nto affect someone's limbic system this\npart of the brain establishes emotional\nstates and responses\nso poor sleep can negatively affect our\nmood in this way as well\nthe good news is most phones have a\nnight mode option that reduces the blue\nlight and goes for more of an orange\ntint\nbut some experts say this might not be\nenough\nso it's best to opt for a good book\ninstead of those cute blue light kittens\nfrom your phone screen number two you're\nnot getting enough sunlight\ndo you get enough sunlight or do you\nspend most of your days indoors\nyou may say to yourself but i'm away\nfrom that blue light i don't watch tv\nvideos or play games that often well\ncongrats but not entirely because even\nthough blue light isn't always your\nfriend natural sunlight is\nour circadian rhythm can still get\ndisrupted without enough sunlight the\nless you receive the more your body\nreleases hormones that will make you\nfeel lethargic\nyou want to feel sleepy at night not\nduring the day\npeople often experience seasonal\naffective disorder because of the lack\nof sunlight during the shorter and\ndarker days of the year what does this\nmean\nlikely more feelings of tiredness and\nloss of interest in the things you once\nenjoyed so when spring and summer comes\naround they'll usually feel a lot better\nbecause of that good old sunlight number\nthree you're scrolling through social\nmedia too often\nhow often do you scroll through your\nsocial media feed per day\n30 minutes an hour two four\nwell this could have you comparing those\nperfectly staged or post photos of your\nfriends to yourself in reality and\npeople in reality aren't always seen at\ntheir best angle\nin an article for men's health\npsychologist c matthew nichols phd\nsuggests this is due to often viewing\nimpression management images these are\nphotos that are set up to be in perfect\nlighting situations and poses so that\neveryone looks their best\nalso people tend to use filters every\nnow and then too so it might leave you\ncomparing yourself to impossible\nstandards which can take a toll on your\nmood number four you're experiencing\nsituational depression\nhas a tragedy or unfortunate event\nrecently occurred in your life\ndo you think you're experiencing\nsituational depression a lot of people\ngo through situational depression at\nleast once in their lives this can occur\nwhen there's a divorce or breakup\na loss of someone in your life loss of a\njob fights with family or loved ones\nretirement having a baby accidents\nmoving if you're not used to feeling\ndepressed\nthese feelings that come with\nsituational depression can be extremely\nnew to you\nsome symptoms of situational depression\nare low self-esteem feeling hopeless sad\ntearful irritable having no motivation\nlosing interest in things and having\ntrouble making decisions to name just a\nfew\nit's best to seek professional help or\nconsult with a doctor if these\ndepressive feelings or symptoms persist\nand number five you're in the sun\nwithout sunglasses\nhere's a weird cause have you been out\nin the sun all day and find yourself in\na constant frown but then that frown\ngets to you you suddenly find yourself\nangry upset or sad\nmaybe you're just not feeling it today\nwell did you forget your sunglasses\nwhile there are a lot of things that can\ncause you to feel sad a weird one is\nsimply not wearing sunglasses while out\non a sunny day\nthat intense sun often forces one to\nsquint their eyes and face and be locked\nin a frown for the duration of their\ntime outside this can actually cause\nfeelings of aggression or anger to occur\nif you hold this facial expression\naccording to a 2013 research study\npublished in the journal cognition and\nemotion the study states in line with\ndata showing that experimental and\nunobtrusively induced facial and body\ndisplays facilitate congruent feelings\nwe found that participants walking\nagainst the sun without sunglasses\nscored higher in a self-report measure\nof anger and aggression compared to\nthose walking with the sun behind and or\nwearing sunglasses\nso for those weird days where you're\njust feeling a bit out of the mood than\nusual\nit's best to perhaps bring those\nsunglasses and smile in the mirror each\nmorning\ndoes that actually work i heard it works\nmaybe not for everybody but hey some\ndays it's worth a shot\nso do you think something weird is\ncausing you to feel sad lately feel free\nto share with us how you're feeling in\nthe comments
