    "transcript": "our conceptions of Love are bound to\nchange over time with traditions and\ncultures shifting our conception of Love\nis bound to change as well but with\nsocial media entering the equation our\nconceptions radically change more often\nand not always for the best with the\noverload of information we can get in\nthe age of the internet our conception\nof love has become messed up let's look\nat some of the ways things have changed\nand increase our chances of finding and\nkeeping a genuine loving relationship\npassive or active as we learn about what\nthe people we're attracted to like we\ntend to craft ourselves into what we\nthink they'll desire for example there\nwas a lot of hype around gamer girls\nyoung men and teens would desire a gamer\ngirl without any regard for who the girl\nis as a person as a result some girls\ngot into gaming just to apply this label\nto themselves that isn't to say they\ndidn't enjoy games or that it was all\nfictitious but the original interest was\nspurred on on by the desire to have an\nattractive label men have begun to\nunderstand that being softer gentler and\nMore in touch with their emotions has\nbecome more desirable to women and as a\nresult the typical man holds attitudes\nthat are different and in some ways\ncontradictory to what men from 10 years\nago would have this isn't to say that\nthe changes aren't welcome but in our\npersonal lives we have to understand\nthat this is merely a way of casting a\nwide net we are making ourselves as\nlovable as possible for a broad group of\npeople instead our focus should be more\nactive we should find someone who suits\nus as individuals the method of being as\nattractive to as many people as possible\nhas also been gamified by dating apps\nthat get us invested in a number going\nup instead of focusing on being loved we\nneed to focus on the love we give we\ncan't expect love to just come to us\nsuddenly we have to be searching for it\nin\nindividuals Love Takes\npractice the new expectation around love\nis that our partner should automatically\nknow how to love us we've established\nthat we have a role to play in seeking\nlove if we want real long- lasting love\nwe have to practice if you want to be\ngood at something you don't just\nimmediately give up you put in the time\nyou learn from your mistakes and you\nkeep trying if you really love someone\nyou have to show it putting in the\neffort is what gives the result value if\nwe put no effort or practice into it\nwhat's the point if everything is\nautomatically good why isn't love so\nmuch easier relationships depend on the\neffort and dedication of both parties\nfrom the beginning to the very end of\ncourse this shouldn't be a justification\nfor abuse or an actual lack of\nAttraction but don't give up if your\npartner doesn't do everything exactly as\nyou want it from the very beginning\nexplore and figure things out keep\ntrying and the strength of your love\nwill only grow using social media\nkeywords to Define our relationships if\nyou have relationship videos on your for\nyou page or in your Instagram algorithm\nyou have almost certainly heard terms\nlike red flags Love Languages and if he\nwanted to he would the intentions around\nthese phrases are usually good with\npeople sharing what has worked for them\nand straightened their relationship as\nthese terms spread the original\nintention gets lost anything can be a\nred flag or give you the ick love\nlanguage have become separated from\ntheir original foundations in Psychology\nit wouldn't be a stretch to see someone\nsay getting coffee together is my love\nlanguage the danger of this is that we\nopen ourselves to comparison we start\nbelieving that the red flags and Xs are\nUniversal and we run the risk of taking\nour own context out of the equation for\nexample if he wanted to he would sounds\ncompletely fair and of course it holds\nsome value but if we fail to apply our\nown context it becomes dangerous you\nhave to ask yourself what is reasonable\nif you would do the same whether you\nwant to or not and if what you want from\nhim is something you genuinely want or\nif it just looks cute and trendy love\nhas to fit into a consumerist\nsociety we have to find the time to\ncultivate love practice love and perfect\nlove all while trying to succeed and\ngrow our careers social media will make\nus think that the value of our love is\nbased on the value of the actual\nmaterial Goods we can provide or be\nprovided the Norms of Love have always\nbeen dependent on culture in a\nconsumerist culture the value of Love\nbecomes dependent on Trends spending\nmoney on each other becomes the default\nmethod of showing love rather than\nsharing the things that make you you so\nwhat are the solutions there isn't a\nspecific way that love is supposed to\nwork but we're missing the point listen\nto your own red flags not the red flags\nof someone who has never met you or your\npartner it's okay to have gifts as your\nlove language but don't let the value of\nyour relationship be entirely dependent\non how much your partner spends on you\nunderstand your partner and your\nrelationship intimately don't just\nfollow the advice of anybody you should\nknow what can and can't be applied to\nyour relationship communicating without\nthe buffer of social media can help you\nsolve many of these new struggles and\npull your conception of love back into\nreality how do you do you think the\nconception of Love Has Changed do you\nthink it's really messed up or do you\nbelieve technology has been beneficial\nto our conception of Love let us know in\nthe comments below for more videos like\nthis subscribe tosy to go and
