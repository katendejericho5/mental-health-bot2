bruises but\nwhat about the kind that leaves\ninvisible scars\nchildhood emotional neglect is a type of\nabuse where the child is ignored not\ntaken seriously\ntold their feelings don't matter and\ntreat it like they're not even there\nthis can be a difficult and devastating\nexperience and it can affect the way you\nsee yourself in others ruin your\nrelationships and even impact your\nemotional and physical health to learn\nmore about this here are five signs\nyou've been emotionally neglected in\nchildhood\n[Music]\nnumber one you have trouble\nunderstanding your emotions\nif your feelings were ignored as a child\nyou never would have learned how to feel\nand express them in a healthy way\ninstead of talking and supporting you\nyour parents may have ignored you or\ntold you that it's not a big deal as a\nresult you may now find it hard to\nrecognize the emotions you feel let\nalone express them to others a research\narticle from 2013 even found that

the baseline for the\ntypes of relationships you form in\nchildhood the time spent with your\nparents is the time when you learn how\nto converse express your emotions and\nopinions\nand have fun with others\nso if you experienced neglect your\nopportunity to learn how to socialize\nbecame neglected as well a 2019 study\nshowed that growing up without a\nsensitive and responsive caregiver who\nprovides emotional support and security\nhas negative effects on social\nfunctioning this means as an adult you\nmay have become afraid of people and\nwill try your best to avoid social\ngatherings in general\nmaybe you feel like you don't know what\nto do or say or you're simply afraid\nthat you're going to be rejected by\nothers just like you used to be when you\nwere a kid\nnumber three\nyou have low self-worth\nas a child you are completely dependent\non your parents they're here to teach\nyou not only about the world but also\nabout yourself in this way you end up\ninternalizing your parents ideas and\nvalues and making them your own so when\nyour parents neglect and ignore you\nthey're sending you a message that you\ndon't matter\nthis is where your self-image and\nself-esteem may have been damaged and as\nyou grow older you end up carrying these\nfeelings with you as you go through life\nas an adult you may neglect taking care\nof yourself due to feelings of\ninadequacy and feeling like you're not\ngood enough for those around you\nnumber four you're trying to please\neveryone\nchildren who grew up in emotionally\nneglected households often had to pay\nattention to their parents emotions\ninstead of their own if you had to\nconstantly make sure to never upset or\nanger your parents you may have grown up\nto become a people pleaser\nthis can mean being afraid of rejection\nor abandonment being preoccupied with\nwhat others think and feel and becoming\nfearful of saying no because you don't\nwant to appear mean or to hurt others\nfeelings but this can take a toll on\nyour mental health leaving you stuck in\nrelationships where you give more than\nyou take\noverworked because you've taken on too\nmuch responsibility\nor becoming exhausted and burned out\nfrom trying to take care of everyone\nelse and number five\nyou feel unexplained resentment towards\nyour parents\nsometimes parents are not intentionally\nneglectful they may provide a roof above\nyour head access to education and food\non your table\nbut as much as they're able to provide\nyou with all the material things you\nneed they may have forgotten that you\nneed love as well\nas a result when you grow up you may\nfeel unexplained anger or resentment\ntowards them maybe you avoid them or\nnever visit them\nyou may even become confused as to why\nyou feel the way you feel\nafter all you can't say they deprived\nyou of basic human needs or abused you\nbut even if you didn't recognize the\nemotional neglect they put you through\nyou may have felt it you knew something\nwas missing and you still feel it today\neven if you're not sure how to explain\nit\nso did you recognize yourself in some of\nthese signs\nif so know
