    "transcript": "the secret to emotional equilibration is\nto maintain constant vigilance over the\ncontents of your Consciousness behind\nevery feeling is a thought and certain\nthoughts will predictably lead to\ncertain emotional states if you're able\nto root out those thoughts while they're\nstill small they won't have a chance to\nflues into emotions which means that you\nwon't have to cope with them emotionally\nwhich is generally more time consuming\npainful and expensive better to rip them\nout while they're still small and the\nway to do this is through the block and\nreplace technique you become aware of\nthe thought I shouldn't have toing deal\nwith this well who says like where the f\nis that written why shouldn't you have\nto deal with this since you're\napparently dealing with a woman who\nhasn't entirely clarified her own\ncommunication and you're dealing with\nyourself who has yet to cultivate\nsufficient patience to withstand her\nprovocations expecting reality to be\nother than it is is just asking to be\ndisappointed and frustrated but whose\nfault is that do you understand what I'm\nsaying this is harsh but it's effective"
