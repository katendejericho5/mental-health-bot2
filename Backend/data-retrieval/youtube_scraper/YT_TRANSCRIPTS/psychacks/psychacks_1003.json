    "transcript": "in my recent video what is the sexual\nmarketplace maria elena comments this\nisn't the 18th century\nresponding i assume to my depiction of\nthe traditional role of women down at\nthe docks absolutely last i checked it's\nthe 21st century and in point of fact\nwomen have many more options down at the\nsexual marketplace these days and they\nhave many more good options than men do\ncurrently in the sexual marketplace but\nyou know i can't get them all into a\nsingle three-minute video\ni will definitely return to the topic of\nthe sexual marketplace in the future\nbut what\nis abiding in my depiction of the sexual\nmarketplace is that those 17th century\noptions for women\nstill are options for 21st century women\nthey're just no longer their exclusive\noptions it's an option among options so\ni highlighted this because it seems to\nbe what is most generally true over time\nand across cultures"
