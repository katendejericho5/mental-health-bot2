    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nyou gotta feel it to heal it\nthis is a therapy saying you gotta feel\nit to heal it so what's this all about\ni first heard this phrase when i was\nworking in the context of addiction\ndrugs and alcohol are emotional numbing\nagents\navoiding unpleasant emotions is one of\nthe primary reasons people use\nsubstances of all kinds\nthe issue is not that drugs and alcohol\ndon't work in this respect but rather\nthey kind of work too well\nit's almost like the introduction of the\nsubstance\nfreezes a person's emotional maturation\nat a given point in time\nthe person will continue to mature\nbiologically chronologically\nbut they're emotionally frozen at the\npoint in life when the drug or alcohol\nwas initially or heavily used\nanyone who has had a relationship with\nan alcohol or drug addict will attest to\nthis they may be dealing with somebody\nwho's 40 50 60 years old but who has the\nemotional maturity of an eight or twelve\nyear old which is when they started\nusing or drinking\nso\nwhat happens when addicts make the\ndecision to abstain from their drug of\nchoice\nwell it's not like they haven't had\nemotional experiences over the last\nseveral years or the last several\ndecades\nthey just haven't processed them\nthe drug or alcohol has allowed them to\navoid dealing with that dimension of\nlife\nin all but a superficial manner\nthese emotions are like frozen somewhere\nbeneath the threshold of awareness for\nquite some time\nabstaining from the drug of choice\ncauses the emotions to begin to thaw\nand this can be a really uncomfortable\ntime for recovering addicts to pass\nthrough\nas they suddenly begin to experience\nextremely intense apparently spontaneous\nemotions\nthese emotions were triggered by events\nthat happened a long time ago in a place\nfar away but they haven't yet been\nappropriately processed\nand see since these emotions don't seem\nto square with what's going on in the\nhere and now this can be a crazy making\nexperience\nthese folks feel like they're on an\nemotional roller coaster and they don't\nreally understand where the hits are\ncoming from and the hits are coming hard\nand fast\nwhat i tell folks who are passing\nthrough this moment to consider is that\nthe feeling\nis the experience of the emotion\nleaving the body\nit's not entirely scientific but it does\nseem to have some psychological truth to\nit\nyou experience feelings as emotions\nleave\nand when you're done feeling\nyou find that the emotion is gone\nso this feeling is actually an essential\nstep in the recovery process it's the\nexperience of those long frozen emotions\nleaving the body\nand this can be a useful image for\naddicts or for any folks passing through\nan emotionally difficult moment\nwith every feeling you experience you're\npotentially reducing the emotional debt\nthat you have yet to pass through\nand there's really no other way to pay\nthis outstanding balance you've got to\nfeel it to heal it\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations and\nconsultations thanks for listening"
