    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\ndon't be the last guy to leave the party\nso this is a message that is\nspecifically addressed to the\n20-somethings in the audience\nthe 20s and in particular your early to\nmid 20s or a really interesting time in\nyour life because it's probably the\nchapter of your life that will be most\ndominated by your friendships\nin many respects it's still a\ncontinuation of college your peers and\nyour friends play such an enormous and\nrewarding role in your life and most of\nyour socializing is done in your friend\ngroup there's a lot of going out there's\na lot of partying and that's all well\nand good there's nothing wrong with that\nit's important to understand however\nthat this doesn't last forever\nwhen you get to around 28\nover the next five years from 28 to 33\nyour friend group will start to fall\napart\nthis is usually not due to falling outs\nof any kind if anything everyone still\nfeels as positively about their friends\nas ever\nit's just that other parts of life\nslowly become more important\none person decides to go back to law\nschool\nanother person moves away for a better\njob opportunity yet another person gets\ninto a serious relationship and starts\nhaving kids\nfor better or worse people begin to\nprioritize other aspects of their lives\nabove their friendships\nso why am i talking about this\nhave you ever been to a house party\nit's a lot of fun the music is playing\nthe drinks are flowing and everyone's\nhaving a good time\nbut then around a certain point of the\nevening\npeople begin to make their exit\nin the beginning it's just a person here\nor there then it's a few couples\nand then there's this mass exodus and\nlike within the space of 20 or 30\nminutes the party just dies almost\neveryone clears out\nnow\nmaybe you are having a fantastic time\nand you're not ready for the night to\nend\nhave you ever\nnot left with that mass exodus\nhave you ever had the experience of\nbeing the last guy or gal\nat the party\nchances are you have and chances are it\nwasn't a pleasant one the music is now\nuncomfortably loud maybe someone's\npassed out in the corner there's vomit\non the couch and the bathroom's a mess\nand then the sadness sets in\nit's generally not a good experience to\nbe the last person to leave the party\nand that's because nothing good happens\nafter a certain point in the night you\nunderstand\nnow this piece of advice is useful for\nany given saturday night but it's also\nuseful in the context of your 20s as a\nwhole\nso we can generalize the scope of this\npiece of advice like i said the first\nhalf of your 20s will be dominated by\nyour friends and fun\nbut then some people are going to get\nmarried and some people are going to get\nserious about their careers and some\npeople are going to suffer death and\nloss\nand then there's going to be this mass\nexodus\nyou don't want to be the last person to\nleave the party\nyou don't want to be the 33 year old\nwho's still trying to get high and\nwasted with his friends on the weekend\nat that point your friends are gonna\nhave other things to do and frankly so\nshould you\nso enjoy your time while you can\nbut leave while the getting is still\ngood hopefully that makes sense\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations and\nconsultations\nthanks for listening"
