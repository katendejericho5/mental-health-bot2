    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\ndeal with\nperfectionism so I consider myself to be\na perfectionist in recovery I definitely\nsuccumb to the Trap of perfectionism\nwhen I was younger and I am no longer a\nperfectionist today so I'm going to talk\na little bit about some of the\nrealizations that I had in my own\npersonal life that helped me move from\npoint A to point B because this is\nsomething that I see people with every\nsingle week perfectionism is exhausting\ndebilitating and painful while we can't\ndispense with it entirely as there are\nsome instances in which perfectionism is\ncalled for computer programming brain\nsurgery it is generally not an\nappropriate mode for Human Action rather\nwe kind of want to be satisficing the\nvast majority of the time and optimizing\nonly when necessary actually one helpful\nintervention is just to imagine that\nthere is like a switch in your mind that\nyou can access in order to intentionally\ntoggle between these two states like you\ncan create that switch and that should\nallow you to begin to have some measure\nof control over the problem so let's\ntalk about my personal journey to\novercome perfectionism the first company\nI founded was a private Tutoring company\nit was really just me but I gave it a\nname and I worked with many different\nstudents on a variety of subjects across\nNew York City the motto of my company\nwas excellence in all things and it was\nmy personal goal to show my commitment\nto Excellence in every little thing that\nI did no matter how small or\ninsignificant in fact the smaller the\ndetail the greater the opportunity to\ndemonstrate my commitment now this is\ngoing to sound very silly now but one\nway that I thought to show my commitment\nto Excellence at the time was through my\ninvoicing\nevery month I would go to the stationary\nstore and buy this fancy parchment and I\nwould handwrite all of my invoices with\na pen and an ink well before I would\ndeliver them to my clients in order to\nget\npaid I thought that helped to impart the\nupscale Boutique personal vibe that I\nwas going for now writing these invoices\nwas expensive and it was timec consuming\nbut at least to my mind it showed my\ncommitment to what I believed in\nnow I did that and many many other\nthings for a while before I started to\nrealize a few things about my\nperfectionism in the first place I\nincreasingly understood that my motto\nwas a lie I certainly was not excellent\nin all things in fact I might only have\nbeen decent in a few things at best and\nrather unremarkable in the vast majority\nof things like I couldn't fix a toaster\nor speak speak Arabic or ride a unicycle\nor hit a target with a bow at 100 yard\nor cook a sule or etc etc etc if I was\nbeing honest I could really only do one\nor two things better than most people\nand yet I was able to maintain this\nillusion about excellence in all things\nfor quite some time how is that\npossible when I examined this question I\nrealized that it was possible because I\nsort of minimized the value of all those\nother things I wasn't good at like those\nthings were beneath me or they didn't\nreally matter or they weren't truly\nimportant and I would form negative\njudgments about the people who did excel\nin those fields they were just just dumb\njocks or superficial idiots Etc and this\nwas all in the service of protecting my\nrather fragile view of reality like I\ncould be excellent in all things as long\nas most things didn't matter so they\nkind of didn't count right and I've seen\nthe same thing in nearly every case of\nperfectionism that I've worked with it\nrequires a very selective attention to\nmaintain to prop up the illusion\nperfectionists kind of have to willfully\nnot look at all the things they can't do\nvery well and this is made easier\nthrough the denigration and criticism of\nthose things\nafter all if they truly were important\nand meaningful and perfectionists\nweren't perfect at them then what kind\nof cognitive dissonance do you think\nthat would create so that was the first\ncrack in the facade of my\nperfectionism now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending

fill out\nan inquiry form on my website if you're\ninterested in booking a paid\nconsultation links to everything in the\ndescription let's get back to it now the\nsecond crack in my perfectionism had to\ndo with the realization that I was\nemotionally identified with the products\nof my perfectionism in my mind the\ninvoice wasn't just a piece of paper it\nwas a reflection of my core values and\nan extension of myself and that of\ncourse is why I put so much time and\nattention into the invoicing because I\nbelieved that other people would somehow\nbe able to see me through that piece of\npaper it would attest to my value and\nworth and I think I did this because I\nwas still a young man at 20 years old\nthis was my first business and I was was\nabsolutely still developing my personal\nand professional identities and despite\nthe fact that this was entirely\nappropriate given my stage of life I was\nalso profoundly embarrassed by my own\ninexperience and\nincompetence as such I was\novercompensating as a means of avoiding\ncontact with those emotional experiences\non some level I believe that I needed to\nprovide my clients with even more value\nthan they hired me to deliver in order\nto offset the liability associated with\nhiring me in the first place so I felt\nthe need to go above and beyond often in\nrespects that didn't really have to do\nwith my job per se in order to make up\nfor the fact that I didn't feel\nexceptional at my actual job these\nadditional efforts were kind of a crutch\nto bolster my professional\nidentity Over time however this crutch\nbecame increasingly unnecessary after\nthousands thousands of hours I got\nbetter at running a business and I got\nbetter at working with students I was\nable to see more and more that the\ninvoice wasn't actually a reflection of\nmyself it was just a piece of paper and\na rather expensive and inconvenient\npiece of paper at that and this was\nincredibly liberating I talk about this\na bit in my episode how to be\nindestructible we become vulnerable and\nexposed when we allow ourselves to\nidentify with things that are not\nourselves through narcissistic extension\nit's a better idea to identify only with\nyourself and to make the surface area of\nyour ego very small as this will allow\nyou to navigate life more peacefully and\nwithout unnecessary\nfriction and then one day after years of\nthis I made the conscious decision not\nto provide my clients with handwritten\ninvoices anymore and\nI was actually pretty nervous about this\ndecision after training my clients to\nexpect these invoices I was worried that\nthey would see my choice not to provide\nthem as a downgrade in the quality of my\nservices that they would think that they\nare paying more for less and you know\nwhat it turned out that nobody cared\nlike literally not a single client even\nmentioned anything about not receiving\nthe invoices anymore it turns out they\njust needed to know how much to make the\ncheckout for and that information could\neasily be communicated in other ways\nnobody cared nobody noticed it was all\nin my\nhead every month I was spending a couple\nhours of my life creating these invoices\nthis was expensive not only in terms of\nthe stationary but also in terms of the\nopportunity cost I could be doing\nliterally anything else with my life\nincluding using that time to make more\nmoney to increase the value of those\ninvoices and this experience opened my\neyes to the fact that different actions\npossess radically disproportionate\nvalues and that it's the other person\nwho decides ultimately what those values\nare remember the cat decides what milk\nis good all too often we believe that we\ncan kind of make that decision for the\ncat and it doesn't work that way however\nthrough careful observation you can get\nbetter at ice in the behaviors that are\ntruly important to the cat irrespective\nof your own opinions you can then\noptimize those behaviors and satisfies\nthe others and this will allow you to\nbecome much more effective and much more\nefficient in delivering value which in\nturn will allow you to deliver a lot\nmore value to a lot more people\naccelerating your growth both as a\nbusiness person and as a human being\nhopefully that made sense what do you\nthink does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the
