    "transcript": "in the comments section of my recent\nepisode what men and women look for in\nsexual partners numerous people\nsuggested that i was wrong in my\nassessment\nindicating that women actually want\neverything they want the sexy body and\nthey want the lifestyle as well and i'm\nhere to tell you that yeah okay\nif they can get it i mean if this is\ntrue of men and women\nuh they if they can get everything that\nthey want they're gonna take it the fact\nof the matter is that we can't always\nget what we want and when we realize\nthat we can't always get what we want we\nalso realize that the things that we\nwant aren't equally important to us and\nthat there's a sort of rank ordered\npriority to the factors that we're\nlooking for in a partner\nand in general\nif a woman can't get what she wants she\nis more willing and likely to sacrifice\nphysical attraction\nfor\nlifestyle opportunity"
