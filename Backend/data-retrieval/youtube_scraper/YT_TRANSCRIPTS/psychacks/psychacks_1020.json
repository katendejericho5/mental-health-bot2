    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nwhy bad habits persist\nlet's get right to it\nbad habits persist\nbecause vices are a form of amnesia\namnesia is a memory disorder it's when\nsomebody has issues recognizing or\nrecollecting things that he's previously\nlearned and at their core all vices are\namnestic disorders\nwhat do i mean by that\nwell vices generally create short-term\nbenefit at long-term expense for\ninstance advice could be\novereating in the short term overeating\ncreates some short-term benefits like\nsatiaty blood sugar rushes emotional\navoidance\nat long-term expense like obesity health\ncomplications and shame spirals\nvices create pain in the long run almost\nby definition and they generally create\npain consistently and predictably and\nthe people who suffer from these vices\nwill typically admit as much themselves\nbut what happens within the subjective\nexperience of a person who possesses a\ndisposition to a certain vice when he is\nconfronted with the possibility of\nenacting that behavior when he\nexperiences a craving to act in a\ncertain way\nin that moment he doesn't remember\nall the pain that has consistently\nresulted from that action in the past\ninstead he thinks\nthat this time\nit will be different\nthis time i'll be able to stop eating\nwhen i when i feel full which has not\nbeen the case at all in the past or this\ntime i'm celebrating a special occasion\nand so i don't really know how i'm going\nto respond in this situation which is\nwillful denial\nvices persist through this kind of\neveryday amnesia\nnow the alternative to amnesia is\nremembering\ninterestingly remembering is one of the\ndefinitions of the original pali word\nfrom which we derive the term\nmindfulness so the antithesis of amnesia\nis\nmindfulness\nas sigmund freud said we can either\nremember\nor we can repeat\nin this case it's the work of the person\nwith a disposition toward a certain vice\nto remember the harvest he has\nconsistently reaped from this behavior\nin the past when he suffers a craving at\na decisional choice point\nor it's his fate to repeat that behavior\nover and over again until he does\nwhen confronted with the impulse to\nrepeat a vice\nit's helpful to play the tape forward\ndon't just stop at the short-term\nbenefit the pleasure or satisfaction\nthat attends relenting to the craving\nkeep playing the tape of memory forward\nto review the shame of relapse and the\npain of long-term consequences in the\ncase of overeating this could mean\nremembering the cycle of\nself-recrimination and compensation\nor the amount of exercise or dieting\nthat will be needed to work off the meal\nthis actually produces a fuller picture\nof that behavior remembering past the\npoint of pleasure to consider how that\npleasure consistently and predictably\ntransforms into pain\nis one of the best ways of combating the\namnesia that keeps folks enslaved to bad\nhabits\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations and\nconsultations\nthanks for listening"
