    "transcript": "in my recent episode the fear of\ncommitment dorogaya Moya asks what\ntraits are considered as a significant\nImprovement to a man's life well that's\nvery hard to answer in the general\nbecause men differ from Individual to\nindividual however I will say that the\ntraits that are most important\nfor a specific man are complementary\ntraits\na man isn't looking to be reflected in\nwhat he already has to offer he's\ninterested in Shoring up\nweaknesses or liabilities with the woman\nthat he brings into his life\nfor example if a man is already making\nin the high six figures he's probably\nnot going to sort for a woman who's also\nmaking six figures it's like how much\nmoney do they really need so that's not\nadding much significant additional value\nto a man in that state that man will\nprobably be filtering for more\ncomplementary assets and traits"
