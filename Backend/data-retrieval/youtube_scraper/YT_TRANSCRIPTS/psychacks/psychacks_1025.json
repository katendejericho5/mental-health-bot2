    "transcript": "in my recent episode the fear of\ncommitment cece soy comments sometimes\nyou offer anything and everything\nit is still not good enough well that's\nactually true\nbut\nwhat i'm getting at here is that\nvalue is more about quality than\nquantity\nimagine you're at a restaurant you ask\nthe waiter for a refill on your water\nand he pours and pours and pours from\nhis pitcher until the cup is full\nand he keeps pouring and the water\nstarts spilling over the cup and onto\nthe table\nyou actually didn't want\neverything and anything that the waiter\nhad to offer you want you wanted enough\nto fill your cup and anything above that\nwas actually\nnot only superfluous\nbut\ndistasteful now there's water everywhere\nand you're wet and\nit's not pleasant so\nit's about\nquality and appropriate quantity it's\nnot necessary to offer everything to\npeople"
