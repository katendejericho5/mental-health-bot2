    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\ndating hunting\nversus fishing\nall right so this is going to be an\nintroductory talk that will probably\nrequire a few follow-up videos basically\nthere are two ways to date you can hunt\nor you can fish\nand it's important for men and women to\nbe able to do both however\nthe general rule of thumb is that the\nhigher your sexual marketplace value\nthe more hunting is a viable selection\nstrategy for you\nand the lower your sexual marketplace\nvalue\nthe more you'll have to rely on fishing\nas a selection strategy now you can get\nlots of good food from fishing so it's\nnot like hunting is necessarily better\nthan fishing it just requires a\ndifferent set of skills if you try to\nfish like you hunt or vice versa you're\nnot going to have a lot of success so\nwhat's the difference\nin hunting you target one particular\nprey\nlike when the lioness goes hunting there\nis one particular gazelle that she\nzeroes in on in the herd it could be any\ngazelle but there is always one\nparticular gazelle that is targeted as\nprey\ntranslated into a dating strategy\nhunting signals at a particular target\nbefore the initial approach\na hunter says i have you in my sights\nand i'm gonna get you i don't want\nanybody else i want you\nthat's hunting\nfishing\non the other hand is putting a net in\nthe water and bringing up lots of\noptions\nwhen you go fishing you don't target a\nparticular fish you don't say i want to\ncatch that fish you put a line or even\nbetter a net in the water and see what\nbites\nsome of the fish you pull up are going\nto be too small others are going to be\ntoo stinky and some might not even be\nfish at all you see what i'm saying but\nfrom among that hall you get to choose\nthe best looking\ntastiest options that you were able to\npull out the water you choose the best\nfrom among what you were able to catch\nin hunting\nyou go after what you want\nand hope\nthey want you back in fishing\nyou choose who you want\nfrom among those who already want you\nmakes sense\ni'll talk more about how to do both in\nfuture episodes\nwhat do you think please like comment\nand subscribe for the algorithm and see\nthe about tab for more information on\ndonations and consultations thanks for\nlistening"
