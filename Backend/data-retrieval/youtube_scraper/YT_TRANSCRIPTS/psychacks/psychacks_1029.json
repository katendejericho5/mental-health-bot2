    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nwhat men and women look for\nin sexual partners\nlook men and women want different things\nand one of the primary fallacies that\nboth men and women operate under in the\nmodern dating scene is believing that\nwhat they want is also attractive to the\nopposite sex\nand so they signal the kinds of things\nthat they themselves would find\nattractive in the opposite sex and it\ngenerally doesn't work\nnow i'm going to paint with some very\nbroad strokes here but i hope to be able\nto demonstrate that there is some truth\nto these stereotypes how i usually\nexplain it is like this\nmen\nwant the barbie doll\nwomen want all the stuff the ken doll\ncomes with\nunderstand\nnow these preferences can obviously go\nto a pretty dark place if taken to the\nextreme in either direction\nand i actually think that this is one of\nthe proofs of the truth of that\nstatement because we can see how these\nextremes align neatly with the\ncomplaints that men and women most\ncommonly have about each other for\ninstance women complain that men just\ntreat women like sex dolls like sex\nobjects\nthey don't care about her personality or\ninterests or feelings they just want to\nuse her body\non the other hand men complain that\nwomen exploit their resources they're\nhappy to accept gifts and drinks and\ndinners and assistance of all kinds but\nthey always seem to have a headache at\nbedtime\nwhat's interesting is that it's never\nthe other way around and and that's how\nwe know there's some truth\nto what i'm saying i've never heard a\nwoman complain that she's providing\neverything for her man and still not\ngetting laid\nor a man complained that a woman is just\nusing him for sex\ni'm sure either can happen but they\ndon't happen nearly as often as the\nconverse now i'm not here to make a\nmoral judgment about how men should be\nlike this or a woman shouldn't be like\nthat\ni'm just telling you it is generally\nattracted to men and generally attracted\nto women\nwhich means that if you are a woman\nlooking to attract a man's attention\nyou do not need to signal that you have\nan mba\nor that you've traveled around the world\nor that you have a black belt in judo\nthose are impressive things in their own\nright but they generally don't make you\nmore attractive to men\nwhether you like it or not your visuals\nwill do more to attract men than your\nprofessional title or your personal\naccomplishments\non the other hand if you're a man\nlooking to attract a woman's attention\nyou can cool it with the shirtless picks\nman i'm not saying that your six pack\nisn't impressive just that women don't\nsort for the body the way that men sort\nfor the body as i said they sort for all\nthe stuff\nthe ken doll comes with\nthey don't care about the doll the doll\nis identical they want all the cute\naccessories women want a complete and\nemotionally compelling lifestyle that\nthey can enter into and that's why there\nare different flavors of ken\ndifferentiated by lifestyle and\noccupation there's malibu ken and cowboy\nken and stockbroker ken and astronaut\nken and quarterback can\nthey want the trappings and\nopportunities of a specific lifestyle\nand that's why some ugly ass dudes can\nattract some very beautiful women\nnow if we're feeling cynical we can say\nall men are pigs and women are gold\ndiggers because at the extremes that's\nalways how the exploitation happens\nbut most folks aren't so distorted\nhowever that doesn't mean these biases\ngo away and if you're smart you can use\nthis awareness to your advantage\nunderstand that the opposite sex wants\ndifferent things than you do and that\nthat's okay\nwhen i go fishing i don't put what i\nthink is delicious on the hook i put a\nworm on the hook not a piece of filet\nmignon\nlearn to bait your hook properly and\nyou'll have an easier go of it in the\ndating market\nsomething to consider\nplease like comment and subscribe for\nthe algorithm and see the about tab for\nmore information on donations and\nconsultations\nthanks for listening"
