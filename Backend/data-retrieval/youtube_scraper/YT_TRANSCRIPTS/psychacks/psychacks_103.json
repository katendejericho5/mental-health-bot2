    "transcript": "if a child misbehaves and they think\nwell I'm gonna punish that kid by\nsending him to his room but then when he\ngets into his room he knocks everything\noff the shelves kicks the wall and\nstarts making even bigger Ruckus than\nbefore that wasn't punishing that\nactually made the situation worse so\nwhat we think is a punishment might\nactually be a reinforcer in vice versa a\npunishment is only something that\ndecreases the frequency of a Target\nbehavior and we don't know that\nsomething is a punishment until it\nactually does that and a reward or\nenforcer is only something that\nincreases the frequency of a Target\nbehavior and we only know what that is\nafter we observe its effect on the\nindividual in question so some things\nare more or less carrots or sticks to\neverybody but remember there are some\npeople who like to get whipped for fun\nso like even humiliation and physical\ntorment can be carrots to certain people\nthat's how confusing we happen to be"
