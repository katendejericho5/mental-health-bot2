    "transcript": "in a comment to my recent video the fear\nof commitment australian girl asks what\ncauses commitment issues in women\nlook one of my first girlfriends in\ncollege\neventually admitted to me years later\nthat when i first asked her out she\nturned me down because she didn't want\nto date somebody who still lived in the\ndorms\none of my best friend's wife confided in\nme that she rejected her future\nhusband's first proposal because he\nstill lived in a trailer and had a\npart-time job\nthe fact of the matter is is that women\nreject\noffers of commitment for the same\nreasons that men do that they are\nperceived as not being good enough for\nthat particular individual\nthe double standard is that when a woman\nturns down a man's offer for commitment\nthat woman is not generally labeled as\nhaving a fear of commitment whereas the\nconverse is true for men and that was\none of the core points of my video"
