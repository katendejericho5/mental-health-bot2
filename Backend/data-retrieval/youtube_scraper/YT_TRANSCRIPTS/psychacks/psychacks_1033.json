    "transcript": "i'm dr o'brien taraban and this is\npsych's better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe fundamental romantic\nmisunderstanding sounds very official\ndoesn't it well i've given this a lot of\nthought and i've counseled a lot of\npeople and so there's a good reason why\ni'm calling this the fundamental\nromantic misunderstanding it's the\nmisunderstanding that tends to trip\npeople up most often in the context of\ntheir romantic relationships\nso what is it\nvery simply the fundamental romantic\nmisunderstanding is that one's\nattraction due to circumstances\nhas been mistaken\nfor one's attraction for a specific\nindividual i'll say it again\nthe fundamental romantic\nmisunderstanding is that one's\nattraction due to circumstances\nhas been mistaken for one's attraction\nfor a specific individual\nwhat does that mean\nlook there are lots of things that\nincrease attraction\ncircumstantially\nthese are things like rejection\nobstruction\ndistance\nunobtainability\nuncertainty\nmystery emotional polarization\netc\nthese things tend to increase attraction\nwhether we like it or not it's just the\nway that attraction works\nand sometimes these circumstances\nconspire to dramatically increase a\nperson's attraction\nthe fundamental romantic\nmisunderstanding is believing that your\nattraction\nis for the actual person\nin instead of understanding that your\nattraction is a response to the\ncircumstances around that person\nit's really really important to exercise\ncareful discernment in the dating\nprocess when you find yourself becoming\nromantically attracted to someone ask\nyourself why am i attracted to this\nperson\nis it because of her virtues or his\nsense of humor\nor her beauty\nor his drive or her sweetness\ncharacteristics that actually inhere in\nthe other person\nor do i keep thinking about this person\nbecause he hasn't responded to my texts\nor she's playing hard to get\nor he turned me down or she gave me\nmixed signals\nbecause these things tend to increase\nattraction whether we like it or not\nand this is dangerous because let's say\nyou actually succeed\nin entering into a relationship with\nthis person yay\nright well\nthink again\nwho do you actually end up with at the\nend of the game if you are more\nattracted to the circumstances around\nthe person than the person him or\nherself\nyou may end up with somebody that you're\nnot actually attracted to\nit might be someone you don't even like\nand that's a problem\nbecause\nthen you're either going to create drama\nin the relationship in order to keep the\nfeeling alive\nor you're going to walk away from that\nrelationship having wasted your time\nwhen it comes to attraction you have to\nlook real\nclosely to see the truth\nsomething to consider\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and see the\nabout tab for more information on\ndonations and consultations thanks for\nlistening"
