    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is a\nperspective on happiness\nso i'm currently reading through the\nphilosophy of epicurus epicurus was an\nancient greek philosopher and he gave\nhis name to the adjective epicurean\nwhich is usually associated with an\nappreciation for the finer things in\nlife like luxurious food or sumptuous\nsettings\nepicurus was a proponent of hedonism\nwhich is essentially the belief that\nhumans are fundamentally motivated to\nobtain pleasure and avoid pain\nhowever i think that his philosophy is\noften misunderstood as merely the\nseeking after sensuous experience if you\nactually read epicurus that is not at\nall what he is suggesting and i think\nit's worth noting because his\nperspective is pretty interesting as it\npertains to the general pursuit of\nhappiness which i think we're all\ninterested in\none of the things that epicurus argues\nis that pleasure is the absence of pain\nand the absence of fear\npain being physical harm and fear being\nlet's say mental or psychological harm\nhe claims that when we are in a state of\nfreedom from pain and fear\nwe are happy\nand this sort of suggests that happiness\nis not obtained positively by the\naddition\nof comforts or pleasant experiences\nbut negatively by the removal of pain or\nunpleasant experiences\nand this definition of happiness makes\nthat experience far more accessible to\nthe general swath of humanity and i like\nthat\nhe also argues that we engage in a sort\nof hedonic calculus in which we use our\nreason and judgment to calculate the net\npleasure of a given experience for\ninstance not all pleasant things are net\npositives because of the unpleasantness\nthat tends to result as a consequence of\npursuing them\nand so something that is pleasurable\nimmediately but carries with it a lot of\nunpleasant or painful consequences can't\nreally be properly understood as a\npleasure\nand this includes many of the\nexperiences that are typically given the\nepicurean label fine foods drugs sex\nepicurus admits that these things in the\nmoment are pleasurable but that they\noften create unpleasant consequences\nespecially if they are not used in\nmoderation\nthe upshot for him is that it's not\npossible to live without pain or fear\nif you live without temperance or\nrationality\nand that living nobly\njustly and sensibly\nis your best bet to living without pain\nor fear i.e your best bet at being happy\nsome interesting thoughts to consider\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and see the\nabout tab for more information on\ndonations and consultations\nthanks for listening"
