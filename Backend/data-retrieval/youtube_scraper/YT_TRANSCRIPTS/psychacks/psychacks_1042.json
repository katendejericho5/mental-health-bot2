    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe truth about social media posts\nso social media offers a very distorted\nvision of reality i think we all know\nthat but i'd like to demonstrate why\nthis happens to be the case with a\nlittle analogy\nlet's say that you find this really\namazing hole in the wall restaurant the\nfood is fantastic and affordable the\natmosphere is cozy and intimate the\nstaff is friendly and personable and the\nowner always comps your dessert\nit's your spot\nare you gonna tell the world about this\nplace\ni don't think so\nif everyone were to know about this\nrestaurant it would kind of degrade the\nexperience you'd have to make a\nreservation months in advance or there\nwould be a line out the door just to get\na table\nthe truth is that if you have something\ntruly good\nyou don't tell other people about it\nbecause they can ruin it\nso if somebody creates a post on social\nmedia that seems to be about something\nthat's very good\nthere's really only two real\npossibilities\none it's not actually good\nit's just a slice of that experience\nselectively curated to depict the\nminority of good from among the majority\nof mediocre or bad or two\nit's not actually\ntheirs\nthey're at this fancy hotel\nso they're promoting someone else's\nproperty that they rented for a night or\nthey're standing in front of a\nlamborghini so they broke into the valet\nparking lot\ni mean do you see\nif you have something good you don't\nshare it indiscriminately with the world\nso if someone appears to be doing just\nthat\nit's either not good or it's not theirs\nthose who do have something good are\nused to it\nit's no longer an event\nif you are a person who routinely flies\nfirst class\nare you posting about flying first class\nno you're used to it\nand the more you're used to it the less\nlikely you'll think\nto set it aside for special attention\nsomething to consider\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and please\nsee the about tab for more information\non donations and consultations\nthanks for listening"
