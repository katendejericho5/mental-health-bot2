    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nbottom\nis when you stop digging\nthis is a phrase from aaa and other\n12-step programs\npeople really begin to change when\nthey've hit bottom\nthe issue is that everybody's bottom is\na different depth\nsome people they have a little too much\nto drink they wake up with a hangover\nand they think you know what that's not\nfor me and they never touch another drop\nfor the rest of their lives\nand so a hangover is a bottom for some\npeople\nother people might have seven duis\nserious liver damage and a strange\nrelationships with all their family\nmembers and they still might be drinking\nnow you might look at this person and\nthink what more has to happen to this\nguy\nwhat new suffering does he have to\nundergo before he's finally ready to\nstop digging the hole that he finds\nhimself in\nand the answer to that question is a\nmystery\nthere's no way to answer it with any\ndegree of certainty\nwhat i've discovered from working with\naddicts over the years is that you\nreally can't anticipate the depth of\nanother person's bottom\nultimately it's for each person to\ndecide for himself or herself when it's\nactually time to stop digging\nand this is extremely important to\nunderstand if you find yourself in a\nrelationship with an addict bottom is\nwhen they decide to stop digging not you\nthis is heartbreaking this is\ninfuriating\nand this is the truth\nhowever there's another side to this\nokay\nif bottom is when you stop digging\nthen there's literally nothing stopping\nyou from deciding to stop digging right\nnow\nnobody's making you dig any deeper\nyou don't have to or need to keep\ndigging if the decision is yours and\nwe've already established it's yours and\nno one else's then digging or not\ndigging is entirely within your control\nyou don't have to keep digging just\nbecause that's what you've been doing in\nthe past\nyou can throw that shovel away my friend\nstart figuring a way out of that hole\nthe choice really is yours\ni hope that helps please like comment\nand subscribe for the algorithm and\nplease see the about tab for more\ninformation on consultations and\ndonations\nthanks for listening"
