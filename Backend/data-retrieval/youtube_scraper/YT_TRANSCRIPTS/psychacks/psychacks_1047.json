    "transcript": "hi everybody so today i'm going to be\nanswering a question posted by valerie\npalkavik\non my recent video how to love without\nemotional attachment and valerie asks\nwhat constitutes good milk it's kind of\nthe crux of the matter unfortunately i\ncan't get any more specific than that or\nelse the\nanalogy the metaphor is ruined why is\nthat because it's\nthe cat who decides\nwhat milk is good if i tell you that\ngood milk is having a lot of money or\nhaving sex very frequently with your\npartner or always supporting their\nagenda or challenging them appropriately\nyou'd take that and it would work in\nsome cases and not work in other cases\nthe fact of the matter is is that each\ncat has idiosyncratic tastes and so your\njob is to sort of experiment and observe\nput out milk and watch how the cat\nbehaves the cat will teach you what it\nbelieves is good milk"
