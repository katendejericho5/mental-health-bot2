    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow to receive a compliment\nit might sound strange but for some\nfolks it's easier to accept criticism\nthan a compliment so today i'd like to\ntalk about how to get better at\nreceiving positive feedback\nfirst of all i'd like to consider that a\ncompliment is a gift\nand as such it's important to understand\nthat not all gifts are free and sincere\nsome gifts have strings attached so it's\nimportant to discern between complements\nthat have strings attached which we\nwould typically call flattery which is\nactually a form of mockery\nand those that are given freely and\nsincerely in this video i'm only going\nto be talking about the latter the free\nand sincere compliments so if you\nreceive positive feedback from someone\nthat you perceive as sincere\nwhat i'd like you to consider is that\nthis is a free and spontaneous gift\nthat was given at the pleasure of the\ncomplimenter\nso what do you do when you receive a\ngift like a present for your birthday\nyou don't just look at\nit and say oh thanks and here's one for\nyou\nyou don't just unthinkingly repay a gift\nwith a gift in kind you also don't you\nknow dismiss the gift or the gift-giver\nout of your own discomfort over having\nreceived a gift\nif you have any grace whatsoever\nyou open up the package and you express\nsome enjoyment and the easiest way to\nexpress enjoyment is to make accurate\nobservations over what it is that you've\nreceived\nyou pull it out of the box and you say\noh\nit's a sweater\nand look at the color ooh and it's so\nsoft i bet it'll be so warm and cozy\nthis winter thank you\nthat's how you communicate gratitude for\na gift that was freely given\nyou can do something similar when you\nreceive a compliment\nand to do this you will need to exercise\na certain flexibility in your\nperspective\nin the moment of receiving the\ncompliment\nyou can shift your perspective to join\nwith the complimenter in appreciation of\nwhatever is being complemented\nthis will allow your subjectivity to\njoin\nwith the complimenter in appreciation of\nyour objectivity\nso for instance if someone were to\ncompliment you on your physique\nyou could flexibly change your\nperspective to join with the\ncomplimenter and appreciate your\nphysique from an objective perspective\nsomething like yeah i'm liking how\nthings are turning out too\ni've been working pretty hard and i've\nstarted to see some definition in my\narms yeah thanks for noticing\ni think that's sufficient\ni think anything more than that might\ncome off as bane\nbut anything less than that might come\noff as awkward or ungrateful\nit's a fine line but you can learn how\nto walk it\nso the best way to accept a compliment\nis to flexibly join with the perspective\nof the complimenter and to express\naccurate observations about the object\nof the complement which just so happens\nto be you\nit's no longer you as subject it's you\nas object and in this way you don't have\nto feel awkward or uncomfortable about\nreceiving compliments because you can\njoin with the objective perspective of\nthe complimenter in that moment\ni hope that makes sense\nplease like comment and subscribe for\nthe algorithm and please see the about\ntab for more information on donations\nand consultations thanks for listening"
