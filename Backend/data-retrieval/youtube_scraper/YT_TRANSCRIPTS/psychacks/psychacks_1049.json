    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nbond\nand non-attachment\nso today we'll take another foray into\npop psychology i am one of the world's\nbiggest james bond fans i'm very happy\nto admit and i rewatched the excellent\nno time to die just the other day and\nsomething really hit home for me in this\nreviewing that i would like to share\nwith you\nnamely bonds supreme indifference\nnow i don't want to give too much away\nbut in no time to die\nbond enters into a kind of retirement\nfrom mi6 and after some years he comes\nto meet his replacement the new\n007 and this is just an unprecedented\nmoment in history the franchise to\naccept someone other than james bond as\ndouble 07 is tent amount to the highest\nconceivable heresy within that fandom\nwhat's more the new double 07 is\nobviously trying to needle him to get\nunder his skin by flaunting the fact\nthat bond is no longer 07 and bond's\nreply is so so excellent\nwith complete stoic indifference he\nreplies it's just a number\nand yeah\nit's a number that he had been\ninextricably identified with for nearly\n60 years so the ability to shrug it off\nnonchalantly i think really embodies the\nkind of indifference that makes bond a\npowerful individual in his relationships\nand makes him highly effective at what\nhe does\nand there are examples of this\nindifference throughout the series for\ninstance bond has evinced a let's say\ncasual relationship to all of his\ngadgets and gizmos over the years he\ngets all kinds of fancy watches and\nflashy cars and he treats them with an\nalmost regal indifference and they\nalmost always end up getting destroyed\nin the end\nand i really like this attitude toward\nmateriality that james bond tends to\nembody in his films a lot of people\nthey treat their electronics they or\ntheir cars or their material possessions\nwith so much concern with so much pride\nthat it can border on narcissistic\nattachment\npeople in such positions end up servants\nof their things as tyler durden says in\nfight club the things you own end up\nowning you\nbond on the other hand treats things\nlike things they're stuff\nthey're not that important or they're\nimportant only to the extent that\nthey're useful to the mission after\nwhich they become irrelevant\nbond can make use of status and luxury\nwithout becoming ensnared by them and he\ndoes this by subordinating both\nto the propotency of his mission\nonce these objects fulfill their\nusefulness they're just stuff and it may\nbe necessary to even let them go to make\nspace for the tools for the next job\nsomething to consider\nplease like comment and subscribe for\nthe algorithm and please see the about\ntab for more information on donations\nand consultations thanks for listening"
