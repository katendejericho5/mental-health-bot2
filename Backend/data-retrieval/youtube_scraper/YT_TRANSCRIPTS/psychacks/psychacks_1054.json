    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nwould you change places with them\nthis is a very useful hack that i've\ndeveloped to help folks deal with\nfeelings of unfairness or injustice\nespecially in the context of sibling\nrelationships\nit's often the case that one sibling\nlooks at the other and says you know\nit's not fair\nthey've gotten everything handed to them\non a silver platter they've been bailed\nout of so many circumstances and they've\nnever had to work for anything\nnot like me i've had to struggle and\nstrive for everything i have and it's\njust\nnot\nfair\nokay\nso that kind of resentment can really\ncorrode a person's heart and obviously\npoison the relationship so it's a belief\nthat even if it's true isn't\nparticularly useful to us\nso often i ask these folks okay well\nmaybe it isn't fair\nbut would you change places with them\nlike if god were to come down from the\nheavens\nand say i've heard your complaint and\ni'm willing to make a change i can move\nyou into your sibling situation and your\nsibling can move into yours are you\nready\nmost likely you'll say something like oh\ngeez god\ni'm sorry no thank you i think i'd\nprefer to stay where i am\nin fact i've never had a client once in\n10 years tell me that he or she would\nswitch places with the other person\nand that's telling\nif the situation is unfair\nbut you wouldn't switch places with the\nother person\nthen you're in the better position\nthere's no other way to think about it\ndivide a hundred dollars between two\npeople and equally only the person with\nless\nwould want to switch\nplaces what's more when you complain\nabout taking the hard path on some level\nyou're devaluing the benefits that have\naccrued to you as a result of taking the\nhard path these can include building\nauthentic self-confidence developing a\nsolid career learning to navigate life\nsuccessfully etc\nyou're basically saying yeah i took the\nhard path and i got those things but\nwhat's authentic self-confidence when i\ncould have just been\ncashing checks that my parents sent me\nit's like really\nis that actually true is that what you\nactually believe\ni don't i don't think it is\nso this is a really useful check\nif you find yourself feeling resentful\nor envious about other people's unfair\ntreatment ask yourself would you change\nplaces with them\nin a lot of cases especially in the\ncontext of siblings the answer is no\nwhich suggests that maybe you're\nactually in a better position than you\nmight have previously recognized\nsomething to consider\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand please see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations and\nconsultations thanks for listening"
