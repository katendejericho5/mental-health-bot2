    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe worst thing to say\nin a dating profile\nthis one is especially for the ladies\nand be sure to listen until the end\nwhere i'll reveal a better approach\nladies if you are straight and you're\nlooking to attract a man using a dating\napp i'm going to ask you to seriously\nconsider steering clear of this phrase i\nthink i understand where you're coming\nfrom by using it so bear with me i'll\nexplain why it's a bad idea in a moment\nthe phrase that i want you to consider\nremoving from your dating profile is\nthat you're looking for a serious\nrelationship\nit's the serious relationship part\nthat's particularly problematic now i\nget where you're coming from ladies\nyou've likely dated casually in the past\nbut now you're looking to settle down\nget married start a family and you don't\nwant to waste your time in relationships\nthat are unlikely to take you to that\ndestination i understand that\nbut there are a few problems with\napproaching dating in this way first and\nforemost this is like the first\nimpression that you're giving men\nand what does this phrase conjure up for\nme personally the phrase serious\nrelationship makes me think that we're\ngoing to have a lot of uncomfortable\nconversations about improving our\ncommunication and take out life\ninsurance policies\nlike a serious relationship does not\nsound fun\nit sounds well\nserious\nand it makes me think that i'm signing\nup for a second unpaid job with lousy\nbenefits no thank you\nlook dating is supposed to be fun and\nlove is supposed to be playful and warm\na serious relationship does not\npsychologically associate with any of\nthese things\nit also only tends to attract the men\nwith no real options\nthink about it if i'm a guy who is\nattractive to many women\nand has good optionality\nwhy would i forego all that for a woman\ni've never met who will only date me if\ni tell her i want a wife and kids i mean\nladies you're just asking to be lied to\nthe man who would agree to that\nhonestly\nlikely has no better option\nand is that the man you want a serious\nrelationship with anyway\nhere's the thing\nyou can't really expect this type of\nrelationship from the outset\na serious relationship is like a\nmarriage which is a commitment at least\ntheoretically for life\nthe closest analogs we have to this in\nthe professional arena\nare a tenured professor or a partner in\na law firm\nyou don't just put in your linkedin\nprofile i'm looking for a tenured\nprofessorship\nyou start out as an associate professor\nand then you publish and teach and rise\nin the ranks generally it takes 10 to 12\nyears\nto become a tenured professor\nand that's just for the rest of your\ncareer not even the rest of your life\nsame thing with being the partner of a\nlaw firm you start out as an associate\nand you pay your dues and you climb the\nladder it takes at least a decade to\narrive at the position of privilege and\nsecurity\nmarriage is no different\nsaying you want a serious relationship\non your initial application\nsounds like you want to skip straight to\npartner and professor it doesn't work\nlike that now relationships aren't all\nfun and games\nbut you shouldn't lead with the serious\nand effortful dimension of relationships\nthat's just poor advertising\nit's counter-intuitive\nbut the best way to get into a long-term\nrelationship especially as a woman\nis no different from the best way to\ndate casually\nthink about it\nwhen have you got most emotionally\ninvolved with someone\nin in the beginning you probably thought\noh this is never going to be anything\nserious so i'm just going to relax and\nhave fun take it easy spend some time\ntogether and you know what\nthat's exactly the recipe for building\nintimacy\nand over time if you share the same\nvalues and you continue to enjoy each\nother's company that casual arrangement\ncan turn into a long-term relationship\nof course it doesn't always but it's\nactually your best bet\nthis is because the pressure is off and\npeople let their guard down which makes\nbuilding emotional connection easier\nnot looking for a relationship is a\ntrojan horse\nfor getting into a relationship\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and please see the\nabout tab for more information on\ndonations and\nconsultations thanks for listening"
