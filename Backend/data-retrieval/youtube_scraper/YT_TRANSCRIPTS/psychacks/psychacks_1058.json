    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe force of revenge\nrevenge is an extremely powerful fuel\nin my own personal experience\nmany of the periods marked by my most\naggressive growth and development came\nin the wake of major setbacks or\nheartbreaks\nit's not very flattering to admit\nbut a lot of that effort was motivated\nby a desire to make certain people\njealous or envious the idea was\nbasically i'll show them\nall the people who didn't believe in me\nall the people who rejected me all the\npeople who put me down and criticized\nand mocked me i'll show them by becoming\nso\nunmistakably successful that they have\nno choice but to admit that they were\nwrong and regret their poor judgment\nand i don't think that this is by any\nmeans unique to me i think in fact that\nthe vast majority of high achievers are\nmotivated at least initially by a\nsimilar force the force of revenge the\nforce of i'll show them\nand this is not necessarily a bad thing\nbecause it's such an explosive force\nit's sometimes necessary to yoke your\nwill to the force of revenge to like\nachieve escape velocity\nto get to the stars you need a really\npowerful energy dense fuel and revenge\ncertainly fits that bill so it can be\nvery useful and constructive to yoke\nyour will to the force of revenge in the\ninitial stages of a setback or rejection\nhowever\nyou don't want to burn that fuel forever\nwhy\nbecause at a certain point maintaining a\nconnection to the force of revenge\nbecomes well\npathetic\nif you're 40 years old and you're still\ntrying to get back at the girl who\nturned you down in high school or you're\n50 years old and you're still seeking\nyour parents approval it's not a good\nlook\nso revenge is like a first stage rocket\nfuel it helps you to achieve escape\nvelocity but once you've left the\ngravitational field you need to find\nsome other means of propelling your life\nforward\nand ideally you want this to be a more\npositive force like some sort of mission\nin life like the will to serve others or\nthe desire to create a legacy or the\nvision to marshal new ideas or new works\nof art into the world or even the drive\nto achieve self-transcendence and\nenlightenment\nthese forces can be just as powerful as\nthe force of revenge and they don't come\nwith any of those dark undertones\nsomething to consider\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
