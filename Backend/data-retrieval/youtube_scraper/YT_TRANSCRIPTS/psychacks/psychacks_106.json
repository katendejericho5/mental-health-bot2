    "transcript": "the vast majority of issues do not need\nto be resolved right then and there this\nperception of pressured necessity tends\nto force discussion which generally\nleads to suboptimal results if you're\nemotionally activated then anything you\nsay or do will be colored with that\nemotion which could very well create\nmore problems than it solves especially\nwhen it comes to anger so if you can\nresist the urge to force the issue right\nthen and there if you can resist the\nimpulse to engage in unproductive back\nand forth then you will be in a much\nbetter position if and when the\nindividual in question comes back for a\ndiscussion and in my experience most\npeople do come back after they've calmed\ndown especially if you chose not to\nengage them in kind this is because your\nunwillingness to enter into their\nemotional world will cause their\nbehavior to exist in stark contrast to\nyours they very clearly will have\nstepped over a line because you didn't\nstep over it with them"
