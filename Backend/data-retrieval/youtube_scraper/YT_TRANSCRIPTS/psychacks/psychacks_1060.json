    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nthe threshold of tolerance\nso it can happen that in the course of\nour relationships whether they're with\nfamily or with friends or with romantic\npartners that we become the object of\nother people's displeasure\ndisrespect and negativity\nand there's this question that i think\ngoes through most reasonable people's\nminds which is basically how much is\nenough\nlike at what point does this behavior\nbecome intolerable at what point should\ni speak up or fight back at what point\nshould i leave the relationship\nnow there's no one-size-fits-all answer\nto this question but i have a very\nsimple rule of thumb\nto identify the threshold of tolerance\nand i call it the stranger on a bus rule\nit's very simple\nthe rule is that the people in my life\nneed to treat me at least as well as\nthey would treat a stranger on a bus\nor they lose the privilege of my company\nit's that simple\nif someone in my life treats someone\nthat they don't know in a social\ncapacity better than they treat me\nbehind closed doors that's not tolerable\nthat's not acceptable and is potentially\nvery dangerous and this is because those\nclose to me have the opportunity to do\nsignificantly more damage to me than\nthose kept at a distance\nsince they have access to my\nvulnerabilities in my past they can\npotentially weaponize that intimacy\nand if they choose to do so that would\nbe a fundamental betrayal of my trust\nwhich would render the relationship\ncontract null and void\nnow i understand that i'm not perfect i\nunderstand that people are going to\ndisagree with me and i understand that\npeople are just going to have bad days\nhowever i still expect\nthat people treat me with the same\ndegree of courtesy and respect\nthat they would exercise in dealing with\na stranger on a bus\nespecially the stranger who may even be\nacting in a flagrantly annoying fashion\nin my relationships i expect at least\nthat level of dignity and respect i\ndon't think that's that's too much to\nask\nand if they're not going to provide it\nfor whatever reason\ni'm going to take myself out of that\nrelationship a relationship with me is a\nprivilege not a right and you can think\nthe same way\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at cycac's\npodcast at gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
