    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe concept of love food\nlove food is a term that i coined to\nrepresent something that is really\nimportant to the emotional health of\nhuman beings and is absolutely essential\nto the emotional health of children so\nwhat is it\nbroadly defined love food is being held\nemotionally by another person and in the\ncontext of children it's being held\nemotionally by a parent\nthis could mean attention affection love\nadmiration praise acknowledgement\nconsideration appreciation etc\nall of these are forms of love food so\nwhat's the significance of this concept\nwell what i'd like you to consider is\nthat a family is like a little ecosystem\nkind of like a little rainforest\nand just like there is a limited amount\nof food within the rainforest there is a\nlimited amount of love food within the\nfamily\nthis isn't necessarily because the\nparents are cold and withholding though\nthat can certainly be the case this is\nbecause the parents are human\nand they only have so much time and\nenergy and attention and they're not\ngoing to allocate those resources\nequally across multiple children all the\ntime it's just not possible so there is\na limited amount of love food in the\necosystem of any family and each child\nonly has access to a portion of it\nand what happens in the context of a\nfamily is that children over time come\nto cultivate roles they come to occupy\nniches within the family ecosystem that\nwill maximize their access to parental\nlove food and typically this is all done\nunconsciously through reinforcement\nprocesses\nthe parents generally don't know that\nthey're encouraging this process and the\nchildren generally don't know how\nthey're being molded by their\nenvironment\nthese reinforcement contingencies are\nunconscious processes that drive\nspecialization just like in the rain\nforest the rain frog doesn't consciously\nevolve sticky pads on its toes so that\nit can cling to trees and evade\npredators it just kind of happens\nbecause the frogs that had stickier toes\ntended to survive and the frogs that\ndidn't tended to get gobbled so the\nprocess of specialization within the\nfamily ecosystem typically occurs\ncompletely unconsciously it's not\nanyone's fault\nit just happens\nand this is especially important in the\ncontext of siblings because in the vast\nmajority of cases the oldest sibling\nalready has a substantial advantage over\nany younger siblings because older\nsiblings know the ecosystem better\nand they've already kind of spent time\nspecializing in a given direction\nconsequently the route to specialization\nthat is occupied by the eldest sibling\nis effectively closed off to the younger\nsiblings who then have to find other\nways to compete for the limited supply\nof love food in the ecosystem\nin the vast majority of cases younger\nsiblings just can't successfully compete\nin the same domains with their bigger\nstronger more knowledgeable more\nexperienced older siblings so they have\nto find other routes to specialization\nto survive in that ecosystem and that's\nhow siblings tend to occupy different\nroles within the family over time\nand the last thing i want to point out\nis you can take the person out of the\nfamily\nbut you can't always take the family out\nof the person\nwhich is to say if we don't acknowledge\nand process the specializations that we\nadopted in childhood to secure love food\nwithin the family ecosystem\nthen these specializations can actually\nfollow us for our entire lives for\nbetter or for worse\nif you ever want to understand why\npeople are the way that they are\nyou have to imagine them in the\ncircumstances that created them\nit's like if you go to a zoo and you see\na jaguar you might think why does that\njaguar have spots that doesn't make any\nsense\nbut if you then saw that jaguar in the\njungle and the light was filtering down\nthrough the through the leaves and\nleaving this dappled pattern of shadow\non the ground you're going to say oh\ni understand why jaguars have spots it\nmakes sense now now humans are a little\ndifferent from jaguars in that they have\nthe capacity to overcome their\ncircumstances\nbut it's not easy to do and we do have\nto make a concerted effort to try\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\ncycact's podcast at gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
