    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow to enjoy your life more\nthe other day i was speaking with a\nclient who told me that because of some\nof the experience he's passed through in\nhis life he's begun to see life on this\nplanet as disappointing unsatisfactory\nand painful\nand in many respects this person in my\nopinion\nwas actually starting to see reality\nclearly\nlife on this planet is\ninherently unsatisfactory that's one of\nthe fundamental teachings of the buddha\nthere is darkness and pain and suffering\nand loss and grief and betrayal and all\nkinds of nasty things on this planet but\nit's also true that this planet is under\nthe auspices of duality\nif there is darkness there must be light\nif there is chaos there must be harmony\nif there is ignorance and cruelty there\nmust be wisdom and kindness and so on so\nlife is a mixture of both\nthere is no worldly thing that is all\ngood or all bad and this is symbolized\nin the yin yang symbol within the white\nthere is a spot of black and within the\nblack there is a spot of white\nlife is a mixture of the light and the\ndark\nso if that's the nature of things how\ncan we enjoy life more\nby harnessing the power of focus and\nattention remember\nfocus is like\na magnifying glass\nwhatever we focus on gets bigger\nand as it gets bigger it fills the\ncontent of our consciousness until\nthat's all we can see so our focus\nactually dictates on a very fundamental\nlevel our experience of reality\nand if we have some freedom to choose we\ncan choose to increasingly focus on the\ngood and less on all the rest\nhere's how you can think about this\nhave you ever had this experience i\nthink we all have\nwhere you're having a really nice meal\nat a fancy restaurant and the food is\nwonderful and the service is excellent\nbut the whole time\nyou're just thinking about the check and\nhow expensive the meal is going to be\ni think we've all been there\nand this is unfortunate because the\ncheck is gonna come either way\nthat's what i'd like you to consider\nthe check is coming it's\ninevitable\nyou don't have to worry about it and we\nall have to pay it one way or another\nbut in the meantime\nwe might as well enjoy the meal\nbecause if we don't well\nwe still have to pay the check and we'll\nbuy the meal at a much steeper price\nthat way because it wasn't offset by the\njoy and pleasure that we might otherwise\nhave received from the experience\nso that's the power of focus enjoy the\nmeal that's on your table and pay the\ncheck when it comes\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychics podcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
