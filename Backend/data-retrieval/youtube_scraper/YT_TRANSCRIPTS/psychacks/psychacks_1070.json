    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is cycax\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is find your\ndark horse so\nthis one is for the ladies today i'm\ngoing to be talking about an effective\nmate selection strategy for straight\nwomen so what do women generally find\nattractive in men\nsuccess\nstatus resources competence confidence\nthese traits signal the ability to\nprovide and protect and also offer a\nplace in society\nsounds good right\nthe issue is that under most\ncircumstances it takes a very\nvery\nvery long time\nfor most men to achieve these things if\nthey ever do\nwe can kind of call the men who do the\nwinners in the race of life they've\ncrossed the finish line and they're kind\nof in the winner's circle\nnow according to tinder which actually\ndoes a lot of interesting research with\nits data\nthe top 78 percent of women the vast\nmajority of women\nare competing for the top 20\nof men\nthat's a 4 to 1 ratio and the ratio only\ngets more ludicrously lopsided the\nfurther up the male hierarchy you go\nthis means that to continue my metaphor\nmost of you women are more or less\nhanging out at the winner's circle\ntrying to attract the attention of the\nmen who make it that far\nand you know this makes a certain sense\nbecause if he's gotten that far he\nprobably has many of the attributes that\nyou might be looking for\nbut it's also easy to see the liability\nin this approach\nhow many\nother women are hanging out at the\nwinner's circle\n4\n10\n100\nnow the question becomes\nwhy would the man want to pick you\nover the other four ten hundred because\na guy who crosses the finish line\nkind of gets his choice of the women who\nare waiting for him there\nso this is a good strategy in theory but\nit only works if you can be fairly\nconfident that you can out compete the\nother women who might be doing the same\nthing and the better the man the worse\nyour odds will be\nin my opinion women a better strategy is\nfor you to find your dark horse a dark\nhorse is a racing term for an underdog\nperformer who ends up winning the race\nto do this you have to become a bit of a\nsleuth and you have to learn about men\nwhat do bookies do before a race they do\nresearch they look at past performance\nthey check the pedigree they examine the\nforelocks they consider the stride they\ncheck out the teeth\nyou get the idea\nyou gotta do some investigation and i'm\ngonna help you\none of the best things to check for\nis whether he has a detailed and reality\nbased plan for the future\nthis is a very good thing to see when\nyou're looking for a dark horse so learn\nabout men\ndo some due diligence and place your bet\nbefore\nthe race is run now obviously this is a\nbit of a gamble\nbut\nso is hanging out in the winner's circle\nif there are nine other women there you\nhave a 10 chance of bagging the dude\nand if there's 99 other women there\nforget about it\ncontrast that with the dark horse what\nare his odds of going the distance they\nmight be better than one in ten almost\ncertainly better than one in a hundred\ndo you see what i'm getting at\nthis is a more reliable way of ending up\nwith a winner provided you know what\nyou're looking for\nso ladies your best bet is to actually\nfind a guy who hasn't won yet\nbut who has the attributes of a future\nwinner\nthen you get all the good stuff all to\nyourself\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat cycaxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
