    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is a\nsurprising insight from harry potter\nso today we're going to take another\ndive into pop psychology a few days ago\ni was thinking about one of my previous\ntalks on self narrative the episode was\ncalled change your narrative in case\nyou're interested\nin which i made the argument that the\nonly difference between the story of the\nvictim and the story of the hero is the\nfinal chapter\nlike the victim the hero goes through\nall kinds of hardships and suffers all\nsorts of losses\nhe just emerges victorious in the end\nand without that hardship and loss he\ncould hardly be considered heroic\na great example of this is harry potter\ni mean look at how we first meet harry\nboth of his parents have been murdered\nhe acts as a servant to an emotionally\nabusive family that's been gaslighting\nhim his entire life\nand he lives in a crawl space beneath\nthe stairs\ni mean there are plenty of things in\nharry potter's origin story that if he\nchose to he could have been hung up on\nfor the rest of his life any one of\nthose things could mess somebody up the\nhard part is breaking free of the\nimpulse to victimize yourself\nbecause it's sometimes the case that in\nthe course of our lives we have to deal\nwith hardship and unfairness and tragedy\nand loss\nhow do we deal with this without\nbecoming victims\nthe story of harry potter has a\nsurprising answer\nin the story the entities that intervene\nbetween harry and his tormentors\nare the owls\nowls that carry letters from dumbledore\nabout hogwarts and the truth of who\nharry is\nand it's interesting that rowling\ndecided to use the image of the owl\nto do this\nmaybe it's just a convenient narrative\ndevice to build attention and anticipate\nhagrid however\na bird like an owl is an interesting\nsymbol psychologically the bird is a\nmessenger between the heavens and the\nearth\nthat's why in traditional christian\niconography the holy spirit is\ntraditionally depicted as a bird usually\na dove\na bird is a go-between a messenger that\nmaintains the connection between what's\nabove and what's below\nnow i don't know if rowling intended any\nof this but there's kind of a lesson\nhere\nhow do we resist the urge to\nself-victimize when confronted with\nhardship\nwell we have to be on the lookout for\nour owls\nthe part of ourselves\nthat is still connected to the divine\nand remembers who we really are\nand to do that\nyou have to kind of listen real close\nbecause this part often speaks in a\nsmall quiet voice especially if you're\nnot in the habit of listening to it\nand this part has and always will have\ncommerce with the divine aspect of your\nbeing\nand by connecting with that voice\nwhich will tell you the truth of who you\nare and what you're going through\nyou can begin the process of overcoming\nwhatever circumstances you happen to\nfind yourself within\nyou are never so alone that this\nmessenger is unavailable to you\nif you're willing to listen\nwhat do you think was this too much of a\nstretch\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychaxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
