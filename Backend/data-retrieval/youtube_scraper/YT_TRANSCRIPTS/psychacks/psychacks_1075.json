    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe work\nnever ends\nso throughout most of my life my go-to\nstrategy when i had a lot to do was to\nroll up my sleeves hunker down and work\nuntil the job was over\nand this is certainly a useful strategy\nto cultivate in one's life some people\nneed to learn how to do this and it's\nappropriate under certain situations\nhowever there came a point in my life i\nwas in grad school at the time\nwhen the inflow of new work surpassed my\nability to discharge it\nso when i rolled up my sleeves and\nhunkered down\ni\nworked and i worked\nand i worked\nand i worked so i rolled my sleeves even\nhigher up and i hunkered down even lower\nand i worked and i worked and i worked\nand the end was still nowhere in sight i\nhad never seen this before\nand i burned myself out in a really\nserious way\nthe problem was that i was using the\nwrong tool for the job rolling up your\nsleeves and hunkering down works when\nyou have a finite amount of work to do\nhowever if you're at all successful in\nlife you will reach a point where the\ninflux of new tasks completely overtakes\nyour ability to discharge those\nresponsibilities\nit's just how it is\npeople respond to that point in\ndifferent ways some will get help and\ndelegate others will restrict the\npipeline and distance themselves from\nthe responsibility\nmy attitude is somewhat different\ni've just sort of adopted the attitude\nthat the work never ends\nso my job\nis not to finish the work\nmy job is to work for the time that i've\nassigned to working\nand to stop working when that time is\nfinished\ni stop when i'm done not when the work\nis done\nbecause the work is\nnever done\nmy mental image of work is carrying a\nbucket of water at the start of my my\nday i pick that bucket up\ni carry it for a time and at the end of\nmy day i put that bucket down\nand tomorrow i'll pick up that bucket\nand carry it a little further down the\nroad\nthe day will not arrive when i get to\npour out the water\nso i'm not laboring under the illusion\nthat one day the water will be delivered\nin fact that bucket will likely need to\nbe carried long after i'm gone\nwhen i can't pick up the bucket anymore\nsomeone else will pick it up and carry\nit a bit further down the road and when\nhe can't pick up the bucket someone else\nwill take up the load and so on\ni'm a therapist\nit might be strange to hear\nbut i'm not working for the day when all\npeople are healed and all neuroses are\nbanished and all trauma is reconciled\nand everyone is content with their lives\nand satisfied with their relationships\nthat will\nnever\nhappen\nthese problems are made new each day and\nwith each passing generation\nthe work\nnever ends\nso my job is not to arrive at the end of\nthe work that attitude just leads to\nburnout because it is practically\nimpossible\nmy work is to work for a time\nhelping the people that i can\nuntil i put the bucket down\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychexpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
