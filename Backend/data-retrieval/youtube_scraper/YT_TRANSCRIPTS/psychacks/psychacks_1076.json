    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nideas divide emotions unite so\nif you look around the vast majority of\nhuman conflict on this planet originates\nin ideological differences left versus\nright east versus west believers versus\nnon-believers it's the belief that\nothers beliefs are a threat to one's own\nbelief system\nand that one is therefore justified in\ndoing what is necessary to make the\nworld safe for one's own beliefs\nthat is directly related to the vast\nmajority of strife on this planet\nthroughout history check out my episode\ncalled the nature of evil in games for\nmore on this subject ideas divide people\non the other hand\nemotions\nunite people\nwhy\nbecause i don't care who you are there\nare no two people on this planet who are\nso dissimilar that they don't share some\nfacets of the human experience and those\nfacets are generally emotional as they\narise from our shared evolutionary\nhistory we're all under the same sun we\nall know what joy feels like we all know\nwhat pain feels like we all know what\nfear feels like all of us want to be\nloved and respected and to live in peace\nnone of us wants to be disrespected or\nabused or to live in conflict we may\nhave ideological differences with\nrespect to the best way to go about\nachieving these ends\nbut those are the things that we all\nwant\nthe upshot of this is that by\nprioritizing the importance of our\nbeliefs we often unintentionally create\nthe very world that we would prefer not\nto inhabit\nif you want to bring people together\nwhether this is in the context of your\nmarriage or global geopolitics\nyou need to focus on emotions\nthe shared human experience that you\nhave in common with other human beings\nnow this isn't enough to end all\nconflict but there's no way you can end\nall conflict outside of mutually assured\ndestruction without including this as a\nstrategy\nand we can all do this in our own lives\nby putting common humanity ahead of\ndivisive ideology\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
