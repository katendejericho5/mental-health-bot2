    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe right decision\ndoesn't exist\nthis is something that i hear from my\nclients on an almost daily basis\nthey're at a crossroads at life\nand they're feeling anxious about making\na decision because they want to do the\nright thing\nthey want to make the right choice\nunderstandable enough right\nthe problem\nis that implicit in the idea of the\nright choice is the existence of many\nmany\nwrong choices\nthis creates a situation in which people\nput immense pressure on themselves to\ndiscern the one right way\nfrom among the many many wrong ways\nand that's not really how i see life\nthe older i get\nthe more i realize that there is no such\nthing as the right decision\nrather there are paths that take you in\none direction\nand there are past that take you in\nanother\nthat's it\nlike this path goes to the beach and\nthis path goes to the mountains which\npath is better which path is right\nthe answers to those questions depend\nentirely on where you want to go\nthe mountains aren't inherently better\nthan the beach and the beach isn't\ninherently worse than the mountains both\npaths will come with pros and cons\nbenefits and liabilities but one is not\nnecessarily better than the other\nif you walk either path you will have\nyour experience no more no less\nyou won't have more life walking in the\nmountains and you won't have less life\nwalking on the beach\neither will fully constitute your life\nand experience\nit will just be different\nthe goodness or badness of your decision\nis inseparable from your goals values\nand objectives\nwhich is better chinese food or italian\nfood both can be good and both can be\nbad but no matter what you choose you'll\nhave a meal at the end of the day\nconceptualizing the crossroads as the\npoint at which you need to make the\nright decision\nwill likely place a lot of unnecessary\npressure on yourself which will probably\nincrease your anxiety which will tend to\nlower your effectiveness so simply\nbelieving in the right decision will\nparadoxically reduce the likelihood that\nyou will find it within that context\nuntil you're at the point of mastery\npressure is counterproductive\nso\njust clarify for yourself what it is\nthat you want and ask yourself do i want\nto go here or do i want to go there\neither way it can be good and in both\ncases\nyou'll get your life\nno more\nno less\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psycaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
