    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nupdate your browser\nso this is a metaphor i often use with\nmy clients in which i ask them to\nexamine whether or not their operating\nsystem that is the beliefs that\ndetermine how they interact with\nthemselves other people in the world\nare up to date\nupdating your browser is annoying\nwhen the notification pops up\nmost people reflexively just postpone\nthe update it's inconvenient it takes\ntime it interrupts our process i get it\nhowever it's also absolutely essential\nto the efficient and effective operation\nof that browser here's the thing\nmost people generally come to their\nbeliefs honestly most folks aren't crazy\ntheir beliefs are extrapolated\ngeneralizations based on their actual\nlived experience\nthe issue\nis that these beliefs are often\ngeneralizations from a very limited data\nset especially if they come from\nadolescence or childhood\nmany of these attitudes that people\ncarry about men or about women or about\nrelationships or about life in general\nare based in a small subset of\nexperiences\nduring certain sensitive periods in\ntheir lives like childhood and\nadolescence\nthose beliefs might have been valid\nextrapolations from that data set\nbut it might also be inappropriate to\nexpect that those beliefs remain valid\ndecades later in light of new\ninformation\nthe way to deal with this problem is\nsimilar to the way that we train\nmachines in machine learning if a\nmachine arrives at invalid\ngeneralizations based on a skewed data\nset\nthe programmers correct this problem\nby flooding the machine\nwith better more reliable data\nthe skewed or bad data never really go\naway\nhowever over time these bad data becomes\nsufficiently insignificant to affect the\noverall architecture of the program\nand that's kind of how it is in life too\nwe can't really permanently delete those\nexperiences that may have led us to\nextrapolate certain beliefs but we can\nhave more positive experiences or\ndisconfirming experiences and\nextrapolate more generally appropriate\nbeliefs from this larger data set\nand this is what we do when we update\nour browsers we examine whether our\nbeliefs still hold true in light of new\ninformation and experience and in the\nvast majority of cases this is an\neffortful intentional process it's not\nfun but it's something that\nwe we got to do from time to time what\ndo you think remember to like comment\nand subscribe for the algorithm and if\nyou'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at cycaxpodcast\ngmail.com thanks for listening"
