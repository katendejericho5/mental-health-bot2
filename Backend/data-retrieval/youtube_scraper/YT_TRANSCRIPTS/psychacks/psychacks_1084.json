    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nyou never really know what you give to\nothers\nso this is a lesson that i learned as a\nteacher\nbefore i became a psychologist i made my\nliving in new york city as a private\ntutor as a means of subsidizing my\nartistic ambitions\nand while i was a private tutor i worked\nwith hundreds of young people in middle\nschool and high school on a variety of\nsubjects some of these students i saw\nseveral times a week for years\nand we talked about latin conjugation\nand calculus integration\nand classical literature and everything\nin between\nand because i did this for over a decade\nit was often the case that young people\ni worked with would graduate and move on\nwith their lives\nand in many cases our paths would cross\nyears later\nand in the course of our catching up i\nwould be consistently surprised to learn\nwhat those students had remembered from\nour time together\nin every case\nthey had forgotten the latin\nthey had forgotten the calculus and they\nhad forgotten the classical literature\neverything that i thought i was there to\nteach them\nhad since faded in time\nbut what they did remember\nwas often some throwaway comment that i\nmade when i was leaving the room one day\nand never thought about twice\nfor whatever reason that comment really\nspoke to them\nand they've never been able to forget it\nall these years later and that\nwas what i taught them\nall the years i was working with them\nneither one of us really knew what i was\nteaching\nwe only learned that years later and it\nwas the student who taught me\nwhat he had learned\nand ironically\nit never had anything to do with what i\nwas ostensibly paid to teach\nit's interesting isn't it\nand i think this is generalizable to\nrelationships\nwe don't actually know what we give to\nother people\nit's for other people to decide what we\ngive them because it's for other people\nto decide what's of lasting value to\nthem\nand it's often the case that neither\nparticipant in a relationship knows the\nvalue of what was given or received\nuntil some time is passed\nand that's just the way it is\nwhat do you think\nremember to like and subscribe and\ncomment for the algorithm and if you'd\nlike to schedule a consultation you can\nreach me at psychexpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
