    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nnever want something for someone else\nmore than they wanted for themselves\nthis is a very very important principle\nand it's one that i put into practice\nevery day in the context of my clinical\nwork what does it mean\nmaybe you have a friend or a loved one\nwho is suffering maybe they're depressed\nmaybe they're on drugs maybe they're in\na bad relationship\nor maybe they're just not taking care of\nthemselves properly\nand you want them to improve to suffer\nless to be prosperous to have a good\nrelationship to generally clean up their\nact\nand those are good things to want for\nthe people that you love\nbut here's the thing\nwhat i've discovered is that in a given\nrelationship\nif one person cares more\nit kind of frees up the other one to\ncare less\nand if one person has to care more\nit needs to be the person with the\nproblem\ni've seen this dynamic play out over and\nover again in both my personal and my\nprofessional life\nwhen one person cares more it's kind of\nlike they do the caring for both people\nthey do the caring for the relationship\nit's similar to when one partner is\nclean and the other partner is messy it\nusually turns out that the clean person\nends up cleaning for two\nso the carer often ends up caring for\ntwo\nwhy should one person care when the\nother person is caring for both so the\ntrick\nis to take all that good will that you\nfeel\nand to kind of situate it deeper inside\nof your heart\nand to meet the person where they're at\nnot where you'd like them to be\nmy goal as a therapist is to want what\nmy clients want\na little less than they do\nso if they're not really motivated\ni'm even less motivated than they are\ni mean on some level why should i care\nif they're not motivated i'm not the one\nwho will suffer as a result of that lack\nof motivation the client will\nand if their suffering is not sufficient\nmotivation to take action i can't\nreasonably expect that my words will\nprove to be more effective than pain\ni'm never ahead of my clients\npulling them and dragging them to where\ni want them to go\ni'm always behind\nsupporting them in their decision to\nwalk in the direction of their chosen\ngoals\nand this is often very effective\nwhen people who are used to other people\ncaring more\nsuddenly encounter somebody who cares\nless\nthey increasingly learn that it's their\nresponsibility to carry that caring for\nthemselves\nand this can be a new experience for\nsome folks\nso there's generally a pain period\ninvolved as they develop this capacity\nbut it's worth it in the long run\nso i'm not telling you to not care about\npeople\nbut that sometimes caring can be\ncounterproductive you kind of have to\nlearn to care effectively to care in the\nright way\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at psych\nhackspodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
