    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is a\nlife and the concept of the game\nso this is something that i've given a\ngreat deal of thought to\nand i've come to understand this\nconstruct the game\nis a fundamental lens through which we\ncan view life and even existence itself\nlife is a series of nested games\nlet me explain what i mean by that\na game\nis anything with a goal\nand rules\nand anything with a goal and rules is a\ngame\nthat's it\nyou need both for a game to exist\nif you only have a goal and no rules\nthen you just have chaos and confusion\nand things tend towards dissolution\non the other hand if you only have rules\nand no goal\nthen things tend to become restrictive\nand ossified and that tends to strangle\nlife\nso at both extremes is death\ntoo much order is death and too much\nchaos is death\nbut if you put the goal in the context\nof a set of rules then you have a game\nand that's where life happens now when i\nsay that life is a game\ni'm not suggesting that life is trivial\nor frivolous games can be played very\nseriously and they could also be played\nwith very high stakes\nbut they remain games nonetheless\nlet me explain what i mean by way of an\nexample\nwhile we're alive we all have to play\nthe game of survival\nand one of the many rules of that game\nis that you have to keep 10 pints of\nblood inside of you at all times\nif you violate that rule you will lose\nthe game of survival you can argue about\nhow this shouldn't be the way that it is\nor that you wish it were different but\nthat's just how it is and we know that\nthrough observation that if you want to\ncontinue to play the game of survival\nyou have to keep at least 10 pints of\nblood inside of you that's why the 10\npints rule is a rule we derive the rule\nthrough induction\nnow survival isn't the only game we're\nplaying at any one time\nwithin the game of life are many\nmany many other games\nand we're often playing several of those\ngames simultaneously\nand this is one of the sources of a good\ndeal of misunderstanding and suffering\non this planet you can win one game\nwhile losing another and vice versa\nby way of example people can also play\nthe game of honor\nand one of the rules of that game is to\nuphold your duty and commitments if you\nviolate that rule you will lose the game\nof honor makes sense\nnow a person might find himself in a\nsituation where he is forced to choose\nwhich of several competing games he\nwants to win\nand which of several competing games\nhe's willing to lose\nfor instance this person might be in a\nsituation such that his best bet of\nkeeping those ten pints of blood inside\nof him is to betray his duty and flee\nfrom the front lines of battle\nin this case he would win the game of\nsurvival but lose the game of honor\non the other hand if he stays in fights\nhe might win the game of honor but lose\nthe game of survival he can win one or\nboth or lose one or both but he can't\navoid playing\nthe number of games\nis too many to mention there's the game\nof physics there's the game of chemistry\nthere's the game of relationships\nthere's the game of money there's the\ngame of sex there's the game of\nfriendship there's the game of health\nthere's the game of kindness\nand all of these games\nare nested inside of the overarching\ngame of being alive\nand we're playing many many many of\nthese games simultaneously whether we're\nconscious of it or not\nnow i'm going to talk more about the\nconcept of the game in the future and\ni'm putting this out as a general\nintroduction so people can understand\nwhere i'm coming from stay tuned\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nplease and if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\ncychaxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
