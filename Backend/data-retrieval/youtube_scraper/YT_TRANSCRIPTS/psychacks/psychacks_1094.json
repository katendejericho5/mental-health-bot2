    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nbeware of attraction proxies\nnow i've spoken to thousands of people\nin my tenure as a clinical psychologist\nand i'm consistently amazed by how many\npeople put faith in attraction proxies\nwhich is generally not a good idea so\nwhat is an attraction proxy an\nattraction proxy is something that a\nperson uses to secure love or sex in an\nindirect way\nperhaps the most common example of this\nis a man who is convinced that he will\nbe more successful with women if he has\nmore money\nin this case he's using money as an\nattraction proxy now it's certainly true\nthat broadly speaking having more money\nis preferable to having less money and\nthat access to resources generally will\nmake men attractive to a broader swath\nof women\nhowever it is definitely not true that\nsimply having money\nmakes men more successful with women\ni've worked with men who have become\nextremely wealthy and bought sports cars\nand extravagant apartments and who have\nbecome increasingly angry that these\nstrategies either a did little to\nnothing to effortlessly attract women to\nthem\nor b succeeded only in attracting women\nwho seem to care primarily about\nmaterial wealth i.e gold diggers and of\ncourse material wealth was the bait he\nwas using so it's kind of inappropriate\nfor him to complain that he caught the\nfish that was attracted to his bait\nthe point is that attraction proxies\ndon't reliably work\nso stop using indirect approaches\nsix-pack abs or a seven-figure bank\naccount or a flashy wardrobe can be nice\nbut they will not reliably and\neffortlessly attract women\nthose things will reliably do other\nthings but not that\nthe only way to reliably attract women\nis to get good at attracting women\nthe only way to reliably attract men is\nto get good at attracting men\nlearn the game of attraction and the art\nof seduction\nthis is the direct approach\nand this direct approach will not only\nsave you a great deal of time energy and\nmoney but it will increase your overall\nchances of getting what you want as well\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychexpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
