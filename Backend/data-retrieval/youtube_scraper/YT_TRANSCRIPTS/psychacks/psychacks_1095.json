    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nyou do not need to justify your life\nnow this talk will be a continuation of\na previous episode entitled the reason\nwhy you exist so you may want to check\nthat one out first if you haven't done\nso already\nlike disneyland\nlife is an opportunity to experience\nitself\nyou can't screw up a day at disneyland\nand in a certain sense you can't really\nscrew up your life\nyou just get to choose which rides you\ngo on i.e which experiences you choose\nto have\nso hopefully this metaphor will help to\nrelieve some of the pressure associated\nwith living correctly\nthat's it\nsometimes i talk with folks and they\nsuffer from what we might call\nexistential uncertainty\nthey're not sure why they're here or\neven if they should be here like whether\nthey deserve to exist at all\nand they feel as if they have to do\nsomething in order to justify that\nexistence\nthis could be getting married having\nchildren getting rich becoming\nsuccessful being loved and respected\nmaking their mark on history and or\nachieving something great and impressive\ni call these self-justification projects\nand they're all doomed to failure\nbecause you cannot solve an internal\nproblem with an external solution\nhowever\ni've got some good news for you\nconsider for a moment that your life is\nalready justified\nand why might that be because you're\nalready here\nyou're already inside the park\nat disneyland there are hundreds of\nworkers who are constantly employed in\nletting in those who should be in the\npark and keeping out those who shouldn't\nthere are fences and gates security and\nguards that exist to fulfill this\npurpose\ntherefore we can reasonably assume that\nanyone inside the park is there because\nthey had a ticket maybe they're not\nreally aware of the ticket because who\nreally thinks about their ticket after\nthey're inside but that doesn't mean\nthat they're not supposed to be there\nif you're inside the park it's safe to\nassume that you must have a ticket\nand if it's that hard to sneak into\ndisneyland which is just a theme park\nhow much harder do you think it would be\nto sneak into existence\nyou are not an exceptional oversight\nyou did not break and enter your way\ninto being and you are not the result of\nspiritual negligence\nif you're here it's safe to assume that\nyou should be now you might not remember\nbuying a ticket\nand that's because the ticket was likely\ngifted to you\nyou certainly didn't earn the ticket and\nyou you might not have existed\npreviously and there's no need to repay\nthe ticket as it was given as a gift of\ngrace\nand this is a relief because what could\nyou possibly do in life to repay the\ndebt associated with the opportunity to\nexist all the accomplishments and\nachievements in the world would not be\nsufficient\nit's not a debt that could be repaid\nwhich is why it's not a debt that must\nbe repaid\ni'd like you to consider that the ticket\nwas a gift of grace\nfreely given\nthat needn't be earned or repaid\nand that you must have been gifted one\nby virtue of your own existence\nsince only people with tickets are\nallowed inside the park\nso\nthis whole headache about proving that\nyou deserve to exist is totally\nunnecessary imagine spending the whole\nday at disneyland trying to justify that\nyou deserve to be spending the day there\ni mean i don't even know what that would\nlook like\nif you're already in the park there's\nnothing more that you need to do\nthough there might be plenty that you\nwant to experience while you're there\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
