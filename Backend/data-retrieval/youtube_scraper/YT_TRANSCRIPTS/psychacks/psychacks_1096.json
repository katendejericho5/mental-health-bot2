    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\napplied stoicism\ngood and bad\nso this is the first in a series of\nshort talks on applied stoicism which is\nwhat i call my adaptation of stoic\nphilosophy for the practice of clinical\npsychology\nand it all kind of begins with an\nunderstanding of the concepts good and\nbad\nyou know the older i get the more i'm\nforced to accept that much of what i\nlabel as good or bad\nis fundamentally egocentric\nfor lack of a better definition\ngood is when i get what i want\nand bad\nis when i don't get what i want or when\ni get what i don't want\ni want the world to exist in a certain\nway and when it does i call that good\nand when it doesn't i call that bad\ni can dress all this up in fancier\nlanguage and talk about ethics and\nphilosophies and moralities\nbut at the end of the day most of that\nis rationalization\nit's pretty rare for example for someone\nto not get what they want and call that\ngood\nirrespective of their professed beliefs\nnow\nthere is a silver lining to all this\nwhich is\ni'm in control of what i want\nremember wanting is free\ntherefore\nif good is getting what i want\nand i'm in control of what i want\nthen\nat least theoretically\ni can always experience the good\nsame thing with my aversion what i don't\nwant\nif bad is getting what i don't want and\ni'm in control of what i don't want\nthen at least theoretically i can never\nexperience the bad\nhowever this requires that i master my\nwanting\nmy capacities for desire and aversion\ni can practice desire in such a way that\ni can always get what i want\nwhich is good\nand i can practice aversion in a way\nthat i never get what i don't want which\nis bad\nand who wouldn't want to know how to do\nthis\nas for the actual practice i'll talk\nmore about that in future episodes so\nstay tuned\nwhat do you think do you think it's\npossible to always get what you want\nremember to like and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and if you'd like to schedule\na consultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast\ngmail.com\nthanks for listening"
