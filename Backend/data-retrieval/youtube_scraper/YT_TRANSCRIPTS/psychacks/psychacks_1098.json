    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nwe learn about ourselves in\nrelationships\nso there's this notion of identity that\nassumes that deep down\nwho we are is this sort of unchanging\ncrystalline entity\nthat who we are remains constant\nregardless of where we are who we're\nwith or what we're doing\nand i think that's a fairly\nphilosophical notion of identity that is\nbetrayed in the practice of our everyday\nlives\nthe fact of the matter is that who we\nare our experience of self\nchanges significantly based on where we\nare who we're with and what we're doing\nnow the fact that our experience of self\nis constantly shifting doesn't\nnecessarily mean that we're lying or\nacting\nit just means that in certain situations\ncertain parts of yourself are more\nsalient or relevant than others\nthink about your own experience\ndon't certain people seem to\ncall forth certain aspects of yourself\nlike maybe you feel more playful and\nseductive with this person or more\nserious and reserved with this other\nand aren't both different from how you\ntend to feel when you're alone\nthe fact of the matter is that your\nexperience of self in solitude isn't\nnecessarily truer or more real than your\nexperience of self in relationship\nin fact we primarily learn about\nourselves in relationship\ni don't pretend to know exactly how this\nworks i just know that it does\nrelationships pull\nlatent aspects of self out of your\npersonality structure\nthat may otherwise have remained long\ndormant\nrelationships give you a reason to\nactualize those latent aspects of self\nand as a result\nwe get to experience ourselves in a new\nway\nin a relationship to that specific\nindividual\nthat's a big part of why relationships\nare so fun\nand why they're non-repeatable\nyou can't have the same relationship\nwith two different people because\nyou're kind of two different people with\ntwo different people\nand to get a fuller more complete\nunderstanding of who we are it makes\nsense for us to have many different\nrelationships with many different kinds\nof people\nand that's because it's in relationships\nthat our otherwise latent potential\nbecomes manifest and actual\nin a very real way\nwe become ourselves more fully\nin relation to others\nwhat do you think have you experienced\nsomething similar\nremember to like and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and if you'd like to schedule\na consultation you can reach me at psych\nhackspodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
