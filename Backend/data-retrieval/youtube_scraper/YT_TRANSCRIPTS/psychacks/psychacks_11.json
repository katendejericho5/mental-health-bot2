    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why buy\nthe\ncow so if you weren't aware you should\nknow that I published my first book less\nthan two weeks ago it's called the value\nof others and it's the product of nearly\n10 years of deep critical thinking and\nresearch on the topic of mating and\ndating basically I attempt to provide a\nsingle model to explain the behavior of\nboth men and and women in the sexual\nMarketplace which is no easy task this\nbook does not simply compile my old\nepisode scripts it's overwhelmingly new\ncontent and I don't expect to discuss\nmuch of this content on the channel\nmoving forward however to give my\naudience a taste of what's in the book\nI'm going to put out a few episodes that\ntouch on ideas you'll find within its\nPages this is one of them so if you like\nwhat you hear please consider buying the\nebook audiobook or the paperback version\nlinks in the description below and be\nsure to listen to the end of this\nepisode for the big\nreveal all right why by the cow is the\nfirst half of a somewhat snarky\nobservation about dating that I'm sure\nyou all know namely Why by the cow if\nyou can get the milk for free this\ncomment alludes to men's observed\nhesitancy to provide additional\ncommitment or resources to a woman who\nis already providing him with sex since\nin general no one will pay more for the\nsame good when it can be acquired for\nLess men's hesitancy is less about\nemotional immaturity and more about\neconomic rationality and to be fair\nthere used to be a fair degree of Truth\nin this observation the operative words\nbeing used to be in point of fact this\nstatement no longer applies to the\ncurrent sexual Marketplace and\nattempting to implement its implied\nadvice I.E to make men pay for milk is\nunlikely to achieve the desired outcome\nlet me\nexplain it used to make sense that men\nwouldn't buy the cow when they can get\nthe milk for free however this truth\npresumes a Marketplace in which milk is\ngenerally\nsold if every other vendor in the\nmarketplace is selling milk and a buyer\ncan get the same or comparable milk\nwithout paying that is a great benefit\nto the buyer\nhe's basically securing a desirable good\nat a discount and since no one will pay\nmore for the same good when it can be\nacquired for Less it is very unlikely\nthat the buyer in question will\nvoluntarily Pony up more resources to\nsecure a good that he has already\nsucceeded in securing more cheaply this\nis why when this occurred in the past\nsuch buyers needed to be coerced or\nmanipulated into buying the cow if it\nwere rationally in their best interest\nto do so they certainly wouldn't have\nneeded to be shamed into action but\nhere's the thing we no longer operate in\na Marketplace in which milk is generally\nsold just look around you For Better or\nWorse we operate in a Marketplace in\nwhich milk is freely\ndistributed in today's day and age sex\nprecedes commitment and in a Marketplace\nfull of free samples you can't\nreasonably expect to charge for a taste\nunder such incentives the question is\nnot why by the cow when you can get the\nmilk for free it is why by the cow if\nyou have to pay for the\nmilk if buyers have a choice between\nbuying the cow or buying the cow and the\nmilk why would they pursue the latter\noption it's too expensive as there are\nnow two incurred costs instead of one\nlike what is so special about your milk\nthat you can possibly expect people to\npay for it when vendors all around you\nare handing out free\nsamples you can argue about whether this\nis how things should be until you're\nblue in the face but it's not going to\nchange anything this is the reality of\nthe Contemporary sexual Marketplace and\nit's probably not going to change\nanytime soon what this means is that in\nthe vast majority of cases when women\nattempt to make men pay for milk all\nthey do is succeed in pricing themselves\nout of the sexual Marketplace this is\nbecause they are functionally demanding\na higher price point for a comparable\ngood that can be acquired more cheaply\nelsewhere now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause its Word of Mouth referrals like\nthis that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've derived from this\nepisode I'm also writing original cont\ncontent for my free newsletter every\nweek you can sign up on my website if\nyou're so inclined finally please fill\nout an inquiry form on my website if\nyou're interested in booking a paid\nconsultation the links to everything I\njust discussed are in the description\nbelow please check them out as this is\nyour way to support this Channel and its\nMission I really appreciate it thank\nyou in the modern day women need to\nunderstand that insisting on commitment\nprior to sex is equivalent to selling a\ncar\nwithout\nwheels what does that mean the fact that\na car has wheels does not motivate\nanyone to buy a car this is because we\nexpect cars to come with wheels you do\nnot secure a sale by providing Wheels\nwith your car however a car without\nwheels significantly demotivates anyone\nfrom buying you functionally ensure that\nyou will not secure a sale by not\nproviding Wheels with your car providing\nwheels does not help help you but not\nproviding wheels absolutely hurts\nyou attempting to sell a car without\nwheels for the same price as a car with\nwheels would be\nMadness you would be priced out of the\nmarketplace and no one would buy it you\ncould only sell a car without wheels at\na significant discount to offset the\ntotal cost to the buyer of acquiring a\nfully functional automobile that's the\nonly way you could sell that car by the\nsame token insisting on commitment prior\nto sex in a Marketplace in which sex is\nfreely given prior to commitment is to\ninsist on a much higher price point for\na comparable good that can be acquired\nmore cheaply elsewhere and since they\nare apparently not interested in\ntransacting at a discount like our\nwheeless car owners such women price\nthemselves out of the marketplace unless\nthey provide something of additional\nvalue to the man that offsets the\nrelatively higher cost of their sexual\nopportunity and that their inter seexual\ncompetition either cannot or will not\nprovide that was complicated so I'll say\nit again such women price themselves out\nof the sexual Marketplace unless they\nprovide something of additional value to\nthe man that offsets the relatively\nhigher cost of their sexual opportunity\nand that their in seexual competition\neither can not or will not\nprovide and the only thing that really\nmeets all of those\ncriteria is\nPurity in today's sexual Marketplace\nwomen can realistically only put their\nsexual opportunities behind the pay wall\nof commitment if they are virgins or\nhave an extremely low body count this is\nbecause men highly value Purity in no\nsmall part because it's getting harder\nand harder to find and this might offset\nthe relatively higher cost of the sexual\nopportunity however the more women\nparticipate in the sexual Marketplace\nthe less they will be able to provide\nthis compensatory good in general the\nolder they get the less effective the\nstrategy becomes for any given\nwoman so if the question is now why buy\nthe cow if you have to pay for the milk\nhow do women differentiate themselves in\na sexual Marketplace in which sex\nprecedes\ncommitment well if everyone is is\nhanding out milk you stay competitive by\noffering the richest creamiest milk\naround I've already said this in other\nways in other episodes milk exists on a\nspectrum from tasteless skim to Rich\nheavy cream and I'm telling you ladies\nonce a man gets a taste of cream he will\nnot want to go back to skim more than\nanything else this will motivate a man\nto take that cow off the market to\nensure that he has exclusive access to\nthat frothy delicious leche he will not\nwant any other men in his\nDairy however if all a cow produces is\ntasteless skim there is absolutely no\nneed for a man to take that cow off the\nmarket because he knows that no other\nguy is going to do it just keeping it\nreal okay thanks for watching all the\nway to the end of the episode so what's\nthe big reveal the big reveal is that\nthe idea presented in this one episode\nconstitutes just a few paragraphs of my\n432 page book another way to say the\nsame thing is that my book the value of\nothers is equivalent to 500 unreleased\nfulllength psyx episodes it is packed\nfull of unflinching truths about the\nsexual Marketplace and the game of\nmating and dating so if you like what\nyou heard here today I would highly\nencourage you to get your hands on a\ncopy again the links are in the\ndescription what do you think does this\nfit with your own experience let me know\nin the comments below and as always I\nappreciate your support and thank you\nfor listening"
