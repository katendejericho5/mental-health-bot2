    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nthe sexual double standard\nso basically the sexual double standard\nis that it is acceptable or considered a\npositive for a man to have multiple\nsexual partners\nbut that is unacceptable or considered a\nnegative for a woman to have multiple\nsexual partners\nnow i believe this is a real thing it is\na double standard and it does exist in\nreality and i believe that a lot of this\ndouble standard is culturally determined\nbut\nnot in the way that most people think\nand i'm going to explain what i mean by\nthat\nusing the framework of behavioral\neconomics\nit kind of goes like this\nthe outcome that can be accomplished\nthrough no action\nwill always be valued less\nthan the outcome that can only be\nachieved through the application of\nskill and effort this is inherently true\npeople don't become better richer\nstronger etc by doing nothing\nthey generate value through the\napplication of effort and skill\nreasonable enough right\nnow\nlet's apply this principle to the topic\nunder consideration\nif a man does nothing\nhe does not have sex\nthe average guy can sit alone at a bar\nday after day\nweek after week month after month and he\nwill be approached by\nno one\nnot complaining because there are pros\nand cons to this just stating the fact\nto my knowledge\nno culture in human history has ever\ncelebrated\nmale virginity\nand i think it's for this reason a man\ncan do nothing and remain a virgin\nso it can't really be celebrated\nfor a man to acquire a sexual partner\nwhich is to say for a man to be sexually\nselected by a woman\nthis requires more effort and skill than\nwe are generally than we generally would\nlike to admit both in the short-term\nprocess of seduction and in the\nlong-term process of mate selection\nnow compare this with the experience of\na woman\nhow long would she be able to sit alone\nat a bar undisturbed\nnow\ni'm not saying that she'll be approached\nby the person she would prefer to be\napproached by\nhowever i am saying that she will likely\nbe approached by someone sooner as\nopposed to later\nin fact some women are prepositioned\nboth in direct and indirect ways\nmany times a day\nevery day of their lives\nsurrendering to every man who would have\nher doesn't require as much skill and\neffort as say appropriately filtering\nher options\nand discerning the high value men who\nmight be the best investments of her\ninherently limited time and energy\nand discernment is a skill that requires\nsome experience and let's say social\nsavviness\nbecause it requires effort and skill not\nto believe every tom dick and harry who\ncrosses her path with a proposition\nvalue is created in a woman's reticence\nso the situation is reversed for men\naction is generally required to make\nsomething happen\nand for women inaction is needed to\nprevent the squandering of her resources\nand this is especially true for people\nin their 20s when a lot of pairing\noccurs and here's the kicker this isn't\nactually inherent to men and women per\nse\nrather it's a reflection of the observed\ndistribution of perceived value and\noptionality behavioral economics for\ninstance you'll find the same thing in\nbusiness\nthose with no money have to hustle to\nget it\nthose with money have to find a way to\nresist squandering it on everyone with a\ntwo-bit investment opportunity who comes\ntheir way\nso the sexual double standard is largely\ncultural but not in the way that people\nthink it's not simply a superficial\nattitude like a belief\nthat can be changed with education and\nawareness\nit's deeply embedded in the rules that\ngovern who approaches whom\nwho propositions whom\nand who is valued for what and these\nrules probably aren't changing anytime\nsoon\nuntil the day arrives when it is it is\nas easy for an average man to find a\nwilling sexual partner\nas it is for a woman to find the same\nthe sexual double standard will exist\nand it will exist because of behavioral\neconomics\nthe value added through effort and skill\na key that can open any lock is a good\nkey\nbut a lock that any key can open\nis a bad lock\nso those are my two cents\nwhat do you think i understand that this\ncan be a sensitive subject for people so\nplease be respectful and tolerant in the\ncomment section remember to subscribe\nand hit that like button for the\nalgorithm and if you'd like to schedule\na consultation you can reach me at\npsychexpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
