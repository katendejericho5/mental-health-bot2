    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nthe position of the adored\nthis is a continuation of my episode on\nthe balance of attraction so if you're\nnew to this channel you may want to\nstart there\nin this episode we'll be talking about\nthe position of the adored which in\nromantic relationships is the one who\nlikes the other\nless\nnow first off i'd like to begin by\nsaying that the adored often get a bad\nrap what do you mean the one that likes\nthe other less how cold and cruel and\nheartless\nright\nhowever\nthe fact of the matter is that the two\npositions create each other\nliking the other less\ncreates the opportunity for the adorer\nto like the other\nmore\nwhich is actually where some people\nprefer to be\nit's kind of like how taking isn't\nnecessarily selfish because it actually\ngives others the opportunity to give\nand many people are actually far more\ncomfortable giving than taking\nnow obviously this dynamic can be taken\nto some pretty unpleasant extremes like\nin codependent relationships or\nrelationships with personality\ndisordered individuals however the\nfundamental truth remains constant even\nwithin so-called mature high functioning\nrelationships remember the two positions\nare actually value neutral and there are\npros and cons to each\nthe adored get to be loved by the ones\nthey're with\ngenerally those in this position tend to\nhave a much more emotionally\nequilibrated experience than you those\nin the position of the adorer they don't\nexperience the same highs and lows as\nthe adorers which makes this position a\nbetter fit for those who prefer not to\nlive as much in their emotions\nit can also be a good fit for those who\nfor whatever reason are not as\ninterested in placing romantic\nrelationships in the center of their\nlives\npeople who are more focused on their\ncareer for instance can't really afford\nto be an emotional roller coaster\nthey can appreciate the partner but\nbecause they aren't\nas emotionally preoccupied with the\nother they tend to experience a greater\nsense of internal freedom within that\nrelationship\non the other hand being in the position\nof the adored\ncan be somewhat boring\nthese folks generally don't experience\nthe feeling of being in love as\nintensely they're not with the ones that\nthey love they're they're loved by the\nones that they're with\nwhich can make them feel like they're\nmissing out or settling\nit can also feel strange to be put on a\npedestal because of the gap between the\nother's perception of you\nand your own self-knowledge\nunless you're narcissistically grandiose\nyou're kinda aware of your shortcomings\nwhich means that you're gonna kind of\nfeel like you're participating in\nunreality when someone loves you more\nthan you love yourself\n[Music]\nfiguring out which position feels better\nfor you\nand determining your ideal gap in\nsubjective attraction requires\nexperience and accurate self-knowledge\nsome people prefer the balance of\nattraction to be as close to equal as\npossible\nothers prefer rather sizable gaps\njust keep in mind that it's often the\ncase that the very things that attract\nyou to a person at the beginning are the\nsame things that drive you crazy in the\nend so\nchoose wisely\ni hope you found this useful\nuh please drop a comment below and if\nyou'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psychaxpodcast\ngmail.com thanks for listening"
