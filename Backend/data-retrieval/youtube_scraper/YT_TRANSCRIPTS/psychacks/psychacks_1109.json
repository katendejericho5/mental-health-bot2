    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nstop what hurts you first\nthis is something that is extremely\nuseful to do before seeking out\nprofessional help\nand yet i see folks not doing this time\nand time again in my own clinical\npractice and why is this problematic\nbecause in the vast majority of cases\nimprovement is less a question of\nstarting 10 new good habits as it is\nstopping the one or two things that are\ndirectly related to causing the problem\noften just stopping these one or two\nthings is enough to resolve the issue no\nfurther action is required and the truth\nis\nyou probably already know the one or two\nthings you would need to stop without\npaying someone to tell you what they are\nas hippocrates said before you heal\nsomeone\nask him if he's willing to give up the\nthings that make him sick\nfor example a person might come to me\ncomplaining of high levels of anxiety or\neven a history of panic attacks and in\nthe course of treatment it comes out\nthat he's drinking six or seven units of\nalcohol on a nightly basis now if you\ndon't know this alcohol is a\nneurodepressant it inhibits the\nsympathetic nervous system\nand in its attempts to restore\nhomeostasis the body stimulates the\nsympathetic nervous system\nto work more intensely to counteract the\neffects of the substance so that when\nthe alcohol intoxication eventually\nwears off the sympathetic nervous system\nno longer has an inhibitor to push\nagainst and it feels like it's kicked\ninto overdrive and in many respects the\nfelt experience of elevated sympathetic\nresponse is functionally\nindistinguishable from anxiety\nand so now the question is complicated\nis this person legitimately dealing with\nan anxiety disorder or is he attempting\nis he experiencing the withdrawal\nsyndrome\nof acute alcohol intoxication\nand until the individual makes an\nattempt to abstain from alcohol for a\nwhile there's really no way to resolve\nthis ambiguity and it's hard to create\nan effective treatment plan if the\nactual problem hasn't yet been reliably\nidentified\nand this is something that a person in\nmost cases could have done on his own\nbefore contracting with a therapist as\nhard as it is\nwhy not try to go two weeks without\ndrinking and observe its effect on the\nanxiety best case scenario hey\ni'm not getting as anxious maybe i need\nto focus on restricting my alcohol\nintake as opposed to seeking help for\npanic attacks\non the other hand if that person were to\nstop drinking for two weeks only to find\nno change in his anxiety levels then\nthat would be very useful information\nfor any therapist he may choose to\nengage to treat the anxiety because now\nthe individual can say to the\nprofessional look i tried this this and\nthis\ndidn't actually work what else you got\nthis will help make that session way\nmore useful effectively giving you more\nbang for your buck and increasing the\nlikelihood that you're both on the same\nthat you're both on the right track so\nif possible try to stop what hurts you\nbefore seeking out professional help\nwhat do you think\nremember to like and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and if you'd like to schedule\na consultation you can reach me at\ncychaxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
