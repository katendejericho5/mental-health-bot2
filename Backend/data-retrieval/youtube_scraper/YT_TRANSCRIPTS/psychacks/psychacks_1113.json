    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nyou are paying more than you need to\nand the more successful you are\nthe truer this statement becomes so what\ndo i mean by this\na metaphor i often use with clients is\nthat work is an auction house you ever\nbeen to an auction house there's\nsomething for sale people are bidding\nand the lot ultimately goes to whoever\noffers the highest amount\nokay\nif you win in an auction house\nit means you overpaid\nwhy\nbecause by definition\nyou were the only person in that room\nwho thought that lot was worth that much\nno one else thought it was that valuable\nand that's why you won\non some level overpaying is the price\nyou pay to secure the privilege of\nwinning\nhowever in the vast majority of cases\nyou probably could have bought the same\nlot with less money\nthe issue is of course that you don't\nknow how much less money you could have\nused to buy that lot it could have been\na dollar less it could have been a\nmillion dollars less but you almost\ncertainly could have saved some money on\nthat transaction\nand this excessive spending isn't that\nbig of a deal if you're only going to\nthe auction house every once in a while\nbut if you're going there every single\nday to bid on multiple lots like at your\njob\nthe extent to which you're overpaying\ncan create a significant liability for\nyou over time because you don't have\ninfinite resources you have a finite\nstore of time energy and money\nand if you're overpaying on 10 lots that\nmight mean that you're not going to be\ncompetitive for the 11th\nso what does this have to do with work\nbasically it means that if you're\nwinning\nif you're successful\nif things are going smoothly\nit might mean that you're over bidding\nyou could potentially secure the same\nresults\nwith less time and effort\nand the only way to figure out the\nextent to which you're over bidding\nis to systematically experiment with\nyour time and effort investments\npull back a little bit and see what\nhappens\nobviously you need to use your good\njudgment here don't experiment on a\ncritical project or an essential\nresponsibility\ntarget less important components of work\nfirst\nremove some of your time and effort\nfocus on satisficing as opposed to\noptimizing\nand observe the result\ndid anybody even notice\ndid this titration create a problem for\nanyone else\nhuh\nmaybe i had this idea in my mind about a\ncertain standard of quality or\nproficiency that i needed to demonstrate\nin order to secure a successful result\nand maybe that standard simply exists in\nmy own head\nmaybe it's not necessarily true huh well\nin what other aspects of my work or life\nam i overpaying in terms of time energy\nor emotional investment in order to get\nthe same result\nand when we begin to be a bit more\ndeliberate and systematic about how we\nchoose to allocate our time and energy\nthen we actually liberate some of those\nresources to be productively invested in\nother aspects of our lives which makes\nour lives not just our work more varied\ninteresting and successful something to\nkeep in mind and remember that if\npulling back really does create an issue\ntrust that people will let you know\nit's just like in sports unless the foul\nis really flagrant the ref isn't going\nto go straight for the red card usually\nit's just a whistle\nand if you don't hear anything assume\nthe ball is still in play\nwhat do you think have you experimented\nwith this idea in your own life\nremember to like and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and if you'd like to schedule\na consultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
