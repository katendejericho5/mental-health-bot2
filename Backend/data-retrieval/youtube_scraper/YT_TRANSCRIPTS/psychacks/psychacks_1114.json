    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nhave to\nversus\nchoose to\nso this phrase have to is one that i've\ntried my best to\nexcise from my vocabulary\nthis is because i discovered that when i\nbelieve that i have to do something\nwhatever that something is becomes\nonerous aversive and unpleasant\nit's like in high school when i was\nassigned some of the classics of english\nliterature\nif i had spontaneously chosen to read\nthose books on my own i probably would\nhave enjoyed them much more than i did\nreading them under duress\nmy enjoyment had more to do with the\nattitude with which i was approaching\nthat assignment than it did with the\nactual books themselves\nmaybe you can relate\nthe fact of the matter is that there are\nvery few things in life that we have to\ndo\nusually when we think we have to do\nsomething what we really mean is that we\nwould prefer not to experience the\nconsequences of not doing it but that is\nalways an option for us\nwhenever i catch myself using this\nphrase i have to\ni try to replace it with the phrase i\nchoose to\nand to do this i have to connect the\nduty responsibility or assignment\nto my own personally relevant goals\nit's a small change but it's a powerful\none\nfor instance it's not so much that i\nhave to read this book because my\nteacher told me to\nit's that i choose to read this book\nbecause it it's a means to get what i\nwant\na desired degree which will further my\ncareer\nit's not so much that i have to pay my\ntaxes\nno i don't i can go to prison\nso when i catch myself complaining that\ni have to pay my taxes for instance i\nreformulate that thought to be that i'm\nchoosing to avoid a prison sentence\nand if it costs me x amount of dollars\nto avoid that outcome i'm going to do so\nwith alacrity my freedom is worth much\nmore than that amount of money so i'm\nactually getting the better deal here\nperforming this cognitive kung fu\nrequires a bit of mental discipline\nbut try replacing the phrase have to\nwith choose to and see how this impacts\nhow you show up to your own lived\nexperience\nhave you tried this out what's your\nexperience\nremember to subscribe and hit that like\nbutton for the algorithm and if you'd\nlike to schedule a consultation you can\nreach me at cychexpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
