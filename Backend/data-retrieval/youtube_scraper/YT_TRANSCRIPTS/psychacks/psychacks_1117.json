    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is\nhow to keep your cool\nwhen someone makes you angry\nnot easy for even the best of us to do\nright\nthe important thing to keep in mind here\nis that offense is taken\nit's not given\nthe truth of this statement is actually\nsupported by our idiom concerning\noffense namely\ni take offense of that sir\nit's not so much that the other person\nis giving it\nas it is that we choose to take it that\nway\nand here's how we know this to be true\nif you've ever had the displeasure of\nactually having an enemy that is someone\nwho is openly and unapologetically\nantagonistic towards you someone who is\noften trying to provoke you with their\nlanguage you know\nthat you have some measure of control\nover whether or not they are successful\nfor example if you can't avoid\ninteracting with this person you may\nchoose to give yourself a pep talk\nbeforehand reminding yourself not to\ntake the provocations personally\nit's okay\nwe don't have to engage\nand often\nyou see some measure of success with\nthat strategy such individuals our\nenemies may be unabashedly trying to\ngive offense\nbut if you enter into such an\ninteraction mindfully you can guard\nyourself against taking it\nand if you succeed in not taking it you\ndon't get offended\nit's actually not possible for those who\nintend offense to give offense\nwithout the complicit ascent of the\noffended party\nand\nin point of fact i found that the vast\nmajority of offense taking occurs not\nwith those who intend it\nbut with those who don't\nin most cases people aren't actively\ntrying to provoke us\nto give offense however it can be taken\nnonetheless\nthis is important because if we can\nunderstand\nthat taking offense requires our\ncomplicity\nthen we enjoy some measure of control\nover it\noffensiveness\nis a judgment that we complain that we\nconflate or confuse with certain verbal\nbehavior and that judgment not the\nbehavior and certainly not the intention\nbehind the behavior is primarily\nresponsible for our taking offense our\njudgment that this is offensive as\nopposed to the actual words or tone\nutilized if we remove this judgment of\noffensiveness then no offense can be\ntaken it's just a non-starter and this\nhelps us to remain equilibrated in the\nguardians of our own emotional states\neven we're in when we're in let's say\nsticky situations\nsomething to consider if you like what\nyou heard\nplease remember to like and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
