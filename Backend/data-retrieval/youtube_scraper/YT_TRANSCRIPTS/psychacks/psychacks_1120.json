    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nthe truth about romantic love\nunobtainability\nso this is the first in a series of\nepisodes in which i hope to expose some\nof the lesser-known and darker aspects\nof romantic love\nin a previous episode i discussed the\norigins of romantic love\nthey were in the secularization of the\ndogma of a persecuted pagan sect known\nas the cathars who existed in the\nprovence region of france in the 11th\nand 12th centuries a.d\nnow one of the main reasons romantic\nlove took off\nwas that many members of the powerful\naristocracy that existed in that time\nand place like the knights of the\nchivalric order were also secretly\nmembers of the cathar sect\nand these nobles did much to preserve\nthe principles of romantic love and to\npromote its practice across europe\nso we actually talk about chivalry and\nromance in the same breath for good\nreason some of the first practitioners\nof romantic love were the chivalric\nknights\nnow it's important to understand how\nromantic love existed within the\nchivalric code as many of these\nprinciples continue to exert an\ninvisible influence on romantic\nrelationships today\nback in the day\nevery chivalric knight\nchose one woman to be the object of his\ndesire\nso in traditional romantic love the man\nis always in the position of the adorer\nand the woman is always in the position\nof the adored\nit's never the other way around\nif you need a refresher on these terms\ncheck out my episode on the balance of\nattraction the chivalric code demanded\nthat the male knight voluntarily place\nhimself in a position of adoration\nrelative to a specific woman who is\ngenerally a noble occupying a higher\nposition in the social hierarchy\nthe knight placed this woman on an\nemotional pedestal\nsaying of her often exaggerated virtues\nand dedicated to her the fruits of his\nlabor sound familiar\nbut here's the catch\nand the part that has largely been lost\nin time\nthe woman in question\nwas always married to another man\nthis is so important that i'll say it\nagain the woman\nthe shiva rick knight chose to love\nwas always married to another man\nthis arrangement ensured that the adored\nfunctionally remained unobtainable which\nis actually an essential feature of\nromantic love\nand why might this be\nthe knights believed that unconsummated\nlove was\npurer than the consummated variety\nremember romance is the secularization\nof the dogma of the cathar cult and\ncathar means pure these guys were really\ninto the idea of purity\nby selecting an unobtainable lady\na married woman of higher social status\nas the object of their devotion\nthe chivalric knights protected the\ndignity of their love from being sullied\nby the carnality of sex and the banality\nof marriage that's right the romantics\nwere also opposed to marriage which was\na sacrament of the catholic church the\ncathar's erstwhile persecutors\nfurthermore the unobtainability of the\nadored also ensured that the game of\nlove could be played indefinitely\nwhether we like to admit it or not much\nof the pleasure and excitement of the\ngame of love comes in the pursuit of the\nbeloved\nactually catching the pursuit ends the\ngame or at least changes the game\nsignificantly\nso if you enjoy playing the game of love\nit makes sense to choose an object of\ndesire well beyond your reach\nthat way the pursuit never has to end\nand you can keep feeling all the feels\nromantic love thrives in conditions\nwhere the adored is unobtainable and i\nthink you'll find this to be true in\nyour own experience the moments when you\nexperience the most intense feelings of\nromantic love probably involved a\na large gap in social status or\nattraction\nor b\nan unrequited one-sided affection\nboth of these facilitate the\nunobtainability of the adored\nromantic love is not about sex and it's\nnot about marriage it's about feeling a\ncertain kind of emotion\na pure and heartfelt longing for the\nother\nit's a sweet and melancholy pang whose\npains are upset by the supposed nobility\nand righteousness afforded to the ever\nhopeful devotee\nwhat do you think about all this\ndrop a comment below and if you'd like\nto schedule a consultation you can reach\nme at cycaxpodcast gmail.com and\nremember to hit that like button and\nsubscribe for the algorithm thanks for\nlistening"
