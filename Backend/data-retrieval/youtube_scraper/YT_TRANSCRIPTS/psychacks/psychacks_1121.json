    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\ncatastrophic thought cascades\nso this is a term that i coined to\ndescribe the cognitive phenomena that\ngenerally precede the experience of\nbeing emotionally hijacked it's core to\nthe experience and syndrome of panic\ndisorders but we can also see it in play\nwhen people fly off the handle and rage\nor sink into a deep dark despair\nbasically they precede nearly every\nsudden and intense emotional reaction\na catastrophic thought cascade is a\nseries of imagined events that appear to\nbe strongly linked by causality if\nviewed only through the lens of the\nemotion that produced it\nthese thought cascades also tend to lead\npeople to some pretty dark places hence\ncatastrophic\nnow in the beginning it can subjectively\nfeel like you go from zero to 8 million\nin a blink of an eye\nthat's your phenomenological experience\nhowever\nif we begin to apply greater mindful\nawareness to our own mental processes\nthat increased attention has the effect\nof slowing down the subjective\nexperience of time\nmindful awareness can dilate the moment\nin which the emotional hijacking occurs\nand we can come to see that many many\nmany things actually happen in that\nblink of an eye\nthe idea here is to expand that moment\nby observing the chain of events in\norder to give ourselves the opportunity\nto get in there and disrupt the thought\ncascade before it hits catastrophic\nproportions\nagain any one link in the chain of the\nthought cascade will appear valid when\nviewed through the lens of the emotion\nthat produced it so the work here is to\nchallenge that apparent validity by\noffering reasonable counter factuals\nthat derail the progress toward imagined\ncatastrophe and of course this will be\neasier to do earlier in the process when\nwe aren't as ensnared by emotion\nfor instance\nsome people might interpret not\nreceiving a timely response to a text\nmessage\nas a sign that the other person is mad\nat them\nwhich can stimulate a feeling of\ninsecurity that can extrapolate a whole\nseries of imagined events culminating in\nthe heartbreaking end of a cherished\nrelationship\nall\nin the blink of an eye\nthis in turn can lead to a host of\nmaladaptive behaviors that will\ngenerally degrade the quality of the\nrelationship one way or the other\nof course if the cascade is allowed to\nreach its ultimate destination the\nemotion will feel so immediate and valid\nthat only emotional coping skills would\nbe appropriate at that time however if\nthose people were to slow down their\ncognitive processes through mindful\nattention\nthey may be able to offer reasonable\ncounter factuals to disrupt this process\nideally as early as the initial\nprecipitating interpretation\nfor example\nmaybe the other person isn't actually\nangry at them\nmaybe\nhe's just busy and hasn't had a moment\nto formulate an appropriate response yet\nor maybe the other person actually is\nangry but that this could lead to a\nconversation instead of a big blowout\nfight etc\nthe point is that every link in a\nthought cascade is potentially an\nopportunity for intervention\nyou'll get better at doing this and\nbetter at doing this quickly remember\nyou generally only have a second or two\nto get in there with practice so hang in\nthere\ndo you have an experience with\ncatastrophic thought cascades drop a\ncomment below and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psycaxpodcast gmail.com talk to you\nsoon"
