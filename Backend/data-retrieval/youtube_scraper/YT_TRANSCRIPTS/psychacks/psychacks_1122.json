    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\ncovert contracts\nas the name suggests a covert contract\nis a quid pro quo that is not revealed\nto the other party\nnow on the surface this arrangement\nmight seem somewhat silly i mean if you\ndon't explicitly negotiate a trade with\nanother person how can you reasonably\nexpect to get what you hope to receive\nin that transaction this will only\nhappen rarely and kind of by accident\ni think we probably all understand this\nintellectually however in practice many\nof our relationships both personal and\nprofessional are subject to these covert\ncontracts every day of our lives\nfor example a very common professional\ncovert contract\nis\nthat if i consistently go above and\nbeyond my contractual obligations this\neffort will be recognized appreciated\nand rewarded\nthat is not necessarily true at all in\nmany cases in fact this behavior has the\nopposite effect from management's\nperspective your hard work might create\na low-cost high-benefit solution for\nthem which will increase the likelihood\nthat you will remain in that role\nas promoting you will require replacing\nyour previous position with a person\nwhose labor exhibits a higher cost\nbenefit ratio to management\nbut people routinely burn themselves out\nat work in the service of this covert\ncontract and feel resentful and\nexploited when things don't go their way\nthere are also tons of covert contracts\nin the world of dating\nwhat i like to call nice guy syndrome\nfor instance is dominated by the idea of\noften disavowed quid pro quo\narrangements\nif i buy her dinner and help her move\nand demonstrate that i don't just want\nsex like all the other guys and value\nher emotionally psychologically and\nspiritually\nthen i will be rewarded with sex and\ncompanionship\ni'm not saying that any of those\nbehaviors are bad or wrong in and of\nthemselves\nbut that they're ineffective in\nachieving the nice guy's ultimate goal\nfor instance women generally want to be\nvalued by the men they like\nbut a man's valuation\nwill not typically cause a woman to like\nhim\nbut men routinely work to prove\nthemselves to the women to whom they are\nretracted\nto whom they are attracted and feel\nresentful and exploited when things\ndon't go their way\nthe fact of the matter is that gifts\nrecognition respect love sex affection\nare always given at the pleasure of the\ngiver\nthere's nothing you can do to earn a\ngift\nyou can earn a reward but you cannot\nearn a gift\notherwise like by definition it's no\nlonger a gift\nunsurprisingly you are much more likely\nto receive gifts if you give gifts\nyourself\nthe trick is to overcome the urge to\ngive in order to receive and to\ncultivate more and more a pleasure in\ngiving it's a kind of generosity of\nspirit\nthis will help you achieve greater\noutcome independence which will create\nthe condition necessary for others to\nfeel like they can give freely and\nspontaneously themselves\nso how do you let go of covert contracts\nthere are really only two ways either\nyou cultivate the courage to negotiate\nfor what you want with others more\nexplicitly\nor you work to divest yourself of\nunjustified expectations of others and\nthis is probably a both and solution as\nopposed to an either or solution you'll\nknow that you're on the right track if\nyou begin to notice a reduction in the\nfrequency and intensity of your anger\nand disappointment\ntry it out for yourself\ngot some thoughts on the matter drop a\ncomment below and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat cycaxpodcast gmail.com talk to you\nsoon"
