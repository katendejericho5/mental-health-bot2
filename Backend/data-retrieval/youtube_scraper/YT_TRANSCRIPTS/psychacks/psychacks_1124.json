    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nthe balance of attraction\nthe balance of attraction is a concept\nthat i came up with to explain certain\nemotional dynamics within romantic\nrelationships\nthe concept is predicated on a\nfundamental axiom which is\nno two people can like each other\nexactly the same amount\nseems reasonable enough yeah no two\npeople can like each other exactly the\nsame amount\nnow one of the corollaries of this axiom\nis that\nin any romantic relationship\none person likes the other more\nand one person likes the other less\nif you accept that attraction is unequal\nthis conclusion is inescapable\nwe can call the person who likes the\nother more\nthe adorer\nand the person who likes the other less\nthe adored\nthe adorer\nand the adored\nadorers get to be with the one they love\nand the adored get to be loved by the\nones there with i'm going to say that\nagain adorers get to be with the one\nthey love\nand the adored get to be loved by the\nones they're with\nit's not possible for one person to\noccupy both of these positions\nsimultaneously\nthat said in any given relationship it's\ncertainly possible for each person to\nvacillate between these two positions\nfrom day to day or even from moment to\nmoment\nhowever it is also generally the case\nthat over time\nthe dynamics of a given relationship\ntend to become fairly established\nthat is in most relationships there is\nthe person who tends to occupy the\nposition of the adorer more often\nand there is the person who tends to\noccupy the position of the adored more\noften\nand here's the thing\nthese two positions are actually value\nneutral\nit's not better to be the adored than\nthe adorer and vice versa there are pros\nand cons to each position it may not\nseem that way but as we'll see in future\nepisodes the desirability of any one\nposition is really based on two things\nwhat a given person is looking for in a\nrelationship\nand which provides a better fit for that\nperson's personality and temperament\nso stay tuned\ngot some thoughts on the matter feel\nfree to drop a comment below and if\nyou'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psycaxpodcast\ngmail.com thanks for listening"
