    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is fouling\nis part of the game\nso it's easiest to introduce this\nconcept through the metaphor of sports\ndo you think that a basketball team\ncould be competitive in the nba\nif they made an organizational\ncommitment never to commit a foul\nthat is if they were to commit to\nplaying by the rules of the game as\nstrictly and honorably as possible\nit would be almost inconceivable for\nsuch a team to remain competitive\nagainst other organizations of\ncomparable talent and ability that\ndidn't restrict themselves so\nunnecessarily the fact of the matter is\nthat the top players\nknow the rules of the game\nintimately\nand\nthey also know when to break these rules\nstrategically\nfouling is part of the game\nif you refuse to foul out of principle\nthen you are condemning yourself to\nsub-optimal outcomes\nnow just to be clear i'm not suggesting\nthat you foul randomly or flagrantly\nhowever i am very much encouraging you\nto foul purposefully and intelligently\nwe need to exercise prudence and\ndiscretion here and to strive for\nmoderation\ntoo much rule following and obedience\ncan be just as counterproductive as too\nmuch rule breaking and disobedience\noptimization lies in the sweet spot\nsomewhere between the two extremes\nbut what do you think feel free to drop\na comment below and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat cycaxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
