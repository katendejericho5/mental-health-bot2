    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic today's short talk is Strike when\nthe iron is cold so this is a tactic\nthat I started to implement several\nyears ago and it has been a GameChanger\nwith respect to not engaging in\nunproductive conversations in fact since\nI adopted this tactic I haven't gotten\ninto a single heated argument with\nanyone and this is because it really\ndoes take two to tango two people don't\nfight if one person isn't interested so\nif there is a fight it's generally\nbecause both people wanted it to happen\nand this means that if we want to reduce\nthe amount of unnecessary conflict in\nthe world we kind of have to figure out\nhow to keep our cool when other people\nhave lost theirs one thing I've learned\nas a therapist is that once people pass\na certain threshold of emotion their\ncapacity to think rationally is\ncompletely compromised the type of\nemotion doesn't matter we started\ntalking about arguments so it's often\nanger but it can also be hopelessness\nand despondency or fear and Terror or\njealousy and insecurity only the\nintensity of the emotion is relevant not\nits tamber and once this line is crossed\nwords are generally\npowerless this means that the most\nuseful truth or the most trenchant\nInsight or the most persuasive people\npiece of evidence is going to fall on\ndeaf ears they will just not be able to\nhear it or even worse they'll hear it\nthrough the lens of their emotion which\nwill generally cause the comment to be\nperceived as an attack on the continued\nexistence of the emotion in question and\nthis will lead to defensiveness\nminimization and invalidation remember\nemotions are living things and like\nliving things they will fight to\npreserve their lives in a myrian of ways\nall this is to say that the most\nappropriate time to say bring up that\nyour partner tends to throw you under\nthe bus with her parents or that she\nteases you in front of her friends or\nthat she hasn't been pulling her weight\naround the house might not actually be\nthe moment you notice it or in the thick\nof an argument people often think that\nthe time to talk about these things is\ngenerally when they are most emotionally\nSalient I.E strike when the iron is hot\nhowever I found that doing so\nfunctionally guarantees that whatever\nreasonable point you are about to make\nwill be completely lost a much better\nidea on the other hand is to strike when\nthe iron is cold that is to bring up\nissues in the absence of\nemotionality this can be difficult to do\nbecause the issues will feel less\nrelevant when they are disconnected from\nany kind of emotional urgency however if\nyou're actually interested in being\nheard and influencing change then\nbringing up issues in the absence of\nemotionality will significantly improve\nyour likelihood of success the right\nword is wasted if it's delivered at the\nwrong\nmoment so what do you do the idea here\nis to kind of put that comment in your\nback pocket and wait for your moment\nwhen the opportunity presents itself you\ncan then speak your peace like a\nsurgical strike and I'll explain how to\nrecognize that opportunity in a moment\nfor the time being however if you\nperceive that someone has crossed the\nthreshold of excessive emotionality the\nname of the game is\ndeescalation gently avoid don't get\ndrawn in let some time pass and this is\nvery helpful give the person the benefit\nof the doubt in your mind consciously\nremind yourself that they're just\ntemporarily not seeing clearly but\nthey'll be able to see the error of\ntheir ways when they come back to their\nsenses in the meantime that comic can go\nright in your back pocket keep in mind\nthat your back pocket as a cognitive\nconstruct is functionally Limitless you\ncan fit a lot more back there than you\nmight think now before I go any further\nif you're liking what you're hearing\nplease consider sending this episode to\nsomeone who might benefit from its\nmessage because it's Word of Mouth\nreferrals like this that really help to\nmake the channel grow I'm also proud to\nannounce that my book the value of\nothers is now available for pre-sale on\nAmazon I'm I'm also writing original\ncontent for my free newsletter every\nweek if you'd like to sign up you can do\nso on my website finally please fill out\nan inquiry form on my website if you're\ninterested in booking a paid\nconsultation links to everything in the\ndescription let's get back to it now of\ncourse the same goes for you as well if\nyour own emotions have passed a certain\npoint then it's typically a good idea to\ntable further discussion until you can\nget that under control the vast majority\nof issues do not need to be resolved\nright then and there this perception of\npressured necessity tends to force\ndiscussion which generally leads to\nsuboptimal results if you're emotionally\nactivated then anything you say or do\nwill be colored with that emotion which\ncould very well create more problems\nthan it solves especially when it comes\nto anger so if you can resist the urge\nto force the issue right then there if\nyou can resist the impulse to engage in\nunproductive back and forth then you\nwill be in a much better position if and\nwhen the individual in question comes\nback for a discussion and in my\nexperience most people do come back\nafter they've calmed down\nespecially if you chose not to engage\nthem in kind this is because your\nunwillingness to enter into their\nemotional world will cause their\nbehavior to exist in stark contrast to\nyours they very clearly will have\nstepped over a line because you didn't\nstep over it with them on the other hand\nif for whatever reason they succeed in\ndrawing you in then you will have both\nbeen tainted and an apology will be less\nlikely in any case when the person comes\nback to repair the situation this is the\nperfect opportunity to strike when the\niron is cold this is because the\nindividual in question will not only not\nbe emotional but he or she will have\ntaken the initiative to come to you this\nis the minimum necessary effort that you\nshould expect from people with whom you\ndecide to have\nrelationships and if people are\nunwilling or unable to make this minimum\neffort then you might need to have a\nhard talk with a person in the mirror to\nfigure out why you're working to keep\nthese people in your life do not chase\npeople down after they've behaved\nbadly trust that most will come back\nwhen they're ready and be willing to let\ngo of the ones who\ndon't and this effort is necessary\nbecause it functionally communicates\nsome measure of regret the cognitive\ndissonance created between the memory of\ntheir behavior and their preferred\nself-concept has motivated them to take\ncorrective action which indicates that\nthey will be much more open into\ncorrective feedback as well just like\nit's not a good idea to offer advice\nunless it's explicitly asked for because\nlet me tell you it can be hard enough to\nget people to follow advice that they do\nexplicitly ask for it's not a good idea\nto offer corrective feedback unless the\nother person is in a position to receive\nit\nappropriately and that feedback can just\nstay in your back pocket until they're\nready for it don't worry the truth\ndoesn't rust if it's true now it will be\ntrue in a few hours or a few days or a\nfew\nweeks don't worry and you can do more\ngood with the right word at the right\ntime than you can endlessly repeating\nthe same message when someone isn't\nready to hear it just save your breath\nin any case the best time to discuss an\nissue is generally when both parties are\nlevelheaded and unemotional and this is\noften not the moment the issue has\npresented itself if you choose your\ncorrectly then you're not only less\nlikely to make matters worse but you may\nactually succeed in improving the\nsituation with your effective\ncommunication as well what do you think\ndoes this fit with your own experience\nlet me know in the comments below
