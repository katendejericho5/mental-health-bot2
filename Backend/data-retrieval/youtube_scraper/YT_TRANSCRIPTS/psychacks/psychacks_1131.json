    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychs\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is drax\nand the warriors mindset\nso in today's episode we're going to\ntake another dip into pop psychology\nright now i'm playing through the\nsurprisingly excellent\nguardians of the galaxy video game for\nthe playstation 5. it has been a blast\nthe game is so imaginative the script\nwriting is phenomenal and all of the\nvoice acting is\nfirst rate across the board with a\nstandout performance from jason cavalier\nwho voices drax the destroyer excellent\nwork jason really really digging your\ninterpretation of the character\nso for those of you who are unaware the\nguardians of the galaxy are kind of a\nragtag group of misfits who fly around\non a spaceship and basically bluster\ntheir way through all sorts of\npredicaments\nall the protagonists are kind of damaged\nin their own way and that's a big part\nof what makes them endearing and\nrelatable\nand one of the characters is drax the\ndestroyer who as the name suggests is\nthis big muscle-headed guy with a\nsketchy past and a noble warrior's heart\nand i'm calling drax out for two reasons\nfirst he has this relationship with\nchallenge that i think is really really\nuseful\nrather than shying away from the\ngrueling and demanding tasks like most\nof the other characters\ndrax sees the easy path as undignified\nand unworthy of his attention\nhe seeks out the biggest baddies to\ntangle with because only those opponents\nwill bring him glory and renown\nwhile the others are complaining about\ntheir misfortune draxes enthusiastically\nembracing the challenge because anything\nless would betray his legacy and reflect\npoorly on him as a warrior so i really\nlike this mindset got a big challenge\ngreat bring it on i a victory of this\nmagnitude will only add to my legend and\nanything else is it worth my time\nthat's one of the messages i get from\ndrax\nhe also has this really great attitude\nwith respect to death\nover the course of the game the heroes\nget into a bunch of hairy predicaments\nand while the other characters are\nscreaming that they're about to die drax\nseems to be enjoying himself immensely\nfor drax it doesn't seem to be a\nquestion of if he will die that's a\nforegone conclusion he knows that he\nwill\nthe question is whether he will die a\nnoble and glorious death fit for a\ncatastrone warrior\nhe's not interested in avoiding the end\nhe's interested in making sure that his\ninevitable end is worthy of his life\nand if so he will embrace it\nwholeheartedly\nso just a brief character analysis of\ndrax the destroyer who exhibits at least\na couple interesting and admirable\ncharacter traits\ncheck the game out for yourself and let\nme know what you think\nif you're watching on youtube or\ninstagram please drop a comment below\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychaxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
