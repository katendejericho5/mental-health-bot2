    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nlove is an adverb\nso what is love\ni have this funny way of answering this\nquestion\ni call it my parts of speech model of\nlove and it kind of goes like this\nthe most basic rudimentary understanding\nof love is that love is a noun\nit's a feeling which is a noun\nit's a word that you say which is a noun\nit's a marriage license which is a noun\nthat's the lowest comprehension\na higher comprehension of love is that\nit's a verb\nit's an action\nyou can say that you love someone but do\nyour actions actually align with that\nconfession\nbetter to have the actions without the\nconfession than the other way around\nso verb love can be acts of service\nplayfulness affection devotion you have\nto do things or else it will be very\ndifficult to communicate love\nnow this is pretty good but one of the\nliabilities associated with verb love is\nthat people have different ideas about\nwhat another person has to do\nfor them to be able to receive love\nand sometimes they can believe that if\nanother person doesn't do those things\nthen that other person doesn't love them\nand so people miss out on opportunities\nto both give and receive love when they\nabide at this level of comprehension\nin my opinion the highest understanding\nof love is that it's an adverb that is\nlove is a quality of action it's a way\nof doing something\ntrue love to coin a phrase\nis\nloving fulliness\nyou can do anything with love you can\nsay yes with love you can sing there\nwith love\nyou can agree with love you can disagree\nwith love you can approach with love you\ncan avoid with love\nit's a quality of action\nand this kind of loving fullness can\npermeate your being and radiate through\neverything that you do\nand i think this is an important\nthing to keep in mind because it opens\nthe door for us to receive love in more\nways across a broader spectrum of\nbehaviors\nwe could have a finer relationship with\nlove\nif we become increasingly sensitive to\nthe quality of another's action\nover and above what they do\nand how they feel\nit's a more authentic and vibrant\nexperience\ni hope that made sense\nif you are watching on instagram or\nyoutube please drop a comment below and\nif you'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psychaxpodcast\ngmail.com thanks for listening"
