    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nlove and the alphabet\nthere's this parable from judaism that i\nlove i might get some of the details\nwrong but here's the gist of it a family\nis going to temple to make an offering\nto god\nand all the family members take turns\nplacing something of value on the altar\ndad put some money on the altar\nmom offers some food\nthe eldest son offers his favorite toy\nbut the youngest child maybe he's two or\nthree\nhe's sad\nbecause he has nothing so he has nothing\nto offer\nso what the child decides to do\nis to recite the alphabet for god\nbecause that's the one thing he knows\nhow to do\nand according to the parable this was\nthe offering that was most highly prized\nby god\nand i think there are two reasons why\nthis was the case in the first place as\nofferings go it was pure\nsimple and sincere\nand these things are generally pleasing\nto the divine in most traditions\nwhen it comes to devotion and love\nit's really the sincerity of the gift\nthat matters most of all\nand in the second place i think the\nyoungest child's offering was the most\nvalued by god because\nthe child\nalone\ngave all that he had\nthe others just gave a part of what they\nhad the dad had more money\nthe eldest son had more toys\nthe youngest child gave all that he had\nand who could possibly give more than\nall\nso i really like this parable because it\nopens up a door to some of the\npossibilities of love which kind of\nturned the values of day-to-day life\nupside down\nand it's a way to enter into deeper\nrelationships with both god and others\ni hope that helps if you're watching on\nyoutube and instagram please drop a\ncomment below and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat cychaxpodcast gmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
