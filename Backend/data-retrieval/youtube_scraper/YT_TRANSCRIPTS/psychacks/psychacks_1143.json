    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\ntruth and lies\nnow we as a society have been dealing\nvery intimately with the concept of\ntruth these past two years\nfor example one way we deal with truth\non a daily basis is in the form of\nsocial media fact checkers whose stated\npurpose is to restrict suppress and\ncensor alleged misinformation\ndisinformation and lies\nunfortunately even if we assume good\nintentions on the part of those who do\nperform this service\nthere is a problem with this approach\nthe problem with this approach is that\nwhile lies can be dangerous\nthe suppression of dialogue which\nreveals truth is actually much more\ndangerous than the dissemination of lies\nif lies circulate it's likely\nunavoidable that at least some people\nfor some time will be ensnared in the\nuntruth\nbut over time if truth is also freely\ncirculating it's not really possible for\nthe lies to get much of a foothold in\nthe collective consciousness\nin the vast majority of cases it's a\nself-corrective process\nit's only possible for circulating lives\nto enjoy widespread uptake through the\nsuppression of truth and dialogue\nand that's why only truth needs to be\nsuppressed lies don't need to be\nsuppressed\nallow them to circulate and the truth\nwill dispel them in time only truth\nneeds to be suppressed because truth can\ndestroy lies but lies can't destroy\ntruth\nall the darkness in the world can't\nsnuff out a single flame\nand a single flame is all that is\nnecessary to dispel the surrounding\ndarkness\nnow\nin the time between the circulating of a\nlie and its obliteration by the truth a\ngreat deal of harm can be done\nso if we give them the benefit of the\ndoubt\nwe could presume that those looking to\nprevent the circulation of a lie are\ntrying to prevent or at least reduce the\nharm caused by its circulation\nbut the problem with that perspective is\nthat no one side and certainly no\ncentralized authority has a monopoly on\nthe truth\nand what i think we've discovered in our\ncollective experiments in civilization\nover hundreds or thousands of years is\nthat the truth most reliably manifests\nin open dialogue between opposing\nviewpoints\nthis isn't always the case but i think\nthat all other things being equal the\nfree exchange of information is our best\nbet for facilitating the emergence of\ntruth\nand that truth is a natural antidote to\nlies\nso we might not need to be so concerned\nwith the circulation of lies if we also\nhave free and open dialogue from which\ntruth can emerge and propagate\nin my mind the suppression of alleged\nmisinformation\nwould be equivalent to launching a\ncrusade against all viruses bacteria and\npathological agents that could\npotentially cause harm to humans as\nopposed to the cultivation of healthy\nimmune systems in common sense\nthis is because the former is likely an\nimpossible goal while the latter is not\na healthy immune system and common sense\ncan also effectively stave off most\nviruses and bacteria suggesting that\nthat should be our frontline defense\nfocusing on one while ignoring the other\nwould be foolish\nmy argument is that the same holds true\nwith truth and lies the suppression of\nall alleged misinformation\nis likely an impossible goal and one\nthat should be less of a collective\npriority than ensuring the free exchange\nof information which facilitates the\nemergence of truth\nsomething to consider\nif you're listening on apple podcasts\ngoogle podcast or spotify please like\nrate and review this episode\nand if you're watching on youtube please\ndrop a comment below\nfinally if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychexpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
