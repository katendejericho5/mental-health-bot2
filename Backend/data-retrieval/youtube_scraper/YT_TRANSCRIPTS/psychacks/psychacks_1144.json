    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\novercoming scarcity mentality\nso i have a secret to confess\nwhen i was in my teens and early\ntwenties i would occasionally receive a\ngift from a friend or a family member\nsomething small like a cupcake or a\nbunch of cookies\nand even though i was delighted by the\npresent even though the present looked\nrather delicious\ni would often refrain from eating the\npresent\nbecause on some level if i ate it it\nwould be gone\nand then i would have nothing\nbut if i didn't need it i would still\nhave the present\ni understand that this was irrational\nbut it's what i did\ni'd sometimes keep those cookies for\nmonths even though doing so would cause\nthem to go stale\nbecause it would keep me connected to\nthe gift\nand the intention that i presume to be\nbehind it\nof course\nin the holding on to the gift i lost the\ngift because the cookies got stale\nbut for a time i managed to convince\nmyself that i still had it\nand i think this is how the scarcity\nmentality works i'm going to cling to\nthis and not use it or enjoy it or\nexperience it i'm going to cling to this\nbecause clinging is preferable to the\nnothingness that i expect would take its\nplace\nwhere i too use it or enjoy it or\nexperience it\ni had no real confidence that if i were\nto eat the cookies they would be\nreplaced by a fresh batch on a\nreasonable timeline\nfor me that's the crux of the scarcity\nmentality if i were to eat the cookie it\nwouldn't be replaced\nnow the fact of the matter is that we\nneed to eat cookies in order to create\nspace for more cookies to come into our\nlives\nif my friend were to find out that i\nhadn't yet eaten the cookie she had\nalready given me\nwhy would she bake me more\nit would be wasteful\nand i think both people and the universe\ntend to operate according to this\nrational principle of parsimony\nthe reality is\nthat we're going to lose the cookie\nanyway\nwhether we lose it through staleness or\nwhether we lose it through consumption\nis irrelevant the cookie is doomed\nso if we're going to lose the cookie\nanyway why not enjoy it\nand why not cultivate more trust in one\nof the more rational dimensions of\nreality namely that nature abhors a\nvacuum\nin enjoying the cookie we create the\nspace for more cookies to come into our\nlives\nnow in the beginning this attitude\nrequires some measure of faith that the\nvoid will be filled but the more you do\nit the more you will come to trust in\nthis underlying fabric of reality\nit's in the nature of things that you\nwill be provided for\nyou will be provided love and friendship\nand money and growth and health and\nredemption\nthese things won't always be provided to\nyou on a silver platter and that's good\nbecause it gives us something to do with\nour time\nbut the universe is abundant in its\npossibilities there are opportunities\nfor all of these things\nbut we first need to create the space\nfor them to come into our lives by\nincreasingly letting go of what we cling\nto in our fear\nand the best way to do that\nis to consume through active\nparticipation\nthe goodness that comes into your life\nthus opening up more space for even more\ngoodness to arrive in time\ni hope that makes sense\nif you're listening on apple podcasts\ngoogle podcasts or spotify please like\nrate and review this episode and if\nyou're watching on youtube please drop a\ncomment below\nfinally if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
