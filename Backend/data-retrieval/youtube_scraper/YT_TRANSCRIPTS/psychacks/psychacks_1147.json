    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nwhat is heaven\nso i was thinking about this subject the\nother day\nand immediately what came into my mind\nwhen i considered the concepts of heaven\nand hell\nwas that heaven was a place of eternal\npleasure and comfort\nlike being fed grapes by gorgeous angels\nwhile i recline on some divine divine\nand that hell was a place of unrelenting\npain and suffering\nlike being stabbed with pitchforks by\nhideous demons while i'm pursued through\nfire and brimstone\nand i think this is a very superficial\nconceptualization\nbut i also think it's the most prevalent\nview of those concepts in society\nand you can see how obviously they are\nconnected to hedonic principles that\nhell is pain and heaven is pleasure\nthen i looked at that a little more\ncarefully\nbecause it only takes a modicum of\nadditional intellectual effort to\nunderstand that abiding in a place of\nunremitting pleasure would almost\ncertainly become hellish in its own\nright\nif for nor the reason that it would\nlikely become insufferably tedious and\nboring\nso then i thought that maybe for me\npersonally\nheaven doesn't look like just\nluxuriating in pleasure and comfort\nso what might heaven look like for me\nand i thought heaven for me might\nactually look like a video game an\naction adventure game like the legend of\nzelda or a role-playing game like final\nfantasy\nin the game i have to overcome great\nchallenges by overcoming smaller\nchallenges collecting key items and\nleveling up important stats along the\nway\nand all of these challenges are linked\nin an overarching quest to save the\nworld or to defeat a great evil or\nsomething like that\nand so i thought heaven for me\nmight be the opportunity to become\nvictorious\nin a difficult and complex quest\nthroughout the world\nand then i thought about that further\nand i realized that the only way this\nquest would be personally compelling\nwould be if i were not all-powerful or\nall-knowing or all good\na lot of video games for instance have a\nnew game plus feature which allows you\nto start a new game with the save data\nof a finished game\nthis allows your character to begin the\nadventure with most or all of his\nin-game stats and items in tow which\nobviously makes the game significantly\neasier\nplaying with such an overpowered\ncharacter however can make the game\nrather boring because on some level the\nthreat that you will be unsuccessful is\nalmost completely eradicated and your\nvictory becomes a foregone conclusion\nnow heaven must be a game that we can\nwin which means that hell must be a game\nthat we can't\nthese games after all have a\npredetermined narrative that destines\nthe protagonist to victory so long as he\ncontinues to overcome the difficulties\nplaced in his path\nbut by the same token for the game to be\nemotionally compelling\nit has to at least seem as though we\ncould possibly lose\nso what i realized is that heaven for me\nmust be an opportunity to overcome\ndifficulties in a narrative that\npredetermines my victory\nbut that denies me knowledge of that\npredetermination\nas this would create at least the\nillusion of stakes in order to\nfacilitate emotional participation\nand then i realized that this definition\nof heaven is actually very similar to\nlife\nthe only possible difference between the\ntwo\nis really this idea of whether or not\nour victory is predetermined in a game\nwe know that the narrative progresses\nalong a predetermined trajectory toward\nvictory in life it doesn't seem to be\nthe case\nso there are two possibilities\neither it doesn't seem to be the case\nbecause it isn't the case or that it\ndoesn't seem to be the case\nbecause we are denied knowledge of that\npredetermination which of course is my\nworking definition of heaven\nthis means that the way to transform\nlife into heaven\nis through the actualization of faith\nbecause it would only be through faith\nthat we could approach the conviction of\na guaranteed victory that we were denied\nknowledge of\nso that we could pass through the\nemotional experience of being alive\nand this is actually a pretty compelling\nidea that the life we are living right\nnow\ncan potentially be transformed into a\nheavenly experience through the power of\nfaith\nthat we can't not win\nbut we kind of have to be made to\nbelieve that we can lose\nfor our own good\nso i wanted to share that thought with\nyou hopefully it makes sense\nand if you've ever heard of a theologian\nor a philosopher that talks about this\nplease get in touch with me i'd very\nmuch like to know if anyone else has\nthought along these same lines\nand thanks for listening if you're\nlistening on apple podcasts google\npodcast or spotify please like rate and\nreview this episode and if you're\nwatching on youtube please drop a\ncomment below\nfinally if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast gmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
