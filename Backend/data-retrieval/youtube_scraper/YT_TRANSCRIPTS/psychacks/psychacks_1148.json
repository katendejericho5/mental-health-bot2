    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is\nsay you're lying\nso this is a tactic that i use when i\nneed to have a difficult conversation\nand i'm feeling a lot of dread or\nanxiety about it\noftentimes when i think about having\nsuch a conversation i'm subject to\nbecoming overwhelmed with imagining all\nthese fabricated scenarios\ni consider the impact slight changes in\nwording or tone would have on the\noutcome and i try to anticipate all of\nthe possible emotional reactions of the\nother party and unsurprisingly that\ngenerally just exacerbates my dread and\nanxiety not a useful approach to the\nproblem\nso sometimes\nwhen there's something that i need to\nsay though i don't particularly want to\nsay it\ni try to consider the situation like an\nactor who has to say is lying at a\nspecific point in the action\nto advance the plot forward\nthat's it\ni just have to say my line on cue\nit doesn't have to be a tony\naward-winning performance it doesn't\nhave to be witty or compassionate or\ncharming it just has to be said\nsometimes you just need to say your line\nso that the plot can advance\nas an actor your job is to speak the\nwords so that the play can continue\nthis is a tactic that i would recommend\nif you're feeling a lot of anxiety about\nsay asking someone out or breaking up\nwith someone\nyou can even memorize your line if you\nneed to\nthat way when the appropriate time comes\nyou can simply speak the words no need\nto worry about anything else\nyou just need to move your mouth and\nfloat the words into the air\nif you've done this then you've done\nyour part and the play can continue\nyou can then respond organically\ndepending on how the other person\nchooses to react to what you had to say\ndon't overthink it when it comes time to\ntalk\njust say you're lying that's it\ni hope this was helpful\nif you're listening on apple podcasts\ngoogle podcasts or spotify please like\nrate and review this episode and if\nyou're watching on youtube please drop a\ncomment below\nfinally if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at psych\nhackspodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
