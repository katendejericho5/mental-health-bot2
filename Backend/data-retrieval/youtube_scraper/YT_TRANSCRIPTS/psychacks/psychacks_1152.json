    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhumility is knowing your proper size\nyou know i grew up with the impression\nthat humility meant to be very very low\nself-effacing and potentially even\ngroveling in relation to other people or\nthe mystery of the universe\nand i've since evolved my understanding\nof this idea\ni now believe that humility is knowing\none's proper size\nnow one of the paradoxes of the human\nexperience is that we are both very very\nbig and very very small\nat the same time\nwe certainly know most of us that we are\nvery very small\nthe universe is\nincomprehensibly vast billions of light\nyears across\nand we are from this point of view\nsimply floating on a speck in an\nunremarkable corner of a galaxy caroming\nthrough a near infinite void\nit's hard to believe your existence\nmatters at all when you zoom out to that\nperspective\nby the same token we are also very very\nlarge\neach one of us is comprised of trillions\nand trillions of cells and organisms\nand in you\nlies the ancestral history of millions\nof years of evolution stretching all the\nway back to the dawn of life itself you\nare composed of the ejecta of supernova\nwhich means that you are literally star\nstuff\nand you can be very very very important\nto some of the people close to you\nwhile remaining completely unknown to\nthe vast majority of humanity so this is\nthe paradox of the human experience you\nare both very very big\nand very very small very very important\nand very very inconsequential at the\nsame time\nnow usually when we talk about people\nneeding to embrace humility\nit's typically in relation to folks that\nwe would like to see taken down a peg\nyou know they seem to be a little too\nbig for their britches a little too full\nof themselves\na little more self-important than they\nactually are and that certainly happens\nthere are people out there who don't\nseem to have taken that zoomed out view\nof the universe in quite some time\nhowever after 10 years of talking to\npeople as a therapist\ni've discovered that people thinking\nthey're bigger than they really are\nis actually a much less common problem\nthan people thinking that they're\nsmaller than they really are\nmost people aim for very modest goals\nand often don't even believe themselves\ncapable of achieving these\nthese folks don't come anywhere\nclose to realizing their full potential\nand they significantly underestimate the\nvalue of their existence in many\nrespects it's\nmore dangerous to err on the side of\nbelieving you are too small than on the\nside of believing you are too big\nthe truth is\nyou have the capacity and the potential\nto become and achieve immeasurably more\nthan you currently are and do\nsomething to consider\nif you're listening on apple podcasts\ngoogle podcasts or spotify please like\nrate and subscribe this uh review this\nepisode and if you're watching on\nyoutube please like and drop a comment\nbelow\nfinally if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\ncycaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
