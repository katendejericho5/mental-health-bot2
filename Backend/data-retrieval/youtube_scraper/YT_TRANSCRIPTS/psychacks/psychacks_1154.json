    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe stress diathesis model of mental\nillness\nnow this is an ungainly technical phrase\nthe stress diathesis model but it's\nactually a fairly simple concept\nit's a way to explain the pathogenesis\nof mental illness or where mental\nillness comes from\nthe dominant social view of mental\nillness is that it is caused by an\nimbalance in brain chemistry a narrative\nthat obviously supports the goals the\npharmaceutical industry\nhowever the fact of the matter is that\nthere is very little evidence to support\nthis theory\ntake for example the popular belief that\ndepression is caused by a deficit of\nserotonin\nif this were the case we should expect\nto see low serum serotonin levels in\ndepressed individuals and non-low serum\nserotonin levels in non-depressed\nindividuals\nbut that's not what we see\nrather we see that serum serotonin level\nis pretty much normally distributed\nacross the population\nsome depressed people have high serum\nserotonin levels and some non-depressed\npeople have low serum serotonin levels\nin fact the inventor of this theory\nknown as the monoamine hypothesis\nrecanted his position over 30 years ago\ndue to a lack of supporting evidence\nhowever it continues to enjoy popular\nsupport to this day\nan alternative to this theory which\nenjoys significantly more support in the\nempirical literature\nis the stress diathesis model which\nbasically says that an individual under\nsufficient stress will eventually come\nto respond to that stress in\nincreasingly dysfunctional ways\nyou can think of it kind of like your\nimmune system\ngenerally when your immune system is\nfunctioning well the bacteria and the\nviruses and the cancer cells that are\nactually always present within your body\nare pretty much kept in check they don't\nevolve into disease processes because\nyou are healthy and resilient enough to\nattend to them\nhowever if your immune system is\ncorroded over time through poor\nnutrition or lack of exercise or chronic\nstress\nthen it won't be able to respond as\neffectively to these continuous assaults\nand the disease process begins in\nearnest\nwell the same thing happens with your\nmental health if you're having a\ndifficult time at work and you're going\nthrough a breakup and you're not getting\nenough sleep because you're ruminating\non negative thought patterns and you're\ndrinking too much\nthen all of these things are going to\nconspire to make it increasingly\ndifficult for you to exercise natural\nresiliency to overcome the difficulties\nyou happen to be facing in your life\nand that's when the disease process the\nmental illness fluoresces\nwhen there's a confluence of factors\nthat make it increasingly harder for\ndysfunctional responses to be kept in\ncheck\nthe important thing to keep in mind here\nis that the research suggests that it's\nthe number of stressors a person is\nfacing not the intensity of the\nstressors the number of stressors\nthat really plays the pivotal role in\ndetermining whether natural resiliency\nis compromised to the extent that a\nmental illness emerges\nwe can handle one maybe even two or\nthree significant setbacks concurrently\nbut when we get to six seven eight\nit becomes very difficult to keep our\nheads above water something to keep in\nmind\nthanks for listening if you like what\nyou heard drop a comment below and if\nyou'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psychaxpodcast\ngmail.com talk to you soon\nyou"
