    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow to be disciplined\nso this is something that i often talk\nto my clients about\nthey have an idea of quote what they\nshould do\nthey have a notion of quote what they\nwant to do\nbut for whatever reason they feel like\nthey can't do it that they can't stay\nfocused that they can't stay consistent\nthat they can't exercise sufficient\ndiscipline to cultivate the new behavior\ntotally understandable\nit's very difficult to cultivate a new\nbehavior if it were easy i probably\nwouldn't have a job\nnow this is how i think about it\nthe main reason why people get into\ntrouble with discipline is that they\nassume that discipline has an emotional\ncomponent\nthat is they know what they should do\nbut in the moment when they might need\nto execute that behavior they allow\nthemselves to think\nwell i don't really feel like doing it\nor\ni don't really want to do it etc\nthey allow emotion to enter into the\ndeliberation on whether to execute the\nintended behavior\nnow in my conceptualization discipline\nhas nothing to do with emotion\nrather discipline is a duty\nit is an obligation that you surrender\nto\ndiscipline is like a meeting that your\nboss puts on your calendar you may not\nwant to go but that's irrelevant if you\nwant to keep your job you show up where\nand when you're instructed\nmy model for discipline is the united\nstates postal service\nneither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom\nof night stays these couriers from the\nswift completion of their appointed\nrounds the postman doesn't wake up in\nthe morning and ask himself do i feel\nlike delivering the mail today do i want\nto deliver the mail today oh it looks\nlike it's a little wet out does that\nmean i don't have to deliver the mail\ntoday none of these questions even enter\ninto the conversation the disciplined\nperson doesn't allow them to he's\ndecided that he's a postman he delivers\nthe mail\nperiod his emotions are irrelevant it's\na duty and he surrenders to his duty\nso\nthe idea here is to create the structure\nthat you can surrender to\nand to treat that structure like an\nexternally imposed duty with the same\nforce of a contractual obligation\nthat way when it's time to do your duty\nyou just do it it's really that simple\ncultivate discipline by channeling your\ninner postmen\ni hope this helps if you like what you\nheard drop a comment below and if you'd\nlike to schedule a consultation you can\nreach me at psychaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
