    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psychex\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is rest is\nnot a waste of time\ni talk to a lot of stressed out burned\nout individuals in the course of my\nclinical practice\nand a recurring refrain from these\nindividuals is that they're too busy to\nrest\nif they had more time\nthen they would be able to take a break\nhowever given current demands they can't\nafford to slack off\nand this belief of course facilitates\nthe burnout and increases the likelihood\nof accident illness\nand collapse\nnow if you examine this perspective\nits existence must be predicated on some\nvariant of the belief that rest is\nwasted time\nthat it's unproductive time\nand that it's therefore economically\nunreasonable to prioritize rest over\nmore\ntask directed activity\nbut that's sort of like arguing that\nstopping for gas is a waste of time on a\nroad trip\nor believing that you should be able to\ndrive indefinitely without refueling\nif you actually were to drive your car\nas if you never needed to fill up the\ntank\neventually that car is going to stop\nfunctioning which will compromise the\noverarching objective of that road trip\nyou're literally not going to get very\nfar with that attitude\na more reasonable perspective is\nconsidering refueling to be absolutely\nessential to the success of the\nlong-term goal\nit's not something that can be dispensed\nwith as wasteful or needless it's\nneither\nright now i'm thinking of the adage\nattributed to abraham lincoln if i had\neight hours to chop down a tree i'd\nspend the first six of them sharpening\nmy axe\nit's generally more effective to\nimplement concerted incisive action that\nis supported by longer periods of rest\nand preparation\nthan it is to expend all your energies\nin unrelenting and tireless activity\nso i'd invite you to really examine this\ndo you believe that rest is a waste of\ntime\nif you do you might need to content\nyourself with more modest achievements\nfor greater endeavors\nrest must be understood as a necessary\ncondition of your ultimate success\nthanks for listening if you like what\nyou heard drop a comment below and if\nyou'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psycaxpodcast\ngmail.com talk to you soon\nyou"
