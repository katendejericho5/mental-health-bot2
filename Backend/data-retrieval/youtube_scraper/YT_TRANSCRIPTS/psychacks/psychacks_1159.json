    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe problem with passion\npassion is a concept that is thrown\naround a lot\nparticularly with respect to people's\nwork\ni would suggest that if passion is\nappropriate anywhere it's in the context\nof your romantic relationships but this\nis the world we live in\npeople really feel like it's important\nto feel passionate about what they do\nfor a living and i have a problem with\npassion because i understand the origin\nof the word\netymologically\npassion means\nsuffering\ni'll say it again passion means\nsuffering\nthis is the key to unlocking certain\nspiritual principles such as the passion\nof the christ\nwithout this understanding it really\ndoesn't make any sense why we would call\nthe humiliation and crucifixion of jesus\nhis passion\neverything about that story goes against\nwhat people generally associate with\nthat word and that's how the word has\nactually been utilized until recently\nfor hundreds of years passion means\nsuffering\nnow potentially\npassion is a kind of exquisite suffering\nthat facilitates self-transcendence\ntowards a higher ideal which you could\nargue is what happened on the cross but\nthis isn't generally something that's\nappropriate for your nine-to-five\npassion is historically a\nself-annihilating vocation\nlike the years michelangelo spent\npainting the ceiling of the sistine\nchapel this was both an agony and an\necstasy that permanently damaged the\nartist's eyesight\nhowever his passion for the project\nsupported his obvious suffering toward a\nself-transcendent goal\nif passion is missing from your everyday\nlife\nthat isn't actually a problem and that's\nbecause passion rightly has no claim to\nthe tasks of daily life\nit is better understood as a spiritual\naspiration\nfew people are truly touched by passion\nin their lives\nand they are inevitably destroyed in the\nprocess\nit is associated with glory sure but not\nwith stability and material success\nso if you're looking for passion it's\nimportant to be aware that you're\nactually chasing after suffering a\nself-destructive form of suffering\nso you know be careful what you wish for\npersonally i much prefer to like what i\ndo as opposed to love what i do when we\nlove things we generally over identify\nwith them which puts us on the roller\ncoaster we're over the moon when things\ngo well and we're inconsolable when\nthings go poorly this is the over\nidentification when the job is good\nwe're good when the job is bad we're bad\nbut when we like things we generally\nkeep enough daylight between ourselves\nand the liked object to maintain our\nobjectivity and emotional equilibrium\nthis means that our well-being can exist\nlargely independent of our professional\nfortune at any given moment\nwhich is psychologically healthy\nthat's what i have to say for today\nif you like what you heard drop a\ncomment below and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psycaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
