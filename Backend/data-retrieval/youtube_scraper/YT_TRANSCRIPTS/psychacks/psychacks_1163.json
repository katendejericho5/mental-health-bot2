    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\noffense is taken\nnot given\nthe true statement is actually supported\nby our idiom concerning offense namely i\ntake offense at that sir\nit's not so much that the other person\nis giving it as it is that we choose to\ntake it in that way\nand here's how we know this is true\nif you've ever had the displeasure of\nactually having an enemy that is someone\nwho is openly and unapologetically\nantagonistic toward you someone who is\noften trying to provoke you with their\nlanguage\nyou know that you have some measure of\ncontrol over whether or not they are\nsuccessful\nfor example if you can't avoid\ninteracting with such a person you may\nchoose to give yourself a pep talk\nbeforehand reminding yourself to not\ntake their provocations personally you\ndon't want to give them the pleasure\nsuch individuals may be unabashedly\ntrying to give offense\nbut if you enter into such an\ninteraction mindfully you can guard\nyourself against taking it\nand if you succeed in not taking it you\ndon't get offended\nit's actually not possible for those who\nintend offense to give offense\nwithout the complicit ascent of the\noffended party\nand in point of fact i found that the\nvast majority of offense taking occurs\nnot with those who intend to give it\nour enemies but with those who don't\nin most cases people aren't actively\ntrying to provoke us to give offense\nhowever it can be taken nonetheless\nthis is important because if we can\nunderstand that taking offense requires\nour complicity then we enjoy some\nmeasure of control over it\noffensiveness is a judgment that we\nconflate with certain verbal behavior\nand that judgment not the behavior and\ncertainly not the intention behind the\nbehavior\nis primarily responsible for our taking\noffense\nif we remove the judgment of\noffensiveness then no offense can be\ntaken it's just a non-starter\nand this helps us remain equilibrated\nand the guardians of our own emotional\nstates\nsomething to consider\nif you like what you heard please drop a\ncomment below and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychaxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
