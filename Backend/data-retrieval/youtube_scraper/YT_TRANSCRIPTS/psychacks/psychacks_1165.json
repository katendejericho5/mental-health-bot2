    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\npeople want what other people want\nthis is a very important principle to\nkeep in mind\nboth in terms of dating and employment\nand in fact there's actually a lot of\noverlap between those two domains\nin order to illustrate this principle\nlet me tell you a story\ni was an actor for many years before\nbecoming a psychologist\nand i attended a prestigious acting\nconservatory for undergrad and in my\nsenior year i was selected to\nparticipate in what we called industry\nnight basically the top 20 performers in\nthe school were invited to audition in\nfront of hundreds of agents and casting\ndirectors in order to help these\nperformers get industry representation\nand launch their careers after\ngraduation so it was a big deal to be\ninvited to participate in this event\nand i remember going to the event doing\nmy best with the audition and anxiously\nwaiting by the phone the following\nmorning when interested agents and\ncasting directors were expected to reach\nout to the performers who caught their\neye\nand the next day i got a couple of calls\nat 9am i got a call from an agent at a\nmajor agency\nand the very first question he asked me\nwas who else has called you\nand i truthfully confess that he was\nactually the first and that i was so\nexcited to receive this call\nhowever upon learning that information\nhe got off the phone with me very\nvery quickly\nabout an hour later i got a call from\nanother agent who asked me the very same\nquestion who else has called you\nand this time i was able to honestly\nanswer that i was contacted by so-and-so\nat this agency and that i was very\nexcited to receive his call\nand the response was oh\njust one other person\nthis was\nanother very short conversation\nand that was it\ni got two phone calls and they were\nprimarily interested in who else was\ninterested in me\npeople want what other people want and\nto a certain extent this makes sense\nin the absence of personal experience or\ndirect analysis the interest of others\nserves as a kind of proxy for the\nvariable of interest\nit's possible that a hundred people are\nall wrong but it's less likely than a\nsingle individual being wrong\nso in this way we tend to delegate our\njudgment onto the behavior of others\nfor instance those two agents who called\nme must have been interested in me\nbut the apparent fact that no one else\nseemed to be\nprobably suggested to them that it might\nbe hard to represent me as a saleable\ncommodity to others\nso try to extrapolate this principle to\nyour work\nimagine getting invited to interview at\nyour company of interest and being asked\nwell who else are you talking to and you\nrespond with no one you're the job i\nreally want and i've been waiting by the\nphone for you to call\nwell that may be true\nit's far less incentivizing for the\ncompany to act and make you an offer\nthan a response like actually i've been\ntalking to five or six other companies i\nhave a couple of open offers on the\ntable but i'm here because i'm\ninterested in what you have to say and\nwhat you can potentially and what we can\npotentially do together\nthis response will motivate action with\nrespect to that particular opportunity\nit also provides a sort of proxy\nwith respect to your\ncapacity and talent\notherwise it would be unlikely that all\nthese other companies would be\ninterested\nthis makes you a safer bet\nit's almost like these other companies\nhave already vetted you for your company\nof interest which consequently doesn't\nhave to look at you that closely\nby wanting what other people want people\ndelegate responsibility for selection\nacross a distributed network this of\ncourse can be disastrous\nhowever if the nodes of the network in\nquestion are competent and independent\nthis is actually pretty good heuristic\nin general\nso it's always a good idea to keep\ncreating opportunities for yourself\nuntil you have an explicit offer that\nyou are enthusiastic about accepting\npeople want what other people want which\nmeans it's not enough to be good or\ntalented or competent you also have to\nbe attractive\ni hope this helps if you like what you\nheard drop a comment below and if you'd\nlike to schedule a consultation you can\nreach me at psychaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
