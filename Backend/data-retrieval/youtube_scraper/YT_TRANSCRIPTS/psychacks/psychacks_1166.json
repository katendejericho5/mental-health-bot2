    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nescaping approach avoid conflicts\nso let me explain what i'm talking about\nhere\nan approach avoid conflict occurs when\nwe're ambivalent about something\nfor instance we might really want to\nhave a certain kind of relationship with\na specific individual\nat the same time that we recognize the\nsame individual often behaves in highly\naversive and unwanted ways\nthat said the desire to have the\nrelationship remains\nso the person who feels this way is\nstuck\nin an approach avoid conflict a part of\nhim wants to move forward and the part\nof him is repelled by what he finds\nthere\nthis can be very exhausting it can look\nfrom the outside that this person isn't\ndoing anything\nbecause he doesn't seem to be making\nmovements one way or another\nbut on the inside the person might be\nvacillating back and forth and\nexperiencing a good deal of inner\nturmoil and this can be quite\nemotionally exhausting\ni have two recommendations for escaping\nthis kind of situation\nthe first is all of the things being\nequal i recommend prioritizing the\nactual reality of the situation over and\nabove the desired potential of the\nsituation\nthis latter component may be projected\nunder the circumstances in question or\nmay even pre-exist those same\ncircumstances\nthat's like kind of wanting to buy a car\nbefore seeing what's on offer\nwe generally should give precedence to\nwhat is\nover what could be or what might be this\ncan be very challenging\nespecially if you're already emotionally\nengaged but it's typically the wiser\ncourse of action\nand the second recommendation is to\nallow yourself to make decisions for now\ndecisions are irrevocable you can't go\nback in the past and make a different\ndecision\nhowever you can course correct your\ndecisions on a real-time basis moving\nforward\nyou can say something like based on\nwhere i am right now and how i see the\nsituation this is what i'm deciding is\nbest for me for the time being and then\nas you move forward you can collect data\nwith respect the consequences of that\ndecision which will allow you to\nevaluate the wisdom of that choice\nand if it doesn't seem like you're\nmoving in the direction you want to go\nyou don't have to double down on that\ndecision you can course correct if and\nwhen it seems necessary\nso this can help relieve the pressure in\ncertain approach avoid conflicts you\ndon't have to make forever decisions\ninstead you can make for now decisions\nthat can be amended as future outcomes\nwarrant\ni hope you found this useful if you like\nwhat you heard drop a comment below and\nif you'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at cycaxpodcast\ngmail.com talk to you soon"
