    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe importance of small wins\nsometimes we're subject to passing\nthrough difficult moments\nwhen it feels like we're being hammered\non all sides\nour relationships aren't going well our\njob is on the rocks our friends and\nfamily seem to be distant or conflictual\nnothing really seems to be going our way\nand it's moments like these when\nprotracted that can lead people into\nincreasingly hopeless and despairing\nstates\nin these situations it's very very\nimportant to maintain a humble\nperspective\nto look for your wins at a lower\nadvantage than you typically do\nthis means temporarily lowering your\nstandards with respect to what\nconstitutes a victory\nfor example sometimes it's a victory to\njust get through the day\njust to survive one more day without\nkilling yourself i mean let's be real\nsometimes that's how it is\nsometimes the victory is that you got\nout of bed\nsometimes a victory is that you\nfulfilled your minimum requirements you\ndon't always have to exceed expectations\nsometimes just meeting expectations is a\nwin\nsometimes it's the ability to enjoy a\nsimple pleasure like eating your\nfavorite food or playing a video game\nwithout beating yourself up about it\nthese small wins are important\nthey're like the stars in the night sky\nthey don't provide a lot of light but it\nwould be really dark without them\nthe key to appreciating small wins is to\nresist the critical voice in your head\nthat will judge you contemptuously for\ntemporarily lowering your standards\nthat voice is not your friend and is not\naligned with your best interests in fact\nit may simply be a manifestation of\ncertain depressive elements and should\nbe treated as such\nso\nlook for small winds\nkeep your eyes down\nmaintain a humble posture and focus on\nthe stars they provide at least some\nlight in the darkness\nhope this helps if you like what you\nheard drop a comment below and if you'd\nlike to schedule a consultation you can\nreach me at psychexpodcast gmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
