    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\ncreate the structure that you can\nsurrender to\nhumans need structure\nthose without it sort of drift through\nlife which while superficially romantic\nis actually much more difficult than it\nseems especially the older that you\nbecome\nwe thrive in structure because structure\nis what provides the opportunity for\ngoal-directed activity\nit creates meaning because it provides a\ncontext in which our striving makes\nsense\nnature does not provide that organically\nwe have to impose structure onto nature\nin order to create the possibility of\npurposeful action for ourselves\nnow that structure can come from one of\ntwo places either externally or\ninternally\nit's much easier for folks to accept\nexternally imposed structure\nto surrender to that\ni mean think about it\nwhich is more compelling to motivate\ncompliance you telling yourself that you\nwant to work out at the end of the day\nor that your personal trainer is\nexpecting you at the at the gym\nit's just easier to surrender the\nexpectation of others\nthat said the danger of externally\nimposed structure is that we can't ever\nexpect that structure to perfectly align\nwith our own interests and desires\nand the externally imposed structure\nwhile providing us some benefit\ngenerally serves the ends of the one who\ncreated it\nso if we want a better match between our\nvalues and our goal directed activity we\nhave to create it for ourselves\nthe issue is that an internally imposed\nstructure is much harder to surrender to\nhowever this is a skill that can be\ndeveloped through repetition\nfor instance we don't train children and\nstudents to create internally imposed\nstructure\nrather we train them to be obedient and\ncompliant to authority parents teachers\npriests\nand the externally imposed structure\nassociated with authority's interests\nso it might take some time to develop\nthis capacity for creating internally\nimposed structure in yourself\nbegin in small ways\na great way to do this is to treat your\nword as if it had the same authority as\nan externally imposed expectation\ntreat your word like a legally binding\ncontract with a business partner and\nthen surrender to your word\nfulfill your obligation whether you like\nit or not\nwithout surrendering to a structure you\ndrift\nhowever if you only surrender to\nexternally imposed structure then on\nsome level you'll likely remain\nunfulfilled\nthe key to fulfillment in life is to\ncreate the structure that you can\nsurrender to\nand to practice in a disciplined and\nconsistent way surrendering to that\nstructure as if it had the force of an\nexternally imposed contract\nthanks for listening if you like what\nyou heard drop a comment below and if\nyou're interested in scheduling a\nconsultation you can reach me at psych\nhackspodcast gmail.com talk to you soon"
