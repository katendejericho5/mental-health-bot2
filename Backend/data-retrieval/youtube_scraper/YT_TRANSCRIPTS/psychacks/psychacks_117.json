    "transcript": "you actually have an interesting quote\nhere um so you say all men pay but the\nmore attracted they are to you the\nbigger the discount you get Yeah the\nmore women like you the greater the\ndiscount correct like I said earlier men\ngenerally are trying to transact\nresources for the sexual opportunity\nwhen a woman is attracted to a man when\nshe wants that particular man to access\nher in that way she will remove as many\nobstacles or obstructions to that\nrelationship as possible which basically\nmeans she's going to be available she's\nnot going to be difficult she's going to\nwork with the logistics that work for\nhim she's going to come to him on his\ntime like she's going to do as much as\nshe can to make it easy for her to fit\ninto that man's life so that on the\nwhole makes that relationship less\nexpensive for that man because he's not\ngoing out of his way he's not paying\nmore than he needs to in terms of time\nand effort etc etc which also on the\nwhole makes it more likely that he will\nmove forward with that relationship\nbecause no one man or woman will want to\npay more for the same good than they\nabsolutely have to"
