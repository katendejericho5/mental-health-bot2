    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nthe problem of other people\nso other people represent opportunity\nwe need other people to satisfy our\nwants to support our goals and to\nmaintain society generally\nhowever other people also represent a\nproblem\nin direct proportion to the extent to\nwhich they represent an opportunity\nthis is because they control some of the\nmeans by which we hope to achieve the\nends i just mentioned\nother people have what we want but might\nnot give it to us\nso they are both an opportunity to be\nseized and a problem to be solved\nso we all have to learn strategies for\ndealing with the problem of other people\nand one of the best lenses i've\ndiscovered through which to examine\nthese strategies is karen hornay's three\ntrends model\nbasically jorge noticed that there are\nthree general approaches to the problem\nof other people\nwe can move toward we can move against\nor we can move away\nand i'll briefly discuss\neach strategy in turn\nhowever before we begin it's important\nto understand that no one strategy is\nbetter than the others each strategy is\neffective and appropriate in certain\ncontexts and ineffective and\ninappropriate in others\nto that end it's really the inflexible\nor over generalized application of a\ncertain strategy that can be problematic\nnot the strategy itself got it\nfirst let's talk about move toward\nin so many words the goal of the move\ntoward strategy is to arouse feelings of\npersonally relevant positive regard in\nthe other\nand this is because people are much more\nlikely to assist and much less likely to\nobstruct\nthose whom they like or love\nso to that end move toward folks might\nbe kind attentive seductive friendly\npleasant attractive and generally\npro-social\npeople generally like move toward\nindividuals they can be warm supportive\nand easy going however these same folks\ncan have issues with people pleasing\nassertiveness boundaries and resentment\nan archetypal move toward personality is\nscheherazade who was able to transmute a\ndeath sentence into a marriage proposal\nby enchanting her would-be executioner\nnext you have the move against folks\nthe goal of the move against strategy is\nto cultivate dependence through the\nestablishment of dominance\nand this is because though they might\nnot like it\nit's hard for people to dispense with\nthe person who can do the job better\nthan anyone else\nso move against folks tend to be capable\ncompetitive\ncompetent aggressive domineering and\nanalytical\nthey get what they want from others\nthrough the demonstration of their\nsuperior intellect superior strength\nsuperior talent or superior ability\nan archetypal move against personality\nis dr house who was so brilliant that\npeople basically had to put up with his\nabrasive personality\nafter all if i'm good enough it doesn't\nmatter if people hate me they will\nrespect me and that is how i will get my\nneeds met\nfinally we have the move away folks the\ngoal of the move away strategy is to\nminimize vulnerability to the\nobstruction of others by reducing\ndependence upon them\nthat is if i want nothing from anybody\nhow can anybody be a problem for me\nconsequently these folks strive to\nbecome as independent as possible they\ntend to be self-reliant resourceful\neccentric creative inaccessible and\nrenunciatory\ntheir motto is i'll do it myself\nand to the extent that they succeed they\neliminate the possibility of being\nfrustrated and disappointed by others\nan archetypal move away personality is\ngatama buddha whose renunciation of the\nworld facilitated the transcendence of\nhis attachment to contingent beings\nso there you have it move toward move\nagainst and move away\nand it's useful to remember that you\nhave these three options when dealing\nwith the problem of other people\nas that awareness will help you\nintentionally choose the strategy most\nconducive to success given prevailing\nconditions\nthanks for listening if you like what\nyou heard drop a comment below and if\nyou're interested in scheduling a\nconsultation you can reach me at psych\nhackspodcast\ngmail.com talk to you soon"
