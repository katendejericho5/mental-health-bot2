    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nif you're going to cheat\nindulge\nso we often have these very high\nstandards for ourselves\nstandards that are almost always\nbolstered by some kind of should based\nbelief i should work out more i should\nwork on my side hustle i should go out\nmore etc\nand ultimately over a long enough\ntimeline the vast majority of us are\ngoing to experience some lapses\nwhen for whatever reason\nwe didn't quite rise to the level of our\nself-imposed standards of behavior if\nwe're on a diet we cheat therefore in an\nexercise regimen we sleep in if we're\nbuilding a business we play video games\nand so on and there's nothing inherently\nwrong with any of these behaviors\nhowever it's generally the case that\nwhen we suffer these lapses we tend to\nfeel guilty and to beat ourselves up\nand this sort of puts us in a no-win\nsituation\nif we do what we should do well we\ntypically don't derive much pleasure\nfrom doing so we were just doing what we\nwere supposed to do and no one gets a\ngold star for doing what they're\nsupposed to do\nso in this case we generally don't\nsecure a positive as much as we avoid a\nnegative that is when we do what we\nshould do we can avoid feeling guilty\nwhich let's be honest isn't very\ncompelling\nand of course if we don't do what we\nshould then we feel bad as a result\nand this robs us of any pleasure we\nmight experience from the laps so it's\nkind of the worst of both worlds i mean\nwhat's the point of cheating on a diet\nwith some chocolate cake if you don't\neven get to enjoy the dessert\nso this is what i'm getting at if you're\ngonna cheat indulge\ntake pleasure in your cheating luxuriate\nin your laziness enjoy your\nprocrastination\nor else you're robbing yourself of the\none benefit associated with your\nineffective behavior\nand if you think that you won't be able\nto allow yourself to indulge or if the\ntemporary pleasure isn't worth the\nlong-term consequences\nthen don't cheat\nor else you're robbing yourself the\ngoal-oriented benefits of your effective\nbehavior\nrefrain and pat yourself on the back\nor indulge and revel in the satisfaction\nbut don't cheat and feel bad about it\nwhere's the fun of that\ni mean the pleasure is pretty much the\nonly thing that makes the cheating\nworthwhile without it you're just\nself-sabotaging\nand if you're gonna do that you might as\nwell get something out of it no matter\nhow ephemeral and disappointing that\nsomething might be\nso if you're gonna lapse give yourself\npermission to shamelessly and\nguiltlessly enjoy what you're doing and\nif you can't do that don't do it\nso thanks for listening if you have any\nthoughts on the matter please drop a\ncomment below and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychexpodcast gmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
