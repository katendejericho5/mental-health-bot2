    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nit's not your fault but it is your\nresponsibility\nthis is something that i'm taking from\nmarsha lenahan's dialectical behavior\ntherapy\nit's one of the core paradoxes at the\nheart of her treatment modality and i\nthink it's something that's really\nimportant to keep in mind when\napproaching mental health treatment in\ngeneral\nlook\na lot of the issues with which adults\nstruggle in the present have their\norigins in the distant past\nthey were put into motion by events that\ntranspired in their childhoods within\ntheir families of origin\nchildren in general are not fully\nconscious agents\nthis means that they tend to respond\nunconsciously to their environments in a\nway that at least in their own mind\nis best suited to cope with their\nsituations\nchildren don't sit down and consciously\ndecide for example to be people-pleasers\nor counter-dependent or disorganized\nthese attitudes represent solutions to\nenvironmental problems that represent\nthe child's best thinking at that time\nand these solutions persist through time\nbecause they are at least somewhat\nfunctional remember most of the word\ndysfunction\nis the word function which means that\nthe solution mostly works it just may no\nlonger work in a different time and a\ndifferent place\nso how the child developed in response\nthe difficult circumstances of its past\nis not the child's fault\nthat said\nwe are no longer children\nand however we decide to respond to\nreality now\nirrespective of what happened to us in\nthe past is our responsibility\nand i'd like to emphasize the literal\nmeaning of this word responsibility\nresponse ability the ability to respond\ni cannot change the wounding in your\nheart\nyour parents cannot change the wounding\nin your heart your partner cannot change\nthe wounding in your heart\nonly you can because only you can access\nit\nonly you can feel it and touch it and\nchange it only you have the ability to\nrespond to its wounding in either\neffective or ineffective ways which\nmeans that you are responsible\nresponsible for that wounding\nand on some level this is fair\nbecause if you do heal that wounding\nonly you will benefit from it\ni don't feel better if you heal\nyour parents don't feel better if you\nheal your partner doesn't feel better if\nyou heal\nyou will feel better more secure more at\npeace more content if you heal with\nresponsibility comes commensurate reward\nso in conclusion the things that happen\nto you are not your fault\nbut they are your responsibility to\naddress on a go forward basis\nand assuming that responsibility\nmakes you eligible to receive the\ncommensurate reward\nthanks for listening if you have a topic\nyou'd like to suggest for a future\nepisode or you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at psych\nhackspodcast gmail.com talk to you soon"
