    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe next right move\nso sometimes folks can get a little\noverwhelmed by the apparent scope of a\nproblem it's very important to restrict\nthe aperture of our attention to the\nsmallest diameter that still\ncircumscribes the problem in question\notherwise we can very easily become\noverwhelmed by the prospect of action\nso for example sometimes people can get\ninto a tizzy trying to figure out the\nproblem of the rest of their lives you\nknow what am i doing with my life\nthe issue here is that the scope of that\nproblem is so broad and so vast that it\nbecomes very difficult to move in any\ndirection with any sort of confidence if\nthat's how the problem is defined\nso rather than conceptualize the problem\nin its entirety it's often a better idea\nto restrict your attention to the next\nright move that you believe stands a\ngood chance of moving you incrementally\ntoward your goal today\nthere's generally no need to plan how to\nget all the way to the end before you\ntake the first step\nand this is good because it wouldn't\neven be possible to do so in the event\nof necessity i mean we can barely\npredict the weather with any reasonable\ndegree of accuracy a week in advance\nit's just such a complex phenomenon\nnow imagine having to forecast who you\nwill be and what your life will be like\ndecades from now it's just not possible\ninstead focus on the next right move\nthat you can bring you a little bit\ncloser to your goal\nin the time it takes you to make that\nmove the world will have changed\nboth as a result of your action\nand as a consequence of a trillion other\nindependent events the game board will\nhave shifted and it will have shifted in\nways that you couldn't possibly have\nanticipated in their entirety\nat that point the next right move will\nbe based on configurations that didn't\neven exist a move ago\nwhich means that sometimes planning even\ntwo moves ahead is a wasted exercise\nin this way focusing on the next right\nmove allows us to remain committed to\nour goals and flexible in our means\nthe combination of which dramatically\nincreases our likelihood of success\nattending to the next right move also\nfacilitates action\nif the aperture of your focus is\nrestricted to what you can do today to\nmove the needle forward\nthen you will utilize what is more or\nless immediately available to you and\nthis is important because as i've\ndiscussed in another episode it's\nessential that you begin where you're at\nreally because there's literally no\nother place you could start\nwhen you focus on the next right move\nthe revealed possibilities are therefore\nmore likely to be actionable\nand you make progress toward a goal by\nchaining together actual actions not\ntheoretical plans but actual actions\nso this mindset will accelerate your\ngrowth irrespective of your chosen path\nthanks for listening if you'd like to\nsuggest a topic for a future episode or\nyou'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psychexpodcast\ngmail.com talk to you soon"
