    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psychex\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is if you\ncan do it once\noftentimes\ni talk to folks they're in jobs they're\nin relationships they're good but\nthey're not great and while they're not\nentirely contented many of these folks\ncan be afraid that if they were to leave\ntheir positions\nthey wouldn't be able to find something\nbetter\nnow it's true if your job or\nrelationship is pretty good well\nall things being equal there is more\nroom for things to get worse than for\nthings to get better this is kind of\nregression towards the mean\nindeed the next opportunity that comes\nyour way might actually be less\nsatisfactory that's a definite risk\nhowever what i usually say when i\nencounter this thought process is that\nif you can do it once\nyou can do it twice\nyou've already demonstrated that you are\ncapable of achieving that outcome so\nit's clearly in the realm of possibility\nthat's irrefutable\nthe question now becomes can you achieve\nthat outcome consistently and that my\nfriends takes practice\nif you can get into a satisfying\nrelationship with a person who is warm\nand supportive and loving and attractive\nthen there is no reason why you couldn't\ndo it again\nif you could do it once you can do it\ntwice\nand the second time could be even better\nbecause that's generally what we find\nwhen we practice something right we get\nbetter at it\nif you are able to find a satisfying\nfulfilling and well-paying job once\nthen you can do it twice\nfor you satisfying fulfilling and\nwell-paying jobs are a realizable\noutcome if you can do it once you can do\nit twice and if you can do it twice you\ncan do it repeatedly\nthe key to moving beyond the fear of\nletting go of something decent\nis trusting your capacity to achieve as\ninformed by your previous experience\nand if you've never done it before well\nthe good news is that you don't have\nmuch to lose only to gain so you might\nas well get out there and see if you can\nmake something of yourself\nand at the end of the day if you can do\nit once you can almost certainly do it\nagain\nso don't settle for decent prematurely\nthanks for listening\nif you'd like to suggest a topic for a\nfuture episode or you'd like to schedule\na consultation you can reach me at\ncycact's podcast gmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
