    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nlook for solutions\nit's easy to look for and find\nproblems\nthey're all around us\nthis is because the world is inherently\nunsatisfactory\nthat's one of the core attributes of\nreality according to the buddha at least\nthe world is unsatisfactory and we're\nsurrounded by problems\ntherefore\nit is not a testament to your\nperceptivity\ncleverness or intelligence\nto identify problems\nthat's like finding sand at a beach\nit's very easy to do\nlooking for problems is not emblematic\nof any positive virtues\non the other hand it is very much a\ntestament to your perceptivity\ncleverness or intelligence to identify\nsolutions\ngenerally identifying solutions requires\na good deal more concentration diligence\nand creativity than does identifying\nproblems looking for solutions is\nemblematic of positive virtues\nand it's important to understand that if\nyou can find problems\nthen you can find solutions\nthe action finding\nis the same in both cases what you're\ndoing doesn't change\nthe only thing that changes is the\nobject of your doing instead of looking\nfor one thing you look for another the\nlooking remains the same\nand this is good news if you're\nhabituated to looking for problems it\nshouldn't be a difficult problem to fix\non some level it's like a compass that's\nexactly 180 degrees off\nif you turn around and just walk in the\nopposite direction then your compass\nactually suddenly becomes a reliable\ninstrument of action with no additional\nretooling\nnow looking for solutions requires a\ncertain degree of attentional discipline\nhowever the ability to identify a\npotential solution from among an\nabundance of problems\nis a mark of the exceptional individual\nrefining this capacity will redown to\nyour benefit\ni hope this was helpful if you'd like to\nsuggest a topic for a future episode or\nyou'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psych hackspodcast\ngmail.com thanks for listening\nyou"
