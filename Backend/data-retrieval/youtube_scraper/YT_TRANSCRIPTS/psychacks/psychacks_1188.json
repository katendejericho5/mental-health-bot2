    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is\nfunctional hopelessness\nfunctional hopelessness is a term that\nto my knowledge i invented\nand it's a concept the application of\nwhich has helped me deal with other\npeople\nwhat i've discovered both in my own life\nand in the lives of many of my clients\nis that the disappointments that we are\nthat are subject to arising in our\nrelationships with others\nare often due to the fact that we\nbelieve others to be capable of more\nthan they currently seem to be\nwe often see in them the potential to be\nbetter than they currently are\nusually this means that we project our\nown standards onto these people and then\nmeasure them against their will or even\ntheir knowledge against these same\nstandards\nthe result of this is that we typically\nbecome disappointed when these folks\nfail to quote become who they could have\nbeen\nwhich is generally just a roundabout way\nof saying who we wanted them to be\nwe look at other people and we see their\npotential and we're frustrated and\ndisappointed that they haven't yet\nmanifested in its entirety that\npotential\nfunctional hopelessness basically means\nthat you give up hope that the potential\nassociated with that particular person\nwill ever be realized\nthis potential might not even actually\nexist within that person technically it\nexists only within your own mind and is\nbeing projected into this other person\nyou cannot see potential it cannot be\nsensed with the eyes you cannot hear\npotential it cannot be sensed with the\nears you can only think potential it's\nsomething that can only be apprehended\nby your mind\nfunctional hopelessness means that we\ndivest ourselves of the fallacy that the\npotential of others exists anywhere\noutside of our own consciousness\nand what i found is that practicing\nfunctional hopelessness while difficult\nin the beginning can dramatically\nimprove one's relationships with others\nfor instance it's very hard to become\nfrustrated with someone when you have no\nexpectation that they will be different\nfrom how they actually are\nin this way functional hopelessness\nfacilitates the acceptance of others on\nsome level you can't accept other people\nfor who they are until you're able to\ndisabuse yourself of your own projected\nexpectations of them\nand people generally become less\ndefensive and ornery when they feel that\nother people aren't trying to change\nthem\nwhich on some level is always somewhat\ninvalidating and disapproving\nnow just for the record acceptance is\nnot the same as approval\nsometimes accepting people for who they\nare\nmeans that certain relationships have to\nend\nand this happens because you begin to\nmore clearly separate who people are\nfrom who you want them to be\nonce you do this you can make better\ndecisions about the appropriate\nplacement of certain individuals in your\nlife now this is easy to say and\nchallenging to do but see for yourself\nif functional hopelessness can't help to\nimprove the quality of your\nrelationships\nthanks for listening if you'd like to\nsuggest a topic for a future episode or\nto schedule a consultation you can reach\nme at psychaxpodcast gmail.com talk to\nyou soon\nyou"
