    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\ndon't ignore air resistance do you\nremember high school physics\nall the problems you were probably asked\nto solve require you to assume these\nunreal ideal conditions for instance\nthey asked you to ignore air resistance\nand aerodynamics problems or to ignore\nfriction and motion problems\nand while helping students understand\nthe essential forces of nature by\nreducing the level of complexity\ninvolved might be a useful intellectual\nexercise this is not at all how the real\nworld works in the real world there is\nfriction in the real world there is air\nresistance\nnow if we're used to approaching\nproblems from an ideal perspective\nthen we're likely going to become\nfrustrated when resistance presents\nitself inevitably in the course of our\naction\nfurthermore we will probably\nunderestimate the amount of time energy\nand resources required to obtain our\ngoals\nwhere there is friction and air\nresistance more time and energy is\nalways required to overcome those forces\nin the movement forward this is a\nuniversal law of nature\nrefusing to account for the presence of\nthese forces will likely result in poor\nplanning which has serious consequences\nthis is sort of akin to estimating how\nlong it will take to get from point a to\npoint b without traffic\nnot a very useful projection during\nevening rush hour so you see this kind\nof selective inattention can really\ncause problems for folks\nnow it's also important to keep in mind\nthat some things require friction and\nair resistance\nplanes fly because of air resistance\nthis force is basically what provides\nthe lift that keeps the plane in the air\nso without air resistance we couldn't\nhave flight\nprimitive fire making requires friction\nin these cases the resistant forces\nactually become the means to the end ah\nvery clever\ntake a moment to consider how you might\nbe able to use the resistance you\nencounter in your life in the service of\nyour goals\nso\nnot only is it not a good idea to ignore\nresistance in the real world because it\nwill likely increase your susceptibility\nto frustration and reduce your capacity\nto plan realistically\nbut also because doing so will de facto\nsimply prevent you from achieving\ncertain ends which require resistance to\nfunction\non the other hand if you expect\nresistance you can factor that into your\ncalculations to make more prudent\nestimates\nyou can also better keep your cool when\nthings go sideways because on some level\nthe resistance was part of your plan all\nalong\nthanks for listening if you'd like to\nsuggest a topic for a future episode or\nto schedule a consultation you can reach\nme at cychaxpodcast gmail.com talk to\nyou soon"
