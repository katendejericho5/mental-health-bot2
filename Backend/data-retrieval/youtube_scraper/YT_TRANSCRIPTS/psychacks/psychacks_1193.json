    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\npersona 5 and social stats\nso this is going to be another pop\npsychology episode in which we turn our\nattention to the very excellent video\ngame persona 5. this game is so good and\nso psychological that we could probably\nget hundreds of hours of content\nanalysis out of it\ni played it for the first time earlier\nthis year and i can safely say that it's\none of the best role-playing games i've\nplayed in my entire life highly\nrecommended\nnow the persona series does so many\nthings uniquely within the context of\nthe genre of role-playing games\nand today i'd like to talk about one\nsuch unique element and its significance\nfor real life\nnow in all role-playing games your\ncharacters have stats\nhowever these are usually very basic\nstats and related to combat things like\nhit points and strength and vitality etc\nnow persona 5 has those basic stats but\nit also has social stats which pertain\nto your social competence in the real\nworld of human relationships\nspecifically persona 5 has five social\nstats knowledge\nguts\nproficiency\nkindness and charm\nand i think they're fairly orthogonal\nfor example having a lot of knowledge\nwouldn't necessarily make you very kind\nand vice versa\nnow as you move through the world of the\ngame\nyour character encounters social stat\ngatekeeping\nwhich basically means that if your\nrelevant stats aren't high enough you\ncan't do certain things like work\nparticular jobs or enter into specific\nrelationships with people and this is\nabsolutely the case in real life\nyou can't be a cowardly oaf and\nsuccessfully ask out the popular girl\nyou can't be an incompetent idiot and\nget into medical school it's just not\npossible to seize certain opportunities\nif your social stats aren't high enough\nnow in the game your character's social\nstats all start at level one which i\nthink is also fairly true to life\nwhile there is some room for individual\ndifference\nwe all more or less start life as\ncharmless selfish incompetent cowardly\nidiots\nso for you younger listeners out there\ntake heart you're not alone we all\nbasically enter into society at level\none\nhowever with sufficient effort and\nexperience we can eventually become wise\nbrave\ncapable compassionate and charming\nindividuals\nand how do we do that\nwell like in the game\nit largely depends on how you choose to\nspend your time\ncertain activities among other more\ntangible rewards will increase specific\nsocial stats\nwhile other activities will just cause\nthe time to pass\nwhich stats you increase will depend on\nthe activity and no activity will raise\nall the stats simultaneously\nthis means just like life\nyou need to make choices about your\npriorities about the aspects of your\npersonality that are relatively more\nimportant to develop\nnow in the game there are many\nactivities that will raise your social\nstats and these also mirror real life\nhowever two primary ways to raise your\nstats are by consuming art like reading\nbooks or watching movies and by working\npart-time jobs which require you to\nserve other people in some capacity\nhanging out with your friends and having\nnew experiences can also do the trick\nbasically the way that you spend your\ntime will impact your social stat\ndevelopment\nand as your social stats increase you\nwill gain access to more and better\nopportunities more and better jobs and\nmore and better relationships\nso this is something we can examine in\nour own lives how are we spending our\ntime\nare we using our time to level up to\nintentionally develop certain attributes\nor are we simply allowing the time to\npass\nwithout a doubt\ntime in persona 5 like life\nis by far\nour most precious and limited resource\nso let's make sure that we're spending\nit wisely\ni hope you enjoyed this talk in the\nmeantime if you'd like to suggest a\ntopic for a future episode or you'd like\nto schedule a consultation you can reach\nme at cychaxpodcast gmail.com talk to\nyou soon"
