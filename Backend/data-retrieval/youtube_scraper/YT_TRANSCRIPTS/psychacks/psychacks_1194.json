    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nthe best years of your life\nnow if you're a younger person\nand you've spoken with folks of an older\ngeneration it's generally only a matter\nof time before you're told the time in\nand around your college years say your\nlate teens to your early twenties is\nquote the best years of your life\nand having spoken to a lot of young\npeople in this age group i've discovered\nthat to the extent that that individual\nbelieves this to be true\nthese young people experience a lot of\npressure and a lot of fomo\nthere can be this almost manic quality\nto their behavior as though this is\ntheir one and only chance to enjoy life\nbefore their crushing descent into full\nadulthood\nnow it's certainly true that\nresponsibilities tend to increase over\ntime\nhowever as responsibilities tend to\nincrease so too do privileges like\nresources and opportunities so it's kind\nof fair\nand it can certainly be true that young\npeople while experiencing a high degree\nof freedom from restriction and\nobligation\nstill lack a good deal of freedom to\nmanifest their desires into being\nwhich means that in some respects their\nfreedom is somewhat squandered by their\ncircumstances\nmy argument to this belief that the\nearly 20s or the best years of one's\nlife\nis basically an examination of the lives\nof those who believe it\nare these people happy now\nan older person who romanticizes this\nphase of life often feels regretful and\nrestricted as a consequence of his\nchoices\nand so longs to return to a time before\nhe quote was forced to decide\nhis responsibilities did not provide him\nan adequate return for the sacrifices\ninvolved\nso he yearns for the days of possibility\nand potential before his choices\ncumulatively conspired to situate him in\nhis current location\non the other hand those who made quote\nbetter decisions that is decisions that\nfacilitated the development of their\nbest interests and chosen lifestyle\ntheir lives get better with time and\nthis is because with each passing year\nthey accumulate more resources and more\nopportunities to execute on their\npreferences\nresources and opportunities they may\nhave lacked when they were younger\nas a result these folks experience an\nincrease of freedom with the passage of\ntime both freedom from onerous\nrestriction and freedom to realize their\nchosen path\nit all comes down to the choices we make\nin life the best years of your life are\nbehind you\nif your choices have locked you into a\nsub-optimal lifestyle\nand the best years of your life are\nahead of you if your choices facilitate\nthe development of your chosen lifestyle\nhopefully that makes sense\nin the meantime if you'd like to suggest\na topic for a future episode or you'd\nlike to schedule a consultation you can\nreach me at psych hackspodcast gmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
