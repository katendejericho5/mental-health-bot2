    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is roads\nonly go where they go\ni like to use this metaphor when i'm\ndealing with the prospect of relapse\nthis could be relapse into a substance\nuse addiction but it can also be\nrelapsed into any other vice or bad\nhabit overeating procrastination\ninsecurity etc\nbasically it goes like this the moment\nbefore a person decides to commit to a\nrelapse behavior\nthere are generally some thoughts that\nare endorsed prior to that decision\nand a very common such thought that\noccurs prior to relapse is this time it\nwill be different\nthe circumstances are such that i\nbelieve i can reasonably expect a\ndifferent outcome this time it will be\ndifferent\nwell\nwhat if it isn't what if you've been\ndown that road before\nwhat if you've been down that road\nbefore hundreds if not thousands of\ntimes and what if you've been down that\nroad hundreds if not thousands of times\nand it consistently and reliably took\nyou to the same destination\nthat snooping through your partner's\nphone just made you jealous that one\ndrink turned into 20 that leaving your\nhouse at that time made you late for the\nmeeting it's like how many times do you\nreally need to go down that road until\nyou're certain that it will only take\nyou to that destination\nyou've been down that road so many times\nyou know every house on that street\nyou know every brick in that pavement\nthis is because\nroads only go where they go\nroads are inflexible with respect to\ntheir pathways to certain destinations\nyou can't take the same pathway and\nexpect to arrive at a different\ndestination\nno one is confused about this fact of\nreality with respect to actual roads\nhowever many people are confused about\nthe fact that certain behaviors are just\nas inflexible for them\nwith respect to their pathways to\ncertain outcomes as roads are with\nrespect to their pathways to certain\ndestinations\ni mean that's the definition of insanity\nright doing something over and over\nagain and expecting a different result\nand all this insanity can actually be\ntraced back to one problematic cognition\nthis one fleeting thought that typically\narises in the moment before relapse that\nthis time it will be different\nno it's not\nthat road only goes where it goes my\nfriend\nand when folks become increasingly\nmindful of this cognition they can start\nturning around\nsooner\nthey don't have to go as far down the\nroad as they used to\nand ultimately they can eventually avoid\nthat street altogether\nfavoring pathways that actually take\nthem to their desired destinations\ni hope this helps if you have a topic\nyou'd like to suggest for a future\nepisode or you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at psych\nhackspodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
