    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psychex\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is theory\nof mind\ntheory of mind is a technical term from\npsychology\nit's a little clunky but it basically\nmeans that we tend to believe that other\npeople think the same way that we do\neach of us only has direct access to\nthat portion of our consciousness at\nwhich we are aware or could conceivably\nbecome aware\nhowever we tend to project that portion\ninto the minds of everybody else in\norder to make interpersonal interaction\nefficient let alone possible\nwe tend to engage with others through\nthat projected portion of our own\nconsciousness\non the whole\nthis is sort of a necessary evil for\nlack of a better word because it's just\nnot possible to directly experience the\ncontent of another person's\nconsciousness\nand on some level it's safer to assume\nthat despite all our differences\nwe have more in common than we don't\nlike for example we assume a certain\npreference to avoid pain and disrespect\nin other people\non the grounds that we ourselves would\nprefer to avoid those things\nand this projected assumption keeps\nsociety more or less\ncivil\nso you can see how theory of mind can be\nusefully\npro-social theory of mind can also be an\neffective pathway by which to change our\nactual experience of reality let's get a\nbit more concrete\noften i talk about theory of mind with\nfolks who are suffering from social\nanxiety\nwhen i talk to these people about what\nactually constitutes their experience of\nsocial anxiety\nthey tell me that they feel as though\nthey are constantly being judged\nnegatively by other people\nthey generally don't have any concrete\nproof of these negative judgments\nhowever on some level they believe that\nthey can in a non-psychotic way\nread these people's minds and ascertain\ntheir private thoughts\nthe social anxiety sufferers believe\nthey're being judged as awkward or\nstupid or unattractive\netc\nthen i talk to these people a little bit\nmore and i generally come to learn that\nthese very same people who believe that\nother people are judging them negatively\nare almost constantly in the process of\njudging other people negatively\nsocially anxious folks are often\nvery very judgmental of other people\nand by virtue of the theory of mind\nthese people are assuming that other\npeople are behaving in the privacy of\ntheir consciousness\nthe way that they themselves are\nbehaving in the privacy of their own\nconsciousness\nand they are unconsciously projecting\nthese tendencies onto other people\nbasically if i'm judging other people\nnegatively on a consistent basis then\ni'm going to assume that other people\nare doing the same thing as a matter of\ncourse\nso\nwhat does this have to do with changing\nour experience of reality well in this\ncase we can change our experience of\nreality by altering the content of our\nown consciousness\nfor instance with socially anxious folks\ni typically ask them to become\nincreasingly mindful of their own\nnegative judgments of others and to\nrestructure those judgments using the\nblock and replace technique\nand when they start to generate some\nmomentum in this direction and the\nfrequency and intensity of their\nnegative judgments of others begins to\ndecline\nlo and behold all of a sudden\npeople don't seem to be as judgmental as\nthey used to be\nit's fascinating\nand this i think is how we can\npotentially understand the buddhist\nadmonition to change the world by\nchanging yourself it's through the\nfunction and process of the theory of\nmind\nif we change the content and structure\nof our own consciousness\nthen\nby virtue of this unconscious projection\nthat on some level we can't really\ncontrol\nwe come to live in a world that's\nincreasingly aligned with these changes\ninevitably and by default on some level\nit can't not occur\nso that's what i'd like you to consider\nto what extent can i intentionally\nchange my own perceptions of reality to\ncreate an experience of reality that's\nmore aligned with my own self-interests\nso that's what i have for you today if\nyou'd like to suggest a topic for a\nfuture episode or to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at psychax\npodcast gmail.com thanks for listening"
