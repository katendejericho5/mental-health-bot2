    "transcript": "there is a time and a place to\nappropriately communicate Sexual Energy\nas a man to a woman and you cannot do\nthat at the same moment that you're\nrespecting someone it's not possible\nthis is an interesting idea I'd like to\nmake an episode about this in the future\nit's called in the literature the\nMadonna complex have you heard\nabout that okay the the issue is that\nwhen a man starts to love a woman or\nwhen the woman has his children and he\nsees her primarily as the mother of his\nchildren as opposed to his wife or his\nlover he can lose a lot of the sexual\ninterest and attraction for her which\nusually harms their marriage or\nrelationship and doesn't feel good for\nthe woman at all right and the issue is\nthat it's actually really hard to\nsomeone that you love as a man it's very\nvery hard"
