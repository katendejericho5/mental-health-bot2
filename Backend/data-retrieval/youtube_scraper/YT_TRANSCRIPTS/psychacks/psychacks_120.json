    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is never\npunish people for doing what you\nwant now you might be thinking Orion why\nthe would anybody punish somebody\nfor doing what they wanted well I'm here\nto tell you that this unfortunate\ndecision occurs every single day and\ntoday I'm going to explain why people do\nthis and what can be done\nInstead This is a reality that I\nencounter every week in my clinical\npractice people aren't entirely\nsatisfied with their relationships and\nthey are attempting to influence their\nPartners to change certain problematic\nbehaviors they want this person to do\nmore of certain things Andor less of\ncertain other things and in their minds\nthey kind of have an ideal template with\nrespect to what successful change is\nsupposed to look like now it's hard\nenough to influence people to even make\nan effort in the direction of doing what\nyou want especially if they are not\nintrinsically motivated to do so and\nthis effort when it does occur is going\nto feel very risky for the people in\nquestion this is because they are likely\nambivalent about the change a part of\nthem might want to change and a part of\nthem might not want to change this means\nthat they might not really want to do\nthe thing but they might be willing to\nkind of try for the sake of the\nrelationship what's more this might be\nsomething that they've never done before\nor haven't done in a very long time so\nthey may feel insecure or self-conscious\nabout the attempt in any case\nambivalence plus inexperience equals\nemotional risk and this is why most\npeople frankly just won't even make the\neffort and those that do in all\nlikelihood are going to fall far short\nwith respect to what you had envisioned\nfor the change and this is precisely\nwhere people up if the other person\nactually assumes the emotional risk and\nmakes an attempt to move in the\ndirection of your desired change then no\nmatter how fumbling or disappointing or\nunsatisfying or imperfect their attempt\nnever ever ever punish them for their\neffort if all you do in response to this\nattempt is point out how far it falls\nshort of your ideal template then this\nwill likely be perceived as punitive to\nthe individual involved irrespective of\nhow softly you deliver your constructive\ncriticism and if you punish someone\ndespite their willingness to assume risk\nand make an effort then good\nluck ever trying to get that person to\nmake an effort again like seriously you\nmight never get another attempt out of\nthem\nagain if someone is willing to do\nsomething that they've never done before\nand might not entirely want to do just\nbecause you want them to do it then you\nkind of have to expect that their\nattempt will be somewhat awkward or\nincompetent or hesitant or unsatisfying\nthat's to be expected my dudes the first\nattempt might be five% of what you\nultimately imagine them capable of doing\nhowever if you just focus on how poor\nand unacceptable and problematic that 5%\nstill is I guarantee you'll never get to\n10% and how you ever going to get to\n100% if you can't even get to 10%\nfocusing on the 95% of what they're\nexpectedly still not doing right is\ngoing to feel invalidating and\ndemotivating don't do this whenever\nsomeone makes any kind of effort to move\nin the direction of where you would like\nthem to go then you need to reward that\nbehavior no matter how rough or\nunacceptable that effort might currently\nbe if it's moving in the right direction\nction it needs to be rewarded this is\nthe power of shaping guys now before I\ngo any further if you're liking what\nyou're hearing then please consider\nsending this episode to someone who\nmight benefit from its message because\nit's Word of Mouth referrals like this\nthat really helped to make the channel\ngrow I'm also proud to announce that my\nbook the value

out an\ninquiry form on my website if you're\ninterested in booking a paid\nconsultation links to everything in the\ndescription okay let's get back to\nit now have you ever been to\nSeaWorld how do you think the trainers\ngot those Dolphins to jump in the air\nand do like three back flips and hit a\nbeachball through a flaming hoop before\ndiving into a center of a whirl poool\nEtc like do you think they did that on\nthe their first try you think a dolphin\njust kind of spontaneously did that you\nthink it was a dolphin's idea to behave\nthat way and yet here we are what those\ntrainers were able to do was shape the\nDolphin's Behavior over time shaping is\na term from behavioral psychology it\nmeans to reward successive\napproximations of the target Behavior\nI'll repeat that shaping means to reward\nsuccessive approximations of the target\nbehavior in this way you kind of create\na game of hot and cold with respect to\nyour reinforcement contingencies when\npeople get warmer that is when they move\nin the direction of where you want them\nto go you reward them and when people\nget colder that is when they move not in\nthe direction of where you want them to\ngo you don't reward them notice I didn't\nsay you punish them you shouldn't do\nthat you just shouldn't reward them and\nthrough shap in all kinds of living\nthings can be helped to perform all\nkinds of wonderful and amazing feats\nirrespective of whether they comprehend\nor can comprehend the ultimate purpose\nof this process it's powerful stuff and\nall that is required is the willingness\nto reward successive approximations of\nthe target Behavior now this can take\nmonths this can even take years but it\nalmost always works and it even works in\ndependent of the awareness of both the\nperson doing the rewarding and the\nperson being rewarded that is neither\nparty needs to know that this is what\nthey're doing and in fact most people\nshape other people's behavior\nunconsciously and unintentionally which\nis how they end up in Dysfunctional\ninterpersonal patterns that they didn't\nconsciously want so my perspective is\nthat shaping is going to happen anyway\nso you might as well become aare aare of\nthe process and implement it\nintentionally and in this way people can\nbe supported to do all kinds of positive\nthings that a they might not ever\nspontaneously do themselves B they may\nnot entirely want to do and C might be\nfor their own benefit like if a person\ncan be shaped to be a better partner for\ntheir partner how is that not mutually\nbeneficial in the majority of cases it's\na win-win situation\nnow you'll encounter backsliding\nthroughout the shaping process however\nit's essential that this backsliding not\nbe actively punished just remove the\nreward and replace it with a neutral\nnon-reinforcing response and when they\nonce again start to move in the\ndirection you want them to go just\nreinstate the reinforcement the idea is\nto reward moving an inch as opposed to\npunish just moving an inch because let\nme tell you punishing people for making\nan effort is one of the shest ways to\n people up psychologically like the\npeople who are punished for doing what\nthey are supposed to do can become\nvillainous not a good idea it's also\nincredibly counterproductive with\nrespect to your chosen goals it's like\nfool me once shame on you fool me twice\nyou ain't gonna fool me again so if you\nwant to influence your partner to do\nwhat you want them to do then you're\ngoing to have to be patient you're going\nto have to be kind and you're going to\nhave to be generous and if you can't be\nthose things for whatever reason you\nprobably shouldn't try to influence\ntheir behavior because you're probably\njust going to it up and make it\nharder for everybody it's very difficult\nto change a pre-existing Habit in some\ncases it's actually a better idea to\njust break up and start over with\nsomeone who is naturally closer to the\nbehavior you have in mind than to try to\nshape a pre-existing partner in the\ndirection of that goal if that behavior\nis that important to you the process is\ngoing to take time and energy and\nresources but if you don't want to break\nup then you have to kind of be available\nfor the Long Haul and to be willing to\nhelp your partner through encouragement\nand validation and acknowledgement and\npraise to become who you'd prefer them\nto be what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know in\nthe comments below as
