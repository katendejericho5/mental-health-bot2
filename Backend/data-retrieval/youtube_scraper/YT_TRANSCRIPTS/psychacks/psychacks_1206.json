    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nwork\nis an auction house\nso this is a metaphor i often use with\nclients with respect to their\nprofessional trajectories\nyou ever been to an auction house\nthere's something for sale people are\nbidding and the lot ultimately goes to\nwhoever offers the highest amount\nokay\nif you win a lot in an auction house\nit means that you overpaid\nwhy\nbecause by definition\nyou were the only person in the room who\nthought that lot was worth that much\nno one else thought it was that valuable\nand that's why you won\non some level overpaying is the price\nyou pay to secure the privilege of\nwinning\nhowever in the vast majority of cases\nyou probably could have bought the same\nlot for less money\nthe issue is of course that you don't\nknow\nhow much less money you could have used\nto buy that lot it could have been a\ndollar less it could have been a million\ndollars less\nbut you almost certainly could have\nsaved some money on that transaction\nand this excessive spending isn't that\nbig of a deal if you're only going to\nthe auction house every once in a while\nbut if you're going there every single\nday to bid on multiple lots\nthe extent to which you're overpaying\ncan create a significant liability for\nyou over time because we don't have\ninfinite resources we all have a finite\nstore of time energy and money and if\nyou're overpaying on 10 lots that might\nmean that you're not going to be\ncompetitive for the 11th\nso what does this have to do with work\nbasically it means that if you're\nwinning if you're successful if things\nare going smoothly\nit might mean that you're over bidding\nthat you could potentially secure the\nsame results with less time and effort\nand the only way to figure out the\nextent to which you're over bidding\nis to systematically experiment with\nyour time and effort investments\npull back a little bit and see what\nhappens\nobviously you need to use your good\njudgment here don't experiment on a\ncritical project or an essential\nresponsibility target less important\ncomponents of your work first\nremove some of your time and effort\nfocus on satisficing as opposed to\noptimizing\nand observe the result\ndid anybody even notice\ndid this create a problem for anybody\nelse\nhuh\nmaybe i had this idea in my mind about a\ncertain standard of quality or\nproficiency that was required for me to\ndemonstrate in order to secure a\nsuccessful result\nand maybe that standard simply exists in\nmy own head\nmaybe it's not necessarily true huh\nwell in what other aspects of my work or\nlife am i overpaying in terms of time\nenergy or emotional investment in order\nto get the same result\nand when we begin to be a bit more\ndeliberate and systematic about how we\nchoose to allocate our time and energy\nthen we actually liberate some of those\nresources to be productively invested in\nother aspects of our lives\nwhich makes our lives not just our work\nmore very interesting and rewarding\nsomething to keep in mind\nand remember that if pulling back really\ncreates an issue\ntrust that people will let you know\nit's just like in sports\nunless the foul is really flagrant the\nref isn't gonna go straight for the red\ncard usually it's just a whistle\nand if you don't hear anything assume\nthe ball is still in play\nthanks for listening if you have a topic\nyou'd like discussed in a future episode\nor would like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psychhackspodcast\ngmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
