    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nthe nature of identity\nso identity is a word that gets thrown\naround a lot today's day and age and it\ncan also if misapplied cause a great\ndeal of suffering\nbecause if we identify with something\nthat isn't actually ourselves we treat\nthat something as an extension of our\nessential being which leaves us far more\nvulnerable to envy frustration\ndisappointment and a whole host of other\nnegative emotions\nit's very important to carefully define\nwhere you end and the rest of the world\nbegins\nto draw a boundary between your identity\nwho you are\nand everything else that happens to\noccupy a place in your life for a time\nso the thought experiment that i usually\nask my clients to perform when examining\nwhere exactly to draw that line is this\nidentity is what is left when everything\nthat can be taken from you is taken from\nyou\nidentity is what is left when everything\nthat can be taken from you is taken from\nyou anything that can be taken from you\nis not you\nit's something that you have it's not\nsomething that you are\nif you can exist without it it's not you\nso that means that you are not your job\nyour job can be taken from you you are\nnot your bank account your money can be\ntaken from you you are not your\nrelationships relationships end every\nday\nyou are not your children unfortunately\nyou can't guarantee their health forever\nthe fact of the matter is that\neverything that can be taken from you\nwill be taken from you\neventually\nit's only a matter of time\nso everything that you have is basically\non loan on loan from a good friend i\nhope so you're likely to take good care\nof it\nbut when it's time to give it back you\ncan say thanks for letting me borrow it\nand can let it go without strong\nattachment with a spirit of gratitude\nnow if you carry this thought experiment\nto its logical conclusion that is you\nidentify what is left when everything\nthat can be taken from you is taken from\nyou\nwhat remains\nin my understanding there's really only\ntwo possibilities and they roughly\ncorrespond to the teachings of eastern\nand western spiritual traditions\non the one hand which is more common in\neastern traditions\nwhat is left is\nnothing\nthere's nothing left when everything\nthat can be taken from you is taken from\nyou this is the essence of buddhist\nteaching which is sort of like the ego\nthe self\nis basically an illusion that arises out\nof the aggregation of sense impressions\nand memory\nand on some level the work of that\npractice is to systematically obliterate\nthat illusion\nwhich creates an attachment to a sense\nof self that doesn't actually exist so\nthat's one possibility\non the other hand which is more common\nin western traditions\nwhat is left is some essential\nindestructible essence like a soul or a\nspirit\nthis essence will outlive the death of\nthe body and therefore isn't simply a\nconsequence of physiological processes\nor brain activation and this essence is\nultimately who you are\nnow i don't know which one is right but\nit seems to me that both possibilities\nkind of arrive at the same destination\nby different pathways namely the\ninvulnerability of the self\nbecause obviously if there is no self it\ncan't be hurt since there's no one to\nhurt\nand if you're an indestructible entity\nthat survives death\nthen what could possibly harm you even\ndeath can't touch you\nin both cases the individual can be\nconsidered impervious to suffering which\nis one of the refuges offered by\nreligion\ntry it out for yourself\nwho are you when everything that can be\ntaken from you is taken from you that is\nyour identity and that is where you want\nto draw the line\nthanks for listening if you have a topic\nyou'd like discussed in a future episode\nor would like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psych hackspodcast\ngmail.com talk to you soon"
