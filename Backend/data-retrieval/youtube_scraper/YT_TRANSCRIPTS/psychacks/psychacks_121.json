    "transcript": "so there are a lot of women in the west\ntoday who are doing very well at least\nfrom the standpoint of material success\nnow the public facing personas of these\nwomen tend to be more masculine or\nassertive because those traits\nfunctionally help them to compete\nsuccessfully in the professional Arena\nhowever it would be a mistake to assume\nthat this is how these same women\nnecessarily behave behind closed doors\nin fact many of these women are looking\nto relax into their feminine if not be\noutright dominated in their sexual\nrelationships the issue is that men kind\nof assume that the public facing Persona\nis isomorphic with the bedroom Persona\nand this scares a lot of guys off not\nbecause these women intimidate like men\nare not afraid of these women but\nbecause assertiveness and\ncompetitiveness isn't what the vast\nmajority of men are seeking in their\nintimate relationships"
