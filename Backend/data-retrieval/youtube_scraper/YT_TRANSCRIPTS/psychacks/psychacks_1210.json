    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nwant versus\nneed\nthis is a very useful construct with\nrespect to the block and replace\ntechnique will also help you do some\nruthless gardening in your mind\nso let's talk about some of the\ndifferences between both the words and\nthe concepts of want\nand need\nneed\nat the end of the day is associated with\nsurvival\nthere are very few things that we\nactually need\nwe need some food\nwe need water\nwe need some measure of safety and\nshelter\nand living in society we need some money\nto accrue these things\nand beyond that there's not much that we\nneed\nthe concept of need being associated\nwith survival is psychologically\nassociated with dissolution and death\nthe threat of dissolution and death\non the other hand the concept of want\ndesire\nis psychologically associated with\nassimilation and life\nin many respects\nneed and want are kind of like two sides\nof the same coin\nhowever which side you choose to focus\non can make an enormous difference in\nthe experience of your everyday life\nso i would encourage you to be\nincreasingly mindful of your let's say\ninappropriate use of the concept of need\nwhich would be in situations outside of\nthe realm of survival\nand block and replace this cognition\nwith another thought that uses the\nconcept of want so for example\na person might harbor the belief i need\nto be rich\nif you feel into this statement you can\nsense\nlike a low-grade anxiety permeating\nthrough this belief\nand that's because with the concept of\nneed there's an implied threat that if\nthis doesn't happen something very bad\nwill occur\nyou can almost imagine this mental slave\ndriver whipping the person in question\ninto shape in order to avoid the\npresumed catastrophic outcome\nof not being rich in this case\nnow contrast that with the belief i want\nto be rich\nthe truth is that you don't have to\navoid a negative outcome\nin order to want to make money\nrich people\nwant to make more money\ni like this reframe because it doesn't\nrequire it doesn't invite in the\nnegative as a necessary motivating\nfactor there is no ill to be avoided\njust a good to be acquired\nby transforming need statements into\nwant statements\nwe learned to focus more and more on the\npositive things in life that we want to\nsecure and this is important because\nwhat we focus on becomes the content of\nour consciousness the stuff out of which\nour reality is literally constructed\nmoment to moment\nif we focus on ills to be avoided by\nmisapplying the concept of need then\nreality becomes a dangerous place\nfull of evils lurking around every\ncorner\nand how would that not exacerbate a form\nof generalized anxiety\non the other hand if we focus on the\ngood to be acquired by utilizing the\nconcept of want then reality becomes an\nabundant place full of resources and\nopportunities\nso instead of looking for what you need\nto avoid\nsearch for what you want to find\nand a good way to do that is to be\nincreasingly mindful and intentional in\nour use of these two important concepts\nso thanks for listening if you'd like to\nsuggest a topic for a future episode or\nto schedule a consultation you can reach\nme at psycaxpodcast gmail.com talk to\nyou soon"
