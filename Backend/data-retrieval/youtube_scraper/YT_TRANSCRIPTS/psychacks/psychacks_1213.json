    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nsafe smart brave strong\nmany of you might not know this but in\nmy spare time i'm an avid outdoorsman i\ndo a lot of long distance backpacking\nand mountain climbing and i often do\nthese trips solo which can increase the\ninherent risk factor of these activities\nsomewhat\nnow i've been doing this for a very long\ntime now and i've developed this\npersonal motto or mantra\nwhich is the title of this episode save\nsmart brave strong\nand this is basically how i approach\nmoving into the wilderness independently\nand i want to explain what this means\nbecause i think that it can be\ngeneralizable to a lot of other aspects\nof our lives\nbasically there's an order to this\nprogression safe smart brave strong\nbecause\nif you're safe\nyou don't really have to be smart\ni mean think about it think about those\nbirds that lived on isolated islands in\nthe pacific for hundreds or thousands of\nyears without any natural predators\nwhen humans first showed up they could\njust walk up to these birds bunk them on\nthe head and throw them in their ships\nthey were so safe for so long that they\ncompletely lost all forms of caution and\ncleverness and this was obviously to\ntheir detriment on some level we see\nthis in western society today thousands\nand thousands of people die every year\nfrom an abundance of safety\nthat is there often doesn't seem to be\nany immediate negative consequences to\nmaking certain bad decisions\nso for example\nthey eat or drink themselves to death or\ndie in ways that would have been\npreventable with just a little prudence\nquite the paradox that too much safety\ncan be dangerous but that's how it is\nnow if you're not safe\nand moving into the wilderness is an\ninherently risky venture if you're not\nsafe\nyou have to be smart\nbeing smart\nusing your intelligence and good\njudgment can help you to avoid a lot of\nunjustified dangers and ultimately it's\nmuch much better to prevent a disastrous\nsituation than to try to survive it\nnow that said\nsometimes you're not always going to be\nsmart\nsometimes you're going to zig when you\nshould as add\nand if you're not safe and you haven't\nmade smart decisions\nthen you're going to have to be brave\nyou'll need to muster courage in order\nto face the danger forthrightly and pass\nthrough the difficult moment without\nsuccumbing to fear or despair do you\nunderstand it's better to avoid the\navoidable danger but if you can't\nbecause of your decisions you have to be\nbrave\nhowever\nif you aren't safe\nyou weren't smart and you couldn't be\nbrave because you're afraid\nthen you have to be strong\nit's the only option left\nbeing strong means metaphorically that\nyou hold on as tightly as you can that\nyou put all of your will into your hand\nand you refuse to let go no matter what\nthat's what being strong means it means\nbeing able to endure to persevere to\nsurvive no matter what\nyou make your will into iron and you\nrefuse to surrender\nit's not a very pleasant place to live\nand you don't want to stay there any\nlonger than you need to\nbut that's really our last option\nif we aren't safe we weren't smart and\nwe couldn't be brave\nnow i bring this up because you'll\nnotice you don't lead with strength\nstrength is what you need when smartness\nand bravery fail\nso it's a good idea to develop your\nstrength of course no one has ever\nwanted to be weaker but it's a much\nbetter idea to develop your intelligence\nyour cleverness and discernment and your\ncourage and bravery because if you\ndevelop those virtues sufficiently you\ndon't have to be as strong you don't\nhave to be in survival mode all the time\njust enduring life and you get to have a\nlot more fun to boot\nso that's all i have to say on the\nmatter if you'd like to suggest a topic\nfor a future episode or to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at psych\nhackspodcast gmail.com until next time"
