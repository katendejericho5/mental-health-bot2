    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis the trap of why\nso this is something that people are\nsubject to falling into\nespecially following a painful loss or\nsetback\nthe end of a relationship the death of a\nloved one things like that\nand i think it's perfectly natural for a\nperson in such a situation in the midst\nof grief\nto search for meaning to question why\nwhy did this happen\nwhy did this occur now to a certain\nextent\nthis question is useful it's sort of\nlike reviewing the tape after losing a\nfootball match\nby performing a postmortem for example\nyou can see where you zigged\nwhen you should have zagged and the goal\nof reviewing that tape\nis to glean a few lessons that you can\nimplement in future games moving forward\nthis is useful and unproblematic however\nafter reviewing the tape it's useful to\nput it away\nand get ready for the next match people\nwho fall into the trap of why\nkeep reviewing the tape over and over\nand\nover and over again and this can happen\nbecause no why question why did this\nhappen\never has a single definitive answer\nthat is so valid and unimpeachable that\nit will resolve\nall future doubts on the subject until\nthe end of time\nthere is no such answer that will\ncontain the perfect and total\nexplanation\nfor why something occurred it's just\nsort of beyond our can\nbeyond our human understanding but\nin the search for just such an answer\nsome people can fall\nprey to playing that tape obsessively\nhundreds of times\nthousands of times at this point they're\nnot really learning anything new\nthey're just sort of ruminating on their\npast mistakes or their past misfortune\nand this isn't very useful at all doing\nthis is like picking a scab\nby not allowing the wound to heal these\nfolks maintain a kind of emotional\nconnection to the lost\nobject a painful connection to be sure\nbut to many people\na painful connection is preferable to no\nconnection at all\nit's a way of keeping the lost object\nalive in the emotional memory of the\ngriever\nthat's really what that's about so\nin general there are good enough answers\nto why questions\nbut no completely satisfying ones people\ndon't stop\nasking why when they arrive at a\ndefinitive answer\nthey stop asking why when they decide\nto stop asking why at this point\nthe question changes from why did this\nhappen to\nbecause this happened what do i do\nmoving forward\na decision that ideally will be informed\nby the lessons one gleaned\nfrom the good enough answers to the\nquestion of why\nso those are my thoughts on the matter\nif you have a topic you'd like discussed\nin a future episode or would like to\nschedule a consultation\nplease reach out to psychaxpodcast\ngmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
