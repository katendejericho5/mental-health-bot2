    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis how to forgive forgiveness\nis really at the core of healing when it\ncomes to the psychotherapeutic process\nit's a skill and it's a skill that at\nleast in my own experience\nno one really taught me how to do even\nthough my loved ones in society more or\nless expects forgiveness from me on a\nregular basis\nthe first thing i want to clarify with\nrespect to forgiveness is that\nforgiveness\nis an intrapersonal not interpersonal\nbehavior\nthat means that forgiveness doesn't\nactually involve\nthe other person you can forgive someone\nwithout\never talking to that person again for\nthe rest of your life\nforgiveness is an intrapersonal behavior\nit's something that you do\nwithin your own heart and mind and you\ndo it for yourself forgiveness\nalso does not approve or condone a\ncertain behavior\nforgiveness is a skill by which you\nrelieve yourself of the resentment\nthat would otherwise embitter your heart\nas a result of moving through a painful\nexperience now the issue\nwhen it comes to forgiveness is that too\nmany people get hung up on the specific\nbehavior in question they think for\ninstance\nthis person cheated on me and i would\nnever cheat so i can't get around the\nfact that someone will decide to do this\nit's\nunforgivable or this person\nlied to me i would never do that i would\nnever lie to someone\nso i'm hung up on this specific\nunforgivable behavior\nnow this is what i would like you to\nconsider instead of focusing on the\nspecific behavior\ntry to shift your focus to the\nconditions\nfrom which the behavior likely emerged\nthink about it if this person acted that\nway\nand what they did was really bad\nthen they must not have really\nunderstood the consequences of that\naction\nwhich means they acted out of ignorance\nand confusion\nthey were lost in darkness they thought\nin the moment that what they were doing\nwas good\nbut they were wrong they were deceived\nby their emotions\nand here's the key i know what that's\nlike\ni know what it's like to be ignorant i\nknow what it's like to be confused\ni know what it's like to be lost in\ndarkness and i've definitely made\nchoices in a highly emotional state that\nat the time\nfelt right but i eventually came to\nregret\nand i also know that i don't think of\nmyself as\nall bad so this person and i\nactually do have some things in common\nsome important things in common\nat least with respect to the underlying\nconditions that give rise to poor\ndecisions\ni also remember that i was in a lot of\npain when i made those choices\ni definitely wasn't living my best life\nso by making use of this perspective\ntaking exercise it's possible to\ntransform\nanger into a kind of pity for the\nexperience\nof being lost in darkness we all know\nwhat that's like\nand i don't think any of us would choose\nto revisit that state\nand that's precisely the state the\nperson i'm angry at was in\nwhen they chose to do what they did now\ndepending on the circumstances\nyou may have to do this perspective\ntaking exercise hundreds of times\nbut it's something that you can meditate\non in the privacy of your own heart\nin order to let go of resentment over\ntime\nand that's how you forgive i hope this\nhelps\nif you have a topic you'd like discussed\nin a future episode or would like to\nschedule a consultation\nplease reach out to psych hackspodcast\ngmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
