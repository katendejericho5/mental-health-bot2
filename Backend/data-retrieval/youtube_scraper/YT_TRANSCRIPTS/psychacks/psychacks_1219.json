    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban\nand this is psych hacks better living\nthrough psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nthe tale\nof bluebeard the story of bluebeard is\nan\nold fairy tale from western europe and\nif you don't know it\nallow me to briefly summarize its plot\nbasically\nbluebeard was a very wealthy nobleman\nwho married a series of women\nwho all vanished under mysterious\ncircumstances\nat the beginning of the story bluebeard\nweds another beautiful young woman\nand he gives her the keys to all the\nrooms in his expansive mansion\nfull of riches and wonders however\nhe expressly forbids her from opening\nthe locked door in the basement\nso it's kind of reminiscent to the\ngarden of eden in the book of genesis\nthe new bride can do whatever she wants\ncan partake of all the pleasures of the\nmansion and she can go wherever she\nwants\naccepting one specific room and of\ncourse her curiosity about that one room\neventually overpowers her\nand she one day enters the forbidden\nroom and finds the mutilated corpses\nof all of bluebeard's former wives\nbluebeard catches her in the act and\nmakes to kill her but she delays her\ndeath by asking for a moment to pray\nduring which time the woman's brothers\nappear and kill bluebird\ninstead so that's the end of the story\nand why am i telling you this story i\nthink\nthat one moral of the story\nis that somewhere deep in the heart of\nman\nis a door that it might be better off\nnot to open\nthat we all have skeletons in the closet\nthough hopefully not\nliteral skeletons like in the case of\nbluebeard but emotional skeletons\nand in most cases we actually gain\nlittle by exposing them to the light\nin fact we may even endanger ourselves\nby doing so\nthis means that in relationships if you\nwant perfect transparency\nyou can't expect perfect goodness\nbecause no person\nincluding myself and yourself is\nperfectly good\nnow to be fair in the fairy tale it kind\nof makes sense for the bride to open the\ndoor because it contains a secret\nthat directly relates to the basis of\nher relationship with bluebeard\nthe secret that he kills his wives would\nreasonably influence a woman's decision\nto marry him\nhowever in real world relationships\nbetween people\nin the vast majority of cases the\nemotional skeleton\ndoesn't directly relate to the basis of\nthat relationship\nfor instance how does the secret of an\nextramarital affair\nactually relate to the basis of the\nrelationships between co-workers\nor between a politician and his\nconstituents\nsexual fidelity doesn't even play a\nsmall part in either one of those types\nof relationships\nso why open that door it doesn't hide a\nsecret\nthat can reasonably impinge upon the\nbasis of that relationship\nif you look under a rock you're gonna\nfind bugs\nand if you look at anybody close enough\nyour partner your\nchildren your neighbors and even\nyourself\nyou will eventually discover something\nthat doesn't sit right with you\nand it could be something you might have\na very hard time\never forgetting so it's kind of good\nmanners to respect the doors of others\nespecially if you wouldn't want your own\nshameful skeletons paraded through the\nlight of day\nand the presence of that door doesn't\nmake you a bad person\nit doesn't mean you're incapable of\ndoing good it just means that you're\ncomplex a mixture of good and bad\ndarkness and light like the rest of us\nand accepting that fact about yourself\nwill probably help make you more\ntolerant of the complexities of others\nso that's what i have to say if you have\na topic you'd like discussed in a future\nepisode or would like to schedule a\nconsultation\nplease reach out to psych hackspodcast\ngmail.com\nwe'll talk more in future episodes"
