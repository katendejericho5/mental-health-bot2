    "transcript": "one of the things that we learned from\nJohn gottman's lab when he was studying\nlet's say micro emotions so these small\ntransacted emotions that are\ncommunicated between men and women in\nrelationships is that to stay together\nthere needs to be at least at least five\npositive emotional interactions for\nevery one negative one like that's the\nminimum ratio so if it's just like as\nbad as it is good that's not worth it\nthat's a one:1 ratio and I think yeah\nand I think that's because pain is more\npainful than pleasure is pleasurable so\nlike one unit of pain according to this\nratio might be five times more intense\nthan one unit of pleasure one unit of\npositive interaction"
