    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis the block and replace technique\nblock and replace is the fundamental\nskill\nin the process of cognitive\nrestructuring which is a core component\nof cognitive behavioral therapy\nit's like wax on wax off it's the most\nbasic technique\nthat undergirds the entire process of\ncognitive change\nso what is it it's very simple it has to\nbe simple to be so\nfoundational we are subject to all kinds\nof cognitions\nand among these are some that are very\nnegative\nand these negative cognitions are\ngenerally judgments\nabout ourselves other people in the\nworld\nsome of these judgments can be automatic\nseemingly instantaneous\nand they can occur hundreds if not\nthousands of times a day\nthe problem with that is that while\nwe're free to think whatever we want\nwe're not free to feel however we want\nas a consequence of what we choose to\nthink\nso if our consciousness is inundated\nwith negative judgments and evaluations\nabout ourselves and the world\nhow are we not going to feel negatively\nin some way shape or form\nwhether it's envy or despair or outrage\nof course we're going to feel in\nalignment\nwith what we choose to believe is true\nso once we begin to be more mindfully\naware\nof the negative judgments we're subject\nto experiencing in our consciousness\nand we're ready to make a change we take\nadvantage of the block and replace\ntechnique to do so\nthe first step is to block that thought\nto actually say\nno to it either in the province of your\nown mind\nor even more effectively out loud say no\ni don't want to think that thought right\nnow no that's not true\nsometimes we have to stand up to bullies\nand many of our biggest bullies may\nexist within our own minds\nremember that our thoughts are not\nalways our friends so\nno that's not true i'm not a piece of\ni'm not unlovable i'm not incompetent\nit's not true that nothing good ever\nhappens to me or whatever happens to be\nthe bent of your particular bully\nokay so far so good the second step\nis to replace that thought in changing\nany habit you're only going to get so\nfar if\nall you're trying to do is to not do\nwhat you don't want to do\na better strategy is to not do what you\ndon't want to do and replace that\nbehavior with something you do want to\ndo\nand the key here with respect to\ncognitive restructuring\nis not to replace the negative judgment\nwith the unrealistic\npositive alternative we don't replace\ni'm a piece of with\ni'm god's gift to humanity because let's\nface it that's\nthat's also not true but to replace\nthe negative judgment with the least\npathologizing explanation that still\nfits the facts of reality i'll say that\nagain we replace the negative judgment\nwith the least pathologizing explanation\nthat still fits the facts of reality\nso we're not going to bury our heads in\nthe sand and be pollyanna-ish\nour explanations need to fit reality but\nthey need to be the least pathologizing\ninterpretations of that reality\nand we'll know we've done this correctly\nif our replacement successfully\nmitigates our emotional response\nreality is neutral it just is\nit doesn't contain desire or aversion\napproach or avoid those things live in\nus\nreality just is what it is so we know\nthat we're closer to that objective\nbare bones reality if our models of\nreality\ndon't provoke much of an emotional\nreaction one way or another\nso for example i could say no i'm not a\nworthless human being\nwhile it's true that i've made some\nmistakes in the past i'm actively\nworking to improve and i'm generally a\ngood enough person\nit's hard to disagree with that\nstatement it's much\nmuch more likely to be true than the\ninitial negative cognition\nit's more accurate and it's less likely\nto provoke a strong emotional response\none way or another\nblock and replace block and replace in\nthe beginning\nyou may have to do this 10 000 times a\nday but maybe the next day\nyou'll only have to do it 9900 times a\nday and over time\nyou come to develop a cognitive habit\nthat supports your emotional well-being\nall right that's all i have to say if\nyou have a topic you would like\ndiscussed in a future episode or would\nlike to set up a consultation\nyou can contact me at psychaxpodcast\ngmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
