    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis the disconfirming emotional\nexperience\nthis is a somewhat technical term the\ndisconfirming emotional experience\nand i'm here to explain what it is and\nhow it's actually at the heart of the\ntherapeutic process\nso people come to therapy because as a\nresult of their experiences\nthey develop beliefs or models of\nreality\nthat attempt to make sense of what\nhappened to them in the past\nand that may no longer be entirely\naligned with reality in the present\nso for example let's say a particular\nclient\nhis father abandoned the family when he\nwas a boy\nand in his child appropriate egocentrism\nhe developed the belief that the\nfather's leaving was really his fault\nbecause he was too weak and needy\nmaybe even his his mother led him to\nbelieve that to be true\nkeep in mind that this needn't be a\nfully conscious belief in order to exert\ninfluence on an individual's behavior\nconsequently this client may then have\nextrapolated a rule from this belief\ndesigned to protect him from future\nabandonment something like\nif i show weakness or vulnerability i\nwill push people out of my life\nand therefore i must not show any signs\nof weakness or vulnerability\nin any of my personal relationships so\nyou see it makes\na kind of sense this belief and it\nserved the function of allowing that\nchild to feel\nas though he had some measure of control\nover his circumstances which was helpful\nas children are generally in such\npowerless dependent states of\nvia v their caregivers the issue is that\nit's not entirely aligned with reality\nmost likely the father in this case left\nthe family for reasons that had nothing\nto do with the child's expressed\nvulnerability\nand if an address this belief can come\nto loggerheads and adult interpersonal\nrelationships especially\nromantic relationships so what does this\nhave to do with therapy\nsuch an individual could potentially\narrive in therapy\nprobably because he's been having\nunsatisfying relationships\nand the treatment could just focus\nexclusively on understanding\nwhere this belief came from or\nexplicating the psychodynamic process of\nthe fear of abandonment\nor exploring the client's emotional\nexperience\nand this person could literally be in\ntherapy for\ndecades without anything appreciably\nchanging\nall of this discussion is just prelude\nto the emotionally disconfirming\nexperience which as i've said\nis at the core of the therapeutic\nprocess basically\nwhat this means is that the client\nactually needs to go through the feared\nexperience\nand come out the other side feeling that\nthings are going to be okay\nthat's it so in the context of this\nhypothetical example\nit would mean this person would need to\nbe willing to take the risk\nto show vulnerability in a relationship\nand to feel not to understand rationally\nbut to\nactually feel that he hasn't been\npunished as a result of doing so\nthat it's actually okay or that it could\neven potentially have strengthened the\nrelationship\nand this person might have to do this\nnot just once not just\ntwice but 10 or 20 times in order to\ndisentangle the behavior from the feared\noutcome\nit's not a cognitive thing it's not an\nintellectual thing\nit's an emotional thing it was really\nscary to do\ni was terrified that the feared outcome\nwas gonna transpire but it didn't\noh wow and it didn't enough times that i\ncan kind of begin to trust\nthat this belief that i created to\nprotect myself in the past may no longer\nbe necessary because it's not ultimately\nbased in the reality\nof my new present experience\nso if you're not having disconfirming\nemotional experiences in the context of\nyour therapeutic work you may need to\nreconsider what you're doing there\nso that's all i have to say if you have\na topic you would like discussed in a\nfuture episode or would like to set up a\nconsultation\nyou can contact me at psych hacks\npodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
