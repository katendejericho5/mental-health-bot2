    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is\ndon't blow the whistle on yourself\nso obviously i'm taking this metaphor\nfrom\nprofessional sports if you're engaged in\nthe flow of any sport\nyou're focused on the play you're\nfocused on the ball you're focused on\nmoving further down the field you're\nshouldn't be focused on making sure that\nyou\nare 100 within the rules of the game\nwithin the boundaries of the field\nobviously that's something you need to\nkeep in mind\nbut that shouldn't be your priority\nthere's somebody else on the field whose\njob it is to make sure that you're in\nbounds and playing by the rules that's\nthe referee\nyou can't be both the mvp and the\nreferee\nat the same time you have to trust\nthat if no one is blowing the whistle on\nyou\nyou might still be in the field of play\nthe\nthe play is still active keep running\ndown the field\nif there's a significant problem if you\ngo out of bounds\npeople will let you know your co-workers\nyour partner\nyour friends they'll call your attention\nto the fact that you've stepped out of\nbounds\nnow i'm not advising that you go out\nthere and\nlet's say flagrantly foul people to do\nthings that you know are just\nagainst the the rules and the spirit of\nthe game\nbut on some level if you're not fouling\nyou're not playing the game optimally\nit's like how successful could you be as\na basketball team if your commitment was\nis to never foul anybody fouls are part\nof the game\nand you don't foul willy-nilly you foul\nstrategically\nin the service of your goals so\nthe i'm not asking you to do anything\nthat's that's against\nuh your own conscience or to do\nsomething that is spiteful or\ntechnically against the spirit of the\ngame but if you're policing yourself\nthen that's energy and effort and focus\nthat could be better\nexpended in the service of your goals\ntrust that there will be people around\nyou\nwhose job on some level is to give you\nthe feedback\nthat hey you might need to pick up the\npace on this project a little bit\nor you know you've been slacking off\nover here or that wasn't cool what you\ndid\npeople will tell you this makes me think\nabout machine learning\noptimization according to research the\noptimal\nrate of success for machine learning\nis 85 if it's more than 85\nthey're not really learning these\nmachines they're just demonstrating what\nthey already\nknow and if it's a success rate of less\nthan 85\nthey're kind of struggling and most\nlikely are going to make inappropriate\nor incorrect conclusions\nbut if they're incorrect 15 of the time\nthat gives them space\nto actually learn and to grow\nand to develop progress so on some level\nare you making mistakes 15 of the time\nare you stepping out of bounds 15 of the\ntime that's optimal\nbecause the more that you do that the\nmore you learn how to kind of\nwalk the line if you if you notice any\nprofessional athlete at the height of\nhis or her game the action is always on\nthe line\nit's like in tennis the service what's\nright on the inside of the line\nthe the wide receivers in professional\nfootball games they're going down the\nsidelines\nand they're like putting toes on the\nfield the more masterful you get\nthe more you you learn how to work with\nthe boundaries\nbecause that's where the proficiency and\nthe\nexcellence really occurs thanks for\nlistening\nwe'll talk more in future episodes bye"
