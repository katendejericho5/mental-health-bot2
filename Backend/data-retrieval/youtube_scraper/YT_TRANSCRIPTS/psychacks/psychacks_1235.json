    "transcript": "hi i'm dr orion taraban\nand this is psych hacks better living\nthrough psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\neveryone is completely unique and\ntotally replaceable so this is sort of\nthe paradox\nwith respect to human relationships\nevery relationship that you form whether\nit's a romantic\nor a professional relationship\nit will have inside of it a very unique\nflavor\nthere will be emotions affections\nexperiences\nmemories and associations that you won't\never be able to\nreplace um with any other human being on\nthe planet\nyou know that this is true because\noftentimes i\ni hear from clients that have been in\nrelationships for extended periods of\ntime that\ntheir partner has changed and the\nfeeling or the flavor that they had when\nthey first started\ndating and when they got together you\nknow the magic is\nis gone or it's just become something\nelse\nso on some level not only is every\nrelationship\nunique but every chapter of every\nrelationship\nis unique as well so i'd like to\nremember this\nbecause we don't really\nneed to worry with respect to\n[Music]\nbeing replaced on some level because\nit's not possible it's\nalways apples to oranges um\nthere's no way that your current partner\ncould find somebody else to have the\nsame kind of relationship with\nthat relationship will always be sort of\nprotected and in violent within\neach individual's heart and mind\nbecause of its own uniqueness that said\neveryone is also totally replaceable\nwhich is that nobody the\nnobody's function is so unique\nthat there can't be somebody else\nsometimes hundreds thousands or millions\nof someone else's\nwho couldn't perform an analogous\nfunction think about it in terms of\nwork you know there's somebody in that\nrole\nwho you know this particular person was\nwas maybe very funny\nwas friends with with jack and diane\num would come to meetings a little bit\nlate but got the job done\nthat was their unique flavor that they\nbrought to that position\num but if that person leaves or is fired\nthey're going to bring somebody else in\nto do the hr and this person might bring\ndonuts\nmay not get along with jack may hit it\noff really well with diane\nis always on time different flavor but\nthe function\nis going to be fulfilled and\nthat's kind of how relationships are\nwhether they're friends relationships\nromantic relationships professional\nrelationships we all bring our unique\nflavor to them\nand we're all totally replaceable as\nwell\nso again i think about that then i don't\nhave to worry also about\nlosing anyone in particular because that\nspecial relationship is inviolate in my\nheart and\nthe world is full of other people who\ncan fulfill a similar function\nso that's all i want to say today please\nlike and subscribe\nwe'll talk more in future episodes"
