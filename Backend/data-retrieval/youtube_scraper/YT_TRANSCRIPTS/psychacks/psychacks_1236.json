    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is setting\neffective boundaries this is like a\nfundamental skill\nwith respect to a clinical practice it's\nsomething i talk about with my clients\nall the time\nand there's definitely a right way and a\nwrong way or at least\nan effective and an ineffective way to\nset boundaries with other people\nin short the ineffective ways anything\nthat tries to control\nthe other person's behavior\ngenerally that just doesn't work if\nanything it can make the situation even\nworse through a phenomenon called\nreactants which is basically that no one\nlikes being told what to do\nand so sometimes we go ahead and do the\nopposite just\nto to assert and to remind ourselves the\nother person of our freedom and autonomy\nso trying to control other people's\nbehavior generally isn't it\nisn't effective and creates reactants so\ninstead\num effective boundary setting has to do\nwith\nelucidating the consequences of certain\nbehaviors\nnamely what are you going to do\nin response to a certain\naction a certain behavior\num it's kind of like saying the other\nperson\nyou can do whatever you want you can get\nangry and throw things\nyou can drink until you're in a stupor\nevery night\nyou can go off and philander and break\nour\nyou know exclusivity agreement you can\ndo whatever you want\nbut if you continue to do that i'm going\nto tell you what the consequence for\nthat action will be\nwhich is fundamentally that i'm going to\ntake myself out of that situation\nnow of course you can't say that unless\nyou're actually willing to follow\nthrough with that consequence\nyou don't want to set\nreinforcements that you're not able or\nwilling to follow through on\nbut it's like if you you're free to do\nwhatever you want but if you do that\nthis is what i'm going to do because i'm\nalso free to do whatever i want and i\ndon't want to stay in a relationship\nthat's\nthat's mistrustful or that is\ninebriated or is abusive in some way or\njust disrespectful\nis i'm going to take myself out of the\nsituation and effectively ask the other\nperson to choose between you know\nthe problematic behavior from your point\nof view and\nthe relationship that that person has\nwith you\num and if that person\ncontinues that behavior then you\nexecute the the consequence that you had\ndiscussed with that person previously\nand that's boundary setting it's not\nthat the person\nwon't read\num that it's not like that other person\nmight not ever do that problematic\nbehavior again\nit's that you are no longer going to\nenable or tolerate a behavior that's\nunacceptable to you\nin a relationship anymore and i think\nit's really important to come across\nboundaries from this perspective because\nit's empowering to the individual\nsetting them\nif it's about controlling the other\nperson's behavior well that's something\nthat's ultimately not in your power to\nto do so whereas you\nyou have control over whether you\ncontinue to participate in a\nrelationship or not\nwhether you physically take yourself out\nof a situation or not the vast majority\nof the time\nso it it seats the power back\ninside of a person's domain of control\nso that's what i have to say on that\nsubject please like and subscribe we'll\ntalk more in future episodes"
