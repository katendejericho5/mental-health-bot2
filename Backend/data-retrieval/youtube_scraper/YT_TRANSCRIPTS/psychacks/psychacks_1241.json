    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology the\nsubject of today's\nshort video is cut the main line\nso what does that mean that means that\nin general if you're looking to change\nyour behavior in some way i want to\nstart doing this\ni want to stop doing that\nit's generally preferable that rather\nthan try to find\neight nine ten new good things that\nyou could be doing to further your\ngrowth\nthat you really examine your behavior\nand you stop doing the one or two things\nthat are\nreally holding you back you'll make\nmuch faster more significant\nprogress this way than trying to build a\nmultitude of positive habits\nthat might ultimately be counteracted by\nthe\nthe perseverance of the negative things\nthat are sabotaging your progress\nlike one of the things that i i am\napproached\nfrequently about from with clients has\nto do with anxiety\nand sometimes these folks want to learn\na whole bunch of new behaviors to deal\nwith their anxiety they want to learn\nabout mindfulness and they want to learn\nabout cognitive restructuring and they\nwant to do exposure therapy and it's\nlike okay\nbut then it comes out that they're like\nyou know\ntwo bottles of wine every night which\nwhen they recover from it in the morning\nsends their sympathetic nervous system\ninto overdrive because alcohol is a\nneurodepressant\nwhich creates the somatic experience of\nanxiety so\nlike they're putting liquid anxiety into\ntheir bodies\nevery single day and rather than examine\nthat behavior that's that's really\nputting fuel on the fire of their\nanxiety\nthey want to on some level keep doing\nthat but\nto to practice these other behaviors\nwhich at best are going to be band-aid\nsolutions\nin sort of dealing with or lessening the\nimpact of the symptoms\nof what might be the the main line\nbehavior issue which in this case in\nthis identical example would be the\nalcohol abuse so um\nand you don't really need a therapist to\ntell you these things to be honest it's\nlike\nif we really are truthful with\nthemselves\nthe vast majority of us know we know in\nour heart of hearts\nthe one or two things that are really\ngetting in our way\nand sometimes we bend over backwards and\ntwist our minds and our bodies and our\nlives into all kinds of\nunnatural shapes in order to avoid the\nsimplicity of that\nof that state of affairs which is that\nthey're we generally know\nthe one or two things that are really\nsubject to tripping us\nup so rather than try to kind of\naccommodate\nthose the existence of those things in\nour lives by kind of\ncreating more behaviors that that make\nit easier to live with those things\nattack those behaviors directly they can\nbe the target of behavioral change just\nas much as\nthese other more positive behaviors not\nthat those things don't have a place\nbut they generally come a little bit\nlater to make a\nhabit a bit more ingrained\nso better to cut the main line of the\nproblem first\nso please like and subscribe we'll talk\nmore in future episodes thank you"
