    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nhow to make better\ndecisions okay so when i talk about this\nsubject with my clients i usually\nusually use the metaphor of the\ncrossroads so you know what a crossroads\nis\npast diverging out in different\ndirections\nwe know that we're at a crossroads in\nour day-to-day lives\nwhen there's some sort of somatic\nexperience that lets us know oh this is\na\ncrisis point this is a choice point\nwhere the decision that we're about to\nmake\nactually has important emotional\nconsequences for ourselves\nand it's it's somatic for me it means\nthat my heart starts to race a little\nbit\nand maybe i have a queasy feeling in my\ngut\nand those are signals i've learned that\nthe next thing i'm about to do is\nactually an important decision that i'm\nmaking now\nin that moment most likely i know\nwhat i feel like doing it's my default\naction it's what i've done hundreds if\nnot thousands of times\ni'm nervous in a social interaction so\ni'm gonna get out i have a craving to\nuse so i'm gonna\nsmoke etc i know\nwhat that emotion that somatic\nexperience\nprompts me to do and i also know where\nthat\nroad at the crossroads leads it\npredictably leads\nto me feeling ashamed to leave being\naddicted\nto me suffering some sort of negative\noutcome\nand to really understand and appreciate\nthat roads only go where they go\nit's impossible for a road to go\nanywhere other than where it goes\ni can't go down that road and expect\nthat it's going to lead anywhere else\nand i've gone down that road tens of\nthousands of times do i really need to\ngo down that road\nten thousand and one i know every house\non that road i don't have a brick in the\nwall on that road there are many other\nroads in the world i'm gonna go down\nsome of these other ones\nanyway how to make better decisions is\nto use that somatic experience to\nunderstand\noh i'm about to make a decision with\nconsequence\nand to feel the emotional impulse to\nmove in the default direction\nand to exercise the intentional courage\nto move in a different desired direction\nin that case it's generally a good idea\nto have the replacement\nbehavior already kind of\non deck in your mind what i'm going to\ndo instead\nof smoking what i'm going to do instead\nof seeking reassurance what i'm going to\ndo instead\nof overeating what i'm going to do\ninstead of cutting or whatever your\nyour problem is and it's going to\nfeel really really weird because it's\ngoing against\nevery emotional cell in your body in\nthat moment\nbut this actually is a decision with\nconsequence\narnold schwarzenegger once said in a i\nthink a commencement speech\nthat he only starts counting his sit-ups\nwhen it starts to hurt\nbecause only when it starts to hurt that\nhe's actually building a muscle and\nmaking progress up until the pain starts\nit's just preamble if he's if he were to\nstop\nbefore the pain started he wouldn't be\nmaking any real progress\nso this thematic experience that lets us\nknow around the crossroads\nillustrates that we're actually at a\nposition where if we make a decision now\nif we keep going\nit will make a difference it will\nactually build a muscle and create a\ndifferent outcome for us\nso that's what i have to say on the\nmatter uh please like and subscribe\nwe'll talk more bye"
