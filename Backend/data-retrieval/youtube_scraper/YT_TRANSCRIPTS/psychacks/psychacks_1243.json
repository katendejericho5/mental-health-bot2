    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis don't eat crumbs from your own\ntable so this is something that i say\noften\nto my clients particularly with respect\nto their professional difficulties\nlook we we commonly say that there's 24\nhours in a day\nand there's seven days a week and i'm\nyou know on one hand obviously that's\ntechnically true but on a more practical\nlevel\nit's not true we don't have 24 hours a\nday we have at most 16 hours a day\nbecause generally we're getting about\nyou know seven or eight hours of sleep\nand again let's be honest in that 16\nhours of wakefulness\nthere's those hours are not equal with\nrespect to how\nenergetic and focused and productive we\ntend to be\ni think that there's a golden period\nevery day that lasts around five or six\nhours for some people it's first thing\nin the morning for some people it's\nit's in the early afternoon but there's\ngenerally about\nlet's say four to six hours every day of\ngolden time\nwhen you're going to be focused when\nyou're going to be productive\nwhen you're going to be at your most\nsensitive\nin the sense of like perceptive and\nengaged\nand that's really where you're at your\npeak\nmental and emotional functioning any\ngiven day\nso let's say you really only have four\nto six\nhigh quality high value hours every day\nokay who are you giving that time to\nwhat are you doing during those four to\nsix hours if you're like the vast\nmajority of humanity you're giving them\nto your job\nyou're giving them to your employer and\ni know that\nyou know likely you're going to be\ncompensated for that but\ni wonder if you're getting a fair trade\nout of that\nit's like generally what happens is\npeople give the best hours of their day\nfor the best years of their lives to\nsomebody else\nand what they have left is maybe they\nhave an hour after dinner\nmaybe they are weekend warriors and they\nsqueeze in a little trip or an afternoon\ngetaway\nthey eat crumbs from their own table\nthey content themselves\nwith what's left over after they give\nthe best of their time to someone else\nand the issue with that is generally\ni mean what happens at the end of the\nday when you have time for yourself\nyou're generally so exhausted um\nso fuzzy with your focus that you don't\nreally have a lot of energy\nto to be engaging to be productive to be\ncreative to be outgoing\nand so a lot of people just plop down in\nfront of the screen\nbecause that's kind of what they have\nthe energy for\nand that creates kind of a cycle because\nwhen they do that they often start to\njudge themselves it's like oh what am i\ndoing with my life i'm just sitting in\nfront of netflix i'm watching more\nyoutube videos\nplaying more video games whatever it\nseems to be when really they're just\ntired because they're giving the best\nhours of their life\nto other people so i strongly\ncounsel you who are watching this video\nto examine you know whether you're\ngetting a fair trade for those\nthose hours um and to potentially\nto consider putting yourself first\nthat's all i have to say please like and\nsubscribe we'll talk more in future\nepisodes bye"
