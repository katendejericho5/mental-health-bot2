    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short discussion\nis progress demands\nextraordinary effort extraordinary\neffort ordinary effort\ndoesn't contribute to progress this is\njust sort of in the fabric of reality\nthis the chips are kind of stacked\nagainst us you can see this\nif you just look at things on a purely\nphysical plane is that\nentropy increases within closed systems\nas a function of time which basically\ndisorder\nmounts if you don't clean your house it\nwill eventually become dusty\ndisorganized and it will deteriorate\nover time\nif you don't attend to your physical\nhealth\nit will degrade and decompensate\nover time if we do\nnothing things get worse if we do\nnothing things get worse\nand on some level i think this is\nwas kind of woven into the fact the\nfabric of reality so\nit gives us the necessity to to have\nsomething to do\nbecause if we do nothing we suffer and\nthe pain accumulates\nbut here's the thing if we just do um\nwhat we need to if we just make an\nordinary effort that's sufficient for\nmaintenance that's sufficient to prevent\ndecay that doesn't mean progress\nyou have to work just to maintain the\nstatus quo\nokay so if you're just putting in an\nordinary amount of effort\nyou certainly can't reasonably expect\nthat you're going to see\nmuch if any significant progress in your\nlife\nbecause that ordinary effort is going\ntowards the maintenance of the status\nquo\nto undo the entropy of decay associated\nwith the fabric of reality\nokay so if we want to actually\nmove beyond what we currently have we\nhave to go beyond the effort\nneeded for maintenance and that's also\npainful\nso the the gates on either side of the\nstatus quo are pain\nif we do nothing and our status quo\ndecompensates\nthat's painful if we want to make an\nextraordinary effort\nand and make progress in a certain\ndomain of our life\nthat's also associated with pain the\npain of growth\ni mean you can think about it from a\npurely physical perspective to build a\nmuscle\nit's painful why because you're actually\nkind of like tearing on a microscopic\nlevel the muscle\nso that it will the body will build it\nback stronger\nso that's that's what muscle fatigue is\nit's the sensation\nof muscles being being strained and\ndamaged\nso that the body will build them back\nstronger\nso if you want to make ex progress in\nyour life\nthen be prepared to make a an\nextraordinary effort\nand extraordinary is defined by what\nyour ordinary\nis if your ordinary is\nyou know it's down here extraordinary is\nup here if your name is up here\nextraordinary is up here so you set like\na homeostatic\nthermometer what your baseline ordinary\nis and if you want to\nimprove from there you're going to have\nto put in more effort\nthan is associated with pure maintenance\nso thank you for listening\nplease like and subscribe and we'll talk\nmore in future episodes"
