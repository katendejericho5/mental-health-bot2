    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology the\nsubject of today's short\nvideo is let people be wrong\nthis is something that\ni think that we can all use a reminder\nof from time to time\nfor the vast majority of people one of\nthe most painful\nexperiences is this feeling that we're\nin the wrong\nand that's actually what motivates a lot\nof unnecessary conflict in the world\nboth you know kind of an interpersonal\nscale and also on the global scale\nwhich is this need to prove that i'm not\nwrong in fact i'm right\nand potentially you're wrong\ni'm not wrong you are i'm right you're\nwrong okay\nso this is interesting because\nit on the other hand rather than engage\nin what is\noften a fruitless debate that\nvery completely can escalate to just\nall-out conflict and aggression\nis that there's very little downside to\nletting people be wrong\nthere's there's really two potential\noutcomes\nnow if one is that you let somebody be\nwrong\nand they are for lack of a better word\nobjectively\nwrong like they're they're shown by the\nconsequences\nof their actions through the rest of\nreality the rest of life\nthat they're wrong that they suffer that\nthey they experience\nfailure that they experience rejection\num\nin which case great you are vindicated\nnot by the force of your dialogue but\nbecause of the outcome of reality\num and we also know the experience\nof being wrong it's it's painful which\nis why we're often motivated to argue\nand prove that we're right\nso on some level what what worse\npunishment can you inflict on somebody\nthan\ntheir own wrongness it's it's the\nexperience\nthe state that we often try to squirm as\nmuch as we can to avoid\nin dealing with other people so what let\npeople be wrong\nand the other hand the other possible\noutcome is that um you were wrong about\ntheir being wrong that\nthey went ahead with their lives and um\nthey seem to be successful um they seem\nto be prosperous there doesn't seem to\nbe any problems\nand in this case good for you too\nbecause you've been spared sort of the\nshame and\nignominy of kind of betting on the wrong\npony as it were\nand you can potentially examine your own\nbeliefs\nto see how it could be that um your\nexpectations didn't align with what\nactually ended up occurring so by\nletting people be wrong\nyou want to avoid the pain of backing\nthe wrong horse as it were\nand two if you're right you're\nultimately vindicated in your\nperspective anyway\nso you know let people be wrong if\nthey're wrong um\nnothing that you can say to a person is\nreally going to dissuade them from their\nwrongness only the experience of their\nown pain frustration and failure\nwill cause them potentially to examine\nthe beliefs that brought them to that\npoint\nso please like and subscribe we'll talk\nmore about these subjects in future\nepisodes thank you"
