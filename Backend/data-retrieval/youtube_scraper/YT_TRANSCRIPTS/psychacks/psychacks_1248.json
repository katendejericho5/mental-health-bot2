    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology so\ntoday in the short video we'll be\ndiscussing\num believe it\nto see it believe it to see it\nso we have in english this idiom that\nuh you got to see it to believe it or\ni'll believe it when i see it\nwhich basically means that something is\nsort of incredulous and i i want proof\nthat it exists before\ni kind of uh admit the possibility of\nits existence\nwhich is belief and people who\nwho demand this level of\nlet's say certainty before they're\nwilling to believe in the possibility of\nexistence of something\nthey they generally don't\nthey don't expand their conception of\nthe world\nvery readily the fact of the matter is\nis that in general on the contrary we\nhave to believe something first\nwe have to believe it in order to see it\nthere's there's a couple of reasons for\nthat one\nis that if we don't believe that\nsomething even exists\nwhy would we go looking for it that\ndoesn't make\nany sense whatsoever if you don't\nbelieve that\nbigfoot exists for instance you're not\ngoing to go\nsearching for evidence one way or the\nother that's something of a frivolous\nexample but if you don't believe that\nlet's say there are any good women in\nyour area\nyou're not going to go looking for them\nor you don't believe that\nyou can find a faithful committed man\nyou're not going to go looking for them\nand the mind is a hunter what it\nsearches for\nit finds which means that we have to be\nvery careful about what we go looking\nfor because we tend to find it one way\nor the other\nwe have to believe it in order to see it\nand this is because\nsite generally become it begins\nwith an internal vision we have to know\nwhat we're looking for\nin order to be able to find it finding\nis really recognition\nyou know if i'm looking for my my\nglasses\nit's because i have a conceptualization\nof what they are and then when i find\nthem on the table i recognize them and i\nmotivates me to stop looking it's like\naha there they are which means on some\nlevel i had to believe that the glasses\nexisted\nand i had to believe that i could find\nthem in order to go looking for them\nand then of course i needed to have some\nvision about\nsome understanding of what those glasses\nlook like to be able to recognize them\nwhen i found them that's the other thing\nis sometimes people\npeople come across things but they don't\nrecognize\nthat this is actually what they were\nlooking for and so they just keep\nsearching which is\nsomewhat tragic so we have to believe\nbefore we see it because the believing\nallows us to see it it creates the\ncapacity to\nrecognize that which we encounter as\nthat which we might be searching for\nwithout that belief ships in the night\nwe can\npass right by without any kind of\nawareness whatsoever\nso we'll talk more about this in future\nepisodes please like and subscribe for\nnow\nso long"
