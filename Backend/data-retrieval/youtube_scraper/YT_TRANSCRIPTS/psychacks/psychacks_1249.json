    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology so the\ntopic of today's short discussion\nis on the inevitability of pain\nso uh you know we live in this\nbiological organism\nwe are attracted to pleasure we have\nthis\nnatural aversion to pain and\nthe consequence of that is sometimes we\ncan find ourselves\nat a crossroads in our life where we're\nsort of peering down the different paths\nto determine okay which one is likely\ngoing to get me the most pleasure for\nthe least amount of pain what i call the\nhedonic calculus\num you know that's all well and good to\na certain point\nbut sometimes we fall into this trap of\nprioritizing\nthe avoidance of pain and it's actually\na psychological\ntruth that people are much\nmore likely to to work to avoid pain\nthan they are to secure pleasure so in\nour in our calculus it's not like a\none-to-one it's like\none ounce of pain isn't worth one ounce\nof pleasure in our minds\nso we're generally more pain averse than\na pleasure attracted\nokay so the idea here is that sometimes\nwe can try to avoid\npain by kind of any means necessary\nand the fact of the matter is is that\npain is inevitable so what does this\nmean this means that\nif you go if you don't change that's\npainful\nif you change it's painful if you go\nleft it's painful if you go right it's\npainful\nif you if you move forward with a\ncommitted relationship and get married\nand start a family it's painful\nif you stay single and secure your\nfreedom\nit's painful no matter what you do there\nwill be pain\nso what i often counsel my clients is to\nreally deeply accept and embrace the\ninevitability of pain\nand rather than let the\nthe avoidance of pain be the guiding\nfactor\nin our decisions at the crossroads of\nlife rather to say\nto ourselves in essence okay no matter\nwhat i'm going to\nfeel in pain there's going to be pain\nassociated with whatever choice i make\nso rather than so it doesn't really\nenter\nor shouldn't really enter into the\ncalculus of our decision making because\nit's common to every alternative uh\nwe have to examine how our the\nalternatives are different\nnot how they're the same and how all the\nalternate alternatives are the same is\nthat there's pain involved\nso we accept that pain is inevitable and\nrather than let that be our guiding star\nwe think okay\nwhich path is the pain\nworth it in which path do i\nat least go where i want to go at\nwhich point is the cost of my suffering\nin some way recompensed\nby the benefit or the growth that i\nreceive as a result of that decision\nwhen you start to think this way and you\non some level you begin to minimize or\neven kind of\nignore or accept the inevitability of\npain you make decisions that are\nactually more in line with your\nyour best interests your goals your\nvision in life\nand your long-term growth so thanks for\nlistening\nplease like and surprise like and\nsubscribe and we'll talk more in future\nepisodes"
