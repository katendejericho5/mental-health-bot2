    "transcript": "my dude's Fame is not like wealth or ABS\nor status and that's because those\nthings aren't always visible and obvious\nFame is like being hot regardless of how\nphysically attractive you actually are\nbecause like hotness Fame is highly\nvisible and immediately apparent and let\nme tell you women respond to fame the\nsame way men respond to hotness and this\nis why I have advised you guys many\ntimes to find ways to become visibly\ncompetent the kind of attention you\nreceive as a man by being visibly\ncompetent is a force multiplier in the\nsexual Marketplace like you might even\nbe disgusted by how easy things become\nbecause potentially nothing else about\nyou has changed except for the fact that\nmore people now know that you exist"
