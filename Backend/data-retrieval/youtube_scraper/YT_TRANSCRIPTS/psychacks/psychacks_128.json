    "transcript": "most women are kind of lowgrade famous\nin the sense that they receive treatment\ncomparable to someone with a few hundred\nth000 followers on social media like\njust for breathing and I can only\nimagine what it would be like if people\nwere coming out of the Woodworks to pay\nme compliments and offer me gifts from a\nvery young age like what a distorted\nview of my own selfworth would I likely\nhave of course those gifts often come\nwith strings attached as I admitted\nthey're designed to functionally lure a\nwoman into a seual relationship however\nthat would have to be mystified those\nstrings would have to stay very well\nhidden because if I believe that I was\nentitled to those gifts just by like\nbeing a good person I would absolutely\nbe insulted by any insinuation of an\nulterior motive or any expectation of\nreciprocity on the other hand as a man\nI've kind of had to earn any good\ntreatment that I've received generally\nby providing value to others and in this\ncase by providing value to a lot of\nother people so it's not something that\nI take for granted"
