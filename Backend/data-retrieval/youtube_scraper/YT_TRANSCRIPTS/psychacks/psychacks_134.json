    "transcript": "Tinder first came out in Japan I gave it\na shot and I was using it for a little\nwhile and then I came across this one\nwoman's profile and she said I'm just\nhere to see how many people think I'm\nhot actually I think guys who use dating\napps are just losers who can't do pickup\nand I was like wow okay wow I mean there\nis some evidence to back that up uh I\nthink the most common reason women use\ndating apps's boredom it's not out of an\ninterest to actually meet another human\nbeing in real life it's something that\ngives them a little hit of dopamine and\nvalidation because they know that\nsomebody out there likes them and that\nalso makes it harder for them to settle\nfor any present actual opportunity\nbecause like there's no urgency I don't\nhave to get into a relationship now I\ncan wait until I find someone\npotentially even better because look\nthere are 500 men who think that I'm\nattractive so like there's no hurry I\ncan exercise that optionality whenever I\nlike"
