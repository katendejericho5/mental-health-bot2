    "transcript": "I made a video about this a long time\nago every time you say the word and the\nlikelihood that you get what you want\ndecreases significantly so and is\nexpensive I mean just think about it\nlike this if you're only attracted to\none out of 10 people and you think that\none out of 20 people are intelligent if\nyou want someone who's attractive and\nintelligent that means one out of 200\npeople and what's the likelihood that\nthat person is single available and also\ninterested in you so if you just say and\na few times even if you are in a major\nMetropolitan Center like New York there\nmight only be on the average of like\n10,000 to 20,000 people who meet all of\nthose criteria and a lot of them will be\nspoken for and a lot of them won't be\ninterested in you so you say and five\ntimes you're functionally looking for a\nneedle and a Hy stack in the middle of a\nCity full of people that you could have\notherwise satisfying relationships with\nbut that's the nature of things is that\nno one really wants to settle even\nthough all relationships require some\ndegree of settling right"
