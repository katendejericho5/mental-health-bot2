    "transcript": "what about schizophrenia H everyone\nknows that that is the exception it's\nthe gold standard for the biological\nbasis of mental illness Associated\nlaboratory findings no laboratory\nfindings have been identified that are\ndiagnostic of schizophrenia so I'm not\ngoing to bore you by going through the\nother 297 disorders they're all more or\nless the same so are you saying that\nthese are fake problems Orion are you\nsaying that people are just making this\nup and lying about their suffering no\nI'm not while malingerers exist I\nbelieve the vast majority of people are\naccurately reporting their subjective\nexperience and that they are actually\nsuffering however I also believe that a\nlot of this suffering is unnecessary\nwhich is one way to approach Neurosis\nlike my personal definition of neurosis\nis making a fake problem into a real\nproblem which then absolutely becomes a\nreal problem for instance worrying about\nthe straightness of your picture frames\na fake problem while your house is on\nfire a real problem is actually a real\nproblem both for the worrier and for the\npeople around him"
