    "transcript": "I think it's safe to say that you bring\na lot of hard truths to men a lot of\nthings about female psychology that they\ndon't realize and maybe they should have\nrealized a long time ago and it would\nhave been a lot more helpful if they did\nrealize so what what I'm angling at is\nso for example when I was in high school\nI took a lot of my dating advice from\nHollywood movies sure me too so I\nthought oh I should be you know kind of\nlike pathetic but romantic and just just\noh you know I don't really have a spine\nbut I just love you so much and and\nyou'll love me too now that I love you\nyeah it turns out that showing up\nunannounced underneath a woman's window\nlate at night actually isn't romantic\nit's it gets the police call on you"
