    "transcript": "this is the diagnostic and statistical\nManual of mental disorders published by\nthe American Psychiatric association now\nin its fifth edition it contains nearly\n300 different illnesses but here's the\nthing none of these nearly 300 mental\nillnesses can be objectively assessed\nfor all of these illnesses diagnosis is\nprimarily based on self-reported\ncriteria checklists of symptoms this\nmeans that you could book a session with\na doctor say you've had five of these\neight symptoms over the past month which\nhas caused you a lot of distress and\nboom you now have a mental illness can\nyou imagine a medical system in which\nthe patient tells the doctor that he has\nstrep throat or pancreatic cancer or\nbrain aneurysm and that the doctor has\nno way to objectively confirm that\nassessment and of course if there were\nno way to objectively confirm the\npresence of these diseases then there\nwould also be no way to objectively\nconfirm whether the diseases ever went\naway"
