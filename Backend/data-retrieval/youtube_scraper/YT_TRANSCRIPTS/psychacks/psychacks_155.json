    "transcript": "women generally treat men the way men\ntreat jobs which is on some level they\nare going to enter into a relationship\nwith their perceived best option and\nthat's a tricky thing because what\nconstitutes a person's perceived best\noption changes from Individual to\nindividual and across time like for\nexample some people at one stage of\ntheir career might just prioritize\nearning potential like that's the most\nimportant thing they don't care if they\nhave to work long hours they don't have\nthey don't care if they have to commute\nthey don't care if they don't have a lot\nof influence in the company they just\nwant to make bank but that might change\nlater on in life maybe they have\nchildren they want more flexibility they\nwant to make work fewer hours so the\noverall best option for employment\nchanges over the course of a career same\nthing for a relationship that also is\npart of the reason why it's so hard to\nstay together in the long term is\nbecause people's individual goals shift\nsignificantly over the course of their\nrelationships and it's hard for one\nperson to evolve in tandem with that set\nof Shifting priorities"
