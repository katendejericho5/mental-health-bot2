    "transcript": "too often we collectively mistake the\naesthetic sensibility for Spiritual\ntruth like God does not just live in the\nbeautiful cathedrals no matter how\nprofound your experience there might be\nif that's the only place that you can\nexperience Transcendence then your\nspirituality is still relatively Barren\nbecause how much of your life are you\nreally going to spend in a cathedral but\nrelative to the possibility of total\nnon-existence then all of the created\nuniverse is a cathedral and the beauty\nof that creation shines through when we\nget out of the way of our own cognitive\nprojections more on this in a future\nepisode through this lens a strip mall a\ntrailer park or a fast food restaurant\nis just as Divine and beautiful as a\nforest or a cathedral I know that sounds\ncrazy but it's kind of true which to my\nmind is actually one of the lessons of\nthe Christmas story as a Manger was kind\nof the 2,000 year old equivalent of some\nof these places a humble place of no\nparticular beauty or Merit"
