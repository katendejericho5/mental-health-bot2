    "transcript": "it was a miracle when Jesus walked on\nwater because given our understanding of\nbuoyancy that just shouldn't have been\npossible these events are considered\nmiraculous primarily because basis of\ncomparison is our understanding of the\nlaws of physics however if the basis of\ncomparison is say the nothingness of the\ninfinite void then everything becomes\nmiraculous relative to the nothingness\nof no time no space and no matter\neverything in the observable universe is\nmiraculous water flowing downhill is\njust as miraculous as water flowing\nuphill because on what basis can we\nreasonably assume the existence of water\nhills and flow frankly the direction of\nthat flow is probably the least\nmiraculous aspect of the whole shebang\nfrom this perspective it doesn't really\nmatter what we're talking about a tree a\ncloud a broken shoe everything is\nmiraculous and everything is beautiful\nit's an amazing way to go through life\nit's also an overwhelming way to go\nthrough life but it gets easier to\nnavigate with practice"
