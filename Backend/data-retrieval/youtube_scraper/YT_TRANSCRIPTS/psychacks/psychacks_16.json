    "transcript": "I can understand why women are insulted\nwhen men just proposition them for sex\nfrom a woman's perspective such men are\ntrying to get value for nothing however\nwomen demanding a significant\nrelationship upfront is even more\nludicrous as male commitment is far more\nexpensive than female sexual opportunity\nin today's dating Market from Men's\nperspective such women are trying to get\na lot of value for nothing so what's the\nupshot because of the differences in\ntheir subjective experiences while using\ndating app and because of the\ndifferences in their gendered incentives\nto engage in the sexual Marketplace what\nends up happening is that men and women\nare growing increasingly Divergent in\ntheir valuations of sex and commitment\nmen think sex should cost this much\nwomen think sex should cost this much\nand they're both right at least within\ntheir respective subjectivities but\nhere's the thing when people get too far\naway from each other in terms of\nvaluation they can't do business with\neach other"
