    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the gift\nof nothingness so I'd like to begin this\nepisode by relating an experience from\nmy own past that radically transformed\nmy relationship to life and reality\nitself six or seven years ago I decided\nto spend several weeks backpacking by\nmyself in the mountains now I'm not\nexactly sure how I arrived there but one\nday while I was meditating\nI came to a place that was so peaceful\nand so still that I lost all sense of\nmyself my Consciousness was completely\nempty of content so there was no longer\neven the sense of the Consciousness\nbeing mine it was more like the field of\nConsciousness was wholly empty and I\npassed out of all sense of space and\ntime there was no sensation no memory no\nsubjectivity only nothingness\nthe no thingness of the infinite void\nnow I have no idea how long I persisted\nin that state however the transition out\nof that experience from the\nundifferentiated experience of the\nTimeless spaceless void to the normal\neveryday perception of reality felt like\nthe big bang it felt no less staggering\nand baffling and intense than the\neruption of the entire created Universe\nwhich could be why the Buddha spoke on\nhow everything in the universe is\ncreated by our own minds or to put it\nanother way on how mind precedes all\nphenomena on some level that is\ncertainly correct like you've never\nexperienced anything outside of your own\nConsciousness like you're not even\nlistening to me right now you're\nlistening to an emergent perception\nwithin your own mind inside your own\nConsciousness the observable universe\nrequires an observer and without that\nObserver the observable universe on some\nlevel doesn't exist in any case this\nexperience turned out to be a kind of\nturning point in my life as it radically\nand permanently altered my relationship\nto reality among other things it helped\nme approach the miraculousness of\neveryday life when people use the word\nmiracle they typically reserve it for\ncertain behaviors or events that just\nshouldn't be possible within our\nunderstanding the laws of physics like\nit was a miracle when Jesus walked on\nwater because given our understanding of\nthat just shouldn't have been\npossible these events are considered\nmiraculous primarily because the basis\nof comparison is our understanding of\nthe laws of physics which are themselves\nderived from careful observation of the\nobservable universe however if the basis\nof comparison is say the nothingness of\nthe infinite void then everything\nbecomes\nmiraculous there is nothing in\nnothingness that suggests that anything\nshould be possible even our modern\ncosmological explanations of creation\nhave to posit the existence of like\nPhantom particles that is they have to\nassume the existence of something to\nmake sense of everything else to go from\nnothing to something anything is an\nincomprehensible leap because under what\nframework can we reasonably assume that\nsomething can come from\nnothing Rel to the nothingness of no\ntime no space and no matter everything\nin the observable universe is miraculous\nwater flowing downhill is just as\nmiraculous as water flowing uphill\nbecause on what basis can we reasonably\nassume the existence of water hills and\nflow frankly the direction of that flow\nis probably the least miraculous aspect\nof the whole shebang from this\nperspective it doesn't really matter\nwhat we're talking about a tree a cloud\na broken shoe everything is miraculous\nand everything is beautiful it's an\namazing way to go through life it's also\nan overwhelming way to go through life\nbut it gets easier to navigate with\npractice in any case this event\nsignificantly deepened my relationship\nwith reality and it did so because it\nwasn't an intellectual concept from the\nwisdom literature that I could kind of\ntrick myself into thinking I understood\nbut an embodied and irrefutable felt\nexperience now before I go any further\nif you're liking what you're hearing\nplease consider sending this episode to\nsomeone who might benefit from its\nmessage because it's Word of Mouth\nreferrals like this that really help to\nmake the channel grow I'm also proud to\nannounce that I'll soon be publishing my\nbook the value of others so if you'd\nlike to learn more about this then you\ncan go to my website and sign up for my\nWeekly Newsletter finally please fill\nout an inquiry form on my website if\nyou're interested in booking a paid\nconsult\nthe link is in the\ndescription okay let's get back to it\nand I think the felt\nexperience is important because too\noften we collectively mistake the\naesthetic sensibility for Spiritual\ntruth like God does not just live in the\nbeautiful cathedrals no matter how\nprofound your experience there might be\nif that's the only place that you can\nexperience Transcendence then your\nspirituality is still relatively Barren\nbecause how much of your life are you\nreally going to spend in a\ncathedral but relative to the\npossibility of total\nnon-existence then all of the created\nuniverse is a cathedral and the beauty\nof that creation shines through when we\nget out of the way of our own cognitive\nprojections more on this in a future\nepisode through this lens a strip mall a\ntrailer park or a fast food restaurant\nis just as Divine and\nbeautiful as a forest or a cathedral I\nknow that sounds crazy but it's kind of\ntrue which to my mind is actually one of\nthe lessons of the Christmas story as a\nManger was kind of the 2,000-year old\nequivalent of some of these places a\nhumble place of no particular beauty or\nMerit now there does seem to be a\nrelationship between Beauty and Truth at\nleast at the very highest levels however\nif you expect all truth to be beautiful\nor all Beauty to be true then you're in\nfor quite a ride down here my friend\nthose two things are fairly different\nfrom each other and I think we too often\nmake the mistake of imbuing Beauty with\na de facto truth that I don't believe is\nJustified in any case when you arrive at\na place where you are able to contrast\nthe objects of your perception not with\nyour understanding of causality and the\nlaws of physics but with the infinite\nvoid of nothingness\nthen all of creation becomes bright and\nshining and miraculous you will also\nnever feel alone again but that could\nalso be the topic of another\nepisode now I wish I could tell you how\nI arrived at that place exactly but I\ncan't tell you the path this is because\nroads only go where they go and where I\nwent there were no roads perhaps that's\nthe gateless gate alluded to in Zen\nparables I can tell you that I have at\nleast 10,000 hours of meditation\nexperience over the course of my life so\nthat probably has something to do with\nit however it's mysterious I know people\nwho are more experienced than I am who\nhaven't yet had a comparable experience\nand I've heard stories of people who are\nmuch less experienced than I am undergo\neven more dramatic Transformations like\nSaul Blinded By the Light on the road to\nDamascus the upshot is that if you think\nMiracles are just about non standard\nempirical phenomena then you're anchored\nat the wrong point the standard\nphenomena are just as miraculous as the\nnon-standard phenomenon and it speaks to\nthe pervasive and stultifying effects of\nconvention that so many of us seem to\nhave forgotten that this is so what do\nyou think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow as always I appreciate your\nsupport and thank you for listening
