    "transcript": "people don't always like limits but\nthere's really no way around them now\nthere are two really important ways in\nwhich the limitations inherent in an\nethical framework will help you out\nfirst this framework will help you not\nself-destruct once you become successful\nin many cases the limitations inherent\nin an ethical framework are less useful\nwhen you're not successful this is\nbecause the reality of your\ncircumstances already places limits on\nyour action there's kind of no need to\nuse an ethical principle to restrict\nBehavior if that behavior is already\nrestricted by scarcity it's one thing to\nmoralize about infidelity when nobody\nwants you for instance it's quite\nanother when hundreds of beautiful women\nare throwing themselves at you every day\nhowever it's important to consider how\nyou would want to live if you could\nactually do whatever you wanted and to\nstart practicing that way of life today"
