    "transcript": "it makes me sad to think how many people\nperceive the world in a way that is so\nlike unintentional so non- agentic\nthey're not a sovereign individual they\ndon't have control over their outcomes\nor their future it's unfortunate now\nthat is a difficult situation for one\nperson to get in the point at which it\nreally starts to rile me up is when\nthose people begin to try and convince\nother people that that's the case I'm\nlike yo you can be as despondent as you\nwant but it's there is nothing more\nperverse and toxic than trying to\nconvince other people that they're\nliving inside of the nightmare that you\nbelieve that you're already inside of\nwell it's their way of reducing their\nown cognitive dissonance I assume\nbecause the the presence of other people\nwho don't see that life is a nightmare\nwho are living their lives in an atic\nway and moving in the Direction with\nhopefulness and confidence towards their\ngoals is a palpable counter example\ncounter evidence counterfactual to their\nentire worldview"
