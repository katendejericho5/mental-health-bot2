    "transcript": "when people in a relationship have\nproblems with each other what is called\nfor is greater understanding like this\nis basically the Assumption upon which\ncoup's therapy is based that if only the\nother person were to understand why we\nwant what we want or why we do what we\ndo then the conflict and the\ndisagreements will stop however this\nalmost never works the way we think it\nwill here's a common example of this\nphenomenon a man might want more sex\nfrom his wife however the wife doesn't\nwant more sex from her husband instead\nshe wants him to understand that because\nof some difficult sexual experiences in\nher past or because of her shame based\nfamily of origin she can't read won't\ncomply with his request she believes the\nproblem is not the lack of sex but her\nhusband's failure to adequately\nunderstand why she doesn't want to have\nsex and if he did adequately understand\nher situation then the problem would go\naway presumably because he would stop\nwanting to have sex with her"
