    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the Trap\nof understanding so this is something\nthat often comes up in the context of\nintimate relationships the foundational\ncultural assumption here is that when\npeople in a relationship have problems\nwith each other what is called for is\ngreater understanding like this is\nbasically the Assumption upon which\ncouple's therapy is based that if only\nthe other person were to understand why\nwe want what we want or why we do what\nwe do then the conflict and the\ndisagreements will stop however this\nalmost never works the way we think it\nwill and in this episode I am going to\nexplain why here's a common example of\nthis phenomenon a man might want more\nsex from his wife however the wife\ndoesn't want more sex from her husband\ninstead she wants him to understand that\nbecause of some difficult sexual\nexperiences in her past or because of\nher shame-based family of origin or\nbecause of her work rated stress she\ncan't read won't comply with his request\nshe believes the problem is not the lack\nof sex but her husband's failure to\nadequately understand why she doesn't\nwant to have sex and if he did\nadequately understand her situation then\nthe problem would go away presumably\nbecause he would stop wanting to have\nsex with her and that's generally not\nwhat happens now understanding has its\nuses like understanding the reasons\nbehind another person's Behavior can\ncertainly help you to be more kind more\npatient and more compassionate with that\nperson when you can appreciate that any\nindividual's response to the present\nmoment is on some level rational and\ncomprehensible given an understanding of\nthis person's programming and experience\nthen you can treat people with more\ntolerance and forbear par if not more\nlove and care and that is no small thing\nhowever understanding does nothing to\nchange the need surrounding the behavior\nthat requires understanding like in the\nexample I just gave understanding why\nhis wife isn't interested in having sex\nisn't going to change the husband's\ndesire to have sex with his wife or to\ntake other examples understanding why\nsomeone say flies and to a rage or\ndoesn't follow through on commitments or\nbelittles others with sarcasm might\nallow us to feel some measure of\ncompassion for that person however that\nunderstanding does nothing to impact our\ndesire to say not be yelled at or not be\nleft hanging or not be\ndisrespected and this is the Trap of\nunderstanding those who beg for the\nunderstanding of others on some level\nare asking other people to change they\nare functionally asking other people to\naccommodate them which typically\nrequires special consideration and the\nrelinquishment of certain often\nlegitimate desires these people\nessentially communicate that I shouldn't\nhave to change I shouldn't have to heal\nor examine my programming or process my\nshame or experiment with new behaviors\nor courageously face my fears everyone\nelse\nshould have to change because I\ncan't the Trap of understanding is not\nonly a way of saying I'm not going to\nchange because I can't but it's a way of\nindirectly requesting that everyone else\naccept this self-diagnosed assessment as\nwell and the issue is that while some\nthings that people are subject to\ndealing with really can't be changed a\nlot of the things that people beg for\nunderstanding about can absolutely be\nchanged and asking others to change\nbefore taking every reasonable measure\nto First change\noneself is actually pretty\nselfish now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow I'm also proud to announce\nthat I'll soon be publishing my book the\nvalue of others so if you'd like to\nlearn more about that then you can go to\nmy website and sign up for my Weekly\nNewsletter finally please fill out an\ninquiry form on my website if you're\ninterested in booking a paid\nconsultation the link is in the\ndescription okay let's get back to\nit asking others to change is also\nfairly costly for example the husband in\nthe previous example might understand\nwhere his wife is coming from but he\nstill wants to have sex this makes the\nrelationship more expensive for him why\nbecause he now has to give more that is\nmore patience more tolerance more\ncompassion for Less\nin this case a sexless relationship not\na very attractive offer is it think of\nit this way imagine you're an employee\nin a company and you're looking to get a\nraise one day you go in to see your boss\nyou make your request and the boss\nresponds like this hey I totally get you\nbut here's what you need to understand\nwe've actually had a really tough year\nsales were down and we're already over\nbudget as much as I'd like to help you\nout there just isn't any money for a\nraise right now I I can't do it please\nunderstand and you will understand\nyou'll likely accept the explanation on\nface value and you probably won't push\nfor a raise anymore you may even offer\nsome words of sympathy or some helpful\nsuggestions and you may look for another\n job that pays you what you feel\nlike you deserve like understanding the\ncompany's problems does nothing to\nremove your goal do desire or need for\nmore money and this makes it\nsignificantly more likely that you're\ngoing to seek out another opportunity\nelsewhere this is because what your boss\nis functionally asking you to do is to\nwork at a discount like I understand\nthat you could potentially make more\nmoney elsewhere I get it but I'm asking\nyou to work for Less here because I'm\nhoping that you'll understand that we\ncan't give you more and that you'll\ntherefore make an allowance for me I'm\nhoping that you'll surrender your desire\nfor more money without noticing that I'm\nretaining my desire for you to continue\nto work under our current Arrangement\nlike it's certainly not in the employees\nlong-term best interest to satisfy\nhimself with understanding instead of\ncompensation now is it on some level\nasking to be understood is like asking\nfor a discount or an allowance or an\naccommodation all of which make the\nrelationship more expensive for the\nother person in many cases if you're\ninterested in keeping that relationship\nit's a better idea to change your own\nbehavior the fact of the matter is that\nwhen people are complicated or difficult\nor demanding they're harder to love now\nif you're not looking to be loved then\njust keep on keeping on however if you\nare looking to be loved then it makes\nsense to strive\nto be\nlovable and how do you do that if you're\ncomplicated then make yourself simple if\nyou're difficult then make yourself\neasygoing and if you're demanding then\nmake yourself adaptable it's possible to\nlove anyone however it's harder to love\ndifficult complicated and demanding\npeople and it's easier to Love Simple\neasygoing and adaptable people why\nbecause it's more expensive to love the\nchallenging people you have to pay more\nfor Less with these folks and is that\nsomething that you're very keen on doing\nprobably not right so it's probably fair\nto expect that no one else is very keen\non doing that for you either now I know\nthat make yourself simple is easy to say\nand hard to do but let me tell you\nstriving in this direction will not only\nimprove the quality of your\nrelationships it will significantly\nimprove the quality of your own life\nas well like it's hard to go through\nlife as a complicated person it's hard\nto go through life as a difficult person\nlike in your own subjectivity it does\nnot feel good to be that person most\ncomplicated difficult and demanding\npeople are not happy and contented\nindividuals so rather than working to\nget everyone around you to accommodate\nyour complicated difficult and demanding\nnature further entrenching it in your\nbehavioral repertoire TW it's a better\nidea to do what you can to work to\nsimplify your own complication to\nresolve your own difficulty and to\nassade your own demands this will not\nonly improve your own subjective\nexperience it will make it much easier\nfor people to love you and be close to\nyou do you understand what do you think\ndoes this fit with your own experience\nlet me know in the comments below as\nalways I appreciate your support and\nthank you for listening and now a word\nabout Stella\nif you're interested in
