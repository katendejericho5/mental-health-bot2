    "transcript": "and here's the most important part of\nall this it's the most important part\nbecause it's the part you women actually\ncontrol men get married when everything\nis working especially in the\nrelationship every problem that you\nunnecessarily introduce into the\nrelationship is a stumbling block that\nyou're throwing in your own path why\nbecause when a man is thinking of\ngetting married he's going to look at\nhis woman and think could I deal with\nthis this for the rest of my life that\nmeans if you're issuing demands and\nultimatums he's going to think am I\ngoing to have to deal with demands and\nultimatums for the rest of my life and\nyou know what I don't care who he is he\nis not going to want to deal with\ndemands and ultimatums for the rest of\nhis life so why the would he sign up for\nthat same thing with jealousy or\ncriticism or laziness or emotionality or\njudgmentalism or sexlessness or any of\nthe hundreds of things that women are\nsubject to Bringing to their\nrelationships"
