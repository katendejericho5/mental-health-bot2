    "transcript": "one of the best little psych hacks that\na person can have is to choose whatever\nhappens to them this was something that\nthe stoics talked about they delineated\neverything in terms of what was within\nmy locus of control and what was outside\nof the locus of control and the vast\nmajority of things are outside the locus\nof our control and the proper attitude\nto develop towards these things is\nindifference and to choose it like\nepicas talked about how if Zeus wants me\nto be sick then I want to be sick as\nwell I want what Fate has in store for\nme and by choosing it you take some\ndegree of psychological control over it\nand you can kind of wrestle with it you\nsay that there's something in here that\ncan better me there's something in here\nthat I want in almost like a masochistic\nway like I can take this I can struggle\nwith this and come out potentially\nreborn on the other side of it like\nthat's a indomitable mental set"
