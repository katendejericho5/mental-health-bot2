    "transcript": "on some level it's never been easier in\nthe history of the world to have direct\naccess to more potential mates than it\nis today you just switch on the magic\nrectangle you carry around in your\npocket and boom you instantly have\naccess to thousands of single and not so\nsingle people in your area ostensibly\nlooking for love in fact we've seen a\ndramatic uptick in the proportion of\ncouples who met online in the past\ndecade 10 years ago about 20% of\nAmerican couples met online now it's\naround 50% however across that same time\nperiod we've seen an equally dramatic\ndownturn in the frequency of all kinds\nof sexual relationships over the past\ndecade fewer people are getting married\nfewer people are getting into\nrelationships and surprisingly fewer\npeople are even hooking up some of these\nnumbers are at historically\nunprecedented lows so while it's only a\ncorrelative finding it's highly\nsuggestive the more people rely on\ndating apps for sexual relationships of\nall kinds the fewer sexual relationships\nare actually transacted"
