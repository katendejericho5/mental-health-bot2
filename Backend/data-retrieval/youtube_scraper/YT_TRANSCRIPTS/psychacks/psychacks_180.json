    "transcript": "While most people want the emotional\ncomponent of a relationship in my\nexperience it's more important for the\nwoman to have that than the man if a man\ninsists that he is going to put the\nwoman on the pedestal it robs her of the\nopportunity to be the adorer because two\npeople cannot like each other exactly\nthe same amount they can't occupy the\nsame place it's a recipe for disaster it\nis it also means if he's looking up at\nher that she's looking down at him and\nthat's not what women want no little\ngirl grow R up dreaming well one day I\nwant a guy that I can look down on right\nthey're looking for a prince they want\nto look up they want to feel small in\nhis arms women date and made hypergamous\nthey want men who are older more\nsuccessful more High status higher\nearning more intelligent more capable\nthan they are and why wouldn't they\nthat's to their benefit otherwise they\nhave a liability on their hands don't\nthey like that's not necessarily what\nmost women dream about"
