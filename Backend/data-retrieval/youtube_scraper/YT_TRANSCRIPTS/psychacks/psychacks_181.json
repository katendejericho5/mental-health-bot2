    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why men\nget married so this episode is for the\nladies so I've been doing a lot of\nconsultations with women these days and\nwhile my consultations with men tend to\nrun the gamet with respect to the topics\nunder consideration every single one of\nmy consultations with women has been on\none single topic namely how do I get\nmarried Orion and these conversations\nhave been very enlightening to say the\nleast make sure you listen all the way\nto the end one of the many things I've\nlearned is that a lot of you ladies\ndon't seem to appreciate that men don't\napproach the idea of marriage like you\ndo in fact at any given moment most men\nare not going to be interested in the\nprospect of settling down and this\ncreates a problem for you women because\nit can be very difficult to\ndifferentiate between the men who might\nbe interested in getting married and the\nmen who just aren't you certainly can't\ntell the difference just by looking at\nthem however while every situation is\ndifferent some general rules tend to\napply leaving aside the question of\nwhether men should get married today I'm\ngoing to explain to you why men do get\nmarried when they choose to do so in the\nvast majority of cases men don't get\nmarried to their ideal woman it's not\nlike the movies in which a confirmed\nBachelor is persuaded to tie the knot\nwhen the right woman comes along that's\nnot how it works for men in the vast\nmajority of cases ladies listen real\nclose men get married to a woman who is\ngood\nenough when everything is\nworking this means ladies that being the\nperfect woman is less important than\nchoosing the right moment and that being\nperfect is less important than being\nunpr\nproblematic you have to appreciate that\nfrom the perspective of any relatively\nsane man starting a family is an\nenormous responsibility no reasonable\nman is going to do that when he is\nfeeling financially insecure or his\ncareer prospects are uncertain or he\nhasn't yet secured his place in the\nworld or conversely when you threaten to\nleave the relationship or you are\nemotionally volatile or you nag or\ncomplain or criticize or provoke or\nneglect or otherwise create unnecessary\nproblems for him like I said a man gets\nmarried when everything is working both\nin his career and in his\nrelationship starting a family when\neverything is not working is\nirresponsible it's not a good idea to\nbring children into the world when\nmaterial conditions are unstable\nuncertain or insufficient and any decent\nman is going to appreciate that fact the\nright woman at the wrong time does\nnothing to change this what's more a man\nwho hasn't yet achieved the status\ninfluence or professional success he\nwould like to enjoy will be very\nreticent to start a family because of\nhow much time energy and attention a\nwife and children require time energy\nand attention that could otherwise be\nchanneled into their personal and\nprofessional development so men who for\nwhatever reason haven't yet arrived at\nMaterial stability who H or who haven't\nyet found their place in the world are\nnot going to be interested nor should\nthey be interested in getting married\nwhy because it's not about you it's\nabout his moment in life the upshot of\nthis should be obvious women if you want\nto get married sooner as opposed to\nlater you absolutely need to Target a\nman who is stable who is financially\nsuccessful and who already has attained\nto some status in the world and this\ngenerally means older men it takes time\nto do all of these things and there's\nonly so much a man can do to hurry it\nalong in general a man who has\neverything else in place will eventually\nturn his attention to starting a family\nhaven't your girls read Jane Austin like\nthe first line of Pride and Prejudice is\nit is a truth universally acknowledged\nthat a single man in possession of a\ngood fortune must be in want of a wife\ncorrect it doesn't go the other way\naround why because once a man has a wife\nit's harder for him to possess a good\nfortune this is because the wife tends\nto use up not only the fortune but the\ntime energy and attention needed to\ncreate additional Fortune as well well\nyou women are expensive and when we're\ndealing with you we're not dealing with\nanything else in any case Austin was\nright the fortune has to come first so\nTarget older men because they're more\nlikely to have it now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom its message because it's Word of\nMouth referrals like this that really\nhelp to make the channel grow I'm also\nproud to announce that I'll soon be\npublishing my book The of others so if\nyou'd like to learn more about that then\nyou can go to my website and sign up for\nmy Weekly Newsletter finally please fill\nout an inquiry form on my website if\nyou're looking to book a paid\nconsultation link is in the description\nlet's get back to it now targeting older\nmen is especially important to consider\nif you're a woman looking to find a\nhusband in a major city like New York or\nSan Francisco or Los Angeles the cost of\nliving in these cities is so insanely\nhigh that men need a lot more money to\nfeel like they have enough to take on\ndependence like it's hard enough to have\na decent Life as a single person in\nthese places throw in a wife and kids\nand a lot of guys are going to feel like\nthey first need to increase their\nearning potential or their net worth by\nan order of magnitude and it takes a lot\nof time and effort to do that so that's\none of the main reasons why men are\ngetting married later in life the\nmaterial Threshold at which men feel\ncomfortable about responsibly taking on\nwomen and children is getting higher and\nhigher as the cost of living increases\nacross the board and this is made even\nmore difficult by the fact that men now\nneed to compete with you women for the\nsame\nmoney like a lot of women out out there\nbusting their ass\nthinking they need to provide for a\nhusband and kids most women wouldn't get\nmarried to a man who required financial\nsupport a lot of you are earning money\nto hedge your bets in case the marriage\nthing doesn't work out but because\nyou're doing that you actually make it\nless likely that you will get married\nbecause it's going to take more and more\ntime and effort for the men around you\nto get the money they will they need to\nfeel in order to feel like he's ready to\nshare it with you and the kids without\ncompletely losing his life in the\nprocess and if and when he gets there\nhe's probably not going to want to sign\nover all of that hard-earned money to a\nwoman with two good years of fertility\nleft which is another reason why women\nshould Target older men especially while\nthey're still young and here's the most\nimportant part of all this it's the most\nimportant part because it's the part you\nwomen actually control men get married\nwhen everything is working especially in\nthe\nrelationship every problem that you\nunnecessarily introduce into the\nrelationship is a stumbling block that\nyou're throwing in your own path why\nbecause when a man is thinking of\ngetting married he's gonna look at his\nwoman and\nthink could I deal with this for the\nrest of my life that means if you're\nissuing demands and ultimatums he's\ngoing to think am I going to have to\ndeal with demands and ultimatums for the\nrest of my life and you know what I\ndon't care who he is he is not going to\nwant to deal with demands and ultimatums\nfor the rest of his life so why the\nwould he sign up for that same thing\nwith jealousy or criticism or laziness\nor emotionality or judgmentalism or\nsexlessness or any of the hundreds of\nthings that women are subject to bring\nto their\nrelationships to get married as a woman\nyou do not need to be\nhot you do not need to be\nCharming you do not need to be brilliant\nor accomplished or anything nearly so\npositive you have to be unpr\nproblematic that's it because a man's\nimagination will magnify and extend\nevery problem that you introduce into\nthe relationship into the indefinite\nfuture\ntrust me this is enough to terrify an\notherwise reasonable and well-meaning\nman away from marrying you so let's\nrecap men get married when everything is\nworking this means that he has achieved\nsome measure of wealth and status and he\nhas a clear and realistic vision for a\nfuture characterized by prosperous\nstability when a man attains to this\nstate he will consider marrying a woman\nprovided she is not introducing any more\ndifficulty into his life everything is\nnot working when a woman creates\nunnecessary arguments or frustrations or\ndisappointments and he will likely not\nmove forward unless and until these are\nresolved and if he's dealing with these\nissues he's not spending time and energy\non making the rest of his life work\nwhich will further compromise his\nwillingness to commit so whatever you do\ndon't rock the boat you'll probably\nprobably just end up getting tipped out\nof it what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know in\nthe comments below as always I\nappreciate your support and thank you\nfor listening and now a word
