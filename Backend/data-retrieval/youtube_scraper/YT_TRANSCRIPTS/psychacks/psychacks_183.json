    "transcript": "and if you actually succeed in winning\nit's because no one else thought it was\nworth that much like by definition you\nmust have overpaid like the likelihood\nthat you hit the exact correct minimum\namount of value if you went any lower\nyou would have been out bid is\nfunctionally zero so you paid more for\nthat than you needed to because no one\nelse thought that that good was worth\nwhat you did and so that's part of the\ndisappointment of actually getting what\nyou want is you probably overpay the\nidea is wow I finally won I got what I\nwas doing for but look at all that I had\nto give up all of the years all of the\nthe relationships all of the\nopportunities that I've had to surrender\nto get this was it worth it it's a tough\nquestion to answer and most people in\norder to resolve their own cognitive\ndissonance will say oh yeah it's\ndefinitely it's definitely worth it"
