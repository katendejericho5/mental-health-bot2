    "transcript": "it's it's problematic in many respects\nfor the woman to be on a pedestal one of\nthe concepts that I talk about a lot on\nmy channel is the balance of Attraction\nwhich is very simply that it's not\npossible for two people to like each\nother exactly the same amount which\nmeans that one person must always like\nthe other person more and the other\nperson must like the other person less\nthese things change they generally don't\nchange like this but they kind of the\nGap can go up and down one person is\ngenerally the adorer and the other\nperson is the adored the person up here\non the pedestal is the adored now there\nare pros and cons to both of these\npositions it's not like one is better\nthan the other and in fact most people\ncontrary to popular belief want to be\nhere they want to be the adorer what\nexactly because the adorer gets to be\nwith the one they love and there's no\ngreater victory in popular culture than\nthat and when you're with the one that\nyou love you get to experience the\npanoply of human emotions that comes\nwith that"
