    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is women\nover 30 so I wanted to make this episode\nbecause I've done a few consultations\nwith women over 30 recently and I found\nthem all to be inappropriately\npessimistic about their chances of\nfinding a husband which is what they\nwere all interested in doing they all\nthought that purely because of their age\nthey were functionally screwed in\ntoday's dating market and though this\nmight not J with some of my male\naudience that's not really true as I\ndiscussed in my episode the way it all\nends in which I reviewed the various\noutcome scenarios for women in\nrelationships most women turn out okay\nthat is most women end up in a decent\nrelationship they may not end up in the\nrelationship with the man they would\nprefer but most of them are not going to\ndie alone neglected and forgotten that's\na much more likely scenario for men so\nmost women end up in a workable\nsituation and they're much less likely\nto fall through the cracks than men are\nand any man who is disappointed to hear\nthis is probably suffering from some\nmeasure of unhealed wounding that\neagerly awaits a woman's comeuppance\nirrespective of how Justified that\ncomeuppance might be this anticipatory\nshoden Freud creates a bitterness that\nyou have to deal with so I would\nencourage you to find a way to resolve\nit for your own piece of heart in any\ncase these women were in my opinion\ninappro\npessimistic about their prospects and\nwhen I would tell them this they would\nsometimes cite things that I said in my\nepisodes like but Orion you said that\nthe game changes at 30 because after 30\nthe average man's sexual Marketplace\nvalue is higher than the average woman's\nsexual Marketplace value so if I don't\nhave a husband by 30 I'm never going to\nfind one and well it is true that the\ngame changes at 30 and well it is true\nthat most women are going to be\noperating under a relative disadv vage\nfrom that point forward this does not\nmean that women can't get married after\n30 people can still get what they want\neven when they are subject to a\ndisadvantage and the proof of that is\nthat most men are at a disadvantage\nthroughout their entire 20s that's a\nWhole Decade of disadvantage for men in\nthe sexual Marketplace and yet every day\nmen in that age cohort finds ways to get\nlaid get into relationships and get\nmarried despite their disadvantage the\npoint is that having a disadvantage\ndoesn't mean that you can't win it is of\ncourse far easier to win while you still\nhave an advantage but you're not doomed\nwithout it what it does mean however is\nthat you can't expect to win at a\ndisadvantage without making an\neffort as I say the game changes at 30\nthis means that in order to get what\nthey want women have to change their\nstrategy in their 30s and just like a\nteam that is down a few points with the\nclock running out women typically have\nto adopt a more aggressive approach to\nget what they want think about it how do\nmen in their 20s get what they want\ndespite their relative disadvantage they\n make an effort ladies they\nhustle they have to work to make it\nhappen were you just handing out sex and\nrelationships to every man who wanted\nthose things from you in your 20s I\ndoubt it and who got those things from\nyou the men who went after them in the\nright way the same is true for you men\nare not going to be handing out marriage\nand relationships to every woman who\nwants these things in their 30s\nespecially because a lot of these guys\nput up with a lot of your in\ntheir 20s the women in their 30s who get\nthe things that they want are the ones\nwho go after them in the right way women\nin their 20s can kind of get away with\njust\nwaiting and they can get away with this\nstrategy not because they are inherently\nsome priz or precious Jewel but because\nthey occupy a privileged position in the\nsexual Marketplace it is an attribute of\nthe position not the gender the problem\nwith women in their 30s is that they\nhaven't yet changed their strategy you\ncan't wait you can wait you can wait if\nyou're in the advantaged position\nhowever if you wait in the disadvantaged\nposition you are you're\nlike this does not work women can still\nwin in their 30s but they have to make\nan effort and just like the successful\nmen in their 20s they have to make an\neffort to engage the attention of the\nopposite sex by learning the suite of\nskills that work on their target\naudience men who have optionality with\nwomen are not just lucky they typically\nworked very hard to enjoy that\noptionality they experiment and grind\nand study and transform it's a lot of\neffort now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really helped to make the\nchannel grow I'm also proud to announce\nthat I'll soon be publishing my book the\nvalue of others so if you'd like to\nlearn more about that you can go to my\nwebsite and sign up for my Weekly\nNewsletter finally please fill out an\ninquiry form on my website if you're\ninterested in booking a paid\nconsultation the link is in the\ndescription let's get back to it now I'm\ntelling you all this ladies because you\ndon't usually see men's effort you just\nsee the outcome an interesting smooth\nCharming charismatic and confident man\nis genely the result of a good deal of\nwork you too can be the sweet sexy\nsupportive endearing and feminine women\nthat has optionality with men but it's\ngoing to take a lot of work most likely\nyou will need to make an effort and\nexpecting that a man should love you or\nwife you up despite the absence of these\nqualities is equivalent to a man\nexpecting that a woman should just\nhim even if he is awkward anxious boring\nrude and creepy it does not work just\nlike men generally have to transform\nthemselves to be attractive to women\nwomen generally have to transform\nthemselves to be attractive to men and\njust like men generally need game to get\nlaid women generally need game to get\nmarried do you understand now your age\nis going to give you a rough estimate of\nhow hard you're going to have to work\nladies it's not perfect but for ease of\nunderstanding let's imagine a 20-year\nperiod from 20 to 40 with 30 at the\nmidpoint so if you're a 32y old woman\nyou might have to bust your ass a little\nto make things happen at this point the\nswitching Advantage is still fairly\nrecent and the Gap is still fairly small\nmany of you won't even have noticed a\nchange at this point however if you're a\n38-year old woman you might have to bust\nyour ass a lot to make something happen\nthis is because there's a kind of\nsymmetry to the whole arrangement a\n38-year-old woman is kind of equivalent\nto a 22-year-old man and a 22y old man\ngets all for being a 22y old man do\nyou hear me he has to go out there and\nbust his ass every day to make something\nhappen otherwise too bad so sad the\nworld passes him\nby now in today's digital economy there\nare some 22-year-old men who are\nabsolutely killing it they are making\nseven figures a year and have already\nbuilt interesting and emotionally\ncompelling Lifestyles but they are the\nexceptions most men are struggling if\nnot functionally invisible in the sexual\nMarketplace at this point in their lives\nby the same token there are some\n38-year-old women who are still slaying\nit out there they're getting serious\noffers from all kinds of successful men\nand they have the support and the\nresources to start a family later in\nlife but they are the exceptions most\nwomen are struggling though not quite as\ninvisible in the sexual Marketplace at\nthis point in their lives this is why\nthe default mode for women is to act\nwhile they still have the advantage and\nthe default mode for men is to wait\nuntil they have the advantage why\nbecause it's easier to get more of what\nyou want when you occupy a privileged\nposition so if waiting is no longer a\nviable strategy for women in their 30s\nwhat should they do ladies you have to\nremember that for many centuries women\nwere actually the ones who initiated the\ncourtship process they just did so in an\nindirect manner that retained plausible\ndeniability to protect their honor in\nVictorian England for example the\nstereotypical way a woman used to do\nthis was to accidentally drop her\nhandkerchief in front of the man she was\ninterested in initiating a conversation\nwith this gave the man a reason\nto talk to her\nregardless of how attractive a woman is\nfew men are going to stop a woman out of\nthe blue and pick her up unless she\ngives him an invitation to do so so a\nwoman would provide him with that\ninvitation by dropping her handkerchief\nthat way he could pick it up and go oh\nExcuse Me Miss I believe you dropped\nthis and she could Giggle and say oh my\nhow terribly clumsy of me I'm ever so\ngrateful and boom she is now in a\nconversation and the great part of all\nof this was if the guy turned out to be\nadult she could just say well thank you\nso much for the handkerchief but I\nreally must be going I'm already late\nfor tea with great aunt Melba and go on\nher Merry way because she had plausible\ndeniability women you need to find the\nmodern day equivalent of dropping your\nhandkerchief like that's the bare\n minimum amount of effort needed\nto make something happen and if you're\nnot willing to do even\nthat you're going to have a tough time\nout there change change your strategy\nyou can still win despite your\ndisadvantage but you need to make an\neffort and I know that this is true\nbecause men do this all the time what do\nyou think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow as usual I appreciate your support\nand thank you for your understanding and\nnow a word about\nStellar if you're
