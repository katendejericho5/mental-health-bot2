    "transcript": "hello everybody thanks for joining\nme I'm Dr Orion taban this is my first\nattempt at a live stream so you might\nhave to bear with me as I work through\nsome of the Kinks but thank you for\nbeing here on time and I hope that we\ncan have an interesting and fruitful\ndiscussion I see that there are\nalready uh about 78 or 80 of you in the\nchat that's\nfantastic uh hopefully you guys can help\nme with some questions otherwise I'll\njust be monologuing up here for quite\nsome time which I don't think would be\ninteresting for any of us uh I'll start\nout by saying uh thank you for joining\nme the purpose of this live stream is to\ndiscuss the book that just came out the\nvalue of others um hopefully we can stay\non topic there because I know that can\nbe somewhat complicated it can be\nsomewhat provocative and there's a lot\nof ideas in the book that I hope that we\ncan kind of parse out today together\nI'll begin by saying so far it's been\nphenomenal uh the book was launched last\nWednesday so six days ago and already\nit's a number one bestseller on Amazon\nin a number of categories which is just\na phenomenal response I don't have a\nPublishing House I don't have an agent I\ndon't have a marketer I don't work with\npromoters I don't do paid advertising\nthe fact that this book has been able to\nGarner this kind of reaction it's really\na word of mouth and Grassroots effort\nit's thanks to you um for spreading the\nmessage and sharing the book and the\ncontent with other people who might\nbenefit I I honestly couldn't do this\nwithout you because I'm really in many\nrespects one guy sitting in his living\nroom uh trying to make something\nhappen and so I want to thank you so\nmuch for the support that you've shown\nthus far I think that the book has legs\nit could go some distance and I think\nwe're just getting\nstarted so here we are about 211 people\njoining wow that's fantastic\nso let's get into some of these\nquestions the chat is coming hard and\nfast so I might not be able to get to\neverything but let's see um Bill Tomkins\nhe says question why do so many\nrelationship books feel like mostly\nfluff this book feels like real truth\nwhy is that so rare to find these days\nthat is an excellent question and I've\nbeen thinking about\nthis in my uh private life and I'm\ntrying to figure out how to make an\nepisode about it but since you asked\nthis is let me take a stab at it so I I\ndo kind of approach this idea in the\nbook I think there's just like one or\ntwo sentences about it which is that\nthere are rules and laws about\nrelationships laws are more biologically\ndetermined and seem to be Universal to\ntime and place but rules are really\nculturally bound they're really specific\nto specific times and places and you're\nnot supposed to break the rules like you\ncan't break the rules with interpersonal\nimpunity and the fact of the matter is\nis that the core of all relationships\nbetween men and women is transactional\nokay but you're not supposed to say the\nquiet part out loud that is violating\none of the rules of our culture which is\nthat transaction we're not really\nsupposed to openly acknowledge we're not\nsupposed\nto really highlight and make explicit\nit's supposed to kind of be operating\nbehind the scenes out of sight and out\nof mind and in an attempt to distract\nfrom the core component of relationships\nwe've covered relationships with a lot\nof with a lot of fluff okay\nokay where we talk about love languages\nand we talk about improving effective\ncommunication and we talk about learning\nto listen and to compromise\nokay what I'm going to say is that the\nproblem is too many people listen to\nthat and they take it too seriously and\nthey attempt to fix a deeper problem\nwhich is the level of the transaction by\noffering a superficial Solution on the\nlevel of the and so people go\nto coup's therapy and they try to\nimprove their communication or they read\nbooks and try to meet their Partners\nLove Languages and it doesn't really\nwork and they're very baffled as to why\nit's not working because they're doing\nwhat their culture more or less tells\nthem that they should\ndo the issue is that they're not really\naddressing the root problem which is\nthat there's some sort of dysfunction or\nimbalance in the transaction at the\nheart of the relationship to put it\nanother\nway in the professional Arena you're\nexchanging labor and time for money okay\nbut even in a professional\nArena we can't be too explicit about\nthat like if you were to go in for a job\ninterview and they said well why do you\nwant a job at this company and you said\nwell I've been very passionate about not\nstarving and I would like the money to\nbe able to buy food and pay my\nbills that's just a little too mercenary\nokay by the same token those same\ncompanies who are have trouble hiring\npeople they'll do all kinds of things\nthey'll talk about how they have an\ninclusive culture and everyone's a\nfamily here and we offer professional\ndevelopment and we really want each\nmember to make an\nimpactful uh influence on the company\nand the and the destiny of our product\netc etc etc and a lot of these companies\nare still having trouble hiring people\nand then you ask the employees like what\nthe problem is it's like well you don't\npay\nenough like a lot the companies wouldn't\nhave to do all that other if\nthey paid people more if they could pay\npeople more paying people more will\nsolve a lot of problems in the office do\nyou understand because that's actually\nthe court transaction at the heart of\nprofessional relationships is the\nexchange of money for Time and\nLabor um addressing the other\nthat we use to mask that uh leads people\nastray\nokay um but on some level culture has\ndeveloped to kind of protect people so\nthat people don't feel too mercenary\nabout exchanging their time and their\nlabor for money because that can rub\npeople the wrong way by the same token\nwhen you make the transaction at the\nheart of sexual relationships too\nexplicit it can really rub people the\nwrong way it can offend people's dignity\nbecause it lowers the what's supposed to\nbe Sublime and emotional to the level of\num needs and wants which feels icky even\nthough if you solve the relationship\nproblems on the level of needs and wants\nyou don't have to do any other fluff and\n in the vast majority of cases\nit's equivalent to paying people more\nnow paying people more in the\nprofessional environment doesn't solve\nall problems for all\npeople but it solves a lot of the\nproblems like a lot of people would\nwould feel more respected they would\nfeel more secure they would feel more\nenthusiastic about going to work if they\nhad higher salaries I think that's true\nfor pretty much any line of work no\nmatter what you do um and and if you\ndon't feel like you're getting enough\nthen smaller problems are going to feel\nmore detrimental and we also see that in\nromantic relationships when the\ntransaction becomes unbalanced and one\nparty feels like he or she is giving\nmore than he or she is getting then\nsmaller things become prob atic like\nthere is more irritability there is more\nwithdrawal there's more like Petty\nfights um and these fights from a\ntherapeutic perspective are very rarely\nabout what the fights seem to be about\nwhich can be about really insignificant\nsmall things but the fights about those\nsmall things are really proxies for\npower are really proxies for Value um\nbut it feels too mercenary to address\nthat directly\nand in any case we're trained by our\nculture not to because that's a\nviolation of one of the rules which is\nyou're supposed to provide value but\nyou're not really supposed to call\nattention to the idea that you're\nproviding value right okay so hopefully\nthat uh answered some of the questions\nthere let's take a look\nhere um oh boy it's coming hard and\nfast if you have a question it will help\nme if you put in like big capital\nletters question because I'm getting a\nlot of different comments here and that\nwill help me to differentiate it from\nthose other\nthings\num why do you feel like we Juan narz\nsays why do you feel like we can't\ndirectly discuss this transaction it's\nalmost so indirected unconscious that\nit's difficult to understand why this\nwould\nbe um it's hard to know how rules\ndevelop like I talk about the symptom\npool in one of my episodes that cultures\nand symptom pools are kind of like\nemergent phenomenon people can influence\nthese things but no one can really like\ndecide this is the rule now like we have\nlaws people can decide that I suppose\nbut if the law is opposed to the\ncultural rule it's it's going to have a\ntough time being obeyed and that law\nprobably isn't going to last very long\non the books unless there's some sort of\ntyranny or\num a police measure or aggressive\nmeasure to maintain it right so you have\nto understand that at the heart of\nintersexual relationships between men\nand women is the transaction of value\nand fundamentally men are exchanging\nresources for sex and women are\nexchanging sex for resources\nwhich on some level means that the vast\nmajority of sexual relationships between\nmen and women are like indirect forms of\nprostitution like it's prostitution with\nextra steps okay and it's only an actual\nprostitution where literal explicit\nmoney is exchanged for literal explicit\nsex in the vast majority of romantic\nrelationships it's money but it's also\ntime it's energy its attention it's\nopportunity and it's exchanged for\nthe possibility of sex or the sexual\nopportunity as I talk about in the book\nand this is offensive to a lot of people\nit's it's offensive to exchange sex for\nresources that's what Horrors do okay\nand I've found very few people who want\nto publicly be seen and known in that\nway though behind closed doors sometimes\nit's another story right um but the idea\nhere is that goes against the Dignity of\nthe lady in the vast majority of cases\nand so there is a complicated ritual\nthat we have developed that has like\nprotected the Dignity of\nwoman that so that she needn't feel that\nshe's actually exchanging her sexual\nopportunity her reproductive opportunity\nfor resources and among other things\nthat's the courtship process and the\ninstitution of marriage socially that's\ndifferent from like the religious or\nspiritual institution it's the social\ninstitution of\nmarriage and in this way women are sort\nof like protected against it and um let\nme tell you that's a very good\nopportunity for a lot of women like\nwomen can exchange a great deal of\nresources for not a lot of sexual\nopportunity in a committed marriage\nprobably way more than she could get on\nthe open market so um that it still\nexists the heart of even that social\ninstitution but it needs to be covered\nto sort of like protect the Dignity of\nthe individuals involved because no one\nlikes to feel like they're just doing\nthings for money but in a professional\ncontext you wouldn't like it either even\nthough you work explicitly for a\npaycheck if your boss just sort of like\ndangled money in front of you and said\ndo you want this\n$10,000 what would you do for this\n$10,000 like you might want that 10\ngrand you might need that 10 grand but\nthe more\nexplicit that person makes it the more\nit offends your dignity as a person and\nyou might even out of pride and\nself-respect decide that you're not\ngoing to do what you need to do to get\nthat money because you'd rather have\nyour self-respect than the 10 grand so\nthe more explicit the transaction\nbecomes the more there's sort of like a\ncalculus around how much do I want the\nthing and how much do I want to kind of\nprotect my honor or my sense of dignity\nhere um ideally you get both uh but\nthat's not always possible sometimes we\nhave to make trade-offs or at least to\nprioritize certain things\nokay kind of a spicy answer but that's\nwhat I've been thinking\nabout\nOkay Ross sherlin says I know you focus\non a lot about sex but how does\nlong-term companionship and they want to\ndevelop a family and have children fit\ninto that equation does sex absolutely\nTrump that no it sex does not absolutely\nTrump that and people get\ninto uh relationship for all kinds of\ndifferent\nreasons um and I I think I talk about an\nexample of that in the first chapter\nwhere a man it's a hypothetical man but\nthis hypothetical man could be an\narchetype for many people um and many\nmen that I've actually consulted with\nand uh this person may have chosen to\nforgo let's say more attractive sexual\nopportunities for a woman who wanted to\nbe a mother and might have good maternal\ninstincts and\nbecause that woman given his sub his\npriority of goals has more of what he\nwants he might be willing to forgo the\nsexual opportunity in order for a woman\nto start a family with okay the issue\nwith that is that once the children come\nand certainly after the children are\ngrown to a certain extent the\nreproductive attractiveness and the\nmaternal instincts becomes more and more\nirrelevant\nand the Really tragic nature of\nrelationships in general is that by\ngiving people what they want we we often\nare complicit in lowering our own\nvalue like I say in the book no one\ncontinues to pay the plumber the plumber\nis a very urgent and important person\nwhen the toilet is clogged but after the\ntoilet is\nunclogged he's like okay here's your\nmoney I need to get on with my kind of a\nthing and no one continues to pay the\nplumber after the work is done right so\nwhen you go into a relationship for a\nspecific reason if you don't get that\nthing well that's sort of like bait and\nswitch or a misleading tactic which is\none of the strategies in the sexual\nMarketplace it always has been and\nalways will be\num so you you generally do have to give\npeople more or less what you've promised\nto give them or what you in good faith\nentered into the relationship to\ntransact but in the process of\ngiving the person needs you less because\nthat need has been\ndischarged this is what's really tricky\nabout maintaining relationships over\ntime because let's say what a 20\nsomething needs is going to be very\ndifferent from what a 70s something\nneeds but on some level we kind of\nexpect that the one person is supposed\nto discharge all of our needs at all of\nthese different stages of the lifespan\nthroughout all kinds of different um\nroles like that person might be a great\nmother um and might have a really good\nInstinct with children but might be a\nterrible wife might be a might be a very\nbad lover um may not really be\ninterested in the things that you're\ninterested in might be kind of cold and\ndistant but would be really great for\nthe mother you see and one of the things\nI talk about in chapter 12 is of the\nthings that causes marriages and\nlong-term relationships to fail is the\nexpectation that one person be too many\nthings um especially across a lifespan\nit's not very popular but sometimes\nrelationships run their course and\nbecause of course all relationships end\none way or another um and sometimes I\nthink it's wiser and better to let\nrelationships run their course to do\nthat intentionally than to try to fit\npeople into boxes that may not be what\nthey even originally signed up for to\nbegin with\nright in in my opinion if there's\nany purpose to marriage it's to provide\na safe context for children to be raised\nand that's it like that's I think it's\nfundamentally a very humble institution\nas I say in the book marriage was never\nmeant to be uh a partnership with your\nbest friend it was never meant to be an\nadventure with your romantic lover uh it\nwas never meant to be etc etc etc for\nthousands of years a marriage was sort\nof like running a small\nbusiness because life was very hard and\nyou had what five to 12 children and you\nneeded that because you needed the extra\nhands to stay out of starvation on some\nlevel and you needed somebody to kind of\nlike keep the Machinery of the small\nbusiness running and if you wanted love\nif you had the luxury of being able to\nafford that you found that elsewhere and\nif you if you a best friend you\ngenerally had it most men spend most of\nthe days with other men and most women\nspend most of their days with other\nwomen for the vast majority of human\nhistory um but with the decline of real\ncommunities and the Advent of the\nnuclear family so extended kid networks\ndon't really exist anymore we've asked\nour spouse our partner to be all things\nfor all time and that's just an\nimpossible situation for anybody to\ndischarge so um and and then we blame\nthe people or ourselves for not living\nup to let's say impossible expectations\nand one of the arguments I make in the\nbook is that it might be time for us to\ncollectively examine the maturity and\nthe realizability of those expectations\nfor long-term relationships and to do\nthat with our feet on the ground and not\nwith star-eyed romantic\nideals that's what I got for you with\nthat okay\nquestion Robert Green interview wouldn't\nthat be fun I'm I'm actually slowly\nmaking my way through the 48 Laws of\nPower for the very first time I'm I'm\nashamed to admit it but it's the first\ntime I've read one of his books it's a\nfantastic book like I highly recommend\nit most people in this chat probably are\naware of it or have read it already if\nnot get your hands on a copy uh he\nclearly put a lot of effort and thought\ninto that book um I would love to talk\nto him one of the chapters of the book\nis about power um I did write it before\nI read the book so hopefully no one\nthinks that I I CRI his ideas but having\nnow read most of the book I think that I\ndo offer some um some original content\non that\ntheme what I've discovered though and\nthis is true for in general sometimes I\nget requests through the comments or\nthrough emails or through DMs for me to\ntalk to a specific person I don't do a\nlot of talks on my show I can talk about\nthat for a second I haven't done one for\na while um I would love to be able to\ntalk a lot of these people but I found\nthat it's always better when I'm invited\nversus when I invite myself in the past\nwhen I've tried to invite myself it's\nnever worked I just end up in the inbox\nwith anybody else so I've stopped doing\nthat and now if I now I wait for the\ninvitation and I find that that's\ngenerally more conducive to\nsuccess uh the reason why I haven't been\ndoing interviews on my channel is more\nwith respect the\nalgorithm\nuh the algorithm has been trained on my\nCadence and my content and this is true\nfor any other regular content creator\nnow I do full length episodes on Mondays\nand Fridays they're between usually\neight and 15 minutes long and on other\ndays I usually publish about two shorts\na day at very regular times what I\ndiscovered is that when I would do a\nlong form interview\njust sort of as a one-off and put that\non the channel it it didn't really get\ngood views but even worse it tended to\nlike\naffect the the channel for like weeks\nafterwards like every time I would put a\nlong form interview views would go down\nfor four weeks afterwards because the\nalgorithm was like what are you doing\nyou need to stay in your lane or you\nneed to do this so regularly that it's\nyour new standard operating procedure\nand I I don't have the bandwidth to do\nthat regularly maybe further down the\nroad I I I'm still kind of wearing Three\nHats and working three jobs so I I don't\nreally have the capacity to do that\nright now um so that's why I've held off\non doing more long form interviews on my\nchannel but if you'd like me to talk to\nother people one of the best things to\ndo is to get into those creators inboxes\nand DM them and say hey have you heard\nabout this guy Orion on pyx I think you\ntoo would be great and if that gives\nthem a chance to kind of Snoop on me a\nlittle bit and do their research and if\nthey agree with you uh they often extend\nan invitation so that's the best way to\nget interviews between me and anybody\nelse you might want to talk to\nokay let's see oh here's something that\nhas to do oh somebody\npaid 50 bucks okay let's let's go there\nokay got my attention with money uh\nCaesar price thanks for your\nhello rizm okay it's a high high praise\ndo you think that men have low standards\nyeah that's an easy one I was talking to\nmy therapist and I recognized that a lot\nof men tolerate bad behavior from women\njust for the sake to get\nlaid Yeah you hit the nail on the head\nman um one of the things I talk about in\nthe book is that one of\nthe the less acknowledged benefit to\nhaving\noptionality in the sexual Marketplace is\nthat with optionality you are not forced\nto choose between your emotional and\nsexual needs and your dignity and\nself-respect because that's very\ndifficult to do like people will choose\ntheir dignity and self-respect when\nthings get really bad but then they're\nhaving to deal with horniness with\nloneliness with isolation with a host of\nother\nproblems so\nit's not really a good choice either way\nokay\ninterestingly having optionality also\ngenerally increases the quality of\ninteraction that you have with any given\nwoman Patrice Neil talks about this\nwhere he talks about how like fish need\nto smell other fish on the fisherman to\nknow how to know that that fisher can\ncatch other\nfish the fact of the matter is is that\neveryone is unique and everyone is\nreplaceable that's a that's like the\nthird episode I ever made on this\nchannel go back to some of the old stuff\nsome of them have really good ideas in\nit but the tech isn't there so I can\nunderstand why it might be difficult to\ngo backwards um but the idea here is\nwhen when people know that there I are\neither others waiting in the wings or\nthere could very easily be other people\nwaiting in the\nwings uh and they want to keep their\nposition they find a way to act\nright and that generally makes it less\nnecessary to have to choose between\ndignity and self-respect and one sexual\nand emotional\nneeds\num and I also talk about one of the\nreasons why men have low standards in\nthe book at greater length which is\nthat potentially one of the reproductive\nincentives of men is to spread their\nseed far and wide I mean that's why men\ncreate billions and billions of sperm\nevery every\nmonth is to like always be ready for the\npossibility of a sexual opportunity\nfalling in his lap and one of the\nbest reproductive strategies from an\nevolutionary standpoint is for a man to\nreproduce with as many different women\nand as many different kinds of women as\npossible because the genetic mix match\nwill create kind of a\nrobust buffer so that at least some of\nhis children will survive to\nreproductive maturity themselves this\nisn't the only reproductive strategy\nwith a great deal of success but it's\none of them\nright uh so for most men you don't\nreally need to have a good\noption in order to just like shoot shot\nif you're if you have if you're firing\nbillions of shots you know it just needs\nto be a non- terrible shot and I think\nthat's\nwhy most men tend to have lower\nstandards than women is because H if it\ndoesn't work out she's not the best\nthat's okay at least that's out there\nand I can I can just sauner on like the\nthe risks and responsibilities of\npregnancy and child birth are just so\ndisproportionately carried by men and\nwomen a man can shoot a shot leave in\nthe leave before the sun rises and never\nsee that woman again and that woman\ncould be left with a pregnancy and a an\nextended motherhood that she wasn't\nlooking for potentially in that moment\nso uh women tend to\nhave much much higher standards with\nrespect to their sexual partners um\nbecause there's also a huge opportunity\ncost there\num you know if they they only create one\nfertilizable eg a month and if they do\nbecome pregnant then they can't become\npregnant with any other man's child for\npretty much a year it's a huge cost I\nmean if if men bore a similar cost that\nevery time they made a man a woman\npregnant he she he couldn't do that\nagain for another year I think men would\nalso be more cautious about who they\nslept with but this is the world that we\nlive\nin okay what do we got\nhere Zima\nbeloved thank you for your donation how\ncan a woman please her husband if it's a\nlong-distance relationship marriage\nthat's a great\nquestion\nso first of all I'll start by saying\nthat in general long distance\nrelationships don't\nwork especially if it's before the\nmarriage part like I I know that's not\nyour case but let me talk about this for\na second um if you're if you're still\ndating and it's long distance then you\nneed to find a way to kind of get\ntogether and be in the same place at the\nsame time um otherwise what you're doing\nwhat are you doing because like to date\nyou actually have to spend time with\neach other and do things and you're not\ndoing that when you're with a\nphone uh it's a lot of ATT ention and\nbuildup without any kind of relief or\nrelease so it can actually be very\nromantic and it could lead people into\nrelationships because they're filling in\nthe gaps in their knowledge base with\nwhat they want to\nsee uh despite all of my thoughts to the\ncontrary I I once got involved in a\nlong-term relationship um against my\nbetter judgment a while ago and because\nI was\nwas uh this this woman lived on the\nother side of the world basically and we\nwere just communicating through the\nphone which is a very curated and um\npeole into somebody's life like through\na phone a person can type it out think\nabout it edit it be very careful about\nwhat he or she says show just what he or\nshe wants the other person to see it can\nbe a\nvery\num curated that's the nice word or a\nvery real istic view of who that person\nmight be um but of course if what you\nsee stimulates your attraction enough\nyou're going to fill in the gaps with\nwhat you want to find there because\nthat's what attraction\ndoes and once you actually get with the\nperson in the same place at the same\ntime it usually doesn't take long to\nrealize how your model of what that\nperson might have might be that was\nbuilt over the months or years of long\ndist relationship doesn't really Accord\nin reality so um I'm pretty against long\nrelationship in the courtship that said\nThis Woman's question is about\nlongdistance marriage sounds like or SL\nmarriage Law's marriages can actually\nwork pretty\nwell why like I was saying earlier it's\nkind of unnatural for men and women to\nbe spending so much time with each other\nJames ston the divorce lawyer who became\nvery uh popular on the internet in\nrecent months um he had this great line\non his interview with soft white Under\nbelly which was that married folks\nsigned up for Better or For Worse but\nnot for lunch and that's kind of what\nhappened in Co is that they were\nspending so much time together that the\ndivorce rate like went through the roof\nin that first year or two of the\nshutdowns sometimes distance and\nsomebody's work saves a marriage like\nbeing able to have someplace to\ngo is probably what keeps more\nrelationships together than we might\nthink\nand think about how it used to be for\nmany many times uh in olden times we\ntend to romanticize the 1950s well that\nwas sort of the age of the traveling\nsalesman and a lot of these guys were on\nthe road 200 days out of the Year while\nthe the woman was at home baking and\nraising the kids and on some level that\nobstruction may have kept both of those\npeople more happy and in that\nrelationship so\nobviously this needs to be\nnavigated and um you know consented to\nmore or less by the two individuals\ninvolved it's not going to work for\neverybody but it can work very very well\nfor certain people like my mentor in\ngrad school he got married for the first\ntime when he was 60 years old he had\ndated many women throughout his lifetime\nbut he never really thought he was going\nto settle down but he did he got married\nto a woman at 60 who lived 2,000 miles\naway in a different state and\nshe had her life and her practice in\nthis state and he had his life and his\npractice in this state and they both\nreally enjoyed what they did and it was\na huge part of their identity and their\nsense of fulfillment with life so\nneither one was really going to give it\nup for the other um and they would spend\ntwo months out of the year one in the\nsummer and one in the winter and the\nrest of the time they were kind of off\ndoing their own things and staying in\nyou know communication to some degree\nand that really worked for the two of\nthem the idea\nthat when couples spend a lot of time\napart or go on separate Vacations or\neven sleep in separate\nbedrooms that that's a sign that there's\nsomething not working in that\nrelationship isn't true it can be true\nbut it isn't like necessarily true and\nI'm guilty of that judgment myself when\nI was younger I heard that some married\ncouples like slept in separate bedrooms\nand I thought what's the point it's like\nclearly the passion and the the love is\ngone why why are they even just it's\nlike no I get it it's like once you\nslept with somebody for 30 years and\nthey snore and you want a good night's\nsleep you're going to sleep over there\nit doesn't mean that you don't love the\nperson or that you're not committed to\nthe relationship it's just that\ndifferent kind of considerations come\ninto play and sometimes that separation\nor the ability to separate is what saves\nmarriages it's keeps people together um\nit also helps keep the passion alive I\ntalk about that in the book as well um\nspace Is Like Oxygen to a fire and we\ncan think of passion or sexual intimacy\nlike a flame you need space in order for\na fire to combust without space it just\nsmothers and smolders right um because\none of the principal mechanisms of sex\nis to join together is to is to\nreunite but you can't reunite with\nsomebody if you never separate with them\nto begin with and separation doesn't\nalways just\nmean uh physical separation because if\nyour phys physically separated but the\nwhole time you're on this magic\nrectangle and you're sending piics and\nyou're giving constant status updates\nand the person knows and can track your\nphysical location at all times it's like\nyou don't actually separate there has to\nbe an\nactual absence of information about\nanother person so that you when you get\ntogether you have a reason to reconnect\nand you have something to talk about so\num longest

that's\nthat's one thing that a woman can do and\nif you think about it that's the legally\nand socially sanctioned place to do that\nso if you're not going to do it there\nreally what are you doing okay that's\nthe best I can do with that\nquestion all right what else do we got\nhere Dr life thank you free donation 35\nmale newly single from toxic BPD X make\naround 250k what area of the country\nwould give me the best chance to find a\npartner in your\nopinion New York City was the easiest\nplace in the world to date but not great\npartner material yeah New York is a\ngreat place to date if you're a single\nman not a great place to enter into\nrelationships as I've said on some of my\nappearances Manhattan was Tinder before\nTinder\nexisted um 250k is a good amount of\nmoney not in the Bay Area maybe not in\nNew York City but in a lot of parts of\nthe\ncountry\num I think that if you want I mean if\nwhat I would\ndo I mean the fact of the matter is that\nthere's good women and there's women\nthat you might want to avoid everywhere\njust like there's good men and there's\nmen you might want to avoid everywhere\num it's hard to say that all the good\nones are in Kentucky and you should just\nstay out of Idaho you know what I'm\nsaying so\num in general if you're single you do\nkind of want to be around a major\nMetropolitan C region that just gives\nyou the optionality cities are great for\nyoung people for two reasons because\nthey're accumulations of of capital of\nmoney and they're accumulations of\npeople so the idea though is to use the\ncity and to not stay in the city longer\nthan you have to use the city to get\nmoney and to find a partner if that's\nwhat you want and then get the out\nof the city because the quality of life\nis not great there and it's extremely\nexpensive\nso take what you want and then leave\nbecause that's generally what people\nmight be looking for anyway like most\npeople want to get out of the situation\nthat they're currently in that's not\nvery uh optimistic but it's true like a\nlot of the girls who are getting all\ndressed up in the 4inch heels and the\ntight dresses to go into the nightclub\nare hoping not all of them but a lot of\nthem are hoping that they're going to\nmeet somebody and they never have to do\nthat again and they can just sit at home\nand watch Netflix with this guy you know\na lot of the women who go to these\nplaces are looking for men to take them\nout of these places okay which is\ngenerally not a good idea but they do\nthat with that intention do you\nunderstand um I would probably where\nwould I go if I were a single person now\nuh at your age I would go maybe\nto an upand cominging small town small\nCity not a small town small City I think\nup and cominging small cities are the\nfuture what we learned during the co\nshutdowns is that a lot of work can be\ndone remotely that we don't need the\nhuge megalopolises anymore with their\ncrime and\ntheir their poor quality of life and\ntheir High living expenses is that we\ncan live in cities of 100,000 to 300,000\npeople which will give you lots of\noptionality which will give you lots of\nvariety which will give you lots of\nculture but isn't overwhelming and\ndisruptive in the ways that major cities\nare so I would look for cities in in\nthat age R uh in that population range\n100 to 300,000 people um I might go to\nlike Scottsdale that's a fun place Boise\nis an interesting place I'm really\ninterested in the Mountain West I think\nthat's going to become more important\nand um interesting in our cultural and\nnation's history moving forward um Salt\nLake City is a cool place it has a bad W\nbecause of the Mormon population there\nbut it's actually one of the most\ndiverse cities in the country probably\nafter like New York LA and Chicago\nbecause the more traveled around the\nworld and brought women back from all\nover and so there's hundreds of\ndifferent cultures in that City it's\nbeautiful right around the\nmountains uh also your money will go\nvery far there and you can kind of live\nlike a king in some of these off-market\ncities um but even there there's going\nto\nbe women you should avoid bad women and\nthere's going to be women that\nyou might want to get into a\nrelationship with and you still have to\nseal the deal like just because they're\nthere doesn't mean it's going to be easy\nto get them either so I it's hard I\nactually gave you some concrete places\nbut I think it's more like\num understanding that you can more or\nless win the game no matter what the\nconditions are you just have to be\nflexible and\nclever okay thank\nyou all right here's another one Ronnie\nweb thanks for your donation dude or uh\nyeah Ronnie question understanding love\nis being humiliated selft triumphant\nwhich implies a sacrifice of self at\nsome level how can a man portray love to\nhis girlfriend wife without losing frame\nor feeling as if the woman is placed on\na\npedestal yeah man I I get it that's\nthat's really hard to do I don't know if\nit's possible I don't know if it's\npossible like one of the things I talk\nabout in the book is that love is very\nunattractive like true Declarations of\nlove where you humble yourself for the\ngood of the\nother those are not very attractive they\ndo not make a woman aroused they don't\nflutter a woman's heart if anything they\ntend to make a woman's heart sink like\nreal life is not like the romantic\ncomedies where if you do the kind of\nthings the protagonists do there women\nare more likely to call the cops than to\nend up in your arms at the end of the\nnight and one of the things I talk about\nat length in the book book is that\nrelationships and love have nothing to\ndo with one another like clearly you can\nlove people you're in relationships with\nbut you're kind of playing two games at\nthe same time and that's one of the\nreasons why love marriages tend to fail\nat such a high rate is because what's\ngood for one game is bad for the other\ngame like they're actually antithetical\nwith each other what am I what do I mean\nthe the Game of Love is really about\nSpiritual Development it's about the\nrendering of the ego to make more space\nfor\ngenerosity\nfor compassion for patience for kindness\nfor\nsacrifice the game of relationships is\nthe transaction of unequal Goods of\ncomparable\nvalue you can't both exchange unequal\nGoods of comparable value while\nsimultaneous sacrificing for the good of\nthe\nother those two games are antithetical\nto each other and so generally what\nhappens is people vacillate back and\nforth in their minds and in their\nhearts sometimes they are playing the\ngame of love and they just feel really\nsafe and satisfied\nabout putting the good of the loved one\nahead of themselves and then the next\nminute they're thinking well could I do\nbetter or are my boundaries being\nviolated or respected you have to\nunderstand that love doesn't think about\nitself it thinks only about the good of\nthe other that's why I really dislike\nthe The Love Languages those aren't Love\nLanguages those are want languages those\nare things that people want and love is\nnot about getting what you want\nrelationships are about getting what you\nwant right that's why relationships have\nthese rules about well I'm gonna give\nyou that I'm gonna give up this to get\nthis in return and we're going to enter\ninto this Arrangement and we're going to\nDefine it we're going to have these\nrules this is in bounds this is out of\nbounds love doesn't give a about\nthat stuff right so the idea here is\ntrying to a love marriage is kind of a\nparadox because you can't win both of\nthose games\nsimultaneously and what I've discovered\nis that it's better as a man in a\nrelationship to win the game or to play\nthe game anyway of the\nrelationship because what I found in my\npersonal experience and in my\nprofessional consultations with clients\nwhen men lean too hard into playing the\ngame of\nLove they often succeed in lowering the\nwoman's\nattraction they put her in the place of\nthe adored which is not generally where\nwomen want to\nbe and it deregulates the relationship\nand they end up losing and disrupting\nthe relationship as a result so at the\nvery best I and I understand this this\nis why I talk about in the book why men\ngenerally have to make a volunt\nsacrifice to be the adorer there is a\nstrong Instinct in men to be romantic\nthere is a strong Instinct in men to to\nbe that generous giver and provider and\nto\njust and to respect and and put the\nwoman on the pedestal and to share and\nshow and express his his love and\ndevotion it just is generally\nantithetical to the success of the\nrelationship in many respects I wish it\nweren't but that's kind of what I found\nto be the case so at the very least uh\nso there's kind of like two ways to\nnavigate that I guess there's probably\nmore but there's two come to my mind the\nfirst way is you find someone to have a\nrelationship with and you find someone\nto love and they're different people and\nthat's frankly been the solution that\nhas existed in many different cultures\nacross space and time it's like you had\nyour wife and you had your mistress and\nyou loved your mistress and you worked\nwith your wife right because it's a\nsmall business um but if you don't want\nto do that for whatever reason which is\nfine\nuh then you have to temper it like you\nyou can't go all the way with that\ndeclaration like you have to you have to\ntreat it like a spice that's you have to\nuse very in in smaller quantities with\ngood discernment because if you use too\nmuch of it it's going to overpower the\nrest of the food which is actually\nwhat's nourishing for the relationship\nthe love is not nourishing for the\nrelationship it's the other stuff that's\nnourishing for the relationship the\nvalue that's being transacted\nthat's what I got for\nyou\nokay adalo hope I said that right thanks\nfor your\ndonation how do men reconcile the fact\nthat their female partner seems to have\noutgroup\npreferences in other words they tout the\nvirtues of multiculturalism queer\nLifestyles third world nobility\nEtc I'm I'm kind of unfamiliar with the\nterm group preferences in this context\nbut I guess what I'm getting at is your\nwoman is kind of woke that that's kind\nof what I'm picking up here in that they\ntalk about diversity and\nmulticulturalism and LGBT and stuff like\nthat okay\num okay so that's what she chooses to\nbelieve like I don't think that it's\nimpossible to have a relationship even a\nsatisfying relationship with somebody\nwho has radically different cultural or\npolitical beliefs it's harder\num because both people have to actively\nexercise tolerance in a way that they\nmight not have to if they were aligned\nculturally and\npolitically but it can potentially be a\nricher relationship it's just going to\nrequire more work like I wouldn't argue\nwith her about her beliefs as I've said\nbefore it's it's it's stupid to argue\nwith a woman about anything because you\ncan't\nwin um even if you start to fight you\nlose lose even if you defeat every\nsingle one of her points with reason and\nlogic because\nthat's that's often when when women are\nbacked into a corner men can do this too\nbut when women are backed into a corner\nthey start to\nflail and they go for emotional damage\nlike they're not I I found it that it's\nmore difficult for them to kind of stay\non a topic and to debate the issue as it\nwere so I wouldn't try change your mind\nuh if you really want to have a\nrelationship with this woman part of\nloving is accepting the other person for\nwho he or she is because wanting them to\nbe different or other than they are is\nactually a subtle form of disrespect\neven if what you think they could be\ncapable of is objectively better\nwhatever that means it's still somewhat\ndisrespectful it's basically saying how\nyou are is not good enough or how you\nare is wrong and it would be better if\nyou were right and I have the idea of\nwhat's right okay so I think that's kind\nof a dangerous road to go down at least\nin terms of relationships because it\ndoesn't lead to more satisfying and\nharmonious relations with anybody\nso I think it's people are free to\nbelieve whatever they want to believe\nand have their values and to have their\nfaith and to have their cultures and\nideologies that's that's fine I'm I love\ndiversity I like that there's lots of\ndifferent kinds of people in the world I\nwouldn't want to have a relationship\nwith a lot of those people\nbut that's okay I don't need to so one\nof the things that I often counsel is\nlike be honest with yourself if for\nwhatever you don't you don't have to\nbeat yourself up you're not a bad person\nwe all have our preferences and we all\nhave our our tastes as it were if\nwhatever reason you feel like you can't\nreally accept your partner for who he or\nshe\nis maybe don't try to have that kind of\nrelationship with them you could have\nsomething potentially more casual but uh\nit it would be very difficult I would\nthink if not but not impossible to have\na more satisfying harmonious long-term\nrelationship so um that's kind of what I\nhave about\nthat\nokay high quality Leisure thank you for\nthe donation big fan of the channel 35m\nhere in dead bedroom with 35f that\ndoesn't sound fun I would love to work\nthings out but I don't know if there is\nhope it's tough I don't know how long\nit's been dead but um it can be very\ndifficult to resuscitate a Mor abund\nbuis it's not impossible uh and I did an\nepisode about that how to bring sex back\ninto a relationship it can take a while\nlike if you've gone years without sex it\ncould take months to begin to pump Vigor\nand life back into that dimension of\nyour relationship but it's not\nimpossible also dealing with guilt over\nleaving her\nafter wasting her prime years we go back\nand forth on kids but yeah uh I hear\nwhat you're saying man let's talk about\nthis I made an episode uh a while back\ncalled I don't want to waste my time\nwhich is something that uh I've heard\nfrom women and a lot of guys hear from\nwomen and I get where it's coming from I\ndon't think that men should actively\nmislead the women that they are in\nrelationships with they shouldn't flat\nout lie and de deceive them about\nwanting to have kids if they know for\nsure that they are never going to want\nto\nreproduce like that's I can't get behind\nthat but it's also technically not your\nresponsibility to protect other people\nfrom wasting their time it's my job to\nnot waste my time and it's your job to\nnot waste your time like there are 600\npeople in this live chat if I were just\nto get on to camera and for the last 15\nminut 50 minutes I just read the phone\nbook in a boring monotone\nvoice I still couldn't have wasted your\ntime you chose to waste the time by\nsigning in and staying through the\nentire 50 minutes like why why did you\nafter a minute or two or that why didn't\nyou say this is this is I'm out\nof here so like I couldn't waste your\ntime even if I tried like it would be on\nyou to stay in an\nunsatisfying\nsituation when you had other better\nthings to do like go do them\nright so it's not I understand where\nthat guilt is coming from and sometimes\nthat's put on the man by society and by\nthe woman in question but it's actually\nnot true you can't waste somebody else's\ntime even if you want to it's their\ndecision to spend their time however\nthey want to spend it and there's\nanother thing to consider which\nis and I talk about this in the book is\nlike the goal of many women in dating is\nto end up in marriage\ninto that kind of long-term\nrelationship but not all women are going\nto get\nthere in a professional context it's a\ngoal of many people to become the\nCEO not all employees are going to end\nup in the C Suite most employees are not\ngoing to end up in the SE\nSuite but that's\nokay it's okay because they weren't\nhired for that job one and two they\nreceived a paycheck every two weeks and\nthey accepted that job that they were\nhired for most likely because of all\ntheir available options that was the\nbest job that they could get they didn't\nforgo a better job for a worse\none if there was a better job they would\nbe there working at that position trying\nto get into the sea suite at that\ncompany do you understand so you don't\nnecessarily need to feel so bad because\nif she had a better option she would be\nwith that dude you were her best option\nand she stayed with you because of what\nyou were able to provide for her over\nthat time like the hope of a future gain\nwill keep people hanging on it's\ncertainly true but that's not nearly as\npowerful as the reality of value\nprovided\nlike people will will work for a long\ntime if they think they might hit the\njackpot like that's kind of how startups\nare are structured you work like a slave\nfor a year or two because you hope that\nyou're going to get this you know\nbillion dollar payoff that's going to\ntake you to the moon but people can't do\nthat indefinitely like no one's going to\nwork 20 years\nunpaid for the possibility that maybe\nthere's a one in 10 shot that they're\ngoing to get a seven figureure buyout so\nhope is a powerful motivator but it's\nnot nearly as powerful as actual value\nprovided and she wouldn't have chosen\nyou if she had a better option and she\nwouldn't have stayed with you if you\nweren't providing value throughout that\ntime so hopefully that helps to resolve\nyour guilt about the situation of course\nif you and I'm assuming that you didn't\nexplicitly lead her on and say that you\ndid want kids and that you were going to\nmarry her because like don't do that I I\nwouldn't recommend doing that but I\ndon't know what the situation is that's\nwhat I got for\nyou okay next question Voodoo 2130\nthanks for your donation hi Dr terban\nwhat are your thoughts on B's attachment\nStyles and romantic relationships and\nhow can couples address each other's\nattachment style without much conflict\nthat's a great question so attachment\nstyles are a real\nthing like they have been very\nthoroughly researched and there is a\nrobust evidence Bas to support their\nexistence that said I do think that they\nhave been widely overgeneralized in the\npopular\nimagination one thing you have to keep\nin mind is that the original experiments\non attachment were done on infants they\nwere done on one-year-olds in a very\ncontrolled laboratory environment called\nThe Strange experiment which had to do\nwith infants reactions to their mother\ndisappearing and then reemerging\nsometimes later and the researchers kind\nof categorize these infants into three\nor four different camps and that's where\nattachment Styles come from now\nobviously things that happen in our past\nand especially at certain parts of our\nchildhood can impact our future and our\nadult\nlives but it's also true that we're not\ninfants anymore and that people can and\ndo change and mature and develop so\ndef it's kind of like there's this\nphrase that I love from Marshall linan\nthe creator of dialectical behavior\ntherapy who's dealing often with\npersonality disorders and really high\ndysfunction individuals she has this\nthing this great line which is it's not\nyour fault but it is your\nresponsibility it's like it's not your\nfault what happened to you when you were\na kid maybe you had neglectful parents\nmaybe you had abusive parents maybe had\nconflict parents maybe you're raised by\na single mother single father you were\neven past around the child welfare\nsystem who the who knows like kids can\ngo through all kinds of stuff that they\njust in the vast majority of cases did\nnothing to deserve like and often bad\nthings happen to kids and they really\ncan't do anything about it because\nthey're young they're inept and they're\npowerless and and then they grow up and\nat least for a while into adolescence\nand young adulthood they're they're\ngenerally still acting out from that\nwhat like was done to\nthem however it's one thing to be like a\n20-some blaming your parents and it's\nanother thing to be a 60-some blaming\nyour parents like your parents might be\ndead they might have been dead decades\nago and you're still blaming the parents\nfor something they did or didn't do 50\nyears ago it it becomes less it's easy\nit's harder to sympathize with and it\nbecomes increasingly pathetic and the\nidea that some of these things are not\nlike carved in\nstone like somebody who's anxious\ninsecure will probably never be all the\nway on the other side of the spectrum\nbut it is a spectrum and they're not\nlike rigidly here and there's like\nnothing you can do about\nit um people can heal their attachment\ninj injuries and their emotional wounds\nthat give rise to their attachment\nStyles and that's kind of their\nresponsibility you know think about it\nthis way sometimes I do consultations\nwith guys and they're dating a girl and\nthe girl says something like oh you know\nI kind of have trust issues because my\nex-boyfriend cheated on\nme on some like what what is that to\nthat guy that guy hasn't done anything\nwrong so what I usually counsel those\nmen to say is like hey I totally\nunderstand it sucks being cheated on um\nbut what are you doing about it and\nshe's like huh it's like well this is a\nproblem for you right like your your\ndifficulty trusting people is a problem\nfor you right and if it's a problem you\nshould be actively working to resolve\nthat problem or were you just expecting\nthat I was is going to just like\naccommodate this this thing that\nhappened to you and you're absolved of\nany kind of responsibility for for\ngrowing and healing like that's not the\nbasis of any kind of mature and Lasting\nrelationship so people have attachment\nStyles because of things that have\nhappened to them when they were children\nbut once they get to be adults and they\nhave more\nagency they can begin the healing\nprocess and they don't have to like just\nbe the victim of what was done to them\nwhen they were a child now some of this\nstuff is really deep especially that\nhappened preverbal which is in the first\nlet's say one year of\nlife that's the hardest thing to\nfix um but regardless of how difficult\nsomething is people can generally heal\nmore than they currently are and improve\nin the direction of where they want to\ngo even if they can't get there 100%\nwhich is possible like a scar never\nreally heals back to the way it was\nbefore the wound but it shouldn't be\noozing and\neither so um something to keep in mind\nit's useful for attachment stells are\nalso useful for like\nselection like I was I was definitely on\nthe uh avoidant side of things\npretty pretty uh solidly avoidant and\nthrough a lot of work and inside effort\nI I'm pretty much like on the secure\navoidant boundary so I know from\npersonal experience that this is\nsomething that can\nfluctuate um but that generally means\nthat I probably require more space than\nother people I'm probably not going to\nbe as emotionally effusive as other\npeople\num things like that and I I'm now you\nknow in my 40s it's like those things\nhave changed to the degree that they can\nchange and they're probably going to\nchange much further at this point\nbecause of all the the effort and\nattention I've already paid to this so\nit's also now like this is who I am I've\ndone what I could to like heal as best\nas I can and to work more into the realm\nof secure attachment um I'm here I'm not\ngonna be over here you know um I'm not\ngonna be over here and if that works for\nyou great and if that doesn't work for\nyou it just seems like it's a bad match\nand this should be something that Pro\nyou don't really need to talk about it\nwith your mouth it's something that you\njust sort of sus out in the early stages\nof your courtship and that's why it's\nreally important to keep a rain on your\nemotional investment in the early stage\nof a relationship because you don't\nreally know if this person is compatible\nfor you with the kind of relationship\nthat you would\nprefer um the basis of appropriate\nselection is accurate self- knowledge is\nyou got to really know who you are not\nwho you want to be not you think you are\nnot who you think you should be but who\nyou really are and when you do that it's\neasier to make better\ndecisions okay what else we got\nhere um let's go\nbackwards okay okay I think that's all\nthe I think that's all the the paid\nones I can't get rid of this now hold on\na second\nokay I get\nit I can't get rid of this\nokay sorry I deleted something there we\ngo just trying to get it out of the way\num all right let's do a few more\nquestions Talking for an hour I don't\nwant to bore anybody\num oh here's here's one that came up ARS\nwhat's that is that is that Argentine I\nmean 500 sounds really big but I don't\nknow what currency I'm dealing with here\nanyway thank you for your donation uh\nhistor all something or\nother it says what to do about her\npossible elha widows do I do nothing\nabout it do I ask her about her their\npast lovers do I ask her how their past\nlovers were to know that I have to be\nbetter than who the other is and so I\ncan see if it is worth the effort she is\n20 I'm 22 okay\nokay it's good question now we're\ngetting into the realm of sexual\njealousy in\ngeneral nothing good comes out of\nexamining a woman's sexual\npast I'm just gonna put it out\nthere because there's not going to be\nany information there that's going to\nreassure you for all time it's one of\nthe real problems about snooping which\npeople will do and kinds of different\nways is there's not going to be like\nyou're not going to find a text that\nsays oh now he's definitely not cheating\nand I I don't have to worry about this\nanymore there's only evidence that is\neither very clear positive evidence or\ncan be misinterpreted as positive\nevidence there's just the best you can\nhope for is the absence of that which\ndoesn't prove that something isn't\nhappening right because the presence of\nan absence is\nnot is not evidence of an absence I\nthink I got that right okay so I would\nnot go um asking about that even if she\nhad only one prior partner that person\ncould come to occupy your fantasy in a\nmalicious way and I don't think that's\ngoing to be good for your um\nrelationship uh you'll know how good you\nare relative to her past lovers by the\nway that she treat you so you don't\nreally need to know the details the\ndetails could be misleading because she\ncould just lie I mean most women have\nlearned not to tell men the truth about\nthat question that's why women have all\nkinds of strange ways of counting uh\nwith respect to their body counts and\ntheir hooking up Etc because they've\nlearned that men don't really take that\ninformation\nobjectively for better for worse\num so rather than go seek\nwords or reassurance from her mouth like\nseek it in her behavior a woman who sees\nyou as her best option will treat you\nvery well that's that's just how it is\num especially if she's had at least some\nexperience on The Dating Market the\nmetaphor that I use\nis almost everybody starts out in the\nprofessional Arena working jobs you\nwork as an intern the pay sucks you're\nat the bottom of the status hierarchy\nyou're often the first ones let go when\nthings go wrong you don't have any power\nand you do all the jobs no one else\nwants to do okay and generally you have\na few experiences of that when you start\nout working now if you eventually get a\njob that's very high paying and has\ngreat benefits and is satisfying and you\nhave real influence in the\ncompany especially in the context of\nwhat you know is out there and how rare\nthis particular role might be in the job\nmarket you're not going to do anything\nto rock that vat inappropriately unless\nyou're actually crazy which you\nknow some people are uh but most people\naren't so most people know what side\ntheir bread is buttered on so you can\nlearn whether you are a woman's best in\nthe context of her previous Lovers by\nthe way she treats you and that's a more\nreliable answer than anything she's\ngoing to say with her mouth through her\ndirect questioning like guys and women\nhave to get better at getting the\nanswers to the questions they need\nthrough detective work the idea that you\ncan just ask a question and Trust the\nanswer is it's\nstupid I mean the question are you\ntrustworthy both the trustworthy person\nand the untrustworthy person are going\nto say yes why did you even bother\nasking that question it's going to lead\nyou to this false sense of re of\nconfidence and reassurance in your\nassessment which is why companies\ngenerally don't just do structured\ninterviews they they do here's a problem\nhere's a creative lateral task they\nobserve you in Social contexts they\nreach out to people who know you for\nindirect validation it's like they they\ndo all kinds of things besides dealing\nwith the applicant directly in that very\nexplicit um interview so learn to get\nthe information that you want through\nobservation and through indirect means\nthat's generally a more reliable\nway okay\nJames Francis thank you for your\ndonation favorite YouTube channel you've\nreferenced Patrice O'Neal a lot in your\ndiscussions on meeting and dating yeah\nhe was great wasn't he what in\nparticular do you think he got wrong in\nthis regard if\nanything\nH uh you know I I can't say that I've\nconsumed patrice's entire o you know uh\nI've seen a few of his standups I've\nlistened to a few of his um r\nshows he was great his radio shows were\ngreat too because he could really\nuncensor himself in a way that he\nprobably couldn't do for the HBO Comedy\nspecials what do I think he got\nwrong um the\none and I don't even know if it's wrong\nyou know it's very hard for me to talk\nabout another person's relationship\nbecause it's it's really between those\nthe individuals involved but I do\nremember one time he kind of\nit seemed like he caved in a sense he\nhas this great line where someone asked\nhim about his relationship and he said\nsomething like you know my girl's been\nwith me for seven years and I've been\nwith her for three kind of a thing\num which I I thought was was true and\nmade a lot of sense to me but I think\nthat he eventually got to the point\nwhere he did give up the other girls and\nhe did ex commit monogamously to the\nwoman that he was dating\nand I don't think he which might be the\nright decision but when he talked about\nit he didn't seem happy about it he\nseemed kind of downfallen crestfallen\ndowntrodden about it and he acknowledged\nthat it wasn't good for him but it was\ngood for her and he so he kind of got\ninto that adorer phase and he was\nputting the woman's um best interest\nahead of himself his his own best\ninterest potentially um not always a\nproblem like some men do thrive in the\nAdor role and some women do thrive in\nthe adored every relationship is\ndifferent but the point I'm so it's not\nso much what he did it's the fact that\nhe didn't seems very enthusiastic about\ndoing it which seemed so different from\na lot of what he talked about where he\nwould kind\nof he wouldn't hide I think that was one\nof the the titles of one of his comedy\nspecials is never hide and you know he\nwas he was selfish about what he wanted\nand he wasn't and and he was okay with\nthat that and and I thought that that\nwas um that was kind of right and if he\nwanted to make a sacrifice of certain\nthings and enter into a committed\nrelationship with a woman I I get this I\nwould have wanted to get the sense that\nhe was more enthusiastic about doing so\nand it kind of just felt like it was a\ndefeat for him but a necessary defeat to\nkeep the woman that he loved I don't\nknow if it was the right thing to do but\nthat's the only thing that comes to\nmind\nokay prr thank you for all your help\nyou're welcome thank you for being\nhere\num only four Cuban links thank you for\nyour donation in marriage counseling and\nhonesty do not agree with a lot of\nopinions okay now our home environment\nis well this is what was said in\ncounseling so do this why is marriage\ncounseling more female based well\nCounseling in general is female based\n85% of mental health workers are women\nwhen I was in grad school I was one of\nlike three men in my\ncohort uh women also constitute the\nmajority of uh therapeutic they buy the\nmajority of therapeutic services they're\nmore likely to go into therapy and\nthey're also more likely to buy like\ntherapy ancillary things like self-help\nbooks and development\nseminars uh and a lot of those things\nare businesses and businesses always\nhave to maintain some level of\nmarketing they have to cater to their\ncustomers and if most of your customers\nare women then over time the service\nthat you provide will be catered more\nand more towards women I think that's\none of the\nsimplest most objective Arguments for\nwhat often goes on in couples's\ncounseling this therapy in general is is\na very feminized profession right\num and I've talked about why couples\ntherapy generally doesn't work\nbecause the client in couples's therapy\nat least ideally is the relationship and\nnot the individuals involved and it\ncould very well be the best thing for\nthe individuals involved to and the\nrelationship but you can't you're not\nsupposed to really talk like that as a\ncoup's therapist it's like you're a\ndoctor in the absence of a DNR you have\nto keep that patient Alive by any means\nnecessary even if it's expensive even if\nit's painful even if it's in the best\ninterest of everyone to just sort of\naccept reality and to gently let go\nthat's what I got for you there's a\nbunch of questions they already kind of\ngoing long so I want to get to some of\nthese shorter answers now James Hughes\nthank you for donation boatless Captain\nhere and you're not a captain how can I\nattract passengers when I haven't\ndeveloped my boat yet how should I apply\nthe game and please no thanks for your\nwork okay so sorry to be flipping but if\nyou don't have a vote you're not a\ncaptain like the fundamental even even\nhaving a boat doesn't make you a captain\nbut you absolutely can't be a captain\nwithout a boat and that's what I talk\nabout is being a captain takes a very\nvery long time there's no shame in not\nbeing a captain I get the sense that you\nmight be a young\nman very few if any young men are\ncaptains okay um and it can take about\n10 years as I say in the book to ascend\nto your\ncaptaincy but um if you can't attract\npassengers to your boat if you don't\nhave a boat yet like you're asking your\npassengers to be psychotic or to not\nreally abide in reality so I would focus\non building that boat which in my\nmetaphor is the development of an\nemotionally compelling lifestyle and\nthen you have something to invite\npassengers onto and into which is your\nrelationship frame so um find you know\nplay to your strengths what are your\ntalents what are your unique abilities\nwhat are your interests where can you\nmake money where can you shine like find\nthe contexts in which you can stand out\nbecause as I've said most men are\nwallpaper and assiduously and\nconsistently work towards the\ndevelopment of that boat once you have\nthe boat you can do some other things\num that it's one of the hardest parts\nbut just having a boat doesn't even make\nyou a captain right it just makes you a\nboat\nowner um how should I play the game of\nplease no um well you can't avoid it\nit's like you don't have to do anything\nto apply it you're already doing it uh\nwhether you're aware of it or not every\ninteraction in the sexual\nMarketplace is more or less a game of\nplease no hey do you want to date hey\nyou want to go back to my place hey you\nwant to drink hey you want to get\nmarried it's like most of relationships\nare negotiation and that negotiation has\nto be\ncompleted subtly and indirectly because\nas we started this talk by discussing\none of the relationship rules is you\ncan't be too explicit about the\nnegotiation you can't just say hey you\nknow I make this amount of money uh I\nwill protect and provide for you you can\nget a car and in return I want two kids\nsexual Fidelity and the ability to kind\nof have every other Sunday off\nlike it could be possible to broker\nrelationships like this that's more or\nless how arranged marriages work it's\nlike marriages were were not arranged\nover years there wasn't the ye years of\ncourtship and getting to know each other\nand uh analysis and matchmaking it was\nlike okay it's time for this person to\nget married what are some of the\navailable candidates let's look and then\nlike in a month or two you know you\ngenerally match and you move on with the\nbusiness of what the relationship is\nsupposed to accomplish right um but\nthat's not the world that we're living\nin that would feel too mercenary it\nwould feel too\ntransactive in today's day and age so\nthat's why everything takes longer\nbecause we can't be direct about it and\nso those who thrive in the game of\nplease no in today's day and age are\nthose who can Thrive through indirect\nmeanss through subtlety through\nemotional\nmanipulation um in the absence of\nexplicit direct transparent negotiation\nyou have to go through these indirect\nsubtle and and more covert in emotional\nmeans so uh you're already doing the\ngame of please no uh this is how and you\ncan learn to get better at\nit Beauty hack thank you for your\ndonation very generous thank you okay uh\nxad Trader thank you for your donation\nwould you recommend an East\nAsian uh okay I I assume you're saying\nyou're a 40-year-old incel situation not\npolitical in Canada to upro to a\npassport bro life I'm just looking for a\nloving wife to raise a family priority\nwellbeing and generational no hope here\never thank\nyou\nuh okay you're in Canada Canada is like\nAmerica and a lot of the West it's\num yeah I mean I don't like I said\nearlier there are good women everywhere\nyou could find a woman in a good woman\nin New York City in LA in Toronto they\nexist but they're harder to find because\nthere's a lot of chaff surrounding that\nwheat let put it that way but that's not\ntrue in other places like a I know men\nwho are successful surgeons in Manhattan\nwho on Friday when they get off work get\non a plane and fly down to\nColumbia to meet women on a different\ncontinent because it's easier for them\nto do so in South America than in\nGreenwich\nVillage\nso people have different tastes in women\npeople have different types they have\ndifferent things they're looking for in\nrelationships and fortunately we have\ndiversity yeah this is one thing that\ndiversity is great and there's still\nparts of the world where there are\ndifferent Traditions there are different\ncultures and a lot of the rules that\ngovern the way that men and women\ninteract with each other and relate to\neach other are cultural and so there are\nabsolutely other cultures with different\nrules that might make it easier to find\nwhat you're looking for\nand on some level you got to go where\nthose women are like if you're that's\nwhy so many people for so many\ngenerations have come to America from\nall parts of the world because this is\nwhere the money is like if you want\nmoney you've got to go where the money\nis you can't expect to just make your\nliving in some you know kicker town\nwhere nothing is going on and there's no\njobs there's no employment you know For\nBetter or For Worse you might have to\nget off your ass and\nmove sometimes a far distance to go\nwhere the jobs are to go where the money\nis so if you want certain kind of women\nyou have to go where those women are you\nhave to be willing to do that and if\nyou're not willing to do that then maybe\nyou don't want it as much like there's\nsome sort of sacrifice you have to go\nwhere the fish are biting and different\nfish bite in different locations so if\nyou haven't traveled get out there man\nit's a it's a really interesting world\nthere's lots of beautiful women from all\nkinds of different walks of life and um\nI do think it's possible to have\nsatisfying harmonious relationships with\na lot of different women um if you know\nhow to love well like that's really\nhelpful um the better you are as a\npartner the easier it is to have\nsatisfying relationships with a woman if\nyou're peaceful she it's easier for her\nto be your peace right don't look for it\noutside of\nyourself okay we'll do a few more James\nFrancis thank you for your donation\nyou've said that in the past you've\nrejected women who you might have had\nsatisfying relationship with on a\nrelevant\nbasis yes I have okay I think I know\nwhat you're talking about what are the\nbasic minimum qualities one should seek\nin a long-term partner okay I actually\nhave an episode coming out about this\nI've just recorded it but it hasn't been\npublished yet when I talk about this\nInsight I have rejected women in the\npast based on\nIrrelevant in my opinion irrelevant\nqualities and it kind of goes like this\num when I was younger I thought I wanted\nto meet my equal I wanted to meet\nsomebody who could kind of like meet me\nwhere I was at because it felt like that\nwas the promise of romantic\nrelationships and so I thought well what\nare the things that I like I like\nquantum mechanics I like spiritual\ndiscipline I like backpacking in the\nwilderness I like Shakespearean\nliterature I like young Yan de\npsychology etc etc so I was like I want\na woman who is interested in those\nthings and can discuss discuss those\ntopics on my level who's willing to go\nout into the wilderness for a week or\ntwo at a time and to keep up with me and\nwho\ncan read trist and cresa and be able to\ndiscuss the intersexual implications or\nwhatever the it was at the time and\num this was as you might expect\ndramatically limiting my pool of\napplicants for the role of girlfriend\nlike it was very hard to find a woman\nthat I was attracted to who was\ninterested in even one of those things\nlet alone several of those things and so\nhere I was I was complaining that there\nwas no good woman I couldn't find any\nwomen to have relationships with when my\nstandards were just insanely High and\nthe fact of the matter is is that you\ndon't need to be interested or able to\ndiscuss Shakespeare to be a really good\npartner and I brought this to a mentor\nand he kind of shook me up and I talk\nabout that more in the episode and one\nof the things I realized the consequence\nof this\nconversation um I kind of made a\ncommitment to myself and the commitment\nwas if I could get a need met in any\nother relationship on the planet besides\na sexual relationship with a woman I\nwould get that need met\nelsewhere like I would only bring to a\nwoman the things that I could not or\nwould not get in any other kind of\nrelationship with any other person on\nthe\nplanet and this dramatically simplified\nwhat I was looking for for a woman to\njust like three or four things which I\ntalk about in that\nepisode and it's so much easier to\nsatisfy three or four criteria than 30\nor 40 criter criteria and some people\nhave that many conscious criteria and\nwho knows they might have 400\nunconscious criteria it's like people\nhave are very demanding and picky about\nwho they want to mate and date with\nwhich is of course their right but as I\nsay and is expensive every time you want\none more thing I want this and this and\nthis from a statistical standpoint\nyou're reducing the probability that all\nof those will be satisfied\nand you might just price yourself out of\nthe market or you're basically saying\nthe odds of you meeting that person are\nsix billion to\none what are the basic minimum qualities\nthat one should seek in a long-term\npartner well I talk about this a little\nbit in the channel um the things that\nyou yet you might like when you examine\nthe the things that you can get from a\nwoman that you couldn't or wouldn't get\nelsewhere your list might be different\nfrom my list there's probably some\noverlap but there's probably some\npersonal differences there but there's\none thing that I think is um basic and\nminimum and nonnegotiable which is that\nto have a satisfying harmonious\nlong-term\nrelationship the two people but we're\ntalking about a woman here um they have\nto be\ninoffensive I've talked on the channel\nabout how disrespect is the unbreakable\nrule for women but that's just one way\nthat a woman can be\noffensive a woman is offensive when\nshe's disrespectful obviously but she's\nalso dis um offensive when she's nagging\nwhen she's complaining when she is\nemotionally disequil too often when she\nis clingy when she is jealous or envious\nwhen she's critical and judgmental it's\nlike these women might actually provide\na great deal of value positively in\ntheir relationships but the issue is\nthat these negative quantities they they\ncorrupt they like negate they invalidate\nall the positives that they might that\nthe man might be getting from them in\nthat relationship which isn't going to\nmake the woman feel good because she's\ngoing to be like look at all the things\nthat I do but she's also doing these\nother things that kind of cancel out the\nsatisfaction that the man might derive\nfrom the good things like what's the\npoint of getting these good things if\nthese bad things cancel each other\ncancel out the good things like that's\na you know that's a break even or even a\nnet loss it's probably a net loss\nbecause negative things tend to be more\nnegative than positive things are\npositive like the the best in the sense\nof like the longest lasting the most\nsatisfying and fulfilling relationships\nthat I've had in my life were not with\nthe hottest women they were not with the\nsmartest women they were not with like\nthe most accomplished women or the most\ntalented women they weren't with like\nsuperlative women they were with except\nfor like they were the most inoffensive\nlike there was there was nothing bad\nabout the dynamic between the two of us\nit was it was like clean and that\nallowed the positives that I did receive\nto just shine through all the more\nclearly um and made it easier to focus\non it's generally the the things that\nyou don't like that that end a\nrelationship as opposed to not getting\nenough of what you\ndo okay um I think we already had a\nquestion from you let's see a7x what is\ndating like for you now considering\ntheir smv is probably the highest it's\never been um well I did make an episode\na while back called being famous is like\nbeing a woman and I'm only like a little\nfamous you know I'm YouTube\nfamous uh which is kind of a weird thing\na weird kind of thing because some\npeople like recognize you but you're\nalso can be invisible to the vast\nmajority of people who never use YouTube\nright um but I will say that\nlike women really do make an effort with\nthe men that they are very attracted\nto I mean it's not uncommon for me to\nget a couple marriage proposals a week\nfor instance and I assume that they're\nfairly\nauthentic um and women reach out to me\nall the time through various messages\nto try to make something happen and this\nis very different than the standard\nsituation for myself and for the vast\nmajority of guys out there where you\nhave to approach the woman and you have\nto kind of pick her up or you have to\nRIS her up and make make it happen you\nknow what I'm saying it's like when and\nand and these women don't know really\nanything about me they feel like they\nknow things about me because maybe\nthey've watched hundreds of hours of my\ncontent online but they don't they don't\nknow anything about me besides what they\nsee on the screen right and so they have\nthis idea they have this fantasy of me\nthat is very very attractive to them and\nthat high level of attraction overcomes\ntheir privileged position of waiting for\nthe offer and they will actively try to\nmake something happen and so that's\nthat's probably been the most\num obvious change since I've um since\nI've become a little famous is that uh\nwomen really do make a more obvious and\neffortful uh\neffort okay we'll do two more\nJames what do you suggest for men who\nfeel emotionally numb or numb to the\npoint where the only feeling left is\nanger\nyeah I think CS Lewis who was a pretty\nsmart guy said something like\nI sat with my anger long\nenough that I eventually learned that\nits real name was\ngrief and that feels really right to me\nI think that behind a lot\nof male anger is\ngrief it's hard to be a\nman and we're not allowed to talk about\nthat and you don't get any sympathy for\nit anyway if you're fool hearty enough\nto talk about it most men are\nscarred um they're scarred by men and\nthey're scarred by women both physically\nand\nemotionally\nand they're subject to experiencing a\ngreat deal of pain and sometimes it can\nfeel like the only way to escape feeling\nthe pain is to cut off the ability to\nfeel\nanything and really that should only be\ndone as a last resort but I will I won't\nI'll say that there's a time and a place\nto do that it's like sometimes you got\nto amputate a limb to save the person\nI mean there's always kind of like this\nmurky Gray Zone when it comes to\nBattlefield medicine and maybe cutting\nout the emotional capacity was what\nsaved a man's life but maybe that was\nalso temporary because what we're really\ntalking we're not talking about a\nphysical organ or a limb we're talking\nabout like a\nsensibility and for most men that\nsensibility isn't like amputated it's\nmore Ines ized and it's anesthetized\nwith alcohol it's anesthetized with porn\nit's anesthetized with video games and\nweed it's anesthetized with streaming\nservices etc\netc\nand what can happen when a when a guy\nmakes the decision to stop\nanesthetizing is the pain comes back\nnow this isn't this isn't going to sound\nvery scientific but one of my kind of\npet theories is that the feeling of an\nemotion is that emotion leaving you like\nwe say in therapy you have to feel it to\nheal it it's almost like you're vomiting\nit up when you vomit something up it's\nkind of gross but you taste it again you\nknow what I'm saying it's like when you\nfeel it that's the emotion leaving and\nuntil you feel it it doesn't leave it\nstays inside of you like as trust me\nI've tried every which way to try to\navoid feeling certain feelings and\nnothing gets rid of them the the only\nthing that I know to get rid of certain\nfeelings is to feel them the problem is\nif you anesthetize yourself for years or\nmaybe even decades you might have\n years or decades worth of\nfeelings to\nfeel and when it starts to come out it's\ngoing to feel absolutely potentially\noverwhelming like there's just so much\nyou have an emotional debt you have a\n40-year emotional debt some guys do how\ndo you begin paying off 40 Years of\ncredit card debt it's like It seems\nimpossible in the beginning it is\npossible but it's like it's not going to\nhappen overnight\nright so the way to do that is is to\npull back on some of the\nanesthetizing activities and to begin to\nfeel some of those emotions and then\nwhen when you when you're feeling\noverwhelmed you can reapply the the\nanesthesia if you need to or do\nsomething else like you're not going to\nbe able to get through everything in any\nin like one sitting it's not like in the\nmovies where you have one good therapy\nsession you have a breakthrough and then\nthat's it so you might have to like open\nit up and then close it open it up and\nthen close it and do that a lot of times\nto kind of eventually get things out um\nand eventually it does get out like\neventually you do get out of debt that\nemotional debt and you're kind of like\nup to the present moment in terms of\nyour\nsensitivity and that's a great thing\nlike it's actually a really good thing\nto have emotions it's not a good thing\nto have emotions if all you feel is pain\nbut maybe that's because you're in a\npainful environment that you couldn't do\nanything about but now you're\nolder now you're you have more agency\nhopefully you have more resources and\nthere's some things that you can do\nabout that you don't have to abide in\npainful environments anymore you can\ntake yourself out of that and then you\ncan work to let go of some of the stuff\nthat you are holding on to good question\nokay one more and then we'll call it a\nnight okay\nokay let's go with this one Drew liamson\nthank you for your\ndonation how do you choose whom to\nlove can you unconditionally love two\nwomen at the same time sure and are\nthere are circumstances in which\nunconditional love should end well\nno because then it would be conditional\nlove right unconditional love is really\num it's a beautiful thing but it's a\ndangerous thing uh um Love is a choice\nit's otherwise like how could Jesus say\nlove your\nenemies like who would organically feel\naffection for people who are trying to\nkill you like only crazy people would\nfeel that and I don't think Jesus was\nnuts you know what I mean so what he's\ngetting at I think is that love is\nsomething that you can intentionally\npractice and you can practice it with\nanybody even people who hate you you\neven people who want nothing to do with\nyou which is also a couple clues that\nlove isn't really a positive emotion\nlike it doesn't feel warm and\nfuzzy and you don't need a relationship\nto love because you might have to love\npeople who want nothing to do with you\nbeyond your destruction right that's the\ninjunction of that commandment to love\nyour\nenemies so you can choose to love and\nlove is something that you can access to\ngreater and greater capacity the more\nthat you love the more that you practice\nand like I said you can practice\nsacrifice self-sacrifice you can\npractice egolessness you can practice\nputting other people first you can\npractice forgiveness you can practice\nkindness you can practice compassion and\nthe more that you practice those things\nand the more that you put the good of\nthe other ahead of yourself the more\nthat you love the more you are love\nright and you chose to love whoever you\nchose to love not because they were\nworthy of it who's worthy of that you\nknow what I'm saying uh but because it\nwas your pleasure to do it as a lover\nthey they couldn't earn your love just\nlike they couldn't earn your friendship\nright they people people decided to be\nyour friend because they wanted to be\nyour friend it's not like you had to\nprove it to them first and was like oh\nokay because you did this I'll be your\nfriend right that doesn't feel like a\nfriend right so you chose to love who\nyou chose to love and they did nothing\nto earn that which also means that they\ncan do nothing\nto unar\nit which is what makes love very\ndangerous right if you if you love your\nenemies if you if you're supposed to\nanyway\nand love is\nabout putting the good of the other\nahead of yourself it's not about\nboundaries like you can be in a\nsituation where all you do is give and\ngive and give and the other person just\ntakes and takes and takes and we'd call\nthat like an abusive or exploitative\nrelationship which it\nis but love doesn't care about\nthat love is an inexhaustible source and\nit will just keep on giving to the even\nwhere they have to make a sacrifice of\ntheir own lives like Jesus did right so\nthat's why love is actually a really\ndangerous addition to relationships most\npeople don't know how to love most\npeople actually don't want to love they\nwant to get and again love is not about\ngetting what you want it's about giving\nother people what they\nneed which is not always what they want\nwhich is often why people that you love\ntend to dislike you because giving\npeople what they don't want doesn't make\nyou very\npopular okay so uh this was great I had\na lot of fun with this conversation it\nwent really\nwell uh I think I'll do this again some\ntime in any case I might as well plug\nthe book again the value of others it's\nout now you can buy it in ebook Audi\nbook and paperback formats I really like\nthe paperback it's over a pound you know\nit feels very satisfying to hold it in\nmy hands and to flip through the pages\num you can buy it on most platforms the\nlinks are to Amazon because that's where\num it's really good for promotional\npurposes but if you use other services\nit's probably on those platforms as well\nuh and thank you so much for all your\nsupport so far if you've read the book\nhopefully this answerers some of your\nquestions if you haven't maybe this W\nyour appetite for the book and um thank\nyou so much for your support for showing\nup and uh I hope to continue to put out\nnew great content I'll be doing a lot of\nmedia appearances in the next month or\ntwo to promote the book as well so I\nhave some exciting announcements to make\nin the coming weeks so please stay\ntuned thank you all for your support and\ntalk to you later byebye"
