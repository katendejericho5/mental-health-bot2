    "video_title": "The fundamental premise of relationships",
    "transcript": "another fundamental premise in my book\nabout the behavioral economics of\nrelationships is that relationships are\nthe medium in which value is transacted\npeople go to other people because they\nwant things from them that's why people\nare both a problem and a solution\nthey're a solution if they have the\nthings we want and are willing to give\nthem to us and they're a problem if they\ndon't have the things we want or they\nhave them and they won't give it to us\nand it's actually hard to tell who's who\nso that's why people are a problem until\nthey prove otherwise so this also helps\nto explain why some people seem to be a\nwash in optionality when it comes to\nrelationships of all kinds whether it's\nprofessional relationships or\nfriendships or sexual relationships and\nother people are just Hess and luckless\nthe people who are a wash in\nrelationships are not the good people\nthey're not The Virtuous people they're\nnot even the loving people they're the\npeople that other people want things\nfrom if you have more of what more\npeople want you will never be alone the\nreality of of Life on this planet is if\nyou want to have relation to other\npeople you need to have things that\nother people want that's the secret"
