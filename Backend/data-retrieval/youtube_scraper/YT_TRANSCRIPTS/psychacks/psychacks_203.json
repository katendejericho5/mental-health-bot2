    "transcript": "just like women are disincentivized from\nopening the gate of sex to everybody and\nanybody who wants it Men Are\ndisincentivized from opening the gate of\ncommitment to anybody and everybody who\nwants that women what's going to open\nthat gate is not you standing outside\ndeclaring that you're looking for a\nserious relationship that is like a\nSalesman knocking on your door and\nsaying Hey I want to make some money\nhere open up both are entering the\ninteraction exclusively focused on what\nthey want I want to make some money I\nwant a committed relationship let me in\nso how does a Salesman actually get you\nto engage by offering something that the\nother person might want and with respect\nto relationships between men and women\nit's safe to assume that something the\nother person might want is sex if a\nwoman stands in front of a man's gate\nand instead offers a sexual opportunity\nit will significantly increase the\nlikelihood that he will open it up and\ninvite her in that's why I say this is\nthe Trojan Horse of getting a committed\nrelationship"
