    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is you don't\nneed money to get women this is a very\ncommon misunderstanding among men and\nlike many misunderstandings it actually\nhas a grain of truth to it that has\nsubsequently been misinterpreted or\novergeneralized the grain of Truth is\nthat all of the things being equal if a\nwoman is presented with two otherwise\nidentical options and one is Rich and\none is poor then she is almost certainly\ngoing to select the rich man in the\nsexual Marketplace like why wouldn't she\nhowever this just means that having more\nmoney is generally seen as an asset to\nwomen in actuality you don't need money\nand you absolutely don't need to be rich\nin order to get access to women I know\nthis from personal experience and I know\nthis from working with thousands of men\nlet me speak for my own experience for a\nminute this may come as something of a\nsurprise to you but when I was a broke\nactor in my 20s it was easier for me to\nget women than when I was a successful\ndoctor in my\n30s strange but true and I'll talk about\nwhy I think that was the case a little\nbit later in this episode my point is\nthat while you might need money to keep\nwomen around in the long term you\ndefinitely don't need money to get women\nin the first place too many men believe\nthat being high value is just a\neuphemism for having high net worth it's\nnot so let's talk about what's behind\nthis fascination with money I made an\nepisode a while back called beware of\nattraction proxies that you might want\nto check out if you haven't already\nattraction proxies are things that we\nhope will do the work of attracting\npeople in Lo of actually doing the work\nof attracting people for some guys an\nattra ction proxy is a six-pack they\nthink I just need to get a six-pack and\nwomen are just going to start throwing\nthemselves at me no that's not how it\nworks for other guys it's a fancy car\nand they think once they see my ride\nthey're just going to be lining up man\nand that's also not how it works like a\nman could literally be earning an eight\nfig income and some women are simply not\ngoing to care and the women who do care\nsimply as a consequence of that piece of\ninformation are also probably not the\nwomen that man is going to want to have\nto deal with the point is that these\nthings are not the Silver Bullet that\nmany men hope they will be every month\nI'm telling you I work with guys who fly\nprivate and own Super Yachts who are\nlooking for advice on how to get laid I\nguarantee that there is an unemployed\nbroke dude living in his parents\nbasement who is smashing\ntonight I guarantee that that is\nhappening somewhere and that means that\nthere is a woman out there who is\nwilling to look past all of those things\nbecause he gives her other things and\nthese other things actually are\ninstrumentally related to getting laid\nnow there are three things that help a\nguy get women any one will work but if\nyou have all three even better and the\ngood news is that none of them will cost\nyou a dime let's go through them thing\nnumber one is confidence confidence is\nthe consistent felt experience of\nsuccess so it's easier to be\nauthentically confident with women once\nyou've enjoyed a sufficient amount of\nsuccess with women until you reach that\npoint however it's possible to be like\npsychotically confident it's psychotic\nbecause it's not really predicated on\nreality based evidence and it kind of\nrequires that you turn off a part of\nyour mind that say remembers all your\npast failures or IM all the way things\ncould go wrong and this isn't\nnecessarily a bad or crazy or unhealthy\nthing like football quarterbacks need to\nbe psychotically confident to some\ndegree in the sense that they need to be\nable to get up after being sacked and\ntrust that on the next play their\ndefensive line will hold and they can\nget the yardage that they need psychotic\nconfidence kind of just never considers\nthat it might not succeed which actually\nincreases the odds of success all other\nthings being\nequal thing number two is the ability to\nengage a woman's emotions this is the\nreal core of being attractive like one\nway to be attractive is to have a\nsymmetrical face a rugged jawline and\nwell- defined arms however that's not\nthe only way you can be attractive by\nbeing humorous and playful you can be\nattractive by being mysterious and\nunpredictable you can be attractive by\nbeing dangerous and edgy you can be\nattractive by being cocky and bold this\nis because attraction is functionally\nthe ability to capture attention through\nemotional engagement you can do this by\nbeing super hot but most of us aren't so\nmost of us will need to find other ways\nto capture attention through emotional\nengagement which absolutely exist many\naverage looking guys have mastered the\nability to engage a woman's attention\nthrough her emotions and these guys do\nnot have a problem getting laid and\nthing number three is being a contextual\nAlpha with respect to getting women it's\nbetter to be the biggest fish in a\nsmaller pond than to be a bigger fish in\na bigger Pond who is not the biggest\nfish in that pond and I think this\nphenomenon is directly related to the\nsuccess that I enjoyed as an actor in my\n20s even if I was just performing in\nsome Fringe theater in New York City if\nI was the lead I'd be on that stage for\ntwo hours and during that time a hundred\npeople would be looking at me and\nlistening to me and paying attention to\nme and applauding me do you see even if\nthat show was of no particular\nsignificance in the history of the world\nlike within the mood of that experience\nI was the king of that little castle and\noccupying the dominant role in a status\nhierarchy no matter how small or\npotentially ridiculous that hierarchy is\nreally effective at getting women this\nmeans that even if you're a smalltime\nmusician playing to eight people in a\ndive bar on a Tuesday or you're the guy\nthat gets everyone together for a magic\nthe Gathering tournament or you're\nhosting a local event on investment\nstrategy you can occupy the highest rung\non a ladder almost irrespective of who\nyou are that said you might have to\nbuild the ladder beneath\nyou okay but expending that effort will\nmake it more likely that the resultant\nsocial strcture serves your best\ninterests won't it these three things\nconfidence the ability to engage a\nwoman's emotions and being a contextual\nAlpha are what actually get man laid\nthey are not proxies they directly solve\nthe problem and the more you exercise\nthese Solutions the more you'll realize\nthat the belief that all women just want\nrelationships is wrong like that's a\nmyth there are plenty of women who just\nwant to smash there are plenty of women\nwho just want to have fun however\nthey're only going to show you that side\nof themselves if they're attracted to\nyou that is if you're able to Capt their\nattention through emotional engagement\ncars money a six-pack won't help you if\nyou cannot do this however if you can do\nthis you don't need the other things so\nif you're a man looking to expand a\nsexual optionality I would highly\nencourage you to learn these things\nrather than spend a lot of time energy\nand money trying to create indirect and\nultimately ineffective solutions to the\nproblem of access hopefully that clears\na few things up what do you think does\nthis fit with your own experience let me\nknow in the comments below and if you've\ngotten this far you might
