    "transcript": "Orion wouldn't following your advice\njust create this like slippery slope to\nthe bottom like if every woman has to be\nthe nastiest version of\nherself with every subsequent man she\nwants to have a relationship with\nwouldn't this just lead to women\nbecoming these like degraded sexual\nanimals now I have a couple of responses\nto this criticism in the first place\nlike I mentioned in the original episode\nthis advice doesn't necessarily have to\ndo with sex now obviously it could but\nif you're a young woman and all you've\never done is hold a boy's hand this\nadvice still applies because there are\nways of holding a boy's hand that\ncommunicate say platonic friendship and\nthere are ways of holding a boy's hand\nthat directly impart say a tantalizing\nsensuality in giving this advice I'm\ntrying to include as many of the\nstraight women in the sexual Marketplace\nas possible which includes young\ninexperienced women who may still be\nvirgins and I'm definitely not\nsuggesting that they just throw that\naway wanly"
