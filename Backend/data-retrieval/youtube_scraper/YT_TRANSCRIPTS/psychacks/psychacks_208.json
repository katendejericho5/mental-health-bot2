    "transcript": "the thing that has generated by far the\nmost vitriolic reaction is my advice\nthat women be the nastiest\nversions of themselves with the men they\nwant to have relationships with like\nthat one piece of advice is probably\nresponsible for 90% of my negative\nfeedback women have to be the nastiest\n versions of themselves with\nsomebody so whether she's consciously\nintending it or not the fact of the\nmatter is that every woman will be the\nnastiest lest version of themselves with\nsomeone what I'm advising is that she be\nthe nastiest version of\nherself with the man she wants to have a\nrelationship with so if you're\ndisagreeing with that statement and you\nconcede that she has to be the nastiest\n version of herself with\nsomeone that means that you're\nfunctionally arguing that she should be\nthe nastiest version of\nherself with someone she doesn't want to\nbe in a relationship with and how\nexactly does that serve a woman's dating\ngoals"
