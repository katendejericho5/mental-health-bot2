    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to be\nconfident without success so I've talked\nabout confidence a number of times on\nthis channel my working definition of\nconfidence is that it is the consistent\nfelt experience of success this\ndovetails nicely with another definition\nI heard recently from Alex horoi he says\nyou don't become Confident by shouting\naffirmations in the mirror correct\nbut by having a stack of undeniable\nproof that you are who you say you are\nso a stack of proof is consistent\nsuccess right that said I would say that\nas a final step it is necessary to\nintegrate that success emotionally this\nis because I know and have worked with\nplenty of people who have a good deal of\nproof but because of where they're\nfocused they don't yet feel the\nemotional correlate of that proof which\nis confidence so that's what I would add\nHeros definition but it's a very good\ndefinition nonetheless that said I can\nimagine some people out there rolling\ntheir eyes at these definitions why well\nif I need confidence in order to do the\nthing and I need to do the thing in\norder to feel confident then how am I\never going to feel confident right it's\nsort of like the problem we all\nexperience when we first enter into the\njob market like I'd like one job please\nwhat is your experience well I don't\nhave experience that's why I need the\njob I'm sorry but we're only hiring\npeople with experience like you see it's\nthis weird double bind and unfortunately\nit's always hardest at the beginning\nwhether we're talking about confident\naction or employment or dating or\nFitness like the incipient phase is\nalways the most challenging and this is\nunfortunate because beginners are\ntypically the least able to respond\neffectively to these\nchallenges however there's really no way\naround this problem if you want to be\nconfident then you have to do the thing\nwhich means that you're likely going to\nhave to do the thing before you feel\nauthentically confident and it is\npossible to feel a kind of confidence\nwithout that stack of proof or that\nconsistent experience of success it\nmight not be fully developed authentic\nconfidence but it will kind of have to\ndo for the time being it does require a\nbit of mental gymnastics to accomplish\nbut in my opinion it's worth doing at\nleast as a stop Gap\nsolution back when I was an adolescent\nand a young adult I had like this\npsychotic confidence in my own ability\nto succeed and I call this psychotic\nbecause I actually failed a lot of the\ntime however on some level I just never\nreally considered that it wouldn't work\nout\nand frankly that might be a consequence\nof not really thinking some things\nthrough like there is a time to think\nthings through and there is a time not\nto think things through why because the\nmore you think the more you're subject\nto analysis paralysis and the more you\nopen the door to self-doubt which will\nundermine your capacity for confident\naction when you need to do something a\nlittle risky especially if you need to\ndo something a little risky in order to\navoid an in action that is even riskier\nit can be really adaptive to limit the\namount of forethought you're willing to\nentertain like put yourself in the\nsituation and trust that you'll find a\nway to make it work because on some\nlevel if you need to you will so in the\nabsence of any evidence to the contrary\nmy advice is to just assume that you can\ndo it like you'll find out soon enough\nwhether that was true if it was great\nyou did it and if it wasn't well I guess\nthat was a learning experience wasn't it\nbut why not assume you can do the thing\nuntil proven\notherwise now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's word of mouse referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nderived from this video either through\nthe YouTube thanks button or through the\ndonation button on my website I use\nthose donations to make all of this\nhappen I don't do big product placements\nor corporate sponsorships so I really\nrely on your support in order to make\nthis all happen thank you very much\nfinally I will be starting a Weekly\nNewsletter soon so if you want to opt in\nyou can do so on my website okay let's\nget back to it now to feel confident\nbefore you have a stack of proof\nsometimes requires selectively turning\noff certain parts of your mind and\nallowing other parts to come to the\nForefront and when I recently explained\nthis to a client in a consultation he\nresponded oh so you mean lie to yourself\nand I can see where he's coming from\nthough I don't entirely agree my\nresponse to that pushback was is it a\nlie or is it just not true\nyet like what temporal Horizon are you\noperating under yes maybe you can't do\nit in this exact moment but the\nself-doubt that thinks that may not be\nlooking at the bigger picture if you\nhave a compelling and extrapolated\nvision for your future and if you\nbelieve that over a long enough timeline\nyou will either find a way or make a way\nthen on some level you've already done\nthe thing you just haven't done it\nyet there's this fascinating grammatical\ntense called the\nprophetic perfect tense it's a verb\ntense that is often used in religious\ntexts and it's used to describe events\nthat are so certain to happen that they\nare referred to in the past tense as if\nthey already happened I'll say that\nagain the prophetic perfect tense\ndescribes future events that are so\ncertain to happen that they are referred\nto in the past tense as if they've\nalready happened so as an example of\nthat I could say something like after\nlistening to the next episode of psyx my\naudience understood the nature of\nconfidence and went on to have happy\nsuccessful lives like I'm so certain\nthat this next episode will have helped\nyou that I'm already talking about the\noutcome as if it's already happened does\nthat make sense so if language is a\nreflection of our thought then the\nprophetic perfect tense suggests that\nthere is a way of thinking about our\nfuture action from even further in the\nfuture and this is possible when we have\nan extrapolated vision for what we want\nto happen\nthis is sort of akin to being the\npromoter for a music festival like\nimagine you want to organize this\nfantastic event where lots of people are\ngoing to come together to enjoy some\nphenomenal acts like that's your vision\nof the future now if you already had a\nbig headliner on board it would be a\npiece of cake to attract other bands but\nlet's assume that you don't let's assume\nthat you're right at the beginning and\nyou have nothing and no one how are you\ngoing to be confident about making this\nFestival a reality well you're going to\nstart picking up the phone opportuni\nisn't going to come to you you got to go\nto opportunity right the issue is that\nwhen you call someone up and say hey I'm\na promoter for this festival and I'd\nreally like to book you for my event I\nguarantee that the next thing out of\nthis person's mouth is going to be who\nelse is going to be there and this is\nreasonable as who else is going to be\nthere is a metric for how big and\ninteresting this opportunity is now if\nyou respond nobody you're the first\nperson I'm even talking to it's like\nclick you're not GNA get anywhere with\nthat so while you shouldn't lie you also\ncan't really tell the truth so what do\nyou do you got to say something like\nwell the set list hasn't been finalized\nyet not a lie you don't have a set list\nyet and I can't actually disclose who\nelse is on board not a lie no one else\nis on board so you can't disclose\nsomething that doesn't exist but I will\ntell you that we're exploring some very\nexciting options not a lie you're\nexcited about talking to the person that\nyou're talking to options that you've\nheard of not a lie the person you're\ntalking to has heard of him or herself\nand things are really starting to come\ntogether not a lie you did just start\nyou see talk like that and the other\nperson might at least stay on the line\nnow you call the next guy and when he\nasks you who else is going to be there\nyou can answer well I'm currently in\ndiscussions with the first person not a\nlie you're now talking to this person\nand when he responds yeah but did he\ncommit you can respond not yet but I\nfeel they're really close not a lie that\ncould be your feeling and if he says\nyeah well let me know when they actually\ncommit you can call back the first\nperson and say hey I just got off the\nphone with second person and he sounds\nlike he'd be on board if you're on board\nwhat do you say not a lie you were just\ntalking to this person and you kind of\ngo back and forth and back and forth\nuntil you get somebody to\ncommit and when you get one it will be\nmuch easier to get two and then pretty\nsoon you'll be Off to the\nRaces the point is to kind of respond to\nyour self-doubt the way this\nhypothetical promoter responded to the\npush back he received until he\neventually got what he wanted you don't\nhave to lie to yourself but you do have\nto respond to your doubts in a way that\nkind of already assumes that you've\nsucceeded which as we've discussed is\npossible using the thinking behind the\nprophetic perfect tense and all of this\nis facilitated by having a compelling\nand extrapolated vision for the future\nonce you start to succeed you won't need\nthese mental tricks anymore but they're\nreally helpful when you're just getting\nstarted hopefully that makes sense what\ndo you think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comment\nsection below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider becoming a channel member\nwith perks like
