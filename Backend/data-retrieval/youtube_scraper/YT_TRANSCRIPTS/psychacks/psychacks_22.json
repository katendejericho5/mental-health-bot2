    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why\ndating apps are making it harder to date\nso if you weren't aware you should know\nthat I published my first book just a\nfew days ago it's called the value of\nothers and it's the product of nearly 10\nyears of deep critical thinking and\nresearch on the subject of mating and\ndating basically I attempt to provide a\nsingle model to explain the behavior of\nboth men and women in the sexual\nMarketplace which is no easy task the\nbook is not a recapitulation of ideas\nI've already presented on this channel\nit's overwhelmingly new content and I\ndon't expect to discuss this content on\nthe channel moving forward however to\ngive my audience a taste of what's in\nthe book I'm going to put out a few\nepisodes that touch on ideas you'll find\nwithin its Pages this is one of them so\nif you like what you hear you might\nconsider buying the ebook the audiobook\nor the paperback version of the book\nlinks in the description below and be\nsure to listen to the end of this\nepisode for the\nkicker all right so lots of people\nstruggle on dating apps for lots of\ndifferent reasons which can be\nsurprising as the idea that dating apps\nare actually making it harder to date is\ncounterintuitive on some level it's\nnever been easier in the history of the\nworld to have direct access to more po\npotential mates than it is today you\njust switch on the magic rectangle you\ncarry around in your pocket and boom you\ninstantly have access to thousands of\nsingle and not so single people in your\narea ostensibly looking for love in fact\nwe've seen a dramatic uptick in the\nproportion of couples who met online in\nthe past decade 10 years ago about 20%\nof American couples met online now it's\naround 50% so most couples now meet\nonline and that frequency has more than\ndoubled in just the past 10\nyears however across that same time\nperiod we've seen an equally dramatic\ndownturn in the frequency of all kinds\nof sexual relationships over the past\ndecade fewer people are getting married\nfewer people are getting into\nrelationships and surprisingly fewer\npeople are even hooking up some of these\nnumbers are at historically\nunprecedented lows so while it's only a\ncorrelative find\nit's highly suggestive the more people\nrely on dating apps for sexual\nrelationships of all kinds the fewer\nsexual relationships are actually\ntransacted so why might that be it's not\nthe whole story but I'm going to advance\na simple economic argument to explain\nwhy dating apps unintentionally create\nfewer relationships it kind of goes like\nthis in the sexual Marketplace men are\nfundamentally attempting to exchange\nresources for sexual opportunity and\nwomen are fundamentally attempting to\nexchange their sexual opportunity for\nresources in many respects the\nincentives of men and women are actually\nantagonistic to each other that is men\nattempt to get as much sexual\nopportunity for as few resources as\npossible and women generally attempt to\nsecure as many resources for as little\nsexual opportunity as possible and the\nnegotiation phase of any courtship\nprocess no matter how brief or extended\nis function an attempt to sus out who\ngets what for how much and just like in\nthe commercial Marketplace the\nperception of supply and demand\ninteracts with this fundamental reality\nin the sexual\nMarketplace let's first consider the\nexperience on a dating app from the\nman's perspective within his\nsubjectivity when he engages with an app\nhe is one man interacting with a\nfunctionally infinite number of women he\nneither perceives nor interacts with any\nother men so he encounters no\nintersexual competition on an app it's\njust him and an endless supply of women\nwhich gives him the impression that it's\na buyers\nMarket just like in a commercial\nMarketplace apparently playing with\nfewer buyers than sellers drives down\nthe cost of the proposed transaction as\na result men reasonably come to believe\nthat somewhere in the sea of infinite\noptionality is a a more attractive\noption who will be willing to transact\nher sexual opportunity for fewer\nresources and he's right there is just\nlike in a global economy there is always\nsomeone who will be willing to do the\nsame job for less money in the\nunregulated sexual economy there is\nalways a woman who will be willing to\ntransact her sexual opportunity for\nfewer\nresources ultimately this creates a race\nto the bottom in which a greater\nproportion of men are emboldened to\ntransact directly for women's sexual\nopportunity for little to no resources\nin Exchange men's subjective perception\non dating apps in combination with\nrational economic principles creates the\n boy phenomenon from his perspective\ngiven the ratio of buyers to sellers he\nshould be able to secure sex at Bargain\nBasement prices and he's not necessarily\nwrong now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its

you're\ninterested in booking a paid\nconsultation the links to everything are\nin the description below please check\nthem out this is how you can support\nthis Channel and its Mission all right\nlet's get back to\nit next let's now consider the\nexperience on a dating app from the\nwoman's perspective within her\nsubjectivity when she engages with an\napp she is one woman interacting with a\nfunctionally infinite number of men she\nneither perceives nor interacts with any\nother women so she encounters no\nintersexual competition on the app it's\njust her and an endless supply of men\nmany of whom whom are apparently\nextremely eager to transact for her\nopportunity which gives her the\nimpression that it's a sellers Market\njust like in a commercial Marketplace\napparently playing with fewer sellers\nthan buyers drives up the proposed\ntransaction as a result women reasonably\ncome to believe that somewhere in the\nsea of infinite optionality is a more\nattractive option who will be willing to\ntransact more resources for the same\nsexual\nopportunity and she's right there is\njust like in a global economy there is\nalways someone who will be willing to\npay more for the same good somewhere\nwhich is the principle that makes\nmercantilism or geoarbitrage possible in\nthe unregulated sexual economy there is\nalways a man who will be willing to\ntransact more resources for a given\nsexual\nopportunity ultimately this creates\nhyperinflation in which a greater\nproportion of women are emboldened to\ntransact for men's resources for little\nto no sexual opportunity women's\nsubjective perception on dating apps in\ncombination with rational economic\nprinciples creates the gold digger\nphenomenon from her perspective given\nthe ratio of sellers to buyers she\nshould be able to command a premium for\nher sexual\nopportunity and she's not necessarily\nwrong and just to be clear any woman who\ncomes right out of the gate asking for a\ncommitted relationship is on the gold\ndigger Spectrum like I can understand\nwhy women are insulted when men just\nproposition them for sex from a woman's\nperspective such men are trying to get\nvalue for nothing however women\ndemanding a significant relationship\nupfront is even more ludicrous as male\ncommitment is far more expensive than\nfemale sexual opportunity into today's\ndating Market from Men's perspective\nsuch women are trying to get a lot of\nvalue for nothing so what's the upshot\nbecause of the differences in their\nsubjective experiences while using\ndating apps and because of the\ndifferences in their gendered incentives\nto engage in the sexual Marketplace what\nends up happening is that men and women\nare growing increasingly Divergent in\ntheir valuations of sex and commitment\nmen think sex should cost this much\nwomen think sex should cost this much\nand they're both right at least within\ntheir respective\nsubjectivities but here's the thing when\npeople get too far away from each other\nin terms of\nvaluation they can't do business with\neach other if one side wants to buy for\na dollar and the other wants to sell for\na million they're not going to meet in\nthe middle since the middle is just too\nfar away from either one of their\nanchorings in fact one of the\nfundamental principles of the book is\nthat people enter into Relationships by\ntransacting unequal Goods of comparable\nvalue the more incomparable the\nvaluations the less likely the\nrelationship and if the two parties are\ntoo far away from each other in terms of\ntheir valuations then there are no\ngrounds for a negotiation at all so\nnothing gets transacted practically\nspeaking this would mean to a\nsignificant reduction this would lead to\na significant reduction in all forms of\nsexual relationships from marriages to\none night's dance and this would only\nmake sense if men attempt to secure\nsexual opportunity for resources in the\nsexual Marketplace and women attempt to\nsecure resources for sexual opportunity\nin the\nsame thanks for watching all the way to\nthe end of the episode so what's the\nkicker the kicker is that the idea\npresented in this episode constitutes\njust three paragraphs of my 432 page\nbook book another way to say the same\nthing is that my book the value of\nothers is equivalent to 500 unreleased\nfulllength psyx episodes it's packed\nfull of unflinching truths about the\nsexual Marketplace and the game of\nmeeting and dating so if you like what\nyou heard here today I would highly\nencourage you to get your hands on a\ncopy again the links are in the\ndescription what do you think does this\nfit with your own experience let me know\nin the comments below as always I\nappreciate your support and thank you\nfor listening"
