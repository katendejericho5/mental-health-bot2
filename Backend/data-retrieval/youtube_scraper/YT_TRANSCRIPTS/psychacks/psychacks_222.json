    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is women do\nthe right things with the wrong men so\nI've already done this episode from the\nmen's perspective today I'll be\ndiscussing this phenomenon from the\nwomen's perspective because boy oh boy\ndo women do the right things with the\nwrong men make sure that you listen to\nthe very end okay to illustrate what I\nmean by this let me share an anecdote\nfrom my personal life many years ago the\nwoman I was dating had a girlfriend come\ninto town and the three of us went out\nto dinner together and over the course\nof this meal it became apparent that\nthis woman didn't yet have a place to\nstay for the night the woman I was\nseeing invited her to stay with her but\nThis Woman's solution was to text a guy\nshe had gone out with a few months ago\nthe plan was to meet him out for a drink\ngo back to his place spend the night\nwith him and then get on with whatever\nit was that she came into town to do now\nthe doesn't know this yet this is just\nthe woman's plan for the evening when we\nexpressed Our concern she tried to\nreassure Us by saying oh it's fine I\ndon't really like this guy so it's okay\nif I just use him for the night and I\nremember turning to the woman I was with\nand asking her if she might try liking\nme a little\nless so this was a joke but like all\ngood jokes there was some truth to it\nladies if you call me up invite me out\nfor a drink come back to to my place\nhave sex with me all night leave in the\nmorning and don't communicate with me\nuntil you're ready to do that again I\nguarantee I won't feel like you don't\nlike me what's more I will feel very\npositively about you from the man's\nperspective that woman's plan had an\nextremely high good times to hassle\nratio the interaction was easy\neffortless fun inexpensive convenient\nand sexually satisfying if you treat a\nman like this I guarantee that he will\nwant to see you again this is because\nmen do not encounter High good times to\nhassle ratio women very often frankly\ny'all can be a real handful so if you\ngive a guy a lot of what he wants and\nnot a lot of what he doesn't he will\ntext you back he will answer your phone\ncall and in the vast majority of cases\nhe will attempt to replicate that\nencounter sooner as opposed to later\nbecause you gave him an extremely\npositive experience even if only once he\nwill often go to Great Lengths and\nexpense to make it happen again and\nisn't that what you want a guy to go to\nGreat Lengths and expense for you\nunfortunately this woman kind of wasted\nthis experience yeah she got a place to\nstay for the night so she saved a few\nhundred bucks but she didn't really like\nthe guy remember in fact she didn't even\nlive in the same town so it would be\ndifficult for her to get much more out\nof the relationship even if she did like\nhim imagine if she had done this with a\nguy she actually did like and who was in\na position to offer her a relationship\nshe could have saved a few\nhundred, bucks while spending her nights\nwith a man she actually felt positively\nabout that's the power of a high good\ntimes to hassle\nratio but what do Wom do when they meet\na guy they actually like first and\nforemost they often want to take it\nslow women seem to have this belief that\nhaving sex too soon somehow disqualifies\nthem from a long-term relationship it\ndoes not on the contrary as we'll see\nit's waiting too long that generally\ndoes however what taking it slow\nfunctionally does is make the courtship\nprocess significantly more expensive for\nthe\nlike expensive in every possible way\nit's expensive by way of time attention\nmoney effort opportunity and often\nfrustration men do not feel liked when\nyou make them jump through hoops to get\nsex men do not feel liked when you give\nthem less of what they want and more of\nwhat they don't men do not feel liked\nwhen interactions with you are difficult\neffortful serious expensive inconvenient\nand sexually frustrating are you\nlistening and in the second case when a\na woman meets a guy she actually likes\nit tends to arouse her\ninsecurities because she is now in an\nemotionally risky situation after all if\nthe guy she didn't really like doesn't\nlike her back she might not bad an\neyelash however if the guy she does like\ndoesn't like her back she might be\nsignificantly distressed so women\nattempt to shore up their insecurities\nin a number of ways including testing a\nman's interest demanding commitment\nseeking reassurance provoking arguments\netc etc and all of this Behavior\nsignificantly increases the hassle\nassociated with dealing with these women\nespecially since the man she doesn't\nlike and who doesn't therefore arouse\nher insecurities doesn't have to deal\nwith any of this\n now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nderived from this episode either through\nthe YouTube thanks button or through the\ndonation button on my website I will\nalso soon be starting a Weekly\nNewsletter so if you want to opt in you\ncan do so on my website okay let's get\nback to\nit between taking it slow and all of the\nannoying things that they're subject to\ndoing when they're feeling insecure\nwomen significantly decrease the good\ntimes to hassle ratio with the men they\nactually like this is experienced as\npunitive by men who will not\nconsequently make an effort to get you\nor keep you in their lives ladies if you\nlike a man then reward him with fun\ntimes and good sex and then leave him\nalone leave him\nalone leave him alone I guarantee that\nmen do not forget these women you willar\nfrom these men again maybe not quite as\nsoon as you'd like but you will trust me\nit's like I still remember that corner\nin Brooklyn where I found 80 bucks 20\nyears ago I will probably never forget\nthat place for as long as I live and I\ndefinitely walked by that place more\nthan once to see if I might find\nsomething else there in any case ladies\nif you want to NAB a big fish you have\nto ensure that the hook is firmly in\nplace before you start reeling it in and\nthis is how you set the hook fun times\ngood sex leave them\nalone so this is what I mean when I say\nthat women do the right things with the\nwrong men they have good times that\ndon't really count with the men they\ndon't really want relationships with and\nthey hold out and act nutty with the men\nthey do want to have relationships with\nI'm telling you if that guy has any\noptionality whatsoever and he probably\ndoes if he's a high value man he's not\ngoing to wait around just to pay more\nfor\nLess now the rebuttal I usually hear\nfrom women when I talk like this is\nsomething like that's not true Orion\nit's not true if a man really liked me\nhe'd be willing to wait so if he's not\nwilling to wait that must mean that he\ndoesn't really like me he probably just\nwanted to use me for sex so this\nstrategy helps me weed out the boys\nafter all I don't want to just be used\nfor sex all right let me respond to this\nleaving aside the fact that women often\nin intentionally allow themselves to be\nused for sex remember the woman in my\nanecdote allowed herself to be used for\nsex in order to have a place to stay for\nthe night the problem with this rebuttal\nis that it's too\ninclusive like as a discrimination\nstrategy it will produce far too many\npositive outcomes like yes if you make a\n boy wait he won't stick around\ncorrect this is because waiting makes\nthe same sexual opportunity increasingly\nmore expensive although the things being\nequal and a boy is trying to\ntransact a sexual opportunity as cheaply\nas possible however not every man who\nwon't write around is a boy okay\nlet me\nexplain let's imagine that you have an\nall-time favorite restaurant the food is\nphenomenal the Ambiance is exquisite the\nservice is exceptional like everything\neverything about this place is wonderful\nyou love everything but let's also\nImagine that you live two hours away and\nthat word has gotten out about how great\nthis place is so it's extremely\ndifficult to get a reservation and in\norder to even make a reservation you\nfirst need to join some kind of Diner\nclub that requires a steep Initiation\nfee and an interview process how like\nwould you how would how often you eat\nthere be an accurate reflection of how\nyou feel about the place probably not\nyou love this restaurant the problem is\nthere are all of these obstacles in the\nway of you going there more frequently\nif you were to confess this to the\nmanager and he were to say well if this\nreally was your all-time favorite\nrestaurant you wouldn't have an issue\ndriving two hours to eat dinner and you\nwould make it a priority to secure a\nreservation because that's what people\ndo when they love things they go above\nand beyond they make an effort they're\nwilling to wait and the fact that you\naren't willing to do those things means\nyou probably couldn't care less about\nthis\nestablishment like if he were to say\nthis to you I don't think you'd feel\nvery heard and\nunderstood the problem was not your\nlevel of interest in the restaurant the\nproblem was the number of\nobstacles in the way of eating there\nwomen if you like a guy do not put\nobstacles in the path of eating at your\nrestaurant make the guys that you don't\nreally like weight and allow the men you\nwant to keep around to cut to to the\nfront of the line do this and you will\nhave much more success with men okay\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider becoming a channel member\nwith perks like the priority
