    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is men do\nthe right things with the wrong women\nthis principle applies to both men and\nwomen but it's just too much content to\ncover in one episode so I'll be talking\nabout how men do the right things with\nthe wrong women first and then I'll\ndiscuss how women do the right things\nwith the wrong men in a future episode\nfirst a caveat in these episodes I'm\ngoing to be assigning numbers to people\nnow I'm not doing this simply as a means\nof measuring the person's physical\nattractiveness more than anything else\nI'm using these numbers to represent\nsubjective interest so a six here is\nsomeone you could kind of take or leave\nwhereas a nine is someone that you're\nactually really interested in this has a\nlot to do with perceived physical\nattractiveness especially with men but\nit's definitely not the whole story okay\nlet's get to it we'll start with\napproach guys imagine you're at a bar\nand you see a six on a bar stool and a\nnine in the corner surrounded by a bunch\nof her friends after a couple of drinks\nmost men are actually going to end up\napproaching the six why because they're\ngoing to incorrectly perceive her to be\nthe safer option the fact of the matter\nis that most men are intimidated by\nattractive women they think that women\nalso use the metric that men apply to\nthem which is a failure of intersex\nunderstanding this leads them to think\nthat the nine is out of their league so\nshe functionally represents punching\noutside their weight class on the other\nhand they tend to think that the six\nshould be like shooting fish in a barrel\nespecially if they consider themselves\nto be like a seven or an eight they're\nmore likely to think it's This Woman's\nlucky day or this is a sure thing the\nissue is that it certainly isn't a sure\nthing this is because while men tend to\ntitrate their standards to kind of match\nthe attractiveness of the particular\nwoman they're dealing with women kind of\ndon't I know it might sound Bonkers but\nthat six is very likely to have the same\nstandards with respect to the men she's\nwilling to mate and date then that nine\nis and this actually makes the six less\nsafe than the nine this is because it's\nactually going to hurt worse if and when\na six rejects you than if and when a\nnine does give it your perceptions if\nand when a nine rejects you you're\nprobably going to think yeah I kind of\nget it it was a long shot anyway on the\nother hand given your perceptions if and\nwhen a six rejects you you might\nactually get your ego bruised who does\nthis women think she is I was doing her\na favor do you understand it's actually\nall in your head but isn't everything\nanyways in any case this is a part of\nthe reason why sixes actually tend to\nget approached in bars more often than\nnines\nand it's attention it's this attention\nfrom men that can inappropriately\nmislead these sixes into believing that\nthey are perceived to be more attractive\nthan they actually are so let's assume\nthat you go up to the six because you\nperceive her to be the safer option\nbecause you kind of believe that you're\nthe more attractive option you're going\nto act like you're the more attractive\noption you're going to be more confident\nyou're going to take bigger risks and\nmost importantly you're not really going\nto care about her own interest in you\nafter all you're not that into her\nanyway so you think it won't be any skin\noff your back if it falls through that\nconfident indifference is like crack to\nwomen they'll swear up and down that\nthey hate it when men behave that way\nbut I guarantee that they're not going\nhome with the empathic nice guy at the\nend of the night next in your\ninteraction with the six you're likely\ngoing to be a bit more sexually\naggressive than you would with the nine\nlike you're going to be a bit more\nmotivated to move the encounter in the\ndirection of a sexual opportunity to\nquote Alec Baldwin and Glen Gary Glenn\nRoss it's [ __ ] or walk and why is that\nbecause if you perceive her to be a six\nthere might not be much else besides the\nsexual opportunity to justify your\ncontinued investment of time energy and\nattention so you're unlikely to spend\nthe whole evening talking to this girl\nyou'll communicate your sexual intent\nmore quickly and see how she responds if\nshe's not receptive you'll probably cut\nyour losses sooner and move on and if\nshe is receptive you can choose to act\non it or not all other things being\nequal men who are more sexually\naggressive but important caveat not men\nwho are too sexually aggressive are more\nlikely to transition a sexual\nopportunity into a sexual encounter and\nthis is simply due to the fact that it\nis very rare for women to take the lead\non these things like they can pump the\nbrakes but they're generally not going\nto step on the gas and just like driving\nmen who step on the gas tend to get to\nwhere they're going more\nquickly now before I go any further if\nyou're

Weekly\nNewsletter so if you want to opt in you\ncan do so on my website okay let's get\nback to\nit let's say that you succeed in\nbringing this six back to your place and\nyou both enjoy a lovely consensual\nsexual encounter once you're finished\nhow are you going to behave are you\ngoing to be telling this girl that she's\nthe best you've ever had are you going\nto start planning this second date while\nshe still lying there in bed once she\nleaves are you going to text her the\nnext day hey I I want you to know that I\nhad a great time last night smiley face\nwinky face no once you're finished you\nmight be\nthinking when is this woman going to\nleave and you're probably not going to\nbe texting her anytime soon after a\ncertain amount of time this will\nprobably motivate her to reach out to\nyou because most women don't like the\nidea of Simply being a one night stand\nand you might be cool and indifferent\nabout the prospect of a second meeting\ndo this a few more times and this woman\nmight be blowing up your phone trying to\ninvite you over for a home-cooked meal\nand guys end up thinking why is it\nalways the ones that I'm not interested\nin who always seem to want a\nrelationship with me the answer is\nsimple my dudes you did the right things\nwith the wrong woman I guarantee that\nall of the things that you did to pull\nthe six are just as effective in pulling\nthe\nnine why because these two don't belong\nto different species they are the same\nanimal they are woman and if it works on\none it will work on the the other the\nproblem is that your attraction\nliterally [ __ ] with your perception and\nyou end up thinking that the two are\nsomehow categorically different they're\nnot that's all in your head but what do\nguys do when they Finly meet a woman\nthat they're really excited about they\nthrow all of that effective Behavior\nright out the window they disclose their\nattraction and positive emotions quickly\nand clearly they hesitate in expressing\nsexual in interest and communicating\nsexual intent they start planning the\nsecond date while they're still on the\nfirst they text the next day they smile\nand compliment and buy gifts and pursue\nand none of that [ __ ] Works none of it\nand it wouldn't work for the six either\nbut you wouldn't even think of doing\nthose things with her because you\nwouldn't believe the effort would be\njustified by your\nattraction my dudes treat the nine like\nthe six when you invest any given woman\nwith more interest and emotion than she\ninvests in you then you make her the\nadored that turns you into the adorer\nthe\npursuer and this is a problem because\nwomen are kind of like prey animals when\nyou start to chase them a lot of them\nhave this Instinct deep inside of them\nto just run away even if it's from a\nreally great relationship opportunity\nlike they don't know that yet they just\nfeel you chasing and so they just feel\nthis impulse to run away and even if\nit's wrong this instinct is kind of in\nthe service of their survival like it's\nmore adaptive for them to run from a\nfalse positive than for them to not run\nfrom a false negative understand this is\nwhy it's really important not to pursue\nwomen if you do in the vast majority of\ncases you'll only succeed in chasing\nthem right out of your\nlife I understand that this can be ult\nbut as a man it is essential that you\nkeep a tight rain on your emotions\nfinally meeting a woman that you're\nauthentically excited about after months\nor years of unsatisfying Engagement in\nthe sexual Marketplace is kind of like\ngetting pocket aces in poker after a\nstring of bad hands if you start jumping\nup and down in your chair and pumping\nyour fists in the air you are going to\nblow that opportunity man so what do you\ndo when you get pocket aces in poker the\nsame [ __ ] thing you do on any other\nhand you get dealt in poker you need to\nstick to your system and keep control of\nyour emotions otherwise that hand is\ngoing to be wasted on you my friend run\nthe experiment for yourself whatever\nyou're doing to make that six pursue you\nfor a\nrelationship works that is your system\ndo the same thing with a nine and\nobserve the results you're welcome what\ndo you think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this
