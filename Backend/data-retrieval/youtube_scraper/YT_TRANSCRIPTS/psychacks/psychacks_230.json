    "transcript": "why don't more people live their own\nlives well there is a cost associated\nwith living your own life the cost is\nsimple but it's hard for a lot of people\nto pay here it is the cost of living\nyour own life is the approval of others\nthat's it if you want to live your own\nlife you have to give up any claim to\nsocial approval even though these\ncultures fail people every single day\npeople are very emotionally attached to\nthem they've largely dictated how their\nfriends have lived their lives they've\nlargely dictated how their relatives\nhave lived their lives and they've\nlargely dictated how their neighbors and\ncolleagues and fellow congregants live\ntheir lives as well these people might\nnot be able to approve of your choices\nbecause chances are they won't be able\nto understand them and how can someone\npossibly approve of something that he\ndoesn't understand but that's the\nreality the more your life deviates from\nthese cultural expectations the less\nyour life becomes comprehensible to\nothers and this can be a very lonely\nsituation"
