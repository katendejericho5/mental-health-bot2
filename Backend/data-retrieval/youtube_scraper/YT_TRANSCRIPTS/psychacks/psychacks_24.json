    "transcript": "so what does this mean that a man exists\nin the frames of two women\nsimultaneously uh let's say that the\nwife is demanding the man leave his\nmistress and stay with her and that the\nmistress is demanding the man leave his\nwife and stay with her not only does\nthis insist on a mutually exclusive\ndecision that may not necessarily be\nrequired but in his mindset the man's\nentire range of optionality is either to\ngive woman a what she wants or a woman\nbe what she wants like what about what\nthe man wants the choice is not between\nwife or mistress this is a product of\nthe women controlling the discussion the\nchoice is actually between the wife or\nno wife will the wife help the man go\nwhere he wants to go and between the\nmistress and no mistress that is will\nthe mistress help the man go where he\nwants to go and this can be hard for men\nbecause many of them haven't thought\nabout what they want in quite some time\nthis is because they have gotten so in\nthe habit of serving their women and\nthey have gotten so comfortable existing\nin their women's frames"
