    "transcript": "women are going to be a part of our\nlives in one way or another and when\nfully integrated the red pill allows men\nto have fulfilling relationships with\nwomen in a way that makes sense for the\nparticular individuals involved women\nare not the enemy and they are not to be\nfeared or hated or shunn these emotional\nresponses indicate a lack of acceptance\nand understanding that said I'm also not\nsaying that men should just get over it\nmany men have been significantly harmed\nby women and working through their\ntrauma is going to be in a essential\nstage of their journey and I'm not\nsaying that the end result is supposed\nto look like men and women holding hands\nand singing Kumbaya for many men it is\nentirely appropriate not to return to\nthe relationships they once had what I\nam saying is women aren't going anywhere\nand the vast majority of men will\ncontinue to relate to women in some form\nor another after they swallow the red\npill understanding women an intersexual\nDynamics more generally is kind of like\nfinally reading the rule book to a game\nyou have little choice but to play"
