    "transcript": "there is a way to get the kind of\ninformation that you want from a man\nwithout interrogating without shaming\nwithout demanding you do not have to\nalways agree with a man that would be\nimpossible because we men do all kinds\nof boneheaded things all the time so\nwomen do not have to approve of a guy\nbut they absolutely have to find ways to\ndisapprove disagree without\ndisrespecting and that's absolutely\nsomething that can be possible the\ngeneral rule of thumb is if you wouldn't\nsay that in that way to your boss if you\nwere interested in keeping your job you\nshouldn't say that to a man"
