    "transcript": "what you need to understand is that\njealousy only manifests in response to a\nperceived romantic threat if a 300 lb\nunemployed screen jockey who lives in\nhis parents' basement slid into your\ngirl's DMs I don't think you'd have a\nproblem you might even be able to have\nsome fun with it like whoo that's a fine\nfish you reeled in here are you sure you\nwant to settle for a little old me when\nthere's so many more attractive options\nout there in the world for you and why\nwould you be able to play this off so\neasily because you wouldn't feel\nthreatened by this guy at all jealousy\nonly manifests in response to a\nperceived threat and the perceived\nthreat is always the same namely the\nbelief that the other party might be\nbetter than you in a self-relevant\ndimension of your identity and might\ntherefore be a better option for your\npartner than you are"
