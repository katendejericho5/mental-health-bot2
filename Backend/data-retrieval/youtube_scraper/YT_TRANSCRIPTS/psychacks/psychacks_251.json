    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nhandle relationship\njealousy this is a subject on which I\nroutinely give consultations in my\nprivate practice jealousy is an\nextremely corrosive emotion I've only\nfelt it a couple of times in my life but\nI can tell you it is my least favorite\nemotion like I hated it it's a terrible\nfeeling so if at all possible we want to\nprevent the fluoresence of this emotion\nin our\nrelationships because a person who has\nbeen overcome with jealousy is subject\nto all kinds of destructive and\nregrettable behavior so it's best to\nthink of jealousy like a powerful spice\njust a little bit of it can make your\nfood more interesting but any more than\nthat and it will probably ruin the\ndish this means that jealousy is\nsomething that needs to be managed and\nit's your responsibility to manage your\nown emotions so let's talk about how to\ndo that today to begin with what you\nneed to understand is that jealousy only\nmanifests in response to a perceived\nromantic threat if a 300 pound\nunemployed screen jockey who lives in\nhis parents basement slid into your\ngirl's DMs I don't think you'd have a\nproblem\nyou might even be able to have some fun\nwith it like whoa that's a fine fish you\nreeled in here are you sure you want to\nsettle for a little old me when there's\nso many more attractive options out\nthere in the world for you and why would\nyou be able to play this off so easily\nbecause you wouldn't feel threatened by\nthis guy at all jealousy only manifests\nin response to a perceived threat and\nthe perceived threat is always the same\nnamely the belief that the other party\nmight be better than you you in a\nself-relevant dimension of your identity\nand might therefore be a better option\nfor your partner than you\nare you might feel many things when\nanother man hits on your girl Amusement\ndisgust\nbewilderment but you'll only feel\njealousy if this condition is fulfilled\nthe key here is to understand that this\nis just your perception jealousy is a\nresponse to a perceived threat he might\nnot act be a threat in reality he might\nbe but he might not be you understand\nthe issue however is that as soon as you\nstart to act from a place of jealousy\nwhich usually looks like contemptuous\ncritical or controlling Behavior what\nyou're effectively doing is\ncommunicating to your partner that you\nthink this other person is a better\noption for her and that might change her\nperception to align with yours I cannot\nstress this enough your woman might not\nsee a man as a better option until you\nstart to express jealousy about him\nthat's why it's not a good idea to plant\nthat idea in your woman's head which is\nwhat you essentially do when you start\nbehaving\njealously this means that no matter what\neven if you feel that hot evil feeling\nRising inside of you you have to put on\nyour best poker face and express\nindifference to let's say casual\ninteractions casual interactions are\nbehaviors that while potentially\nslightly unusual still fall within the\nrange of normal behavior these could be\nthings like talking to someone a bit\nlonger than you might like at a cocktail\nparty or communicating with someone over\nsocial media remember whatever you\nattend to gets bigger I understand that\nyou do not like this behavior and you\nfeel the need to take action to ensure\nit doesn't happen again in the future\nbut flying into a jealous Rage or trying\nto control who she can talk to and when\nand under what conditions isn't going to\ndo that what it is going to do is make\nyou significantly less attractive\nbecause when is emotional instability\never attractive in a man well at the\nsame time making the other person\nsignificantly more attractive and this\nnot only because you have effectively\ncommunicated that you yourself believe\nthis other guy to be more attractive\nthan you are but also because few things\nin life are more irresistible than\nforbidden fruit and when you start to\ncontrol or restrict your partner's\nBehavior you make the Forbidden more\nattractive to her than it otherwise\nwould be I don't make the news I just\nreport it now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing

the thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've derived from this\nepisode I rely on your support to make\nall this happen I really appreciate it I\nwill also soon be starting a Weekly\nNewsletter so if you want to opt in you\ncan do so on my website finally if\nyou're thinking of going to grad school\nthen check out my top R GRE study\nprogram at Stellar g.com I rate the\nwhole thing you'll love the content it's\nawesome check it out okay let's get back\nto it all right so you don't want to do\nthings to destabilize your relationship\nand increase your woman's attraction for\nother men so what's the alternative the\nalternative is to adopt the attitude\nthat other men make me look\ngood and given the General State of men\nthese days this unfortunately is not\nactually a very high\nbar other men make me look good\nand if you can't bring yourself to\nbelieve that yet all right then take a\nlook at your life and do what you need\nto do to be able to say that to yourself\nwith\nconviction take care of your health and\nyour finances and your lifestyle and\nmake it happen because when you arrive\nat that place where you can confidently\nsay other men make me look\ngood and you're going to feel all other\nthings being equal that you are a\nwoman's best option\nand when you feel that way you won't\nneed to rely on games of manipulation or\ncontrol to keep her with you think of it\nlike this a man in this state is the\nking and what did Kings do back in the\nday when they were going to wife\nsomebody up they took their bride to be\naround the whole Kingdom and showed her\noff like a prize Pony and all the Pres\nThe Peasants would line up to see her\nand kiss her hand and say things like\nver L the fairest blossom in all the\nland and oh if only I were 20 years\nyounger and your eyes are fiery orbs\nplucked from the fabric of the firmament\nEtc and the King didn't get upset his\nsubjects would lowgrade flirt with his\nfiance right in front of him and he just\nsmile and Nod his head why because he\nunderstood that the peasant's\nappreciation for her beauty was actually\na way of respect in him it was their way\nof saying good choice my do you\nunderstand and the King doesn't even\nimagine getting upset because Kings know\nthat women don't leave Kings for\npeasants because that's not how women\nOperate Now does that mean that Kings\nnever become jealous no it does not\nhowever when kings do become jealous\nit's when they forget that they're\nkings so to defend against the\nfluoresence of jealousy you need to a do\nthe things you need to do so that you\ncan confidently say to yourself that\nother men make me look good I.E to\nascend to your kingship and B react to\nany perceived threats in the same way\nthat you would react to a perceived\nnon-threat and this is an essential\nskill to learn because let's be honest\nmen are going to lust after your girl\nthey are going to try to seduce your\ngirlfriend even marriage doesn't prevent\nthis men are still going to shoot their\nshot the only way to prevent this from\nhappening is to get with an ugly girl\nI'm serious commit to the woman that no\nother man wants and you won't have to\ndeal with this problem but is that\nreally worth it probably not on the\nother hand if you want a beautiful\ndesirable woman you're going to have to\ndeal with the fact that other men men\nare going to want to [ __ ] her okay and\nyou can deal with that by abiding in\nyour\nkingship understand that they're hitting\non her is actually a reflection of your\npower and Status why because she's with\nyou you\ndummy just remember other men make you\nlook\ngood they don't have your woman they're\njust making you look better and women\ndon't leave Kings for peasants that's\nnot how they work make sense what do you\nthink does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far
