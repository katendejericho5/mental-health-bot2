    "transcript": "so what's wrong with the intas psychic\nfallacy well in my opinion it largely\nignores where the lon's share of\ndepression comes from namely people's\nrelationships to their larger\nenvironments a particular note is the\nfact that depression is associated with\nbeing low status in a self-relevant\ndominance hierarchy life is hard at the\nbottom of the ladder low status\nindividuals are more likely to have\nlimited if any optionality with respect\nto professional opportunity and little\nto know access to sexual relationships\nthey may have few to know friends or\nclose confidants they may be ignored or\neven reviled by those around them and\nwhile it is possible strictly speaking\nto be peaceful and contented and\nresilient at the bottom of the hierarchy\nit is extremely difficult to do so and\nthose who reside at the lowest rungs of\nthese hierarchies are typically those\nleast equipped with the skills to\nmitigate the effects of their status"
