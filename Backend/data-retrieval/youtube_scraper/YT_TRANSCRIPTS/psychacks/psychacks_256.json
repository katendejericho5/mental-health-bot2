    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is what\npeople fail to understand about\ndepression depression is one of the most\ncommonly diagnosed mental illnesses on\nthe planet Legions of Americans are\ncurrently taking some form of prescribed\nanti-depressant it is a problem that\naffects the quality of life of millions\nand millions of individuals every day\nand it's also an issue that is generally\nmisunderstood\nby the vast majority of people including\nthose suffering from it let's talk about\nthis today the principal way in which\ndepression is\nmisunderstood is that is considered to\nreside entirely between the ears of the\ndepressed individual I call this the\nintas psychic fallacy and this fallacy\ngives rise to the two most popular\napproaches to intervention neither of\nwhich unfortunately is associated with a\nvery very high rate of success we can\nlook at each one in turn the first way\nthis fallacy manifests itself is in the\nbelief that depression exists in the\nbrain of the depressed individual you're\nprobably familiar with some version of\nthe monoamine hypothesis which I have\npreviously discussed on this channel the\nmonoamine hypothesis is the theory that\ndepression is caused by an imbalance in\ncertain brain chemicals like serotonin\nand if this were true true it would make\nsense to recalibrate the balance of\nthese brain chemicals using\npharmaceutical\ninterventions now many people don't know\nthat this hypothesis was actually\nrecanted by its originator decades ago\ndue to a lack of evidence to quote the\nlargest metaanalysis ever conducted on\nthe topic quote the main areas of\nSerotonin research provide no consistent\nevidence of there being an association\nbetween serotonin and depression and no\nsupport for the hypothesis that\ndepression is caused by lower serotonin\nactivity or concentrations linked to the\nfull study in the pinned comment note\nthat the finding was no\nassociation which means the metanalysis\nfailed to identify even a correlation\nlet alone a causation between serotonin\nlevels and\ndepression what's more anti presence\nthat manipulate serotonin have a\nterrible track record in randomized\ncontrolled trials when compared against\nan active Placebo and why aren't these\nfindings more widely known you know I'm\nnot sure but I doubt it could have\nanything to do with the fact that there\nis an entire rationale for a\nmulti-billion dollar industry that is\npredicated on the validity of that\nhypothesis but I digress the point here\nis that anti-depressants are one of the\ninevitable consequences of considering\ndepression to exist in the brain of the\ndepressed individual and the second way\nthis fallacy manifests itself is in the\nbelief that depression exists in the\nmind of the depressed individual we\ncould call this the cognitive hypothesis\nwhich maintains that depression is\ncaused by the presence of certain\ndistorted beliefs about the self in the\nworld if these thoughts and beliefs were\nsufficiently restructured or brought\ninto alignment with reality then the\ndepression should diminish significantly\nand if this were true\nit would make sense to restructure\ncertain beliefs like those related to\nthe self-concept or associated with\nself-efficacy using individual\nPsychotherapy and this isn't entirely\nwrong Psychotherapy especially cognitive\nbehavioral therapy is associated with a\nreduction in depressive symptoms what's\nmore these reductions are typically more\nenduring than any reductions associated\nwith psychiatric medications that means\nthat folks tend to derive a protective\nbenefit from therapy even after it is\ndiscontinued that they don't derive from\nPharmaceuticals after they are\ndiscontinued and certain therapeutic\ninterventions might be necessary though\nperhaps not entirely sufficient to\neliminating depression for instance it\nis extremely difficult if not impossible\nto recover from depression while the\ncritical inner voice is still active and\nhighly engaged and Psychotherapy can\nsignificantly help to silence this\nInsidious inject in any case the point\nhere is that individual Psychotherapy is\none of the inevitable consequences of\nconsidering depression to exist in the\nmind of the depressed individual now\nbefore I go any further if you're liking\nwhat you're hearing please consider\nsending this episode to someone who\nmight benefit from its message because\nit's Word of Mouth referrals

make\nall this happen I really appreciate it\nthank you I will also soon be starting a\nweekly newslet letter so if you want to\nopt in you can do so on my website and\nfinally if you're thinking of going to\ngrad school it's that season check out\nmy top rated GRE study program at\nStellar JRE Stellar\ng.com I wrote all the content it's the\nbest s the market you're going to love\nit okay so let's get back to it so\nwhat's wrong with the in psychic fallacy\nwell in my opinion it largely ignores\nwhere the L's share of depression comes\nfrom namely people's relationships to\ntheir larger environments of particular\nnote is the fact that depression is\nassociated with being low status in a\nself-relevant dominance\nhierarchy life is hard at the bottom of\nthe latter low status individuals are\nmore likely to have limited if any\noptionality with respect to professional\nopportunities and little to know access\nto sexual relationships they may have\nfew to know friends or close confidants\nthey may be ignored or even reviled by\nthose around them and while it is\npossible strictly speaking to be\npeaceful and contented and resilient at\nthe bottom of the hierarchy it is\nextremely difficult to do so and those\nwho reside at the lowest rungs of these\nhierarchies are typically those least\nequipped with the skills to mitigate the\neffects of their status and guest who\nalways starts out at the bottom of Any\nGiven status hierarchy young men as soon\nas you get out there at 18 you are at\nthe bottom of the barrel that's why\nthat's why this is a particularly\nInsidious disease among young men this\nkind of status oriented\ndepression the fact of the matter is\nthat many people are depressed because\nof the actual state of their lives\nunfortunately the symptoms of depression\ncan keep people mired in this state much\nlonger than is necessary this is not\nonly because depression is unjustifiably\npessimistic or even hopeless about the\nfuture and so inappropriately assumes\nthat the way things are is the way\nthey're always going to be but because\ndepression is associated with behavioral\ninertia which makes constructive\nconservative effort to alter the\nunfavorable state of things less likely\nas well however I'm here to tell you\nthat moving up status hierarchies is one\nof the most reliable ways of becoming\nless depressed for the simple reason\nthat life doesn't suck quite so much\nwhen you're not at the bottom of the\nbarrel this is probably why the\nintervention that is most consistently\nassociated with the alleviation of\ndepression in the literature is\nbehavioral\nactivation actually getting out there\nand doing something different when\npeople change what they do over and\nabove changing the thoughts inside their\nminds or the chemicals inside their\nbrains they stand their best possible\nchance of influencing their positioning\nwithin any given status hierarchy and\ntheir relationship to their larger\nenvironment among other things this\nthese increases in status can make life\nsignificantly more comfortable Pleasant\nand rewarding and while it is certainly\nstill possible to be depressed when life\nis comfortable Pleasant and rewarding\nit's probably a good idea to first rule\nout the possibility that the depression\nis caused by life being uncomfortable\nunpleasant and\nunrewarding like are you depressed or\nare you lonely are you depressed or are\nyou unfulfilled are you depressed or are\nyou\nundisciplined loneliness unfulfillment\nand a lack of discipline are not\ndiseases so why would you go to a\nmedical doctor to fix\nthem in any case it's always a good idea\nto rule out the confounds first what do\nyou think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel you may also\nconsider
