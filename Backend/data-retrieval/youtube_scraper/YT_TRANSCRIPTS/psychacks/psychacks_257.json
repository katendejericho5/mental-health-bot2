    "transcript": "what you have to understand is that if a\nwoman leaves she takes with her\neverything you've ever given her the\nonly thing she loses when she walks away\nis that which she wants and hasn't yet\nreceived what keeps a woman in a\nrelationship is what she hasn't gotten\nyet this and only this do they lose when\nthey leave this is why as a man it's\nalways essential that you remain future\nfocused whatever woman you're dealing\nwith needs to be looking forward to\nsomething that she wants and that she\nhasn't yet received and that's also why\nit's a good idea to draw out what you\ngive her as long as possible you do not\nwant to paint yourself into a corner by\ngiving her everything that she wants too\nsoon because once she has everything\nthat she wants what can you possibly\ngive her and a woman who does not expect\nany future benefit from a man is not\ngoing to stick around just like you are\nprobably not going to stick around to\nspend the rest of your career in a dead-\nend job"
