    "transcript": "a lot of women unfortunately can snatch\ndefeat from the jaws of success by doing\none thing and that one thing is\ndisrespecting men this is what I call\nthe unbreakable rule a woman can never\never ever allow herself to disrespect\nthe man that she wants to be in a\nlong-term committed relationship with\nand there's a number of reasons for that\nbut one of the least appreciated ones is\nthat if a woman allows herself to\ndisrespect this man and he allows that\nas well then over time the dynamic of\nthat relationship will shift to the\npoint where that woman is functionally\nwith a shell of a man that is no longer\na person that she can respect or be\nattracted to and that's generally when\nshe looks for the door"
