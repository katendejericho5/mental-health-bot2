    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nkeep a woman so this is something that\nis very important for men to understand\nespecially men who are considering going\ndown the path of marriage and children\nfor these relationships to succeed it is\nessential that you maintain a woman's\nlong-term commitment this is because the\nmore you invest in any one woman the\nmore leveraged you are in that\nrelationship and the riskier it becomes\nFor You especially in contemporary\nSociety there are no risk-free options\nboys but there are ways to mitigate your\nrisk in a long-term relationship and\ntoday I'm going to be talking about one\nof the easiest ways to keep a woman\naround for the long term if that's what\nyou're interested in doing now this is\ngoing to be a hard pill for many men to\nswallow but the fact of the matter is\nthat everything that you've ever done\nfor a woman is\nirrelevant it does not matter if it's in\nthe past it's gone and this can be very\nfrustrating because some guys have done\na lot for their women they've taken them\nto Fiji and they've bought them a car\nand they've given them a ring and the\nhouse and the kids on their timeline\nthey have done a lot for their women and\nthese men often believe that what they\nhave done somehow entitles them to some\nmeasure of consideration love sex\nrespect or commitment now in the present\nmoment and unfortunately that's not true\nI'm\nsorry on some level I think this is a\nfailure of interex understanding the\nconception of reasonable entitlement is\nhow men think it's not necessarily how\nwomen think if the two of us were at a\nbar and you bought me round the next\ntime you needed a drink I would buy you\nround why because I would feel in some\nsmall way as if I were in your debt and\nI would feel compelled to discharge that\ndebt through equivalent action and this\nis likely because among other things if\nI didn't do that you would eventually\nstop buying me drinks and I might also\nearn a reputation as a sponger and this\ncould detrimentally affect my status in\nour shared Community which has very\nnegative consequences for men now women\nhave their own inex status games but\nthey're not quite the same as men's and\nboth games change in intersexual\nrelationships so inspecting that\nincurred debt reasonably entitles you to\nsome equivalent action from a woman is\nprobably not warranted that's just not\nhow it works with them women are like\nyour\nstomach reminding your stomach that you\nhad dinner last week isn't going to help\nif you're hungry today your stomach\nneeds food\nconstantly and when it hasn't had it in\na while it will painfully remind you of\nthat fact even if you've eaten three\nmeals a day every single day of your\nentire life your stomach will tell you\nwill never tell you that it's had enough\nto get you through whatever time you\nhave\nleft the issue is that no longer how\nlong you've been eating you're going to\nexperience problems if you L don't have\naccess to food and this is especially\nrelevant for men in relationships with\nwomen because\neventually you kind of run out of things\nto give\nher just consider the way things tend to\nprogress along the relationship\nescalator all right I just gave her my\ncommitment now what well then I told her\nI loved her okay what next well I\nsuppose we'll move in together\nokay then what um I guess I can\npropose okay great now what well we'll\nhave a a wedding oh she'll like that now\nwhat uh well I guess I can give her a\nkid or two uhhuh okay and\nthen and\nthen you you don't you don't have\nanything else you may have 50 years of\nlife left my dude and it's precisely at\nthis point when the man is as invested\nas he could possibly be in the\nrelationship that women are subject to\nleaving with the cash and prizes why\nbecause a divorce is the only thing left\nto give her this is not a good position\nfor a man to be in now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nvideo to someone who might benefit from\nits message because it's Word of Mouth\nreferrals like this that really helped\nto make the channel grow you can also\nhit the thanks button and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nderived from this episode I rely on your\nsupport to make all of this happen I\nreally appreciate it I will also soon be\nstarting a Weekly Newsletter so if you'd\nlike to opt in you can do so on my\nwebsite and finally if you're thinking\nof going to grad school check out my\ntoprated gr study program at Stellar\ng.com wrote it all myself you love the\ncontent let's get back to\nit another way to think about this is\nthat everything you have ever given a\nwoman is like safe she can't lose it and\nit can't be taken away from her she\ncan't lose all of those trips and\nholidays her memories can't be taken\nfrom her and all the time and energy and\nmoney that you've spent on her can't\never be refunded all of those things are\nsafely hers because they're in the past\nand so can't ever be taken away what you\nhave to understand is that if a woman\nleaves she takes with her everything\nyou've ever given her the only thing she\nloses when she walks away is that which\nshe wants and hasn't yet\nreceived what keeps a woman in a\nrelationship is what she hasn't gotten\nyet this and only this do they lose when\nthey\nleave this is why as a man it's always\nalways essential that you remain future\nfocused whatever woman you're dealing\nwith needs to be looking forward to\nsomething that she wants and that she\nhasn't yet received and that's also why\nit's a good idea to draw out what you\ngive her as long as possible you do not\nwant to paint yourself into a corner by\ngiving her everything that she wants too\nsoon because once she has everything\nthat she wants what can you Poss\npossibly give her and a woman who does\nnot expect any future benefit from a man\nis not going to stick around just like\nyou are probably not going to stick\naround to spend the rest of your career\nin a dead-end\njob so you have to cultivate desire in\nher for things that she can hope to\nreceive now successful seducers do this\nall the time they call this future\nfaking they paint a woman a beautiful\npicture with their words that they never\never have any intention of fulfilling\nand that's dangerous and low Integrity\neventually if you play with people's\nhopes long enough they get fed up and\nleave so this can't really be an\neffective strategy for keeping a woman\naround longterm though it can and does\nwork for short-term prospects in any\ncase I don't really recommend it so the\ndesires you cultivate should not only be\nthings that she wants because if they\nare things that she doesn't\nwant uh there's no compelling reason for\nher to stay in the relationship anyway\neven if she doesn't have them yet\nbut they should be things that you're\nactually willing and able to fulfill on\na reasonable timeline as well and there\nyou have it to keep a woman around long\nterm you need to cultivate in her\ndesires for things that she might want\nbut hasn't yet received that is her\nincentive to stay in the relationship as\nshe will lose these things and only\nthese things if she chooses to leave I\nwish it were different but that's just\nhow it works with women what do you\nthink does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel you may also\nconsider becoming a channel member
