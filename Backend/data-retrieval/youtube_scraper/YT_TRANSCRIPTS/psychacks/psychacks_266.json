    "transcript": "almost every man has had the experience\nof something he shared with his woman in\ntrust and confidence being used against\nhim in a coral months even years later I\ncall this weaponized intimacy and it is\ndone to inflict a concentrated amount of\nemotional pain for a variety of reasons\nwomen's attacks can also take the form\nof hurtful and untrue statements things\nlike you don't love me or I hate you or\nyou never cared for me at all Etc so\nwhen you're dealing with an actively\nhostile woman the first rule of thumb is\nto not make your situation even worse\nand guys often make the situation even\nworse by becoming defensive\ndefensiveness is tricky because it\nbasically acknowledges the reality of a\nvalid attack so it kind of admits that\nthere is at least some degree of Truth\nto what she is saying that must\ntherefore be responded to"
