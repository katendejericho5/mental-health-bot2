    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is choosing\nbetween two women so this is a subject\nthat actually comes up fairly frequently\nin my consultations with men either the\nman is choosing between two women he's\nbeen dating for a monogamous commitment\nor it's a man choosing between his wife\nand his mistress since I see the same\npatterns of thought arise in all of\nthese discussions I thought I'd make an\nEP episode to address this issue\nproactively unfortunately by the time\nthe guy calls me he's usually fairly\ndistraught and Confused this is because\nhe's in a state of vacillation in the\nsense that he's going back and forth in\nhis mind between option A and option b\ntypically he's comparing the two women\nwith each other sometimes even going so\nfar as to create lists of relative pros\nand cons and this is a problem for a\nnumber of reasons first and foremost the\nman's intelligence creativity and\nproblem solving skills are being\nconstrained by these two options in his\nmind it's either option A or option b\nthat's all he can see however in reality\nthere's option A and option b but also\noption C and D and E F G H I J K L MN\nyou get the idea there's actually a\nwhole bunch of options but because his\nthought process is restricted\nhe can't see them and this limits his\nfreedom of action which is generally to\nhis\ndetriment when a man has the good\nproblem of having multiple women in his\nlife he should never ever under any\ncircumstances ever make the mistake of\ncomparing them with each other besides\nbeing the thief of Joy comparison\ngenerally leads to suboptimal outcomes\nwhy well let's say that in your mind\noption A is slightly better than option\nb that is you compared the two options\nto each other and found option A to be\nsuperior well once you make the decision\noption b evaporates as a basis of\ncomparison and you'll have to deal with\noption A on its own merits and at that\npoint it may not be all that helpful\nthat the option you chose was slightly\nbetter than the option you didn't what's\nimportant is whether the option you\nchose is sufficient with respect to\nwhatever your goals happen to be moving\nforward so never compare option A with\noption b in these situations the\nquestion is not do I go with a or b the\nquestion is do I go with a or not a and\nindependently do I go with b or not B\nlike each relationship should be\nexamined on its own merits and relative\nto your own self relevant\ngoals this will increase the likely Ood\nthat your choice will make sense past\nthe point of decision for some months or\nyears afterwards here's another\nimportant thing to understand the women\nin question might not like this but\nsometimes the resolution to this problem\nis not an either or\nsolution sometimes it's a both and\nsolution and sometimes it's a neither\nnor\nsolution as I've said before roads only\ngo where they go roads are static they\ngo only from point A to point B along\ntheir given route so if option A is a\nroad going north and option b is a road\ngoing west which road are you going to\ntake well that depends on where you want\nto go doesn't it this is why it's\nessential that you not compare the\noptions against each other but against\nyour own goals which is your\ndestination so if you want to go\nSoutheast then you should take neither\nRoad this is because either Road will\nactually take you farther and farther\nfrom where you want to go just because\nthe road is at your feet doesn't mean it\nwill take you where you want to end up\nin some cases you may even need to\nbacktrack a bit because you've gotten so\nlost or turned around but men who have\nbecome too constrained in their thought\nprocesses are subject to forgetting this\nCommon Sense this is why I ask these men\nto consider what they would choose for\nthemselves if they weren't aware of what\neither one of these women\nwanted this is because as long as the\nman is vacillating between these two\noptions he actually exists in the frames\nof these two women\nsimultaneously now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom its message because it's Word

the\ndescription below please give them a\ngander that's how you can support this\nChannel and its Mission okay let's get\nback to\nit so what does this mean that a man\nexists in the frames of two women\nsimultaneously well let's say that the\nman is uh let's say that the wife is\ndemanding the man leave his mistress and\nstay with her and that the mistress is\ndemanding the man leave his wife and\nstay with her not only does this insist\non a mutually exclusive decision that\nmay not necessarily be required but in\nhis mindset the man's entire range of\noptionality is either to give woman a\nwhat she wants or woman B what she wants\nlike what about what the man wants the\nchoice is not between wife or mistress\nthis is a product of the women\ncontrolling the discussion the choice is\nactually between the wife or no wife\nlike will the wife helped the man go\nwhere he wants to go and between the\nmistress and no mistress that is will\nthe mistress help the man go where he\nwants to go and this can be hard for men\nbecause many of them haven't thought\nabout what they want in quite some time\nthis is because they have gotten so in\nthe habit of serving their women and\nthey have gotten so comfortable existing\nin their women's frames I did a\nconsultation with a man the other day\nwho had been married for 30 years and he\ncouldn't tell me what he wanted\napparently no had asked or cared to ask\nfor decades he was just so used to being\nmarried and Catering to the demands and\ninterests and preferences of his wife\nthat he kind of no longer existed as an\nindependent person capable of\nself-directed thought and while the\nwomen out there might not see any\nproblem with this I imagine my male\naudience might think very differently so\nif option A goes north and option b goes\nwest then neither option is particularly\nuseful if you want to go Southeast on\nthe other hand if you want to go\nNorthwest well you can make use of both\nroads can't you head West and north and\nwest and north and west or you can seek\nout a third option that heads Northwest\nin a straightforward manner turns out\nthere are actually plenty of Roads so\nit's important not to be constrained by\na false dichotomy and to make your\ndecision in the context of your\noverarching goals at the end of the day\nchoosing between two women is a good\ngood problem to have that's because it's\na problem of abundance and optionality\nas opposed to a problem of scarcity and\nlimitation so nice work however what\nmakes this problem so difficult for the\nmajority of men is that they're not used\nto having this problem they're not used\nto having abundance and optionality with\nwomen so they still approach the\ndecision with a scarcity mentality and\nscarcity mentality is always more\nfocused on minimizing loss than it is on\nmaximizing gain which can lead to all\nkinds of suboptimal outcomes hopefully\nthis helped disabuse some of you of that\nscarcity mentality what do you think\ndoes this fit with your own experience\nlet me know in the comments below as\nalways I appreciate your support and\nthank you for listening"
