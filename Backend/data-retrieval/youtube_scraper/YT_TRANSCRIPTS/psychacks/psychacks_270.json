    "transcript": "it's been very well documented and I\nthink all men understand this on like a\ngut level that women will do more things\nfaster with in the bedroom with men that\nthey like and they're attracted to than\nwith men that they are not and so when a\nwoman is the nastiest version\nof herself possible what she's\nfunctionally communicating with her\nbehavior which is the only thing that\nreally matters not with her words but\nwith her actions that you are the most\ndesirable man I've ever met and I am\nwilling to break the rules for you that\nI strongly rigidly enforce with all\nother men and that's going to play to a\nman's ego which is a trap for men but\nwomen should absolutely use that to\ntheir advantage whenever possible I mean\nAll is fair in Love and War right uh\nthat's going to make the man feel like\nhe's a king of the budo uh he's going to\nfeel like it's going to put him in his\nmasculine and he feels that there is a\nbeautiful woman who is sexually\nsubmissive to him it triggers his\ninstinct to protect and to provide"
