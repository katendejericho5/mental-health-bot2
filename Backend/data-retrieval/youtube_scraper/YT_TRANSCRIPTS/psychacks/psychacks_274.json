    "transcript": "and the fact of the matter is is that\nsex in today's Marketplace is extremely\ncheap it's cheap because sex must now\nprecede commitment it's changed in the\nlast 60 years and the main instigator of\nthe change was birth control the reason\nwhy commitment had to precede sex for so\nlong is because the threat of pregnancy\nalways loomed large and in that day it\nwas extremely difficult if not\nimpossible for a woman to earn her own\nmoney and to survive in society without\nthe pro protection or provision of a man\nor a governmental program that served as\nits surrogate and all of those things\nhave changed the reason why commit\ncommitment was required before sex was\nbecause the stakes of a woman becoming\npregnant outside of marriage were\nextremely high and it was upheld\nsocially because if that man couldn't be\npersuaded or coerced to commit then that\nsingle unwed mother and her children\nwould have become society's problem"
