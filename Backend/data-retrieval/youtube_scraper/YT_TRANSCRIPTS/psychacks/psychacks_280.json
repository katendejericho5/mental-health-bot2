    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nsave your mind this is an extremely\nimportant subject and I hope that this\nmessage reaches a good number of people\ngiven some realities with respect to\nhuman cognitive development your mind\nneeds saving no matter who you are and\nthe stakes of not saving your mind both\nindividually and socially are extreme\nhigh so let's not waste any time here's\nthe situation every human being only\narrives at the point of full physical\nmaturity at age 25 and full emotional or\npsychological maturity if that ever\nhappens occurs even later the upshot is\nthat most people can't even begin to\nthink for themselves critically and\nindependently until they are at least\nthis old the issue is that by the time\nyou reach this age your head is so full\nof that you can't even think\nstraight irrespective of your beliefs to\nthe contrary and this was put\nin your head as it were without your\npermission through such a subtle and\nintimate process that on some level you\ncouldn't prevent it from happening even\nif you wanted to you lacked the\nawareness and the experience and the Cy\nological capacity to resist it this\nmeans by the time you get to 25 years\nold your head is full of facts beliefs\nand attitudes put there by your parents\nand your teachers and your priests and\nyour government and your media and your\nfriends and your culture your mind is\nliterally full of thoughts that are not\nyour own but that you might identify\nwith in fact it may not be an\nexaggeration to say that at this point\nyou may not possess a single original\nthought you may never have had the\nchance to think one any spare room you\nmay have had for such a cognition could\nhave been filled Years Ago by some\nnonsense bit of cultural trivia like an\nadvertising jingle or some fact that\nyour teachers forced you to memorize\nthat while technically true is just as\nobviously worthless like the capitals\nand these are some of the less harmful\noffenders many of the thoughts in your\nhead are wrong like objectively and even\nmore of them are useless even if they're\nnot necessarily\nfalse what this means is that every\nperson usually around 30 years of age\nhas the opportunity to start waking up\nbut they only find themselves in like a\nhoarder's house a house full of crap in\nreality they've been living in this\nhouse for years but they've only\nrecently become sufficiently aware of\ntheir situation to consider that their\nliving conditions might be\ncircumstantial as opposed to inherent to\nreality in any case they begin to\nunderstand that their house is cramped\nand dingy and full of stuff that came\nfrom God knows where now if you know\nanything about hoarders you know that it\ncan be very very difficult for them to\ndisabuse themselves of their things why\nbecause they have all of these emotional\nconnections to their junk an old scrap\nof paper might be a tether to a\nrelationship that is long since ended\nsome expired medication might be useful\nagain sometime in the future these\nemotional bonds with their objects\nprevent hoarders from taking appropriate\naction the same thing is true with the\nfacts beliefs and attitudes that were\nput into your mind by other people the\nreason why it is difficult to let go of\nthese things is that you have emotional\nattachments to these things even if it's\nnot true this is an attitude that came\nfrom your dad even though it's not\nhelpful this is a fact that came from\nyour teacher Etc and the most common\nemotional attachment that people have\nwith the in their minds is that\nit is right\nhowever in the vast majority of cases\nright doesn't mean right it means this\nis how my family did it or this is what\nwe were supposed to do at the time you\nget me now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause its Word of Mouth were FRS like\nthis that really helped to make the\nchannel grow you can also tip me in\nproportion to the value you you feel\nyou've received from this message to do\nthat you can go to my website and donate\nto me directly through venmo that way I\nget all of your donation I don't do\ncorporate sponsorships or product\nplacements so I depend on your help to\nmake all this happen I really appreciate\nit thank\nyou fortunately there is a way out of\nthis situation but just like emptying\nout a house full of junk it is going to\ntake some time after all if it took you\n30 years to accumulate all of this\n it could very well take the\nrest of your life to divest yourself of\nwhat was put there against your will\nhowever if you don't do this you're kind\nof because you will never really\nbecome well you an individual person if\nyou don't do this you will simply be a\ncipher a pasti of your culture and the\nidiosyncrasies of a particular\nhistorical moment that will be your life\nyou might not be miserable or\nunfulfilled if you don't empty out the\n because only individuals can\ntruly be miserable or unfulfilled but\nyou might spend your whole life with a\nvague nagging hunch that something\ndoesn't feel right or something is\nmissing but because you never learned to\nthink for yourself you might never learn\nwho you are so you won't be able to do\nanything about this feeling beyond what\nyour culture prescribes for the\nindiscriminate masses alcohol streaming\nservices psychiatric medication\nprofessional sports shopping and sex you\nwill have lived your whole life without\never learning who you were so the way\nout of this process is akin to dealing\nwith a hoarder except you'll be dealing\nwith cognitions not material things\nyou'll need to to turn your attention\nInward and slowly carefully examine each\nindividual thought one by one ask\nyourself some questions where did this\ncome from is it true is it useful will\nthis serve me in who I want to be and\nwhere I want to go hang on to the things\nthat are true and useful and that\nsupport the person you want to be\neverything else thank them for their\nservice such as was and let them go you\nwant to simplify and clarify your mind\nas much as you want to simplify and\nclarify your actual living space this\ncould take years however over time\nlittle by little you may arrive at a\npoint in which the majority of your\nmind's contents is there with your\nconscious permission and at your\nconscious pleasure this is long\nlaborious work but there's no way around\nit fortunately the more more you do this\nthe better you get at assessing things\naccurately and the easier it becomes to\ndiscard things that no longer serve you\nand of course once you start on the path\nof decluttering your mind of\nyou're going to want to like restrict\nthe flow of new facts beliefs and\nattitudes coming in at the very least\nyou'll want to install a kind of valve\nto control your intake of information in\nour culture people can be obsessed with\ndiet but they limit their\nconceptualization of this idea to what\ngoes in their mouths as opposed to what\ngoes in their minds and frankly what\ngoes into people's minds is far more\nimportant than what goes into their\nmouths if for no other reason that what\ngoes into people's minds controls what\npeople put in their mouths and not the\nother way\naround I personally stopped watching the\nnews like 16 years ago and here I am a\nI'm I'm a perfectly functioning human\nbeing and I don't just mean watching the\nnews on like the Legacy Media I mean\nwatching the news on news sites or\nYouTube or Reddit or social media\nLinkedIn Tik Tok Twitter Facebook I\ndon't have any of these apps on my phone\nI upload my content on a third party\nplatform so that I don't have to touch\nthese apps directly after I expended\nyears and years of conscious effort to\nexpel most of the from my head\nI don't want any new rushing in\nto take its place understand and media\nespecially social media is far far more\ndangerous than most people think so if\nyou want to save your mind if you want\nto go through the timec consuming\nprocess of actually becoming an\nindividual you need to go through the\nvery personal and very challenging\nprocess of carefully examining the\ncontents of your Consciousness and be\nwilling to divest yourself of that which\nis no longer true and or useful once you\ndo that I guarantee you will be much\nmore discriminating with respect to any\nnew unexamined belief or attitude that\nhappens to present itself to you on your\nwalk through life what do you think does\nthis fit with your own experience let me\nknow in the comments below and if you've\ngotten this far you might as well like\nthis episode And subscribe to this\nchannel you may also becoming consider\nbecoming a channel member with perks\nlike the
