    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is what to\ndo if you are bored in a relationship\nnow this advice applies equally to all\nkinds of relationships it will work in a\nplatonic relationship or a familial\nrelationship or a romantic relationship\nand it's actually very simple I\nguarantee it's something that you can do\nright away as you are at absolutely\nno expense just like solving any other\nproblem if you want to stop feeling\nbored in a relationship all you need to\ndo is change your behavior with respect\nto the underlying causal issue so why\nare you feeling bored what is the\nunderlying causal issue I guarantee that\nin every relationship in which you have\never felt bored you have felt bored\nbecause the two of you for whatever\nreason stopped telling each other the\ntruth so the solution to any\nrelationship plagued by boredom is to\nstart telling the truth I assure you if\nyou start telling the truth you won't be\nbored for very long and I don't mean\ntell the truth in the sense of some\nobjective Universal wisdom I mean tell\nthe truth in the sense of your personal\nlived experience\nif you are bored in your marriage go up\nto your wife open your mouth and say I'm\nbored with our marriage lately I've been\nfantasizing about having an affair or\ngetting a divorce or just going out for\ncigarettes and never coming back and\nthat's because the only other emotion I\ncan remember feeling recently besides\nboredom is a vague sense of dread that\nI'm going to spend the rest of what\ncould be the only life I'm ever going to\nhave suffocating in a middling lukewarm\nexistence of comfort and\ncomplacency guess what your marriage\nisn't going to be boring anymore and\nthat's because depending on the\nemotional maturity of your partner\nyou're either going to fight well if\nthat's how you feel just pack your bags\nand go or you're going to feel like\nlarger and more present which will be a\nrelief because you're bringing more of\nyourself to the relationship\nI had no idea you felt that way or\nyou're going to learn that there's still\nplenty that you don't know about this\nother person oh I'm so glad that you\nsaid that I thought I was the only\none however no matter the outcome your\nexperience of the relationship will have\nshifted significantly and you may no\nlonger be able to rely on your old\nscripts and evasions the truth is out\nand must be cont ended with and while\npotentially uncomfortable this is\nprobably better than any other\nalternative now some of you might be\nthinking oh no thanks Orion I think I'd\nprefer boredom to potential conflict and\nit's like fair enough people need to\nchoose their battles maybe the boredom\nwasn't all that bad and you need to\nlearn how to tolerate a modum of it in\nyour\nrelationships on the other hand perhaps\nyou tolerate boredom because it's the\nemotional consequence of a c-dependent\ncompromise\nsolution many people actually don't want\nto know the truth because if they knew\nthe truth they might have to actually do\nsomething about it which Beyond just\nrequiring effort might very well be\npainful and discomforting besides and\nthis is why people who start telling the\ntruth are almost universally punished by\ntheir communities to begin with the\ntruth creates a necessity for change\nwhich is uncomfortable and expensive and\npotentially something no one else asked\nfor the truth might also require giving\nup certain benefits or privileges that\ninhere in the status quo this often\nproduces a kind of implied understanding\nbetween the people in the relationship\nnamely I'm not really going to show up\nor ask about your truth and you're not\nreally going to show up or ask about my\ntruth and we're both going to pretend\nthat neither one of us knows about\neither one of us knowing about this\nArrangement neither person wants to go\nthrough the trouble of changing that the\ntruth would\nnecessitate but neither person is\nwilling to forgo the benefits and\nsecurity of the relationship by\njeopardizing the compromise solution it\nrepresents now before I go any further\nif you're liking what you're hearing\nplease consider sending this episode to\nsomeone who might benefit from its\nmessage because it's Word of Mouth\nreferrals like this that really help to\nmake the channel grow you can also tip\nme in proportion to the value you feel\nyou've derived from this episode you can\ndo that by going to my website and\ndonating to me directly through venmo I\nreally appreciate your support it's\ndonations like that that help keep all\nthis going thank you very\nmuch so that that's how people end up\nbored in their relationships they rely\nmore and more on scripts and roles and\nkind of end up just going through the\nmotions the relationship is maintained\nbut there is a distinct absence of\nemotional intimacy and this not only\ncreates boredom it creates loneliness\ncontrary to popular belief loneliness\nisn't caused by being alone it's caused\nby being around people who you cannot\nconnect with emotionally this is why in\nmy opinion the loneliest place in the\nworld is New York City no matter where\nyou go you're surrounded by people who\nwon't even look you in the eye and the\nloneliest I personally have ever felt in\nmy life was sleeping next to a woman who\ndidn't see me for who I was so the idea\nhere is to start\ntelling the truth to\npeople with whom you're in close\npersonal relationship as best you can\nbut that doesn't mean the full\nunvarnished truth the full unvarnished\ntruth is like looking straight at the\nsun no one can really take too much of\nthat and here's the thing very often\ntelling people the unvarnished truth is\nactually a different form of\nhiding those who have no censor and just\nspeak their truth all the time irresp\nperspective of other people's feelings\nmight be hiding from their own\nsuppressed dependency and the degree to\nwhich they need relationships for their\nown Survival and well-being they hide\nalso from their own gentler feelings\nfeelings like kindness or Compassion or\nbenevolence and thereby live in a\nfalsified version of reality now this\ndoesn't mean we should lie to spare\nsomeone else's feelings though to be\nhonest that\ncan be called for from time to time it\nmeans we should strive to find ways to\ntell the\ntruth in ways that other people can hear\nwithout feeling\nbrutalized also telling the truth is\nless about revealing your deep dark\nsecrets and more about sharing your\nactual lived emotional experience which\nis the ultimate substance of Our Lives\nthis sharing is not really a Litany of\nfacts first this happened to me then\nthis this than that but a willingness to\ncommunicate your internal experience and\nthis is because in order to be loved you\nhave to risk being known people can only\nlove to the depth of their understanding\nanything beyond that is an infatuation\nbased on projected fantasy you will make\nyour connections infinitely more vital\nby bringing that emotional immediacy\nback into your relationships\nemotions are like the weather like the\nweather they're connected to the\neverchanging present moment and they're\nindispensible to The NeverEnding process\nof growth Decay and renewal that is\nisomorphic with nature a relationship\nwithout emotions would be like a planet\nwithout an atmosphere static and\nsuffocating and one of the names we give\nthis sense of Suffocation is boredom so\nif you've been feeling this in the\ncontext of your close relationships it\nmight be time to bring more of your\nlived experience into these Dynamics and\nyou can start with your experience of\nfeeling\nbored what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know in\nthe comments below and if you've gotten\nthis far you might as well like this\nepisode And subscribe to this channel\nyou may also consider becoming a channel\nmember with perks like the priority\nreview of comments or
