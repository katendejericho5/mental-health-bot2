    "transcript": "virtue can only make you good and you\nmight think well what's the problem with\nthat Orion well the problem is that most\npeople don't want to be good most people\nwant to be liked or to be rich or to be\nsuccessful or to be beautiful or to be\nfunny or to be famous or to be strong\nEtc and they inappropriately expect that\nbeing good will get them these other\nthings just like in the fairy tale the\ngood guy wins so they think that being\ngood help them achieve romantic success\nor become rich and prosperous or even\nearn them protection from adversity\nthrough some sort of divine intervention\nand For Better or For Worse none of\nthese things are true like good people\noften don't get the girl and good\npeople's businesses fail and good people\nget cancer being virtuous doesn't get\nyou anything outside of itself which is\none of the underappreciated meanings in\nthe adage virtue is its own reward"
