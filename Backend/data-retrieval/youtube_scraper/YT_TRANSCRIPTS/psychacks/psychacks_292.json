    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is virtue\nonly makes you good so today I'll be\ntalking about virtue what it can do and\njust as important what it can't first\nlet me offer a definition my definition\nof virtue is that it is a positive\nspiritual attribute it is spiritual\nbecause if you use it you have more of\nit as opposed to material which if you\nuse you have less of and it's positive\nbecause it's associated with what\nsustains life as opposed to negative\nwhich is associated with what destroys\nit so that's my personal definition of\nvirtue a positive spiritual attribute\nnow a lot of people start out on the\npath of virtue when they're young but\nmost end up diverted from that path by\nthe time they hit middle age they may\neven grow suspicious or simp cynical of\nvirtue over time potentially considering\nit to be a naive Pursuit for those who\ndon't yet understand the way the world\nreally works why is this transformation\nso common I think that there are a\nnumber of factors in play in the first\nplace almost everyone has to learn the\nhard way that things are not always what\nthey seem to be and that evil or sin\ntypically does not have a grotesque Vis\nand a threatening glare rather these\nthings are usually obscured beneath a\ncloak of light that allows them some\nmeasure of protection to continue to\nexist in the world people who never\nfully recover from this deception often\ncome to doubt the utility if not the\nvery existence of goodness or\nvirtue however there's another possible\nexplanation that I want to focus on\ntoday namely that this tendency toward\ncynicism is due to a misunderstanding\nabout the nature of virtue and about\nwhat virtue can provide and I think that\nif this misunderstanding were dispelled\nmore people might persist on the path of\nvirtue longer which is actually a very\ngood thing this is because it's one of\nthe few goals in life that is inherently\nfulfilling and that because progress\nhere is associated with some very\nsignificant positives which will explain\nlater in this episode so I do believe\nthat it is important to cultivate virtue\nbut here's the thing it turns out that\nvirtue can only make you good and you\nmight think well what's the problem with\nthat Orion well the problem is that most\npeople don't want to be good most people\nwant to be liked or to be rich or to be\nsuccessful or to be beautiful or to be\nfunny or to be famous or to be strong\nEtc and they inappropriately expect that\nbeing good will get them these other\nthings just like in the fairy tale the\ngood guy wins so they think that being\ngood will help them achieve romantic\nsuccess or become rich and prosperous or\neven earn them protection from adversity\nthrough some sort of divine intervention\nand For Better or For Worse none of\nthese things are true like good people\noften don't get the girl and good\npeople's businesses fail and good people\nget cancer like being virtuous doesn't\nget you anything outside of itself which\nis one of the underappreciated meanings\nin the adage virtue is its own reward\nit's like yeah because you don't get\nanything else from it you dum dum and\neventually what happens is that people\nreach some degree of awareness with\nrespect to the limits of virtue they\nrealize that doesn't pay their bills or\nget them laid or keep them safe or make\nthem popular and they think well what\nthe good is that and the upshot is\nthat people frustrated by virtue's\ninability to help them get what they\nactually want end up giving up on virtue\nin favor of other worldly Pursuits and\nthat's because again virtue doesn't make\nyou rich or earn you friends or get you\nlaid in fact many virtuous people tend\nto be lonely and unsuccessful why\nbecause a lot of people dislike good\npeople the very existence of good people\nmakes them feel bad about themselves\nwhich is often why good people are\nshunned and persecuted and this of\ncourse can cause good people over time\nto succumb to bitterness and resentment\nover others unfair treatment of them now\nbefore I go any further if you're liking\nwhat you're hearing please consider\nsending this episode to someone who\nmight benefit from its message because\nit's Word of Mouth referrals like this\nthat really help to make the channel\ngrow you can also go to my website and\ndonate to my\ncause in proportion to the value that\nyou feel that you've derived from this\nepisode I rely on your support to keep\nall of this running and I really\nappreciate it thank you very\nmuch now turning to worldly Pursuits is\nisn't necessarily a problem like don't\ntake your grocery list to the hardware\nstore if you want to get laid don't\nlearn virtue learn game if you want to\nmake money don't lose virtue learn a\nvaluable skill Etc the problem here is\nnot with virtue itself but in expecting\nmore from virtue than it can possibly\ndeliver that said even though virtue\ncan't provide the things that most\npeople most want it is still very useful\nto cultivate virtue for two important\nreasons in the first place virtue is\nimportant to cultivate because even\nthough it can't reliably get you worldly\nGoods it can help you to keep them\ngenerals understand that there is little\npoint in capturing a castle they cannot\nkeep like why go through the risk and\nexpense of securing a positive if you\ncannot retain it long enough to provide\nyou benefit the same is true of the good\nthings in life if you're fortunate\nenough to find yourself rich in worldly\nGoods loving relationships successful\nbusinesses positive reputation then you\nwill need virtue to keep these worldly\nGoods in your life if you don't have\nsome virtue already you're going to\nit up because you won't be able to\nhandle your good fortune with prudence\nand dignity for many people people the\nabsolute worst thing that could possibly\nhappen to them is to suddenly become\nrich and famous suddenly becoming rich\nand famous without virtue to temper the\nexperience is more dangerous than heroin\nand people die from this experience all\nthe time their Good Fortune kills them\nso unless you want to go through life\navoiding worldly goods and where's the\nsense in that you need to find ways to\nsustainably enjoy them and cultivating\nsome degree of virtue enables you to\nretain the good things in life that you\nhave succeeded in achieving through\nother\nmeans and in the second place virtue is\nimportant to cultivate because even\nthough it can't guarantee a positive\noutcome it can help you overcome the\ninevitable negative outcomes that you\nwill experience in life for example when\nwe have some measure of say patience we\ndon't have have to work so hard to avoid\nbeing inconvenienced because we have the\nmeans of neutralizing the negative\nconsequences of that inconvenience\nnamely patience or when we have some\nmeasure of say compassion we don't have\nto work so hard to avoid being judged\nbecause we have the means of\nneutralizing the negative consequences\nof that judgment namely compassion the\ngreat thing about cultivating virtue is\nthat those who have it no longer longer\nneed to hope and pray for an easy life\nbecause they've since developed the\nmeans of dealing with whatever life is\nsubject to throwing at them and this\nmight not make them rich or popular or\nattractive but it might make them\nindestructible from fortunes good and\nbad what do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this
