    "transcript": "for me one of the issues when I was in\nmy 20s was trying to make relationships\nthe center of my life it sounds like\nthat's related to what you were\ndescribing now I think a relationship is\nit's very important but it's secondary\nto let's say my personal mission what\nI'm here to do in life you know it was\nback in the old ad copy for krison\ncommand I've since taken it out but it\nwas the fundamental line was you know\nrelationships are everything and I think\nthat was reflective of my own honest\nperspective at the time but a\ndysfunctional one and the lack of\nindependent\nself-directedness and self- okayness and\nself-love created this whole coping\nmechanism which spawned a company which\nspond to the whole lifestyle and all of\nthese other sorts of things from it but\nI I very much agree that uh as I have\ndone more self-healing I see the the\npressure that I put on relationships the\nneed that I have for them dissipates\nwhich actually creates space for what\nwe're talking about which seems like\ngenuine love space sunshin type energy"
