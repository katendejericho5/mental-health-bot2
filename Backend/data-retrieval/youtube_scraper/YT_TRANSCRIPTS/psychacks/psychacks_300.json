    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is politics\nand sexual withholding so I'm going to\nbegin this episode by briefly relating\nan anecdote from my own personal dating\nhistory I have spent the last 13 years\nliving in the San Francisco Bay area\nwhich is something of the belly of the\nbeast when it comes to Progressive\npolitics and ideological feminism now\nnot all women here subscribe to these\nbelief systems but a lot of them do\nand more than once I've been punished\nwith sexual withholding for wrong think\nthat misaligned with these systems it's\nalso something I see occurring more and\nmore frequently in the lives of my\nclients here's the anecdote I once\nbriefly dated a librarian the first few\ndates went well and we ended up back at\nher place each time it wasn't until the\nthird or fourth date that she came back\nto my apartment and when she came over\nshe saw my bookcases now I'm pretty\nproud of my library which itself\nrepresents presents just a fraction of\nthe books that I've read and I figured\nthis would go over well with a\nlibrarian I was wrong as she reviewed my\nbooks she commented disparagingly that\nthere were more male authors than female\nauthors in my library she went on to\ndisclose that representation for female\nauthors in the publishing industry was a\nvery important social cause for her as a\nlibrarian and she asked that I read more\nbooks written by women\nI was taken aback I mean it's true that\nmost of the books I read are written by\nmen but due to the amount that I read\nit's also true that I read more books\nwritten by women than most people read\nbooks so I pointed that out and\nexplained to her that I read books based\non what interests me as opposed to say\nthe gender of the author and that I\ndidn't believe I had a social\nresponsibility to read books that didn't\ninterest me just so that certain\ndemographics could be more widely read I\nalso noted that while I could support\nher in her social cause it wasn't\nsomething I was going to take on myself\nsince I have causes of my own and it\nwould take time energy and focus away\nfrom the things that I personally care\nabout I'm not against your cause I\nexplained but I'm not going to actively\nChampion it for you and apparently this\nwas an unacceptable response suddenly I\nwas a misogynist and a sexist and an\noppressor Etc suffice it to say we did\nnot see each other again\nand that was no skin off my back of\ncourse however I've encountered\ncomparable situations multiple times\nover the course of my dating history in\nthe cases of these particular women\nanything less than perfect alignment\nwith their ideology was considered to be\na personal threat to be punished and\ncondemned when this happens on mass men\nwho espouse wrong think are weeded out\nof the dating scene and men who are\naligned with the dominant ideology are\nafforded reproductive opportunities this\nis the nature of things when sex becomes\na consciously political act I call the\ntactic of withholding sex for a\npolitical end the listrada protocol for\nthose who aren't familiar listrada is a\nvery readable very funny Greek comedy\nwritten by the playwright\nAristophanes who was a man it relates a\nhypothetical retelling of the pelian war\nin which the Greek women sick and tired\nof how long the war was taking came\ntogether and took a solemn oath to\ncompletely withhold all sexual access\nfrom their husbands until they ended the\nconflict the rest of the play depicts\nhow this strategy unfolds ultimately\nafter many unsuccessful attempts to\nbreak through the women's defenses the\nmen eventually give in and end the war\nthe moral is that women can effectively\ndictate social policy by withholding\nsexual access not much has changed in\n2500 years now before I go any further\nif you're liking what you're hearing\nplease consider sending this

this\nthat help me do all of this keep the\nlights on uh and grow the channel I\nreally appreciate your support and thank\nyou for your help\nnow for better or worse things don't\nquite work in reality like they do in a\nplay and why is that well in L Estrada\nevery single woman in Greece maintained\na consistent and unanimous front against\nthe men's attempts to break through\ntheir sexual embargo and this was\npossible in part because this was a\nrelatively small community however in\nreality this is not going to be possible\nsome women might maintain a consistent\nfront\nbut a lot of them won't and this is\nbecause given the intersexual\ncompetition between women for men\nespecially desirable high value men in\nthe sexual Marketplace one woman's\nwithholding is another woman's\nopportunity the more women remove\nthemselves from the market on\nideological grounds the more advantagous\nit is for the women who\nremain this is not only because those\nwho M will have fewer other women\nagainst whom to compete but because they\nwill become increasingly valuable as the\navailable supply of women declines as\nwell with this in mind we can understand\nthat a woman's best strategy with\nrespect to these social movements is to\nencourage as many other women as\npossible to withdraw from the sexual\nMarketplace either by means of the list\nEstrada protocol or by making themselves\nless appealing to to men while\ncontinuing to remain clandestinely in\nthe sexual Marketplace themselves sneaky\nsneaky right and I think that's why a\nlot of the women who openly support and\nencourage and celebrate women who say\ncut off and dye their hair or get\ntattoos and piercings or denounce the\npatriarchy and vilify men don't do so\nthemselves H the more women who withdraw\nfrom the Marketplace in ideological\ngrounds and the more women who make\nthemselves less attractive for\nideological reasons the better able the\nremaining women will be to compete\nsuccessfully for the dwindling pool of\ndesirable men keep in mind that these\nmotivations don't have to be conscious\nin order to exert their\ninfluence if women really thought it was\nbrave and strong and courageous to\nbehave in certain ways in the sexual\nMarketplace then in the absence of any\nimpediment to enacting those behaviors\nthemselves why don't they all behave\nthat way well leaving aside normal\nvariations in preferences and\npersonality it's because not all women\nare that\ndumb seen through the lens of\nevolutionary psychology women who\nwithdraw from the sexual Marketplace or\nmake themselves less attractive on\nideological grounds are the dupes who\nwere deceived by the positive\nreinforcement of their intersexual\ncompetition they exchange their\nreproductive success for the praise of\ntheir\ncompetitors in any case the lstr\nprotocol is an inept sexual strategy\nbecause it won't ever be possible to\nsecure a unified front among all women\nand this is because one woman's\nwithdrawal is another woman's\nopportunity and this strategy is fairly\nself-correcting like it won't ever\nsucceed in becoming the dominant\nmethodology in an open and diverse\nsexual Marketplace for the simple reason\nthat women who practice this strategy\naggressively rarely succeed in the game\nof mating and dating what do you think\ndoes this fit with
