    "transcript": "it's very difficult to pull the plug on\na nonfunctional relationship in which\nyou've already invested a great deal of\ntime energy and money like it's going to\nbe painful it's going to hurt and it may\nhurt for a while it's not something that\nyou will immediately get over and no one\nis enthusiastic about entering into a\npainful situation I get it but the other\nside of this is as hard as it's going to\nbe it will never be easier to go through\nwith it than it is\ntoday like the reason why it's going to\nbe hard is because you've invested so\nmuch time energy and money and the\nlonger you hesitate the longer you\nprocrastinate that decision the more\ntime energy and money you continue to\ninvest making the eventual decision even\nmore difficult than it otherwise would\nbe so it's hard to walk away from a\nrelationship but it will also never be\neasier to do so than it is today"
