    "transcript": "my model for love is the sun which just\ngives it just shines and it's not\nworried that this guy down here didn't\ndepreciate the sunshine today or that\nthis person's like well I never asked to\nbe born or to look at the Sun or it's\nlike the sun is so abundant in its own\neffulgence that it just shines and it\ndoesn't even worry about how it's being\nreceived if it's being ignored or\nappreciated and I think that's the\nhumility of Love also which is Maybe\nwhat warms the sun's heart you know pun\nintended is that people down here are\njust sort of carrying on with their\nlives without really any consideration\nfor the sun because if we really stopped\nfor a moment and thought man all of life\nwould be extinct in the matter of days\nif the sun just disappeared or stopped\nshining like how much of our lives would\nbe devoted to like giving praise to the\nSun and appreciating the Sun and we\nwouldn't be able to sit here and have a\nconversation too busy' be too busy just\nmaking sure that the sun was feeling\ngood about its sacrifice"
