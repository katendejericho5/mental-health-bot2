    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is listen to\nyourself so at this stage of my career I\ndo a lot of consultations with men from\nall over the world and since most of\nthem now find me through my YouTube\nchannel I do a lot of consultations\nabout\nrelationships and a lot of guys come to\nme looking for a more or less objective\nthird-party gut check on their current\nrelationships should they continue to\nprogress the relationship in the\ndirection of more invested commitment or\nshould they walk away now for the record\nI've recommended both I'm not anti-c\ncommitment sometimes I don't hear\nanything concerning and the general\norientation is move forward with caution\nbut frankly more often than not the\nthings that come out of a man's mouth in\nthe first few minutes of a consultation\nis usually more than enough to dissuade\nme from progressing the relationship if\nI were in their shoes and this is\ncurious because I often talk to guys who\non the abstract level at least seem to\nbe fairly knowledgeable about women in\nrelationships in the sexual Marketplace\nin general but for whatever reason\nprobably because they've already decided\nto become emotionally involved with\nthese particular women and because\nthey've already progressed the\nrelationship to this point they can have\na lot of trouble applying these abstract\nConcepts to their own particular cases\nso I'm going to save a lot of men a lot\nof trouble today because I've been\nhaving these consultations a lot\nrecently before you call me up or you\nhire someone else or talk to a therapist\nor a life coach or whatever just listen\nto\nyourself open a recorder app and record\nyourself I'm serious literally record\nyourself talking about your relationship\nconcerns for 5 minutes you can then use\none of those AI speech to text\ntranslators to turn that into a document\nso you can see your own thoughts in\nblack and white then imagine that this\ndocument was sent to you from a good\nfriend about his\nrelationship how would you\nrespond examples of things that I've\nheard in just the past week or so from\nMen on this topic are sometimes she just\nexplodes at me or she picks fights with\nstrangers in public and expects me to\nstep in and protect her or I'm not that\nsexually attracted to her and we haven't\nhad sex in 3 years or I pay all the\nbills but she still won't sleep with me\nor we actually don't know who the father\nis because she was sleeping with several\ndifferent men at the time or she says\nshe's a borderline but I hear that there\nare treatments available for that or\nshe's on three kinds of psychiatric\nmedic ations or she's put on 50 pounds\nin the last year or she makes fun of me\nin front of my friends etc etc\netc gentlemen you need to listen to\nyourselves you need to listen to the\nwords that are coming out of your mouth\nand to be fair I think a lot of you guys\nalready know the answer to your own\nquestion and I can understand your\nhesitation I've been there myself it's\nvery difficult to pull the plug on a\nnonfunctional relationship in which\nyou've already invested a great deal of\ntime energy and money like it's going to\nbe painful it's going to hurt and it may\nhurt for a while it's not something that\nyou will immediately get over and no one\nis enthusiastic about entering into a\npainful situation I get it but the other\nside of this is as hard as it's going to\nbe it will never be easier to go through\nwith it than it is today day like the\nreason why it's going to be hard is\nbecause you've invested so much time\nenergy and money and the longer you\nhesitate the longer you procrastinate\nthat decision the more time energy and\nmoney you continue to invest making the\neventual decision even more difficult\nthan it otherwise would be so it's hard\nto walk away from a relationship but it\nwill also never be easier to do so than\nit is today now before we go any further\nif you're liking what you're hearing\nplease consider sending this episode to\nsomeone who might benefit from its\nmessage because it's Word of Mouth\nreferrals like this that really helped\nmake the channel grow you can also go to\nmy website and tip me through the\ndonation option if you want to support\nthe mission of this channel I don't do\nproduct placements or corporate\nsponsorships I rely on your support to\nkeep all this running I really\nappreciate it thank you very\nmuch gentlemen listen to yourselves and\npretend what you're hearing is coming\nfrom someone else it's so much easier to\nsee clearly when you're not emotionally\ninvested in the outcome and remember if\nyou're still not sure how to proceed\nafter some weeks or months of\ndeliberation that's your answer that's\nyour answer to paraphrase Mark Manson if\nit's not a yes it's a no and this\nis especially relevant with respect to\nthe question of marriage you have to\nunderstand that to a woman getting\nmarried in today's day and age is like\nhitting the jackpot it's a winfall that\ncan acrew her hundreds of thousands if\nnot millions of dollars over the course\nof a lifetime irrespective of whether\nthe union lasts like there's a reason\nwomen show off their rings on social\nmedia and men don't if someone just\ngifted me $100,000 I'd dance around and\nshow it off too and if if you move\nforward with having children you're\ngoing to be dealing with this person at\nleast for the next two decades whether\nit works out or not so one there's\nreally no hurry to make a decision and\ntwo you should be fairly enthusiastic\nabout the idea before moving forward\nthis is because as far as I can tell\nit's actually very difficult to be\nmarried and have kids so you're going to\nwant to be able to Coast at least for a\nlittle while\non your enthusiasm motivation and\npositive regard to get you through those\ninevitably Hard Times let me make this\nabundantly clear there is absolutely no\nreason to be fighting in the courtship\nphase of a relationship if you're\nalready fighting why are you there why\nare you there it's like if there's ever\never going to be a time time for the two\nof you to just spend time together and\nenjoy yourselves it's now and if you\ncan't manage to do that when there is\nlittle to no responsibility or\nobligation when the stakes are very low\nand everything is new and exciting then\nmy dude you are never going to have that\never ever with that\nwoman do not be misled by the modern\ntherapeutic promise that everything you\nwant is on the other side of mutual\nunderstanding and effective\ncommunication and emotional processing\nand couples counseling and Sex Therapy\nlike that that like even if\nyou could get what you want after doing\nall of those things which is an\nuncertain Prospect at best it probably\nwouldn't be worth it because there are\nsatisfying relationships you can have\nwith other women that don't require you\nto go through all of that\nmen you need to get comfortable cutting\nthings off with women at the first signs\nof bad behavior don't rationalize them\naway don't think you can work through\nthem and don't expect that things will\nmagically get better if you've never\nseen them to be good to begin with\nlisten to\nyourselves objectify yourself monologue\nand imagine your concerns were coming\nfrom a good friend what would you tell\nhim and then take your own\nadvice be smart out there gentlemen what\ndo you think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel you may also\nconsider becoming a channel member with\nperks like the priority review of\ncomments or booking a paid consultation\nas always thank you for\nlistening"
