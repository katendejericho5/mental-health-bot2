    "transcript": "relationships need boundaries\nrelationships need rules and definitions\nlove doesn't give a about any of\nthose things you think that love will\nonly love where it's allowed I mean\nthat's insane right so what I say is\nthat people need things from other\npeople and the medium in which value is\nexchanged is called a relationship and\nyou have to provide value in order to\nsecure a relationship and there needs to\nbe some kind of exchange at parody more\nor less and it's for the two people\ninvolved in that relationship to decide\nfor themselves what is valuable and and\nhow much it's valuable Etc but you don't\nneed a relationship for love because\nlove is you could say that it's beyond\nvalue or it's value less it's kind of\nthe same thing from a Zen perspective\nand love will will consistently want\nwhat is best for the loved one and think\nvery little of itself I mean that finds\nin my opinion it's apotheosis in like\nChristian myth mythology where it's the\nsacrifice I'm willing to suffer\neverything be out of my love for\nHumanity mhm"
