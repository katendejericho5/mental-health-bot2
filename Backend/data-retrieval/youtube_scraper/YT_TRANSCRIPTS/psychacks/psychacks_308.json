    "transcript": "men as a whole make more than women as a\nwhole and this uncontrolled pay Gap\nincreases significantly once a woman has\nchildren now one of the common\ninterpretations of this finding is that\nmen outn women because women are doing\nmore of the unpaid labor of raising\nchildren and running the household and\nif men would do their fair share of the\nhousehold duties this uncontrolled Gap\nwould shrink now while it's true that\nwomen do more of this unpaid labor than\nmen do this maybe doe less to sexist\ncultural forces than to the biological\npsychological reality that infants need\ntheir mothers far more than they need\ntheir fathers of whom they may only be\ndimly aware at this point"
