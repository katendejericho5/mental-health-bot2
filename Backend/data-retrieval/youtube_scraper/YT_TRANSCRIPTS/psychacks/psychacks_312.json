    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why men\nmake more than women so if you are like\nme who grew up in the west since the\ntime you were a child you were told that\nwomen earn 82 cents for every dollar\nearned by a man this was repeated over\nand over and over again until it more or\nless assumed the status of an\nunquestionable truth and doubting its\nvalidity was tantamount to attacking the\nentire female gender however by now dear\nlisteners you should know that things\nare not always or usually what they\nappear to be so today let's take a\ncloser look at this old standby the\nstatistic from which this fact is\nderived is a third grade statistic like\nit's something we might expect an\n8-year-old to calculate how was it\nconstructed to get this number they\nadded up every man annual salary and\ndivided the sum by the number of working\nmen and compared it with the sum of\nevery woman's annual salary divided by\nthe number of working\nwomen that's it as statistical analyses\ngo it's probably the most imprecise\napproximation of reality one could\npossibly conceive what's more this third\ngrade statistic was paired with an\nequally Elementary interpretation namely\nsince the only apparent difference\nbetween the two groups identified as men\nand women was ostensibly gender then the\nobserved wage Gap must be entirely due\nto that variable third grade math\ncoupled with third grade thinking it's\ntime to grow up now the easiest way to\nhelp people understand why the statistic\nisn't true is to ask them a seemingly\nunrelated question do all women make the\nsame amount of\nmoney obviously they don't so then you\nhave to ask why do some women make more\nmoney than others they can't possibly be\ndue to gender because they're all women\nso what else could be\nresponsible well maybe some of them are\nin higher paying Industries absolutely\nthe kind of work that you do would have\na huge impact on your earning potential\nbut do all say women lawyers make the\nsame amount obviously they don't so why\ndo some women lawyers make more than\nothers well maybe it's due to seniority\nokay that could definitely be part of it\nbut do all say women lawyers who have\nworked for a company for 10 years make\nthe same amount obviously they don't so\nwhy do some women lawyers who have\nworked for a company for 10 years make\nmore than others well maybe some of them\nwork more hours than others yeah I mean\nif you do more work or work more\novertime you're going to get paid more\naren't you but do all say women lawyers\nwho have worked for a company for 10\nyears and who work a total of 80 hours a\nweek make the same amount etc etc the\npoint of this thought experiment is to\ndraw out all the variables that may\nreasonably affect income that have\nnothing to do with gender we can then\nFactor these variables into our original\ncalculation with respect to men and\nwomen by controlling for their influence\nand this actually allows us to compare\nApples to Apples because if we remove\nall other known sources of income\nvariation then what's left might be\nattributable to\ngender and in fact people have done just\nthat this is called the controlled pay\nGap and lo and behold when you control\nfor all these known variables of income\nvariation the gender paid Gap shrinks\nfrom 18 cents to one cent one cent so\nthere is a 1% difference in pay that\nfavors men which is not a statistically\nsignificant difference this means that\nmen and women are functionally paid the\nsame amount all other things being equal\nhowever you have to be nuanced in your\nanalysis in order to arrive at this\nconclusion does this mean that sexism\ndoesn't exist no but it does suggest\nthat sexism plays a much smaller role in\nthe economic realities of women that is\ncommonly believed now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing please

website and tip me through\nthe donation function in proportion to\nthe value that you feel you've received\nfrom this message I use this to bankroll\nthe channel I rely on your support to\nkeep things running and I really\nappreciate it thank you very much\nof course when you relax all of these\ncontrols it remains clear that men as a\nwhole make more than women as a whole\nand this uncontrolled pay Gap increases\nsignificantly once a woman has children\nnow one of the common interpretations of\nthis finding is that men out earn women\nbecause women are doing more of the\nunpaid labor of raising children and\nrunning the household and if men would\ndo their fair share of the household\nduties this uncontrolled Gap would\nshrink now while it's true that women do\nmore of this unpaid labor than men do\nthis may be due less to sexist cultural\nforces than to the biological\npsychological reality that infants need\ntheir mothers far more than they need\ntheir fathers of whom they may only be\ndimly aware at this\npoint it's also true that these factors\nare merely Cor corelated that is one\ninterpretation of the data could be that\nwomen make less than men because they're\nbusy doing unpaid labor in the household\nanother interpretation could be that\nwomen are busy doing unpaid labor in the\nhousehold because they make less than\nmen like in any given relationship it's\nfar more likely that the man earns more\nthan the woman given the fact that\nincome status and social Prestige are\nkey drivers of female mate selection and\nit would make economic sense in a\npartnership in which resources are\nshared and in which one party earns more\nthan the other for the party who earns\nmore to kind of specialize in earning\nmoney and to devote more time to that\nPursuit the earning discrepancy would\nfree up time in the other person's day\nto attend to the necessary but unpaid\ntasks that keep the partnership running\nin fact\nyou could even consider that these tasks\nare paid by the earning discrepancy of\nthe other party that is then shared\nmutually in the relationship under such\nan arrangement like specializing in that\nway makes good economic sense so though\nwe don't know for sure I'm willing to\nbet that that's closer to the truth of\nthings than the other way around here's\nthe thing the uncontrolled gender pay\nGap will always exist always\nperiod no matter all the social advances\nor economic incentives or ideological\ncampaigns it's never going to change men\nwill always make more than women and men\nwill always make more than women because\nearning is tied to men's reproductive\nsuccess in a way that it is not tied to\nwomen's why because as we all know I\ndon't want no scrub a scrub is a guy who\ncan't get no love from me hanging out\nthe passenger side of his best friend's\nride trying to holler at me like For\nBetter or Worse women in general don't\n with guys with lower status and\nincome the same is not true for women\nmen will an attractive convenience\nstore clerk with no status education or\nresources it is what it is so here's the\nupshot money means lots of things to\nlots of people it can mean security it\ncan mean Freedom it can mean fun it can\nmean confidence it can mean lifestyle it\ncan mean all these things to women but\nit means all these things to men plus\nreproductive\nsuccess money serves one additional\nfunction for men that it doesn't for\nwomen this is why all other things being\nequal money is relatively more valuable\nto men\nthan it is to women and this is why no\nmatter how much money women make men\nwill continue to make more like if women\nworked 90 hours a week men would work 91\nnot all of them but enough of them and\nthey will do this in order to outpace\nwomen in order both to improve their\nability to access more and more\ndesirable sexual\nopportunities and to maintain the\nstability of their pre-existing\nrelationships as well this is because\ndivorce which is already\ndisproportionately initiated by women is\n50% more likely again when the woman out\nearns the\nman if necessary men would Advent a 25th\nhour in the day if it meant it would\nimprove their odds in the sexual\nMarketplace and this is why the\nuncontrolled pay Gap isn't going\nanywhere anytime soon\nin fact if it disappeared we might be in\nsome kind of end of days scenario\nbecause in that case the pool of\neligible bachelors for these higher\nearning women would then be so small\nthat we would probably be well below\nreplacement rates with respect to our\npopulation and that's why men make more\nno matter how hard women work some men\nwill always work harder because given\nwomen's selection criteria it's related\nto our genetic survival what do
