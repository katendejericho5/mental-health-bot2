    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is what\nshould I do with my life so this is a\nquestion that explicitly or implicitly\nunderlies much of my work with young men\nand today I'm going to share some\nperspectives on both how to approach and\nhow not to approach an answer to this\nquestion these are lessons I've learned\nthe hard way through my own personal\nexperience and subsequently refined in\nworking with thousands of men let's get\nto it so here's the thing being a young\nman is extremely difficult and Society\ndoes not acknowledge that reality at all\nyou're unattractive to women because you\ndon't have the things that women want\nyou don't yet have status wealth\nemotional maturity decent housing or an\nemotionally compelling lifestyle unless\nyou're a musician or something and most\ngirls go through a musician phase before\nrealizing that they're definitely not\nlooking for a musician by the same token\nyou're also useless to men because you\ncan't really help them achieve their\ngoals you don't yet have experience\nskills knowledge resources or a social\nnetwork worth noting you're a liability\nyou're not really able to help you can\nonly be helped so it takes a while to\nfind your way as a young man and very\nfew people are really going to help you\nwith this process because doing so would\nrequire they spend time energy and money\nand you may not yet have anything other\npeople want in exchange for their\ntroubles there are many ways to go and\nlittle to no assistance forthcoming and\nsince we're talking about your life the\nstakes are indeed High what should you\nin fact\ndo well I can tell you that the absolute\nworst way to approach this question of\nwhat you should do with your life is to\nsit in your room and think about it that\ndoes not work I call this strategy\nplaying mental chess or chessing for\nshort when people chess they sit in\ntheir rooms and consider hundreds or\nthousands of hypothetical scenarios in\nthe privacy of their Consciousness at\nfirst blush this may seem like a useful\nadaptation after all isn't it better to\nfail or worse in your imagination than\nin reality doesn't this allow people to\nlive a multitude of simulated lives and\nchoose the best one not really thinking\nabout what you should do with your life\nas a young man is kind of like playing a\ngame of chess in your mind 50 moves out\nbefore you've even made your opener it\nis absurd like the likelihood that the\ngame will actually transact along those\nlines is a trillion to one the\nprobability is so infinitesimally small\nit's literally not worth expending the\ncalories to think about you could spend\nhours days weeks or even months\nvisualizing the game unfolding along\ncertain lines and the first move your\nopponent makes invalidates the entire\neffort so it's a silly thing to do it's\nalso silly because frankly you don't\nreally know who you are yet I mean\nyou're not even done physically maturing\nuntil you're 25 and it can take much\nlonger to mature emotionally and\npsychologically you might think you know\nwho you are and you probably do if\nyou're in your early 20s but that might\nnot actually Accord with who you truly\nare so sitting in your room and chessing\nout your future and the privacy of your\nConsciousness means that you're actually\nmaking hypothetical decisions based on\nwho you think you are or who you'd like\nto be and the chances are good that\nthese decisions will not align perfectly\nor even mostly with the reality of who\nyou really are so not only is it not\nlike good hypothetic iCal planning it\ncan't be good hypothetical planning\nalmost by\ndefinition now before I go any further\nif you're liking what you're hearing\nplease consider sending this episode to\nsomeone who might benefit from its\nmessage because it's Word of Mouth\nreferrals like this that really help to\nmake the channel grow you can also go to\nmy website and tip me through my venmo\nlink if you like what you heard I rely\non your support in order to keep all\nthis going I really appreciate it thank\nyou very much now chess is interesting\nthere have been many studies examining\nMastery in the context of Chess and it\nturns out that contrary to popular\nbelief Chess Masters actually don't\nthink significantly more moves ahead\nthan the average player most are only\nthinking two or three moves in advance\nMaster chess players differentiate\nthemselves from average players in two\nmain ways by identifying poor moves\nquickly and reliably thereby reducing\nthe total move set under consideration\nto just a few plausible contenders and\nby recognizing patterns more quickly and\nwith less information thereby activating\npreviously Consolidated move sequences\nand of course they're able to do both\nbecause they've played thousands and\nthousands and thousands of games the\nsame is basically true of life you can't\nfigure out who you you can't figure out\nwhat you should do with your life just\nsitting in your room because we only\nreally learn Who We Are by examining the\nchoices that we make as we move through\nlife and the longer you sit in your room\nand ruminate the longer you're depriving\nyourself of this precious data about who\nyou actually are fortunately there are\nvery few decisions in life that have\nreally long lasting consequences these\ninclude things like the decision to have\nchildren or get married so leaving these\naside most decisions can be easily\ncourse corrected as you receive feedback\nas a consequence of your initial\ndecision like if you were to leave your\nhouse and realize that you set off in\nthe wrong direction you wouldn't like\nkeep going around the world until you\narrive back at your starting point you\njust turn around and in the vast\nmajority of cases it's actually much\neasier to just turn around than most\npeople believe so to figure out who you\nare you need to move out into the world\nand start making decisions enter into a\nperiod of exploration and\nexperimentation your 20s are like a\nbuffet when you go to a buffet you don't\njust load up on the first things that\nyou see you kind of take a little bit of\neverything you nibble on this you nibble\non that sometimes your expectations are\nconfirmed and a lot of times they're not\nbut in all cases you now have much\nbetter insight into where to go back for\nseconds the idea here is to put yourself\nin situations and check in with how you\nfeel as a consequence of that decision\nyour feeling is the important data point\nif you feel mostly good you may only\nneed to tweak your heading a little bit\nas you continue in the same general\ndirection and if it feels bad and I mean\nbad in the sense of it makes you feel\nweak or ashamed or aggravated not in the\nsense that it's hard or difficult you\nmay need to quit and move in a different\ndirection contrary to popular belief\nquitting is not a problem as I've\npreviously discussed winners almost\nalways quit they quit everything except\nthe thing they choose to master and they\ndo this because it takes a significant\namount of focus effort and resources to\nactually arrive at Mastery very very few\npeople can be Masters in multiple\ndomains so you'll want to choose that\none thing very carefully because a\nmismatch between who you actually are\nand the reality-based demands of Master\nin a particular field will have\nsignificant Downstream consequences hard\nwork will often Trump Talent without\neffort but you really need both to\nsucceed at the highest levels so get out\nthere and start making choices the\nfeedback from your decisions will reveal\nwho you are to yourself and if you pay\nattention to that feedback you'll begin\nto accumulate accurate self- knowledge\nand this is very useful because accurate\nself- knowledge accelerates this whole\nprocess considerably moving forward you\nwon't have to conduct more or less\nrandom experiments with respect to your\nchoices and you'll be better able to\nreliably determine which options are\nmost likely to provide goodness of fit\nwith your actual personality and this\nprocess becomes like\nexponential with more data and accurate\nInsight now here's the payoff after\nyou've made a few thousand decisions and\nafter you've changed Direction and\nyou've course corrected and after you've\nimproved your capacity for self-\nknowledge and after some years have\npassed then then you'll be in a position\nto answer the question of what you\nshould do with your life by looking back\nand seeing what you've chosen to do with\nit your path in life is the one under\nyour\nfeet and so your path in life is only\nrevealed in the\nwalking you cannot determine this in\nadvance of the\njourney you can only recognize it after\nyou've made some progress along the way\nand hopefully at the end of those\ndecisions you'll be able to look back on\nyour life without regret because you've\nused your limited time\nwisely what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know
