    "transcript": "typically one of the things that matters\nto men are their primary relationships\nnow when the security of that\nrelationship is threatened by say a home\nInvader few women would have a problem\nwith their men fighting to defend their\nrelationships however when it is a\nwoman's behavior that threatens the\nsecurity of the relationship then men\nare placed in a double bind they feel\npulled to protect the relationship but\ndoing so functionally means they end up\nfighting the woman who constitutes that\nrelationship if they don't fight they\nlose if they do fight they lose this is\nis unwise women it is not wise to put\nmen in double binds unnecessarily and\nthis is because after most men escalates\nto anger and aggression and find it to\nbe counterproductive they are left with\nonly two real courses of action either\nthe man collapses internally in order to\nprotect himself from the pain associated\nwith his continued invalidation becoming\nover time a shell of his former self or\nhe leaves that's it"
