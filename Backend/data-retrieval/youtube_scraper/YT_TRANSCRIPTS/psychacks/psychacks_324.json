    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how women\ntrain men to be\nangry this is something that many women\ndo and that many women do inadvertently\nand this of course is to be expected as\nfew women prefer to be in the presence\nof male anger in fact most find male\nanger terrifying which makes their\ncontribution to this process all the\nmore tragic and ironic and this is not\nto say that men don't have their share\nof responsibility in this after all they\ninadvertently allow themselves to be\ntrained in this way however if women can\ncome to appreciate how they may be\nperversely incentivizing male anger it\nwill go a long way toward reducing\nunnecessary relationship conflict to\nexplain how this process occurs I'm\ngoing to begin by sharing an anecdote\nfrom my own life now I am by no means a\nperfect person however all other things\nbeing equal I'm a fairly patient guy in\nthe last 10 years I can count the number\nof times I've raised my voice on one\nhand and all of those times have been\nassociated with two specific women I was\nin a long-term relationship with one of\nthese women many years ago and I\nremember having a lot of trouble getting\nthrough to her and this was really\npuzzling to me because I know that I'm\nactually an exceptional Communicator I'm\narticulate and precise in my words and I\nhave good command of tone and expression\nto clearly indicate my emotion in\ngeneral I don't have a problem\ntransmitting my message to my intended\naudience however when I brought certain\nissues to her attention for whatever\nreason my words just didn't seem to\npenetrate her understanding in the\nmoment it would seem as though she\nunderstood\nhowever when the conversation was over\nshe'd just go back to doing whatever it\nwas that she was doing before as if the\ndiscussion had never happened and in the\nbeginning I just assumed that this was\nmy fault that I hadn't yet used the\nright words to represent how important\nthis was to me or how disrespectful and\nhurtful her behavior was I assumed that\nif she understood this she would have to\nchange her behavior and the fact that\nshe hadn't changed her behavior was\nproof that she hadn't yet understood\ntherefore the solution was to try again\nand to communicate more clearly and\neffectively than before and I did try\nagain many many many many times not only\nthat I used all the various\ncommunication strategies and\npsychological tactics I had at my\ndisposal to get my point across and none\nof them worked I was calm I was patient\nI sought to understand rather than be\nunderstood I tried everything I could to\nlet her know that her behavior was\nproblematic and that I wanted it to stop\nall to know\naail until one day after scores of\nunsuccessful attempts to get through to\nher I had had it I snapped I lost my\ntemper and I yelled and screamed at\nher and guess what happened for the\nfirst time ever in the history of that\nrelationship ship she apparently heard\nwhat I said and she changed her\nbehavior and it was at this point that I\nrealized that I had to take myself out\nof that relationship which I\nsubsequently did why because if the only\nway I could be heard in my relationship\nwas by raising my voice and becoming\nincreasingly aggressive then I would be\nmolded into an angry aggressive man over\ntime neither one of us would have wanted\nthat outcome but that's what would have\nhappened if nothing changed that\nrelationship was headed to a very dark\nplace as I would have functionally had\nto choose between being angry and being\nignored women you have to understand\nthat the vast majority of men don't\nescalate to anger immediately and you\nshould just leave any man who does\nrather the vast majority of men will try\nto communicate with their women many\nmany many times in different ways using\ndifferent strategies before resorting to\nanger and this is how women\ninadvertently train their men to be\nangry By ignoring disrespecting or\ninvalidating them when they attempt to\ncommunicate non-\naggressively and as should be abundantly\nobvious this is very very stupid\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this

donation\nwithout giving YouTube a cut uh I really\nappreciate your support you make all of\nthis happen thank you very\nmuch now if a man for whatever reason\ncan't seem to get through to his woman\nabout something important to him if he\nremains unheard time and time again then\nthere are really only three things that\ncan happen the first thing that can\nhappen is that the man will escalate to\nanger and aggression For Better or Worse\nmost men are going to attempt this\nstrategy first before moving on to one\nof the two remaining options\nin general when people don't feel heard\nthey get louder this is often\ncounterproductive especially in\nintersexual relationships however it is\none of the remaining options when reason\nand understanding fail and just to be\nclear this isn't always a bad thing\nafter all men are socially expected to\nbe protectors and they are encouraged to\nfight for the things that matter to them\ntypically one of the things that matters\nto men are their primary relationships\nnow when the security of that\nrelationship is threatened by say a home\nInvader few women would have a problem\nwith their men fighting to defend their\nrelationships however when it is a\nwoman's behavior that threatens the\nsecurity of the\nrelationship then men are placed in a\ndouble bind they feel pulled to protect\nthe relationship but doing so\nfunctionally means they end up fighting\nthe woman who constitutes that\nrelationship if they don't fight they\nlose if they do fight they lose\nthis is unwise women it is not wise to\nput men in double binds unnecessarily\nand this is because after most men\nescalate to anger and aggression and\nfind it to be counterproductive they are\nleft with only two real courses of\naction either the man collapses\ninternally in order to protect himself\nfrom the pain associated with his\ncontinued\ninvalidation becoming over time a shell\nof his former self or he\nleaves that's it those are the only\noptions a man has when dealing with a\nwoman who won't listen to him he will\neither escalate collapse or leave there\nare no other\noptions now women does this mean that\nyou simply have to cater to men's every\ndesire absolutely not however it does\nmean that it's in your best interests\neither to rectify problematic Behavior\nas quickly as possible or or to find\nways to ensure that you disagree with\nyour man in a way that does not leave\nhim feeling invalidated or\ndisrespected in general you should take\nrespectful requests from the men in your\nlife\nseriously because they may not remain\npatient and respectful\nindefinitely and you wouldn't expect\nthem to remain indefinitely patient and\nrespectful if they were dealing with\nanyone else who was threatening your\nrelationship failure to do this\nfunctionally ensures that you will\nexperience more and more conflict in\nyour relationship until you end up\neither a with the defeated shell of your\nman's former self or B alone and how do\neither one of these outcomes serve you\nand just for the record just like I\nencouraged you to Simply leave any man\nwho immediately escalates to anger I\nencourage every man I work with to\nSimply leave any woman who refuses to\nrespect his boundaries or listen to his\nreasonable requests fighting with a\nwoman isn't worth it for a man because\nthere's no way he can win and staying in\na relationship until he is a husk of his\nformer self is an even more devastating\noutcome this means the best possible\nmove when dealing with such women is for\nmen to exit as quickly and graciously as\npossible I've since learned my lesson\nand you can too what do you think does\nthis fit with your own experience let me\nknow in the comments below and if you've\ngotten
