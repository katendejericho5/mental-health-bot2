    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how women\ndisrespect men without realizing it\nunderstanding power so this is the first\ninstallment of a two-part episode for\nthe ladies I'm here to help you\nunderstand how you might be getting in\nyour own way with respect to your\nrelationships with men as I mentioned in\nmy episode how to get any man you want\nthe unbreakable rule the one thing that\nyou women must absolutely never do to\nthe man with whom you want to have a\nlong-term relationship is disrespect him\nthis does not mean that you have to\nrespect him though that would obviously\nbe preferred disrespecting someone and\nnot respecting someone aren't the same\nthing and this also does not mean that\nyou have to agree with him or approve of\neverything that he does however it does\nmean that you have to find a way to\ndisagree or disapprove in a way that\ndoes not disrespect him and trust me\nthis is possible to do now there are\nsome very obvious ways in which women\nare subject to disrespecting men they\ncan do this through open mockery and\ncontempt or passive aggression and\nneglect or even physical or emotional\nabuse I'm not talking about these things\nI take it that the vast majority of\nwomen understand that these behaviors\nare disrespectful and toxic rather\ntoday's talk is going to be about ways\nin which women disrespect men without\nrealizing it the idea here is to call\nwomen's attention to the ways in which\nthey may be inadvertently sabotaging the\nrelationships they want with the men\nthey want to have them with and keep in\nmind I'm not arguing that women have a\nmoral or ethical responsibility not to\ndo these things Visa men I'm arguing\nthat women who voluntarily choose not to\ndo these things will be much more\neffective in achieving their\nrelationship goals this is all about\nEffectiveness across these two episodes\nI'll be briefly discussing five ways\nwomen often disrespect men without\nrealizing it this list is by no means\nexhaustive but it should serve as a\ngeneral template for examining one's\nbehavior in light of this value as\nstated in previous episodes the general\nrule of thumb when it comes to\ndisrespect is if you wouldn't say the\nsame thing in the same way to your boss\nif you were interested in keeping your\njob then you shouldn't say that in that\nway to the man with whom you want to be\nin a long-term relationship so we're not\nonly talking about criticizing and\ndemeaning language like word choice\nwe're also talking about nonverbal cues\nof disrespect like eye rolling or\ndismissive sighing or po body language\nEtc as we'll see most of these behaviors\ninvolve women inappropriately assuming\nmore power than is warranted in their\nintimate relationships which is\nemotionally perceived by men as\ndisrespect let's jump right into it the\nfirst way that women disrespect men\nwithout realizing it is through\ninappropriate\nquestioning the ability to ask question\nCH s is a privilege that is awarded to\nthose with more power have you ever been\narrested in the interrogation room you\ndon't get to ask the officers questions\nthey do just like they say in all the\ncop dramas hey we're the ones asking\nquestions here have you ever attended a\nsession of the Supreme Court during oral\narguments the justices are empowered to\nask the attorneys present as many\nquestions as they want even interrupting\ntheir responses to ask ask even more\nquestions if necessary the attorneys\nnever get a chance to grill the justices\nwhy because the court wasn't convened to\nanswer to the lawyers that would be an\ninappropriate usurpation of\nauthority women when you interrogate Men\nby questioning their intentions their\nwhereabouts their motivations their\nchoices you are basically communicating\nthat you believe that you occupy a more\npower ful position relative to them you\ncommunicate that you believe that you\nhave a right to know certain things and\nthat you believe he must answer to you\nand it's only the less powerful who must\nanswer to the more powerful never the\nother way around this is functionally\nplacing yourself in a higher position\nrelative to that man which will\nabsolutely be perceived as disrespect\nfind ways to learn what you want with\nwithout prying or interrogating despite\nwhat you believe no man has any\nobligation to answer to you now before I\ngo any further if you're liking what\nyou're hearing please consider sending\nthis episode to someone who might\nbenefit from its message because it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally helped to make the channel grow\nand you can also go to my website and\ntip me in proportion to the value you\nfeel you've derived from this message\nusing the venmo link provided I'm doing\nit this way because I get all of your\ndonation that way as opposed to just a\nfraction of it when going through\nYouTube I really appreciate your support\nit helps keep all of this running thank\nyou now the second way that women\ndisrespect men without realizing it is\nthrough granting\npermission in general we have to ask\npermission of those who have the\nauthority to grant our requests this\nmeans that we act as though the good in\nquestion is actually in the possession\nof the authority who can grant gr us\npermission whether that's technically\ntrue or not taking possession of that\ngood without permission would be an\negregious Act of insubordination and\nthis is because permission only moves\nfrom the high to the low those with more\npower never have to ask permission of\nthose with less now the fact of the\nmatter is that unless you come to a\nmutual agreement to the contrary a man\nhas no obligation to ask your permission\nfor\nanything even if he's in a committed\nrelationship with you he was a sovereign\nand autonomous individual when you met\nhim and he remains a sovereign and\nautonomous individual until he\nexplicitly enters into a new arrangement\nto the contrary this means that a man\nhas absolutely no obligation to ask your\npermission or check in with you first to\nspend time with his friend\nor leave his house or pursue his Hobbies\nor really do whatever it is that he\nwants to do with what could very well be\nhis One and Only Life on this planet\nwomen would you want to ask your man's\npermission before you spent your own\nmoney wouldn't that like wrankle you\nlike it's your money you earned it why\nshould any man have the power to decide\nwhat you do with it well by the same\ntoken\nwhy would any man need to ask your\npermission on how to spend his own time\nit's his life not yours a woman who acts\nas though a man must ask her permission\nto spend his own time is like a man who\nacts as though a woman must ask him\npermission to spend her own money only\nworse because you can get money back and\nexpecting your man to check in with you\nbefore he makes a decision with respect\nto how how he spends his own time is\nacting as though you have the authority\nto Grant or withhold permission on the\nmatter as before this is functionally\nplacing yourself in a higher position\nrelative to that man which once again\nwill absolutely be perceived as\ndisrespect and of course any man who\nallows himself to fall into this Dynamic\nis more than partly to blame for his\nsituation all right the Third Way that\nwomen disrespect men without realizing\nit is through\nsurveillance this could be done through\na location tracking app or snooping\nthrough his phone or rifling through his\nfinances even the government isn't\nallowed to do these things without\npermission the fact of the matter is\nyour desire to know does not take\nprecedence over his right to privacy\nwomen who do these things are\nfunctionally treating their men like\npets and acting like their owners as\nshould be obvious vious this is placing\nyourself in a higher position relative\nto that man which will be perceived\nas disrespect you got it and it will be\nperceived as disrespect even if the\nmotivations for doing so are neutral\nlike simple curiosity or even positive\nlike care or concern as with all of\nthese the feeling that compelled you to\nact in this way is irrelevant it is the\nbehavior itself self that is\ndisrespectful parents can go into their\nchildren's rooms this is because\neverything in that room actually belongs\nto the parent like it's only the child's\nroom in name and parents ultimately\nremain responsible for their children\nuntil they turn 18 it's not only their\nright it's their duty to supervise their\nchildren's lives but this is only\nbecause children lack the capacity to\nsupervise themselves on the other hand\nI'm willing to bet that your man was a\nfully functioning adult when you met him\nand he remains a fully functioning adult\nto this day acting as if you have a\nright or a duty to supervise his life is\ntreating him like a child do you like\nbeing treated like a child do you like\nbeing in fantz does that hurt your Widow\nfeeings like that's infuriating and dis\nrespectful right like that's why we\ndon't talk like that to other adults but\nif we're committed not to infantilize\nadults with our words and tone we should\nlikewise be committed not to infantilize\nadults with our actions and\nbehaviors make sense all right that's\nenough for one episode I'll round out\nthe list and make some final comments in\nthe next installment so stay tuned what\ndo you think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if if you've gotten this far\nyou might as
