    "transcript": "in general if it works in business it\nworks with women when it comes to\nvetting a woman for a relationship it is\nimperative that you hire slow and Fire\nfast allowing yourself to become\nemotionally involved with with a woman\nbefore you've appropriately vetted her\nfor that relationship is a risky\nproposition that is unlikely to produce\nthe desired outcome why because most\nwomen will not be a good fit for you so\ndefaulting to rejection is the safer bet\nstatistically and you absolutely have a\nlot to lose by entering into a\nrelationship with someone who is neither\ncompetent nor virtuous so it's\nappropriately\nself-protective if you don't hire slow\nthen you will likely be misled by your\nemotional needs and or your sexual\nattraction to foreclose prematurely in\nwhich case you will likely only have\nbrought on someone competent and\nvirtuous through sheer dumb luck"
