    "transcript": "due to hypergamy women tend to benefit\nmore from this exchange than men do this\ncreates a kind of\nindebtedness that has historically been\npaid off in various ways it is this\nservice that women have rendered to men\nthat balanced the scales of the\ntransaction between men and women it's\nwhat made hypergamous relationships a\nfair trade modern women however tend to\nbulk at this service and yet they still\nmaintain their hypergamy they continue\nto to mate and date for gain this means\nthat the net flow of resources continues\nto pass from the man to the woman which\nfunctionally means that the man is just\npaying to access the sexual opportunity\nthis basically means that a lot of\nmodern relationships are really just\nforms of prostitution with extra steps\nthis might ruffle some feathers however\nI honestly don't know what else to call\nan arrangement in which resources are\nexchanged for sexual opportunity"
