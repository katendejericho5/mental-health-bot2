    "transcript": "if overpaying is the true cost of\nwinning then it will often be the case\nthat winning will be disappointing this\nis the economic explanation for why\ngetting what you want doesn't make you\nhappy in general the cost of winning\ntends to exceed the value of what you've\nwon in a lot of cases winning is a net\nloss this is one of the reasons why I\nhelp people get what they want it\nfacilitates their disappointment which\nallows them to rule out one more place\nthey need to look in order to find their\nhappiness which is never found outside\nof themselves so does that mean winning\nisn't worth it well not necessarily you\njust have to understand that the real\nvalue in getting what you want is not\nthe good itself but the process of\nrecreating yourself the good became the\npretext to move through a transformative\nprocess to become more than you\ncurrently are after all you likely can't\nwin as you are presently"
