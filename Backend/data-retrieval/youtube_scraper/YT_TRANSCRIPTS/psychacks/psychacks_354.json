    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is\noverpaying is the cost of winning this\nis an important life lesson in today's\nday and age we are fairly squeamish\nabout the idea of winners and losers we\nwould prefer that the Universe did not\nexist as a zero sum game and in some\ncases it doesn't however in far more\ncases than we would like to admit it\ndoes the game is zero sum if you want\nthat job no one else can have it if you\nwant to marry that man no other woman\ncan marry him if you want to win that\nChampionship everyone else has to lose\nthe universe is abundant in general\nthere are lots of jobs and men and\nchampionships but it is zero sum in the\nparticular there is only one of that job\nand of that man and of that championship\nand if you you want it no one else can\nhave it if you want it you have to be\nwilling and able to win and the cost of\nwinning is overpaying and I don't just\nmean money I'm using the word overpay in\nits broadest possible sense not only\nmight you need to pay more you might\nneed to work harder and longer than you\never thought you would you might need to\nsacrifice more of your time and energy\nand attention than you ever thought you\ncould\nyou might need to pay in the sense of\ngiving things up like Leisure and\ncomfort and free time and hobbies you\nmight even need to part with friends and\nfamily who obstruct your goal and you\nmay need to pay with doubt and\nloneliness and ridicule and pain at the\nhighest levels this is the cost of\nwinning why is this the case well life\nis sort of like an auction house and how\ndoes an auction house work an auction\nhouse is full of things that many people\nwant however these things are for sale\nremember wanting is free the whole world\nwants a loving relationship and a\nbeautiful house and a rewarding job who\nwouldn't want more beauty or power or\nmoney wanting these things is free but\nan auction house is not a charity\nactually getting these things\nwill cost you and the fairest way we've\nHit Upon to distribute these particular\nZero Sum Goods is to give them to the\nperson who pays the most perhaps not a\nperfect system but it's the best we've\nmanaged to come up with to win the lot\nthe given buyer must pay more than\nanyone else does and this means that the\nwinner\noverpays why because apparently no one\nelse thought that that good was worth\nthat that much they weren't willing to\nsacrifice as much as the winner because\nthey didn't think what they were being\nasked to give up was a fair exchange for\nwhat they hoped to receive and they may\nhave been right but those people didn't\nwin the lot winners win not only because\nthey pay more than everyone else they\nwin because they pay more for the good\nthan it is likely worth they overpay in\nan auction house a winner might overpay\nby a dollar or by $10 million but they\nalways overpay because they almost\nalways could have won the same good for\nLess because no one else was willing to\npay that much now with respect to a\nliteral auction winners overpay with\nmoney like that's how I got this house\nthere were 14 other offers on this house\nI wasn't awarded the chance to buy it\nbecause I was a better person or because\nI wanted it the most or because the\nseller really liked me I got to buy it\nbecause I offered the most money I the\namount I paid was significantly more\nthan the second best offer which\nfunctionally means that I overpaid for\nthis house but look who's living here\nnow property values and interest rates\nhave spiked since I bought the house and\nI bought the house because I thought it\nwas\nundervalued but I still overpaid\nrelative to my competition and this is\ninevitable because overpaying is the\ncost and the privilege of winning\nhowever how does this apply to other\nGoods in life well let's say you want to\nstart your own business like who\nwouldn't want to be independently\nsuccessful however in order for your\nbusiness to succeed you will likely need\nto overpay just like I was willing to\ngive more money than anyone else was in\norder to buy this house you might have\nto do what no one else is willing to do\nin order for your business to succeed\nthis is the price of success more\ngenerally the willingness to do what no\none else is willing to do this might\nmean that you're willing to provide a\nservice that no one else does or to sell\nyour product more cheaply than anyone\nelse or to provide a higher quality\ncustomer experience than your\ncompetition for your business to succeed\nyou need to find some way to do what\nyour competitors are not doing that is\nstill attractive and valuable to your\npotential customers now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom its message because it's Word of\nMouth referrals like this that really\nhelp to make the channel grow you can\nalso hit the thanks button and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nreceived from this message I don't do\nproduct placements or corporate\nsponsorships so I really do rely on your\nsupport to make all this happen I deeply\nappreciate it thank\nyou now the same goes for relationships\nyou have your sites set on a particular\nman ladies then you will have to overpay\nto get him that means that you have to\nbe willing to do what no other woman in\nthe competition is willing to do this\ncould mean being more sexually generous\nand available or more sweet and\nsupportive or more helpful in the\nservice of his mission but you will have\nto do what other women w't now you might\nargue that well he's not worth it and\nyou may be right however you won't win\nwith that attitude that's sour grapes\nsame goes for men you want a particular\nwoman you will have to overpay to get\nher ultimately the right to buy goes to\nthe man who offers her the best overall\ncompensation package however she chooses\nto Define that this could mean offering\nchildren or commitment or excitement and\nAdventure or an emotionally compelling\nlifestyle and you might argue that she's\nnot worth it and you may be right but\nyou won't win with that attitude w w to\nwin you must beat out your competition\nand to beat out your competition you\nmust be willing to do things that they\naren't that are still valuable and\nattractive to your potential customer\nbase this means that you must either\nstrengthen yourself or weaken your\ncompetition two strategies that go hand\ninand in the Game of Love and War or\nbusiness and until you figure out how to\ndo that you will be passed over again\nand again and again and again you can\nwhine you can you can protest but\nthat's just how it is now here's the\nthing if overpaying is the true cost of\nwinning then it will often be the case\nthat winning will be\ndisappointing this is the economic\nexplanation for why getting what you\nwant doesn't make you happy in general\nthe cost of winning tends to exceed the\nvalue of what you've won in a lot of\ncases is winning is a net loss this is\none of the reasons why I help people get\nwhat they want it facilitates their\ndisappointment which allows them to rule\nout one more place they need to look in\norder to find their happiness which is\nnever found outside of themselves but\npeople don't believe me when I tell them\nthat they only listen when they've been\nsufficiently disappointed in their\ngratification so does that mean winning\nisn't worth it well not necessarily you\njust have to understand that the real\nvalue in getting what you want is not\nthe good itself because it probably\nwon't be worth more than what it costs\nto achieve it but the process of\nrecreating yourself the good became the\npretext to move through a transformative\nprocess to become more than you\ncurrently are after all you likely can't\nwin as you are presently to win you must\nbe willing to do what your competition\nis not which will motivate you to get\noff your ass and become a more competent\nversion of yourself broadly defined the\ndesire to win creates the process in\nwhich you will be remade into something\ngreater than you currently are and\nthat's the real Alchemy here just\nconsider an Olympic Athlete the real\ngold is not the medal and standing on a\nPodium for three minutes the real gold\nis becoming the strongest person in the\nworld or the fastest person in the world\nor the most graceful person in the world\nyears of pain and discipline and\nheartbreak and perseverance cannot be\nworth the value of that medal but it\nmight be worth the value of being\nafforded the opportunity to realize\none's potential as fully as possible\nonce in your life and that's why no one\nwins the\ngold actually does it for the medal\nthat's why no one who wins the gold\nactually does it for the medal if that's\nall they wanted they probably would have\ngiven up a long time ago because the\nmedal is just too expensive too rich for\nmy blood sociopaths aside winners win\nbecause they understand that the real\nvalue is the process which is what\nallows them to stick with the process\nlong enough to win because it always\ntakes longer and costs more than you\nthink it will before you start so if you\nwant to win then be willing to overpay\nand if you're not willing to overpay\nthen give up the desire to win because\nthat desire will only torture you if\nyou're not willing to do what you need\nto do to realistically achieve it Just\nSurrender the desire and be content with\nwhat you have what do you think does\nthis fit with your own experience
