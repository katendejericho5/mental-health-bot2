    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is women's\ngreatest enemy and I'm talking about\nwomen's greatest enemy in the context of\nthe sexual Marketplace what is the one\nthing that most prevents women from\ngetting the relationships they want with\nthe men they want to have them with it's\nvery simple ladies in a word women's\ngreatest enemy is pride your greatest\nenemy is pride every everything you want\nwith respect to men is on the other side\nof that Pride I alluded to this fact in\nmy series how to get any man you want\nlet me tell you ladies Pride is very\ncold company it will not keep you warm\nat night and in today's episode I'm\ngoing to be discussing three of the main\nways your pride is keeping you single\nfirst and foremost your pride tells you\nthat you are the prize\nand you are not at least not after you\nturn 30 at 30 the average man's sexual\nMarketplace value exceeds the average\nwoman's sexual Marketplace value for the\nvery first time and that Gap only\nincreases as time goes on believing that\nyou are the prize intrinsically and not\njust the prize relatively and\ntemporarily is pride it's this Pride\nthat motivates you to squander your most\nfertile and attractive years the years\nin which you would most be able to\nsecure a committed relationship with a\nhigh value man on either having fun or\nprioritizing your career you've\nconflated the privileged moment you pass\nthrough with your inherent\nself-worth and this is why you think\nthat there's no hurry once the prize\nalways the prize this sense of Pride\nalso stops you from initiating like why\nwould I do that I shouldn't have to make\nanything happen for myself that's the\nman's job in anyway it will happen when\nit happens I have plenty of time okay\njust go back in time like 60 years men\ndidn't pursue women it was women who\npursued men it was women who dragged men\nsometimes Kicking and Screaming to The\nAltar and they did this because they are\nthe ones on a tighter timeline for\nbetter or worse women don't have the\nsame Lu of waiting around as men do back\nthen everyone understood that if a woman\nwanted a relationship she had to get out\nthere and make it happen and this sense\nof urgency has been disrupted by the\ntwin beliefs I'm the prize and I have\nplenty of time generated by Pride the\nfact of the matter is that it has never\nbeen easier in the history of the world\nfor women to get access to the men they\nwant to have relation relationships with\nwith social media you can find the\nhottest richest most eligible bachelors\nanywhere in the world and slide right\ninto their DMS and if your picks are\ngood enough you actually might get a\nresponse that won't be enough to seal\nthe deal but you can at least get your\nfoot in the door what you do with that\nopportunity is up to you and yet even\nwith this unprecedented access to high\nvalue men which allows you to SA ly and\nfreely and instantly connect with almost\nanyone on this planet you still don't\ninitiate and this makes it very\ndifficult to sympathize with women who\nare single and don't want to be like get\noff your ass and do something about it\nif you're unemployed and don't want to\nbe make it your job to get a job and if\nyou're single and don't want to be make\nit your job to get a relationship\nexpecting that the relationship that you\nwant is just going to fall into your lap\nis as arrogant as expecting that your\ndream job is somehow just going to\nmaterialize into your\nlife okay all right the second way that\npride is obstructing your success is\nthat it's causing you to disparage male\nsexuality a lot of Western women even\nseem to find male sexual interest\ninsulting like men should be\nappreciating the beauty of your mind and\nthe depths of your soul rather than your\nphysical appearance you think that our\naction has little to do with you like\nthe person inside your body and that in\nany case if we just want sex we'd just\nbe better off hiring a prostitute the\nattitude is basically that sex and\nphysical attraction are beneath you\nwhich is a form of Pride now before I go\nany further if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom its message because it's Word of\nMouth referrals like this that really\nhelp to make the channel grow and if you\nlike what you're hearing you can also\nhit the thanks button and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nreceived from this episode I don't do\ncorporate sponsorships or product\nplacements so I rely on your support to\nmake all this happen I really appreciate\nit thank you very much now this might\nhurt some feelings but ladies you have\nto understand that if men did not\nexperience sexual attraction to you the\nvast majority of them would have nothing\nto do with you like nothing this is\nbecause men can generally get all their\nother needs met more cheaply more easily\nand more enjoyably with other men like I\nwould rather talk about quantum\nmechanics and Shakespearean literature\nwith other men I'd rather problem solve\nwith and confide in other men I'd rather\nhang out with and have fun with other\nmen like do you see without my sexual\nattraction which as a heterosexual man\nis primed for feminine traits more\ngenerally I might only rarely have\ndealings with women in the normal course\nof events and this is really how humans\nhave organically organized themselves\nacross culture and throughout history\nmen generally spend their time with\nother men women generally spend their\ntime with other women and there's some\nsocial comingling at the end of the day\nso rather than see male sexual interest\nthrough the lens of your pride as\nsomething beneath you ladies you can see\nit as an opportunity to gain access to a\nparticular man who may not yet have\nanother reason for dealing with you I\nget that you want to be seen for who you\nare deep down inside but spoiler alert\nwe can't [ __ ] see who you are deep\ndown inside what we see is your body and\nif we didn't see that we probably\nwouldn't be making the effort to see\nanything else what's more we can hear\nwhat comes out of your mouth now I can\nappreciate that unwanted sexual interest\nis awkward and uncomfortable I get that\nhowever if the first thing that comes\nout of your mouth in response to my\nattraction is criticism judgment and\nshame I don't think I really want to\nknow who you are deep down inside what's\njust on the inside is distasteful\nenough and the third thing that gets in\nwomen's way in the sense of their pride\nis their contempt for anything related\nto\nDomesticity cooking cleaning child care\njust hire a maid just hire an ananny you\nthink that this is low value degrading\nwork work that in any case would prevent\nyou from fulfilling what is apparently\nyour true calling in life being an\nemployee the same women who insist that\nthey could never ever be obedient to a\nman spend the majority of their lives\nbeing obedient to their often male\nemployers they trade a family for a\npaycheck this is the pride that cuts off\nthe nose to SP F the face ladies you\nneed to closely examine what is actually\nso distasteful to you about domestic\nactivities I recently watched a podcast\nepisode in which an attractive young\nwoman was asked whether she would ever\ndo her man's laundry and she like\nliterally shuddered with revulsion it\nwas like the question triggered some\nrepressed trauma and this woman was\ntransported back to the handmaid's taale\nwhere a simple Act of service was the\ngateway to patriarchal oppression it's\nnot it's laundry\nwhich thanks to modern technology is\nliterally the easiest of all the\nhousehold chores to complete you're not\ndown at the river bank with a washboard\nscrubbing out the stains with a lie you\nrendered yourself from pig fat you're\nmoving the clothes from the hamper to\nthe washer and pushing a button laundry\nis not your enemy it's your idea of\nlaundry that is and this goes for most\nof the other domestic activities as I\nmentioned in the first episode of this\nseries the key to getting the\nrelationship you want with the man you\nwant to have it with is to be useful and\nin order to be useful you have to allow\nyourself to be\nused your pride will wrankle at that but\nthat's a fact the good news is that as\nlong as you\nexercise good discernment you will be\nrewarded for being used it's just like a\njob because you allow other people to\nuse your time time and skills and\nexpertise you are compensated with money\nif you didn't allow people to use you\nyou don't get paid right the same is\ntrue for relationships if you want a\nhigh value relationship you must allow\nyourselves to be used and to be used in\nthe way that those who are paying I.E\nthe men you want to have a relationship\nwith want to use you and keep in mind\nthat if something's not useful it's it's\ndecoration so ladies if you don't want\nto be useful then you damn well better\nbe decorative and the fact of the matter\nis that most of you are not attractive\nenough to be decorative and that you\nmight not like it even if you were why\nbecause what do decorations\ndo nothing they sit nice and quiet up on\na shelf where they belong attesting to\nthe reflected stat the man who bought\nthem so if you want a relationship with\na man who isn't that isn't primarily\ndecorative then you have to allow\nyourselves to be used by him if not then\nyou are\nuseless and the world will pass you by\nthe things that make a man's life easier\nand better are not beneath you they are\nyour ticket in so those are the three\nways that pride is standing in your way\nladies resolve these issues and you can\nhave the relationships that you want\nwith the men you want to have them with\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe
