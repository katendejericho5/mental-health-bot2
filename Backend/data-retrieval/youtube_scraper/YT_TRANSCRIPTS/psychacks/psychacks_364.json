    "transcript": "there is a time for a man to be\nemotionally invested in a relationship\nand there is a time for a man not to be\nemotionally invested in a relationship\nand what is that time at least the first\n6 months of a relationship I have talked\nwith too many men to many men over the\nyears whose problems stemmed from the\nfact that they could not resist becoming\nemotionally attached to a particular\nwoman before she had been properly\nvetted for a relationship so many\ndifficult and problematic situations\ncould be avoided entirely if men could\nlearn to exercise a little restraint in\nthis department men should consider the\nfirst 6 months minimum to be the\ndiligence dating period why 6 months\nbecause it typically takes at least that\nlong to reach the crisis of\ndisillusionment in which the projected\nfantasy to which you have been attracted\nis Shattered by the reality of who the\nother person actually is"
