    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nresist becoming emotionally attached now\nyou might be thinking Orion what are you\ntalking about isn't that bad isn't that\ntoxic are you really going to teach men\nhow to be cooler less emotional and less\ninvested in their relationships and my\nresponse to that would be yeah I am\nthat's exactly what I'm going to do\nbecause there is a time for a man to be\nemotionally invested in a relationship\nship and there is a time for a man not\nto be emotionally invested in a\nrelationship and what is that time at\nleast the first six months of a\nrelationship I have talked with too many\nmen too many men over the years whose\nproblems stemmed from the fact that they\ncould not resist becoming emotionally\nattached to a particular woman before\nshe had been properly vetted for a\nrelationship so many difficult and\nproblematic situations could be avoided\nentirely if men could learn to exercise\na little restraint in this department my\ndudes there is a reason why buyers\nexpect a diligence period before any big\npurchase like a business or a house they\ndon't yet know what they're dealing with\nthey don't yet know whether the\nparticular opportunity in front of them\nis actually what they want and hope it\nto be and if they don't figure that out\nfor the sale it's going to be their\nproblem after they hand over the money\nsimilarly men should consider the first\nsix months minimum to be the diligence\ndating period why six months because it\ntypically takes at least that long to\nreach the crisis of disillusionment in\nwhich the projected fantasy to which you\nhave been attracted is Shattered by the\nreality of who the other person actually\nis and if you decide to give your heart\nto to a woman before you can see who she\nreally is then you're not just gambling\nyou're gambling without even bothering\nto learn the rules of the game\ndon't do that that is stupid and it's\nstupid for two reasons in the first\nplace if you decide to emotionally\ninvest in a woman who turns out to be of\npoor moral character you're going to\nsuffer and you're going to suffer\nbecause ultimately you will need to\nchoose between your head and your heart\nthat is you'll have to choose between\nwhat is good and right for you and what\nyou've already chosen to love and that's\na terrible position to be in like no\nmatter what you do it's going to hurt\nand it might hurt real bad and frankly\nyou did that to yourself because you did\nnot exercise sufficient restraint and\ndiscernment before choosing to\nemotionally invest in that particular\nwoman resisting this investment is an\nemotional survival strategy and in the\nsecond place if you decide to\nemotionally invest in a woman before it\nis warranted you will place yourself in\nthe adorer role this will force her in\nthe place of the adored which is\ngenerally not where women want to be\nbecause it robs them of the emotional\nexperience that women typically seek\nfrom romantic relationships a man in the\nAdor role is also less attractive\nbecause if you're looking up at her then\nshe's looking down at you and it's very\nhard for a woman to love let alone\nrespect\na man that she is forced to look down on\nso emotionally investing too soon can\nsignificantly compromise attraction and\ndrive a woman right out of your life\nremember you can't want someone into\nwanting you more so just cool your jets\neither way it's just not a good idea for\nmen to allow themselves to emotionally\ninvest in any given woman until they\nconduct sufficient due diligence they\nmay need to actively resist the urge to\ndo so a lot of guys they have a great\nfirst date and they're already thinking\nabout what their kids are going to look\nlike or they meet a woman who them\nreal good and they think wow she's\nperfect I finally found the one this is\ninappropriate gentlemen it's like I'm\nglad you had a good time or a fun night\nor two but don't get ahead of yourselves\nbecause you are setting yourself up for\na fall now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've received from this\nmessage I don't do corporate\nsponsorships or product placements so\nthis is how I keep all of this running I\nreally appreciate your support thank you\nvery\nmuch men it is your job to resist the\npull to emotionally invest in any given\nwoman until it is appropriate to do so\ndealing with women is a lot like playing\npoker every once in a while you're going\nto be dealt some good whole cards if you\nstart jumping out of your chair and\nchanging your bedding Behavior every\ntime you get pocket aces you're not\ngoing to win that pot and you haven't\neven seen the Flop yet like that's an\nadvantageous position to be in but you\nhave to put on your best poker face in\nthat situation you keep a rain on your\nemotions and you don't deviate from your\nsystem because that's your best bet of\nactually raking in a big pot in that\ncircumstance you can not allow your\nemotions to change your behavior now\nthere are several things that you can do\nto resist the pull to invest emotionally\nfirst and foremost you need to guard\nyour thoughts if she's not around don't\nthink about her in general it's not a\ngood idea to let your mind wander to\nthings that aren't present in your life\nif you do this you will be where your\nlife is not and that's not generally\nwhere you want to be\nyou want to be where your life is\nbecause at the end of the day that's all\nyou really have be mindful of where your\nthoughts are are you remembering how she\nmoaned are you fantasizing about the\nnext encounter if you spend more and\nmore time with the mental construct of a\nwoman in the privacy of your own\nConsciousness you are basically training\nyourself to fall in love with the idea\nof who she is that is unwise gentlemen\nbe mindful of this and redirect your\nattention to other things your work your\nfriends your Fitness or just what's\nright in front of you next up if you've\nonly known yourself if you only known\neach other for a few weeks you should\nnot be texting every day let alone all\nday every day constant communication\ndramatically accelerates the emotional\nintimacy process I understand that it\nmight be reassuring and exciting maybe\neven flattering for an attractive woman\nto blow up your phone however if you\nrespond to everything she sends you then\nshe is functionally dictating the\nCadence of\ninteraction this is the most common way\nthat men slip into a woman's frame\nwithout realizing it get back to her\nwhen you want to get back to her she's\ngoing to have whatever emotional\nresponse she's going to have that's not\nup to you and if she throws a tantrum\nbecause you kept her waiting as opposed\nto feeling grateful that you got a\nresponse then you just learned a\nvaluable piece of information didn't\nyou here's another one inappropriate\ndisclosure some of you guys are going\nout on like 12-hour dates where by the\nend of them you end up sharing your\ndeepest darkest secrets with each other\nall of your previous relationship trauma\nand a bridged history of your entire\nchildhood and your most sincere wishes\nfor the future why are you doing this\nyou do not yet know who this person is\nyou do not yet know what they are going\ngoing to do with this information this\nis like Achilles telling some girl he\njust met you know I don't really like to\nadmit it but I'm a little soft around\nthe ankles like why would he do that the\nrule of thumb is that if you're not yet\nready to trust this person with your\nbank account information then you're not\nget ready for this level of\nvulnerability after all that's just your\nmoney you can make more money trust me\nbeing robbed is easier to recover from\nthan a toxic relationship though\nobviously I'm not recommending either\npeople make decisions with their heart\nthat they would never make with their\nmoney they believe that they can just\nget over things as a therapist let me\ntell you that it is actually fairly\ndifficult for most people to just get\nover things and getting emotionally\ninvolved with the wrong with the wrong\nperson is right near the top of the list\nof things that are hard to just get over\nso until you trust someone with your\nmoney don't trust them with your heart\njust be two consenting adults who enjoy\neach other's company these three things\nmentally obsessing about someone\ncommunicating constantly being too\nemotionally vulnerable these three\nthings are how people fall in love with\neach other that's how men become\nemotionally invested now I'm not saying\nto never become emotionally invested in\na woman just that you damn well better\nbe sure that that woman is safe and\ntrustworthy and competent and loyal\nbefore you do so and if you're unwilling\nto take the time to figure that out\nbeforehand you are just asking for pain\nand don't you have enough of that in\nyour life as it is so get a handle on\nyour emotions gentlemen and don't be\nstupid what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know in\nthe comments below and if you've gotten\nthis far you might as well like this\nepisode And subscribe to this channel\nyou may also consider becoming a channel\nmember with perks like the priority
