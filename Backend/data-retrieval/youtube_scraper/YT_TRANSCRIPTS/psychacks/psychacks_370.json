    "transcript": "laziness is tough now one thing that I\nmight do if if I was in a session with\nthem is to begin to create some space\nare if you're a lazy person then there's\nnothing I can do about it's like you're\njust lazy that's how you are that's how\nyou think about it I can't change who\nyou are intrinsically but maybe\nsometimes you fall into lazy Behavior\npatterns maybe you just let some things\nslide maybe you you don't honor your\ncommitments to yourself because there\nyou don't see that there's any\nconsequences to doing that so I create a\nbit of a distance between that self\nattribution and who that person feels\nthat he is because if you are lazy you\nare dumb what are you gonna do to change\nthat right but if you have lazy\nTendencies or you do things that get in\nyour own way those behaviors can be\nshifted"
