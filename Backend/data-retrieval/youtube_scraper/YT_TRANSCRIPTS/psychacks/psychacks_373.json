    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is men's\ngreatest enemy and I'm talking about\nmen's greatest enemy in the context of\nthe sexual Marketplace what is the one\nthing that most prevents men from\ngetting the relationships they want from\nthe women they want to have them with\nit's very simple gentlemen in a word\nmen's greatest enemy is\ncowardice your greatest enemy is\ncowardice everything that you want with\nrespect to women is on the other side of\nthat cowardice now I understand that\nthat is a very charged word and I'm not\nusing it lightly it's the appropriate\nword as we'll see there are three main\nways that men allow cowardice to\nobstruct their success in the sexual\nMarketplace first they're just afraid of\nwomen they're afraid of approaching them\nthey're afraid of being rejected they're\nafraid of being called creepy they're\nafraid of leading the interaction in the\ndirection of a sexual encounter men\nespecially young men just Harbor a lot\nof fear about women and that fear is\nparalyzing it prevents men from\napproaching women that they're actually\nattracted to out in the real world and\nthat fear is cowering it motivates men\nto hide their sexual interest which\nbasically means that they end up in the\nfriend zone over and over again feeling\nafraid is okay it's perfect ly normal\nunder certain circumstances allowing\nthat fear to guide your behavior is not\npreferring obedience to your fear over\nand above obedience to your Higher Goals\nis cowardice for better or worse as men\nyou are expected to approach and\ninitiate in the sexual Marketplace if\nyou cannot overcome your fear to\napproach a woman declare your intentions\nand escalate the interaction towards\nsexuality\nit's just not going to happen for you my\ndudes and I would highly encourage you\nto become more afraid of that outcome\nthan of anything an uninterested woman\ncould potentially do to you check out my\nepisode be afraid of your fear if you'd\nlike to hear the story of how I overcame\nmy own approach anxiety now the second\nway that men are obstructed by cowardice\nin the sexual Marketplace is that they\nhave significant trouble holding firm in\nthe face of Fe female\nemotionality a lot of men believe in the\nprivacy of their own imaginations that\nthey would have the courage to hold the\nline against a hostile Force confidently\nrepel a home Invader or take on three\nguys in a bar brawl however these same\nmen will fold like a deck of cards when\na woman is angry or a woman starts to\ncry or when a woman uses shaming tactics\nor when a woman gives an ultimatum Etc\ntheir own evoked emotion in response to\na woman's emotionality is so intolerable\nto them that they give in it's like my\nguys do you really think that you could\nstand up to a bunch of threatening men\nif you can't handle one single woman\ncatering to a woman's emotionality\nagainst your better judgment is a form\nof cowardice born out of a scarcity\nmentality given the first form of\ncowardice already discussed it can be\nvery difficult for a man to get a woman\nyou might then think well so I can't\nmess this up if she leaves me who knows\nif I'm going to find anyone else who\nwill want me and as bad as this is It's\npreferable to being alone right uh not\nnecessarily my brother and this is how\nmen more or less get emotionally\nmanipulated into relationships that\naren't in their best interests as they\ngive up more and more in a misguided\nattempt to make a woman happy or at\nleast temporarily less unhappy remember\nobedience to fear over and above\nobedience to Higher Goals is cowardice\nin this case the cowardice is obedience\nto the fear of emotional pain heartbreak\nloneliness guilt and shame over and\nabove obedience to one's overarching\nMission and chosen path in life my dudes\nI would highly encourage you to become\nmore afraid of losing yourself in a\nrelationship that doesn't serve you than\nof losing any particular particular\nwoman and this is because among other\nthings men who do lose themselves in\nsuch a relationship often end up losing\nboth the woman and the relationship in\nthe long run anyway now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom its message because it's Word of\nMouth referrals like that that really\nhelp to make the channel grow and you\ncan also hit the thanks button and tip\nme in proportion to the value you feel\nyou've derived from this episode I don't\ndo product placements or corporate\nsponsors this is how I keep the lights\non I really appreciate your support\nthank you now I get it it can be hard to\nsay no to a woman when she's crying or\nupset or when she's angry and critical\nor when she threatens to walk away but\nthis is the moment to hold firm this is\nwhen you have to hold the line in the\nface of the advancing forces and you do\nthis because the relationship you\nactually want is on the other side of\nthis moment you have to trust me on this\nbecause once a woman realizes that she C\nthat you cannot be swayed by her\nemotionality she will eventually stop\ntrying either because she learns that\nshe has to use other methods to get what\nshe wants or because she decides to\nactually leave in order to find an\neasier Mark either way your situation\nshould improve and the best way to\nstrengthen your resolve to hold the line\nagainst female emotionality is to\nincrease your own capacity to tolerate\nnegative\nemotion Let Her Cry her sadness isn't\ngoing to kill her how can it possibly\nhurt you let her pout her frustration\nisn't going to kill her how can it\npossibly hurt you no matter how\nuncomfortable the situation is there's a\nvery good chance that whatever she's\nfeeling will be gone in a few hours why\nmake a potentially life-altering\ndecision that compromises your own\nVision just because you want to escape\nthat difficult moment a little faster\nyou're not coming out ahead on that one\ncowardice in the face of female\nemotionality and threatened scarcity is\nwhat tends to trap men in relationships\nthat don't serve\nthem now and the third way that men are\nobstructed by cowardice in the sexual\nMarketplace is by absconding from\nleadership look it takes courage to\nstand up and Lead it takes courage to\nsay I'm going to be in charge or I'm the\nhead of this family and there's a very\nprevalent fear among men today that any\nrelationship that deviates from a very\nnarrow interpretation of\negalitarianism is misogynistic and\noppressive and disrespectful to women\nthis is drilled into men's heads from\nthe moment they start to talk\nmen and women are equal men and women\nare equal yes men and women are equal\nbefore God in the sense that one\nparticular like being is not more\ninherently valuable than another right\nlike all men read humans are created\nequal not born equal which they clearly\nare not but created equal however this\npart has largely been forgotten and men\nand women are equal has increased ly\nbeen misunderstood as men and women are\nthe same and they are not men and women\nare different and what is good for the\ngoose isn't always good for the gander\nand while some women are more\ncomfortable with egalitarian\nrelationships it's generally not women\nwho get offended when I talk about\nrelationship inequality as a positive\nit's men the truth is that most women\ndon't want an equal they want wants\nsomeone better who is capable of\nsignificantly improving their quality of\nlife this is the basic tenant of\nhypergamy women mate and date up status\nhierarchies they don't really want a\npeer or a colleague they want an older\nstronger more successful more\nexperienced more dominant man this\nallows them to relax more and more into\ntheir feminine which can significantly\nreduce conflict and strife in a\nrelationship so don't let the loud\nshrill voices of the few dissuade you an\negalitarian relationship is not what\nmost women actually want and it takes\ncourage to say no we are not going to be\nat the same level in this relationship\nI'm going to lead and you get to choose\nwhether or not you want to follow and\nlet me tell you in my younger years when\nI was trying to give women the\negalitarian relationships that I thought\nthey wanted it was nothing but conflict\nand drama and heartache it never worked\nout the turning point in my life came\nwhen I decided to start taking a more\ndominant role in my relationships I\nbegan to unapologetically say to women\nthis is what I want and this is where\nI'm going and if you'd like to come\nalong for the ride I'd be happy to have\nyou and since then I have had peaceful\nrespectful and loving relationships it\nis without a doubt the change that has\nmade the sing single greatest difference\nin improving the quality of my\nrelationships in my life and it can take\nballs to say that especially in today's\nday and age so those are the three ways\nthat cowardice is standing in your way\ngentlemen resolve those issues and you\ntoo can have the relationships you want\nwith the women you want to have them\nwith what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know in\nthe comments below and if you've gotten\nthis far you might as well like this\nepisode And subscribe to this channel\nyou may also
