    "transcript": "we respect people who have the power to\nhurt us but who choose not to the power\nto do good has the same root as the\npower to inflict harm namely power and a\nperson who cannot harm like someone who\nhas no capacity for harm generally is\nnot someone who has the power to do much\ngood and if you can neither help nor\nharm someone else then you are\nirrelevant at best and at the mercy of\nthose who can at worst now it's\nimportant to keep in mind that this\ncapacity to harm does doesn't\nnecessarily have to be physical it can\nbe that but it doesn't have to be that\nthe capacity to harm could be Financial\nor relational or emotional and it's the\nawareness that someone has the ability\nto hurt us in some way that motivates\nmore kindly and respectful action\nrelative to someone who we feel will\nnever retaliate against us this is why\ncountries who participate in all kinds\nof treaties and pacts and alliances\nstill have armies"
