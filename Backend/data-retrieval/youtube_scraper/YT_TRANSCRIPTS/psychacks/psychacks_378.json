    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is fear is\nthe basis of\nrespect in my consultations I talked to\nmany different folks from many different\nwalks of life however one of the\nrecurring themes in my consultations is\ndisrespect these men struggle with\nfeeling disrespected disrespected by\nother men and disrespected by the women\nin their lives if they're fortunate\nenough to have any and I often respond\nto this complaint as I will do now by\nsharing a brief Parable this Parable\ncomes from the Hindu tradition and it\nkind of goes like this once upon a time\na cobra lived on the outskirts of a\nvillage this snake had bitten several\npeople who had subsequently died so\npeople came to fear and avoid the snake\none day a monk visited the village and\nthe Cobra confided in the monk the snake\ncomplained monk I'm so lonely everyone\nhere is afraid afraid of me they avoid\nme like the plague please help me what\nam I doing wrong and the monk responded\nsnake the reason why people are afraid\nof you is because your bite is venomous\nand you're killing people if you don't\nbite people anymore you won't have this\nproblem and the snake nodded and said oh\nokay that makes sense I I'll stop biting\npeople yeah and it slithered off into\nthe grass a week later the snake\nreturned to the Monk and it looked\nterrible it had a black eye and its tail\nwas bent and someone had take a chunk\nout of its side and the monk exclaimed\nsnake oh my goodness what happened to\nyou and the snake replied oh monk I\nfollowed your advice I stopped biting\npeople but as soon as people figured out\nthat I wasn't going to bite them all of\ntheir fear turned into anger they\nruthlessly attacked me and I barely\nescaped with my life I I kind of liked\nit better when they just avoided me this\nis much more painful and the monk\nreplied oh snake\nI only told you not to bite I never told\nyou not to\nhiss and that's the end of the parable\nand this is the moral of the story the\npoint that people who struggle with this\nissue of disrespect need to understand\nis this it's important for people to\nhear you\nhiss if you present yourself as so Meek\nand agreeable that you would never\npossibly bite anyone under any circum\nances then you're going to get it like\nthe snake in the second half of the\nstory you might end up as everyone's\npersonal Whipping Boy they'll be angry\nwith other people but they'll take it\nout on you why because they wouldn't be\nso sure that the people that they're\nactually angry with wouldn't retaliate\nin this way you might actually end up\nabsorbing a great deal of the pain and\nsuffering that other people would like\nto inflict on others but are too afraid\nto do so\nbecause of the potential\nconsequences but there apparently aren't\nany consequences to treating you with\nanger and disrespect for whatever reason\nprobably due to your own judgments about\nanger and aggression you have decided\nthat implementing consequences is just\nnot a possible outcome of this\ninteraction and this is part of the\nreason why family relationships have the\npotential to be the most dysfunctional\nrelationships on the planet people\nbelieve on the one hand that no matter\nwhat they do there will always be a\nplace for them in the family and on the\nother hand that no matter what another\nperson does they can't turn their back\non their family and let me tell you\nneither one of those beliefs is true now\nbefore I go any further if you're liking\nwhat you're hearing please consider\nsending this episode to someone who\nmight benefit from its message because\nit's Word of Mouth referrals like this\nthat really help to make the channel\ngrow you can also hit the thanks button\nand tip me in proportion to the value\nyou feel you've received from this\nepisode I really depend on your support\nit helps to make all this possible and I\nreally appreciate it thank\nyou in any case hissing is important\nthis means that you are able and willing\nto communicate under certain\ncircumstances that you are someone to be\nreckoned with there has to be something\nin you that other people fear because\nthough we're rather squeamish to admit\nit fear is the basis of respect we\nrespect people who have the power to\nhurt us but who choose not to I'll say\nthat again we respect people who have\nthe power to hurt us but who choose not\nto I discussed this more in my episode\ndon't be harmless that the power to do\ngood has the same root as the power to\ninflict harm namely power and a person\nwho cannot harm like someone who has no\ncapacity for harm generally is not\nsomeone who has the power to do much\ngood and if you can neither help nor\nharm someone else then you are\nirrelevant at best and at the mercy of\nthose who can at worst now it's\nimportant to keep in mind that this\ncapacity to harm doesn't necessarily\nhave to be physical it can be that but\nit doesn't have to be that the capacity\nto harm could be Financial or relational\nor\nemotional and it's the awareness that\nsomeone has the ability to hurt us in\nsome way that motivates more kindly and\nrespectful action relative to someone\nwho we feel will never retaliate against\nus this is why countries who participate\nin all kinds of treaties and pacts and\nalliances still have armies it's not\nnoble words and good intentions that\nkeep people on their side of the fence\nit's guns and if if you don't have guns\nyou'd better be able to harm others in\nsome other way like through their money\nwhich is how for example Switzerland has\nmanaged to stay neutral and Sovereign\ndespite centuries of War being waged\naround it so the point is that in order\nto be respected by others others must\nfear the consequences of their own\naggression and disrespect and this\ngenerally requires having some leverage\nover them this could look like being\nbigger and stronger or being smarter and\nmore cunning or enjoying professional\nsuperiority or shaping group opinion or\ncontrolling funding sources or\npossessing another person's heart etc\netc in conjunction with the willingness\nto lean on that leverage as appropriate\nand in general just like an actual\nphysical lever the bigger the leverage\nthe less you actually have to lean on it\nto make people move this is why Teddy\nRoosevelt's motto was to speak softly\nand carry a big stick if your stick is\nbig enough you don't have to raise your\nvoice or get angry or make threats or\nbecome aggressive and that's because\nyour stick will speak for you to receive\nrespect you need to communicate to\nothers that there is something in you to\nbe feared this isn't sufficient to\nreceive respect but without meeting this\ncondition respect generally doesn't\noccur and this might be why King Solomon\nargued that the highest wisdom was to\nkeep God Commandments and to live in the\nfear the fear of the Lord when people do\nnot fear the consequences of their\nactions they behave less wisely so even\nwisdom like respect might require\nappropriate fear eliminating it entirely\nmay not be to our benefit something to\nconsider what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know in\nthe comments below and if you've gotten\nthis far you might as
