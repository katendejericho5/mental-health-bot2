    "transcript": "when it comes to fighting with a woman\nthe only winning move is not to play the\ngreatest Victory is that which requires\nno battle and this is a worthwhile goal\nbecause let me tell you gentlemen my\nlife has been so much more peaceful so\nmuch more loving and so much more\nenjoyable since I figured out how to do\nthis and I'm here to share my secrets\nwith you today if I can do it you can do\nit too this may go without saying but\nenjoying a conflict free relationship\nwith a woman starts with appropriate\nselection at this stage of my life I now\nbelieve that 90% of a successful\nrelationship is choosing the right\nperson as I've discussed previously you\ncan't have any relationship with anyone\nwhat does this mean well in the context\nof this discussion it means that you\ncannot have a peaceful and easygoing\nrelationship with a woman who is\ndisagreeable or provocative or addicted\nto drama or unable to regulate her own\nemotions Etc it's just not possible"
