    "transcript": "as a therapist I can tell you that it's\nactually very difficult to tell the\ntruth to a person in a way that he or\nshe can hear it the truth is generally\ntough for people to hear it's bitter\nmedicine so it typically requires some\nfinesse to be able to speak the truth in\nsuch a way that it isn't automatically\nrejected and while it is very difficult\nto tell the truth in a way that one\nperson can hear it it's almost\nimpossible to tell the truth in a way\nthat two people can hear it\nsimultaneously the best way for one\nperson to hear this truth will not be\nthe best way for another person to hear\nit and the upshot of this is that the\ntruth is typically what gets compromised\nthe truth is diluted to the point that\ntwo people can hear it and this is often\nnot nearly as effective as just giving\nit to each person individually in their\nown way"
