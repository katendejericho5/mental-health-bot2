    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nnever fight with a\nwoman it has been many years since I\nlast fought with a woman gentleman and I\nvery much intend to keep it that way my\nfriends there is absolutely no point in\nfighting with a woman for the simple\nreason that you cannot win because of\nthe emotional nature of most women when\nyou lose you lose and when you win you\nstill lose when it comes to fighting\nwith a woman the only winning move is\nnot to play much like sunu counil\nthousands of years ago the greatest\nVictory is that which requires no battle\nand this is a worthwhile goal because\nlet me tell you gentlemen my life has\nbeen so much more peaceful so much more\nloving and so much more enjoyable since\nI figured out how to do this and I'm\nhere to share my secrets with you today\nif I can do it you can do it too this\nmay go without saying but enjoying a\nconflict free relationship with a woman\nstarts with appropriate selection at\nthis stage of my life I now believe that\n90% of a successful relationship is\nchoosing the right person as I've\ndiscussed previously you can't have any\nrelationship with anyone what does this\nmean well in the context of this\ndiscussion it means that you cannot have\na peaceful and easygoing relationship\nwith a woman who is disagreeable or\nprovocative or addicted to drama or\nunable to regulate her own emotions Etc\nit's just not possible and you may need\nto examine yourselves just like I did to\ndetermine why it is you may be actively\nworking to keep such women in your lives\nnow the bad news is that there are a lot\nof such women out there especially when\nwe're talking about younger women\nhowever the good news is that these\nwomen tell on themselves all the time\nthey're actually pretty easy to identify\nfairly early in the courtship process\nand once you\ndo just stop pursuing her let that plate\nfall as I've previously discussed dating\nis an extended hiring process imagine\nyou were interviewing a woman for a job\nwho was difficult and argumentative in\nthe very first meeting a worthwhile\ncompany with plenty of interested\napplicants would have no problem wishing\nher all the best with her search you\nneed to get comfortable doing the same\nand the pathway to doing so is\ncultivating optionality until you get to\nthis point gentlemen you're probably\nthinking with the wrong head and you\nwill continue to suffer until you bring\nthat thought process a little higher so\na big part of the solution here is to\nrefrain from becoming emotionally\nentangled L with a woman until you've\ndetermined that she is someone with whom\nyou can have a peaceful conflict-free\nrelationship so let's assume you've\nalready done that like the wise high\nvalue man that you are does this mean\nthat it's all smooth sailing not\nnecessarily however what I'd like you to\nconsider is that whether you fight with\na woman might have more to do with you\nthan you might realize just like women\ncan be disrespectful to men without\nrealizing it and as I've said it's their\nresponsibility to stay on the sunny side\nof the unbreakable rule men can be\nantagonistic without realizing it and\nit's your responsibility to clarify your\ntone when speaking with a woman I'm\nusing the word clarify in the sense of\nclean up just like I've advised women to\nremove every disrespectful word tone and\ngesture from their communication with\nmen I'm advising you men to remove every\nhint of annoyance or aggravation or\njudgment or really any negative emotion\nfrom your communication with women let\nme\nexplain one way to think about women is\nthat they are incubators whatever you\ngive them they will magnify and\nreflect magnify and reflect that's\nfeminine nature give them one tiny\nlittle sperm\nand 9 months later they will give you\nback a whole human being to my knowledge\nin every culture that has existed on\nthis planet the Moon is feminine and the\nSun is masculine and why is the Moon\nbright she shines through the reflected\nlight of the Sun the quality of the\nMoonlight is almost entirely determined\nby the quality of the sunlight do you\nunderstand if the sun gives off good\nlight then the sun is much more likely\nto enjoy that good light when it is\nreflected back at it of course this\nisn't entirely up to the sun because the\nMoon is always shifting through its\ncycle but this is the sun's best\npossible move the idea here is to remove\nevery word tone or gesture that could be\nconstrued as judgmental condescending\ncontemptuous or Ang angry from your\ncommunication with women why because if\nyou give a woman even a hint of\nirritation she's going to magnify that\ninto aggravation and reflect it back at\nyou and if you give her aggravation in\nreturn she's going to magnify that into\nexasperation and reflect that back to\nyou and before you know it you're off to\nthe races in any case my point is that\nthe Genesis of the conflict can often be\ntraced back to some tiny little trace of\nnegative emotion in your tone of voice\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've derived from this\nepisode I really depend on your support\nI don't do a bunch of corporate\nsponsorships or product placements so\nthis is how I keep the lights on I\nreally appreciate it the more I get the\nmore I can devote to the channel thank\nyou\nnow at this point you might be saying to\nyourself this is\nOrion does having some tiny little trace\nof a negative emotion in my tone justify\na woman flying off the handle why does\nshe have to make such a big deal out of\nsomething so small are you taking the\nwoman's side here to this I would\nrespond I hear you my dude for a long\nlong time I thought as you did and what\nI have since real realized is that as\ndifficult as it is it's actually easier\nto remove every trace of negative\nemotion from my voice then it is to\nconvince a woman that her emotional\nresponse is disproportionate to the\nsituation that just doesn't work and I'm\nnothing if not a pragmatist I want what\nworks what is effective believing that\nwomen shouldn't make a big deal out of\nsomething so small is at odds with the\nfeminine principle of magnify and\nreflect and when I accept that this\nprinciple might be true a lot of\nfeminine Behavior makes sense which is a\npretty good test of a theory also I'm on\nthe side of peace and higher\nunderstanding a lot of women have a\nbunch of nonsense in their heads which\nmakes relationships with them difficult\nif not impossible but that doesn't mean\nthat we men have perfect clarity either\nclarifying our tone helps us take care\nof our side of the street now removing\nall traces of negativity from your tone\nis actually pretty difficult it will\ntake some time to accomplish basically\nbecause you have to learn to be\nperpetually mindful mindful of your\nwords mindful of your emotions mindful\nof your expressions and this ultimately\nrequires you to be mindful of your\nthoughts as your thoughts are the\nUpstream source of all the other\nbehaviors as you do this you will likely\nto appreciate that you may be expressing\nnegativity especially\njudgmentalism more often than you\nimagine you may even have been doing it\nunconsciously and unintentionally in any\ncase you will likely feel better in your\nown subjectivity when you start to\nclarify your thinking as well you're the\none who's actually in direct contact\nwith those negative emotions anyway\nwouldn't you prefer not to feel annoyed\nor aggravated or\njudgmental so what does this mean does\nthis mean that you can never disagree\nwith a woman or correct her when she's\nwrong or check her when she's out of\nbounds absolutely not but might you need\nto find ways to disagree correct or\ncheck without expressing irritation\ncontempt or negative judgment\nabsolutely now the flip side of this is\nthat sometimes men can take this advice\ntoo far paradoxically the other way that\nmen can unwittingly provoke arguments\nwith their women is by removing all the\nemotion from their communication and\nthis is because removing all the emotion\nfrom your voice can actually be pretty\nscary to a woman it's like she can't\nfeel you there with her in that moment\nand that will likely Spike her\ninsecurity which as I discussed in why\nwomen pick fights is one of the primary\nreasons women can be provocative\nthemselves\nremoving emotion from their voices is\nactually a failing of intersex\nunderstanding let me briefly explain\nemotion is generally provocative I mean\none of its main uses is to motivate\nemotion to create motion so when men\nhave a problem with other men and we're\nnot looking to escalate the situation\nany further as a rule of thumb we're\ngoing to take all the emotion out of our\nvoices we're GNA talk nice and slow and\nwe're going to be very calm and we're\ngoing to resolve this issue with\nrational\ndiscussion you see what I did with my\ntone of voice there men what you have to\nunderstand is that women pay much more\nattention to tone than we do if you take\nall the emotion out of your voice what\ndoes she\n[Music]\nhear\ndoes that sound warm and loving does\nthat sound like you're on the same team\nnot really and that's going to provoke\nher anxiety and insecurity because\nsuddenly she feels as though the basis\nof the relationship is being threatened\nand this in turn may lead to her\nescalating the situation in a\ncounterproductive attempt to reassure\nherself that you are still emotionally\ninvested in her so you want to remove\nall hints of negative emotion from your\ntone but you don't want to remove all\nemotion entirely just listen to how I'm\ntalking now the goal is to imbue your\nwords with like an undifferentiated\nwarmth and let me tell you if you have\nwarmth in your voice and a little\ntwinkle in your eye you can say pretty\nmuch anything you want to a woman and\nshe will listen to you without being\nreactive ideally she'll even join with\nyou and you can laugh together at\nwhatever Ridiculousness she was on about\nnow so what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know in\nthe comments below and if you've gotten\nthis far you might as well like this\nepisode And subscribe to this channel\nyou may also consider becoming a channel\nmember with perks like the priority\nreview of comments or booking a paid\nconsultation as always thank you for\nlistening"
