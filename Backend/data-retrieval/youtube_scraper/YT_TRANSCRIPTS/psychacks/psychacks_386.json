    "transcript": "I'm not a big fan of compromise\nespecially in Intimate Relationships\ncompromise is two people not getting\nwhat they want at which point you have\nto ask what is the point of this\nrelationship anyway in my opinion it's a\nbetter idea to be selfish and to find\nsomeone else who's selfishness you can\nlive with on the other hand compromise\nsuggests a negotiated process which is\noften counterproductive for two obvious\nreasons first and this may come as a\nshock to you but the people who show up\nto couples counseling have often been\nacting very badly in their relationships\nthe reason why a relationship is\ndysfunctional could be that at least one\nof the people involved is acting like an\nemotional terrorist throwing Tantrums\nbeing bullying and aggressive hijacking\nfamily events threatening to leave if\ndemands are not met etc etc and you know\nwhat it's not a good idea to negotiate\nwith terrorists"
