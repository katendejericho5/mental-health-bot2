    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is couples\ntherapy almost never works so I might\ntake some heat for this one but I am not\na big fan of coup's therapy I have not\nseen it associated with a high degree of\npositive outcomes and I think this is\ntrue for a number of reasons several of\nwhich I will be discussing in this\nepisode so let's Jump Right In first and\nforemost what many folks who have never\nbeen to coup's therapy often fail to\nappreciate is that in most couples\ntherapy the client is the\nrelationship the client is not the two\nindividual people in the room the client\nis the relationship between them as such\nthe therapist is going to be advocating\nfor the best interests of the\nrelationship this means that the\ntherapeutic intent is typically to\nperpetuate the relationship or in rare\ncases when both parties are on the same\npage with termination to help dissolve\nthe relationship harmoniously so why is\nthis problematic well in the first place\nit means that one or both of the parties\nmight be supported to stay in a\nrelationship with someone they\nabsolutely have no business being in a\nrelationship to begin with a couple's\ntherapist is not going to turn to the\nman in the middle of a session and say\nmy dude you need to get as far away from\nthat woman as poss possible personality\ndisorders hardly ever go away entirely\nand it can take years of hard work just\nto get them under control you'd be\nbetter off cutting this off and finding\nsomeone else as quickly as you can by\nthe same token the therapist is not\ngoing to turn to the woman in the room\nand say this guy is never going to\ncommit to you no matter what sacrifices\nyou make for the relationship if you\nwant a family you are wasting your time\nhere and let me tell you in certain\nsituations this is precisely the the\nfeedback that people need to hear\nwithholding this feedback because your\nclient is the relationship irrespective\nof the best interests of the individuals\nin that relationship does not sit right\nwith me personally now in the second\nplace when the client is the\nrelationship it means that working\nthrough problems generally requires some\nmeasure of negotiated concession if\nyou're not already aware I'm not a big\nfan of compromise especially in Intimate\nRelationships compromise is two people\nnot getting what they want at which\npoint you have to ask what is the point\nof this relationship anyway in my\nopinion it's a better idea to be selfish\nand to find someone else whose\nselfishness you can live with on the\nother hand compromise suggests a\nnegotiated process which is often\ncounterproductive for two obvious\nreasons first and this may come as is a\nshock to you but the people who show up\nto couples counseling have often been\nacting very badly in their relationships\nthe reason why a relationship is\ndysfunctional could be that at least one\nof the people involved is acting like an\nemotional terrorist throwing Tantrums\nbeing bullying and aggressive hijacking\nfamily events threatening to leave if\ndemands are not met etc etc and you know\nwhat it's not a good idea to negotiate\nwith\nterrorists coming to the bargaining\ntable only when the other side behaves\nsufficiently badly only reinforces bad\nbehavior and functionally guarantees\nthat you will see more bad behavior in\nthe future appeasement didn't work for\nthe Nazis and it's probably not going to\nwork for your\nrelationship now if you have The\nMisfortune of being in a relationship\nwith an emotional terrorist then you\nlikely need to take a long hard look at\nthe person in the mirror because this is\nyour fault at least to some extent after\nall you're the one who chose to be in a\nrelationship with this person for some\nreason you likely have some unhealed\nemotional wound that left you vulnerable\nto such an individual and that healing\nis something that you could more\neffectively do in your own individual\ntherapy because as you'll recall the Rel\nrelationship is the client in coup's\ntherapy get that sorted out yourself and\nyour path forward in the relationship\nmight just become clearer on its own now\nbefore I go any further if you're liking\nwhat you're hearing please consider\nsending this episode to someone who\nmight benefit from its message because\nit's Word of Mouth referrals like this\nthat really help to make the channel\ngrow and you can also hit the thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've received from this\nepisode I really depend on your support\nI don't do a lot of product placements\nor corporate sponsorships I don't do any\nof them uh so I really depend on your\nsupport to keep all of this going I\nreally appreciate it thank you very much\nall right and the second reason why\nnegotiated concession often doesn't work\nin couples's therapy is because one of\nthe most common issues that couples\ntypically bring into the counseling room\nis their sex life or their lack thereof\nand you cannot negotiate desire you\ncannot say get more sex more often in\nexchange for doing more of the housework\nit doesn't work that way now you can\nincrease desire in a relationship but\nthe pathway to doing so is almost\ncompletely antithetical to the couple's\ntherapy process it involves less\ncommunication less time together more\nmystery greater spontaneity etc etc and\nthis can be accomplished\nunilaterally that is if you just change\nhow you show up in the relationship it\nwill force a shift in the dynamic of the\nrelationship and you definitely don't\nneed your partner's permission to be\nmore attractive in your own relationship\nso just focus on doing that as opposed\nto talking about the lack of desire\nwhich typically only makes the problem\nworse now here's yet another thing to\nconsider as a therapist I can tell you\nthat it's actually very difficult to\ntell the truth to a person in a way that\nhe or she can hear it the truth is\ngenerally tough for people to hear it's\nbitter medicine so it typically requires\nsome finesse to be able to speak the\ntruth in such a way that it isn't\nautomatically rejected and while it is\nvery difficult to tell the truth in a\nway that one person can hear it it's\nalmost impossible to tell the TRU truth\nin a way that two people can hear it\nsimultaneously the best way for one\nperson to hear this truth will not be\nthe best way for another person to hear\nit and the upshot of this is that the\ntruth is typically what gets compromised\nthe truth is diluted to the point that\ntwo people can hear it and this is often\nnot nearly as effective as just giving\nit to each person individually in their\nown\nway here's another reason coupl therapy\nis more or less predic on the belief\nthat most problems that people\nexperience in their relationships are\njust based on some lack of understanding\nor some failure of communication so the\nsolution of course must be more\ncommunication and mutual understanding\nand in my experience this is not the\ncase on some level it's not important to\nunderstand why say one person is\nthrowing temper tantrums it's important\nthat the temper tantrums\nstop perpetuating the belief that say a\nwoman is throwing a tantrum because she\ndoesn't feel sufficiently validated or\ncared for is gaslighting because there\nare plenty of women who don't throw\nTantrums when those same conditions or\nWorse are met and the person who may\nbelieve that these are sufficient\ngrounds for a tantrum would likely be\nbetter served in individual therapy\nanyway the point is that certain things\ndon't need to be understood\nthey just need to change and\nunderstanding does not by itself\ninevitably lead to change some things\njust don't have a place in a healthy\nloving relationship and acting as though\nthe real issue is a lack of appreciation\nfor the reasons why bad behavior exists\nas opposed to the bad behavior itself is\nto my mind Shifting the blame to the\nother person in the relationship\nunfortunately this can happen in coup's\ntherapy I imagine that Coupes therapy\ncould be helpful to certain people\ndealing with certain classes of problems\nhowever I haven't seen it produce\npositive outcomes in the vast majority\nof cases what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know in\nthe comments below and if you've gotten\nthis far you might as well like this\nepisode And subscribe to
