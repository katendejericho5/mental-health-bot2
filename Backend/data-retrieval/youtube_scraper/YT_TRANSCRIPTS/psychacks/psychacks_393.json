    "transcript": "in the sexual Marketplace if the man\ndoesn't initiate nothing happens however\nif he does initiate he automatically\nbecomes less attractive than he\notherwise would have been just by\nkeeping his mouth shut and doing nothing\nbut if he does nothing then nothing\nhappens yeah pursuing a woman puts her\nin the role of the adored which as I\nexplained in it's better for women to be\nadorers is not where women actually want\nto be and one of the reasons why this is\nthe case is because it's much harder for\na woman to look up to respect and be\nattracted to a man when he's in the\nadorer role if he's looking up at her\nshe is looking down at him the very Act\nof approaching or declaring his feelings\ncan instantly knock a point or two off a\nman's perceived sexual Marketplace value\nso this is the double bind the man is\nkind of damned if he does and damned if\nhe doesn't and this will only affect men\nas long as men are the only ones\nexpected to initiate"
