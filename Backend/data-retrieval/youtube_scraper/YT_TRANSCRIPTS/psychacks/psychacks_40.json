    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the\n50,000 dollar\nbeer this is part two in my three-part\nseries on why successful men use escorts\nso be sure to check out part one before\nproceeding in the first episode I\ndiscuss how traditional dating becomes\nprohibitively expensive as a function of\na man's success however that discussion\nwas still from an ideal perspective all\nthe expenses associated with dating are\nexacerbated when the woman in question\nwants to take it slow women the success\nof this dating strategy is inversely\nproportional to your\nage the younger you are the slower you\ncan take it however this is not a\nstrategy that works for older women I\nspoke with a woman in her early 50s\nrecently who had two kids by two\nprevious marriages and who told me that\nshe wasn't willing to have sex before\nmarriage with any man she is currently\ndating you can't make this up as may be\nunsurprising she has been single for\nquite some time I spoke with another\nwoman recently she was 41 who was\nlooking to get married and start a\nfamily she told me that she blamed her\ninability to have secure this\nrelationship already on the fact that in\nthe past she jumped into bed with men\ntoo quickly I ass assured her this was\nnot the problem women should be very\nsexually generous with the men they're\nhoping to catch the problem was not what\nshe was doing the problem was who she\nwas doing it with as I've said before\nwomen do the right things with the wrong\nmen but rather than examine her tendency\nof targeting the wrong men she decided\nto shoot herself in the foot by making a\nrelationship with her even more\nexpensive than it otherwise would have\nbeen by making men wait longer for sex\nnow she wouldn't sleep with a man until\nat least the third date what women need\nto understand is that expecting time and\nattention and emotion and\nprovision without providing sex in\nreturn is an extremely one-sided and\nexpensive proposition in the dating game\nit's the gendered equivalent of a man\ninviting you over for sex and then\nkicking you out when he's finished it's\none side getting what it wants at the\nexpense of the\nother more structured women like these\ntwo have rules about how the dating\nprocess needs to proceed before they\nparticipate in the sexual dimension of\nthe relationship in most cases these\nwomen are not worth dating they're just\ntoo expensive and if they're too\nexpensive for the average guy they are\nabsolutely exorbitant for the successful\none think about it if a woman won't\nsleep with a man until the third date as\na rule then at $5,200 a date that\namounts to\n$155,600 for a sexual encounter if the\nencounter actually occurs after all\nthere's no guarantee that the woman\nwon't change her mind or feel there\nisn't sufficient chemistry at any point\nin the process and I would like women to\nconsider that 15 grand is an inordinate\namount of money to spend to get to know\nyou like would you give up $15,000 to go\non three dates with a man especially if\nthe dates didn't actually involve the\nthing you might most be looking for I\ndon't think you\nwould and that's why these successful\nmen aren't going to date structured\nwomen or are very quickly going to be\nlooking for the door if these women try\nto make them jump through hoops they're\nnot talking xic players as much as they\nare not looking to throw five figures of\nmoney away on an unsatisfying\ninteraction their decision has less to\ndo with their personalities and more to\ndo with the economic realities under\nwhich they are operating women if you\nmake men wait you will end up with the\nmen with time on their\nhands think about it what kind of man is\ngoing to wait around to see if a given\nwoman thinks he's good enough to sleep\nwith with I'll help you out it ain't\ngoing to be the attractive men with lots\nof options who already know their worth\nif you are fortunate enough to find\nyourself on a date with one of these\nindividuals and you are receiving the\nundivided attention of a high value man\nwho is showing you sexual interest it is\nnot the time to play hard to get you\nhave been given an opportunity that may\nnever come again you need to act fast\nand you need to give them the rich\ncreamiest milk you possibly\ncan let's look at this from another\nangle shall we why aren't there female\nnines and tens on dating apps I hear men\ncomplain all the time about the apparent\nattractiveness of the women they\nencounter on apps but my brothers in\nChrist of course you're not going to\nfind super beautiful women on dating\napps these women like the super\nsuccessful men don't date conventionally\nand they don't date conventionally for\nthe exact same reason it's far too\nexpensive imagine you're a worldclass\nbeauty you're getting DMD hundreds or\nthousands of times a day some Saudi\nPrince is inviting you out to a\nsevenstar resort in Dubai an NFL player\nwants to give you tickets to his next\ngame in a private box on the 50 yard\nline some Rising movie star wants you to\njoin him on location in Tahiti what are\nthe chances in the midst of all these\noptions and invitations that you're\ngoing to spend Saturday night having a\nbeer in a local dive bar with a random\nnobody the odds that you would do that\nare absolutely non-existent and they're\nnot existent not because you're just a\nshallow and materialistic gold digger\nbut because that beer just became\nextraordinarily expensive from the\nnobody's perspective the beer only cost\ncost 10 bucks but from your perspective\nthe world class Beauty it cost an all\nexpense paid vacation to the Burge Dubai\nto her that is a\n$50,000 beer and guess what no [ __ ]\nbeer is worth\n$50,000 when you are a world-class\nBeauty it's too expensive to date\nconventionally the same is true when you\nare a very successful man but here's the\ndifference\na decently attractive man could never\never engage a world-class Beauty dudes\njust try dming a smoke Show with two\nmillion Instagram followers you will\nnever ever get a response Beyond her\nauto reply however a decently attractive\nwoman could engage a very successful man\nshe can just slide into his DMS and make\nherself\navailable this doesn't always work\nobviously but it absolutely has a\nnonzero chance of succeeding if you find\nyourself on a date with one of these men\ndo not waste the opportunity it's kind\nof like finding yourself alone in an\nelevator with Elon Musk you have 30\nseconds to cultivate interest or you\nprobably blew it forever fortune favors\nthe prepared wait for your moment and\npounce when it appears so let's recap\nthe more successful a man is the more\nexpensive traditional dating comes these\nmen have to spend time and energy\nfinding women cultivating interest\nplanning dates covering expenses\nstimulating arousal and most significant\nof all waiting what's more all this\noccurs without any reasonable guarantee\nof a sexual encounter or even mutual\ninterest most dates are first dates this\nmeans that all other things being equal\nthe most likely outcome is the man\nhaving paid a sizable amount of money to\nfeel frustrated and disappointed Ed at\nthe end of the night in the context of\nlimited free time and emotional\nbandwidth these probabilities become\neven more unattractive most likely he\nwill eventually come to the decision\nthat he would rather use that time and\nenergy earning more money or improving\nhis Fitness or playing video games or\nliterally any other activity that\nreasonably promises a greater return on\nhis investment of time like the\nbeautiful woman he will conclude that no\nbeer is worth\n$50,000 now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this

finally\nplease fill out an inquiry form on my\nwebsite if you're interested in booking\na paid consultation the links to\neverything I just discussed is in the\ndescription below so please check them\nout all right let's get back to\nit provided we can move past our\nreactive judgment we're now well\npositioned to understand why successful\nmen use escorts not only is hiring\nescorts less expensive than dating\ntraditionally but doing so solves nearly\nevery problem that a successful man\nEncounters in the modern dating pool and\nregardless of who you are man or woman\nyoung or old gay or straight an option\nthat solves more of your problems for\nfewer resources will always be\npreferable to an option that solves few\nof your problems for\nmore apparently the average rate for an\nhour of sex with a female sex worker in\nthe United States is\n$250 citation below to put that in\nperspective that hour of sex is\ncomparable to 11 and A2 minutes of that\ncorporate lawyer's time at $1,300 an\nhour however this is just an average\nrate for sex in major cities a\nhigh-priced call girl will cost around\n$1,000 an hour now to an average guy\nthis is a lot of money most men do not\nhave $1,000 to spend on an hour of\npleasure they think this call girl is\nexpensive however to a successful man\nthis is a bargain not only is he still\ncoming out ahead in the head-to-head\ncomparison on the value of their\nrespective time he only has to work 45\nminutes to purchase 60 Minutes of her\ntime but relative to the tradition\ndating model previously discussed he may\nhave potentially saved $115,000 worth of\ntime for $1,000 worth of cash from a\ncertain perspective he's stealing from\nhimself by not using\nescorts this thinking highlights the\ndifferences between scarcity and\nabundance mentality so let me pause here\nto explain this further when I first\nmoved to San Francisco I lived in a\nshared house with a Craigslist roommate\nand we would get into some disagreements\nabout cleaning the house the woman I was\nliving with wasn't doing so well she\nwasn't thriving in life and she didn't\nhave a lot of money on the other hand my\ntest prep business was Catching Fire and\nI was using almost every hour I could\nspare to provide lessons to my students\nas a consequence I wanted to hire\nsomeone to clean the common areas of the\nhouse if cleaning the house required two\nhours a month I would rather pay someone\n200 bucks to allow me the opportunity to\nearn 500 bucks it was too expensive for\nme not to delegate as I would be\nfunctionally stealing $300 for myself to\ndo the same job less well my roommate on\nthe other hand did not have $200 to\nspend she thought she was saving $200 by\ncleaning the house herself and here's\nthe thing we were both right within our\nrespective perspectives and economic\nrealities each of us was making the\nrational choice now if you don't have\n200 bucks to spend you don't have 200\nbucks to spend but the issue is that\nscarcity mentality can keep people\ntrapped in scarcity longer than they\nneed to be at a certain point an\nindividual's time always becomes more\nvaluable than his or her money this is\ntrue of everyone though it will occur at\ndifferent rates depending on the value\nof the individual's time in the\ncommercial Marketplace people with\nscarcity mentality count the dollars\nthey spend and track the dollars they\nsave by doing it themselves on the other\nhand people with abundance mentality\ncount the hours they spend and track the\ndollars they save by delegating to\nothers and this of course is a virtuous\ncycle the more you delegate the more you\nfree up time to earn even more to\ndelegate even further that's how you\ntake your time back and increase your\nearning\npotential a successful man uses escorts\nis effectively delegating his time to a\nprofessional rather than doing it\nhimself and he saves a considerable\namount of resources by doing so most\nwomen do not understand how much time\nenergy and money men spend trying to get\nlaid even in their relationships if we\nliberated that time we would increase\nthe GDP by billions of dollars overnight\nFor Better or Worse getting and\nmaintaining women is one of the single\ngreatest expenses incurred by men on\nthis planet and romantic relationships\nare one of the largest resource\nredistribution schemes the world has\never seen for men it's almost always\ncheaper to be single and for women it's\nalmost always cheaper to be in a\nrelationship that said I found that most\nmen actually aren't that mythed about\npaying probably because they've never\neven considered there might be another\noption\nthey just want a fair deal the issue is\nthat deal becomes less Fair as the man\nbecomes more successful and this is less\nthe consequence of the woman's\nentitlement as some men might argue and\nmore a consequence of the man's\nsuccess so not only is hiring an escort\neven a high-priced one significantly\nless expensive to successful men than\ndating an average girl the escort solves\na bunch of other problems that are\nsubject to arising in Tradition dating\nthis man does not have to spend time\nswiping or approaching women and he does\nnot have to deal with the rejection and\nfrustration that inevitably attend those\nactivities he does not have to spend\nhours or days texting back and forth to\ngenerate interest he doesn't have to\nplan a date and make the woman feel\nheard and make the woman feel safe and\nmake the woman feel aroused he doesn't\nhave to wait days or weeks for the woman\nin question to make herself available\nand is absolutely guaranteed of a sexual\nencounter if he so desires one what's\nmore and this might rub folks the wrong\nway but that high-priced escort is\nprobably more attractive than the\naverage woman on a dating app at the\nvery least a man who hires an escort\ngenerally selects the one who is most\nattractive to him from among the\navailable options this is a very\nuncommon experience for men the fact of\nthe matter is that it's much easier for\nwomen to get what they want want at\nleast sexually why because most men will\nhave sex with most women but most women\nwill not have sex with most men this\nmeans that women can kind of get what\nthey want sexually while men typically\nhave to settle for what wants\nthem but that Dynamic is reversed when a\nman uses a prostitute in this situation\nthe man ends up with the best he can get\nas opposed to the best who will have him\nthe experience is also delivered to him\nat his con venience when he wants it\nwhere he wants it how he wants it and he\ncan terminate the relationship at his\npleasure at any time with no\nconsequences in almost every possible\nway when a successful man hires an\nescort he gets more of what he wants and\nless of what he doesn't far more cheaply\nrelative to dating on the open market\nsuccessful men don't date for the same\nreason very attractive women don't they\nboth have to pay much more for much less\njust keeping it real with you what do\nyou think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow as always I appreciate your\nsupport and thank you for listening"
