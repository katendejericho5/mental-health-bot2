    "transcript": "I'm here to give you three actionable\nthings that you can start doing today in\norder to accelerate your progress in the\ndirection of self-love here we go first\nand foremost make a commitment starting\nnow not to speak to yourself in a way\nthat you wouldn't speak to a close\nfriend though I've been a therapist for\nover 10 years I am still shocked from\ntime to time at just how negatively some\npeople speak to themselves every mistake\nthey make is painfully Amplified and\neverything they do well is grossly\nminimized by this horribly negative\ncritical inner voice so the first step\nto loving yourself is to stop speaking\nto yourself in that way this is so\nimportant because if you denigrate\nsomeone over time it's so much easier to\nhate them this is like an initial step\nin all totalitarian regimes towards\npograms and genocide to justify the\nviolence against a hated group you must\nfirst denigrate them"
