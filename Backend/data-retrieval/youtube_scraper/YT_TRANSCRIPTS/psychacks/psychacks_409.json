    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is it gets\nworse before it gets better so I give\nconsultations to guys from all walks of\nlife and from all over the world and in\nthese consultations we discuss many\nthings however one of the most common\nreasons why guys reach out to me is\nbecause they are wanting to change a\ndysfunctional dynamic in their primary\nrelationship or marriage makes sense now\nif if you're one of these guys I've got\nboth good news and bad news for you the\ngood news is that it's possible you can\nchange even long-standing Dynamics in\nyour\nrelationship however the bad news is\nthat it's very hard to do it's always\neasier to do the right thing from the\nbeginning than to do the wrong thing for\nyears or decades and then try to fix the\nproblem so it's going to be tough what's\nmore it's going to take some time it may\nnot get all the way to where you want it\nto be and it will always always get\nworse before it gets better so a lot of\nbad news but as long as you're not in a\nhurry and you brace yourself for the\nperiod of discomfort that comes after\nyou begin to initiate a change it's\npossible to alter even deeply ingrained\nBehavior patterns now today I want to\ntalk about this last caveat that no\nmatter who or what you're dealing with\nit's going to get worse before it gets\nbetter this phenomenon is due to\nsomething called an Extinction burst and\nthis is something that all men need to\nbe aware of the extinction burst is why\nyou absolutely should not go around\nmaking changes to a long-standing\ndynamic casually or half-cocked changing\nthese Dynamics is something you need to\ndo very strategically very intentionally\nand with a definite plan of action this\nis because among other things Extinction\nbursts can be very very difficult to\ndeal with this is a term from behavioral\npsychology which to my mind has\nundeservedly fallen out of favor in\nrecent years to understand what an\nExtinction burst is let's imagine that\nwe're behavioral scientists running an\nexperiment in a lab in this experiment\nwe'll place a rat in a cage with a\nlittle lever the goal of the study is to\ncultivate a lever pushing Habit in the\nrat and to do this we're going to reward\nthe rat with a food pellet every time he\npushes the lever it won't take long in\nits initial exploration of the\nenvironment the rat will probably brush\nup against the lever and unintentionally\ntrigger the food pellet however since\nfood is so reinforcing most rats will\nquickly learn that the lever is Magic\nthat pushing it down causes food to\nappear it will only take a few\nreinforcements to cultivate this\nAssociation in the rat now let's say\nthat we allow this to go on for a few\nweeks and then we decide to make a\nchange to the study the new goal of the\nexperiment is to extinguish the lever\npushing habit we previously cultivated\nin the rat and we do this by putting\nlever pushing on what we would call an\nExtinction Protocol in this case the\nprotocol is very simple we just stop\nrewarding the rat with food no matter\nwhat he does with respect to the lever\nand of course we can't inform the rat of\nthis change in writing we're just going\nto change the reinforcements and see how\nlong it takes for the rat to get the\nmessage how do you think the rat is\ngoing to\nbehave what's going to happen is that\nthe rat is going to go up to the lever\nand press it as usual and when no food\nappears he's probably going to look a\nlittle confused he'll his head in\ninterest hm that's a change and then\nthen he might push the lever again\npossibly a little harder this time and\nwhen no food appears again he might\nbegin to manifest signs of agitation\nsomething approximating fear or anger\nand then he's GNA go him on that\nlever like where is my food pellet and\nthat my friends is an Extinction burst\nit's a dramatic increase in the\nfrequency Andor intensity of a behavior\nthat occurs when habitual reinforcement\nis disrupted before the behavior goes\naway entirely there will be a period of\nintense and frequent iteration of that\nbehavior slated for extinction that's\nthings getting worse however if you can\nget through the extinction burst without\nreinforcing the target Behavior then\nthings will eventually start to get\nbetter that's because no rat is so dumb\nthat it's going to continue continue to\npush that lever indefinitely in the\nabsence of reward after all lever\npushing holds no intrinsic value for\nrats our little participant only\nmanifested that behavior because of the\nresult of that behavior change the\nresult and you change the behavior this\nis the Crux of operant conditioning in\nthe consistent absence of a reward rats\nwill learn their lesson now before I go\nany further if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom message because it's Word of Mouth\nreferrals like this that really help to\nmake the channel grow and you may also\nconsider hitting the thanks button and\ntipping me in proportion to the value\nyou feel you've derived from this\nmessage I really depend on your support\nto keep all of this going and I thank\nyou very\nmuch back to the lab now the lever\npushing Behavior might not disappear\nentirely a few days later the rat could\nsee the lever and think to himself hm I\nwonder if the magic lever is still\nbroken broken and he'll give it a push\njust to check and when no food is\nforthcoming he'll leave it alone for a\nweek and when he checks\nagain he'll leave it alone for a month\nEtc the point is that the target\nBehavior should become less and less\nfrequent as a function of time however\nsince these manifestations are much less\naggressive and intense than the\nextinction burst they're also much\neasier to handle but here's the thing if\none day months and months down the road\nwe scientists decide to change the\nreinforcement schedule again and we\ndecide that we'll go back to rewarding\nlever pushing Behavior with a food\npellet then all we really have to do is\nreward a lever push with a food pellet\nonce and that habit of lever pushing\nwill immediately return in that rat in\nfull force just as if no time had passed\nat all since that period of regular\nreinforcement this is why habits are so\nhard to break and so easy to fall back\ninto it's not fair but that's the way it\nis now there are several important\ntakeaways here the first one is the most\nobvious but it needs to be said\nregardless that is if you want to Target\na certain behavior for extinction if you\nwant a certain Behavior to go away you\nneed to stop rewarding it in the\nexperiment the scientists had to stop\ngiving the rat the food pellet in order\nto motivate him to change his lever\npushing Behavior it's not functionally\npossible to get rid of a behavior that\nyou are still\nreinforcing sounds obvious right but\nyou'd be surprised what might be less\nobvious however is the method of\nreinforcement not all reinforcement is\nas clear and explicit as a food pellet\nis and if you're in a dysfunctional\nDynamic chances are good that you have\nbeen inadvertently reinforcing the\ntarget behavior in ways that you didn't\nfully realize common types of\nreinforcement that are often\nunappreciated are\nattention\ninterest emotion\nconcession time and of course giving\npeople what they want so that's lesson\none to get a behavior to disappear you\nfirst have to stop reinforcing it lesson\nnumber two is once you stop reinforcing\nit be prepared for some nasty Behavior\nwhether explicitly or implicitly the\nother person is going to be\nlike what do you mean you're not going\nto give me what I want that's not how\nthis goes you've given me what I wanted\nevery single time I've done this for the\npast 10 years did you not hear me do I\nneed to get louder for you to understand\nstand where's my food pellet do you see\nthis is things getting worse and you\nneed to be prepared for this kind of\nreaction because if you Buckle under the\nincreased pressure of the extinction\nburst you've just made your situation 10\ntimes worse because you've started to\ntrain your partner to behave monstrously\nAndor aggressively to get what she wants\nthis goes south real fast past gentlemen\nyou have to reward the behavior that you\nwant to see more of if you reward\naggression or withholding or\nspitefulness or chaos you will only get\nmore aggression withholding spitefulness\nor\nchaos that is not good for you and it's\nnot good for your woman so as hard as it\ngets during the extinction burst no\nmatter what you do don't give in Trust\ntrust in behavioral psychology and\nunderstand that no rat is so stupid and\nspiteful that it will persist in an\nintrinsically unrewarding Behavior\nwithout reinforcement indefinitely After\nthe Storm the sun will shine again and\nfinally the third lesson is once you get\nto the other side of that Extinction\nburst to never ever ever ever reward the\nbehavior that you successfully\nextinguished again not once ever a lot\nof guys followed my advice and things\nget better a few weeks no problems a few\nmonths no problems and they think okay\nwell maybe we've turned the page and I\ncan relax my discipline here nope wrong\nincorrect you never get to reward that\nbehavior again period because it only\ntakes one reinforcement of a previously\nextinguished Behavior to bring the old\nhabit back in full force so if you're\ngonna go for it be prepared to go all\nthe way otherwise don't even bother what\ndo you think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel you may also\nconsider becoming a channel member with\nperks like the
