    "transcript": "here's another reason why talking is\noverrated how often has it happened in\nyour life that your partner has said to\nyou we need to talk and when you sat\ndown with his other person he or she\nsaid I need you to know that last week\nwhen we were having a discussion about\nmy mother I never felt so heard and\nrespected and validated in my life you\nneed to know that I'm very satisfied\nwith this relationship and I'm extremely\ncontent with the way things are going\nand I'm only concerned that I just might\nnot be able to love you any more than I\ncurrently do like that never happens\ndoes it and why is that because when\npeople say we need to talk it's because\nsomebody has a problem and they believe\nthat talking is going to resolve that\nproblem this is going to sound really\nweird coming from a therapist but that\nis often not the case only a small\nsubset of problems can really be solved\nby talking about them and in many cases\ntalking about problems becomes a problem\nin and of itself"
