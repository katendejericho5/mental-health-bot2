    "video_title": "For women, FOREPLAY isn't OPTIONAL",
    "transcript": "one of the perennial complaints you hear\nfrom women in this department is that\nmen just want to go straight to\nintercourse women love foreplay a lot of\nthem need foreplay in order to get in\nthe mood and I don't just mean physical\nstimulation though that can obviously\nhelp they want to talk and connect and\ncuddle and feel heard and feel cared for\nand then they want to build up to\npenetration with kissing and touching\nand stroking Etc I mean it can take a\nlot ofing work just to get women to the\npoint where they are receptive to sex\nand the bad news is that that's how it's\ngoing to be for a lot of them however\nthe good news is that foreplay is more\nthan just fumbling around immediately\nbefore intercourse in fact if you do it\nright a lot of foreplay occurs outside\nthe bedroom and hours before the sexual\nencounter this means that if you put in\na little effort throughout the day your\nwoman should be much more open and\nreceptive to having sex when you're\nready to have it at the end of the night"
