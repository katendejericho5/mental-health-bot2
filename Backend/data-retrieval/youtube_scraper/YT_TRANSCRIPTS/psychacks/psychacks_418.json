    "transcript": "the fact of the matter is that people\ncan move their lips and say anything\nthey can say things like I love you or\nyou're the best I've ever had or I can't\nstop thinking about you people can say\nwhatever they want and because of that\nthere's always the possibility of Doubt\nas to whether or not the words actually\nreflect their felt experience and\nobjective reality Now ladies it's also\ntrue that you will do more in the\nbedroom with men you are more attracted\nto with men you like more when your\nattraction is high you will make\nyourself more sexually available in\nevery sense of those words and you will\nwillingly break the rules that you\nrigidly enforce for others so if you put\ntwo and two together you can see that\nlearning about a woman's sexual history\nis a way for men to kind of confirm a\nwoman's words with her actions and to\ndetermine how attracted a woman actually\nis to them"
