    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nbring sex back into a relationship so I\nconsult with guys from all walks of life\nand from all over the world we talk\nabout many many issues but one of the\nmost frequent topics of discussion one\nof the main reasons why men reach out to\nme is to help resolve their sexless\nmarriages let me tell you the number of\nsexless marriages that exist in this\nworld today do not make me very\noptimistic about that institution it's\nextremely difficult to keep sex alive in\na marriage because among other things\nmarriage in its striving for safety in\nsecurity intentionally removes many of\nthe elements of passion that naturally\nKindle desire I talk about this more in\nmy episode why marriage kills sex and I\nalso provide some unconventional advice\non on how to approach a solution in\ntoday's episode I'm going to be talking\nabout how to rekindle sex in a sexless\nrelationship and this advice is\nspecifically for men It's usually the\ncase in a sexless relationship that it's\nthe man who has the desire and the woman\nwho is either rebuffing his advances or\ngiving him excuses it can happen the\nother way around but that's less common\nand that requires a different Suite of\nsolutions so this advice is for men who\nare the frustrated party in sexless\nrelationships to begin with men you have\nto understand that male and female\nsexuality are extremely different from\neach other in fact God is probably\nlaughing at us all from Beyond the\nclouds because we're about as different\nas we could possibly be in this regard\nand yet we need to find a way to work\nthat out in order to get together for\ninstance to a woman sex is like the\nfruit of a tree you have to plant the\nseed and then it grows into a sapling\nand then it leaves and then it flowers\nand then it fruits sex with a woman is\ngenerally the product of a lot of effort\nand\ncultivation on the other hand to a man\nsex is the seed it initiates everything\nelse it's the motive force that compels\nthem to erupt out of themselves and move\nout into the world sex is kind of the\nend of a process for a woman and the\nbeginning of a process for a man\nthis is because women tend to give sex\nto men that they like whereas men only\nreally feel liked when they get sex I\nmean I could go on and on about all the\nlittle ironies that exist between men\nand women's attitudes around sex the\npoint is that if you're a man in a\nsexist relationship you have to\nappreciate that you're dealing with a\ndifferent kind of animal which is female\nsexuality one of the perennial\ncomplaints you hear from women in this\ndepartment is that men just want to go\nstraight to intercourse women love\nforeplay a lot of them need foreplay in\norder to get in the mood and I don't\njust mean physical stimulation though\nthat can obviously help they want to\ntalk and connect and cuddle and feel\nheard and feel cared for and then they\nwant to build up to penetration with\nkissing and touching and stroking Etc I\nmean it can take a lot of [ __ ] work\njust to get women to the point where\nthey are receptive to sex and the bad\nnews is\nthat that's how it's going to be for a\nlot of them however the good news is\nthat foreplay is more than just fumbling\naround immediately before intercourse in\nfact if you do it right a lot of\nforeplay occurs outside the bedroom and\nhours before the sexual encounter this\nmeans that if you put in a little effort\nthroughout the day your woman should be\nmuch more open and receptive to having\nsex when you're ready to have it at the\nend of the night however just like my\ntree analogy you have to plant the seed\nwell in advance of when you want to\npluck the fruit this requires some\ndiscipline and patience in the beginning\nbut once you get in the rhythm of things\nyou can functionally eat whenever you\nwant now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you may also consider\nhitting the thanks button and tipping me\nin proportion to the value you feel\nyou've derived from this message I don't\ndo product placements or corporate\nsponsorships so I really do rely on your\nsupport to keep everything going I thank\nyou very\nmuch now to understand how this process\nworks you have to appreciate the core\nprinciple at the heart of most seduction\ntechniques namely\ntension and\nrelease first you build the tension and\nthen you offer an opportunity to release\nthe tension just like food is most\nenjoyable to eat when you're hungry sex\nis most enjoyable when it's a release of\nsexual tension without tension there is\none fewer reason for sex to happen\nbecause why would you need a release if\nyou have no tension to let go of and as\nthe guy who's trying to Kickstart his\nsexual relationship it's your job to\ncultivate this tension between you and\nyour woman now you have to begin where\nyou're at it pains me to say but some\nmen are in such a bad situation that\nthey women like Wiz and draw back\nwhenever they so much as try to touch\nthem if this is you it's going to take\nsome time but it's still possible to\nturn this ship around now one of the\nreasons while your woman draws back from\nyou is because your touch isn't really a\ntouch it's a question and the question\nis is can we have sex\nnow and it's probably a soft tentative\nquestion because you're expecting to be\nrejected which of course makes it even\neasier to reject you however what you\nhave to understand is that your woman\nprobably isn't withdrawing from your\ntouch as much as she's saying no to this\nimplied question and she's saying no to\nthe implied question because she's not\nin the mood at that exact\nmoment now I feel for you guys it is\njust a kick in the teeth when your wife\nthe one person on this entire planet\nwith whom you are morally sanctioned to\nhave sex with the person for whom you\nmade a solemn oath before God to forgo\nall others and the person who likely has\nbenefited a great deal from your\nsacrifices over the years for her\nwell-being rejects you sexually I get\nyou and I'm here to empower You by\nhelping you understand your respons\nresponsibility in this Dynamic and your\nresponsibility lies in the fact that you\nhave trained your woman to associate\nyour touch with this question this\nAssociation is your enemy it's working\nagainst you and it will continue to work\nagainst you as long as it is active to\nsolve this problem you have to\ndisassociate your touch your attention\nyour tension from this question and just\nlike in classical conditioning you do\nthis by presenting the conditioned\nstimulus without the unconditioned\nstimulus with sufficient\nrepetition this means that you're going\nto give up on sex for the time being you\nweren't getting it anyway right don't\nask not explicitly with your words not\nimplicitly with your actions and let\nyour touch just be your touch and your\nattention just be your attention for\nnow once you begin to decouple these\nthings from a bid for intercourse you\ncan then begin to cultivate tension in\nyour relationship in small ways\nthroughout the day this could look like\ncoming up behind her and giving her a\nreally tight hug and then moving on like\nnothing happened or smacking her butt\nwhen you're walking past her and just\ncontinuing on or getting in close and\nmaking direct open eye contact and\nopening your mouth a\nlittle and then breaking things off and\nmoving on with your day whatever you\nchoose to\nthe idea here is to create moments of\nphysical stimulation or emotional\ntension that are not associated with a\nbid for intimacy you're not going to\nmove forward with having sex you're just\ngoing to connect you're going to share\nthis moment of stimulation this moment\nof tension and then you're going to\nbreak it off got\nit now it can take a while to get this\nup to speed depending on how long the\nsexual dimension of your relationship\nhas L dormant however what you event\nwant is for your woman to be in a kind\nof low grade arousal at all times if\nyou've primed the engine you can take a\nride whenever you want because the\naccumulated tension has made her a\nlittle squirmy you're much less likely\nto be rebuffed you're much less likely\nto be rejected when you eventually make\nthe bid to go for full intercourse\nyou've cultivated attention and now\nthere's a necessity for it to be\nreleased understand and as the man it's\nyour responsibility to do this just like\nin the courtship stage of a relationship\nit was your responsibility to\nconfidently lead the interaction in the\ndirection of a sexual encounter like\nthere are few women who are going to\ntake the lead in that respect it is now\nyour responsibility to keep the sexual\nfire Ablaze in your committed\nrelationship and I'm not going to lie\nthis can be very difficult especially\ngiven the fact that this issue\napparently doesn't bother women nearly\nas much as it seems to bother men\nhowever if you could do it then you can\ndo it\nnow good luck out there soldiers what do\nyou think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this
