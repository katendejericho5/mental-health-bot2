    "transcript": "trying to understand other people\nthrough the lens of the individual that\nis through the lens of his or her\npersonality or INTC psychic Dynamics is\nkind of a trap it doesn't really work\nthe idea for example that if I\nunderstand my partner's Big Five\npersonality traits or their Love\nLanguages or their Myers Briggs or their\nstar signs I will then be able to\nsuccessfully navigate a relationship\nwith them and get what I want is\nfundamentally flawed For Better or Worse\na much much better predictor of behavior\nthan any of those other metrics are\nincentives if you can understand the\nincentives under which other people are\noperating then you will be able to\npredict their behavior with far greater\naccuracy than you would if you had all\nthat other personality data combined\nthis is because the vast majority of\npeople respond to specific incentives in\nexactly the same way we're most of us\nnot as unique and individual as we think\nwe are"
