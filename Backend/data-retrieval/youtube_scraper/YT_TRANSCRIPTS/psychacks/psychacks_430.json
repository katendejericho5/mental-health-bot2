    "transcript": "people are making a fundamental mistake\nwhen it comes to dating and attraction\nmost people are not conscious of this\nmistake but as soon as I bring it to\nyour attention you will likely see it in\noperation in your own life the mistake\nis that folks generally treat the people\nthey are attracted to differently from\nthe people they are not attracted to and\nwhy is this a mistake well think about\nit whatever you're doing with respect to\nthe people you are not attracted to is\nworking those are the people who are\nactually pursuing you and are trying to\nenter into a relationship with you\nwhatever you're doing there is working\nhowever there's this belief that\nwhatever you're doing wouldn't or\nshouldn't work on the hotter women or\nthe men that you really want to get\nmarried to and that's not true and this\nis because the men or women that you are\nattracted to are not different from the\nmen and the women you are not attracted\nto why because that attraction exists\nonly in your own head"
