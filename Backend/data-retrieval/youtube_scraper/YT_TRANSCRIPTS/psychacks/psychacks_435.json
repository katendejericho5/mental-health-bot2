    "transcript": "love is the humiliated self exalted in\nCasino Royale when Vesper asks Bond\nabout his armor he replies I have no\narmor left you've stripped it from me\nwhatever is left of me whatever I am is\nyours bond is naked and vulnerable and\npathetic he's humiliated himself that's\nlove and that's also why when he learns\nof Vesper betrayal he puts the armor\nback on more securely than ever and\nfunctionally says never again why love\nis defeat and that's why it's strange\nfor me to hear people saying they are\nlooking for love and expecting to find\nit in a relationship this is some\nhighlevel personal Alchemy I've got for\nyou love is the passage into a higher\nform of life through the Gateway of the\nhumiliated self if you've never\nexperienced love before you're going to\nthink that this is but this is\nthe true fact remember love is not a\nvictory march at least not in any way\nwe're used to speaking about victory"
