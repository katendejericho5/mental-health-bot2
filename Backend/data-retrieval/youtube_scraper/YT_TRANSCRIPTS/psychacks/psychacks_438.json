    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why women\npick fights so this can be an\nexasperating phenomenon for a lot of the\nmen out there especially those in\nrelationships why is it that your woman\nseems to create unnecessary difficulties\nwhy does she pick fights over small and\ninsignificant things well I'm here to\nexplain to you why that might be the\ncase the key to understanding this\nphenomen on is appreciating that emotion\nis\nreinforcing I didn't say positive\nemotion was reinforcing I said emotion\nwas reinforcing emotion of all kinds is\nreinforcing to women you see this kind\nof response in children as well for\nexample most children would rather\nexperience negative attention than no\nattention at all and this is what in\npart creates class clowns in grade\nschool or rebellious teenagers and\nAdolescence they would rather experience\na parents annoyance or judgment or anger\nor even rejection than being\nfunctionally invisible to them so\nemotion is reinforcing that is it's\nrewarding with that in mind we can also\nappreciate the truth of the converse if\nall emotion is reinforcing then it's not\nnegative emotion that is punishing it's\nthe absence of emotion that is punishing\nindeed one of the most difficult things\nfor a woman to tolerate in a\nrelationship is the absence of\nemotion the absence of emotion is\nexperienced by most women as punitive as\npunishing this is why if you ever want a\ncertain Behavior to disappear it's\nbetter to respond with a neutral\nnon-reinforcing reaction than to respond\nwith anger or frustration the more\nunemotional the response the less likely\nthe eliciting behavior will be repeated\nin the future and this is because the\nabsence of emotion is punishing and this\nis where a lot of guys get into trouble\nbecause men in part due to their\ntemperament and in part due to\nsocialization are generally not very\nemotionally expressive what's more a man\nisn't always prepared to engage with a\nwoman more or less on demand sometimes\nhe's tired sometimes he's preoccupied\nsometimes he just wants to be left alone\nin fact there seem to be some important\ngender differences in how men and women\ntend to respond to emotional stressors\nwhereas women generally prefer to talk\nthings out in order to feel better men\noften prefer to like withdraw into the\nBatcave to solve the problem men like to\ngo inside to isolate to incubate and to\nresolve the problem internally before\nemerging with a solution or at least a\nplan of action of course it would be\nvery helpful for women to understand\nthat when men are disinterested in\ninteracting with them it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that they have a\nproblem with them they just have a\nproblem it's occupying their attention\nand they don't want to cope with the\nproblem in the same way that women do\nand indeed it is probably in everyone's\nbest interests if the man and the woman\ncan gently avoid each other for a while\nwhile the man goes through his process\nunfortunately many women push harder for\nconnection at these times mostly because\nthey are treating their men the way that\nthey would like to be treated if they\nwere in the same situation and this\ntypically creates an escalating crisis\nbecause when a woman attempts to\ninteract with a man in this state she is\nmet with a relative absence of emotion\nas the man has begun to withdraw within\nhimself and this withdraw will typically\nbe experienced by the woman as punishing\nespecially if she tends to be more\nanxious or\ninsecure she might begin to worry that\nsomething is wrong and now the man has a\nnew problem on his hands that he didn't\nhave\nbefore now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth

donations\nthat help to keep the lights on I don't\ndo corporate sponsorships or product\nplacements so I really count on your\nsupport and I really appreciate it thank\nyou now when people are insecure or\nanxious they tend to seek reassurance\nthat everything is okay and one of the\nways that women can seek reassurance in\nrelationships is by picking\nfights I understand that from a\nmasculine perspective this sounds\nridiculous but there is actually some\nvalidity to this perspective namely an\nangry response reassures that you still\ncare allow me to explain back in the day\nI got into a lot of trouble when I was a\nkid sometimes when I came home after\ngetting up to no good my dad would yell\nand scream and send me to my room and\ntake away my privileges and so on and\nit's like that sucked and my dad wasn't\nmy favorite person in those moments\nhowever once or twice I came home and\ntold him what I got up to and brace\nmyself from the\nworst and nothing\nhappened he just kind of sat there quiet\nand\nexhausted and I asked him well aren't\nshe going to punish me and he just said\nno and turned\naway and let me tell you that's when I\ngot really nervous like I got scared\nthat I had crossed the line once in for\nall and I was going to be put up for\nadoption do you understand my father's\nanger wasn't nearly as distressing as\nhis lack of anger because when people\ncan no longer be bothered to get angry\nyou can be fairly certain that the\nrelationship is on its last legs so if\nyou're concerned that someone might be\npulling away or someone might be looking\nfor the door one way to potentially seek\nreassurance of their continued\ncommitment is to provoke their anger\nbecause in a way you demonstrate that\nthe other is still invested enough to\nrespond emotionally on the other hand if\nyou were to respond to these\nprovocations with boredom or\nindifference then her anxiety is likely\ngoing to go through the\nroof and this explains the otherwise\npuzzling phenomenon that when a woman is\nout of sorts picks a fight with you and\nactually succeeds in making you\nangry she feels\nbetter I know every man out there has\nexperienced this she feels better as\nsoon as your woman succeeds in making\nyou angry it's like all of her own\nanxiety and uncertainty just evaporates\nallowing her to go on her Merry way and\nsince it generally takes men longer to\nreturn to emotional Baseline than women\nthis leads to the psychotic experience\nof dealing with someone who just an hour\nago was spiteful and aggressive and who\nis now sweet and playful and acting like\nnothing happened this happens because\nyour anger reassured her which allowed\nher to move past her anxiety and\ninsecurity now do women do this\nconsciously and intentionally I'm sure\nthat some of them do however I'm also\nsure that most of them don't and that's\nbecause most people are not conscious\nand intentional so if it's true of\npeople it's going to be true of women\nthat might not make the phenomenon any\neasier to navigate though it could\npotentially help you men respond\neffectively if you believe that your\nwoman isn't acting out of any particular\nmalice though of course there are\nmalicious women in the world but it's\nbetter to start by giving her the\nbenefit of the doubt and escalating\nappropriately than to proceed in the\nopposite direction in a future episode\nI'll discuss how to never fight with a\nwoman however this is enough for today\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let
