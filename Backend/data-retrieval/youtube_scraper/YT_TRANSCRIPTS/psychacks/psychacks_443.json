    "video_title": "Why more men have MIDLIFE CRISES than women",
    "transcript": "if a guy gets to be 45 years old before\nhe is suddenly and urgently concerned\nabout living life on his own terms then\nhe is going to be out of practice being\nselfish and this is frankly why I think\nmore men have midlife crises than women\ndo For Better or For Worse women aren't\nout of practice they ask what about me\nall the time but for some men the last\ntime they allowed themselves to enact\nthat selfishness was when they were 15\nyears old and that's why when a\n45-year-old man who hasn't asked what\nabout me for 30 years suddenly starts\ntrying to be selfish it's going to look\nlike a 15-year-old version of\nselfishness that might be as far as he\ngot before he was forced to become\nresponsible and that's why midlife\ncrisis tend to look like Teenage\nfantasies fast cars and hot women these\nmen stopped cultivating their fantasy 30\nyears ago it hasn't matured in 30 years\nso they revert back to that level of\nfunctioning"
