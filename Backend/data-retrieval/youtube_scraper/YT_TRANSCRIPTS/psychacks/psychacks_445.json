    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why men\nhave midlife crises so a midlife crisis\nis generally something that occurs in\nthe late 30s to mid-40s the archetypal\ncrisis is a man who suddenly divorces\nhis wife leaves his family buys a sports\ncar dates much younger women and\notherwise abandons his responsibilities\nin favor of an increasingly hedonistic\nlifestyle well I believe that women can\nalso have midlife crises they tend to\nlook different but they're generally not\nas common and I think the reason for\nthat is the factors that tend to produce\nthese crises are as we'll see more\nprevalent among men than they are among\nwomen that said all men obviously do not\nhave midlife crises so what typically\ncauses this phenomenon when it does\nappear midlife crises occur for two\nprimary reasons first of all they tend\nto impact men who have been pro-social\nDuty conscious and responsibility\noriented for most if not all of their\nadult\nlives potentially ever since they were\nteenagers these are men who were making\ntheir parents happy then they were doing\nwhat their teachers wanted then they\nwere hardworking long-suffering\nemployees and finally they were the\noften thankless Servants of their wife\nand\nchildren as long as they've been\nconscious they've been measuring\nthemselves by other people's yard sticks\nbehaving as they should often at Great\npersonal expense to be fair they were\noften socially rewarded for their\nsacrifices however what they gained\nmight have actually paled in comparison\nto what they lost in the bargain now\nwhat generally happens around 40 at\nleast in the modern civilized world is\nthat people get their first real taste\nof mortality everyone knows they're\ngoing to die but most of the time this\nis more of an impersonal fact than a\nfelt understanding and it's around this\ntime that a parent for the first time\nFalls seriously ill or passes away or\nperhaps a person experiences their own\nfirst significant Health scare and it\ncan happen that nothing at that point is\nstanding between that person and death\nlike death used to be something very far\naway parents stood in the way\ngrandparents stood in the way however a\nperson in middle age might find himself\nnext on The Chopping Block as it were\nfor the very first time in any case\ndeath starts to transition from an\nabstract idea to a concrete reality for\na lot of folks at this time there is a\ngrowing appreciation of the fact that\nnot only are there a limited number of\nyears left there are an even more\nlimited number of good years left and\nthis is when a person potentially\nrealizes wait a minute I've spent my\nentire conscious life doing what other\npeople wanted me to do which was frankly\nmy fault and if I don't do anything I'm\ngoing to spend the rest of my conscious\nlife doing the exact same thing I I've\njust been doing what was expected of me\nthis whole\ntime what about me like my life is also\nfor me I want certain things I want to\nlive the way that I want to live there\nare experiences that I want to have\nbefore I go Etc and this selfishness\nwhich has been suppressed for so long\njust explodes onto the scene and this\nisn't necessarily a bad thing it is the\nprivilege and responsibility of every\nhuman being to live their own lives\nwhich if they also want to to live among\nother human beings doing the exact same\nthing requires a kind of creative\nselfishness like a selfishness that can\nbe creatively adapted to exist among\nothers and without that element of\nselfishness people don't live life life\nlives them so we kind of want people to\nask what about me that's a fundamentally\nhealthy and rational question but here's\nthe thing if a guy gets to be 45 years\nold before he is suddenly and urgently\nconcerned about living life on his own\nterms then he is going to be out of\npractice being selfish and this is\nfrankly why I think more men have\nmidlife crises than women do for better\nfor worse women aren't out of practice\nthey ask what about me all the time but\nfor some men the last time they allowed\nthemselves to enact that selfishness was\nwhen they were 15 years old and that's\nwhy when a 45-year-old man who hasn't\nasked what about me for 30 years\nsuddenly starts trying to be selfish\nit's going to look like a 15-year-old\nversion of selfishness that might be as\nfar as he got before he was forced to\nbecome responsible and that's why\nmidlife crises tend to look like Teenage\nfantasies fast cars and hot women these\nmen stopped cultivating their fantasy 30\nyears ago it hasn't matured in 30 years\nso they revert back to that level of\nfunctioning now before I go any further\nif you're liking what you're hearing\nplease consider sending this video to\nsomeone who might benefit from its\nmessage because it's Word of Mouth\nreferrals like this that really helped\nto make the channel grow you can also\nhit the thanks button and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nreceived from this message I don't do\ncorporate sponsorships or product\nplacements so this is how I keep the\nchannel going thank you very much for\nyour\nsupport now you might respond but Orion\nisn't it bad to be selfish\nno no it's not because selfishness is\nultimately connected to the survival and\nflourishing of the individual organism\ntrying to remove this inborn\ncharacteristic of human nature could\nvery well create more problems than it\nsolves can selfishness be taken too far\nabsolutely but when I look around at\nHumanity I actually don't see that to be\nthe issue if anything I don't think\npeople are selfish enough about their\nown happiness and well-being they\ncertainly don't act that way they're not\nthey're not flourishing they're not\nthey're not demanding the best of\nthemselves okay in any case I don't\nthink that selfishness can be completely\neradicated and if it's repressed for 30\nyears then it's going to most likely\nerupt in forceful ways and at\ninopportune moments some selfishness\nalong the way probably serves the\nfunction of a release valve preventing\nthe buildup of an unsustainable pressure\na Man Who develops cultivates his\nselfishness probably isn't going to\nexplode in an origy of adolescent\nselfishness when he is 45 so that's\nreason number one reason number two is\nthat the guys who have midlife crises\nare also generally the guys who are very\ngood at delaying\ngratification most of them have spent\nthe last two decades of their lives\ngrinding away at their careers and a\ngood portion of their success was likely\nbased on their effort and discipline and\ntheir ility to foro a present pleasure\nin favor of a future reward so it's\nactually a very useful skill to be able\nto do this men who can't delay\ngratification generally don't get very\nfar in life if you want to build\nanything of value you have to be able to\nput your present needs aside in the\nservice of some future goal so that's\ntrue and it's also true that you can't\ntake it with you my dude so another\nrealization that men have at the crisis\nof mortality that tends to occur around\nthis age is that all of their wealth all\nof their prosperity all of the good\nthings they've worked so hard for so\nlong to\ncultivate other people are enjoying them\nthey think wait a minute if I delay\ngratification\nindefinitely I'm not delaying it I'm\nforfeiting it uh who knows how much time\nI have left which is correct no one\nknows how much time they have left I\nwant a slice of my own pie but here's\nthe thing just as before this man hasn't\npracticed gratifying himself in a very\nlong time starting to do so at this age\nis going to be like bringing a starving\nperson to a buffet a starving person\ndoes not act like a normal person at a\nbuffet a starving person is likely not\ngoing to be able to control himself and\nhe's going to eat himself sick he's not\nused to eating food on the other hand a\nnormal person with a normal appetite is\nmuch less likely to do something foolish\nthey'll pce themselves properly and stop\nwhen they'll they're full and they do\nthis at least in part because they're\nnot worrying whether they're ever going\nto have the opportunity to eat again\njust like men have to practice being\nselfish they need to practice gratifying\nthemselves otherwise they either end up\nforfeiting gratification entirely and\nwhere's the fun in that or they\ndramatically increase the chances of one\nday exploding in some kind of gluttonous\norgy now this explosion could be a\nlesson that can be learned from it could\nbe a step in the direction of\nresponsible self-gratification a phase\nthat most people have to pass through\nhowever the sudden forceful nature of\nmany midlife crises is such that they\ncan be very difficult to recover from\nmany women aren't going to like support\na man through this process especially if\nspoiler alert they have been the primary\nbeneficiaries of the man's service and\ngratification delay over the years in\nany case I believe it's important for\nmen to cultivate that creative\nselfishness throughout their lives if\nthey ask what about me earlier they are\nsignificantly less likely to find\nthemselves in a lifestyle that doesn't\nwork for them 30 years down the road and\nif they practice gratifying themselves\nalong the way they probably won't need\nto make themselves sick when eventually\ngiven the opportunity to eat what do you\nthink does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far
