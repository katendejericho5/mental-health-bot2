    "transcript": "this is going to sound depressing but\nthe only way people really get what they\nwant in romantic relationships is by\nplaying games I mean they literally call\nMen's ability to get sex from women game\nand as I discussed in a recent episode\nwomen need game too and they need game\nto get a committed relationship if you\nwere to strip away all of the games all\nthat would remain would be the\nnegotiation of an explicit value\nproposition which is precisely what\nhappens in arranged marriages it would\nfeel like a business deal which is\nprobably not inaccurate most people\nespecially most women don't want their\nrelationships to feel that way they want\nthem to feel organic and emotional and\nnon-transactional people want to feel\nlike their partners are giving them what\nthey want because they want to do it not\nbecause of what they're getting in\nreturn so make the proposition too\nexplicit and it not only breaks the\nmagic spell it might also highlight a\npretty large value discrepancy between\nthe two parties again I don't play games\nis a lie and you should be very cautious\nabout moving forward with anybody who\nhas the audacity to claim that they\ndon't"
