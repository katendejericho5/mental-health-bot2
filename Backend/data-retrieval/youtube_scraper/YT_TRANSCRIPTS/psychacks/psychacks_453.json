    "transcript": "if you're clear and explicit about the\nvalue proposition there is no need to\nplay games however if you are not clear\nand explicit about the value proposition\nor if you can't afford the listed price\nthe only way you can get what you want\nis by playing games so ladies if you're\ngoing to take the brass tax approach to\ndating I would recommend giving some\nvery serious thought to how you would\nanswer my question what would the guy\nget in return and then ask yourself if\nthat's a fair trade if not I would\nencourage you to go back to playing\ngames you'll probably have more luck\nthat way the fact of the matter is that\nanyone who says that they don't play\ngames is lying to you I don't play games\ndoesn't mean I don't play games it means\nhurry up and give me what I want see for\nyourself anyone who actually doesn't\nplay games would be thrilled to\ndemonstrate the value they could provide\nthey'd be proud to tell you the guy who\nwalks into a dealership with a suitcase\nfull of cash is proud to be carrying a\nsuitcase full of cash"
