    "transcript": "there was always something about the\npassport Bros movement that felt a\nlittle Sleazy and pathetic my\nperspective was similar to the\nprevailing attitude which was something\nlike this movement was for guys who were\ntoo low status or unattractive to beat\nout their intr seexual competition here\nthey couldn't get late in the states so\nthey basically engage in geoarbitrage to\nleverage a relative advantage that\nwouldn't exist in their home country I'm\nnot a fragile guy I'm not a loser who\ncan't get laid I'm not a guy without\noptions I don't need to travel halfway\naround the world to have satisfying\nrelationships with women but I now\nunderstand why it's in men's best\ninterest to seek out the most\nadvantageous marketplaces it's like\nregardless of whether you're a novice or\na master fisherman if you want to catch\na certain kind of fish it makes sense to\ngo where there are more of those fishes\nhigh value men who have lots of sexual\nopportunity in the west will still\ntravel to other places where they can\nget more of what they want more easily"
