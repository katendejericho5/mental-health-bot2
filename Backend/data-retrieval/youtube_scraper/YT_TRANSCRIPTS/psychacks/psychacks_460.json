    "video_title": "JAPANESE vs WESTERN women",
    "transcript": "on the whole Japanese women are slender\nand physically fit feminine and demure\nfriendly and courteous and respectful\nand appreciative not all Japanese women\nI'm sure but the vast majority of them\nas far as I could tell when I spoke with\nthem the feeling I got was that they\nfelt lucky to be interacting with me\nwhich is a total reversal of the\nattitude you generally encounter in the\nwest I've gone on a lot of dates in my\nday and the prevailing Vibes were either\na that I should feel that the woman was\nallowing me to buy her a drink or B that\nthe woman needed to make sure I could\ngive her what she wanted by conducting\nthe date like a job interview there's a\nlot of entitlement and narcissism here\nit's all about her on the other hand my\nsense is that in Japan women feel\ngrateful for the opportunity to be there\ngrateful for the opportunity to be\nconsidered as a potential partner it was\nextremely refreshing to say the least"
