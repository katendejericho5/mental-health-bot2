    "transcript": "if you like a man if you're attracted to\nhim and you can see a potential future\nwith him you need to throw the good\nstuff at him as much as you can as fast\nas you can there are several reasons why\nthis is a good idea in the first place\nwithholding sexual opportunity doesn't\nwork with men with a lot of options as I\ndiscussed in the episode how to have a\nfulfilling sexual relationship if your\nDiner is closed your customers aren't\njust going to wait around in hunger\nthey're going to go to another\nrestaurant the only men on whom this\nstrategy Works tend not to have other\nplaces to eat and it works because they\nreason that waiting at that restaurant\nwill still get them fed faster than\nfinding another option elsewhere since\npeople want what other people want I'm\ngoing to go out in a limb and predict\nthat the man that you're targeting as\nyour best option isn't going to be one\nof these guys women desire in groups if\nyou want him other women do too so this\nstrategy isn't going to work with this\nguy"
