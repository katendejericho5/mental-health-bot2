    "video_title": "THIRD TEACHING of Kobayashi Issa's haiku",
    "transcript": "the third piece of wisdom is actually\nthe most important and it has to do with\nthe final word of the poem Oh snail\nclimb Mount Fuji but slowly slowly the\nsecond slowly seems kind of redundant\ndoesn't it now what you have to\nunderstand here is that the poem like\nmany Haiku is actually an allegory in a\nliteral sense Mount Fuji is the highest\npoint in Japan but in an allegorical\nsense it represents the highest goal to\nwhich a little snail which dwarfed by\nthe immensity of nature represents you\nor me could possibly Aspire there's no\nhigher point in all of Japan so if you\nactually get to the top of Mount Fuji\nthen all that's left for you to do is to\ncome down there is no higher goal so the\nidea here is to orient ourselves toward\nthe highest goal we could possibly\nconceive and to spend as long as\npossible in the attainment of that goal"
