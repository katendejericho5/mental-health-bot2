    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nget any man you want the hook all right\nso this is the second of a three-part\nseries addressed to women who are\ninterested in having the relationships\nthey want with the men they want to have\nthem with the three caveats are the same\nif you neither need nor want a man then\nthis episode is not for you this is not\nabout getting any man but about getting\nhigh value men that you actually want to\nbe in relationships with and this is not\na moral or ethical exhortation for women\nto act in certain ways but a discussion\nof effective pragmatic strategies let's\nget to it as I discussed in my first\nepisode a woman can get any man that she\nhas direct access to and the master key\nto unlock that relationship is being\nuseful this means providing value that\nis instrumental in helping the man in\nquestion achieve his goals and fulfill\nhis mission understand that the\nresponsibilities you take on in this\nregard are a privilege because they are\nwhat allow you more intimate access to\nthe man you have in your sites if you\ncan succeed in integrating yourself into\nthe day-to-day Logistics of his life it\nwill be next to impossible to extricate\nyou which is a de facto commitment just\nlike men have to earn their sexual\noptionality with women women need to\nearn their sex\ncommitment optionality with men however\nthis by itself is not enough to seal the\ndeal especially in the Modern Age\nthere's one other thing you have to do\nand this is why you need to have direct\naccess to the man in question the second\nthing that women have to do to get any\nman they want is they have to be the\nnastiest [ __ ] version of themselves\nthey can possibly be I'm not kidding a\nlot of women will do the right thing\nwith the wrong men they'll sleep with a\ncute guy but one with no real chance of\na future on a first date but when they\nmeet a man with potential they'll say\nthat they're dating intentionally and\nthey're looking for something serious\nand want to take it slow it should be\nthe other way around ladies the less\ninterested you are in a committed\nrelationship with any given man the\nlonger that person should wait for sex\nand vice versa why is that because sex\nis reinforcing it's a reward for men and\nthere's no point in acting like you\ndon't understand this because you tend\nto withdraw it as a punishment so you're\naware that sex is reinforcing you just\ntypically go about applying that\nreinforcer not in the most intelligent\nManner and I'm here to tell you that if\nyou like a man if you're attracted to\nhim and you can see a potential future\nwith him you need to throw the good\nstuff at him as much as you can as fast\nas you can there are several reasons why\nthis is a good idea in the first place\nwithholding sexual opportunity doesn't\nwork with men with a lot of options as I\ndiscussed in the episode how to have a\nfulfilling sexual relationship if your\nDiner is closed your customers aren't\njust going to wait around in hunger\nthey're going to go to another\nrestaurant the only men on whom this\nstrategy Works tend not to have other\nplaces to eat and it works because they\nreason that waiting at that restaurant\nwill still get them fed faster than\nfinding another option elsewhere however\nsince people want what other people want\nI'm going to go out in a limb and\npredict that the man that you're\ntargeting as your best option isn't\ngoing to be one of these guys women\ndesire in groups if you want him other\nwomen do too so this strategy isn't\ngoing to work with this guy he's just\ngoing to move on to someone who's open\nfor business some of these guys may have\nthousands of options you need to get to\nthe point think of the sexual\nopportunity as your elevator pitch you\nmay only have a very small window of\ntime within which to demonstrate value\nand that window may not open again\nanytime soon in the second place unlike\nwomen men have what's called a\nrefractory period I'm sure you ladies\nhave encountered this in your dating\nlives most men are thinking about sex\nconstantly thinking leads to looking\nlooking leads to finding finding leads\nto acting the only time men aren't\nthinking about sex is immediately after\nhaving it now men have a thing for\nnovelty and variety which are as rooted\nin their sexual instincts as strength\nand symmetry are in women's so while\nthrowing sex at him isn't a guarantee he\nwon't look elsewhere it is by far your\nbest possible strategy to prevent that\nfood isn't interesting when you're full\nso you don't want the man you're\ntargeting to eat at another restaurant\nright so be sure he doesn't leave the\nhouse hungry if you can provide that at\na Cadence that matches his\nlibido then you will functionally\nacquire a monopoly over his SE life this\ngives you de facto sexual exclusivity so\nthis is how you get any man you want you\nintegrate yourself into the day-to-day\nmechanics of his life by providing\ninstrumental utility so it would be\ndifficult to get rid of you and you\ngenerously and proactively keep him\nsexually satisfied so he doesn't look\nelsewhere got it now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom its message message because it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to make the channel grow you\nmay also consider hitting the thanks\nbutton and tipping me in proportion to\nthe value you feel you've received from\nthis message it's support like that that\nhelps to keep the lights on this channel\nI don't take corporate sponsorships or\ndo product placements so this is how I\nstay independent and how I do what I\nneed to do to keep this channel going\nthank you so much for your\nsupport now it's important to appreciate\nthat I'm not advising you to just have a\nlot of sex with the man that you've\ntargeted that's good but it's not\nfoolproof the language I used was to be\nthe nastiest [ __ ] version of\nyourself as possible this technically\ndoesn't mean you even have to have\nintercourse because this is relative to\nyour previous sexual\nexperience this means that if all you've\never done with a man is whole hands then\nyou better be prepared to do the nasty\nEST [ __ ] hand holding of your\nentire life like all stroking his\nfingers and rubbing the back of his hand\nreal soft and giving it little squeezes\ndo you get it like no matter what you've\ndone you have to do more with the man\nyou really want and this is because a\nman is going to compare your sexual\nbehavior with him against your previous\nsexual history as a means of measuring\nhow attracted you are to him no man\nespecially a high value man with lots of\noptions is going to feel good about\nmoving forward with a relationship if\nyou've treated other men better in the\nsexual department and I'm using this\nword better from the perspective of men\nbecause remember it's the cat who\ndecides what milk is good they are going\nto feel like a schmuck committing to a\nwoman who has given away the same or a\nbetter sexual opportunity more freely\nmore quickly and more cheaply to someone\nelse so your current sexual behavior is\ntitrated to your previous sexual history\nthis means that if you've had sex with a\nguy on the first date before guess what\nyou're gonna have to do that with this\nguy because if the guy you want finds\nout that you made him wait you're going\nto have trouble why because regardless\nof your feelings those other guys were\nable to access the same or better sexual\nopportunity more cheaply this means that\nif the guy you want requests C certain\nsexual behaviors and you tell him that\nyou've tried them before with other men\nand you don't like doing them you're\ngoing to have trouble why because\nregardless of your preferences those\nother guys apparently got a more\nsexually open and adventurous version of\nyourself presumably without even the\ncost of commitment think about shopping\nhow would you feel about paying more for\nLess not great right this is how men see\nit so if you did certain things in\ncertain ways with guys you wanted less\nfrom you have to be prepared to do at\nleast as much and probably much more\nwith the guys you want more from men are\ngoing to be\nenthusiastic about moving forward with\nCommitment if they feel like you give\nthem more than they've given anyone else\nthat you like them more than you like\nanyone else and the way that most men\nfeel that liking is in the bedroom since\nsex is rewarding to men if the sex isn't\nBountiful and forthcoming he's going to\nfeel as though you're not interested and\nhe's probably right and why would he\ngive you what you want if you're not\ngiving him what he wants and to be\nhonest women generally understand this\nthey can be creative with their body\naccounting and they have ways of making\na man feel like he's the best she's ever\nhad every woman who's fudged her numbers\nor screamed a little louder in the\nbedroom than was warranted does so in an\nattempt to manipulate this feeling in\nmen it's that\nimportant the primary way that we men\nfeel as though you women like us more\nthan anyone else is that you're willing\nto do things with us sexually that\nyou've never done with anyone else and\nnot just willing that you like\nenthusiastically participate in them\nlike you even initiate those things that\nwill get you in so much easier than just\nlike being willing to do what the guy\nwants like be bold Drive the\nrelationship sexually and that also\nhelps you to channel it into behaviors\nthat you are more comfortable doing this\nmeans basically that you should be\nprepared to be at least as kinky and\nopen and available and daring as you've\nbeen with any other man that you've been\nwith when you're targeting a man for\ncommitment and this is related to the\nfirst key which is to make yourself so\nuseful that it would be difficult to\nreplace you this might hurt some\nfeelings but especially in this market\nsex is cheap it's easy to replace and\nit's easy for the high value men with\noptions that you're targeting for\ncommitment to get of course people have\ntheir own preferences and comfort levels\nbut the more your sexual menu includes\nthings that other women wouldn't\nordinarily\ndo the harder it will be to replace you\nin the bedroom just like women want a\nbad boy who is good just to them men\nwant a good girl who is just bad for\nthem when you're going for the the kill\nyou need to be your baddest most\ngenerous most willing and most\nadventurous sexual selves okay and this\nis because your sexual behavior is not\nonly being compared with your own sexual\nhistory it's also being compared with\nhis sexual history Chris Rock once said\nthat a woman cannot go backwards in\nlifestyle and a man can't go backwards\nsexually that's right once you date a\nman with a car you're not going to move\nforward with the guy with a bus pass\nright by the same token once a guy has\ngotten used to certain sexual behaviors\nand frequencies and attitudes he's not\ngoing to move forward with a woman who\ndoesn't offer him that optionality so\nnot only do you have to do things that\nyou've never done with any other man you\nhave to do things that he's never done\nwith any other woman and that's how you\nbecome like invaluable and irreplaceable\nto that guy the advice that Patrice\nO'Neal gave women which was good advice\nwas to think of the nastiest dirtiest\nthing they could possibly do in the\nbedroom and to do\nthat how you beat out your competition\nfor the high value man you've targeted\nwell consider an auction house lots of\npeople are competing to buy the same one\nlot who wins the one who pays the most\nthe willingness to do what no one else\nis doing is the cost of winning by the\nsame token this is how you outcompete\nall the other women who are vying for\nthe same man you do what no one else is\nwilling to do because that is the cost\nof winning of course you don't have to\nbut sellers also don't have to transact\nat lower price points do they and as\nbefore this is another way in which\nwomen's Pride tends to trip them up they\nbelieve they shouldn't have to do these\nthings in order to secure the commitment\nthat they want but that's tent amount to\nbelieving that they shouldn't have to\nbid more than anyone else in order to\nwin the lot they want I guarantee you\nthe sellers do not share this\nbelief being useful is how you draw\ncloser to a man but providing this\nsexual fulfillment is how you seal the\ndeal you do these two things you can get\na celebrity a CEO a millionaire an\nathlete really any man that you could\npossibly want basically you take on\nresponsibilities so that you secure more\nregular consistent access to the man and\nthen you bombard him with wild frequent\nbrain melting sex so that he has no\ninterest or hope of finding something\nbetter elsewhere men are not complicated\ndo these two things and you can have any\nman that you have access to the only\nthing standing in the way is\nyou what do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider
