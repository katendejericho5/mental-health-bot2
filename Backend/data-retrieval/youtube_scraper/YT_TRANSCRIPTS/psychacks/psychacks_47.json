    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why\nsuccessful men use escorts this is the\nfirst part in a three-part series on\nthis subject so you'll need to be\npatient to hear the whole story I'm\ngoing to begin this talk by explicitly\nstating this is not an endorsement for\nprostitution personally I have never\nhired an escort or a prostitute in my\nlife and to be honest when I was younger\nI used to be very judgmental with\nrespect to the men who did in so many\nwords I thought such men must be losers\nwho for whatever reason couldn't\notherwise get access to women unless\nthey paid for it and while I'm sure\nthere are some unattractive or even some\nrevolting men who use prostitutes for\nthis reason I actually don't believe\nthey constitute the majority of an\nescort's\nclients in fact I've since radically\nchanged my opinion of these men\nin part due to numerous conversations\nI've had with men who have used escorts\nand in part due to my own experiences in\nthe sexual Marketplace as I've become\nmore\nsuccessful though I can't say that I\nendorse the use of escorts I can\ncertainly understand it and this talk is\nspecifically addressed to women to help\nthem comprehend the types of problems\nunique to highly successful men who are\npresumably the kind of men they would\nmost like to Target for a long-term\nrelationship by understanding how the\neconomics of dating change as a function\nof success women can better position\nthemselves to secure the type of men\nwith whom they most want to meet and\ndate provided they like me can move past\nthe reflexive judgment they may carry\nwith respect to the topic under\nconsideration let's get to\nit the fact of the matter is regardless\nof whether you're a man or a woman the\nhigher your normalized sexual\nMarketplace value the more traditional\ndating becomes increasingly\nexpensive in fact the most attractive\nwomen and the most successful men often\nend up pricing themselves out of the\ndating Market this is why for example\nit's probably best for a woman to be\nlike an 8.5 if you're an 8.5 you're\ndefinitely attractive enough to get\nplenty of attention and prefer\ntreatment however because you're not\nlike a world class Beauty you actually\navoid a lot of the downsides and\nliabilities associated with being\nfabulously attractive these are problems\nthat less attractive women don't even\nknow exist and never have to deal with\nthey might roll their eyes at this Suite\nof problems and say oh poor baby can't\nhandle being beautiful I wish I had her\nproblems but frankly that's really an\nEnvy reaction the problems of really\nbeautiful women are real problems\nthey're not problems of survival but if\nwe're honest neither are the problems\nthat their haters are contending with\nbeautiful women receive little to no\nsympathy for their difficulties not\nbecause their difficulties aren't real\nbut because there are so few other\npeople who have experienced them the\nsame thing holds true for men The Sweet\nSpot for being a man is probably earning\nHigh six low seven figures a year that\nis more than enough to provide a comfort\na and enjoyable lifestyle for yourself\nand your family anything more than that\nand Men start to deal with a suite of\nproblems that less successful men don't\neven know exist and never have to deal\nwith and if anyone Garners more unearned\nhatred than the beautiful it's the\nwealthy people scoff at the champagne\nproblems of the rich but the problems of\nreally successful men are real problems\nand these men experience even less\nsympathy for their difficulties than\nwomen do not because their difficulties\naren't real but because there are so few\nother people who have experienced\nthem now you might think that being a\nhighly successful man would be a\nwonderful liability in the sexual\nMarketplace and you would be correct\nafter all if a man has wealth and status\nand fame he typically enjoys very good\noptionality with women so why would a\nman like this use escorts it isn't as\nthough there are a there is a dir of\nwomen who would be interested in dating\nhim is it really true that all these men\nare just immature narcissists who\nDelight in the objectification of women\nor might there be another explanation\nfor this not uncommon Behavior among\nthis particular\ndemographic but before I answer these\nquestions if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom its message because its Word of\nMouth referrals like this that really\nhelped to make the channel grow\nyou can also hit the thanks button and\ntip me in proportion to the value you\nfeel you've derived from this episode\nI'm proud to announce that my book the\nvalue of others is now available for\npre-sale on Amazon it'll be released in\njust a few days so take action now to\nget your hands on it I'm also writing\noriginal content for my free Weekly\nNewsletter if you'd like to sign up you\ncan do so on my website finally please\nfill out an inquiry form on my website\nif you're interested in booking a paid\nconsultation the links to everything I\njust talked about are in the description\nbelow so check them out all right let's\nget back to\nit the reason why so many of these top\ntier men use prostitutes is because it\nbecomes prohibitively expensive to date\ntraditionally once you cross a certain\npoint let's examine why this might be\nthe case one of my good friends is a\ncorporate lawyer and he bills his time\nat $1,300 an hour now that may sound\nlike a lot but it's kind of the going\nrate for a partner at a top tier Law\nFirm by the same token there are folks\nin Myspace online who charge $2 to\n$3,000 an hour for a consultation and\nthen you get into the rarified realm of\nBank presidents celebrities tycoons and\nprofessional athletes who can easily\ncommand tens of thousands of dollars or\nmore for an hour of their time however\nto make this talk more accessible let's\njust use the lawyer rate as the standard\nof measurement so let's assume a man is\nmaking 1,300 bucks an hour like my\nfriend in the traditional dating\npipeline what would be expected of him\nwell first he'd have to spend some time\nmaking something happen maybe he has to\ngo out to a bar on a Saturday night and\nRIS up a girl and this is hardly a sure\nthing even at the local meat market so\nhe'll have to have the energy and the\nemotional resilience to deal with the\nrejection that inevitably stands between\nhim and an actual Prospect or or he'll\nhave to spend time creating a dating\nprofile on an app that won't land him in\nthe invisible 90% functionally ignored\nby all women and swiping on hundreds of\naccounts in order to get some matches\neither way once he succeeds in getting a\nnumber he'll need to spend more time\nplaying the text game in order to help\nthe woman feel sufficiently safe and\nsufficiently attracted which is not an\neasy balance to strike to meet up for an\nactual date of course he'll be expected\nto plan the date which will almost\ncertainly occur at some neutral location\nas opposed to his house several days or\neven weeks out on the date he'll be\nexpected to cover all the expenses but\nas we'll see this is the most\ninexpensive part of dating for him the\nmeeting itself will probably last two\nmaybe three hours with potentially an\nhour of commuting to and from the\nlocation so he likely has to block off\nan entire evening and busy successful\nmen may only get one evening off a week\nif that and given all this time and\neffort and expense there is of course\nabsolutely no guarantee that the man\nwill even be attracted to the woman in\nquestion let alone succeed in securing a\nsexual encounter and irrespective of the\nmoral or ethics involved this is\nfrustrating because since men attempt to\nexchange resources for sexual\nopportunity in the sexual Marketplace\nthis is why he's\nthere so even if we ignore all the\nmonetary expenses associated with the\ndate itself which are potentially not\ninsignificant a 3-hour date bookended by\nan hour of travel at $1,300 an hour is\n$5,200 this means this guy is paying\nfive grand in terms of the cost to his\ntime to go on a date with you and this\ndoes not include any of the time and\neffort that went into securing the date\nthis may come as a shock but most women\ndo not just show up into a man's life\nwith an intention to make his life\neasier for most men it's a lot of\n[ __ ] work to get sex and\nrelationships from women you hear a lot\nabout the emotional labor that women\nperform for men but it's absolutely true\nthat men perform a great deal of\nemotional labor for women it's just that\nthe man's labor typically has to do with\ngetting laid and securing and\nmaintaining the relationship to do this\nmen often have to be Charming or funny\nor cool they have to stimulate your\nemotions and arouse your attraction they\nhave to listen to you talk about your\nday and care about the woman inside your\nbody and they have to do all this\nwithout giving the slightest impression\nthat this isn't anyway work for them or\nthat they could possibly want to do\nliterally anything else with their time\nand attention because if you get the\nimpression that they're just doing this\nbecause it works and not because they\nauthentically want to do it you won't\n[ __ ]\nthem this is not easy to do even the\nmost successful casanovas strike out\nmore often than they get on Bas women\nare extremely complex and most men do\nnot even begin to approach an\nunderstanding of how you operate in any\ncase dating you requires a lot of time\nenergy money and emotional resilience\nand if you're working 80 hours a week\nyou just might not have the bandwidth\nfor that dating just feels like another\njob but a job that you pay to\nwork I understand that women have their\nown frustrations with the dating process\nbut that's not why we're here today\nwe're looking at dating from the\nperspective of successful men in these\nepisodes we'll get back to you later so\nthat's the end of part one what do you\nthink does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow as always I appreciate your\nsupport and thank you for listening"
