    "transcript": "now the second piece of wisdom pertains\nto how the snail is going to go about\nhis task oh snail climb Mount Fuji but\nslowly of course the snail is going to\nclimb Mount Fuji slowly it's a snail so\nthe second piece of wisdom contained in\nthis poem is that you have to do things\nin the way that you can do them the poem\ndoesn't say oh snail soar to the top of\nMount Fuji or swim to the top of Mount\nFuji or leap to the top of Mount Fuji it\nsays to CL slowly because of whom it's\naddressing a snail so the first two\nthings are kind of in jux opposition to\neach other the idea is to dream big to\nAspire beyond your capacities but to\nachieve that dream within your\ncapacities the goal is beyond you but\nthe means are within you the poem is an\nacknowledging that the only way for a\nsnail to climb Mount Fuji is slowly by\nanalogy the only way that you can\nachieve your dreams is in a manner\namenable to your nature"
