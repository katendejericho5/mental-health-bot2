    "transcript": "people have different interests\npreferences and temperaments life\ndoesn't treat everyone equally what this\nmeans is that in practice when a couple\ndecides to say buy a house in New York\neven if they both want exactly the same\nthing in exactly the same amount in the\nmoment they make that decision one\nperson is actually going to like that\nhouse more than the other one person is\nactually going to like living in New\nYork more than the other one person is\nactually going to benefit more from\ntheir mutually constructed lifestyle\nthan the other so even if there are\nmutuality in those big decisions there\nisn't equality in the subjective\nexperience of the consequences of those\ndecisions in this hypothetical example\nboth parties were equal co-creators of\nthis relationship frame but that's not\nhow it's going to feel with the passage\nof time this will inevitably create an\nimbalance in the relationship which\nmeans that functionally and in practice\none person will increasingly come to\nlive in the other's frame despite the\nfact that that frame was mutually\nconstructed"
