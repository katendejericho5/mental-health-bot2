    "transcript": "guilt exists for a reason there is a\nreason why we evolved over millions of\nyears to be able to experience guilt\njust like every other emotion the\noverarching reason is that emotions when\nthey are Justified are incredibly useful\nin motivating adaptive Behavior take\nguilt throughout most of human history\nhumans have lived in tribes and small\ncommunities breaking our commitments to\nthe community or violating the moral or\nethical standards of the tribe would be\nsubject to punishments including Exile\nwhich was functionally a death sentence\neven in the Modern Age it would be very\nvery difficult for individuals to\nsurvive on their own in the wilderness\nso guilt is both a warning that those\ncommitments or standards may have been\nviolated and a powerful impetus in\nmotivating adaptive Behavior which in\nthis case would look like expressing\nremorse and making amends"
