    "transcript": "now once an emotion is present calling\nit illogical or irrational is useless it\nhas already manifested itself so this is\njust a kind of name calling that refuses\nto accept reality and all feelings are\nvalid regardless of the emotion anxious\nor angry or jealous or proud that\nemotion exists and your experience of\nthat emotion existing inside of you is\nvalid but here's the thing not all\nemotions are Justified valid and\nJustified are two different things\nemotions are valid but the thinking on\nwhich those emotions are based might not\nbe entirely aligned with reality in fact\nbig emotional swings are generally a\nsign that one's thinking is not well\naligned with reality as reality doesn't\ntend to change significantly from one\nmoment to the next it more or less\ncontinues on as it always has so the\nmore a person's thinking is in line with\nreality the fewer egocentric emotions\ntend to flues which is generally\nexperienced as peace"
