    "transcript": "the first step is for men to seriously\nconsider how they want to live their\nlives it's not for me to tell people how\nto live each person has to figure out\nthat for himself or herself and once the\nman has figured out what he wants once\nhe has built his resources and\nextrapolated his lifestyle he can then\nflip the script and make an offer to a\nwoman and just to be clear this is not a\nsimple role reversal this is because in\norder to compensate for the SA\nsacrifices she might make to enter into\nhis frame the man typically provides\nprovision protection and a better\nlifestyle than the woman could hope to\nprovide for herself these compensations\nare what typically differentiate women's\noffers from Men's women's offers are\ngenerally come into my world and take\ncare of me this is why women's offers\ngenerally suck on the other hand men's\noffers are typically come into my world\nand I will take care of you"
