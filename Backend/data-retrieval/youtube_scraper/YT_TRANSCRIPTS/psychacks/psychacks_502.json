    "transcript": "in the last 10 years the number of\nsexual partners that the average man has\nhad has remained the same however over\nthat time according to the General\nSocial Survey the number of men under 30\nwho had no sex in the past year has\ntripled from 10% to nearly 30% this\nmeans that one in three one in three\nyoung men have absolutely zero presence\nin the sexual Marketplace on the other\nhand only roughly one in Six Women in\nthat age group reported the same thing\nthis creates a correspondence of roughly\nfive women for every four men and that\nassumes an even distribution across the\nremaining participants which is\nabsolutely not the case the top\nperforming men are not only having more\nsex with more women they're having a lot\nmore sex with a lot more women so what\ndoes this mean well if you put two and\ntwo together it means that Society is\nbecoming increasingly polygamous"
