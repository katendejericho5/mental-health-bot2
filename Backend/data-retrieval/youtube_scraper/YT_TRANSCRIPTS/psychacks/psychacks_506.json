    "transcript": "so in the 1990s some well-meaning\npsychiatrists from the West came to Hong\nKong on a mission they had seen how\ndangerous and terrible anerexia could be\nand they wanted to spread awareness of\nthis issue so that it might be\nproactively prevented or at least\ntreated appropriately and what these\nfolks would say is something like\nanorexia is a rare but dangerous\ncondition it generally affects young\npeople especially young educated upper\nclass women perhaps you've heard about\nit because celebrity X recently\nconfessed that she struggled with it in\nher past in any case this isn't\nsomething to be judged it's something to\nbe understood and cared for and we're\nhere to offer you the tools to do just\nthat sounds reasonable enough right and\nwell-meaning newspapers and media\nOutlets did their part to spread the\ncampaign of awareness far and wide what\na good deed now what do you think\nhappened according to a newspaper at the\ntime anorexia which was previously\nnon-existent in Hong Kong saw a 25 200%\nincrease in the exact population the\npsychiatrist indicated in just a few\nshort years"
