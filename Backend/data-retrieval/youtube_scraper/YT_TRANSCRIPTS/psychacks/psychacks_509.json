    "transcript": "in order to illustrate how women punish\nthe men they like let's say you have two\nmen and one guy you could kind of take\nher Le decent he's okay to have some fun\nwith every once in a while but you're\nnot that emotionally invested and the\nother guy you really like he's handsome\ncharming makes you laugh treats you well\nand seems to have good potential and the\nmore emotionally invested you become\nwhich of these two men are you going to\nbe annoyed at if he doesn't text you\nback right away which of these two men\nare you going to get jealous of if he\nspends time with other women which of\nthese two men are you going to pester if\nhe's not showing sufficient enthusiasm\nand doing what you want you get what I'm\nsaying the second guy whoever he is\napparently has been able to successfully\nattract you and engage your emotion and\nas a consequence of that he increasingly\nbecomes the target of your negative\nemotions if this guy doesn't feel like\nhe's getting the same slack and\npermissiveness that you would give to\nthe guy you don't give a about he's\nnot going to stick around if he has any\ndecent optionality"
