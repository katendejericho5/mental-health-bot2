    "video_title": "Why it's HARD for women to APOLOGIZE",
    "transcript": "the reason why it is so hard for women\nto apologize is that there seems to be a\ndifference in what men and women\nconsider to be the problem from a man's\nperspective the problem is some behavior\nfor which he believes the woman to be at\nfault and as a consequence of that\nbehavior he is now angry and upset the\nbehavior is the problem and the\nemotional response is the consequence\nand in his mind the solution to this\nproblem is acknowledgment of fault and\nbehavioral change and I don't think\nthat's how a lot of women see it from a\nwoman's perspective the problem is not\nthe identified Behavior the problem is\nthat the man is angry and upset there's\nactually some validity to this\nperspective in a court of law a breach\nof contract by itself is generally not\nactionable you have to also prove that\nsome harm resulted as a consequence of\nthe breach no harm no foul so it's the\nharm the anger and upset that is the\nfoul from this perspective and in her\nmind the solution to this problem is\nchanging the way he feels"
