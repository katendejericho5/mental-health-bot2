    "transcript": "now in the beginning I would pray for\nspecific things to happen like may this\nperson's cancer go away or may this\nperson's heartbreak be resolved or may\nthis person's business be successful Etc\nit's like I saw how people were\nstruggling and I wanted to remove what\nseemed to be the external causes of that\nsuffering understandable right wouldn't\nthe world contain less suffering without\nthat disease or that pain or that\ndifficulty and I did that for a long\ntime however you really only have to\nthink about this for about 30 seconds\nbefore realizing how silly it is praying\nlike this is treating God like Santa\nClaus it's like sending your wish list\nto the North Pole and waiting for\nChristmas morning now there's nothing\nwrong with asking for good things it's\ncertainly better than the alternative\nbut the idea that suffering is going to\nbe removed from this planet miraculously\nby some Supernatural Force providing the\noutcome I wish for in my own private\nConsciousness is absurd and immature\nprayer doesn't work like that and it\ndoesn't work like that because that's\nnot how suffering works"
