    "transcript": "women seem to find it very hard to\napologize for bad behavior and this is\ntoo bad for two reasons in the first\nplace apologizing for something you did\nwrong is like an interpersonal slam dunk\nalmost everybody will forgive you for\nbeing wrong not everybody will forgive\nyou for being right but almost everybody\nwill forgive you for being wrong\nespecially if it means that it makes the\nother person right and in the second\nplace apologies just seem to matter more\nto me and using words to solve a\nrelationship problem is actually a very\neasy and inexpensive solution all things\nbeing equal so ladies one of the best\nways to earn respect and raise your\nestimation in someone else's mind is to\nadmit wrongdoing when it's appropriate\nand of course to not apologize where\nthere was no wrongdoing and the other\nperson just disagrees or disapproves of\nyour actions"
