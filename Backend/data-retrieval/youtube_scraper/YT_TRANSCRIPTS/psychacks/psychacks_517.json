    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic today short talk is you have to\nteach people how to feel about you\nthis is true for all relationships and\nit's especially true with respect to\nyour interactions with women so if you\nwant to learn how to present yourself\nconfidently in Social relationships then\nthis episode is for you\nwhat you have to understand is that in\nthe beginning you are basically a blank\nslate to other people yes folks are\ngoing to take a look at your physical\nappearance and the way you dress and the\nway you carry yourself and form some\nsnap judgments with respect to the kind\nof person you might be this is going to\nhappen and that's why first impressions\nare so important however a lot of the\nthings that go into a first impression\ncan actually be proactively addressed\nprior to Any Given interaction you can\ngive a lot of thought to your dress and\nyour appearance and your carriage in\nadvance and if you do these kind of\npassively exert their influence\nthroughout the encounter so you can\nfocus on other things\nso in the beginning people don't know\nmuch more about you besides that which\nmeans that in these initial interactions\nwhat you're primarily doing no matter\nwhat you are ostensibly discussing is\nteaching people how they should feel\nabout you\nand you do this through your non-verbals\nyour tone your expression your body\nlanguage your eye contact\nEtc\nand if you're like most people you\nprobably want whomever you're speaking\nwith to come away from the interaction\nwith a positive impression of you I'm\ngoing to teach you how to do that\nthe key to teaching people how to feel\npositively about you is to imagine that\nyou are the world's greatest vacuum\ncleaner salesman\nyou're gonna have to go with me on this\none okay so let's start from the\nbeginning first you have to understand\nthat when a person walks into your shop\nthe wind didn't just blow her in man now\nnot every person who enters your shop is\ngoing to become a customer however she\nwouldn't be there at all if there wasn't\nsome degree of interest on her part so\nif you're having an interaction with\nsomeone it helps to assume interest in\nthe other party with respect to the\ninteraction\nsecond unless this person makes a b line\nstraight to one particular product\nshe doesn't yet know what she wants\nshe has a vague desire like she's\ninterested in buying something to help\nher clean up around the house but she\ndoesn't yet know what she wants\nspecifically\nshe is as of yet at least partially\nignorant of her own needs and desires\nthat's where you the world's greatest\nvacuum cleaner salesman come in you are\nthere to educate her with respect to her\nneeds and desires and to direct her\nattention to what she should consider to\nbe her best option which just so happens\nto be a product you sell in your store\nnow every great salesman knows that one\nof the secrets of his success is\nbelieving in his product 100 percent\na master salesman not only knows his\nproduct inside and out like he should be\nable to explain in loving detail all of\nthe wonderful things of which his vacuum\nis capable\nbut he also believes that his product is\nthe best vacuum cleaner available on the\nmarket in this class at this Price Point\nWest in the Mississippi or whatever\ncompartmentalization he has to perform\nin order to be able to authentically\narrive at this conclusion\nand that total belief permeates through\nthe non-verbal dimensions of his\ncommunication as he educates the\npotential customer as to how this vacuum\nis going to solve all of her dander\nproblems and make cleaning a breeze\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking this message then please consider\nsending this episode to someone who\nmight benefit from it because it's Word\nof Mouth referrals like this that really\nhelp to make the channel grow you can\nalso hit the thanks button it's in the\nlower right hand corner beneath this\nvideo and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you derived from this\nmessage I don't do product placements or\nendorsements so this is how I keep the\nlights on can't do it without you and I\nreally appreciate your support\nokay third\nthe world's greatest vacuum cleaner\nsalesman understands that most of his\neducation has little to do with the\nactual specs of his product it weighs\n6.2 pounds runs on 12 volts of\nelectricity and has a 25 foot extension\ncord\nbut with how the customer should feel\nabout the specs of his product\nremember the customer is ignorant\notherwise she would already have the\nvacuum she needed the salesman has to\neducate the customer with respect to the\nfact that 6.2 pounds is light and easy\nto handle\nand 12 volts of electricity is energy\nefficient and cost effective and a 25\nfoot extension cord is generous and\nconvenient\nhis manner will communicate that these\nare all good and desirable things for a\nvacuum to have which will help the\ncustomer understand why this happens to\nbe her best option like many things in\nlife you have to believe it to see it\nnow at this point you might be thinking\nyeah Ryan okay that's all well and good\nbut the fact of the matter is is that my\nvacuum is objectively not the best\nvacuum on the market like my vacuum\nisn't six feet tall or isn't worth a\nmillion dollars or it's just seen better\ndays how am I supposed to believe in\nthis product of mine when it's\nobjectively defective relative to other\nmodels\nexcellent question\nthe answer to this question is the\nfourth understanding of the master\nsalesman if it's not a flaw\nit's a feature\nthis might blow your mind but there's no\nsuch thing as an objective flaw the flaw\nor deficit actually lives in your\nperception and your attitude\nand the idea here is to recast your\nvacuum's perceived liabilities as Assets\nin reality\nwhy would anyone want a six foot tall\nvacuum that would be massive and\nungainly this model is Nimble and\ncompact all the power in a fraction of\nthe space\nor a million dollar vacuum I mean I\nguess if you want something flashy and\nimpractical be my guest but this model\nis Affordable precisely because all of\nits features are focused on its\nfunctionality leaving you more satisfied\nin a fraction of the time\nor finally seen better days okay don't\nbe ridiculous this here is a classic bit\nof engineering it stood the test of time\nso it's actually a safer bet\ndo you see the apparent flaw is an\nartifact of your customers ignorance and\nit's your job to gently re-educate her\nwith respect to how the feature in\nquestion is not only not a liability but\nis actually an asset to boot\nnow you might say but Orion won't the\ncustomer know that I'm full of\nand I would respond that she might but\nthat\nis the customer's business\nyou do not have to help the customer\narrive at that conclusion my friend\nyour business is to present your product\nin the best possible light and guide the\ncustomer in the process of making up her\nmind\nyou have absolutely no obligation to\nhelp her reject you\nso whatever you're insecure about\nwhatever you think is a liability with\nrespect to your product's\ncompetitiveness in the marketplace you\nneed to find a way to recast that in a\npositive light so that you can once\nagain believe in your product 100\npercent\nand that brings us to the final piece of\nadvice despite your best efforts not\neveryone is going to buy your vacuum\ncleaner that's right\nbut if your sales funnel is strong you\ncan make a killing if just one percent\nof the people who walk into your store\nactually end up buying something\nso there's really no reason to make a\nHard Sell\nhowever might some of these non-buyers\ncomplain about your product might they\ncriticize your product might they even\ninsult your salesmanship\nindeed they might\nbut here's the important thing to\nremember\nthese people aren't your customers and\nthis means that their opinion is\nfunctionally worthless\nlike there are tons of people who are\ncritical of fast food but McDonald's\ndoesn't worry about them because they\nain't buying Big Macs do you understand\ncatering to that demographic would be a\nterrible business plan for Mickey D's\nthe lesson here is to understand who\nyour customers actually are and practice\nindifference to the opinions of those\nwho are not in your client base so there\nyou have it if you can learn the lessons\nof the world's greatest vacuum cleaner\nsalesman you too can be confident and\npoised in any interaction satisfaction\nor your money back\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me
