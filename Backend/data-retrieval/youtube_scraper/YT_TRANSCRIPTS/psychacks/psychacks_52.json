    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is women are\na roll of the dice okay men this episode\nis for you as I've previously discussed\ndating is an extended hiring process in\nwhich you the man are the employer\nbecause you the man are in a position to\nextend an offer to the woman and not the\nother way around this means that dating\nis really an opportunity to\nsurreptitiously vet a woman for the\nrelationship position of your\nchoosing however For Better or For Worse\nYour Capacity to do this will be\ncompromised by the fact that you will\nlikely be attracted to the woman you are\nvetting and attraction does all kinds of\nthings to your perception the more you\nare attracted the more distorted your\nperception becomes this is why I\ngenerally recommend that men do not make\nany kind of long-term life-changing\ncommitments to a woman for at least 12\nmonths this gives the couple time to\npass through the crisis of\ndisillusionment in which the weight of\nreality shatters the projected Fantasy\non which the attraction to this point\nwas fundamentally based so there is a\n12-month minimum due diligence process\nwithin the overall hiring process that\nis courtship in which men vet women for\nlong-term relationships got it that said\neven if you do all this even if you\nfollow all this advice and you quote do\neverything right relationships\nultimately remain a roll of the dice you\nabsolutely don't know and you can't know\nwhat you're going to get in the long\nterm a woman who was great for the first\n12 months of dating might be very\ndifferent 12 years down the road in fact\nthe most likely outcome is that you both\nwill be very different your lives will\nbe very different what you prioritize\nwill be very different and what you want\nwithin those priorities will be very\ndifferent on some level it's quite\nstrange that we expect the same person\nto meet these evolving needs and wants\nand priorities even decades later but\nthat's apparently still how we operate\nas a culture the upshot is that no\nmatter how well you vet a woman no\nmatter how much due diligence you\nperform you will ultimately be rolling\nthe dice with respect to that particular\nrelationship there's no way around it so\nwhat you have to understand is that all\nrelationships with women are a form of\ngambling you can learn the rules and do\nyour research but you still have to roll\nthe dice and this means that on some\nlevel you should approach women like you\napproach gambling and the first\nunbreakable rule of gambling is that you\nnever ever ever\nunder any circumstances\never gamble with more than you can\nafford to\nlose this is the fundamental rule of\ngambling all professional gamblers have\ntheir Kitty the money they play with and\nthey have the money they need to live\nand support their Lifestyles the two\nmust remain separate and distinct when a\ngambler starts to play with the money he\nneeds to live\nis precisely the moment he crosses over\ninto a gambling addiction and that\ndoesn't lead anywhere good professional\ngamblers can continue to play precisely\nbecause they keep their Kitty separate\nfrom the money they need to live that\nway they can stay afloat even if they\nget completely cleaned out at the tables\nthis is really important to remember\nbecause whether we like it or not all\nrelationships\nend however in our culture relationships\ndon't really end\nequally many years ago a mentor of mine\nwas consoling me after a heartbreak he\nhe told me Orion a woman is like a\ntsunami when she leaves she takes\neverything with her I can't remember if\nI laughed or not because uh it might\nstill have been a little too close to\nhome but the man had a point women are\ngenerally the ones to leave they\ndisproportionately initiate breakups and\ndivorces and when they leave they can\ntake a lot with them and this means like\na responsible Gambler you can't ever\ngive them more than you can afford to\nlose now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's word of mouth or froze like\nthis that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've derived from this\nepisode I'm also proud to announce that\nmy book the value of others is now\navailable for pre-sale on Amazon I'm\nalso writing original content for my\nfree newsletter every week if you'd like\nto sign up you can do so through my\nwebsite finally please fill out an\ninquiry form on my website if you're\ninterested in having a paid consultation\nlinks to everything in the description\nbelow okay let's get back to it\nnow I don't just mean this from the\nperspective of resources though that is\ncertainly important if you're concerned\nabout your resources then just don't\nsign the marriage contract and if you\nabsolutely must for some reason then\nmake sure you get a strong negotiated\nprup before you do no\nexceptions but I also mean this from the\nperspective of your emotional investment\nit's important to protect your heart if\nyou go all in emotionally then you're\ngoing to be completely devastated when\nthat relationship ends and trust me you\ndon't have unlimited emotional resources\nit's very difficult if not functionally\nimpossible to go all in emotionally more\nthan a few times in your life so the\nfirst rule of gambling makes sense never\nplay with more than you can afford to\nlose that said some people love to Res\nresist this advice they bulk oh\nory what's the point of love if you hold\nback love is all about going all in\notherwise why even bother it's just not\nworth it and I wouldn't settle for\nanything less anyway this is the most\ncommon rebuttal I hear to this\nfundamental Rule and in my experience\nthe reason behind this rebuttal differs\ndepending on the gender of the reeba te\nallow me to explain\nnow if I hear this objection from a\nwoman that she wants all in or nothing\nwell I just sort of chuckle to myself\nbecause that's kind of like the casino\ninsisting that I raise my bet and it's\nlike no the casino would want me to\ndo that after all The House Always Wins\ndoesn't it now casinos can set like\nminimum standard bets at their tables\nhowever if a casino were to insist that\nplayers gamble with with their entire\nholding in order to play well they\nprobably wouldn't have a lot of\ncustomers and those they did receive in\nall likelihood wouldn't be very happy\ncustomers for very long this objection\nserves The house's best interests not\nits customers so just smile and move on\nhowever sometimes this objection comes\nfrom men when the objection comes from a\nman that he wants all in or nothing it's\nsomewhat more puzzling but I'll explain\nwhere it's coming from\nthese men are really in to the emotional\ncomponent of their relationships like\nI've said most people men and women most\npeople want to be the adorer in their\nrelationships because it's the adorer\nwho gets to feel the feelings and the\nbest feeling that adorers get to feel is\nthe feeling of being with the one they\nlove which when everything is going well\nis one of the best feelings in the\nentire world\nrelationships are like gambling in the\nsense that the higher the stakes the\nmore you're going to feel you can play\nit safe and just bet with nickels but\nyou probably won't feel anything one way\nor the other you might not ever lose\nyour shirt but you also won't ever\nreally get ahead so why bother playing\nThe Men Who insist on going all in don't\ndo so because they hope to win big they\nmight\ntemporarily but this is the less likely\noutcome and the house always wins in the\nend anyway they insist on going all in\nbecause they are chasing an emotional\nexperience they want to feel something\nand just like a gambling addict they\nmight not be able to feel something\nunless the stakes are very very high so\nyou should be cautious with respect to\nfollowing these people's advice to\nsummarize since women are a form of\ngambling never invest more in a woman\nmaterially or emotionally than you can\nafford to lose and understand that any\nobjections to this advice are typically\nin the service of the casino and not its\ncustomers what do you think does this\nfit with your own experience let
