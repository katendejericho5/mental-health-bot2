    "transcript": "the other day my friend Sean T Smith\ntold me that feminism has lied to women\nbecause it has told women that they can\nbe anything which is functionally true\nbut it left out that they can't be\neverything because no one can everything\nis a trade-off on some level the cost of\nbeing anything is giving up the chance\nto be everything else and women acting\nas though they have until 40 to figure\nthis particular thing out has\nsignificant Downstream consequences so\nhopefully I was able to present this\nissue in a way that women could hear it\nnon-defensively in any case I don't make\nthe news I just report it so don't shoot\nthe messenger"
