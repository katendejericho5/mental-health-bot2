    "transcript": "let's do some very basic math shall we\nlet's say that you want to have a family\nwith two kids and as we've seen 40 is a\npretty hard Line in the Sand with\nrespect to pregnancy that would mean\nthat you would kind of need to have your\nsecond child by the time you were 40\nwhich means that we need to get pregnant\nwith that second child at 39 which means\nthat you would have to have your first\none at 38 which means that you would\nhave to get pregnant with that one at 37\nwhich means you kind of have to get\nmarried at 36 which means you kind of\nhave to get proposed to at 35 which\nmeans you probably have to meet the guy\nat 33.34 at the latest if this woman\nwanted to have two kids she didn't have\nyears to figure it out she had months\nnow obviously things don't necessarily\nhave to progress the way I just\ndescribed but if they don't that time\nhas got to come out of somewhere or it\ncould mean only having one child\nEtc you can delay the decision on the\nfront end but the time has got to come\nout of somewhere and taking time out of\nthe back end can often be more\nproblematic than taking the time out of\nthe front"
