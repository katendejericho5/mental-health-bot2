    "transcript": "men will continue to sleep with women in\ntheir 30s but they won't consider them\nfor marriage and long-term Partnerships\nas frequently Every Woman seems to\nbelieve that she's the exception to this\nrule she almost certainly is not and the\nthing is that this doesn't technically\nhave to do with attractiveness yes\nphysical attractiveness tends to\ndiminish as a function of time but many\nwomen are still physically attractive in\ntheir 30s however even for these women\ntheir odds of securing a high-value man\ndecrease with each passing year through\ntheir 30s why well those attractive\nwomen often justifiably believe that\nthey're entitled to high value men and\nthese same high-value men enjoy\nincredible optionality many of them\naren't going to be interested in\nsettling down anytime soon and those who\nare are significantly more likely to\nchoose a woman who all other things\nbeing equal offers a better reproductive\nopportunity"
