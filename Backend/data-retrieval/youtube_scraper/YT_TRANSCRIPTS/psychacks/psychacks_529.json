    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is I\nhave plenty of time\nthis is an episode for the ladies so\nguys please forward this on to your\nsisters and daughters they need to hear\nthis\nso this phrase I have plenty of time is\none that I've heard from many many women\nover the course of my dating history\nhowever this isn't really the case the\ntruth is is that many women have been\nlied to or at least they haven't been\ntold the whole truth or perhaps they\nhaven't been told the whole truth in a\nway that they were able to hear and I\nhope to be able to do that today\nI dislike being the bearer of bad news\nbut if you're a woman and you haven't\nyet locked down a long-term relationship\nby the time that you are 30. you are at\na disadvantage and that disadvantage\nincreases with each passing year\nit's not a coincidence that the average\nage at first marriage in this country is\nright before the moment when the average\nman's sexual Marketplace value begins to\nexceed the average woman's sexual\nMarketplace value for the very first\ntime\nI talk about that more in my episode why\npeople get married when they do\nthe point is that the game changes\nsignificantly at 30. men will continue\nto sleep with women in their 30s but\nthey won't consider them for marriage\nand long-term Partnerships as frequently\nEvery Woman seems to believe that she's\nthe exception to this rule\nshe almost certainly is not\nand the thing is that this doesn't\ntechnically have to do with\nattractiveness\nyes physical attractiveness tends to\ndiminish as a function of time but many\nwomen are still physically attractive in\ntheir 30s however even for these women\ntheir odds of securing a high value man\ndecrease with each passing year through\ntheir 30s why well\nthose attractive women often justifiably\nbelieve that they're entitled to high\nvalue men\nand these same high-value men enjoy\nincredible optionality many of them\naren't going to be interested in\nsettling down anytime soon and those who\nare are significantly more likely to\nchoose a woman who all other things\nbeing equal offers a better reproductive\nopportunity\nif he has a choice between a beautiful\n24 year old and a beautiful 34 year old\nmost men with optionality looking to\nstart a family will choose the 24 year\nold so you might still be beautiful at\n34. but you're likely not as beautiful\nas you were at 24 and it will be harder\nand harder to compete against those 24\nyear olds for the same man's attention\njust keeping it real\nnext we need to face some unpleasant\nfacts\na lot of women have misconceptions about\nReproductive Medicine\nthey've seen celebrities have children\nat 40 and maybe they even know someone\nwho has had a child using IVF in vitro\nfertilization\nso they believe they can kind of just\nthrow some money at the issue and poof\nhave science take care of the rest and\nI'm here to tell you that this is not\nhow it works\nI've worked with many men who have\naccompanied their women through several\nunsuccessful rounds of IVF\ntheir attempts cost hundreds of\nthousands of dollars and their ultimate\nfailure to conceive was heartbreaking\nabout half ended up getting divorced as\na result\nso why is it so difficult\nwell according to the American Society\nfor Reproductive Medicine the chance of\ngetting pregnant each month at 40 is\nfour percent\nand at 40 on average\n80 percent of a woman's remaining eggs\nare genetically abnormal\nso even if you plan conscientiously and\nmake vigorous attempts during ovulation\nwomen have a less than one in 20 chance\nof conceiving at 40 each month of her\ncycle and the pregnancy is quite likely\nto experience complications of all kinds\nmany of which can result in congenital\ndefects\nthey will also tell you if you go into a\nReproductive Clinic that it is\nsignificantly easier to get pregnant\nlater using IVF if you freeze an embryo\nwhich is a fertilized egg as opposed to\na female gamete the egg itself\nit's really difficult to get pregnant at\n40 at least using your own eggs these\nare facts that many women just don't\nknow\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton in the lower right hand corner\nbeneath this video and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nderived from this message\nI don't do big product placements or\nendorsements I rely on your support to\nkeep all this going so I really\nappreciate it thank you\nnow\nI've gone out with many women in my time\nmany of them were beautiful and\nintelligent and accomplished\na while back I was chatting with this\nattractive South Asian doctor\nI think at the time she was 32 years old\nover the course of the conversation I\nasked her about her views on children\nand she told me that she wasn't really\nthinking about starting a family\nwhen I expressed my surprise she replied\nthat she wasn't worried because she had\neight years to figure it out\nand when she said that my surprise\nturned into shock\nnow I don't remember what kind of doctor\nshe was but she was obviously not a\nfertility doctor\nmy point here is that if an intelligent\nmedically trained professional woman\nthinks that at 32 years old she has\neight years to figure out marriage and\nkids\nthen just think what the average woman\nis up against\nso let's do some very basic math shall\nwe\nlet's say that you want to have a family\nwith two kids and as we've seen 40 is a\npretty hard Line in the Sand with\nrespect to pregnancy\nthat would mean that you would kind of\nneed to have your second child by the\ntime you were 40. which means that we\nneed to get pregnant with that second\nchild at 39. which means that you would\nhave to have your first one at 38 which\nmeans that you would have to get\npregnant with that one at 37. which\nmeans you kind of have to get married at\n36 which means you kind of have to get\nproposed to at 35 which means you\nprobably have to meet the guy at 33 34\nat the latest\nif this woman wanted to have two kids\nshe didn't have years to figure it out\nshe had months\nnow obviously things don't necessarily\nhave to progress the way I just\ndescribed but if they don't\nthat time has got to come out of\nsomewhere\nso what does that mean\nwell that means potentially getting\nengaged to someone you've dated less\nthan a year in my opinion not a very\ngood idea\nor that means that you're not going to\nhave a big wedding because you'll only\nhave a few months to prepare\nthat doesn't actually sound so bad you\ncould save a lot of money that way or it\nmight mean getting pregnant before\nyou're married that's a bit riskier or\nit could mean that you have Irish twins\nand conceive as soon after the birth of\nthe first child as it's physiologically\nviable to do so or it could mean only\nhaving one child\nEtc\nyou can delay the decision on the front\nend but the time has got to come out of\nsomewhere and taking time out of the\nback end can often be more problematic\nthan taking the time out of the front\nso this is the situation that a lot of\nwomen find themselves in they've been\nlied to by feminism they have incomplete\nknowledge of their own reproductive\nbiology and they don't understand how\nmen select for long-term Partners\nespecially at the highest levels\nmen choose youth not only because they\nare generally more physically attracted\nto younger women but because youth is\ntypically a marker of fertility and\nhealth\nput yourself into the shoes of a\nhandsome rich man with options\nif he has it all except a family\nHow likely is it that he is going to\nwife up a woman who's only got a couple\nyears of real fertility left and whose\nmost most of whose eggs are already\ngenetically abnormal\nlike why would he do that especially if\nhe has Alternatives this is a hard\nreality that women have to face\nthe other day my friend Sean T Smith\ntold me that feminism has lied to women\nbecause it has told women that they can\nbe anything which is functionally true\nbut it left out that they can't beat\neverything\nbecause no one can\neverything is a trade-off on some level\nthe cost of being anything is giving up\nthe chance to be everything else\nand women acting as though they have\nuntil 40 to figure this particular thing\nout has significant Downstream\nconsequences\nso hopefully I was able to present this\nissue in a way that women could hear it\nnon-defensively in any case I don't make\nthe news I just report it so don't shoot\nthe messenger\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in
