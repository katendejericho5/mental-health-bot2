    "transcript": "on this channel I started talking about\nintersexual Dynamics about a year ago\nand many of those talks have been some\nof the more popular episodes on this\nchannel that's because I see what's\ngoing on between men and women today to\nbe like the intersection of 14th and\nBroadway all those years ago it's chaos\nand Madness and people are either fuming\nin their cars or shaking their heads as\nthey walk past I look around and no\ncommentators that I've heard are\noffering solutions that I think are\nacceptable and once it became clear\nafter a while that no one was going to\ndo anything about it I thought to myself\nokay well I guess I'll do it I've been\nelected does this mean that I'm the very\nbest person for this job probably not\ncould other people do the job better\nthan I do very possibly but here's the\nthing whoever those people are as far as\nI can see they aren't doing it yet once\nthey show up they are more than welcome\nto take over and I am more than happy to\ngo on my Merry way but until that day\ny'all are kind of stuck with me"
