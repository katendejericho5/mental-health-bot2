    "transcript": "my model for how to love is the sun I'm\nnot there yet but one day I hope to be\nable to love like the sun let's unpack\nwhat that means it's impossible to\noverstate the importance of the sun it's\nnot an exaggeration to say that the sun\nis responsible for maintaining Life as\nWe Know It On This Planet if the sun\nwere to stop shining or were to\notherwise disappear life would face an\nirreversible collapse within a matter of\nhours we need the sun more than we can\npossibly acknowledge or could ever repay\nand that's why it's such a blessing that\nthe sun shines as a gift since a gift is\ngiven through the spontaneous generosity\nof The Giver without any strings\nattached there's no need to repay it the\nsun doesn't shine because it expects\nanything in return which is fantastic\nbecause how could we possibly recompense\nthe sun if we were in its debt the same\nis true of love"
