    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology the\ntopic of today's short talk is\novercoming imposter syndrome\nfeeling like an imposter is actually a\nfairly common psychological experience\nit generally affects young people which\nmakes sense Young Folks are just\nstarting out in life and initiating\ntheir careers they have limited\nexperience by definition and they can\nfind themselves in roles that have more\nimpressive titles than their competence\nMay warrant and so there is a felt\ndisjunct between the expectations of\nothers and their own capacities to\ndischarge them imposter syndrome however\nis not unique to young people it can\nafflict anyone especially when they move\ninto a position with a higher degree of\npower and responsibility today I'm going\nto be talking about the Paradox at the\nheart of imposter syndrome how to\nresolve it generally and my own\nexperience overcoming this feeling as a\nnovice therapist\nthat's right what you have to first\nunderstand is that there is a paradox at\nthe heart of this syndrome rationally it\nmakes no sense whatsoever here's why\non the one hand imposters believe that\nthey are completely incompetent and\ninept and that it's only a matter of\ntime before the more competent and\ncapable people whom they serve and work\nunder will discover the truth about\ntheir incompetence\nand on the other hand in order for the\nsyndrome to exist imposters must also\nbelieve that they are sufficiently\ncompetent and capable to fool all the\npeople whom they serve and work under\npeople that they also believe to be more\ncompetent and capable than they are into\nbelieving that they are in fact\ncompetent and capable\nthat's the Paradox at the core of\nimposter syndrome I'm incompetent at my\njob but I'm competent enough to fool\neveryone around me into thinking that\nI'm not you see it's completely\nirrational both of those things can't\nreally be true at the same time\nso how does one resolve imposter\nsyndrome\nI think the way to resolve this feeling\nis to understand it for what it really\nis namely a bid for reassurance\nwhen we enter into a new role or a new\nposition of responsibility the vast\nmajority of people reasonably want to\nknow whether they are meeting\nexpectations whether they're doing it\nright whether they're doing a good job\nthey lack an internal capacity to\nevaluate their own performance and\noftentimes in the beginning external\nfeedback isn't necessarily forthcoming\nit can take some time for example in a\ncorporate role you generally don't get\nyour first evaluation until six months\nor even a year into that position how do\nyou manage in the meantime\non some level it's entirely reasonable\nto seek out reassurance especially when\nyou haven't yet internalized the\nstandards or expectations of that\nposition\nthat generally comes with experience\nwhich you don't yet have\nso the seeking after reassurance is\nunderstandable however the liability\ninherent in reassurance seeking is that\nit tends to cultivate dependence which\nfrustrates the development of authentic\nconfidence no bueno\nthe way to navigate this is to establish\nas quickly as possible and as\nobjectively as possible these standards\nof performance talk to your supervisor\ntalk to those who may have more\nexperience with the role ask them for\nthe explicit criteria which they will\nuse to evaluate your performance or by\nwhich they measure their own performance\ntry to make these standards objective\nand behavioral as opposed to subjective\nand psychological this means that\nsomeone on the outside should be able to\ntell whether or not you're meeting that\nstandard as opposed to relying on your\nown feelings about whether or not you're\nmeeting the standard\nso far so good\nso what do you do with these standards\nonce you've got them well every time the\npain of insecurity arises within you\nwith respect to your position rather\nthan seek out reassurance externally or\nsimply suffer quietly within your own\nsubjective experience measure your\nperformance against these objective\nstandards you have established for\nyourself this should stop you from going\ntoo far off the rails by essentially\nproviding a reality check evoking these\ncriteria will with time and repetition\ninternalize these standards so that you\ncan kind of act as your own supervisor\nand this will help prevent the\ninappropriate cultivation of dependence\non external sources of reassurance which\nmay not be role appropriate after a\ncertain amount of time\nthis is the foundational skill for\novercoming this syndrome\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also tip me by\nhitting the thanks button it's just\nbelow this video that you're watching\nand tip me in proportion to the value\nyou feel you've derived from this\nmessage because it's your support that\nmakes all this possible couldn't do it\nwithout you and I really appreciate it\nthank you\nnow there are some other things to keep\nin mind that will also help to\naccelerate your process in overcoming\nthis imposter syndrome first of all it's\nuseful to appreciate the vast majority\nof people don't really know what they're\ndoing and they're in positions of power\nand authority anyway this is because the\nnumber of problems that exist greatly\nexceeds the number of competent people\ncapable of solving them Society is a\nconglomeration of imperfect people\nimperfectly helping each other\nremembering this should not only help\npeople approach others with greater\npatience and compassion but allow people\nto treat themselves with greater\npatience and compassion as well you\nshould also keep in mind that most\npeople don't have the bandwidth to\nreally look too closely at whatever\nyou're doing because they're too\npreoccupied with themselves you are at\nbest a cameo in the lives of almost\neveryone else so the pressure is kind of\noff no one is looking at you even a\nfraction as closely as you believe that\nthey might be\nand this is all important because the\ncultivation of authentic confidence\nwhich is the consistent felt experience\nof success can take some time when I\nfirst started out as a therapist it took\nme about five years to really find my\nclinical voice and my professional\nidentity and I might not have been able\nto get there any faster even if I knew\nthen what I know now these things just\ntake time and repetition and a\nwillingness to tolerate that process\nfinally\nespecially in the beginning it might be\nuseful to set your standards for\nsatisfactory performance pretty low like\nyou might have done a good enough job\nsimply by virtue of the fact that you\ndidn't make the situation any worse than\nit was before\nwhen I would bring my doubts into\nsupervision with my first clinical\nsupervisor all those years ago he would\nask whether I a killed the patient or B\nslept with the patient\nand when I responded that no I hadn't\ndone either of those things he would say\nsounds like a good enough therapy\nsession\nof course my Professional Standards for\nmyself are much higher now than they\nwere a few months into my training but\nhopefully you get the point you can\nstart low and then titrate up as you\ngain more experience and expertise this\nis appropriate it's like a scaffolded\napproach to professional competence okay\nso that's what I have to say to you\ntoday about overcoming imposter syndrome\nit's a good idea to internalize those\nstandards of performance so that you\ndon't cultivate inappropriate dependence\nand remember nobody is looking at you\nall that carefully and they're\nimperfectly doing their own jobs as well\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this
