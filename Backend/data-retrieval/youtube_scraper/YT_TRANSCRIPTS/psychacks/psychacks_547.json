    "transcript": "I'd like you to consider that pain is an\nopportunity to cultivate wisdom because\npain is essentially feedback from the\nuniverse that your mental model is not\nin line with reality it's information\nthat you're bumping up against something\nthat you're straying from the truth that\nyou don't quite understand things\nperfectly yet pain is painful by Design\nin order to attract your attention and\nthat attention should stimulate\ncuriosity why am I in pain what\ndecisions did I make that preceded this\nexperience of suffering what were the\ncognitive emotional and behavioral\nantecedents that led me to this point in\nmy life this is the opportunity to\ngenerate Insight like the practice of\nlooking at yourself closely and without\njudgment is insight and the more you\npractice Insight the more insightful you\nget and with Insight comes a host of\ngood things once you clarify the chain\nof events that led to the experience of\npain not only should that understanding\nreduce your experience of suffering now\nbut it should allow you to make better\ndecisions to avoid unnecessary suffering\nin the future"
