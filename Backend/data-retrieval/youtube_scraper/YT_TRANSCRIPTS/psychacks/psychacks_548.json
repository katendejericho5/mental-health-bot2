    "transcript": "the third principle obstruction is that\nmany people just simply try to avoid the\npain entirely this is of course\nunderstandable pain is an unpleasant or\neven an excruciating emotion the issue\nis that when people try to avoid the\npain either with drugs and alcohol or\nwith hedonic pleasure or with social\nmedia and video games or with sex and\nexcitement or with money and career all\nof these are forms of anesthesia offered\nby your culture people also avoid the\nlesson inherent in the pain and the\nthing about anesthesia is that it\ndoesn't eliminate suffering just like in\na surgery even if you're anesthetized\nyour body still suffers your body is\nstill traumatized"
