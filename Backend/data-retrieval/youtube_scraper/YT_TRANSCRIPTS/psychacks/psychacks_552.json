    "transcript": "what's the best way to deal with haters\nin general the best response to haters\nis no response this is because\nengagement whether it's Defending Your\nPosition or debating your criticism or\ntheir criticism or responding in kind is\ngenerally reinforcing it's like with\nchildren for whom negative attention is\nbetter than no attention at all and some\nchildren will act up and get into\ntrouble because they prefer that to\nbeing ignored so the best response is no\nresponse on the other hand if you are\nsomehow required to respond the second\nbest response is a non-reinforcing\nresponse this is as close to a truly\nneutral response as you can muster no\nexpression no emotion a non-reinforcing\nresponse suggests that there is nothing\nin the hater's communication that made\nenough sense to even perceive it as a\ncommunication requiring a response it's\nalmost like the hater made sounds that I\ncouldn't quite make out his words so I\ncan't really respond one way or the\nother"
