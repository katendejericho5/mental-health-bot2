    "transcript": "there's a quote from David Goggins that\nbears repeating here you will never meet\na hater doing better than you we have to\nunderstand that hater is actually\nsomething of a misnomer hating isn't so\nmuch about hate as it is about Envy Envy\ncan only exist relative to a perceived\nequal you take away that part and you\ndon't have Envy anymore you have\nadmiration but if you believe that a\nperceived equal someone who you believe\nreally shouldn't be doing all that much\nbetter than you has much more of\nsomething you want than you do\nespecially if that something is related\nto your identity you're going to feel\nEnvy Envy is more prevalent in families\nand among peers because in those circles\nyou're not only just a friend or just a\nbrother or just a spouse you're\npotentially just someone who exists\nrelative to me as Jesus said only in his\nhometown among his relatives and in his\nown house is a prophet without honor"
