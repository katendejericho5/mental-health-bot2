    "transcript": "if you wanted to win a war without any\none of your soldiers dying you would not\nbe able to do so it would be impossible\nyou'd be far too conservative and\ncautious and that pattern would be\nquickly exploited by your adversary\nVictory would just not be possible on\nthe other hand no General in good\nconscience would throw a man's life away\ncallously it's no small thing to order a\nbattalion into a skirmish with a low\nchance of survival because of the\nStrategic Advantage it affords however\nthese sacrifices are almost always\nnecessary to secure the ultimate goal\nwhich in this case is to win the war\nwhat does this have to do with women\njust like the generals men need to\napproach mating and dating through the\nlens of some overarching purpose if the\ngenerals weren't fighting for something\nthey believed in then even the smallest\nsacrifice might not be worth the price\nof Victory and there are things that you\ncan do with a woman that justify\nacceptable losses Chief among them is\nstarting a family and creating a legacy\nfor yourself and there are others that\ndepend on an individual's goals and\ninclination"
