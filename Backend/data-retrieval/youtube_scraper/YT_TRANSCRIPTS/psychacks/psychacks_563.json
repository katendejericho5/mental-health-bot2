    "transcript": "I'll say that again if it's true that\nwomen mate and date for gain then men\nmate and date for acceptable loss to the\nextent that the woman is successful in\nsecuring a relationship with a higher\nstatus man who can improve her situation\nthen that man secures the same\nrelationship at some degree of loss to\nhim in the vast majority of cases in\nterms of time energy money commitment\nand opportunity most women will consume\nmore value than they provide and of\ncourse that's why they're there because\nit's a net positive for them that said\nwhile the statement women mate and date\nfor gain sounds reasonable enough the\nstatement women consume more value than\nthey provide tends to melt some faces\neven though it's exactly the same\nstatement like it literally wouldn't be\npossible for women to mate and date for\ngain if they didn't consume more than\nthey provided"
