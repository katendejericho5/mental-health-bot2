    "transcript": "any company that is just starting out\nwill attempt to lure its potential\ninvestors and collaborators its founders\nwith a vision of the future and a\npromised slice of pie high risk but High\nreward now many folks are going to turn\ndown this offer as too risky instead\nthey're going to wait to see what\nhappens maybe the company goes to the\nmoon but maybe or probably it's going to\nfail if it fails bullet dodged and if it\nsucceeds well they could always apply\nfor a position if and when the company\ngets through with its Growing Pains but\nhere's the thing if you the potential\nemployee wait to seek a position at a\ncompany only after it's been\nsuccessfully established you're not\ngoing to get equity\nyou're gonna get a salary at best\nthis same thing holds true with\nlong-term relationships"
