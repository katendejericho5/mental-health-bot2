    "transcript": "men are raised to think that a marriage\nor a relationship should be an equal\npartnership like the 50-50 relationship\nmen were raised that way women were\nraised that way too got to both sides\nyeah and I think that when men try to\nexercise that they're trying to give\nwomen what they think that women want\nwhen they are like differential it's\nlike oh it doesn't really matter to me\nwhat do you want to do or let's let's\ndiscuss this a lot of women actually\nwant a man who is leading the\nrelationship on some level because they\nwant to be able to look up to that man\nthey'll feel safe to the extent that\nthey're confident in his competence to\ndirect the relationship not all women\nbut a lot of women and when men are\nafraid of stepping into that legitimate\nAuthority or leadership not because\nthey're necessarily men but because they\nare competent and they have experience\nand they know what they're doing they\ncan have better outcomes"
