    "transcript": "in the affluent Western World men and\nwomen don't need each other the way that\nthey used to and this is a really\ninteresting a really fascinating moment\nto be living through I'm legitimately\nreally excited to see how we\ncollectively navigate this the crisis\nand the opportunity of this moment is\nprecisely this since men and women no\nlonger have to come together because\nthey need to we're increasingly seeing\nthat men and women only come together\nbecause they want to and where there is\nneither the need nor the want there is\nnothing again this has probably never\nhappened before in recorded history it's\nan incredible development what's more to\ninitiate any form of sexual relationship\nmen and women increasingly have to cater\nto the desires as opposed to the needs\nof the other and this changes the game\nof mating and dating considerably"
