    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is men and\nwomen don't need each other anymore\nso I recently received some feedback\nfrom a viewer who told me that she got\nthe impression that in some of my videos\nI imply that women need men and she felt\nthat such an implication was\nmisogynistic\nnow when pressed she couldn't tell me\nwhat I said that gave her that\nimpression or even what episode or\nepisodes were responsible\nhowever that apparently was the vibe\nthat she got from my episodes\nnow it certainly is not my intention to\nbe misogynistic among other things my\ngoal on this channel is to tell the\ntruth about intersectional Dynamics\nwithout either enraging men or\nalienating women and frankly that's not\nan easy task I imagine I don't always\nsucceed but that is what I aspire to do\nin any case I think my response\nsurprised her because I actually agreed\nwith and expanded upon her fundamental\npremise she was right women and men\ndon't need each other anymore\nI don't mean this on the population\nlevel like Civilization would fall apart\nwith not without a lot of men and\nHumanity would go extinct without a lot\nof women\nmen need women around and women need men\naround but perhaps for the first time in\na very long time modern man doesn't need\na woman\nand modern woman doesn't need a man\nand I think this is a really important\ndriver of the unprecedented decline in\nmarriage dating and sexual relationships\nthat we're experiencing at the present\nmoment we no longer need each other at\nleast we no longer need each other the\nway that most of us did even a hundred\nyears ago throughout most of recorded\nhistory men and women came together out\nof necessity\nand that necessity was rooted in\nsurvival life was extremely hard the\nvast majority of humanity was living at\na subsistence or a poverty level and few\npeople can do that alone I mean one of\nthe ways that really poor folks get by\nlike in the favelas of Brazil where I've\nspent some time is they form really\nstrong interpersonal bonds like if you\ndon't have anything yourself you need\nother people\nand if you have a lot you need people\nless\nand I think that at least partly\nexplains why in every culture on this\nplanet over the last 100 years birth\nrate has declined as per capita GDP has\nincreased\nit's also why affluent modern folks tend\nto be much lonelier and more isolated\nthan poorer folks in less industrialized\nsocieties it makes sense actually the\nmore you have yourself the less you need\nother people and the less you have\nyourself the more you really need others\nand when people were very very poor and\nwhere in some parts of the world they\nstill are\nmen and women have come together because\nthey really needed to lean on each other\nand close to that subsistence level of\nliving where biological necessity\nbecomes more pressing men and women\ndiscover that they have complementary\nskill sets that are absolutely\nindispensable for survival\non the other hand the further folks are\nfrom a subsistence level the more\nflexible social roles can become simply\nbecause we have more room for error\nwe don't have to send the best hunters\nout for food anymore if other folks want\nto take a stab at hunting why not let\nthem even if they don't bring back as\nmuch food as frequently we're probably\nnot going to starve at least that's how\nI see things\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow and you can also hit the\nsuper thanks button it's the three\nlittle dots in the lower right hand\ncorner and tip me in proportion of the\nvalue you feel you've derived from this\nepisode\nI need your help to do all of this and I\nreally appreciate your support thank you\nin any case here we are in the affluent\nWestern World men and women don't need\neach other the way that they used to and\nthis is a really interesting a really\nfascinating moment to be living through\nI'm legitimately really excited to see\nhow we collectively navigate this the\ncrisis and the opportunity of this\nmoment is precisely this\nsince men and women no longer have to\ncome together because they need to\nwe're increasingly seeing that men and\nwomen only come together because they\nwant to\nand where there is neither the need nor\nthe want there is nothing\nagain this has probably never happened\nbefore in recorded history it's an\nincredible development especially\nbecause what we're discovering\nis that a lot of women apparently don't\nwant men and a lot of men apparently\ndon't want women\nsince we don't need each other like we\nused to a lot of men and women are\nwalking away\nwhat's more to initiate any form of\nsexual relationship men and women\nincreasingly have to cater to the\ndesires as opposed to the needs of the\nother\nand this changes the game of mating and\ndating considerably\nin the past both men and women could\nkind of lean on necessity like you might\nnot love the idea of me but there are\nonly three guys in this Village and two\nof them are old and stinky and I could\nhelp you survive the winter\nwhere else are you gonna go what else\nare you gonna do\nso I think we got to be careful about\nromanticizing the days when people got\nmarried at 17 and stayed together for 70\nyears\npersonally I'd rather not go back to\nthat time with its lack of optionality\nor recourse I like being able to choose\nan option that's right for me as opposed\nto having to settle for the only thing\navailable\nthat said this optionality is also a\ndriver in the present decline in\nrelationships with dating apps and\nsocial media many people are ensnared by\nthe illusion of infinite optionality and\nthis illusion has exacerbated the\nPrimacy of desire in the modern game of\nmating and dating even more than the\nelimination of necessity by itself ever\ncould\nwhy because if I don't need someone and\nvery desirable Partners exist somewhere\nin that infinite optionality then I have\nlittle incentive to settle for anything\nless than something very desirable\nand why shouldn't I have it all I don't\nneed to settle for less I'm young and I\nhave plenty of time anyway\nand this one is a little tricky to\nnavigate because forming an actual\nrelationship with a real human being\nalways requires some degree of settling\nlike it's never possible to get\neverything that you want but where to\ndraw the line is always an individual\nchoice\nit's important to do that though because\nif you retain the infinite potential you\nend up with nothing\nbecause that's what potential is\nnothing\nthe illusion of infinite potential makes\npeople believe that they're suffering an\nenormous loss by trading the infinite\npotential for a given actual\nby trading everything for just one thing\nin reality however people actually\nachieve an infinite gain by giving up\nthe infinite potential for a given\nactual they give up nothing for\nsomething\nin any case we're in the situation where\nmen and women are really only interested\nin getting together if they want to\nand what we're discovering is that at\nleast a sizable minority of each sex\ndoesn't seem to want what the other one\nis selling\nmy hunch is that this is going to give\nrise not only to new relationship\nArrangements but to new strategies on\nboth sides to secure desired\nrelationships for better or worse if\nthey want a relationship straight men\nand women not only will need to become\nincreasingly attuned to what the\nopposite sex wants but they will need to\nrestrict the operation of their own\ndesire to the constraints of reality as\nwell\nwhat do you think does this fit
