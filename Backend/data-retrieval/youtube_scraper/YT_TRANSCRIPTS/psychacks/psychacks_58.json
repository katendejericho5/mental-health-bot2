    "transcript": "since a date is connection plus sexual\npossibility since sexual possibility is\nmore easily actualized in a private\naccessible location and since men are\nexpected to initiate and direct the\nsexual dimension of the relationship\nthen men should plan dates in their\nimmediate vicinity failing to do so\nfunctionally eliminates the sexual\npossibility which given the fact that\nmen transact resources for sexual\nopportunity and women transact sexual\nopportunity for resources in the sexual\nMarketplace makes it more likely that\nthe woman will get more of what wants\nand the man will get less of what he\nwants from the onset and over the course\nof the relationship so you've been\nwarned gentlemen if you allow this to\noccur then it's your own damn fault"
