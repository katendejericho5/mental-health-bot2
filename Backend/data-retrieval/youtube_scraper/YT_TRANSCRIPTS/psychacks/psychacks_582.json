    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the\nbiological clock doesn't exist\nso this one's going to blow some mines\nand melt some faces but the biological\nclock at least in the sense that most\npeople understand it does not actually\nexist\nso what do most people understand by the\nterm biological clock what most people\nunderstand is that women feel a\npressured urge to reproduce that arises\nfrom their biological processes as they\nget closer and closer to the Terminus of\ntheir reproductive window\nand I'm here to tell you that that does\nnot exist\nand there are two obvious reasons why\nthat does not exist\nfirst of all while it makes sense that\nnature would endow women with a powerful\nbiological incentive to reproduce\nthis would only make sense if this\nincentive were felt most strongly when\nwomen were the most fertile and most\nlikely to carry healthy viable Offspring\nto term namely when they were young\nif nature endowed women with a strong\nbiological urge to reproduce it doesn't\nmake sense that it would arise near the\nend of their reproductive window when\nwomen have a lower overall chance of\ngetting pregnant and a higher overall\nchance of experiencing complications\nwith their pregnancies\nthat would be stupid and nature while\nmany things is not stupid so that's\nobvious reason number one\nobvious reason number two is that if the\nbiological clock as we commonly\nunderstand it actually existed we would\nsee throughout history a pretty common\npattern to childbirths throughout most\nof human history women became mothers\nfairly young in their early 20s if the\nbiological clock existed in the way that\nwe understand it we would see women\nhaving children at 22 24 26\nand then again at 36 38 and 40.\nwe would commonly see this large gap\nbetween like Offspring cohorts from the\nsame mother\nand we don't see this very often it's a\nfairly uncommon situation for a woman\nwho had multiple children in her 20s to\nhave more children in her late 30s\nso either these women did not feel a\npowerful biological urge to reproduce\nnear the end of their reproductive\nwindows or they were sufficiently\ndisciplined with respect to not acting\nupon it\nthat's obvious reason number two\nso we can now appreciate the biological\nclock as we understand it doesn't exist\nnow that said women do have a biological\nclock associated with reproduction but\nit's not on the scale of a lifetime it's\non the scale of a month\nwhat we know is that women are much more\ninterested in sex\nthat they are more likely not just to\ninitiate but initiate riskier sexual\ninteractions like the ones more likely\nto result in pregnancy when they're\novulating\nand this makes sense from a biological\nperspective this biological clock\nmotivates women to seek out sex during\nthe monthly window when they're most\nlikely to get pregnant and riskier\ndoesn't just mean sex without protection\nResearch indicates for example that\nmarried women are much more likely to\ncheat when they're ovulating especially\nwhen their committed partners are less\nattractive\nand this also makes sense from a\nbiological perspective the field calls\nthis women's mixed mating strategy in\nwhich they attempt to secure genes from\nan attractive man and resources from a\ncommitted provider again nature is many\nthings but it's not stupid\nthat's a biological clock that's a\nwoman's biology saying you need to go\nout right now and have sex and make\nbabies\nand why this would happen every month at\nPeak fertility but not across the\nlifespan makes absolutely no sense\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the super\nthanks buttons the three little dots in\nthe lower right hand corner beneath the\nvideo screen and tip me in proportion to\nthe value you feel you've derived from\nthis message\nit's your support that makes all this\nhappen I couldn't do it without you and\nI really appreciate it thank you\nnow\njust to be clear I'm not suggesting that\nwomen don't experience a pressured\nurgency to have children as they near\nthe end of their reproductive Windows\nespecially if they haven't yet had\nchildren\nI believe that that exists what I'm\nsuggesting is that it's a misnomer to\ncall this a biological clock it's\nprobably truer to call it a\npsychological clock\nin my opinion this pressured sense of\nurgency is really related to the fear of\nmissing out\nit's a psychological recognition that an\nexperience that they haven't yet had\nmight be lost to them forever\nin the game theory strategy most\nprevalent today most young women are\nkind of prioritizing the variety of life\nthey want to have every experience they\nwant to do everything and I can\nsympathize they also reasonably believe\nthat taking on the responsibilities of\nmotherhood in their 20s might prevent\nsome of these experiences like traveling\nthe world or prioritizing their\nfriendships or dating casually or\ninvesting in their careers or literally\nany of the hundreds of things they could\nbe doing that are exceedingly more\ndifficult to do if you have a young\nchild\nbut over the course of a lifetime many\nwomen come around to the fact that being\na mother and raising children is\nsomething that they would like to do or\nat least that it's something that they\nwouldn't want to miss out on\nand that is why this pressure and this\nsense of urgency comes up in childless\nwomen not in women who have had children\nin their 20s but childless women in\ntheir late 30s as they approach the\nTerminus of their reproductive window\nand this may not be do so much to a\nstrong desire to have children as to an\nanxiety about missing out on the\nopportunity of ever having them\nthat door would be closed to them\nforever\nand all other things being equal most\npeople want what they can't have more\nthan they otherwise would\nso a lot of women prioritize other\nthings in life and they assume that\nthey'll just be able to have a family\nwhen they're ready\nand then they get to their mid or late\n30s and they realize that it's actually\nmuch more difficult to attract a man for\nmarriage and kids\nnow than it would have been in their\nearly or mid-20s the game changes\nsignificantly at 30 and men are expected\nto make the same offer which typically\nbecomes more expensive as a function of\ntime\nand that's why 80 percent of women who\nultimately end up childless arrive there\nunintentionally\nin my opinion if women want to do it all\nit's a better strategy to secure\npartners and children in their 20s when\ntheir smv is high and it's biologically\nadvantageous to do so and devote the 30s\nto career and development once the kids\nare in school then the other way around\none of the reasons for this is that\nthere is not really a point at which\nwomen can stop making money or traveling\nor spending time with their friends but\nthere is absolutely a point at which\nwomen can stop having children\nso those are my two cents what do you\nthink does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel you may
