    "transcript": "the fact of the matter is that\nImprovement is destabilizing when one\nperson starts to grow in therapy starts\nto process his or her emotional baggage\nand begins taking responsibility for his\nor her own happiness this forces a shift\nin the relationship now you might say\nbut Orion that happens when one person\ngets worse doesn't it indeed it does\nhowever this is not nearly as\ndestabilizing as you might think and\nthat's because you have to understand\nthat when a change occurs within a\nsystem the most frequent response from\nthe other parts of that system is to\nreinstate the pre-change conditions that\nis most systems have a tendency toward\nhomeostasis and this is great news if\nthe change in question is negative it\nmakes it more likely that the partner\nwill bounce back from the setback but\nnot so great news if the change in\nquestion is positive as it increases the\nlikelihood that the progress will be\nundermined to preserve the status quo"
