    "transcript": "the general consensus is that\nrelationships often fail because one\npartner kind of starts to deteriorate\nmaybe this person stopped putting effort\ninto the courtship or into his or her\nappearance maybe this person hasn't\nreally Advanced his career or her\nlifestyle or has fallen into hard\nfinancial straights or maybe this person\nhas become depressed or addicted or\notherwise Comfortably Numb there are\nlots of ways this can occur but the idea\nhere is that the relationship fails when\none partner fails or refuses to recover\nfrom some kind of setback and that can\ncertainly be the case however in my\nclinical experience that's not what I\nusually see there's this old joke it's\nnot really a joke because it's not\nreally funny but the joke basically says\nthat the fastest way to end a\nrelationship is for one partner to start\ntherapy and what's the grain of Truth in\nthis unfunny joke relationships are more\neffectively destabilized not when one\nperson starts doing worse but when one\nperson starts doing better"
