    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the most\ndangerous thing for a relationship\napologies for the clickbaity title but\nhere you are in today's episode I will\nbe discussing the most concerning sign\nthat your relationship might be in\ntrouble it's a little counter-intuitive\nbut that's kind of how we like to roll\non psychics let's get to it\nmany people want to know what causes\nrelationships to fail and the general\nconsensus is that relationships often\nfail because one partner\nkind of starts to deteriorate maybe this\nperson stopped putting effort into the\ncourtship or into his or her appearance\nmaybe this person hasn't really Advanced\nhis career or her lifestyle or has\nfallen into hard financial straights or\nmaybe this person has become depressed\nor addicted or otherwise Comfortably\nNumb there are lots of ways this can\noccur but the idea here is that the\nrelationship fails when one partner\nfails or refuses to recover from some\nkind of setback and that can certainly\nbe the case however in my clinical\nexperience that's not what I usually see\nthere's this old joke it's not really a\njoke because it's not really funny but\nthe joke basically says that the fastest\nway to end a relationship is for one\npartner to start therapy\nand what's the grain of Truth in this\nunfunny joke that relationships are more\neffectively destabilized not when one\nperson starts doing worse but when one\nperson starts doing better\nwhen it comes to the long-term health of\na relationship success especially if it\nonly comes to one of the partners is\noften much more dangerous than failure\nlet's examine why this might be the case\nthe fact of the matter is that\nImprovement is destabilizing when one\nperson starts to grow in therapy starts\nto process his or her emotional baggage\nand begins taking responsibility for his\nor her own happiness this forces a shift\nin the relationship when one person\nachieves great professional success\narrives at a position of power or fame\nand enjoys significantly more social\nopportunity\nthis force is a shift in the\nrelationship when one person starts to\nwork out attend to his or her health and\nimprove overall attractiveness this\nforces a shift in the relationship and\nthis is because in a system where all\nthe parts are interconnected it's not\npossible for one thing to change without\ncausing an alteration in all the related\nParts it's not always possible to\npredict exactly how these related parts\nwill change especially if the system is\nparticularly complex but we can expect\nalteration so to speak to Ripple outward\nfrom the source of the change\nnow you might say but Orion\nthat happens when one person gets worse\ndoesn't it it isn't that a change that\nforces a shift in all the related parts\nof the system indeed it does however\nthis is not nearly as destabilizing as\nyou might think and that's because you\nhave to understand that when a change\noccurs within a system the most frequent\nresponse from the other parts of that\nsystem is to reinstate the pre-change\nconditions\nthat is most systems have a tendency\ntoward homeostasis and this is great\nnews if the change in question is\nnegative it makes it more likely that\nthe partner will bounce back from the\nsetback but not so great news if the\nchange in question is positive as it\nincreases the likelihood that the\nprogress will be undermined to preserve\nthe status quo\nnow if someone is in a relationship and\ntheir partner starts to deteriorate\nthis can be a frustrating and\ninconvenient and anxiety provoking\nsituation\nhowever if we're honest it's also not\nwithout its compensations\nthese aren't things that people will\ngenerally admit\nsometimes not even to themselves but\nthere are a lot of let's say emotional\nopportunities for the non-failing\npartner in this situation opportunities\nthat if he or she is not careful can\nvery well become traps for both parties\nbecause they keep people in\ndysfunctional relationships far longer\nthan they otherwise would\nfor instance though it's not pleasant to\nadmit one partner's failure could be the\nother partner's opportunity to feel\nSuperior or righteously indignant\nand to the extent that this failure is\nintractable like an addiction or a flaw\nor a foible the partner now has a\nPerpetual scapegoat someone they can now\nblame for all of their unhappiness not\nso fun fact relationships in which one\npartner is an alcoholic are more likely\nto end not when the addict is in the\nthroes of his or her addiction but when\nthis person sobers up\nand this is partly because the\nnon-alcoholic partner can no longer use\nthe alcoholic as a scapegoat for all of\nthe pain and suffering and\ndisappointment in his or her life if\nonly this person didn't drink if only I\ndidn't have to spend all of my time\ncleaning up after your messes or solving\nall of her problems\nthe addiction gives the non-addict the\nopportunity to feel morally Superior and\nto externalize responsibility for his or\nher suffering that's why these people\nneed to go to Al-Anon\nwhat's more if the partner in question\nis of a more codependent persuasion the\ndeterioration of one could be a project\nfor the other a source of purpose and\nmeaning\nI will do what it takes to get you sober\nwe'll get through this difficult\nsituation and it's more positive aspect\nthis can help bring people closer\ntogether\nhowever in its more Insidious\nmanifestations it can give rise to\nPerpetual victims so that Heroes can\nhave someone to save\nwhite Knights and damsels damsels in\ndistress for instance seem to have a way\nof finding each other\nin any case my point is that the\ndeterioration of a partner is not devoid\nof potential benefits\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the super\nthanks button that's the three little\ndots in the lower right hand corner and\ntip me in proportion to the value you\nbelieve you've received from this\nmessage because it's your donations that\nmake all of this happen and I'm really\ngrateful for your support\nnow on the other hand the significant\nImprovement of a partner can be much\ntrickier for the other person to handle\nit's hard to be a Perpetual cheerleader\nand the Improvement of the other can be\nperceived as an indictment of our own\nlack of progress this is especially true\nthe more the partners perceive\nthemselves to be equals as it creates\nthe conditions for Envy to occur Envy is\na complicated emotion but one of its\nmany preconditions is that it can only\narise in the context of perceived equals\nif you don't perceive yourself to be\nsomeone's equal then his or her success\nor superiority is experienced as\nadmiration\nhowever the more\nsimilar people believe themselves to be\nthe more likely they will feel envious\nof another's progress even if\nor rather especially if it's a loved one\nthe person who isn't improving may also\nstart to feel as if he or she is holding\nthe other person back or that he or she\nis increasingly the problem in the\nrelationship this is a narcissistic\ninjury and it can throw all those all\nbut those with the strongest sense of\nself for a loop and let me tell you as\nhard as it it can be to be in a\nrelationship with a problematic person\nit's often easier to deal with someone\nelse's problem than to feel as though\nyou yourself are the problem\nthis feeling causes people to act in\nwell\nproblematic ways including but not\nlimited to\nsabotaging the improving partner's\nprogress\nor undermining the improving partner's\nperception or experience of that\nprogress\nsuccess is also destabilizing here\nbecause it creates new and different\nopportunities the successful partner May\nsuddenly have access to many more people\nsome of whom may be more desirable\npotential mates the opportunity is\nthreatening and creates the conditions\nfor jealousy and games of control the\nidea here is frankly is to prevent the\nimproving partner from leaving\non the other hand dysfunctional\nrelationships are often very secure and\nthe reason is that it would actually be\nvery difficult to have that particular\ndysfunctional relationship with anyone\nelse\ndysfunctional relationships tend to be\nspecialized in their dysfunction which\nmakes it harder for either partner to\nleave even if it would be better for\neveryone involved to leave a\ndysfunctional relationship one or both\nPartners would have to learn new ways of\nrelating new ways of being in order to\nhave a relationship with someone else\nit's like the dysfunctional people have\nbecome koalas they can only eat\neucalyptus leaves\nand this creates barriers against\nexiting the relationship even if the\nrelationship approaches misery\nby contrast it's actually very easy to\nhave a relationship with a successful\nhigh functioning individual these people\nare omnivores they can eat whatever they\nwant and it's not going to cause any\nproblems do you understand\nand this perspective has been\ncorroborated by the literature for\ninstance the French sociologist Emile\ndurkheim discovered that suicide rates\ndid not go up during periods of hardship\nor economic contraction but\ncounter-intuitively during periods of\nRapid social Improvement\nthe idea here is that when times are\nhard people buckle down join together\nand strive toward a common goal with\nHope For Better Days the hardship\ncreates the opportunity for Union and\nmeaning making just like in a\nhigh-functioning relationship in which\none person suffers a setback\non the other hand periods of progress\nand growth were far more destabilizing\nas they tended to disrupt the limits\nwithin which people habitually operated\nthis sense of limitlessness which\ndurkheim called anime\ncreated a kind of vertigo a vortex in\nwhich life seemed to fall apart in the\nmidst of Plenty and progress and it is\nprecisely this enemy produced by the\nsuccess of one partner that is one of\nthe most difficult storms for a\nrelationship to weather\nwhat do you think let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as
