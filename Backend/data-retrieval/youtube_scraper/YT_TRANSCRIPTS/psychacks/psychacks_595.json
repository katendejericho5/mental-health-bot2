    "transcript": "it's important to give people the gift\nof your absence because it's your\nabsence that creates the necessary\nconditions for a reunion women like\nchildren in the reposia mall stage need\nto be allowed to come back in their own\ntime if you play your cards right you'll\nmiss this phase of the relationship\nbefore too long and part of that longing\nfor your presence should be a sense of\nwonder a hint of uncertainty men mess\nthis up all the time they try to reduce\nthat uncertainty as much as possible as\nquickly as possible they text I had a\ngreat time last night I really like you\nI can't wait to see you again it might\nbe nice for a woman to hear those things\nin the moment that she hears them but\nwhat they functionally do is they\nprovide her reassurance without actually\ninteracting with you and by doing so you\nmake the internet action unnecessary and\nredundant wow good job there is no need\nfor her to come back to you to confirm\nhow you feel as you've already made that\nabundantly clear"
