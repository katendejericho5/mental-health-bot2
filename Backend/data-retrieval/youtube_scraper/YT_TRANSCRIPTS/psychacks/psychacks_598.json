    "transcript": "hi everyone I'm Dr Orion taraban and I'm\nthrilled to be able to sit down today\nwith Alex Leon thanks for coming on the\nshow man it's really great to finally\nmeet you for those of you who don't know\nAlex is a member of the naturals\nlifestyle YouTube channel I think this\nis one of the best\nchannels on the internet with respect to\npickup and seduction I personally\nfollowed this channel for seven or eight\nyears so uh it's a personal treat to me\nto be able to meet you today Alex and\nI've also referred a number of my\nclients over the years to content on\nthis channel because among other things\nI think the folks on the channel like\nAlex do a really good job of exploding a\nlot of the myths around pickup and\nseduction it doesn't have to be cheesy\nit doesn't have to be extroverted you\ndon't have to have a six-pack there's\nways of\nmeeting girls in real life that is\nnon-creepy non-sketchy and more likely\nto lead to a satisfying encounter or a\nrelationship and I think these guys are\nno nonsense but also not\num sensationalistic or\num you know just trying to racket body\ncount either so I think they're really\nbalanced they seem like like\nwell-rounded humans which is another\nreason why I enjoyed listening to their\ncontent\nas we all are Alex also has his own\nYouTube channel that he has launched a\nfew months ago Alex Leon is that the\nhandle here\nokay yeah check him out because I'm sure\nhe's putting out some excellent content\nthese days so thank you so much for\nbeing on the channel Alex happy to have\nyou\nhello Ryan thank you so much for having\nme first of all it's an honor uh I\nchecked your channel great stuff I love\nit and yeah we were just chatting before\nI really appreciate you as a\nprofessional in the field you know\nsending us clients that really means a\nlot to to me and the whole team oh right\non well deserved so\num let's let's jump in because you're an\nexpert in pickup and seduction you've\nbeen in this space for a long time\nyou're it's your primary business is\ncoaching people\num I work with a lot of guys who are\ninterested in overcoming approach\nanxiety\nbut I also monitor the comments and sort\nof the the Timbre\nof male opinion on the channel and\notherwise and it seems like pickup has\nsort of a a bad name these days\num and a lot of guys are afraid of\napproaching not just I think because of\nthe let's say the organic fear of\nrejection that may come from a pickup\nattempt but a fear of being canceled a\nfear of being creepy\num would you speak to this to some\nextent like what's the state of pickup\nthese days\nyeah good question uh I guess\ndudes are afraid of the term pickup\nbecause it's a term that's been used for\nso many years by various dudes various\nchannels the media right pick up artists\nit's like the Artistry of like\nmanipulating women and stuff like that\nso I do understand why guys are worried\nuh the reality is totally different\nthough right I would just not use the\nword pickup I don't like to call myself\nas a pickup teacher a pickup artist or\npickup company uh because of the same\nreason I think it's about connection\num You can call it seduction but even\nthat you know has some negative\nannotations sure let's call it\nconnection because really what we're\ndoing at the end of the day it's quite\nsimple it's like we as men want to\nconnect with a woman and we are offering\nher\nthe invitation to a connection right\nlike that's really what it is at the end\nof the day it's just like we're walking\nup to a girl on the street and we say hi\nand basically that high means do you\nwant to communicate do you maybe want to\nconnect for like 30 seconds and then she\ncan say no she can say maybe she can say\nyes in her own way right prefer body\nlanguage with her words\num and that's what we do and that's what\nI've been doing for a long time\npersonally because I was\nI had the biggest approach anxiety\nuh we can talk about that if you want\nbut I was like a total zero when it came\nto that and that's what bothered me a\nlot uh and I made it here and I see it\nwith my clients over and over\nin the ladies eye approach and they\napproach because I'm listening in on the\nmicrophone women love being approached\nso for everybody who's just never done\napproaches\nand the only input they get is maybe\nlike Sensational YouTube videos where\nyou know maybe a person like gets really\nangry or where like one pickup artist\nis in the media for doing something\nhorrible\nthat's the loud minority right at the\nend of the day most people are just\nnormal people who want to connect so\nthat's interesting yeah so this is\na counter factual to a lot of men's\nbeliefs that the way to get to know a\nwoman is by asking her out on a date and\nit's like the bait is a drink or a meal\nor some sort of activity but you're\nsaying that really what a woman is most\ninterested in is the opportunity to make\nan emotional connection with another\nhuman being is that kind of what you're\ngetting at here of course yes and so\nespecially if you think about it the\nkind of woman you know who we want a\ndinner or a drink is like she's abundant\nin dinner offers and drink offers you\nknow like how if she is a certain level\nof attractiveness\nher inbox is full with invitations of\nthat caliber and much more\nso at the end of the day yes she wants\nconnection so it's a way of offering\nsomething different to stand out from\nthe intersexual competition and it\ndoesn't cost you anything I mean that's\nanother\npoint of resistance I often come up\nagainst in the comments is people think\nthat you have to have a lot of money to\ndate and\num it's just not worth it but it seems\nit sounds like what we're really\noffering is a chance to get to know\nanother human being on a deeper level\nand I think that means being able to\nwell that's interesting because the way\nthat you're describing it\ncorrect me if I'm wrong but it almost\nseems like there is no agenda here when\nwe know that men are approaching certain\nwomen and not other women you know\nthey're approaching women that they are\nattracted to\nso you would think that there's some\nsort of intention\nwhere they want the interaction to\npotentially lead\nbut it almost sounds like you're kind of\na gentleness when you speak about just\nmaking a connection with another human\nbeing is that part of the um\nthey probably definitely have an agenda\nso I would say when you say I have an\nintention\nbut I don't start with the intention of\nhey I want to sleep with you because\nthat's too fast it's too early I don't\nknow her yet right so let's say in the\nscenario\nI'm walking through the park I'm holding\nmy coffee it's whatever 11 A.M\nhaving a walk and I see a beautiful girl\nit's like the first intention I have is\nnot oh my God I want to [ __ ] her I don't\nknow if I can swear here but it's like\noh there is something that spikes\nobviously yes she's sexy right I'm a man\nshe's a woman I'm attracted yes there\nwas five women passing me that didn't\ntrigger that so of course the agenda is\nMan meets beautiful woman and of course\nher beauty is important but the first\nintention I should kind of project on\nher is like hey I wanna I wanna get to\nknow you who are you hey what's up right\nand then the intention should be hey\nuh I wanna know more about you you know\nand then if the connection here is good\nit's like hey I want to take you on a\ndate and then maybe we will go home and\nhave sex obviously I won't say that to\nher that way so there's definitely an\nagenda I guess the problem is guys lead\nwith their dick when they should kind of\nlead with their heart and I'm sure if\nthe heart says yes and the Brain says\nyes and the dick says yes amazing right\ntake her on a date\num yeah that's that's where approaching\ncan become abrasive or aggressive when\nit's just about the beauty right of\ncourse that's what triggers the impulse\nbut there should be a different\nintention first\nsounds like there must be a balance here\nif you lead too aggressively with the\nsexual intent it backfires as I think we\ncan all mostly understand why I have\nworked with some guys who struggled to\ncommunicate sexual intent at some point\nin the interaction and the conversation\nseems like it's it's sparking but then\nit just sort of Peters out and doesn't\ngo anywhere where they actually succeed\nin getting dates and they don't express\nthat intent and so they kind of end up\nin the friend zone or they hear you know\nyou're a nice guy but I didn't really\nfeel any chemistry so it is also would\nyou say important to clearly express\nyour sexual interest in a woman when\nit's appropriate to do so in\nin this exchange that's a tricky one\nright because there's a big\nmisconception I think about this whole\nterm sexual intent I hear that of course\na lot with my clients right and they\nwrite it before they come we send them a\nform oh I want to work on my sexual\nintent oh I'm not good in my sexual\nintent I want to improve my sexual\nintent it's like okay what does that\nmean do I stand in front of her and I\ntell her\nlike I look her in the eyes with like\nyou know force or does it mean I'm\nbecoming flirtatious and I'm\ncomplimenting on her looks or what does\nit mean and in my experience\nit's more like what you're not doing so\nwhen we talk about man woman what is she\nlooking at right she's basically\nassessing you as a man in a way and what\nshe's looking at is are you nervous\nslash are you confident do you feel okay\nright now can you hold eye contact\ndo you always jump in when she talks do\nyou leave pauses are you comfortable\nwith silence\nare you comfortable letting her ask\nquestions or are you always coming up\nwith the next thing the next thing so if\nyou are if you leave pauses if you're\nokay with leaving space in the\nconversation looking her in the eyes\nmaybe pressuring her on something right\nnot not being so agreeable on the flip\nside of that I believe is the sexual\nintent so it's not about the words you\nsay necessarily sure flirtation is a\nthing and being like really good with\nwords cool but I think that's a bit of a\nfantasy in the pickup world of like the\nsame with texting right I think like I\ndon't believe there's amazing texting I\nthink either she likes you already and\nthen you sure you don't [ __ ] it up on\ntext always just doesn't like you and\neven if you have the best texting game\nin the world it won't turn her around\nso that's what sexual intent for me is\nit's just like I'm super grounded and I\nknow what I'm doing and I can hold space\nand I can look at her with a smile a\nlittle bit\nthat's kind of like the the spice on top\nright where she feels now she feels sexy\nnow she feels this is something else\nthis is not a friendly conversation\nanymore this is a guy\nbeing you know being in that sexual Vibe\nthat's interesting it's very subtle\nbecause what I'm hearing you say is that\njust sort of by changing the rhythm of\nspeech the pauses between interactions\nmaybe holding eye contact just a beat\nlonger than you normally would in a\nsocial encounter by making just small\nchanges in how you behave in the\ninteraction you can communicate that\nthis is a different type of relationship\npotentially than just we're fellow\ncitizens talking in the park\nbecause it's really hard I mean it is a\nsubtle change but making that change is\nincredibly difficult like being able to\njust pause and look at a girl and like\nnot interrupt her and not feeling like\nyou need to come up with the next thing\njust really being okay in silence is\ndifficult for everybody who's done cold\napproach maybe they can relate or for\nanybody who maybe even recorded\nthemselves that can be an eye-opening\nexperience sometimes of like oh my God I\ntalk incredibly fast and I talk all the\ntime and I interrupt her all the time\nwhy am I doing this and it's like\nbecause you think she's really hot\nyou're nervous yeah I I've seen some of\nyour infield\nand infield Day game and some of the\ninteractions seem\nlike plottingly slow I thought maybe\nthat had to do with the fact that maybe\nEnglish wasn't their first language\nbecause I know you travel all over the\nworld\num and so you might need to use simple\nwords at a slow cadence to ensure\ncomprehensibility but yeah there were a\nlot of space in that interaction when I\nfirst started my training as a therapist\nsomeone told me that there's like 40\ndifferent types of Silence you know oh\nmy God stereotypically you got that that\nidiom that the eskimos have 40 different\nwords for Snow Well therapists have like\n40 different varieties of silence and\nit's not always awkward and I think\nthat's a um a misconception that people\nhave that silence means you're doing\nsomething wrong silence that goes on too\nlong is uncomfortable and it's unwanted\nI think it's actually a necessary\ncomponent's in tension and release which\nis kind of the underlying Dynamic of a\ngreat deal of attraction and seduction\nfor sure and you know we can even go\nback to the beginning of this topic\nwhere we talked about offering her\ndrinks offering her a dinner maybe even\na holiday\na beautiful woman is abandoned in that\nbut what is she actually not abundant in\nit is that presence it is that space it\nis that opportunity for her to maybe\ntalk about something she truly cares\nabout right not being bombarded with low\nlevel Small Talk questions and a man who\ncan hold space for her a man who is\ntruly present a man who can she can open\nup to that is actually\nsomething expensive something valuable\nthat a lot of women don't experience and\nif we even go further\nshe often let's say she's like really\nbeautiful right desired by every man she\nnever gets the opportunity\nto\nfight for him to seduce him to try to\nget him because she always has the\nsecurity in her life that she knows this\nguy's into me this guy's into me ah yeah\nI can easily have him right so it\nbecomes really boring for her so it\nsounds crazy but like she's so certain\nshe lives in so much certainty all the\ntime\ngiving her the uncertainty of like nah\nyou know maybe not texting back so fast\nor asking a challenging question you're\ngiving her the gift of uncertainty of\nlike I'm not sure if this guy's into me\nwhich is a new experience for her if\nshe's really attractive yeah I made a\nvideo about that recently about how\nusing uncertainty and insecurity\nstrategically is really vital to keeping\npassion and passionate attraction alive\neven in long-term relationships like we\nhave this Collective intolerance for\nthose things uncertainty and insecurity\nand I can understand you're really\nattracted to somebody you want to kind\nof there's this impulse to try to lock\nthem down as quickly as possible to seal\nthe deal but what you're saying is that\nthat's often counterproductive\nyeah for sure\nlet's talk about a main reason that I\nhear all the time that guys are afraid\nof approaching women in real life maybe\nit's reason maybe it's rationalization\nbut I hear it which is they're afraid of\nbeing perceived as creepy\nand creepy is a really challenging word\nfor me because it seems like it has so\nmuch to do with\nthe other person's perception of you\nlike the same behavior in let's say a\nman that that woman is attracted to\nwouldn't be perceived as creepy but the\nsame behavior in a woman in a man that\nthe woman wasn't attracted to is creepy\nand and that's tricky because how is a\nguy going to know if he's attracted to a\nwoman before he tries you know\nso\nwould you speak to that I'm sure that\ncomes up a lot in your in your coaching\nyeah\num how do I approach this well let's say\nlike this\nfirst of all you're right it's\ndefinitely in how does she perceive you\nand I would say if you're our normal\ndude right like the people who watch\nyour videos and the people who watch my\nvideos are not the kind of guys who are\nlike how can I\nyou know get my lay count\nby plus 100 as soon as possible like we\ndon't attract this kind of guys so I\nassume even if you're watching this\nyou're already not a creepy guy okay\nyou're just shy you just you have\napproach anxiety you're just too nervous\nto approach you two words whatever it is\nso by you doing a normal approach which\nmeans you keep the right distance you\ndon't touch her right you give a genuine\ncompliment and then you ask a normal\nquestion you're not being creepy could\nit happen that here and there a girl\nperceives you as creepy yes and that is\nthe challenge of just becoming okay with\nthat\nI would say the number one thing about\napproaching is social freedom\nit's developing a level of social\nfreedom and if you don't have that\nyou're not going to succeed because it's\ngoing to be constantly hard you always\nhave to overcome this like fear right\nyou're not socially free you care too\nmuch what people think and you care too\nmuch if one in a hundred women which is\nthe reality will think you're creepy the\nreality is one in a hundred will think\nyou're creepy right and it's like too\nbad like let her think that because the\nflip side of that is she's only gonna\nthink it for like 20 seconds\nand then she's gonna think about her\nboss or her ex-boyfriend or the Metro\ncomes or she's watching a Taylor Swift\ninterview whatever it is right it's like\neven the worst case which is like oh my\nGod I'm being discovered as this creepy\nguy because my Approach was really\nuncalibrated and I bumped into her and\nthen I dropped my hot dog and then I was\nlike almost stumbled over this little\nkid and like Oh I'm a [ __ ] creeper\nand then I told her she looks hot and\nnot that's too much it's like okay\nyou're being a creep for 20 seconds it's\nfine you didn't hurt anybody and she's\ngonna forget about you if this is too\nmuch right if this once in a is this\nfraction of a kind of experience\nis the reason you're not doing the other\n90 of beautiful approaches and women\nthinking you're brave and they're really\nthanking you and some women give you\ntheir phone number and some women go on\na date with you and some women have sex\nwith you\nthen it's just not going to work out so\nyou have to accept it that's basically\nthe thing yes some women will think it\nfor 30 seconds\ndeal with it basically yeah that fits\nwith my experience I've probably done\nover a thousand approaches and the worst\nthing that ever happened was I got kind\nof a\nyou know kind of just she just turned\naway or she did like a no you know a\nvery cold short one-word answer the vast\nmajority of women that I approached did\nnot give me their phone number you know\nit's I think that also\nI mean you're a pickup I'm sorry you're\na connection expert right but I I kind\nof think about this like baseball that\neven the Hall of Famers tend to strike\nout more than they get hits sure of\ncourse yeah so\num the VA you know the majority of the\ntime I'm not moving forward with this\ninteraction it's a one and done thing\nbut I've never had a woman sort of drink\nin my face or slap me or\nyou know get our friends around to to\nkind of like protect her or to angrily\ninsult me the vast majority of women\nwere I think authentically\nhappy with the way that I approached\nthem because it was I recognized that\nthey looked very good that they put\neffort into their appearance and\nthat's often why women put effort into\ntheir appearances so that it is yeah and\nacknowledged by others and you know I\nthink that if you do it right you can\nleave a person better than when you\nfound them\nget what you want from the interaction\nyeah and I'm always telling on Workshop\nis like what's her alternative of\nmeeting a guy right it's like out of all\nthe ways she could meet a guy it's like\nokay she could\ngo on a dating app and obviously guys\nalways complain oh dating apps are so\nhorrible for men because there's way\nmore man and you know it's this whole\npyramid and only four percent of women\nswipe on 80 of guys another all this\nmath true right dating apps suck for men\nbut are they so amazing for women like\nthey also have a lot of swiping then the\nthe guy is just texting some horny [ __ ]\nsends a dick pic as soon as he has her\nnumber on the date he might be weird you\nknow the good looking guys then also\nkind of weird okay then she can go to\nbars you can go to clubs get hit on by\ndrunk dudes okay as you could sleep with\nsomeone out of her Social Circle now her\nwhole group knows\nit's like oh or she gets approached\nduring the day by a Charming guy sober\nwho looks her in the eyes and tell her\nshe looks beautiful in this dress or\nwhatever she's like huh it could make\nher day you could text your friends\nright afterwards you can't believe what\nhappened to me now she's got this story\neven if it doesn't lead to anything\num absolutely the way that I kind of\nmentally uh prepare myself to make a day\ngame approach is I think this is This\nWoman's lucky day is oh yeah because I\nknow who I am and what I could\npotentially offer her and I'm just\ncoming out of the blue it's like she won\nthe lottery you know this is going to\nmake her weak that I'm putting myself in\nher in front of her and giving her an\nopportunity to make a connection with me\nyeah that's a great mindset\nnow another misconception that I come up\nagainst a lot with my clients is that\nto do this to approach women in the real\nworld requires a great deal of\nconfidence and or extroversion when you\nmentioned social Freedom it's\ninteresting when you said that I\nwondered if\nthat might be part of why\num maybe International\nuh Day game might be easier because if\nyou're in a country where you don't\nreally know all of the little social\nexpectations it's easier to not feel\nconstrained by them\npotentially I don't know\num yeah but the uh it's definitely more\nfun to approach when you on holiday\nbecause you're like I'm out of here in a\nweek so yeah you have a bit more\nuh yeah permission yeah\nthe the what I was going to get at was\num oh yeah this whole like extroversion\nthing like I have to be on I have to be\nvery Charming I have to be witty I have\nto be hilarious\num and you have a very different vibe\nwhen it comes to that\num both in this conversation and what\nI've seen on the channels\nI think you could describe it as low\nintensity\nso how how does that work with respect\nto\num offering women the possibility of a\nconnection\nuh yeah I think both can work and I\nalways tell dudes\nto know themselves right I know I'm\nintroverted\ndoesn't mean I'm 100 introverted but I'm\nmajorly introverted I you know I'm\nexhausted after social events I don't\nmind being alone I can be calm I don't\nneed to be the Entertainer\ncool and I work with that and then\nthere's other guys who are the opposite\nand they work with that and we both get\ngreat results because we're both in our\nrole so I think it's often dangerous to\nlook at you know either other coaches\nother YouTubers either dudes in the\nmanosphere and then think like I need to\nbecome that right it's like I mean the\nextreme examples are like Andrew Tate of\nlike Andrew Tate is good at being\nentertained you know he's like this\nkickboxing tall kind of aggressive cigar\nsmoking dude and he's playing that role\nreally really well that's why he became\nso famous right he's just like being\nhimself well nowadays there's all these\nother guys they're like I need to become\nentertained I need to talk like Andrew\nTate I need to think like and it's like\nbut it's not you like and again when we\ntalk about creating a connection well I\ncannot connect with someone who is not\nbeing himself\nlike that's putting this\nwall in front of us you know and women\nespecially they have a sixth sense for\nis this guy being real or is this guy\nwearing a mask\nand it's like I'm not wearing a mask\nwhen I'm just being my low intensity\ncalm self\nand I'm comfortable in that and\nsometimes I don't need to talk and maybe\nI come across as shy sometimes but that\nthere is a charm in that because I still\ndo the main thing which is say hi and\ngive her a compliment right obviously\nthere's the Other Extreme which is just\nI never talk to anyone ever and I don't\novercome that fear yeah that's a problem\nuh and then as the other guy is like\nmore entertaining and he's vibing he's\nlike making jokes like if I would try to\nbe that guy it would come off as fake I\ncould maybe play it for 10 minutes 15\nminutes sure I can entertain some people\nat a party but like as soon as my\nextroverted friends comes back I'm like\nall right you take over I'm out of here\nyou know so that's the main thing like\nknow yourself there's people watching\nthey're more extradors people watching\nthey're more introverted and you should\nbe in your like natural mood because\nwomen want somebody who's being real\nokay knowing yourself is fantastic\nadvice I imagine though that your\nfeedback to your coaching clients isn't\njust be yourself dude oh yeah that's\nhorrible advice right yeah that's like\nwhat your mom tells you you know so to\nmy mind there might be some uh Middle\nGround here the way the word I usually\nuse is Persona now um a Persona is not a\nit's not it's not make believe it's not\nlike you're trying to be Andrew Tate or\nyou're trying to be the extroverted\nparty guy if you're the introverted\nperson\nit's a facet of your personality so it's\ngrounded in who you are but it's kind of\nselectively emphasized in a certain\ncontext or interaction so it's it is\ngrounded in your personality but it's\nnot it's a little bit\num more performative\ndoes that make sense yeah we uh What uh\nShea my colleague says uh social Special\nForces I like that expression it's like\nyou know with weird Special Forces\nsecret agents trying to be social right\nor I like to put my students into a\nlittle bit of a soldier Warrior kind of\nmove like Yep this is a bit this is a\nbit crazy right this is a bit of a a\nchallenge you are a bit fighting against\nyour inner demons we are a bit at war\nwith ourselves here out there on the\nstreets yeah just be yourself you might\nbe terrified of going on to the\nbattlefield right so you do have to kind\nof access that that part of yourself\nthat's Brave that's courageous that that\nmoves towards the challenge or the\ndanger and that doesn't necessarily come\nnaturally to I would say most people but\nI do think it lives inside of most\npeople as a potentiality or as a a more\nminor persona\nyeah so it's kind of like tapping into\nthe right facet of your personality that\nthat kind of where you can\nyou can be in that state sustainably\nlike you said you could do the extra\nversion for about 10 minutes then you'll\nbe exhausted so how can you be socially\nsustainable what part of yourself can\nyou kind of rest in so that this is\num it's not simply just being yourself\nbut you're not totally performing a role\ndoes that make sense yeah\nyeah totally I mean I would say again if\nyou talk about approaching because\nquickly background on my you know come\nup it's like I was in a technical high\nschool for five years\nwhich means in Austria you know because\nit's a lot of villages you often live in\nin a boarding school not because it's so\nexpensive or so Elite is just like\nwe live in villages and to bring people\ntogether you have to have a boarding\nschool otherwise the way to school would\nbe too far so it was all guys for five\nyears in that boarding school and some\nlike technical women in my in my class\nso for five years I didn't know anything\nabout dating then I moved to Nicaragua\nfor a year I had kind of like the you\nknow Western exotic bonus there and\ngirls would approach me and I would get\nreally drunk in nightclubs and have\nsuccess there but then coming back to\nVienna I realized it's been the time\nwhere I like read the game and watched\nJames's first video and I was like I\nreally need to learn this approaching\nthing I was like I'm technically smart\nyou know I'm analytical I'm a good\nprogrammer I'm good at solving problems\nI might have a great job one day I might\nmake good money one day that's all like\nlooking good but I can't approach anyone\nlike not even I can't give compliments\nto people I can't stop a girl I for sure\ncannot tell her she's beautiful that's\ncrazy and that really bothered me so it\nwas really eye-opening for me of like\neven if I will have everything going on\nfor me in life like great job income car\nit was so clear crystal clear to me that\nif I am not able to be that guy as well\nright the the guy who pushes himself\nenough\nto approach strangers and hold up a\nconversation and obviously there's way\nmore to it I'm simplifying now you know\nthere's like being able to escalate\nasking her out stay grounded deal with\nrejection deal with\nuh her drama and so on like there's way\nmore to it be good in bad sexual\nescalation and so on if I'm not learning\nthese skills like what is life about\nanyway you know uh so it took me a while\nbut yeah it's just realizing that how\nimportant that is to be able to reach\nout metaphorically and create this\nconnection\num not because you extroverted because\nit's like it's you're surviving like\nit's almost a surviving skill you know\nit's like I would agree we are here to\nreproduce in a very basic way\nand like what are you doing here you\nknow it's like\nyou mentioned before we hopped on the\nrecording call that you had terrible\napproach anxiety I think that's what\nyou're alluding to here yeah how did you\npersonally get over your approaching\nanxiety\num honestly so first thing I tried was I\nmean I did a lot of like at night drunk\nokay then I realized this cannot be\nforever like okay I'm young I can still\nget wasted three times a week but it's\nnot sustainable and I tried cold\napproach\nand I absolutely failed like I was out\nwith a friend I was walking around the\nstreets of Vienna back then hours and\nhours and I didn't do a single approach\nthen I downloaded this audio challenge\nthat makes you do stuff right ask 10\npeople about the time uh tell 10 people\nthey have a nice shoes whatever and I\nfailed within day three it was a 30 day\nchallenge I couldn't do day four\nso really when I changed is when I got\nin touch with James and to the Natural\nLifestyles team and couldn't afford\nworking with them back then and I just\noffered my editing skills my photography\nskills my web design skills and\neventually James like took up took me up\non that offer and not that I received\nlike so much coaching from James or\nanything like that but just being in\nthat environment of guys\nfor whom it was normal to approach I\nthink that was the biggest shift it gave\nme permission right just walking down\nthe street with like back then like Liam\nand Tony just getting a juice and then\nseeing Liam approach a girl and then\nseeing Tony approach a girl it's like\nhuh this is fine this is you know it's\nlike something switches in your brain\nwhen you're just around the people who\ndo it\num it's almost like this the first guy\nwho broke what is it a four minute mile\nor something like that and then suddenly\na lot of other people did it and it took\nlike years before it's kind of like oh\nthis is fine and then you do it and you\ndo that environment and that's how\nreally I I got the hang of it and then\nobviously it's hundreds and hundreds of\nrepetitions by then\num but yeah so having a Social Circle\nof man A brotherhood a tribe a wingman\nwhatever you call it I think is very\nvery important I hear that I also I mean\nyou can speak from your own experience I\nalso feel like the anxiety never goes\naway entirely like it can be reduced to\nmanageable levels but there's always a\nlittle bit of a I I've tried to reframe\nit as excitement\num right before a cold approach so it's\nI think it's also\nmen making peace with certain Sensations\nin their body seeing them as not\nthreatening not dangerous and tolerable\nand also that's kind of what's fun about\nit you know it's it's that there's some\nsort of emotional jolt that you might\nget from the approach\num that's part of what makes it fun\nyeah like your reframe is good of like\nyeah it's excitement right I'm excited\nI'm about to meet a human oh my God\nwhat's going to happen wow uh another\nway that I reframe is like be careful\nwhat you wish for it's like do you want\nto feel nothing is that what you want I\ndon't think so right that would be\nboring like what do you do then then you\njust sociopathically approaching one\nstranger after the other trying to get a\nphone number so I'm I'm just trying to\nget into gratefulness of like oh yeah\nhere it is again this feeling I'm\nmeeting a stranger can I do this yes\nI've done it before will you be excited\nyes you know I'm gonna make her day like\nyou said so it's like thanks God I'm not\na robot and I'm a human and I'm about to\nmeet a stranger what a beautiful chance\nwhat a beautiful experience what uh what\na great gift of life that I'm allowed to\nconnect with total strangers right\nyeah I think that sometimes getting to a\npoint of emotional indifference at least\nwith respect to the outcome like whether\nI get the date or the number or not can\nlead to that social Freedom that you\ndiscussed earlier if we're too hung up\non\num the meaning of the Rejection it can\nbe constraining and impossible to really\nbe authentic under those circumstances I\nwould say that my own yeah that's where\nyou just set internal goals versus\nexternal goals right the the internal\ngoal is I did the approach I overcame\nthat fear I gave her a compliment the\nexternal goal is I got her number she\nwent and I was like well that's out of\nmy control exactly exactly so you can't\nrack up numbers or dates or body counts\nit's a behavior or an intention that's\nwithin your control because who can\nprevent you from doing that except\nyourself right so this is entirely\nwithin your locus of control and to me\nthat's a win\nif I if I approach or one of my client\napproaches that's a win my story about\nthis is slightly different\num maybe you've gathered on the channel\nThat psychology wasn't my first career I\nwas an actor initially and being an\nactor it's like effortless to meet\npeople you're constantly going to\nparties\npeople are always schmoozing with each\nother you're on stage everyone's looking\nat you and clapping at you it's it's a\nit's a really easy way to to meet women\nI never had any problems with that\nthen I switched careers and became a\npsychologist now I went from a very\nvisible profession to functionally an\ninvisible profession like no one sees\nwhat I do like long they can't see what\nI do\num so one of the ways that I teach men\nto become more attractive to women\ngenerally is to be visibly competent if\nyou're really good at something make\nsure that people know about it not in\nlike a and in your face kind of a way\nbut don't don't hide your talents and\nstrengths get a YouTube channel get a\ncool Instagram account that showcases\nwhat yeah I love that no right because\nif you're hidden\nlife isn't going to make the effort to\nfind you you know what I'm saying\nespecially beautiful women who might\nhave other things to do and yeah they're\nnot going to go out of their way to\nto find the the diamond in the rough you\nyou do have to give\nyour best foot forward as it were\nso I didn't have I couldn't rely on that\nlike effortless sociality that I did\nwhen I was an actor so I said okay well\nI'm dissatisfied with the dating apps I\nneed to get over I'll I'll meet women in\nreal life so I would I'd put on a suit\nwhich automatically made me the best\ndressed man in San Francisco and I'd go\ndown to like a meat market bar in uh on\nPolk Street and I said okay I'm gonna go\nand I'll there's gonna be some beautiful\nwomen here I'll go chat them up and see\nwhat this goes\nand I I couldn't do it like I was there\nfor two hours three hours I just ended\nup having two or three drinks by myself\nand going home\nand I felt like a schmuck and I'd come\nhome and I'd be beating myself up and\nI'd feel ashamed for my cowardice and\nthen the next week I put on my suitcase\nokay this is the week I'm gonna do it\nand the same thing happened for me I had\nto put on my suit and go down to that\nbar I think eight or nine weeks in a row\nwithout talking to this woman\nand I think it was the ninth of the\ntenth time that I went down there and I\nsaw a beautiful woman and I and I felt\nthe the fear begin to arise in me as\nusual\nbut then I remembered how I would feel\npredictably when I left that bar every\nnight without talking to a woman how I\nwas so ashamed of myself how I'd feel\ncowardly how I would feel alone at the\nend of the night\nand I got more afraid of that outcome\nwhich was like a guarantee because I had\nexperienced it nine times in a row I got\nmore afraid of that happening than\nanything I could possibly do to me\noften it has to get worse before it gets\nbetter and it's smoking like a\npsychologist absolutely yeah\nand so what was kind of what motivated\nme to to finally overcome that initial\nhurdle of approach anxiety is is fear of\nnot doing\nthe approach became more painful than\nanything that that woman could possibly\ndo to me\nyeah absolutely\nthat is I mean that's a great motivator\nof like\nin other words the fear of who will I be\nas a man in five years if I don't figure\nthis out who will I be as a man in 20\nyears you know who will I settle with\nlike which woman will I settle with\nbecoming my wife\nuh if I don't figure out how to be a\nstrong man how to be a good communicator\nhow to be good in bed all that stuff\njust like\nagain scares the [ __ ] out of me just\nlike I want the best I I have potential\nand that's how I measure everything like\nevery conversation has potential every\nguy has potential right it's like am I\nliving up to my potential\nand the flip side of that is like I am\nnot living up to my potential is really\nscary to me I hear that another thing\nthat comes up\nwhen I talk to guys around this issue is\nthey have some body insecurities they\nthink that they're unattractive or a big\none is height\nand I know that shorter guys do have a\nharder time relative to taller guys\nespecially on the apps women just set\nfilters and they don't even get to see\nthem\nuh how do you work with guys who get\nhung up on some aspect of their physical\nappearance\nyeah good question and I do work a lot\nwith them right\num\nsure height is a thing looks are a thing\nbut it's just a small thing right small\nokay\nuh yeah because first of all it is a big\nthing if you focus on it that's the\nissue right like guys would almost use\nit as an excuse of like oh I can't\napproach because I'm short and it\nwouldn't work anyway I'm like have you\ntried no because it wouldn't work I'm\nlike you didn't try you know\num I literally just coached a guy\nI would love to look up how tall he is\nbut he's short\nand we have it on video actually he was\na okay being filmed\num in the process of the workshop we\njust did a four day workshop in Budapest\nand you know short guy but he works out\nhe has a cool job he is very articulate\nhe's Charming he took advice really well\nhe literally approached a girl I had a\none-hour session with him he approached\na girl got her number date the same day\ntook her home the same night next day\nTinder date\neven on online date took her home the\nsame night so he had two like uh you\nknow bedroom experiences in a row and\nhe's short and just like he does\neverything else right it's like do women\nwant to date taller guys generally yes\nmy ex-girlfriend was the same height as\nme right uh I'm 175. so I don't know\nit's just like 15 in inches we might\nhave oh yeah\nokay\nyeah five eight five nine something like\nthat it's average um I think that's the\naverage yeah but she you know her\nex-boyfriend was taller but it's just\nlike I combine other elements as well\nsure if you're very short you can do\nsomething with shoes you can do\nsomething uh with the way you dress of\ncourse and if you like let's say if I\nwould be\nin a certain inches three inches or four\ninches smaller and I would live in\nAmsterdam I would probably move out of\nAmsterdam right what's that what's wrong\nwith Amsterdam I was in Amsterdam I felt\nreally short everybody in Amsterdam is a\ngiant that is it's insane yeah so like\nDutch people are really tall is my point\nit's just like if you're really short in\na country where everybody's really tall\nmaybe you want to move to a different\ncountry like if it really changes your\nlife incredibly and suddenly you know\nyou move to Latin America or Asia or\njust a different place in Europe you\nknow more south and your life quality\nchanges so much because suddenly you\nstand out as attractive and before you\nwere average then do that you know think\noutside the box\nuh that's one aspect the other aspect is\nwe as men have it so good in a way that\nwe are not uh just rated on our Beauty\nwomen are a lot right that's that is a\nfact\num if a woman is very attractive she has\nmany things in life that a woman is not\nattractive doesn't have as a man we can\nbe born quite short quite ugly and we\ncan still outwork other men we can work\non our physique we can go to the gym we\ncan work on our style we can work on our\nlifestyle like what a woman coming into\nour world what is she getting into what\nexperiences can I give you what Social\nCircle is she entering do I have cool\nfriends do I do cool stuff on the\nweekends I can of course work on my\nwealth you know money is obviously a\nthing again it's another thing not that\nonly thing but of course if you can\noffer her a cool experience if you use\nyour money basically cool holiday maybe\nyou give her a gift you make things\neasier you make things smoother you have\na nice apartment cool and mainly you can\nyour charm your communication skills\nyour poaching skills your confidence who\nyou are as a man how you you know the\nenergy you put out it's like all these\nelements you can work on\nthat will way outweigh how you look\nI would agree\nsomething that I think that you touched\non on the naturals Channel a long time\nago was the concept of inner game\nuh would you mind\ntelling the listeners what you might\nmean by that\nyeah I mean the real expert is Shea\num in a game while it's basically your\nconfidence social Freedom plays into\ninner game how you see yourself\num you know your your own perception\nlike are you the hero in your own movie\nand also overcoming these struggles so\nin a game is a very broad term is there\na specific question or\nor how important in a game is in the\nwhole okay how about this I think a lot\nof inner game comes down to being\nconfident feeling at peace within\nyourself\nit's hard to cultivate authentic\nconfidence I have my own recipe we can\nswap Secrets here\num I think it's more than just like\nstaring in the mirror and saying you're\nthe best you can do this everyone's\ngonna love you yeah\num I don't know if anyone really\nbelieves that I don't know if that works\nso do you have recipes for cultivating\nauthentic confidence\nyeah uh I mean the easiest one is\nexperience right like it's just like\nwhen I can look back and say oh I've\ndone this before hundreds of times\nsuccessfully okay that will give me a\ncertain level of confidence right of\ncourse\num if you're not there yet meditation is\nbig\nthen what I said before having a wingman\nhaving a tribe is also huge like\num because the I think the difference is\nnot even that somebody pushes you to do\nan approach it's more like coming back\nafter a rejection whatever you call it\nand then having your body there kind of\nlike waiting for you is what makes it so\neasier to just do it again right uh like\nyou will get more approaches that way\nand then that will make your game better\nand it will make your confidence better\nand again better\num\nyeah that's huge\nthere's just it's also a bit of fake it\ntill you make it right because the other\nreality is even at my level\nI've done thousands of approaches I\nsleep with very beautiful women I would\nsay you can check my Instagram\num it's just like if I stand in front of\na certain type of girl I'm still like oh\nmy God right there's still this little\nboy inside of me sometimes saying you're\nnot good enough you know she's too hard\nyou don't deserve her and it's just like\nyou can listen to that boy and being\nlike Oh yeah maybe but let's let's see\nwhere it goes let's try let's do our\nbest you know so again I don't think the\nnotion of you will be iron and your\ninner game will be perfect if you do\nit's just like you just start seeing you\njust start observing more you get more\ndistance to it right just like you don't\nbelieve everything don't believe\neverything you're thinking kind of way\nyou know\nsure I used to get that way that makes\nsense on in a performance where you know\nif it's been rehearsed enough and\nthere's multiple performances I can sort\nof like be inside watching me go through\nthe motions of\nthe vocalizations and the movements with\nthis sort of detached observation\nwhile in the midst of something that is\nvery physically Intense or even\nemotionally\num\nyou know high pitched so you can be very\ncommon\nseparate in the midst of even a\ntempestuous emotional situation\nand I think that it's good that you kind\nof normalized these doubts that men are\nsubject to having I think that that\ndoesn't mean that you are\num but there's something wrong with you\nI think almost all guys have those\nthoughts from time to time yeah it seems\nnormal especially successful guys that's\nthe other thing tell me more about that\nsuccessful guys have more of those\nthoughts you think\nI've seen this video which I thought is\nreally interesting of Alex hormozzi uh\nwhich is like the three things that\nevery like super financially successful\nguy has in common and it's like the\nfeeling that they deserve more than\nothers is the first so kind of like a\nbit like not feeling privileged but like\nyeah I should have a good life you know\nI deserved it I will I will be bigger\nthan others but then combined with like\nanxiety not feeling good enough not\nfeeling worthy and then the third one is\nimpulse control\nso it's like the confidence mixed with\nthe I don't deserve this I'm not good\nenough and I've so it's not a bad thing\nnecessarily it just keeps you humble and\nalso keeps you hungry in a way because\nyou wanna if you reach one level you're\nlike okay I do deserve this now because\nI'm having it well what's what's next\nwhat what else is there you know I hear\nthat in my recipe for confidence is the\nconsistent felt experience of success\nand so that really speaks to your\nexperience criteria and it's like if if\nyou can do the thing\nmore often than not so that you can kind\nof have confidence and look back at your\nprevious victories and say all things\nbeing equal I'm more likely to succeed\nin this scenario than not but also to\nlet that affect you emotionally\num sometimes perfectionists are sort of\nstill drowning in the midst of their\nvictories because they're focused\npotentially on the one percent that\nthey're not yet optimized right so I do\nthink it's also important to let your\nprogress emotionally impact you which\ngenerally for me requires every once in\na while looking back at how far I've\ncome like turning around and seeing how\nmuch elevation I've gained on the side\nof the mountain that I've climbed\nbecause it's easy to just sort of get\nlost in the in the grind of putting one\nfoot in front of the other for sure\nyeah you alluded to something else\nthat's very interesting is becoming\nincreasingly popular I would call it\ngeo-arbitrage I mean you talked about\nhow if you were a short guy living in\nAmsterdam you would move and you also\ntalked about how you you might have more\nsuccess in being perceived as more\nattractive in different cultures or\ndifferent places depending on how you\nlook\nyou've traveled I think all over the\nworld it sounds like you've had a very\nuh fascinating life what are some of the\nplaces that you found are\nmost conducive to meeting women\num good question again people should\nknow themselves for that answer right so\nwe could break it down let's break it\ndown into\nAsia slash Latin America kind of like\nnot a word passport Pro is a is a term\nright just dudes traveling to like third\nworld to to get women then I would say\ndeveloping countries maybe Eastern\nEurope and then like the First World\num okay\nI love Eastern Europe personally\nbecause\njust as a living standard it's like not\nthird world so things still work really\nwell uh I can and if I need a dentist\nappointment I have one this week and I\nhave a good dentist clinic you know\nprivately paid\nstill cheap uh great if I need to go to\nthe airport it's going to work if I need\nother public transportation is going to\nwork Texas is fine and so on\num\nbut it's obviously not as luxurious as\nthe first world but for my income level\nit is more it's luxurious because I can\nafford more like I live right now in a\nfour bedroom apartment with a rooftop\nthat I turn into a home gym and party\narea\num for 1600 Euros a month and I'm\nsplitting it with a guy nice and I have\ngirls live with me 24 7. so uh not to\nlike whoops sorry not to have sex with\nme or something like that just like I\nlike the female energy I like walking\nout of this after this podcast into the\nkitchen and just having a chat with uh\nattractive Ukrainian girl who's like my\nfriend\nso that's what I like you know I also\nlike that the women are\nvery feminine still\nthey are really nicely put together of\ncourse they have nice genetics beautiful\nbodies so the visual is definitely there\num they know their place in the sense of\nthe polarity is very strong still like\nmale male and female which of course\ncomes with a price right like my\nex-girlfriend is Russian okay costs\nmoney you know like she has certain\nexpectations like don't expect her to\nlike suddenly go to work or contribute\nhighly to the income or all that stuff\nor yeah she's gonna make some drama yeah\nshe has some you know certain other\nbehaviors that are me as an Austrian I\nwas like what the [ __ ] like I didn't\nexpect that right so you have to be\neither ready for that or if you're not\nthen don't do it\num\nokay then of course there's the First\nWorld Europe and North America and so on\nuh women are going to be more educated\nyou know so maybe that's more\ninteresting if you seek somebody who is\nwho you have intellectual conversations\nwith and go deep with and\ndiscuss science papers with and you know\nmaybe the woman also has a PHD and she\nalso has her job it's like that's cool\nuh and I respect that and I respect guys\nwho want that I'm just not currently in\na level in my life where I need that in\nmy female partner\nlike I have a lot of smart guys in my\nSocial Circle of course for travels for\nclients through various projects I do I\nhave high level intellectual\nconversations mainly with men and I have\nreally interesting emotional\nconversations with the females in my\nlife right so if I have like a\nheartbreak I will talk to females or if\na girl really upsets me I will ask my\nfemale friends of like why is she acting\nlike that what is I'll send a screenshot\nmaybe what she's writing like what does\nshe mean please translate into my you\nknow analytical Austrian brain language\nuh so I value that that they're just in\ntheir feminine in that sense I don't\nknow if that answers the question but\nit's like hey because I'm saying it\nagain of like some dudes move to Eastern\nEurope and love it maybe some would hate\nit some dudes are doing\nyou have one Asian chick after the other\nand they love it they're like oh my God\nI banged 100 Asian girls this year I\nwould not like it I would get really\nbored really quick they're just not so\nattractive to me right so\nwhatever do whatever you want but just\nto finish it it's like there's a lot of\nopportunity in this world that is not\nthe thing you're currently getting so if\nyou're now in a town or Village or city\nand you're just like not feeling it well\nbook an Airbnb somewhere else for a\nmonth\nask your boss to work remotely or quit\nyour job or maybe you don't have a job\nor figure it out like there's always a\nway and just be there for a month you\ndon't need to move somewhere forever\npeople are a bit too tied up of like oh\nI couldn't move there I'm like you don't\nhave to just try it out for a month\nmaybe you will really like it and it\nwill really change your life and you\nwill feel much better than you do now I\nthink that's good advice I mean we\ngenerally date before we get married so\nto just go and\nand see what it feels like to be in\ndifferent places\nuh is excellent advice before you make a\nlife-changing move what's really\ninteresting in listening to you is I was\nreminded of the fact that it seems\nperfectly socially normal to move to a\ndifferent part of the country or even to\na different part of the world or let's\nsay better job opportunities\nlike no one will bet an eye at that yeah\nbut it's very rational but the idea that\nI might relocate because it might give\nme better relationship opportunities and\nyou suddenly seem very strange\nyeah and I think that's\nI think that's interesting to note\nbecause as you've mentioned earlier that\nlike a big part of your life is going to\nbe the quality of your intimate\nrelationships and just like if you were\nborn in a small town with there when\nthere weren't a lot of job opportunities\nwhere there's not a lot of ways to make\nmoney and so you'd be resigning yourself\nto let's say a certain standard of life\nif you stayed there\num people say no I can I can pack up my\nbags and pull up my stakes and move to\nthe city or move to a different country\nand build a better life for myself that\nwe have no problems doing that when it\ncomes to money and career but we\nfor some reason feel like it's like we\nshouldn't have to do that when it comes\nto relationships\nI guess it's another form of social\nfreedom of like\num caring\nwhose opinion do you care about\nbecause you know I care about the\nopinion of people that I hang out with\nand everybody who would judge me for\nmoving to Eastern Europe like I lived in\nUkraine for two years I lived in Hungary\nnow I'm moving to Bulgaria it's like\neverybody who's judging that I'm not\ndealing with these people on a daily\nbasis anyway and it's kind of like I\ncame to a level I just don't care\nbecause I truly know that my life is\nprobably way better than theirs and\nthere's just a lot of jealousy in their\nlike opinion of like why is he moving\nthere and like in in not informed as\nwell of what Eastern Europe is and so on\nand the people who I do care about well\nthey're around here or they're like guys\nlike you or they're guys like you know\nwho run their own online businesses and\nthey also travel and also have\nexperience and they're like yeah this is\ncool that makes sense so it's just\neventually just making because social\nFreedom again is just like whose opinion\ndo you value and\ndo you live your life based on what is\ngood for you or based on what people\ntell you to do\nit's so important one thing I tell my\nclients is that even if you were to\ndevote your life to doing exactly what\nother people want\nyou would still not Escape their\njudgment they would think oh what a end\nup on a cross right this guy doesn't\nhave this anyway he doesn't he doesn't\nhave any ideas of his own like the\nJudgment of others is inescapable it's\nalso on some level none of your business\nbecause what happens in the privacy of\nother people's minds doesn't really\npertain to you\num\nand if you have to make a decision it's\nimportant to that might disappoint\nsomebody in my opinion it's better to\ndisappoint another person as opposed to\nyourself because you have to live with\nyourself 24 7. and a disappointment of\nthe other person may not be the\nfrustration of an explicit expectation\nlike something you agreed on it's just\nsomething that they want\nthat maybe you didn't necessarily even\nconsciously sign up for you know they\nmight want more of your time they want\nmore of your energy or a relationship\nand now they're feeling that this\ndecision might jeopardize their own\ncultivated expectations that really\ndidn't happen because it's challenging I\nmean you know they're like maybe they're\nlike I would really love to move to Asia\nI would love to move to Thailand and\nthis [ __ ] guy is doing it and now I\nfeel really bad about myself that he who\nmaybe went to high school with me he he\ngot the same grades as me it comes from\nthe same type of household why is he\nliving this why is he living my dream\nnow like I should I should pull him back\nlike this is not okay like he's he's not\nin his role anymore he's not living the\nrole his role is like stay in Austria\nand get a normal job and make 2K a month\nand pay your taxes but now he's not\nplaying his role which shines a really\nbad light on me the guy who's always\ndone what he's been told to do and it's\nreally threatening for people's ego\nright totally\nsuddenly a guy on the exact same level\nis upgrading\nit's like it's always easy to [ __ ] on\nrich people like oh the rich people\nthey're evil and da da that's kind of\neasy because you don't know them and at\nleast where I come from they're not in\nyour circle but it's suddenly a dude who\nwas like your buddy is now making more\nmoney and living a better life it's like\noh horrible really hard I have a video\ncoming out about this about haters and\nmy understanding is haters\nare less about hate than about Envy use\nthe word jealousy I would say envy and\nenvy yeah\nI mean we we get that confused here\nthere's a technical difference for\npsychologists but you know the words are\nfunctionally interchangeable for most\npeople\num but Envy can really only exist\nbetween perceived equals if I already\nthink that you're much better than me at\nsomething I will experience admiration\nat your superiority even if it's about\nsomething that I personally care about\nthat is related to my identity but if\nthat's and that's why Envy is always\nmost prevalent among like siblings and\npeer level friends right yeah totally\nbecause on some level it's like you're\nnot any better or worse than me and my\nconceptualization but you're living in a\nway that\nyou have a much hot you're getting these\ndifferent outcomes and it's like what's\nup with that it's a narcissistic injury\nfor me uh if I allow that to happen so\nit's a very Insidious emotion and it\noperates behind the scenes a lot of\npeople aren't even conscious of feeling\nenvious but it operates through their\nbehavior\num and I do think that you you seem to\nlive an unconventional life and I would\nsay that uh that wasn't always easy to\ndo I mean like we said with my example\nabout going to the bar you might have\ngotten to the point where it was easier\nto live the unconventional life than to\ndisappoint yourself or frustrate your\nown potential but as somebody who's\nlived an unconventional life himself a\nlot of people especially people close to\nme that I would really have wanted or\nliked to have their approval or support\nit just wasn't there\nand you you I think you learn to become\nmore individually strong and confident\nin your decisions when you take that\nunconventional path because you can't\nrely on that kind of social\nsupport that maybe you might if you made\ndifferent decisions does that fit with\nyour experience\nyeah and you cannot rely on the support\nof just the people you grew up with but\nI think we live in an incredible time\nwhere you can find your tribe\nand your new tribe member lives in\nTunisia and your other tribe member\nlives in Bali and the other tribe member\nlives in Mexico and they align with you\nand you're all chatting in a group chat\nright like that was not possible 30\nyears ago and before for thousands of\nyears suddenly I can through the power\nof the internet and then relocation even\nI can bring people together who are\naligned and we're like that's really\ncool what you're doing here you know\nthat's you should do that yes approach\nthat goal yes tell her she's beautiful\nyes put it on that new jacket yes it\nlooks good on you yes you're not used to\nit but you will get you know it's like\nyes [ __ ] work out you know that was\nmy conclusion as well it's fascinating\nwhere like exactly on the same page with\nthis it's like your biggest hater is\nprobably someone that you know and your\nbiggest fan is probably someone you\nhaven't met yet and it's important to\nuse the opportunities of the Modern Age\nand Technology to kind of stand up and\nsay hey this is who I am this is what\nI'm all about\nand give people the opportunity to see\nyou from afar and your real Community\nwill be those who recognize and resonate\nwith whatever you're putting out and\nyou'll find a way to get to come\ntogether one way or another like I love\nInstagram for that I think you know I'm\nvery aware of\nthe toxicity toxicity is that right yeah\nof social media and you know it's\nobviously addictive and these companies\nare hijacking our brain and dopamine\nsystems I'm aware of all of that right\nand that needs to be controlled and I do\nthat by having two phones for example I\nhave one phone during the day\nbecause I don't trust myself not using\nit you know and I have one phone where I\ncan indulge in when the work is done and\num I can be a bit monkey and scroll on\nInstagram but as a social tool I think\nit is incredible uh the way you can\nconnect with people the way you can\ncreate a story about yourself right you\ncould create an archetype through your\nfeed you can communicate this is what\nI'm about you mentioned before this is\nwhat I'm good at this is my passion this\nis how I see the world through stories\nuh and communicating that to men and\nwomen women you meet on the street right\nmaybe women you met on the street for\ntwo minutes and they don't know you but\nnow they can get to know you through\nyour feed and stories uh and then the\nservers of Instagram just like shouting\nthat into the world and connecting it\nwith people who are interested in it I\nthink is an amazing tool it's like it's\nisn't it crazy like it's for in for free\num I mean that's why we're talking to\neach other today not through Instagram\nthrough YouTube and just by putting that\nfree information out over time we ended\nup finding each other and connecting and\nhere you are in Bulgaria I'm in\nCalifornia we're having a conversation\nthis is so cool and I'm really happy\nthat I got to meet you I think it's been\nabout an hour do you feel kind people\nwrapping up the conversation Alex sure\nwhatever I'm free so whatever you'll\nwant to do well before we we wrap up\ntell everybody how they can get in touch\nwith you if they want to know more about\nyou and what you're doing\nsure uh easiest place to start is my\nYouTube channel\num if you type in Alex Leon dating you\nfind it I think the handle is Alex Leon\nlife l i f e uh I put out YouTube weekly\nI talk about cold approach and other\nstuff and if you want to know behind the\nscenes stuff a little bit more a bit\nless about you know cold approach and my\ncoaching business but just like what I\ndo in my wacky life you can follow me on\nInstagram uh Alex over the ocean\nso and then whoever\nwants to go deeper they will find plenty\nof stuff there I'll put links to those\nin the description below for people to\ncheck out thank you well thank you so\nmuch for talking to me today Alex it was\nfascinating it was great to finally meet\nyou\num I learned a lot and I hope that we\ncan continue a social relationship\nmoving forward\nperfect thanks so much reaching out\nreally appreciate it thanks for having\nme on and doing this all the best\nbye-bye"
