    "transcript": "in the early 20th century developmental\npsychologist Margaret Mahler described a\nphase that all children go through\ncalled the reprosha ma stage the toddler\nis up and walking and is curious about\nits environment what toddlers basically\ndo is they run off to explore say the\nbackyard in order to satisfy that need\nfor expansion and growth but once they\nlose sight of mommy they start to feel\ninsecure they start to feel a little\nafraid does mommies still exist did she\nforget about me and what they do is they\nrun back to Mommy not because they\nreally want to like spend time with her\nbut because they want to make sure that\nMommy is still there the reproach them\nall stage is a kind of approximates the\nearly courtship process alternating\nperiods of togetherness and separateness\nand where guys mess up at this stage of\nthe process is that for whatever reason\nmaybe they can't tolerate the distress\nof the woman's absence maybe they're\nimpatient for another sexual encounter\nguys try to collapse this appropriate\nrhythm of interaction one way or another"
