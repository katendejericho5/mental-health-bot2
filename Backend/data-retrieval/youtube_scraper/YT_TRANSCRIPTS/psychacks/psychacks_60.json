    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the\nstandoff between men and women so in\ntoday's sexual Marketplace men and women\nare engaged in a kind of Mexican\nstandoff in which neither one wants to\nput their gun down first consequently\nthere's been this standstill that has\nled to a significant reduction in all\nkinds of sexual relationships over the\npast 10 years let's examine why this\nmight be the case it kind of looks like\nthis women today look at men and they're\njust kind of\ndisappointed they think there are no\ngood men anymore and the men who do\nengage with them they just seem to want\nsex without commitment from their\nperspective this would mean settling for\na lot less than they think they're worth\nsince they believe that dealing with\nsuch men would be at a perceived loss\nthey would rather just remain single and\nwait until they meet a man who will give\nthem more of what they want by the same\ntoken men today look at women and\nthey're just sort of\nbewildered they think there are no good\nwomen anymore and the women who do\nengage with them just seem to want the\nmoon they're demanding and entitled and\ndelusional they seem to want so much and\noffer so little in return from their\nperspective this would mean paying a lot\nmore than they think they should since\nthey believe that dealing with such\nwomen would be a perceived loss they\nwould rather just remain single and wait\nuntil they meet a woman who will give\nthem more of what they want and that's\nkind of the situation both sides want\nthe other to move in the direction of\nits preferences women want men to give\nthem more of what they want or no sex\nmen want women to give them more of what\nthey want or no commitment or resources\nin the standoff both sides want the\nother to put its gun down first and\nsurrender its demands and neither seems\nwilling to do so this is because both\nsides believe they are being cheated in\nthe Contemporary sexual Marketplace and\nthe crazy thing is they're both right\nboth men and women are getting less of\nwhat they most want from each other and\nthe upshot is the decrease we've seen in\nall kinds of sexual\nrelationships more men and women are\ndeciding it's better just to remain\nsingle\nnow I've already discussed how we got\ninto this situation in an episode called\nappropriately enough how did we get here\nit's actually one of my all-time\nfavorite episodes so please please do\ncheck it out if you haven't done so\nalready in any case I'm not going to\ntalk about how we got into that mess\ntoday today I'm going to talk about how\nit's going to get resolved and I'm going\nto explain this resolution using a\nhistorical anecdote from the Roman\nEmpire it kind of goes like this along\nlong time ago there was a man named\nMarcus linius crus crus was not only the\nrichest man in the Roman Empire but he\nwas one of the wealthiest men who has\never lived in the history of the world\nand one of the ways he got so rich was\nby controlling the fire department in\nancient Rome when a fire broke out he\nwould show up at the scene with his\nBrigade he'd have his ladders and his\npumps and his hoses all prepped and\nready for action and\ndo nothing he do nothing\nhe just stand there watch The House burn\nfor a\nwhile eventually the owner of the house\nwould Panic what's the matter with you\ndo something are you just going to stand\nthere put the fire out and crus would\nrespond you know that's a pretty nice\nhouse you have there I mean it's\nobviously not in great condition at the\npresent moment but you can see that it\nwas quite a fine property in its time\nwould you take 50 dinari for it\nand when the owner heard this he\ntypically flew into a\nrage are you crazy I paid 100 dinari for\nthis property I can't sell it for half\nof its value who do you think you are\nthis is the most insulting offer I've\never received in my life just just do\nyour job do better and put the fire\nout and crus would respond oh I beg your\npardon I I certainly didn't mean to\noffend you and in any case I'm sure\nyou're right\nand he would go back to doing nothing\nhe'd just let the House burn for a\nlittle while\nlonger and then he would\nsay my apologies but I'm afraid my last\noffer was a bit overzealous as you can\nsee the property has deteriorated of\nlate would you mind terribly accepting\n40 dinari for\nit and this is when instead of getting\nangry most homeowners got\nquiet because they finally understood\nwhat was going on Cris was going to let\ntheir house burned to the ground unless\nthey sold and they would receive nothing\nfor their pile of ashes and this was\ntrue this was what happened Crassus\nwould only direct his fire department to\nput out the fires on properties that he\nowned otherwise he would just focus on\ncontaining the Blaze and the longer the\nhouse burnt the less he would pay for it\nsmart owners understood this from the\nget-go and accepted the offer of 50\ndinari less intelligent owners gener\ngenerally needed the second offer to\nunderstand what was happening that\nthings were going to get worse before\nthey got better either way that\nhomeowner was going to lose his house\nthat day the only question was whether\nor not he would receive anything in\ncompensation for it\nat this point most homeowners\nbegrudgingly sold the house for 40 and\ncrus would order the Brigade to put out\nthe fire he would then either keep the\nproperty increasing his real estate\nholdings or sell the property back to\nthe original owner for tce what he just\npaid turning a nice little profit and\nthis is how crus became the richest man\nin Rome obviously not a very scrupulous\nbusiness model as he exploited other\npeople's crises as his opportunities but\nthat's how it was crass has understood\nhow the standoff played out as a\nfunction of time now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom its message because it's Word of\nMouth referrals like

finally please fill\nout an inquiry form on my website if\nyou're interested in booking a paid\nconsultation the links to everything I\njust discussed are below in the\ndescription okay let's get back to\nit now let's return to the standoff in\nthe sexual Marketplace between men and\nwomen ladies I'm talking to you what you\nhave to understand is that your house is\non fire whether you want it to be or not\nyour house is on fire by this I mean\nthat your sexual Marketplace value like\nthe value of that real estate will only\ngo down as a function of time that is\nbecause the cat decides what milk is\ngood whether you like it or not your\nvalue is determined by men's perception\nof you just like men's value is\ndetermined by your perception of them\nand that perception of you is\nfundamentally anchored to your physical\nATT activeness I really really really\nwish this weren't the case both for your\nsakes and for ours I wish it weren't the\ncase for you because it sucks to be\njudged primarily by your physical\nappearance and a lot of interesting and\nimportant attributes go unnoticed when\nunpaired with physical attractiveness\nand I wish it weren't the case for us\nbecause we're just so stupid about the\nextent to which we value this attribute\nand this overvaluation can produce all\nkinds of suboptimal relationship\noutcomes however it's just kind of\nhardwired into us so you have to\nappreciate that it's not going anywhere\nanytime\nsoon so if your sexual Marketplace\nvalues are anchored to your physical\nattractiveness which only tends to\ndecrease as a function of time then most\nwomen just like the homeowner in our\nanecdote would be best served by\naccepting an offer sooner as opposed to\nlater in many cases you will not receive\na better offer than you do today which\nis why I say that women's default mode\nis to act and if you bulk at the offer\nbecause like the homeowner you believe\nit is too low then men will\njust\nwait that's the standoff and your house\nwill burn for a little while longer in\nthe vast majority of cases the next\noffer won't be as high as the last one\nyou have to understand that if your\nhouse is on fire the rational decision\nis to sell as quickly as possible so\nthat's the resolution of our Mexican\nstandoff in the beginning the positions\nmight be equal women say to men your\noffer is too low give us more or we're\ncomfortable being alone and men say to\nwomen your price is too high except less\nor we're comfortable being\nalone but what happens as time passes\njust like in the anecdote the value\nproposition changes differentially as a\nfunction of time on average and as a\nfunction of time men's sexual\nMarketplace value as reckoned by women\nincreases and women's sexual Marketplace\nvalue as reckoned by men decreases this\nmeans that the next offer women receive\nmight not be as high as the last now\nsome homeowners didn't sell their house\nto cres\nthey were insulted by his lowball offer\nand they were infuriated by his business\npractices his offer hurt their pride\nthey would rather the House burn to Ash\nthan allow him to get his hands on it\nfor less than what they thought it was\nworth at the end of the day they had no\nhouse and they had no\nmoney but at least they had their pride\nthe pride of not selling to an\nunscrupulous businessman\nof course the only they only thought\ncis' offer was too low because they were\nanchored to the value of what the house\nonce was I.E when they first purchased\nit not to the value of what the house\nwould soon be I.E when it is a\nsmoldering Rubble they thought that an\noffer of 40 dinari would be a loss of 60\nfrom what it once was not a gain of 40\non what it would soon\nbe and their pride objected to that\nperceived loss this is why I say that\nwomen's greatest enemy is their pride\npride prevents people from selling at a\nperceived loss however the longer they\nwait the greater the perceived loss\ntends to be this means there are really\nonly two strategies here if you're\ncommitted to going all the way and\nseeing your house potentially burn to\nthe ground without receiving any\ncompensation for your loss which is\nabsolutely your right then don't budge\ndon't ever move not a single\ninch\nhowever be serious with yourself if\nyou're not actually willing to see the\nstandoff all the way to its ultimate\nconclusion if you're not willing to see\nyour house reduced to ashes then you\nshould lower your gun as quickly as\npossible and accept the offer because\nthe longer you wait the more your house\nwill burn and the worse the next offer\nwill be just like escaping the sunken\ncost fallacy you have to let go of the\npast in order to save your\nfuture something to\nconsider what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know in\nthe comments below as always I\nappreciate your support and thank you\nfor listening and
