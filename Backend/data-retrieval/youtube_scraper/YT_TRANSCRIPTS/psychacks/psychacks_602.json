    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how men\nmess up new relationships this issue I'm\nabout to discuss is very common in this\nepisode I'll discuss what this issue is\nwhy it's a problem and what you the male\nviewer can do instead so you don't have\nto go through the premature termination\nof a promising relationship let's get to\nit\nto understand how men fumble in the\nearly stages of the courtship process we\nhave to take a quick detour into the\nfield of developmental psychology\nin the early 20th century developmental\npsychologist Margaret Mahler described a\nphase that all children go through\ncalled the reproachment stage this\noccurs between a year and a half and two\nand a half years of age the toddler is\nup and walking and is curious about its\nenvironment the world is fascinating\neverything is new and it wants to\nexplore to learn to grow to mature\nthat's the organic propensity of life\nthat said the child only recently\nlearned it's a separate entity from its\nmother does not yet possess the\npsychological concept of object\npermanence and is very small and\nvulnerable this is a tricky situation to\nbe in\nso what toddlers basically do is they\nrun off to explore say the backyard or\ndifferent corners of the house in order\nto satisfy that need for expansion and\ngrowth but once they lose sight of mommy\nonce they're out of earshot they start\nto feel insecure\nthey start to feel a little afraid does\nmommy still exist did she forget about\nme\nand what they do is they run back to\nMommy not because they really want to\nlike spend time with her but because\nthey want to make sure that Mommy is\nstill there\nand this is why Mahler talked about how\nit's really important in this stage for\nparents to be a secure base for their\nchildren like Mommy needs to be home\nbase so that the child can come back for\nreassurance and encouragement when it is\nfeeling uncertain and insecure and once\nit's reassured it runs off and gets back\nto exploring\nso the reproach them all stage is a is\ncharacterized by a lot of back and forth\nI'm running away and now I'm running\nback I'm running away and now I'm\nrunning back\nand this stage kind of approximates the\nearly courtship process alternating\nperiods of togetherness and separateness\nand where guys mess up at this stage of\nthe process is that for whatever reason\nmaybe they can't tolerate the distress\nof the woman's absence maybe they're\nimpatient for another sexual encounter\nfor whatever reason\nguys try to collapse this appropriate\nrhythm of interaction one way or another\nthat is either they try to get her to\nstop exploring to secure a commitment\nquickly and before she's ready or they\ntry to call her back sooner to decrease\nthe periods between subsequent\ninteractions\nand doing either one of these things is\ngoing to jeopardize the burgeoning\nrelationship\nnow most women want commitment that is\nmost women want committed relationships\nfrom the men they want to have those\nrelationships with but they kind of want\nto trap themselves in that relationship\nas opposed to feeling like they're being\ntrapped by the men that they're dating\nand let me tell you if a mother isn't\ncomfortable for whatever reason with the\nchild running off and spending time\nwithout her and tries to call the child\nback before the child is ready to return\nand that mother is going to be met with\nindifference or willfulness or\nfrustration\nas hard as it may be the mother has to\ntolerate her own distress in the face of\nthe growing Independence of the child\nand Trust the child will come back in\nits own time\nand if the mother tries to accelerate\nthat moment through her own insecurity\nor impatience she's going to pass\nthrough a difficult time\nby analogy men you have to tolerate\nwhatever distress or discomfort comes up\nin you when you haven't heard from a\nwoman in a certain amount of time\ntrust the process and have confidence\nthat she will return in her own time and\nif you need more help with this check\nout my episode How to Love Without\nemotional attachment\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the super\nthanks buttons the three little dots in\nthe lower right hand corner and tip me\nin proportion to the value you feel\nyou've received from this message\nbecause it's your donations that make\nall of this happen I really appreciate\nyour support\nnow let me talk about a distinct but\nrelated way in which men snatch defeat\nfrom the jaws of success in the first\nweeks or months of dating\nremember when I described the reproach\nthem all stage I noted that it's when\nthe child hasn't seen mommy in a while\nthat it starts to feel anxious and\ninsecure\nand it's these emotions that motivate\nthe child to go back to make sure mommy\nis still there\nthe important thing to appreciate here\nis that if the child didn't feel anxious\nor insecure the child wouldn't go\nrunning back to Mommy\nso what does this mean with respect to\nthe courtship process men what it means\nis that though it's weird to say the\nanxiety the uncertainty the instability\nthese things are your friends\nbecause it's these things like in the\ncase of the child that are going to\nmotivate the woman to return\nfor her to come back she kind of has to\nmiss you to wonder about you and to\nquestion whether you're still going to\nbe there\nand she can't miss you or wonder about\nyou if a you don't allow her the time\nand space to miss you and B if you don't\nallow her to wonder about you because\nyou've already confessed your feelings\nfor her\nas I've mentioned before it's important\nto give people the gift of your absence\nbecause it's your absence that creates\nthe necessary conditions for a reunion\nyou can't reunite with someone who never\nleaves or who is not allowed to leave\nwomen like children in the reposia mall\nstage need to be allowed to come back in\ntheir own time seriously don't worry\nabout it if you play your cards right\nyou'll miss this phase of the\nrelationship before too long\nand part of that longing for your\npresence should be a sense of wonder a\nhint of uncertainty\nmen mess this up all the time they try\nto reduce that uncertainty as much as\npossible as quickly as possible they\ntext I had a great time last night I\nreally like you I can't wait to see you\nagain like good work dude\num it might be nice for a woman to hear\nthose things in the moment that she\nhears them but what they functionally do\nis they provide her reassurance without\nactually interacting with you\nremember when the child is feeling\ninsecure it actually had to run back to\nMommy for that reassurance and here you\nare providing the reassurance without\nthe interaction and by doing so you make\nthe internet action unnecessary and\nredundant wow good job there is no need\nfor her to come back to you to confirm\nhow you feel as you've already made that\nabundantly clear the reunion is made\nnecessary by the separation and the\nuncertainty don't mess with them\nideally and this is especially true in\nthe early stages of the courtship\nprocess the woman should feel unsure\nabout how you feel about her\nthis creates the necessary conditions\nfor further interaction to resolve that\nuncertainty like after you first sleep\nwith a woman she should pass through a\nmoment where she begins to wonder\nwhether that was just a one-night stand\nshe should think oh that's strange I\nusually hear from a man by now\nwas he just using me for sex was that\njust a hookup I thought he liked me the\ndate went really well huh\nthis is a good place for a woman to be\nbecause it creates the emotional\nmotivation for her to come back to\nresolve her uncertainties\nand before I get any Flack for this\nsuggestion just consider that the\nalternative is trying to get women to\ncome back before they're ready to do so\nand we all know how well that goes\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider becoming a channel
