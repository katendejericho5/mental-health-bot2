    "transcript": "so this is an extremely important skill\nthe ability to make friends and it gets\nharder to do as you age it's not always\neasy to make friends in high school and\ncollege but it will never be easier to\nmake friends than it is in high school\nand college and this is because you are\nmore or less forced to spend a great\ndeal of time with people your own age\nand you don't have a lot of other things\nto do or a lot of other responsibilities\nand so your free time defaults to your\ncohort and For Better or For Worse these\nfolks that you become friends with in\nhigh school or college tend to be your\nfoundational friends and you may stay\nfriends with them for the rest of your\nlives as they say you can't make new old\nfriends the issue is not so much that\nthese friends have falling outs though\nthat can happen but that they slowly\nbecome less important as their lives\ndiverge and this is particularly true\nfor men"
