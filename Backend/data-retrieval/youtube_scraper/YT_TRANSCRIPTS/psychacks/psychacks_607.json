    "transcript": "maintaining their friendships is\nsomething that women generally do better\nthan men not only because they seem to\nenjoy emotional connection for its own\nsake more than men do but because they\nkind of play 4D chess with their social\nrelationships as well like a woman will\ntake a girlfriend out to lunch because\nshe thinks that if she allows her to\nvent about her husband in two months\nshe'll be more likely to accept an\ninvitation to her baby shower something\nlike that women see how putting the time\nin now might come in handy later and\nthey enjoy spending time unless\ngoal-oriented contexts don't get me\nwrong I'm not saying that men don't\nvalue their friends the platonic\nrelationship between two male friends\nmight be one of the strongest and purest\nrelationships on this planet it's more\nlike men are socially incentivized and\nrewarded for prioritizing other things\nabove their friendships"
