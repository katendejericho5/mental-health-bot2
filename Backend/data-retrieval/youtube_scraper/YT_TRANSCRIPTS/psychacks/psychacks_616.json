    "video_title": "Most MEN ARE ROMANTICS: understanding the core belief of romanticism",
    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic today short talk is most men are\nRomantics\nso this statement flies in the face of\nwhat most people believe isn't it the\nwomen who are interested in flowers and\ncandlelit dinners and Wedding Bells Etc\nturns out that this is only the most\nsuperficial conceptualization of\nRomanticism once I revealed the belief\nat the core of romantic love you'll\nunderstand that most men on this planet\ntoday are Romantics especially in the\nwestern world let's get to it\nin the sexual Marketplace things are not\nalways what they seem\nfor instance many women are romantic on\nthe surface and pragmatic at their core\nthey are making cold rational decisions\nabout who to mate and date and often do\na great deal of social Research into\ntheir targets and use all kinds of\nstrategies to secure the best possible\ndeal for themselves among their\navailable options\non the other hand men tend to be\npragmatic on the surface and romantic at\ntheir core\nthere's even this popular machismo that\nstruts surrounding crows man I don't\ncare I don't even need women\nthey are Stone Cold up until the girl\nwalks out the door and then they're a\nmess for weeks or months afterwards\nnever trust a woman\ngenerally means of course that the man\nin question once in fact\ntrusted a woman\nprobably because he was under some\nillusions with respect to how women love\na lot of angry men are actually spurned\nRomantics who still cling to their\nbeliefs about how things are supposed to\nbe\nand this becomes even clearer when we\nappreciate the most common male romantic\nbelief\nit's not what you expect but if you can\nunderstand why this one belief might be\ntrue then it opens the door for\neverything else that I've been teaching\non this channel about intersexual\nDynamics this is key\nand it's going to hurt me to say it\nbecause it's actually a really beautiful\nidea it's just not based in reality and\nhere it is the most common male romantic\nbelief is\nI can be loved for who I am\nthat's it\nthis is a romantic belief and it's a\nromantic belief because it's based on\nfantasy it's a beautiful fantasy mind\nyou the idea that you can be loved just\nfor who you are or accept it as\nintrinsically enough and deep down\nthat's what most men want\nlet me tell you women out there it would\nbe so easy to get any man that you\nwanted all you have to do is cater to\nthis romantic fantasy\nI don't need any of that stuff those\nother girls need I'm not materialistic I\nlove you for you\nand I love you just the way that you are\njust being with you is enough\nevery man in his heart of hearts wants\nto hear this from his woman\nand that's the fantasy\nthe fantasy is as a man you can just be\nand that who you are can be sufficient\nto secure the love and loyalty of a\nwoman\nand it's not\nI really really wish it were but it's\nnot\nyou can have that kind of relationship\nmaybe with your parents though not all\nof us are that lucky maybe with your dog\nyou can have it with God\nbut you cannot have it with a woman that\nyou're in an adult relationship with\nthe fact of the matter men is that you\nhave to provide benefit to a woman in\norder to justify her choosing you over\nall of her other available options\nshe's there because of what you do for\nher in terms of resources and lifestyle\nopportunity\nand of what you do to her in terms of\nAttraction and emotional experience\na woman is not going to choose a man for\nthe love in his heart or the beauty of\nhis soul\nor the understanding in his mind\nthat's not how women operate\nthey even have trouble considering a\nman's potential it's what he does that\ncounts\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow\nand you can also hit the super thanks\nbutton it's the three little dots in the\nlower right hand corner of the screen\nand tip me in proportion to the value\nyou believe you've received from this\nmessage because it's your donations that\nmake all of this happen I couldn't do it\nwithout you and I really appreciate your\nsupport\nso here it is\nmen have to provide value in order to\nsecure mating and dating opportunities\nif you can accept the truth of this one\nstatement then everything else that I've\nbeen talking about with respect to the\nbehavioral economics of relationship\nstarts to make sense it is essentially\nthe red pill in one sentence\non the other hand the blue pill is\nfundamentally romantic ideology that I\ncan be loved for who I am\nthat my loyalty and my virtue and my\nlove can and should be enough to satisfy\na woman\nit's not\nwomen like romance but they don't need\nit\nwhat they need is value\nwhat men when men don't have that to\noffer they try to compete with the men\nwho do by offering love instead\nthis is why I said that romance is for\nmen\nthe idea that the intensity of my\ndevotion or the purity of my love is\nsomething more noble more refined than\nanything that can be bought or anything\nthat a man with means and success can\nprovide and therefore should be prized\nhigher than those things in a woman's\ndecision making is ultimately a\nmarketing strategy\nit's an attempt to influence the\nperception of the target audience to\nincrease demand for the commodity in\nquestion\nin reality we all know that it's not\nenough for a man to be loved by just\nbeing himself because if it were\nevery man would be in a relationship\nevery man would have women talking to\nhim\nevery man would have options with women\nremember there's more of them than there\nare of us so simple supply and demand\nshould be working in our favor and that\nis clearly not the case\nwhat happens is that the top level men\nare securing the vast majority of female\nattention\nand they do this not because of who they\nare deep down inside\nbut because of what they've built\nand of what the women believe they could\nprovide as a consequence of their status\nand success\nthat's why the women are there\nand once you come to terms with that you\nkind of have to grieve the idea that a\npurely romantic love with a woman is\npossible\ngrief I think it really is a grieving\nprocess and this is hard for a lot of\nguys because it's actually a beautiful\ndream\nif that's how the world worked maybe the\nworld would be a better place a comment\non one of my former videos sums this\nposition up nicely the person wrote\nwouldn't it be great if we could just be\nwho we are and people would love us for\nthat instead of playing all the\npsychological games\nmaybe it would be great but that's not\nthe world we live in my friend\nand abiding in a fantasy ultimately\ncauses more pain than accepting reality\never could\nsomething to consider\none final word of advice if you'd like\nto learn more about this I would highly\nrecommend that you check out my playlist\nthe truth about romance in that series I\nbreak down many of the components of\nromantic love that together conspire to\ncreate tragic and unfulfilling outcomes\nfor the romantics themselves what do you\nthink does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel you may also\nconsider becoming a channel
