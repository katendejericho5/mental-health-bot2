    "transcript": "the more that you personally benefit\nfrom your action the less meaningful\nthat action becomes and that's because\nthose personal rewards like weeds kind\nof Choke out the space in which\nmeaningfulness which is a more slow\ngrowing tree would otherwise Sprout do\nyou get what I'm saying some fights are\nworth fighting even if we personally\ncan't win and that's because some fights\nare really Wars that must be fought over\nGenerations perhaps even eternally the\nvictory may not be for us to enjoy\nhowever we can choose to you know move\nthe standard a little further down the\nfield and Unite with a movement that has\nsomething larger than us is transcendent\nby Nature fighting for a victory that\nyou won't be able to enjoy negates the\negoic contribution to the effort and\ncreates the opportunity for something to\nmatter more than your little Personal\nAchievement this is how meaning is born"
