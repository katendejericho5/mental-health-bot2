    "transcript": "the answer to the question what would\nyou still do if you knew you couldn't\nsucceed will reveal to you the most\nsignificant opportunities to develop\nmeaning in your life if you think about\nit it's actually hard to transform an\nachievement into something more\nmeaningful that's because achievement is\nan external reward like money or sex or\nstatus or faith these things are\ncompensations for successful effort and\nbecause they exist there is no reason\nfor your mind to produce internal\ncompensations it's like how are you\ngoing to focus if you're popping\nAdderall all the time but if we remove\nall of those external compensations if\nwe take away all the money and the sex\nand the status and the fame if we even\ntake away the self-satisfaction of\nvirtue or the possibility of\ntranscendent Glory then the mind will\nbegin to generate a compensation for\nitself and that compensation is meaning"
