    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is\npsychack's Better Living Through\npsychology and the topic of today's\nshort talk is why men end up with train\nwrecks so this will be an important\nepisode for the gentlemen out there the\ngeneral understanding is that men end up\nin toxic relationships because they\nignore the red flags of poor character\nand disordered personality early in the\ncourtship process often because they are\nnot thinking with the right head\nthere are plenty of videos on YouTube\nabout dating red flags and some of them\ncan be quite useful however this won't\nbe another one on cycls we like to go\npast the obvious and deeper than the\nsuperficial and this is a particularly\njuicy subject from a psychological\nperspective today I'm going to give you\nthree unexpected reasons why men end up\nwith train wrecks and before I get into\nit you should understand that I'm going\nto be talking from personal experience\nin my teens and 20s I had a sixth sense\nfor women with whom I could have\nspectacularly destructive relationships\nI could walk into a room full of people\nand like sniff out the women who would\nbe down to ride the roller coaster my\nrelationships were extremely passionate\nand intense were characterized by brain\nmelting sexual chemistry and were\nfundamentally unstable and destructive\nthat was what I was attracted to\nthese women never failed to turn me on\nhowever I would eventually get fed up\nwith the drama and when I did I sought\nout a nice responsible emotionally\nstable woman to date\nwho absolutely bored me to tears\nI did my best but I could not drum up\nany authentic interest in these women so\nwe would inevitably be and we would\ninevitably break up and I'd go back to\nfind another roller coaster\nrepeat\neventually\nI got to the place where I realized I\nhad two equally unattractive options\neither I could go after what I was\nauthentically attracted to but was\nabsolute poison for me\nor I could resign myself to a decent\nwoman\nwhom I felt nothing for\nand I'm sharing this story because I\nhave a hunch that there are quite a few\nmen out there\nwho are nodding in agreement right now\nthey find themselves currently in a very\nsimilar situation if this is you then\nhave courage there is a way out of this\npredicament I found a way out myself\nthough it will likely take time and\neffort to get there let me explain\none of the main reasons why I was in\nthis predicament to begin with was back\nin the day\nI was pretty messed up\nI was raised in a very chaotic family my\nrelationship models left much to be\ndesired I experienced a lot of death and\nloss in my teenage years I was just not\nin a good place\nall that is to say I had a lot of\nemotional wounding\nand that wound was the sixth sense I\nmentioned earlier\nit resonated it like came to life in the\npresence of women with a complementary\nwound\nand in a room full of people there are\nplenty of wounded women\nI don't really understand how this works\nand I know this doesn't sound very\nscientific but it's like experientially\ntrue\nover and over again I found myself with\nwomen with complementary wounds\nand when we got together we would\nreenact our wounding with each other in\na way that certainly didn't feel good\nbut that felt familiar\nit felt familiar even though it was\npainful if you grow up in Conflict then\nconflict feels familiar if you grow up\nin chaos then chaos feels familiar\nunderstand For Better or For Worse\nhumans and especially children can get\nused to anything\nin any case what I ended up doing was I\nbegan to heal\nthat inner wounding through a number of\ndifferent methods and what I discovered\nwas that my attraction to women\norganically shifted to the extent that\nmy emotional wounding healed\nI'm not talking about trying not to be\nattracted to what I was attracted to or\npretending to be attracted to what I\nwasn't attracted to I'm talking about\nwhat I was authentically attracted to\nbegan to change but not overnight\nslowly over months and years I found\nmyself increasingly attracted to\nemotionally stable women for the first\ntime in my life and let me tell you\nthis was fantastic in fact it might have\nbeen a lifesaver being attracted to\nemotionally stable women solves a lot of\nproblems before they even arise\nso that's the first reason why men end\nup with train wrecks they have unhealed\nemotional wounds that motivate them to\nreenact that wounding with women with\ncomplementary wounds because doing so\nfeels familiar\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow\nand you can also hit the super thanks\nbutton those are the three little dots\nin the lower right hand corner and tip\nme in proportion to the value you feel\nyou've received from this message\nbecause it's your support that makes all\nthis happen I really appreciate your\nhelp\nhere's another reason\nback in the day given the privileged\nperspective I had into my own\nConsciousness I have to admit that I\ndidn't think too highly of myself\nin fact I had pretty low self-esteem\nand because I didn't think highly of\nmyself I also figured that a successful\nstable intelligent loving woman\nwould have absolutely no interest in me\nthis of course was my own self-rejection\nprojected out into the world but that's\nhow I thought back then that's how I\nfelt and because I felt like I wasn't\nthe fastest lion in The Pride so to\nspeak I kind of targeted the gazelles\nwith a limp\nif you understand my meaning I went\nafter women with obvious defects because\nI thought I was defective myself\nand this basically translated into\nhaving low to no standards with respect\nto the character of the women I got\ninvolved with the character mind you\nbecause despite my low self-esteem I\nremained as superficial as ever which\nbasically meant that I didn't care about\nanything else as long as she was hot\nnow as I began to heal my wounds as I\nbegan to build a life worth living as I\nbegan to achieve some measure of\nexternal success as I began to do hard\nthings and grow my confidence and\nself-esteem I kind of discovered that I\nno longer needed to Target limping\ngazelles at this point I was one of the\nfastest lines in the pride I could chase\ndown nearly any gazelle in the herd\nso that's the second reason why men end\nup in train wrecks their low self-esteem\ntells them that they don't deserve\nbetter\nwhich brings us to the third reason now\nthis is going to sound really weird but\none of the reasons why men get involved\nwith disastrous women is because on some\nlevel\nthese women are safer than stable women\nthey're safer and I guarantee that's not\nthe word that you expected me to use but\nhear me out\nwe often talk about the fear of\nrejection but in my experience a fear\nthat's just as prevalent and destructive\nas the fear of rejection is the fear of\nacceptance\nthough people don't like to admit it\nmeeting a person who is responsible and\nintelligent and successful and\nattractive and commitment-minded and\nloving and single that is meeting a\nperson with whom there is no obvious\nobstacle to your happily ever after is\nthreatening\nSt Augustine famously prayed O Lord give\nme chastity\nbut not yet\nin today's day and age the prayer might\nbe amended to oh Lord give me a life\npartner\nbut not yet\nlook at it this way\nwho is it easy to tell your deep dark\nsecret to\na stranger in a bar or your wife\nin the vast majority of cases it's the\nStranger in a bar\nwhy because you might not ever see that\nperson ever again in your life\nso your secret is kind of safe with them\non the other hand if you tell your\nsecret to your wife and that disclosure\nis met with judgment or hostility then\nyou have to look in that woman's face\nand see the memory of that disclosure in\nher eyes for the rest of your life\nthe stakes get really high when you\nintroduce the idea of the rest of your\nlife\nin many respects that's why my\nprofession exists at all therapists are\nideally non-judgmental secret Keepers\ncompletely separate from the rest of\nyour life that's what makes us safe\nso if dating women with obvious issues\nis threatening\nI'm sorry so if dating women without\nobvious issues is threatening as they\nrepresent a clear and unobstructed\nPathway to the rest of your life many\nmen seek out women with obvious issues\nand they do so because they can tell\nthemselves oh this is never going to go\nanywhere this so this is not serious\ntheir defects make them safe\nand that paradoxically motivates men to\nspend time with these women and weeks\nturn into months and months turn into\nyears and in this way guys can end up in\nrelationships with women with whom they\nhad absolutely no intention of ever\ncommitting to\nso that's the third reason why men end\nup with train wrecks they feel safe\nspending time with women when they think\nit's never going to last\nstrange but true the same thing could\neven be said for women and bad boys\nworks both ways\nso there you have it instead of five\nways to spot a narcissist I've given you\nthree counter-intuitive but\nexperientially true reasons why men end\nup in bad relationships learn from my\nmistakes men if I can you can too\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider becoming a
