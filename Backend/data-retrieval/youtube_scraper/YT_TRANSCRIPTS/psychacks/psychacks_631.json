    "transcript": "overcoming approach anxiety isn't much\ndifferent from overcoming any other fear\nthe way to do it is to do it you could\nwatch hundreds of videos just like this\none and read a bunch of books and take\nsome courses and purchase expensive\ncoaching sessions But ultimately the\nonly way to overcome approach anxiety is\nto approach women there's no way around\nit if you approach enough women you\nshould gradually diminish this anxiety\nand if you do everything else except\napproach women it's unlikely that you're\ngoing to move the needle in an\nappreciable way the trick is to actually\ndo the thing and have an emotionally\ndisconfirming experience in this case\nthat means approaching enough women to\nemotionally trust that all other things\nbeing equal approaching women is a\nnon-terrible experience"
