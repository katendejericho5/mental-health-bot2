    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\novercome approach anxiety\nmost men have approach anxiety it's very\nrare for a man to feel naturally\nconfident in his ability to go up to a\nwoman he doesn't know\nstrike up a conversation and move the\ninteraction in the direction of a sexual\nrelationship\nthe ability to do these things is a\nskill set that men can and do learn but\nit's difficult to do so as it requires\novercoming a significant fear as I\nmentioned in a previous episode this\nfear is deeply rooted in an unconscious\nassociation between female rejection and\nthe threat of Extinction\nso it's very difficult to eradicate and\nit may never go away entirely however it\nabsolutely can be reduced to manageable\nlevels today I'm going to be talking\nabout how to do this\nnow overcoming approach anxiety isn't\nmuch different from overcoming any other\nfear the way to do it\nis to do it\nyou could watch hundreds of videos just\nlike this one and read a bunch of books\nand take some courses and purchase\nexpensive coaching sessions but\nultimately the only way to overcome\napproach anxiety is to approach women\nthere's no way around it if you approach\nenough women you should gradually\ndiminish this anxiety and if you do\neverything else except approach women\nit's unlikely that you're going to move\nthe needle in an appreciable way\nthe trick is to actually do the thing\nand have an emotionally disconfirming\nexperience in this case that means\napproaching enough women to emotionally\ntrust that all other things being equal\napproaching women is a non-terrible\nexperience\nand if you have to do it to do it in my\nopinion it's best to rip the Band-Aid\noff and take Massive Action\nthis is because it might take hundreds\nof approaches before your emotional\nprogramming begins to shift\nif you approach women here and there\nonce or twice a week then it could take\nyou years before you hit that critical\nthreshold that's a significant amount of\ntime\na while back I worked with a man in his\n20s to overcome his approach anxiety he\ndid it in a weekend\nbut he had to approach 676 women\nand from the way he described it let me\ntell you this man went on an emotional\nJourney over those 48 hours from his\ninitial fear and Terror\nto pain and shame to rage and contempt\nto hopelessness and despair\nuntil ultimately he arrived at emotional\nindifference\nand to his amazement\nthis wasn't an indifference he had to\nfake or an indifference he had to try to\nmaintain it became his default Baseline\nbut to arrive here he had to be rejected\nenough times\nto emotionally understand that no is\njust information\nit doesn't have to hurt it doesn't have\nto be personal and it doesn't have to be\npermanent\nand when he arrived here\nhe was positively rapturous he told me\nit was the first time in his life he\never felt truly free\nit was a real breakthrough and he did it\nin a weekend\nand some guys won't do it in 10 years\nobviously it wasn't a very comfortable\nweekend but you know it might not\notherwise have been a very comfortable\ndecade\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow\nyou can also hit the super thanks button\nthe three little dots in the lower right\nhand corner and tip me in proportion to\nthe value you feel you've received from\nthis message because it's your support\nthat makes all this happen I really\nappreciate it\nnow let me talk a little bit about how\nto approach a woman confidently as many\nof you know I used to be an actor\nsome people have this belief about\nacting that acting is lying\nand I would counter that bad acting is\nlying\ngood acting on the other hand is telling\nthe truth under imaginary circumstances\ngood actors are honest they're authentic\nit's the situation that's made up\nso let's talk about how to tell the\ntruth under imaginary circumstances from\nthe perspective of an actor\nlet's say that you're playing a\ncharacter whose pet rabbit died and he's\nsupposed to be completely crestfallen\nand let's also say that you couldn't\ncare less about rabbits maybe you even\nhate rabbits with their beady little red\neyes and their constant stench and their\nunfriendly nature and you could give a\n if a rabbit died obviously you\ncouldn't ask yourself how would I feel\nif my pet rabbit died it wouldn't work\nfor the scene\nso what you would have to do in the\nprivacy of your own mind is either evoke\na memory or elaborate a fantasy as\nvividly and as realistically as possible\nthat would actually cause you to feel\ncrestfallen and you would focus your\nmind's eye on that memory or fantasy as\nintensely as possible\nexternally you'll be saying your lines\nare following your blocking you'll exist\nin the artificial construct of the scene\nbut internally you'll be focused\nentirely on your imagination\nyou'll actually be present to whatever\nmemory or fantasy you've elaborated in\nyour mind\nand it's this skill of being\nsimultaneously aware of external reality\nwhile focused on the internal\nimagination that makes for good acting\nthat allows for people to be truthful\nunder imaginary circumstances it's a\nskill which means like any skill it can\nbe learned\nso what does this have to do with\napproaching women well\nif you're in a bar and the scene calls\nfor you to approach an attractive woman\nand you ask yourself well how would I\nfeel about approaching an attractive\nwoman in a bar if you're like most men\nyou're going to think well I would feel\nnervous about that\nbut that's not what the scene calls for\nright\nso let's assume the scene calls for\nconfidence and poise\nwhat can you do well in the privacy of\nyour mind you can either evoke a memory\nor elaborate a fantasy as vividly and as\nrealistically as possible that would\nactually cause you to feel confident and\npoised and you can focus your mind's eye\non that memory or fantasy as intensely\nas possible\nif you can do this you can move through\nexternal reality while remaining focused\non your internal imagination\nand this will help you to act\nauthentically\nand authentically confident in an\nimaginary situation\nnow you might respond well that's all\nwell and good for an imaginary situation\nOrion but a bar is the real world\nand I would counter\nare you sure\nlike yeah the bar exists in objective\nreality however if you examine yourself\nvery carefully you'll find that you have\na whole host of beliefs about who you\nare and where you are and what's going\non that do not exist in objective\nreality you might even be scripting\nlike it like a playwright the the\npotential encounter in your imagination\nmy point is that if you have approached\nanxiety you're already doing what I\ndescribed you're moving through external\nreality while remaining focused on an\ninternal fantasy it's just that your\ninternal fantasy is negative and anxiety\nprovoking so you already know how to do\nwhat I'm prescribing and if you change\nthe fantasy you can change how you feel\none final note one of my acting teachers\nonce taught me that whatever I needed to\nthink in the privacy of my own\nConsciousness whatever memory I needed\nto evoke or fantasy I needed to\nelaborate in order to produce that\nauthentic emotional response was\nnobody's business\nso whatever works for you is for you and\nyou alone so have fun and go for it\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider becoming a channel member\nwith perks like
