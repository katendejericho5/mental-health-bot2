    "transcript": "with long-term Partners it's easy to\nfall into the fallacy that you know\neverything about that's because you've\nheard all their stories sometimes many\nmany times over and you might be in\nconstant communication throughout the\nday so when you actually come together\nin the evening you might suffer from the\nbelief that they're a completely known\nentity which won't Inspire any interest\nlet alone curiosity by being spontaneous\nunpredictable and dare I say it selfish\nyou cultivate an island of novelty in\nthe midst of a well-known Sea by\ndisrupting my expectations I pay\nattention in paying attention I notice a\nchange in noticing a change I become\ncurious and in frustrating my curiosity\nI become interested that interest\nmotivates me to close the distance that\nyou intentionally created and to confirm\na bond that you intentionally made just\nslightly more tenuous throw in the\nsuspicion of another woman or another\nman and voila you've got yourself a\nrecipe for passion"
