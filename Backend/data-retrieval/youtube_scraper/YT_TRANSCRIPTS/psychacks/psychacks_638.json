    "transcript": "hello this is Orion taraban and this is\ncycax Better Living Through psychology\nand I'm very excited to have on the\npodcast today Mr Ken Curry Ken has been\na personal friend of mine for several\nyears he is like me a therapist who\nspecializes in men's mental health he's\nbased out of the state of Colorado\nand uh we got in touch with each other\nseveral years ago when\nI was trying to build a directory of\ntherapists who specialized in men's\nmental health and because there are few\nand far between I don't know if there's\nanyone else in the state of California\nthat I'm personally aware of who does\nwhat we do and I was interested in\nfinding a professional Network because I\nwas getting interest from men all over\nthe country who wanted to work with me\nbut unfortunately due to licensing\nrestrictions I couldn't do Psychotherapy\nwith people who lived outside of the\nstate so I was trying to find other\nfolks that I could refer these\ninterested men to as well as just build\na professional Network\num\nyou know just to swap stories and and\nprofessional and personal support and\nand Ken's been great with respect to\nthat he's he's been a good friend\nand I'm very happy to have you on the\npodcast today Ken thanks for being here\nthank you Orion much appreciated thanks\nfor the invitation for sure of course\nwell um I think it might be since I\nbegan the conversation by talking about\nour work in the context of men's mental\nhealth I think you have a is it right to\ncall a program it's called the solid man\nand you've written a number of books and\nyou you guide men through it like a\nprocess is that is that what to say yeah\nthat's it about this sure sure let me\nsay a couple things about\num my let's see my license in Colorado\nis lmft licensed marriage and family\ntherapist and I really took that and\nstarted working with men years ago that\nbecame something that was a passion of\nmine mostly because of my own internal\nwork and the things that I was working\non for myself and so as I started to\ndevelop my groups for men I started to\ndevelop a curriculum to help guys walk\nthrough life and really building\num a really solid sense of self of\nidentity the strength confidence really\nhelping men to have a much more\nsignificant presence in their life and\nso that was some what I started building\nwas the my curriculum to develop and\nhelp men to become\num I call it I Empower men and some\npeople don't like the idea of empowering\nmen but that's what I do and so the\nsolid man process definitely is designed\nto help men move from point A to point B\nfrom a point where I'm not really strong\nI don't really know who I am\nI don't really have a lot of confidence\nI might be embroiled in a number of\ndifferent\num addictions maybe porn alcohol other\nthings that guys just get stuck in and\nso really helping men kind of build a\nlife that is strong and really building\ntheir relationships so so that's what\nI've developed and let's see I have my\nwebsite is called solidman.com and\num and yeah you're right I have a few\nbooks\num a little bit later in the episode but\nokay what I heard right now is that you\nyour system sort of evolved organically\nover the years of working with hundreds\nor thousands of guys and you kind of\ncodified it into\num a system to guide people from feeling\nlost or unsure of themselves to having a\nstrong sense of self-purpose and\nconfidence is that a good summary there\nyeah that's a great summary yep and\nyou've been doing this for a while\nyeah I'm over a decade about 15 years\nall right now that's interesting have\nyou noticed that the presentation of the\nmen that you've worked with has changed\nover that time and if so what do you\nthink might be some of the\nthe the most\nprevalent issues facing men today\nthat's a okay that's a really good\nquestion so the um let's see one of the\nmost profound uh guys that I've been\nworking with is Dr Robert Glover and his\nNo More Mr Nice Guy work and so he\nreally outlines what I think is a really\nsignificant part of the problem and that\nis the whole idea of a man being nice\nand so it's really interesting his book\nis like 20 years old and it's only\ngetting more steam so it's like you you\nsee the the problem of men being nice\nguys\num and it feels like that it's been\nsomething that's been culturally\nprogrammed into men to be more\nsubmissive to be more\num wanting to make their women happy you\nknow the whole happy wife happy life\nthing that that's kind of been the thing\nthat has been told men if you do these\nthings and\num then life is going to be good for you\nit's going to work and the problem is\nthat most guys have been finding out\nthat that is not the case it is like the\nopposite\num where it's like it creates more\nproblems than they could ever imagine\nbeing this nice submissive man and and\nmaking other people happy being a\npleaser or an appeaser living for\napproval that type of thing\nand so that's been what I've been seeing\nas a really significant problem\num for me I kind of take Glover's stuff\na little bit further and I Define it as\nthe problem is is the externally\nreferenced life that a man living in uh\nexternally where I live to please I want\npeople to be happy with me I live to\nwhat everybody's else's expectations are\nand when I live like that I'm living\nalways thinking about what does\neverybody else think what does everybody\nelse want and and I'm living to make\nthose things happen and to get the\nvalidation that I need instead of what I\nthink is where I take guys is building\nan internally referenced life where I'm\nI'm living to please myself I'm living\nto make me happy which initially for\nmost guys sounds really horribly selfish\nand it's a really tough thing to get\nover to be able to think about you know\noh my gosh that's selfish I'm living to\nplease myself because it's the opposite\nof what I've been conditioned to do to\nmake everybody else happy and so that's\nbeen a really really big shift I help\nguys to make that shift and when you\nbecome more internally referenced you're\nfinding out who you really are find out\nwhat's valuable to you what are your\nvalues where does your value and\nself-worth actually come from as an\nindividual as a person and really being\nable to identify what are my internal\nresources telling me about how to move\nthrough life and those internal\nresources like my body my intuition my\nmind the things I see as as wise what's\nimportant to me what are my values my\nemotions which really tell you what I\nwant and need in life and all the stuff\ninside of me guiding me and it actually\ncreates a really really significant life\nwhen you start to live from an internal\nPlace rather than external does that all\nmake sense yeah there's a lot there so I\nI read Glover's book a while ago and I\nthink that's an excellent text for a lot\nof guys to read Because from my\nexperience it put something that I was\nsort of dimly or partially aware of into\na very concrete and explicit you know\nframework that was easy to understand it\njust sort of sharpened a lot of things I\nkind of knew into a Starker Focus yeah\num so I could see them better and I\nthink that the nice guy syndrome as I\nunderstand it is summarized by like the\nCobra contract which says that I can\nearn love and respect sex and\nrelationship but I do it indirectly by\nperforming acts of service that may not\neven be wanted or required right in the\nhopes that I could potentially further\ndown the road get what I want\num or indirectly\nand uh yeah I think that it's important\nfor guys to be able to be selfish to say\nthis is who I am and this is what I want\nin the beginning it is extremely\ndifficult for them to do that and I do\nthink that in the beginning that\nselfishness can take a more\nlet's say childish or hedonistic tone\nwhere it's like you know I feel like\nhaving a steak I'm just gonna have a\nsteak where I feel like playing video\ngames I'm just gonna do it I I'm it's\nalmost like a regression back to the\nlast time when they were assertive about\ntheir wants which is generally children\ngenerally or children are very assertive\nabout what they want and what they don't\nwant but what I found is that most\npeople can't stay at that level for very\nlong like if there's only so many beers\nyou can drink there's only so many video\ngames that you can play and then you you\nstart to think well selfishly I want to\ndo something more meaningful or I want\nto challenge myself and I think in the\nprocess of that you create greater value\nfor yourself and and your life and then\nyou get to a point where well selfishly\nI want to share this with other people\nbecause my joy will be increased if I\ncan share my goodness with other people\nand then invite people into your life\nwho want to be there as opposed to\ntrying to drag them in you can kind of\njust who I am this is what I what I'm\nall about would you like to join me and\nthen you can be surrounded by women and\nfriends and colleagues and things like\nthat and but that's still kind of with\non some level from a place of\nselfishness it's that I've decided that\nout of\nfor my own pleasure I am going to give\nas opposed to I'm giving from\nin the hopes that I can barter for\nsomething that I don't yet have does\nthat make sense no you see in the border\nthat you don't yet have that would be\nthe covert contract exactly yeah yeah I\ndon't yet have that sense of\nlove or respect in my life so I'm going\nto trade it for money attention service\nbut I feel like I have abundance in my\nlife I don't really have to trade\nabundance for more abundance you know I\ncan I can just right give it because\nit's my pleasure to do so\nokay I think the um the initial thing\nyou're talking about the childish\num selfishness really I think initially\nit comes out where you're now testing\nyour ability to say what do I want\nbecause most guys because they've been\nso externally referenced they don't know\nwhat they want they have never exercised\nthat muscle what do I really want and\nthat's what it comes down to what do I\nreally want because initially they might\npursue some things okay now I have\npermission to pursue what I want and\nthey're pursuing things that aren't\nnecessarily the most healthiest things\nand so I'll get i'll I want to play\nvideo games or I want to do this you\nknow and you start exercising it but\nyou're pursuing things that aren't\nnecessarily the the like I said the\nhealthiest things they might be\ncounterfeits sure what what really is\ngoing to bring that that level of\npurpose or fulfillment\ngo ahead no go ahead well the way that I\nthink about that is that we're always in\na process of becoming we don't ever\nreally know who we are right now we know\nwho we have been in the past and unless\nwe check in with ourselves on a regular\nbasis the gap between who we are now and\nwho we\nthink we are it might be years or even\ndecades and if somebody has spent his\nmost of his adult life\num chasing external validation the last\ntime he might have been sure of what he\nwanted was childhood and so he's running\nlike an outdated OS and he goes back to\nthe sources of pleasure and satisfaction\nwhen he was last most certain of them\num and what's interesting is they\nprobably don't provide the joint\nsatisfaction they once did and then the\nman can sometimes feel like he's\ndepressed that he's lost that even the\nthings that once provided him Joy no\nlonger do so but that could be\nappropriate the things that bring us joy\nand satisfaction when we're 12 shouldn't\nbe the things that bring us joy and\nsatisfaction when we're\n22 let alone 42. so sometimes if it's\nbeen a while because of the busyness of\nlife or because of one's attitudes\ntowards others I think it's important to\nenter into a period of like open-minded\nexperimentation where you go out into\nthe life go out into life and say well I\nactually don't know what I like I\nactually don't know what I want\nlet's try things\nand not have any contempt prior to\ninvestigation so that I can see how\nthese different experiences actually\nfeel for me how they resonate and I can\nlearn from that emotional response who I\nam now what I like now what I want now a\nlot of the guys that I work with when we\nstart working they don't know what they\nwant\nbut generally people know what they\ndon't want it's it's generally easier to\nknow what you don't want so if you don't\nyet know what you want\num listeners it's sometimes better to\nstart with what you don't and walk in\nthe opposite direction for a while\num because I I definitely like what\nyou're saying Orion you're bringing up\nthe to two big questions and in Family\nTherapy it's the uh differentiation\nquestions and differentiation being the\nfancy word for being able to be my own\nself in my own life or in a relationship\nwhere I don't lose my sense of self or\nI'm not on my my person is not absorbed\nor lost in the relationship and that's\nthe differentiation and the those the\nquestions are who am I what do I want\nand most guys they don't know the answer\nto those two questions like we're saying\nand so being able to ask who am I and\nwhat do I want like you said it's a\njourney I'm gonna find out who I am what\nI want and that puts me in a position\nonce I start even asking those questions\nwhere I can like be I can start to\nactually become myself finally in my own\nlife because I've I have allowed myself\nto be a absorbed or lost in the\nrelationship and that is a really\npowerful thing just to be able to start\nasking those two questions and because\nthe who am I questioned the identity\nquestion who am I what's my character\nwhat's my value what's my worth most\npeople are just drenched in shame shame\nbeing that thing says something's wrong\nwith me or I'm defective I'm not good\nenough and when you start to develop\nthat where I am okay I'm not perfect but\nI'm okay\nthen I can start to trust what's going\non inside of me and trust my um the\nthings that I want and I love what\nyou're saying because it is a process of\nlearning what is it that I really want\nand as I started you kind of pro you\nkind of outlined that where finally I'm\nstarting to I want people in my life to\nthrive I want my family to be loved I\nwant you know those things are things\nthat I want that are incredible for\neverybody who's involved and that that's\nwhat I find with most guys you know we\nwe hear all the toxic masculinity stuff\nand everything that that if a man was\nempowered he would be oppressive and\nthat narrative is just so wrong and so\noff base because every guy I run into\nwhen they start to actually be\nthemselves and live according to what\nthey want they're actually wanting\neverybody else in their life their\nfamily their wives their girlfriends\ntheir friends everybody to thrive I want\neverybody to be doing well\nI think that's very common and maybe\nwhat we can uh postulate here is that\nthe the more like say elevated the self\nthe more that\nselfishness includes the well-being of\nthose around him that kind of makes\nsense it's like if I were living with a\nwoman I would want her\num to be doing really well because I\nwould have to be in her space a lot of\nthe time so even if it was just out of a\nselfish desire for peace and Harmony I\nwould want her to be thriving\nand the more\nabundant and the more secure I am in my\nsense of self the more that\nI can see that I'm\npart of an expanding web of\nrelationships that stretch out into my\nfamily into my co-workers into my\ncommunity and potentially even to\nhumanity as a whole and selfishly I mean\nno man is an island right so the highest\nthe highest Perfection of self requires\nthe elevation of actually the rest of\nhumanity in order\num\nperfected and sustained so I think\nthat's the that's like selfishness\nat its highest level and not everybody\nis there yet and that's totally fine\nmaybe we're all stumbling in that\ndirection no but it's so interesting\nit's so interesting that everybody\npretty much across the board when they\nhear the word selfish it's like it's\nit's a totally negative connotation I\ncan't be selfish so I kind of I'll joke\nand use the word self-ness okay if\nselfish isn't right yes let's go\nself-ness you know but the but it's the\nthe idea that what you're talking about\nis there is something about a a noble\naspect of selfishness and that that\nsounds unheard of that's not something\npeople talk about I I I'm a big fan of\nselfishness especially in relationships\none of the things I counsel men to do is\nis to find someone with compatible\nselfishnesses because the alternative is\nlike a lifetime of compromise which is\noften two people not getting what they\nwant and often keeping score of\nlike goods for went or debts incurred\nso it's like if I'm the kind of guy who\nneeds a lot of space for my own kind of\npeace of mind or well-being then it kind\nof makes sense for me to find somebody\nwho also needs somebody who is more\nindependent because that selfishly works\nfor her and so we have compatible\nselfishnesses you see I do and the other\ncategory that I that I that I enjoy\nselfishness or coach guys to engage in\nselfishness is the category that I said\nearlier that usually\num most men and this isn't men women do\nit as well the whole idea of losing\nmyself being absorbed into the\nrelationship and and having a sense of\nself and selfishness actually is me\nbeing me in the relationship it feels\nlike the most absurd statement that I\nhave is when I when I ask guys I tell\nguys you need to be you in your own in\nyour own life and it's like\num because they have haven't been\nthemselves in their own life I am\nsomebody who I'm supposed to be or I'm\nplaying a role that other people want\nyou to be rather than being myself or\nwho I am at my core and moving forward\ninto my life with my own identity when\nwith what I want and need in my life\nso yeah well we talked what was the word\nyou used from family therapy it was\ndifferentiation differentiation okay so\nthis is something that seems to be a\npretty ubiquitous issue especially in\nlong-term relationships or marriage it\nused to be that a man's house was his\ncastle now at best it seems like he has\na man cave or a garage and the house has\nbeen sort of taken over by the women uh\nthe decorations are all what the women\nuh decide throw pillows everywhere sure\nand we've heard the phrase like\nbetatization by 10 000 concessions uh it\ndidn't seem to be this way you know two\ngenerations ago I wasn't there but it\ndoesn't seem that way from looking at my\ngrandparents lives and the media from\nthat time men would just say up I'm\ngoing out for war or I'm a traveling\nsalesman I'll be back in six months\num\nthey certainly\ndidn't seem to feel like they were the\ndoilies everywhere\num in the house what what's going on\nlike is it because I also made this\nvideo recently about how feminine love\nis different from masculine love and and\nkind of a a woman in love it's more\nconsumptive like if it if it could it\nwould want all of your love and all of\nyour attention and know all of your\nthoughts and and how do you\num how do you have that differentiation\nover 40 years when there's this like\nmaybe a relentless\nForce like a tide that's just sort of\nslowly\nalways kind of wanting a little bit more\ndo you understand what I'm saying yeah I\ndo I do you use the word consumptive\nI'll use the word absorptive that it's\nabsorption\num that's the the concept that I use\nit's the same exact thing where where\nI'm being consumed I'm being absorbed\ninto her world\nand the whole thing of the the house\nbeing\num it's so interesting that you're\nsaying this Orion because I you know\nthat I recently done have done a massive\nmy front room kitchen area remodel right\nand so the whole thing of how how we've\ngone through the process of being able\nto pick and choose what we're doing and\nand all this and how how some things\nI've had a voice some things I've been\nlike nah you just choose what you what\nyou want\num and so it's been but I I'm really\nreally happy with our front room and our\nkitchen area and everything I'm way\nhappy with how it is because it's mine\nbecause mostly I built it I didn't build\nthe cabinets but I put them in and put\nthe flooring in it did all the did\neverything\num not everything almost pretty much at\nall but the whole thing of what you're\ntalking about more than\nthe decorations is do I lose myself and\nin a way and we uh you know a lot of the\nconversation is the whole idea of the\neye of frame my frame as a man and when\nI walk into my house do I lose my frame\ndo I turn into a little submissive boy\nand mom can tell me everything about\nwhat's going on in the house and there's\na lot of guys that have that as a\ncomponent that at work they have framed\nthey they've hire and fire and they\nbuild things and they do things but when\nthey get home they have a completely\ndifferent posture that's certainly true\nsome guys can be very submissive\nrelative to their women in in the most\nof the relationships that I personally\nsee the woman is the more powerful party\nin the relationship\num but I also see I mean what do you\nthink about the idea of more egalitarian\nrelationships can a man maintain frame\nwithin that kind of belief structure or\nis that sort of a slippery slope down\ntowards concessions help me um tell me\nwhat you believe the egalitarian to be\nsure I think that the egalitarian model\nof relationships is that we're partners\nand we're go we're making like we have\nequal decision making power we share the\nchild care we share the chores we split\nthe bills and\num no one person is the boss of the\nother person no one person has more\npower than the other\nand is it possible to maintain frame in\nthat situation that's a great question\num I'm just thinking about the the\num\nmy answer I'm gosh this is really hard\nbecause I don't have a problem with each\nperson having a lot of power in the\nrelationship\num I think being a power couple is\nactually what you want to seek where\nboth people are really significantly\nstrong individuals where they're\nstanding on their own two feet where\nthey're they're developing their own\npurposes where they're creating a\nrelationship where everybody in the\nrelationship is empowered\num the whole idea of power couple is\nsomething that my wife and I have been\nseeking and and so\num so being able to make sure\neverybody's powerful but that doesn't\nnecessarily fit the egalitarian model\nbecause when it comes down to it\num\ngosh this is this is really hard for me\nbecause I don't know why it's really\ntough for me right now even talking\nabout it because it's like what I have\ngoing on I have a really strong frame I\nknow who I am I know what I want and I\nhave a really strong presence in my\nrelationship but that strong presence\nthat I've had in the relationship has\nalso empowered my wife to be really\nstrong as well and for her to be able to\ndevelop her career she's developed since\nthe kids have been out of the house\nsince we're empty nests she has created\na really really significant career it's\nbeen awesome to see and so I that but\nwhen it comes to your question I'm\ntrying to think of what is it that that\nyou're asking okay let me try again yeah\nI think you brought up an interesting\npoint which is that power isn't\nnecessarily a zero-sum game it's not you\njust because one person is more powerful\ndoesn't mean the other person is\nnecessarily weakened and that both a man\nand a woman in a relationship can be\npowerful\nin that relationship\nthe egalitarian model is\num I think based on\nit's not how do I put it how do I\nexperience it there can I can I jump in\nOrion because I think when you said Zero\nSum I think that's the that's the game\nbecause the zero sum is is that one\nlet's see plus one minus one equals zero\nand so what it is is the plus one is the\nperson with the power the minus one is a\nperson without the power and it's the\nZero Sum right and so I think that's the\ngame that most egalitarians play the\nwhole idea of one person has the power\nthe other doesn't even though you've\nsaid the whole thing of you know we're\nboth equal in this but I think when it\nreally comes down to it most people in\nthat world play a zero-sum power game or\nthey're it's like they're all fighting\nfor fifty percent and am I going to get\n51 or am I at 49 and what I'm describing\nis what I call Abundant power where it's\nnot a zero sum there's not fifty percent\nthat you're fighting over there's\nmassive amounts of power that everybody\nhas at their disposal and so as a man I\nam a powerful man and that's why I want\nto empower men but it's not to have\npower over anybody it's I want my power\nfor I want Power like I was saying I've\nempowered my wife my power as a man has\nempowered her to become the strongest\nperson that she can become and her\nbecoming powerful doesn't diminish my\npower at all as a matter of fact it\nempowers me even more to be able to do\nthis so both of our the power couple\nthere's no Zero Sum it's like we're both\nbecoming more powerful and more powerful\nas the years go by\ndoes that all make sense yeah I think so\nI I do think that a lot of the\nTendencies towards egalitarianism in\nrelationships grow out of a discomfort\nwith power and the idea here is that if\nit's perfectly matched 50 50 we can sort\nof eliminate the influence of power in\nour relationships because the idea of\npower and\nuh makes me uncomfortable so I'd rather\nbalance it out so that we can pretend\nthat it doesn't exist\nbut as we've just been describing I\ndon't we it sounds like we agree that\npower isn't necessarily a zero-sum game\nanother dimension of the egalitarian\nrelationships that I see is like the\nneed to discuss everything it's like\num there is there's less of a no we're\ngonna we're gonna put this flooring in\non the kitchen or even I'm gonna take\nTuesday off to go fishing it's more like\nwhat do you let's talk about the floors\nlet's talk about the Tuesday night what\nare we gonna do for dinner and it's\nalways arriving at a consensus\nI think that's a also another feature of\na lot of egalitarian models is that we\nwe do everything together and we make\ndecisions jointly in as many different\ndomains as possible\nand is that like a seating of frame to\nbehave in that way\nsuch a great question so I think the\ncategory of like you were saying I'm\ngoing to go fishing on Tuesday I'm not\ngoing to ask permission but since I'm in\na relationship I might ask you know does\nthat does that uh did we have anything\nelse planned on Tuesday you know or was\nthere something else I might ask is\nthere something going on because there's\nthree entities here that we're talking\nabout there's me my wife and the\nrelationship the marriage it's a it's an\nentity we've created something a being\nthat actually exists and it's something\nthat we take care of and that we grow\nand that we develop and so so some\nthings are all about me I'm gonna go\nfishing on Tuesday some things are all\nabout her she's gonna go do this and\nthat and do whatever she needs to do but\nthen there are a significant amount of\nthings that we do as a couple and and\nthat when you when you you're kind of\nbringing up the whole idea of conceding\nand the answer is yes there are some\ntimes when I would concede what I want\nor when I want it to be able to do\nsomething as a couple\num\nI don't know if that's answering your\nquestion\nI think I think so I think you're saying\nthat yeah sometimes it's\nuh well to enter into that\nMutual deliberation is a seating a frame\nbut what's more it sounds like you're\nsaying that sometimes that is\nappropriate to do yeah it is so so the\nseeding of frame would be or let's say\nmaking a personal sacrifice\nI'm making a personal sacrifice to not\ngo fishing on Tuesday because we had\nsomething else planned or there were\nthere was\num who knows what else I have nothing's\ncoming to mind of what if it's not\nsomething else planned but she just\ndoesn't want you to go she thought maybe\nyou know she's going to be sad being all\nalone or that she'd rather just cuddle\non the couch with you\noh well that that I would not submit to\nbecause she'll get enough cuddling and\nthe thing is most most people most women\nunderstand if they have that thing where\nthey feel like oh my gosh he's not\nspending time with me most women will\nwill they'll say if my husband goes out\nand spends a day fishing he comes back a\nmuch more energized loving individual\nhe's coming back more\num yeah energized or or his tank is now\nfull because if he stayed home and just\nwatched some chick flick or The Bachelor\non TV while he's snuggling on the couch\nhe's losing his soul his soul is\nshriveling and just dying but if he's\nout fishing or doing something he loves\nto do he's going to come back a much\nmore energetic man and that's what she\nwants I want you to be present with me\nand so that's not something you can\nconcede and so to be present\nwomen might need to appreciate that men\nneed to be absent for a while absolutely\nman this is the you know Esther perel's\nthing that's the she's saying in order\nfor passion to happen you need space the\nwhole she uses the the fire triangle\nillustration the if you smother all the\nboards together and try to build build a\nfire there's no fire\nbut if you put it a TP and it has space\nin it and has all the space for the air\nto flow through it grows a beautiful\nfire and so it's primarily the man's\nresponsibility to maintain that space in\nthe relationship especially in light of\nwhat we are describing as women's\ntendency towards absorptive or\nconsumptive love\nI think so\num it all depends\num my wife does a great job with with\nher own time with me being off because\nwe have really good times when we're\ntogether but the thing is I think to the\npoint that we're making because we have\na significant amount of space where\nwe're doing our own thing that that we\nhave\num\nthat the times when we are together are\nreally quality times and so I think the\nbut you're kind of talking about that\num potentially the woman's gatekeeper or\nthe relationship the man's kind of the\ngatekeeper of the space or something\nlike that maybe\nit's it's always fallen to me to\nmaintain that space and what it seems to\nme is that the longer I'm in a\nrelationship the more the woman wants to\nget closer and closer and and decrease\nthe intervals in that absence and to\num you know join more and more together\nand that's the tendency in the woman and\nI have to kind of consciously and\nintentionally put the brakes on create\nsome space and distance I'm a huge fan\nof less frequent but higher quality\ninteractions and I had that conversation\nrecently\num I think that is\npreferable for me to have that kind of\nlow quality constant togetherness that\nisn't that's just sort of like\nexisting in the same room a long time\nago I cohabitated with a woman and after\nsix months I felt like I was Furniture\nto her like she would just walk right\npast me without looking at me and she'd\nbe sitting next to me on her phone\nand I just felt schmuckey in that\nsituation to be honest so I prefer\nwhen I'm with somebody to give them my\nfull undivided attention I kind of\nexpect that from them as well\nand if we can't do that for whatever\nreason because we're not interested or\nwe're preoccupied or we're busy to just\ntable that until such times when that is\npossible\num but the the pushback from that is\ngenerally like well I kind of like the\ncoziness I like being around even if\nwe're not interacting even if it's not\nthat level of relating I still like to\nbe around I still like to be with you\nI've seen that more from the women in my\nlife\ndoes that make sense Ken it does it\ntotally makes sense\num it\nI'm just not sure there there may be\nreasons why that is I'm not sure exactly\nwhy\num but the kind of one of the concepts\nthat I that I\num that I think is really at play here\num we hear a ton about attachment theory\nSure and attachment Theory I think has\nreally come from a more of a feminine\nside of therapy where it comes from\nmothers and their children literally\nmuch right that's that's the research\nthat's the it's based on right right and\nso what we're talking about and I think\nwe could probably go forward with\nwriting a whole book and a whole nother\nTheory and from a masculine side of it\nis Detachment Theory\nright but that's what we're talking\nabout Orion how do I walk through life\nas a as a man who stands on his own two\nfeet this is something that I've said\nfrom the beginning of our conversation\nthe whole idea of being an empowered man\nwho knows who he is and knows what he\nwants\nand I'm standing on my own two feet I\ndon't need you in my life now see the\nwhole thing of the the you complete me\nBS and chick flicks and all that it's\nall romantic and everything and it\nsounds good but it's ridiculous\nrelationship Concepts where if I need\nyou in my life to complete me and make\nme feel better about myself then the\nrelationship is going to falter horribly\nand so the whole thing of if I am\ndetached from you and I am a whole and\ncomplete human being where I'm okay by\nmyself the whole differential\ndifferentiation piece I'm okay by myself\nI don't need you now I can actually say\nI want you in my life and I invite you\ninto my life not as something to fill\nthe void in my Identity or make me feel\nwhole and complete but I'm inviting you\nyou in my life as somebody who is a\ncompliment to my life or somebody who is\na partner in my life\nbut I'm not inviting you in to resolve\nmy internal conflicts oh certainly I\nlove the Detachment Theory idea because\nI'm thinking about all the philosophies\nthroughout my life that have really\nresonated with me like um Mystic\nChristianity to be in the world but not\nof the world or Buddhism the path of\nrenunciation or stoicism where you're\npracticing a difference towards\nexternals and it seems like that from\nmany different sources of wisdom\nis the path that has been prescribed for\nhuman beings to walk in order to achieve\nLiberation from suffering and to arrive\nat the highest forms of existence on\nthis planet\nis Detachment not attachment but\nDetachment isn't that interesting it's\nvery fascinating I don't think I've made\nthat connection I love Detachment Theory\nhopefully you can elaborate that\nwell think about think about it with\nrelationship so if I back to the\nabsorbed consumptive if I allow myself\nto be absorbed into the relationship and\ntrust me this is what most men do who\nhave a really problem with a strong\nproblem with relationship I'm absorbing\nmyself I'm allowing myself to be lost in\nthe relationship because you are the one\nthat's going to make me feel better\nyou're going to give me that external\nvalidation so I'm going to lose my\nidentity lose my wants and needs and I'm\ngoing to pursue you to be able to Grant\non me or confer on to me my value and\nworth that's what's called a reflected\nsense of self and so that's what we\nusually do that is a really I mean\nthat's that's a really unhealthy\nattachment but it's seeking the\nattachment for being able to resolve\nlike I said my internal conflicts of not\nfeeling good about myself or not being\nfeeling whole or complete and so the\nwhole idea of being detached and a\nseparate human being standing on my own\nfeet is actually a powerful relational\nconstruct it's huge it's really really\nbig because then that allows me now to\nhave a really healthy relationship okay\nso let's take a slightly different Tech\nbecause I'm I'm okay this conversation\nthrough the yeah\nI can see it working in there some of my\naudience so\nwe talked a little bit ago about\num some of the modern challenges that\nyou see facing men and we talked about\nthe nice guy syndrome and this idea to\nto people please women to to forego our\nown values or needs in the indirect\nexpectation of getting sex a\nrelationship\num I think that definitely exists what\nI'm seeing more and more of in recent\nyears especially online is\nI'm not even going to go to a\nrelationship\nuh it's more like the black pill stuff\nwhich is yes what's the point you've\ntalked a lot about bringing women in to\ncreate this sort of relationship you\ntold me right before this conversation\nyou recently celebrated your 39th\nwedding anniversary yep so I think a lot\nof guys are gonna some guys are gonna\nhear this and think yeah that sounds\ngood Ken but the risks are really high\nassociated with that they certainly\nwhile there might be some benefits they\ndon't seem to outweigh the costs or the\nliabilities of that kind of relationship\num and it just doesn't seem worth it\nbecause I might be able to get those\nthings elsewhere at lower cost and for\nLess risk do you have any response to\nsomething like that I totally agree\nyeah\nour day\nour day and age\nI'm telling you like the whole thing of\nlike you know what 75 of divorces are\ninitiated by women the every single week\nI am I personally am wrestling with\nprocessing things with guys who are\ngoing through the a really really\nhorrible court system that we have it is\nwretched it is so distorted that I it\npisses me off every week just how\nhorribly men are treated in our court\nsystem so the answer is yes it is high\nrisk it is horror it and yes I so here I\nam I I love the idea of marriage I think\nmarriage I've I've given my life to it\nmy studies to it\num everything I I think it's an amazing\nthing but I totally agree with the guys\nthat feel like this is a high too high\nof a risk it is and a really significant\nrisk oh absolutely because like you said\nthe majority of divorce initiated by\nwomen if there's children involved they\nthe family the courts almost always\nfavor the women men can be financially\ncastrated oh it's horrible divorce\num oftentimes men have spent the last 20\nyears of their lives spending half of\ntheir waking lives working their jobs\nand the other half of their waking lives\nattending to their wife and children so\nany friends have long since Fallen by\nthe wayside if they do have any kind of\nsocial activity it's generally through\nthe woman who orchestrates that so when\nthat falls apart the man is often left\nfeeling alone and isolated because he\nhasn't been attending to his own\npersonal relationships and male\nfriendships and that's also what causes\nreally\nnegative outcomes for men in the wake of\ndivorce but we're also talking about so\nthat all that is true yes so but here's\nhere's the other thing which is\nthe statistics look bad but you don't\nget involved you don't marry a statistic\nany given woman on a long enough time\nframe actually has a zero or 100 chance\nthat it will end in a divorce it's just\nlike in the aggregate the population\nlevel that we say it's like you know 55\nof marriage is one in divorce or\nsomething like that\nit's it's not just the um\nit's not just the risks on the\nstatistical level for me it's more like\nI've yet to see a relationship\nI've yet to see a marriage\nespecially looking at the man in that\nmarriage where I think wow I want what\nhe's having his life is better than my\nlife he gets to do things that I don't\nget to do\nhis happiness is greater than mine and I\nthink that is\nin conjunction with the known risks is\npart of like well what's kind of what's\nthe point here you know what I'm saying\nI do I do I'm just missing something and\nbecause relationships feel very\ndifferent on the inside than looking at\nthem from the outside for sure so let's\nyeah let's because the question you\nposted was more um and what the way I\nanswered agreeing with you yes it's a\nhigh risk right but think about how many\npeople do get married and um I think the\nthe the amount of marriages that end in\ndivorce if you don't count the second\nand third and fourth divorces it's like\n44 it's lower something like that that's\nstill pretty high it is it is it's way\nhigh but then if you think about it then\nif it's 44 that means 56 percent die or\nend in death\nright and so and that and one more thing\nto interject here which is that just\njust because\n56 of first marriages done in divorce\ndoesn't mean that they're happy\nsuccessful thriving relationships either\nso that that's really the question that\nyou're asking yeah right so if you do\nfind yourself or you do choose to be\nmarried how do you do this well and that\nand that's kind of goes back to our\nquestion of the Detachment or the whole\nidea of frame\nand for a man to be able to build frame\nframe is that idea like we're saying the\nmost powerful part of your frame you\nthink about it frame like a frame of a\nhouse you got the foundation that's\nbuilt on the rocks that and then on top\nof the foundation you got your base\nplate and your your studs in the top\nplate and you got your your headers and\nyou got your joists and you got the\nwhole all the wood and stuff that goes\ninto the house that creates a frame that\nnow this house is sturdy this house is\nnot going to fall apart this house has\nstructural Integrity it's not going to\nbreak that's what you want to be able to\ndevelop within yourself and one of the\nmost powerful components of that frame\nin a man is my identity my sense of\nself-worth my sense of value internally\nthat this is who I know that I am this\nis where my value and worth rest within\nme and it's that sense of confidence I\nknow who I am I know what I'm capable of\nand I'm able to hold that fast and firm\nwithin me and the other parts of me my\nIntegrity my sense of my values my moral\ncompass you know the um the categories\nof you know just let's see\num even creating a vision for my life\nand what I have for here's where I'm\ngoing in my life this is my frame this\nis what I'm holding together and so the\nthing is if I bring that into the\nmarriage and I have it this is actually\nthe thing that is very that confidence\nthat I know who I am and I'm not going\nto move I'm not going to break I'm not\ngoing to be shaken and fall apart\num that is the thing that's attractive\nto a woman and so maintaining that\nthroughout your marriage is a really\nsignificant part of being able to do\nthat relationship well and so that whole\nidea of maintaining that frame\nand not like we're saying not kind of\nsubmitting to this the how many what do\nyou call it um a Thousand Cuts of uh by\nget like giving in yeah concessions\nthat's what it was where I'm I concede\nhere and there sure we can do this or do\nthat that's part of being in a\nrelationship you know today she chooses\nwhat you know we go to Mexican food\ngreat tomorrow I'm gonna say we're going\nto Italian or whatever that's kind of\nhow give and take in a relationship but\nI can't I can't concede myself I can't\nlet myself my wants my desires my vision\num my moral compass to be allowed to\ndisintegrate in the relationship that's\nwhere the relationship is lost because\nif I'm lost the relationship's lost sure\num I hear that and I agree with a lot of\nwhat you're saying Ken I'm just going to\ntry to summarize what I think would be\nthe um the argument from this portion\nwhich is\nI I hear you can and I believe you so I\nbelieve that it might be possible to\nhave a successful marriage what that\nmeans is like creating a very strong\nfoundation and I like solidifying your\nidentity and developing some kind of\nframework to invite the women into and\nlearning how to maintain frame and\novercome the testing that necessarily\noccurs courtship and throughout the\nrelationship and having some sense of\ngame to keep the passion and interest\nalive\num and being able to potentially have\nthe resources to provide for a family\nand and and and and and and and and if\nyou do all of those things then you\nmight be able to have a successful\nmarriage do you and I think that the\nargument would be like how about we just\ndo something that has a higher chance of\nsuccess that is much easier to\naccomplish than going through these 10\nthings that could take decades to\ndevelop to minimize the risk of\nsomething that may not even work after\nall because you're not in control of the\nsituation once you get married you you\nsee a lot of your power\num because you yeah and we in Iran\nyou're not even talking about one of the\nmost important parts of this and that is\nvetting a really good woman exactly\nbecause that's another thing it's like a\nlot of the response that to that is like\nno if you you just you chose the wrong\nwoman well that could be true yeah no\none gets married think they're going to\nget divorced except maybe predatory\nwomen but\num yeah it's like yeah learn how to vet\na woman learn how to it's all the above\nthat you're saying it's like there's so\nmany things and then maybe if things\ndon't go sideways you might be able to\nhave a happy relationship it's like how\nabout we just go straight to I want to\nbe happy with fewer steps\nso it's like why go through all of this\ntrouble just to have a marriage\ndo you have a response to that\nwell part of what I'm saying is\num this is how you would have a great\nlife anyway\nokay I hear that I mean you cannot have\na good life if you're a single man\nwithout frame absolutely\nand so it doesn't matter what you choose\nas your life having a strong sense of\nself a strong a differentiated person\nthat doesn't absorb into all these other\nthings is what you want anyway so that\nwork is work you're gonna need to do no\nmatter what anyway I made a video about\nthis that hypergamy actually only\nindirectly benefits women be and it\ndirectly benefits men like to become a a\nstronger more solid higher net worth\nmore successful man how does that not\nbenefit the man in question and it can\nonly indirectly benefit the woman if the\nman chooses to share it with her so I'm\nwith you on that which is that these\nthings that make for a successful\nrelationship with a woman more directly\nand primarily benefit the men involved\nand so maybe Orion you know the whole\nidea of talking to the guys that maybe\nthey're mgtow guys and somebody who's\njust I'm not going to get married anyway\nthey know that that's the case and I'm\nfine with that make your choices do what\nyou want to do maybe more of what we're\ndoing is we're talking to Men Who find\nthemselves in a marriage that isn't\nwhere they want them to be it's not as\nhappy it's not as connected you know\nthey're they're maybe on the verge of\ndivorce and that type of thing and so\nbeing able to consider you know what\nchanges can I make in my life and rather\nthan working to say or having all the\nenergy I need to save my marriage to be\nable to say no I need to save my soul\nfirst I need to become the man that I\nreally want to be I need to get out of\nthe nice guy syndrome I need to become\nmore internally referenced and stop\nbeing externally referenced you know\ndoing the happy wife happy life thing\nwhich by the way if you turn that around\nit actually works the whole happy life\nhappy wife if a man has a happy life and\nhe has that frame and he's really Living\nWell actually the women are really happy\nwith that in general I think people also\nare about as happy as they choose to be\nand they're saying that choose not to be\nhappy I'm I'm just saying though if you\nflip it oh yeah I think that was clever\nI I appreciate that I think it's true\nit's true but then the whole thing of uh\none thing that Sean has told us is the\nwhole thing of if you're responsible for\nher happiness you're also responsible\nfor her unhappiness\nand that's a really tough Pitfall but\nthat that's just I'm using that as an\nillustration that living just changing\nthe mode the role that you have in your\nmarriage that I'm not living to make her\nhappy I'm not living to submit to her\nand to make everything work in her life\nto change and shift what's going on and\nchange them and moving into what we were\ncalling selfishness earlier where I'm\ngoing to be who I am I'm going to build\nmy frame I'm gonna build those things I\ntalked about that our frame and see\nwhere this goes okay so you you've\nmentioned in this conversation that yes\nour relationship does require some\nconcessions from time to time yep it\ndoes require some sacrifices it can be\nexpensive\num in terms of just resources broadly\ndefined of yep here you are 39 years\ninto your marriage like\nforeign\nwhat have you gotten from Marriage that\nyou feel you might not have gotten any\nother way even if you had done\neverything to consolidate your identity\ncreate frame for yourself pursue your\npurpose but you just never entered into\nthat kind of relationship with a woman\nwhat what does marriage uniquely give\nyou 39 years into that situation man\nIran I got to tell you I am one of I\nfeel incredibly fulfilled in my life\nit has been I have had a an amazing life\nI have a family who loves me I have\nthree adult children I have two\ngrandsons one's on the way in in October\nyou know the whole um I have a wife that\njust loves me I love her we are great\ncompanions we do a lot of fun things\ntogether we enjoy each other's company\num there's just a ton of love going\naround in my life for in a number of\ndifferent ways with my kids with my um\nin my marriage I just feel incredibly\nfulfilled it I just feel really really\ngood in my life\nwell one of the things that I have\nargued that fundamentally marriage is a\ninstitution to raise children absolutely\nand that's really where you went is that\num when I asked that question the answer\nthat I heard was like well it has\nallowed me to be surrounded by an ex you\nknow in multi-generational family\nthat is loving and warm and fulfilling\nsupportive yes everything yeah would it\nwould it be possible to have that\nwithout getting married or is married in\nyour mind a requisite for that\nwell to be able to raise kids like I\nthink kids need to be raised they need\nMom and Dad\nso if you're going to have kids\num\num there are people my my daughter's\nactually\num to your point the whole thing of can\nI have a group of people around me just\nloving and caring my daughter is not\nmarried and um she has created a really\nsignificant network of community around\nher she's done a great job she has so\nmany friends and she is surrounded by a\nlot of really lovely beautiful people\nand\num so she's done that I think it would\nbe possible to have a community around\nyou\num but as far as family you know I don't\nknow it might be more difficult to\nlogistically to navigate the\nco-parenting yeah is that kind of what\nyou're saying definitely with\nco-parenting for sure I yeah definitely\nto raise kids I think the ultimate is\nMom and Dad together for sure\nthat said I'm a child of divorce who is\na child of divorce himself and I often\nkind of shudder when I hear men say that\nthey're just staying in\nreally unhappy relationships for the\nkids\num maybe you can speak to that my my\npersonal and professional opinion on\nthis is that yes it's better to have an\nintact family to raise children\nbut if that intact family is chaotic\ndysfunctional and abusive it's better\nfor everyone involved to end that and\nsometimes divorce can be a step in the\nright direction you know what in some\ncases absolutely\nfor sure I I'm with you on that\num but it but the whole thing of um\nstaying together for the kids what do\nyou think about that staying together\nfor the kids if it's not abusive and\nchaotic like you're saying if it's\nsomething that we kind of have a cold\nburn or whatever and you're able to get\nit done\num\nman I I just don't know why people don't\nfight for the marriage don't fight for\nthe relationship and just don't don't\num you know and that's part of the whole\nthing of if I'm just if I've conceded so\nmuch that I just now have no voice and I\ncan't set a boundary and I can't say\nwhat I want or I don't have a vision or\nI can't lead to where I want it to go\nthen I'm not in the relationship well\nthis is interesting so why why wouldn't\nsomebody fight for the relationship I'm\nsure there's many many reasons for that\nbut since we know that the vast majority\nof divorces are initiated by women maybe\none of the reasons why I wouldn't fight\nfrom the relationship is that I feel\nthat I might be able to maintain my\nstandard of living in my lifestyle\nby separating and I wouldn't have to\ndeal with this person anymore maybe I'm\nalso hearing friends or going on social\nmedia and I have this fear of missing\nout maybe I feel like\num this is this is boring I could get\nmore exciting relationships elsewhere\nand\num\nin some kind of no skin off my back I\ncan walk away with a fat paycheck maybe\nthat's why some people wouldn't fight\nfor a relationship I imagine\nI I don't I don't know the the direction\nwhere we're going with this\num\nI'm not sure exactly\nI'm not sure exactly what the question\nis Iran or how you want to well you're\nreally getting that well you said just a\nfew minutes ago that you didn't know why\npeople didn't fight for their\nrelationships yes yes and I took that as\na non-ratorical question uh and I\nsuggested one reason why some people\nmight not fight for their relationships\nokay the reasons why someone wouldn't\nfight for their relationships well just\nthe one that I gave that they've\nconceded so much that they no longer\nhave a voice or think that they do have\na voice and I think that to me that's\nwhat most a lot of the guys that I that\nI work with that's kind of where they're\nat and so then my work is how do you\nwhen I talk about empowering men one of\nthe significant things is giving a man a\nvoice you know and it starts with what\nyou want and then how do you communicate\nwhat you want\num with your partner\nand and to be able to to have that as\nnow this is on the front burner I'm\nsaying what I want and then she can say\nwhat she wants as well but now actually\nwe're starting to say something we're\nstarting to start the conversation but\nif you're sitting back and the whole\nthing like you said earlier with the\ncovert contract I am seeking what I want\nbut I'm only doing it covertly with the\nkind of a passive way of trying to get\nwhat I want without communicating it\nthat's not going to get you anywhere and\nthat's what most guys do but starting to\nsay this is what I want you know this is\nhow I want to be treated this is where I\nwant the relationship to go most guys\ndon't even get to that spot where\nthey're actually talking about I don't\nthink women do either women just live by\nthese expectations if I feel you know\nwhatever you know the whole thing that\nyou know the line that women have the\nthe I love you but I'm not in love with\nyou so we're going to get a divorce it's\nlike yeah that's all about expectation\nand the the way to be able to Define\nthat statement you know oxyto ghost in\nyou but I don't dopamine you\nyou know it's like I'm bonded to you I\nlove you but I don't have this thrill\nanymore\nand and it's and it's like what is the\nexpectation that you have this thrill\nyour entire marriage all the time and\nthat's what some TV shows and everything\nportray it's kind of the mythology of\nrelationship and it's like and that if\nthat's what you're seeking It's Gonna\nFall Apart\n[Music]\num\nthat's a tough sell especially I think\nfor young people who want to do the fomo\nand go out and have all of the\nexperiences and the feelings uh that\nkind of more temperate companionate love\nis\nI don't think very interesting for\n20-somethings\nno because you know what when it really\ncomes down to it it's kind of boring\ntrue true love is boring is that weird\nto say that\nit's peaceful it's content it doesn't\nevery once in a while you get the\ndopamine hit but it's not constant\nit's a it's kind of it's more relaxed\nit's yeah\nyeah Alexander said more or less the\nsame thing and I do think that that is a\nsign of a healthy successful\nrelationship is some degree of\npeacefulness and harmony\nyeah\nbut that's a tough one because it does\nfeel like you have to put a part of\nyourself to bed\nactually I'm not sure yes maybe you do\nbut in um\nbut I think what you're doing is you're\nmaybe part of you is going to bed and it\nmight be that more immature part of you\nin a more mature part of you actually\nyou find that the peace and content and\nand Harmony actually is way more\nvaluable\nthan feeling the dopamine hit every once\nin a while all constantly you might be\nright I mean we're an interesting social\nmoment as you know the average age of\nfirst marriage continues to creep up and\nup and up right now it's around 30 in\nthe United States and I think a\ngeneration ago it was probably like 25\nand maybe two generations ago it was\ncloser to 22 means yeah right so\num and there is this Trope of like\nmidlife crises\nand I've thought about this phenomenon\nand I think that is a result of let's\nsay taking on premature maturity and\npotentially entering into a this type of\nrelationship or\nsocial obligation too soon without any\nkind of you know sowing of the Wild Oats\nor development of the sense of self and\nso the person gets to be middle-aged has\nthe first brush of mortality realizes\nhe's never lived for himself his entire\nlife and you know stereotypically has an\naffair with the secretary and buys a\nsports car or something like that now we\nkind of have the the opposite problem\nwhich is people are spending their\nentire 20s and sometimes their entire\n30s looking for themselves\num\npotentially that means that when they're\nfinally ready to settle down they might\nactually be able to do so for the long\nterm but it comes with other problems\nbecause of the mate selection process uh\nin the reproductive Windows as well but\nthat's that's an interesting idea do you\nfeel like people kind of need to get\nthat out of this their system\nuh before they can really settle down in\nthe way that you're described\nthat's a great question\num I don't think it's necessary it all\nthe the thing is it becomes a high value\nyou you said fomo you know am I missing\nout yeah um what is it that I really\nvalue do I value going off and doing all\nthese things that I can do as a single\nperson or do I really value I want to\nbuild a family and I want to I want to\nbuild a legacy and I want to build\nsomething or the other category that I\ndidn't bring up you know we were talking\nabout how marriage or relationship\nmarriage in particular builds is is\ndesigned for building a family raising\nkids right\num the other thing the other two things\nthat I think it it is designed for is\nit's going to grow us up toward maturity\nyou cannot do relationship without\nbecoming more mature it's going to force\nyou to learn something about yourself\nand to become a more mature individual\nand then the third thing is all about\nwell-being the relationship creates more\nwell-being it creates more support\nconnectedness\num uh security things like that that's\nwhat a relationship those that's what\nrelationship does but the whole idea of\nthe the building you up to become more\nmature is something that people don't\nunderstand that they enter into a\nrelationship because nobody tells us\nthis that it's designed to grow you up\ntoward maturity and so I think that's\nwhere everybody in a relationship\nwhether you're kicking and screaming or\nwhether you actually engage in the\nprocess you're gonna grow up you're\ngonna and that's gonna happen and so but\nthe whole what we're talking about is is\na single person if they go all the way\nto 35 and then they realize you know\nwhat it's time they haven't they've\nexperienced a lot but they really\nhaven't grown up\nand and and relationship grows you up\nbig time and it's and it is something\ngosh I don't know what what answer I'm\ngiving you I don't know what question\nI'm answering I think you answer the\nquestion what I heard is that\num it's not you don't believe that it's\nnecessary to kind of sell your Wild Oats\nbefore I don't admit to that um\nI don't know because it was back to the\nwhole idea of values do I value sowing\nyour Wild Oats I'm going if if I value\ngoing and have sex with multiple people\nis that a value is do I value going\npartying until the sun comes up is that\na value is do I value you know traveling\nall over the world maybe that's a value\nseeing new things and meeting new people\num or like I said do I value raising a\nfamily\nas a contrary position I'm reminded of\nuh a line from the data chain that I\nreally like which is\nto\nto make something contract you must\nfirst allow it to expand and that has\nbeen true in my own life that it's much\neasier for me to let go of certain\nthings and to grow when I feel like I've\nexhausted them\nthat's just me personally\num and I've\nI think that might be true for some\nother people as well uh that if they\ndon't do the thing that they really want\nto the extent that they want to do it\nand they might have a regret\nand it might\ninappropriately Cloud their present\nmoment because they're they're thinking\nabout the life that they\nweren't quite ready to give up but did\nfor some other reasons or Ryan could we\ncould we come to this conclusion that\nUncle like you and I have two totally\ndifferent trajectories in our lives\nright I got married when I was 23\num had just had my 39th anniversary of\ngrandkids you know it's like\num and your your life's moving in a\ndifferent direction so you're kind of\ngiving the what do you call it um uh\nyou're saying you're kind of given\nhere's what I think that the benefit of\nthat\num lifestyle would have been or is and\nand I want to be able to just respect\nboth and to be able to go both of those\ntrajectories are just fine what somebody\nchooses for their life\num does that make sense oh yeah that\nmakes sense to me certainly one of the\nthings that I\nuh that that might be difficult about\nthe institution of marriage is that it\nis kind of a one-size-fits-all thing I\nread a book recently\nabout I think\nuh it was a it was a West African\nsociety that had like 13 different legal\nand social forms of marriage and I\nthought that was a fascinating idea that\nwe can have different arrangements to\naccommodate the different needs of the\npop of the community as opposed to this\nis the way it has to be for everybody\nand it and it either\nworks or\nfails often spectacularly and it's\nfailing a lot even at 44 so\num I think that it's Different Strokes\nfor different folks and that we should\npotentially consider keeping a more open\nmind about the nature and structure of\nrelationships I I made an episode about\nthis a while back I think it's one thing\nthat Straits can learn from gays\nand that population who have never\nreally had traditional models of the way\nthat their relationships are supposed to\nlook like and so they're more or less\nforced to\num communicate exhaustively about the\nnature and structure of the relationship\nand ideally to Custom Tailor it to the\nindividuals in question\num and that it's really nobody else's\nbusiness what they do besides their own\nyeah\nyeah so okay yes and I think the way\nmarriages or straight relationships are\nlike this is how they are it is this is\nhow it is this is and that's what I'm\nsaying this is the expectation of it\nthis is how it starts this is how you do\nit you know all the the projection of\ndating and engagement and marriage I\nhave a wedding and your wedding goes\nlike this and then you live happily ever\nafter all the expectation and it's the\nsomeone it's how it's uh how it's\nmarketed and you think about how the\ndiamond industry is marketed you know oh\nyou have the diamond and you're going to\nbe somebody and here's where it goes and\nand all this and then you get you get\nhave the wedding and you're the princess\nand all this stuff happens and it's all\nit's all the same stuff with this\nexpectation of this is what the marriage\nis going to provide and that's the the\nwhole thing of the mythology I think\nmythology of the marriage where this is\nnot what it's going to provide and and I\nthink you've said this in your in your\num in some of your podcasts the whole\nthing of how marriage has transitioned I\nmean a hundred years ago it was\npredominantly for survival\nit was still about survival it's about\nyou connect with a person you have a\nfamily and it's about this is how we\nsurvive this is how we make things\nhappen and\num I mean it was just you couldn't do it\nalone you couldn't and and so it's the\nand so now in 100 years is not very long\nand it's not even been that it's\nprobably more like 50 years that it's\nreally shifted from that because you\nthink about coming out of the Korean War\nthe depression the World War II Korean\nWar it was all life was still really\nrough and and so just in within 50 years\nhere we we find ourselves in this\nabundant place where you know life is\nreally good and so we can afford to feel\nlike I want to have this in the\nrelationship or we don't need the other\nperson as much I think that across time\nand across culture it's like average\nnumber of children or birth rates are\npretty strongly correlated to like GDP\nand average annual incomes and the\nbetter the more prosperous the society\nthe lower the birth rate like period\nyeah we still see cultures today that\nare having uh you know on average\ncertainly more than two children\nbut their economies aren't nearly as\ngood so that's that's interesting maybe\nwe come together more out of necessity\nthan we would like to admit\nbut it's to your point of the thinking\nabout how would you have other\ncategories\nof a relationship of a marriage you know\nbecause it's not made for Survival\nanymore and some marriages aren't about\nraising children and some mer you know\nand I just yeah I don't know that's kind\nof got my head spinning and what would\nthat mean and everything but I think\nwhat it would look like go ahead yeah I\ndon't know I don't either but just\nthinking about\num at least being able to have it to\nwhere people understand this is what\nmarriage is\nand um because I I don't think people go\ninto it knowing what it really is ah so\nthat you're right they just to use your\nlanguage they just understand the\nmythology what it's supposed to be or\nwhat they think it's going to be because\nall they see is the weddings and the\nbridal gowns and the diamond rings and\nthe proposals and the gender reveals and\nall that stuff but we don't really have\ngood access to the everyday workings of\nuh even us any relationship any marriage\nthat a lot of successful marriage and so\npeople don't often know what they're\ngetting into and maybe that's part of\nthe reason why there's such a high\ndivorce rate and I think why women are\nthe ones that are initiating because\nthey're the ones that have been taught\nthat this is what the marriage is and\nnow they're in the marriage and the\nhoneymoon's over and we have kids and\nall of a sudden it's not as peachy as it\nwas once once was and it's not what\nthey've told me it was going to be\nbecause it's a lot harder than I\nimagined and and so then all of a sudden\nI'm not happy and so therefore I'm going\nto go ahead and file or whatever that\nmakes sense you know\nand and so\num is there a way to solve that problem\nokay\nI wish\nI wish there was a way I mean\nthere has to be something that can be\ndone uh hmm\nI don't know if you can like legislate\nthis but maybe one possible solution is\nuh\nis spending more time with your\nwith like the older generation maybe\npeople who have been married for at\nleast 10 years if not longer\num to kind of get a more accurate\nunderstanding of what's in store to\nactually have relationships beyond your\nage or generational cohort who can kind\nof tell you this is what you might be in\nfor this is what you might have to look\nforward to\nno it's not what you might have to this\nis what you're gonna the honeymoon will\nbe over because it isn't there has been\na decline in um and certainly the\nextended family and I think connected to\nthat is intergenerational friendships is\nthat most people's friends are within\nlike a couple years of them and that's\nwhat they know\nI think it's actually really useful to\nhave friends who are in an older\ngeneration absolutely younger men yep\nyep absolutely\nthat's a whole nother conversation Orion\nsure yeah we've already talked for a\nwhile so maybe we can do that another\ntime so um if people want to know more\nabout you Ken how could they get in\ntouch with you sure so my website is\nsolidman.com and so\num so Ken at solidman.com would be my\nemail and then uh and there's other ways\nto link into uh on the email on the\nwebsite as well and you can just see a\nlittle bit what I'm all about you can\npurchase my books online on Amazon just\ngo to Ken Curry lmft and uh I've got\nfour books on there which was my\ncurriculum for my men's groups just\nturned into books so if you want to work\nthrough that\num that's definitely an option there and\nI do have men's groups um that uh that I\nthat I have that are online so that\nwould be an option if any of you guys\nare looking for men's groups uh I know\nthat there are men out there who are so\nI I don't know if you have a lot of\nspace in your men's groups currently so\nlet's manage expectations do you have a\nwait list uh yeah\num I have three groups and two groups\nare full and so there's wait lists for\nthose and and it uh it takes a bit for\nan opening to come up but if you want to\nbe on the wait list you can the one\ngroup that's open is Wednesday morning\nat 6 30 a.m to 8 A.M\num that's mountain time and so it's\npretty early if you're on the west coast\nbut\nthere's definitely space in the morning\ngroup so yeah right on uh well thank you\nso much for chatting with me today Ken I\nthink that you brought a\nA New Perspective to relationships and\nmarriage in particular that's one of the\nmore\nreasonable critiques against my channel\nis that uh as an unmarried guy what do I\nhave uh to be speaking about marriage in\nparticularly so uh I think it was a\nvaluable perspective Ken so thanks again\nfor coming on the show you're welcome it\nwas fun thanks to Ryan all right man\nbye-bye bye"
