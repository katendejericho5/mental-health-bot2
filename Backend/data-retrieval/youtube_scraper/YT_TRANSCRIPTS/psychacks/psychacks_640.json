    "video_title": "SEX and EMOTIONAL BONDING",
    "transcript": "sex is actually a really complicated\nactivity it's not just about making\nbabies and hedonic pleasure there are\nlots of things that sex does in human\nrelationships and one of the most\nimportant things that it does is\nfacilitate emotional bonding this is\nlargely due to the fact that certain\nsexual behaviors like nipple stimulation\nin women and orgasm in men are\nassociated with increased levels of\noxytocin the hormone that facilitates\nemotional bonding the higher the\noxytocin levels the stronger the bond\nthis is why sex is typically so hot and\nheavy in the early stages of the\ncourtship process at this stage of the\nrelationship neither party has any\nlegitimate claim on the other and so\nneither can reasonably expect to see\nthat person ever again this creates a\nlot of uncertainty and insecurity\nespecially when there are high levels of\nAttraction which stimulate the impulse\nto solidify the emotional bond"
