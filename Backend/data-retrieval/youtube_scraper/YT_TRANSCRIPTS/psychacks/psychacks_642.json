    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is\npsychack's Better Living Through\npsychology and the topic of today's\nshort talk is why marriage kills sex\nso I'll start off by saying that by\nmarriage I don't necessarily mean the\nlegal institution of marriage because\nthis will happen in long-term committed\nrelationships especially cohabitating\nrelationships so I'm using the term\nmarriage in this more dilated sense and\nit seems to be the case that the organic\ntendency in relationships is for the\nfrequency and intensity of sex to\ndecline as a function of time there are\nthings you can do to prevent or mitigate\nthis tendency but doing nothing\ngenerally produces outcomes in this\ndirection\nand while I will give you some\nactionable though counter-intuitive\nadvice on how to prevent this from\noccurring in your own relationship\nwe first have to spend some time\nunderstanding why this cooling tendency\noccurs in the first place\nnow there are many reasons why this\nhappens because sex is actually a really\ncomplicated activity it's not just about\nmaking babies and hedonic pleasure there\nare lots of things that sex does in\nhuman relationships and one of the most\nimportant things that it does is\nfacilitate emotional bonding\nthis is largely due to the fact that\ncertain sexual behaviors like nipple\nstimulation in women and orgasm in men\nare associated with increased levels of\noxytocin the hormone that facilitates\nemotional bonding the higher the\noxytocin levels the stronger the bond\nthis is why sex is typically so hot and\nheavy in the early stages of the\ncourtship process at this stage of the\nrelationship neither party has any\nlegitimate claim on the other and so\nneither can reasonably expect to see\nthat person ever again\nthis creates a lot of uncertainty and\ninsecurity especially when there are\nhigh levels of Attraction which\nstimulate the impulse to solidify the\nemotional bond basically when early\ncouples have sex they're functionally\nsaying with their bodies I want you to\ncome back\nand the stronger the bond the more\nlikely the person will return\nnow this situation changes dramatically\nover time once a relationship has been\ndefined and a commitment has been\nsecured and a mutual lifestyle\nestablished the idea that the other\nperson is just going to up and leave\nbecomes less and less of a probability\nin fact there is no need to wonder\nwhether someone is going to come back if\nthey never leave in the first place\nthe relationship becomes more secure but\nin so doing the other person becomes a\nsure thing and once this happens one of\nthe primary functions of sex the\nestablishment of an emotional bond\nbecomes irrelevant and redundant\nthere is no necessity to create Security\nin completely secure relationships it's\njust not needed and because it's not\nneeded it's very hard in some cases to\narouse an authentic desire for it few\npeople crave food when they're not\nhungry\non the whole people have trouble\ntolerating uncertainty and insecurity\nespecially with people they're attracted\nto and this anxiety motivates people to\nreduce that uncertainty and insecurity\nin their relationships as much and as\nquickly as possible and sex is one great\nway to do that\nthe issue is that no one gets aroused by\nsecurity and stability\nto keep desire alive in committed\nrelationships we need to have a greater\nCollective tolerance for uncertainty and\ninsecurity because it's in that space\nthat the necessity for sex as a bonding\nagent remains Evergreen\nnow before I go any further if you like\nwhat you're hearing please consider\nsending this episode to someone who\nmight benefit from its message because\nits Word of Mouth referrals like this\nthat really help to make the channel\ngrow you can also hit the super thanks\nbutton the three little dots in the\nlower right hand corner and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nreceived from this episode\nI rely on your support to make all this\nhappen and I really appreciate it thank\nyou\nokay so how do we go about solving this\nproblem well there are many potential\nsolutions to this problem and what I'm\ngoing to recommend might not work for\neveryone in all cases however you might\nhave to appreciate the fact that if you\ncould have solved the problem by now you\nwould have solved the problem by now so\nthe solution you seek will likely be\nfound in a place you haven't looked yet\nand while I'm not going to encourage\nanyone in the situation to have an\naffair\nI am going to suggest that they act as\nif they were having one\nthat's my suggestion act as if you were\nhaving an affair\nstick with me while I break down why\nthis works let's just imagine for a\nsecond that you were having an affair\nwhat kinds of things would you be doing\nwell you might be a bit more withdrawn\nat home you might be a little more\nsecretive after all you now have\nsomething to hide you might be deviating\nfrom your routine leaving the house at\nodd hours or going places you wouldn't\nordinarily go\nyou might be less communicative and\navailable like you wouldn't answer a\ncall or respond to a text right away if\nyou were with your lover and you might\nbe less needy or demanding about getting\nsex in your primary relationship because\nyou're now getting it on the side all\nthese things seem like plausible\nindicators of an affair right like if\nyour partner changed in all of these\nways all of a sudden wouldn't you\nsuspect cheating and what kind of\nfeelings would that suspicion arouse\nagain I'm not advising people to go out\nand cheat on their spouses but\neverything that goes with cheating\nthe space the mystery the novelty the\nfreedom the risk the elusiveness is\nreally good at maintaining sexual\ninterest\nstop asking permission\ndo something different without telling\nyour partner\ncarve some space for yourself that\ndoesn't involve the other person resist\nthe urge to communicate throughout the\nday\nbreak out of your routines and\nsimultaneously pull back on pursuing sex\nin your primary relationship give your\npartner the opportunity the gift of\nwondering about you\nof feeling your absence of missing your\npresence\nafter all you can't connect with someone\nif you never disengage\nthe idea here is to cultivate a sense of\nthe unknown in explored territory with\nlong-term Partners it's easy to fall\ninto the fallacy that you know\neverything about them\nthat's because you've heard all their\nstories sometimes many many times over\nand you might be in constant\ncommunication throughout the day so when\nyou actually come together in the\nevening you might suffer from the belief\nthat they're a completely known entity\nwhich won't Inspire any interest let\nalone curiosity\nby being spontaneous unpredictable and\ndare I say it selfish\nyou cultivate an island of novelty in\nthe midst of a well-known Sea by\ndisrupting my expectations I pay\nattention\nin paying attention I notice a change\nin noticing a change I become curious\nand in frustrating my curiosity I become\ninterested\nthat interest motivates me to close the\ndistance that you intentionally created\nand to confirm a bond that you\nintentionally made just slightly more\ntenuous\nthrow in the suspicion of another woman\nor another man and voila you've got\nyourself a recipe for passion\nsome of you may think this is game\nplaying but remember\nwe like to play games\nwe play games for fun\nso if your relationship feels like a\njoyless obligation or a boring routine\nor a neutered friendship\nyou might consider injecting some play\ninto your situation and one way to do\nthat is to act as if you were having an\naffair humans are weird and we don't\nalways make sense something to consider\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider becoming a channel member\nwith perks like priority review of\ncomments
