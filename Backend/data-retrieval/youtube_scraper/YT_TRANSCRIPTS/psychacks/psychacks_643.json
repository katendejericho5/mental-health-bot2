    "transcript": "if you can't imagine not hiring an\ninterested applicant that probably means\nthat you have only one applicant and if\nyou have only one applicant the\ninterview process is an empty formality\nat best and a total sham at worst the\ngreater the competition the more likely\nyou're going to find a qualified\napplicant and this is because\ncompetition scares away the less\nqualified as they correctly believe that\nthey have no real chance of winning on\nthe other hand competition motivates\nHigh performers as they see it as an\nopportunity to demonstrate their quality\ncompetition is a filter that operates\nthrough self-selection if you don't\nbelieve me just listen to what your mind\ntells yourself when you decide not to\napproach that nine in a bar"
