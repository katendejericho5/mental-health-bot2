    "video_title": "Why MEN PAY on the FIRST DATE: the freedom of walking away",
    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why men\npay on the first date so this is a\nlong-standing debate the controversy\npredates the internet and there are\nstrong opinions on both sides of the\ntable many of which have some Merit for\ninstance many men nowadays see paying\nfor dates and outdated chivalric act in\nan age when childless women under 30 are\nout earning their male counterparts back\nin the day most women just didn't have\nthe financial opportunity that they do\ntoday so why should the financial burden\nof dating fall on men\nthat perspective certainly makes\nrational sense but I have a better\nargument for the converse today I'm\ngoing to explain why it's really in\nmen's best interests to pay on the first\ndate as I discussed in a recent episode\ndating is really an extended hiring\nprocess in which the man is the employer\nas he is ultimately in a position to\nmake an offer to the woman\nyou are the CEO of ucorp and the whole\npoint of the courtship process is to\ngive a particular woman the opportunity\nto demonstrate that she has the skills\nthe traits and the attributes necessary\nto successfully discharge the role that\nyou have created at ucorp\nit's a chance for her to demonstrate\nthat she has what you're looking for\nbecause she ain't gonna propose to you\neven with all the recent upheavals in\ntraditional gender roles\nso let's re-enter this Frame a bit\nlet's say that you are a company that is\nhiring for a really important role like\na director or a corporate officer\nfor this kind of position you're likely\ngoing to cast a very wide net to ensure\nthat you have a sizable pool from which\nto select the most qualified applicant\nand it might happen that you find a very\ncompelling applicant that just so\nhappens to live on the other side of the\ncountry\nwhat are you going to do\nwell if you're really interested in this\nperson you fly her out to you you put\nher on a plane you put her up in a hotel\nand you expense all her meals you will\ngo out of your way to demonstrate that\nyou believe that she has something of\nvalue that she can provide for the\ncompany and of course you do this\nbecause you expect that should you hire\nher the value that you will get out of\nher productivity will be significantly\ngreater than the costs expended in the\nhiring process like you wouldn't spend\nmore to get her than you hope to get out\nof her right that's bad business but you\nwould spend some to get more that's good\nbusiness\nand while whining and dining qualified\napplicants is certainly a flex for the\ncompany in question it makes the\ntangible immediate impression that the\ncompany is not only solvent but thriving\nwhich can be extremely powerful this\nisn't the real reason why companies\nfoot the bill during the hiring process\nhere's the real reason let's say that\nsomewhere in the interview process you\nlearn that this applicant isn't actually\nwhat you're looking for\nsince the process exists entirely at\nyour pleasure as it were you can\nterminate the process at any point\nwithout any recourse whatsoever\nthat's the real reason\npaying allows you to walk away without\nany complications\nand this is good news because when\nyou're in the sexual Marketplace most\nwomen are not going to be what you're\nlooking for this means that if you're\ndoing it right you're going to be doing\na fair share of walking away\npaying for a date basically communicates\nthat you value your time more than you\nvalue your money and that you're in\ncontrol of the experience let me tell\nyou gentlemen there is absolutely no\nreason to continue a date with a woman\nthat you are neither interested in nor\nattracted to\nI've walked out 10 minutes into a date\nonce I realized that I wasn't able to do\nbusiness\nI just put some money on the table and\nleft she got her free drink and I walked\naway and it was much easier for me to do\nthat because I felt like I didn't owe or\nanything\nthat's what pain communicates I don't\nowe you a damn thing\nnow if you're liking what you're hearing\nplease consider sending this video to\nsomeone who might benefit from its\nmessage because it's Word of Mouth\nreferrals like this that really help to\nmake the channel grow\nand you can also hit the super thanks\nbutton it's the three buttons three\nlittle dots in the lower right hand\ncorner and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've derived from this\nepisode because your support makes all\nof this happen I really appreciate it\nnow at this point in the episode a lot\nof guys are probably thinking why would\nI walk away from a woman that doesn't\nmake sense Orion especially if the woman\nis interested in me and I would respond\nthat the reason why this doesn't make\nsense to you is that you don't yet have\na lot of options when it comes to women\nif you can't imagine not hiring an\ninterested applicant that probably means\nthat you have only one applicant\nand if you have only one applicant the\ninterview process is an empty formality\nat best and a total sham at worst\nin order to have any kind of real\nevaluation\nyou need to have points of comparison\nand to do that you need to generate\ncompetition the greater the competition\nthe more likely you're going to find a\nqualified applicant and this is because\ncompetition scares away the less\nqualified as they correctly believe that\nthey have no real chance of winning on\nthe other hand competition motivates\nHigh performers as they see it as an\nopportunity to demonstrate their quality\ncompetition is a filter that operates\nthrough self-selection if you don't\nbelieve me just listen to what your mind\ntells yourself when you decide not to\napproach that nine in a bar\nin any case if you don't yet have\nsufficient optionality with women it\nlikely means that you have to spend more\ntime and energy resolving the first of\nthe three captains challenges namely you\nneed to work on your boat\na lack of optionality is the universe\ngiving you feedback that your boat is\nnot sufficiently constructed remember in\nthis metaphor a sea going vessel is an\nemotionally compelling lifestyle if\nyou're going to invite a woman into your\nlife you need to have something to\ninvite her into\nand that's your lifestyle and the more\nemotionally compelling your lifestyle\nthe more qualified applicants you're\ngoing to attract and if you do this it\nwill only be a matter of time before\nyou'll have to begin turning down women\nsimply as a practical necessity there\nare only so many seats on the ship\nto that end it's generally a good idea\nto ensure that there is always more\ndemand for a position that your company\nthan there are available positions And\nin the sexual Marketplace men do this by\nbeing visibly competent\nif you're really good at something make\nsure that you give people the\nopportunity to see it\nthe larger the crowd the more interest\nyou attract creating a Perpetual\npipeline of potential applicants\neventually you won't even have to put\nout a notice that you're hiring women\nwill send you resumes on their own\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider becoming a channel member\nwith perks like priority review of\ncomments or booking a paid consultation\nI also hope to be doing some more\npodcast appearances soon and I'm\ninterested in\nbringing more folks onto the channel as\nappropriate if you think that you would\nlike me to talk to somebody that you\nfollow uh on YouTube it's a great idea\nfor you to reach out to them\nto put the idea in their head to invite\nme onto their podcast especially if\nyou're a fan that's generally how\ncontent creators work they listen to\ntheir fan base\num it's hard to invite myself onto\nplaces so a lot of you have been asking\nfor that this is how you can help make\nthat happen\nin any case\num thank you for listening"
