    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is never\nmeet halfway so I'm going to be talking\nabout this in the context of the game of\nmating and dating so let's say that the\ntwo of you matched or you've been\nhitting each other up and it's time to\nset up that first date you live here and\nshe lives there so where are you gonna\nmeet well as the title of this episode\nmakes clear you're absolutely not going\nto meet halfway and I'm going to explain\nto you why this is the case first and\nforemost we have to understand what a\ndate is here it is a date is connection\nplus sexual\npossibility that's the definition of a\ndate connection plus sexual possibility\na date with sexual possibility but no\nconnection is not a date it's a hookup\nlikewise a date with connection but no\nsexual possibility is also not a date\nit's an\ninterview a date is connection plus\nsexual possibility note I'm not saying\nconnection plus sex like the sex is\nguaranteed it's not but for a date to be\na date the possibility that the\nconnection becomes sexual must exist and\nthis my friends is what makes the date\nGod God's perfect creation because when\neverything goes right both the man and\nthe woman get what they want the woman\ngets her connection she gets her\nattention and her emotional engagement\nand her validation she feels heard she\nfeels cared for she feels safe and since\nthe connection comes first it gives the\nwoman time and opportunity to have her\narousal cultivated which is important\nbecause woman's arousal is typically\nmore reactive less spontaneous than\nman's and when everything goes right the\nman actualizes that sexual possibility\nwith a sexual encounter which is pretty\nself-explanatory ideally both parties\nare satisfied as each has given the\nother what they wanted\nPerfection So within this context it\nshould be clear why meeting halfway on a\ndate is not a good idea if you meet\nhalfway it becomes increasingly\ndifficult to realize the sexual\nopportunity where are you going to go\nyou're you're just as far from her place\nas you are from your place are you going\nto get on the subway are you going to\ndrive your separate cars in One\nDirection or another it's silly because\nit doesn't make logistical sense and if\nit doesn't make logistical sense it's\nmuch less likely to happen to facilitate\na sexual encounter there should be as\nfew obstacles in the path of that\ntrajectory as possible and this my dudes\nis your job because as the man you will\nbe expected to plan the date and you\nwill be expected to move the\nrelationship in the direction of a\nsexual encounter women rarely do either\nin fact if you leave it up to them what\nis the date that most women\npropose let's meet for a coffee\nsomewhere in the\nmiddle the\nimpracticality of a sexual opportunity\nin this idea is no accident it's by\nDesign as I've discussed in the\nnegotiation phase women are attempting\nto secure as many resources for as\nlittle sexual opportunity as possible\nwhile men are attempting to secure as\nmuch sexual opportunity for as few\nresources as possible and anchoring at\nthis point in an initial interaction all\nbut\nensures a less satisfying relationship\nfor the man\nthis might make some women feel safer\nbecause there are few things less\nconducive to a sexual encounter than\ndrinking caffeine in a brightly lit Cafe\nin the middle of the day Far From Any\nbedrooms however It suffers from one\nfatal\nflaw it's not a date this is because\nthere is no sexual possibility here this\nis a screening interview which is\nironic because as I've discussed it's\nthe men who do the hiring meeting for\ncoffee halfway is the female equivalent\nto just coming over for sex which women\ntypically don't do so take a page from\nthe ladies Playbook gentlemen and don't\nagree to courtship interactions in which\nsexual opportunity doesn't exist it's\none side getting What It Wants\nimperfection now before I go any further\nif you're liking what you're hearing\nplease consider sending this episode to\nsome who might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel

discussed in the\ndescription below okay let's get back to\nit from a logistical standpoint in order\nto facilitate a sexual opportunity you\nneed a place to easily go back to the\nmore difficult it is to do this the less\nlikely the opportunity will actualize\nthis means that the date can either be\nplanned close to your place or close to\nher place\nwhich means that it should be close to\nyour place why because you can't invite\nyourself over to someone else's place\nand the vast majority of women are not\ngoing to be initiating the sexual\ndimension of the relationship she's not\ngoing to lean in for the kiss she's not\ngoing to suggest you go someplace\nquieter do you understand if she's\ninterested she's going to follow your\nlead and it's much harder to lead\nsomeone into an environment that you\nhave no access or control over\nshe also might not have cleaned the\nplace or prepared the place for guests\nor she may have roommates or live with\nher\nfamily a woman might be ready to have\nsex with you but she might not be ready\nfor other people she knows to know that\nshe has sex with you to the extent that\nyou can provide a clean safe private and\neasily accessible environment you will\nbe more likely to consummate the sexual\nopportunity given all this the only\nrational conclusion is that dates should\nbe planned close to the man's place any\nwoman who bulks at this wants the\nconnection and resources without the\nsexual opportunity which as we discussed\nis not a date it's an interview some\nwomen don't like this in fact when I've\npolitely turned down offers to meet\nhalfway I invariably receive anger and\ncriticism and this by the way is also\nwhat makes this an excellent test of\nfemale character it reveals as quickly\nand cheaply as possible how a particular\nwoman responds to the prospect of not\ngetting exactly what she wants in any\ncase I've been told that this is selfish\nand disrespectful and unfair I've been\ntold that she expected that I would make\nmore of an effort I generally respond to\nthese by reminding the woman in question\nthat I'll be planning the date and\npaying for everything so if the date is\nalso logistically convenient for her\nthen what effort would she be making\neverything would be on her terms which\nis not the basis of a give and take\nrelationship so why would I even bother\nlike it's important for women to have\nsome skin in the game to my mind showing\nup to an invitation is already kind of\nthe minimum effort a person could\npossibly make and if she bulks at that\nthen her interest is likely too low for\nit to be worth my time and money so this\ncan also be a test of women's interest\nlevels\nfinally it sets up the expectation from\nthe very beginning of the courtship\nprocess this is very important that the\nwoman is rewarded that she gets what she\nwants by making an effort and entering\nyour frame not the other way around so\nlet's recap since a date is connection\nplus sexual\npossibility since sexual possibility is\nmore easily actualized in a private\naccessible location and since men are\nexpected to initiate and direct the\nsexual dimension of the relationship\nthen men should plan dates in their\nimmediate vicinity failing to do so\nfunctionally eliminates the sexual\npossibility which given the fact that\nmen transact resources for sexual\nopportunity and women transact sexual\nopportunity for resources in the sexual\nMarketplace makes it more likely that\nthe woman will get more of what she\nwants and the man will get less of what\nhe wants from the onset and over the\ncourse of the relationship so you've\nbeen warned gentlemen if you allow this\nto occur then it's your own damn fault\nwhat do you think does this fit
