    "transcript": "we can approach dating like an extended\nhiring process in a hiring process the\npower Dynamic is asymmetrical though\nboth parties need to consent to to do\nbusiness with each other the one in a\nposition to offer a job is always more\npowerful than the one in a position to\naccept it so if men are ultimately\nexpected to offer a place in their lives\nto women then they are in a position of\nan employer with all the Privileges and\nresponsibilities that come with that\nposition and if women are waiting for\nthe invitation to join the men then they\nare in the position of employees with\nall the Privileges and responsibilities\nthat come with that position one\nposition is not necessarily better than\nthe other just ask most employees who\nhave been promoted to upper management\nwhen they were happy with their work"
