    "transcript": "when people generally ask whether people\ncan change they want to know if radical\npersonality transformation is possible\neither for themselves or for someone\nelse with whom they're in a relationship\nand again yes radical transformation is\npossible inveterate alcoholics can\nchange borderlines and narcissists can\nchange destructive and self-destructive\npeople can change but remember the\nanswer is yes with a butt but they often\ndon't in fact the safe bet in any\nparticular case is that they probably\nwon't and you shouldn't hold your breath\nraiding around for them to do so"
