    "video_title": "DATING is an extended HIRING PROCESS: how to be more confident in the courtship process",
    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraband and this is\npsychack's Better Living Through\npsychology and the topic of today's\nshort talk is dating is an extended\nhiring process that's right dating is an\nextended hiring process this is\nimportant for both men and women to\nunderstand as this will functionally\nflip the script about what most people\nbelieve is happening on a date among\nother things this understanding should\nhelp men assume greater confidence in\ntheir role in the courtship process and\nit should help women increase their\nchances of actually getting what they\nwant sounds good right let's get to it\nto begin with I want you to appreciate\nthe rather striking fact that to the\nbest of my knowledge there has never\nbeen a culture\nanywhere on Earth at any time in human\nhistory that recognize the institution\nof marriage and that expected the woman\nto propose to the man\npretty wild huh\nfolks could argue that this was due to\nthe corruption of an oppressive\npatriarchy that robbed women of their\nagency and choice however here we are\ntoday with all of our enlightened views\non gender and Power in a day and age\nwhen many young women are outperforming\nyoung men and the expectation is still\nthat the man proposed to the woman\nwhat does this mean\nwell it means that on a very fundamental\nlevel\nit is the man who offers a place in his\nlife to the woman not the other way\naround\nit is not the woman who offers a place\nin her life to a man it is the man who\noffers a place in his life to a woman\nand since what is true about business is\ngenerally true about relationships I'm\ngoing to help you understand the\nconsequences of this fact through the\nlens of the professional world\nif we do so we can approach dating like\nan extended hiring process in a hiring\nprocess the power Dynamic is\nasymmetrical\nthough both parties need to consent to\nto do business with each other the one\nin a position to offer a job is always\nmore powerful than the one in a position\nto accept it\nso if men are ultimately expected to\noffer a place in their lives to women\nthen they are in a position of an\nemployer with all the Privileges and\nresponsibilities that come with that\nposition\nand if women are waiting for the\ninvitation to join the men then they are\nin the position of employees with all\nthe Privileges and responsibilities that\ncome with that position one position is\nnot necessarily better than the other\njust ask most employees who have been\npromoted to upper management when they\nwere happiest with their work\nbut both come with prerogatives unique\nto each\ndeep appreciation of this reality should\ncause an adjustment in modern dating\nbehaviors in the first place it should\nmake men more confident because they are\nacting from a position of power just\nlike I'm the CEO of Orion Corp I would\nlike you to consider that you are the\nCEO of ucorp you are the one who\nexecutes your lifestyle and this is both\na privilege and a responsibility just\nlike you cannot hire somebody if you\ndon't yet have an established company\nyou can't bring a woman into your life\nif you don't yet have an established\nlifestyle\nextrapolating that lifestyle will take\ntime energy and money and this generally\nneeds to be accomplished before the\ncourtship can be started in Earnest the\nSilver Lining is that since you are\ntaking the trouble to build the company\nfrom the ground up it should be custom\ntailored to your preferences and\nspecifications\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're uh you're hearing\nthen please consider sending this video\nto someone who might benefit from its\nmessage because it's Word of Mouth\nreferrals like this that really help to\nmake the channel grow and you can also\nhit the super thanks button that's the\nthree little dots in the lower right\nhand corner and tip me in proportion to\nthe value that you feel that you've\nderived from this episode\nthank you for your support makes all\nthis happen\nso let's assume men that you've\ncompleted this task you've gone through\nthe process of establishing your\nlifestyle so you now have something into\nwhich you can invite a woman\ngood\nwhat happens next well when a company\nwants to hire someone what does it do\nput out a vague we're hiring notice\ninterview a host of random people and\nthen take the one with the prettiest\nresume\nof course not but that's more or less\nwhat men do with respect to dating they\nonly have an obscure sense of what they\nactually want a woman for date anyone\nwho will go out with them and then try\nto lock down the prettiest one\nand how's that working out for you Gents\nso what do companies actually do well\nwell before they interview their very\nfirst applicant they clearly define the\nrole for which they are hiring companies\nhire a creative director or an executive\nassistant or a senior researcher or an\nindependent contributor Etc irrespective\nof the details they hire for a specific\nrole\nand that means they need to First\nclarify the expectations for that role\nthey think what are the responsibilities\nthat we can reasonably expect this\nperson to discharge and what are the\ncompensations appropriate for the\nsuccessful dischargement of those\nresponsibilities\nso man before you enter the sexual\nMarketplace I'd like you to consider\nwhat do you actually want a woman for\nwhat role do you want her to play in\nyour life\nand what are the Privileges and\nresponsibilities associated with that\nrole remember you're going to be\ninviting her into your life so it's\nimportant for you to consider where\nexactly she's going to go and what\nexactly she's going to be doing there\nyou want a mother for your children you\ncan hire for that position\nyou want an easy going Playmate you can\nhire for that position\nbut any given applicant probably won't\nbe equally qualified for both positions\nthis is because different skill sets are\nrelevant to different roles so guys once\nyou figure out what you want a woman for\nonce you decide what you want her to do\nthen you can reverse engineer the traits\nskills and attributes that would be\nnecessary to successfully discharge the\nrole that you have created in your life\ndefining these prerequisites before you\ninterview will give you the criteria\nwith which to appropriately screen your\napplicants want a mother for your\nchildren then you probably want somebody\nkind patient loving and Youthful want an\neasy going Playmate then you should\nconsider someone fun sensual attractive\nand independent\nestablishing these criteria ahead of\ntime will prevent you from hiring a\nplaymate when you really want a mother\nand vice versa\nit will also help you to focus on role\nessential attributes and reduce the\nlikelihood that you might become misled\nby role peripheral distractors\nnow once the role has been defined and\nthe criteria have been established men\nare ready to enter into the sexual\nMarketplace having completed these tasks\nbeforehand dating becomes something very\ndifferent that is dating becomes an\nextended hiring process\nit is the means by which men determine\nwhether a particular woman is a\nqualified applicant for the position he\nhas created in his life\nthis is the real function of dating\nand the idea is to collect data over\nmultiple time points and across multiple\ncontexts in the service of that\ndetermination higher slow and Fire fast\nis just as appropriate in the sexual\nMarketplace as in the corporate\nMarketplace\nnow as I said in the beginning of this\nepisode this understanding that dating\nis really the process by which men\ndetermine whether a particular woman is\nqualified for the position he has\ncreated in his life\nshould make men significantly more\nconfident in the sexual Marketplace\nwhy because this completely flips the\nscript\nunder which most men operate most men\napproach dating as if the woman were\nhiring\nthey get in front of a woman and their\nattitude and their behavior basically\ncommunicate\nam I good enough\nam I good enough to have sex with am I\ngood enough to have a relationship with\ndo you like me\nmy brother in Christ she is not going to\nhire you\nshe is never going to get down on one\nknee and offer you a lifetime of\nprovision and protection Hell she's\nnever even gonna ask you out for a drink\nyou are interviewing her my friend you\nneed to meditate on the fact that you\nare doing her a favor\nbecause you are giving her an\nopportunity to demonstrate that she is a\nqualified applicant for an enviable\nposition at an outstanding company do\nyou understand\ndo not surrender the power that\nlegitimately comes with that position\nand the flip side of this understanding\nis for women if you're not hiring\nthen stop trying to control the process\na lot of you are out there acting like\nbosses while looking for a job\nand it's not a good look\nthe applicant does not get to dictate\nwhen and where and what and how\nwith respect to the interview process\nthe applicant does not get to create her\nrole and set her compensation the\napplicant does not get to control when\nshe is hired and by whom so relax and\nenjoy the process\nunless you're applying for the role of\nCEO bossy is probably not among the\nessential attributes of that role no one\nwants to work with someone like that\nand of course if that doesn't work for\nyou remember you are supported\nencouraged and incentivized by modern\nsociety to found your own company and\nhire as you see fit just keep in mind as\nI discussed in the two body problem that\nthat route though an option for women\ndoesn't always go as planned\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well
