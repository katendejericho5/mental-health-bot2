    "transcript": "people absolutely can't change I would\neither be in the wrong profession or a\nShameless huckster if I didn't believe\nthat to be true I'm in the business of\nhelping people change and I see it\nhappen all the time at one level of\ncomprehension people can't not change\nand this is because change is really the\nonly constant in life now that change\ncan often occur so gradually that we\ndon't notice it and or so\nunintentionally that we don't feel like\nwe control how we change but we all\nchange nonetheless"
