    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is can\npeople change\nwell the short answer is yes with a but\npeople absolutely can't change I would\neither be in the wrong profession or a\nShameless huckster if I didn't believe\nthat to be true I'm in the business of\nhelping people change and I see it\nhappen all the time\nat one level of comprehension people\ncan't not change and this is because\nchange is really the only constant in\nlife now that change can often occur so\ngradually that we don't notice it and or\nso unintentionally that we don't feel\nlike we control how we change but we all\nchange nonetheless that said this isn't\nreally the spirit in which this question\nis asked when people generally ask\nwhether people can change they want to\nknow if radical personality\ntransformation is possible either for\nthemselves or for someone else with whom\nthey're in a relationship\nand again yes radical transformation is\npossible\ninveterate alcoholics can change\nborderlines and narcissists can change\ndestructive and self-destructive people\ncan change\nbut\nremember the answer is yes with a but\nbut\nthey often don't\nin fact the safe bet in any particular\ncase is that they probably won't and you\nshouldn't hold your breath raining\naround for them to do so\nso that begs the question what\ndifferentiates the folks who undergo a\nradical personality change from those\nwho do not\nin the vast majority of cases the folks\nwho undergo a radical personality change\nare those who hit bottom\nand hitting bottom is when the\ncircumstances of your life become so\nunsustainable that they are that you are\nfunctionally forced to choose between\nmaking a radical change or death\nin my experience nothing else is really\ncapable of producing such an outcome\nand even when such a transformation\noccurs there will be forces that will\nact to frustrate its\ncompletion\nnow one of the greatest works of art\nthat we have available to us on this\nsubject is Victor Hugo's Les Miserables\nmost people are familiar with this work\nthrough the musical adopted from its\ntext which is also excellent in fact\nit's my favorite musical the main plot\nline which narrates the decades-long\npursuit of ex-convict Jean Valjean by\nPolice Inspector Javert is actually a\nprotracted debate over whether it's\npossible for people to truly change\nlet's take a closer look shall we\nJean Valjean is the protagonist of the\nstory he served 19 years of hard labor\nfor stealing a loaf of bread to feed his\nstarving nephew when he has finally\nreleased on parole he can't get work\nanywhere because of his status as a next\nconvict he is poor and desperate and\nfilled with hate over the Injustice he\nhas suffered and he eventually resorts\nto stealing once again this time from a\npriest who shelters him for the night\nhowever when Valjean is captured the\nnext morning with the stolen goods\nrather than turn him in the priest not\nonly covers for Valjean but makes him an\nadditional gift of a pair of\ncandlesticks as well\nthis is likely the first kindness\nValjean experienced in over 20 years and\nthe priest's Mercy serves as an\nindisputable counterfactual to his\ndominant worldview namely that the law\nof the universe is an eye for an eye a\ncruel and implacable place\nwhat follows is a number called\nvaljean's Soliloquy which is a fantastic\nexample of what hitting bottom looks\nlike I've included a link to Hugh\nJackman's powerful rendition in the\ndescription below\nin the beginning he reiterates his story\nand it's the story of every Angry\nhateful person if there's another way to\ngo I missed it 20 long years ago my life\nwas a war that could never be won they\ngave me a number and they murdered\nValjean when they chained me and left me\nfor dead just for stealing a mouthful of\nbread\nall the core components of a\nself-victimizing narrative are there I\nhad no other choice it's too late for me\nanyway the world is unfair I didn't do\nanything in any case what they did is\nmuch worse my rage is Justified Etc\nthe crisis Point comes about two minutes\ninto the song When moved by the pain of\nhis Contrition he asks on his knees What\nSpirit comes to move my life is there\nanother way to go\nnotice what happens in the score the\nmusic becomes all tension with the\nstrings vibrating back and forth like\nhe's walking on a tightrope this is the\nmoment of danger\nwill his hatred and self-pity cause him\nto fall into Perdition or will he make\nthe leap into an unknown possibility\nand then listen to his decision\nI'll Escape now from that world from the\nworld of Jean Valjean\nas I've mentioned in previous episodes\nit is not possible to experience\nanything outside of your Consciousness\none of the consequences of this is that\nthe quality of yourself comes to imbue\neverything that you perceive with itself\nso that reality becomes a reflection of\nyour own being Valjean finally\nunderstands that to escape from the\ncruel and hateful world he must resolve\nthe cruelty and hatred inside of himself\nthat is the world of Jean Valjean\nhe goes on\nJean Valjean is nothing now another\nstory must begin\nagain excellent another story must begin\nwell what was the first story if you\nthink about it it could only be Jean\nValjean that's right who you think you\nare what you think about the world these\nare stories that you tell yourself they\nare not who you are because it is not\npossible for any story to contain the\nstory maker they exist on two different\nontological planes and any story that\nyou tell yourself can be retold by that\nsame self\nthis is the creative potential of the\nFree Will which may be the spark of the\nDivine that exists within all of us\nand that new story must begin because if\nit doesn't Valjean will die physically\nspiritually or both\nand with this conviction he strides out\nof the chapel and rips up his parole\npapers symbolizing the obliteration of\nwho he has been up until that point his\neyes are wild and intense because\nintensity is required for to complete\nthe transformation this is not something\nthat can be undone\nValjean holds his last note through\nthree violent ascending horn blasts as\nif to confirm the strength of his\nresolve before the score explodes into\nthe Glorious main theme of the musical\nit's like the whole universe is\ncelebrating valjean's decision you did\nit\nand we leave Valjean standing in a\ngraveyard next to a cross which\nsymbolized the death of his former self\nand his resurrection as a new man\nrespectively it's the best shot in the\nwhole movie and that's hitting bottom\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the super\nthanks button the three little dots in\nthe lower right hand corner and tip me\nin proportion to the value you feel that\nyou've received from this episode\nbecause it's your donations that make\nall of this happen and I really\nappreciate your support\nnow\nback to Les Mis at this point the action\nskips ahead eight years Valjean has\nassumed a new identity and has become a\nrespectable member of society he's the\nmayor of a town and the owner of a\nfactory that employs hundreds of workers\nhowever despite his transformation and\nhis commitment to his new self he can\nnever truly Escape his past\na chance encounter leads Inspector\nJavert whose Duty it is to hunt down\nthose who have broken parole to\nrecognize Valjean as former convict\nprisoner 24601\nnow let's talk about Javert\ndespite being the antagonist Javert is\nnot really a bad guy this is because as\nin all great works of art the primary\ntension here is not between good and\nevil which is very simplistic and does\nnot really help us navigate reality\nwhere in any case such distinctions are\nrarely if ever so obvious but between\ntwo mutually incompatible World Views\nDostoevsky was great with this in any\ncase Javert represents the principle of\nconstant justice of Law and Order\nin his view people can't change to\nJavert good is good and evil is evil and\nwe need Law And Justice to protect the\nformer from the latter\nor everything falls apart after all if\nthe righteous can fall and the\nspiritually dead can be reborn then\nreally all conceptualizations of Good\nand Evil would kind of be useless as you\ncould never really tell who was who\nin any case Javert isn't wrong we do\nneed Justice in order and Valjean isn't\nright people can't really run from their\npasts but they absolutely represent two\nmutually incompatible World Views and\nthe whole dramatic action of the story\nis a discussion of which worldview will\nultimately win out as Javier insists in\nhis final song there is nothing on Earth\nthat we share it is either Valjean or\nJavert\nthey are each other's shadows in the\nsense that each represents the unchosen\npath of the other as we learn in the\nconfrontation Link in the description\nJavert was born in a jail but chose a\npath as an officer of the law well\nValjean born in Freedom freely chose to\nbreak that law as Javert says every man\nis born in sin every man must choose his\nway\nfinally in this scene Javert explicitly\ntells Valjean men like you can never\nchange men like me can never change\nwhich makes explicit the fundamental\ntension between them if Javert is right\nthen Valjean is and will always be\nescaped convict 24601\nwho has cowardly assumed a new identity\nto evade Justice and if Valjean is right\nthen Javert is doomed because his\narrogance presumes that his continued\nrighteousness is assured\nin fact at the very deepest level the\nstory of Les Mis is biblical Javier\nrepresents the Law of the Old Testament\na retributive Justice that calls for an\neye for an eye there are laws so many\nlaws that must be followed there are\npunishments for their violation and\nrewards for their observation\non the other hand Valjean represents the\ngood news of the New Testament that\nsalvation is possible even for the most\nmiserable of Sinners and that through\nthe death of the self a new man can be\nreborn through the transfigurative\nmystery of the cross\nwhich worldview will win out it is\neither Valjean or jevere\nit's important to note that though\nradical transformation is possible we\ncan't really Escape our past\nin AAA when an addict undergoes a sudden\ntransformation and expects everyone\nincluding all those he may have\nrepeatedly harmed over the years to\naccept him as this new person they call\nthis a spiritual bypass\nradical transformation does not absolve\na person from the necessity of making\namends and we see this once again in Les\nMiserables while the rest of his life\ncould potentially be considered\nvaljean's attempt to make amends for the\ncrimes of his past he has the\nopportunity to practically escape the\nconsequences of his action\nby allowing an innocent man who had been\nfalsely arrested for being escaped\nconvict 24601 to go back to prison in\nhis Stead\nduring his years as the mayor Valjean\nhad done well but he was still in hiding\nstill running from his past still\nrunning from Javert\nBelgian confirmed the reality of his\ntransformation by revealing himself and\nsurrendering to Justice\nwithout this step we can make no\ncontinuity between our former and our\ntransformed selves which is to live as a\nfabrication a man without a past\nto truly transform we not only need to\nhit bottom but we have to\nnon-defensively accept the crimes of our\npast otherwise we are in continual\nviolation of our parole\nwe have all done wrong we are all\nimperfect people we are all 24601.\nhowever Not only would we prefer that\nother people not know this we would\ngenerally prefer that we ourselves were\nnot aware of this as well\nand we spend a lot of energy hiding this\nfrom others and hiding this from\nourselves but Javert is Relentless no\nmatter how much we change no matter how\nmuch growth and healing and\ntransformation we undergo there will\nalways be an element inside of us that\nsays something like who do you think\nyou're fooling\nI can see right through you\nonce an addict always an addict wants a\ndepressive always a depressive once a\nloser always a loser\nlike Javert there is a pull toward\norder and self-consistency even if the\nself to whom we are consistent is\nperverse and destructive\nso we can also potentially view the\nantagonism between Valjean and Javert as\nthe psychic conflict between the\nconscious personalities striving for\ndisruptive change and the judging\nsuperego seeking for ordered constancy\nand that's the larger theme of the story\nitself which takes place at the brink of\nrevolution of a society are we going to\ndisrupt\nuh have a disruptive action for positive\nchange or are we going to repressively\nseek to keep things the way they've\nalways been\nso it's mirrored not just at this\nindividual level but on the social level\nin the story as well\nso what happens in the end well since\nthey are each other's shadows what\nhappens to Javert in the end of the\nstory is what happens to Valjean in the\nbeginning\nhis world view is incontestably\nchallenged by an act of Mercy\nwhen Valjean spares Javier's life Javert\nis unable to reconcile his\nconceptualization of Valjean as a fallen\ncriminal with the counterfactual\nevidence of Valjean as a Merciful Savior\nif Javier was right and people cannot\nchange then Valjean should have killed\nhim\nand if Javier was wrong and people can\nchange then his past self Must Die\neither way javer is checkmated\nhe has hit bottom\nhowever\nrather than taking the leap into Faith\nthrough the possibility of Resurrection\nto escape from the world of Inspector\nJavert\nhe takes a literal leap off a bridge\ninto death\nto escape from the world of Jean Valjean\nthis Final Act makes Javert a tragic\nfigure a man who ultimately becomes\nensnared in his own self-consistency\nand the old laws have been dissolved in\nlight of a new possibility of redemption\nlike I said this story is fantastic and\nI would highly recommend that you either\nsee the musical or read the book for\nyourself what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience
