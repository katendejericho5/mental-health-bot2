    "transcript": "hello this is Orion taraban and this is\ncycax Better Living Through psychology\nand today I am very happy to be speaking\nwith Alexander Grace thank you for\njoining us all the way from Australia\nthank you for having me excited I've\nbeen a fan of Alexander's content\npersonally for years and I really\nrespect his even-handed evidence-based\napproach to intersexual Dynamics\nand to relationships in particular and I\nthink he has a a special commitment to\nhelping out men I think that's in like\nyour hey HERO program it's specifically\ngeared towards men and helping them\nbecome better versions of themselves not\nnecessarily just about getting laid but\nbecoming the best\nbest possible men that they can be\nyes I am passionate about that I think\nI'm\nuh of the opinion that men and women's\ninterests uh competing with each other\nin some regards particularly if people\nare not working optimally I think when\nmen's best interests are being served is\nactually benefits women so I don't see\nit at one is the expense of each other\nas a zero-sum game so even though I do\nhelp men because I'm a man I think I can\ndo that better I'm very pleased to know\nthat the work that I do definitely\nbenefits their girlfriends benefits\ntheir daughters so I'm all about just\nalleviating suffering and helping All\nHumans right on and as you know I am a\npsychologist who specializes in men's\nmental health so I think that's a real\npoint of commonality between us and so\nI'd like to begin by asking so based on\nthe people that you tend to work with\nthe men who purchase consultations from\nyou or by your programs what are some of\nthe biggest challenges that you see\nfacing men today\ntypically they they come in two forms is\none is a variation of I can't seem to\nget a girlfriend the other is I'm in a\nrelationship but it's not working very\nwell what can I do to fix myself fix her\nfix the relationship so that I'm happier\ninside my relationship I know that's\nquite broad but um it's like am I\nanswering questions about dating or am I\nanswering questions about relationships\nand sometimes the cause of the problems\nin both Arenas can be the same sometimes\ndifferent\nsure there are different strategies and\nskills that are necessary in different\nstages of the courtship and the\nrelationship process but what's\ninteresting there is I assume you're\ncasting a very wide net you're talking\nto all of these guys they could bring\nyou issues or concerns about anything\nbut mostly they bring you concerns about\nwomen either women they're trying to\ndate or women they're actually in\nrelationships with as opposed to their\nself-esteem or their careers or other\nthings so do you think that's reflective\nof where men's minds are at is that\nthey're generally focused on women\nno I think that's reflective of my role\non the internet actually I'm like the\nwomen Whisperer right like so I think\nthat they're probably all that other\nstuff is very important to men and\nthey're seeking those problems out\nelsewhere but the Alexander Grace\nYouTube channel like what I do is\nessentially take what is mysterious and\nunknowable and unexplainable to a lot of\nmen and then I try and put it in terms\nthat men are able to understand you know\nlike if a woman was an algorithm this\nwould be what it looks like and so I\nsort of break that down so people just\ngenerally know in the back of their mind\nlike oh that's that Alexander Grace guy\nhe seems to understand women why they do\nwhat they do so when they come up with\nproblems in their lives where I don't\nunderstand why women aren't attracted to\nme I don't understand why my\ngirlfriend's always mad at me I don't\nunderstand why this is so hard they just\nvomit out that information to me and\nthen I respond I decoded all here's what\nshe's thinking here's what she's feeling\nhere's what's going to make it better\nfor her here's what to do so whether or\nnot they're seeking out other like\nthings about their and stuff like that\nthey probably are I have no idea if\nwomen is actually at the Forefront I\njust know that that's that's my job\nthat's that's what people come to me for\nthat makes sense so\num would it be interesting to know how\nyou figured this stuff out like how did\nyou how did you understand that you were\nthe woman Whisperer\n[Music]\nI am absolutely fascinated by the\ndifferences between men and women like I\njust for whatever reason I find that\nreally really interesting because it is\nvery distinct and I'm of the belief that\nthe male experience and the female\nexperience is vastly different the\nshared commonality of the humanity is is\ninteresting but it's those points of\nDivergence that I found so interesting\nand I also find it so poorly understood\nand so when I realized that they were so\npoorly understood it was kind of like oh\nmy God like why is there such a huge gap\nbetween reality and people's knowledge\nof that reality and look at how much\ngood I can do here which is probably why\nit became my career with regards to why\nI was interested in it personally I\nthink it's because I recognized very\nearly on that it was my inability to\ndistinguish the differences between men\nand women that was actually causing the\nfrustrations I was having in the dating\nmarket and this is back when I was like\na teenage kid you know what I mean like\nI had my share of girlfriends or\nwhatever but mostly I was just kind of\nblustering about and kind of having\naccidental successes of just being\npersistent I wasn't being smooth I\ndidn't really understand what I was\ndoing and when I think back on some of\nthe mistakes I made it can link back to\nthe fact that I didn't know what women\nwere attracted to I didn't know how to\nbehave in order to specifically appeal\nto their femininity and then when I was\n19 my buddy showed me the stuff online\nabout like the pickup artist Community I\ndon't know if you ever got into that\nkind of stuff like game and flirtation\nand seduction techniques or whatever and\nI had a good like nine months of just\nlike studying it and going out with my\nbuddies and like trying all of this\nstuff and I just learned so much\npractically I was like oh my God like\nwomen this is what works and it just\nkind of captured my brain and that's I\nthink it was in that dichotomy that I\nreally became consciously aware of\nmyself as a man I was like because this\nstuff that's working women that would\nnever work on me like it's not hitting\nany part of my resonance but it's like\ncandy to these girls like they are\nabsolutely loving it and that fascinated\nme I don't understand why more people\naren't absolutely fascinated by that and\nthen I got more interested in the other\nstuff because in the course of my\nrelationship the more I lent into the\nfact that I was the man and that she was\nthe woman you know when I did get out of\ngame and did decide it was time to sort\nof settle down I got more and more\nsuccessful and the relationship was\nreally good like like really good\nthere's no false modesty for me my\nrelationship was and is really fantastic\nand I remember it got to a point maybe\nthree years into the relationship where\nanother set of my friends broke up and\nthey were kind of the last couple that I\nhad looked up to and could ask advice\nabout any time I got to a problem and\ntoday I was like maybe 25 or something\nyou know and I came from a my parents\ngot divorced and I was like I don't\nthink anybody understands how to do this\nproperly like nobody seems to be happy\nin their relationships everyone seems to\nhate their partner and I mean getting\ndivorced or break looking up or they\ncan't make it work they're trying to\nhave you know Affairs or whatever and I\nhad worked so diligently on\nUnderstanding Psychology understanding\nmyself understanding the differences\nbetween men and women and my\nrelationship was going well and people\nstarted to ask me for advice over a long\nperiod of time and I think that\nit's kind of an accident but at some\npoint I started a YouTube channel\nbecause I was actually doing research on\non something completely different but I\ncame across the red pill on Reddit and I\nwas like wow this is really interesting\nit was the first time I had seen\nevolutionary psychology framed as\nevolutionary psychology I was a big fan\nof Nathaniel Brandon I don't know if you\nknow his work but the biocentric\npsychology from like the 60s movement I\nwas huge on so I was already kind of\nfamiliar with that idea that we have\nthese innate psychological\ncharacteristics but I was like reading\nall this red pill stuff and some of it I\nwas like that makes sense but that\nsounds sexist or that sounds true but I\ndon't think people are going to accept\nthat that's true and I was like what\nwould happen if we took these ideas\nout of the internet and then took them\nto real women on the street and the idea\njust kind of amused me so this was my\norigin story is I just wrote a bunch of\nquestions like the red pill says this\nabout women and I went to the beach and\nI filmed women I was like this is what\nthey say about women what do you think\nand so the first like 30 40 videos of my\nchannel was just me interviewing women\non the street about these ideas and\ngenerally we found there's a lot of\nagreements some really upset\ndisagreement but it was an interesting\ndiscussion and then that brought me onto\nthe YouTube space and then I started\nlooking at the other channels that\npeople said were similar to mine and the\nadvice they were giving and I was just\nappalled I was like oh my God none of\nthese guys have any idea what they're\ntalking about like this is who people\nare going to for advice I was really\nreally kind of depressed and that kind\nof gave me the confidence boost of like\noh I think I actually know more than the\nso-called like experts here so I started\nputting my own opinions out online\nobviously I'm very Alexander Grace\nCentric so I think my content is good\nand it's been six years or so since I've\nchecked in on what other people are\nsaying so I have no idea if their stuff\nis better or if I was just unfair in my\ninitial judgment but regardless that was\nthe confidence I needed and I started my\nYouTube channel and um I think the\nsuccess of my channel and the fact that\npeople still seek me out validates that\nI do kind of know what I'm talking about\nuh and the people do listen so yeah\nthat's my story right on thanks for\nsharing that's really interesting\nthere's so much in what you just said I\nI agree there's a lot of bad advice on\nthe internet generally\num both for men and women with respect\nto what works in relationships and\nattraction and while there might be some\ntruth to a lot of red pill stuff it's\noften verbalized in a way that\nis like preaching to the choir I believe\nit's like the the folks who already buy\ninto it hook line and sinker are going\nto be nodding vigorously but it's\nlargely going to be alienating to\nanybody who hasn't already been let's\nsay initiated into that field and so one\nof the particular goals of my channel\nwas to take some of those ideas and\npresent them in a way that if I were\nspeaking directly to a woman she might\nbe able to understand and agree with\nbecause I don't see the point a lot of\nred pill commentators are complaining\nabout the This Modern state of\nfemininity and women but they're doing\nit in a way that is is not at all going\nto cause anyone to change their behavior\nso I'm not really sure what their end\ngoal here is except potentially making\nmen angrier at women for their own\nbusiness uh objectives\noh man so that's what a pleasure to\nencounter a mind that's reached the same\nconclusion that I have I could say the\nexact same thing it frustrates me that\nthere's not an effort made by these guys\nto try and make this information\naccessible and mainstream and to bring\nwomen on as allies I'm like what's the\npoint in staying in that Echo chamber do\nwe just want to Pat ourselves on the\nback and say we're victims or do we\nactually want to improve things and so\nevery single one of my videos I make\nwith the full awareness that a woman is\ngoing to watch it and I want a woman to\nagree with everything that I'm saying\nthat's a standardized step for myself\nright on yeah I feel the same way\nbecause we need each other women aren't\ngoing anywhere men aren't going anywhere\nand it's great that we're different and\nI think that we can learn to work\ntogether to Greater Harmony\nwhat's when you were started talking\nabout when you first became aware of\nthe fact that men and women were vastly\ndifferent from each other\nI have a story about the first time I\nrealized that it's a very silly anecdote\nbut I must have been like maybe 11 or 12\nand I was watching the musical grease\nhave you seen that with John Travolta\nsorry and Olivia Newton John okay so\nit's a it's a silly\num High School Musical from like the 70s\nand there's this number in it called\nSummer nights where the John Travolta\nand his guy friends and Olivia yeah yeah\ngirlfriends I know that scene are\ntalking about the date but they're\ntalking about it in totally different\nways and my 12 year old mind was blown I\nwas like they're this they see it\ntotally differently but the same thing\nhappened\nyou know you get that sometimes musicals\nlike in West Side Story America the kind\nof contest between the men and women\nover whether you know they're Pro or con\nNew York City and it's just that was\nactually my entree into the possibility\nthat men and women Psychology was vastly\ndifferent from each other yep no it's a\ncool story yeah 100 they're very\ndifferent I believe\nand you're uh foray into the Pua stuff I\nthink is not uncommon to guys who get\ninto the red pill I think that pickup\nArtistry is not really an end in and of\nitself certainly not one that men in my\nopinion should necessarily aspire to but\nit can be really useful because what\npickup artists are fundamentally\ninterested in is Effectiveness they're\nlike\nscientists with respect to applied\nbehavioral psychology and like good\nscientists on some level they're kind of\nvalue neutral is they think you know I\ncan't\npresume to know what should work with\nthis I'm going to go in and just throw a\nbunch out there and see kind of what\nsticks and then sort of extrapolate my\nmodels based on outcomes as opposed to\nstarting with a value proposition and\nextract language should work based on\nwhat you believe yeah and I think that's\nkind of what's great about\npick up community in general is that\nit is really based on what works like\nwhat makes the plane fly and\nthe proof is in the pudding as it were\nand I also think that the very thing\nthat you just elucidated about pickup\nartist is why you don't see it as a\nstrong force anymore I don't know about\nlike your audience but because it was my\norigin I I started off assuming that\nmost guys had gone through pickup or\nlearned the basics and it's not not the\ncase the younger generation the guys who\ndiscover this stuff\nthey're more interested in the value\ndiscussions I think the sort of\nemptiness I suppose in terms of actual\nvalues in the pickup Artistry doesn't it\nmeans that it can't ever become like a\ncollective movement in the way that you\nsee online communities congregate these\ndays and it also is difficult it takes\nwork and I also think that it's less\nsocially appropriate to approach women\nrandomly you know back that now than it\nwas you know 15 years ago when I was\ndoing it so I think that there's a lot\nthat's been lost unfortunately in the\nfact that more young men aren't\npracticing game and developing those\nskills\num they're more likely to just get\nreally down like the red pill or the\nblack pill or whatever like this and and\njust by way as a disclaimer I certainly\ndon't consider myself red pill I know\npeople have applied that label to me but\nthat's not something I have for myself\nso just to sort of clarify\num\nbut that that bums me out I would like\nto see more guys practice their game uh\nyeah yeah I have a video that's going to\nbe coming out soon about why men are\nafraid of approaching women and partly\nit's very hard to do that in the shadow\nof let's say the metoo movement where\nthere's not only the threat of rejection\nbut there's the threat of being canceled\nor being shamed for expressing sexual\ninterest and that's the world in which\nwe find ourselves but actually I in in\nlistening to some of the comments from\nmy own audience\nwhen I talk about seduction techniques\non my channel the pushback is generally\nmore black pilled it's it's more the\njuice isn't worth the squeeze why go\nthrough all of the why learn these\nskills just to get a woman when a woman\nisn't you know\nreally all that great of a reward anyway\nI see a lot of hopelessness among the\nyounger generation have you encountered\nthis as well in your own work yeah yeah\n100\nand what do you think that's about\nlike why why is it showing up now\nthings are worse than they've ever been\nin terms of people getting together\nthere's more single dim I think women's\nhypergamy are stronger than ever before\nthe expectations on men are very\ndifficult\nso it's it's a lot of that and I think\nthat the the hopelessness I suppose the\ngiving up is just the final response of\nsomebody who can't handle rejection or\npain\nany longer I mean I think most of these\nguys would understand that there are\nsome men who are happy in relationships\nwho found good women and they're\nfulfilling all of their needs that they\never wanted from a relationship again\nyou don't want to brag but without false\nmodesty like I'm one of those guys so it\ncan happen I know for a fact that it can\nhappen that you can be very happy and\nfind a good woman but if you feel like\nthat's beyond you I suppose you're gonna\ncling to any kind of like uh explanation\nthat sort of gives you permission to\ngive up that way you don't constantly\nhave to feel like a failure you know\nwhat I mean like if you think of the\nenvy you might feel over a rich person\nyou know and all the success and all the\nlike the lavish luxury goods that they\nhave and no matter what you just don't\nseem to be able to break into that that\nstrata Stratosphere of wealth you might\nbe very attracted to ideologies\npolitical ideologies that tell you that\nrich people are all corrupt and that you\nknow money isn't the source of all\nhappiness or whatever like it is I mean\nand it's not I'm not not making that\npoint but I suppose you you look for\nsome kind of um justification for your\nown failure I suppose there's a kind of\nnumbing effect say ah it's it's not me\nit's not so bad and that's a tough one\nbecause you can't apply it universally\nbecause it's kind of not their fault in\na lot of ways you know what I mean like\nthe idea that if you don't manage to\nfind success and happiness in a\nrelationship with a high quality woman\nthere therefore it's all on you is\nsimply not true like there's existential\nfactors at play it's really hard the\ndating market sucks for men there's also\na certain amount of luck now it's true\nthat with enough dedicated effort and\ninformation and and work over the time\nyou probably can improve those odds\nsignificantly but with the black pill\nguys and the Doom and Gloom they'll\npoint to a lot of stuff that's that's\nabsolutely real absolutely reasonable\nit's not an absolute in my mind but you\ncan't dismiss what they're saying either\nas though it's all just their own\nproblem and they're just making all this\nstuff up no that's absolutely not the\ncase so it's it's a tough line to\nbalance and I find that um\nI find that it's also an emotionally\nsensitive topic a lot of guys will get\nvery upset I suppose in any suggestion\nthat they can improve their life and\nthat's a bummer that they've gotten to\nthat stage almost like\nthe the feeling of shame or failure or\nthe loss of happiness or the grief of\nnot having the life they imagined is so\npainful that any small suggestion that\nthat might still be possible for them if\nthey take some personal agency is too\nmuch and they block it angrily and the\npsychology of a man who's got to that\nstage is something that really really\nconcerns me and actually motivates me to\ncontinue to make my content because I\ncertainly wouldn't want them to kind of\ngive up\num but I found it's best not to actually\ntalk to them directly in that regard\nbecause it just angers them you know too\nmuch you know it's just too sensitive a\nsubject so yeah I think grief is a\nreally important word that you just use\nthere because I I do think on some level\nthat men might have to pass through the\ndeath of a dream in order to arrive at\nacceptance of reality and it's and with\nthe acceptance of reality the way women\nreally are the way the world really\nworks the way the relationships actually\nfunction that you stand the best\npossible chances of having successful\nhappy satisfying relationships\num that a lot of relationships that are\nfounded on dreams tend to fail but\nthere's nothing more painful than the\ndeath of a dream and that's actually\nwhat heartbreak is it's not so much\num that you've you're losing what you\nhad because that's like sacrosanct in\nyour memory no one can ever take that\nfrom you what you're losing is all the\npossibilities of what you wanted that\nyou didn't yet attain the future that\nyou wanted but will never have and\nthat's really really hard and\nheartbreaking to give up but there could\nbe enough\nin reality if you can get through that\nthat is still worth striving for does\nthat make sense a hundred percent and I\nhope to anybody listening to what um Dr\nRyan's just said really takes that on\nboard and let me say from the other side\nthat my relationship now is not what I\nfantasized it was going to be but it's\nbetter\nI promise you it's better the reality\nhas a certain\nlike we all know that when you when you\ntake reality and then you distort it\nthrough your own interpretation your\nlens and you use it to play out some\nfantasy like if you find an average girl\nwith an average personality but you\nproject on her all this amazingness and\nyou live out this pretend fantasy for a\ncouple of weeks that she's this\nincredible girl she's going to solve all\nyour problems there's a kind of like\nlike an amphetamine style like high that\ncomes from that is like oh I'm getting\naway from reality I'm doing this but you\ngot to keep kind of going\nand it's it's it's not very satisfying\nin fact it's anxiety provoking it's not\nreally that good so in case you're like\ninclined to not process your grief\nbecause you don't want to give up these\ndelusions about how special and amazing\nwomen are they're going to solve all\nyour problems you'll be happily ever\nafter in case you don't want to do that\nwork let me tell you that you're not\nreally giving up anything that's that's\nspecial you know what I mean playing out\nthat fantasy is not that good the\nreality of a good relationship it's it's\nmore like calm it's like gentle it's\npeaceful you know what I mean there's a\nsort of quiet satisfaction and pride\nthat never expresses itself with really\nintense emotions or a huge rush of\nthoughts or or aspirations about the\nfuture no it's quite grounded and based\non on the present moment and it's\ninfinitely more satisfying so\nlike grave because you're not giving up\nanything good like what you get\nwhat you get at the end of The Grieving\nthe the dream as Dr Ryan just said is\nyou get reality and reality is so much\nbetter than anything that you could\nimagine if you do it right I suppose\nyeah yeah this reminds me of the origin\nmyth of romantic love which is the um\nthe myth of Tristan and he soldi are you\nfamiliar with that myth I'm not and just\nas a small technical thing is your\ncamera like bobbing up and down ever so\nslightly is it I maybe I'm oh I'm\nknocking the table so it kind of okay\nI'll try not to do that thanks for\ncalling that out so um\nthis is like the foundational myth of\nWestern romantic love it originated in\nthe south of France in like the 13th\ncentury and it's a very interesting\nstory\num Tristan is a knight in the service of\nhis King and he basically drinks a magic\npotion that causes him to fall in love\nwith\nthe king's wife and she drinks the same\nposter so she falls in love with him and\nso they have this horrid passionate love\naffair that\nexists even though they don't even know\neach other even though they don't even\nreally like each other they kind of are\nmiserable when they're apart but also\nlike especially miserable when they're\ntogether and in the course of this story\nTristan actually like swears this woman\noff ah this is crazy I have to stop\nseeing this woman and she's like no I I\nhave to we can never do this again and\nhe gets involved with a woman who's\nin this in the myth is also named to\nsolely but it's a different facility and\nshe's the assaulty of the white hand and\nin this relationship they can have they\nlive together like she is a textile\nperson and they have dinner together and\nthey they like create a household\nit's a peaceful ordinary relationship\nthat's functional\nand Tristan is completely bored like he\ncan't stop thinking about the first\nfacility\nand he eventually leaves that\nrelationship because it felt\nunfulfilling like something was missing\nand I think this is really important\nbecause what you talked about is you\nmaybe you can't get everything that you\nwant from a relationship maybe part of\nthe problem here is that people are\ngoing to relationships expecting the\nwrong things but\nit could be that if you leave those\nexpectations to the side there's enough\nthat you can get out of an actual\nrelationship to justify let's say the\nsacrifices involved in creating and\nmaintaining it\noh my God yeah really well put so to add\non to that just to flesh it out and put\nsome flesh on the bones here\na lot of people did not grow up with\nhaving all of their emotional needs and\ntheir attachment needs adequately met by\ntheir parents parenting in the west is a\nbit of a disaster\num I think we're getting better in some\nregards but for the most part for the\ngeneration of me I'm 35 Dr Ryan's 40 I\nthink a lot of people kind of become\nadults but they're stunted emotionally\nthey have a bunch of unmet needs and\nthen you couple that with the fairy tale\nhappily ever after Hollywood soul mate\nkind of fantasy myth I've got to find my\nmissing half a lot of people are\nbringing a huge amount of expectations\nto their partner they're going to solve\nthis they're going to solve that like\nthey're going to fix all of these things\nand it's unrealistic but if you can\nunderstand what the limitations of a\nwoman what a wife or even a boyfriend if\nthis doesn't have to be gender but what\na partner can do for you then in the\ncourse of that relationship you will try\nand get those unmet needs met realize\nthat it's not appropriate and then if\nyou're diligent you can work through it\nand that the relation relationship\nitself can become an Arbiter of reality\nof what's appropriate to ask of another\nperson and what's not and you never\ndelve too deeply into codependence you\nactually work on becoming too\ninterdependent people that's quite\nfunctional and so it becomes a vehicle\nfor self-growth in a sense and once\nyou've used that process to its\ncompletion you realize holy [ __ ] it's\nthrough this relationship that I've\nactually discovered where I start and\nwhere I begin like where my boundaries\nare who I am and I've also helped this\nother person come that way at that point\nwhen you're not bonded through\nobligation or codependence that's I\nthink where True Love Actually exists\nit's a pair bonded trust respect Mutual\nenjoyment of each other's company and\nit's incredible it's amazing\nbut it's specifically all those good\nthings because it never tries to be\nsomething that it's not it's a lot of\nguys are coming to me and the fights are\nhaving in their girlfriend are just\nvariations of this exact theme and so\nwhat I I tell them is that\nyou'll probably love this as a\npracticing clinician but there's nothing\nwrong with the emotions that you have\nthe needs that you that you have the the\nunmet needs it's just that she's not the\nright person to fix that girlfriends are\nnot your mothers and he's like well I\nhave a [ __ ] relationship with my mother\nlike what am I going to do I'm like a 30\nyear old man now I was like yeah I get\nthat go see a therapist you know go see\nDr Ryan go see somebody else because\nthere are actual qualified professionals\nwho exist to help you work through all\nof that stuff and you can be codependent\nyou can have transference with that\nperson you can play out all of your\ninsecurities in that therapist's office\nand get those needs met and it's so much\nhealthier to do that with that person\nthan to try and do it with your\nrelationship because there are so many\ngood relationships that are ending\nsimply because of unrealistic\nexpectations and that's a tragedy\nwell yeah a lot there so Robert Johnson\nam I making really long monologues I\napologize this is great man I'm really\nenjoying talking with you so Robert\nJohnson is a jungian psychologist he\nwrote a book called we which is a really\nwonderful book it's about 100 pages long\npeople can read it in an afternoon and\nit's a jungian interpretation of the\nTristan and soldiment and basically his\nfundamental\nthesis is that romantic love is a\nconflation of the human and the Divine\nand that's symbolized by the magic\npotion that Tristan is sold a drink it's\nmade out of herbs so it's like natural\nand earthy but it also is magic so it's\nsupernatural and the danger comes when\nwe expect the other person to be more\nthan human or divine\nthat they can solve all of our problems\nthat they can make us complete that they\ncan make us happy and another person\ndoesn't and shouldn't and can't have\nthat kind of power over you unless you\ngive it to them inappropriately and\nthat's a disaster because we have to\nremember that in every classic romance\nin literature and history every classic\nromance ends in tragedy ends in death\nlike and that's because on some level\nthe Romantic idea is that the lovers can\nbe United at once only in the next life\nso\nit's not possible for romantic lovers to\nactually live happily ever after here\nthe Romantic narrative The Narrative Arc\nof romance is tragedy\nand that's why the Romantic cause is\nalways the one that's the underdog the\none that doesn't really have any chance\nof winning it's hard to root for the\nYankees unless you're from the Bronx\nthere you have no soul because they have\nyou know all those championships it it's\nhard to root for the\nthe thing that works the thing that's\nsuccessful people don't like to do that\nfor whatever reason now you mentioned\nsomething else though which is besides\nthe expectation\num you didn't use this word but what I\nthink you were getting at is like\nwounding\nso\nwhat was the word wounding like they\nhave emotion people have emotional\nwounds like maybe they had a [ __ ]\nrelationship with their mother and so\nnow they have [ __ ] relationships with\ntheir girlfriends like that's not an\naccident\nso what I've discovered and I have a\nvideo on this that's forthcoming is in\nmy own experience when I was in my 20s I\nhad this like Sixth Sense\nI could walk into a room full of woman\nwomen and just like be able to pick out\nthe one that I could ride the roller\ncoaster with because like my emotional\nwound would resonate in the presence of\na complementary emotional wound and we\nwould get together and we'd find\nourselves and be very passionate and\nintense because we were recreating the\ncircumstances that led to the wounding\nin a misguided attempt to heal the world\nyep and we were attracted to that not\nbecause it was good but because it was\nfamiliar yep and this is tough because\nthis goes back to Childhood stuff and\nchildren will accept any reality which\nthey're given they don't even really\nlike if a child is born and raised in\nchaos he will think that chaos is normal\nhe won't even think that it's chaos he\nwill just think that it's normal\nand so when he leaves the family where\nchaos makes sense he goes and tries to\nI'm a good boy I'm doing what you're\nsupposed to do in relationships which is\nto be chaotic and unpredictable and\nthis is all I've ever seen this is all\nI've ever known I thought this is what\nyou you do\num the fish can't see the water and so\nit's particularly difficult for people\nwho are raised in high conflict or\nbroken or dysfunctional families but it\nis possible to overcome that wounding to\nheal that wounding and overcome that\nprogramming and at 30 I mean hopefully\nyou have at least another 50 good years\nof life left so even if it takes a few\nyears to do it's like that's worth doing\nhow is he going to spend your time if\nnot working on this stuff yeah I guess\nyou'd have to take up knitting or\nsomething how are you doing now are you\nstill attracted to women based on your\nwounds no because what I found is that\nas I worked to heal that emotional\nwounding okay so this is the other part\nof it which is so I I'd have that sixth\nsense to the women that I could recreate\nthose dramas with and then they would\nget too crazy and I'd think I just can't\nhandle this anymore I just want a nice\nstable woman and just like in the\nRomantic myth I'd find that nice stable\nwoman and I would be bored to tears and\nI would think there's this isn't I don't\nfeel anything and so I felt for a long\ntime like I had this terrible choice\nbetween what I\nbut I was really attracted to but was\nterrible for me this is something that I\ndidn't really feel anything for but I\nknew was like healthy and mature\nneither one of them look on your face\nlike oh like a good woman who treats me\nwell what a what a drag Well yeah if you\neat junk food all your life you think\nthat you know vegetables are disgusting\nbut you know you see how it is so\nI had to like try to squeeze up some\nattraction for some of these stable\nwomen and that didn't work or I tried to\nmake the unstable women more\nso basically I had to change me because\nI couldn't change the women and as I\nprocess this stuff and healed it\nsurprise surprise my authentic\nattraction began to change like I didn't\nhave to try to be attracted to different\nwomen my authentic desire began to shift\nand I started to become attracted to\nemotionally stable secure women as I\nbecame more emotionally stable and\nsecure and holy [ __ ] does that solve a\nlot of problems\ngetting in you just never encounter them\nwhen you get into relationships with\nemotionally stable secure women oh man\nit's great oh so beautiful uh it's it's\njust that's the story of so many men you\nwhat you just put this so well and it's\na good reminder to me that like\nlike I'll admit I'm human sometimes I\nget frustrated at guys who are in that\nstage that you're out of like she's\ngreat but I'm bored I'm like what like\nlike\nyou know sort of do that but I love the\nfact that you actually articulated that\nthe desire naturally shifted once you\nmade that shift that's what that's what\nguys should be aspiring to and it's one\nof the reasons why I say\nlike I'm not a big fan of these guys who\nare just like living the player\nlifestyle like that's not my version of\nmasculinity is just [ __ ] a bunch of\nwomen because I've seen too clearly the\npsychological underpinnings of a man who\nneeds that kind of level of distraction\nand Novelty I'm not a big fan of\npolyamory I'm not because to me\nyou can see how\nbased on what you just said monogamy\nwith a good woman is almost a test of\ncharacter only somebody who's genuinely\ncomfortable and at peace inside\nthemselves and who's done that work is\ngoing to be able to unlock those innate\nfeelings of yes I actually like this I\nactually enjoy this and this is a fine\nline for me to walk because I'm very\nsensitive to accusations that I would\nshame male sexuality and I'm not doing\nthat I get it male brain new women\ndifferent body parts\nhugely stimulating I get the\nevolutionary psychology of it I'm never\ngoing to deny that even me 13 years into\na relationship a pretty girl comes up on\nthe TV screen I notice I get that but\nwhat I'm saying is that that doesn't\nnecessarily Trump out the stuff that Dr\nRyan was talking about that natural\naffection that natural love that Springs\nup when you're coming from a more\nemotionally healthy Place suddenly that\ndrama queen party girl that used to\nexcite you so much she just looks like a\nhot mess you just like [ __ ] no I don't\nwant to touch that I don't want to get\nthat in my space my nice clean\npsychologically pure space I don't want\nit contaminated with that kind of toxic\nlow quality woman anymore she's no\nlonger interesting oh look this girl\ntreats me nicely she smiles she pays me\ncompliments she asked me how my day was\nsuddenly I'm like able to appreciate\nthat in a whole new way and I hope that\neverybody aspires for that\nyeah I think I watched to John\nmulbaney uh stand up routine he's a\ncomedian and I think he opened with I\ndidn't know that relationships were\nsupposed to feel good and everybody\nlaughed and he was like that's not a\njoke that's just an observation uh and\nthis is the first time I was in a\nrelationship and it improved my quality\nof life and that's enough that's a\nlife-changing experience for a lot of\nguys for sure it kind of sorry to jump\nin but it I I really want to make this\npoint it kind of\nspeaks to the Primacy of our\npsychological need to heal those initial\nwounds in that if you've got a girl in\nfront of you and you could have a\nromantic connection with her but\nsubconsciously you're sabotaging it\nyou're picking fights you're provoking\nbehaviors what your brain is trying to\ndo is resolve those emotional wounds\nthat Dr Orion was talking about from\nearlier on and that just says everything\nthat how a big an impact this trauma\nstuff has on us in that when choosing\nbetween should we just enjoy the present\nmoment and have nice feelings of love or\nshould we make this a hell but it's a\nhell that's potentially going to heal\nthis deeper hell that's inside me the\nbrain moves towards this and so men\ndon't underestimate it men are way too\ncocky about their mental health you've\nprobably seen this like I'll just go to\nthe gym I'll just make a whole bunch of\nmoney I'll just [ __ ] enough women and\nthen that'll solve it it won't it won't\nyou gotta take this stuff seriously\nbecause if you don't when the time comes\nand you're in front of a good woman if\nyou haven't sorted your [ __ ] out you\n[ __ ] up the relationship you'll sabotage\nit because your brain so desperately\nneeds to heal this stuff and I've Just\nSeen sorry for getting a bit worked up\nbut I've seen so many requests in my hey\nhero in my patreon DMs from guys who\nhave [ __ ] up good relationships\nbecause they underestimated how messed\nup they were inside that they didn't\ntake it seriously and so I really really\nwant men to hear that message that if\nyou want to have a good relationship in\nthe future you can't half-ass this\nyou've got to sort yourself out\nrelationships with good women are a\nluxury of the men who've done the work\non themselves it's not available to\nanybody else the best that you're going\nto be able to have is a dysfunctional\nrelationship and as far as I can see\nthat's an absolute truth I've not seen\nit work otherwise\nyeah there's a lot there so the way I\nusually say it is that you can't solve\ninternal problems with external\nSolutions so if you have an inner wound\nor an internal void which is often how\nit's experienced you're going to try to\nfill it with money with drugs with TV or\nvideo games with food with sex and it\ndoesn't work\num that hole inside you is insatiable\nand it cannot be filled with something\nthat's external to itself but it can be\nfilled with something it can be healed\ninternally\nand um what you described about how\nmessed up guys\ngo to relationships\nand mess those up in similar ways in\nClinical Psychology we have a term for\nthat we call it\num a enactment or a reenactment and this\nhappens in the therapy office too and\nthere's this kind of a tragedy to this\nbecause\nthe the unconscious rationalization for\nthis behavior is okay I was really\nmessed up by this experience in the past\nand I can't go back and change the past\nso what I'm going to do is I'm going to\nrecreate the same emotional experience\nin the present so that I can work\nthrough it and have a different outcome\nthe tragedy is that most people haven't\nlearned the skills of being or relating\nto achieve a different outcome so what\nthey they have a lot of skills in\nrecreating the same situation they don't\nhave the skills to do anything\nand so they they're trying on this this\nwas an idea from Freud actually they're\ntrying unconsciously to solve these\nemotional problems by recreating the\nsame emotional experiences but they lack\nthe skills and the Transcendence to\nactually achieve a different outcome and\nso that's why they end up hitting their\nhead against the wall over and over\nagain but that's why a therapist is so\nvaluable in case people don't\nnecessarily understand it's not just oh\nI need someone to listen to my problems\nis because while you might lack the\nskills to resolve it you don't need\nthose skills yet you can turn up to a\ntherapist's office and just recreate all\nthat stuff in the relationship with a\ntherapist in a pure psychodynamic\nDynamic way and then the therapist will\ntalk you through how to resolve it they\nthey will because that's what they're\npaid to do that's what they're trained\nto do they're going to be the sensible\nones in the relationship and then\nthey'll help you fix that well a little\nlittle asterisk there that's what a good\ntherapist will do and unfortunately like\nany other profession there are some good\ntherapists there's some bad therapists\nand a lot of them are going to be\nmediocre so if you are going to go the\nroute of hiring a therapist it's on some\nlevel you actually kind of want to\napproach it like dating is that you\nmight have to talk to a number of people\nbefore you find somebody that clicks and\nthat will really help you and for those\nwho are interested in going down that\nroute\nyou don't have to try it for like three\nmonths or six months to see if it works\nI worked with a therap I worked with\nmany therapists and so I found the one\nthat really worked for me and I worked\nwith him for seven years in my 20s and\nI was\nuh I resonated with him from the very\nfirst session like he told me something\nand he clarified something to me in the\nsession in real time that I was never\nable to put quite into words and that\nsomething just sort of got unlocked and\nI knew that this was a relationship that\nheld something of promise for me versus\nother relationships I went in for six to\n12 months and at best they didn't make\nme worse you know so it is possible to\nhave a mediocre therapeutic experience\nwhat you described was your therapist a\nman\nhe was I've I've talked to one female\ntherapist for about 12 months and she\nwas one of the ones that didn't hurt me\nbut didn't particularly I didn't\nparticularly find very helpful\nI think that with a good female\ntherapist they can be really really\nuseful but what I've heard from a lot of\nguys is that they can't talk about the\nrelationship the dating the sex stuff\nwith a woman and actually get the kind\nof recognition that they need it's it's\njust too different and I do think that\nat a certain point we just need to sort\nof accept that it's like all right there\nare some mental health issues unique to\nmen that you need to speak to another\nman because without that feeling of oh\nI'm being seen and I'm being understood\nyou're not really going to trust the\nother person who's actually going to\nhave your back or or take any of his\nadvice or even work through it properly\nand so generally I advise men to see\nmale therapists if you've got a good\nfemale therapist don't give it up but\nbut typically that's been the advice\nthat I've given yeah I think that's true\nI I there are three topics in particular\nthat I think it's easier for a man to\ntalk to another man\nup in another one another woman and\nthose are sex power and aggression and\nthese are three things that are kind of\nat the core of a lot of masculine\nexperience especially the aggression\nlike\nsome men the only emotion they can\nconsistently identify and experience is\nanger and\nanger perceived by another man is likely\nexperienced very differently than anger\nperceived by a woman\nand it's it's so I think it's so much\nmore threatening for a woman to\nexperience\num male aggression and male anger\num doesn't necessarily mean it's going\nto spill over into violence but it can\nbe threatening and as a guy I think you\nhave to work through your anger it's\nit's like the easiest emotion for us to\nfeel but it's just you don't want to\nstay trapped there it's not like numb or\nor angry that's no way to live that's\nkind of like being a bull or some sort\nof\nviolent Beast it's it's not um human\nbut there's a lot of\num men that get trapped there because\nthey don't have any let's say\num sympathetic outlets for that for the\nbasis of their anger which is generally\npain an angry man is a man in pain\nand there's a lot of research that\nsuggests that depression in particular\nis expressed differently in men and\nwomen the depression that you read about\nin the DSM to diagnose statistical\nManual of mental disorders is more\ncorrelated with female presentation this\nis kind of like sad and moping around\nlow self-esteem low self-worth men can\nobviously get that too but there's\nincreasing evidence that men experience\nand manifest depression through like\nirritability and withdrawal and\nisolation and even self-destructiveness\nyep\nI agree with all that it makes me think\nabout the work that I do I run a couple\nof online men's groups\num and some of the guys that we've come\nacross who are shut down emotionally\nwe've used anger as a means of unlocking\nthose emotions and it can be a flood\nwhich is really really I remember one\nexercise where we kind of took turns you\nknow uh\nuh\nno I would yeah just because I feel like\nthere might be um\nviolating some privacy stuff so I\napologize for leaving people down a\nfalse Road there but I definitely agree\nwith everything you're saying anger is a\nbit of a secondary emotion and it's used\nto try and\nto give a sense of control I suppose and\nit can be quite a motivating emotion you\nknow like if you need to get [ __ ] done\nbeing angry is actually quite a good\nstate to be in but it's so difficult in\nthis culture because women don't\ntolerate male anger and there's so much\nShame about it and that's tough for a\nlot of men who are like but I feel angry\nand there's no Outlet it's like all\nright well\nin the first instance let's create an\nenvironment where one you can express\nsome anger with some other guys and\nwe're not going to shame you that's an\nimportant part but two we can also\nprovide the safety outlet that Dr Ryan\nwas talking about for you to talk about\nthe emotions that are underneath that\nanger and that's a difficult process for\na lot of guys because the fear\nI suppose the fear is that they're\nthey're not going to be able to shut it\noff and men don't like feeling like\nthey're not in control and I think\nthat's probably\nwhy as a whole the whole emotional side\nof life is a bit frightening to men\nbecause emotions are not as\nwithin our like autonomy and our Direct\nControl as like thoughts are you know\nand beliefs that we can analyze and\nreflect you know if it's like okay well\nwe're just going to feel all the pain\nthat exists inside you all of the\nsadness a lot of men like I have no idea\nhow deep that goes I don't know which\nway it's going to flow like that's\nthat's too frightening I can't sort of\nyou know let that happen and it's one of\nthe reasons why I'm passionate about the\nmen's group work we do because it's like\nwell we can provide some structure you\nknow what I mean we'll keep you grounded\nyou're not alone in this and I'm a\nstrong believer that very intense\nemotions probably shouldn't be\nexperienced by yourself I think that can\nlead to feelings of isolation and and\nand and shame and it's kind of bad you\nknow I'm a big fan of actually creating\nrelationships whether that's with a\ntherapist a girlfriend or in like a\nmen's group setting or anything like\nthat where those deeper emotions are\nexpressed in the company of somebody\nelse I think that's incredibly healing\nand I think that that's actually what\nour brains psychologically are wired for\nwell provided they're safe and\ntrustworthy because I would say that if\nthey're not it might be better to\nholster those emotions until you can\nfind somebody who is\nabout anger I usually say it's a um it's\na powerful servant but a terrible master\nand it can be a force that\nif you can yoke it appropriately can be\nincredibly motivating and effective but\nparadoxically even though men generally\nfeel more empowered or in control when\nthey give into anger they're much less\nso once they start to see red they're\nthe charging bull and it's really the\nbull fighter who's in control of that\nsituation whoever's waving the cape\nthat's going to control where the bull\ngoes and what the bull does and\nspoiler alert it doesn't usually end\nwell for the bull at the end of those\ncontests\nyeah yeah now to be fair um\nyou used to use the term secondary\nemotion yeah that's what we say in\nPsychology which basically means that\nanger very rarely arises spontaneously\nand of itself it's usually a reaction to\na more Primary Emotion like fear or\ngrief or pain\num that said there is a place for\num anger especially in depressants\nsome people believe that depression is\num appropriate anger that's\ninappropriately directed towards the\nself and so sometimes when you're\nworking with really clinically depressed\nfolks when they actually begin to\nexpress their frustrations with other\npeople it's a step in the right\ndirection\nokay yeah that don't make sense yeah\nthey probably shouldn't stay there but\nlike for the first time they're feeling\nsafe enough\nto express that anger because that's the\nother thing is that we can only express\nanger when we feel safe\nlike all these protests that we see in\nthe western world like that's kind of\nbecause these societies are fairly safe\nyou don't see that in North Korea\nor in other cultures it makes me think\nof parenting with like\n[Laughter]\na lady I know her teacher would tell her\nthat her daughter was so sweet at school\nand the mum's like God she gets home and\nshe's like angry about this and having\nattention about this and and I think\nthat's the symptom of what you're just\ntalking about is that she actually does\nhave those emotions of anger but\nschool's not the safe place for her to\nexpress that but at home where she's\ncomfortable familiar with the\nsurroundings and she knows her mum's\ngoing to love her no matter what it\ngives her that outlet to be able to\nexpress that anger and that's\nappropriate for children but one of the\num what I think I made a video about\nthis it's called the most toxic\nrelationship belief\nand the belief is basically in my\nrelationship I get to say and do and be\nwhoever I want like out there at school\nthat's where I have to control myself at\nwork that's where I have to put on the\nfront but when I come home I should just\nbe able to let it all out\nand I I think that's tough because what\nends up happening is that we tend to\ntreat the ones that are closest to us\nthe ones who treat us the best sometimes\nthe worst they see sides of themselves\nthat sides of us that maybe would be\nbest if they put on a little bit more of\nuh\num not necessarily A veneer but they had\na little bit more foresight into\nrevealing like I think of relationships\nas roles and I think the only time you\nreally truly get to be yourself is when\nyou're by yourself and like it's\ninappropriate for you when you're\nengaging with your daughter you're in\nthe father role so are there certain\nthings that are appropriate for you to\ndo and probably inappropriate for you to\ndo when you're engaging with your\npartner you're in the husband role and\nthat comes with certain privileges and\nresponsibilities but the idea that I\nshould just be able to be myself warts\nand all no matter what and expect you to\nto love and cherish me I think that's\ntough because it can feel like they\ntreat the Stranger On The Bus better\nthan us and that's um not a good place\nto be in it's the trade of a low quality\nwoman is really good love everything you\njust said and just to add on to it is\nthat she mistakes the expression\nsometimes the obnoxious expression of\nher pain in the form of anger blame\ninsults as though she's just being\nauthentic she's being real something\nlike that and it's a [ __ ]\nrationalization used to abuse somebody\ninnocent I think it's totally [ __ ] up\nand I have really no tolerance for it I\ncan understand if you've never come\nacross this information maybe once or\ntwice but when you see the impact it has\non your partner you really should cut it\nout straight away so this goes for any\nmen who are listening if you do this to\nyour partnership as well you can't just\nbe angry and like yelling and blaming\nthem for stuff and being like well I'm\njust being authentic I'm just being real\nno you're being a dick you need to cut\nthat out what the obligation for you if\nyou want to be real in a relationship is\nyou need to find out well what is the\nprimary emotion and if it's sadness if\nit's fear you need to communicate that\nnot in a way that blames the other\nperson in a way that brings them in and\nand and and enlist them as an ally as a\nteammate you know like if you did feel\nreally angry about something okay you\nmight you know say a few sentences and\nthen she'll be like whoa what the hell\nyou need to take a moment you need to\nstep away and then come back and be like\nyou know what I actually think I'm just\nscared that you know we're not as close\nas we used to be or that I'm scared I'm\nnot making enough money and I'm just I'm\nI'm taking it out and then she's like oh\nlike I'm here for you I hear that let's\nwork through it and then suddenly you're\nnot in competition with each other\nyou're not trying to recreate it or or\npush some [ __ ] drama or something\nlike that it's like no you're actually\nworking towards the solution so any guys\nout there who think that it's their job\nas the man to like listen while their\ntheir partner is like raving and ranting\nand insulting and and having tantrums\nand things like that no she's not being\nreal you're not privileged or anything\nlike that she's being obnoxious and\nentitled and you don't have to put up\nwith it you you can demand actual\nauthenticity and that requires her being\nvulnerable because there's not really\nany vulnerability in anger and if you're\nnot being vulnerable then she's not in\nreality and what progress can you\nactually make unless you're the two of\nyou are actually in reality\nokay so this might be a Point of\nDeparture that we may have\num because the way that you're\ndescribing it is\num\nuh like The Importance of Being\nemotionally vulnerable with your partner\nnot necessarily just spewing every\nthought or feeling out the moment that\nyou have it without a sensor or without\nany kind of processing\nbut to bring your emotional\nvulnerability to your partner and to\ndiscuss that and resolve that in\ncollaboration potentially and I think\nthat\nthat possible\nin relationship and it's probably only\npossible though in very high functioning\neffective communicators with emotional\nstability do you would you agree with\nthat\nyes but I feel like I might be being led\ninto a trap like I want to know where\nyou're going sure so one of one of the\nconcepts that I have is that\num the captain can't complain\nand this\nI I kind of approach relationships from\nthe perspective that the man is the\nleader of the relationship yeah and so\nthat it's not a pure equality and that\nthere is a hierarchy in the relationship\nand there are Privileges and\nresponsibilities that come with both of\nthose positions like ideally the woman\nis like the first mate it's a very\nelevated position\nthey offer feedback in counsel and a\ngood Captain will take that under\nconsideration but it's ultimately his\ncall\nfor the good of the ship which is the\nnuclear family that he is leading and\none of the the resp the let's say the\nresponsibilities of a captain\nis that he's like roll-bound not to\nshare his troubles with the subordinates\nwith with the crew as it were because\none thing that women are really good at\ndoing is they're sort of like good at\nincubating and then reflecting back it's\nlike in every culture and every\nmythology that I'm aware of the moon is\nfeminine and what is the moon though it\nreflects the light of the sun which in\nevery culture that I'm aware of is the\nmasculine and so it's like the woman\nwill take what the man gives it\nand like incubate it and give it back to\nhim and shine it back to him you give a\nwoman a little sperm she'll give you\nback a baby kind of a thing but if you\ngive her a little ounce of trouble or a\nlittle ounce of fear or insecurity she\nmight bring that back to you in a in a\nmuch more Amplified way\nso my perspective is as a man you are\ngoing to have fears you are going to\nhave concerns but it might be more\nappropriate to bring that to your fellow\ncaptains like other men that you have\ntrusted relationships with or your\nfather or your therapist\num then necessarily your first mate what\ndo you think about that\nI think many things about that uh\nI need to approach this quite delicately\nI understand the the point that you make\nand the general trend of it and I\ndisagree with the ultimate outcome and I\ndisagree for heaps of reasons and I'm a\nlittle surprised that we're going to\ndepart on this one but I think this will\nbe very worthwhile to find out if we get\nto the end of this if I change my mind\nor if you change yours or if we just\noffer two alternate perspectives and let\nthe audience decide that's also\ncompletely fine\nso the first thing that I would say is I\nwould not personally enjoy being in a\nrelationship if I could not be real with\nmy partner that's one of the biggest\nJoys I get from my relationship is the\nability to\nbe vulnerable and to feel cared for by\nher and if I felt like I was unable to\ndo that I would significantly like like\nrelation my relationship would be a lot\nless enjoyable so I think that one of\nthe dangers of your advice is that\nyou're selling women short on what\nthey're capable of doing and then so\ndoing selling men's short and that if\nthey follow your advice they're not\ngoing to reach the full Heights of\npleasure that's possible in a\nrelationship because they're\nartificially handicapping themselves\nit's one of the first thoughts that\ncomes up to me but I feel like that's\nnot really worth discussing at the\nmoment because first we need to discuss\nwhether or not that's true what you've\nsaid is that women are destined to do\nthat and I think that that's one of the\ndangers of applying a whole bunch of\nTruth which you just did and then making\na kind of what I would say is like a\nleap into an outcome as though it's it's\nabsolutely predestined to be this way\nbut I have to tread a little bit\ncarefully\nand actually figure out why I think this\nwell the first instance is that because\nit just doesn't track with my experience\nso maybe I'll just safely speak from\nthat is that\nwhen I\ncorrectly identify the true source of\num an emotion and I can bring it to my\npartner in a vulnerable sense it does\nnot frighten her it reassures her it\ndemonstrates that I'm capable of\nself-reflection that I take\nresponsibility for the actual source of\nwhat's going on for me and I trust her\nto know that information and to treat it\ndelicately and then we resolve it right\nthen and there so it doesn't linger as\nan issue so it serves as an incredibly\nstrong process of pair bonding for the\ntwo of us and we're so much closer\nbecause of it I can't relate to the\npicture that you just spoke about of a\nwoman taking those things and then\nleaving with relate God to my own\npartner to me that just sounds like a\nwoman who's not emotionally mature\nenough to be able to handle real\nintimacy uh like a low quality woman\nstuff and I'm sort of like well I\nwouldn't be interested in dating a woman\nwho didn't have that basic human\ncapacity\nokay I mean you have some points there\nyou might be right maybe this is a way\nthat we can approach a common ground on\nthis um\nthere's a difference potentially between\nuh for a man going to his woman and\nsaying I'm afraid I'm feeling really\ninsecure about money and that's causing\nme to like lose sleep and to worry about\nour future yeah and a guy who comes to\nhis woman says I'm feeling I've been\nfeeling concerned about money in our\nfinancial future\nand so I've taken\nis my plan and I have this idea for\nresolving this anxiety in a like\nreality-based way but I'm not and the\ndifference I think is not just I'm I'm\nbringing my\nmy feelings I'm also beginning to work\ntowards the solution and I think that\ncan make things more reassuring for the\nwoman\nyeah so and I'll put it let me try and\nrephrase what you said and you tell me\nif you agree with my rephrasing is that\nyou can't ever bring your emotions to a\nwoman in a codependent way you can't\never bring your vulnerability to\nexpecting her to solve it if that's\ninteresting by codependent yeah you\ndon't you can't expect your woman to\nsolve your problems yes and so a lot of\nguys I maybe this is where we might have\nsome commonality they might bring the\nfear to the woman hoping that like a\ngood mommy she will assuage his fear and\nyeah everything is going to be okay and\nrub his back and I believe in you\nand that might actually undermine the\ntrust and confidence in his leadership\nif there's enough repetitions of that\nexactly okay I think we might be on the\nsame page and I really do hope people\ndon't click add this video let us\nresolve this discussion because actually\nwhere we end up on this one is going to\nbe really really important\nso I I definitely agree with that and it\nwas difficult for me to make the points\nI was making earlier because I'm aware\nthat people could misinterpret what I've\nsaid and do what I do with my\nrelationship and they could do it badly\nthey could do it in a codependent way\nand for the most part people need to\nfollow your advice because my read on\nthe general male population is there's\ntoo many you know\nwhat not simply kind of looking for\ntheir girlfriends to be their mother's\nkind of energy around there and there\nneeds to be a lot more taking\nresponsibility I guess I don't want\npeople to\nthink of their relationships as going to\nbe limited to when I'm struggling I\ncan't talk to my partner about it that's\nthat's not appropriate and here's the\nI really hope people listen quite\ncarefully because here's the Nuance of\nit sometimes the solution to an emotion\nor vulnerability that you're\nexperiencing doesn't have a clear\npractical piece of action that needs to\ntake to resolve it sometimes the\ncompassionate witnessing by your partner\nis the solution there's an emotion\nthere's a vulnerability that you felt\nyour entire life and it's never been\nseen understood or cared about by\nanybody and when you bring that to your\npartner in a sense you're coming to them\nfor a solution but it's not any deeper\nother than I just discovered this about\nmyself and I want to share it with you\nand then you discover that in them\nlistening and caring about that you're\nlike oh my God\nI'm no longer carrying this burden of\nthis emotion I considered shameful by\nmyself anymore I was able to demonstrate\nit in front of a person I love and Trust\nthey still love me in return I'm just\nfeeling one percent more acceptable\ninside myself problem solved you know\nthat's the kind of fix and so we're kind\nof talking about levels here in the\nfirst stage of a relationship when\nyou're still working through this\ncodependency you need my girlfriend to\nMother you followed the advice Dr Ryan\nyou know Orion gave it's really really\ngood take responsibility for it keep it\nin your frame don't be codependent but\nalso once you're in a relationship and\nthat's established she loves you she\ntrust you you're committed don't limit\nyourself and hold yourself back from\npotential pair bonding experiences that\ncould be really really amazing for your\ngrowth really really Inspire more\nloyalty and trust and love with each\nother these parts of yourself that\npreviously like no I can't show with\nthat I can't show her that if you love\nand trust this girl and she's your\npartner and the issues you're dealing\nwith are just existential things to do\nwith the universe you could make the\nboth of you feel way less lonely if you\nactually open up and trust and there's\nan experience of pleasure that comes\nfrom that that I would never trade for\nanything it's probably I dare say it\nmight be my favorite thing about my\nrelationship and so that might be why I\nunnecessarily jumped the gun in the\ninitial conversation I thought we were\ncoming from different places because I\nassume what you're talking about was\nlike never had that and I was like [ __ ]\nlike that's not where I'm coming from at\nall but I I don't think well I'll let\nyou respond now but I don't think we're\nactually on different pages as much as I\nthought that we were not as much I I do\nthink that was very well said and course\nyou need to need to bring\nconcerns and your issues to your partner\na captain\nif there's water coming into a ship he\ncan't pretend that it's not sinking\nsaid he can't just evolve into panic and\nhope to be reassured by his crew he has\nto keep his wits about him and spring\ninto action in a reality-based way to\nsolve a problem but what you're getting\nat is um very\num emotionally\nAdvanced it's yeah and it's something\nthat you can definitely do with a a\nmature woman who is effective an\neffective Communicator who's emotionally\nattuned and in a trusting loving\nrelationship and this sharing of\nyourself with each other is actually an\nimportant component of becoming yourself\nI think this is why in like the in all\n12-step programs part of the process is\nto admit to another person and to God\nthat you have a problem it's like you\nneed to be able to overcome the shame\nof the hiding and the isolation\nand reveal yourself to another person in\na safe and appropriate context in order\nto move in the direction of becoming\nmore yourself and overcoming the\naddiction that you're struggling with so\nI think that's was actually very well\nsaid on your part\num\ncan I jump in and just say that was very\nawkward that I had to do that because I\nwould never really talk about that in my\nYouTube videos I would never make a\nvideo about that because what I said was\nso easily misunderstood and it's hard to\nprotect against that I think a lot of\nguys will take what I said and think oh\ngood I can now look for my girlfriend to\nsolve my problems for me you know what I\nmean like it is quite an emotionally\nAdvanced thing and because I do think\nthat too many men are doing that it's\nnot the kind of thing that I'd usually\nsay publicly like because of its\npotential to be misunderstood it's more\nsomething that would come about in like\na one-on-one like like if I was helping\nsomebody out and they were at that kind\nof stage but um\nwhat I would also say so it was I was it\nwas interesting being put on the\nreceiving end of like God 99 of the time\nI would be saying exactly what you're\nsaying but it's just in this one\ninstance I'm like no I think you can be\neven greedier I think you can get even\nmore out of your relationships so it was\nquite an interesting exchange for me\nyeah okay I I think that was again very\nwell said\num what was I going to say about this\nI'm just gonna jump in but I think I\nlost it if it's important it'll come\nback can I say it's\nit's exciting I suppose that the\nconversation for me is being pushed in\nthis direction because I don't think\nthat there's\nlike in terms of like men's advice\nonline from the little I've seen it's\nvery very surface level and one of the\nthings that excites me about the fact\nthat like you reached out to chat to me\nand I look at your channel there's been\nsuch like tremendous growth and like\npeople are watching your stuff is\nit makes me feel like this information\nabout the differences between men and\nwomen is going more mainstream if we can\ntake a guy like you who had a successful\nyou know private therapy practice and\nnow you're like this is so important\nthat I'm going to start a YouTube\nchannel about it and I'm going to talk\nto a man about these differences about\ndating stuff and I was interviewed on\nanother podcast that Emily and Todd\npodcast and Todd again it's a guy from\nNew York and he has a successful private\ntherapy practice and I'm like cool like\nseven years ago you know it's guys like\nme who don't have any formal education\nin Psychology or just really passionate\namateurs we're making videos but you\nknow we're kind of more On The Fringe\nand it's it's it's exciting to me that\nguys with more mainstream credibility\nare coming into this space and dare I\nsay potentially bringing more reality\nless histrionic kind of emotionality in\nvictimhood and tribalism you know to it\num so look I just I like that last\nexchange there is the I feel like is a\ngood example of the conversation in this\nspace hopefully elevating more and more\nand more with the introduction of people\nlike you coming in oh thank you but I\nthink there's also ways in which the\nmainstream media and the mainstream\nprofessions really fail people as well\nand that's what I've always loved about\nYouTube is the Democratic potential of\nthe medium and I I do think that\nultimately it should be\num the the truth and the validity of\nwhat is being said that should matter\nmore than the credentials or the\nauthority of whoever is saying it and\nI guess it's nice that here I am a\nlicensed psychologist who's saying some\nof these things maybe that means that\nsome people will listen because I have\nthe degrees and the diplomas but\nultimately the truth of anything that I\nsay or anything that you say is\nis does it bear with reality and does it\ndoes it work like does the plane fly\nwhen we follow these laws\nand I think that it's really important\nfor me and for other folks to not\ndevolve to arguments of authority and to\nbelieve that just because I have this\ntraining where I have this degree that I\nnecessarily know more than somebody else\num that's not the case and I think that\nwe can all get better at evaluating\narguments on their own Merit independent\nof the sources from which they arise and\nthat's\nreally the possibility of democratic\nmediums like social media and a way of\nmoving towards integration of our\nincreasingly polarized Society it's like\nwe should be able to take the truth on\nboth sides or all sides because there's\nmore than just two sides and\num use that to improve our lives and to\nincrease Harmony in our relationships\nso two things is one is I very much\nagree with you on the appeals to\nAuthority argument but my point was more\nthat reality does come first but now\nlook at people coming to reality that's\nexciting\num so that's compromacy but I'm a little\nbit more cynical about\num the sort of meritocracy argument that\nyou just made about social media I think\nit's true in certain Pockets but what\nI've seen becomes popular on social\nmedia is not necessarily what's true\nit's what\ntriggers emotions what validates\nvictimhood what inspires tribalism often\nthe things that kind of become really\npopular bear no bearing to reality\nreality is actually kind of shunned it's\nactually what's convenient you know and\nthings like that I do think that certain\nPockets you know and I would with no\nfalse humility consider myself and your\nchannel as well to be part of those\npockets of the reason they're popular is\nbecause they're hitting truths and it's\nlike oh no that's why we're taking off\nand and having some success but but I\nkind of see that more as the exceptions\nso the sort of so-called like virtue of\ndemocracy of social media I'm not so I'm\nnot so thrilled about I'm a little bit\nmore inclined I think maybe even than\nyou are and maybe if you spend seven\nyears on YouTube like I have you might\nbecome more cynical like me but I quite\nlike the idea that some of this stuff is\na little bit more\nthere's a little bit more gatekeeping\ninvolved you know what I mean because\nthere's so much fake information online\nand so much stuff that seems true and\nseems knowledgeable but actually isn't\nand the misinformation causes a lot of\nstuff I actually do prefer that people\nhave some kind of I know what I'm\ntalking about I'm talking like and it's\nthis and I don't mean that to become an\nappeals to Authority I just think that\nmaybe there's a bit of a middle ground I\nhear what you're saying and there's\ncertainly truth to that like\nI know that if I made more extreme or\ninflammatory content I would have far\nmore subscribers than I currently do but\nthat's just not how I want to operate I\nthink that if you have understanding of\nthese media and marketing and\npositioning you can grow very quickly\nand have like a more acute influence but\nI think that these tend to be more flash\nin the pan they they don't tend to last\nas long I think the truth is slower to\ncatch on but it's harder to get rid of\nso so good so that channels that are\nreally more concerned about that they\ngrow more slowly because they generally\ngrow through word of mouth as opposed to\nlike paid promotion or marketing efforts\nand\num they're very different once like the\ntruth is the hardest virus to eliminate\nand because once a person hears it they\nnever forget it and one\ntruth told to a person at the right time\ncan be life-changing\nso I I really do think that on the whole\nthere's probably more\nopportunity to social media than\num liability\nI do remember the thing I was going to\nsay so to just go to put a maybe a cap\non the conversation about let's say\num emotional intimacy with your partner\nthat it's also really really important\nto emphasize that this is only\nappropriate in a safe and trusting\nrelationship with a woman that you\nvetted because what I've often seen is\nthat\neven when I would go out on first dates\nsometimes when women found out that I\nwas a therapist they would start just\nlike spilling their purse on the table\nand talking about how they had DUIs and\ntheir father abused them and it's like\nwow I talked to guys and they have these\nlike 12 hours First Dates 12 hour second\ndates where they stay up all night and\nthey just talk about their childhood\ntraumas and their dreams for the future\nand it's like that is way too much too\nsoon you don't know who this person is\nyou don't know what they're going to do\nwith you or\num your vulnerability and it is a\nshortcut to like let's say accelerate\nthe intimacy of the relationship but it\nmight not be appropriate and these sorts\nof relationships they tend to be uh you\nknow the ones that burn twice as bright\nburn for half as long kind of a thing\nthey get really intense very quickly and\nthen they tend to flare out in really\ndramatic and high conflict ways so that\nthe vulnerability disclosure is is not\nappropriate until you're much further\nalong in the relationship would you\nagree with that so strongly so strongly\nagree with that that so it's such a\ndamaging idea to open up too quickly too\nsoon because you're likely to get burned\nand guess what happens then all your\ntrust issues all your trauma you're\ngoing to bury them even deeper it's\ngoing to be harder to dislodge so it\njust makes me sad listening to the\ndescription that you gave though because\nit just speaks to how much pain that\npeople are living in because they must\nknow rationally that this is not a smart\nidea you haven't vetted this person yet\nwhat are you doing spilling your guts\nbut if they're that desperate to find\nsomebody and to finally speak about this\nstuff they're being driven to that even\nthough it's completely irrational to do\nso and that's that's really depressing\nthat that's where people are at but it's\nnot going to work there's a level of\ndisclosure emotional disclosure that's\nappropriate at the start of a\nrelationship and it's very very small\nmostly you want to be having fun like\nflirt tease you know have some laughs be\na bit sexual like that's what the start\nof a relationship should look like and\nthen later on it's like okay we like\neach other's energy we like each other's\nVibe you know what about values can we\nactually talk like what kind of a life\ndo you imagine it's like oh there's\nactually some similarities all right I'm\ngoing to invest a little bit further and\nit's really only once you're in an\nestablished relationship like okay like\nif we're gonna do this there's some\nthings I'd like to you know explore with\nyou it's like this thing happened to me\nwhen I was a kid you know I'm taking\ncare of it but you should know and she's\nlike thank you so much for sharing with\nme I don't think any less if you're not\nall right cool I dipped my toe in the\nwater it went well next time I'll go a\nlittle bit further it's got to be\nsensible timed based on the feedback\nthat you're getting if you're just like\ntrauma dumping on people you're only\ngoing to traumatize yourself further\nit's a really bad strategy and also\nwomen don't find it attractive you know\nwomen like just straight up you're not\ngoing to keep women if you do that\nbecause women are not attracted to men\nwho don't have control of themselves in\nthis way who can't read basic social\ncues and know that that's not\nappropriate you've got to come across as\nmasculine on top of your stuff you know\nwithin your frame\nso yeah total disaster I agree with\neverything you said yeah that's that's\ninteresting in therapy we have this term\ncalled an emotionally disconfirming\nexperience and that's when a person is\nable to do the thing that he's afraid of\nand the outcome is non-terrible and\ntherefore he can let go of a lot of the\nbaggage around the thing and that's\nactually what changes people not\ninsights not like learning that oh my\nmom did this and my dad did that\nnot necessarily paying a therapist\nhundreds or thousands of dollars it's\nabout having emotionally disconfirming\nexperiences and you can have those with\na therapist but there's always a part of\nyou that knows that this is like a paid\nprofessional that you're doing it with\nso the real\nthe real way that people get better is\nto have that emotionally disconfirming\nexperience in the real world is that\nthey can go out there and let's say they\nhave terrible approach anxiety they can\ngo up to a woman and\nit's a non-terrible experience maybe\neven a positive experience and that is\ngoing to be worth more than 10 therapy\nsessions\num that said you have to create the\ncontext\nthat makes it more likely that they will\nit will be a successful\nsituation you know so if you run off\nhalf cocked and you just approach a\nwoman willy-nilly it might actually end\nup badly and then that reinforces your\npre-existing beliefs about women\num same thing with the trust issues that\nyou were saying so uh yes there is a\npossibility to be healed in our\nrelationships but in general we should\ntry to do as much healing on our own as\npossible before we seek out\nrelationships with others that's that's\nmy belief\nbut like like we've established those\nemotionally disconfirming experiences\nthat are so much more transformative\nthan just insights they happen in\nrelationships they do so I mean it's one\nof the reasons I'm so passionate about\nthe men's group I call them hero circles\nthat I run\num\nbecause it's not just me who is somewhat\nlike the facilitator or whatever but\nthere's a bunch of other guys and so\nwhen they're having these experiences of\nI've never shared this with anybody it's\nthere's regular dudes who are all you\nknow disconfirming that that's a\nshameful thing they're like no man we\nhear you we love you it's all still good\nit's very very transformative and that's\nwhy the the focus for me as the\nfacilitator is away from intellectual\ndiscussions and trying to find insights\nand more is into experiential\nrelationship stuff because coming from\nthe kind of psychodynamic kind of like\nplace that I come from like to me that's\nwhere the real transformation comes from\nit's so much more interesting I\nfacilitated a lot of groups\num as a therapist and\nthere's a lot of evidence that suggests\nthat the outcomes from group therapy are\nsuperior to the outcomes in individual\ntherapy I believe it group therapy is\nreal the idea of group therapy is really\nscary to people who have never\nexperienced it but it's so the potential\nfor\naccelerated transformation is\nunparalleled and the reason there's a\nfantastic book by um a group therapist\nnamed Irvin yalam who was yeah I love\nthat book I've read it so much yeah yeah\nthat book is fantastic and he has a\nwhole chapter about the mechanisms that\nare unique to group therapy that help\npeople improve in that modality and one\nof them is just that another dude not a\ntherapist not a trained or paid\nprofessional just another human being\njust like you says dude I have the same\nproblem\nand it's like that normalizing\nexperience of opening up thinking that\nyou were the only one who was\nsuffering from this in the entire\nuniverse and then being met with like\ncompassion understanding from somebody\nwho's not being paid to do that is\nreally incredible\nso there's a great potential in group\ntherapy it's hard people are very scared\nabout group therapy usually before they\ntry it but it can be a great thing I'm\nsuch a strong believer I read the book\ngroup by Christy Tate and it really blew\nmy mind and then I read I read a bunch\nof yolom's books but I bought the big\nfat like textbook yeah it's it's a long\none it's it's a long one but as I as I\nread it I was just like [ __ ] this is\nas far as I could tell based on my 35\nyears of living on this planet the stuff\nhe was talking about offered the best\nmost sensible way to achieve Mass change\nfor a bunch of people those conditions\nand so even though what I offer in these\nhero circles is not therapy because I'm\nnot a licensed therapist I say the\neffect is therapeutic because we borrow\nheavily from that stuff as we support\neach other\nright on well I think that's probably a\ngood place\nday Alex\nand it's been a wonderful conversation\num if people want to know more about you\nwhere should they go\ncan I Beady greedy and bring up one more\ntopic before we wrap it up if you like\nsure how comfortable are you talking\nabout your personal relationship did you\ntalk about on your Channel not usually I\ndon't usually talk about my personal\nrelationship and that's just out of like\nconcern for the woman's privacy I've\nalready noticed that people are\nsearching out who this person might be\nand I want to kind of like maybe protect\nher from that on some on some level I\nget it man I spent six years on YouTube\nbefore I told anybody I was in a\nrelationship just like complete blank as\nfar as anybody knew I was single and\nthen at some point I was like\nI don't mind anymore what I I just I\ndidn't feel as vulnerable about it like\nbut I'm a very intensely private person\nso even though\nI have a bunch of questions and I'm sure\npeople would appreciate the questions\nI'm going to ask I was gonna ask I think\nit's more important that you've got some\nboundaries so I'm not going to push we\ncan we can wrap things up okay\num well I am in a relationship it's a\ncommitted relationship and we've been\ndating for several years now and um I'm\nvery happy with the way things are going\nso I'll leave it at that can we ask one\nquestion like how does she feel about\nyour YouTube channel\nis that too personal no not at all um\nshe's she follows yeah me and I think\nshe watches every single thing I\nprobably wow she's a very supportive\num partner are you watching right now\nOrion's girlfriend are you listening to\nmy words right now probably like she she\nwatches the long-form interviews as well\nso um she has always been supportive of\nwhat I've what I'm doing here uh I think\nwhen I've\nso and a lot of this is my ideas about\nwomen and relationships and so\num it's out there you know it's not like\nI'm hiding this from her uh I think when\nI've talked to her about this in the\npast she says you know I\num disagree with some of the things that\nyou say Orion but you also bring up\nthings that I've never thought about and\nso it's useful for me to consider it\nfrom your perspective\nso it's never caused any kind of\ndifficulty or conflict in my\nrelationship my YouTube channel\nI'm particularly curious to know what\nyou would think of the exchange that we\njust had about the nature of emotional\nintimacy like if you were to go to her\nand just like I've just had this\nexistential fear of death come over and\nI just can't help but feel kind of\npanicked and I don't know what to do\nwith it would she be like yo Captain\nwhat the [ __ ] I'm the crewmate you\nshould not be talking to me about this\nor would she be like oh my God I have\nthat sometimes as well I feel so much\ncloser to you like I I'm I'm very\ncurious to know how she would feel about\nwhat you talked about and your\nrelationship well on that particular\nnote I don't think it would come as a\nsurprise so anybody who knows me\npersonally knows that I keep momentum\nworry very close to Heart I've had\nseveral near-death experiences and I\nsuffered a lot of like loss and death of\nloved ones when I was young so I don't\nreally go a day without thinking about\ndeath and that is actually what acutely\nmotivates me to stay focused on what's\nimportant and to move in the direction\nof what I truly value\num so that would not come as any\nsurprise to her if I said that having\nsome existential dread and do you feel\nlike it's made her lose attraction for\nyou or do you think it's helped Bond you\nsharing those things with her to be\nhonest on this particular point I don't\nthink that she it's almost like a\ndisconnect she does not she is not as\nfar as I can tell\nwhat she's told me she hasn't yet\nexperienced that kind of\nexistential concern yes I think it's\nonly a matter of time but she's also you\nknow she her family is very intact her\nparents are still together she has\nuncomplicated loving relationships with\nher siblings\nshe has never really experienced any\nkind of significant suffering or\nhardship yet so she's on some level been\nprivileged by her life thus far but on\nsome level she's also been handicapped\nbecause I think that it can\nprevent her from understanding certain\ndimensions of experience I found this to\nbe the fact among my friends as well so\nI have I have friends who I call normies\nwho they just don't understand certain\nthings that I've gone through\num they think that this only happens in\nmovies or in soap operas\nand let me tell you the truth sometimes\nis Stranger Than Fiction but if people\nhave never experienced how chaotic or\nhow\nterrible\nrelationships can be or how life how\ndifficult and painful life can be\num it's almost like does not compute it\ndoesn't really get in at best or they\nget a little uncomfortable at worse\nbecause they kind of have this dim\nawareness that those things exist and\nthey're they don't want to really\nexperience them yet and they hope that\nthey can\nprevent them for as long as possible\nso we\nwe are very different with respect to\ncertain emotional and psychological\ntraits yeah but I think we're\ncomplementary in that regard\nyou almost want to preserve that\ninnocence for as long as possible Right\nlike you don't really want to infect\nsomebody with\nthat reality of like if somebody is not\ndealing with an existential fear of\ndeath like every single day you're\nalmost like why would I ruin that right\nbut there is a real gift\nto that momentum Warrior because it does\nsharpen your focus and keeps you\nmotivated it's also easy to let stuff go\num I think it's easier to have more\ncompassion for yourself and for other\npeople\num but I'm her first relationship I mean\nso that's\nhow old is she she's 30. okay\nI'm not robbing the cradle oh I know\nyou're a four-year-old dude like her\nfirst relationship all right this could\ntake a 10. 30 is fine\nso we have very different relationship\nexperiences we have very different life\nexperiences and that's okay\nI think that's great\nyeah no that's cool oh man I thank you\nfor sharing what you just did share with\nme\num\nI like I I obviously I'm I'm now excited\nto have like a deeper relationship with\nyou in whatever form that might happen\nin that like I'm now curious to find out\nwhat commonalities the two of us have\nhad in our personal lives and share\nabout that this is probably not the\nappropriate platform to do that but\num no it makes me happy Alexander I'd\nlove to get to know you socially and\nmaybe we can be friends as well oh cool\nI gotta say it's\nwhen I started if I can just be\nself-indulgent but seven years ago on\nYouTube I really did feel like alone\nlike like isolated in that I was like in\nmy mind I was like okay let's take the\nbest of this manisphere type stuff the\nstuff that's true and then let's talk\nabout how it fits into all the\nmainstream psychological stuff which is\nnot controversial it's been established\nand then that's kind of how my channel\nsort of fused together but I was very\nalone in that like the people who would\nlike say these are your colleagues I see\ntheir stuff and I'm like I don't feel\nlike I have anything in common with that\nperson at all like I don't get where\nthey're coming from they seem to be such\na hateful individual I don't like it\nwhatsoever more and more recently the\npeople who seem to be coming up and\nbecoming more popular on YouTube like\nyourself I'm like man I [ __ ] love\nthis guy like I hope their Channel\nbecomes huge like I hope these are my\nnew like YouTube colleagues and in that\nvein I don't know if you've come across\nthis stuff yet have you seen the YouTube\nchannel wheat waffles\nuh no but I think I've the name has come\nup in my uh comments\nokay so uh like he's a guy I've got to\nknow a little bit off screen as well\nsome of his stuff I really disagree with\nbut he's a good guy like he's a really I\nthink he's got a lot of Integrity he's\nvery intelligent and he presents the\nblack pill look stuff\nin his clean irrational way as you\npossibly can I just wanted to mention\nhis name to you as a as a future\npossible guest for your podcast\num I would definitely watch that he's a\nfascinating guy to chat to oh I can do\nit but yeah one of the great things\nabout the Channel Growing is that it\ngives me the opportunity to connect with\npeople like yourself and that's been\nreally fulfilling for me personally is\nto expand my social network Beyond just\nmy private recording studio and my\nlittle you know Cotter of pre-existing\nrelationships to really I mean here you\nare you're in Australia I'm in\nCalifornia we're connecting from\nopposite ends of the Earth because we\nhave\nsome points of commonality and shared\nvision and resonance and that's an\namazing thing that just wouldn't have\nbeen possible even a generation ago and\nI think that's for me personally the\nreal opportunity of this channel is that\nit can uh\nhe can get me in contact with folks and\nto potentially build relationships with\npeople that\num are just gonna light me up that I'm\ngoing to be jazzed to know and to talk\nto and spend time with\nso that's a selfishly part of why I'm\ndoing this\noh I've made amazing relationships um\nthrough the channel I think you know\nBlair Daley the guy who does the the\ncommission for boys and men in Seattle\nWashington oh yeah I did he sponsored a\na video of mine I think I called it\ndivide and conquer\nuh and it was about the the pressures\nthat\nkeep men and women pitted against each\nother or see that men's issues and\nwomen's issues are zero-sum games\num like he's such a good guy and he's\ndoing such amazing work and I've known\nhim for years he was an early supporter\non my channel even did some filming for\nme back when I was still doing like\nStreet interviews just to get oh really\nhe was one of the guys who went out\nhe was he was one of the best yeah his\nvideos that he filmed for me got\nhundreds of thousands of of views it was\nfantastic but like I've known him for a\nnumber of years and he's an ongoing\nsupporter he reached out to me on\npatreon when I said like oh I'm gonna be\nchatting with the guy from psychex um Dr\nOrion he's like I know him he's great\ntell him that you know me and stuff like\nthat and I just had dinner with um a guy\nhas been uh you know messaging me over\nhey hero for like a number of times and\nI just took a recent family trip to\nThailand and he lives in Thailand and we\nyou know caught up and I met his partner\nand we had like a great time things like\nthat it's really good for socializing\nand yeah it puts you in contact with\nguys so you're not likely to just run\ninto your local town but\num\nin Napa of all places which is not a\nvery big city\num and that always sort of jazzes me and\nsurprises me it's still kind of a new\nexperience do you still do your\num retreats in Thailand I think you were\noffering that at least a few years ago\nmaybe before the pandemic oh great it\nwas really great but yeah so yeah I was\nout there kind of scoping out a little\nbit for new um locations to to do so I\nthink post-pandemic people were a little\nbit more skittish about traveling to\ndeveloping countries and across the\nglobe I think what's probably more\nlikely if we do those is I might\nactually fly to Europe or North America\nand we might do them there\num but I don't really think of Thailand\nas developing personally I I've been\nit's it's so safe they have all the\namenities of civilization it's a\nwonderful place to visit\nyeah I saw some [ __ ] like you know what\nI mean like\nlike I would speak to the people who\nlive there and they tell you stories\nabout like like some of the crime and\nsome of the corruption and and things\nlike that it's no slide on the the\npeople the people are lovely and things\nlike that but\nyou know I\nI I don't I don't know what the\nappropriate label is I'm and I certainly\ndon't want to be accused of being down\non Thailand I've visited three times I\n[ __ ] love that country but um it\ncertainly does feel different to here in\nAustralia oh sure yeah I just meant I\nguess I never felt unsafe there like I\nhave potentially in other places that\nI've traveled how far off road did you\ngo\num not far I went to Bangkok Chiang Mai\nand Phuket\nokay yeah no I mean and the people in\nrural Thailand can be lovely but look\nthere's a lot of money to be made in the\nin the tourism as well and where there's\nmoney that it attracts you know some\nnegative stuff\num but you don't need to talk about this\nI'm sure people aren't interested so\nlet's wrap it up and tell the folks\nwhere they can find you if they want to\nknow more about what you're doing go on\nto YouTube Type in uh Alexander Grace\nthat's my regular thing from that in the\ndescription box of any of my videos\nyou'll find links to my patreon so\nthat's for more exclusive content so a\nlittle bit more in depth uh if you want\nmy personal advice you'll find hey hero\nthat's where people can write to me and\nI write back to them and um\nyeah I I don't have any spots available\nin my men's groups at the moment but\nthat's\nat some point there might be more\nopportunity to actually interact with me\nevery week but not yet okay right on\nwell thank you so much for talking with\nme Alexander it was great to have you on\nand um\nthank you so much for spending time with\nme no worries thanks thanks so much for\neveryone thanks for watching all the way\nto the end bye-bye"
