    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is scicax\nBetter Living Through psychology the\ntopic of today's short talk is why men\nare afraid to approach women\nso there are a couple of obvious answers\nto this question that don't really need\nthe psych hacks treatment but are\nimportant to note so let's just go ahead\nand get them out of the way at the\noutset men are afraid to approach women\nbecause they are afraid of rejection not\nonly because rejection by definition is\nfrustrating and generally perceived to\nbe painful but because rejection in this\ndomain carries a special threat namely\nthat they will be perceived as creepy\nthis is especially true in the shadow of\nthe metoo movement men are afraid that\nnot only will they be rejected but they\nwill be shamed or canceled as a\nconsequence of expressing sexual\ninterest this is the world we live in\ntoday\nbut let's dive a little deeper into this\nissue because it's not immediately\nobvious why sexual rejection would be so\nmuch more intensely painful for men than\nother forms of rejection though it is\npatently obvious that it is experienced\nas such by the vast majority of men and\nwe can consider that the pain of sexual\nrejection Cuts deeper because from an\nevolutionary perspective the survival of\nthe individual is of lower priority than\nthe perpetuation of its genetics\nthat through the lens of evolutionary\ntheory an organism that lives a long and\nhealthy life but fails to reproduce\nviable Offspring has failed as an\nindividual because its genetic lineage\nhas gone extinct just as certainly as if\nhe had never lived long enough to reach\nsexual maturity on the other hand the\nindividual that leaves behind an\nabundance of Offspring ideally with\ndifferent mothers as the genetic\ndiversity will increase the likelihood\nthat at least some of his children will\nsurvive to sexual maturity is an\nevolutionary success\nin a very literal way sex\nis life\nand sexual opportunity is both a\ndeterminant and a signal of individual\nsuccess\non the other hand while lack of sex is\nnot literally death it is symbolically\nsomething much more pernicious namely\nExtinction\nthis means that on a very deep level\nrejection from a woman not only\nsignifies that the man in question does\nnot deserve to reproduce but that by\nExtinction he does not really deserve to\nexist\nas his continued genetic existence\ndepends on his ability to successfully\nreproduce\nin this context it's important to keep\nin mind that biologists do not declare a\nspecies extinct when all of the\nindividuals of that species are actually\ndead but when opportunities for\nreproduction become non-existent\nthe inability to reproduce is extinction\nand the threat of Extinction colors\nevery female rejection and this is a\nuniquely male threat as there are few\nwomen who could not get sex if they\nwanted it\nit's this asymmetrical privilege coupled\nwith a failure in perspective taking\nthat contributes to women's lack of\nunderstanding and frustration regarding\nthe importance of sex for men\nhowever it doesn't end here\nnot only does female rejection carry the\nthreat of Extinction\nbut it carries the threat of Perdition\nas modern man uses woman as The Crucible\nfor his self-worth\nlet's look into this further the idea of\nutilizing a proxy to publicly reveal\nprivate Merit is very old and through\nmost of human history men used contests\nof arms to do this\nwhether in actual combat or in\nritualized simulations of combat the\nidea was that the Victor was not just\nthe strongest not just the most capable\nbut the most deserving\nin short the Victorious combatant\nespecially given the chaos and\nvicissitudes of war was the one that God\nFavored\nthis meant that entering into combat was\nin a symbolic sense putting oneself in\nGod's scales to determine whether one\nhad the right stuff\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the super\nthanks button the three little dots in\nthe lower right hand corner and tip me\nin proportion to the value that you\nbelieve you've derived from this episode\nbecause it's donations like that that\nmake all this happen thank you for your\nsupport\nnow we don't really have that trial by\ncombat culture anymore however the\ndesire to test one's quality remains and\nwhat has replaced Warfare in similar\npastimes as The Crucible of self-worth\nfor modern man who is man indoctrinated\nwith the ideology of romantic love\nis woman\nfor many men even if they would not\nconsciously formulate the idea as such\nwoman has replaced God as the Arbiter of\ntheir worth\nthis means when a man approaches a woman\nhe is functionally allowing her to\nevaluate his Merit by using the\nencounter as a crucible for his\nself-worth\ncan I buy you a drink sometime becomes\nboth from an evolutionary and a\nspiritual perspective do you think I\ndeserve to exist\nnow from a rational perspective this\nmakes no sense whatsoever and some men\nare going to vigorously deny this\ninterpretation however it does have the\nbenefit of explaining an anxiety that\ncan't really be accounted for by other\nconscious explanations\nand women certainly do their part to\nplay into this projection\ndid you know that the word glamor which\nis a distinctly feminine concept comes\nfrom an old Scottish word meaning\nspellcraft\nfemale glamor in the sense of their\nmakeup and their fashion and their\nbehaviors is a spell designed to bewitch\nthe perception of men into believing\nthey are more than they are\nand the more they tap into feminine\nspiritual archetypes the more they are\nsuccessful in this endeavor\nso women whether they are conscious of\nit or not kind of conspire with this\nunconscious belief in men because of\ncourse if they for went all of their\nprops men's desire for them would\nsignificantly diminish\nagain men rationally understand that a\nwoman cannot possibly be the Arbiter of\nhis self-worth especially a woman they\nhave just met and has next to no\ninformation on which to base such a\njudgment even if she wanted to do so but\nthis fear is not a rational thing which\nis why it can't really be dissipated by\nrational arguments\nso\nhow do you overcome approach anxiety\nwell like any other anxiety it can\nreally only be overcome through exposure\nand repetition\nthat is you get over the anxiety of\napproaching women by\napproaching women and the idea is to\napproach enough women that the\nnon-terrible experiences collectively\nconstitute an emotionally disconfirming\nexperience of the feared outcome\nso that you can reasonably expect all\nthings being equal that you will have a\nnon-terrible experience approaching\nwomen moving forward\nand the best way to do this I found is\nto kind of make a game out of it\nthink of approaching women like playing\ntennis\nwhen you play tennis you don't have to\nplay both sides of the net\nyou don't have to visualize how the\nwhole volley is gonna go and you don't\nhave to try to win every point with an\nace\nall you really have to do is put the\nball into play and respond\nand as a man it's your job to serve\nit's your job to put the ball into play\nbut once you do it's her job to hit the\nball back to you\nnow if a woman likes what she sees and\nhears she's going to help you\nshe will hit the ball back to you nice\nand easy right where you're standing\nbecause she's interested in playing\nshe's going to make it easy to hit the\nball back to her\non the other hand if she doesn't like\nwhat she sees or hears or if she just\nisn't in the mood to play\nshe's gonna hit that ball right out of\nbounds this will look like short or one\nword answers uh delivered in a cool tone\nwithout making eye contact\ngentlemen trust me I've approached over\na thousand women\nthis is as bad as it gets\nand if she doesn't want to play you just\ntake your ball and find someone else to\nserve it up to\non the other hand a woman who wants to\nplay will make good eye contact her tone\nwill be warm and she'll use a lot of\nwords to give you something to work with\nmake sense\nall you have to do is serve the bowl the\nrest is kind of up to her and here's the\ncrazy thing it doesn't really matter\nwhat you say\nbecause what you say is really just the\npretext to engage in a little verbal\nback and forth so you don't need to be\nfunny\nyou don't need to be clever you don't\nneed to be Charming at least not in the\nopener\nall you really need to do is\nput the ball into play\nthis will serve as a litmus test for\nwhether she wants to play with you\nafter which point your natural\nconversational reflexes will begin to\ntake over\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel\nyou may also
