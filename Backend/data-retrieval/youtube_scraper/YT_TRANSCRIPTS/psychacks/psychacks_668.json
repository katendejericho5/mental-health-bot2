    "transcript": "a woman who is very very attracted to\nyou will make it cheap and easy to\naccess her time and will clear the way\nto access the sexual opportunity the\nflip side of this is that the men who\npay the most are the ones that women are\ninterested in the least let me say that\nagain The Men Who pay the most are the\nones that women are interested in the\nleast and to the extent that men want to\nbe with women who want to be with them\nthis means that the higher the price the\nlower the rational basis for paying it\nthis is because the more you pay the\nless you get what you want and though\nthis is sad it kind of makes sense if a\nwoman isn't authentically interested in\na man if she's not very attracted to him\nthen she will need to be compensated in\nother ways in order to stick around"
