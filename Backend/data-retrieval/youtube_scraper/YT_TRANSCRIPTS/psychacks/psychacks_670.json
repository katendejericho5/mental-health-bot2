    "video_title": "Seeking SEX in relationships is EXPENSIVE",
    "transcript": "in general when it comes to women the\nmore transactional the relationship the\nless you actually pay this is because\nlike if we're talking about literal\nprostitution men in these situations\nonly pay with money on the other hand if\nyou're dating for a committed\nrelationship you're generally paying\nwith time with attention with\nexclusivity with compromise and with\nmoney and there is never any guarantee\nof sex so while you technically might be\nspending less money on a date than you\nwould on a prostitute the value of all\nthe other things you could be\nsurrendering for seeking sex in a\nrelationship is likely collectively\ngreater than the difference in the\nfinancial transactions the upshot is if\nyou're a man you will have to pay to\naccess the opportunity for sex one way\nor another and that's just the way it is\nthere is a silver lining here which is\nthat the price of that access is\ninversely proportional to the particular\nwoman's interest and attraction"
