    "transcript": "want to talk about we want to be sure we\nget to this because\nI'm one of the biggest James Bond fans\non planet I get a sense that you're up\nthere too so I'm really excited to be\ntalking to you about the series so um\nI I probably got into Bond when I was a\nteenager and I just became obsessed with\nhim and I've probably seen all the pre\n-craig movies at least\n20 or 30 times so it's like a pretty oh\nthat's a serious Bond serious yeah\num so I want to there's a number of\nthings we can discuss first I just got\nto get off my chest because I think that\nyou've made your uh public let's say\ndisdain is that too strong of a word for\nthe for the Craig movies\nso what's up why do you why do you hate\nthe Daniel Craig Bond movies so much\num\nI don't know about hate I just find them\nboring incredibly boring\num you were talking about uh people\nacting up on masculinity\num and instead of actually being\nmasculine and I see that with the Craig\nBond movies and there's too much of an\neffort to try and make him look\nreally tough and hard and you know it's\nlike I prefer the old bonds where bonds\nwas having a laugh and\num I I love the uh the Sean Connery\nRoger Moore Timothy Dalton era\num\nyeah there's so much to go into about\nthat yeah but it's I found the new ones\nare too fake uh ironically they try to\nbe more realistic but they're not more\nrealistic they're just as stupid as the\nold ones\num but they try to put this uh veneer of\nrealism on it\num that isn't there the plots are just\nas stupid the the characters are just as\nstupid the fights are just as\nunrealistic but in the old movies they\nembraced it and they they didn't lie\nabout it and they they acknowledged to\nthe audience and said look you know we\nknow this is absolute garbage we know\nthis is juvenile teenage\num masculine sexual fantasy and it's it\ncould never happen in the real world but\nwe are going to fulfill those deep\nfantasies that you've got on the most\nbrilliant level\num you know you know we're going to take\nthe fantasy beyond what even you would\nwould do with it you know\num and I love how they did that because\nfor me that felt very honest they made\nthem movies unrealistic\nbut I think that was honest because the\nfantasies that we men have\nthat were being fulfilled by other\nmovies those fantasies are unrealistic\nto begin with so I think the more mature\napproach is to present it\nunrealistically on the screen and the\nnew movies try to\npretend that it's not pretend\nyeah they do have this like grittiness\nand this realism we don't have exploding\npens and uh you know helicopters in\nsuitcases and women with ridiculous\nnames and and things like that but\num I don't think they are more realistic\nby the way I don't I think they're just\nas stupid yeah I think you can\ndefinitely make that case that they're\nnot more realistic I I do think that for\nmost of the series they are catering to\nthe male fantasy it's like who would\nwant to be this dashing secret agent who\nlives a Life Adventure embeds all these\nbeautiful women and saves the world I\nmean it's like sign me up for that that\nsounds fantastic\nand there seemed to be some sort of like\ncrisis of conscience about this that\nhappened in my I think the first signs\nwe see it in our GoldenEye which I we\nwatched a couple of years ago a lot of\npeople that are my age have this\nromanticized view of GoldenEye I think\nbecause of the video game that came up\nuh at that time around the time when we\nwere classic game and so we love golden\neye but when you go back and watch it\nit's actually kind of depressing and a\nlot of that movie they spend just like\nflagellating bond for his misogynism for\nhis you know being out of dates you know\nthe money Penny the new Young Money\nPenny isn't going to flirt with them so\nshe's she's too good for his advances\nand it's like we can't have fun anymore\nin in Goldeneye and it was like we have\nto stop uh we have to stop the The\nSuperficial male fantasy that we've been\nindulging in for too long and not only\nthat we have to enact some sort of\npenance on men and I actually think\nthat's where we're getting with in the\nCraigs because I do I do think that um\nyou know ever every actor who played\nBond certainly brought something unique\nto the role and I think that's also not\njust\na representation of who he was as a\nperson or an actor but also of the times\nand\num I think what Craig brought to bond\nwas that we hadn't really seen in bond\nbefore is that I can take it I can take\nwhatever you throw at me and still stand\nup like I'm tougher than anything else\nit's like you couldn't think Roger Moore\nI don't think could really get the crap\nbeaten out of them maybe you know he\nhe'd probably keep a stiff British upper\nlip but like Craig is just\nno matter what you throw at me no matter\nif you it's the same with Connery by the\nway I mean a lot of people think if\nConnery as being a tough Bond but\nactually when you see him with a share\ntop in the movies he was just as skinny\nas Roger Moore he just had a hairy chest\nher hairy chest doesn't stop but lots of\npunches does it you know so yeah I mean\nwe had Bond like running through\ndrywalls in Casino Royale and just like\nbeing this this\nalmost this unhinged weapon of like pure\nID and destruction that needs to kind of\nbe reigned in in Casino Royale to become\na more targeted effective assassin\nbasically\num but I do think that the the Craigs\nare kind of a\num I mean we're talking about how to be\na man in a modern society that kind of\ndoesn't believe in men that thinks that\nmen have done all kinds of bad things in\nthe past and not only maybe shouldn't be\nin power anymore but maybe need to be\nbrought to bear for those transgressions\nthose historical Transmissions\nand um that Bond as the man who's like\nwho gets things done and it's tough is\nbecoming increasingly irrelevant like\nyou see that in the exchange with q in\nCasino Royale and they made Q into this\num this young nerdy character we also\nfind out in no time to die that he's gay\nand he basically says that you know\nyou're I can do more damage\non my laptop than you could in your\nentire life you're you're just someone\nneeds to pull the trigger every once in\na while so we're using you you're just\nlike this brute animal you don't really\nhave a place and you also see that in\nthe storyline in like um uh what is it\nSpecter where uh who is it C is trying\nto take over MI6 it's like the the whole\nMI6 Empire is we don't need this anymore\nwe're globalists uh we need to move\nBeyond this parochial view of\nnationality it's just like the whole\nthing about that bond is coming up\nagainst in the Craig films is you are\nirrelevant like that just gets told to\nhim over and over and over again and\nover and over and over again he shows\nthat he's not\nlike I think that's the the male fantasy\ntoday which is men live in the society\nwhere they're kind of being told in so\nmany ways that they are increasingly\nirrelevant yeah you know we're not\nthat's a good take on it I like that\nyeah and and Craig's and he kind of\ntakes it on the chin every time it's\nlike the exchange with Vesper on the\ntrain when he just like Smiles as she\nskewers him and no one really\nbelieves in him but he is he gets the\njob done and almost everybody comes\naround and respects him in the end and I\nthink that's the new male fantasy not\nthat I'm gonna go in bed you know 30\ndifferent women and have a bunch of cool\ncars it's that like I can still be a man\nand be respected and celebrated for\ndoing so yeah what do you think\nuh I can I can see that reading of it\num I don't\nfor me it doesn't make the movies work\nfor me\num because\nright in order to be respected as a man\nyou have to save the world and\ngo through all kinds of pain and beat\npeople up and fighting and stuff but\nthat's the male fantasy version does\nthat mean a woman doesn't have to go\nthrough that does that mean some other\nperson from some other group doesn't\nhave to do that why is it only a a male\nhas to do that you know it's a good\npoint\num so yeah it's not a message that I\nagree with\num but I also never got the the feeling\nand I didn't cease back to but I saw the\nother ones I never got the feeling in\nany of those movies that he ended up\nrespected at the end at all for me the\nendings were always just flat and dull\num well he died in the last one didn't\nhe well he does and then they toast him\nand you know everybody's very sad uh\nVesper comes around after he surely acts\nvery sad uh maybe you're right it's the\ndifference isn't it I saw some\ninteresting takes one thing that I do\nthink was great about the Craig series\nis that really for the first time you\nsee continuity between the films which I\nthink was some something that the series\nas a whole really\nmissed out on like I think you see\nSylvia trench for two seconds in From\nRussia with Love and she's thinking that\nyou meet at the baccarat table in Dr No\nbut other than that other than like q\nand Moneypenny and there's like no every\nevery movie is it takes place in like\nthis almost\nin its own time capture a lot of\nmedically sealed universe exactly and I\nthink that I do kind of like that though\nbecause I love the fact that with all\nthe old movies you can just say which\nBond movie do I feel like watching today\nand you can dive into any one of them\nand it's a complete whole experience on\nits own\num\nwhere's the new ones yeah it's more like\na series I I prefer the old style but I\ncan understand that there there are\nappeals to having a continuous story\nbetween them all but there's some\ninteresting things that come out of the\nuh the disconnected nature between the\nold\num Bond films it's almost like they're\nall remakes of the same story you know\nand the formula for sure yeah definitely\nthe same formula they're all remade lots\nand lots of different ways\num and you kind of always knew what the\noutcome was was going to be but there's\nthings about that that I found really\nfascinating and one of them is uh if you\nlooked at them as being continuous a\ncontinuous Bond story\nwhat happens to each\num woman he gets with at the end of each\nmovie before the next movie is the I was\nactually thinking I might do a video on\nthis at some point I think you talked\nabout this in one of your episodes you\nhave a little pep probably dead yeah I\nmean does he does he does he kill them\noff does he uh you know is he serial\nkiller uh does he just go and sneakily\ndump them is this some woman\nbroken-hearted crying her eyes out\nsomewhere well he's off adventures in\nthe world meeting the next girl\nyou don't often see that you see that I\nthink in uh Tomorrow Never Dies where he\ngoes up to uh Terry Hatcher's character\nand she just slaps him and I think this\nis the first time in a film where bond\ngets reintroduced\nto a woman that he has seduced in the\npast you don't you see that yeah yeah\nand then he succeeds in seducing her\nagain so I guess yeah yeah of course he\ndoes yeah yeah there's always an excuse\nto let Bond off with them with being a\nnaughty boy isn't it you know so it was\nusually like he sleeps with one girl or\ntwo girls alien the movie and they get\nkilled by the bad guys sometimes Bond\neven slip slips up and accidentally puts\nthem in danger and they get killed\nanyway but then he gets to be with the\nwoman he really wants in the movie at\nthe end and he doesn't have to have the\nguilt of dumping the other ones because\nthey got killed"
