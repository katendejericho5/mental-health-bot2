    "transcript": "this is true of anyone men and women to\ndo your job really well you have to\nallow yourself to be used there is no\nway around it if you don't allow your\nemployer or your customers to use you to\nuse your time or your service or your\nexpertise then you cannot expect to get\nwhat you want from them a highly skilled\nworker who does not allow herself to be\nused is useless and useless things\ntypically aren't very valuable the\npotential doesn't count for anything the\nfact that you could if you wanted to is\nmeaningless if you don't and it's\nusually the case that you have to allow\nyourself to be used in advance of\ngetting what you want kind of like how\nyou have to work two weeks before you\nreceive a paycheck and this means that\nthere's always a chance that you'll put\nin the effort and not get what you want\nafter all no one really likes this like\neverybody men and women would just\nprefer to be given what they wanted and\neverybody men and women are acutely\naware of the possibility that they won't\nget what they hope to receive"
