    "transcript": "and I would highly highly encourage men\nto disappoint their women sooner as\nopposed to later in a normal healthy\nrelationship saying no to a request or\nnot being available or not being\ninterested does not lead to the end of\nthe relationship think about it if your\nbuddy turns down your invitation to go\nto the baseball game with you what's\nyour response hey no problem maybe next\ntime and then you move on with your life\nthat is an appropriate response to\ndisappointment however it is\nunfortunately the case that some women\nespecially more immature women can do a\nlot of inappropriate things when\ndisappointed things like throw a temper\ntantrum or sulk in despondency or keep\nscore in bitterness or withdraw\naffection\nEtc and don't you think it would be\nimportant to figure out if you're\ndealing with this type of woman early on\nin the relationship it's better to learn\nthis in the first five weeks than in the\nfirst five months or God help you in the\nfirst five years"
