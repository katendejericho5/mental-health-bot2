    "transcript": "hi everyone I'm Dr Orion taraban and\nthis is cycax Better Living Through\npsychology and today I am very excited\nto be able to sit down and talk with Dr\nChris Harrison\nuh full disclosure Chris and I are\nactually long-standing friends he was\none of my clinical supervisors at my\npost-doctoral internship back in the day\nand we've kept in touch since then he's\na really interesting guy\num and I'm very happy to have you on the\npodcast today Chris thanks for joining\nme thanks Iran yeah it's really a thrill\nto be here I'm so happy to agree with\nyou so after you left the um the the\nclinic that we were working at you went\nto Facebook would you mind telling us a\nlittle bit about what you did there\nyeah for sure so at Facebook I was I was\nrecruited in by a friend from graduate\nschool and I wasn't exactly sure what I\nwas getting myself into but what I what\nI did know is I was going in uh into the\nrole was that there were individuals at\nthe company and outside the company that\nwere contracted through various parties\nthat were reviewing content so content\nmany of your viewers may know the term\ncontent moderators so the people who are\nresponsible for reviewing content that's\nflagged either by human beings or by\nartificial intelligence machine learning\nclassifiers that is content that the\ncompany doesn't want on their platform\nfor a variety of reasons according to\ntheir uh their governance uh their\npolicies on on content so a lot of the\nmaterial that gets flagged is really\negregious material think about the the\nworst of the worst actors on the planet\nfrom child exploitation to terrorists to\ndrug cartels they leverage these\nplatforms for their own nefarious means\nand then there are human beings on the\nother side who have to review that\ncontent and make decisions does it stay\nor does it go\nso that work was having a pretty\ndramatic psychological impact on at\nleast some of the people who were\nengaged in the work and and the company\nnow meta then Facebook was aware of that\nso brought in a team of psychologists to\ndevelop what we weren't calling this at\nthe time but what evolved into\npsychological health and safety\nprogramming for Content reviewers or\ncontent moderators so that was the work\nit was figuring out what can we do to\nprotect\nuh protect harm from happening so there\nwere some digital solutions that that I\nworked on while I was there and then\nreactive support when people are exposed\nto things how can we provide a level of\npsychological support to mitigate the\nharm that's unavoidable so that was the\nwork and I we started with full-time\nemployees and then I wound up moving\ninto an area that I was very happy to\nmove into which was supporting the\noutsourced content moderators that\nworked for big companies like some big\nbig companies in the world uh who who\nserve this function of outsourced\ncustomer support or customer service for\nthe world's big Brands so I want and\nthere they tend to be low-wage workers\nall over the world because language\nspecialization language competency is\nvery important so I wound up doing work\nwith all these companies around the\nworld and figuring out what does\npsychological safety look like for you\nin your region with the different kinds\nof content that you tend to see in your\nin your are part of the world so it was\nabsolutely fascinating work did that for\nabout four and a half years before I\ndecided to move on yeah I bet I remember\nwhen you told me about this job it made\ntotal sense to me and\nthat there's going to be a lot of uh\nreally nasty stuff on the dark web and I\nthink in the beginning I before you told\nme what you did I couldn't understand\nthe necessity for it because so much of\nit gets filtered away so I don't ever\nreally get the exposed to the worst of\nthe worst I'm sure that there's a lot of\ndebates around the boundaries of where\nyou should draw the line for what is\nflagable material but I think we can all\nargue that there are certainly some\nreally flagrant extreme uh examples that\nreally don't have any place in a civil\npublic discourse absolutely and so uh\nwhat did you learn like what did you\nlearn in developing these protocols for\nwhat you call psychological safety\nspecifically around online material that\nmight actually also be appropriate for\njust the normal end user of these\nproducts yeah it's a great it's a great\nquestion and and really interesting I'm\nstill involved in the space uh\ntangentially and I can describe some of\nwhat I'm doing there now\nto go back a stab whenever I would\ndescribe this role to people in my life\nfriends or while networking\nprofessionally that was often the\nresponse and there's the the whole idea\nof this is that it's it's hidden this is\nan invisible job in in industry and an\ninvisible job to the tune up hundreds of\nthousands of people doing it every year\nacross all the different platforms you\nthink about the big Tech firms all of\nthe every big Tech firm every social\nmedia platform has this Army of content\nreviewers and content moderators most of\nus not involved in this space profession\nwe would never think of it you pick up\nyour fee you Facebook feed or whatever\nand you just go through Instagram's feed\nand everything's nice and that's lovely\nthat is so curated it's nice because of\nthis Army of individuals that are taking\ndown the stuff that none of us would\never want to see it's a whole thing\ncommercial content moderation is what\nit's called it's differentiated from\nlike Reddit which is more of a community\nor Wikipedia which are Community\nmoderated platform terms so this is\ncommercial content moderation because\nthese companies are as we know many of\nthem their revenue comes through\nadvertising so they don't want if if\nthey became cesspools of this awful\nmaterial their ad Revenue would likely\ndry up so there are applications I think\nfrom what was learned in working with\nthe content moderators for end users\nsome of the some of the work that we\nwere involved in I think and I've been\naway from it now for a couple of years\nis making its way or has made its way\ninto end user experiences some of the\nwork that we did in the technological\nfront was rendering images in black and\nwhite because color saturation can evoke\na stronger emotional response in the\nlimbic system just like the Rorschach\nyeah yeah yeah exactly exactly precisely\nlike that and it's sequenced right from\nblack and white and then you put in some\ncolor\nso there's and there's some interesting\nresearch on that so things like muting\naudio so if it's a video of say a bloody\nvideo of someone screaming render the\nimage in the video in black and white\nhave the audio muted by default and\nyou'd have to unmute to hear it those\nare a couple of the digital kind of\nTechnical Solutions some of those are\npresents I think in end user experiences\nnow as well\nthere are other groups that work on\ncommunity engagement I mean endless\ngroups that work on community engagement\nand user experience\num where they go out and interview\npeople who are using the platforms and\nfigure out what harms are are being done\nand how do we mitigate against those\nharms I think that results in things and\nI was involved in a little bit of this\nwork like having in in a reporting flow\nsay some kind of child exploitation or\nor something comes through your feed or\nsomeone's feed and you report that\nthey'll be hotlines that are attached to\nthat reporting flow for like missing and\nexploiting children's uh Resource\nCenters or something in the country so\nthere's ways in which I think there's a\nrecognition of the potential harms that\ncan happen around certain content types\nand then supports are built into a into\nthese reporting flows when they're\nactioned through the platforms so some\nof that some of those things we learned\nand and I think the company was doing\nanyway and we're applying to end user\nsafety which is just a different\ncategory from what I was working on sure\nit's definitely different because if\nit's your job you can't\nchoose to even avoid certain content\nwhat about like digital diet a lot of my\nclients these days talk about Doom\nscrolling and it becomes sort of\naddictive it's very hard to unsee\nsomething once you've seen it to unthink\nsomething once you allow it access into\nyour mind is is there a place for just\nyou know nipping this in the bud and can\nand having more discernment over what\nyou choose to consume digitally\nyeah I think so I'm trying to think of\nwhat was the film that was made\nabout this that I'm trying to think of\nthe organization and it's all\nuh not coming up in my mind right now\nmaybe it'll come up in a second but yeah\nI think a lot of the firms have looked\nat this like apple with with their\nscreen time app have given given end\nusers the ability to see and I get\nnotifications on my phone like your\nscreen time is up X percentage or X many\nnumber of minutes or hours from last\nweek so I think there's there's loads of\nthings that the tech companies are doing\nbecause of pressure to be clear because\nof advocacy and pressure that I think\nalert us as users to the amount of time\nthat we might be spending on a\nparticular platform I think there's a\nhell of a lot more work that can be done\nthere oh sure that kind of feels like\nwhen they put the health warning\nstickers on the pack of cigarettes it's\na bandage Solution on a product that is\npotentially designed to be addictive\nYeah by definition\nand I think that there is a lot that\nsocial media companies are doing to make\ntheir products as you know you know to\nkeep users on them as long as possible\nyeah so there's it's an interesting\ndialectic isn't it it's like the time on\nplatform of course is what is what's\nmonetized and then there's the the other\nside that's saying and too much of that\nis leading to some of the societal ills\nthat we're seeing particularly I always\nthink about the the most vulnerable\nthrough through some of the research\nlike adolescent girls and the level of\nuniversal that's happening what you're\ndescribing once you see something you\ncan't see it here's something you can't\nunhear it so the more someone is is on\nthese platforms obviously the more\nexposure they have and the more risk\nthat there is so there's this\ninteresting tension I think that all the\nfirms are in the midst of working\nthrough so yeah that's interesting\nbecause the the research that I've seen\nmost on social media usage in its\ndeleterious effects is what you allude\nto\num that especially adolescent girls have\nreally poor\num like emotional and self-esteem\noutcomes when engaging I think on\nInstagram in particular yeah the idea\nhere is it's um the unfavorable\ncomparisons to like ideal body types in\nparticular is creating somatic issues\nand\num eating yeah and a lot of female\naggression is also relational and so\nthat can also be\ntranscribed onto social media very\neasily\nfor instance but there hasn't to my\nknowledge been a lot of research into\nhow social media might be affecting\nyoung young men adolescent boys and\nyoung men do you have any thoughts on\nthat and I'm not aware of any research\nin that space either so I mean I have\nthoughts on it but they wouldn't be\nthoughts based in in research at all\nyeah do you mind sharing your thoughts\nyou don't have to necessarily provide a\ncitation yeah I mean I just wonder about\nthe ways in which men are and adolescent\nboys are being portrayed I think there\nhas been an uptick in body image issues\nfor adolescent boys again I can't\nreference research on that but I think\nthe ways in which behavior and even and\nand bodies are being displayed through\nthese platforms can cause similar issues\nfor men I wonder about uh you know the\nwhole topic of toxic masculinity I think\nhas been in the Zeitgeist now for some\ntime and I wonder some times about how\nmen interacting with other men or\nresponding to different challenges or\ndifficulties in their lives with levels\nof aggression or or anger impact impact\nusers I wonder about like I think about\nmy own son who's eight years old he's\nnot on any of these platforms he's\nhardly on a digital screen at all we my\nwife and I manage that really carefully\num but but like the YouTube effect is\nalways present for him or already\npresent for him the idea of becoming\nlike YouTube famous or an influence an\ninfluencer yeah I think that's the\nprofession that most children these days\nare aspiring yeah he's not he's not even\nbeen on like he hasn't even been on\nYouTube before or Instagram before but\nthis idea in the culture oh he still has\nthat he still has this idea of being an\ninfluencer even though he's never been\non the platform wow yeah\nquite an idea that it has that much\npower so I don't know if that's specific\nto boys or or adolescent men\num you know an area that\nthat's not social media but I can\nspeak to just from my own experience in\nmy family I'm from a large family lots\nof nieces and nephews and there are\nindividuals in my family who are raised\non not raised on screens but had a lot\nof exposure to screens and social\nconnection through video games and I\nwitnessed a couple members of my\nextended family who have are now young\nadults uh yeah young adults oh I won't\nreveal their ages but they've had some\nstruggles with mental health some\nstruggles with addiction and I have no\nidea I I don't want to over prescribe\nkind of cause and effect there but\nwatching the amount of time they spent\non screens gaming and I think that's\nparticularly uh\npresent for boys like more more\nprevalent for boys for girls again we\ncould look up numbers on that determine\nif that's actually true but I think\nthat's a one of the ways in which I\nthink perhaps more harmful effects are\ncoming through screen time for boys and\nAdolescent and Adolescence is is through\ngaming I do worry about that yeah boys\ngenerally gain more than girls but I\nhave read kind of mixed results about\nthat that on some level the virtual\ncommunity that comes with gaming with\nother guys has been shown in some cases\nto have a positive effect but it could\nvery well impact their ability to make\nthose connections in the real world\npotentially where they might be even\nmore valuable one of the ways that I\nthink\num\nuh that social media might be impacting\nBoys in particular though this is not\nunique to them is uh there's a there's\nan absence now of like a small pool like\nI think before social media you could\nyou could kind of start out by being a\nbig fish in a small pond you know you\ncould be um the best soccer player in\nyour in your seventh grade class and\nthat kind of meant something yeah\nbecause you're comparing yourself to\nlike the the 10 or you know 100 people\nthat are immediately around you and so\nyou you kind of get a chance to have\nscaffolded self-esteem be built yeah um\nand I think that the small pools are\nkind of drying up because of social\nmedia it's like no matter what you do\nyou just turn on YouTube or Instagram\nand there's like amazing people doing\nall kinds of things around the world and\nespecially if you're starting off and\nyou're young and you don't have a lot of\nskills you don't have a lot of\nexperience you just you probably just\nare more sharply aware of the gap\nbetween you and like what counts as\nimpressive on the world's stage and you\nmight despair of ever getting there and\nmaybe that prevents you from trying and\nI'm thinking this is particularly\nimpacting boys because as you may be\naware there's uh there's a crisis in\nyoung men these days they're they're not\nreally graduating high schools colleges\ngrad schools they're underperforming in\nthe marketplace a lot of them are\nfailing to launch we don't really do\nthat as much with with young women that\nthey're still staying at their parents\nhouse in their mid-20s are you familiar\nwhat are you familiar with the what are\nbeing seen as the primary contributing\nfactors to that with boys in addition to\nwhat you've just said with social media\nand perhaps this exposure to the world's\nbest and then that downward that\ndownward comparison to self like I can\nnever achieve that do you know what what\nkind of\nuh impact that's having from like a\npercentile basis like that plus what\nelse is contributing to Failure to\nLaunch it's a complicated issue um I\ndon't think anybody has the full picture\nbut there's a few things that that we\ncan talk about with respect to that that\nI've heard\num one is just a a limited access to\npositive male role models in the lives\nof boys like 98 of kindergarten teachers\nare women and the vast majority of\nelementary school teachers are women\nmore boys are growing up in single\nparent households and most of those are\nsingle mothers so there's an absence of\nstrong masculine presence in the lives\nof a lot of boys these days\num there's also a lot of changes in\nculture and education where they hear\nterms like toxic masculinity and\nsometimes boys grow up feeling\num ashamed of who they are just as a\nbasis of their biological sex I've\nworked with young men in uh College who\nhave dropped out\nbecause their experience was if they\ndidn't sufficiently self-flagellate in\ntheir classrooms and apologize for the\ncrime of being a man in their words\num they were they were just sort of\nshamed and silenced so that can that\nculture can obviously be highly variable\nin terms of its uh you know intensity or\naggressiveness\num but and there's also just a um you\ncan see this in in the media and the\nculture is that generally uh there's a\nstrong push for very strong empowered\nfemale characters and there's even been\nlike a a rebranding of old uh you know\nmasculine Heroes and archetypes where\nwe're seeing if we're transforming their\ngender they're now women or they um\nthey're kind of\ncut down a peg by their female\nequivalents\num I don't I don't think any one thing\nis is is making this happen\num but uh I think that there's a there's\na lack of a lot of support for for boys\nand young men and um\nfor example I was I always reached out\nby a um\nby a political advocate in the state of\nWashington\num a few months back I actually got an\nepisode about this on the channel called\ndivide and conquer and for I think the\nsecond month the second year in a row\nthey had put an initiative on the state\nlegislature to found a commission on\nboys and men to kind of examine and\npotentially address issues that seem to\nbe disproportionately affecting boys and\nmen\num there's a number of different\ncommissions there's a commission on\nwomen there's a commission on LGBT\nissues there's a commission on X Y and Z\nand for the second year of the row even\nthough it enjoyed bipartisan support and\nwas nominated by two female Democratic\nRepresentatives it didn't even get to\nthe floor for a vote and uh it's just\nand I think I think the issue here is\nthat often when we talk about supporting\nmen and boys the subtext here is we we\nwe're going to take that time energy and\nresources away from women like it's a\nzero-sum game\nor that there's kind of a social justice\nelement to it well men and boys had\ntheir time and so this is just\num redistributing the balance in like an\napocal historical perspective so I and I\nthink those are um\ndeviations from uh the most just and\nflourishing society that we can\npotentially have yeah it's interesting\nit is super multivariate and the\ncultural influences Beyond media and\nscreens and gaming are pretty profound\njust with as you're describing some of\nthe cultural shifts and Transformations\nthat we're living through yeah\nfascinating topic unto itself yeah it\nwould be\num I'd be tough to be a kid and we'd\nhave to raise kids yeah in today's day\nand age so all the best to you man it's\num it's I think it's a hard job under\nthe best of circumstances it just seems\nfraught with so many challenges that\num no previous generation of parents\nhave ever really been called to confront\nso in Uncharted Territory in a lot of\nthese respects absolutely yeah thank you\nthank you for the well wishes navigate\nthese choppy Waters of Parenthood\num can we talk about your shirt\nwe can talk about my shirt yes what you\ngot there on your shirt man some\nmushrooms uh just some regular mushrooms\nuh yeah I think he has some shiitakes\nthey might be psilocybin mushroom\nmushrooms that contain psilocybin yeah\nwhy might you be wearing a shirt of\nmushrooms that may contain Simon yeah\nI'm really excited profoundly excited\nabout the I think what's generally being\ntermed the Psychedelic Renaissance that\nwe're living through right now there's a\ntremendous amount of energy\nresearch that's happening uh where we've\nentered this this new Arena or this new\nthis new era of psychedelics going\nmainstream mainly for mental health\npurposes and the so the research a lot I\npay most attention to what's coming out\nof the John Hopkins uh Center for\nConsciousness studies and there are\nother you know many major research\nuniversities have Center owners of\nresearch just around psychedelics and\nmainly their impact on Mental Health I'm\ninterested in psychedelics both for\ntheir uh benefits on on mental health\nand addiction and also for you just use\nthe term flourishing for General human\nflourishing\num so yeah I've got I've got a lot of\nexcitement about the the Psychedelic\nworld where it is where it's headed and\nmy wife got me this she knows my\nenthusiasm part of the space there\ndefinitely used to be a a greater\nSynergy between Clinical Psychology and\npsychedelics as you know back in the day\num in fact I think\nthere was a time when one of the\nfounders of AAA Alcoholics Anonymous\nactually considered\nuh this Distributing I think it was LSD\nat um sessions because he had a\npsychedelic experience I think with Tim\nLeary that led to a uh a spiritual\ntransformation that helped him to move\nin the direction of his sobriety yeah it\nused to be much more common and then I\ndon't really understand what happens but\nit it really got shut down hard in the\n70s the 60s\nactually okay\num maybe it was a counter uh cultural\nrevolutionary push and all these\nsubstances became controlled and\nscheduled one\num even though interestingly as you know\nbut for the viewers uh as far as I'm\naware there's never been a psychedelic\ndependence\ndisorder in the DSM like it seems like\nit's very very difficult to become\nphysiologically dependent on\npsychedelics it is and\num it's it's also I think very difficult\nto overdose on psychedelics like you can\nhave\nsome pretty intense psychological\nexperiences but you might you might\nexperience ego death but you might not\nactually physically yeah suffer from the\nexperience is is that fair to say that's\nfair to say and I'm always super careful\non this topic to not represent myself as\nas an expert or one who would Advocate\nthe use of these uh substances or\nmedicines as many call them without\nreally really really structured\nsupervision\num but yeah I was listening to a podcast\nI'd listen to things on this topic all\nthe time and the the host of the of the\nepisode I was listening to said there\nisn't as far as we know any known\ninstances of oding on LSD as an example\nlike we think it's impossible to\noverdose on LSD and psilocybin so yeah I\nmean there's there's safety and\nobviously there's some radical risk with\nwhat you just described the idea of the\nof the quote unquote bad trip is real\nand people have died using these\nsubstances because because they have\nnot been in the proper sentence setting\nso people like thinking I Can Fly And\nI'm going to jump off a building things\nlike that happening so they're\nexceptionally powerful and their effects\ncan be salutatory against our suffering\nor they can really exacerbate suffering\nso set and setting is always the the\nreally important factors to keep in mind\nwho what is your mindset going in what\nis your intention who are you working\nwith what substance is right for you\nthere's a massive amount of\nconsiderations that I encourage people\nto work through prior to experimenting\nat all this isn't about at all about\nrecreational use the use in mental\nhealth settings is I mean as it should\nbe and as the research has been designed\nis is quite controlled and it should be\nso there's other work Roland Griffiths\nwho's one of the most well-known people\nin the space he's the the person who\nfounded the center for Consciousness\nstudies at Johns Hopkins and he's\ninterestingly he started I think he\nstarted his research\num with Silas I think it was psilocybin\nand end-stage cancer patients and he now\nhimself is an end stage cancer patient\nand he's been using uh psilocybin I\nthink on and off throughout his research\ncareer and he's a person who if you hear\nhim speak he got him this relatively\nlate in his research career he never\nexpected to be doing this kind of work\num but he's he's presenting beautiful\nbeautiful accounts of his own experience\nand the work that he's done as he moves\nthrough his dying process he's terminal\num\nwhere was I I forget where I was going\nwith that point originally\num well you were talking about\nyeah in addition to the the clinical\napplication one of the things that\nRoland Griffiths who just established\nthis beautiful\num endowment that will secure a seat\nleading his the department that he'll be\ndeparting when he dies uh focusing on\nwell-being and overall well-being and\nhuman flourishing so that's where most\nof my interest is I have a lot of\ninterest on the clinical side as well I\nwas an addiction specialist when I was\nworking uh clinically day to day and the\noutcomes for alcoholism for all sorts of\ndifferent types of substance use\nproblems are off the charts with\npsychedelics and I think we're just now\nbeginning to understand the the power of\nthis approach to treatment it's illegal\nalmost everywhere so there's a lot to\nhappen MDMA is about to get\num FDA approval for therapeutic use for\nPTSD Maps the which is based in San\nFrancisco is an organization that's long\nbeen an advocacy group they've been\ndoing a lot of tremendous work over the\nyears so there's a lot happening in the\nclinical space most of what's happening\nis in the clinical space I'm very very\ncareful to say I am interested to see\nwhat can we do in the well-being and\nhuman flourishing side of the equation\nas well there hasn't been academic\nresearch on that to date because getting\nfunding for that I think is still\nchallenging but there's I have some some\ninterest in understanding the utility\nfor leadership development as an example\nfor evolving the consciousness of\nleaders to meet the very unique\nchallenges that we're facing in the 21st\ncentury so yeah that's a topic near and\ndear to my heart yeah so let's unpack\nsome of the things that you said so\nafter really shutting down these\nsubstances decades ago they we've seen a\nResurgence of in particular I think\npsilocybin and MDMA in research contexts\num I think California was one of the\nepicenters for a lot of This research\nand it is usually done with cancer\npatients especially in stage cancer\npatients and Trauma survivors and it's\nunder very controlled circumstances it\nmakes sense that that would be the case\nI think because\num if this is going to be if these\nsubstances are going to be like produced\nand sold as uh like prescribed\nmedications well part of the FDA\napproval process is it needs to be shown\nto be effective to treat a specific\ndisorder I mean this is how\nantidepressants and other psychiatric\nmedications get approved it has to be\nbased on\num amelioration of a specific\ndiagnosable issue versus uh you know\nhuman flourishing and well-being this is\none of the long-standing complaints of\npositive psychology as you know which is\nthat traditional political psychology\nmight be too focused on\ndisorders on negative aspects of Human\nExperience where there's actually\num that's just kind of the tip of the\niceberg yes it's important to kind of\nput out the fires first but that's just\nbecause you got\nthose taken care of doesn't necessarily\nmean that you're flourishing it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that you're happy it\ndoesn't necessarily mean you're anywhere\nclose to your Peak functioning and um\nthere's a there's not a lot of focus on\ngetting people beyond that Psychotherapy\nis still generally associated with\nsolving a problem versus moving in the\ndirection of Greater awareness or uh\nhappiness or flourishing however\nwhatever positive metric you want to use\nso\num we have uh that those two substances\nin particular I'm aware of have a great\ndeal of empirical support for those\nissues you talked about addiction I'm\naware that\num Ayahuasca in particular has had a lot\nof success in treating alcoholics in\nBrazil where it has less of a\num a legal constraint than here in the\nUnited States\nthe uses and gabromate I think talks\nabout the use of psychedelics on\naddiction and I think they're\nparticularly interesting because I think\nat the core of most addictions maybe all\naddictions is like an an inner void an\ninner emptiness that is being the user\nis using um the substance to either numb\nor temporarily fill but um as I often\nsay you can't really solve an internal\nproblem with an external solution and\nmaybe one of the re this doesn't sound\nvery scientific at all but one of the\nways in which\npsychedelics work to heal addictions is\nthat they kind of work to fill that void\nwith something sustainable something\nthat's akin to Baby Love\nI don't know if what do you think about\nthat yeah the stanislav graph is a\ntranspersonal psychiatrist so I study\ntranspersonal psychology the The\nGraduate School that I went to at the\ntime was called The Institute of\ntranspersonal psychology it's in Palo\nAlto California it's now called Sophia\nUniversity and transpersonal psychology\nis kind of the interface of I think it\nis the interface of world wisdom\nTraditions many of them quote unquote\nEastern based and and quote unquote\nWestern Clinical Psychology so\nstanislavgarov is the psychology of the\nfuture I think is one of his classic\nbooks that I read as I was thinking\nabout what I wanted to do with my life\nin my early to mid-20s and he speaks\nabout addiction and talks about it as\nthe misguided search for Spirits so\nespecially with alcoholism if we think\nabout the Greek root spiritus and the\nmisguided search for spirit so problem\nexperience I mean whiskeys Bourbons\nthey're Spirits yeah yeah yeah exactly\nso it's kind of a clever clever\nformulation of all of this incidentally\nCarl Young and Bill W the founder of a a\nhad a lot of Correspondence I think all\nin a similar vein of what you were\nspeaking about this this kind of\ninternal emptiness this search for a\nsense of wholeness a sense of ground a\nsense of being worth something being\nworthy of being on this planet we know a\nlot of people who struggle with\naddiction come from if not acute trauma\nbackgrounds develop backgrounds that\nthat included a lot of Developmental\ntrauma so we could talk about think\nabout neglect just being raised in\nchaotic households a lot of people and\nwe have the genetic predisposition is is\npretty powerful we now know as well I\nuse myself as an example I'm in I hold\nthis term loosely but I'm in recovery\nfrom alcoholism so I had I had massive\nissues with with alcohol in my teens\ninto my early 20s on the seventh born of\nseven children all of whom have\nstruggled with addiction from process\naddictions gambling to substance\naddictions all seven three of my\nsiblings sadly have died two of them\nreally directly tied to their addiction\nand I think all three of their deaths\nwere related to addiction so this is a\ntopic very very near and dear to my\nheart we were raised in a household that\nwas that was very it was filled with\nloves filled in many ways with a deep\nspirituality and then at the same time\nthere was there was some neglect if not\nsome abuse and that combination of\ngenetic predisposition and uh\nchallenging developmental environments I\nthink it created an inter for me an\ninternal sense of self of con of\nconfusion some time of emptiness and\njust to the point that we're speaking\nabout I found alcohol when I was 12 and\nI was like oh my God I feel so good like\nthis puts me back together again I\nnoticed that it's a very common\nexperience among the alcoholics that I\nworked at their first experience with\nalcohol was very positive like wow I\nfound it I found the solution to my\nsuffering and then of course the\nsolution becomes the problem and it ways\none could never imagine and and then\nwhat is left really bereft like the\nsuffering that that maybe chased someone\ninto finding substances that ameliorated\nthat suffering\nexacerbate the suffering a thousand fold\nso what I what I found again using my\nown my own experience and and\npsychedelics were a part of my journey I\nhad I used LSD for the first time when I\nwas 16. had this absolutely profound\nprofound profound I'll never forget it\nunitive experience and for me that I\ncontinue to drink alcoholically and use\na lot of drugs for about eight years\nafter that that unitive experience I had\nwhen I was 16 but it left an indelible\nmark on me and it helped me to\nunderstand that my purse my perception\nof reality is just that it's a\nconstructed perception of reality and I\ncan put this chemical into my body that\nradically alters my perception of\nreality and opens my mind and heart up\nto ways of being and ways of\nunderstanding my place in the world and\nin the universe that weren't previously\navailable to me so this and there's this\nidea of connection of filling the void\nfor me it gets and what we can Bridge\ninto my contemplative practice over the\nyears perhaps but it helps me to\nunderstand the interdependent nature of\nmy own identity the impermanence of all\nphenomena everything arises abides and\nabates like I didn't know all of that\nthen but having this profound numerative\nexperience I was just blown away like\nholy [ __ ] there's it's also not really\nknowing because anybody can say that we\nall know that intellectually that\neverything changes everything arises and\nFalls away but to have a deep emotional\nacceptance of that is a on a different\norder of understanding but I think that\npsychedelics can facilitate that kind of\ndeep emotional understanding that\nconnects\num at like an embodied level this kind\nof detached intellectual understanding\nwhich is really the I think the the\ncompletion of that understanding that\nyou're standing without the embodied\nemotional component is\nsometimes even dangerous\nI agree yeah and that's why integration\nis such an important part of the process\nof of using psychedelics like integrip\nprep work Preparatory work the actual\npsychedelic work and then into\nintegration work afterwards is\ncritically important because this all\ngets wildly complicated but we can talk\nabout the difference between states and\ntraits right you can have a state-based\nexperience where you have a change of\nmind a change of experience this deep\nsomatic kind of uh feeling of connection\nwith all that is this unitive experience\nthat is body based and overwhelms the\nmind in beautiful ways then you can come\nout of that and feel bereft like oh I've\nbeen on like I was plugged in and now\nI've been unplugged so integrative work\nwhich I didn't have when I was 16. I\ncontinued to use psychedelics throughout\nmy kind of late teens and early 20s and\nthen took a long Hiatus like 20-year\nHiatus until recently when I've\nexperimented with them again a bit but\nthat integrative work is so important\nand I think this is the utility of\npsychedelics with addiction it it I love\nthe the metaphor that's often used\nwhat's happening they think\nneurologically is that the Deep grooves\nthat we get into in our cognitive\npatterns right they have neurological\npretty profound neurological correlates\nso they some talk about psychedelic says\nimagine the brain has these it's a it's\na skiing metaphor a sledding metaphor in\nthe snow you imagine these deep grooves\nthat the sled goes down again and again\nand again even if you try to get on cut\na fresh track if you're close you're\ngoing to get pulled into that other\nGroove so these are the repetitive ways\nwe think in the repetitive ways we feel\nthe idea with psychedel and imagine the\npower of that in addiction it's been so\ndeeply ingrained in our psyches and our\nneurology that we're worthless\num that were failures all the stuff that\nI certainly used to think and feel about\nmyself\npsychedelics it is said and they're\nstill investigating all of this of\ncourse it's like a fresh coat of snow\nthat fills in all of the grooves in our\nneurology and we release all these\npriors these prior beliefs these prior\nexperiences and we're able to see the\nworld as if with new eyes and then that\nleaves a mark So integration work is to\nsay that wasn't just [ __ ] like a\ndrug-induced experience you're you were\nable to have a deeply integrated\nexperience of your neurology firing\nsimultaneously this is what it looks\nlike when the brain fires in ways that\nenhance connectivity reduce our\ndependence on the prefrontal cortex and\nthe the seat of this kind of individual\nseparate sense of self that gets relaxed\nand we have more integration through the\nlimbic system and other parts of the\nbrain and it's and experiences fresh and\nnew so a person has the opportunity to\nsee the world in a way they had never\never seen it before and then come back\nout of that experience with skilled\ntherapists\nthat they can then integrate that\nexperience against this prior history\nthat they've had there have been\naccounts where like decades-long\nalcoholics have had a single session\nwith psychedelics and then with\nintegrative work and have not had a\ndrink again for years for many years I\nthink I think it's a really quickly that\nyou explained to Chris with the snow and\nuh I do believe that the integration\nreally is key I've I've worked with a\nnumber of folks in my clinical practice\nwho have gone on let's say one of those\npaid shamanistic experiences they float\ndown the Ecuador or Peru and they had a\ncouple of Ayahuasca ceremonies and they\ncome back and they feel like a new\nperson they they talk about the the\npower and the intensity of the\nexperience how their Destiny was\nrevealed how they were able to examine\nand heal a lot of their pre-existing\npersonal traumas it was\nto listen to them it was like a turning\npoint in their lives yeah but that was\nstill while the metabolites were\ncirculating within them and\nunfortunately after about a month or two\nthey were often largely back to the way\nthat they were before that experience\nmaybe not exactly the same like you said\nbefore uh experience as a teenager uh\neven though you did go back to drinking\nit did you never forgot that experience\nand it may have been part of the\nthe\nthe you know the impetus to eventually\nmove in the direction of recovery you\nknow sure yeah the Paradigm Shift you\nknow it it showed me a different way of\nseeing my place in the world and so\nthere's a lot of potential and substance\nitself but I do believe it does need to\nbe integrated into a person's routine\nand potentially the best way to do that\nis in uh a long-standing relationship or\na community that supports and\nunderstands that type of experience\nbecause it's very difficult to make\nthose changes in isolation\num because also what can be revealed I\nthink in some psychedelic sessions can\nbe\nfairly destabilizing from your you know\npre-existing world view the way that you\nthink reality works in the way that you\nthe universe operates\num some of those long-standing beliefs\ncan be challenged or shattered and that\ncan be very difficult to process\nespecially with somebody who has no who\nhas never experienced something along\nthose lines yeah that's why it's I mean\nassessment is critical they're not for\neverybody there are certain\npresentations where it would be best for\nthe that particular person to to never\nengage with psychedelic use at all so\nscreening everybody yeah screening\nplanning what to expect what to not\nexpect and then and then integration and\nthen like this is underground work's\nbeen happening forever ever since these\nsubstances have been used uh in the Bay\nArea there's a there's been a massive\nunderground movement for a very long\ntime so there are really and and now all\nof these models these training models\nare coming above ground there's loads of\ncertification programs that are\nhappening everywhere and so to to\nprepare therapists to do this work\nskeleton lead so yeah the integrative\nwork is is exceptionally important and\ncontemplative practice a lot of\nmeditators have come to meditative\npractice through psychedelic use in\norder to integrate that experience it's\nkind of sometimes that like the path to\nAwakening has two lanes and the kid this\nis kind of kind of jokes with this the\nfast lane is through psychedelics and\nthe slow lane is through contemplative\npractice I think that it's for me at\nleast it's been a combination of the two\nthe contemplative practice that I've had\nfor many years now is deeply inspired by\nthe experiences that I've had on\npsychedelics so I think part for me part\nof integration is meditation part of\nintegration as you're saying is finding\nCommunity people who have a more kind of\nexpanded view perhaps of a self-world\nconstruct and then developing community\nand continuing to do this really\nimportant work after the experiences and\nimagine if you were in a contemplative\npractice on psychedelics the uh the way\nthat you could potentially accelerate\nyour development now um let's talk about\nConsciousness because you hinted on that\nwith maybe your uh your uh I'm not mean\nto be condescending but Grand Vision of\nthe Psychedelic\nuh work that you're approaching about\nreading an essay by Houston in college\ncalled do drugs have religious import\nand he\npromulgated this theory that one of the\nreasons why human beings evolved so\nrapidly from our primate ancestors is\nthat there was a group of chimps that\nstumbled upon some psychedelic mushrooms\nmost likely and it was like you know the\nmonolith in 2001 suddenly their\nConsciousness has radically been\nelevated and they could\nperceive Through Time versus the Eternal\npresence of the animals or they could\nsee multiple uses of objects as\npotentially tools as opposed to just uh\nyou know things in their environment uh\nhelps them develop language\num that basically the the impetus\nto develop human consciousness was\npotentially a psychedelic experience on\nlike a tribal scale yeah so we're\ntalking about radical\num changes to\nlike\na self as a consequence of\nchanges to Consciousness and this is\nreally tricky because it's we we can\nonly it seems like talk about\nConsciousness in terms of metaphors like\nwe talk about like elevated\nConsciousness it's like but it's not\neven\nis it a thing you know can can something\nthat isn't a thing be elevated like how\ndo you define it if it's hard to Define\nhow can we really talk about it I mean\nwhat do you what do you think about all\nthis\nI love it all I love to talk about it\nthe description that you're the of the\nthe article that you read in you said\ncollege or grad school is depicted in\nthe have you heard of the movie\nfantastic fungi\nuh I saw that uh in the theaters a while\nback yeah okay yeah there's a sequence\nin that movie that depicts they they\ndepicted as early hominids who stumbled\nupon uh psilocybin and then as in and I\nwon't repeat everything you said you\ndescribed it so beautifully but that as\npart of the evolutionary leap that\nhumans made in the animal kingdom some\nof it credited two I think pre-existing\nneurological Evolution and then\nsupercharged with like with the impact\nof psychedelics yeah the topic of\nConsciousness is a massively complicated\none and another one that I'm like an\namateur at kind of philosophically so I\ncan speak about kind of my loosely held\nviews and it's a topic I read a lot\nabout but\num certainly didn't I didn't prepare in\na way to offer uh we're just talking man\nyeah yeah the scientific literature on\nthe subject yeah yeah\nso I I think there's this like\nConsciousness as a thing\num is\nthere's some philosophical I think\nunderpendings that we have to think\nabout like ontological without getting\nsuper fancy here but like ontological\nreductionism as a philosophical stance\nthat one may view Consciousness from\nwhere we can break it down into its\nconstituents parts and that's how we'll\nunderstand it from that position I think\nConsciousness is described by adherence\nto to kind of scientism or or\nontological reductionism more broadly\nthat Consciousness is simply an\nepiphenomenon of Neurology that we don't\nunderstand it but somehow all of this\nkind of neuronal firing happens and a\nbyproduct of that or an epiphenomenon of\nthat is consciousness so that's that's\none phenomenon yeah that's one way to\nunderstand that's just right then we\nhave these contemplative traditions\nwhere the idea is that we as human\nbeings are just plugged into this kind\nof broader almost immaterial awareness\nand we're experiencing awareness when we\nsit in meditation when we quiet the the\nrational mind kind of quiet the left\nhemisphere uh and get in touch with kind\nof right Hemisphere and somatic\nexperience that's when we begin to tap\ninto just awareness more broadly and\npsychedelic experiences I think transmit\nthis as well where we experience our our\nconscious awareness is a an experience\nthat is just\nit's not not quite a prior but it's just\nsomething that we're able to tap into\nit's not thought of as as an as an\nemergent property of Neurology but\nrather we're tapping into something\nBeyond ourselves that we're co-creating\nuh as an experience of being alive in\nthis world so it depends that it gets\ncaught it gets tricky and this is where\nI have to like prepare and think and\nwrite more to present like a coherent\npicture on this\num but there's there's different ways of\napproaching the idea of Consciousness\none based in more physicalism or\nmaterialism and one that's based in more\nof a kind of non-material ontology uh or\napproach to to being and knowing so it\ndepends on which Avenue we're\napproaching\nthe question of Consciousness from\n[Music]\nyeah what does that make me think of\num\nI I kind of operated the assumption that\neverything that I experience occurs\nwithin my Consciousness and it's not\npossible for me to experience something\nbeyond my Consciousness but that doesn't\nnecessarily mean that my Consciousness\nis limited to\nwho I believe I am as a as like Orion as\na as a based creature or even as a\num\na an awareness that's bounded by my uh\nphysical body potentially\nit that's that's getting pretty far out\nthough\num\nyeah so let's actually kind of bring it\nmore practical like what\nwhat what's the point like what what do\nyou get out of it I get that you know\npsychedelic experiences might help\naddicts recover they might help folks uh\nfeel\nuh like they have a place in the world\nand those are no Small Things\num but when we talk about elevating\nconsciousness\nyou know I'm playing devil's advocate\nhere but sell me on how this is not like\nspiritually masturbatory like what's the\npoint\nyeah\nwell I think that that I love the topic\nof spiritual uh spiritual bypass\nspiritual materialism or spiritual\nbypass and I think that there's a risk\nin that in psychedelics experience I\nthink there's a risk in that in\ncontemplative practice for sure and to\nground that concept can you explain what\nthat is to people who might not know\nwhat that is yeah so spiritual bypass in\nparticular is I'm going to take all of\nthe difficulties that in my that are in\nmy life and I'm just going to kind of\nturn from them and it's characterized I\nthink in in\nin judgmental ways as as like uh\nas I don't know kind of like tree hugger\nhippie kind of thing like there's no\nproblems on that one with the world\neverything's fine my contemplative\nmeditation practice and yoga keep me\ngrounded and free and it's a it's a\nneglect or a turning away from actually\nworking through the difficulties that\none might have I love the expression the\nonly way past is through and sometimes\npeople leverage spiritual practices I\nthink sometimes people can leverage\npsychedelics but it's harder to do this\nbecause you can't like you can't play\nwith them they're going to reveal to you\nwhat you need to work on in large part\num but spiritual bypass I always think\nof the image of here's the the issues\nand struggles that I'm having and I'm\njust going to kind of work around them\nthrough this kind of uh spiritual\npractice spiritual materialism on top of\nthat is then I'm going to let people\nknow I'm going to present myself in a\nway I'm going to actually actually\nacquire things that demonstrate to the\nworld that signal to the world just how\nspiritually evolved I am and the fact\nfact of the matter is that core issues\nsometimes haven't been worked through so\nthat's kind of the the concepts of\nspiritual bypass and spiritual\nmaterialism together\nso I think a grout like grounded\ngrounded spirituality or like using\npsychedelics or using contemplative\npractice in a grounded and authentic way\nand relating this to Consciousness\nexpand I love the idea of expanding I\ndon't know elevating or expanding our\nConsciousness so I can recognize what's\nnot me in Buddhism the classic idea is\nnot self and not self so if I as if I\nsit down to meditate I have the I can\ndevelop the ability to see the the\nimpermanent nature as we're describing a\nbit earlier of my thoughts I can watch\nthem arise I can watch them abide I can\nwatch them go I don't know where they're\ncoming from I don't know where they're\ngoing and I don't need to know I can\njust notice them similarly we can notice\nour emotional experiences and not feel\nidentified with them it's not me myself\nand mine like expressions of I am an\nangry person or I am depressed we can\nbegin to question that and I love\nteaching this this gets existential too\nright it's like I am aware of anger in\nmy body in the I like even saying the\nbody I'm aware of anger in the body and\nthen you locate where it is you feel it\nyou watch it you attend to you figure\nout if there's a signal that's worth\npaying attention to or if there's not\nand then if there's not you can just let\nit literally Let It Go watch it go if\nthere is okay what's the message for\nthis emotion oh thank you very much I'm\ngoing to now act on that emotion I don't\nneed you anymore or you've delivered\nyour message so there's a way in which\nwe can become non-identified with our\nthoughts and with our feelings and if we\nthink about thoughts and feelings it's a\nprimary way we we kind of have this self\nidentity the question then becomes well\nwhat's left and what's left is we I love\nthe idea too of transcend and include I\ncan still understand and appreciate what\nit's like to have this rigid\nself-identity and when there's utility\nin that I can identify as a separate\nself who has to take action in the world\nbut I can also let go of that and\nrecognize that this is all ephemeral\nexperience that comes and goes so it's\nthe ability to kind of toggle into that\nspace and that spaciousness of mind I\nthink of it as an expanded consciousness\nuh and then you still have the ability\nto engage as if you were this rigidly\nidentified self but you don't have to be\nattached to that yeah that's really\ninteresting that that any of that make\nsense to me yes well let's let's try to\nunpack that a little bit though the way\nyou were talking about the originally\ndefined self I um that made me think of\nthe ego uh to me the ego is the\ninterface through which I can engage\nwith the world in a practical way and\nthe world can engage with me it's sort\nof like the desktop with the icons it's\nit's so much easier to navigate than\nwhat's actually behind the scenes on the\nprocessing level and it facilitates\ninteraction\nit's like this bottleneck it facilitates\ninteraction between the universe and um\nthe the spaciousness within and I think\nit's a necessary component to our\npsychology so I there's a lot of like\nlet's say prejudicial attitudes around\nego just necessarily equating bad like\nwe have to get rid of ego I don't even\nknow what that would look like like it\nwould be very hard to talk to somebody\nwho didn't have an ego\nincredibly frustrating you probably\ncouldn't get anything done with that\nperson\num to my mind the issue is not the ego\nthe issue is the open identification\nwith the ego which I think you mentioned\nattachment to the ego yeah to me it's\nit's an it's an attachment it's like I\ncan ha I like to use the description if\nI can have an emotion or I can be had by\nthe emotion I can have an ego or I can\nbe had by the ego where I don't I don't\nhave a recognition that there's an ego\nthat's operative right now that I'm\nleveraging for the purposes of our\ndialogue and communication if I if I go\nand lay down on my lawn and I just want\nto look at the sky and experience the\nspaciousness of the sky and my\nConsciousness experiencing the\nspaciousness of that Sky I don't really\nneed the selfie there doesn't need to be\nan eye in there I can let the ego go all\ntogether and not be identified with that\nego self so I can pick it up it's like a\nsuit I can put it on and I can take it\noff I can put it on when I need it and I\ncan take it off most of us don't operate\nin the world that way we are are fused\nwith our ego the ego is is our primary\nmethod of identifying and we're gripped\nso tightly around it we don't even know\nthat we are gripping it it just is what\nis it is it's really problematic it's\nlike being really overly identified with\none of your body parts for instance\nbecause the ego is just one part of your\nyour cycle virtual self yeah totally but\nthat's pretty helpful that's pretty\nnovel for a lot of people that's why I\nlike talking about this like it's like\nso I love teaching people to meditate\nit's like imagine a world in which all\nthis preoccupation with self all this\npreoccupation with being good enough or\nnot good enough imagine a world where\nall of that suffering can just fade away\nand I'm not totally there myself but I\ndo think of that as Awakening like oh\nnone of none of this actually matters I\nmean I think that's also another great\num potential of psychedelics because you\nmight introduce this concept to people\nthat you don't have to identify with the\nego and they're like that sounds great\nhow do you do it like what do you where\ndo you put your hands to detach it's\nlike it's very difficult to kind of\nexplain the process of some of of\narriving at some of these places\num uh psychologically or spiritually but\nfor better for worse what is a common\nexperience to certain psychedelic\nsubstances especially Ayahuasca is\ngenerally referred to as ego death that\nin the first hour uh if you drink the\ntea there is a a really\num often a tight constriction of the\nself where it does feel like it's it's\nabout to die before it kind of explodes\ninto this more expansive experience of\nself or Consciousness or awareness and\num I think the the first few times that\nhappens people can be really terrified\npotentially\num but maybe with repeat experience\npeople can get a little bit more fluid\nwith the ability to kind of move between\nego and non-ego States like yeah sense\nof oh I've gone through this this is my\nfirst rodeo I've gone through this this\nprocess many times\num and I have developed a little bit of\nspaciousness between those two states\nand maybe even some uh\nlike ability to to control it to some\nlevel you know yeah to toggle it to\ntoggle it I don't know it's like\nnon-dual I mean what we're describing\nwithout using the term is non-dual\nawareness right because if one has an\nexperience of non-dual awareness so\nsubject and object Fall Away there isn't\nan eye and a me there's an an eye that\nthat my body is that has used like this\neye can operate this body and there's\nthis Duality that we have internally\nbetween like ego and then self or I and\nself\nnon-dual Consciousness just gets rid of\nof that of that perceived Duality but\nthat's why I like in developmental terms\nthe idea of transcend but include when I\nlearned to crawl or when I learned to\nwalk it doesn't mean I I forgotten how\nto crawl when I learned to run it\ndoesn't you know I've forgotten how to\nwalk when I experience non-dual\nConsciousness or non-dual awareness it\ndoesn't mean I've forgotten how to\noperate in a more dualistic mindset or a\nmore dualistic world view so it just\ngives a different range of of choices uh\nand then awareness I think reduces has\nthe has the benefit perhaps the purpose\nof really reducing what is all of this\negoic suffering that most of us as human\nbeings experience that can actually go\naway this is the the this is what's\nexpressed I'm most familiar with\nBuddhism and this is that we're\ndescribing in some ways the the four\nnoble truths you know there's all sorts\nof different secular and spiritual ways\nto talk and think about this and Alan\nWatts talked about this a lot and he was\none of the first people to bring\nBuddhism into popular Consciousness in\nthe United States in the earlier 20th\ncentury I'm thinking about his book The\nWisdom of insecurity where he basically\nsays that the the sickness that envelops\nmost people today is this idea that\nthere's an eye and a me there the Schism\nis itself the issue and there's\nmanifestations of that like depression\nor anxiety or addictions but the\nfundamental cause of it is that you\nbelieve that there's like this good eye\nand this bad me and the good eye needs\nto kind of whip the bad knee into shape\nso that it becomes in line with its idea\nof how things should be\nthat's kind of a never-ending\num that's a futile Endeavor because you\ncan never actually satisfy it and has\nbeen me really all that bad and is the\neye really all that good maybe those are\nalso part of the you know what's beyond\ngood and evil what's beyond good and bad\nthat's potentially on the other side of\nthis non-dual awareness yeah so let's\nlet me let me press you a little bit\nbecause\num we were talking about how one of the\ngoals of\num your resurgent interest in\npsychedelics is to use it in the\nleadership capacity\nyeah so on some level you'd think wow\nthat sounds really good let's have some\nenlightened leaders heading our Nations\nand our organizations\num but then I'm thinking in Practical\nmatters you get some guy who's elected\npresident and he says you know I and me\nis just an illusion and uh let's all\ncome together in this transitory State\nand I'm aware of the feeling in my in my\nheart about it's like I just don't\nunderstand how that's going to fly you\nknow so again to go back to the idea of\nlike what's the point so I understand\nhow the point of maybe elevating\nConsciousness past a non-dual awareness\nis the alleviation of a great deal of\nlet's say individual suffering and maybe\neven Collective suffering because\nindividual suffering is an active\nusually in our relationships in our\ncommunities\num but how would that help leaders in\nparticular like why would that be\nbeneficial yeah let me see how I just\nwant to take a moment to think how I\nwant to respond to that\num\nso\nhaving I do I'm doing some of this work\nnow so I remain in the corporate\nwell-being organizational development\nleadership development space so why\ndon't I I'm gonna start there okay\nthat'll be the entry point in this is a\nnon-sychedelic I'm not currently using\npsychedelics and leadership development\nwork that I'm doing though I would love\nto at the organization where I am at any\nOrganization for that matter\nso the the approach that I'm taking now\nin leadership development work at the\ncompany I'm currently uh\ncurrently working for is\noperationalizing a very well-known\nframework of emotional intelligence\nDaniel Goldman Daniel Goldman's\nemotional intelligence framework\nand that framework consists of four\nbuilding blocks self-awareness social\nawareness\nor self-awareness self-management on the\nintra personal side social awareness and\nrelationship Management on the\ninterpersonal side so this is a this is\njust a way to get get a foothold here on\nthis topic\nso I joined this company none of this\nhad existed there before so I we could\nask why why did I decide to do that the\nreason that I decided to do that is\nbecause and this is all within the\nconstraints of a for-profit a private\nfor-profit Corporation right we could\ntalk about all of that that's beyond the\nscope of what we're here to talk about\ntoday but I'm talking about within the\nexisting kind of macro economic frame\nthat we we all live in together in the\nworld today so my interest in developing\nthe emotional intelligence of leaders is\nto help them to see beyond themselves to\nsee beyond their interests\nto help the company to see beyond itself\nto see beyond only its interests to have\nindividual leaders again recognize the\nimplicit interdependence that everything\nthat they do relies on\nfor the company to recognize the\nimplicit interdependence that everything\nthat the company does relies on so how\ndo we become I I'm crazy about the idea\nof servant leadership so how do I help\nthose who work at the company where I am\nbecome great servant leaders well first\nLet's help them to recognize this I need\ndifference let's help them to recognize\nthat okay I have this ego that can have\nme or it's something that I can have and\nleverage and use to help my team feel\nlike I really care about them I talk a\nlot about a culture of care like an\nauthentic culture of care where people\nfeel seen heard cared for and understood\nwe need a lot of emotional intelligence\nto get there we need to understand that\nto me the law of of mutuality and\nreciprocity in our relationships when we\ndemonstrate this level of care that's\nborn through emotional intelligence high\nlevel emotional intelligence\nwhich can push us into close to I think\nat the higher levels to this kind of\nnon-dual awareness then I have people\nwho who are happier they're healthier\nfrom a business outcome perspective\nthey're going to stay longer they're\ngoing to work more efficiently and more\neffectively they're going to be better\nteammates they're going to be more\nlikely to then Advance with the company\nand that's going to help us to meet our\ngoals as a company even more effectively\non the corporate side what is like\nthere's a lot of talk about crypromise a\nlittle bit Corporate social\nresponsibility ESG work environment\nsustainability and governance in the\ncorporate world right now I roll my eyes\nbecause some of it has just become like\ntable Stakes you have to present what\nyou're doing there's a lot of\nsuperficial work that's being done I\nlike to ask myself what is this what\ndoes this work look like in in a really\nauthentic and meaningful way it means\nthat we have operations and a lot of\nEmerging Markets what would it be like\nfor us to actually understand what it is\nto be a good corporate citizen in this\nenvironment what would it be like to\nconnect with with non-profits that are\nin the area and have our employees\nvolunteer with them there's there's a\nsense of self that's expanded we\nunderstand that I am a part of something\nthat's greater than me I only work at\nthe company I work because the company\nexists I can only contribute to the\ncommunity where we have operations\nbecause the community exists the only\nreason we get to be there so there's\nthat you see what I'm talking about\nthere's like these concentric circles in\nexpanding the way we identify with our\nwith ourselves and with our community I\nthink for me psychedelics as you've\ndescribed with what Ellen Watts has said\nand others have experienced that\nexperienced it's like this rapid like\npulling down of the veil it's like whoa\nholy cow I am so deeply connected with\nall that is and you don't have to tell\nme I just experienced it it's like we\ndon't need an 18-hour emotional\nintelligence training we need a\npsychedelic Journey or a retreat that's\nwell facilitated and has integrated\nleadership development coaching\nafterwards and then we're going to\naccelerate this kind of development in\nthe core corporate world or in ngos or\nin government so much more rapidly and\nquickly than we can with these more what\nI think it was more kind of pedestrian I\nget frustrated it's like oh my God we\ncould be doing this so much more\nefficiently\nif we add some psychedelic magic in the\nmix so like the caricature that you said\nof a president saying we are all one\nthere we have real and I'm an idealist\nabsolutely uh and I'm committed to\nidealism and then we'll fall short I'll\nfall short of the ideals that I have but\nat least it'll get me at least hopefully\nsomewhere in the direction of doing good\nwith and for the world\nwe have these profound crises that we're\nfacing we have climate we have a climate\ncrisis we have uh socio-political crisis\nwe have tied into an economic crisis\nlike we in my view we we better evolve\nour our ability to lead more effectively\nin a way that's based in holism and not\nin like this reductionistic materialism\nthat's a choice that we can if we can\nevolve enough Minds to say hey what\nwould it be like to live Jeremy lent is\na philosopher who I love reading what\nwould it be like to live in a world\nthat's prioritizing our ecological\nintegration with the life that is all\naround us as opposed to the the\nexploitation of of Natural Resources\nlike we can talk about fundamental\nshifts in the way we relate to one\nanother and we relate to the natural\nworld so I get idealistic in that\ndirection so this would be a project\nthat would take some time\nthere's something that I've read I\nforget who wrote this like if you change\nif we if we can be successful in\nevolving the consciousness of three\npercent of the world population they'll\nbe not going to affect secondary effects\nsecond third order effects where then\nthe cascading changes will just start to\nhappen in a way that develops a more\ntruly sustainable\nsustainable world so that's it I went on\nfor a while there but oh it's good I'd\nlove to hear your perspective I'm not\nnearly as idealistic as you are um but I\ndo have your beliefs about the necessity\nfor for leadership and I I don't think\nthat we see a lot of um great leadership\nuh in today's day and age and I think\npartly that has to do with we we need\nfolks who are um you know willing to\nstand on their mission and to be\ninvolved with their uh vision for the\nfuture even if it makes them unpopular I\nthink a lot of leadership these days is\nbased on maintaining positions of power\nwhich is generally about catering to\nwhat people kind of want to hear and\nthere's a certain pragmatics that goes\ninto you know politics that can't\npractically be ignored\num but a lot of policies these days are\nare made by you know popular opinion\nwhich is of course shaped by the social\nmedia and it becomes this kind of\nvicious cycle where you know who's\nreally leading who and uh it's becoming\nI don't know if it's becoming harder\nmaybe it's always been rare but for\nsomeone to to stand up with a bold New\nVision for the future that that is uh\nand he's willing to or she's willing to\nadvance even if\nuh it may not be popular to do so and I\nthink that's actually where some of the\ngreat transformational social movements\nhave come from in my interest in memory\nnot because they've emerged out of let's\nsay uh\npopularity polls for what the uh the\ngeneral populace things needs to happen\ntotally yeah I mean but that from a\npolitical political leadership\nperspective I couldn't agree more I mean\nwe're in the throes of populist\nmovements around the world and when\nwe're living with the consequences of\nthat that's not leader that's not\nleading that's following right it's I I\nlike servant leadership is is\nidentifying what are the problems that\nwe can agree are happening and then\nboldly leading new solutions to those\nproblems populism for me isn't even like\npopulist leaders to me in a way aren't\neven leaders they're they're just\nwriting the coattails of popular opinion\nstoking stoking up the energies that\nsupport those popular opinions and then\nexacerbating the divisions I think that\nare present and this is across the\npolitical Spectrum exactly that's what I\nwas going to say I don't see that\nnecessarily unique to what it's\ntraditionally a popularly identified as\npopulist movements I think both sides\nare doing it across the Spectrum Chris I\nthink we could probably talk for the\nnext several hours but we might be\ntaxing my audience's attention span at\nthis point um uh really interesting\nconversation I loved what we were\ngetting into with the psychedelics and\nthe Consciousness in particular and I\nhope that will be of interest to the\nlisteners as well\num if people do let me ask you do you\nwant to be found usually at this point\nin the conversation I talk to people who\nhave like social media presences and\nthey're like hey if people want to know\nmore about you and what you're doing\nthis is how they can find you do you\nwant to be found and if so how would you\nwant people to find you yeah I mean\nthrough Linkedin is the easiest way to\nfind me if you just search Chris\nHarrison I think I'm in there as like\nChris Harrison PhD to make it easier to\nfind me\num that's the easiest place I don't yeah\nI don't have a big social social media\num\nI always love networking with people so\nsure I'll put a link to your uh LinkedIn\nin the description of your video then\nokay any final words before we wrap up\njust thank you yeah it's just fun to\nhave this conversation with you thank\nyou for what you're doing and yeah maybe\nsome people heard some things they\nhadn't heard before and it's piqued your\ninterest in checking out things maybe\nyou hadn't thought about checking out\nbefore so I think so I hope so anyway\nyeah me too it was a real pleasure to\ncatch up and to have you on the podcast\ntoday Chris thank you for your time bye\nguys thank you all right bye-bye"
