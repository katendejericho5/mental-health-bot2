    "transcript": "ideally at the end of an hour or two\nwhen it's time to get up to leave she's\ngoing to say wow the time just flew by\nbut I just talked about myself the whole\ntime there's still so much I don't know\nabout you and it's like good because the\nlonger we draw this out the more likely\nthat the woman is going to be willing to\nstick around once the fantasy she has of\nyou is inevitably shattered but if it's\nbroken too soon it's not gonna work and\nlet me just say this isn't about\ntricking women at least not any more\nthan women's makeup and fashion is about\ntricking men women why don't you show up\non a first date in sweatpants without\nwearing makeup because you don't want to\ndo anything to disturb the fantasy that\nthe man might have of you too early in\nthe courtship process maybe I don't know\notherwise he's probably not going to\nstick around long enough to want to\ncultivate a relationship with you\npossibly you can show him later once\nhe's already hooked right so it's like\nit works both ways"
