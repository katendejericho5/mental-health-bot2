    "transcript": "I think when you teach kids that men and\nwomen are equal what they often hear is\nthat men and women are the same because\nthat's another interpretation of\nequality like when we say 1 + 2 equal 3\nwe're basically saying that those two\nmathematical propositions are\ninterchangeable that we can we can\ncommute them around and we don't lose\nany truth that statement is the same\nbackwards and forwards that's what\nequality is from a logical perspective\nright and so I think what that has\npotentially done culturally is kind of\nmade men more feminine and women more\nmasculine and I believe that that has\nmade that has created some opportunities\nfor the sexual Marketplace but it's\nmostly created confusion and liabilities"
