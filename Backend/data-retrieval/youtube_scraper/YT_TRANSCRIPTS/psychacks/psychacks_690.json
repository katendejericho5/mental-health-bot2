    "video_title": "Carl Jung and the SHADOW SELF: reflections on Full Metal Jacket",
    "transcript": "I think one way that we can think about\narchetypes is that they're Universal\nsymbols that they exist in the\ncollective Consciousness and may even\nhave like a biological origin and these\nare ways of perceiving that all human\nbeings are capable of\num they're all human beings are capable\nof regardless of their culture or their\nlanguage so these are symbols like\num\nlike death\nor like\num the wise old man or\num the empress things like that you know\nthe kind of stuff that shows up on tarot\ncards actually yeah so it I think that\nthere is a strong argument for the\npossibility of archetypal symbology in\nall human beings just like there seems\nto be some Universal human emotions that\nare always kind of as far as we know\nexperience but certainly expressed in\nthe same way regardless of people's\nculture or socialization\num what have you what have you done with\nrespect to junkian archetypes in your\nwork Rob\nwell funnily enough I just finished\nediting uh yesterday morning or the day\nbefore\num I've got a new video that I haven't\nput out yet which is on um\nCarl Jung's uh quite short book called\nthe Undiscovered self\num I read that for the first time\nrecently and it's only 79 pages so\nsometime recorded that\num\nyeah I mean I've been aware of Carl\nJung's stuff for a long time I've read\nabout his theories but never read his\nbooks until recently I think I've read\nsome of his papers before\num and I I think it's fantastic he's\nabsolutely brilliant he was so ahead of\nthe Kev and like the stuff that he was\nwriting away back in the 1950s is\nabsolutely relevant today\num yeah so I mean was there some\nspecific aspect of young that you wanted\nto discuss there well you've made a\ncouple of videos on the Shadow and I\nthink the shadow is really interesting\nbecause there are a few different ways\nthat we can approach the idea of the\nShadow both in jungian Psychology and in\nother forms of psychology\num I think there are two general\num ways to approach it that I'm aware of\nand you can correct me if you if you\nwant to change the definition or if you\nhave another idea one is that the shadow\nis sort of the disavowed self it's the\npart of myself that I don't allow myself\nto acknowledge and so I deny and repress\nand and see it in other people and want\nto destroy the projected evil that I\nperceive in others because I'm willing\nto accept it in myself I think that is\nthe more let's say jungian approach to\nit there's another\num idea about the shadow that basically\nsays the shadow is kind of inescapable\neven if you were to do all of this deep\npersonal\nyou know psychological work to kind of\nlike understand your demons as we say to\nintegrate Your Shadow you still have a\nshadow you can't get away from it\nbecause your shadow in this\nconceptualization is just the sum of all\nof your unchosen lines\nthat it's not necessarily a bad thing\nit's just the path that you didn't take\nand on some level The Shadow\nbecomes even more dangerous to the\nindividual when the unchosen path\nrepresents let's say greater happiness\nand prosperity than the one that you\ndecided to take does that make sense\nyeah yeah\num okay so let's try to think there so\nso you're talking about the like the the\nrejected part of ourselves absolutely\nthat's so big I totally agree with that\nand we projected on to others and then\nwe we hate the other people who we\nprojected onto absolutely and uh you\nknow I mean young talked about that in\nterms of world of thought world affairs\nWars and stuff you know it's like he\nsaid virtually all was it's just two\nsides each projecting their own shadow\nonto the other side and then attacking\nit you know so\num he talked about the the mutual\nwithdrawing of projections as a way of\nstopping War not an easy thing to\npersuade all the leaders to do is it\num and then the other one you mentioned\ncan you just clarify that for me a\nlittle bit again yeah rather it be like\nso in the first definition the things\nthat I'm disavowing of myself are like\nmy own capacity for cruelty my own\ndarkness my own hatred my own envy and\nselfishness\nI'd prefer you know like I'd prefer to\nthink of myself as all good as righteous\nas honest as forthright but like those\nthose darknesses live inside of me you\nknow and I if if I don't get through\nthem they're always there they're built\nin um\nyeah and so uh it's in our nature the\nway we we grew up and you know the way\nwe evolved we had to fight we had to be\nwe had to fear you know all that kind of\nstuff yeah it's yeah you can't get\nreally you can become aware of the\nShadow and lessen its effect on you so\nthat you don't project so much but you\ncan't get rid of it that's my\nunderstanding of it yeah and I think\nthat the more that I do that shadow work\nmyself and accept those parts of myself\nI've become more compassionate and\npatient with other people because it's\nlike yeah and when I see this and other\npeople I'm like well you know have I\nreally done have I done something that\nbad myself in the past maybe I have\ncould and if I haven't could I yeah I\nprobably could so\num you know I don't want to give bad\nbehavior a pass but it is important to\nthe we can respond to that behavior\nwithout necessarily needing to hate it\nor destroy it absolutely so yeah so\nthat's that's one part the other part is\nthat um like\nthink think about this maybe there's an\narchetypal story I can't think of one on\ntop of my head but there's like two twin\nbrothers and one person takes the path\nof I'm becoming a scholar and I'm\nworking hard and I'm getting married and\nbecoming a productive member of society\nthe other person takes the path of I\nwant uh a life of adventure and\nexploration and\num danger and like this intensity of\nLife neither one is necessarily bad or\nwrong but one is kind of the shadow of\nthe other because they couldn't take\nyou'd either take one path or the other\nand on some level that twin becomes the\nshadow of the other person because\num they represent all of their the way\ntheir life could have been but they\ndidn't choose does that make sense so\nall of the uh motivations the desires\nthat would have unpinned the the would\nhave been the basis of that ultimate\nlife if it had happened\nyou go down a different path but\nokay I guess you could say the edge for\nthe the path that you didn't go down\nthat edge is still there you could refer\nto that as like the shadow sure because\nwhenever we make a choice we actually\nhave to forbear every other decision out\nthere and so every decision requires\nthis sacrifice and that means like\nactually giving up a huge part of our\nlives and a huge part of our our\npotentiality it's like my best friend in\nin high school he right out of college\nwent to law school and he got a\ncorporate job and he bought a house and\ngot married and I was an actor and I was\nliving this kind of life and he would\nlook at me sometimes and think oh Ryan\nyou're so free you get to do kind of\nwhatever you want and I was like yeah\nbut I'm broke and you got a nice house\nand a fancy car so it's like we just\nrepresented the path that the other\ndidn't take okay yeah yeah that's a lot\nof paths there it is right yeah\nyeah but so I think in that case the\nshadow is more around like Choice points\nit's like if I could\num you know what would my life have been\nlike if I didn't marry this person or if\nI didn't become a doctor but it's\nusually around really or even that this\ntragedy didn't befall me you know what\nI'm saying that's a big one yeah\nso it's not necessarily about the the\nnegative that's just another way of\nlooking at it but we can talk about\neither one of those definitions of the\nShadow or something else I think I got\nwhat you mean though yeah I mean it's um\nthe the term Shadow because Shadows are\nliterally dark implies that it's a\nnegative uh\nnature to the to the shadow but yeah I\ndefinitely agreed as\neither whether you would call it the\nsame Shadow wall whether we've got\nmultiple Shadows that come with us and\nsome are more positive some are more\nnegative yeah but definitely I agree\nthat there's\num\nan unconscious side of us that follows\nus that's full of positive things\ndefinitely yeah I definitely agree\nthat's the case I mean whether you want\nto lump that in with the negative side\nand call it as one or whether you can\nseparate it out into different pieces\nfor them but we're getting into\nmathematical uh\nrelationship comparisons there so I\ndon't think the words really can do it\njustice can they you know they often\ncan't so I was bringing this up in the\ncontext of your analysis of a full metal\njacket do you want to talk about that or\ndo you want me to try yeah great yeah\nyeah so what do you what do you see is\nthe role of the shadow in that film\nuh the main thing that I see is the the\nsplit between the two halves of the\nmovie the first half and the second half\nand a lot of people don't like the\nsecond half of the movie this is quite\ninteresting because uh I mean young\ntalked about\nthat a lot of people don't like\naccessing their own unconscious they\ndon't want to be aware of their own\nshadow it's uncomfortable isn't it you\nknow so um so naturally they don't like\nthe second half of the little jackets so\nmuch because it gets into the the the\nyoungin Shadow thing uh and you know\nKubrick did talk about Carl Jung in\nrelation to Full Metal jackets and\ninterviews he specifically said that he\nand the co-writer Michael Hare who wrote\nthe book uh is called dispatches which\nFull Metal Jacket takes many of its\nscenes from\num Kubrick said that he and Michael hair\nwere specifically talking about ways of\ngetting Young's The Shadow into full\nmetal jackets so I mean you know never\nmind all the secrecy that with 2001\nSpace Odyssey that Kubrick was pretty\nopen about putting uh jungi and Shadow\nConcepts into full metal jacket it's not\nso obvious when you watch the movie\nbecause nobody tells you except for that\none moment when um The Joker character\nis talking to I think is a kernel or a\nand sort of high rank an officer and the\nofficer the officer demands to know from\nwhy have you got a peace symbol on your\nyour jacket and you've got born to kill\nwritten on your helmet and Joker says I\nwas trying to make um a comment about\nThe Duality of Man the jungian thing you\nknow that that's quite a blatant\ngiveaway for Kubrick I mean he's not\nnormally that blatant but you know he\nslipped it in there\num so yeah but for me the overall split\nthat happens in that movie is between\nthe first and second half and the way I\nview it is that the recruits in the\nfirst half of the movie\nthey are shadowed in the second half of\nthe movie\nthose recruits in the first half are\nreborn as\nthe Lost hog Squad in the second half of\nthe movie uh I did have a video up there\nat fact it's still up uh about Full\nMetal Jacket called um it was about the\nprivate pile character\num Born Again hard I think I called the\nthe video I haven't watched that one a\nfew days ago I thought that was really\ninsightful yeah so so you know the basic\npoint where private pile his death is\nsymbolic in the toilets in the first\nhalf of the movie and that's like\nkilling off the the innocent child he's\nlike a baby like innocent character and\nin the military training they want to\nkill that off they want to get rid of\nyour innocence and your your\nchildishness and just turn you into a\nman I mean they literally call you we're\ngoing to turn you into a man that that's\nstandard jargon in you know military\ntraining so they want to get rid of the\ninfants so he gets killed off uh\nsymbolically in the first half and then\nhe comes back in the second half uh his\nshadow is the character called animal\nmother and if you watch the two\ncharacters they have similar facial\nexpressions similar height and build\none's fat and the other ones suddenly\nbecome lean and um yeah so this that\nthat's your Shadow at work right there\nand what neither of them is aware of the\nother animal mother never ever makes any\nreference to uh the first half of the\nmovie in fact in the second half of the\nmovie nobody talks about the first half\nof the movie at all\num the cowboy character shows up in the\nsecond half and Joker meets up with them\nbut it's like the first half of the\nmovie didn't even exist I think that\nfreaks people out and watching film out\nof jackets like you're watching two\nseparate movies\num and I think it was like they're two\nheart two hemispheres of the brain\nseparate of the oil and but it's not\njust animal mother who that happens with\nlots of the other characters in the\nfirst half of the movie appear to be\nreborn in the second half so you've got\nprivate snowball which is the black\ncharacter in the first half and he\nbecomes private eight ball in the second\nhalf\nand he gets killed later\num and yet yeah so that that's that's\nthe way I look at it is the the squad is\nreborn as their jungian shadows in\nVietnam and the military has split their\npsyche so that they've become somebody\nelse and they can't even remember who\nthe hell they were when he started the\nbasic training"
