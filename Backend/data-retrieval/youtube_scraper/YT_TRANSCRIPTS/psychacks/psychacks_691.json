    "transcript": "if a woman agrees to a date she can't\nreally be interested in you because she\ndoesn't really know who you are she has\nvery little information on which to base\nthat decision one way or another\nshe's not in a position to evaluate who\nyou are as a person or as a potential\nlover\nthis is something that is really\nimportant to understand she's there on\nthe date not because she's attracted to\nyou but because she's attracted to her\nidea of you\nbasically you presented her with enough\nraw material to serve as the basis for\nan attraction that she subsequently\nelaborated for herself\nthis means that she filled in the\nsizable gaps in her knowledge base with\npositive fantasies of what she would\nlike to encounter there\nand the higher her attraction more\npositive the fantasies she elaborates\nand that's why she's there"
