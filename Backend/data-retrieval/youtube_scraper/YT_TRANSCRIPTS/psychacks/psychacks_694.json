    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is most men\nblow the first date\nso as a man it is hard to get a date\nwith a woman you generally either have\nto approach a number of women in real\nlife or swipe through hundreds of\nprofiles online before finding someone\nwilling to give you a chance\nboth are difficult to do and require\ndifferent skill sets for Success however\njust because you're able to get a date\nwith a woman that doesn't mean that it's\nsmooth sailing from there on out\nall it means is that you've passed\nthrough the first of many many filters\nin the funnel and on a date things can\ngo wrong in a multitude of different\nways at nearly every moment\nfun\nand indeed the fact of the matter is\nthat most men blow the first date and\nI'm here to tell you why that is the\ncase so you can prevent it from\nhappening in the future okay now when I\nsay that most men blow the first date\nyou have to understand that on some\nlevel\nif you actually succeed in securing it\nthe first date is yours to lose men it\nis yours to lose and what do I mean by\nthis I mean that if a woman is actually\ngoing to block off her calendar put on\nmakeup get dressed up leave her house\nand go out to see you as opposed to\nseeing anyone else in the world when she\ncould be sitting at home in her\nsweatpants watching reality TV it means\nthat her interest level in you at least\nat the time she made the plan is more\nthan 50 percent\nso all other things being equal she's\nmore of a yes than a no if she actually\nshows up on the date and this means that\na lot of guys are snatching defeat from\nthe jaws of success\nlike I said If a woman shows up she's\nmore than 50 percent interested in you\nbut think about it\nhow could that possibly be the case\nif you picked her up in real life you\nprobably just had a few minutes of\nactual interaction and if you met on a\ndating app it's possible that you've\nnever actually seen each other or spoken\nto each other in real time\nif a woman agrees to a date\nshe can't really be interested in you\nbecause she doesn't really know who you\nare\nshe has very little information on which\nto base that decision one way or another\nshe's not in a position to evaluate who\nyou are as a person or as a potential\nlover\nthis is something that is really\nimportant to understand she's there on\nthe date not because she's attracted to\nyou\nbut because she's attracted to her idea\nof you\nbasically you presented her with enough\nraw material to serve as the basis for\nan attraction that she subsequently\nelaborated for herself\nthis means that she filled in the\nsizable gaps in her knowledge base with\npositive fantasies of what she would\nlike to encounter there and the higher\nher attraction the more positive the\nfantasies she elaborates until she's\nmore or less attracted to the idea of\nwho she wants you to be or hopes you\ncould be\nokay and that's why she's there\nit's this fantasy in her mind that\nmotivated her to leave her house and\nmeet up with in many cases a total\nstranger so you can appreciate that this\nfantasy is a powerful thing\nbut here's the thing guys\nyou don't know what that fantasy is\nthis is really important to appreciate\nyou don't know what that fantasy is it\nexists in the covert recesses of her\nprivate Consciousness so how do men blow\nthe first date simple\nthey show up on the first date and they\ntry to impress the woman\nand they generally do this because a\nlittle knowledge is a dangerous thing\nthey do this because they watch some\nYouTube videos about what women want and\nthey learned about hypergamy and they\nthink women are attracted to money\nstatus and Power\nno problem I'll make sure they know how\nmuch money I have how much status I\nenjoy and how much power I yield\nbasically they just need to know that\nI'm a high value man and they'll be\nbegging for it\nnow this is not entirely wrong but in\nterms of seducing a particular woman it\nis mostly wrong especially given the\nfact that men tend to go about\ndemonstrating their value in such\ninelegant and ham-fisted ways too many\nmen think that bragging about their\nprofessional exploits or their lifestyle\nfor an hour or two will get them laid\nand it won't it will generally only get\nthem angry\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the super\nthanks button which those three little\ndots in the lower right hand corner and\ntip me in proportion to the value you\nbelieve you've received from this video\nyour support makes all of this happen so\nthank you\nnow the question is if the general\ntruths about hypergamy are correct why\ndoesn't this strategy work\nit's simple\nin the act of trying to impress a woman\nyou will inevitably reveal more and more\ndetails about who you actually are and\nhow you actually live\nand the likelihood that any of those\ndetails will actually correspond with\nthe fantasy that any particular woman\nhas in her mind about who she wants you\nto be or hopes you could be\nare functionally zero\nat this stage of the game your actual\nself has a near zero probability of\naccording with the woman's private\nfantasy about who you might be\nand remember it's the fantasy that is\nactually motivating her to be there in\norder to explore the possibility of some\nkind of future together\nmen\nyou do not want to disabuse a woman of\nher fantasy of who you are too quickly\nand every time you open your mouth you\nchip away at that fantasy a little bit\nmore with every word that you say\nmost men blow the first date because\nthey spend way too much talking about\nthemselves my God on a first date the\nwoman should ideally be doing the vast\nmajority of the talking as the man all\nyou really need to do is to provide her\nwith interesting emotionally compelling\nprompts so that she can spend most the\ntime talking about herself and\nexperiencing her own emotions\ndo this and she will not only retain her\noriginal Fantasy of you but she will\nalso become even more attracted by\nassociating her felt experience with you\nand this is something that you have to\ntake the lead on men because if you\ndon't the date will likely devolve into\na job interview where the woman's going\nto ask a lot of clothes ended factual\nquestions because she doesn't really\nknow what she's doing and walk away\nfeeling that you were a nice guy but she\ndidn't really feel anything\nthe woman should be talking three to\nfour times as much as you\nevery once in a while she will ask you a\nquestion\nno problem answer it in brief and in\nanother open-ended question right back\nat her\nif you do this correctly she's going to\nwalk away from the encounter feeling\nheard\nfeeling listened to and having\nexperienced all of these different\nemotions inside of herself and that's\ngoing to significantly increase the\nchances that she'll want to see you\nagain\nideally at the end of an hour or two\nwhen it's time to get up to leave she's\ngoing to say wow\nthe time just flew by but I just talked\nabout myself the whole time there's\nstill so much I don't know about you\nand it's like good because the longer we\ndraw this out the more likely that the\nwoman is going to be willing to stick\naround once the fantasy she has of you\nis inevitably shattered but if it's\nbroken too soon it's not going to work\nand let me just say this isn't about\ntricking women at least not any more\nthan women's makeup and fashion is about\ntricking men\nwomen why don't you show up on a first\ndate in sweatpants without wearing\nmakeup\nbecause you don't want to do anything to\ndisturb the fantasy that the man might\nhave of you too early in the courtship\nprocess maybe I don't know otherwise\nhe's probably not going to stick around\nlong enough to want to cultivate a\nrelationship with you possibly uh\nyou can show him later once he's already\nhooked right\nso it's like it works both ways but this\nepisode is about men and men blow the\nfirst date by talking too much about\nthemselves in their attempts to impress\nthe woman\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well
