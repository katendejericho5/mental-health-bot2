    "transcript": "if you watch the First episodes you'll\nsee how far the channel has come in the\nlast two years and I kind of learned by\ndoing I didn't really buy a whole bunch\nof fancy equipment I didn't spend\nthousands of dollars in promotions in\nfact I haven't promoted this at all I\nhaven't paid for viewers I haven't paid\nto promote this in any social media the\ngrowth has been entirely organic um and\nthat's because you don't make any money\non YouTube for a very long time and even\nonce you start making money it's very\nlittle for quite some time afterwards\nso uh I had to kind of just make the\ndecision to start where I was at and\nhave faith that I would kind of learn as\nI went and I think that's actually a\nreally good way of doing this and pretty\nmuch anything it's like it's better just\nto start where you're at and put in\nmassive effort and Learn by doing\nbecause it's you're gonna suck in the\nbeginning"
