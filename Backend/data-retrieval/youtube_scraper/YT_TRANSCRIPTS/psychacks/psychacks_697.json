    "transcript": "basically I'm a psychologist in private\npractice and I specialize in men's\nMental Health\nand I've been in private practice for a\nwhile and I've been feeling fairly\nconfident about the work that I do with\nmy clients I felt that what I could\noffer might be of benefit to an even\ngreater proportion of the population so\nI tried to think about how I could do\nthat so of all the different options\nthat I considered it seemed like\nstarting a YouTube channel might be\nworth trying I committed in that moment\nto working on this podcast and\nPublishing regularly like clockwork with\nno exceptions for at least three years\nand if I still didn't reach my primary\nthreshold of success I would reevaluate\nat that time and that primary threshold\nof success was a hundred thousand\nsubscribers so we've reached that in a\nlittle less than two so I overshot the\ntime estimate but that's you know better\nthan the other way around because I\nmight have given up"
