    "transcript": "hi everybody it's me Dr Orion taraban\nand I thought that I would do something\na little different today we passed a\nsignificant Milestone on the channel\nvery recently where we finally arrived\nat 100\n000\n100\n000 subscribers it's almost\nbaffling to me that this has actually\noccurred\num\nthis happened\nto the day\n102 weeks after I began\nfirst posting on this channel\nand um I wanted to take some time to\nthank everybody for their enormous\nSupport over the last two years\nand for those who are interested to to\ntalk a little bit about my story and why\nI started this channel\nand how I ended up here and if that\ndoesn't interest you just wait for the\nnext psychics episode so first it's\nreally important for me to express my\ngratitude for all of you it's so\nhumbling\nto think that there are\nthat there are a hundred thousand people\nout there who care what I\nhave to say it's an amazing privilege\nit's one that I don't take lightly\nas I've mentioned in my posts the more\nof you there are the more I'm inspired\nto put more work and Care into what I do\nand I hope that that will only continue\nin a virtuous cycle moving forward\num I obviously couldn't be doing this\nwithout you and I kind of feed on that\nenergy\nit's motivated me to remain consistent\nthrough the times when it's been\nrather difficult to keep going sometimes\nI don't know how many of you out there\nhave ever tried to start a YouTube\nchannel it's it's easy to start I mean\nanybody can record something and put it\non the internet but it's very very\ndifficult to achieve any kind of\ntraction so I'm extremely grateful\nI can't wait to walk with you even\nfurther because I have big things in\nstore for the channel\nand I\nI'm just flabbergasted that we're here\nso thank you very much\nfor those of you are interested I'd like\nto tell you a little bit about\nthe story of this channel because I get\nasked that from time to time in the\nquestions so basically I'm a\npsychologist in private practice and I\nspecialize in men's Mental Health\nand I've been in private practice for a\nwhile and I've been feeling fairly\nconfident about the work that I do with\nmy clients and it's extremely rewarding\nlike being a psychotherapist is\nit's really the best job in the world\nand it's extremely fulfilling that said\nI was getting to the point where I was\nstruggling with the fact that if I was\nsuccessful in my private practice that\nmeans that I was really only helping\nmaybe 30 people a month\nand while that's important I mean to\nactually make a difference in the lives\nof 30 people is no small thing\nI felt that what I could offer might be\nof benefit to an even greater proportion\nof the population\nso I tried to think about how I could do\nthat I could try writing a book which\nI'm starting to work on\num but it's very hard for anyone to read\nyour book if no one really knows who you\nare or cares about what you have to say\nso of all the different options that I\nconsidered it seemed like starting a\nYouTube channel might be worth trying\nso I did a little research in an\nafternoon and\nlooked into what made a YouTube channel\nsuccessful\nand based on my research I gave myself\nthree years\nI committed in that moment to working on\nthis podcast and Publishing regularly\nlike clockwork with no exceptions for at\nleast three years\nand if I still didn't reach my primary\nthreshold of success I would reevaluate\nat that time but I committed myself to\nthree years and that primary threshold\nof success was a hundred thousand\nsubscribers so we've reached that in a\nlittle less than two so I uh overshot\nthe time estimate but that's you know\nbetter than the other way around because\nI might have given up\nso I started to work on episodes and the\nFirst episodes I published are still\navailable on the channel I think I'm\ngoing to leave them up there at least\nthe first few\nforever because I think it's really\nimportant for people to see\nthat when\nthat everything that they see on the\ninternet it didn't just sort of like\nmaterialize effortlessly like if you\nwatch the First episodes you'll see how\nfar the channel has come in the last two\nyears\num I've made a lot of changes and I\nthink therefore the better and I kind of\nlearned by doing I didn't really buy a\nwhole bunch of fancy equipment I didn't\nspend thousands of dollars in promotions\nin fact I haven't promoted this at all I\nhaven't paid for viewers I haven't paid\nto promote this in any social media the\ngrowth has been entirely organic\num and that's because you don't make any\nmoney on YouTube for a very long time\nand even once you start making money\nit's very little for quite some time\nafterwards\nso uh I had to kind of just make the\ndecision to start where I was at and\nhave faith that I would kind of learn as\nI went and I think that's actually a\nreally good way of doing this and pretty\nmuch anything it's like it's better just\nto start where you're at and\nput in massive effort and Learn by doing\nbecause\nit's you're gonna suck in the beginning\nand those first few episodes I mean it's\nhard to hear I'm kind of rambling\num I was in a different location I mean\nI learned a lot\nby doing and also by listening to\nfeedback that I received and it wasn't I\nthink until around the 80th episode or\nso that I received any kind of traction\nat all and this is something to really\nkeep in mind is that that meant for like\num maybe like 10 months I was putting in\neffort every single day sometimes for\nhours every single day\nand getting like absolutely zero\nreinforcement\nyou do this for a while and you put a\nlot of effort into what you're doing and\nit's just like throwing it into the void\nof the internet nobody sees it you're\ninvisible to the algorithm you get no\nmoney you get no praise you get no\nattention\nand it's actually extremely hard to keep\ngoing through that and the reason I did\nwas because I made that firm commitment\nto myself from the outset that no matter\nwhat happened I would do this for at\nleast three years\nand um\nthat's something to consider a lot of\npeople I think quit during that time\nperiod before their efforts start to\nbear fruit For Better or For Worse It\ngenerally takes a while for people to\ncare\nenough to even pay attention to anything\nthat you're saying or doing\nand\nI remember the days where I would get\nlike one subscriber and it was\nit was really cool I think for those\nfirst 10 months I had like 40\nsubscribers\num\nin fact in January\n2022 YouTube told me I had I think I had\nthat many I think 39 subscribers when I\nstarted\nlast year now here we are at a hundred\nthousand so you nothing happens for a\nvery long time\nand then suddenly everything kind of\nstarts to happen all at once and I think\nthat's true in a lot of different\ndomains of life\num\nsuccess and progress is rarely a\npositive slope up and to the right\nso if you can understand that\nyou might be able to get through the\nperiods where it's very difficult until\nthat point where things start to click\num basically the way that I have moved\nmy intention here is to as I say in my\ndescription to reduce the unnecessary\nsuffering in the world and the way I do\nthat is basically by working with my\nclients and of course everything is\nanonymous and\num I don't\nmention anybody in my work but a lot of\nwhat I talk about on this channel comes\nup in my clinical practice and I think\nwhoa if this is a problem that one\nperson is dealing with I'm sure it's a\nproblem that many people are dealing\nwith and if this intervention or this\nsolution might be of use to this one\nperson it very well might be of use to\nmany other people so that's kind of the\nprinciple that I operate from this isn't\na channel where I talk about a lot of\nacademic research this isn't a channel\nwhere I talk a lot about Theory this is\nreally practical this is about getting\npeople out of pain this is about helping\npeople make money having better\nrelationships getting through the\nbecause life is very very hard and we\nneed practical actionable solutions to\nget out of the difficulties that we are\nsubject to finding ourselves in\nand uh\nI'd like to think that the channel helps\nmove\nfolks in that direction at least that's\ncertainly my intention I do not want to\nbe inflammatory I do not want to be\ndivisive\num I'm not doing this so that I could\nmake\na significant amount of money it's nice\nthat the money is coming in because I\ncan reinvest that in the channel in\ndifferent ways like getting help I'm not\nvery good at tech for instance\nand um\nyeah it's because I I have various\nsources of income already so it's this\nisn't about getting famous this isn't\nabout making a bunch of money it's about\ntrying to help people live Better Lives\num whether I succeed is up to you of\ncourse but that certainly is my\nintention\nuh now about moving forward I hope to\ncontinue to put out good content for you\non the regular\nI am in my slow\nand consistent way moving in the\ndirection of writing a book which many\nof you have asked about\num I'm excited about the prospect but\nit's going to take some time because I\nhave my clinical practice I work on the\nchannel I have another business\nso\nit kind of It kind of has to happen\nwhen nothing else is happening\nso I'm doing it here and there but it\nwill come out I'm moving in that\ndirection\num and I'm starting with more I'm\nbeginning to do more long-form\ninterviews on the channel inviting\npeople that I am really impressed by and\nI'm interested in to have longer\ndiscussions with and hopefully you'll\nsee more of those on this channel moving\nforward as well now a lot of you have\nasked me to appear on other people's\npodcasts that's great not really up to\nme entirely whether I appear it's\ngenerally requires an invitation\nso what I would ask of you is that if\nthere's somebody that you would like me\nto speak to\none of the best things that you can do\nto make that happen to help make that\nhappen is to reach out to the person you\nwant me to speak to\nespecially if you follow them and are\nfamiliar with their content\nand if that other person gets enough\nfeedback from his or her subscriber base\nthat they're interested in the\nconversation between the two of us it's\ngoing to make it much more likely that\nperson will extend an invitation to me\nme asking for an invitation it generally\ndoesn't work but if that invitation\narrives organically\nfrom the audience of these various other\nfolks it's much more likely to happen so\nthat is one easy way that some of you\ncould help to further the mission of the\nchannel and it helps you get what you\nwant if you want me to talk to certain\nindividuals cost you nothing just I\ndon't know a minute of your time so\nsomething to consider\num and again I'm super stoked about the\nfuture who knows how far this is going\nto go I'm going to keep writing it out\nfor a while and\nmaking a better and better experience\nfor everybody so again thank you very\nmuch for accompanying me this far and\nlet's keep going all right\nbye-bye"
