    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why most\nmarriages fail\nso we know that the divorce rate is\nextremely high in the Western World more\nthan half of marriages end in divorce\nwhich should be an absolutely terrifying\nstatistic for any single man in the west\nnow the reasons behind this exorbitant\ndivorce rate are widely debated and\nhotly contested and there's a good deal\nof validity to a lot of these points\nespecially those that consider the\nperverse incentives for women who\ninitiate the Lion's Share of divorces to\nend their marriages\nhowever I have a very simple explanation\nas to why most marriages fail that cuts\nto the heart of the issue here it is the\nreason why most marriages fail is\nbecause marriage is inherently a very\nhumble Institution\nand because of its fundamental humility\nit cannot support all the extra\nthat people are subject to piling on top\nof that Institution\nlike a bridge that collapses when it\ntakes on too much weight marriage is\njust not designed to support more than\nwhat it was built to do and at the end\nof the day when a marriage was built to\ndo is to provide a context for people to\ncome together and raise children\nthat's it\neverything on top of that everything\nthat people are subject to piling on top\nof marriage the love the romance the\nexclusivity the duty the religiosity the\nsacrifice the security the legal status\nthe social consequences the financial\nincentives is heavier than what the\ninstitution of marriage was designed to\nsupport\nand of these many things it is love in\nthe sense of romantic love that is\nheaviest to bear\nthe prevalence of the love marriage\nwhich is a conflation of two very\ndifferent things the love affair and the\ndomestic partnership is fundamentally to\nblame for the situation we find\nourselves in today\nmarriage wasn't designed to be both a\nstructure for raising children and a\ncontainer for passion and fulfillment\nthat like just doesn't make sense\nLamborghini does not make minivans\nand love is just one of many additional\nthings with which we are inappropriately\nsubject to burdening marriage\nwe see a similar Trend in contemporary\nattitudes towards work for instance the\nfunction of a job is to provide people\nwith an opportunity to earn money in\nexchange for a service\nthat's it everything on top of that is\nadditional weight that the institution\nof a job was not designed to support a\njob was not designed to be fulfilling it\nwas not meant to be a source of meaning\nit was not meant to provide you with an\nidentity and it certainly wasn't\ndesigned to be exciting or fun\nthe institution of a job was created to\nprovide people with the opportunity to\nearn money in exchange for a service\nanything on top of that is more than the\ninstitution was fundamentally designed\nto support\nit is not necessarily a problem when a\njob that pays well is not fulfilling\nthe problem is expecting fulfillment\nfrom a job that pays well do you\nunderstand\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the super\nthanks button it's those three little\ndots in the lower right hand corner and\ntip me in proportion to the value you\nfeel you've derived from this episode\nbecause it's your donations that make\nall this happen thank you for your\nsupport\nso work and marriage are humble\ninstitutions and for a very long time\nmarriage was basically understood to be\na kind of work that is it was two people\nwho joined together to accomplish a\nspecific purpose namely to raise\nchildren\nyou didn't have to love the person you\nwere doing this with hell you didn't\neven have to particularly like them much\nlike it is unnecessary for you to love\nor even like your co-workers in order to\ndo your job you don't get to choose your\nco-workers and for a long time people\ndidn't get to choose their spouses but\nyou kind of found a way to make it work\nbecause you know that's your job\nno one really expects to work at a\ncompany where their co-workers are their\nbest friends\nthat is both unrealistic and unnecessary\nhowever people have no problem believing\nthat their spouses should not only be\ntheir co-parents but also their best\nfriends\nand their passionate lovers\nand their coaches and their cheerleaders\nand their drinking buddies and their\ntherapists and their biggest fans and\ntheir social trophies\netc\netc\netc\nit should go without saying but no one\nperson can be all those things to anyone\nelse\nand this is why marriages fail\nwe want it to be more than it is and so\nwe expect our partners to be more than\nthey are\none of my favorite authors Kurt Vonnegut\nhad an interesting take on this this is\nfrom one of his later collections God\nbless you Dr Kevorkian and he writes\nokay now let's have some fun let's talk\nabout sex let's talk about women\nFreud said that he didn't know what\nwomen wanted I know what women want they\nwant a whole lot of people to talk to\nwhat do they want to talk about they\nwant to talk about everything\nwhat do men want they want a lot of Pals\nand they wish people weren't so mad at\nthem\nwhy are so many people getting divorced\ntoday it's because most of us don't have\nextended families anymore it used to be\nthat when a man and a woman got married\nthe bride got a lot more people to talk\nto about everything and the Grim got a\nlot more Pals to tell dumb jokes to\nbut most of us if we get married\nnowadays are just one more person for\nthe other person\nthe groom gets one more pal but it's a\nwoman\nthe woman gets one more person to talk\nto about everything but it's a man\nthe couple has an argument they may\nthink it's about money or power or sex\nor how to raise the kids or whatever\nwhat they're really saying to each other\nthough without realizing it is this\nyou are not enough people\nend quote that is absolutely correct the\nreason why most marriages fail is\nbecause you are not enough people\nyou are not supposed to be enough people\nyou are never designed to be enough\npeople and you cannot be enough people\nirrespective of who you are and who you\ndecide to partner with\nthe idea that one relationship should\nreplace and supersede so many other\nrelationships is a recipe for disaster\nin my opinion for marriage to be saved\nit needs to be returned to its essential\nstate which is one of Simplicity and\nhumility\nthis probably isn't going to win me a\nlot of fans but we don't even have to\nconflate marriage with religion\nindeed the idea that marriage isn't\nfundamentally a religious institution\nwill be difficult for many people to\nconsider\nbut that's the fact\nfor example did you know that marriage\ndidn't become a sacrament of the\nCatholic church until 1563\n1563. that's 16 centuries after the\nbirth of Christ\nhowever this isn't necessarily\nsurprising if you understand that\nmarriage is fundamentally an instrument\nof social control because it creates\nstability at the social level not to\nhave a bunch of orphaned directionless\nchildren running around\nand so marriage didn't really become\nimportant to the church until the church\nitself became an instrument of social\npower and control\nand on a personal note I don't put any\nstock in an organizational rule that\napplies to the followers but not to the\nleaders Jesus was not married and he\npreached that there were no husbands or\nwives in heaven that is it is an Earthly\ninstitution nor are the leaders of his\nchurches popes priests and the like\nthey're not married the Buddha was\nsingle judaism's greatest King Solomon\nhad 500 wives Islam's Muhammad had\nmultiple wives etc etc etc in fact I\ncan't think of a founder or head of any\nmajor religion who was monogamously\nmarried\nbut I'm sure that's just a coincidence\nso marriage got conflated with religion\na few hundred years ago then it got\nconflated with love a couple hundred\nyears ago then as Vonnegut observed it\nbecame isolated in the nuclear unit\nafter the dissolution of the extended\nfamily about 75 years ago and today\nwe're at the end of 50 years of upheaval\nand uncertainty about culture gender and\ntradition\nmarriage today is absolutely\nunrecognizable from Marriage several\nhundred years ago like it's wild that we\nstill use the same word for it and I'm\nafraid that until we collectively\nisolate and clarify the many conflated\nideas that have created this Chimera of\nan institution the situation will\ncontinue to deteriorate\nto save marriage we need a return to\nsimplicity\na pragmatic open-mindedness\nor both\nyou may disagree with me but that's my\ntake on it what do you think let me know\nin the comments below and if you've\ngotten this far you might as well like\nthis episode And subscribe to this\nchannel you may also consider becoming
