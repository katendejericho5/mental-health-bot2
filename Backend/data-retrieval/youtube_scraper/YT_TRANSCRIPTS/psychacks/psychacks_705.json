    "transcript": "the limitations of science so I'm going\nto be approaching this theme through the\nlens of this channel as you may have\nnoticed I don't often talk about\npsychological research I've done a few\nepisodes in which I've discussed some\ninteresting articles and I've linked\nthose episodes to the articles in\nquestion but I definitely don't back up\neverything that I say with a citation\nfrom the literature and I'd like to\ndiscuss why that is in today's episode\nthe main reason why I don't corroborate\nall of my claims with empirical\nliterature is because having conducted a\nfair share of psychological research in\nmy time I know how easy it is to lie\nunder the guise of objectivity as Mark\nTwain once said there are three types of\nLies there are lies damned lies and\nstatistics the fact of the matter is is\nthat the vast majority of people do not\nunderstand how to interpret statistics\nthey do not understand how statistical\nmodels function and they do not\nunderstand how to evaluate research\ndesign and without these three\nunderstandings the average person is an\nabsolutely no position to evaluate the\nstrength of a given study"
