    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the\nlimitations of science\nso I'm going to be approaching this\ntheme through the lens of this channel\nas you may have noticed I don't often\ntalk about psychological research I've\ndone a few episodes in which I've\ndiscussed some interesting articles and\nI've linked those episodes to the\narticles in question but I definitely\ndon't back up everything that I say with\na citation from the literature and I'd\nlike to discuss why that is in today's\nepisode\nthe main reason why I don't corroborate\nall of my claims with empirical\nliterature is because having conducted a\nfair share of psychological research in\nmy time I know how easy it is to lie\nunder the guise of objectivity\nas Mark Twain once said there are three\ntypes of Lies there are lies damned lies\nand statistics\nthe fact of the matter is is that the\nvast majority of people do not\nunderstand how to interpret statistics\nthey do not understand how statistical\nmodels function and they do not\nunderstand how to evaluate research\ndesign\nand without these three understandings\nthe average person is an absolutely no\nposition to evaluate the strength of a\ngiven study and that is because such a\nperson cannot evaluate the biases in the\nmodel the limitations of the analysis\nand the assumptions inherent in the\ndesign\nthe average person stands in relation to\nscience much the same way a medieval\npeasant stood in relation to the\nCatholic church he couldn't understand\nthe Latin but it was also impressive\nsounding that it certainly must be true\nif I wanted to I could find a research\nstudy that corroborates the claims I\nmake in any given episode\nand if I wanted to I could find a\nresearch study that corroborates the\nopposite of anything that I claim in a\ngiven episode\nthis is because Dirty Little Secret if\nyou understand how to conduct research\nyou can more or less make the evidence\ncome out the way that you want it to\nif you understand how to finagle\nstatistical models and you know how to\nmanipulate research protocols you can\nCustom Tailor the finding to your study\nand this will bamboozle most of the\npeople who aren't about to carefully\nevaluate the study and make up their own\nminds\nthe complaint used to be that people\njust read the abstracts of articles\nnow they just read the headlines based\non the titles of the articles\ncontemporary research is also\nsignificantly influenced by both funding\ninterests and the publication process\nfor instance a non-significant finding\nwhich might be meaningful and important\nfrom the perspective of Truth or the\nprogression of pure science is almost\ncertainly not going to be published in a\nrespectable Journal where there is a\nstrong bias for significant findings to\nthat end researchers are heavily\nincentivized to create studies and to\nutilize methods that facilitate the\nidentification of statistically\nsignificant differences\nkeep in mind that a statistically\nsignificant difference might not be a\nmeaningful difference to anyone with a\nhead on their shoulders which is also\nwhy studies tend to focus on either the\nirrelevant or the obvious especially in\nthe social sciences\nmost people have no direct experience\nwith the dumpster fire that is the\nenvironment within which scientific\nresearch is formulated conducted and\ndisseminated\nwhen serving on the faculty of\npsychology departments I found that even\ngrad students tend to gloss over the\nmethods and results sections of most the\narticles that they read\nthis is because until you've read\nhundreds and hundreds of these articles\nthe methods and results sections of Any\nGiven paper basically read like well\nmedieval Latin\nthese parts of an article are\nfunctionally written in another language\nand it takes time and suffering to\nachieve any degree of appreciable\nfluency but if you don't read the\nlanguage what happens you can't tell\nwhether the interpretation is grounded\nappropriately in the results you can't\ntell if the abstract is an accurate\nsummary of the interpretation and you\ncan't tell if the title is a fair\nreflection of the abstract sure almost\nevery sentence in the article has a\ncorresponding citation but did you read\nall of those articles to determine\nwhether they had any Merit most of the\nmost of this is taken on faith\nfaith in a scholarship and objectivity\nthat I'm afraid may not be warranted\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing then please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow and if you're liking what\nyou're hearing then please consider\nhitting the super thanks button it's\nthose three little dots in the lower\nright hand corner beneath the screen and\ntip me in proportion to the value you\nfeel you've received from this episode\nit's those donations that make all of\nthis possible so I really appreciate\nyour support\nin any case well I typically do not\ncorroborate all the claims that I make\nin an episode with a study I do believe\nthat the vast majority of my claims are\nat least falsifiable that is that a\nstudy at least in theory could be\nconducted to substantiate my claims\nthat said well I'm not going to lie to\nyou I'm much less interested in what is\nfactually accurate than what is\nmeaningfully true\nappreciation of this difference leads to\ntwo very different conceptualizations of\nscience\non the one hand you have the cult of\nscientism\nwhich with which we are all duly\nfamiliar at this point this belief\nsystem is usually practiced by people\nwho have enough knowledge to know that\nthey know some things but not enough\nknowledge to know that they know very\nlittle\nthis particular combination can make\nthem very proud\nnotwithstanding they routinely mistake\ndescriptions for explanations believe\nrandomized controlled trials are the\ngold standard of Truth and indirectly\nsuccumb to arguments of authority all\nthe time\nhowever that's just one\nconceptualization of science\non the other hand you have the let's say\nmore humble and eminently more useful\nconceptualization of science as know-how\nthe ability to do the thing\nI've personally met illiterate and\nunschooled people who possess a\nknowledge of reality that greatly\noutstrips scientistic understanding\nand this science clearly shines forth in\ntheir ability to among other things live\nin prosperous harmony with themselves\nand others and to attend to the\nnecessities of man which if you think\nabout it are the only legitimate goals\nof science to begin with\nif you can explain it but you can't do\nit then you have a scientistic\nunderstanding if you can do it but you\ncan't explain it then you have a\nknow-how understanding\nboth are forms of science but know-how\nis higher\nit's the difference between\nextrapolating the laws of aerodynamics\nand building an airplane that flies\nideally we use the former to do the\nlatter but that is not strictly\nnecessary\nagain I don't often speak from the\nperspective of the empirical literature\nbecause a I'd rather not just summarize\nsomeone else's ideas I have some of my\nown thank you very much and B because\nthe empirical literature is what we call\na show\nand if you don't understand how that is\ntrue then frankly you're not in a\nposition to evaluate what you believe\nfrom the perspective of science\nand I doubt anyone who actually\nunderstands the literature will take\nissue with anything I've said here today\nso while I don't often speak here on the\nbasis of empirical evidence I do often\nspeak on the grounds of my know-how\nthat is my expertise\nthis is expertise that comes from as it\nwere building thousands and thousands of\nairplanes\nI've seen how people act up close and in\nconfidence and I know what people\ngenerally have to do to achieve their\ndesired outcomes and there is nothing\nthat I have ever advised a client to do\nprofessionally nor anything that I have\never abdicated on this channel publicly\nthat I have not first tried myself and\nfound it to be useful in achieving a\ndesired outcome\nthis is because it is very rare for\nsomeone to present me with a problem\nthat I haven't to some degree\nencountered in my own life\nin any case if the plane flies maybe I\ndo have a science to what I'm talking\nabout but hey don't take my word for it\ntry it out for yourself and see whether\nit works and remember if you already\nknew\nyou would probably already have the\noutcome that you wanted\nso if your life doesn't yet quite look\nlike the way you want it to it's good to\nkeep an open mind you'll find the\nanswers where you haven't already looked\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso
