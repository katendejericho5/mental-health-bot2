    "transcript": "okay hello everybody Welcome to psych\nhacks I'm Dr Orion taraban and today I'm\nvery happy to be speaking with Mr Rob\nanger uh Rob is a he has a number of\nYouTube channels that I followed over\nthe years I think first and foremost is\ncollative learning in which Rob gives\nsome really deep and insightful analyzes\non some of my favorite films and uh I've\nbeen a fan of his channel personally for\nmany many years so I'm very very stoked\nto be talking with you today Rob thanks\nfor joining us on the podcast\nit's great to be here and I asked to say\nOrion taraba I loved that name and\nthat's like that's something I have a\nsome crazy science picture movie I\nthought was like a yeah fantastic yeah\nit's an intense name I didn't choose it\nof course but it's it's something I've\ntried to grow into which type when I was\nyounger but it's uh it's nice to have\nwhen you're older\nso uh Rob I remember I that you posted\nan episode a while back that was\nsomething along the lines of like why is\nit so difficult for people to\nappreciate that there might be deeper\nlevels of meaning in film\nlike I I I'm assuming that's coming from\na perspective of you sharing some of\nyour interpretations with maybe friends\nor folks on the internet and then saying\nah you're you're just reading too deep\ninto this it's just a movie uh so I\nthink we're talking about semiotics here\nthe the reading of symbols why do you\nthink why do you think this is so\ndifficult for folks and and how can\npeople learn how to read film as a like\na medium\nwell uh it's a strange one because when\nI first started posting the videos I\ndidn't think anyone would be interested\nin the stuff but\num turns out there are some people who\nare really into this stuff you know I\nwas quite surprised I thought it would\nonly be other filmmakers but there's a\nlot of regular everyday people who are\nwho are interested in this stuff and if\nyou start telling them about it\num and showing them the little bits and\npieces from the movies or you're\npointing out things from movies that\nthey're already familiar with\num then they're like oh my God yeah and\nthey can even remember from the scenes\nthe details that you're talking about\nand and they love it you know some\npeople do but yeah a lot of people just\nreally back off from this stuff and like\nwhoa whoa whoa whoa I just want to go\nwith the surface plot of the movie I\njust want to believe what I'm told by\nthe characters\num there's a simple straightforward\nnarrative that you've followed it's got\na middle beginning and an end and at the\nend you're told what the full story is\nand that's it and then the movie's over\nand then you just go away and that's\nthat's that\num but yeah this this idea that the of\nmovies which that have a lot of hidden\nstuff that isn't obvious a lot of people\nare really uncomfortable with it and it\nshows in that the choice of movies that\nthey watch as well\num you know the type of people who don't\nwant to go anywhere near the movies of\nlike David Lynch or something like that\nbecause you don't get a very obvious\nexplanation at the end of the movie and\nthey hate walking away confused they\nthey feel uncomfortable with that\nconfusion\nand um\nI mean there's a there's a few different\nthings that I think this is down to uh\none I think is\nwe humans have got into this sort of\nbearable reality that we've created for\nourselves which is incredibly useful uh\nyou know we go around and we take this\nincredibly complex world that's around\nus and we apply all these verbal labels\nto these complex things just so we can\nhave a simplistic organizing approach to\nreality oh there's a car you know but a\ncar is actually an unbelievably complex\nthing if you actually go and study it in\ndetail\num so I think that's an issue is people\ndon't like Delvin out of the comfort\nzone of simplistic verbal uh reality\nand once you get outside of that it's\nlike oh my God the world is too complex\nand I'm getting a headache and I'm not\nsure if I can handle this but I think\nthere's that reaction a lot of the time\nand another one is that\nI think a lot of people are\nuncomfortable with\nthe idea that they've been deceived that\nsomebody has come along and made a movie\nand\nthey fooled the the person who was\nwatching it into thinking it was about\none thing and it turned out there was a\nlot of other stuff going on there and I\nthink sometimes it makes people feel\nlike\num uncomfortable it's like I mean people\nhave a problem with deception generally\nanyway uh a lot of people like to just\nfollow the newspaper headlines and stuff\nto get their reality about how the world\nworks and of course the real world is\nway more complex than the newspaper\nheadlines\num so that's a big factor as well and I\nthink when people watch movies a lot of\nthe time they just want to be\nentertained they want to get away from\nthe world of deception and\num I mean there's a thing about movies\nas well where\num you have the you know good guys and\nbad guys in movies\nand people loved the Simplicity of good\nguys versus bad guys and movies but in\nreality you can't always tell who's a\ngood guy and who's a bad guy so you know\nthat that makes things nice and\ncomfortable in movies you don't have to\ndeal with deception so much the bad guys\nmake it obvious that they're a bad guy\nso yeah the the complexity and dealing\nwith the deception that's gone on when a\nmovie has deeper themes I think those\ntwo things people have a major problem\nwith so among other things what I'm\nhearing is that it's like an emotional\ndiscomfort over overwhelming or\nincomprehensible complexity that tends\nto turn people off and maybe there's a\nsort of literacy that comes with being\nable to read symbolism in film or in\nliterature or in other works of art that\npeople don't practice and therefore\ndon't have but maybe some people have\nthe potential to move in that direction\nbut they might feel emotionally\nuncomfortable about doing so because it\nmight shatter some of their let's say\ncomfortable World Views I really like\nwhat you said about the Simplicity of\ngood versus evil because I think that\nsome of the best works of art whether\nit's film or literature is not really\nabout good versus bad but about two\ntwo sorry like you you cut out a little\nbit there can you just go back a little\nbit you cut out for about five seconds\nso oh sorry I I heard everything on on\nmy end so what I was saying is that I\nreally like what you said about the good\nversus evil being too simplistic because\nin my opinion all the Best Literature\nwere film is not really about good\nversus evil it's about two mutually\nincompatible World Views that each have\ntheir merits but they can't both be held\nat the same time I'm actually working on\nan analysis of Les Mis the book and and\nthe musical because there's this\nfundamental antagonism between Javier\nand Valjean that I think is actually\nmirrored in kind of like the old versus\nthe New Testament you got you got Jaber\nwho's like an eye for an eye there has\nto be order when there are bad guys and\ngood guys and that's totally\nincompatible with the let's say the new\ntestament worldview which is that people\ncan change people can be redeemed and\num once a bad guy not always a bad guy\nbecause if we open up the possibility to\nthat it really throws all of the order\nof the uh the Old Testament Covenant\ninto chaos and that's exactly what\nhappens to Javier at the end of the film\nso uh and and it's not that Javier is a\nbad guy he definitely has a point we\nneed Justice we need order\num we need Sentinels in the night to\nlook out for folks so it's not that he's\nhe's bad he's just you can't have both\nof those World Views at the same time\nand so it's a contest to see who's kind\nof going to come out in the end ahead\nnow with the deception this is something\nthat you I remember you talked a lot\nabout in your analysis of 2001 which I\nthink is just absolutely brilliant where\nyou talk about how on the surface this\nfilm seems to be like uh a movie about\nfirst Contact it's about\num you know the star baby elevating into\nthe next dimension of human\nconsciousness\nbut I think I'm getting it right your\nargument is that\nKubrick was actually trying to make a\ncommentary on\nlike Cinema itself is that fair to say\nyeah partially yeah yeah I'll show you\nabout the medium itself and how the\nmedium can be deceptive you know and uh\nI'm not not to go over it too much uh\nbecause I've covered this stuff a lot\nbefore but the whole idea about touching\nthe monolith and the monolith being the\ncinema screen in Disguise but it's been\nrotated at 90 degrees\num when you touch the monolith and\nyou're touching the movie screen itself\nit's like if you're sat at home or you\nsat in a cinema and you're watching this\nmovie and you think oh this is so real\nbut if you go up and touch the screen\nit's like it's not even unreal you know\nI can touch the screen right now and you\nare not really in front of me and you\nknow that we've got this communication\ngoing on digitally but\num I think that's part of the concept of\n2001 is that don't believe in what you\nsee on your screens and just go and\ntouch the screen and realize that it's\njust a magical display that's going on\nit's not reality you know I think that's\npart of the whole 2001 thing yeah yeah\nand the way that you worked in all of\nthose rotationals\num gestures you you notice the\nrotational gestures in the movie to turn\nthe monolith from vertical to horizontal\nto mimic the panoramic service would\nhave picked up on that I thought that\nwas very observant Rob now I do believe\nthat you mentioned that partly the\nreason why that level of meaning might\nhave been buried into the service in\n2001 was that Kubrick couldn't really\nget that film produced like no one was\ngoing to pay\nto bankroll a film about\nthe the illusion of Cinema they wanted\nthis was in the era of I guess it was\nbefore Star Wars but we're getting into\nthe space race and this was very popular\nand and so he kind of had to do it for\npragmatic reasons so the question I have\nfor you I'm going to play a little bit\nof a devil's advocate here is\nif\nif what you're saying is true about\nthese hidden levels of meaning and if\nthe filmmakers really wanted people to\nunderstand these levels of meaning why\ndid they go through the trouble of\nhiding them like why don't they just\ntell the people what they really want\nthem to know\nokay uh does something that I think is\ngoing on particularly with Kubrick and\nLynch and people like that where they're\nchallenging the audience it's like the\nsaying I'm not going to hand it to you\non a plate I'm going to give you lots of\nClues and you're going to do the rest of\nthe work and figure it out you know it's\nlike uh there was actually a in the\nnovelization of 2001 which Kubrick wrote\nwith Clark and Kubrick had authorization\nwrites on that novel he was able to\noverride Clarke\num\nin the novelization there are many many\nmodels all over the Earth it's not just\nthe one that arrives so there's tons of\nthem with different ape groups\nand the apes are being tested that\nexplains that it's it's not just about\ntraining the Apes it's about testing\nthem and so the monoliths are looking\nfor the Apes with the most potential\nand\nso it tests them with a number of\nperceptual tricks and I think at one\npoint they have to throw stones at the\nthe monolith and there's like a Target\non it and they have to throw stones and\nhit it and stuff like that so it's\nlooking for Apes with potential to\nreally develop and it doesn't bother\nwith the rest\nand you know this it's quite you could\nsay it's kind of like snobbish and\nelitist\num but I think Kubrick was basically\njust\nhe wasn't trying to make a movie that\neverybody would be able to get I think\nhe knew that a lot of people that would\nhave just been like too much of a\nheadache for them or they couldn't be\nbothered they're not motivated well I\nthink he realized that there would be\nsome people around\nwho would be really interested in\ndeveloping their understanding feather\nof the movie and because the movie\ndoesn't give verbal explanations those\npeople would have to explore the visual\nyou know the non-verbal the metaphoric\nthe symbolic uh they would have to delve\ninto that and gradually start to decode\nwhat he put in yeah and so that you know\nthe the novelization is very specific\nabout that about\num\nI think that there was a point where it\nactually said that the monolith was\nthere\nto find out whether the Apes were worth\nhelping oh my god\num I think Kubrick may have said that in\nan interview as well at one point\num I can't recall if it was just in the\nnovelization but you have that when I\ncame across the I was like my God is\nthis\nis this like the attitude Kubrick was\ntaken with with this film was like um\nI'm gonna hit you with this really tough\npuzzle that is right outside your\ncomfort zone right outside of your\nfamiliar verbal thinking and it's\ndefinitely outside of the thinking of\nthe investors so they're not going to\nget it\num but if there's some of you out there\nwho are going to be open to this stuff\nwho are really willing to step outside\nof the usual mental boundaries and here\nyou go I've got some employer I've got\nlike a cinematic Rubik's Cube which if\nyou can break it down and figure it out\neither individually or collectively\nfigure it out then you can have the the\ngoodies that are hiding underneath yeah\nthe hidden narrative I like that\nwell let's let's kind of pivot a little\nbit and talk about\num I I think this is an interesting\nconnection so like why why do symbols\neven work at all and I think there has\nto be some sort of psychological\nresponse to that question that the the\nreason why symbols might be so rich\nespecially as a communicative medium is\nthat like a rose is not just a rose a\nrose can also be Beauty it's also about\nsexuality it's the color of the Rose\ncould be passion or it could be\nfriendship\num that these are all associations that\nwe have with the symbol either the word\nor the image of the rose that we can\nkind of play with without even\nuh\nmaking it seem like we're activating\nthose associations so they they seem to\nbe in play in our Consciousness even\nthough we may not be actually perceiving\nthem on the screen\ndo you think that that's part of what\nwe're talking about here definitely yeah\nI mean this I mean it's it's it is kind\nof you've hit on the night I don't need\nthat there's a lot of people who resist\nthis kind of symbolism in movies because\nthey're not used to this kind of\nsymbolism but symbolism is dead in their\nlife every day and they use it when they\nspeak they don't realize they're talking\nthat way\num you know if if if they if they meet\nsomeone who is very uh say intelligent\nthey'll refer to that person as bright\nhow are they bright it's not like\nthey're actually emanating light but\nthey use that term and that is such an\ninbuilt\num metaphor that we all use it as if\nit's a real thing you know\num so it seems like people are really\nokay with using symbolism that they're\nfamiliar with and they know that\neverybody else is familiar with but when\nyou start getting into new types of\nsymbolism or more complex symbolism then\nit's like oh they start to back off yeah\nsure because I think at basis all\nlanguage that we use human language is\nmetaphorical in its Essence because\notherwise we would just be talking in\ntautologies like if I were to say a rose\nis a rose like that's x equals X as a\nmathematical proposition which is true\nbut totally not useful and not\ninteresting information so the way that\nwe communicate is we actually say it\nlooks x equals a times b or something\nlike that so we we can kind of transmute\nthis one variable into a combination of\nother variables and still maintains some\nsort of equality between them and that's\nhow we can kind of expand our conceptual\nunderstanding of the universe it's\nthrough metaphor which is basically a\ngraded comparison between two things\nright yeah yeah I mean I I I've been\ngetting it quite into the idea of um\nI've been learning a bit more about\nabout mathematics recently I've been\nstudying uh I wrote a huge video which\nI'm still editing which is about uh\ncubic reality and it covers 2001 Space\nOdyssey the movie Tron and uh the video\ngame Minecraft you know with this cubic\nblocky world okay and um cubism in\nPicasso's artwork it goes through a\nwhole bunch of historical cubism things\nthat have happened in the past 120 years\nand uh I was I was very interested\nbecause I think there's something in\nthis there's patterns going on here what\nis what is it with this cubic reality\nthing that people are drawn to and so I\nstarted like\num researching a bit more about\nmathematics and mathematical theories\nand\nI sort of started I've already suspected\nthis for a while but sort of came to the\nconclusion that mathematics itself isn't\nthe real thing it's actually symbolic\nyou know numbers are just symbols\num if you go through history there's\nbeen different numerical systems of\nexisted yeah the the Roman numeral\nsystem most of us are familiar with that\nwe get taught her in school and we've\ngot our own system and there's there's\nall these different ones with it's not\njust the ten point thing but I think the\nmain theory is that we we have a 10\npoint\num you know 10 numbers because of the\nthe number of numbers of fingers and\nthumbs on our hands so it makes it\neasier for us to count intense so that\num 10-digit system which is used\neverywhere in the world today\num it's almost like taking over to the\npoint where we think it is real but it's\njust one other form of it's just another\nset of symbols that's fascinating so\nyou're basically saying it's an\nanthropomorphized uh view of reality\nthat's been like reified as something\nthat's objective to nature which isn't\ntrue because even though I think every\nculture in the world now uses the base\n10 system of mathematics that hasn't\nalways been true in fact now computers\nare not running base 10 they're running\nbinary\num and exactly and base eight\num but I think the Mayans used a base 12\ncalculation which I think would be very\ndifficult for me and most modern people\nto take off the retrain our perceptions\nbut it's not anymore or less real than\nthe one we've already got yeah I used to\nbe a math professor and I used to tell\npeople that math is not about numbers\nit's about quantity which is a different\nthing and quantity is really about\nrelationships like the the number\n0.75 is about the relationship between\nthree to four and three and four not\nreally numbers because they are\nquantities in of themselves that can be\nreduced into different kinds of\nrelationships like there is no value in\nand of itself all values exist in\nproportion to other values so what we're\ntalking about an absolute\nthat's kind of a misnomer we're actually\njust comparing it to some other things\neverything is about relationships\num so let's talk about this so if\nthe symbolism of film is related to\nlet's say the psychological associations\nthat people have in their minds about\ncertain images\nwould it be fair to say we could take a\nfilm like Mulholland Drive which I just\nrewatched yesterday and show that to\nlike\nthe folks in\nPapua New Guinea and they're going to be\nable to pick up on the symbolism or is\nthere stuff in Lynch's films that you\nkind of need to be trained by maybe\nother lynches films or by Western Cinema\nin general to be able to perceive like\nare these symbols contextual or are some\nof these symbols Universal\ndefinitely a mix of the two\num\nI mean it's you know with with Lynch I\nmean a key thing is just figuring out\nwhich scenes and dream sequences and\nwhich aren't you know you as far as I\ntell with without doing that you cannot\nfigure out the proper narratives of this\nfilms like Mulholland Drive it's\nactually got a very\num\nuh it's got a narrative that makes\nperfect logical sense and a standard\nplot way it's just that it's presented\nthrough a mixture of dream sequences\nwhich I think is about\nsomething like the first two thirds of\nthe movie I think is all dream sequences\nand then you start getting presented\ntowards the end of the movie with the\nwaking State experiences and you have to\nrelate those to the dream experience\nscenes in order to figure out what\nreally happened so you know you get one\ncharacter who shows up but they\nrepresent a different character uh you\nknow in real life they were a different\ncharacter but in the dream they are\nsomebody else\num I mean that that stuff kind of goes\nI would say that's\nit's difficult to work out but I think\nthat can be figured out by people from\nany culture because in all cultures\npeople dream\num and I I would well I don't know if\nthere's been any research done on this\nbut I would assume that the similar\nkinds of bass symbolism goes on in\ndreams across all cultures I should\nimagine it\nsomebody from some Far Away culture that\nis really exotic and different to mine\nand if some of the air has a dream I'm\npretty sure they're in their dreams\nevery now and then somebody will pop up\nin the dream who who visually looks\ndifferent but they represent somebody\nwho exists in that person's real\nawakened state that you know the person\nhas been\num represented differently in the dream\nI I would assume that that happens\nacross cultures\num in all dream states so on that basis\nI would say people from any culture\nshould be able to look at a movie like\nMulholland Drive and start figuring it\nout I suppose you've got the language\nbar you might make it awkward as worker\nyeah I don't think it's research but I\nthink Paulo coelio said that Shepherds\ntend to dream of sheep which kind of\nmakes sense but what we're getting at I\nthink is uh the possibility that there\nmay be Universal\num symbolism that all human beings are\ncapable of perceiving and understanding\nand in Psychology the guy who most\npeople are aware of did the most work on\nthat is Young And The Arc Type yeah and\nI think one way that we can think about\narchetypes is that they're Universal\nsymbols that they exist in the\ncollective Consciousness and may even\nhave like a biological origin yeah and\nthese are ways of perceiving that all\nhuman beings are capable of\num other all human beings are capable of\nregardless of their culture or their\nlanguage so these are symbols like\num\nlike death\nor like\num the wise old man or\num the empress things like that you know\nthe kind of stuff that shows up on tarot\ncards actually yeah so it I think that\nthere is a strong argument for the\npossibility of archetypal symbology in\nall human beings just like there seems\nto be some Universal human emotions that\nare always kind of as far as we know\nexperience but certainly expressed in\nthe same way regardless of people's\nculture or socialization\num what have you what have you done with\nrespect to junking archetypes in your\nwork Rob\nwell funnily enough I just finished\nediting uh yesterday morning or the day\nbefore\num a new video that I haven't put out\nyet which is on um Carl Jung's uh quite\nshort book called the Undiscovered self\num I read that for the first time\nrecently and it's only 79 pages so so\ntons of notes and recorded that\num\nI've been aware of Carl Jung's stuff for\na long time I've read about his theories\nbut never read his books until recently\nI think I've read some of his papers\nbefore\num and I I think it's fantastic he's\nabsolutely brilliant he was so ahead uh\nof the Kev and like the stuff that he\nwas writing away back in the 1950s is\nabsolutely relevant today\num yeah so I mean was there some\nspecific aspect of young that you wanted\nto discuss there well you've made a\ncouple of videos on the Shadow and I\nthink the shadow is really interesting\nbecause there are a few different ways\nthat we can approach the idea of the\nShadow both in jungian Psychology and in\nother forms of psychology\num I think there are two general\num ways to approach it that I'm aware of\nand you can correct me if you\nif you want to change the definition or\nif you have another idea one is that the\nshadow is sort of a disavowed self it's\nthe part of myself that I don't allow\nmyself to acknowledge and so I deny and\nrepress and and see it in other people\nand want to destroy the projected evil\nthat I perceive in others because I'm\nwilling to accept it in myself I think\nthat is the more let's say jungian\napproach to it there's another\num idea about the shadow that basically\nsays the shadow is kind of inescapable\neven if you were to do all of this deep\npersonal\nyou know psychological work to kind of\nlike understand your demons as we say to\nintegrate Your Shadow you still have a\nshadow you can't get away from it\nbecause your shadow in this\nconceptualization is just the sum of all\nof your unchosen lines\nthat it's not necessarily a bad thing\nit's just the path that you didn't take\nand on some level The Shadow\nbecomes even more dangerous to the\nindividual when the unchosen path\nrepresents let's say greater happiness\nand prosperity than the one that you\ndecided to take does that make sense\nyeah yeah\num okay so let's try to think that so so\nyou're talking about the like the\nrejected part of ourselves absolutely\nthat's so big I totally agree with that\nand we projected on to others and then\nwe we hate the older people who we\nprojected onto absolutely and uh you\nknow I mean young talked about that in\nterms of well before world affairs Wars\nand stuff you know it's like he said\nvirtually all laws it's just two sides\neach project in their own shadow onto\nthe other side and then attacking it you\nknow so\num he talked about the the mutual\nwithdrawing of projections as a way of\nstopping War not an easy thing to\npersuade all the leaders to do is it\num and then the other one you mentioned\ncan you just clarify that for me a\nlittle bit again yeah rather than be\nlike so in the first definition the\nthings that I'm disavowing of myself are\nlike my own capacity for cruelty my own\ndarkness my own hatred my own envy and\nselfishness\nI I prefer you know like I'd prefer to\nthink of myself as all good as righteous\nas honest as forthright\nbut like those those darknesses live\ninside of me you know and I if if I\ndon't get through them they're always\nthere they're built in um\ninto uh it's in our nature the way we we\ngrew up in the you know the way we\nevolved we had to fight we had to be we\nhad to fear you know all that kind of\nstuff yeah it's uh you can't get really\nyou can become aware of the Shadow and\nlessen its effect on you so that you\ndon't project so much but you can't get\nrid of it that's my understanding of it\nyeah and I think that the more that I do\nthat shadow work myself and accept those\nparts of myself I become more\ncompassionate and patient with other\npeople because it's like yeah and when I\nsee this and other people I'm like well\nyou know have I really done have I done\nsomething that bad myself in the past\nmaybe I have could and if I haven't\ncould I yeah I probably could so\num you know I don't want to give bad\nbehavior a pass but it is important to\nthe we can respond to that behavior\nwithout necessarily needing to hate it\nor destroy it absolutely so yeah so\nthat's that's one part the other part is\nthat um like\nthink think about this maybe there's an\narchetypal story I can't think of one on\ntop of my head but there's like two twin\nbrothers and one person takes the path\nof I'm becoming a scholar and I'm\nworking hard and I'm getting married and\nbecoming a productive member of society\nthe other person takes the path of I\nwant uh a life of adventure and\nexploration and\num danger and like this intensity of\nLife neither one is necessarily bad or\nwrong but one is kind of the shadow of\nthe other because they couldn't take\nyou'd either take one path or the other\nand on some level that twin becomes the\nshadow of the other person because\num they represent all of their the way\ntheir life could have been but they\ndidn't choose does that make sense so\nall of the uh motivations the desires\nthat would have opened the the would\nhave been the basis of that alternate\nlife if it had happened you go down a\ndifferent path but\nokay I guess you could say the edge for\nthe the path that you didn't go down\nthat edge is still there you could refer\nto that as like the shadow sure because\nwhenever we make a choice we actually\nhave to forbear every other decision out\nthere and so every decision requires\nthis sacrifice and that means like\nactually giving up a huge part of our\nlives and a huge part of our our\npotentiality it's like my best friend in\nin high school he right out of college\nwent to law school and he got a\ncorporate job and he bought a house and\ngot married and I was an actor and I was\nliving this kind of life and he would\nlook at me sometimes and think oh Ryan\nyou're so free you get to do kind of\nwhatever you want and I was like yeah\nbut I'm broke and you got a nice house\nand a fancy car so it's like we just\nrepresented the path that the other\ndidn't take okay yeah yeah that's a lot\nof paths there it is right yeah\nyeah but so I think in that case the\nshadow is more around like Choice points\nit's like if I could\num you know what would my life have been\nlike if I didn't marry this person or if\nI didn't become a doctor but it's\nusually around really or even that this\ntragedy didn't befall me you know what\nI'm saying that's a big one yeah\nso it's not necessarily about the the\nnegative that's just another way of\nlooking at it but we can talk about\neither one of those definitions of the\nShadow or something else I think I got\nwhat you mean yeah I mean it's um\nthe the term Shadow because Shadows are\nliterally dark implies that it's a\nnegative uh\nnature to the to the shadow but yeah I\ndefinitely agreed as\neither whether you would call it the\nsame Shadow or whether we've got\nmultiple Shadows that come with us and\nsome are more positive some are more\nnegative yeah but definitely I agree\nthat there's\num\nan unconscious side of us that follows\nus that's full of positive things\ndefinitely yeah I definitely agree\nthat's the case I mean whether you want\nto look that in with the negative side\nand call it as one or whether you can\nseparate it out into different pieces\nfor them but we're getting into\nmathematical uh\nrelationship comparisons there so I\ndon't think the words really can do it\njustice can they you know they often\ncan't so I was bringing this up in the\ncontext of your analysis of a full metal\njacket do you want to talk about that or\ndo you want me to try yeah great yeah\nyeah so what do you what do you see is\nthe role of the shadow in that film\nuh the main thing that I see is the the\nsplit between the two halves of the\nmovie the first half and the second half\nand a lot of people don't like the\nsecond half of the movie this is quite\ninteresting because I mean young talked\nabout\nthat a lot of people don't like\naccessing their own unconscious they\ndon't want to be aware of their own\nshadow it's uncomfortable isn't it you\nknow\nso um so naturally they don't like the\nsecond half of Full Metal jackets so\nmuch because it gets into the the the\njungian shadow thing uh and you know\nKubrick did talk about Carl Jung in\nrelation to Full Metal jackets and\ninterviews he specifically said that he\nand the co-writer Michael Hare who wrote\nthe book uh is called dispatchers which\nFull Metal Jacket takes many of its\nscenes from\num Kubrick said that he and Michael hair\nwere specifically talking about ways of\ngetting Young's The Shadow into full\nmetal jackets so I mean you know never\nmind all the secrecy that with 2001\nSpace Odyssey that Kubrick was pretty\nopen about putting uh jungi and Shadow\nConcepts into full metal jacket it's not\nso obvious when you watch the movie\nbecause nobody tells you except for that\none moment when um The Joker character\nis talking to I think is a kennel or a\num some high ranking officer and the\nofficer the officer demands to know from\nwhy have you got a peace symbol on you\njacket and you've got born to kill\nwritten on your helmet and Joker says I\nwas trying to make a comment about The\nDuality of Man the jungian thing you\nknow that that's quite a blatant\ngiveaway for Kubrick I mean he's not\nnormally that blatant but you know he\nslipped it in there\num so yeah but for me the overall split\nthat happens in that movie is between\nthe first and second half and the way I\nview it is that the recruits in the\nfirst half of the movie\nthey are shadowed in the second half of\nthe movie\nthose recruits in the first half are\nreborn as the Lost hog Squad in the\nsecond half of the movie uh I did a\nvideo up there in fact it's still up uh\nabout Full Metal Jacket called um\nit was about the private pile character\num Born Again hard I think I called the\nthe video just so sorry I haven't\nwatched that one a few days ago I\nthought that was really insightful yeah\nso so you know the basic point where\nprivate pile his death is symbolic in\nthe toilets in the first half of the\nmovie and that's like killing off the\nthe innocent child he's like a baby like\ninnocent character and in the military\ntraining they want to kill that off they\nwant to get rid of your innocence and\nyour your childishness and just turn you\ninto a man I mean they literally call\nyou we're going to turn you into a man\nthat that standard jargon in you know\nmilitary training so they want to get\nrid of the infants so he gets killed off\nuh symbolically in the first half and\nthen he comes back in the second half uh\nhis shadow is the character called\nanimal mother and if you watch the two\ncharacters they have similar facial\nexpressions similar height and build\none's fat and the other ones suddenly\nbecome lean and um yeah so this that\nthat's your Shadow at work right there\nand what neither of them is aware of the\nother animal more that never ever makes\nany reference to uh the first half of\nthe movie in fact in the second half of\nthe movie nobody talks about the first\nhalf in the movie at all\num the cowboy character shows up in the\nsecond half and Joker meets up with them\nbut it's like the first half of the\nmovie didn't even exist I think that\nfreaked people out and watched him film\nout the jackets like you're watching two\nseparate movies\num and I think it was like they're two\nheart two hemispheres of the brain\nseparated the oil and but it's not just\nanimal mother who that happens with\nlots of the other characters in the\nfirst half of the movie appear to be\nreborn in the second half so you've got\nprivate snowball which is the black\ncharacter in the first half\num he becomes private eight ball in the\nsecond half\nand he gets killed later\num and yeah yeah so that that's that's\nthe way I look at it is the the squad is\nreborn as their jungian shadows in\nVietnam and the military has split their\npsyche so that they've become somebody\nelse and they can't even remember who\nthe hell they were when he started the\nbasic training well there was one um\na very clear clue they're found in the\nthe Full Metal Jacket script and if you\nlook in the movie the look The Lost hog\nsquad has got it's got a number it's\n4092 or something like that you\num but in the script it's the the\ntrainees who've got that number so\nthey've got their squad and it's named\n4092 or whatever number it is and in the\nmovie it switches to the Lost hog Squad\nin the second half I thought that was\nquite interesting you know\num so yeah it's been a a while since\nI've done any videos on Full Metal\nJacket but that's the general uh jungian\ngist uh that I got from that yeah I\nthink that's brilliant because I\nremember the first time I saw that movie\nback when I was a teenager\nI would not have been able to make that\ninterpretation I think my sense of\nprivate piles suicide was it was a\ncommentary on just like the brutality\nand cruelty of the military yeah and it\nyou know this it just destroyed this\nperson through like this ritualized\ntrauma and it was a commentary on the\nevils of militarism and maybe even\nAmerican imperialism I do think it was\nthat as well I mean this is the thing is\nlike with Kubrick he he wasn't just he\ndidn't just feel the need to present one\nnarrative he was happy to present you\nwith a number of different things\num which all have some truth to them and\nyeah the first half of the movie works\nvery well on that point and I always\nperceived it on that level as well so\nI'm not saying that that version of the\nfirst half of the movie is invalid and\nit's just the youngin take on it is it's\njust a different uh view of it but the\nthe good thing about that jungi intake\nis it does make kind of sense of the\nsecond half of the movie and that's\nwhere people get confused what the hell\nis this second half of the story where's\nit going what's it about\nyeah yeah and and that's why it it's\nweird it's\nwhen I watch some of your\ninterpretations of films and I think\nthis is probably true for symbolic\ninterpretation in general it's like when\nI hear your vision of it it like makes\nso many things clear and it's almost\nlike that moment of that makes total\nsense and I kind of on some level knew\nthat without even knowing it that I\nthink is the confirmation of the\nvalidity of the interpretation it's like\nthe things that you point out are\nabsolutely true but they were just\nhappening subliminally like below the\nlevel of my own awareness\num but everything kind of shifts and\nthere's a great deal of like Integrity\nbetween between everything that\npreviously just seemed confusing and\ndisjointed and hence the reason why you\nwould click to watch your film analysis\nof fullwell jacket you wouldn't watch it\nif you didn't think there was more there\nabsolutely and I think you're right most\npeople really\nfirst half of that movie which is weird\nbecause the second half is the war movie\nyou know on some level it's the action\nit's the killing it's the yeah I think\npart of the reason why a lot of folks\ndon't like the second half is because\nit's not actually just a flat out War\npick it has this like meta Narrative of\nthe soldiers in action but also like\nbeing interviewed about being in action\nwhich sort of like breaks up the action\nof the war movie which is unusual I\ndon't know any other war movie that's\nkind of like that\nyeah yeah it's it's\nthe yeah there's a funny aspect of it\nwhere it's like in the second half of\nthe movie you know they talked about\nJohn Wayne a lot in the film both in the\nfirst and second half there's references\nto John Wayne and it's it's kind of like\nin the second half of the film uh all\nthe soldiers are acting like they are in\na movie\num you know even in like the first\nbattle scene it's like they're all\nposing for the camera you know trying to\nlook tough for the camera and stuff and\num and you got the when they're all\nsneaking up towards that building where\nthere's I think the snipers or something\nup in the building not the ending of the\nmovie the first battle scene and they\nall just blast this this building to\nPieces\num and it's so staged and choreographed\nit's it's like they\nit's like they are it's almost like\nthey're aware that they're in a movie\nit's like we are in a war movie and\num well I think that was part of when\nthey play it up and we're going to act\nit up yeah yeah and I think that's part\nof why the Vietnam War as I understand\nit was so unpopular because it was the\nfirst excessively televised War so that\ncould be like a kind of historically\naccurate um you also talked about the\nmilitary creating a man and I'm actually\ndoing a number of pieces on like\nperformative masculinity and so maybe\nthe introduction of the camera in the\nfilm is a commentary on how\nwe it's like\nwe we that men these days are are acting\nas if they were men on some level that\nthey that's more of a performance of\nmasculinity than\num but actually\nokay man potentially\nfascinating stuff okay um can I pivot\nagain Rob okay because once around\nwhatever subjects you want to talk about\nI want to be sure we get to this because\nuh I'm one of the biggest James Bond\nfans on planet I get a sense that you're\nup there too so I'm really excited to be\ntalking to you about the series so um\nI I probably got into Bond when I was a\nteenager and I just became obsessed with\nhim and I probably seen all the\npre-crag movies at least\n20 or 30 times so it's like I'm pretty\noh that's a serious bonfire serious yeah\num so I want to there's a number of\nthings we can discuss first I just got\nto get off my chest because I think that\nyou've made your uh public let's say\ndisdain is that too strong of a word for\nthe for the Craig movies\nso what's up why do you why do you hate\nthe Daniel Craig Bond movies so much\num\nI don't know about hate I just find them\nboring incredibly boring\num you were talking about uh people\nacting up on masculinity\num and instead of actually being\nmasculine and I see that with the Craig\nBond movies and there's too much of an\neffort to try and make him look\nreally tough and hard and you know it's\nlike I prefer the old bonds where Bond\nwas having a laugh and\num I I love the uh the Sean Connery\nRoger Moore Timothy Dalton era\num\nyeah there's so much to go into about\nthat yeah but it's I find the new ones\nare too fake uh ironically that they try\nto be more realistic but they're not\nmore realistic they're just as stupid as\nthe old ones\num but they try to put this uh veneer of\nrealism on it\num that isn't there the plots are just\nas stupid the the characters are just as\nstupid the fights are just as\nunrealistic but in the old movies they\nembraced it and they they didn't lie\nabout it and they they acknowledge to\nthe audience who said look you know we\nknow this is absolute garbage we know\nthis is juvenile teenage\num masculine sexual fantasy and it's it\ncould never happen in the real world but\nwe are going to fulfill those deep\nfantasies that you've got on the most\nbrilliant level\num you know you know we're going to take\nthe fantasy beyond what even you would\nwould do with it you know\num and I love how they did that because\nfor me that felt very honest they made\nthem movies unrealistic\nbut I think that was honest because the\nfantasies that we men have\nthat were being fulfilled by the movies\nthose fantasies are unrealistic to begin\nwith so I think the more mature approach\nis to present it unrealistically on the\nscreen and the new movies try to\nuh pretend that it's not pretended\nyeah they do have this like grittiness\nand this realism we don't have exploding\npens and uh you know helicopters and\nsuitcases and women with ridiculous\nnames and and things like that but\num\nrealistic by the way\nthat case that they're not more\nrealistic I I do think that for most of\nthe series they are catering to the male\nfantasy it's like who would want to be\nthis dashing secret agent who lives a\nlife of adventure embeds all these\nbeautiful women and saves the world I\nmean it's like sign me up for that that\nsounds fantastic\nand there seemed to be some sort of like\ncrisis of conscience about this that\nhappened in my I think the first signs\nwe see it in our GoldenEye which I we\nwatched a couple of years ago a lot of\npeople that are my age have this\nromanticized view of GoldenEye I think\nbecause of the video game that came up\nuh at that time around the time when we\nwere classic game and so we love golden\neye but when you go back and watch it\nit's actually kind of depressing and a\nlot of that movie they spend just like\nflagellating bond for his misogynism for\nhis you know being out of date you know\nthe money Penny the new Young Money\nPenny isn't going to flirt with them so\nshe's she's too good for his advances\nand it's like we can't have fun anymore\nin in Goldeneye and it was like we have\nto stop uh we have to stop The\nSuperficial male fantasy that we've been\nindulging in for too long and not only\nthat we have to enact some sort of\npenance on men and I actually think\nthat's where we're getting within the\nCraigs because I do I do think that\num you know ever every actor who played\nBond certainly brought something unique\nto the role and I think that's also not\njust\na representation of who he was as a\nperson or an actor but also of the times\nand um I think what Craig brought to\nbond was you know that we hadn't really\nseen in bond before is that I can take\nit I can take whatever you throw at me\nand still stand up like I'm tougher than\nanything else it's like you couldn't\nthink Roger Moore I don't think could\nreally get the crap beaten out of them\nmaybe you know he he'd probably keep a\nstiff British upper lip but like Craig\nis just no matter what you throw at me\nno matter if you it's the same with\nConnery by the way I mean a lot of\npeople think if Connery as being a tough\nBond but actually when you see him with\nhis shirt up in the movies he was just\nas skinny as Roger Moore he just had a\nhairy chest but heavy chest doesn't stop\nbut lots of conscious does it you know\nso yeah I mean we had Bond like running\nthrough drywalls in Casino Royale and\njust like being this this\nalmost this unhinged weapon of like pure\nID and destruction that needs to kind of\nbe reigned in in Casino Royale to become\na more targeted effective assassin\nbasically\num but I do think that the the Craigs\nare kind of a\num I mean we're talking about how to be\na man in a modern society that kind of\ndoesn't believe in men that thinks that\nmen have done all kinds of bad things in\nthe past and not only maybe shouldn't be\nin power anymore but maybe need to be\nbrought to bear for those transgressions\nthose historical Transmissions\nand um that Bond as the man who's like\nwho gets things done and it's tough is\nbecoming increasingly irrelevant like\nyou see that in the exchange with q in\nCasino Royale and they made Q into this\num this young nerdy character we also\nfind out in no time to die that he's gay\nand he basically says that you know\nyou're I can do more damage\non my laptop than you could in your\nentire life you're you're just someone\nneeds to pull the trigger every once in\na while so we're using you you're just\nlike this brute animal you don't really\nhave a place and you also see that in\nthe storyline in like um uh what is it\nSpecter where uh who is it C is trying\nto take over MI6 it's like the the whole\nMI6 Empire is we don't need this anymore\nwe're globalists uh we need to move\nBeyond this parochial view of\nnationality it's just like the whole\nthing about that bond is coming up\nagainst in the Craig films is you are\nirrelevant like that just gets told to\nhim over and over and over again and\nover and over and over again he shows\nthat he's not\nlike I think that's the the male fantasy\ntoday which is men live in the society\nwhere they're kind of being told in so\nmany ways that they are increasingly\nirrelevant yeah you know we're not\nthat's a good take on it I like that\nyeah and and Craig's and he kind of\ntakes it on the chin every time it's\nlike the exchange with Vesper on the\ntrain when he just like Smiles as she\nskewers him and no one really\nbelieves in him but he is he gets the\njob done and almost everybody comes\naround and respects him in the end and I\nthink that's the new male fantasy not\nthat I'm gonna go in bed you know 30\ndifferent women and have a bunch of cool\ncars it's that like I can still be a man\nand be respected and celebrated for\ndoing so yeah what do you think\nuh I can I can see that reading of it\num I don't\nfor me it doesn't make the movies work\nfor me\num because\nright in order to be respected as a man\nyou have to save the world and I can go\nthrough all kinds of pain and beat\npeople up and fighting and stuff but\nthat's the male fantasy version what\ndoes that mean a woman doesn't have to\ngo through that does that mean some\nother person from some other group\ndoesn't have to do that why is it only a\na male has to do that you know it's a\ngood point so yeah it's not a message\nthat I agree with\num but I also never got the the feeling\nand I didn't cease back to but I saw the\nother ones I never got the feeling in\nany of those movies that he ended up\nrespected at the end it's all for me the\nendings were always just flat and dull\num well he died in the last one didn't\nhe well he does and then they toast him\nand you know everybody is very sad uh\nVesper comes around after he started\nwith his hacks very sad uh maybe you're\nright it's the difference isn't it I saw\nsome interesting takes one thing that I\ndo think was great about the Craig\nseries is that really for the first time\nyou see continuity between the films\nwhich I think was some something that\nthe series as a whole really\nmissed out on like I think you see\nSylvia trench for two seconds in From\nRussia with Love and she's the girl that\nyou meet at the baccarat table in Dr No\nbut other than that other than like q\nand Moneypenny and there's like no every\nevery movie is it takes place in like\nthis almost\nin its own time capture a lot of\nmedically sealed universe exactly and I\nthink that I do kind of like that though\nbecause I love the fact that with all\nthe old movies you can just say which\nBond movie do I feel like watching today\nand you can dive into any one of them\nand it's a complete whole experience on\nits own\num\nwhere's the new ones yeah it's more like\na series I I prefer the old style but I\ncan understand that there there are\nappeals to having a continuous story\nbetween them all but there's some\ninteresting things that come out of the\nuh the disconnected nature between the\nold\num Bond films it's almost like they're\nall remakes of the same story you know\nand the formula for sure yeah definitely\nthe same formula they're all remade lots\nand lots of different ways\num and you kind of always knew what the\noutcome was was going to be but there's\nthings about that that I found really\nfascinating and one of them is uh if you\nlooked at them as being continuous a\ncontinuous Bond story\nwhat happens to each\num woman he gets with at the end of each\nmovie before the next movie is the I was\nactually thinking I might do a video on\nthis at some point I think you talked\nabout this in one of your episodes you\nhave a little pep probably bad yeah I\nmean does he does he does he kill them\noff does he uh you know is he serial\nkiller uh does he just go and sneakily\ndump them is this some woman\nbroken-hearted crying their eyes out\nsomewhere well he's off Adventure in in\nthe world meeting the next girl\nyou don't often see that you see that I\nthink in uh Tomorrow Never Dies where he\ngoes up to uh Terry Hatcher's character\nand she just slaps him and I think this\nis the first time in a film where bond\ngets reintroduced\nto a woman that he has seduced in the\npast you don't you see that yeah yeah\nand then he succeeds in seducing her\nagain so I guess yeah yeah of course he\ndoes yeah yeah there's always an excuse\nto let Bond off with them with being a\nnaughty boy isn't it you know so it was\nusually like he sleeps with one girl or\ntwo girls early in the movie and they\nget killed by the bad guys sometimes\nBond even slip slips up and accidentally\nputs them in danger and they get killed\nanyway but then he gets to be with the\nwoman he really wants in the movie at\nthe end and he doesn't have to have the\nguilt of dumping the other ones because\nthey got killed\nI think that's certainly the formula I I\ndon't know the numbers but I get the\nsense that in recent movies he seduces\nfewer women per movie\ntoo I think we're all about Madeline\nSwann and there are other some there's\nsome other eye candy in that movie but I\ndon't think he actually seduces them my\nfavorite girl in no time to die was\nPaloma the girl that did you see that\none Rob I've seen it yeah I can't\nremember much of it\nthat one really uh kicked me in the\nteeth\num Paloma is the girl that she he meets\nup with I think in Cuba with Felix and\nthey have like\na big gun fight she's super competent\nshe's on the floor shooting the people\nand and drinking with her and at the end\nhe like shakes her hand says good job\nand it's like it's almost that one felt\na little heavy-handed it's like man this\nis how you're supposed to treat female\ncolleagues and you know even if they're\nbeautiful and\num you know this is a male fantasy so uh\nbut I do think that you know he didn't\nsleep with her and in fact\num there's a little bit of a\nmisunderstanding in a scene where she\nbrings him into a closet to get him into\nchange into like an outfit and um he\nthinks that they're going to have sex\nand she's just like no no no no\num that actually happens in a different\npoint in the movie with the woman who\nbecomes the new 007\nyeah she kind of picks him up at the\nclub and they go back to his house and\nhe just is she's like is the bedroom\nover here and he's like okay I guess\nwe're doing this and it turns out that\nshe's the new 007 and they're not gonna\nhave sex so it almost feels like the I\nthink the number of seductions has\ndecreased significantly in recent years\nand I think that is\num maybe that just has to do with the\npolitical climate or uh how some of the\nSeductions in the bond series have\nreally kind of\ntoyed with the line of consent let's put\nit that way I'm thinking there's a\nthing with the from what I recall with\nthe the Craig Bond films were if he does\nsleep with a woman it has to it has to\nbe because there's been some sort of a\ntrauma he's been through a horrible time\nor she's been through a horrible time\nand it's kind of like\num\nblocking out the raw sexual attraction\nand making out that it's like oh this is\nan emotional connection based upon\nshared trauma sure which again I found\nI find it dishonest because people do\nhave raw sex Desires in real life people\ndo go around you know guys and women\nthat go around and see people and\num just uh you know decide I'm gonna\nbut I I would like to just this\nperson that's what people do it's like\ncan you hear my phone going off in the\nother room there you're good okay my\nphone's going off if you can't hear it\nthat's fine\num so yeah people do have this raw\npornographic desire for people who they\njust spot in the streets or people they\nknow that is what people are really like\nyou know it's it's there\num so I think to try and take the bond\nthing and hide that and say we've got\nwe're only going to have Bond have\num sex with women when there's some\nemotional trauma that's going on between\nthem and they need to support each other\nit's not always like that you know\num\nI guess I I don't see the point of\nmaking trying to make bonds more\nrealistic\num\nor to try and make bond into the\nsocially responsible uh movie series\nit was never intended to be anything\nlike that\num if you're gonna make if you're gonna\ndo a spy series that is socially\nresponsible then you should have a spy\nwho questions uh the orders that you\nreceive through you should have a spy\nwho looks into his own government and\nfinds out who he's really working for\nwhat they're really about what their\nagendas are not just the agendas of the\nenemy\num if you're going to do a socially\nresponsible spy film you go down that\nroute and that would involve uh James\nBond going off in a direction that would\nbe unrecognizable from anything we've\nseen before it's like an underpinning\nthere's an underpinning of the Bond\nmovies where his own government is\nalways in the right it's always\ntrustworthy it might make some mistakes\nbut it's got the right ideas it's you\nknow at heart and therefore he is\nJustified in killing people blowing\nthings up whatever attacking enemies in\norder to defend what his government has\nordered him to do you know that was\nalways a a naive aspect of bond\num and it's almost like it's like bond\nis a um it's like he's a man's life you\nknow\num he's brainwashed into thinking that\nhe should spend his life putting himself\nin danger in order to protect who who\nare these people who give them the\norders you know I think they played with\nthat realistic on bond I would say drop\nthat stuff sure they I think they play\nwith that a little bit in Goldeneye in\nthe antagonism between\n007 006 who betrays England and you know\nSean Bean is questioning for England you\nknow he's only he's only a colleague he\ndoesn't need to show him being character\nI'm talking about the people who are\nhigh up above bomb absolutely but I\nthink that's in in the second definition\nof the shadow that I was mentioning\nthat's interesting in Goldeneye because\n006 is like a double O who begins\npresumably to question the the\nrighteousness of the British government\nand the orders and like goes Rogue and\nbetrays the government and so he's like\nthe shadow side of 007 who's just is\nblindly obeying orders and doing\neverything for Queen and country that's\nactually an interesting antagonist which\nfilm is that in that's golden eye yeah\nit's one of the best parts of that film\nis I like gold knife because it was a\ndecent Bond Sean Bean as as Alex\ntrevillian was was fantastic there is a\nthere's a spy movie that kind of off top\nof my head that does do that it's not an\naction-packed spy movie but it's called\nthe lives of others have you seen that\none Rob very very good yeah\na lot of the things that that you\ndiscussed that movie didn't get talked\nabout very much no I think it did win\nyou're one of the very very few\nit's a great film I I think I saw that\none in the theaters a long time ago did\nIt win best foreign picture I'm not I'm\nnot sure I think it did win some awards\nwon some awards somewhere I can't\nremember why it it got some good\nrecognition when it came out and it just\nseems to have been largely forgotten\nabout in film discussion since then I'd\neven forgotten about it myself for years\nyeah that was a pretty good one I have\nto know um do you have a favorite Bond\nI have a soft spot for more too because\nthe very first Bond movie I saw was um\nThe Man with the Golden Gun yeah and uh\nwhich I think\nIt's actually an underrated Bond but it\ncertainly is one of the best uh and so I\ngrew up kind of with Roger Moore\nwell I mean what I what I love about\num Roger Moore is that he's the happiest\nBond if you were going to pick any of\nthe bonds and live there life had picked\nthe Roger Moore one because it just\nseems to be really cheerful and happy\neverywhere he goes and none of the bad\nthings that happened seem to make it\ndense in him emotionally you know\num he lives a great life and he's a real\ncharmer and he's hilarious he has a\nlaugh I wouldn't want to live the Daniel\nCraig Bond life because he's too\nmiserable and angry and depressing I\nfind it boring I don't like people like\nthat I like people who've got a bit of\nlife to them and people who they don't\njust\ntake all the punches that life has got\nto give and get back up and fight back\nthey actually come back fighting and\nthey're happy as well they stay happy\ndespite the traumas I think um for me\nthe new the new Bond is kind of like a\nsymptom of something that's been going\non for a long time where\num people value anger and uh self-pity\nfar too much you never got Roger More\npity and himself in the the bond role\nyou know I mean even the actor Roger\nMoore didn't take the role seriously\num but yeah it's like this like the bond\nwho has to be pitied because this\nhappened to him when he was a child or\nhe got his heart broken and blah blah\nblah blah\nfor me bond isn't a character you're\nsupposed to Petty he's supposed to be\nsomeone who bounces back strong and\npositive\nevery time you know so I love that it's\nnot realistic but for me that's a much\nbetter fantasy uh as a bond I think I\ncan respect that I mean I I understand\nthat if you can get through something\nbut you're so traumatized by having\npassed through it that you're devoid of\nany Joy or meaning then that's certainly\na pure Victory isn't it it's not it's\nnot a victory it's all really is and you\nmight physically survive but you your\nemotions haven't survived if you if you\nstay in trauma Zone do you have a\nfavorite film\nfavorite movie out of the uh series\nout of the bond series yeah mine again\nthis is an unpopular choice but I\n love Moonraker I love Moonraker\ntoo yeah I did when the when the\npandemic just started uh I did a a\nbondathon I did a tournament of all the\nmovies I'm a huge Bond nerd and\nMoonraker got really really far it's\nlike the apotheosis of\njust the the\nbonds fantasy it's like the formula is\ncubed it's just bond to the moon it's so\nover the top and it's so like self-aware\nof being over the top it's it's just a\njoy to watch it's so much fun\nand it's it's there's so much good stuff\nto say about I mean it's gorgeously shot\ncinematography and moon record is\nfantastic you know not just a special\neffects but just beautifully shop\nthroughout\nand\num I mean I mean the themes of it are\nfantastic as well you know it's uh\nparticularly with the pandemic\nyou cut this guy in the space station in\nthe movies fairly use like uh\ngenetically engineered whatever the hell\nhe says to kill people not that I'm\nsaying that the the pandemic was that\nwell it's crossed all of our minds at\nsome point anyone who says it hasn't\ncrossed their mind is a liar it could\nwell have been I don't know\num but yeah but there's also a massive\nuh overlap between Moonraker and Dr\nStrangelove and 2001 A Space Odyssey and\nthis is true I've documented this in\nsome videos before\num this very specific references to uh\n2001 Space Odyssey in the novelization\nof Moonraker which was written alongside\nwith the movie\num\nyeah just loads and loads of great it's\neven got the thing which uh I I don't\nthe only other movie I can think of that\ndoes this Starship Troopers where\num Moonraker shows a a future Hitler\ntype character and he was supposed to be\na Hitler type character like a Doctor\nStrange Love German character but he\nmade they used a french actor because\nthey needed to film in France when they\nwere making Moonraker and he did a great\njob I can't remember the actor's name\nwho played the villain but you know\nfrench actor he was superb but that\ncharacter was scripted to be very\nspecifically\num so so he he had a German history\num that he was an ex-nazi you know and\nso\nin Moonraker that character shows up and\nhe's creating this new master race and\num Bond sort of points this out later\num when they're arguing on the space\nstation about his vision of the future\nbut his\ntotalitarian Master race is a\nmulticultural word\nhe hasn't gone the Hitler route he's\ngone beyond the path of I'm going to\ntake these couples of all the different\nraces I'm going to bring them along and\nI'm going to create\num a version of Hitler's\num ideas about how the world was going\nto be but I'm going to make it\nMulticultural version of it and so\nMoonraker did that back in 1979 and for\nme that that\nthat was a crystal ball ahead towards\nwe've got now because a lot of the\npeople who are pushing\num the multiculturalism and diversity\nstuff don't give a damn about that stuff\nthat's a tool that they are using to\ndivide people that's the way I view it\num it's a lot of rich white people who\nare pushing that stuff to get other\npeople attacking each other on the basis\nof race gender stuff like that and and\nthat prevents people from actually\nlooking at the very super Richard that's\noften saying hang on what are they doing\nto us yet divide and conquer so I think\nthat's been happening in a while then I\nthink Moonraker predicted that and the\nother movie that predicted that was\nStarship Troopers because it showed them\na future Society where\num you have men and women as equally\nequally as soldiers\num fighting in the battlefield and stuff\nand um and you have all the different\nraces together and it's like we've got\nthis big diverse future Society but it's\na totalitarian one anyway\nyou know so that those are the only two\nmovies I can think of that tapped into\nthat so that was one good aspect of the\nmoon right that's fascinating yeah I I\ndid notice that in the film when I\nrewatched it that it was uh not going\nthe pure Airy and bloodline route when\nthey did show the\num the couples that were selected to\nrepopulate Earth but they were all like\nbeautiful and I presumably you know very\ngenetically healthy like they were they\nwere tested and uh you know for their\nwhich defeat defeats the points of\ndiversity they're not diverse in terms\nof their level of Health well that's\ncertainly true so it's just taken\nHitler's Doctrine and instead of basing\nit on one single race we're gonna base\nit on the most healthy beautiful\nspecimens\nyou know which how is that any better\nyeah\nyeah there is a uh there's a lot of\nuh history that people don't understand\nabout the like Eugenics movement there\nwas a Eugenics movement in the United\nStates that predated the uh Eugenics\nmovement in Europe\nuh they were on laws on the books in\nseveral U.S states until I think maybe\nthe 60s or 70s with mandatory\nsterilization of certain individuals\nthat were uh yeah say cognitively\nimpaired for instance\num you know pretty\npretty nasty laws but the the idea that\nwe can\num we can move in the direction of that\ncertain certain parts certain types of\nindividuals are really corrupting the\nnature of society and it's\nit's our responsibility to cleanse\nSociety of these folks I mean that's a\nvery old idea and I don't know if it's\never going away it sounds like what\nyou're arguing is that it's it's just\nbeen transmitted into something that is\nabsolutely more socially acceptable and\nbecause of that it's harder to see\nfind it harder to see so maybe a lot of\npeople do\num yeah yeah I made a video about the\ndepartment of the jungian Shadow thing\nthat well you know which is you know\nlike I said Carl Jung said this goes on\nwith all laws uh with the Nazis uh We've\nbought the Nazis and they are the evil\nones completely utterly evil and we are\nabsolutely right to fight and defeat\nthem and do whatever is necessary to\ndefeat them but we're not recognizing\nthat what is there in the Nazis is there\nin us as well in Britain and America and\neverywhere else it was true back then it\nwas still true now I mean if I remember\nrightly Than That season some of their\npropaganda stuff they used to put out\num they would actually point out how\num the UF streets uh blacks you know and\num that was well they will put that out\nas part of their propaganda but there\nwas some truth to it you know so you got\ntwo sides who uh who've got racism going\non lots of different groups each\ncriticizing each other's racism it's\njust Shadow stuff projectional you know\nfrom both you see that yeah I I do I I\nI'm conscious of the time and I've\nreally enjoyed the conversation so far\nRob I I will\num also mention since we're talking\nabout Moonraker\nthe\nyou you called to my attention this\nperceptual illusion about Dolly's braces\nI I had to go back and watch that movie\nas soon as I saw that video because I\ncould not believe you I had this\nincredibly strong memory of seeing\nDolly's mouth break into a racist-filled\nsmile when she died\nand I was like there's no way I've seen\nthat movie 40 times I know that by heart\nand she doesn't have braces it was so it\nwas so incredible\nand I I think your explanation for why\nthat perceptual illusion existed in the\nminds of so many people uh I think it\nwas\num you know persuasive so thanks for\nbringing that to my attention well I\nhope it was because I can't find that\nfootage the original footage in there\nyeah I sure thought she did but I went\nat least on the DVD versions I had the\nVHS versions back when I was a kid I\ndon't think I have them anymore\num I did notice you've only saw no time\nto die once so you probably wouldn't\ncatch this but there was changes in the\nmovie from the theatrical release to the\nDVD release they're not the same film\nI don't know why they did this but there\nwere they changed the scene between Bond\nand uh the villain who who what's his\nname\nLucifer it's like Lucifer luciferon or\nsomething like that I can't remember I\ncan't even remember the the character\nthat Randy Malek plays when Bond\nconfronts him in his Fortress and they\nhave that back and forth about like some\nmen I remember very explicitly in the\ntheater as it was a very weird shot\nwhere usually they do this um\nyou know the kind of perspective taking\nback and forth within the conversation\nand then there was this shot where the\ncamera looks right at Bond and bond\nlooks right into the camera which never\nhappens and he basically says some\npeople don't you know want to play God\nand it was just this really jarring shot\nthat doesn't exist in the DVD release\nand there's a few other lines that have\nbeen changed and the shots have been\nchanged I think as far as I can tell\nonly in that conversation and I have not\nbeen able to find any information about\nthis on the internet I don't know if\nanybody else has even noticed this but I\nguarantee I'm remembering this correctly\nbecause it was such a jarring change and\nthat kind of you know close up into the\ncamera look these things do happen don't\nthey do you think that happened with\nDolly's braces I'm thinking I'm thinking\nit's possible because you think that you\nhave this strong memory of the braces I\nthink I have a strong memory the braces\nbut why would they that doesn't make\nsense that they would like get rid of\nbraces from the VHS you did mention\nbefore that there was uh the thing about\nwhen you were younger you watched the\nmovie on VHS yeah and yeah I think I put\nthat in the video I did about it where\nwhen you're watching the VHS because\nit's a a lower resolution image you're\ngoing to be more likely to perceive\nbraces there\num you know often watching the HD movie\nmakes it look so much different visually\nand there's been times when I've done\nstudies of movies uh years like some of\nmy early film studies I had to rely on\nuh DVDs I didn't have there wasn't\nreally hardly any HD movies out back\nthen when I first started doing film\nanalysis and there would be points where\nI would thought that I could see certain\nthings in the certain movies and then\nwhen I get the HD version suddenly it's\nmore clear so that's what it is okay I\nwould never have been able to guess that\nso it could be something like that I\nalways thought though that it was such a\nclever little visual thing that the\ndirectors were doing because you have\nJaws who's this monstrous yeah not only\nis he tall but he's monstrous because he\nhas this like bunch of metal in his\nmouth and you would think he'd be\nterrifying to this small little girl and\nthen when she smiles she has metal in\nher mouth too\nyeah it makes total sense that the\nbraces should be there yeah um\ndefinitely and the way she slowly Smiles\nyou you think oh there's going to be a\nslow revealing of the of the braces\nthere and yeah it is it's a it's a an\nincredible illusion there unless there\nit really is some sort of\nuh conspiracy where the footage got\nchanged or something I don't know it was\nuh I don't I don't think so I don't know\nwhy they would take the braces out but I\nI want to know why they changed the\ndialogue in that scene in no time to die\nso if anybody out there knows please get\nin touch with me uh Rob I feel like I\ncould talk to you all day but I want to\nbe respectful of your time uh anything\nelse you'd like to say\nuh not that I can think of no I can't\nremember if there was any other subjects\nwe wanted to discuss uh I mean what\nabout if there's any last topic you'd\nlike to quickly cover or you know\nwhatever\num\nwell we can leave Bond\num I\nI'd like to know maybe if you have any\nfilm recommendations for folks out there\nI I have the Criterion channel do you\nhave that Rob\nI haven't got the channel no but I've\ngot lots of movies that are from the\nCriterion Collection I don't get any\nkind of Kickback from saying this but I\nhighly recommend that people look into\nthe possibility of getting a Criterion\nChannel subscription it is fantastic\nit's 100 bucks a year and you get access\nto thousands and thousands of like the\nhighest grade World Cinema Classics\num movies that are very hard to find\nanywhere certainly you're not going to\nfind them on Netflix\num and so that's really helped me to\nbroaden my cinematic Horizons but um\nalways looking to know\nwhere I'm what I'm missing so do you\nhave any recommendations for folks\nokay so I was trying to think of some\namazing movies which hardly anybody\nknows about so talks about and one\nspring Springs to mind came out the same\nyear as 2001 A Space Odyssey but it\ncleared up at the Oscars was the musical\nversion of Oliver you know Oliver Twist\nsure I saw that a long time ago\nyeah that is an amazing movie on all\nkinds of levels wow I haven't seen it in\na while in a long time do you think\nthat's that movie's so great and the\nsize of the production is just\nincredible just on the pure technicality\nof the scale of the production the\nsongwriting and musical score is\nincredible I don't even like musicals\ngenerally it's usually my least favorite\ngenre and for me that's the best music\nI've ever made I like pretty much all\nthe songs in it\num\nthe the actors the set designs you know\nthe many\num classic performances in it and Oliver\nReed was amazing because Bill Sykes and\nyeah you've got tears it's Tom Moody as\nPlace Fagan\num there's just so much good stuff in\nthat movie I've been wanting to make a\nvideo about it for years but not really\ngood I did make a short video on the\nbill Sykes character\noh yeah that's a movie that uh still\nmassively impresses with me today\num I think partially I like it because\nit gets into this really dark aspect of\nuh history how people lived and suffered\nand died in in\nparts of Britain back then and\num\nbut the subject matter is so grim\nthat the movie has to use a musical\npresentation in order to stop in the\nblow for the audience if it was just\ndone in this with the same crew and\ndirector and everything\num with no musical aspects of it I think\nit would have been too Grim for people\num so yeah I think the the the musical\nframe and of it makes it very palatable\nyeah that's fantastic one of my one of\nmy top 20 favorite movies of it that's a\nstrong recommendation I watched a long\ntime ago when I went through all of the\nbest picture\num films I haven't seen it in years but\non that recommendation I will check it\nout again\nyeah call Rob if people want to know\nmore about your stuff where can they\nfind you\nuh on the YouTube channel\ncollatedlearning.com\nc-o-l-a-t-i-v-e correlative learning or\non the website of the same name and um\nyeah yeah this is a couple hundred\nvideos there on the YouTube channel some\nof them are really long like two hours\nlong so we'll be just short ones and\nthen on the website there's uh articles\nand stuff available there as well yeah\nI'll put those film analysis but\nsometimes on psychology stuff as well\nI'll put links in the descriptions for\nfolks and some of those videos are\ndefinitely worth watching even the\nlonger ones um especially the ones on\nThe Shining uh blew my mind man so\nreally great work thank you so much for\ntalking to me today thanks for having me\non it's a pleasure talking to you yeah\nthanks Rob all right let's touch all\nright bye"
