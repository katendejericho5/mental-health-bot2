    "video_title": "The TRUE payoff of HYPERGAMY",
    "transcript": "after all the time and effort expended\nto align with the criteria of hypergamy\nthe payoff is not that a woman has\nultimately provided security and\nmaterial resources or even that a man\nhas offered sex and a relationship the\npayoff is the growth and prosperity that\nredowned to the man as a result what\ndoes this mean well a top 10 percent man\ncan only indirectly benefit a woman and\nthen only if she can acquire and\nmaintain access to the man however a top\n10 percent man directly benefits himself\nhe directly benefits from being stronger\nand wealthier in higher status these\nthings are primarily good for him and at\nbest only secondarily good for others\neven if much of his wealth and Status\nare stripped from him by a divorce or a\nbreakup he remains the source of that\nvalue and he became the source of that\nvalue in the transformational process of\nbecoming a top 10 percent man"
