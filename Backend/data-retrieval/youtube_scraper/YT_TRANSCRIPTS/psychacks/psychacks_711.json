    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is\npsychack's Better Living Through\npsychology and the topic of today's\nshort talk is what men don't understand\nabout female selection\nso thanks to the internet there has been\nan explosion of awareness on this topic\nin recent years and this has afforded\nthe current generation a uniquely\nprivileged position to understand female\nmating and dating Behavior more clearly\nand precisely than ever before\nthe quantity and quality of information\navailable on the subject just weren't\navailable to men even 10 years ago and\nwhile some of this information can be a\nbitter pill to swallow I hold that it is\nultimately of benefit to both men and\nwomen that it is now more widely known\none of the most important Concepts in\nthis cache of information is hypergamy\nthe tendency to mate and date up\nto choose men who for example are taller\nstronger richer and higher status\nhypergamy influences almost every aspect\nof female sexual selection and it has a\nnumber of significant Downstream\nconsequences so it's really really\nimportant to understand this concept\nunfortunately there are two common ways\nin which the concept is misunderstood by\nmen and I want to address these in\ntoday's talk so let's get to it\nthe two misunderstandings roughly\ncorrespond to the two general reactions\nmen seem to have in response to learning\nabout the reality of hypergamy\nthe first is the most prevalent as it\nunfortunately corresponds to the more\ncommon reaction of men\nbasically when a lot of men especially\nyoung men learn about women's sexual\nselection criteria\nthey get really discouraged\nthey hear that women are only interested\nin the top percent of the top 10 percent\nof men they consider well they weren't\nin the top 10 percent of men in high\nschool or in college or in young\nadulthood and they inappropriately\nconclude a that they could never enter\ninto those upper echelons or B that even\nif they could the payoff wouldn't be\nworth the time and effort required I.E\nthe juice isn't worth the squeeze they\nlook at themselves think well I don't\nhave anything a woman is really going to\nwant and conclude why bother\nand on some level it's like fair enough\ndating is not symmetrical men initiate\nthe vast majority of interactions so men\ndisproportionately experience more\nrejection than women do on the front end\nand women terminate the vast majority of\nrelationships so men disproportionately\nexperience more rejection than women do\non the back end and this rejection can\nbe painful on a number of different\ndimensions\nthese men may be rationally concluding\nthat a high risk low reward Endeavor\ndoesn't make sense for them if we were\ntalking about investing their money we\nwould call this decision prudent\nand no one would have a problem with it\non the other hand lots of people seem to\nhave a problem with the same decision\nbeing made about women\nthese men need to grow up man up stop\nsniveling and frankly fall in line\nthis is hardly fair and would likely\nmake a good topic for a future video\nhowever my point here is that these men\nmisunderstand the payoff of hypergamy\nafter all the time and effort expended\nto align with the criteria of hypergamy\nthe payoff is not that a woman has\nultimately provided security and\nmaterial resources or even that a man is\noffered sex and a relationship\nthe payoff is the growth and prosperity\nthat redowned to the man as a result\nwhat does this mean well a top 10\npercent man can only indirectly benefit\na woman and then only if she can acquire\nand maintain access to the man\nhowever a top 10 percent man directly\nbenefits himself\nhe directly benefits from being stronger\nand wealthier and higher status these\nthings are primarily good for him and at\nbest only secondarily good for others\neven if much of his wealth and Status\nare stripped from him by a divorce or a\nbreakup which can certainly happen in\ntoday's society he remains the source of\nthat value and he became the source of\nthat value in the transformational\nprocess of becoming a top 10 percent man\nso this is the first misunderstanding\nabout hypergamy that it primarily\nbenefits women it doesn't it primarily\nbenefits men and can only indirectly\nbenefit women namely if a man chooses to\nbestow the benefit upon her\nnow before I'm going any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow\nyou may also consider hitting the super\nthanks button those three little dots in\nthe lower right hand corner and tip me\nin proportion to the value you feel\nyou've received from this episode it's\nyour donations that make all this happen\nand I really appreciate your support\nnow not all men get discouraged upon\nlearning about the realities of\nhypergamy on the contrary a smaller\nsubset of men get fired up\nthese guys are energized by what they\nsee as a viable path forward they think\nfantastic with this information I can\nkind of hack the game I can analyze what\nreally works with respect to mating and\ndating and I believe that I can bring\nmyself in alignment with female\nselection preferences I can get rich I\ncan get fit I can get smooth let's go\nout there and get this bread\nand in many respects this is an Adaptive\nresponse because as stated previously\nall of these things benefit directly the\nman in question however in my opinion\nthis is where men are often shall we say\ndeceived\nbecause the fact of the matter is is\nthat women don't actually give sex in\nrelationships to men\nsimply as a consequence of men meeting\ntheir selection criteria\nthe idea that doing Behavior X will\nsolve problem Y is a masculine\nproblem-solving strategy projected into\nwomen\nmen hear that women want a guy with a\nsix pack and a six-figure income and\nthey think great if I get these things\nif I'm finally what women want then that\nmeans that women will reward me with sex\nand relationships\nit's the same mentality that believes\nokay if I buy her a drink and listen to\nher problems and show my value then she\nwill reward me with sex at the end of\nthe date writ large\nand the disappointing reality is that\nthis is not the case\nsure all other things being equal a\nwoman is more likely to choose a guy\nwith a six pack and a six-figure income\nover a guy that doesn't have those\nthings\nbut it's not true that the vast majority\nof women will choose a guy just because\nhe has a six pack and a six-figure\nincome these things might make it easier\nfor a guy to get his foot in the door\nbut it's better to consider meeting\nwomen's hypergamous criteria as a\nnecessary but insufficient condition of\nsexual opportunity\nunless you are like world famous women\naren't going to be lining up to date you\neven if you have all of the things that\nhypergamy says that women are looking\nfor a good looking brain surgeon can\ndrink at the bar by himself all night\nand this is because despite the fact\nthat the man may have worked 10 to 20\nyears to meet women's hypergamous\ncriteria\nhe has to start from scratch with every\nnew woman he meets\nlike he could be a successful handsome\neligible bachelor who has worked hard\nfor years to earn his social proof and\nstatus\nand he will still have to start at\nsquare one which for a lot of women\nmeans convincing them that he's not a\nserial killer\nlike\ncan you imagine a job interview 20 years\ninto your career in which the\ninteraction begins with the default\nassumption that you are fraudulent\nembezzler until proven otherwise and\nthis is what happens with women they\nhave to feel safe they have to feel\nheard they have to feel like you're\nattracted to more than their bodies Etc\nand if you say one thing that they don't\nlike too early in the interaction poof\nthe opportunity vanishes in an instant\nand while it's true that the more a\nwoman is attracted to you the easier\nthis process becomes you don't get to\nbypass this process just because you've\ngot biceps in a bank account\nindeed you have to begin with women\nright where you would have if you hadn't\nspent 10 or 20 years building your\nstatus and lifestyle namely at zero\nand if you spend all that time on your\nabs and income and you never learned how\nto seduce a woman\nyou're probably not going to get as far\nas the guy who spent a year learning how\nto seduce a woman and has neither the\nABS nor the income hmm\nmeeting women's hypergamous criteria\nunfortunately is not the Silver Bullet\nthat many men hope it will be most of\nthese criteria are what I call\nattraction proxies\nthe idea here is that you can have all\nthe markers of a high status man\nand it's still not going to be easy with\nwomen\nyou will still have to approach and make\nan effort and seduce effectively\nthis doesn't change if you're in the top\nten percent it may change if you're in\nthe top .001 percent I'm not sure I'm\nnot there yet but it definitely doesn't\nchange in the top 10 percent\nbeing a high value man does not lead to\neffortless sexual opportunity\nand that's a bitter pill to swallow\nyou could be a neurosurgeon underwear\nmodel who makes seven figures a year in\nshelters abandoned puppies and the woman\nis still going to ask herself questions\nlike does he remember the day we met did\nhe open the door for me how do I feel\nwhen I'm with him does he make me laugh\ndoes he look at other girls well our\nkids hands look funny\nEtc behind the hypergamous criteria of\nthe female sex is an almost endless list\nof personal criteria of an individual\nwoman\nfailure to meet any one of which is\nsubject to removing the sexual\nopportunity no matter how many other\ncriteria are met\nso this is the second misconception\nabout hypergamy meeting hypergamous\ncriteria does not guarantee sexual\nopportunity\ninterestingly both of these\nmisconceptions tend to have the same\noutcome namely they generally motivate\nmen to walk away from women and that's\ncertainly what we're seeing more and\nmore of today\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and
