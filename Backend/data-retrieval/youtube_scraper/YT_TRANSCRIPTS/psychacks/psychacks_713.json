    "transcript": "once you've made a commitment to stop\ntalking to yourself in a way you\nwouldn't talk to somebody else that you\ncared about the next step is to begin to\ntalk positively to yourself what does\nthat look like basically you want to\nspeak to yourself like you're a\nsupportive coach or a good friend or for\nsome of you a loving parent this is\nlikely going to feel really weird in the\nbeginning but trust me it's super\nnecessary to the process just keep in\nmind that a supportive coach or a good\nfriend isn't going to ignore your\nmistakes or fluff up your ego they\naddress what needs to be addressed and\nthey praise what deserves to be praised\nwhat characterizes these roles is their\nUnapologetic and unwavering support and\ncommitment what I'm talking about here\nis the same degree of support and\ncommitment for your own success and\nwell-being"
