    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is\npsychak's Better Living Through\npsychology and the topic of today's\nshort talk is How To Love Yourself\nloving yourself is extremely important\nand this is because wherever you go\nthere you are\nwhat does that mean\neverything that you experience you\nexperience within your Consciousness\nit's not possible for you to experience\nanything outside of your Consciousness\nand within that Consciousness will be\nyourself or more precisely that\nConsciousness is yourself that self is\nsort of like a die that saturates\nthroughout a liquid it will color and\nflavor all the other contents in that\nsolution\nthis means for example that if you are\ncruel and self-loathing even if the\nother contents of your Consciousness are\nthe most Pleasant and delightful\npossible that cruel self-loathing self\nwill permeate these other contents and\nspoil whatever goodness pleasure or\nhappiness you might otherwise have\nexperienced by the same token a self\nthat is clean and loved will make it\nmuch easier to experience even\nunpleasant painful and difficult content\nwithout suffering in this way attending\nexclusively to your external\ncircumstances without paying attention\nto your internal environment is likely\nto prove self-defeating consequently we\nneed to learn how to love ourselves so\nthat wherever we go we can be assured of\ngood company\nnow if you were raised in a securely\nattached loving family this will likely\nbe easier for you to do than if you are\nraised in a chaotic and conflict-ridden\nenvironment however no matter your\ncircumstances I'm here to give you three\nactionable things that you can start\ndoing today in order to accelerate your\nprogress in the direction of self-love\nhere we go\nfirst and foremost make a commitment\nstarting now\nnot to speak to yourself in a way that\nyou wouldn't speak to a close friend\nthough I've been a therapist for over 10\nyears I am still shocked from time to\ntime at just how negatively some people\nspeak to themselves every mistake they\nmake is painfully Amplified and\neverything they do well is grossly\nminimized by this horribly negative\ncritical inner voice\nso the first step to loving yourself is\nto stop speaking to yourself in that way\nif you wouldn't say something out loud\nto someone that you cared about then\ndon't say it to yourself\neven if you don't care about yourself\nyet you have to begin to act as if you\ndid\nthis is so important because if you\ndenigrate someone over time it's so much\neasier to hate them\nthis is like an initial step in all\ntotalitarian regimes towards pogroms and\ngenocide to justify the violence against\na hated group you must first denigrate\nthem\nif the denigration does not occur it's\nmuch harder to see the targets as in\nhuman and therefore much more difficult\nto justify the atrocious Behavior by the\nsame token self-denegration justifies\nself-hatred and self-violence of all\nkinds so stop doing it now\nnow how do you respond to your critical\ninner voice when it invariably arises\nwell as soon as you become aware that it\nis active you implement the block and\nreplace technique first you block it hey\nthat's not true or hey we don't talk to\nourselves that way anymore\nand then you replace that thought with\nthe least pathologizing interpretation\nof reality that still fits the facts of\nthe case\nthis could look something like no it's\nnot true that I'm a complete piece of\nI just suffered a setback and I'm going\nto continue to work through this\ndifficult moment or no I'm not Unworthy\nof love\nif one person isn't interested in a\nrelationship with me that doesn't mean\nsomeone else won't be something like\nthat\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow\nand you can also hit the super thanks\nbutton it's and there's three little\ndots in the lower right hand corner\nbeneath the video and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you\nderived from this episode\nI really appreciate your support it\nmakes all this happen\nokay so once you've made a commitment to\nstop talking to yourself in a way you\nwouldn't talk to somebody else that you\ncared about the next step is to begin to\ntalk positively to yourself\nwhat does that look like\nbasically you want to speak to yourself\nlike you're a supportive coach or a good\nfriend or for some of you a loving\nparent\nthis is likely going to feel really\nweird in the beginning but trust me it's\nsuper necessary to the process just keep\nin mind that a supportive coach or a\ngood friend isn't going to ignore your\nmistakes or fluff up your ego they\naddress what needs to be addressed and\nthey praise what deserves to be praised\nwhat characterizes these roles is their\nUnapologetic and unwavering support and\ncommitment like these folks will be in\nyour corner until the end\nwhat I'm talking about here is the same\ndegree of support and commitment for\nyour own success and well-being\nso what does this look like well it can\nactually be a little cheesy\nit could sound something like hey you\nworked really hard today it wasn't\nalways easy but you did your best and\nthings seemed to turn out all right good\njob\nor\nhey you were afraid to do that but you\ndid it anyway that was courageous I'm\nproud of you\nthe idea here is to accurately reflect\nthe good that you do in your day-to-day\nlife just like an Engaged and supportive\nParenthood\nover time this kind of self-talk slowly\ndevelops into a sustainable self-love\nnotice again that we're not catering to\nour egos with hyperbolic positive\nlanguage all this does is reinforce the\nfragile narcissistic self that is the\nsteward of the Wounded self-loathing\nself in reality these two are two sides\nof the same coin which means that\nstrengthening one will actually only\nserve to strengthen the other\nwe're interested in grounding our\nself-worth in something real and active\nnot something illusory and reactive\nso resist the urge to assuage your pain\nwith love food that may taste sweet but\nis ultimately not nutritious\nnow if you stop the negative self-talk\nand you begin to speak positively to\nyourself in the sense of providing\naccurate Reflections on the good that\nyou do throughout the day\nthen you're actually pretty far along\nthe road towards loving yourself\nthe third thing that you can do to\naccelerate this process is to act in a\nway that you would find easier to love\nin someone else\nmy first video on this channel was\nentitled be the person you can love\nthe production values have improved\nsince then but the message is as good as\never\nhow are you going to love yourself if\nyou continue to act in unlovable ways\nlike it's much easier to love other\npeople when they're lovable isn't it\nwell it's theoretically possible to love\nanyone some people are much much harder\nto love than others\nthis could be because they are critical\nor unpredictable or unreliable or\nuntrustworthy or touchy or demanding Etc\nthese people are like the double black\ndiamonds of interpersonal relationships\nfor experts only\non the other hand\nit's easy to love people who are\nsupportive and even tempered and\nreliable and trustworthy and easy going\nand appreciative\nEtc\nand if it's easier to love people with\nthose qualities\nyou are not the exception\ndevelop those qualities in yourself and\nit will also be easier to love yourself\nand of course the less you criticize\nyourself and the more you accurately\nacknowledge the good that you do the\neasier it will be to develop these\nqualities which creates a virtuous cycle\nand like all virtuous Cycles this can be\nhard to get going you may have to put in\na lot of effort for longer than you\nanticipated before you see any\nappreciable movement it's kind of like\nmoving this enormous Rock You may have\nto expend an enormous effort to get it\nto budge an inch\nbut once that rock starts to move\nmomentum begins to kick in and further\nefforts see increasingly better results\nso if you follow these steps it still\nmight take a while before you begin to\nlove yourself however if it might take a\nwhile\nthen you may as well get started\nespecially given the fact that it will\nnever be easier than it is today\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso
