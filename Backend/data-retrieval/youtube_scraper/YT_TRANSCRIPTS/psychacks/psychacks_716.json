    "transcript": "hi this is Dr Orion taraban and this is\ncycats Better Living Through psychology\nand I'm really happy to be able to\npresent you today Mr Chaz Ellis Chaz is\nsomebody that I've personally been\nfollowing on YouTube for she's probably\nlike close to eight years now and uh he\nwas one of the first folks\nthat I followed on social media when I\nstarted to really do deep dives into\ndating psychology and\num attraction and understanding women I\nthink his work is really amazing he is\ndown to earth his work is very\naccessible and I think it's based on his\nlived experience it's very real and I\nthink it's also very balanced because\ncorrect me if I'm wrong Chaz you have\nlike the guys Channel which I think\nas the name suggests the audience is\nprimarily men but I think you also have\na channel that's uh it's our audience is\nprimarily composed of women and you do a\nlot of consultations with with women as\nwell correct right absolutely so you've\ngot a few different irons in the fire\nand I'm really happy to have you here\ntoday chess thanks for accepting the\ninvitation\nhey thanks for having me\nso when we spoke a few months ago you\ntold me that you were currently in the\nDominican Republic you want to tell yep\nwhy you happen to be there\num well one of the things I'm working on\nright now is a documentary where I'm\nbasically talking about people who are\ntraveling to different countries men and\nwomen actually who are traveling to\ndifferent countries\num you know just trying to find love uh\nin a way that's I guess you know\na little unconventional but um you know\nnothing that's designed I know a lot of\nstuff's out there that's demonizing\npeople for doing it or making it seem\nlike it's a it's um\nthat there's just nothing in America but\nI just want to see exactly why people\nare doing it and what's making them do\nit and what they're in and who has\ndifferent motivations so that's kind of\nwhat I'm doing now is interviewing\ndifferent people checking out the\nculture I'm in the Dominican Republic\nright now I'm gonna travel to some other\nplaces also and do the same thing\nabsolutely I think the term that I know\nfor that phenomenon is Geo Arbitrage\nwith respect to dating so like going\naround to different markets where you\nmight have let's say a higher sexual\nMarketplace value than you do right\naround your home\num so my understanding is that unless\nwe're leaving aside kind of like the\nmail order bride phenomenon where women\nare just sort of like going on these\nsites and and hoping for usually men in\nthe west to kind of wife them up that\ntraveling for the sexual Marketplace\nvalue was really something that men were\ndoing like the passport Bros and that\nkind of phenomenon but you said that\nwomen are doing it too\nman uh yeah I've seen it actually yeah\naround here too uh a lot of times\nsomething gets popularized like passport\nBros and it becomes like uh a thing\nwhere people believe that that's the\nonly thing that's happening there are\nactually a lot of women they're not\ncalling themselves passports citizens or\nor whatever man I called themselves\nanything they don't have a name for it\nyet but there's a lot of women that\nactually going to different countries\ntoo in the Dominican Republic is one of\nthem I don't know if you ever watched\nthe show like 90 Day Fiance or any of\nthat where people are on K1 visas you\nknow uh to come over to the United\nStates uh so it kind of goes both ways\nand there are definitely women there\ndoing it too\nand what have you discovered so far\nfrom your time in the Dr\nwell what I discovered here is\nand then I think it's one of those\nthings where\nthere are cultural differences anywhere\nyou go but people are generally the same\nbut there are cultural differences and\npeople who are looking for a specific\nthing a lot of times really what they're\nlooking for to be honest is to get the\nmost bang for their buck\na lot of people are saying hey here's\nwhat I've accomplished in my life here's\nwhere I am\num whether it's financially socially\num or whatever level that I've been able\nto improve myself and I think that I\nmight be able to get a little more of\nthat more for that if I'm somewhere\nother than the United States this which\nis a market that's saturated with meat\nyou know if you are an American person\nthe market in America is saturated with\nyou you know just whatever you've\naccomplished still there's going to be\nmore of you there than there are in\nanother country so I just\nI hear what you're saying I imagine that\nhow much of that do you think is just\nlet's say the exoticism of dating\nsomebody other versus like I'm sure that\nthey have like specific values\nAmericans have specific values that\naren't as dominant in other cultures\nthat are actually\num highly valued by like a portion of\nthat dating population\nI think uh\nin some cases that's that's going to be\nthat's going to be true but yeah I think\nin some cases that's going to be true uh\nwhat I've noticed is it really just\ndepends on where you date a lot of times\nwhen you're in America you just try to\ndate parallel\nuh to where you are socioeconomically\num to where you are in terms of your\nreligion to where you are just in terms\nof your political views everything is\nlike try to be the exact same um for the\nmost part and when people go to\ndifferent countries especially if they\ncome here I notice that people the\npeople that I've talked to even that\nhave broadened their Horizons\nso yeah they are like you said they are\ngetting different values I don't know if\nthat's just because they're in the\nDominican Republic or they went to\nThailand or somewhere like that I don't\nknow if it's just that or if it's the\nfact that they're dating people who are\ntotally different than the people that\nthey've dated in the past are different\nthan themselves even well we hear a lot\num I mean almost every dating coach is\nsaying that you should date for shared\nvalues like you should find somebody who\nbelieves kind of the things that you do\nand that's the recipe for Going the\nDistance and it sounds like one of the\nthings that you're saying is that\nwhether we're aware of it or not one of\nthe values that Americans tend to have\nis equality and that might not be a\nvalue that is as\num valuable in other parts of the world\nwhere they have let's say more they\nmight be more comfortable with more\nunequal relationships is that part of\nwhat you're saying I've seen that in\nquite quite a bit around here where it\nis a thing like Americans like you said\nfor sure most of the time Americans do\nhave some sense of a need for equality\nin their relationships\nunfortunately with that usually leaves\nis a void somewhere because two people\nare trying to bring the same thing to a\nsituation it's like we're going to sit\ndown and eat and you go I got peanut\nbutter and jelly\nyou know you you come with peanut butter\nand jelly and you say what do you got\nand I go I got peanut butter and jelly\nalso yes we have both brought equal\nparts to the situation but I didn't\nbring what you needed if I had bread\nwe'd be in shape now now we can eat but\nwe both have peanut butter and jelly we\nreally don't need each other yeah so\nyeah I made a video about this that\nbasically describes that inequality is\nthe basis of relationship because\num we can't really do business when I go\nto a cafe the reason why we can actually\ndo something with each other is because\nI want that cup of coffee more than I\nwant my three dollars and they want my\nthree dollars more than they want 12\nounces of their coffee and that's how we\ncan actually do business with each other\nright\nso complementarity\num okay now is it is it really that much\nbetter or is that just sort of like the\nfantasy that frustrated men and women\nhave when they are out of luck in um in\nAmerica dating around\nwell yeah I think whenever something\nhappens you change\nwhen when you change your environment\noftentimes you change your outlook\nyou could take somebody who comes from a\ntotally different country to the United\nStates of America and most of the time\nthey see it as a place of opportunities\nmilk and honey uh the the greatest place\non Earth if you will then you have\npeople who've been living there their\nwhole lives and they feel like it's not\nreally that you know because\nif you've been somewhere your entire\nlife everything's not new and fresh to\nyou so when people come to another\ncountry to date the people are new\nthe the\num the different situations they find\nthemselves in are new they don't think\nthey know everything about people they\ndon't think they know everything about\ndating most of the time when you go out\non a date and say you're 30 even just\nyou're just 30 years old once you you've\nbeen alive for 30 years in the same\nplace you've dated people in the same\nplace for probably at least 15 of those\nyears and because of that most of the\ntime you really think you know exactly\nwhat's going to happen on that date with\nthat person's intentions are\num you're taking even little small\nthings that happen on the day and\ndeciding certain things about them\num even before you get to the day you're\ntaking little small things in deciding\nyou know oh this would be the outcome if\nwe ever had a relationship that's what\nmost people do and that's because you\nknow\nbecause the environment is old when you\ncome to a new environment a lot of times\nyou don't speak the language so you're\ntrying to figure things out in in that\nyou're open\nto the situation and you're open to new\nthings you're open to new experiences so\nit's a it's better because you're a\nbetter you in a better version of you so\nit's almost like what you're saying is\nthat when people already assume that\nthey know how this is going to go they\nkind of don't pay as much attention they\nstop looking or they feel that when they\nsee little signals of something they\ninappropriately conceptualize how the\nfuture is going to go based on a limited\nsubset of information but because those\nsymbols make sense within that culture\nand if they go to a different culture\nthe same behavior might not have the\nsame meaning and so they kind of have to\nsurrender their assumptions and kind of\nget curious and pay more attention and\nand that in and of itself can make other\npeople more attractive is that is that\npart of what you're saying\num for sure absolutely I think that a\nlot of times what happens is like you\nsaid\num just following up on it um when you\nalready think certain things are going\nto happen\nthe attraction just cuts off because one\nlittle thing might have happened that\nyou've seen two or three different times\nin dealing with people like for instance\nyou might have been trying to talk to\nthe person and maybe they didn't they\ndidn't look directly at you when you\nwere trying to talk to them or maybe you\ndidn't make eye contact immediately but\nwhen you come somewhere else that you've\nnever been before you're like is that a\ncultural thing or is this something that\nmaybe they're\num you know with I don't even really\nknow what the cues are to whether or not\nsomebody likes me in this place because\nit's different from what I'm used to and\nsometimes you get you pay attention to\nthe individual\na lot more because you haven't grouped\nthem in so you are able to become more\nattractive you're able to to stop\nputting up some of the barriers that you\nuse to to fence yourself in and also you\ndon't have as much input from other\npeople most people whenever they date\nthey also have friends that input family\nmembers the input but when you come to a\nwhole nother country\nand those people aren't really this as\navailable to you then you don't get as\nmuch of the negative feedback\nI hear that I I there's been some videos\ngoing around lately that talk about\nwomen's committees and that seems to be\nmore of a phenomenon with women than men\nwhere they kind of make group decisions\nabout the boyfriend\num it happens quite a bit yes yeah\nthat's interesting and these things that\nyou're talking about with like eye\ncontact in Psychology we call those\nproxemics and it's all of these\ndifferent dimensions of intangible human\nbehavior that influence how we think\nabout ourselves and other people that\nmost people just take for granted like\nthe the distance that we comfortably\nstand\num away from each other very\nsignificantly from culture to culture\nand can be a sign of like disrespect or\ninappropriate intimacy if you're not\nfamiliar with that um that cultural\ntheme basically really interesting\nso um that said\nthat is it fair to say that there must\nbe something that is driving the\ndissatisfaction in Americans both men\nand women to look elsewhere and if\nthat's fair like what are you noticing\nwhen you've talked to hundreds if not\nthousands of men and women uh what are\ntheir common dissatisfactions\num yeah like you said I've been doing\nthis for 10 years so I've talked to\nthousands and thousands of people\nand the dissatisfactions are usually\nsimilar for both people they just for\nboth sexes but they just think that it's\nonly each one thinks that they're the\nonly one dealing with the problem but\nfor most people it's um\njust\nbeing unclear\nand not understanding what the other\ngroup wants from them so if you got a\nguy who's trying to date a young lady\nmost of the time he finds himself in a\nsituation where he's most frustrated by\nthe fact that he doesn't feel that her\nintentions are clear to him what does\nthis person actually want from me\nwhat am I supposed to do to fight to be\nattractive to this person what am I\nsupposed to do to be the person that\nthey would Envision themselves with and\nfor most people they feel like the bar\nis just too high\nor or invisible and high\nuh you know I don't even know what to\naim for because the bar is invisible I\ndon't even what am I supposed to be able\nto to do in this situation to make you\nbe attracted to me or treat me in a\ncertain way and how do I know when\nyou're not\nso most people become very\ndisenchanted as they date years and\nyears and years they become in women are\nare similar because they're like okay I\nknow it may not take very much for you\nto want to sleep with me but what does\nit take for you to actually want to be\nin a real committed relationship with me\nwhere you go forward with me\num and I actually have a certain\nsecurity to know that we're going to be\ntogether for the for the duration of Our\nLives even and most women feel like I\ndon't know\nwhere though what what those signs are I\nhave no clue so when people deal with in\nthe United States and what causes them\nto want to go elsewhere is they want to\nbelieve that there is a world that's\nbasically trapped in a set in a\nin a time capsule\nsomewhere there's a world that's trapped\nin a time capsule that I've heard of\nthat you know 1950 1955\n1918 even there's some world that's\ntrapped in its time capsule where\neverything made sense and where people\nwere honest and real and uh the I I knew\nexactly what I needed to do in order to\nattract someone and for them to to be\ninto me and want to be with me but and I\nthink that's why people want to leave\nAmerica because it just they feel like\nit's so complicated there's got to be\nsomewhere else where it's simple and do\nyou think that's true\nno\nno I think it's complicated because I I\nknow in some of your videos that I've\nseen you speak on the idea of like the\n1950s is kind of a myth that it's been\nromanticized so maybe it's like a false\ncomparison that there was this time this\nfairy tale time where men were men and\nwomen were women and everyone kind of\nknew their roles and things were used in\nrelationships lasted forever and so\nmaybe that's part of it or is it also\nthat the confusion about gender and\npower and sex and all it's like trickled\nin everywhere is it both and kind of\nsituation I think it's I think it's both\nin I think what's what's happened is\nthat people have a myth of a time going\nby that may have been different in a lot\nof ways but it wasn't perfect\num and it wasn't perfect or better\nnecessarily for either group\num and I think that\nyou also have a situation yes where\npower dynamics have shifted\num people are in all kinds of different\nwalks of life now where they interact\nwith each other in totally different\nways and I think that's confusing for\nmost people and I think there's also\nthat mixed with\na a sense that everything should be\nperfect it's like man there is supposed\nto isn't there supposed to be some\nperfect life that I'm supposed to be\nable to attain in some kind of way\num some perfect relationship or\nsomething like that\nso the way that I heard you it seems\nlike in your experience both men and\nwomen there's kind of like two potential\nbig problems one is that they don't\nreally understand what the other side\nwants\nthat men are saying I don't really know\nwhat a woman wants in order to get her\nto sleep with me women are saying I\ndon't really know when a man wants to\nget him to commit to me\nand that suggests to me that in most men\nand women let's say are good faith\nactors like they they want to be able to\ngive the other person what they want in\norder to get what they want do you think\nthat that's fair\nI think most people actually are\ngood faith actors I do I think I think\nmost people not only I don't think men\neven just want to sleep with women I\nthink most men are looking for a woman\nwho would be in a real relationship with\nthem\num and reciprocate whatever love or\nemotional attention that they're willing\nto give out I think that that's how it\nis for most people but\npeople generally don't find themselves\nin a situation where they want to engage\nwith most people they want to engage in\ngenerally with a small group of people\nand who is into small people the small\ngroup of people are usually just\nwhatever people are the most physically\ndesirable and\num outgoing\nuh and sometimes financially secure also\nuh that those are the that small group\nof people\nis really like the um it's what\neverybody Compares when people talk\nabout women who play games\nor they talk about men who play games\nand men who don't want to commit most of\nthe time people talk about they're\ntalking about this small group of people\nwho have all of the options in the world\nand can do pretty much whatever they\nwant and they do whatever they want\nother people are just left on the\noutside of that in most cases because\nthey haven't really not only is it just\neven the physical thing because you can\nsee somebody named like oh this person\nthis is physically attractive as the\nnext but they have not really mastered\ndating\nin a way that someone doesn't Master\nsales or to say so the way someone\ndoesn't master acting or basketball or\nfootball or something like that yes they\nmay look\nphysically the same but they haven't\nmastered the techniques and because they\nhaven't they're in a situation where\nthey're at the mercy of those who have\nmen and women are in the same situation\nyou've kind of mastered how to get\ncertain things out of me that you want\nwithout getting very much in return I\nhaven't been able to do that thus when\nwe deal with each other I'm always\ngetting the raw end of the deal so I\nwhen I look at that I say well this is\nhow men treat women this is how women\ntreat pain when it's really\nthis is how these groups this group of\npeople is able are able to treat people\nokay so that's interesting because on\nthe one hand we see that maybe a problem\nthat people have both men and women is\nlike ignorance they don't know what the\nother person wants they don't know what\nthey have to be in order to to increase\ntheir chance of getting that but a big\nissue is that both men and women are\nseeking\nuh relationships of all kinds from most\nattractive subset of the opposite sex in\nheterosexual Dynamics and those folks\num\nare almost like they're priced out of\ntheir their league\nin the sense of maybe I know what it's\ngoing to take in order to get into a\nrelationship the issue is not here\nignorance it's just too rich for my\nblood that in order for let's say a\nwoman to secure commitment from a guy\nwho's got lots of options\nwell I I mean\nfor him to be able to give up not only\nthe the Dozen women that he's talking to\nand all the\nmaybe hundreds of women that he might\nhave in the future I mean who who Could\nThat Woman possibly be like the the\nvalue of her ex of his exclusivity is so\nmuch higher than anything that she could\npotentially offer and and maybe that's\nwhy people are going to other cultures\nis because\nMaybe\nwhat they're attracted to isn't like the\ntop 10 percent here but maybe they could\nbe attracted to something that's\nlower than the top 10 percent in a\ndifferent culture and so they don't have\nthat that problem do you think that's\nthat's part of this\nyeah yeah I think sometimes it's\ndefinitely part of it and I think people\nare willing to change like expect let's\nlet's talk about women for and then\nwe'll go to men also for women a lot of\ntimes if they come over and like say\nthey come to the Dominican Republic or\nsomething like that a lot of times\nthey'll they'll snatch out the part of\nthis of the scenario that made it the\nmost difficult so for instance they'll\nsay in America they might say I need\nsomebody who makes six figures and looks\nlike this and has this type of\npersonality that's outgoing bubbly or\nwhatever\num and you know all these different\nthings but they might come to the\nDominican Republic and say\nI want somebody who has all of those\nother attributes but since they don't\nmake as much money you know the the\nexchange rate is different here it's the\nthe money's not here necessarily I'll\ntake somebody who doesn't make that much\nmoney well when you take that out of the\nequation\nand you have money or you're doing\npretty well financially well\nthat now now all of a sudden the world\njust opens up and you got so many\noptions that you didn't have in the past\num you know now obviously there's always\ngoing to be different things that go\nwith that but the options are now there\nwill you take go ahead well let me talk\nabout this for a second because I wonder\nwhy it would be necessary for women to\nactually like leave the country in order\nto let's say reduce their criteria now I\nwe can understand that women have let's\nsay their highest sexual Marketplace\nvalue all other things being equal when\nthey're young like according to uh\nTinder experiment that I talked about on\none of my channels uh women meet their\nPeak reach their Peak sexual Marketplace\nvalue at 23 according to men and men\nreach their Peak Mark sexual Marketplace\nvalue at 50 according to women so\nthere's a huge gap between that so women\nare most attractive to men at 23 which\nwe could say that's when they can\ncommand the best offer that's when they\ncan be most picky most demanding and\nhave the most criteria with the hope\nthat they might actually be satisfied\nbut a lot of the experience that I have\nboth dating personally and the guys that\nI speak to is that they're sometimes\ndealing with women who are\nthey're they're 38 now and it seems like\nthey still have the same criteria that\nthey did when they were 23. and that\ndoesn't make a lot of sense like if\nthey're willing to reduce\nuh you know throughout the criteria\nabout making a six-figure income just\nbecause they're going to the Dominican\nRepublic why why do you think women\nwouldn't consider doing that\nearlier like from a game theory\nperspective it makes sense\nas if I were a woman to like set my\nstandards like almost impossibly high\nwhen I was 18 and then let's just like\ncontinue to reduce them until I could\nget like the best possible\num secure commitment why don't women do\nthat why do they seem not to do that\nwell\nI think there's a yeah that's a good\nquestion I think is a couple different\nparts that I'm gonna try my best with it\num as far as leaving the country there's\na few different pieces to that when\npeople leave a lot of times women leave\nthey leave the scrutiny of their friends\nand family members um\num there's also\num\nI don't want to say\nI don't want to say it's false\nbut there's a um\nthere's a stigma on\non not even poverty there's a stigma on\neven median income in America\nthat Americans don't have for people who\ndon't live in America\nso if you live in America and you make\nforty thousand dollars a year that's not\nbad it's not like you're just poor and\nyou don't have anything you can't\nsupport yourself but in America people\nwill look at that like oh well you know\nI don't want somebody who's making forty\nthousand dollars a year but they would\ngo to another country and the stigma\nwould be off it's like oh well you might\nbe making\num\n1500 pesos a week and I'll I'm cool with\nthat you know because because I'm not\nexpecting you to have so much\nnow I'm gonna I'm gonna try to go back\nto what you were talking about as far as\nthe going going down in terms of um\nwhat they're looking for I'm just going\nto be totally honest this might not be a\npopular opinion to anyone but when I\nlook at dating strategies if you took\ntake morals of any kind out of it\nand take just say what is the what would\nbe the best strategy\nfor a woman\nin order to produce what she's really\ntrying to produce let's go back to just\nstraight just animal thought process\nright to get what to get what you're\ntrying to get out of a situation the\nbest thing she could do would be\nwhat do they call it um Alpha flux beta\nbooks\nuh go have\nget pregnant by the person with the best\ngenetics that you possibly can because\nthat's the kid you're gonna have and\nthen get somebody else with medium to\nwhatever genetics they might have to\nhelp you financially support that child\nget as much as you can out of them in\nterms of resources then take those\nresources once your child grows up and\ngo back out into the world and then be\nable to enjoy the physical presence of\nthe best looking most attractive and\nmost pleasing people\nI mean if you just did imagine what\nwould be\nwhich would require her to divorce the\nbeta right so for security absolutely\nthat's why you see so many divorces um\ninitiated by women I mean if you really\nthink about it makes perfect sense we've\ntalked about this privately it's like if\nwe are being stone cold just trying to\nmake the optimal moves within this the\ngame in terms of like the the the\nbenefits and the liabilities it's like\nyeah that that makes a lot of sense a\nlot of um what I talk about is\na lot of human behavior is determined by\nthe systems of reward and Punishment in\nwhich they operate and I think that's\npart of what I hear that men are looking\nfor outside of America is that they\ndon't have to date within the system of\nincentives that actually motivate that\nkind of behavior which is I would say is\nnot what most men are looking for right\nmaybe the alpha who just wants to have\nfun\num I don't know if he necessarily wants\nto reproduce because that could put him\non the hook for certain things\num right but yeah I think that's why a\nlot of\nmen are\nbelieving that they could find better\noptions elsewhere because the system of\nmarriage and the incentives around\ndivorce may not be as prevalent or as\nstrong I mean I don't know what it's\nlike in the Dr but I doubt that they're\ngetting you know alimony for the rest of\ntheir lives is that is that the fact\nI'm not for sure but I don't think so no\nI don't think so actually it's hard a\nlot of these different countries that\nI've been to it's a little harder that\nare not in the western world they're not\nin the western world it's a little more\ndifficult for women to be able to secure\na lot of the things that um you can\nsecure in the west where you can marry\nsomebody you can get alimony for life\num you could get half of all not even\njust have you can get all of their\nproperty you can get most of their bank\naccounts\num that's just in it's not as easy to do\naround here you know just\nit's not it's just not as easy they\ndon't even have the same lawsuit culture\naround here that they do in the United\nStates we see that and and that can help\nexplain why divorce is so prevalent and\nwhy the vast majority of divorces are\ninitiated by women is that they're\nactually seeing the game kind of clearly\nand they're just being cold-blooded\nabout maximizing their play Within that\nsystem\nbut we know that all women don't do that\nand so let's go back to the idea that\nmaybe part of what allows women to\nactually get what they want more\nfrequently outside of America is the\nabsence of the social pressure to behave\nin a certain way or to conform\nyeah sure there are two other ways that\num and I think this particularly impacts\nwomen\nthat I've encountered both in my\npersonal life and in my clinical\npractice one is\num the doctrine of feminism\nwhich is particularly difficult\num for I think young women I've in my\n20s when I was dating women in my 20s\neven 20 years ago uh I dated some women\nwho were like ideologically opposed to\nthe idea of actually getting in a\ncommitted relationship with me even\nthough it was something that I wanted\nbecause they had these ideas about uh\nlike these kinds of relationships are\nbased on patriarchal ownership and she\ndoesn't want to like settle down because\nthat is an abdication of her sexual\nLiberation I mean that happened more\nthan once to me and I think that that\nis something that a lot of those women\ngrow out of in their 30s but it's often\nI wouldn't say too late but they've\nthey've sort of given a lot of time over\nto that ideology so that's one and the\nother one that I think really impacts\nthe dating scene is the idea of like the\nSuperwoman or the girl boss that she can\ndo everything that she has the um the\nhigh-powered job and she can have the\nhusband and kids and\num\nthat that\nuh that letting go of any of those\ncriteria is on some level a\nmission that she couldn't hack it that\nshe didn't have the right stuff to be\nlike the super Wonder Woman does that\nmake sense right yeah absolutely\nwell I think it kind of boils down to\nthe fact that\nin in I work with women all the time so\nI'm not anti-women in any way shape or\nform I tell them this to their face uh\nthe reality is\nfeminism\nthe world of feminism\nis the playground for the [ __ ] boy if\nyou want to call them you know without\nany real judgment you know that's what\nthey say so\nyou tell me the biggest losers the\nbiggest losers in feminism are women\nthey've actually lost more than anyone\nand and here's why I say that\nbecause\nin reality nobody really wants to work\nlike nobody really wants to work a job\nyou know people want money sure people\nwant the trappings of success people\nwant some level of Independence and\nself-determination but nobody wants to\ncome and punch a clock and work every\nday nobody wants to do that so what\nwomen have been sold\nis that you come to work at this job\nyou're going to be a boss like you said\nor you know you get an education and you\nget take on a lot of student loan debt\num you're gonna and then at the end of\nthe rainbow you're gonna be a boss\nyou're gonna be a particular guy and you\nguys are going to become a Power couple\nwhere you know you go get some other\nmulti-millionaire and y'all build this\nempire together and you're you're\nbasically like Oprah and they're like\num Obama or something or whatever you\nwant to you know I over and who no one\nknows who Oprah's partnered with you\nknow what I'm saying yeah you're Oprah\nand you're not but he's not Steadman\nyou're Oprah and male Oprah you know I'm\nsaying so that's the that's kind of what\nwomen were sold for the most part and\nthe reality of that is if you're in\nthat\n10\nto one percent that's able to be able to\naccomplish a lot of the things\nthen as far as your life is concerned\nit's going to be pretty good yeah you\nmight feel a little upset about the fact\nthat you may not be able to find the guy\nthat you're looking for necessarily but\nyou still have the opportunity to go\nsomewhere else and hook up in the same\nway that some of these guys do but\nmost women are never going to end up Dr\nlawyer\nOprah\num uh actress famous you know or some of\nthese influencers even where it's like\noh I got millions and millions of\nfollowers and everybody thinks I'm the\nmost beautiful thing in the world and I\ngot fans most women are never going to\nexperience that it's just not realistic\nmost people are going to be secretaries\nuh LPNs\num you know this is you know these are\ndecent jobs not saying they're not but\nit's not going to be the Glamorous boss\nlife that you were sold and then what\nyou're going to be left with in most\ncases is also struggling to even find\nthe equivalent of yourself in a man\nso now you're not going to have those\ntwo incomes together to be able to\ncreate a better life because when you're\nyoung you don't want it\nwhen you get older a lot of times\nI don't want to say you've aged out of\nit because it's not really true but\nit's made a lot more difficult it's not\nas easy as it was when you were 23 when\nyou were 22. it's just not\nunfortunately that's what happens a lot\nof times like\nthings don't turn out the way you\nthought it would yeah you're when people\nthink about feminism they think about\nthe top\nyeah I'm gonna be a boss I'm gonna be\nthe CEO of Facebook but\nfor most people it's like nah you're\nmore likely to be like maybe an\nassistant manager at a grocery store or\nsomething like that that's real well\nthat's that's interesting a couple\nthings I want to say about that\num my advice to women especially young\nwomen is that they if they really do\nwant to be everything if they want to be\nthe successful corporate Warrior and\nthey want to have the the husband and\nthe kids why don't they do the husband\nand kids part first\nlike absolutely like get that locked in\nin their 20s when they have the best\npossible chances of attracting the best\npossible man because they're at their\nPeak sexual Marketplace value and if\nthey feel like they're missing out they\ncould become an employee in their 30s if\nthey really want to but most women are\ntrading their 20s which is when they are\nat their their Peak\num and able to let's say negotiate the\nbest deal for themselves for us a salary\nwhich uh you could potentially get at\nany stage in their life but it's much\nmuch harder to get\num that that kind of commitment at other\nstages\nbut here's the thing\nwell another thing I wanted to say is\num\nI hear what you're saying but I I don't\nknow if it's really going to change\nanything and you know that I used to be\nan actor I know you've done some acting\ntoo I'm sure at some point someone said\nto me Orion you know that 99.9 percent\nof actors don't make it it's a really\ntough profession\nbut that doesn't stop millions of people\nfrom shooting their shot because\neveryone secretly thinks that they have\nwhat it takes to be that top point one\npercent\nand it's just like a question of when\nyou realize that you're not in that you\nknow that very small band can you get\nout with acceptable loss on some level\nbut yeah I think everyone secretly\nbelieves that they're going to be the\nCEO that they're going to be the movie\nstar that they're going to be the\nathlete until sometimes it's tragically\ntoo late\nbut well I think that's\nwhat you were saying there I think the\nproblem with that for most people like\nyou you were saying most people aren't\ngoing to believe that and I understand\nthat completely but I think what people\noften don't do is ask themselves the\nquestion what is it that you actually\nwant from life\na lot of women that I talked to over the\nyears\nthey they are people who are in the team\nin the one percent they actually made it\nthey are the success story this is the\nbest that story is going to ever get\nyou know they made millions of dollars\nso I was like okay if you can make\nmillions if you make two or three\nmillion 10 million ain't gonna change\nyour life that much just reality of it\nso there are people who I have worked\nwith over the years who have made\nMillions and they are in that they're\nthey're the success story but for a lot\nof them\nthey they're they're saying you know\nwhat\nthe problem with this is these successes\nthat I've been able to accomplish\ndon't get me what I actually want I\nwanted the power couple where I was with\na guy and he's basically what I am\nbut unfortunately the two three million\nthat I got\nthe you know 500 000 I make a year or\nsomething like that whatever I'm making\nfor whatever reason my credentials just\nare not adding up to me being in a\nsituation where I can get the my\nequivalent my male equivalent I'm in a\nsituation where\nOprah is with Stedman\nyou know what I'm saying Oprah is not\nwith LeBron or Michael Jordan or\nsomebody you know like do that you know\nit's like it it doesn't she's not with\nTom Cruise or something it doesn't work\nthat way most of the time so\nwell yeah that's another thing I wanted\nto say which is well let's focus on\nthese top 10 percent of women who under\nfeminism they are very successful\ncertainly by let's say traditionally\nmale standards or our society standards\nand making a lot of money they have sure\nuh Advanced degrees they own their asses\num\nI mean I'm sure you're aware of\nhypergamy where women tend to mate and\ndate\nacross and up generally up sure they at\nthat stage they generally want guys to\nhave even more than they do and that's\nobviously a very small pool and those\nmen because of what women tend to be\nattracted to have insane optionality\nlike ridiculous guys aren't going to\nlook at a woman and be like damn look at\nher bank account man look at her\nmaster's degree it's actually not\nespecially now guys who are already rich\nsure because it's like that whole thing\nuh you know I already got money so what\ndo I need your money for\num we become sort of irrelevant and this\nis something I want to talk to you about\nwhich is how do people like price\nthemselves out of relationships do you\nsee that happening\num yeah because what often happens with\npeople okay first of all most people who\nhave quote-unquote standards\nnormally it's just a list of everything\ngood right so they don't really think\nabout what their life would be with any\nparticular person they just think about\na list of all the good things that there\nare in life and they say this is my\nabsolute bare minimum that I'm willing\nto accept all the things that put you at\nthe top\n0.001 of people\num not even one percent is now you're\njust in a some decimal point somewhere\nso with most people so what people would\ndo is they'll have that in their mind\nand then they'll have their own life\nand they take almost all of their time\nlike and we're talking about women too\nwomen we're talking about women really\nright now what they'll do is they'll\ntake their entire lives and they'll work\nfor certain things okay I want to get my\ndegree\nI want to get my business going or my\ncareer whatever and I want to get to\nthis certain level well those things\ntake time so while those things are\ntaking time\na lot of times fertility is dropping\nphysical attributes are dropping I mean\nit's very hard to compete with the 20\nyear old version of yourself when you're\nin your mid to late 30s that's hard\num and the same thing happens to me but\nthere's one caveat one thing that\nchanges everything\nwhen a man usually gets to that point\nand he's in his like it said what um the\nmen 50 was their highest uh sexual\nmarket value according to women and\ntheir swiping Behavior okay so you got\nthis guy who's 50 years old\nhe says\nI'm 50 years old\nwhat I want is now at 45 50 somewhere I\nmay want to have a family which I'm\nstill capable of doing if I'm in\nreasonably good health I want to have\num\nI want to have people around me I want\nto have a woman that's going to support\nme love me that I can talk to that's\ngoing to respect me in a certain way\nfinances never came into what he was\ntalking about\nand what has he gotten over the years\ninfluence\nFinance wisdom\nand most of the time for that man and if\nhe stayed in reasonable shape\nhe has some level of physical attraction\nthat he can get with a woman and he also\nhas things that no 20 year old were\nbeing reasonable now no 20 year old is\nable to accomplish you don't have 50\nyear old knowledge at 20. you don't have\nit you have way more knowledge right now\nthan you did when you were 20 years old\ncertainly so you cannot match 50 year\nold knowledge at 20. I know some 20 year\nolds think they can but that's not\nrealistic you cannot match\n50 year old money from somebody who's\nbeen working to build their empire\nyou can't even match 50 year old car\ninsurance rates at 20 years old you\ncan't do it especially if you're a guy\nthis is that not possible so because\nyou're not able to do these things that\nmeans that the 50 year old man is able\nto compete with a 20 year old man or a\n21 or 25 year old man on a curve\nthat favors him\nyeah I I'm young and vibrant and maybe\nlook a little better\nI got a yacht\ndamn\nI can get to the part of the party that\nthey will not let you into\nyou're not allowed in\nI'm over here in a section with my own\ntable and all this stuff and I'm\nordering bottles you could not even get\nhere because the bouncers are males and\nthey won't let you in because they're\nnot because you look good it's not\nhappening so then you take women on the\nhit on the flip side of that they can\naccomplish all the things that they want\nto accomplish but the problem that they\nrun into is they still want the same\nthings the woman who is\nFortune 500 millions of dollars in the\nbank normally wants the exact same\nthings as a girl who's on fries at\nMcDonald's\nthe 20 year old his own fries you know\ntrying to make a way I'm looking for\nsomebody who's financially stable I'm\nlooking for somebody who um has wisdom\nsomebody who's able to teach me and\ndirect me well a lot a lot of times the\nCEO is looking for the same thing I want\na mentor I want somebody who's even\nsmarter than me\nwhat are the chances of that let me\nlet's break this down a little bit\nbecause I think there's a lot of Truth\nto what you're saying Chaz but there's\nsomething that I've run up against and\nI've done some a lot of consultations\nwith older guys and they they struggle\nwith this too which is that all things\nbeing equal women want men who are\nhigher status who are wealthier who have\ntheir lifestyle\ntaken care of uh that have some wisdom\nthat have that kind of experience that\nthey can take charge and direct\num but what I've discovered is that it's\nnot like women are lining up for those\nmen and making it easy\nthat on some level a lot of guys that\ntalk to me are like I don't get it Orion\nI have the yacht and when I go out with\nwomen they say I don't care about a\nyacht\nit's not like they're they're just like\nmaybe if you're in the top Point what\nzero zero zero one percent of men in\nyour world famous the women are gonna be\nlike reading outside of your tour bus or\noutside of your hotel room\nto just sort of like strike up a\nconversation with you but there's plenty\nof really high value successful Men Who\nit's not like the women they still have\nto kind of like approach women and start\nfrom zero and to kind of like make them\nthink they're not serial killers and\nthat yeah they do have something to\noffer and right and oftentimes I don't\nknow if they're they're lying or they're\nnot aware of their selection biases but\na lot of women are like I don't I don't\nwant those things I don't want a yacht\nlike and and why do you think that just\nbecause you have a yacht and a lot of\nmoney that you uh like deserve or earn\naccess to me does that make sense yeah\nabsolutely I want to start here though\neverybody in the United States of\nAmerica wants a yacht\nthey're they're lying there they might\nbe lying to themselves nobody wants to\nbe poor especially not in America\nbecause\nAmerica is a totally different country\nif you're poor like it's totally\ndifferent you know well I've heard that\nthe next person's America and a poor\nperson America totally different\nI've heard that the best day in a boat\nowner's life is the day he buys the boat\nand the second best day is the day he\nsells it\nso absolutely I definitely can buy it\nI've heard that too okay so let's go\ninto what you were talking about here\nall right now\nhere's what I because I work with a lot\nof guys who are in the same situation\nyou were talking about they got all\ncontemplated and doing really well but\nhere's what normally happens\nthey say money changes you\nyou know people say ah Money Changes\npeople money money changes you well in a\nlot of cases when people get money\ndoesn't change them enough\nhahaha\ndoesn't change you fundamentally doesn't\nchange you internally like they said\npoverty meant or scarcity mentalities is\nthat what you scarcity mentality but\nthey also have they also care\nyou know what\nyou know what makes a guy be able to get\nwomen no matter what his situation is\nnot caring yeah complete indifference\ntowards because if you're a person and\nyou look at you really have an abundance\nmindset you're not thinking oh man I got\na yacht and I got a nice car and I got a\nnice house and I got all these things so\nthese women should line up to come date\nme\nyou're not really thinking about that\nbecause it's like well\nI yeah but there's other people who\nmight have those things too it doesn't\nthat doesn't matter I am the person who\nwas able to get this stuff\nme\nI have been able I didn't win the\nlottery and get it because there's not\nvery many lottery winners in the world\nso I didn't win the lottery and get it I\nwas actually able to accomplish things\nthat put me in a position to be where I\nam today\nand that is what I bring when you talk\nto me that should come out it should\nooze out of my pores that I feel like\nI'm that guy and some people feel like\nthey're that guy when they're in Middle\nSchool\nand from being in Middle School\nand feeling like they're that guy they\ndon't have any bitterness\nthey don't have any frustration remember\nI talked about earlier you have years of\ngoing through these things so you read\nsigns it's like the guy is talking about\noh she doesn't care about the yacht and\nall that kind of stuff how the hell do\nyou know that\nhow do you know that\nwell what I'm saying is that sometimes\nthey're out on dates and they report\nthat is that they're they're trying yeah\nthat's what I'm saying that's the women\nand they're saying here seriously I got\nthat and the women are like I don't know\nhow do you know\nhow do you know that they didn't want\nthe yacht what I'm saying is like when\nyou start going I got a yacht I got this\nI got that and all these kind of things\nthat you might try to tell women when\nyou meet them what you're you don't know\nif they don't care about the yacht or\nnot you the way you presented the yacht\nto them is normally the issue because\nyou go out here you go oh okay here let\nme show you not you I'm just talking\nabout people you talk to\num the they're going out here saying I\ngot the yacht I got the plane hey girl I\njust made this business deal and all\nthis kind of stuff and the woman might\nbe like you know what I would be\nextremely impressed with that if I found\nout about that on my home\nbut because you told me about the guy\nand you told me about all this you have\nnot triggered my Chase Instinct\num\nyou are the same dude that makes a big\nvalentine for a girl in the fifth or\nsixth grade and presented the tour and\ngoes hey pretty girl look what I made\nyou do you want it take this and with my\nheart take that also you get what I'm\nsaying a lot of these guys will get\nmoney and all that kind of stuff but you\nhave not changed internally to the point\nwhere when you meet somebody\nthe the idea that you could be gone in a\nin a blink of an eye or you make your\nfeelings are unclear\nbecause women are as we know Studies\nhave shown that women are attracted to\nguys whose feelings are unclear I can\ntell you that that's true because I work\nwith women day after day and I know who\nthey ask me about okay so when you come\ninto the situation oh I got a yacht well\nyou're telling me you're really\ninterested and you're telling your yacht\nis all you have to offer which is a lot\nbut you're telling her that you're\ntrying to offer it yeah in order for her\nto date you rather than being like yo\nI'm the type of person who gives you\nyachts so when I talk to you I'm talking\nabout me as a person I'm asking you\nabout you and if you don't seem vibing\nwith me and you don't seem interested\nthat doesn't bother me\nyou know because if you don't change\ninternally you're not going to get any\ndifferent results no matter how much\nmoney\nthe way I I think that's really well\nsaid Chaz um and I talk about these\nthings like yachts and uh sports cars as\na attraction proxies because I think a\nlot of guys believe that if they get\nthose things then that will solve their\nattraction problems right the only way\nto solve the attraction problem is by\nbehaving more attractively with women\nand I think this is a consequence of a\nfailure of most men to understand how\nfemale attraction works\nwhich is um I I think guys have this and\nit serves them well in a lot of contexts\nthey have this like really explicit\nproblem-solving mentality and it's\nalmost like okay I have a problem I want\nto get sex okay what do I have to do to\nget sex okay I have to go out I have to\nask them out uh I'll buy them a drink\nI'll take them to a restaurant I'll act\ninterested and then if I do all those\nthree things then I have like a 78.2\npercent chance that it will end in a\nsexual encounter at the end of the night\nright yeah absolutely and so they have\nthat with the dating and and they never\nreally grew out of that and they just\nkind of make the same mistake in a at a\nlarger and bigger magnitude because now\ninstead of just you know spending a few\nhours on a date buying drinks they're\nspending a decade of their life\nBuilding Wealth but they're really doing\nit to get the hater to get a\nrelationship just like they did when\nthey were broke and so do you think it's\nfair to say\nthat all things being equal a man will\nhave\num what do you think which man will have\ngreater optionality with women with\nrespect to sex and relationships the guy\nwho doesn't who's kind of broke or is\njust sort of like non-remarkable with\nrespect to his status and wealth but has\nlet's say game and understands how to\nhow to finesse and talk to women or a\nguy who's got all those things and still\nhas that kind of mentality that we\ndescribed\num yeah game game pretty much beats\neverything\nI'm curious why yeah okay you take them\nyou take a broke guy right\nI used to work in the jail as a guard\nand um I saw a phenomenon that was one\nof the most amazing things I saw guys\nwho were locked up in jail of all Races\nwith\na lot of times really good looking women\nwho had good careers\nand I was like this is at first I\nstarted haitially on the outside so they\nwere still like waiting the woman would\nbe on it yet\ncoming down giving a guy money visiting\nthe guy I mean some of these guys got so\nmuch money that's coming into them from\nsometimes three or four different women\num you know and these women paying these\nguys are custom girl out on the phone or\nwhatever you know and she'll still just\ncome down there and give her money and\nput money on his books visit I mean\nit's what they do you know and some of\nthese women they're not all the people\nthat you would go oh well she must be\nsome stupid unattractive no they're not\nall like that a lot of some of them are\na lot of them are but some of them are\nactually really attractive and they have\ngood careers\nand what I've learned by just watching\npeople and interacting and asking\nquestions is\nlike you said a lot of times when you're\nsuccessful it's because you've used an\nanalytical mind\nbut\nwe sometimes you can be more successful\nwith women and with relationships and\nhumans when you realize sometimes two\nplus two equals five\nwhat do you mean by that\nit doesn't always make sense\nthat it doesn't always have to make\nsense some when you're when you're\ndealing with a woman right and you're a\nperson who's like I'm really Analytical\nin the way that I think I'm really\nlogical in terms of my brain how do you\nsell something to somebody using logic\noh you don't that's why no one does they\nsell an idea they sell an emotion\nexactly\nno advertising like try our carbonated\nhigh fructose corn syrup because no\nthey're selling that it's Christmas you\nwouldn't buy it yeah you wouldn't buy it\nwho would buy fast food if they used a\nlogical selling point\nno they they show you the steam coming\noff the burger and everybody's having a\ngood time high five no fat people in\nsight and you're like oh man if I have\nthis burger on a subconscious level\nyou're like if I have this burger I'm\ngonna have a good time\nthat's what\na person who has game understands how to\nsell the experience not that I haven't\nyet I could be on your yacht and the\ngirl that's on your yacht I'm gonna make\nher feel like there's a spirit\nexperience is being provided by me\nand it's a part of our situation and our\ndating uh even though you're the person\nwho bought the yacht\nand people who have game are good enough\nat doing that whereas people who don't\ndevelop games like I'm going to develop\nmoney and that's going to take the place\nof game no because even when you get a\ngirl what is she gonna try to do\nseparate you from your money\nso uh\nhow do people learn game because I I\ndon't believe that\nthe vast majority of men are naturally\nconfident or that they inherently\nunderstand female psychology in this way\nand uh a lot of the advice that you hear\ncertainly in popular media and in our\nculture is almost like it's so wrong it\njust\nit leads it makes things worse\nso um how do people learn game\nnecessity is the mother of intention you\nknow was it Benjamin Franklin said they\nhelp me out I think it might have been\nnecessity's mother invention\nso um for most people what ends up\nhappening the way most people will\ndevelop game is the way same way most\npeople develop sales skills the same way\nmost people develop the Hustler\nmentality they have to\nnow some people try to skip the step by\ngetting money like over there they'll\nsay I'm not going to date until I get\nmoney so then they don't have any game\nthe way you develop game is when you're\non the way up especially and even if\nyou're already there take away some of\nwhat you have don't use it\ntalk to people\nstart learning how to actually have\nconversations with people and develop a\nrelationship out of thin air out of\nnothing\nhow do I go up to this person without\nall my fanciest clothes on how do I go\nup to this person without a\nthree hundred thousand dollar watch on\nmy wrist how do I go up the people even\npeople I'm not interested in on a\nphysical level how do I go up to people\nand just start developing relationships\nwith them they can be platonic\nrelationships they could just be\nacquaintances how do I go up to people\nand talk to them and have conversations\nand start understanding what people\nactually want\nwhat do people really want\nand what are they willing to do to get\nit\nwhen you that's what if you talk to a\nhustler or you talk to somebody that's\nlike a con person a con man con woman\nwhat they are good at is finding out\nwhat you want\nexactly what your truest desires are and\nwhen they figure out what you want all\nthey do is fill in for that\nwhat you really want like most people\nare saying oh well a woman wants to be\non a yacht why\nsee you bought a yacht because you saw\ngirls on a yacht why do they want to be\non a yacht\nyou got to figure that part out and\nprovide that with you and not just the\nyacht\nwhat make is it they're looking for the\nexperience they're looking for what they\nbelieve a yacht means\nthe status that a yacht provides the\nenjoyment the the stuff they saw in the\nvideo where everybody was popping\nchampagne and they just seemed like they\nwere having such a good time that's what\nthey want from that yeah most of them\ndon't really know what kind of yachty\nguy they don't know you know they'll\nhave much yacht information so would it\nbe fair to say that because I often say\nthis to my clients is that if it works\nin sales it works in dating and what is\nin common in both of those things is\nthat what really seems to be successful\nis the ability to cultivate an emotional\nexperience\nabsolutely that is can we say that\nthat's kind of game in a nutshell is the\nability to cultivate an emotional\nexperience absolutely absolutely and to\nmake that experience something that they\nfeel like they can't get anywhere else\num\nfor people who grew up in the 80s and\n90s that was the crack era right in the\n80s and 90s they had this like they had\nthese people that y'all probably some of\ny'all younger people may not even know\nabout crackheads but they would just be\njust really on you know just really\nafter it getting after it and with most\nof them\nmost of them it's not even necessarily\nthe chemical dependency as much as with\ntheir body and their mind is telling\nthem is that first high that you got\nyou're gonna your body tries to chase\nthat your mind tries to chase that you\nchased it on a spiritual level for the\nrest of your life they call that chasing\nthe dragon now because of that that that\nexperience that you want to get back\nover and over again even if you keep\ngetting a diminished version of it you\nkeep chasing it over and over again what\na lot of men don't understand when you\ngo out with women when you deal with\nwomen if you can create that experience\nand that feeling\nand tag and tap into something\nemotionally one time have you ever\nnoticed that women would date a guy who\nhas doesn't seem like he has anything to\noffer that you're like why do you keep\ngoing back to this dude well they're\nchasing the dragon\nthat dude\nhe [ __ ] her really good and that's\npart of why she she keeps coming back\nand that's certainly part of the uh well\nmaybe a small amount yeah a person it's\njust like what a girl okay but the worst\npiece of [ __ ] you ever have in your\nlife is still good\nbut how many guys do you know\nare chasing after a woman who hasn't\nslept with them in three four five six\nyears sometimes even more\nstill chasing still hoping man one day\nif I do this she'll come back one day if\nI do that she'll come back you might\neven look at the girls like she's not\neven really that attractive it probably\nwasn't even that good or that much\nbetter than the last woman but\nshe was somehow able to tap into an\nexperience an emotional connection that\nyou had and it hit all the factors in\nyour mind your body your spirit and\nbecause that happened you were going to\nchase that for as long as you possibly\ncan you're gonna you're chasing until\nyou have nothing left\nand what a lot of guys don't really\nunderstand it with guys who have game do\nunderstand I need to create an\nexperience and as many times as I can\ncreate that experience\nIt renews This Woman's attraction for me\nI don't need it to create it with money\nI don't need to create it by doing\nspectacular things that matter so much\nit's just I need to find out what makes\nthat woman tick and I need to create\nthat experience some guys created in a\nnegative way\nhow did they figure that out I imagine\nyou can't just ask directly because a\nlot of people actually don't know\nwhat what they really want do you think\nthat's true\nabsolutely is true well Utah okay the\nway um it's like um I actually sold cars\nin a couple of different items my father\nalways say this my father's the greatest\nsalesman I ever believe and he got the\nplaques and everything to prove it he\ntaught me a lot of stuff about sales and\none of the biggest things is\nto sell somebody something you got to\nreally listen\nnot just listen to what they tell you\nbut also listen to what they don't tell\nyou\nso when you look at somebody and you say\nyou get it say you get a life a nice\ngirl that you you find attractive you're\njust like what makes this girl tick I\ndon't understand this woman what is it\nthat I need to know about her that that\nthese are the things that make that\nmatter the most to her\nwell when you want to figure that out\nabout somebody\ndon't ask them what the most important\nthings are ask them about other things\nhey you know what's your favorite movie\nfigure out what movie they like to go\nsee do they like to go see romantic\ncomedies\nwell that means that they want a lot of\ntimes they want that up and down\nuh Boy Meets Girl boy loses girl love\nstory\num\nso a lot of times like if you watch a\nguy who likes Spider-Man\nokay he wants that story about the nerd\nwho\nmeets a girl that's the love of his life\nhe finally gets super powers you get\nwhat I'm saying you can tell a lot about\na guy by that\nso that basically kind of goes on the\npsychological premise of identification\nthat that's kind of how movies work and\nstories work\nidentified with certain characters and\nthat's easier to do than others and\nmaybe we identify\num almost wishfully like with the people\nthat we most want to be or would like\nmost to be and if we're good at kind of\nanalyzing those themes or that work we\ncan kind of reverse engineer a person's\nself-concept or or what their yeah\ndesire might be that's interesting\nbecause because what we normally what we\nnormally identify with the most is\nsomebody who is the closest to us\ntransformed into the best version of us\nhmm so when we watch a movie or a show\nor something like that it's normally\ngoing to be the thing like if you like\nlike look at Rocky\nRocky's not perfect Rocky's kind of slow\nwith\num doesn't talk very intelligently he's\npoor he's not doesn't have a great\nrecord as a fighter he's somebody who\nyou say wow this guy's you know he's\nkind of a loser he gets this opportunity\nthis chance\nout of nowhere where Apollo Creed says\nhey I'll fight you and\nthe transformation that Rocky takes he\nhas a he has a mentor and you got to\nlook and you gotta pay attention to\nevery piece of the story he has a mentor\nthat comes in and trains and changes him\ninto the person that could actually\nfight Apollo Creed and be successful\nenough to go down to the last second\nRocky loses in the end but Rocky becomes\nsomebody you can Empire\nthat wasn't very popular I mean clearly\nthere was a dozen sequels but I think he\nwins in every other movie it's almost\nlike people couldn't let the story end\nwith Rocky losing\nthat's that's another thing that people\ndon't think about when they think about\nrelationships why do a lot of women go\nback to a guy who doesn't call them why\nthey call over and over again it's the\nCliffhanger the story didn't win the way\nthat I want to people chase the happy\nending just like they did with Rocky\nthey knew when they made Rocky lose that\nfight that you would be so happy to go\nsee Rocky too\nthey knew it Rocky loses look at Rocky\nthree he loses the clever Lane the first\ntime Rocky's a fantastic movie in other\nrespects too Stallone I think wrote it\nin three days he just like got this\ninspiration he sat down and in a frenzy\nhe wrote the entire script by himself in\na long weekend\nand uh it was rejected by I think\nhundreds of uh producers because he\ninsisted that he played the part like a\nlot of people a few people expressed\ninterest in the script and he said no it\nhas to be me and so it's interesting\nbecause that was his his directorial and\nhis star debut too so it the real life\nstory of Rocky kind of parallels the uh\nthe The Narrative structure of Rocky\nwhich I think is fascinating right it's\nabout a guy named Chuck webner who's a\nwell you probably you know like uh\nSylvester Stallone was in the um was in\nthe audience when he was fighting\nMuhammad Ali so that's why Apollo\nCreed's character is so much like\nMuhammad Ali and webner was a was a\na mob collection guy\num he basically was he's basically Rocky\nhe's basically rocking Balboa\nthat's really interesting I've never\nthought of it that way as a means to\nkind of like indirectly\nuh analyze what a person might really\nwant\nthat's that's really interesting I wanna\nI wanna pivot one more um to one more\nDirection which is okay most guys don't\nhave game most guys don't even\nunderstand the importance of game\num but let's talk about something that\ncan happen once you become successful uh\nwith game it's almost like I think the\ncynicism that comes with being a\nsuccessful salesman like you because\nyou're an ad exec at Coke and make\nyou know billions of dollars for that\ncompany\nand feel rightly accomplished in your\nability to do so but at the same time I\ngotta believe in your heart of hearts\nyou're like I'm manipulating people into\nbuying carbonated sugar water\nyou know what I'm saying and it's like\nthe fit once you realize as a man what\nwomen actually respond to and what\ndramatically increases your chances of\nsex and relationships\nI think it can make a person cynical\num sure because a lot of the things that\nmen would like to be I think most men\nwould like to be honest and forthright\nand direct and\nuh let's say transparent and to show\nthey say hey I really like you and and\nto and to be that version of themselves\nthat doesn't usually work in the vast\nmajority of context and I think guys\nhave to struggle with this idea like I\nkind of have to be this version of\nmyself that I don't like as much\nor I have to be the version of my cycle\nlike more and and suffer the um the\nlower outcome rate associated with women\nI don't think that I don't think you\neven have to make a choice between the\ntwo\num you know one of the things is\nthere's multiple ways that you can do\nthe same thing like if you're a Salesman\nthere's a couple different types of\nsalesmen some people sell you by making\nyou feel like you know something's way\nbetter than it really is and some people\nsell you by selling you on their honesty\nand selling you on themselves you got to\nunderstand that there are going to be\npeople who respond to that just as much\nas they respond to whatever gamesmanship\nor whatever type of\num false narrative you might try to sell\nmost of the time if you're if you are\nsomebody who's accomplished enough that\nyou that that you've been able to do\nsome of the things you want to do with\nyour life and it doesn't even have to be\nmajor\num but if you if you feel good enough\nabout yourself you feel good about\nenough about the product that you're\nselling you don't really have to lie to\nanybody you just tapping you just tap\ninto the parts you just let that person\nknow what they want to buy\nsee this is the thing like if you're so\nif I was selling you a car\nand I sold cars for a long time if I'm\nselling you a car there's people who are\ntrying to make you want to buy a car and\nyou don't want to buy\nthose people will never get your family\nmembers to buy from them\nthey'll never get you to bring person\nafter person to them to where they don't\nreally have to do much work but you take\nsomebody who says I you tell me what you\nwant\nif we got it here I'm going to show you\nwhy this is this is it you may have all\nthe things like I said before people\nusually don't know what they want they\njust have a stack of things that are\ngood but what I'm gonna break down from\nyou is I'm gonna say what exactly is it\nthat you really want not just from what\nyou tell me but what I've observed from\nyou what you really want you want\nsomebody that's going to be as a mentor\nto you I can tell that by some of the\nlack of direction that you might have\nso if I know that I'm that type of\nperson anyway all I'm going to do is do\nmy actions and words I'm going to show\nyou how I met and create that experience\nof mentorship now you come back to me\nfor that over and over again if you're a\nperson that once\num to have an exciting time or you want\nsomebody that's going to protect you if\nI know that I'm that person anyway all\nI'm doing is showing you that this is\nwhat you're supposed to be buying the\nthe customer needs Direction\nI tell women this all the time\nthe the guy probably wants most of the\nthings that you have to offer\nwe know he wants at least one of those\nthings let's be real so why are you\nstruggling to sell him that the reason\nwhy because he doesn't you're not saying\nhere this is where it is this is what\nyou these are the things that I know you\nwant and it's right here\nwhen you deal with women if you if you\nfigure out what they actually want\nmost of the time you have a lot of the\nthings that they actually want maybe not\nthe stuff that's on that list it doesn't\nmatter like oh well I'm not six foot\nfive chairs and I don't make 600 million\ndollars a year and I don't have five\nJets well what did what do they actually\nwant why do they want to be on the yacht\nwhy do they want to be on the jet\nwhy if you start figuring out why and\nnot just the thing the metal in in the\nleather and all that if you figure out\nwhat it actually is that they want\nnobody really wants a burger\nfrom a fast food restaurant\nsomebody has a need\nthey don't want the cholesterol and all\nthe other stuff that goes along with it\nthey have a need and that restaurant\nshow them here's how you're going to\nfill this particular need\nso they don't necessarily need to be on\nit yeah they need all the things that\nthey feel go with that you may not have\nit yet\nbut you could say look I know you want\nto have a good time I know you want to\nfeel connected with your friends and you\nwant your friends to be jealous of you\nbecause you're doing something that they\ncan't do here's how I can provide that\nexperience even though I may not have a\nyacht even though I may not have any\nmoney to spend on you\nbut the shortcut for a lot of guys\nis money here I don't really know how to\ncreate any experience so I'm gonna go to\nmy bank account get a whole bunch of\nmoney out and throw it on top of you and\nthen hope that you're gonna that you're\ngonna like me\nokay well this has been a fascinating\nconversation\num we're nearing the end how about we\ntalk as a closing\nidea uh based on what we've been\ndiscussing of late like with game and\nsuccessful women what do you think might\nbe one of the easiest things that men\ncan begin to implement like today to\nmove the needle in the direction of\ngetting what they want from women\nthe easiest thing that you can Implement\ntoday without doing any other work is\njust go up and actually talk to people\nnot with an agenda not like oh I want to\nsmash tonight just go up and start\ntalking to strangers\nmen and women\nanybody you see on the street\ntalk to strangers once you start getting\nmore used to talking to people and\nlisten and actually start listening to\nwhat they want their hopes their dreams\nthat's going to make it easier for you\nto deal with any woman\nso not only because it would help you I\nimagine to overcome the approach anxiety\nof just striking up absolutely with um\nright but also gives you it also gives\nyou the cues to listen for\nwhen you're doing it you can listen so\nmuch more intently with somebody that\nyou're not\nphysically interested in it you know\nwhen somebody's talking to you start\nyou're just listening like oh you know\ndang I mean wow that's crazy and you're\nnot trying to impress\nyou're not trying to get their\nconversation your conversation your\ntalking points out you're just listening\nmost of the time\nand you start realizing you know what\nthe woman that I was talking to a couple\nweeks ago told me a whole lot of stuff\nthat I wasn't listening to because I was\ntrying to say I got a yacht I was trying\nto say I got a plane I was trying to say\nI got money but if I'd have been\nlistening I would be like you know what\ndamn she she told me some of the cues\nand some of the things that I could have\nused and I could have called back to and\nmade her see like you know she's like\nyou when you're telling jokes or\nsomething like that you're you're\nreading the audience and you're bringing\nstuff back around that's what makes a\ncomedian funny if you're not if you're\nnot listening and you're not paying\nyou're just trying to get your your\njokes off or you're just trying to get\nwhatever you want to tell them oh I got\nI'm a CEO Fortune 500 company I got\nmoney\nyou know you don't even know what you\nshould be saying it's like when you sell\na car to somebody and they're like yeah\nyou know I got five kids and then you\nyou say yeah man this Porsche that I got\nright here bro you know it gets uh from\nzero to 60 however long you know like\nbrought in okay thanks for that yeah\nyeah you get what I'm saying like you\ngotta listen\nokay that's been uh fascinating Chaz\nit's been so great to talk with you\ntoday this has been a really\nenlightening conversation for me uh if\npeople want to know more about
