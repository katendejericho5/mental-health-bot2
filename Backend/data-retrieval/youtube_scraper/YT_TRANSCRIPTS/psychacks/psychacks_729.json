    "transcript": "spoken with many men who have made\nsignificant commitments to women out of\nguilt and pity for the woman's\ncircumstances namely that she is running\nout of time with respect to her\nreproductive window listen to me men her\nfailure to plan is not your\nresponsibility if she's in her 30s her\nrelationship with you is not her first\nrodeo this means that she has likely\nturned down other relationships before\nyou even entered the picture her\ndecisions have brought her to this point\nin her life you do not need to rescue\nher from the consequences of her\ndecisions because she potentially\noverestimated how easy it would be to\nget what she wanted when she finally\nfelt ready to want it the vast majority\nof women who end up in this situation\nchose to prioritize their career\nthroughout this decade of their lives\nthe issue is that the game changes\nsignificantly in the 30s and many of\nthose men who would have been thrilled\nto get her in her 20s won't be as\nexcited if she lets him have her in his\n30s"
