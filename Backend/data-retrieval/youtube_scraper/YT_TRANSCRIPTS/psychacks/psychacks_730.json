    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is scicax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is I don't\nwant to waste my time\nso this is something that men generally\nhear from women often older women women\nwho have entered their 30s but not\nalways the idea here is that from her\nperspective a relationship that doesn't\nhave a high likelihood of ending in\nmarriage and children is not worth\ninvesting in since her biological clock\nis ticking her time is an increasingly\nprecious resource and she can no longer\nspend it with men who are not prepared\nto give her what she wants such men are\ntime wasters\nall right well I have a few\nunconventional takes on this topic let's\nget into it first I can begin with the\nmost obvious one namely it's not\nactually possible for someone else to\nwaste your time\nyou can waste your own time but someone\nelse cannot waste your time without your\npermission take one of these episodes\nfor instance even if I were to set out\nwith the explicit intention to waste\nyour time by say rambling tangentially\nor reading a string of random numbers or\ntalking total nonsense I couldn't\nactually do it without your\nparticipation like I couldn't force you\nto sit there\nand waste your time without your consent\nand if I weren't providing value you\nwould probably think I was acting\nridiculous and move on to another\nepisode after a certain amount of time\nexternalizing responsibility for that\ndecision by arguing well I wasted your\ntime because of my content or my\nintentions would be immature\nas it would be an abnegation of personal\nresponsibility so no one can actually\nwaste your time even if that is their\nexplicit intention without your consent\nnow the pushback that I usually get from\nthis position is that some men actually\nare time wasters Orion because they are\nflat out deceitful\nlike this man lies right to your face\nand says things like oh sweetie baby I\nlove you you're the only one for me I\nwant you forever and ever I want to\nstart a family with you but I'm just not\nready yet or whatever and to make this\nthe most egregious possible example\nlet's even assume malice like the guy\nhas no real intention of ever making\ngood on any of these promises\neven in this case\neven in the most extreme example of this\nphenomenon the woman is still\nresponsible not entirely but mostly\nresponsible for wasting her time\nunpopular belief but if you believe a\nlie it is to some extent your fault for\nbelieving the LIE\nthat is it's your responsibility for not\nexercising appropriate discernment with\nrespect to what you choose to believe\nnow some Liars are very convincing and\nsome of us have to learn this lesson the\nhard way but that's the way it is\nthink about it how could someone tell\nyou exactly what you wanted to hear\ncould it possibly be because you made it\nvery obvious what you wanted to hear or\ncould it be that you punished the truth\nand therefore were asking to be lied to\nor is it possible that your attraction\ncaused you to turn a blind eye to some\nof the inconsistencies you noticed in\nhis behavior things to consider\nnow should the guy have lied well\nit depends on what you mean by should\nthe town liar should lie that's what the\nliar does\nyou should not expect a liar to tell the\ntruth expressing moral indignation is\nwasted emotion and would be energy\nbetter spent improving your discernment\nbelieving that people shouldn't lie or\nsteal or cheat or betray is believing in\na world that doesn't exist rather than\nexhort reality to be other than it is\nlearn to navigate that reality more\nsuccessfully externalizing\nresponsibility for that obligation by\nremaining in a victim role communicates\nthat you in effect still haven't learned\nyour lesson and this means that you will\nlikely re-experience that victimization\nuntil you do so now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom its message because it's Word of\nMouth referrals like this that really\nhelp to make the channel grow and you\ncan also hit the super thanks button\nit's the three little buttons in the\nlower right hand corner of the video and\ntip me in proportion to the value you\nfeel you've received from this episode\nthis helps to make this all happen and I\nreally appreciate your support\nnow another problem with the idea of\nhaving your time wasted is that it\nsuggests on some level that if a\nrelationship isn't a Forever After\naffair\nif it doesn't end in marriage and a\nlifelong partnership with the two of you\nholding hands on your deathbed using\nyour last breaths to communicate your\nundying love and commitment for each\nother\nthen the relationship is a failure and a\nwaste of time\nthis is something that we really need to\nexamine carefully because the fact the\nmatter is that all relationships end\nand the longevity of a relationship\ncannot be the primary metric of success\nI know many perfectly stable unhappy\nmarriages thank you very much\nif a person is going to invalidate all\nthe good a relationship provided simply\nas a consequence of the fact that it\nended or the fact of how it ended or the\nfact that it didn't provide everything\nwe would have liked then that person is\nvery stupid\nand that person is stupid because she\nhas robbed herself of a significant\nportion months or even years of her own\nlife\nit's immensely self-disrespectful to\njudge one's own experiences and\ndecisions as valueless and wasted\nbecause of whether or how a relationship\nended\nthis attitude is almost monstrous and\nshould be closely examined all right and\nmy final issue with this phrase I don't\nwant to waste my time is that it is a\ntactic used by women to put pressure on\na man to if not make a commitment then\nat least make a commitment to making a\ncommitment in the near future\nI've spoken with many men who have made\nsignificant commitments to women out of\nguilt and pity for the woman's\ncircumstances namely that she is running\nout of time with respect to her\nreproductive window\nlisten to me men\nyou do not have to play Hot Potato\nher failure to plan is not your\nresponsibility\nif she's in her 30s her relationship\nwith you is not her first rodeo this\nmeans that she has likely turned down\nother relationships and in some cases\nmany other relationships before you even\nentered the picture\nher decisions have brought her to this\npoint in her life you do not need to\nrescue her from the consequences of her\ndecisions because she potentially\noverestimated how easy it would be to\nget what she wanted when she finally\nfelt ready to want it\nhow did she spend her twenties\nsome of them were just having fun at the\nclub but the vast majority of women who\nend up in this situation chose to\nprioritize their career throughout this\ndecade of their lives and some of them\ndo this very successfully which gives\nthem what I would call a false sense of\nconfidence in their ability to get\nmarried and have a family\nand how can you blame them up to this\npoint they've gotten pretty much\neverything that they've wanted a\nmaster's degree a six-figure salary lots\nof male attention and they were\nencouraged to and celebrated when they\ntook this path\nthe issue is that the game changes\nsignificantly in the 30s when men come\ninto their own and many of those men who\nwould have been thrilled to get her in\nher 20s won't be as excited if she lets\nhim have her in his 30s\nif they want it all women would be smart\nto go after marriage first if they still\nfeel like they're missing out they can\nalways be employees in their 30s\nI had a number of hot takes in this one\nbut I think there's a lot of Truth in\nthis episode what do you think please\nlet me know in the comments below and if\nyou've gotten this far you might as well\nlike this episode And subscribe to this\nchannel you may also consider becoming a\nchannel member with perks like priority\nreview of comments or booking a
