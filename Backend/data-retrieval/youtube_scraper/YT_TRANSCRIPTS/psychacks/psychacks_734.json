    "transcript": "the issue with women is that their love\nis subject to being mixed up with so\nmany other impurities that it can even\nbe toxic to experience and what are some\nof those impurities possessiveness\nmaterialism jealousy control and greed\njust to name a few when these things are\nadded to the transmission of love it\ndoesn't mean that the love that is\ntransmitted is impure or bad but if it's\nmixed up with some of this other stuff\nit can make a person really sick to\nprevent this women have to filter their\nlove to strain out all the other\nimpurities that are subject to\ncontaminating the transmission of love\nand this requires some very honest\nself-reflection the ability to discern\nwith some degree of accuracy and\nintegrity when their love is mixed up\nwith things that don't belong there and\nthe more that women succeed in filtering\nout those things the more their Love\nWill Shine forth pure and unadulterated"
