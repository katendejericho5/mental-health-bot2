    "transcript": "all people are born soft as Tiny Sprouts\nor little saplings and it's in this\nincipient phase of life that a tree is\nmost likely to die and this is analogous\nto people if you can survive childhood\nthere's actually a pretty good chance\nthat you'll make it to old age now\nhere's the thing men cannot stay\nsaplings just like a sapling would never\nbecome a tree if it didn't get busy\ngetting hard a boy will never become a\nman if he stays soft so what does that\nsapling do it armors itself in tough\nbark and digs its roots deep into the\nground and these things provide a firm\nfoundation on which to grow taller and\nit does this not because it's a flex to\nbe tall but because that plant would\nliterally die if it didn't a tree has to\nfight for its right to exist and the\nsame is true for men for better or worse\nin our society men have to carve out a\nplace for themselves otherwise they\nremain boys or worse"
