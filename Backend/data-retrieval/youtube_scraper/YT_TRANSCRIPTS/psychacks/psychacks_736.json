    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is what men\nand women have to do in order to love\nI'm not talking about finding love so\nthis isn't a question about dating or\nattraction what I'm talking about are\nthe unique challenges each sex seems to\nface with respect to their capacity to\nlove they're being able to love another\nperson most people think they already\nknow how to love they don't the fact of\nthe matter is is that love is an\nincredibly High thing and few people are\ncapable of doing it in their present\nState and regardless of their capacity\nwe can all certainly learn to love\nbetter so let's get to it let's start\nwith the ladies women the image that I'm\ngoing to keep coming back to with\nrespect to your capacity to love is\nwater\nwe often talk about dirty water or\nunclean water but that's actually in\nprecise language technically water H2O\nis always pure if there are impurities\nat that level then it's not H2O and\nwe're not talking about water\nwhat we mean when we say the water is\ndirty is that the liquid that contains\nthe water also contains a bunch of other\nimpurities\nand it's those things that make the\nliquid dirty and dangerous to drink but\nWater by itself is always pure and\nuncorruptable\nthe same principle holds true for\nwomen's love what love is there to the\nextent that it is love is always pure\nthe issue with women is that their love\nis subject to being mixed up with so\nmany other impurities that it can even\nbe toxic to experience and what are some\nof those impurities there are so many of\nthem their love can be mixed up with\npossessiveness materialism jealousy\ncontrol Pride delusion martyrdom deceit\nand greed just to name a few\nwhen these things are added to the\ntransmission of love then the result can\nbe extremely toxic to receive it doesn't\nmean that the love that is transmitted\nis impure or bad but just like water if\nit's mixed up with some of this other\nstuff it can make a person really sick\nit's very hard for men to receive that\nkind of love and women who don't get\nthis end up alone at the end of a string\nof broken relationships to prevent this\nwomen have to filter their love to\nstrain out all the other impurities that\nare subject to contaminating the\ntransmission of love and this requires\nsome very honest self-reflection the\nability to discern with some degree of\naccuracy and integrity when their love\nis mixed up with things that don't\nbelong there and the more that women\nsucceed in filtering out those things\nthe more their Love Will Shine forth\npure and unadulterated so\nthat's women\nnow before I get into the men if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to make the channel grow and\nif you're liking what you're hearing you\ncan also hit the super thanks button\nit's in the lower right hand corner\nbeneath the screen with those three\nlittle dots and tip me in proportion to\nthe value you feel you've received from\nthis episode this really helps to make\nthis all happen and I really appreciate\nyour support\nnow let's move on to men guys we have a\nvery different challenge with respect to\nlove and our challenge actually has two\nparts the image that I would ask you to\nconsider with respect to this topic is a\ntree\nnow all people are born soft as Tiny\nSprouts or little saplings and because\nthey are extremely soft they are also\nextremely vulnerable and it's in this\nincipient phase of life that a tree is\nmost likely to die and this is analogous\nto people if you can survive childhood\nthere's actually a pretty good chance\nthat you'll make it to old age\nnow here's the thing men cannot stay\nsaplings just like a sapling would never\nbecome a tree if it didn't get busy\ngetting hard a boy will never become a\nman if he stays soft\nso what does that sapling do it armors\nitself in tough bark\nthickens its bowl and digs its roots\ndeep into the ground\nand these things provide a firm\nfoundation on which to grow taller\nand it does this not because it's a flex\nto be tall but because that plant would\nliterally die if it didn't it's not like\nthe established trees that are that are\nthere are going to get out of the way of\nthe sun just because there's a growing\ntree beneath their canopy that needs\nsome light a tree has to fight for its\nright to exist and the same is true for\nmen for better or worse in our society\nmen have to carve out a place for\nthemselves otherwise they remain boys or\nworse\nand this struggle is hard\nlike many things in life it would be\nmuch easier under ideal conditions\nhowever these are not the conditions\nunder which trees actually find\nthemselves in the real world and just\nlike trees men need to learn how to grow\nunder less than ideal conditions for\nexample it would be much easier for a\nman to succeed if say those around him\nsupported him\nbut if he can only succeed if those\naround him support him then he really\ncan't do it yet\nlikewise it would be easier for a man to\nsucceed if he was given opportunities to\ndo so but if he can only succeed if he\nhas given those opportunities then he\nreally can't do it yet\nlike the tree in the forest a man needs\nto fight for his right to occupy a place\nin the world\nand the way he does this is by becoming\nhard\nif he doesn't he will secure no sympathy\nand the world will keep on spinning\nnow what does this have to do with love\nwell if a man doesn't get hard\nthen this challenge is largely moot as\nthe man will find it very difficult to\nfind someone to give his love to and the\npun here is intended guys just like a\nman needs to get hard physically in\norder to have sex he needs to get hard\nemotionally in order to get love\nin order to give love hardness isn't\noptional for men and getting hard is the\nfirst step\nbut it doesn't end here the issue here\nis that it can happen that later on in\nlife men are subject to growing so hard\nthat they are more or less inured to all\nkinds of emotions or at least to all\nemotions besides anger that's the one\nthat never really seems to go away but\nout of force of habit in an instinct for\nsurvival men can grow so rigid that they\nno longer know how to give or receive\nsome of the other emotions like love\nand this is dangerous because a tree\nthat is too rigid will break when the\nweather which is in motion is too\nextreme\nfor a tree to sustainably thrive in\nmaturity it must be firm\nfirmness is like rigidity tempered by\npliability\nlike a tree a man must be firm he needs\nto temper his hardness and strength with\nsomething approaching suppleness\nand this suppleness allows men to give\nand receive love more effectively\nnow at this point I can almost hear the\nwomen who have gotten this far saying\nyes I wish men would open up more and be\nmore vulnerable and share their feelings\nEtc and it's like I hear you ladies but\nI'm also here to tell you that most men\ndon't have this problem\nin today's day and age most men are too\nsoft\nthey don't need to worry about this\nsecond step yet and when they do I'm\nadvocating a touch of suppleness to\ntemper the hardness not a little\nhardness to toughen up the softness men\nwill never be like you and that is how\nit should be so don't use the same\nstandard on your girlfriends as you\nwould on your boyfriends we have\ndifferent challenges to overcome and\nwhat are those challenges again women\nyou have to filter the impurities out of\nyour liquid water and Men you've got to\nget hard and then soften a bit doing\nboth will make it easier for both sexes\nto love and be loved\nwhat do you think please let me know in\nthe comments below and if you've gotten\nthis far you might as well like
