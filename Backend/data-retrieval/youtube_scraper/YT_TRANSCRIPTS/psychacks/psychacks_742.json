    "transcript": "we're discussing how things between men\nand women ended up the way they have so\nlet's recap first the masculine\nabdicated his power and authority next\nthe feminine sees that power because she\nwas poisoned by the Envy of an older\ngeneration who in turn was corrupted by\nresentment over patriarchal suppression\nthen the feminine is maintained in her\nRebellion by her unwillingness to submit\nto any structure or authority outside of\nherself and by a society that literally\ndoesn't know what to do with her and\ntreats her with an Indulgence which may\nno longer be appropriate on the one hand\nshe can't really Advance she cannot\ntruly embody the masculine and she will\nlikely eventually be consumed by the\nchaos and destruction she has wrought\nand on the other hand she cannot really\nRetreat she can't go back to the\nfeminine as her Defiance has made\nreturning to the way things were an\nimpossibility so we're at a kind of a\nstandstill and this is where we find\nourselves today"
