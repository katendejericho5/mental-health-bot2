    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraband and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how did\nwe end up here\nso many folks are lamenting the current\nstate of affairs between men and women\nespecially with respect to mating and\ndating and a common refrain that I hear\nechoed in the comments and in my\npersonal life is how did we end up in\nthis situation like it didn't used to be\nthis way right how did things get so bad\nhow did they go off the rails so much\nhow did we end up here\nit's an interesting question and I have\nan answer to this question that comes\nfrom a rather unlikely place and if you\ncan follow me in a spirit of willingness\nand open-mindedness I will explain what\nI mean\nthe answer to this question can be found\nof all places\nin the movie Crouching Tiger Hidden\nDragon\nthis is just an incredible film because\nit has something for everyone on the\nsurface it's this really fun martial\narts movie with dazzling visuals and\ngreat acting however the story also\ncontains several profound psychological\nmessages that I just wasn't equipped to\nappreciate when I first watched the\nmovie over 20 years ago and if anyone\nout there Knows Mr Ang Lee I would be\ndelighted to know whether he thought the\nfollowing interpretations had any Merit\nat first blush the film script seems\nalmost superficial like it's just the\npretext for the action scenes and most\nthe characterization is accomplished\nthrough subtle suggestion and indirect\nreference however this is a clue that\nwe're actually dealing with archetypes\naspects of human experience that\ntranscend time and space in fact\nCrouching Tiger is a very modern romance\nand it's setting in medieval China\nallows it to comment on Modern\nintersectional Dynamics without being\nfound out\nso what exactly is the underlying\nmessage of the movie in so many words\nThe Narrative relates the story of the\npainful and ultimately tragic\nrelationship between the masculine and\nThe Feminine both in society as a whole\nand in the life of an individual\nif you haven't seen the movie I would\nhighly recommend that you watch it it is\nworth two hours of your life as my\nanalysis will largely assume familiarity\nwith the characters and the story\nthe main action of the film revolves\naround the green Destiny in ancient\nsword wielded by Limu by a powerful Monk\nthroughout the film Lee represents the\nmasculine principle he is strong\ncompetent and disciplined and the sword\nwhich is an obvious phallic symbol\nrepresents the legitimate authority of\nthe masculine in so much as it Accords\nwith the natural green Order of Things\ndestiny\nwe are reminded by Julian Lee's love\ninterest that he has used the green\ndestiny justly that is to destroy evil\nand protect the defenseless\nthese coincidentally are the two edges\nof the sword to destroy and to protect\nwithout which the sword functionally\ncould not exist as such\nhowever the movie begins with Lee's\ndecision to give up the green Destiny by\nmaking a donation of it to his\nbenefactor\nand he does this essentially because\nhe's tired as he tells Julian the blade\nonly looks pure because blood washes off\nit so easily he's tired of the conflict\nand the trouble because it turns out\nmaintaining Law and Order is a\nRelentless struggle and accepting the\nunsolved case of Jade Fox the woman who\nkilled his master there seems to be no\nreal evil Brewing owing in no small part\nto his efforts so it seems like a good\ntime to retire\nthis is the first real action that\ncatalyzes all the subsequent events in a\nmoment of relative peace the masculine\nvoluntarily abdicates his power and\nauthority\nit's important to understand that it\nwould never have been possible for Jen\nwho represents the feminine principle to\nhave stolen the sword if it was still in\nLee's possession just think of how\neffortlessly he takes the sword back\nfrom her at the waterfall she is only\nable to take possession of the power and\nauthority represented by the sword\nbecause the masculine first abdicated\nboth\nnow this abdication of the masculine\ncreated an opportunity for the feminine\nin the symbol of gen to seize power and\nJen steals the green Destiny from the\nbenefactors compound and The Feminine is\nmotivated to do this because it has\nsuffered under the masculine both\nsocially in the form of patriarchal\ncontrol and individually in the\nsuppression of feeling and emotion\nI really don't like that word\npatriarchal and I think it is woefully\nmisapplied today however we can see\nexamples of it throughout the movie\nall three of the main female characters\nJulian Jade Fox and Jen\nuh have all been negatively impacted by\nmale dominated uses of power\nLee's Master refuted refused to teach\nJade Fox who was clearly competent\nbecause she was a woman though\napparently he had no problem sleeping\nwith her\nJulian is bound to a life of honor-bound\nChastity when her fiance is killed\npreventing her from having a real\nrelationship with a man and Jen is being\nmarried off by her father to secure his\npolitical advantage in spite of the fact\nthat she loves someone else\nJulian and Jen confess to each other\nthat neither has ever felt free in her\nentire life whereas the freedom of Jade\nFox is that of a fugitive a life of\nPerpetual hiding\nnow the real question of the story is\nhow is Jen going to end up\nthe two possibilities are reflected in\nthe lives of the older female characters\nWill she end up like her adoptive older\nsister Julian who has submitted to\nmasculine Authority who tries to teach\nJen about the importance of rules and\nrespect and who reminds her that the\ngreen Destiny belongs to limubai or Will\nshe end up like her guardian Jade Fox\nwho is in open Defiance to that\nAuthority who has been corrupted by her\npain and who tries to recruit Jen into a\nlife of open Rebellion most of the movie\nis Jen trying to figure out who she is\nthat is it asks the question of how the\nfeminine will relate to the masculine\nmoving forward in light of its suffering\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the super\nthanks button it's contained in those\nthree little dots in the lower right\nhand corner beneath the video and tip me\nin proportion to the value you feel\nyou've derived from this episode I\nreally appreciate your support\nin any case Jen steals the green Destiny\nas a mischievous last hurray before she\nsubmits to her fate\nin the process however Jen gets her\nfirst taste of death and killing and\nrealizes that real life isn't like one\nof her martial arts novels she comes\ninto contact with one of the aspects of\nreality that the patriarchy had\nprotected her from that life is\ndangerous and Lawless without the\nmasculine ordering principle and she is\nso frightened by the encounter that she\nreturns the sword as she does so she is\nconfronted by Lee who offers to take her\non as a student to provide her with\nguidance and structure unfortunately in\nthis offer Jen only hears submission to\nyet another male Authority\nof the superiority of the masculine over\nthe feminine and she refuses to accept\nparroting Jade Fox's words of contempt\nfor rudon the patriarchal institution\nthat had snubbed Fox years ago this is a\nreally important point the pain of Jade\nFox's unfulfilled potential and\nunrealized dreams has corrupted her\nher revolt against the institutions that\nshe blames for her pain makes a kind of\nsense and even requires a respectable\nmeasure of Courage however despite\neverything she may have suffered at the\nhands of the patriarchy\nnothing causes her more pain than Jen\nwhose talent and potential surpass her\nown and seem to have found a receptive\naudience in limubai\nJade Fox indoctrinates Jen into her\ncontempt for men generally and wudon\nspecifically not because it is in Jen's\nbest interests but because it allows her\nJade Fox to maintain a precariously\nSuperior position Visa vijen a younger\nmore competent adversary\nJade Fox's indoctrination is not done\nout of kindness but out of envy\nEnvy for everything gen could be that\nshe could not\nwe know this because even though the\npoison that Jade Fox uses a compound\ncalled Purple Yin purple meaning wounded\nlike a bruise and Yin meaning femininity\nor poisonous symbolically her wounded\nfemininity even though this poison\nultimately kills Limu by Jade Fox\nconfesses that it was actually intended\nfor Jen\nin a real sense Jen's physical poisoning\nwould have been the culmination of a\nlifetime of emotional poisoning through\ndifferent methods however at this part\nof the story Jen has yet to really\nencounter the consequences of this\nindoctrination\nnow a few days after returning the sword\non her wedding night face to face with\nthe prospect of consummating a marriage\nshe doesn't want to a man she doesn't\nlove Jen tilts over into full Defiance\nand steals the green Destiny in earnest\nto Jen the sword masculine power and\nauthority is the ability to be\nself-determined to do what one wants\nshe does not understand the\nresponsibility that comes with it Jen\nhas not been taught discipline and\nresponsibility though to be fair she has\nnot been willing to learn and the sword\nin her hands becomes an instrument of\nthe unsurrendered will\nit's as if Jen the long-suppressed\nfeminine says enough and a powerful\nforce the chaotic upsurgence of feeling\nbegins to Ripple through the story\nin the original myth of Aladdin and the\nlamp the genie isn't grateful for being\nreleased he is homicidal for having been\npent up for so long and that's right the\nlonger a feeling has been suppressed the\nmore violent its Resurgence when it is\nultimately expressed and let's be clear\nthis isn't all bad on some level the\nupsurgence of the feminine of the yin\nprinciple was necessary and inevitable\nafter all after the Sun at the sun's\nZenith it has already begun to set\nfor example the feminine was what was\nmissing from the life of Lee mubai who\nis Yang incarnate Lee is so disciplined\nand so controlled that when he finally\narrives in Enlightenment he can feel no\njoy or Bliss because he is so completely\nsuffocated his feeling state\nas has benefactor says even great Heroes\ncan be idiots when it comes to emotions\nindeed the only time we ever see any\nkind of sensuality from Lee is when he's\ndancing with his sword in the Moonlight\na kind of masturbatory surrogate for\nJulian\nhowever it's through contact with Jen\nwho represents the\ninsuppressible feeling state of\nfemininity that he finally finds the\ncourage courage Lee's word from the word\ncure meaning heart that he finally finds\nthe heart to admit his feelings for\nJulian accept himself fully and redeem\nthe life that he himself believed he\nwould otherwise have wasted\nin any case now the genie is out of the\nbottle\nJen goes on her war path unwilling to\nsubmit to any higher authority than\nherself what does she do\nshe puts on men's clothing\ntakes up the phallic symbol of the\nmasculine and does whatever she wants\nwhich to her means becoming a man\nJen gleefully humbles The Bullying\nmachismo of a whole mob of men fancing\nherself an indestructible sword goddess\nit's the Triumph of a woman who is no\nlonger holding back and who can beat men\nat their own game\nshe destroys an entire building in the\nprocess enjoying herself the entire time\nthis is the feminine wielding the power\nof the masculine without submitting to\nan ordering principle and this is why\nwhen he confronts her by the waterfall\nLee commands her to kneel as he\npresumably did for his own Master but\nthis of course is precisely what she\ncannot do she cannot do it because she\nis indoctrinated by Jade Fox's\nresentment because she considers\nsubmission to the masculine to be the\ndeath of her individual life and because\non a purely conceptual level Yin chaos\ncan't ever submit to order otherwise it\nwouldn't be chaos\nthis is why order must always be imposed\non chaos that might be an uncomfortable\nfact for some people but it is the truth\nfortunately as I mentioned earlier\nJade's fate Jen's fate is still\nundecided and the possibility remains\nthat she will choose to surrender her\nwillfulness to impose order on her own\nchaos once she recognizes the true\nnature of that chaos\nunfortunately this generally only occurs\nwhen we encounter the consequences of\nour actions and the whole movie\nfunctionally consists of saving Jen from\nthe consequences of her actions let's do\na quick inventory shall we over the\ncourse of the movie Jen tries to shoot\nlow with a bow knocks him unconscious\nwith a rock stabs him in the chest the\nTracer host trespasses in his private\nrooms steals his property beats up\ndozens of people destroys a restaurant\nslices Julian with a sword spreads lies\nabout Lee mubai attempts to seduce him\nand openly insults taunts and\ndisrespects people who are continually\ngoing out of their way to help her what\na charmer so why does she experience\nzero consequences\nbecause one of the traditional attitudes\ntowards femininity is Indulgence in the\nsense of leniency forbearance and\nprotection it's a privilege that\nfemininity enjoys as a consequence of\nbeing traditionally deprived of power\nand authority after all if women could\nnot on a certain level control their own\nactions it would be cruel and\nunreasonable to hold them responsible\nfor the consequences of their actions\nhence Indulgence as a uniquely feminine\nprivilege\nthe issue here is that Jen the feminine\nprinciple has taken up masculine power\nand authority has assumed her\nself-determination and the rest of the\nworld doesn't know what to do with her\nshe has the sword should we treat her\nlike a man but she's not a man so should\nwe treat her like a woman\ntrust me this would have been a very\nshort movie had a man stolen the green\ndestiny that guy would have been cut\ndown by Limu by as the thief and traitor\nhe was in the first five minutes but no\none really knows what to do with a woman\nwho has abdicated the feminine and\nassumed the masculine with a woman who\nwill not submit to any Authority Beyond\nher own Caprice\nand this is where we find ourselves\ntoday\nagain we're discussing how things\nbetween men and women ended up the way\nthey have so let's recap first the\nmasculine abdicated his power and\nauthority next the feminine sees that\npower because she was poisoned by the\nEnvy of an older generation who in turn\nwas corrupted by resentment over\npatriarchal suppression\nthen the feminine is maintained in her\nRebellion by her unwillingness to submit\nto any structure or authority outside of\nherself and by a society that literally\ndoesn't know what to do with her and\ntreats her with an Indulgence which may\nno longer be appropriate\non the one hand she can't really Advance\nshe cannot truly embody the masculine\nand she will likely eventually be\nconsumed by the chaos and destruction\nshe has wrought and on the other hand\nshe cannot really Retreat she can't go\nback to the feminine as her Defiance has\nmade returning to the way things were an\nimpossibility so we're at a kind of a\nstandstill\nso what ultimately happens well Jen\nfinally experiences the consequences of\nher actions when they lead to the death\nof Lee mubai the masculine principle\nonly then does she appreciate that her\nactions may have far-reaching permanent\nand irreversible consequences both for\nher and importantly other women\nJade Fox would have her believe that men\nare women's natural enemies but the\ndefeat of the masculine is a source of\ngrief for the feminine Jen has after all\ndeprived shulienne of her love which\nresults in an implacable feeling of\nguilt when she is reunited with her own\nlover low\nonly then does Jen surrender her\nwillfulness and make a sacrifice of her\nlife\nbut then again maybe this is just a fun\nmovie about Kung Fu what do I know so\nthis was a long analysis with a lot of\ninterrelated parts so I hope you were\nable to follow it I do hope that you\nwatch this movie for yourself if you\nhaven't already and let me know what you\nthink about my analysis in the comments\nbelow if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well become you might as well\nlike this episode And
