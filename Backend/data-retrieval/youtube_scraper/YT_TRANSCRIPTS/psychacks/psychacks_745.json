    "video_title": "How to create a VISION for your LIFE",
    "transcript": "with respect to creating a vision for a\nfulfilling life rather than imagine all\nthe things you want to have accomplished\nor achieved in say the next five years a\nmuch better idea is to imagine in\nexcruciating detail how you would like\nto be spending an average Tuesday five\nyears from now and that's because no\nmatter how exciting or exotic your life\nmay be you will have far more average\nTuesdays than Peak experiences so you\nwant to create a life in which most of\nyour days are fulfilling not a life in\nwhich once in a blue moon you experience\nsome degree of satisfaction as a result\nof a significant achievement so imagine\nwith some measure of granularity an\naverage Tuesday in your life five years\nfrom now where do you wake up when do\nyou wake up who do you wake up next to\nhow do you spend your morning your\nafternoon your evening how do you feel\nwho do you interact with what do you\nhave to look forward to try to really\ndial in what that looks like so that you\ncan reverse engineer from the intended\ndestination"
