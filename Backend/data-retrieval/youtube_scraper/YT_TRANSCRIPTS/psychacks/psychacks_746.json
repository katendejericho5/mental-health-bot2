    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nhave a fulfilling life so this is\nsomething that many people are looking\nfor and I don't blame them a fulfilling\nlife is a supremely good thing today I'm\ngoing to tell you how to go about doing\njust this\nfirst off you have to understand that if\nyou want to have a fulfilling life you a\nspecific individual you will need to\ncreate it for yourself inhabiting a\nlifestyle is kind of like buying clothes\nif you buy them off the rack the best\nyou can hope for is like an 85 percent\nfit and that's the best possible outcome\nand generally requires a lot of shopping\naround if you want more than an 85\npercent fit you will need to have those\nclose custom tailored by the same token\nif you're looking for a fulfilling life\nyou will need to Custom Tailor it to\nyour own specifications just like you\ninhabit a unique and individual body\nthat is not quite like any other body on\nthe planet you are a unique and\nindividual person who is not quite like\nany other person on the planet so we'll\nneed to roll up our sleeves and get to\nwork\nso what does that work entail to have a\nfulfilling life you really need two\nthings you need vision\nand you need want\nyou need both and it's the union of\nthese two things that allow for the\nactualization of a lifestyle that will\nbe fulfilling to you personally let's\nget into this\nfirst let's talk about vision\nis Imagination plus granularity it's the\nability to imagine at a fine resolution\nof detail the best metaphor I have for\nvision is an architect's blueprint once\na blueprint has been completed in some\nrespect the structure has already been\nbuilt All That Remains is to erect it a\ncompleted blueprint has attended to\nevery detail of the structure down to\nthe size of the screws in the hinges in\nthe basement\nthis is the level of resolution\nnecessary for the task\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing then please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to make the channel grow and\nyou can also hit the super thanks button\nand tip me in proportion to the value\nyou feel you've received from this\nepisode\nthis helps keep the channel going I\nreally appreciate your support\nnow with respect to creating a vision\nfor a fulfilling life rather than\nimagine all the things you want to have\naccomplished or achieved in say the next\nfive years a much better idea is to\nimagine in excruciating detail how you\nwould like to be spending an average\nTuesday five years from now and that's\nbecause no matter how exciting or exotic\nyour life may be you will have far more\naverage Tuesdays than Peak experiences\nso you want to create a life in which\nmost of your days are fulfilling not a\nlife in which once in a blue moon you\nexperience some degree of satisfaction\nas a result of a significant achievement\nso imagine with some measure of\ngranularity an average Tuesday in your\nlife five years from now\nwhere do you wake up when do you wake up\nwho do you wake up next to how do you\nspend your morning your afternoon your\nevening how do you feel who do you\ninteract with what do you have to look\nforward to try to really dial in what\nthat looks like so that you can reverse\nengineer from the intended destination\nnow vision is good but Vision Without\nwant is a trap\nsome folks are very intellectual and\nhave powerfully extrapolated\nimaginations and these people can get\nlost in their own Visions they end up\nendlessly creating these fantastically\ncomplicated intricate systems of living\nthat never get built so we have to\nunderstand that while the structure is\nin some sense completed in the blueprint\nyou can't actually live in a blueprint\nyou can only live in the erected\nstructure so at a certain point we all\nhave to stop planning and start acting\nand action requires some degree of want\nwhich is like a combination of desire\nand will I don't love the word want but\nit's the best I've come up with desire\nis to associated with pleasure and\nemotion will is to disembodied and\nintellectual however their combination\nthe union of embodied and disembodied\nagency is a Dynamo and I'm calling that\nwant\nit's a strong sustainable emotionally\ncompelling Drive\nwithout which nothing really ever gets\ndone\nwant is connected with the life force\nwhose primary expression is the sex\ndrive which is why one of the best ways\nmen can increase their want is to stop\nmasturbating\nthis way the sex drive can be\nincreasingly sublimated toward\nconstructive action in the real world\nnow want is good but want without vision\nis also a trap some folks have a\npowerful want and a great deal of agency\nfor action\nbut without Vision these people can fall\ninto recklessness impulsivity and\nshort-term gratification\npeople with a high degree of want and no\nvision are like dogs who spend all day\nchasing cars they run after one until\nanother goes off in another Direction\nand they turn around and chase after\nthat one instead\ndogs like this can chase cars all day\nand never leave the block\nsimilarly people with high want and low\nvision often don't get very far in life\nand they end up squandering a very\nvaluable resource\nso to have a fulfilling life you need to\nhave Vision which is the completed\nblueprint and you need to have want\nwhich is the drive to actualize that\nVision in reality\nif you develop both of those capacities\nand you harmonize them with Prudence you\nwill be able to create a fulfilling life\nfor yourself I guarantee it\nand one final thought\nit may sound strange but people are\nactually happiest when they are in the\nprocess of becoming not when they\nactually become\nso if your vision has a Terminus that\ncan actually be attained you might be\nsomewhat disappointed when you actually\narrive\nthe blueprint for a fulfilling life is\nkind of like the schematic for the\nWestchester Mystery House which was\nalways under construction as long as its\nowner was alive\na wise Vision will always provide you\nwith something to do not just something\nfor you to have done\nthis is because it is the process of\nsublimating your want in the service of\nyour vision that most people experience\nas extremely fulfilling\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments
