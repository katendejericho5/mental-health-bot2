    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the\ndifference between masculine and\nfeminine communication\nnow I'm using these terms masculine and\nfeminine as opposed to male and female\nbecause the fact of the matter is both\nmen and women are capable of masculine\nand feminine communication but in\ngeneral men tend toward masculine\ncommunication and in general women tend\ntoward feminine communication so the\ngendered terms aren't really tied to\nbiological sex but they are somewhat\ncorrelated okay so there are some\nsignificant differences between\nmasculine and feminine communication and\nit's the failure to adequately\nappreciate those differences that leads\nto a whole host of conflict and\nmisunderstanding between the Sexes\nhowever this can be mitigated through\nunderstanding\nlet's start with masculine communication\nmasculine communication is about the\ntransmission of information\nit does this by means of two general\nstrategies the first is to emphasize the\nsemantic content of the communication\nthis is why things like definition and\nword choice are so important a single\nimproper word can Mar the entire\ntransmission\nand the second strategy is to minimize\nif not eliminate entirely the emotional\ncomponent of the transmission this is\nbecause if the goal is to convey\ninformation\nemotion is Superfluous at best and\ndistortive at worst\nin masculine communication we know that\nthe speaker has been heard if the\nlistener can accurately summarize or\nparaphrase the essential information\ncontained in the intended message that's\nmasculine communication\non the other hand feminine communication\nis almost entirely the opposite that's\nbecause feminine communication is about\nthe transmission of experience in the\nsense of felt subjectivity\nwhile word choice isn't entirely\narbitrary it's much less important than\nin masculine communication why because\nin feminine communication words are not\nprimarily used for their semantic\ncontent but as containers for emotional\nenergy\nand this is true in direct proportion to\nhow emotional the speaker is man or\nwoman at the heights of anger\nat the depths of despair\nyou see in feminine communication we\nknow that the speaker has been heard if\nthe listener ends up resonating at the\nsame emotional frequency as the speaker\nthink of tuning Forks when a vibrating\ntuning fork is brought close to another\nthe second begins to vibrate at the same\nfrequency\nand this is a big part of why women can\nbe so emotionally provocative for better\nor worse they are trying to get you to\nfeel the same way she does in that\nmoment\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to make the channel grow and\nyou can also hit the super thanks button\nwhich is those three little dots in the\nlower right hand corner below the video\nyou can hit that button and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you\nhave derived from this episode I really\nappreciate your support\nnow this is why from a masculine\nperspective if we were to eavesdrop on a\ngroup of women sitting around and having\na conversation it can almost sound\npsychotic\none moment a woman is tearfully\nrecalling something sad that happened to\nher\nand as she starts to cry the eyes of all\nthe women at the table start to well up\nand and then\na few moments later she reveals that she\nwas comically wrong about what she was\nsad about and as she laughs the whole\ntable bursts into uproarious laughter\nall in the span of a minute\nfrom a feminine perspective the\nconversation is an emotional Journey\nwhereby the listeners are conducted\nthrough a succession of emotional states\nthat mimic the speaker's experience and\nit's through that emotional resonance\nthat women connect with other people\nhere's the easiest way to think about it\nmasculine communication is like language\nwithout vowels it's only consonants if I\nwere to write you an email with all the\nvowels removed you would likely be able\nto figure out what I was trying to say\nwith little reduction infidelity and\nthat's because almost all the semantic\ninformation in a word is contained in\nits consonants\non the other hand feminine communication\nis like a language without consonants\nit's only vowels\nat its extreme it's just pure\nundifferentiated sound\nand that's because almost all the\nemotional information in a word is\ncontained in its vowels and this is why\nsome song lyrics just sound so\nridiculous when you try to transcribe\nthem the song isn't about the words the\nwords are merely containers for the\nemotion which is untranslatable\nnow effective communication\noccurs when you marry these two things\ntogether effective communication is the\nunion of masculine and feminine\ncommunication just like the fullest\nexpression of language is to utilize\nboth vowels and consonants to do this\nyou use the masculine focus on word\nchoice to select appropriate words that\naccurately reflect the information\nyou're trying to convey that is use the\nmasculine Focus to appreciate semantic\ninformation while imbuing those words\nwith emotional content which is the\nfeminine contribution now I'm stealing\nthis term emotional content from Bruce\nLee in Enter the Dragon emotional\ncontent is not anger emotional content\nis not happiness emotional content is\nnot any emotion in particular emotional\ncontent is like undifferentiated emotion\nsomething like warmth or intention\nyou're putting a little of yourself in\nthe words you're communicating think of\nit like Timbre which is a musical term\nwhich means the quality of sound that\nreflects the nature of the instrument it\nis sounded upon\nspecificity in language plus richness in\nquality is the simple arithmetic for the\nmost effective forms of communication\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've
