    "transcript": "when I speak about relationships as the\nmedium in which value is transacted I\nget a lot of pushback from folks in the\ncomments and the most typical type of\npushback I receive is something like\nWhat About Love does love have no place\nin a relationship well I'm going to\nrespond to this critique in today's\nepisode by arguing that love has nothing\nto do with relationships let me explain\nwhy this is the case again a\nrelationship is the medium in which\nvalue is transacted since this is the\ncase relationships have rules what is\nallowed and what is not allowed\nrelationships have definitions this is\nwhat it is and this is what it is not\nand relationships have compromises this\nis what I will get for what I will give\nup and this is because we need rules and\ndefinitions and compromises to in effect\ndo business with each other which is\nwhat we do when we transact value\nhowever love has absolutely nothing to\ndo with any of these things"
