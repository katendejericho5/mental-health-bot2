    "transcript": "I'm a big fan of evolutionary psychology\nI think it helps to explain a lot of\nmodern behavior and that's because\neveryone alive today is really a link in\nan unbroken chain of billions of years\nof evolution generally and hundreds of\nthousands of years of homo sapiens\nexistence specifically our civilization\nand technology are advancing at a\nfantastic rate however that certainly\ndoesn't mean that our biology and\npsychology are keeping Pace some of our\nheritages have a very long Shadow and it\nis imprudent to suffer the illusion that\nwe can or should consciously liberate\nourselves from all of these vestiges so\nit makes sense to examine where we came\nfrom and how we've been living for\nhundreds of thousands of years to see\nhow this Legacy might inform the modern\nworld and there are few domains where\nevolutionary psychology is more relevant\nthan that of intersexual Dynamics"
