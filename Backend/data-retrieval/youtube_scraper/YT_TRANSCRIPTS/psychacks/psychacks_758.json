    "transcript": "most people are delusional now I'm not\nsuggesting that most people think the\nCIA is beaming thoughts into their\nConsciousness or some such thing that is\nvery bizarre for a delusion and because\nit's bizarre it's very noticeable if\nmost people are delusional in the sense\nof having a false belief about reality\nthen that could really only happen if\nthe delusion in question were so\nprevalent that its ubiquity renders it\ninvisible much the same way that fish\ncan't see the water and everyday\ndelusion is functionally transparent to\nthose who believe it but for all the\npeople under its spell it remains a\ndelusion nonetheless in so many words\nthe most common delusion that people\nsuffer from is that our judgments about\nreality in here in reality itself"
