    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is most\npeople are delusional\nnow I'm not suggesting that most people\nthink the CIA is beaming thoughts into\ntheir Consciousness or some such thing\nthat is very bizarre for a delusion and\nbecause it's bizarre it's very\nnoticeable\nif most people are delusional in the\nsense of having a false belief about\nreality then that could really only\nhappen if the delusion in question were\nso prevalent that it's ubiquity renders\nit invisible\nmuch the same way that fish can't see\nthe water and everyday delusion is\nfunctionally transparent to those who\nbelieve it but for all the people under\nits spell it remains a delusion\nnonetheless\nin so many words the most common\ndelusion that people suffer from\nis that our judgments about reality in\nhere in reality itself\nlet me explain to begin with you have to\nunderstand that the universe is empty\nand I don't mean empty in the sense of\ndevoid of matter though the universe is\nin fact also mostly empty in this sense\nbut empty in an instrumental sense like\na cup is empty it's the emptiness of a\ncup that makes it functional and that\nemptiness is kind of non-discriminatory\nit's not like a cup can only contain\ncertain liquids and not others a cup can\ncontain any liquid that can be poured in\nit that's what makes it useful\nin this way the universe is like a cup\nin that it can contain whatever a mind\nprojects into it because it is empty the\nsame phenomenon can contain a positive\njudgment projected from one mind and a\nnegative judgment projected by another\nso which one is the phenomenon really\npositive or negative\nit's probably true is to say it is what\nit is which while accurate isn't very\ninformative it's a tautology which means\nthat it's true by definition and it\ndoesn't give us any new knowledge in\nfact it kind of frustrates the act of\nknowing which has long been used as a\nstrategy in the service of Enlightenment\nbut I digress\nreality is empty\nin that it can receive any judgment a\nhuman mind is capable of projecting into\nit\nand that's somewhat tragic because most\npeople's judgment\nare not grounded in objectivity or\nwisdom or even a consistent morality\nrather most people's judgments are\nincredibly self-centered\nto the vast majority of people good is\nwhat they want or what they believe in\nand bad is what they don't want and or\nwhat they don't believe in\nit kind of goes like this\nwhen something happens and in that\nmoment people perceive that it aligns\nwith their personally relevant goals I.E\nit's what they want they judge that\nsomething as good and project that\njudgment into reality\nand almost as soon as they do this they\nkind of wipe their own memory of that\nprojection\nit's like a self-imposed amnestic\ndisorder and since they forget or\nwillfully suppress that awareness\nthat they projected that judgment into\nreality then they experience reality as\nif their judgments in here in reality\nitself\npeople believe they are experiencing a\ngood thing like the thing itself is good\nand not their own externally projected\nJudgment of goodness in the vast\nmajority of cases they think they are\naccurately perceiving something that\nobjectively exists in reality and that\nis the delusion\nbut before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to make the channel grow and\nyou can also hit the super thanks button\nand tip me in proportion to the value\nyou feel you derived from this video I\nreally appreciate your support\nnow this delusion is enacted\nquintillions of times a day by billions\nof people\nit's also constantly reified by our\nlanguage when we say things like he's\nsuch a nice boy or what a rude thing to\nsay or things are starting to look up or\nthat date was disappointing or that was\nthe best thing that ever happened to me\nor that's wrong or Etc and just like\ndelusions in clinical practice this\ndelusion is accompanied by a whole\nspectrum of insight there are people who\nexperience this delusion but possess\nenough awareness to let's say hold their\nperceptions lightly\nand there are those who are going to\nthink that I'm absolutely nuts for\nsuggesting that good things aren't good\nand bad things aren't bad\nthese folks while potentially\nwell-meaning just don't see the water\nyet\nfrom a purely psychological perspective\nyour experience of reality is likely\nmuch more a reflection of your own mind\nthan a consequence of anything inherent\nin that reality and this is problematic\nbecause if all people see are facets of\ntheir own projected Consciousness then\nthe universe is really just one big Hall\nof Mirrors which is functionally the\nnarcissistic dilemma everything is a\nreflection of the self and if that\nreflection is a projected judgment that\nis functionally based on whether you\nwant or don't want something to happen\nthen the entire universe is reduced to\nan instrumental extension of your desire\nwhich is functionally hell\nwhen people are operating under this\ndelusion they actually can't see\nanything other than themselves like\ntheir eyes can see the forms of reality\nlike that's a tree and that's a man and\nthat's a house but what they're really\nperceiving are the projected aspects of\nthemselves that they then experience as\ninherent in reality\nand this way of navigating reality is\nextraordinarily common\nso what can we do about it\nwell we can become increasingly aware of\nthis mental process I don't believe it's\npossible to completely refrain from\nprojecting our judgments or mental\nconstructs into reality but I absolutely\nbelieve that it's possible to let's say\nwithhold certain judgments and clarify\nothers that is we can divest them of\ntheir emotionally provocative content\nand that's typically a sign that we're\ncloser to reality because again reality\nis what it is it's kind of hard to feel\none way or another about reality the\nmore we see it clearly\nI can't really say anything more about\nreality because going beyond that is\ntantamount to imbuing it with my own\nprojected judgment\nand this is why Enlightenment which may\nbe understood as entering into reality\nis always described as an ineffable\nexperience it's something that even the\ngreatest spiritual Traditions can kinda\nonly point to from afar like the Dao\nthat can be named is not the real Dao\nkind of thing\nand why is that because the Dao or\nreality will never be isomorphic with\nwhatever projected judgment or mental\nconstruct I use to define or describe it\nand to make matters worse people might\nconfuse the projection for The Real\nMcCoy make sense\nagain the vast majority of people on\nthis planet suffer from the delusion\nthat their judgments about reality in\nhere in reality it happens so often and\nis reified by our language that we see\nnothing crazy about it\nin fact we reserve the term delusion for\nfolks whose judgments about reality\ndeviate significantly from the\nconventional judgments we have tacitly\nagreed are appropriate to assume in here\nin reality the two groups aren't really\ndoing anything different there are just\nsocially acceptable delusions and\nsocially unacceptable delusions but they\nare delusions all the same\nthe only way out that I can see is to\nbecome more aware of this process over\ntime awareness can help shatter the\nmirrors and facilitate a more direct\nexperience of reality as it is\neverything else is a prison of your own\nmaking\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this
