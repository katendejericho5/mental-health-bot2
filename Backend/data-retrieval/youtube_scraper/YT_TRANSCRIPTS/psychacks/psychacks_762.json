    "transcript": "just like two people cannot like each\nother exactly the same amount which\nasymmetry gives rise to the balance of\nAttraction two people cannot be\ncommitted to a relationship exactly the\nsame amount this is a hard fact of life\nand a bitter pill to swallow we see this\neverywhere but we would prefer not to\nsee it for instance you may not be your\nbest friends best friend and your\nemployer may not need you as much as you\nneed your employer if you want to know\nwho has more power in a relationship you\nsimply need to consider who is less\ncommitted an easy way to tell who is\nless committed than the other in any\nrelationship is to observe who issues\nultimatums to whom now the point of an\nultimatum is to apply emotional pressure\non the other person to motivate behavior\nin compliance with your agenda"
