    "transcript": "I'm Dr O'Brien taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is who has\nmore power in a relationship\npower can be a touchy subject for folks\nmany people would prefer it didn't exist\nat all which is just another way of\nwishing that power imbalances didn't\nexist in relationships however power is\na fact of life and that's not\nnecessarily a bad thing as without power\nnothing would ever get done\nnow it would be far too simplistic to\nargue that men have more power in\nrelationships or that women have more\npower in relationships because the fact\nof the matter is that it can go either\nway and that's because it really depends\non the specific individuals involved\nhowever I have three easy rules of thumb\nthat you can use to determine who has\nmore power in any given relationship\nlet's get right to it\nfirst a working definition of power very\nsimply power is the ability to get other\npeople to act in the service of your\ngoals\nthink about it the most powerful people\nin the world do nothing for themselves\nthey have Cooks to cook for them\nbodyguards to protect them agents to\nrepresent them employees to work for\nthem they have the ability to make other\npeople move\nthat's power\nso here's my first rule of thumb if you\nwant to know who has the most power in a\nrelationship or family system all you\nhave to do is observe who moves the\nleast\nfor instance in many families the infant\nis the most powerful person in the\nsystem you can't reason with it you\ncan't argue with it you can barely even\ncommunicate with it it just lies there\nand cries so everyone else has to move\nto accommodate it it is pure emotion and\nemotion is a form of power\nin fact being so emotional that you can\nneither be consoled or reasoned with is\na strategy that many adults today have\nfailed to outgrow but we shouldn't\nnecessarily be surprised by that since\nno one surrenders power unless they\nabsolutely have to in any case the\nperson who does less is usually more\npowerful than the person who does more\nbut before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to make the channel grow and\nyou can also hit the super thanks button\nand tip me in proportion to the value\nyou feel you derived from this video I\nreally appreciate your support\nnow here's another way to consider the\nquestion\njust like two people cannot like each\nother exactly the same amount\nwhich asymmetry gives rise to the\nbalance of Attraction two people cannot\nbe committed to a relationship exactly\nthe same amount this is a hard fact of\nlife and a bitter pill to swallow we see\nthis everywhere but we would prefer not\nto see it for instance you may not be\nyour best friends best friend\nand your employer may not need you as\nmuch as you need your employer\nif you want to know who has more power\nin a relationship you simply need to\nconsider who is less committed\nthan the other\nI wish this weren't the case but it's\ntrue\nan easy way to tell who is less\ncommitted than the other in any\nrelationship is to observe who issues\nultimatums to whom\na few weeks ago I met up with Logan Yuri\nauthor of how not to die alone she's a\nlovely person and I had a fantastic\nconversation with her at one point in\nthe discussion we were talking about\nmarriage and she said to me behind every\nproposal is an ultimatum\nand we both laughed because I think we\ncould both acknowledge the truth in that\nstatement\nnow the point of an ultimatum is to\napply emotional pressure on the other\nperson to motivate behavior in\ncompliance with your agenda\nso it's powerful in the sense of my\nworking definition of power getting\nother people to act in the service of\nyour goals and it does this by forcing\nthe other person to move rule of thumb\none while simultaneously expressing low\ncommitment for the relationship rule of\nthumb two\nultimatums require favorable power\nimbalances this is why you never see\nultimatums among equals like could you\nimagine if your buddy gave you an\nultimatum like hey man either we're\ngonna hang out three nights a week and\ndrink beers or we are done because you\nare wasting my time like a real friend\nwould step up and know how to treat a\nfriend like how well would that go over\nyou'd probably think who the hell does\nthis person think he is\nand you would never see ultimatums from\nthe less powerful party like imagine an\nunarmed man demanding a group of\nsoldiers lay down their weapons or else\nthe soldiers would just laugh at him\nultimatums only work from the top down\nand this leads me to my third rule of\nthumb\nin any given relationship if you want to\nknow who has more power just consider\nwho has more options than the other\nif your employer has 10 other people\nlined up for your job who might be\neasier to work with then he's probably\nnot going to be very responsive to your\nconcerns or demands by the same token if\nyou are being actively recruited by a\ndozen different companies you're\nprobably not going to do anything you\ndon't want at your current employment\noptionality is power now the way\noptionality is cultivated in the game of\nromantic relationships differs between\nmen and women due to the fact that men\nand women are selecting for different\nthings however in both cases the key\ncomponent is visibility\nthe way that women typically maintain\noptionality is by being visibly\nattractive no matter what she says the\nreal reason she's not giving up her\nInstagram account with a hundred\nthousand followers\nis this it's a daily and visible\nreminder to all involved that thousands\nof men find her attractive\nshe may never step out of the\nrelationship but surrendering that\naccount would significantly diminish\nyour optionality which is a form of\npower and power as previously noted is\nnever surrendered unless absolutely\nnecessary\non the other hand the way men typically\nmaintain optionality is by being visibly\ncompetent\nthis is part of the reason why women\nfind men in uniforms of all kind to be\nso attractive the uniforms signify their\nowner's particular skill and competence\nto the world it's also why performing\nartists like actors and musicians\ngenerally have no trouble finding\nwilling Partners the cheering and\nApplause they receive while they are up\non stage is more than enough social\nproof of their competence and\ndesirability\nso if a man is neither a performer nor a\nuniformed professional it behooves him\nto find some other stage whereupon he\ncan be visibly competent to improve his\noptionality\nso there you have it who has more power\nin a relationship the answer is it\ndepends however you can potentially\nanswer that question in your own case by\nobserving who moves the least\nwho is less committed and who has more\noptions\non the balance of things these will\nindicate who is more powerful in any\ngiven relationship\nwhat do you think let me know in
