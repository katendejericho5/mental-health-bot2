    "transcript": "this might sound strange coming from a\ntherapist but I'm here to tell you that\nin relationships talking is overrated\nbut isn't communication the key to good\nrelationships yes it is however you have\nto understand that while all talking is\ncommunication not all communication is\ntalking talking is good for some things\nlike planning Logistics and it is\nabsolutely terrible for other things the\nmost common misapplication of this\nprinciple is assuming that if\ncommunication is the key to good\nrelationships then you have to talk\nabout everything all the time and that\nis absolutely not true a fair share of\neffective communication is knowing what\nnot to talk about and understanding when\ntalking is useless at this point in my\nlife I'm convinced that I could have a\npeaceful loving respectful relationship\nwith a woman who couldn't even speak\nEnglish"
