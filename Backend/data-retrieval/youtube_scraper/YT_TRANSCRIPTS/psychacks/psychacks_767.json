    "transcript": "presumably\nmale feminists would be dating female\nfeminists and in my estimation\nfemale feminists or in anybody of the\npost-modernist critical studies ideology\nanybody who really buys into it\num is not as well prepared for\nrelationships as they might otherwise be\nand the reason I say that is because if\nyou buy into\nthe critical theory feminism you know\nthe real ideological feminism not\nequality not equal not feminism it says\nwe're all equal not that but the actual\nideological feminism then what you're\npracticing over and over and over again\nand this has been broken down really\nnicely by people like Jonathan I hate\nthat you're practicing a victim mindset\nand you're practicing skills that don't\ntranslate well to a relationship so if\nyou're dating someone who is a died in\nthe wool ideological feminist if you're\nmandating this woman\nand this woman has been conditioned to\nbelieve that men are her constant\noppressors that she has really gotten\nthe short end of the stick you'll never\nmind the guy across the street that's\nbuilding the building and the guy who\ntakes out her trash and the guy who\nmaintains her sewer and the guy who\nkeeps her electricity on never mind\nthose guys she's been taught that she\nhas been grossly mistreated by the\npatriarchy\nwell\nif you're the closest man guess what's\ngoing to happen she's going to see you\nas her oppressor and if you also are\nprime to believe that you're her\noppressor this is a horrible footing for\na relationship because you've got\nsomebody who's way up here being the the\nrighteous victim and this other person\nwho's way down here who is the nasty\noppressor and ironically the victim is\noppressing the oppressor and I'm not so\nthat's one reason is is that men should\nreally probably avoid dating doctrinaire\nfeminists um\nthat you are going to be seen as the\noppressor at some point but another\nreason is just the fact that this kind\nof ideology\nand there are ideologies like this for\nmen too but this kind of ideology where\nI'm rehearsing the the notion that I'm a\nvictim\nwell what am I not doing while I'm\nrehearsing that what I'm not doing is\nlearning how to give and take with other\nhuman beings what I'm not doing is\nlearning how to have a healthy mutually\nrespectful relationship where we're on\nequal footing I'm not practicing any of\nthat I'm just practicing my Victim\nnarrative\nthat's fascinating\nI'm in the Bay Area and the Bay Area is\nsort of Ground Zero for a lot of this\nstuff and I've talked to a number of\nwomen personally who completely believe\nthat marriage in particular was a\nrepressive\ninstitution where the women were the\nproperty of the men and\nmarriage was an instrument of\npatriarchal control\nand they want to get married\nwhich is very boggling how do how do you\nsuppose they reconcile that that's my\nquestion to you because it's like I have\nyet to encounter\nI've encountered many women who\ncan say pretty much that perspective\nverbatim on the institution of marriage\nbut I have yet to meet one who says I\nrefuse to get married on ideological\ngrounds\nthat just fascinates me\nlike the woman I'm I'm thinking of who\nsaid almost those exact language she I\nwas at her wedding like four years ago\nI wonder if her husband so she's she's\ndying to enter this patriarchal\noppressive Institution\nit doesn't make sense to me\nno\nwell I guess one possibility is that\nmaybe she doesn't really believe it's\nthat patriarchal and oppressive\nbecause if she actually thought she was\nentering into bondage and I don't know\nwould she do it seems unlikely seems\nunlikely to me too let's let's take\nanother attack\num which is have you are you familiar\nwith the old Greek play list Estrada\nno man I went to public school tell me\nabout it tell me about Alyssa Estrada\nAlyssa strata I think it was written by\nAristophanes he was a uh he wrote some\ncomedies back in the day and this is a\nvery readable play\nyou know for ancient Greek Theater\nand in summary the plot is that there's\na bunch of guys who are just interested\nin going to war they're out all day\nthey're practicing their military\nexercises they're always going out on\ncampaigns they're just thinking about\nthe next like thing that they can\nconquer\nand the women are pissed off because\nthey're just sort of left at home with\nthe kids they miss their husbands they\ndon't want to be in a state of Perpetual\nconflict\nwhat's that\ncan I ask a question are are they angry\nbecause they want to go to war are they\nangry because their men are gone and\nthey want their men home they want the\nmen at home and I I think it's from a\nperspective of like I miss my husband\nmy husband should be spending time with\nme and the family at home instead of\nrunning around with his guy friends and\ntrying to kill and Conquer that's that's\nthe perspective\nokay and so the the women get together\nand they sort of devise a plan\nand the plan is that\nand and they had to like swear a Blood\nOath because if anyone broke it the\nentire strategy would fall apart and the\nstrategy was\nno woman would have sex with her husband\nuntil the husbands decided to stop the\ncurrent War\nand that happens in like act one and the\nnext like three acts are like\nat first the men sort of like laugh it\noff haha yeah that woman will be running\nback to me and my little man in a in a\nweek or two and that doesn't happen and\nthen you know the Men start to like\nWeedle down certain women to try to\ncreate some divisiveness in the group\nand that doesn't work either and then\nthe men get angry and then the Men start\nto plead and then the men eventually\nagree and there's a victory and the men\ndecide yes this war was stupid women are\nright we're gonna come home and uh the\nwomen all [ __ ] their husbands so it's a\nreally interesting story\nand I've experienced something akin to\nLisa strata while dating into the bay\narea I have certainly met and dated\nwomen who very explicitly\nwithheld sex or refused to date me\nbecause I didn't agree completely with\ntheir ideological perspectives\nhave you encountered that Sean\nwell I'm an old Mary guy but I've yeah\nI've certainly heard it yeah\nand it's easy for me to say from where I\nsit because I have a good relationship a\ngreat marriage with a wonderful woman\nbut you know my\narmchair assessment is good you know\nmake room for somebody to actually\nappreciates you see that's for sure no\nreal love lost there I I I'm thinking in\nparticular of one woman who worked as a\nlibrarian she works in the library\nsystem and I have thousands of books I'm\nan Avid Reader but she came over to my\nhouse and she saw that most of my\nauthors were male\nand she said she couldn't date me\nanymore because I didn't read more\nfemale authors than male authors my\nrebuttal is I generally read more female\nauthors than people read authors because\nI read so much\nbut it didn't make sense to me to choose\nbooks that I was going to spend time\nreading simply because of the gender of\nthe author I was going to read things\nthat were interesting to me because you\nknow it's my time and I should be able\nto follow my own interests\num and not according to her not\naccording to her but I think she felt\nvery\num justified in doing that because I\nthink there is a strain of feminist\nthought that says\nthat kind of has that list Estrada\napproach which is we can't reinforce\nmen's disagreement with these ideologies\nand the easiest way to not reinforce\nthat is to not have sex with them to not\ndate them to not give them opportunities\nfor dating and mating\nyeah the the flaw in their reasoning is\nthat they're not in a small Society like\nin the play they're in a big Society\nwhere a lot of women vote for\nconservatives\num so they're competing with the women\nwho actually appreciate men who have you\nknow who aren't apologetic about their\nmasculinity"
