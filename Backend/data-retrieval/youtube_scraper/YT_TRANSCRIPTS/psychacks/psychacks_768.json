    "video_title": "How to have a FULFILLING SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP",
    "transcript": "the way to have a fulfilling sexual\nrelationship is to partner with someone\nwho has more or less the same libido as\nyou do this is something that generally\ndoesn't change you can do all the\ntherapy you want you can have all the\nconversations you want but if somebody\nwants sex significantly more than the\nother partner that is probably not going\nto work out in the long term one or both\nof those partners are going to be\nfrustrated with whatever negotiated\ncompromise they hit upon so the way to\nhave a fulfilling sexual relationship is\nto choose someone who is interested in\nhaving sex more or less the same amount\nyou are and who ideally has worked\nthrough whatever baggage he or she might\nhave around sex and physical intimacy\ncontrary to popular belief it's not\nalways the fact that men have a higher\nlibido than women do it can absolutely\nbe the other way around however I would\nsay that in general men want sex more\noften than women do"
