    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow to see God if you don't believe\nso this is something of an ambitious\ntopic I want to begin by saying that\nthere are many different paths to seeing\nGod and that this might be one of them\nnow this talk is explicitly directed\ntowards those folks who are agnostic or\natheistic my understanding of these\nfolks is that they look around and they\ndon't see any proof that God exists and\nconsequently they find it very difficult\nto believe in something that they can't\nsee or experience themselves and it's\nlike fair enough without an experiential\nrelationship or without any empirical\nevidence God really does seem like a\nfairy tale\nlike it's a make-believe idea that I\ndon't know Comforts deluded people who\nmay not have the strength to confront\nreality on their own terms\npossibly\nbut today I'm going to help these folks\napproach\nthe idea of God and I'm going to do this\nby taking a roundabout route we're going\nto leave the issue of whether God exists\nto the side for now and spend some time\non a seemingly completely unrelated\ntopic namely the issue of whether\nyou exist\nand I don't mean you the man or woman\nthat other people can plainly see I mean\nyou the self that you experience\nyourself to be\nthe thought experiment goes something\nlike this imagine you're visited by an\nalien from another planet this entity\ndoesn't know what Earth is or who people\nare to this entity you are clearly alive\nlike a tiger or a monkey or a whale is\nalive but the entity doesn't see you as\nwell you\nhow would you prove to this entity that\nthe self that you experience yourself to\nbe exists\nas we'll see it's actually going to be\npretty difficult\nand to play out this thought experiment\nall play the part of the entity\nyou might be dismissive at first like\nwhat are you talking about Orion I'm\nright here in front of you you can\nplainly see me of course I exist and I\nThe Entity might counter well I see a\nhuman animal and organic organism\ncomprised of tissues and cells but I\ndon't see a self anywhere in which part\nof you is yourself located when I look\nat your organs I see only tissues when I\nlook at your tissues I see only cells\nwhen I look at your cells I see only\nmolecules when I observe your processes\nI see only chemical reactions and\nelectric impulses\nwhen I scan you with x-rays and high\nfrequency magnets and electrodes I see\nnothing that I can identify as a self in\nany part of your physical substrate or\nin any process contained therein\nand you might argue something like well\nwhat about my DNA sequence huh that's\nuniquely me and I would counter yes that\nis unique but your DNA is not you in any\nmeaningful sense of that word like can\nyour DNA tell me that you love true\ncrime documentaries or that you have\nunresolved feelings for your ex or that\nyou cry more than more when you're happy\nthan when you're sad you don't even know\nwhat your DNA sequence is and you\ncertainly don't relate to yourself like\nan inanimate string of amino acids\nand then you might say something like\nwell I'm talking to you right now\nand I'm clearly making purposeful\ncommunication who else could be doing\nthat if not me\nand I might counter well you are clearly\nmaking sounds but I'm from another\nplanet\nthis sounds like the clicking of\nDolphins or the chirping of birds to me\nyour communication could just be the\ninstinctual response to stimuli birds\nchirp because they're Birds after all\nnot because there is a little bird self\ninside them that loves to sing\nand then you might say well come on look\nI have an ID I've got a birth\ncertificate I've got a social security\nnumber you can see it right here that's\nmy name other people clearly see that I\nexist what's wrong with you\nbut I would argue that those are all\nscriptural arguments written by people\nwho already believe that you existed\nthey are hardly trustworthy sources\nbecause they already see you as a self\nfor some reason and that's what\nmotivated them to issue those documents\nand this can go on and on the fact is\nthat there's actually no empirical\nevidence you could give that would prove\nthat you exist as the self that you\nexperience yourself to be\nand that's what make this makes this\nargument so frustrating like we would be\nappalled and horrified if someone denied\nour selfhood but the fact of the matter\nis that I can't see yourself\nI can't feel yourself and I can't\nexperience yourself\nI just kind of assumed that you have a\nself because I have an experience of\nself\nbut of course a non-human entity might\nnot have a human experience of a self\nand so may not assume that one exists in\nUS\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message Word\nof Mouth referrals like this that really\nhelp to grow the channel and you can\nalso hit the super thanks button and tip\nme in proportion to the value you feel\nyou derived from this episode I really\nappreciate your support\nbut now let's keep going\nnow if I The Entity were to come down\nfrom outer space to observe humans the\nway we might observe ants or cranes or\nmackerel then over time I would likely\nbecome increasingly puzzled\nand that's because I would begin to\nnotice that despite being nearly\ngenetically identical despite being in\nmany respects phenotypically\nindistinguishable\ncertain individual humans behaved in\nmeaningfully different ways\nand if I were to observe these\nindividual humans over time then certain\npatterns to that behavior would start to\nemerge\nand it would probably be very difficult\nto explain these patterns like huh\nthat's odd this individual human likes\nto Walk Alone by the water\nbut this individual human likes to spend\ntime in crowded places with loud\nmodulated sound frequencies and this\nindividual human spends hours staring at\nthin strips of processed pulp covered in\nlines of dried ink and if I open them up\nor run them through a scan or examine\ntheir genetic sequences I wouldn't find\nanything that would reliably predict or\nexplain those patterns of behavior it\nwould just seem kind of random and\nmysterious\nhowever\nif I were to posit the existence of an\nabstraction like say personality\nthat I could not directly observe but if\nI were to assume its existence would\nexplain my observations then suddenly\nall that chaos and Randomness would snap\ninto order like oh this person walks\nalone by the water because he's an\nintrovert and this human spends time in\ncrowded places because she is sociable\nand this person stares at ink because\nhe's an intellectual everything starts\nto make sense\nkeep in mind that there is no empirical\nthing as introversion or sociability or\nintellectualism\nand keep in mind that these abstractions\nwere circularly defined by the effects\nthey are purportedly imputed to cause\nnotwithstanding we accept the concept of\nPersonality because it's incredibly\nuseful for a number of reasons in the\nfirst place it makes otherwise\ninexplicable and chaotic Behavior\nordered and meaningful and this makes\ninteracting with these individuals\nsignificantly easier because among other\nthings you can increasingly predict\ntheir future Behavior\nand it's these patterns of being say\nthat you tend to like scary movies or\nthat you commonly have trouble falling\nasleep because you're worrying about the\nfuture or you generally give people the\nbenefit of the doubt\nit's these patterns of beings that\nlargely constitute your own experience\nof yourself\nso does personality exist\nwell we could argue that there is\nabsolutely no empirical evidence to\nsupport the idea that it does and that\nit is only a mental construct that we\ninvented to make sense of the observable\nbehavior of others\nbut we could also argue that due to its\nconsistency and predictive ability it\nwould be really weird if it didn't\ngreat\nnow let's revisit the question of the\nexistence of God\nobviously there is nothing that you can\nsee or touch that you can point to and\nsay that's God just like you can't point\nto a cell or a bile duct or a toenail\nand say that's me\nGod is not a tree or a mountain or a\nGalaxy\nand God definitely doesn't show up on\nany of our empirical instrumentation but\nagain neither do you God doesn't appear\non an MRI any more than you do\nand God can't even be reliably\nidentified from processes what one\nperson views as intentional\ncommunication like speech or intelligent\ndesign another person might consider the\ndumb unfolding of mechanistic laws like\nthe chirping of birds or evolution\nand we certainly can't prove God's\nexistence from scriptural evidence that\nwas written by people who already\nbelieve just like you can't demonstrate\nthat you have a self just because you\nhave a driver's license\nand without God the universe seems\nchaotic unpredictable and random just\nlike humans seemed before we posited the\nexistence of personality in our thought\nexperiment\nhowever as soon as we begin to recognize\nthe existence of stable patterns and\nthere are obviously stable patterns in\nthe observable universe just as there\nare stable patterns in individual\nBehavior\nwe can consider the possibility that an\nunobservable and potentially\nnon-empirical entity is responsible for\ngenerating the patterns that we see\nlike self or God\nand we can also conclude that on the\nbalance of probability it is far more\nplausible that the assumed self exists\nthen doesn't exist due to its consistent\npredictive power\nlike without the concept of I explaining\nwhy anyone did anything would be a\nfutile and frustrating exercise\nthese Concepts bring order to an\notherwise chaotic profusion of\nphenomenon and they allow us to interact\nwith other people in the universe in\nmeaningful ways now is God these\npatterns or even the sum total of these\npatterns in the observable universe no\nbecause there is no pattern that can\ncontain the pattern maker just like the\nsum total of all your personality\ncomponents is not you\nthe sum total of say all the laws of\nphysics is not God\nbeing an introvert or more to the point\nbeing an introvert and an intellectual\nand a masochist and an idealist and odd\ninfinitum\ncannot possibly contain the totality of\nyourself which like a limit in calculus\ninfinitely recedes\nso the existence of an abstraction like\nself or God always requires a leap into\nthe infinite which since it cannot\nreally be comprehended by the human mind\nis essentially an Act of Faith\nit is an act of faith for me to believe\nthat you exist\nin the same way that it is an act of\nfaith for me to believe that I exist\nor that God exists\nand though the data clearly Trend in\nthat direction we actually can't arrive\nat that destination on a bridge of\nempiricism it requires a leap that can\nnever be substantiated\nbut I would argue the payoffs are well\nworth it\nso we see that the question of the\nexistence of God is actually very\nintimately related to the question of\nthe existence of yourself it's\ninteresting\nthe same arguments can be used to prove\nand disprove both entities and just like\nonce you see yourself you cannot ever\nunsee it on some level once you see God\nyou can never unsee it\nindeed once seen both seem the plainest\nfacts of existence in no small part\nbecause you realize that you had been\nlooking right at them the entire time\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you
