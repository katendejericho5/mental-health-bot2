    "transcript": "my general orientation to the men that I\nwork with is that a man should clarify\nhis intentions with respect to Any Given\nwoman in his life before he interacts\nwith her this allows you to have\ncoherence with respect to your words and\nactions and it makes it much more likely\nthat you will get what you want from the\ninteraction most men don't have a plan\nwith women Beyond getting laid and just\nto be clear I don't have a problem with\nthat as an end goal but if that is your\nend goal then you have to treat her like\na lover and not like a girlfriend or a\npartner on the other hand most women\nhave all kinds of plans for the future\nbecause they tend to have relationship\ngoals so we see this huge asymmetry\nbetween men's short-term goals of\ngetting laid and women's long-term goals\nof having relationships listen carefully\nif you do not have a plan for your life\nthen you are a part of someone else's\nplan"
