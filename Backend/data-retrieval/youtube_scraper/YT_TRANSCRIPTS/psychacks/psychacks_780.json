    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is men need\nto have a plan with women\nthis is a very very important topic for\nmen it's probably the primary reason why\nmen more commonly than women end up in\nrelationships that don't serve them my\ngeneral orientation to the men that I\nwork with is that a man should clarify\nhis intentions with respect to Any Given\nwoman in his life before he interacts\nwith her the system for clarifying those\nintentions is the subject for another\nvideo and the man doesn't necessarily\nhave to be explicit in Sharing what\nthose intentions are but you the man\nabsolutely need to know what you want\nfrom a woman before you engage with her\nthis allows you to have coherence with\nrespect to your words and actions and it\nmakes it much more likely that you will\nget what you want from the interaction\nthe fact of the matter is that most men\ndon't have a plan with women Beyond\ngetting laid\nand just to be clear I don't have a\nproblem with that as an end goal but if\nthat is your end goal then you have to\ntreat her like a lover and not like a\ngirlfriend or a partner on the other\nhand most women have all kinds of plans\nfor the future many of which you likely\nknow nothing about because they tend to\nhave relationship goals and those\nrelationship goals are often very long\nterm not always but often so we see this\nhuge asymmetry between men's short-term\ngoals of getting laid and women's\nlong-term goals of having relationships\nlisten carefully\nif you do not have a plan for your life\nthen you are a part of someone else's\nplan\nand while that doesn't necessarily mean\nthat being a part of someone else's plan\nwill work out poorly for you I guarantee\nthat being a part of someone else's plan\nwill not be as beneficial to you as\ncreating your own plan will when you\ncreate your own plan that plan will be\ncustom tailored to your needs and wants\nand that only happens out of sheer dumb\nluck if you're a part of someone else's\nplan\nso if men don't have plans with respect\nto the women in their lives but the\nwomen do\nyou can see how this could potentially\ncreate some issues for both parties\nfurther down the line\nwhat typically happens is that the man\nincreasingly feels trapped in a\nrelationship he didn't explicitly\nnegotiate because he just sort of went\nalong with the woman's intentions and\nfurther down the road when there is a\nmarriage or a mortgage or children isn't\nreally the time for a man to finally\ncome out and be honest about what he\nneeds and wants from the woman in his\nlife and this likely won't benefit the\nwoman or children if there are any\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like that that\nreally help to make this channel grow\nyou can also hit the super thanks button\nand tip me in proportion to the value\nyou feel you derive from this video I\nappreciate your support\nthe way that this tends to happen is\nthrough a phenomenon that I call\nrelationship creep\nif a woman has long-term relationship\nplans and it becomes clear that the man\ndoesn't the woman will begin to move the\nrelationship in subtle ways in the\ndirection of her goal and this usually\nhappens in very small behaviors the\nstereotypical example is leaving a\ntoothbrush at your house it could look\nlike scheduling a dinner with your\nparents or inviting you to a\nget-together with her friends or\nplanning a romantic vacation for the two\nof you\nand again none of these is necessarily a\nbad thing but if you don't actually want\na long-term relationship with that woman\nyou should kind of prevent her from\nsteering the ship in that direction\nfailing to do so means that you will\nkind of slide into a long-term\ncommitment and this is very different\nfrom entering into such a commitment\nwith purpose and intention which is what\nI would recommend\nin any case a lot of guys fall prey to\nrelationship creep and this is often\nbecause well\nthere's nothing too objectionable about\na toothbrush is there\nso it can feel hard for men to object to\nrelationship creep unreasonable grounds\nhe could also provoke an argument by\nholding that boundary the potential\ndownside for relenting is low and the\npotential downside of objecting is high\nso a lot of men just don't think it's\nworth it to say anything\nit seems like such a minor thing\nin isolation\nhowever hundreds if not thousands of\nthese little concessions sure tend to\nadd up over the years\nan airplane can be off by just one\ndegree and miss its Mark by hundreds of\nmiles\nindeed over time the plane can be\ndeviated off course to such a degree\nthat it will arrive at an entirely\nantipodal destination\nthat's relationship creep in this way 10\nyears can go by and if he's not careful\na man can find himself living in a\nsituation that is almost unrecognizable\nfrom the way he wanted to live\nagain this isn't necessarily a bad thing\nand it's less likely to be a bad thing\nif the woman is virtuous with high\nintegrity however it's definitely an\nabdication of frame and is likely a Bad\nThing captains if you built the ship\nthen in the vast majority of situations\nyou should be at the helm\nthe antidote to relationship creep is\nknowing what you want from women and\nremaining unswervingly committed to your\npurpose\ndoing so kind of allows the women who\ncome into your life the choice to either\nopt in or opt out\nand while this generally requires some\nhonest communication with the women in\nyour life it requires even more honesty\nwith yourself you need to know who you\nare what works for you what doesn't work\nfor you what you want what you don't\nwant without that self-knowledge and\nwithout the willingness to act in\nalignment with that Knowledge from the\nvery beginning of the courtship process\nyou likely will not end up at your\nintended Port remember men if you do not\nhave a plan you will be part of a\nwoman's plan\nand that will only serve your best\ninterests out of sheer done luck\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider becoming a channel member\nwith
