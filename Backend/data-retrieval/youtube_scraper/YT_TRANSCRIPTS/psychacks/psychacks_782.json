    "transcript": "hi everybody I'm Dr Orion taraban and\nthis is cycax Better Living Through\npsychology and today we're going to be\ndoing something a little different as\nyou can tell this won't be a short talk\nthis will be a longer talk and it will\nbe a talk with somebody it will be a\ndiscussion I'm very happy to say\num hopefully the first of many and today\nI will be talking with my friend and\ncolleague Dr Sean Smith\nSean is a psychologist who works in\nprivate practice in the state of\nColorado he also specializes in men's\nMental Health\nand he is the author of several books\nwhich I hope we can get to later I've\nknown Sean personally for a couple of\nyears and I I really respect his\nperspective and I'm very excited to have\nyou on the show today Sean so thank you\nfor joining me\nhey thanks for having me on it's it's an\nhonor to be the first interviewer\ndiscussion you've had on your channel\nand I think it sends a good positive\nmessage to the world because by having\nme on first you're telling the world\nthat you will literally literally talk\nto anybody so that's a good message to\nuh to put out there it's really not true\nbecause the viewers might find this\ninteresting it's like I actually was a\nfan of Sean many years ago and I came\nupon his book and I reached out to him\nand found some of his stuff on on\nYouTube and I reached out to him cold\nmany years ago and he had the\nthe kindness to respond and we initiated\na\ncollegial relationship since then uh so\nI I was kind of star struck by Sean when\nI first encountered his stuff and\num it's really great that we've been\nable to develop this relationship over\nthe years\nyeah so what do you want to chat about\ntoday Orion well I want to chat about\nwomen and I want to chat about\nrelationships and I know those are two\nof your favorite subjects and there are\ntwo that get a lot of air time on my\nchannel as well\nso I thought I would start by pitching\nyou a softball question that I already\nknow the answer to and then we'll get\ninto kind of maybe deeper waters but I\nthink it's an interesting question so\nhow how is dating\nlike the FBI\nthat's a uh you you pulled that out of\nmy book that the Tactical guide to women\nI think\num\nin the Tactical guide to women if people\ndon't know about it it's a it's a book\nabout relationships for men basically\nit's about how to vet women that you're\nbringing into your life and one of the\nthings I came across when I was writing\nthat book is the fact that the FBI at\nleast on their website at the time went\nthrough the steps that they used to vet\nagents and it's a very long process it\ntakes a couple of years and it happened\nto be what I think about in terms of\nvetting a potential partner if you're\nlooking for a long-term partner that you\nwant to build a shared Enterprise with\nyou need to invest that time to get to\nknow what they're really about and\nthat's what the FBI does they spend a\nlot of time watching people and that\nthat's part of vetting potential\nPartners too\nI mean it makes sense to me and this is\njust a couple of years\nfor a career if you're vetting for a\npotential long-term partner that's for\nlife that's that's an even bigger\ncommitment in my opinion than just\nsomething that you're going to be doing\nfor money\nindeed yeah as important as that is\num I often say on my channel that men\nshould exercise emotional discipline for\nthe first six months minimum and I get a\nlot of pushback on six months and here\nyou are saying that it can take years to\nadequately and appropriately vet a\npotential partner\nwell here's the way I think about it you\nknow we go through if you're if you're\nin a relationship a new romantic\nrelationship you go through this\ninfatuation phase and during this\ninfatuation phase of puppy love the\nhoneymoon phase whatever we want to call\nit\nmen and women both go through a period\nwhere their brain chemistry literally\ndeviates from Baseline and there's a\nstudy a few years ago where they looked\nat serotonin signatures in\num cerebral spinal fluid I believe and\nthey actually notice that when people\nare infatuated we're just seeing the\nworld differently we're not seeing\nourselves the same we're not seeing the\nother person the same not only are we\nnot seeing them correctly or ourselves\ncorrectly that correctly being the way\nwe normally see things but we're also\ntrying to present our best selves so\nthere's a lot of beer goggle beer\ngoggles going on while we're infatuated\nwith somebody and that period\naccording to the research can last\nanywhere between 6 and 18 months some\npeople say it lasts longer some people\nsay it doesn't but\num my thought is that you don't really\nsee the other person clearly and you're\nnot allowing them to see you clearly\nwhile you're in that infatuated stage\nwhile your your brain chemistry is out\nof whack and so\nyou don't really start getting to know\nsomebody on a meaningful level until\nthat period ends and that's when you can\nreally start\nassessing the relationship because\nthat's when the real person shows up and\none of the ways to know that that's\nending is the person becomes more\nthree-dimensional to you so you're not\nidealizing them and you're not being\nidealized so much like all the little\nthings that used to be cute and Charming\nmaybe they start to get a little bit\nirritating now so that there's two sides\nto the coin when you when you've come\nout of that infatuation phase you start\nto see things more accurately so we're\ntalking years really if you want to if\nyou want to spend a year getting to know\nsomebody after the infatuation ends you\nknow that that's a big chunk of time\nyeah and just to be more accurate when\nit sounds like you're saying is not\nsimply that you're not seeing the other\nperson clearly during that time because\nthat could go pretty much on either side\nof the fence it's that you're seeing the\nother person as better than they are\nright it doesn't seem like your mode\nevaluation period people suffer from\nthis person that I'm dating and sleeping\nwith is is worse than they actually are\nright the bias is always on one side\nyeah okay\num I talk about this in my channel I\ncall it the crisis of disillusionment\nand I think that most of that limerence\nand that feeling is really just\nprojected fantasy we know next to\nnothing about somebody except that we're\nattracted to them in the very initial\nstages of courtship and\nI think the mind abhors a vacuum and it\ntries to fill in the gaps in our\nknowledge base with exactly what we\nwould want to find there so that we can\nbe more in alignment with our attraction\nand what generally happens you know when\npeople talk about\ngetting over their exes and they're\nthey're coming to terms with like the\nred flags that they saw but kind of\nignored earlier on in the dating process\nit's like most of these\num these relationships that tend not to\nwork out there were I think a lot of\nsigns for for most people earlier on in\nthe in the relationship but people just\nchose not to to look at them but I think\nthat if enough\naccumulate over time or something really\njarring happens then the projected\nfantasy shatters and that's the crisis\ndisillusionment and then you got to see\nyou get to see the person in front of\nyou kind of warts and all it's only then\nthat you actually get to decide if you\nwant to have a relationship with that\nperson because you actually weren't even\nseeing who that person was up until that\npoint\nand\nthat's an interesting\num fork in the road\nfor a lot of folks\nyeah there's this term um confabulation\nthat clinicians use to describe somebody\nwhen they are recalling something that\ndidn't happen and it's not that they're\nlying so that this would happen for\nexample after a brain injury where the\nbrain parts of the brain are not\nfunctioning well or certain types of\ndementia and or you know alcohol\ndementia that that sort of thing where\nthe brain is physically damaged and when\na person is trying to remember something\nthat happened in the memory the sequence\nof events or some piece of History they\nwill fill in the blanks with something\nthat's plausible they don't know that\nthey're doing it and it's not\nintentional they're not lying but this\nterm confabulation gets gets attached to\norganic disorders and injuries of the\nbrain when really we're all doing it all\nthe time we're filling in blanks just\nlike you said and so when you're in that\ninfatuation stage you're feeling there's\na lot of question marks and you're\nfilling it in with what seems plausible\nand also what is positively valenced\nokay well let's talk about\ntraction then because it sounds like\npeople have a choice at that moment of\nwhether or not there's enough\nthere to continue to pursue a\nrelationship with the person after the\ncrisis of this delusionment or after the\nlimerence period\nwears off\nis is attraction a choice\nthat's an interesting question I'll give\nyou my thought I want to hear your\nthought of it the um\nthe emotional side of the Mind\ntakes a split second to decide that it's\nattracted to somebody\nand it could it's it's the visual appeal\nit's the scent it's the words it's it's\nthe whole package the whole presentation\nand this is one of the problematic\nthings about Tinder is that so much of\nthat gets factored out you're only\nseeing an image but\num the the emotional side of mind takes\nalmost no time to know that it's\nattracted to somebody the rational side\ntakes a lot longer to assess the\nsituation and so I think that part of\nwhat people are dealing with in the\ndating realm is that\nis that it takes so little time to\ndecide that you're attracted to somebody\nand it takes so much time to decide if\nthat traction attraction is warranted so\nI don't know if I'm really answering\nyour question as attraction a choice I\nthink there's an involuntary component\nto it but I also think that um you can\nchoose to some degree\nbut I'm going to stop there I'll come\nback to my other thought in a minute\nwhat do you think so far I think you're\nsaying that attraction is is not a\nchoice\nin the fact that the emotional mind can\ndecide within a split second whether or\nnot there's attraction it makes me\nwonder whether you can be rationally\nattracted to somebody that does not\nsound hot that does not sound sexy to me\num I think you can rationally decide\nwhether this person might be a good\npartner for you or a good husband or\nwife or mother or father\num but rational attraction I think\nsounds like a paradox to me or an\noxymoron\nbut I want to bring this up because it's\nsomething that I see with the guys I\nwork with clinically and maybe you see\nthis too\num sometimes for whatever reason\nmen's attraction can be\npretty predictably biased towards women\nwho for whatever reason are just their\nKryptonite\nyes and when men become more aware of\ntheir patterns of Attraction it can feel\nlike they're stuck between a really\nbad choice where they can follow their\nattraction which leads them to a\ndumpster fire relationship as it has you\nknow dozens of times in the past or they\ncan move forward with a woman who\nrationally sounds like it she might be a\ngood partner but leaves him feeling\ncompletely I don't know bored or\nuninterested\nand that seems like a a really tough\ndecision for guys so if attraction is\nnot a choice are those guys doomed\nwell I'll give you framework one\nframework to think about it but I want\nto Riff Off something you said and\nrationally attracted can you be\nrationally attracted to somebody seems\nimplausible imagine trying to be\nrationally horny for somebody that's\nthat's not going to work\nit doesn't make sense but I think the\nway guys\napproach relationships is so often from\na from a standpoint of desperation or if\nit's not desperation it's at least I\nhave to take what I can get which is\nmaybe desperation light because that's\nmaybe been their experience however they\narrived at this point where they'll look\nout on the landscape and they'll look at\nall of the the possibilities and they'll\nzero in on the hottest one and like you\nsaid so often the hottest one to them is\ntheir relationship Kryptonite\nrather than a different way to approach\nit and this is this is where um\ncultural structures like religions come\nin handy where if you change the\nParadigm a [ __ ] where you're not\nlooking out on the entire landscape and\nchoosing who's most attractive and this\nthis applies equally to women too that\nyou are clear on your own values and\nyou're clear on what you're building in\nlife and so you look at a smaller subset\nyou look at the the prospects that\nactually align with what you're trying\nto accomplish in life which is a much\nsmaller group it's not the entire\nlandscape it's a small group and then\nyou choose the the hottest one there and\nthis is someplace where um like I said\nif you're part of a structured religion\nthis seems to be easier for for people\nthat have that structural framework\nbecause everyone around them or at least\nthe prospects around them they basically\nshare the same structural framework the\nsame similar values and that sort of\nthing so there somebody who is\na part of a religious community and I'm\nnot pushing religion I'm just using this\nas an example that somebody who has that\nstructural framework they've already in\na sense if they buy into that structural\nframework they've factored out everybody\nelse and so they're only looking at this\nsmall group of people who would be a\ngroup who would be a good fit for their\nlife and then they're choosing the most\nattractive among that smaller pool\nyeah well what about the rest of us who\ndon't have a tight-knit religious\ncommunity to rely on because I think\nthat's a diminishing number especially\nyoung people in this country\nyeah\nyeah it's probably the majority of\npeople that don't have that type of a\nframework\nso and so my more difficult to find the\nset of people who already seem to more\nor less conform with your values and\ndirection in life and then choose among\nthem right yeah\nand that's where I think yeah that's 100\ncorrect and sounds like it's a case for\nyou certainly was a case for me it's the\ncase for most people but if you have the\nsense of exactly what you're trying to\naccomplish in life if you're if your\nvalues are\nbuttoned down and you have a sense of\nthe purpose that you're moving toward in\nlife and you have a sense of what it is\nthat you the reason that you even want a\nrelationship\num then\nthe people that will fit within that\nbecome more apparent to you and it\nbecomes more apparent who the people who\nwon't fit within your values your\npurpose your goals in life\nokay well that sounds like frame that\nsounds like a guy knows what he's about\nhe knows what his mission or purpose in\nlife is like he's potentially\nextrapolated to some degree a lifestyle\nfor himself he knows what works he knows\nwhat doesn't work for him he knows what\nhe wants he knows what he doesn't want\nand then he's trying to find a fit which\non some level suggests that he's\ninviting the woman into his frame into\nhis life into his lifestyle\nand I think that's a really good way for\nmen to approach dating I think\nespecially younger guys in their 20s you\ntalked about the desperation\nI think it could even be this sense of\num\nwomen\nalmost like\nas a savior like that a good woman will\nlike lift him out of his loneliness or\ndespair\nor be his Muse or give him purpose have\nyou seen this John yeah\nI one of my friends on Twitter actually\nposted this yesterday he he posted about\nbeing at a cafe or Diner or something\nand that he was sitting next to a man\nwho was in his 60s and the Man in the\n60s was explaining to the waitress that\nhis depression had finally lifted\nbecause he finally found a girlfriend\nwho would who would date him\nand and my friend's point was some guys\nnever learn and the lesson that I think\nhe my friend thought this guy should\nhave learned was that\nthe women are not the key to your during\nyour depression that's got to come from\nyou which I think is what you're saying\nyeah I think that there's I think this\nis part and parcel to idealizing or\nromanticizing women or and or\nrelationships that it's my missing piece\nor it will give me the reason to get out\nof bed in the morning it will complete\nme it will give me a sense of self I'll\nfeel like I'm a person of value because\nthis woman who I've invested with at\npatina of even godliness who knows uh\nsaintliness or virtue has deemed to\nlook upon me and in the context of that\nI now feel like a man I now feel like I\ncan conquer the world\nand I think what you're telling me is\nthat it makes more sense for guys to\nkind of like\nbecome men on their own terms and then\ninvite women into their lives further\ndown the road\nyou and I have a mutual friend\num mutual friend calling who talks about\nexternal external sources of validation\nKen Curry so who I'm talking about he's\nhe talks about external sources of\nvalidation and it's just it's a path to\ndestruction you can't have your source\nof validation depending on the um the\nmoods of somebody else or the the you\nknow their approval for today it's got\nto be that you're on your path and\nsomeone else can join in they can walk\nnext to you if they want but they are\nnot the source of your sense of self\nmm-hmm because if if you Outsource it to\nthem they can revoke it at a moment's\nnotice this poor guy at the diner the 60\nyear old guy girl's gonna break up with\nhim and he's gonna be right back where\nhe was feeling depressed\nwell does that suggest that men should\nmaybe wait longer to begin dating or or\npotentially to get into long-term\nrelationships because I think it kind of\ntakes longer for men to get their feet\nunder them women have just shorter\ntimelines they always they mature faster\nbiologically they seem to mature faster\nemotionally and they do have their\nreproductive windows so they they're\nkind of\nthey grow up a little bit faster than a\nlot of guys\nand if it would be good for the man to\nknow what his purpose is and to have his\nlifestyle extrapolated and make it\neasier to attract a woman who would\nhave goodness of fit with that purpose\nwhat do you think about the movement\nthat guys sort of like spend their 20s\ngrinding or getting their\ntheir [ __ ] together\nbefore they really maybe they're just\ninto examine women\nyeah or serious relationships but maybe\nthere's something to the fact that I\ndon't know the exact numbers but it\nseems to be across societies that men in\nlong-term relationships men tend to be a\nlittle older than women something like\nfive years older on average maybe that's\ntoo high maybe it's it's a little lower\nthan that but maybe there's something to\nthe fact that\nmen do take a little bit longer to get\ntheir feet feet under them the\nexpectations are different from men you\nare expected to go into society and\nproduce more than you consume if you're\ngoing to carry a man card meaning you\nneed to\nuh you need to be in a position where\nyou can provide if you're going to be\nrespected you need to be in a position\nwhere you're contributing some to\nsomething to society and women have\ntheir expectations too but it's not that\nit's a little bit different and it takes\na while to establish that and so maybe\nthat's why we see an age difference in\nlong-term commitments let's talk about\nthis because that's certainly the\nthe cultural expectation for men or\nlet's say masculinity is to be the\nprovider protector\nand one of the uh let's say one of the\npromises of feminism was that it would\nbe good for men\nbecause just like women might have been\nrestricted to caregiver nurturer roles\nhistorically\nwhich might have been restrictive or\nrepressive that men have also been\nrelegated to these restrictive and\npotentially repressive social roles of\nProvider protector and the promise of\nfeminism is that both men and women can\nexperiment with non-traditional gender\nroles and\nwhat do you think about that like would\nthat behoove a man to examine\nwhich part of that the promise of\nfeminism as I understand it is that it\ncould be good for men too because men\nlike women have been restricted and or\nrepressed by their traditional gender\nroles in this case being a provider\nprotector the other hand being let's say\na caregiver nurturer\nand I would say that in the last\nyou know several decades women have\nreally run with\nthis sort of gender role Liberation and\nthey're doing very well socially like as\nyou know they're graduating high school\ncollege postgraduate at a significantly\nhigher rate than men I think for the\nfirst time in history women under 30 are\nout earning men under 30.\nthey they seem to be thriving in a lot\nof traditional metrics of success\nwhereas\nI I'm not really seeing that when men\ndeviate from those traditional gender\nroles that they flourish does that make\nsense you know I'm not seeing that\neither it's very easy for a feminists to\nsay that a man should surrender that\nthat traditional masculinity and that he\nshould be more emotional and whatever\nwhatever they're saying at the at the\nAmerican Psychological Association about\nthe man box you know the man boxes this\nidea that men are conditioned to be\nstoic and and squash down their emotions\nand and just be these hard-headed\nknuckleheads\nit's very easy number one to\nstraw man that and say that you know\nthere was this man box and and to\noversimplify what masculinity means\num as you're actually living your life\nand it's very easy for a feminist to say\nit would benefit men to give that up and\nI'm not just talking about female\nfeminism I'm talking about male\nfeminists who burrow into a nice comfy\nbureaucratic position and at a gender\nstudies department or the American\nPsychological Association these guys are\njust contemptible to me because what\nthey're saying is it's okay for you\nOrion to go out and cry in public and it\nis okay if you don't cry in public but\nthey're not going to pay the price for\nyou going out and crying in public\nthey're not going to pay the price for\nyou surrendering\nyour um your masculine desire to go out\nand create something to use a little bit\nof that aggressiveness that they're\nalways whining and complaining about to\nbuild something in the world if you\ndon't do that you're the one who pays\nthe price you pay the price in Lost\num employment opportunities you pay\nunless the price and loss mating\nopportunities you pay the wise the price\nin loss of prestige but the feminists\nsitting over there writing the paper is\nsaying was is to your benefit to do this\nI disagree\nwell we play devil's advocate here\nbecause I can imagine that when women\nfirst started entering into traditional\nmale roles in society that they got a\nlot of pushback and it wasn't very easy\nfor them and maybe they\nI would think they absolutely\nexperience discrimination and\nall kinds of pressures to return to\ntheir traditional generals\num so I believe that if a man publicly\ninvisibly deviates from\nhis masculine role he suffers social\nconsequences but my devil's advocate\nposition is well maybe that just means\nthat we need more awareness and\nunderstanding just like maybe the men\nneeded about women entering into the\nmarketplace\nit's possible but I think I'm skeptical\nof The Devil's Advocate position because\nwhat we're really talking about is\nevolved adaptations from mating that are\n200 000 years old and we know what women\nwell we have very strong evidence of\nwhat women look for in men if and\nevolutionary psychology does a pretty\ngood job of of explaining this that\nwomen are looking for two things they\nare looking for the ability to do\nsomething in the world the ability to\nprovide and the willingness to stick\naround and actually invest in children\nthat's what women look for that's 200\n000 years old and I think that's a\ndifferent variable than women going into\nthe workplace because if an attractive\nwoman goes into the workplace she's\nstill an attractive woman it's not like\nmen are not going to mate with her or\nchoose her just because she's standing\nnext to them at work and if anything\nshe's going to be fending them off even\nmore what we see when men relinquish the\nmasculine man need to go out and create\nsomething is that\ntheir opportunities diminish\ntremendously\nokay well then I understand that I agree\nwith that\num\nyou're you had a you seem to have a\nparticular\num bone to pick with male feminists and\nI I find that phenomenon to be\ninteresting because it does sound from\nthis conversation so far I mean correct\nme if I'm wrong that it doesn't seem\nlike feminism\n[Music]\nreally advances\nthe\nuh goals of men like it doesn't seem to\nmake them happy or it doesn't seem to to\nget them better dating or mating options\nwhy would a man become a feminist\nI think it's a great mating strategy\nbecause if you are that guy who can uh\nit's like a dishonest signal in in the\nanimal kingdom where you have honest\nsignals of strength like a peacock's\nTales an honest signal of virility\nbecause it takes resources to generate\nthat tail you can't fake it but there\nare dishonest signals and uh dishonest\nsignals are lies essentially they're\nthey're the illusion of vigor and\nvitality without it really being there\nand I think that for a male feminist and\nyou know I know some guys are going to\nhate me for this and I have to say right\nout of the gate I don't care\num for um for a man to adopt a\nfeminist mindset and we should probably\nDefine feminism at some point because\nwe're talking about it as if we all\nunder we're working with a common\ndefinition so let's define in a minute\nbut for a man to take on a feminist\nmindset that is essentially anti-male\nhe is he's being sneaky he's saying look\nat me ladies I'm on your side that guy\nover there the guy that's working on the\nthe crane over there and actually in\nbuilding that building across the street\nhe's not on your side he's a brute he's\nhe probably voted for Trump you don't\nwant anything to do with that guy I'm\nyour guy I'm writing these papers about\nhow we all need to to take better care\nof you that's that's kind of a sneaky\ndishonest signal do you think these men\nare conscious that this might be a\nmating strategy\nI think some probably are to some degree\nand I will give many of them the benefit\nof the doubt they've been many men\nmarinade or you know they're marinating\nin this ideology from day one and maybe\nthey just can't see past it you know\nbecause they're getting it from from\nkindergarten all the way through college\nif they go to college they're getting in\ntheir entertainment they're getting it\nfrom Marvel Comics you know they're\ngetting all the female empowerment stuff\nwhich is fine it's not about being\nanti-female\nso maybe they just can't see past that\nthey've been told for for decades that\nyou're a good guy if you think this way\nyou're a bad guy if you think that way\nthat's really interesting what's coming\nto mind is this\nclassic season of Survivor the TV show\nI'm not a big fan of Survivor but I\nthink it's a fascinating game because\nit's almost impossible to win\nand in this classic season it was men\nversus women\nand the way it generally works in the\nbeginning is that there's all sorts of\nlike physical challenges\nand based on which side wins the other\nside gets weakened and I think through\nthe first maybe month of the season\nit was absolute Massacre I don't think\nthe women had won a single challenge\nversus the men and they were dwindling\nand yet the winners of that season were\nall women like the top three finishers\nwere women and I was like how is that\nhow did this happen because\nthe women could not out compete the men\nat a single event\nthe way it happened is that the women\ndrove a wedge between the men\nthe women\nbegan\nuh\nthey went to some of the lower status\nthe lower performing men in the other\ncamp and said look\nyou guys are going to beat us but as\nsoon as we're gone who do you think is\nnext\nyou think you're going to beat these\nAlphas\nso you might think you're winning right\nnow and you feel really good but there's\nno way that you're going to be\nMr Chad over there\nand so basically the women succeeded in\nnegotiating a block with the lower\nstatus men\nat a strategic juncture of the season\nand those that block succeeded in voting\nout the highest status Alpha men who\nwere the most threatening to both the\nwomen and the lower status men\nand then as soon as they were gone\nall of the lower status men were the\nnext ones to follow because the women\njust voted them out\nso it's fascinating isn't that isn't\nthat incredible I mean and the the\ndifferences between the two camps were\nso striking the men's Camp was running\nlike clockwork they had fire they had\nshelter they were well fed the women\nwere shivering and wet and hungry\nthey didn't have the Survivor Survivor\nskills to like\nthey were barely hanging on at some\npoint it would they they resorted to a\ndesperate strategy but it worked and I\nthink one of the\nuh so they they used fear to motivate\nthe lower status men against the higher\nstatus men but I think they also used\nthe prospect of\nI think they seduced them a little bit\ntoo\nso what the women lacked in physical\ncapability to mastering the environment\nthe men lacked in psychological ability\nto recognize when\nthey were being plotted on and\nmanipulated yeah those those lower\nstatus men were definitely I mean it was\nvery fascinating because one of the\nstrategies was to to play the the Damsel\nin Distress and the women would come\nover to the men's camp and say oh you\nknow we're so cold or so you guys are so\nstrong and you know all about fire like\ncouldn't you help us couldn't you just\nspare the fire it costs you nothing you\nknow it's like really kind of yeah and\nthey're they're their competitors in\nthis season of survivors men versus\nwomen so can you imagine a rival pulling\nthat card in like a sporting match or\nsomething like that in a boxing match\nbut yes uh women are generally much more\nAdept at let's say\nemotional and psychological warfare than\nmen I made an episode about this that if\nwe had a no holds bar No Holds Barred\nbar brawl between a man and a woman it\nwould be no contest I mean the vast\nmajority of men would just mop the floor\nwith a woman which is why we don't do\nthat it just seems like it's too unfair\nof a fight\nand to be fair that's generally not how\nfighting occurs in most relationships\nand the vast majority of relationships\nis not a physical fight it's an\nemotional or a verbal argument and the\nvast majority of men are completely\noutmatched completely outclassed by\nwomen\nthey don't they don't know how to argue\nlike women do they don't know how to use\nwords to hurt in the same way that that\nwomen do and that leaves them in a\nsignificant disadvantage so I think that\nit's really important for men to kind of\nI mean there's this there's this trend\nin in society like not be a harmless man\nlike to do you need to have strength you\nneed to have skills and a competent\nstrong man is\nit's not a heart it's not a harmless man\nhe could cause harm he could also he\nalso has the power to do good\nit's really the same power you know what\nI'm saying you have to have power one\nway or the other and I think it behooves\na lot of men to learn some of the tricks\nof the trade when it comes to women so\nthat they kind of know how to\nhold themselves in a fight\njust like it I think it makes sense for\nguys to to know how to like take a punch\nor throw a punch it makes sense for guys\nto know how to\nhow to recognize emotional manipulation\nand how to\npotentially\ntolerate and resolve their own\ndiscomfort that comes up in the presence\nof a woman's distress\nyeah you said so much good stuff there\nparticularly that last point maybe we\ncome back to tolerating distress but you\nknow this stuff starts in childhood\nwhere you can see boys and girls on the\nplayground and there have been studies\nabout this more boys are competitive\nobviously and and there's a lot of\ncooperation when boys are playing but\nthere's these little moments where the\ncompetitiveness gets aggressive and what\nyou'll see is physical\nphysical attack physical conflict with\ngirls they're just as competitive but\nwhat you tend to see with little girls\nis reputation destruction and that kind\nof psychological warfare and so they\nstarted practicing their trade very\nyoung and\num some just like some boys become very\ngood Fighters or very skilled Fighters I\nshould say some women become very\nskilled at psychological warfare and I\nthink it's important to say that most\nmen most boys and men and most girls and\nwomen are not interested in that level\nof conflict they just kind of like get\nalong and live their life and enjoy\nthings but um\nyeah and um I was also going to add that\nyou know I've worked with couples for a\nlot of years and I've heard guys use\nprecisely the two words that you just\nused they felt outclassed and outmatched\nwhen they were having an argument they\njust felt completely outmaneuvered\nverbally when they were having an\nargument so they're very much at a\ndisadvantage because they're not going\nto get physically violent you know most\nof the every guy I've worked with\nthey're not willing to get physically\nviolent and so women have this\ntremendous psychological advantage\nsometimes and I agree with you\ncompletely that it really benefits us to\nlearn how to use words\nI also think it's useful to approach\nrelationships from a universal\ndisarmament perspective so it's like as\na man if if we both recognize that my\nphysical strength is superior to you and\ntherefore it wouldn't necessarily be\nfair to to to flex on you in that way so\nI'm gonna I'm gonna disarm myself in\nthis way then maybe let's recognize that\nyou the woman might have more\nopportunity or or power or skill in\ninflicting emotional harm on me so\nI can't give up my gun if you keep yours\nkind of a thing does that make sense\nyeah yeah\num\ninteresting yeah you talk about\ncompetitiveness and you also alluded to\nthe APA so let's just make That explicit\nso can you share with us where that\nreference is coming from\nyeah that most people probably have at\nleast heard of it that the APA in 2019\ncame out with these guidelines for\nworking with boys and men and it was\nthere were some good things in in the\nguidelines and clinical guidelines are a\nset of um ideal practices for clinicians\nand so the APA will come out with\nguidelines clinical guidelines work with\ndepression and and pancreatic cancer you\nknow just all kinds of clinical\nguidelines and every once in a while\nthey get very political with their\nguidelines it's not it's not the usual\nbut the APA guidelines for working with\nboys and men and then some guidelines\nthat came out the following year for\nworking with girls and women very\npolitical they were feminist Dogma from\nthe ground up and and so let me let me\ngive you my sense of the definition of\nfeminism there's the feminist next door\nwho believes that feminism is about\nequal opportunities and equal\nresponsibilities and and equal\nprotection of the law and all of that so\nby that definition I I could be called a\nfeminist because I believe in in those\nthings but that's not the dogmatic\nideological feminism that is taught for\nexample in gender studies Department\nit's not the feminism that informed the\nAPA guidelines this comes out of the\npost-modernist agenda to pit groups\nagainst each other and you know\neverything is a power struggle and\neverything is is has to be seen through\nthe lens of power dynamics and victims\nand oppressors and so forth that that's\nthe feminism that I'm talking about\nideological angry it's not about\nequality it's about advancing women\nBeyond men because men have been the\noppressors supposedly for all these\ncenturies and now it's time for some\nretribution and some kicking ass\nyeah I would say that it's not relegated\nto gender studies departments I've\nworked with a number of young guys in\ncollege and I think at least a few of\nthem have even dropped out and what I\noften hear is if they're in any kind of\nhumanities based program generally\nhasn't\ninfiltrated the hard Sciences but if\nit's English or literature sociology\npsychology\num\nI've heard guys say that if they didn't\nadequately self-flagellate they were\nlike socially ostracized and that the\nclassmates and the teachers were openly\nhostile to and dismissive of their\nperspectives simply because they're male\nor a white male or a white straight male\nthe intersectionalism\nvery strange\nand this is what happens\nit's just explicitly sexist and racist\nit is and this is where I have to walk\nback my my previous aggravation with\nmale feminists because if that's what\nyou've been hearing your entire life\nthroughout your education that if you're\nnot sufficiently self-flagellating\nyou're a bad guy that's kind of it's\nkind of hard not to buy into that after\nyears and Decades of it\nbut here okay so oh yeah let's let's\nfinish this conversation because we were\ntalking about the strategy of the sexual\nstrategy of male feminists and I talked\nabout this Survivor\nwe could see potentially parallels\nbetween the lower status men and male\nfeminists\nbecause maybe male feminists also see\nthat they couldn't otherwise\nsuccessfully compete on an open even\nplaying field with the higher status men\nand so they might be pulled to throw\nthose men under the bus in the hopes\nthat once they're kind of out of the\npicture or eliminated from the dating\nMarket\nthat the women will maintain with them\nbut in the Survivor episode it sure\ndidn't work out that way maybe they were\neven led to believe that that was going\nto happen by the women\nbut they were the first ones to go like\nthe women completely turned their backs\non them as soon as they successfully got\nrid of the high status men who were the\nreal threat to both groups\nso I don't know correct me if I'm wrong\nbut I I don't know if the male feminist\nsexual strategy is all that successful\nlike our our male feminists swimming in\noptionality\nthat's not that's not the true that's\nnot the impression that I get and so it\njust sort of makes me wonder that if\nthat is a strategy even if it's been\ntaught to you from from a very young age\nat what point do you sit you say hey if\nthis isn't working\nthis isn't getting right and at\nfunctionality I want it's not making me\nhappy or it's not convincing my life\nthis isn't working\nright and presumably a male feminist\nwould be\nuh dating female feminists I assume\nbecause from what I've seen\num women who are more conservative\npolitically have no use for male\nfeminists\nthese women seem to find male feminists\nrepulsive and so presumably I'm speaking\nin generality here but\num presumably\nmale feminists would be dating female\nfeminists and in my estimation\nfemale feminists or in anybody of the\npost-modernist critical studies ideology\nanybody who really buys into it\num is not as well prepared for\nrelationships as they might otherwise be\nand the reason I say that is because if\nyou buy into\nthe critical theory feminism you know\nthe real ideological feminism not\nequality not equal not feminism that\nsays we're all equal not that but the\nactual ideological feminism then what\nyou're practicing over and over and over\nagain and this has been broken down\nreally nicely by people like Jonathan I\nhate that\nyou're practicing a victim mindset\nand you're practicing skills that don't\ntranslate well to a relationship so if\nyou're dating someone who is a died in\nthe wall ideological feminist if you're\nmandating this woman\nand this woman has been conditioned to\nbelieve that men are her constant\noppressors that she has really gotten\nthe short end of the stick you'll never\nmind the guy across the street that's\nbuilding the building and the guy who\ntakes out her trash and the guy who\nmaintains her sewer and the guy who\nkeeps her electricity on never mind\nthose guys she's been taught that she\nhas been grossly mistreated by the\npatriarchy well\nif you're the closest man guess what's\ngoing to happen she's going to see you\nas her oppressor and if you also are\ntrying to believe that you're her\noppressor this is a horrible footing for\na relationship because you've got\nsomebody who's way up here being the the\nrighteous victim and this other person\nwho's way down here who is the nasty\noppressor and ironically the victim is\noppressing the oppressor and I'm not so\nthat's one reason is is that men should\nreally probably avoid dating doctrinaire\nfeminists um\nthat you are going to be seen as the\noppressor at some point but another\nreason is just the fact that this kind\nof ideology\nand there are ideologies like this for\nmen too but this kind of ideology where\nI'm rehearsing the the notion that I am\na victim\nwell what am I not doing while I'm\nrehearsing that what I'm not doing is\nlearning how to give and take with other\nhuman beings what I'm not doing is\nlearning how to have a healthy mutually\nrespectful relationship where we're on\nequal footing I'm not practicing any of\nthat I'm just practicing my Victim\nnarrative\nthat's fascinating I'm in the Bay Area\nand the Bay Area is sort of Ground Zero\nfor a lot of this stuff and I've talked\nto a number of women personally who\ncompletely believe that marriage in\nparticular was a repressive\ninstitution where the women were the\nproperty of the men and\nmarriage was an instrument of\npatriarchal control\nand they want to get married\nwhich is very boggling how do you\nsuppose they reconcile that that's my\nquestion to you because it's like I have\nyet to encounter\nI've encountered many women who\ncan say pretty much that perspective\nverbatim on the institution of marriage\nbut I have yet to meet one who says I\nrefuse to get married on ideological\ngrounds\nthat just fascinates me\nlike the woman I'm I'm thinking of who\nsaid almost those exact language I was\nat her wedding like four years ago\nI wonder if her husband so she's she's\ndying to enter this patriarchal\noppressive Institution\nit doesn't make sense to me\nno well I guess one possibility is that\nmaybe she doesn't really believe it's\nthat patriarchal and oppressive\nbecause if she actually thought she was\nentering into bondage and I don't know\nwould she do it seems unlikely seems\nunlikely to me too let's let's take\nanother attack\num which is have you are you familiar\nwith the old Greek play lisistrada\nno man I went to public school tell me\nabout it tell me about Alyssa strata\nAlyssa strata I think it was written by\nAristophanes he was a uh he wrote some\ncomedies back in the day and this is a\nvery readable play\nyou know for ancient Greek Theater\nand in summary the plot is that there's\na bunch of guys who are just interested\nin going to war they're out all day\nthey're practicing their military\nexercises they're always going out on\ncampaigns they're just thinking about\nthe next like thing that they can\nconquer\nand the women are pissed off because\nthey're just sort of left at home with\nthe kids they miss their husbands they\ndon't want to be in a state of Perpetual\nconflict\nwhat's that\ncan I ask a question are are they angry\nbecause they want to go to war are they\nangry because their men are gone and\nthey want their men home they want the\nmen at home and I I think it's from a\nperspective of like I miss my husband\nmy husband should be spending time with\nme and the family at home instead of\nrunning around with his guy friends and\ntrying to kill and Conquer that's that's\nthe perspective\nokay and so the the women get together\nand they sort of devise a plan\nand the plan is that\nand and they had to like swear a Blood\nOath because if anyone broke it the\nentire strategy would fall apart and the\nstrategy was\nno woman would have sex with her husband\nuntil the husbands decided to stop the\ncurrent War\nand that happens in like act one and the\nnext like three acts are like\nat first the men sort of like laugh it\noff haha yeah that woman will be running\nback to me and my little man in a in a\nweek or two and that doesn't happen and\nthen you know the Men start to like\nWeedle down certain women to try to\ncreate some divisiveness in the group\nand that doesn't work either and then\nthe men get angry and then the Men start\nto plead and then the men eventually\nagree and there's a victory and the men\ndecide yes this war was stupid women are\nright we're gonna come home and uh the\nwomen all [ __ ] their husbands so it's a\nreally interesting story\nand I've experienced something akin to\nLisa strata while dating into the bay\narea I have certainly met and dated\nwomen who very explicitly\nwithheld sex or refused to date me\nbecause I didn't agree completely with\ntheir ideological perspectives\nhave you encountered that Sean\nwell I'm an old Mary guy but yeah I've\ncertainly heard it yeah\nand it's easy for me to say from where I\nsit because I have a good relationship a\ngreat marriage with a wonderful woman\nbut you know my armchair assessment is\ngood you know make room for somebody to\nactually appreciates you for sure no\nreal love lost there I I I'm thinking in\nparticular of one woman who worked as a\nlibrarian she works in the library\nsystem and I have thousands of books I'm\nan Avid Reader but she came over to my\nhouse and she saw that most of my\nauthors were male\nand she said she couldn't date me\nanymore because I didn't read more\nfemale authors than male authors my\nrebuttal is I generally read more female\nauthors than people read authors because\nI read so much\nbut it didn't make sense to me to choose\nbooks that I was going to spend time\nreading simply because of the gender of\nthe author I was going to read things\nthat were interesting to me because you\nknow it's my time and I should be able\nto follow my own interests\num and not according to her not\naccording to her but I think she felt\nvery\num justified in doing that because I\nthink there is a strain of feminist\nthought that says\nthat kind of has that list Estrada\napproach which is we can't reinforce\nmen's disagreement with these ideologies\nand the easiest way to not reinforce\nthat is to not have sex with them to not\ndate them to not give them opportunities\nfor dating and mating\nyeah the the flaw in their reasoning is\nthat they're not in a small Society like\nin a play they're in a big Society where\na lot of women vote for conservatives\num so they're competing with the women\nwho actually appreciate men who have you\nknow who aren't apologetic about their\nmasculinity\nyeah now in the Bay Area maybe not so\nmuch they may not be competing there may\nnot be a lot of competition\nideologically\num\nyeah I would say that most people men\nand women here are very left-leaning\nand it can be shocking for people to\nencounter somebody who doesn't\nautomatically parrot their beliefs\nthere's just sort of framework that\nwhoever you're talking to is on the far\nleft and we'll just sort of not an\nagreement to whatever uh talking point\nyou bring up in conversation\nthis is what I want your perspective on\nbecause you just mentioned that you have\na loving wife and you're an old married\nguy and you seem very satisfied and\nhappy with your relationship and\nI experience\na lot of men especially young men who\nare very disillusioned about women and\nthe prospect of a long-term partner\nand you often hear the phrase the juice\nisn't worth the squeeze when it comes to\nwomen\nso I was wondering if if you could help\nguys understand\nwhat good they could potentially get out\nof a loving marriage or long-term\npartnership and how it might be worth\nthe risks associated with that endeavor\nforeign\nyeah it's a question I don't know if I'm\nvery good at answering I can talk about\nwhat has what I have found useful about\nis that I have always been just kind of\na relationship guy I enjoy being in a in\na relationship and\num wanted to have a small family and so\nmarried a woman who also wanted a small\nfamily and we didn't we didn't know\nexactly where we were going when we got\nmarried we had a good sense of where we\nwere going and so it's it's worked out\nreally well and\nmost of the guys\nwho say it works well will tell you that\nthey got lucky and they they found a\ngood woman and\num my response to that is no it's\nsometimes it is a question of look you\nknow guys are guys are generally not\ntrained to choose how to choose\nrelationships I've asked hundreds of\nguys who taught you how to choose\nrelationships who taught you out of that\nwomen and the answer is invariably\nnobody we got to figure it out on our\nown and so for a lot of guys it is luck\nthat they just happen to be attracted to\nsomebody who turned out to be a very\ngood person but I don't think we need to\nleave it up to luck I think if you know\nwhere you're going you know what you\nwant then\nwe can develop skills as men for vetting\nrelationships and we can actually have\nstandards and this is a New Concept to a\nlot of guys that you can actually have\nstandards in the women that you choose\nand the relationships that you tolerate\nand um that that's something that just\nsome guys have never really thought\nabout so I think I'm getting kind of far\nafield from your question what what is\ngood about relationships\num\nit just depends on what you want I'm I'm\na clinician which means I tend to think\nabout individuals versus researchers and\nsociologists who think about groups you\nknow they think about force and I think\nabout trees and so when you say what's\ngood about a relationship well what does\nthis particular tree want maybe this\nparticular tree doesn't want a\nrelationship maybe maybe this tree just\nwants a different kind of life but if\nyou want a relationship you better get\nskilled at choosing that relationship\nbecause even though you can divorce and\nyou can break up sometimes the\nconsequences follow you for a lifetime\nit's not something you can easily step\naway from Once you develop the\nentanglements\nokay I hear that\nhow would I respond\num I'm interested in the idea of\nstandards for men\nbecause I can imagine a pushback\nto that would be oh yeah that sounds\ngreat Sean I'll have the high standards\non the two women who I have access to\nand when I apply them I'm going to have\nzero women so I just don't have the\nluxury of Standards so how would you\nrespond to that\nyeah that that's a tough one and I've\nthought about that question for years\nnow because that is a real question that\nyou're surrounded by a handful of of\nprospects and either they're of low\ncharacter or their High character but\nthe values don't match or for whatever\nreason the relationship doesn't work and\nso you know the answer is sometimes it\nreally sucks that\nif you're going to actually have\nstandards that you're factoring out a\nlot of good people but what's your\nalternative it's the alternative is well\nI'm going to lower my standards and I'm\ngoing to roll the dice and marry this\nperson who or you know connect with this\nperson develop some\nentanglements like children and mortgage\nand all these things with this person\nwho is of low character if that's your\nalternative that's not a great\nalternative to having standards and so\nthe answer is is not a very satisfying\none but I think the answer is that the\nthe more capable you are in the world\nand the more resourceful and the more\naccomplished and the more Prestige you\nhave\nthe more options you're going to have\nand that's not a very satisfying answer\nbecause there are a lot of guys out\nthere who are not doing particularly\nwell and it's not necessarily because\nthey haven't been trying maybe they've\nbeen trying their asses off or they're\nactually doing things well but they're\nin a position that isn't very\nprestigious like maybe they're yeah they\nhave a small plumbing company or\nsomething like that and they make decent\nmoney and they're well established they\nhave good values but that's certainly\nnot a very prestigious job\nno well it is to me because and probably\nto you because we're men and we value\nthese things but it's not necessarily\nwhat people you know people think of\nwhen they think of prestige they think\nof Bank president and so forth\num yeah I'm not knocking plumbers but\nI'm saying that most women aren't\nsending them yeah DMS when they find out\nthat they're plumbers\nyeah they're sending a phone call when\ntheir pipes are blocked but\num so to speak but yeah and that's where\num I think when you're thinking of\nprestige and accomplishment in life it\nthat that plumber who's doing well\nprofessionally he may not be presenting\nwell in his in his personal life you\nknow maybe he doesn't know how to dress\nwell maybe he doesn't know how to carry\nhimself well and these are skills that\nare easily developed much more easily\nthan learning how to plumb pipes\nlearning how to dress yourself learning\nhow to conduct yourself yeah these\nthings can be mastered agreed\nso uh\nI get what you're saying about the\nstandards and optionality\nhere's something that I've seen as a\nclinician and among my personal friends\nand it's somewhat surprising\nis that\nI've seen guys get married to women that\nI thought were not great matches for\nthem because they evinced something akin\nto like a biological clock and it\nusually happens around round numbers\nthey're like I'm 30 I need to settle\ndown or I'm 40 if I don't find somebody\nsoon it's going to be too late for me\nwhich to my mind always seemed like such\na feminine perspective but I see it\nfairly often with with guys like they\nseem to feel like they have to operate\nunder the same time pressure as women\nhave you noticed this\nI haven't seen so much of it but I hear\nwhat you're saying and I I believe that\nyou're seeing it\nyeah and now that I think yeah I have\nseen it out there and I agree with you\nit's it's not\nit's not a relationship it's not a\nperspective that men need to take as\nmuch as women it's it's very real for\nwomen because they have a different\ntimeline as you've mentioned ours is\nours is a little more delayed\nbut it sounds like you're you're talking\nabout guys who get a little bit panicked\nand so they they enter relationships\nbecause they're anxious about not having\na relationship yeah I'm bringing it up\nbecause it seems like it's just another\nform of scarcity so there's a form of\nscarcity like I don't have a lot of\noptions so I can't exercise adequate\nstandards but another form is I don't\nhave enough time so I can't really\nafford to exercise adequate standards I\nhave to just I don't want to be the old\ndad who's at the PTA meetings falling\nasleep because you didn't have a nap\nso I need to find somebody now\nyeah\nthe old guy that didn't have a nap yeah\nI've been guilty that once or twice but\num\nyeah and I I think part of the answer to\nthat is\num getting your sense of value squared\naway as early as you can as a man and as\ntough as a man because you gotta you\ngotta figure out what you're gonna do\nwith your life you know we wake up one\nday as young men and suddenly the world\nis expecting something of us and we\nhadn't really we haven't really\nbargained for that some of us some of us\nwere trained that we're going to need to\nproduce but some of us just wake up one\nday and suddenly we're in the position\nnow we haven't really figured out where\nwe're going and the sooner you figure it\nout\nthe less the chance that you're going to\nbe 30 or 40 or 50 and have this sense of\ndread that kind of missing out on\nsomething here that I wanted\nI see this a lot like about\na quarter of my private practice clients\nI would call like Failure to Launch\ncases and they're generally guys in\ntheir 20s who don't have a relationship\ndon't really have career prospects\nthey're still living with their parents\nthey often don't see the point they they\nseem all they believe that they're\nalready so far behind that it's like\nthere's no point in even trying to catch\nup they have very pessimistic and\nhopeless view of the future\num I'm sure you're seeing this more\nwhy do you think that is what what's the\nwhat's causing this because I don't\nthink this has ever been the case\nin human history\nyeah I don't know I wonder if it's been\nthe case\num it certainly has been the case at\nsome point in some place but I hear what\nyou're saying this is kind of a unique\nthing at least in in our society of\nAmerican society this is new where we\nhave guys who are really struggling this\nway and that's where I'm very conscious\nin fact when I say when I talk to guys\nabout having standards that when that\nguy hears me say have standards he's it\nprobably just evokes rage because he\nprobably hears me saying well just go\nout and buy a Lamborghini well how you\nknow I got nothing going on here like\nthat's that's a horrible thing for him\nto hear but I think guys um\nyou know there there is tremendous\nopportunity in this Society for guys who\nreally want to buckle down because and\nthis when you think about how I want to\nsay this because the expectations are so\nwell for men it's almost it's almost\nlike there's there's endless\nopportunities for a guy who\nis very smart and strategic about how\nhe's going to allocate his resources and\nso maybe going and getting a degree in\nsociology isn't the thing for a guy to\ndo these days but maybe starting a\nplumbing company is and if he can build\nother skills social skills on top of\nthat\num you know there's still there's no end\nof opportunity out there and I'm not\nsure what's causing\nthis hopelessness and this nihilism\namong so many young men\nyeah\nbecause while the world is still\ncompetitive\nif so many men are struggling we could\nalso make the argument that it has never\nbeen easier in the history of mankind to\nbe an extraordinary man\nyeah I think that's a much more eloquent\nway of what I was stumbling around\ntrying to say a minute ago\nbut the guy who's depressed and really\nthat's a lot of times what we're talking\nabout is a guy ends up feeling depressed\nand depressed as a non-specific symptom\nright it's like having a fever we don't\nknow what depression means but if a\nperson if a guy is depressed as a result\nof the sense that there's no way for him\nto succeed\ngetting out of depression is tough\nbecause what it takes is action and\ndepression steals your incentive your\nyour energy to go out and act and and so\npulling yourself at it you know I'm\ntalking to a clinician I know you know\nbut for anyone who doesn't it there's\nthis\nit's tempting to say to somebody who's\ndepressed well you just need to get out\nthere and you just need to you know you\nneed to get up and put your shoes on and\njust get out there tomorrow and that's\neasy to say but when you're in a\ndepressed state it's the hardest thing\nin the world to do\nand there's some truth to it I mean\nthere's there's the uh\nabsolutely there's the perspective that\nif you simply relent to the behavioral\nimpulse\nsuggested by depression which is\ninaction that the depression just gets\nbigger and you're feeding it and\nMarshall and talks about this in terms\nof opposite action is that if you want\nan emotion to diminish you have to be\nwilling to execute the behavior that's\ndiametrically opposed to the suggestion\nof the emotion so if depression is\ntelling you to do nothing to be inactive\nto withdraw to isolate on some level\neven though it's very very hard and\nextremely uncomfortable and it feels\nvery alien to you in that moment you\nkind of have to force yourself to do the\nopposite of all those things\nand to be willing to abide in a state\nwhere it feels inauthentic it feels\nstrange it feels alienating\nlong enough for like the dissonance to\nresolve\non the side of your action\nbecause that's why opposite action works\nfor them I know you understand this but\nlike if if you're doing something at\nodds with how you're feeling your mind\nis like this doesn't make sense there's\ndissonance there and ultimately it tends\nto give precedence to collapsing on the\nside of action because that's more of a\nreliable predictor of how you should be\nfeeling is what you're doing and we see\nthat when we judge other people it's\nlike don't really focus on how they feel\ndon't really focus so much on what they\nsay but watch what they do that's a more\nreliable predictor of of how they really\nfeel\nand what's really going on absolutely\nthat's all very well said and Marshall\nLinehan and dialectical behavior therapy\nit's brilliant stuff I think everybody\nshould read it because it's got skills\nfor everybody so yeah well said well\nspeaking of things that I think\neverybody should read I think that every\nman should read the Tactical guide to\nwomen which you pitched yourself but I'm\ngoing to pitch here uh I'm I'm not even\ngetting like an affiliate cut here I\njust think that this is a fantastic book\nI read it twice I've I've bought copies\nfor other people\nI can't hold it up right now because my\ncopy is actually loaned out to somebody\nelse right now but I think it's a\nfantastic book\nand um\nI think it's really really helpful\nand it provides a clear and systematic\nframework for guys to rationally examine\ntheir their women in their lives and\nit's the market\ndid not have an entry that did quite\nthat and I think your book does it very\nwell so thank you so much for writing\nthat appreciate it I hope that other\npeople will will check it out because it\ndefinitely deserves to be read\nI really appreciate that you got any\nlast words for us today\nuh no I'm always bad with the last words\npart\nI should I should prepare a list of of\nclosing thoughts I think is there\nanything else you want to pitch you want\nus to know about\ndo you have a channel if someone wants\nto get in touch with you how can they do\nthat anything like that I have a website\ncalled ironshrink.com it's a Blog that I\noccasionally post at pretty pretty\nrarely but I'm also on Twitter at\nironshrink\nand uh that's about it got another book\ncoming out September which will be a\nfollow-up to the Tactical guide to women\na little a little different angle on the\nsame question of how do you vet women in\nrelationships\nvery exciting I can't wait for that to\nhit well thank you so much for\npretending like you haven't read it you\nactually read ah I didn't enough you\nwere kind enough to read an early draft\nso that I can make some necessary\nchanges you gave me some some\nunbelievably useful feedback so when the\nbook comes out however good it is is 10\ngooder because of of what she had to\noffer there oh that's very sweet and as\nI said it was uh it was an honor to read\nyour Advanced copy\num it's going to be a great book it's\ngoing to help a lot of people\nuh so thank you so much for\nparticipating in this first experiment\nwe'll see how it goes uh and we'll talk\nsoon\nall right thanks Ryan bye-bye"
