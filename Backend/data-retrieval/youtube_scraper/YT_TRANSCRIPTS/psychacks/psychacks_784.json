    "video_title": "The COMPLAINT of modern WOMEN: the downside of being high-value",
    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the\ncomplaint of modern women\nso this is something that I often hear\nboth from my female clients and also\nfrom the women with whom I'm personally\nacquainted it's kind of a general\ncomplaint about the modern dating scene\nand it has two elements on the one hand\nwomen Lament The dearth of high value\nmen who are looking for committed\nrelationships and that is in fact a\nproblem\non the other hand women also complain\nabout the distasteful Prospect of\npartnering with a lower status man\nand on some level that might be the\ninevitable reality for many women in\nWestern society as they collectively\nbecome more successful relative to men\nwomen's hypergamy motivates them to mate\nand date men who are higher status than\nthem however as women increasingly have\nbetter educational outcomes as they\nbegin to out earn men as they occupy\nmore positions of power and authority\nthey will naturally encounter a smaller\nand smaller dating pool from which to\nselect appropriate men\nthe alternative is to resign themselves\nto a relationship with a lower status\nman\nand what exactly might that look like\nwell if she has a job and he doesn't or\nif she makes significantly more money\nthan he does that will likely mean that\nshe will pay for most if not all of the\nmaterial conditions of the relationship\nand if she has more skills and\ncompetence than he does that will likely\nmean assuming responsibility and\nAuthority within the relationship and if\nshe is higher value than he is that will\nlikely mean that the transaction of\nvalue and resources will generally flow\nfrom her to him\nand many women consider this scenario\nand they think\nwhat the [ __ ] am I getting out of this\nsituation\nI provide the money and the lifestyle\nand the responsibility what am I getting\nfor my time energy and money how does\nthis help me\nI'd rather just be single or pay a\nsurrogate to have my baby\nand hearing a woman talk like this warms\nthe cockles of my heart because once she\nfinishes venting her spleen I typically\nhit her with a line that never fails to\nmake her jaw drop and that line is\nwelcome to being a man\nbecause her complaint is precisely the\nexperience of men especially high value\nmen for hundreds if not thousands of\nyears\nas the man you were expected to provide\nthem money and the lifestyle and the\nauthority and the responsibility the\ntransaction of value and resources has\nin billions of instances flowed from him\nto her and there has been little to no\nsympathy for his complaint if he ever\nhad the temerity to voice it out loud\nwhat the [ __ ] am I getting out of this\nsituation and to be honest given\ntraditional gender roles he likely got\nmore out of the situation a hundred\nyears ago than he does today\nperhaps for the first time in history a\nlarge sample of the female population is\nin the position to occupy the role\nhistorically occupied by men\nand they don't particularly like the\nidea\nbut that's how it is the higher status\nyou are the more likely you end up with\nsomeone lower status than you it's just\nsimple math\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help the channel to grow and you\ncan also hit the super thanks button and\ntip me in proportion to the value you\nfeel you derive from this video I\nappreciate your support\nnow women\nI can understand you want to mate and\ndate with men who are taller stronger\nsmarter richer higher status more\nresponsible and more competent however\nif I'm that guy if you have to\nunderstand that my reward for giving you\nwhat you want is that I end up with a\nwoman who is shorter weaker Dumber\npoorer lower status less responsible and\nless competent\nnot a very attractive Prospect when it's\nput that way is it and that's precisely\nwhy you bulk at settling down with a\nlower status man being the boss isn't\nalways what it's cracked up to be\nand when a woman tells me well Orion I'd\nrather just not date at all than settle\nfor a man who isn't really giving me\nwhat I want I don't get angry\nall the power to you sister I like that\nperspective in fact I adopt it myself\nindeed more and more men are struggling\nwith this very issue this is the real\nmeaning of the oft repeated phrase the\njuice isn't worth the squeeze being the\nhigher status person in a relationship\nis very expensive while women\ntraditionally have been trying to secure\nthe best deal\nmen have resigned themselves to\nminimizing loss\njust keeping it real\nnow when a woman arrives at success\nshe is well aware of all the struggle\nand effort and toil she put in to arrive\nat that place her status and resources\nare not something that she is going to\nhand over lightly well the same is true\nfor a man he is well aware of the\nstruggle and the effort and the toil\nthat went into his success however there\nhas been a social and historical\nexpectation that men hand that over to\nbe the provider protector and part with\ntheir hard-earned status and resources\nand I'm not sure women have ever seen\nthat to be a problem\nhowever now that women increasingly find\nthemselves in a situation where the\nroles might be reversed the overwhelming\nresponses I prefer not to\nwell no [ __ ]\nand what does this Behavior say about\nhow women perceive relationships I'd\nlike to submit that they perceive\nrelationships\nclearly\ntheir behavior aligns with my own\ndefinition of a relationship as the\nmedium of transacted value between\npeople\nif you're not getting what you want in a\nrelationship if the relationship isn't\nmaking your life better than it was then\nabsolutely why are you in that\nrelationship\nand potentially for the first time in\nhistory a large sample of the male\npopulation is allowing themselves to ask\nthis question\nwhat a time to be alive\nso what's the upshot My Hope Is that\nwomen might use this as an opportunity\nfor some perspective taking this could\nlook something like well if I don't want\nto enter into a relationship where the\nflow of value and resources is from me\nto my partner\nwhy would a man be enthusiastic about\ndoing that for me\nespecially in today's day and age\nhow are we going to move forward\nbecause my own behavior reveals that I\ndon't believe that this is the\nappropriate basis of a relationship\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience please let me know\nin the comments below and if you've\ngotten this far you might as well
