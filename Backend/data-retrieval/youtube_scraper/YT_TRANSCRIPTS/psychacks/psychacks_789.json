    "video_title": "Are MEN and WOMEN being pitted AGAINST EACH OTHER?",
    "transcript": "in general women are seeing men more and\nmore as the enemy and increasingly men\nare seeing women more and more as the\nenemy and I think that this prevents\nhumans who might have way more in common\nthan you might think from joining forces\nand examining where is this really\ncoming from who benefits from turning\nmen and women against each other who\nbenefits from men being weakened on a\nsocial level and I don't think it's\nwomen women maybe benefit from that in\nthe most immediate or superficial way\nbut in the long run that can't possibly\nbenefit women for men to be weakened\nthat reduces in the medium term their\ndating and mating prospects which has\nimportant long Downstream consequences\nfor society and I think that also\nchanges when a lot of women become\nmothers a lot of this disregard for\nmales issues is part and parcel to a\ndivide and conquer strategy to turn\nwomen and men against each other that\nwill maintain the pre-existing power\nstructure in important ways"
