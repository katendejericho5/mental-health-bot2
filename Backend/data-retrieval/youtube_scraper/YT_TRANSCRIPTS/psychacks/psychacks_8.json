    "transcript": "in today's day and age sex precedes\ncommitment and in a Marketplace full of\nfree samples you can't reasonably expect\nto charge for a taste under such\nincentives the question is not why by\nthe cow when you can get the milk for\nfree it is why buy the cow if you have\nto pay for the\nmilk if buyers have a choice between\nbuying the cow or buying the cow and the\nmilk why would they Pur the latter\noption it's too expensive as there are\nnow two incurred costs instead of one\nlike what is so special about your milk\nthat you can possibly expect people to\npay for it when vendors all around you\nare handing out free\nsamples you can argue about whether this\nis how things should be until you're\nblue in the face but it's not going to\nchange anything this is the reality of\nthe Contemporary sexual Marketplace and\nit's probably not going to change\nanytime soon"
