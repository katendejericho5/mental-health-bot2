    "transcript": "when we feel like we're getting a good\ntrade that is when we're getting at\nleast as much as we're getting then the\ntransactional element is completely\ninvisible to us we're not thinking about\nit we're not talking about it and we\ndon't feel that it even exists we just\nkind of think I'm in this relationship\nbecause I love this person the\ntransactional nature of the relationship\nonly becomes visible and apparent when\nthings start to go wrong trust me if you\nstart to give more and get less you're\ngoing to become increasingly cognizant\nof that Dynamic over time and of course\nthat would only be a problem if\nrelationships were transactional if\nrelationships weren't transactional and\nthey just ran on love or Vibes or\nwhatever then it shouldn't matter\nwhether you were getting a raw deal the\ntransaction should remain just as\ninvisible when things are going poorly\nas when things are going well but that\nis decidedly not what happens"
