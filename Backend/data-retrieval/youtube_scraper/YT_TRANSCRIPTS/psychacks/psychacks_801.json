    "video_title": "How to talk about YOUR EX",
    "transcript": "this is the one instance when you are\nallowed to say things about people\nbehind their backs that you wouldn't\nnecessarily say to their faces namely\nwhen you say good things about people if\nsomeone were to ask me about my ex and I\ngave them a positive review and a month\nlater the same person asks my ex about\nme and my ex has the bad judgment to\ncomplain about me which most people do\nnow she's going to look unhinged this\nwill cause the other person to doubt the\nlegitimacy of that person's complaints\nbecause they now seem to be so\nunilaterally negative and therefore\ndivorced from reality they seem\nunbalanced whereas you seem reasonable\nand self-control who seems more\ntrustworthy this tactic is not a silver\nbullet it's not going to change\nsomeone's deep-seated impression of you\nbut it can move the needle in a positive\ndirection and it costs you nothing to\nsay positive things about people used to\nbe in relationships with and there's no\nreal downside to doing so with a lot of\npotential upside"
