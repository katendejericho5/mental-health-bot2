    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is talk\nabout people behind their backs\nso this is probably the opposite advice\nthat you've heard from other people in\nfact on the surface it even seems to\ncontradict some of the advice I myself\nhave given in previous episodes namely\nthat one way to be impeccable with your\nword is never to say anything behind\nsomeone's back that you wouldn't be\nwilling to say to that person's face and\nI stand by that that is generally a good\napproach to dealing with gossip and\ninterpersonal relationships however\ntoday I'll be talking about an advanced\ntactic\nif you're not ready for it just stick to\nthe previous orientation it will serve\nyou well but if you're ready for the\nnext level there is a way in which you\nabsolutely should talk about people\nbehind their backs and this is\nespecially true when talking about\npeople you used to have relationships\nwith exes old roommates former business\npartners in all these cases\nyou should talk\npositively about people behind their\nbacks\nlet me explain in the first place you\nshould never complain about anyone you\nwere previously in a relationship with\noutside of a very small trusted circle\nof confidence there are a number of\nreasons for this one of those reasons is\nthat those complaints no matter how\nJustified or true they may be generally\nfind their way back to the ears of the\npeople they refer to and now you have an\ninterpersonal conflict by proxy and\nthat's going to make your life more\ndifficult than it needs to be\nanother one of the reasons why you\nshould never complain about someone you\nused to have a relationship with is\nyou chose them that's your\nex-girlfriend that's your former\nbusiness partner that's your old\nroommate you're the one who entered into\nthe relationship with them of your free\nand spontaneous will by complaining\nabout people used to have relationships\nwith you're basically advertising I am a\nbad judge of character\nI don't know how to vet women\nI am easily exploited\nnone of which are judgments that you\nreally want to have associated with you\nin the minds of others so don't\nTelegraph your mistakes\nand three it tends to make you look\nunhinged\nif you start talking about how your ex\nwas a narcissist or your business\npartners were corrupt\nEtc\neven if it's true\nyou're going to look like you still\nhaven't gotten over it\nyou think you're talking about other\npeople but in that moment you're really\njust spouting unmitigated negativity\nwhich is not a good look and it's\nunlikely to win you any support anyway\nso this is why I generally say it's not\na good idea to talk about people behind\ntheir backs now before I go any further\nif you're liking what you're hearing\nplease consider sending this video to\nsomeone who might benefit from its\nmessage it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike that that really help to grow this\nChannel and if you're thinking about\ngoing to grad school be sure to check\nout my top rated GRE self-study program\nat Stellar gre.com you can use the\ncoupon code psych for 10 off all\nmembership plans\nbut we're here today for the advanced\ntactic this is the one instance when you\nare allowed to say things about people\nbehind their backs that you wouldn't\nnecessarily say to their faces namely\nwhen you say good things about these\npeople this is an advanced strategy\nbecause well\nit's really hard for people to say nice\nthings about people that used to have\nrelationships with sometimes especially\nwhen they are still feeling anger or\nresentment or disappointment\nnow to do this we don't ever want to lie\nif you can't do this honestly and\nauthentically stick to the general\norientation however in the vast majority\nof cases you should be able to identify\nat least one thing that you appreciated\nabout that person or that you enjoyed\nabout that relationship\ngreat focus on that one thing and if\nyou're ever asked about that person or\nthat relationship this is what you can\ndiscuss my ex\nbest thing about her was that she had\ndinner on the table waiting for me every\nnight when I came home from work I loved\nthat I haven't heard from her in a while\nwe decided to take different paths\nthrough life hope she's doing well\nnow the path that she may have taken\ncould have been narcissistic sociopathy\nbut do we really need to talk about that\nall these years later\ntalking positively about people behind\ntheir backs especially if there was some\nkind of falling out between the two of\nyou does a number of things\nlike the complaints the positive words\ntend to find a way back to the ears of\nthose they refer to and hearing the\npositivity is going to put them in a\nstrange place\nlearning that someone used to have a\nrelationship with and you had a falling\nout with is talking about you\nbehind your back kind of confirms your\nbelief about them and your perception of\nthe relationship however if the gossip\nis positive\nit creates a dissonance inside of people\nlike\nmy ex said that\nreally that is\nnot what I expected it causes people to\nkind of doubt their own perception and\nmemory and to create an opportunity for\nthem to form a new conceptualization of\nyou in their minds but here's the real\nreason\nif someone were to ask me about my ex\nand I gave them a positive review and a\nmonth later the same person asks my ex\nabout me\nand my ex has the bad judgment to\ncomplain about me which most people do\nnow she's going to look unhinged\neven of her complaints about me were\ncompletely valid\nthe other person is going to respond\nwith something like huh well that's\nreally interesting you know I talked to\nOrion last month and he had nothing but\npositive things to say about your time\ntogether huh\nthis will cause the other person to\ndoubt the legitimacy\nof that person's complaints because they\nnow seem to be so unilaterally negative\nand therefore divorced from reality they\nseem unhinged and unbalanced whereas you\nseem reasonable and self-controlled\nwho seems more trustworthy\nnow this tactic is not a silver bullet\nit's not going to change someone's\ndeep-seated impression of you but it can\nmove the needle in a positive direction\nand it's absolutely free PR it costs you\nnothing to say positive things about\npeople used to be in relationships with\nand there's no real downside to doing so\nwith a lot of potential upside this is\nwhat makes it an advanced and effective\ninterpersonal strategy give it a shot\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar
