    "video_title": "A paradox of RISKY BEHAVIOR",
    "transcript": "you've probably been out at a bar on a\nFriday night and at some point you've\nlikely seen a friend of yours take\noffense at something somebody said and\nthis guy jumps up and starts acting\nreally aggressively and making\nthreatening comments and gestures while\nyou and your friends are holding them\nback from an escalating conflict and the\nbasic message of this guy's behavior is\nyou're lucky my friends are here because\nif they were I would wake you up if that\nsame interaction had occurred and he\ndidn't have his friends there to hold\nhim back he almost certainly would not\nhave jumped up and acted as aggressively\nas he did in the first scenario he was\nable to act more aggressively and to\nretain his self-image as a force to be\nreckoned with because he knew there was\na limiter in place to restrain his\nbehavior and that limiter actually made\nhim feel safer in that situation and\nthis is paradoxical of course because he\nwas acting much more aggressively which\nis a much riskier Behavior he felt safer\nso he acted riskier"
