    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why\npeople self-sabotage\nso this is a topic that has been\nrequested by many people over the last\nseveral months so I'm happy to finally\nbe doing an episode about it\nself-sabotage is a really complex\nBehavior so I can't pretend that this\nexplanation will cover every aspect of\nthat behavior that said I do think that\nit speaks to let's say the emotional\ncore of what self-sabotage is and at its\ncore self-sabotage is a self-defense\nstrategy\nlet me explain what I mean by that\nso you've probably been out at a bar on\na Friday night and at some point you've\nlikely seen a friend of yours take\noffense at something somebody said and\nthis guy jumps up and starts acting\nreally aggressively and making\nthreatening comments and gestures while\nyou and your friends are holding them\nback from an escalating conflict\nand the basic message of this guy's\nbehavior is hey man you're lucky my\nfriends are here because if they weren't\nI would you up\nthat's the message of his behavior\nbut the fact of the matter is if that\nsame interaction had occurred and that\nman was alone\nand he didn't have his friends there to\nhold him back he almost certainly would\nnot have jumped up and acted as\naggressively as he did in the first\nscenario he was able to act more\naggressively and to retain his\nself-image as a force to be reckoned\nwith because he knew there was a limiter\nin place to restrain his behavior and\nthat limiter actually made him feel\nsafer in that situation and this is\nparadoxical of course because he was\nacting much more aggressively which is a\nmuch riskier Behavior he felt safer so\nhe acted riskier\nwe see this happen in a lot of different\ncontexts for example when people\npractice martial arts in pads they\nsuffer more frequent injuries than when\nthey Spar without pads the pads give\nmany people the false sense of security\nand they end up putting themselves In\nHarm's Way thinking that they're\ninvulnerable and by the same token the\nstrikers feel like they can add more\nForce to their blows without consequence\nand when you put two and two together\nyou have the perfect conditions for an\ninjury so what does this have to do with\nself-sabotage self-sabotage is basically\na way of communicating potentially to\nother people but really to yourself\nif only my friends weren't here\nif only my friends weren't here I would\nfeel your blood on my hands tonight\nif only I weren't being held back\nyou would see how powerful I really am\nif only\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to grow the channel and if\nyou're thinking about going to grad\nschool of course you have to check out\nmy top rated GRE self-study program at\nStellar gre.com you can use the coupon\ncode psych for 10 off all membership\nplans\nnow in my little Ballroom example\nblaming his friends for holding him back\nis a way for that person to protect his\nego which had recently been threatened\nfrom a confrontation with reality\nif those friends had not been there and\nthat man was acting a fool and a fight\nactually had occurred there's every\npossibility that he would have been\nhanded his ass\nand that would have been painful in more\nways than one reality can be very\npainful and very humbling especially\nfrom the perspective of the ego which\nwould prefer to believe that it's very\npowerful or very charismatic or very\nintelligent or very competent or very\nfunny or very attractive or very what\nhave you\nof course when we actually are those\nthings we generally don't create\nobstacles in the demonstration of our\nvirtues\nbut when we're not so sure we're subject\nto protecting ourselves from learning\nthe hard way that we're not as powerful\ncharismatic intelligent competent funny\nor attractive as we might think we are\nby avoiding contact with reality\nand we do that by putting things in our\nway like the friends in the bar\nthat hold us back that way we don't\nactually have to fight\nand potentially lose\ncell sabotage is a way for folks to\nprotect their egos by preventing contact\nwith reality because reality will let us\nknow just how powerful or intelligent or\nattractive we really are\nand because their egos were prevented\nfrom coming into contact with reality\npeople can still operate under the\nfantasy that they are powerful or\nintelligent or attractive or whatever\nthe limiter prevents the potentially\ndisconfirming experience with reality\nwhich is why self-sabotage is protective\nit's protective of the ego's narcissism\nand this creates a measure of comfort\nfor people specifically the comfort of\ncontrol\nself-sabotage allows people to control\nwhen they fail\nand that makes people feel better\nbecause as painful as it is to make\nthemselves fail\nit's still less painful than failing on\nsomeone else's terms which can include\ntrying as hard as you can\nand still failing\nthat would not only be painful but it\nwould disabuse them of the fantasies\nthat they would prefer to continue to\nentertain about themselves so it's at\nleast twice as hard\nand because they feel some measure of\ncomfort in being in control of their\nfailure self-sabotagers like the Martial\nArts students who Spar in pads or the\nguy being held back by his friends in\nthe bar actually end up engaging in\nriskier Behavior because they feel safer\nand so we typically see people engage in\nRisky behavior when they're\nself-sabotaging abusing drugs and\nalcohol picking fights in their Intimate\nRelationships shutting down and\nwithdrawing Whenever there is a\ndifficulty\nand these behaviors allow people to\npreserve a Fantastical self-concept by\nprotecting their ego from disconfirming\nexperiences with reality\nlike I said it's a fascinating\nphenomenon\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel we're full\nof good content here at psych
