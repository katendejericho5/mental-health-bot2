    "transcript": "where have all the good men gone I think\nwe've all heard this at one point in our\nlives potentially some of the more\nvirtuous and masculine traits that we\nassociate with men on some level get\nweeded out of the gene pool because\nthose men are more likely to go off and\nget themselves killed by having an\nadventure whereas maybe some of the\nMeeker more feminine men stay at home\nand they're the ones who actually end up\nreproducing with the women but the other\nside of that coin is if a man goes off\non an adventure and he comes back with\ntreasure and fame there's a very good\nchance that he is going to be a very\nsuccessful reproducer I think it's true\nthat Genghis Khan is the direct\ndescendant of one out of 200 men on the\nplanet today yeah a lot of this gets\nweeded out but if you actually are the\nadventuresome God and you come back you\ncan make a huge impact and your genes\ncan redound throughout history for me\nthe question of where all the good men\nhave gone has less to do with genes and\nit has much more to do with culture"
