    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and\ntoday we'll be doing another sponsored\nepisode so these formats are a bit\ndifferent I'm going to read the email\nthat I received from the sponsor and\nthen sort of Riff on the themes\ncontained therein so let's get right to\nit so this one is coming from RP Mentor\nTokyo\nand his question is\na good question\nuh where have all the good men gone\nyou hear this as a complaint among women\nwhen they're looking for sexual partners\nspecifically somebody to have children\nwith\nI think we've all heard this at one\npoint in our lives\nand uh in providing relevant context he\nincluded this quote from\nsocial psychologist Roy bum Meister\nwho wrote\nfor women throughout history and\npre-history the odds of reproducing have\nbeen pretty good\nlater in this talk we will ponder things\nlike why was it so rare for a hundred\nwomen to get together and build a ship\nand sail off to explore unknown regions\nwhereas men have fairly regularly done\nsuch things\nbut Taking Chances like that would be\nstupid from the perspective of a\nbiological organism seeking to reproduce\nthey might drown or be killed by Savages\nor catch a disease for women the optimal\nthing is to do is to go along with the\ncrowd be nice\nplay it safe\nthe odds are good that men will come\nalong and offer sex and you'll be able\nto have babies all that matters is\nchoosing the best offer we're descended\nfrom women who played it safe so there's\na number of themes in here that I've\ntouched on in previous episodes\nfor example all that matters is choosing\nthe best offer that fits very well with\nmy episode women treat men the way men\ntreat jobs which is a way for men to\nkind of\nacclimate emotionally to the idea of\nfemale hypergamy without taking it\npersonally\nit sounds like this quote\nI think what the sponsor is getting at\nis potentially some of the more virtuous\nand masculine traits that we associate\nwith men that the Daring Do the Courage\nthe adventuresomeness the the boldness\nthe strength on some level they get\nweeded out of the gene pool because\nthose men are more likely to go off and\nget themselves killed by having an\nadventure\nwhereas maybe some of the Meeker more\nfeminine men stay at home and they're\nthe ones who actually end up reproducing\nwith the women\nand so over time a lot of our uh\nstrongest masculine traits sort of get\nevolutionary they get select naturally\nselected out of the gene pool and I\nthink that there's probably some some\ntruth to that\num\nwomen have more children than men do\nthroughout history for precisely that\nreason it's much more likely for a woman\nto reproduce than a man for instance but\nthe other side of that coin is that if a\nman goes off on an adventure and he\ncomes back\nwith treasure and loot and fame he just\nhit the jackpot and there's a very good\nchance that he is going to be a very\nsuccessful uh reproducer from an\nevolutionary standpoint\num we might not think of him as very\nvirtuous or kind but I think it's true\nthat Genghis Khan is the direct\ndescendant of one out of 200 men on the\nplanet today\nso he was one of History's Greatest\nevolutionary success stories from the\nstandpoint of actually reproducing his\ngenetic material and so that's that's\nkind of why I think Bob meister's\nperspective sort of gets balanced is\nthat yeah a lot of this gets weeded out\nbut if you actually are the\nadventuresome guy you come and you come\nback you can make a huge impact on the\nfemale population and your genes can\nredound throughout history so it might\nend up being like six of one half a\ndozen of the other though of course\nthere are fewer Big Winners if you're a\nman which means that there's probably\nless genetic variability with respect to\nthis kind of thing so it's an\ninteresting point\nfor me the question of where all the\ngood men have gone\nhas less to do with genes and has less\nto do with natural selection or\nevolutionary pressures and it has much\nmuch more to do with culture it has much\nmuch more to do with learning\nand I think it's fairly fair to say that\na lot of what we consider to be\ntraditional healthy masculinity is under\nattack in the west I don't think that\nwill come as much of a surprise to many\nof the people listening to this channel\num and it's important to understand that\na culture\ncan go extinct in three generations\ngrandparent to parent parent to son or\nchild if that culture is not transmitted\nacross those three generations the\nfourth one\nit's it's gone it's it's almost\nIrreplaceable at that point\nso what we have to understand is that\nit's not that so much that good men have\ngone like they've left\nas it is that fewer good men are being\ncreated with each subsequent generation\nbecause it's under masculinity is under\nattack from a great deal of social\ninstitutional pressures in the West in\nparticular\nso I I think that\nand this is especially important for the\nwomen out there to listen to and to pay\nattention to\nbecause the same woman\nwho might be complaining about boys\nRough and Tumble play or\num potentially the patriarchy they might\nalso be wondering where all the good men\nhave gone\nand the way that women raise their\nchildren will end up being the fathers\nand husbands of the Next Generation\nand on some level it behooves women to\nraise boys in a way not so that they're\nobedient and compliant children\nbut so that they can become\nthey can grow up to be the men that they\nthemselves\nwould desire in a husband and a father\nthat's sort of a woman's a mother's\ngreatest success in raising boys\nis not\nto make nice boys but to raise good men\nand this requires the adult mothers to\nexamine some of their beliefs about men\nand women and power and masculinity and\nfemininity and these can be very fraught\nideas and Concepts in today's day and\nage they don't have to be but they are\nso it's really important to be\nvery cautious and calm and sober minded\nas we examine uh these these Concepts\nbecause\nwhen they are not when they're allowed\nto operate behind the scenes they can\nexert an enormous unconscious impact on\nthe things that we do don't do what we\nsay and don't say and who we allow\nourselves to be and who we choose to\nbecome\nso that's kind of what I have for you\ntoday RP Mentor Tokyo I hope that\nsuffices\num it's definitely more to talk about on\nthis subject and I hope we can do so in\nfuture episodes so thank you so for your\nsupport and if you're listening in you\nyourself we'd like to sponsor an episode\nthere is a link on how to do so in the\npinned comment below\nuh if you got this far you might as well\nlike this video And subscribe to this\nChannel and consider it sending this\nepisode to someone who you feel might\nbenefit from
