    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why\npeople don't like it when you're nice to\nthem\nchances are you have experienced this\nphenomenon yourself there's somebody\nthat you like there's somebody that you\nadmire you want to show your affection\nyou want to give them a token of your\nappreciation and it feels like you're\nrepaid only with contempt ingratitude\nand disinterest\nsome people will accept your gift in the\nspirit in which it is given but many\nwill not and this can be a puzzling\nphenomenon for folks that's where I come\nin I'm here to explain to you why it is\nthat people don't like you when you're\nnice to them\nthe key to this puzzle has to do with\nthe balance of Attraction now different\npeople have different preferences with\nrespect to the role they prefer to be in\nthat is some people prefer to be the\nadored and some rather most people\nprefer to be the Adora\nand they also have preferences with\nrespect to the size of the Gap they\nwould like to experience in their\nrelationships there are some people out\nthere who want that Gap to be as close\nto equal as possible these folks can get\nreally uncomfortable with even the idea\nof power imbalances which spoiler alert\nis actually one of the best ways to\nmaintain a power imbalance and they want\na perfect democracy between equal\npartners and there are some folks out\nthere who like that Gap to be fairly\nsizable while some toxic relationships\nhave large power imbalances not all\nrelationships with large power\nimbalances are toxic relationships some\npeople want to lead and some or rather\nmost people want to follow\nthink benevolent dictatorship\nin any case there those are the two ends\nof the spectrum with respect to the Gap\nin the balance of attraction\nit's also true that these are not static\npreferences that said the same person\nmight prefer to be the adorer relative\nto one person and the adored relative to\nanother some people always want to be\nthe adored some people always want to be\nthe adorer however most people want to\nbe adored by the people they want to be\nadored by and they want to adore the\npeople they want to adore make sense\nright and both positions and gaps can\nshift and change over time so these\nDynamics and preferences can really only\nbe understood in context all right so\nwhat does that have to do with anything\nwell when you demonstrate affection or\nappreciation when you give time energy\ngifts what you are functionally doing is\nplacing the other in the role of the\nadored in increasing the gap between the\ntwo of you this is especially true if\nthe time energy and gifts are not\nreciprocated which is the case that\nwe're discussing here if you're nice to\nsomebody and they don't like it we're\ntalking about a non-reciprocal situation\nthis increases the Gap in the balance of\nAttraction and that can make people\nuncomfortable for a number of reasons\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what I'm saying then please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message its\nWord of Mouth referrals like that that\nreally help to make the channel grow and\nif you're thinking about going to grad\nschool then please check out my top\nrated self-study GRE program at Stellar\ngre.com you can use the coupon code\npsych for 10 off all membership plans\nnow this increasing Gap in the balance\nof Attraction can make people\nuncomfortable because they don't prefer\nto be the adored or they don't want to\nbe the adored in relation to you or they\ndo want to be the adored in relation to\nyou but the Gap is becoming too large\nfor their tastes for whatever reason\nyour efforts are creating an awkward\ninterpersonal Dynamic and continuing to\nexpend effort will continue to make this\nDynamic more Awkward it's not going to\nwin you any favors\nnow when people are mean to you after\nyou show them respect and appreciation\nwhether they're conscious fit or not\nwhat they're functionally doing is\neither trying to punish or at least not\nreinforce the behavior that is\nincreasing the Gap in attraction and\nthey do this by being unlikable\nungrateful disrespectful ignoring\nminimizing and contemptuous their\nresponse is an attempt to communicate a\nmessage please like me less please the\nGap in our attraction is making me\nuncomfortable and I will help you like\nme less by behaving unlikably\ninterestingly if this attempt succeeds\nand you actually back off and don't\npursue and expend less effort the other\nperson might begin to respond positively\nto you why because the balance of\nAttraction has been recalibrated to\ntheir preferred gap size does that make\nsense\nnow sometimes I get pushback from people\non this idea they take offense and tell\nme oh so I just can't do nice things for\npeople I'm just supposed to be an\n all the time is that it I'm just\na nice person and I like to do nice\nthings for people is that so bad Orion\nand I would respond well yeah\nsometimes it is so bad\nmore is not always better in a\nrelationship remember it's the cat who\ndecides what milk is good the negative\nreaction of the person you are being\nnice to is their way of communicating\nthat that milk is not good for them\ninsisting that they should take your\naffection and appreciation and respond\nwith positive regard is selfish\nit's communicating my preference for The\nGap and the imbalance of Attraction\ntakes precedence over your preferences\nfor the same that's not nice people\nthat's selfish\ncomplaining that women are cruel or men\nare ungrateful is missing the point\nthose people are giving you constructive\nfeedback which if you can get your ego\nout of the way you could use to\nrecalibrate your behavior to potentially\nhave a more successful and satisfying\nrelationship with that person not always\nbut it's possible\nthe idea that you just want to be nice\nto somebody is kind of let's\nkeep it a buck and there's a very simple\nway to demonstrate this if you really\njust want the other person to smile or\nto have a nice day or to have an easier\nlife or whatever\nthen would you offer the same gifts and\nsupport anonymously\nthat's the real test would you be okay\nwith the other person not knowing the\ngood came from you or even thinking the\ngood things came from somebody else\nif you just want to make their lives\nbetter why would it matter\nbe real honest with yourself\nthe vast majority of people are seeking\nafter some form of positive regard and\nconsideration that comes as a result of\nbeing the acknowledged Giver of those\nresources and benefits and there's\nnothing necessarily wrong with that it\ndoesn't make you a bad person if you\nwant to be recognized for the good that\nyou do\nbut it does make you a little\nself-deceptive if you won't admit that\neven to yourself\non the other hand if you're all right\nwith giving without any expectation of\nappreciation or reward if you are not\nbothered when your good is repaid with\nbad then congratulations you might be a\nvirtuous person capable of love\nthat doesn't mean though that you're not\nseeking reward will be rewarded but hey\nvirtue is its own reward right\nso in short when people don't like it\nwhen you're nice to them it's their way\nof communicating like me less and if you\nget the message they might end up\nactually liking you more\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider becoming a channel
