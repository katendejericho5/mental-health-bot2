    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is women win\nthis dating game\napologies for the clickbaity title but\nhere you are so what game am I referring\nto in the title of this episode very\nsimply the dating game that women win is\nserial monogamy in fact they win in a\nbig way relative to men which is why I'm\nconsistently baffled when men choose to\nplay this game in the dating Market the\nreal kicker here has to do with this\nlittle visual aid which I'll come back\nto near the end of the episode\nthe reason why women win the game of\nSerial monogamy is that it is far easier\nfor the average woman to enter into a\nnew relationship at the end of an\nexisting one than it is for a man to do\nthe same\nthere are three main reasons why this is\nthe case first and foremost women\ninitiate\nbut far more breakups than men do\naccording to the research women initiate\nbetween 60 and 70 percent of all\nbreakups and divorces and because\nstatistics can be a little baffling this\nbasically means that women break up with\nmen twice as often as men break up with\nwomen that's a significant difference\ntwice as often\nand this is important because whereas\nsome guys might see the writing on the\nwall\nthe person doing the breaking up\nalways sees it coming\nthink about it in the context of work\nthe employer who is doing the firing\nalways knows exactly when it's going to\ngo down whereas the employee even if\nhe's on a performance Improvement plan\nmight not know exactly when the ax is\ngoing to drop and keep in mind that no\nmatter how frustrating or low performing\nthat employee is\nthat employer is unlikely to cut that\nemployee loose while he is still\nnecessary like in the middle of a\nproject\nwhose success would otherwise be\ncompromised so firing is always on the\nemployer's terms and it will occur when\nit is convenient for the employer doing\nthe firing not the employee being fired\ntherefore since women break up with men\nfar more often they have time to prepare\nagainst its coming this generally means\nthat they begin to get themselves ready\nfor re-entry into the sexual Marketplace\nbefore leaving their pre-existing\nrelationship this could mean going to\nthe gym to lose a few pounds\nthis could mean starting new activities\nwhich expose her to new social groups\nwith new potential mating opportunities\nshe might not be doing anything that\nconstitutes an overt betrayal however a\nwoman who has decided that a termination\nis impending will put herself in a\nposition to act on the preparations that\nshe has made against this happening\non the other hand the guy is often just\nleft there holding his dick\nthis is the first reason why women get\ninto a new relationship faster than men\ndo now before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing then please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message its\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to to grow the channel and\nalso if you're thinking about going to\ngrad school be sure to check out my top\nrated GRE self-study program at Stellar\ngre.com you can use the coupon code\npsych for 10 off all membership plans\nnow the second reason is that women\noften have potential mates on the\nperiphery of their lives these could be\nco-workers or yoga buddies or friends of\nfriends they are men in her Ambit where\nthere is some acknowledged attraction\nthat hasn't yet been acted upon it's\nactually fairly common for women to have\nplan B's if not plan C's D's E's F's and\nG's while she's still in her primary\nrelationship and women are generally\nallowed to do this socially because the\nstandards for infidelity really revolve\naround overt sexuality so as long as\nit's look but don't touch as long as she\nacknowledges that she's in a\nrelationship currently a woman can keep\noptions warm that can potentially be\nacted upon in the future\nthis allows her to strike up a new\nrelationship quickly as there are men\nwaiting in her proverbial Wings on the\nother hand most men do not enjoy\noptionality with women this means that\nthey often don't have a backup plan even\nif they wanted one that's the second\nreason and the third reason why it's\neasier for women to get into a new\nrelationship than it is for men is that\nmen's standards for entering into a\nrelationship are across the board\nsignificantly lower than women's\nstandards for the same most men I hate\nto say it but it's true most men will\nhave whoever will have them\nand if she's cute and willing to have\nsex with him and doesn't cause too many\nproblems men are generally willing to\nentertain the possibility of a\nrelationship on the other hand women\nhave and are encouraged to have much\nhigher standards for their potential\nmates and dates so even if a man wanted\nto get into a new relationship right\naway he would run up against the\nunforgiving gatekeeping of women's\nstandards so that's reason number three\nso women win the game of Serial monogamy\nwho cares why is this important\nwell that brings me to my\naforementioned visual aid which is\nreally the nail in the coffin\nthe 20s are a special time for both men\nand women well everyone is on his or her\nown path the average age at first\nmarriage in the U.S is 28 for women and\n30 for men\nso the decade of your 20s is your Prime\ndating period\nlet's say that it takes about six months\nto determine whether a relationship has\nlong-term potential in my opinion that's\nthe bare minimum amount of time\nnecessary to do some due diligence let's\nalso say that it takes a woman one month\nafter a relationship ends to get into a\nnew relationship whereas it takes a man\nsix months after a relationship ends to\nget into a new relationship\nhere's what that would look like over\nthe course of 10 years\nthe red lines being periods of time\nspent within a committed relationship\nas you can see there are far more red\nlines in the women's graph than in the\nmen's graph in fact the women have 17\nto the man's ten this means that given\nthe relative speed with which a woman\ncan enter into a new relationship women\nget 70 percent more chances of finding a\npartner for themselves across this\nparticularly sensitive period of their\nlives than men do\nlet's be honest there's a huge amount of\nluck in the dating game it's often a\nquestion of being in the right place at\nthe right time in some respects dating\nis like one of those claw games at an\narcade the more attempts you make the\nmore likely you'll eventually pull out a\nprize and if a woman gets 17 attempts\nfor every 10 that a man gets it's much\nmore likely that a woman is going to end\nup with a relationship over the course\nof a decade that serves her needs and\ninterests than a man is\ndo you understand\nthis is why men lose the game of Serial\nmonogamy it's not in their best\ninterests with respect to securing a\nlong-term relationship that actually\nmatches with their values goals and\ntheir purpose in life\nit's a long episode but an important\ntopic what do
