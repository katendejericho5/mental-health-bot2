    "transcript": "a lot of young guys get into weed\nbecause their lives aren't that great\nlet's be real it's actually very hard to\nbe a young man and our culture doesn't\nrecognize that whatsoever you're kind of\nuseless to other men because you have no\nskills or experience and women don't\nwant you because you're generally poor\nand irresponsible so a lot of young guys\nbecause they don't have a lot going on\nin their lives they kind of use weed to\nemotionally cope with their\ncircumstances and on some level this\nmakes sense if your circumstances aren't\nmiserable and you can do nothing about\nthem it makes sense to try to\naccommodate yourself to that reality\nemotionally however the real question is\nis it actually true that there's nothing\nyou can do to affect your shitty\nsituation for the vast majority of\npeople there are things that they can do\nto make their situation better they\nwon't necessarily move the needle right\naway but efforts accumulate and over\ntime you can really change your\nlifestyle and the appeal of getting high\nwill lessen"
