    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is weed is\nmore dangerous than you think\nso I've worked with a lot of guys who\nuse cannabis in some form or another and\nI also live in the San Francisco Bay\narea which is sort of like Ground Zero\nwith respect to recreational cannabis\nuse and I've noticed that there is a\ngeneral attitude that weed is a harmless\ndrug that requires deeper examination\nnow there are certainly some truth to\nthis for example folks can't overdose on\nmarijuana like they could on heroin or\nmeth so in this sense cannabis is not\ndangerous with respect to its toxicity\nprofile and it also generally doesn't\ngenerate much in the way of\nphysiological dependence physiological\ndependence is when your body adapts to\nexpect a certain amount of substance\nfrom your daily use for instance when\nfolks develop physiological dependence\nto alcohol which is a neurodepresent\ntheir sympathetic nervous system ramps\nup in expectation of the booze this is\nwhy if they don't drink heavy users can\nbreak out in sweats have terrible\nheadaches and suffer a host of other\nproblems in fact alcohol if you didn't\nknow is one of the few drugs the\nwithdrawal from which can actually prove\nfatal their sympathetic nervous system\ngoes nuts and they go into cardiac\narrest which is why heavy users might\nneed to detox under medical supervision\nyou don't see those kinds of things with\nweed\nwe might argue that it's psychologically\naddictive but it's not really\nphysiologically addictive like a lot of\nother drugs out there\nso these are kind of the arguments for\nwhy weed is harmless but I'm here to\nargue that it's this patina of\nharmlessness that makes weed a trojan\nhorse it looks harmless but it actually\ncarries within it a really dangerous\nliability and the main liability\nassociated with weed use is that weed\nmakes you think that you are using your\ntime well\nit's as simple as that\npeople are high they could watch paint\ndry and think it's fascinating when\npeople are high they think they are more\ncreative more intelligent and more\nproductive than they actually are if you\ndon't believe me try re-reading some of\nthe things that you wrote while you were\nhigh When You're Sober\nwhat might have made sense to you in\nthat state of consciousness doesn't\nquite make sense anymore\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing then please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message its\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help the channel to grow and if\nyou're thinking about going to grad\nschool then be sure to check out my top\nrated GRE self study program at Stellar\ngre.com you can use the coupon code\npsych for 10 off all membership plans\nnow why do so many young people use weed\nwell besides the opportunity for\nsocializing which is a huge draw for\nthat drug a lot of young guys get into\nweed because well\ntheir lives aren't that great\nlet's be real it's actually very very\nhard to be a young man and our culture\ndoesn't really recognize that whatsoever\nyou're kind of useless to other men\nbecause you have no skills or experience\nand women don't want you because you're\ngenerally poor and irresponsible the\nlifestyle of many young men sucks so a\nlot of young guys because they don't\nhave a lot going on in their lives they\nkind of use weed to emotionally cope\nwith their circumstances and on some\nlevel this makes sense like if your\ncircumstances are miserable and you can\ndo nothing about them it makes sense to\ntry to accommodate yourself to that\nreality emotionally I don't begrudge\nanyone that use of the drug however the\nreal question is\nis it actually true that there's nothing\nyou can do to affect your shitty\nsituation\nfor some people for a certain amount of\ntime it may be true that there's little\nto nothing they can do to make their\nsituation instrumentally better in the\nnear future\nhowever for the vast majority of people\nthat's [ __ ] there are things that\nthey can do to make their situation\nbetter\nthey won't necessarily move the needle\nright away but as a Young Man time\nis on your side yes it is\nJagger was not singing about the ladies\nin that song so efforts accumulate and\nover time you can really change your\nlifestyle so that you're not in such a\nshitty situation anymore and once you\nsucceed in doing that the appeal of\ngetting high will lessen this is because\nbeing high is generally a way of\naccommodating to the harsh and\nunpleasant aspects of reality however if\nyour situation is Pleasant meaningful\nrewarding and fulfilling\nyou actually won't want to avoid reality\nyou'll want to be present for your life\nas much as possible for as long as\npossible so it's actually possible to\nRaw Dog reality if you have a fairly\ndecent life and that's something that\nfolks can affect Maybe not immediately\nbut generally over time\nweed however saps people's motivation to\nmake that change the real danger with\nweed is not that it's acutely dangerous\nbut that it kind of makes the users\nshitty situation more tolerable\nwhich allows it to continue much longer\nThrough Time\nand in this way weed keeps folks gently\ntrapped\nfor years in circumstances that they\nmight long ago have been able to change\nnow when folks stop using and they come\ninto increased emotional contact with\nhow unpleasant their situation is things\nget harder things get worse however\nthat's actually kind of a good thing\nthat's because miserable situations are\nunsustainable\nweed makes a potentially miserable\nsituation tolerable which keeps users in\nthat situation longer\nif on the other hand you remove that\ntolerance and you feel the reality of\nyour situation you're not just gonna\nthrow your hands up in the air and say\nhelp I guess it's a lifetime of pain and\nmisery for me\nyou will do things to escape that pain I\nguarantee it even suicidally depressed\npeople run out of burning buildings\nyou may have previously been using weed\nto escape that pain\nbut if that root is now blocked by your\nwill you will find other ways to get out\nyou gotta trust yourself on that not\nhere to shame or blame anyone for using\njust offering my thoughts what do you\nthink does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this episode And\nsubscribe to the channel you may also\nconsider becoming a channel member with\nperks like priority review of comments\nor booking a paid consultation as always\nthanks for
