    "transcript": "the emotional gym is a metaphor that has\npersonally helped me enormously as I've\nattempted to cultivate virtues like\npatience forgiveness or kindness the\ncultivation of any virtue requires\nintentionality and effort you have to\nput in the Reps in order to strengthen\nthat attribute developing emotional\nvirtues is really not much different\nfrom developing physical strength if you\nwant to get physically stronger you have\nto identify certain behaviors that\nTarget specific muscle groups and you\nhave to put in the Reps to do this a lot\nof folks go to the gym and once they\nstart working out the sign that they're\nactually accomplishing their goal is\nsome degree of pain pain is a signal of\ngrowth if you're lifting weights without\never getting sore you're probably not\nbuilding any muscle the same premise\nholds true for developing emotional\nvirtue you have to put in the Reps and\nto some degree you have to be willing to\ntolerate the pain which is actually a\nsign of emotional growth"
