    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the\nemotional gym\nthe emotional gym is a metaphor that has\npersonally helped me enormously over the\npast 20 years as I've attempted to\ncultivate certain emotional virtues like\npatience forgiveness or kindness so if\nyou're on a similar trajectory yourself\nthen please keep listening\nthe cultivation of any virtue requires\nintentionality and effort you have to\nput in the Reps in order to strengthen\nthat attribute so in a way developing\nemotional virtues is really not much\ndifferent from developing physical\nstrength if you want to get physically\nstronger you have to identify certain\nbehaviors that Target specific muscle\ngroups and you have to put in the Reps\nto do this a lot of folks go to the gym\nthey put their workout clothes in a bag\nget in the car and drive to the gym they\nare aware that they are going to the gym\nand they are going to the gym with the\nexplicit intention of getting physically\nstronger and once they start working out\nthe sign that they're actually\naccomplishing that goal is some degree\nof pain\npain to some extent is a signal of\ngrowth if you're lifting weights without\never getting sore you're probably not\nbuilding any muscle if you're running on\na treadmill without ever feeling your\nlungs get burning hot you're probably\nnot developing your anaerobic cardio Etc\nobviously there's little point to\npushing ourselves to the point of injury\nhowever some measure of pain is\ntypically a good sign that we're\nactually doing something meaningful\nthe same premise holds true for\ndeveloping emotional virtues you have to\nput in the Reps and to some degree you\nhave to be willing to tolerate the pain\nwhich is actually a sign of emotional\ngrowth however the pain that we're\ntalking about here is a little different\nit could be a racing heart it could be a\nclenching in the stomach it could be a\nrising temper or it could be a flurry of\nincoherent thoughts\nthese are signs that you're working out\nemotionally\nand until you experience those signs\nthat you're working out emotionally\nyou're probably not yet building\nemotional strength\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing then please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like that that\nreally help to grow the channel and if\nyou're thinking about going to grad\nschool then you need to check out my top\nrated GRE self-study program at Stellar\ngre.com you can use the coupon code\npsych for 10 off all membership plans\nnow the main difference between the\nregular gym and the emotional gym is\nthat as I've said you consciously choose\nto go to the gym you decide when you\nwant to work out\non the other hand the emotional gym\ncomes to you\nyou do not get to decide when you're in\nthe emotional gym you only get to choose\nwhether you put in some reps while\nyou're there\nyou will understand that you're in the\nemotional gym because of the signals of\npain that you are now experiencing these\nhave come upon you whether you want them\nthere or not whether you have something\nbetter to do or not whether you believe\nyou've already put in enough practice or\nnot\nirrespective of your plans or intentions\nthe emotional gym has come to you\nso you might as well lift some weights\nwhile you're there\nthe idea here is to reframe whatever\nmoment you're passing through as an\nopportunity to develop a certain\nemotional virtue\nthis is what has helped me so much in my\nown self-development there's this old\njoke about a Catholic with a bad temper\nevery day he prayed to God to give him\npatience and every day he'd fly off his\nhandle and his wife and his co-workers\nat the people in the marketplace however\nhe remained undaunted and every day like\na good Catholic he got down on his knees\nand prayed once again for patience until\nas it happens one day the man died and\nhe was granted the right to ask God in\nheaven one question and his question was\nGod what was the story every day I\nprayed to you for patience and every day\nI lost it did you not hear my prayers\nand God replied my son every day I heard\nyour prayers and every day I sent you an\nopportunity to practice patience\nyour wife your co-workers the people in\nthe marketplace they were all put in\nyour life by me\nas the Fulfillment of your prayer the\nopportunity to grow that emotional\nvirtue\nfor without that practice how could the\nman possibly have gotten stronger that's\nkind of like just praying for muscles\nwithout lifting any weights that's not\nreally how God seems to operate he just\ndoesn't go around making people swole we\nhave to be active participants in our\nown salvation and the idea here is that\nall those things that tend to get under\nyour skin or cause you despair or\nexacerbate your worry all of those\nthings were put in your life as\nopportunities to practice their\ncomplementary virtues which in this case\nwould be patience or hope\nor courage\nand without those opportunities to\npractice you will not get stronger\nbecause it is literally not\npsychologically possible to get stronger\nwithout effortful repetition\nunderstanding this changed the way I\nperceived my entire life the physical\ngym exists only in a particular place\nhowever the emotional gym is coincident\nwith my entire life there is no part of\nmy life that is outside of the emotional\ngym the things I was struggling with the\nthings I was rubbing up against became\nthe weights that I was lifting in order\nto create emotional strength and over\ntime slowly and imperfectly I became\nmuch stronger as a result\nthe key is to recognize the signs that\nthe emotional gym has come to you and to\nsee that moment as an opportunity to put\nin some reps to build a particular\nemotional virtue do this consistently\nand how could you fail to become\nstronger\nwhat do you think is this fit with your\nown experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider becoming a channel member\nwith perks like
