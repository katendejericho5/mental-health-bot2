    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nimprove your motivation as a man\nsorry ladies but this episode is really\njust for the fellas but don't worry I'll\nget to you next time\nall right guys so there is actually a\nvery simple way to quickly and\nsignificantly improve your motivation\nregardless of your particular goal are\nyou ready here it is\nall you need to do is stop masturbating\nsimple but not necessarily easy so let's\ndive into this now why is this advice\nparticularly relevant for men and not\nfor women don't women masturbate well\nthey certainly do however the sexual\nimpulse is very different between men\nand women men have what I would call a\nsexual drive this is something that has\nbeen baked into us from millions of\nyears of evolution and this drive is\nmore or less consistently active at a\nhigh level except for the few minutes\nimmediately following orgasm\nafter a man ejaculates his system is\nflooded with prolactin which is directly\nassociated with reduced desire for sex\nimpotence and even infertility in fact\nmen with abnormally high levels of\nprolactin do not even produce sperm so\nwe see that this hormone is like a\ncircuit breaker for the sexual drive in\nmen and why men often feel the only\nrespite from sexual desire in their\nlives immediately after climax\nwomen are different for women the sexual\nimpulse is more like a mood when they're\nin the mood they want it when they're\nnot in the mood they don't want it but\nthey don't seem to have this constant\nunremitting desire for it like guys do\nalso when a woman orgasms her system is\nflooded with oxytocin and serotonin\nwhich are directly associated with\nfeelings of well-being and closeness on\nthe other hand men's oxytocin levels as\nwell as their dopamine levels decrease\nafter masturbation which is probably one\nof the reasons why men often feel so\nguilty and icky after masturbating if\ndopamine spikes are rewarding dopamine\ndrops or punishing whereas women tend to\nfeel relaxed and glow now before I go\nany further if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nvideo to someone who might benefit from\nits message its Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really helped to grow the\nchannel\nand if you're thinking about going to\ngrad school then you need to check out\nmy top-rated GRE self-study program at\nStellar gre.com you can use the coupon\ncode psych for 10 off all membership\nplans\nmy point here is that the sexual derive\nis really only present in men and as\nI've said this drive has emerged over\nthe course of millions of years of\nevolution on the other hand the rule of\nlaw and the repression of civilization\nis only a few thousand Euros old Max\nmen can no longer just take a woman if\nhe had the opportunity that behavior is\nshall we say frowned upon in the Modern\nAge however men's sexual drive\napparently hasn't gotten the memo\nthe upshot is that men have had to find\nways to channel their sexual energies to\nmore pro-social ends if a man does not\nsucceed in doing this he will become\nincreasingly frustrated or blocked and\nover time this will eventually lead to\neither some kind of self-defeating\nimplosion in which men sort of surrender\nto despair which we see in the Modern\nAge\nor some kind of anti-social\ntransgression\nwhich we also see in the Modern Age\nnot being able to successfully Channel\nor sublimate his sexual drive leads to\none or the other negative consequences\nin men\nthe compromise solution for millions of\nmen is to masturbate this reduces the\nfrustration making both the two negative\noutcomes I described less likely however\nin reducing the frustration masturbation\nalso makes sublimation unnecessary and\nMen kinda need the power of the\nsublimated libido to accomplish great\nthings\nlibido the sex drive is like a powerful\nMustang full of vigor and strength by\nitself this potency is useless even\ndestructive nothing can really be done\nwith a horse that's bucketing and\nrearing all the time\nmasturbation is kind of like spooking\nthe horse so that it will Tire itself\nout with running and therefore not cause\nyou any problems for a while\non the other hand sublimation is\ndiscipline and a harness\nsubmitting that Mustang to both and you\nnow have a terribly powerful engine on\nyour hands think about it libido is\nactually the life force\nsix since sex creates life that kind of\nmakes sense so if a man harnessed his\nlife force in the service of his ends\nwhat could he not accomplish look around\nyou the books on your shelf the\nskyscrapers in your city the athleticism\non your screen all of these are products\nof sublimation nothing great can be\naccomplished quickly\nthat is why nothing great can be\naccomplished without some constant\nunremitting Drive capable of breaking\nthrough resistance and rising to the\noccasion\nconstant unremitting Drive rising to the\noccasion now where might a man be able\nto find that in himself\nand how might that drive be squandered\nby his unwillingness to tolerate\nfrustration\nnow for some guys pornography and\nmasturbation is an addiction however for\nmost guys it's more like a vice or a bad\nhabit and quitting just requires some\neffort and intentionality and like\nstopping any other habit if you can go a\nfew months without indulging the new\nBehavior becomes significantly easier to\nmaintain\nand I'd argue that quitting masturbation\nis most important\nfor the guys who likely use it the most\nnamely single men\nwhy is that well if you are a single man\nyou don't really have a socially\nacceptable release for your sexual\nfrustration\nmasturbation will temporarily release\nyou from that tension however as I said\nearlier it also significantly reduces\nyour desire for sex so any motivation to\nactually go out and find a human sexual\npartner is significantly compromised\nfor straight men finding asexual partner\nis a risky Endeavor It generally\nrequires an expenditure of resources\ntime energy money as well as a certain\nwillingness to tolerate rejection and\ndisinterest\nin this way finding a sexual partner is\na little like hunting in traditional\nsocieties it's an uncertain and\nexpensive endeavor\nso why do it\nbecause you're hungry if people didn't\nget hungry no one would consider the\nrisk and expense of hunting to be\njustified to use a phrase the juice\nwouldn't be worth the squeeze\nhowever in my experience everyone\nbecomes a hunter if they get hungry\nenough and some men in our society could\nstand to get a little hungrier the fact\nof the matter is that you won't feel\nsexually frustrated if you sublimate\ncorrectly however you need to feel at\nleast somewhat sexually frustrated in\norder to sublimate and once you do that\nit's like you're powered by this\nminiature nuclear reactor it's a potent\nand amazing feeling and one that I hope\nall men can experience for themselves\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience please let me know\nin the comments below and if you've\ngotten this far you might as well like\nthis episode And subscribe to the\nchannel\nyou might also consider
