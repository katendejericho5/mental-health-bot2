    "video_title": "The ADORER versus the ADORED",
    "transcript": "it is not possible for two people to\nlike each other exactly the same amount\ntherefore in any relationship one person\nmust always like the other person more\nand the other person must like the other\nperson less the one who likes the other\nperson more is the adorer the one who\nlikes the person less is the adored the\ntwo roles are gender neutral both men\nand women can be adorers and both men\nand women can be the adore and both\nroles come with their pros and cons\nwhich means that it's not actually\nbetter to be the adored versus the\nadorer and vice versa however in my\nopinion it's generally better for women\nto be adorers"
