    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is it's\nbetter for women to be adorers so if you\nhaven't done so already I would highly\nencourage you to check out my series on\nthe balance of Attraction because some\nof this talk won't fully make sense to\nyou unless you have that additional\ncontext in brief it is not possible for\ntwo people to like each other exactly\nthe same amount therefore in any\nrelationship\none person must always like the other\nperson more and one person must always\nlike the other person less the person\nwho likes the other person more is the\nadorer and the person who likes the\nother less is the adored now these two\nroles are gender neutral both men and\nwomen can be adorers and both men and\nwomen can be the adored and both roles\ncome with their pros and cons it's not\nactually better to be the adored and\nvice versa\nuh\nhowever in my opinion it's generally\nbetter for women to be adorers and I'm\ngoing to back up that statement in this\nepisode now it may sound strange but\nmost people men and women most people\nactually want to be adorers\nmost people don't think they do but they\nactually do and this is because most\npeople are looking for that feeling they\nwant to find their person\nto feel excited about a relationship to\nbe in love to feel lucky to be there\nmost people want to feel these things in\na relationship but these emotions are\nnot shared in the same degree between\nthe two roles\nthese emotions are mostly felt by the\nadorer why because the adorer and only\nthe adorer gets to be with the one they\nlove the adored on the other hand gets\nto be loved by the one they're with it's\nnot nearly as emotionally compelling of\nan experience so if you want the\nemotional dimension of love in a\nrelationship you're really looking to be\nthe adorer now before I go any further\nif you're liking what you're hearing\nplease consider sending this video to\nsomeone who might benefit from its\nmessage it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike that that really help to grow this\nChannel and if you're thinking about\ngoing to grad school be sure to check\nout my top rated GRE self-study program\nat Stellar gre.com you can use the\ncoupon code psych for 10 off all\nmembership plans\ntrust me men want that emotional\nexperience almost as much as women do\nbut here's the thing in my experience\nit's more important for a woman to have\nan emotional experience in a\nrelationship than it is for a man\nthat's kind of like why the woman is\nthere perhaps you've heard it said that\nyou can make a woman feel anything\nexcept bored and there's some truth to\nthat statement a woman who hates you\nmight not leave but a woman who feels\nindifferently is probably looking for\nthe door\nso if it's more important for a woman to\nhave an emotional experience in a\nrelationship then it's probably better\nthat she be the adorer because if she's\nthe adored if she's up there on that\npedestal well that might feel good for a\nwhile but it will actually get boring\npretty quickly being on a pedestal ain't\nall it's cracked up to be and a bored\nwoman makes for an unsustainable\nrelationship\nmen this is what you have to understand\ntwo people in a relationship cannot\noccupy the same place and so when a man\ninsists on being the adorer he kind of\nrobs the woman of the opportunity of\nbeing the adorer which isn't really\ndoing any one of them any favors and\nthis is because you can't have two\nadorers and you can't have two adores\nbecause the balance of Attraction which\nmaintains that two people cannot like\neach other exactly the same amount\ninsisting on being the adorer forces the\nwoman to be the adored which robs her of\nthe Lion's Share of emotionality in the\nrelationship makes sense\nnow there's another important reason why\nit's better for women to be adorers and\nthis reason has to do with hypergamy\nwhich we have now talked about a few\ntimes on this channel hypergamy is the\ntendency of women to select up and\nacross which is why they tend to mate\nand date men who are older taller\nstronger wealthier and higher status for\ninstance\nthis means literally and figuratively a\nwoman wants to look up to her man\nif a man insists on being the adore then\nhe's looking up at her which means that\nshe is looking down at him and that is\ndefinitely not a sustainable\nrelationship men you don't allow a woman\nto look up to you you don't even give\nher the chance if you're looking up at\nher\nI can hear some wheels turning and some\nof my male audiences heads right about\nnow and that's good it's good that\nyou're thinking about this\nand this is what I'd like you to\nconsider gentlemen\nI get that you want to be the adorer\nshe's gorgeous and it feels amazing to\nbe with the woman you love I get it\nbut here's the thing if you insist on\nhaving that experience you are robbing\nher of the opportunity of having that\nexperience because you can't both be\nadorers my dude\nso what I'd like you to consider\nis making a voluntary sacrifice to be\nthe adored I know that sounds weird but\nit's a sacrifice to be the adored\nbecause almost everyone wants to be the\nadorer it's a sacrifice to be the adored\nto give the opportunity\nto give up the opportunity of being with\nthe one that you love\nand you're willing to do that to give\nthe woman that opportunity which is no\nsmall thing because you know how good it\ncan feel does that make sense\nwhat do you think do you think it's\nbetter for women to be adorers let me\nknow in the comments below and if you've\ngotten this far you might as well like\nthis
