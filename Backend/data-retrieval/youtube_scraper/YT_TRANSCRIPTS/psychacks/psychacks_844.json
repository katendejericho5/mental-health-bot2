    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycats\nbetter at Living Through psychology and\nthe topic of today's short talk is\ninequality is the basis of relationship\nnow this sounds somewhat\ncounter-intuitive but I hope to\ndemonstrate the truth of this statement\nin today's episode most people believe\nthat equality is the basis of\nrelationship and that can't be further\nfrom the truth but before I explain why\nthis is the case please remember to like\nthis episode And subscribe to this\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it's a great way\nto help spread this message so if you\nlike what you're hearing then please do\nthe thing and if you're thinking about\ngoing to grad school then you need to\ncheck out my GRE self-study program at\nStellar gre.com you can use the code\npsych for 10 off all membership plans\nhere's the thing people need things from\nother people and the medium through\nwhich value is transacted is a\nrelationship\nno relationship no transacted value and\nwhen the value of the proposed\ntransaction is equal\nno transaction occurs and therefore no\nrelationship is possible\nallow me to demonstrate this imagine I\nwere to come up to you and say hey I'll\ngive you this dollar bill\nfor that dollar bill\nwould you do it\nit's kind of a strange request right you\nmight respond are you asking me to break\nthat dollar into quarters so you could\ndo laundry or something as the same\nvalue in a different form might be more\nuseful under certain circumstances but\nif I responded no I just want that\nparticular dollar bill\nwhat would you think\nat this point you might start to wonder\nis there something special about my\ndollar bill like is it a misprint was it\nprinted in a valuable year or something\nor conversely you might suspect is there\nsomething wrong with his dollar bill is\nthis some kind of scam this doesn't make\nany sense the point is that you would\nbegin to suspect the existence of some\ndegree of inequality to make the bread\npose transaction explicable\nso would you do it well you might think\none dollar isn't that big of a risk so\nif I'm getting scammed I'm really not\nlosing much but if I were to repeat the\nsame experiment with higher valuations\nthis a hundred dollars for that a\nhundred dollars this one million dollars\nfor that one million dollars\nyou would become increasingly reticent\nthis is not just because the proposal is\nsuspicious if we assume that everything\nis legit and above board\nthe equal transaction is actually\na net loss to both parties\nwhy because nothing is gained for the\nexpenditure of time and effort to\nexecute the transaction which could have\nbeen more profitably spent in another\ntransaction\nboth parties spent resources time and\nenergy for No Gain that's a loss\nso equality is not the basis of a\ntransaction and no relationship is\npossible on these grounds\nthis suggests that inequality must be\nthe basis of transaction which is the\nactual fact a transaction only occurs\nwhen both parties believe that what they\nare receiving is of higher value than\nwhat they are giving up\nlet me illustrate this with a concrete\nexample\nwhen you go into a cafe and you hand\nover your three dollars for a cup of\ncoffee you are functionally saying that\nin that moment you esteem the value of\nthat cup of coffee more than those three\ndollars all of the things being equal\nyou would prefer to have the coffee than\nthe three dollars and by the same token\nthe coffee maker would prefer to have\nyour three dollars than 12 ounces of his\ncoffee\nthis is likely due to the fact that you\nhave more money than coffee and he has\nmore coffee than money so the differing\nmarginal utility of the money in the\ncoffee across the transaction creates\nthe differing subjective valuations of\nthe goods involved and what this means\nis that both people think they're\ngetting the better deal\nthey might say with their mouths that\nsounds like a fair trade however\ninternally each person is motivated to\nact because he feels that he would\nprofit from The Exchange\nand there is no profit in a strictly\nequal exchange indeed as we've seen\nthere's actually a loss in that\nsituation\nso inequality is the basis of\ntransactions and the transaction of\nvalue is the basis of a relationship\nwhere there is no value transacted there\nis no relationship however as soon as\nsome value is transacted voila you have\na relationship and this holds true for\nromantic relationships no less than it\ndoes for professional relationships\na fair and equal trade of perceived\nvalue is not the basis of a romantic\nrelationship\nit sounds strange but the economic\nprinciple Remains the Same a\nrelationship only occurs if both people\nthink they're getting the better deal\nand this is possible due to the\nsubjective perception of value\nand the principle of marginal utility\nthis latter most principle is something\nthat seems to trip up women especially\nsuccessful women in particular\nif I'm a rich and successful man\nthen the marginal utility of your\nsix-figure income is negligible to me\nthat is not nearly as valuable to me as\nit might be to a guy who is struggling\nfinancially who might not be who you\nreally want to get into a relationship\nwith\nbringing success and achievement to a\nman who already has those things is like\nbringing coffee to a cafe instead of\nmoney\nthey already have enough coffee they\ndon't want more coffee they want more\nmoney which is something that they have\nin scarcer quantities do you understand\nyour relationship Effectiveness will\nimprove exponentially if you understand\nthis concept which is basically an\neconomic principle economics isn't about\nmoney\nit's about how people make decisions and\nmany of those rules are just as baked\ninto human neurobiology as the rules of\nlogic\nyou work against them at your own risk\nwhat do you think have you seen this to\nbe true in your own experience let me\nknow in the comments below and thank you\nfor listening"
