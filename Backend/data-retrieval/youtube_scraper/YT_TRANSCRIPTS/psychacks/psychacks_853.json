    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nhave effortless relationships with women\npeople often say that relationships take\nwork so many will find this hard to\nbelieve but it is actually possible to\nhave an effortless relationship and let\nme tell you once you have one you will\nnever want to go back to the old model\nconsider that it takes no effort for\nwater to flow downhill\nseeking the lowest point is what water\ndoes naturally you can make water flow\nuphill but it will require continuous\nenergy and effort to do so and this is\nwhat happens when you try to have the\nrelationship you want with anyone this\nis tantamount to taking on a second\nunpaid job\non the other hand if you really\nunderstand yourself and if you know how\nto vet a woman appropriately then you\ncan have an effortless relationship in\nwhich love affection and sex flow as\nnaturally as water flows downhill\nthat said while selection is a big part\nof this outcome it's not the whole story\nfortunately assuming that selection\nisn't an issue there's really only one\nthing you need to understand to have an\neffortless relationship with a woman and\nthat's what I'm here to talk about today\nhowever before I reveal this\nunderstanding please remember to like\nthis episode And subscribe to this\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it's a way for you\nto help spread this message to more\npeople so if you like what you're\nhearing then please do the thing\nalso if you're thinking about going to\ngrad school then check out stellar\ngre.com and you can use the coupon code\npsych for 10 off all membership plans\nso what is it that you have to\nunderstand in order to enjoy an\neffortless relationship with a woman\nat this point it may be useful if you\nhaven't done so already to check out my\nepisode women treat men the way men\ntreat jobs because it's within this\nframework that I will be discussing this\nunderstanding\nas I said there's only one thing you\nneed to understand to have an effortless\nrelationship with a woman and here it is\nall you need to do is to be her\nperceived best option\nthat's it\nif it sounds simple\nit's because it is however that doesn't\nnecessarily mean that it's easy since as\nwe've previously discussed on this\nchannel women want it all now why does\nthis work okay\nwomen treat men the way men treat jobs\nright so men think about all the\nprofessional experiences that you've had\nin your life you've probably had several\ndifferent jobs which is generally enough\nexperience to know that it's hard to get\na good job if you've worked for several\nyears you've probably encountered\ninsufferable bosses incompetent\ncolleagues demanding work schedules\nuseless obligations frustrating\nbureaucracy low compensation feeling\nunappreciated feeling disrespected\nfeeling burnt out feeling like you're\ngiving more than you're getting\nthese are all fairly common experiences\nas you make your way through the\nprofessional Arena especially at the\nbeginning because you tend to have the\nworst jobs when you're first starting\nout\nso let's say that you've had these kinds\nof experiences over the past five or ten\nyears and that you may even have begun\nto despair of the possibility of ever\nfinding a job that you don't hate let\nalone a job that you love\nand you finally land this fantastic job\nit pays three times as much as you've\never been paid before it gives you a\nflexible schedule with unlimited paid\ntime off it allows you freedom and\ncontrol over your various projects and\nresponsibilities it provides excellent\nbenefits and you feel appreciated and\nrespected by your colleagues and\nsupervisors\nnow if you land this job\nare you going to do anything whatsoever\nto jeopardize this position\nabsolutely not you are going to be on\nyour very best behavior and why are you\ngoing to be on your very best behavior\nbecause you know what else is out there\nyou understand that all other things\nbeing equal If this job doesn't work out\nit's going to be a step down for you it\nwon't be as good as you've got them\nyou'll be paid less for more work you\nmight have to relocate and at the very\nleast you'll have to go through the\nwhole interview process again which is a\nreal pain in the ass I've never met\nanyone\nwho says he likes interviewing for jobs\nand that's kind of what dating feels\nlike to women in many respects\nso if you've previously had challenging\nor unfulfilling experiences in the\nprofessional Arena\nonce you find an interesting meaningful\nhigh-paying job with great benefits you\nare going to be Employee of the Month\nthe same is true in relationships even a\nwoman with limited dating experience has\na pretty decent idea of what is out\nthere\ndating a narcissist or a stoner with no\nambition or an angry controlling guy is\nkind of like working one of those [ __ ]\njobs in your past\nand if she's lucky enough to land a\nrelationship with you if you have an\nemotionally compelling lifestyle if you\nknow how to maintain high levels of\nAttraction if you're interesting and fun\nand fit and can provide her with high\nvalue experiences that she may not be\nable to find anywhere else\ntrust me she is not going to do anything\nto rock the boat and why is that because\nshe knows what else is out there man she\nunderstands that all other things being\nequal If this relationship doesn't work\nout it's gonna be a step down for her\none of the things that I tell my clients\nis that other guys make me look good\nI have nothing to fear from other guys\nbecause I've seen the competition and if\nyou can't yet authentically endorse that\nbelief yourself\nthen you've got some work to do\nyour work is to level up your life by\ninvesting in yourself to the point that\nyou can legitimately be perceived as the\nbest option by the caliber of women to\nwhom you are attracted\nand this really shouldn't be that tough\nof a cell as most of this work directly\nbenefits you anyway\nand once you succeed in doing so you'll\nhave other work to do because the work\nnever stops however let's just take this\none step at a time\nalso if you're a woman's perceived best\noption then most of the tricks of\ncontrol and manipulation that guys are\nsubject to using to secure love\naffection and sex become increasingly\nirrelevant\nyou don't need them you don't need to\ntry to control your partner or convince\nher that she should be there or mess\nwith her emotions you can be like an\nemployer at a fantastic company that's\nin high demand we'd love to have you but\nwe're not going to force you to stay and\nyou're free to leave at any time there's\nthe door\nif you are a woman's best option she is\ngoing to be sweet as pie she is going to\nbe putting an effort she is going to be\nsexually available she's going to be\ngentle and patient and easy going\nthis is the type of relationship that a\nlot of guys are looking for and it does\nnot require work\non the other hand if she is difficult or\ndistant or inconsistent or impatient or\ndemanding or whatever\nit's almost always because she believes\nthat she could do better\nmaybe she had a better option in the\npast who may not have wanted the kind of\nrelationship that she did maybe she is\ncomparing herself to her friends or\nsocial media or maybe she's just\ndelusional about her value and\nexpectations the reason doesn't really\nmatter the upshot is that you're not\ngoing to have a good time and you'll be\nputting in more and more effort for\nsmaller and smaller returns\nthe smart move is to select women who\nunderstand that they're lucky to be\nthere anything less is a job\nwhat do you think have you experienced\nthis yourself let me know in the\ncomments below thank you for listening"
