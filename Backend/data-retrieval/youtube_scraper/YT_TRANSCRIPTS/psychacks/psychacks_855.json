    "transcript": "have you ever seen tomorrow because I\nhaven't\ntomorrow my friends doesn't really exist\nthe tenses the future and the past\nare psychological artifacts created as a\nresult of your subjectivity they don't\nactually exist in objective reality\nin objective reality there is only the\nundifferentiated now the present moment\nit is the present moment only in which\naction occurs and that's all we can ever\npossibly observe is that which occurs\nwhich means that it can only exist\nwithin the present moment\nso with this high level understanding\nyou can dismantle the tendency to\nprocrastinate\nby understanding that there is no crash\nthere is no tomorrow on which to hang\nyour hopes\nyou can't sweep things under the rug if\nthe rug exists only in your mind"
