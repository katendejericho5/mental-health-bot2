    "transcript": "the way that relationships work is\npeople constantly have new needs and\nwants and they're constantly expecting\ntheir Partners to fulfill them and if\nthey don't for too long then the\nrelationship becomes inappropriately\nexpensive especially relative to other\npotential optionality that person has so\nthen it sounds like the solution to have\na successful marriage might be to\nnegotiate this stuff upfront and be very\nclear about what your wants and no\nunfortunately not because a lot of the\nthings that are transacted in an\nintimate relationship don't lend\nthemselves well to that kind of explicit\nnegotiation like you can't negotiate\ndesire I know some guys who when they\nhear about how many sexless marriages\nthere are out there they get really\nafraid and they try to actually create\nlike a legal document where it's like we\nI'm entitled to two sexual intercourses\na week and three every fortnite and it's\nlike it doesn't work that way men don't\nactually want just a woman to have sex\nwith him they want a woman to\nenthusiastically want to have sex with\nhim right and you can't negotiate\nenthusiasm right"
