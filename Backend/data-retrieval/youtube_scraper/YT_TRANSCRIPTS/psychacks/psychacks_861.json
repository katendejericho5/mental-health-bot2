    "transcript": "it is not easy to make friends as an\nadult but it is possible the easiest way\nto do this is to enroll yourself in some\nkind of certification program could be a\n100 hour yoga teacher training course or\nsome sort of leadership development\nprogram it doesn't really matter you\nshould pick something that you're at\nleast somewhat interested in though\nbecause you will have to spend some time\nwithin that milieu now this is important\nfor a couple of reasons one is the fact\nthat there's some sort of certification\nat the end of the process will\nincentivize people to make a consistent\npresence in this context and you need to\nsee people repeatedly in order to have\nand develop relationships with them\nsecondly the fastest way to accelerate\nintimacy is to undergo shared difficulty\nand that's precisely what you'll be\ndoing when you're undergoing a course of\nstudy under an abbreviated duration of\ntime it will be stressful you'll be\ncompleting assigns together and that\ntends to bring folks together"
