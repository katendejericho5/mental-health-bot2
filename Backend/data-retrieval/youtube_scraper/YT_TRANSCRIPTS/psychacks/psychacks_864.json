    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is loyalty\nmeans different things to men and women\nin case you're new to the channel I've\nalready tackled the concept of respect\nin this vein so please do check out that\nepisode if you haven't done so already\ntoday I'll be putting the concept of\nloyalty through the same treatment turns\nout that men and women can both be very\nloyal though in very very different ways\nbut before I get into it please remember\nto like this episode And subscribe to\nthis channel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it's a great way\nto help spread this message so if you\nlike what you're hearing then please do\nthe thing also if you're thinking about\ngoing to grad school then check out\nStellar gre.com you can use the coupon\ncode psych to get 10 off all membership\nplans all right so how is loyalty\ndifferent between men and women well one\nis about as loyal as another though to\ndifferent things\nthe thing to understand about woman's\nloyalty that men often fail to\nappreciate is that women are loyal to\ntheir feelings\nfor instance if a woman is completely in\nlove with a guy if she is 11 out of 10\nattracted to him then her loyalty is\nimpressive indeed and she will remain\nloyal as long as those feelings remain\nin her heart\na woman who is extremely attracted to a\nman will move across the world for him\nwe'll change her religion for him we'll\nbreak with her family for him will I\ncheat and steal for him and will help\nbury the body with him if necessary\na woman at that level of attraction is\nride or die and she will do absolutely\ncrazy irrational and life-altering\nthings for a man to keep him in her life\nit's both impressive and terrifying how\nloyal a woman can be under the right\nconditions\nof course the caveat is that when that\nfeeling shifts when the attraction dips\nwhen the love disappears then so does\nthe Loyalty so if you're in a\nrelationship with a woman\nand you want to enjoy her continued\nloyalty you have to approach her\ndifferently than you would another man\nthat is well the best way to secure\nloyalty from a man is through a solemn\nand honorable agreement or understanding\nthe best way to secure loyalty from a\nwoman is to continually do the things\nthat encourage her desire and attraction\nto remain at a very high level\nyou get loyalty from women indirectly\nthrough attraction\nbut if you succeed in doing so the\nresults are significant and reliable so\nwhat about men\nthe thing to understand about men's\nloyalty that women often fail to\nappreciate is that men are loyal to\ntheir duties\nthat is men understand that loyalty is\nThe Honorable fulfillment of a solemn\noath\nthese Concepts Duty oath honor are not\nfeminine Concepts I've personally never\nheard a woman talk about her Duty ever\nI'm sure that such women exist somewhere\nbut my hunch is that where they do\nthey're probably in very masculinized\nenvironments like the military\nDuty Oaths honor these are masculine\nConcepts they don't really exist in the\nfeminine world\nand within the construct of Duty and\nhonor feelings are absolutely irrelevant\nyou do your duty regardless of how you\nfeel if you took an oath to hold the\nline you are not allowed to run away\njust because you now feel afraid such a\nman would be branded a traitor and a\ncoward and would be dealt with very\nharshly in masculinized environments and\nthe thing about Oaths is that you only\nhave to take an oath once\nit's like a contract it's signed once\nand then remains in force indefinitely\nuntil such day that the contract is\namended through mutual consent of both\nparties\nas a result of the oath men reasonably\nassume that no further action is\nrequired in order to expect the faithful\nexecution of Duty and this is how men\ntend to approach their relationship\ncommitments with women it's like\nI said I do at the altar what more do\nyou want or what do you mean you can't\nbreak out of our oath just because your\nfeelings have changed and the liability\nwith this approach for men is that they\ncan often end up in relationships where\nreally all they have left is their Duty\nand they spend the remainder of their\nlives with someone they don't love or\nwith someone who stopped loving them\nlong ago in those situations it's like\nthe only thing these men have left is\nthe fact that they never broke their\ncommitment which is a pretty dry and\nempty Victory kind of like fighting for\na country that no longer exists this is\ncertainly not what we should be striving\nfor in our personal relationships so\nwhat's the upshot well we should now be\nable to appreciate that folks get into\ntrouble when they unreasonably believe\nthat the other sex should adopt their\nown Sexes conceptualization of loyalty\nthis is tantamount to thinking that\nwomen should be men and men should be\nwomen\nthey aren't and I see no good evidence\nto justify the belief that they should\nbe\nmen and women are different and Viva la\ndeferrals\non the other hand appreciating those\ndifferences should allow both men and\nwomen to have more harmonious and\nsatisfying relationships with one\nanother\nfinally we can see that women have an\nopportunity to learn from men and men\nhave an opportunity to learn from women\nso what can women learn from men well\nwomen can learn to honor their\ncommitments irrespective of their\nemotions that's important\nand what can men learn from women well\nmen can learn to find more joy and\npleasure in discharging their\ncommitments which is also important the\nunion of those two things the joyful\nexecution of our duty is actually the\nideal situation\nand I contend that that is what we\nshould all be striving toward\nwhat do you think what does loyalty mean\nto you let me know in the comments below\nand thank you for listening"
