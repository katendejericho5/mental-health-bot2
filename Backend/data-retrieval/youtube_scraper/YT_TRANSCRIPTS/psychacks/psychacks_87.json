    "transcript": "some women are construction workers and\nwhich women are we talking about here\nthe women who don't really have anything\nelse going on in their lives let me\nexplain this type of woman might have a\nvery low-paying job or she might have no\njob whatsoever she is generally not an\nactive participant in a personally\nrelevant community and she typically\ndoes not have a network of friends or\nfamily to support her she may not even\nhave any real Hobbies or interests and\nfinds it difficult to fill her time with\nconstructive or meaningful action this\nall typically means that she's fairly\nyoung as it's hard to persist in that\nstate indefinitely now this type of\nwoman is actually very attractive to a\nlot of men because men look at her and\nthink wow this is great she's not tied\nup in her career because she doesn't\nhave one she's not going to prioritize\nher friends over me because she doesn't\nhave any and she's not going to\ncomplicate our arrangement with a lot of\npre-existing commitments because she\nain't got none fantastic"
