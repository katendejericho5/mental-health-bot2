    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nshine brighter if you're curious about\nthe title of this episode it's actually\nthe slogan of one of my side hustles and\ntoday I'd like to talk to you about what\nthat is and how it came into being\nmany years ago I was a professional\ntheater actor living in New York City\nacting was fun but being an actor was\nhard it's a tough way to make a living\nso I decided to support my artistic\npretensions by becoming a private tutor\nI started by putting up flyers in coffee\nshops around Brooklyn my first statement\nwas a middle-aged Russian immigrant from\nCanarsie who wanted to better appreciate\nShakespearean literature\nover the next couple years I steadily\nbuilt up my client base and founded my\nown high price Tutoring company catering\nto the children of Manhattan's Elite it\nwas a decent life a good enough life but\nthere was something about it that I\ndidn't find entirely fulfilling\nafter a lot of deliberation I decided to\nbecome a psychologist\nto become a psychologist I needed a\ndoctorate in Psychology and to do that I\nneeded to be accepted into a graduate\npsychology program\nand for that to happen I needed to apply\nto a graduate psychology program and to\ndo that I needed to take the GRE which\nin America is the test to get into most\ngraduate schools\nthe whole idea seemed Preposterous as\nthe only background I had in Psychology\nwas an intro to psych class I took in\ncollege in which I earned a B minus I\nhad absolutely no experience in the\nfield that said I knew I could do it the\nhard part was convincing other people\nthat I could do it\nfortunately at that point I had helped\nhundreds of students prepare for the GRE\ndespite never having taken it myself\nwhen I did sit for the test I got a\nperfect score on my first attempt and I\nthink that was a big part of why I was\nadmitted into a Top Choice program for\nme a professional School of Psychology\nin San Francisco\nat the time I was living in public\nhousing in Crown Heights in a couple\nthousand dollars to my name\nwhen I moved out to San Francisco I\nrented a furnished room in a spinster's\nhouse and got busy I only had enough\ncash to last a couple of months so I\nknew I needed to make something happen I\ndecided to keep tutoring this time\nfocusing exclusively on the GRE and\nbegan cold calling established tutors in\nthe area and inviting them out for\ncoffee many of them graciously agreed to\nmeet with me and some of their advice\nwas invaluable to getting myself\nestablished in a new town\nin the beginning I was living month to\nmonth but in a year I was earning enough\nnot only to support myself but to pay my\nway through grad school\nthis was of course exhausting I was a\nfull-time student a part-time unpaid\nintern a small business owner and a\nresearcher writing my dissertation I\nworked 100 hour weeks at least for years\nit was hard\nbut the alternative failure was even\nharder\nnow I'm a licensed psychologist with a\nthriving Private Practice I'm living the\nlife that I envisioned for myself in my\nlate 20s and that seemed impossibly\ndistant at the time and it all began\nwith taking the GRE\nthe side hustle that I've been\ndescribing is called Stellar GRE over\nthe past 20 years I have worked with\nthousands and thousands of students to\nprepare for the GRE and secure admission\ninto top-ranked programs around the\nworld\nthe system I teach is a complete\nre-envisioning of test prep all the way\ndown to First principles it's the same\nsystem I use to get my own perfect score\non the test and countless students have\nused it to achieve top percentile scores\nthemselves I have hundreds of five star\nreviews on Yelp and Google\nthe real special thing about Stellar GRE\nis that to my knowledge it's the only\nempirically validated test prep system\nin the world\nusing my background and statistical\nmethods I collected data from hundreds\nof students over the years to determine\nthe degree to which they improved over\ntwo months of working with me\nit turns out that Stellar's average\nscore improvements are greater than my\ncorporate competitors score guarantees\nthis means that the system works just\nhow well does it work\nstudents improved an average of 26\npercentile points on each of the three\nsections of the test in just eight weeks\nthis is an extraordinary response for\nsuch a short amount of time\ntest prep is a means to an end and that\nend is to create a better life for\nyourself and the society in which we\nlive\nStellar GRE is here to help you with\nthat first step\nunfortunately until recently my services\nwere limited to folks who live in the\nBay Area\nhowever I'm very happy to report that\nthis is no longer the case my entire\nsystem is now available to interested\nstudents all over the world as an online\nself-study program\nin this program you'll have access to my\ncomplete prep manual which breaks down\nthe counter-intuitive strategies used to\ndismantle every type of question on all\nthree sections of the test\nfive full-length adaptive mock tests\nthat mimic the actual feel of the exam\nand much more\nit's based on the Sea-Doo teach model\nused to train medical doctors and it's\ndesigned to raise your scores as much as\npossible as quickly as possible\nwhat's more membership starts at less\nthan half the cost of my corporate\ncompetitors\nit's really a fantastic product I'm very\nproud of it and I think it's going to\nhelp a lot of people\nif you'd like to learn more check out\nstellar gre.com\nand if you use the code psych that's\npsych you'll get an additional 10 off\nour already low prices\nso if you're interested in going to grad\nschool or if you know someone who is\nplease consider looking into Stellar GRE\nyou'll be glad that you did\nthanks for listening to a bit of my\nstory do you have one of your own let me\nknow in the comments below and thank you\nfor listening"
