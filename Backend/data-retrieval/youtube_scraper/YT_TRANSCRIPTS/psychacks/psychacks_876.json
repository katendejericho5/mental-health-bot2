    "transcript": "this is a great lesson from the World\nCup\nalways factor in penalty time what does\nthat mean that means that things never\nend when you think they're going to end\nyou think that game is only 90 minutes\nlong you're wrong there's extra time on\nthe clock and you don't even know\nexactly how much extra time is on the\nclock only the ref who's keeping the\ntime knows the answer to that question\nso if you pace yourself if your focused\njust on getting to the 90 minute Mark\njust to get to where you think the\nFinish Line might be you might be in for\na rude awakening when you see that the\ngame is still afoot everything takes\nlonger than you think it's going to and\nplanning for that in your process helps\nto prevent burnout and manages emotional\nexpectations"
