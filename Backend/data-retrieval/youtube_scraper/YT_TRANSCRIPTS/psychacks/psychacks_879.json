    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is cancer\ncures neurosis\nto something of a provocative title but\nthese actually aren't my words this is a\nquote from the great psychotherapist\nIrvin yalam who like myself actually got\nstarted as a health psychologist working\nwith folks diagnosed with cancer\nso let's unpack this quote a bit because\nI do think there is some truth to it but\nbefore I do please remember to like this\nepisode And subscribe to this channel it\ntakes less than a second costs you\nnothing and it's a good way to cure what\nails you so do the same\nmy own personal definition of neurosis\nis that Neurosis is confusing a fake\nproblem\nwith a real problem\nand just to be clear confusing a fake\nproblem with a real problem is a real\nproblem it creates a lot of suffering\nfor a lot of folks so I'm not trying to\nminimize the suffering of neurotic\nillness however what I am saying is that\nthere is a fake problem at the heart of\nneurosis that is confused for a real\nproblem\nnot touching your doorknob three times\nbefore you leave the house is a fake\nproblem\nthe social disapproval of others is a\nfake problem\nabstaining from pornography is a fake\nproblem\nnow again all these fake problems and\nmore can cause real suffering but let's\nbe honest they are not real problems a\nreal problem is something like penury\nWar sickness and death\nthese are real problems\nand what y'all have noticed is that when\nfolks were confronted with a real\nproblem\nmany of their fake problems tended to\ndisappear\nit's almost like folks need a real\nproblem in their lives to put their fake\nproblems in perspective hence cancer\ncures neurosis\nI saw this many many times when I was\nworking with cancer patients as a health\npsychologist\nwhen folks are first given a diagnosis\nof stage four disease especially if they\nhad presumed that they had that they\nwere otherwise healthy there was a kind\nof predictable sequence of emotions that\nthey passed through from shock and\nTerror to rage and hopelessness it's a\nreal emotional roller coaster for at\nleast several weeks\nbut what tended to happen after that was\namazing\nin the majority of cases when folks\neventually arrived at an acceptance of\nthe possibility that they may actually\nhave only six months left to live\nalmost all of them decided that they did\nnot want to spend those six months\nafraid despondent\nand Furious\nand so I often bore witness to a radical\ntransformation in the personalities of\nfolks as they approach the ends of their\nlives\nin fact I heard from many folks in this\nsituation that it wasn't until they\nstarted to die that they began to really\nlive\nI want you to sit with that for a moment\nthis is not a hypothetical comment I\nheard this many times from actual\npeople's mouths\nthat it wasn't until they started to die\nthat they actually started to really\nlive\nand what they meant in part is that\nthere is a sort of freedom and\nfearlessness that comes with the\nacceptance of one's mortality and once\nfolks arrive at that point they live\nlife Full Throttle trying to squeeze\nevery moment out of the time they have\nleft\nand that doesn't mean that they're just\nlike manically happy there was also\nprofound sadness and real forgiveness\nand genuine courage\nit's so impressive to see people truly\nliving\nand it's such a shame that they didn't\nstart to live that way earlier\nand I think that's true for all of us I\nthink we all tend to believe that we\nhave more time than we might\nand so put off that living for another\nday\nbut I think that if we attempted to live\nas if we had cancer that is with the\nacceptance that our days are numbered\nthen maybe we might\nafter accommodate to that terrifying\nhelpless infuriating reality\nand eventually move through the rest of\nour days with real courage honesty and\nconviction\nin that way though it's strange to say\nthe cancer experience has been a gift to\nmany people\nobviously I don't wish cancer on anybody\nI would not like to go through the\nexperience myself but I think it's also\nimportant to understand that it's really\nhow you use what happens to you in your\nlife that matters not what does or does\nnot happen to you\nthat's the really important thing how to\nuse what happens to you and it turns out\nthat even something like dying\ncan be used to bring you closer\nto life\nsomething to keep in mind\nwhat do you think\nhave you moved towards authenticity in\nyour own life if so how'd you do it let\nme know in the comments below thank you\nfor listening"
