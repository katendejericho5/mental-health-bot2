    "transcript": "the value of a partner changes over time\nas our goals evolve and it all the value\nof a partner also changes as a function\nof them giving us what what we want this\nis a really difficult reality\nemotionally for people to deal with but\nthink about it like this when is a\nplumber more valuable to you before he\nfixes your sink or after he fixes your\nsink yeah before no one continues to pay\nthe plumber after he fixes the sink like\nyou'll pay him once for the job but then\nit's like you don't want him to stick\naround you're not going to keep paying\nhim and on some level he became less\nvaluable to you because he did what you\nwanted that's really tough to deeply\nemotionally appreciate that it's the\nnatural tendency for people to Value\nthose less as a consequence of\ndischarging our expectations and desires\ninteresting and that's of course what we\nwant in a relationship we want someone\nto give us what we want but then once we\nhave it we want them less"
