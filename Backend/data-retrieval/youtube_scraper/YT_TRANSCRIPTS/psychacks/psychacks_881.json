    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is what\nwomen don't understand about chivalry\nin the dating Market there are still\nwomen in today's day and age who\napparently lament the decline of\nchivalry and when I encounter this I'm\nalways a little perplexed like I can\nunderstand why women might miss some of\nthe benefits and social niceties they\nused to enjoy under chivalry having the\ndoor held open for them say or having\neverything paid for them old school\ngentlemanly stuff that has all that\ndisappeared from today's culture I can\nunderstand why women might miss those\nthings\nthey're nice but there's a real problem\nwith lamenting The Disappearance of\nchivalry that speaks to something women\ndon't quite understand about the\ninstitution\nand before I explain what that is please\nbe sure to like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\nhow you can demonstrate some old school\nmanners so do the thing\nnow what are women missing\nwomen don't seem to appreciate that\nchivalry is a culture of manners\nthat provided for women in large part\nbecause women had nothing of Their Own\nand it was the fact that women had\nnothing of Their Own\nthat provided the rationale\nfor chivalric provision\nlike in my examples from before men\nopening doors for women was only a\nmeaningful gesture because doors were\nclosed to women both figuratively and\nliterally men paying for everything was\nexpected because women literally didn't\nhave money of Their Own\nthe Dark Side of chivalry is that it\nmore or less requires that women be\nrestricted and impoverished otherwise\nit's completely ridiculous\nas I've mentioned in previous episodes\nromantic love is based on the chivalric\ncode of knights who lived in the 11th\nand 12th centuries in southern France\nand what you have to understand is that\nromance was a kind of an excuse to have\nan adventure both for the man and for\nthe woman the man got to put on his\nShining Armor and go questing in the\nname of his lady fair and the woman got\nto have in an emotional affair with a\ndashing daring hero I say emotional\naffair because typically the object of\nthe chivalric knights affection was\nactually married to another man check\nout my episode on the truth about\nromance on obtainability for more on\nthat topic\nlife was pretty boring in the 12th\ncenturies and romance helped to spice\nthings up a bit\nhowever a kind of necessary component of\nthe heroism that permeates the Romantic\nlifestyle\nis the inability of anyone but the hero\nto accomplish the task\nand this means that the other players\nmust either pretend to be or actually be\nincompetent or insufficient in order for\nthe hero to do his thing\nto rescue the Damsel in Distress\nthe damsel must first be locked away\nthat's what creates the necessity of\nchivalric action the unfreedom of women\nif the Damsel in question held the key\nto her cage the whole time Not only\nwould the whole chivalric effort be a\nfarce but it would almost be\npsychotically manipulative to boot\nin short what women don't understand\nabout chivalry is that chivalry only\nmakes sense in the context of women's\nGeneral impoverishment restriction and\nincompetence\nas these things provide the necessary\nrationale for men's provision Liberation\nand heroism\nand as much as I love heroism I think\nit's generally better for everyone that\nwomen not be impoverished restricted or\nincompetent\nthis is why I'm befuddled when I hear\nwomen say that they miss chivalry what I\nhear is that these women miss the days\nwhen women couldn't do anything for\nthemselves\nas it was not being able to do anything\nfor themselves that created the\nmeaningful rationale for men's chivalric\naction\nwomen's restriction is the necessary\nprecondition of the romantic adventure\nfor men\nwomen's Liberation destroys the same\nprecondition you can have one or the\nother but you can't have both\nsomething to keep in mind\nwhat do you think do you have any\nexamples from your own life about this\nthat you'd like to share please let me\nknow in the comments below and thank you\nfor listening"
