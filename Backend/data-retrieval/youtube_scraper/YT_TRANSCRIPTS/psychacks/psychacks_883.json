    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic today short talk is three\ntips for dealing with Envy\nEnvy is a very corrosive emotion and if\nleft unchecked can devour people's minds\nif not their very Souls this is\nexacerbated by the fact that Envy tends\nto be invisible folks might willingly\nadmit to being angry or sad or afraid\nbut few people will admit to feeling\nenvious and this invisibility makes it\ndifficult to manage that said I have\nthree tips to deal with this negative\nemotion and I'd like to discuss them\nwith you today but before I do please\nremember to like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it\nhelps to defeat the haters so do the\nthing\nto begin with I'll offer a definition of\nenvy so that we're all on the same page\nEnvy is actually a fairly complex\nemotion it needs a number of things in\norder to exist here's my definition\nEnvy requires a perceived deficit with\nrespect to a personally relevant good\nrelative to a perceived equal that's\ncomplex so I'll say it again Envy is a\nperceived deficit with respect to a\npersonally relevant good\nrelative to a perceived equal so there's\na lot of things that need to happen in\norder for Envy to occur and this is good\nbecause if we can dismantle any one of\nthose things then Envy sort of falls\napart it needs all three components in\norder to exist\nthe first useful Avenue of attack is to\ndismantle the relative to a perceived\nequal part\nno two blades of grass are the exact\nshade of green\nso we need to be careful about our\nassumptions of similarity is it true\nthat whoever you might be envious of is\nreally your equal\nare you too equivalent which is to say\ncould we swap you for the other person\nwithout anyone noticing\ndoes this person have more experience\nthan you does this person come from a\nbackground that may have given them\nadvantages in certain ways does this\nperson have other skills or traits or\ntalents or abilities that might\ninfluence the perceived disparity if so\nmaybe it's not exactly true that the two\nof you are equals in every sense and\ncreating a kind of psychic distance\nbetween the two of you might help to\nmitigate your felt sense of envy\nanother Avenue of attack is to address\nthe idea of a perceived good I've\nnoticed that we as a society tend to\nascribe the attribute of good to things\nthat are more properly neutral\nfor instance money is not inherently\ngood\nfor many folks money accelerates their\nself-destruction\na relationship is not inherently good\nmany folks are abiding in abusive or\nhateful relationships right now\npower is not inherently good the more\npowerful you are the more you become a\ntarget for others animosity\nfrom a stoic perspective the things that\npeople tend to feel envious about are\ngenerally not Goods but neutrals and the\nproper attitude to maintain towards\nneutrals is one of indifference the\nsheer fact that someone has money or a\nrelationship or power tells us nothing\nabout the goodness of the person or his\nor her internal happiness reminding\nyourself of this can help to dismantle\nthe emotion of envy\nand now we come to the Third Avenue of\nattack as suggested by my definition the\nidea of a perceived deficit chances are\nvery good that if you're watching this\nyou're neither the best in the history\nof the world at something nor the worst\nin the history of the world at something\nthis means that there is always a bigger\nfish and that you are the bigger fish\nrelative to certain others it's also\nvery likely that in the near infinite\ndomain Of Human Action you are neither\nbetter nor worse in all aspects of being\nthan any other specific individual this\nmeans that whomever you are envious of\nhas traits or abilities that aren't as\nimpressive as yours\nfocus on these Instead This is a\ndownward comparison that can do a lot to\nalleviate feelings of envy\nEnvy is a complex emotion and there's a\nlot more I could say about it these are\njust some initial thoughts in general if\nyou understand how an emotion is\nconstructed you can also learn how to\neffectively dismantle it I hope these\ntips help what do you think got any tips\nof your own if so let me know in the\ncomments below and thank you for\nlistening"
