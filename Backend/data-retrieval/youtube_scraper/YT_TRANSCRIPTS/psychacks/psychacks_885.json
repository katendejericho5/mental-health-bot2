    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is turn the\nother cheek so this phrase is an\nallusion to a verse in the Bible namely\nMatthew chapter 5 verse 39 in which\nJesus says but I say unto you that ye\nresist not evil\nbut whosoever shall smite thee on the\nright cheek turn to him the other also\nnow this is an interesting piece of\nadvice and I think there are many\ndifferent ways that we can interpret\nthis it's usually understood as an\nexhortation to meekness or as a model\nfor non-violent action however I'm going\nto offer a slightly different\ninterpretation of this saying that I\nbelieve is actually fairly aligned with\nwhat we might understand about human\npsychology\nbut before I do please remember to Smite\nthat like button and subscribe to this\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and you can consider\nit your good deed for the day so do the\nthing\nnow one of the reasons why turning the\nother cheek can be extremely effective\nis that it's for the victim not the\naggressor to decide when he has been\nharmed\nlet me explain what I mean let's start\nwith the idea that there is no such\nobjective thing as a weapon\na hand can be a tool or it can be a\nweapon a word can be a tool or it can be\na weapon a knife can be a tool or it can\nbe a weapon Etc anything can be a weapon\nif it's utilized with a certain\nintention which is the intention to\ninflict harm\nbut here's the crazy thing you might\nintend to inflict harm on me\nbut I'm the one who gets to decide\nwhether I'm actually harmed\non some level you don't know if you've\nsucceeded in inflicting harm on me until\nI wince or cry out or become outraged or\notherwise Express in words or actions\nthat I have in fact been harmed you\ndon't know until I do that\nif someone uses an object with the\nintention to inflict harm\nand I communicate that I was in fact\nharmed\nthen it's my response that actually\ntransforms that object into a weapon\nand if someone uses an object as a\nweapon\nbut I communicate that I was in fact not\nharmed\nthen my response deweaponizes the object\nand that's what turning the other cheek\neffectively does it's a way of\ncommunicating that you are not harmed\ndespite the intention of the others\nwhich literally disarms them\nthey might still have the object but\nthey no longer have the weapon\nand what does this accomplish well when\nsomeone sees that a certain strategy did\nnot have the desired outcome\nthat person is less likely to use that\nstrategy again in the future\nturning the other cheek functionally\nputs aggression on an Extinction\nProtocol\nby robbing it of its reinforcement\nmechanism\nthe satisfaction of its intended purpose\nto inflict harm\nand this would generally serve to reduce\nthe frequency of aggression which might\nactually do more to create peace on\nEarth than a lot of the other things\nthat people are subject to trying now\nthere is an important caveat to this\nturning the other cheek will actually\ndisarm a lot of situations however in a\nminority of cases it can lead to a sort\nof Cool Hand Luke situation that tends\nto escalate\nthe situation by applying more forceful\nmethods and of course we see just that\nin the story of Jesus as well\nso the covab here is something like if\nyou're going to turn the other cheek\nbe prepared to turn every cheek that you\nhave because there's a chance that the\nother person will escalate\nthat said in the vast majority of cases\nonce a person sees that their attempt to\ninflict harm was unsuccessful by your\nnon-reactivity and your\nnon-defensiveness he's going to drop\nthat weapon and not pick it up again\nbecause it didn't work\nand that's because it's for you to\ndetermine what is and is not a weapon by\ncommunicating whether harm has in fact\nbeen inflicted upon you\nsomething to sit with\nwhat do you think\nlet me know your thoughts in the\ncomments below and thank you for\nlistening"
