    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the Trap\nof a good enough life\none of psychotherapy's Dirty Secrets is\nthat the variable that is most reliably\npredictive\nof patient Improvement\nis patient misery\nthis means that the more unhappy\ndysfunctional or miserable people are\nwhen they show up for therapy the more\nlikely they will benefit from therapy\nand this kind of makes sense well life\ncan always get worse it's more likely\nthat life will get better\nif life is particularly difficult\nalready this is called regression\ntowards the mean over time circumstances\nthat are bad tend to improve kinda on\nthe balance of things\nand this means that if you're going\nthrough a tough time the risk reward\nprofile is in your favor the worse your\nlife is the more likely a change will\nincrease the quality of your life which\nmeans low risk High reward the issue is\nthat this works in the other direction\nas well\nnow before I explain the Crux of this\nproblem please like this episode And\nsubscribe to the channel\nit takes less than a second costs you\nnothing and has a very favorable risk\nreward profile so do the thing\nnow what's the issue here the issue is\nthat the better your life is the more\nlikely a change will decrease the\nquality of your life and at the very\nhighest levels of performance people\nstrive to keep things as solid and\nconsistent as possible\nthis is because the better your life is\nthe more unfavorable the risk reward\nprofile associated with change becomes\nwhich means high risk low reward\nnow at any given moment most people\naren't in a really bad spot\nand even fewer are in a really good spot\nin fact most people are living a good\nenough life\nif we were to give the lives of most\npeople a grade like in school they're\nliving a kind of B minus life\nthey look around and they say okay it\ncould be better but it could definitely\nbe worse\nand because they're living a good enough\nlife and because of the principle of\nregression towards the mean\ncontemplating A Change Is risky\nI mean there are more grades below a B\nminus than there are above a B minus so\nall things being equal A change is more\nlikely to make the situation worse\nthat said there are very few people who\nare going to feel proud and fulfilled\nwith a B minus life\nand living a B minus life can be\nassociated with neurotic symptoms of\nanxiety depression and quiet desperation\nso not taking a risk is also a risk\non some Level A B minus life is actually\nmore dangerous than a d plus life\nbecause as we've seen misery is actually\nhighly unstable and very motivating\npeople in acute pain are much more\nlikely to take action to change their\nsituation and changing their situation\nis more likely to result in an\nimprovement because of regression\ntowards the mean on the other hand a B\nminus life is pre-stable\nand does not motivate action as change\nin this situation is more likely to\nresult in a depreciation\nthe D plus life is looking to secure\ngain\nthe B minus life is looking to prevent\nloss\nas a result the B minus life traps\npeople in action with the fear that\nthings could be worse which is certainly\ntrue but it's also true that inaction\nwon't allow things to get better\na B minus life is like standing on 16 in\nblackjack\nif you hit there's a high chance you're\ngoing to bust if you stand there's a\nhigh chance that you'll be beaten by the\nhouse it's not a great position to be in\nthe objective here is to live a life\nthat you can look back on without regret\nand you cannot live a B minus life and\nAchieve that objective\nsuch a life is exemplary\nachieving that objective requires a\nresponse to life that is risky\nadventurous and unconventional\nhowever nothing ventured nothing gained\nbeware the good enough life\nwhat do you think let me know your\nthoughts in the comments below and thank\nyou for listening"
