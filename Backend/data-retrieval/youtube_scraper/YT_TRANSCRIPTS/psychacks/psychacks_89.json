    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is many\nwomen are construction workers now I\ndon't mean this literally men still\noverwhelmingly dominate the construction\nindustry as they do all Industries\nassociated with the critical\ninfrastructure necessary to maintain\ncivilization so thank you men I mean\nthis metaphorically a lot of women are\nmetaphorical construction workers and\nI'll explain what that means in this\nepisode now this isn't true for all\nwomen it's true for a specific class of\nwomen but I'm calling attention to this\nclass because these women are\nsimultaneously very attractive to a lot\nof men and also potentially very\ndangerous to a lot of men as well let's\nget to it to begin with let's imagine\nwhat it might be like to be a\nconstruction worker it shouldn't take\nmuch effort to understand that this is a\ndifficult and demanding job it requires\na good deal of physical strength and\nendurance and for that reason it's kind\nof a young man's game this is because\nthose attributes all things being equal\ntend to decrease in men as a function of\ntime and this makes construction a risky\njob why because any of those guys are\npotentially one injury away from a\nforced retirement and if these were\nworkers don't have any other education\nor experience to speak of then they are\ngoing to be particularly vulnerable to\nthis outcome as they're functionally\nworking without a safety net it doesn't\ntake a good deal of perspicacity to\nunderstand that the job will become\nharder and riskier as they age which is\nwhy any young man working construction\nwith an ounce of vision is going to\nstart looking for a way out shortly\nafter he's found a way in\nand for guys who want to remain in the\nfield this typically means a promotion\nto a supervisory or managerial role\nsomething much less physically demanding\nand until that\nhappens the guy is going to be in a\nfairly stressful and anxiety-provoking\nsituation this is not only because he\nmight not have a backup plan if the\ncurrent plan somehow goes sideways but\nbecause he will also age out of the\ncurrent plan if he can't secure a\npromotion even if nothing else goes\nAry and it's in this sense that some\nwomen are construction workers and which\nwomen are we talking about here the\nwomen who don't really have anything\nelse going on in their\nlives let me explain this type of woman\nmight have a very low-paying job with no\ncareer prospects to speak of or she\nmight have no job whatsoever she is\ngenerally not an active participant in a\npersonally relevant community and she\ntypically does not have a network of\nfriends or family to support her she may\nnot even have any real Hobbies or\ninterests and finds it difficult to fill\nher time with constructive or meaningful\naction this all typically means that\nshe's fairly young as it's hard to\npersist in that state indefinitely know\nanyone like this now this type of woman\nis actually very attractive to a lot of\nmen because men look at her and think\nwow this is great she's not tied up in\nher career because she doesn't have one\nshe's not going to prioritize her\nfriends over me because she doesn't have\nany and she's not going to complicate\nour arrangement with a lot of\npre-existing commitments because she\nain't got none fantastic this woman is\ngoing to fit right in my frame she won't\nneed to accommodate her life to mine\nbecause frankly she doesn't have a life\nto speak of I'll provide the structure\nand she'll just fit right in and that\ncertainly can happen however this\nsituation often comes with a number of\nhidden liabilities in the first place if\na woman does not have a life of her own\nthen you will become her life and that's\nnot nearly as attractive as you might\nthink this is because a woman with no\nlife of her own is going to put enormous\npressure on the relationship to provide\nthings that it might be easier and more\nappropriate for her to get outside of\nthe\nrelationship whether she's conscious of\nit or not she will will expect that you\ndeliver not only what is appropriate for\na romantic partner to provide but what\nis appropriate for a career and a friend\ngroup and a community to provide as well\nyou will need to provide her with all\nher meaning and fulfillment and\nstimulation which is a very tall order\nto say the least Arrangements like these\nare unintentionally set up to fail\nbecause no man can be nor should be all\nthings to a woman now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing then please consider sending\nthis episode to someone who might\nbenefit from its message because it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to make the channel grow I'm\nalso proud to announce that I'll soon be\npublishing my book the value of others\nso if you'd like to learn more about\nthat you can go to my website and sign\nup for my Weekly Newsletter finally\nplease fill out an inquiry form on my\nwebsite if you're looking to book a paid\nconsultation the link is in the\ndescription\nokay let's get back to it now just like\ntheir counterparts in construction these\nwomen understand that they're playing a\nYoung Person's game this is because the\nattributes that typically motivate a man\nto offer a lifestyle structure to her\nthat is her Youth and physical\nattractiveness tend to decrease as a\nfunction of time and this makes her\nposition risky why because a woman like\nthis is potentially one breakup away\nfrom living on the street and if a woman\ndoesn't have any other skills or\nresources to speak of then she is going\nto be\npotentially very vulnerable to this\noutcome as she is functionally working\nwithout a safety net it doesn't take a\ngood deal of perspicacity to understand\nthat her position will become riskier\nand more tenuous as she Ages which is\nwhy a young woman like this with an\nounce of vision is going to start\nlooking for a way out shortly after\nshe's found a way in and for ladies who\nwant to remain in the field this\ntypically means a promotion to a spousal\nrole something capable of providing her\nwith a material safety net and until\nthat happens she's going to be in a\nfairly stressful and anxiety-provoking\nsituation this is not only because she\nmight not have a backup if the current\nplan somehow goes sideways but because\nshe will also age out of the current\nplan if she can't secure a promotion\neven if nothing else goes\narai this is why these women push the\nhardest and the fastest for marriage in\nthe absence of their own extrapolated\nlifestyle they don't have a safety net\nwhich is why they will demand one from\nthe men in their lives a woman with\nnothing else going on will feel very\nanxious and insecure without a ring on\nthe other hand a woman with her own\nskills and resources will be much less\npushy this is because she knows that\neven if the relationship were to end\nshe'd be able to land on her feet\nunfortunately the women who tend to\ndemand the legal commitment are those\nwho are least in the position to do\nso and it's easy to understand why\nthey're not about to walk away if they\ndon't get what they want after all a job\nwithout security is better than no job\nat all such women monkey Branch to\nanother man but they certainly won't\nmake good on their threats without a\ncompelling\nalternative it's also important to\nconsider that according to the family\nlawyers with whom I've spoken the most\nacrimonious and litigious divorces\nalmost always involve\nHousewives since these women often did\nnot develop their own lives or careers\nthey are generally out for blood when\nthe relationship that functionally\nconstituted their existence is brought\nto an end\nwithout lives outside of their\nrelationships these women are both\naggressive in courtship and contentious\nin divorce to my mind it's a much better\nidea to find a woman for a long-term\nrelationship who has her own life but\nwho is willing and able to make the\nprimary relationship a priority this\nallows both parties to be grounded\nstable and appropriately\ninterdependent what do you think does\nthis fit with your own experience let me\nknow in the comments below as always I\nappreciate your support
