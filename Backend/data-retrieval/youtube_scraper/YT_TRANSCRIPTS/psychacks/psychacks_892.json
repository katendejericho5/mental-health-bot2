    "transcript": "one of the primary drivers of family\nconflict is people don't seem to know\ntheir emotional limits\nand a lot of folks approach spending\ntime with their family during the\nholidays like a starving person\napproaches food they think I haven't\nseen these people in a long time I don't\nknow when I will see these people again\nI need to cram as much interaction with\nthese folks as I can in a short amount\nof time as possible because I don't know\nhow many more opportunities I will have\nI don't know how when it will be that I\nwill see these folks again and so they\njust stuff themselves and it's a\nsickening experience for a lot of folks\nunfortunately so the idea here is to\nis to approach time with your family\nlike you would approach food uh just\nbecause you'll be hungry in the future\nagain doesn't mean that you have to\nstuff yourself now\nfamily portion control"
