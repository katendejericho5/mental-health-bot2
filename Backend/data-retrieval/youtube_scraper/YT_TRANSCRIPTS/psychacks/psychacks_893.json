    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is dominance\nis psychological not physical\nthis is something I want the men out\nthere to pay attention to there's a lot\nof talk on the internet about becoming a\nmore dominant man\nabout becoming an alpha man and this\nprocess is almost always tied to some\nsort of physical attribute lift weights\nget bigger get stronger and I'm not\nsaying that those are not worthy goals\nmen all things being equal you should\nstrive to be in the best shape of your\nlives however there is an important way\nin which this advice tends to do men a\ndisservice and that's what I'm going to\ntalk about here today but before I do\nplease remember to like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and only\na beta wouldn't follow through\nso do the thing\nnow what's the problem with this advice\nto get bigger get stronger where this\nadvice tends to fall flat is equating\npure physicality with dominance\nI'm here to tell you that this is not\nthe case dominance is not physical\ndominance is psychological and here's\nhow you already know that I'm right\nhave you ever seen like this big\npowerful dog\nabsolutely cowed by one of those yappy\nlittle lap dogs I'm sure you have at\nsome point in your lives they're this\nbig German Shepherd getting bossed\naround by this little Chihuahua for\nwhatever reason that German Shepherd\nforgot what it was forgot that it was\nliterally 10 times bigger than that\nChihuahua that I could bite through that\nChihuahua's trembling Little Neck\nand that Chihuahua was able to\npsychologically dominate that German\nShepherd and once that happened\nall the German Shepherds fangs all of\nits strength all of its viciousness and\nintelligence were rendered absolutely\nirrelevant\nand that's because the psychological\nmaintains dominance over the physical\nif you can dominate the psychological\nthen you can also dominate the physical\nthat it in turn dominates\nthis is true across mammalian species\nand it's certainly true in the domain of\nHuman Relationships and here's an\ninteresting corollary to all this in the\nmajority of relationships that I am\npersonally aware of the woman is more\ndominant than the man\nand why is that is it because the woman\nis bigger or stronger than the man\nabsolutely not\nif you took an average man and an\naverage woman and put them in a No Holds\nBarred bar brawl I mean it wouldn't be a\nfair contest the vast majority of men\nwould just wipe the floor with the vast\nmajority of women and I think that's one\nof the reasons why we don't do that in\nsociety we all kind of understand that\nit's just not a fair fight\nbut here's the counter argument if you\ntook an average man in an average woman\nand put them in a no-hold barred\nverbal argument\nthat contest would be just as unfair in\nthe average woman's favor\nit would be an emotional\nlike metaphorically lying on the ground\nwondering if anyone got the license\nplate of the truck that just ran him\nover women are far more Adept on average\nlet's say in\nthe emotional and psychological martial\narts\nand it's here on the field of emotion\nand psychology where the contest of\ndominance is actually fought in society\nso why is this important men if you're\nout there trying to get those gains\nthinking that bigger guns or higher T\nwill automatically translate into being\nperceived as an alpha you're not\ngrounded in reality\nthat's not how it actually is\nremember the German Shepherd and the\nChihuahua don't neglect your Fitness but\nalso don't pretend that it can give you\nmore than it can\nit might also be a good idea to learn\nhow to spar verbally\nso that you can\nkind of put up a a decent fight\nif it comes down to it\nuh what do you think let me know in the\ncomments below and thank you for\nlistening"
