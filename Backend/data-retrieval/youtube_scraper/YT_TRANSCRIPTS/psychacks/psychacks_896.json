    "transcript": "it's all there in the title dates are an\nevening activity getting coffee is not a\ndate there's a number of reasons for\nthis first of all what are you doing\nthat you're available in the middle of\nthe day the middle of the day is for\ndoing business the evening is for\nconnecting and relating but when\nbusiness hours are operating it's time\nto get things done secondly sitting down\nopposite each other in a brightly lit\nCafe over coffee suggests it's a job\ninterview we'll be talking about like a\nposition that we found on LinkedIn\nso it doesn't have the right Vibe and we\nboth people know that there's very\nlittle likelihood that you're both going\nto leave this Cafe in the middle of the\nday and go off and hook up so you're\ntaking all the possibility all the\nsexual tension out of the exchange which\nis a terrible way to start off a\nrelationship a primary sexual\nrelationship by like saying there is no\nopportunity for us to have that kind of\ntension or banter"
