    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is my needs\naren't being met\nthis phrase my needs aren't being met is\ncomplete and utter\nin fact it's worse than as not\nonly does it not tell the truth it\nreplaces the truth with a dangerous lie\nbig words I know but bear with me as I\ngive you my argument now before I spell\nout why I dislike this phrase so much\nplease remember to like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second it costs you nothing and\nit's a great way for you too to stand\nagainst the\nso what's the problem with this phrase\nso many problem it turns out it's\nabsolutely true that people have needs\nhowever the needs of human beings are\nsurprisingly small human beings do not\nneed that much in order to thrive to be\nhappy and to have satisfying\nrelationships\none of the things that human beings need\nis some measure of psychological or\nemotional safety or security and when\nthat need isn't met we call that an\nabusive relationship\nso uh why did you and Cynthia break up\noh well my needs weren't really being\nmet\nwhat do you mean well she yelled at me\nall the time tracked my movements and\ntried to get me fired by spreading lies\nabout me behind my back at my job\noh\nwhen someone is in an abusive\nrelationship they don't say my needs\naren't being met they say I'm in an\nabusive relationship and this means that\nwhen people say my needs aren't being\nmet\nthey are not in an abusive relationship\nbecause if they were they would say I'm\nin an abusive relationship an abusive\nrelationship is one in which you don't\nget what you need\nso what are people actually saying when\nthey use this phrase what they are\nreally saying is I'm not getting what I\nwant in this relationship\nthis is so much more honest and it's a\nmore useful statement for a number of\nreasons first of all if you're going\naround telling people that your needs\naren't being met it makes your partner\nor your ex out to be worse than they\nprobably are why is that because it's\none thing to not give somebody what they\nwant\nand that's another thing altogether to\nnot give somebody what they need what a\ncruel and neglectful ogre he must not\nhave had a shred of human decency you\npoor thing and what does this do well it\ngives the person saying this a little\npatina a victimhood a patina that they\nlikely would not be entitled to if they\nwere more honest and said I'm not\ngetting what I want leaving a\nrelationship because you are not getting\nwhat you need is blameless and\ncourageous leaving a relationship\nbecause you are not getting what you\nwant is callous and selfish at least\nthat's what we tend to think as a\nsociety though in my own personal\nestimation what better reason can you\ngive for leaving a relationship than the\nfact that you're not getting what you\nwant\nthat's why you entered into the\nrelationship to begin with right you\ndidn't go there to get what you need you\nwent there to get what you want so if\ngetting what you want is sufficient\nreason to start a relationship not\ngetting what you want should be\nsufficient reason to end one\nnow reframing this statement I'm not\ngetting what I want\nis much more useful than insisting that\nI'm not getting what I need for several\nreasons\nthere's really only one reason why\npeople don't get what they need they're\nin Cruel oppressive and uncaring\nenvironments\nhowever there are many reasons why a\nperson might not get what they want\none of which is they don't know how to\nget it\nand that wouldn't necessarily be the\nother person's fault now would it\nanother is that they couldn't afford it\nwe why complain that a steakhouse is\nunaffordable to most people it's a\nsteakhouse eat somewhere else if the\nprices are too high\ndo you see when people go around saying\nmy needs aren't being met they're kind\nof publicly not admitting their role in\nthat outcome and this means that such\npeople cut themselves off from the\npossibility of learning why they are\nthey might not be getting what they want\nwhich reduces the likelihood that they\never will get what they want either in\nthis relationship or the next\nfinally when people conflate wants for\nneeds then people's wants become imbued\nwith this kind of existential urgency\nany possibility of not getting what you\nwant then becomes a threat to basic\nsurvival which is what would happen if\nthey don't get what they need\nand this is almost certainly a\nhyperbolic Distortion of the actual\nsituation in which they find themselves\nadding this kind of urgent intensity\nto simple preference\ncan make relationships unstable\nexhausting and manipulative\nnot a good idea\nin general it's useful to be honest with\nothers but it's even more useful to be\nhonest with yourself\nand it's actually very empowering to\nadmit yeah I'm not getting what I want\nhere\nI'm gonna go someplace else\nit's closer to the truth and it allows\nfor some degree of responsibility for\nthe creation of that outcome\nwhat do you think let me know in the\ncomments below and thank you for\nlistening"
