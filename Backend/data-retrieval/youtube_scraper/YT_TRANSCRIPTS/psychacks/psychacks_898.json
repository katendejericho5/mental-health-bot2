    "transcript": "this is something that I figured out\nfrom long distance running you only have\nto be able to do half why because once\nyou get to the halfway point and you\nhave a half left you already have\nempirical evidence that you can do the\nremainder because it's exactly equal to\nwhat you've already done\nso this is really useful about breaking\ndown big projects or long distance runs\nyou only have to be able to do half and\nthat's enough proof that you can\ncomplete the task"
