    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe invisibility of loss\nwhen you pass through a significant\ntragedy death disease betrayal\nit changes who you are and it changes\nhow you see reality you cannot go back\nto the person you were before which is\npart of the grief associated with\ntragedy it means in part grieving the\nloss of the person you used to be\nand the change is so great that we can\nbasically say that there are two groups\nof people those who have passed through\ntragedy and those who haven't passed\nthrough tragedy\nyet\nI say it like that because nobody\nescapes being touched by a loss at some\npoint in their lives so everyone ends up\nin the first category over a long enough\ntimeline but until that happens there\nare these two groups of people now\nbefore I explain the importance of this\ndistinction please remember to like this\nepisode And subscribe to this channel it\ntakes less than a second costs you\nnothing and it's an easy way for you to\nshow your support so do the thing\nnow\nthese two groups\nfundamentally separate Humanity it's\nalmost like they live in two different\nrealities for better for worse I\nexperienced a great deal of death and\nloss and suffering from a young age\nand sometimes I would try to talk to my\nfriends about some of the things that I\nwas going through\nand they would simply blanch\nlook uncomfortable and change the\nsubject\nand I eventually understood that they\njust had no frame of reference to begin\nto comprehend some of the things that I\nwas going through like they literally\ncould not think them because they were\nso foreign to their experience\nI learned that talking about certain\nthings with certain people just made\nthem uncomfortable and I wouldn't be\nunderstood anyway so I just stopped\ntalking about them and buried them\ninside of me I used to think that I was\ncursed to have gone through so much pain\nand loss and suffering now I understand\nthat I wasn't the only person to pass\nthrough tragedy and many people have it\nmuch worse than I did\njust that I was one of the first\npeople to pass through tragedy in my\ngeneration\nand this in fact might be of some\nbenefit to me for two reasons first it\nmay allow me to be of some real help to\nothers when they do inevitably pass\nthrough loss in a way they might not\nhave been able to be of help to me and\nsecond it potentially allowed me to\nunderstand at an earlier age what was\nreally important in life\nsometimes people only figure that out at\nthe end of their lives and that's a real\ntragedy\nnow as I've said passing through tragedy\nchanges who you are and how you see\nreality and that means that certain\naspects of reality are just invisible to\nfolks until they've also been touched by\nloss and there's a really great example\nof this psychological truth in Harry\nPotter of all places so allow me to\nshare it with you\nwhen Harry and the others first come to\nHogwarts they get off the train at the\nstation and they get loaded into these\napparently magical self-driving\ncarriages that Ferry them from the\nstation up to Hogwarts proper how\ndelightful now Harry is no stranger to\nsuffering however it's not until the end\nof the third year when Harry Witnesses\nthe death of his Godfather that he comes\nin to direct conscious contact with\ndeath\nand when he gets off the train to start\nhis fourth year he sees that the magical\ncarriages rather than driving themselves\nto Hogwarts are actually hitched to\nthese terrifying creatures called\nthestrals they're these black skeletal\nhorses with bat wings and they totally\nfreaked Harry the frick out and he tries\nto point them out to Ron and Hermione\nwho seem totally chill about these\nthings and they just think Harry is nuts\nand that's because they can't see them\napparently none of the kids can see them\nnone of the kids except for Luna whose\nmother died a few years back so Luna has\nseen the thestral since day one and she\ntells Harry yeah only people who have\nbeen touched by death can see the\nthestrals people think I'm crazy\nbut that's okay I know that they'll see\nthem eventually\nso innocence is a kind of guardianship\nbut in this role innocence also prevents\npeople from seeing the true nature of\nreality the festrals are real it's their\ninvisibility that is the illusion\nbecause it's and it's absolutely useless\nto point that out to people until they\npass through loss themselves as they\nvery literally can't see something\ninvisible\nbut don't worry\nit's only a matter of time before they\ndo so it's generally a good idea to be\nkind to each other\nwhat do you think let me know in the\ncomments below\nand thank you for listening"
