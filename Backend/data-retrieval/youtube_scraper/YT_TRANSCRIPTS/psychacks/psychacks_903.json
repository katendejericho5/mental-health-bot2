    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why the\npeople you like don't like you back have\nyou ever noticed this have you ever\nnoticed that when you seem to be really\ninterested in somebody they never seem\nto reciprocate your feelings on the\nother hand have you ever noticed that\nwhen you can kind of take or leave\nsomebody they seem to be really\ninterested in you isn't that sort of the\nironic tragedy of dating\nI've experienced this phenomenon from\nboth directions over the course of my\nlife and it took me a long while to\nfigure this one out however before I\nshare this Insight with you please\nremember to like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\na great way to begin to get involved in\nthe community so do the thing\nnow\nthis phenomenon occurs because people\nare making a fundamental mistake when it\ncomes to dating and attraction most\npeople are not conscious of this mistake\nbut as soon as I bring it to your\nattention you will likely see it in\noperation in your own life it's very\neasy to communicate the mistake is that\nfolks generally treat the people they\nare attracted to differently from the\npeople they are not attracted to and why\nis this a mistake well think about it\nwhatever you're doing with respect to\nthe people you are not attracted to\nis working\nthose are the people who are actually\npursuing you and are trying to enter\ninto a relationship with you whatever\nyou're doing there is working however\nthere's this belief that whatever you're\ndoing wouldn't or shouldn't work on the\nhotter women or the men that you really\nwant to get married to and that's not\ntrue\nwhat works on the women you're not\nattracted to works on the women you are\nattracted to what works on the menu\ndon't want to have a relationship with\nworks on the men you do want a\nrelationship with\nand this is because the men or women\nthat you are attracted to\nare not different from the men and the\nwomen you are not attracted to why\nbecause that attraction exists only in\nyour own head it's not an objective\nempirical fact there are not two species\nof people one of which you are attracted\nto and the other of which you are not\nthere's just one species people\nand what works on people in general will\nwork on people in particular\nirrespective of your subjective\nattraction\nand just what is it that works in the\npeople that you're not attracted to and\nthat will work on the people that you\nare if you use it\nindifference\nit's the take it or leave it attitude\nthat increases attraction yeah they're\nnice yeah yeah there's nothing wrong\nwith them and yeah there's probably\nsomebody better out there that's the\nattitude\nyou spend time with them great and if\nyou don't\nyou're not really going to miss him\nyou're certainly not going to pursue\nthem or worry about them or anxiously\nwait by the phone that's the correct\nattitude to have toward the people that\nyou are attracted to\nthis isn't easy at first and it's\nprobably not going to feel very\nauthentic however you don't necessarily\njust abandon what works in other parts\nof your life because you feel a certain\nway\nthe good news is that you already know\nthat this approach works because it's\nlikely already achieved the desired\nresult albeit with the undesired Target\nmany times in your past so it's a pretty\nlow risk proposition\nI have more to say on the subject but\nI'll leave it for my next episode in the\nmeantime let me know what you think in\nthe comments below and thank you for\nlistening"
