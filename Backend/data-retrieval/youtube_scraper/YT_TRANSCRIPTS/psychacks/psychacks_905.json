    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is surviving\ntoxic family during the holidays the\nholidays are upon us my friends for many\nthis is a restful enjoyable time where\nthey can spend Precious Moments with\nloved ones and family\nfor others it is a landmine of conflict\nand despair\nthis episode is for those in the second\ncategory in the years I spent an\noutpatient addiction\nI learned the importance of holiday\nsafety planning and that's exactly what\nwe're going to do here today there's a\nnumber of things that you can do to keep\nyourself emotionally safe while you're\nin the belly of the Beast now before I\nget into them please remember to like\nthis episode And subscribe to the\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it makes a great\nstocking stuffer so do the thing\nfirst and foremost it is important to\nremember that you can absolutely\nchoose not to spend the holidays with\nyour family yes this might ruffle some\nfeathers but might those feathers get\nruffled regardless yes they might not\nunderstand but how often do they\nunderstand you anyway\nso if you feel like it's not worth it if\nyou feel like you might not be able to\nkeep your cool or if you feel that you\nhave better things to do than suffer\nundue criticism and abuse do everyone a\nfavor and make other plans give them the\ngift of missing you this Christmas and\nmaybe things might be different in the\nfuture you have no obligation to spend\nyour time with people who devalue or\ndisrespect you even if or especially if\nthey are family super important to keep\nthat in mind now if you do choose to\nspend time with your family\nthe very best thing that you can do is\nto secure your own transportation this\nis non-negotiable rent a car I\nunderstand that this is an additional\nexpense but not having to rely on\nsomeone to take you out of a nasty\nsituation if things go sideways is well\nworth it\nwithout the ability to move around\nfreely you will likely feel trapped when\nthings go sour that's going to make\neverything very much worse very much\nmore quickly how having your own car is\nan emergency exit you might also\nconsider getting your own place to stay\nthis might feel strange to some folks\nbut then again so might feeling like a\nprisoner for a week in your childhood\nbedroom\nlet's be honest that's not really a\nplace for adults if you're an adult you\ncan secure adult accommodations\nit will take some of the pressure off\nyour hosts and will subtly communicate\nthat this is an adult to adult\nrelationship\nand it will also give you some place to\ngo if things get heated again have an\nexit strategy at minimum this means a\nplace to go and a way to get there yes\nthis can be expensive\nbut so are therapy sessions\nnext you might consider reducing the\nduration of your trip just because you\nhave a week off doesn't mean you have to\nspend a week with Mom and Uncle Jeff\nthat's a vacation you might need a\nvacation from spending a couple of days\nwith family is perfectly acceptable you\ncan even just show up for Christmas\ndinner and leave after dessert after all\nit's your holiday too there's no need to\nsurrender all your time to appease\nguilt-tripping relatives who won't be\nhappy anyway\nand finally I would strongly recommend\nthat you lay off the booze alcohol is\nalmost always involved in big family\nblow-ups I understand that folks can\nreach for the bottle in order to make\nspending time with family more tolerable\nbut it's a risky strategy if things get\nbad they're more likely to get real bad\nif alcohol is involved remember no one's\never proud that they drink too much so\nto recap get your own transportation\nsecure your own lodgings reduce the\nduration of your trip and lay off the\nbooze what do you think got any tips of\nyour own let us know in the comments\nbelow and thank you for listening"
