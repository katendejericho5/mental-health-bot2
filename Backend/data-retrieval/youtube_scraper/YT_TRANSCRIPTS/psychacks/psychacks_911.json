    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is sync\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow to be indestructible\nto understand how to become\nindestructible\nyou must first understand why you are\ndestructible to begin with leaving aside\nbasic biological vulnerabilities the way\nthat people are emotionally or\npsychologically destructible is this\nthey inappropriately identify with\nexternal reality\nnow before I explain what that means\nplease remember to like this video And\nsubscribe to this channel takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\na great way to get a little finger\nexercise\nso do the thing\nall right\npeople are destructible because they\nidentify inappropriately with external\nreality and to understand that we first\nhave to understand what identity is\nmy working definition of identity is\nthat identity is what is left over\nafter everything that can be taken from\nyou\nis taken from you\nand this is because everything that can\nbe taken from you will be taken from you\nin time\nif something can be taken from you and\nyou continue to exist after the taking\nthen clearly what was taken wasn't you\nit wasn't who you are it was something\nthat you have\nnow most things in life fall under that\ncategory they are things that you have\nnot things that you are\nthese are very obvious things like your\njob your relationships your family your\nbank account\nbut they can also be things that are\nmore intangible like for example your\nphysical attractiveness that will be\ntaken from you in time\nor your intelligence\nditto no one stays mentally acute\nforever\nthe list sort of goes on and on so\nwhat's the problem the problem shows up\nwhen people identify with these things\nthat is when they confuse something that\nthey have\nfor something that they are\nnow this is almost always unconscious\nhowever that's what kind of makes it\neven more powerful\nfolks have all kinds of core identity\nstatements in their hearts and Minds I\nam my status I am my reputation I am my\nrelationship I am my money I am my\nintelligence I am my beauty and none of\nthese statements is true\nthey are all false statements\nand it's living in falsity that makes\nyou destructible\nfalsity is like a in your armor\nthis is because if anybody attacks or\nthreatens those things you will perceive\nthem psychologically to be attacks or\nthreats on yourself\nand you will react in ineffective ways\ncommensurate with that interpretation\nso how do you become indestructible the\npath to indestructibility is basically\nthe process of systematically\nde-identifying from that which you\nfalsely and unconsciously identified\nwith sometime in your past\nor to put the same thing another way\nit is the process of systematically\nidentifying who you really are\nyou can observe your reactions to know\nif you are making progress\nif I came home one day to find that my\nmailbox was all busted up in the past I\nmight have gotten Furious I might have\nperceived that to be some kind of\npersonal attack a personal insult you\nknow I'm kind of disrespect\nbecause on some level I was identified\nwith that mailbox\neven though it was just an object I\ncould have said that with my words\nI must have felt that on some level it\nwas me otherwise my reaction wouldn't\nreally have made sense\nnowadays if that happened I'm not sure\nif I would bat an eyelash oh\na mailbox is busted I wonder how that\nhappened\nyou fixed do I need a new one\nat the end of the day it's just a\nmailbox so not that big of a deal\nnow if you can react like that with a\nmailbox\nit's a sign of progress a good first\nstep\nbut if you can react like that with your\nbeauty\nyour wealth\nyour intelligence\nyour reputation\nyour relationships\nif you can treat those things like a\nmailbox\nthen you're making real progress\nyou will understand that while you can\nhave those things in your life there\nremains a wide Gulf between what you\nhave and what you are\nand no matter what happens to what you\nhave who you are remains intact\nnow this doesn't mean that you should\nneglect or disrespect the things that\nyou have I mean\nI took care of my mailbox\nI didn't venerate it I didn't obsess\nover it\nI couldn't worry about it\nI wasn't devastated when it inevitably\nfell apart\nfrom the time that I had it I took care\nof it\njust like I try my best to take care of\nmy body and my relationships and my\nreputation\nwell I have them\neven though I will lose them all in time\nde-identification does not mean neglect\nor disrespect but it does mean holding\nthings lightly\nenjoy and appreciate them while you have\nthem\nand surrender them with love and\ngratitude when it's time to let them go\nif you can do that if you can identify\nyourself with yourself\nno more and no less then\nwho can have power over you\nother people Society reality itself will\nhave no leverage over you\nleverage can only exert influence over\nwhat you have\nand what you have is only yours to a\npoint because you will have to give it\nback whether you want to or not\nif you succeed in de-identifying who you\nare from what you have then you will\nbecome indestructible\nimpervious to any form of coercion\nmanipulation or domination\neither overt or carvert\nno man or woman\nwill be your master\nbecause you will be your own\nhopefully that makes sense what do you\nthink let me know in the comments below\nthank you for listening"
