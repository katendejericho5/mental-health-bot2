    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycats\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the part\nthat women always leave out so what is\nthis referring to this is referring to\nwomen's answers to the question\nwhat are you looking for in a man\nI've listened to a lot of these\nresponses in my life and what do they\ntypically sound like I want somebody\nkind somebody who makes me feel safe\nsomebody who's emotionally supportive\nsomebody who wants a family somebody\nhonest and loyal and committed\nEtc\nleaving aside the fact that and is\nexpensive all this sounds reasonable\nenough right however it turns out that\nthis response will like really messes\nwith men's Minds\nbut before I back up that claim please\ntake a moment to like this video And\nsubscribe to this channel thanks less\nthan a second cost you nothing and\nprobably Burns a calorie here too so do\nthe thing\nthe fact of the matter is that there's\nan important part that women always\nleave out when they answer this question\nand this emission really confuses men\nbecause if you're a man and you listen\nto this answer sincerely you might think\nwell geez\nI'm loyal\nand I'm caring and I'm honest and I want\na family\naren't I what women are looking for\nand of course these men typically are\nnot what women are looking for because\nthey're the ones asking what women are\nlooking for however they could be right\nabout all the other stuff they could\nactually embody the traits listed by\nthese women\nso what's the issue\nhere's part that women leave out the\npart that is really important for men to\nhear women do\nwant all of those things but they want\nthem from the men they are already\nattracted to\nsounds obvious but the inclusion kind of\nmakes a big difference women are not\nlisting the factors that cause them to\nbe attracted to some men over others\nthey are listing the criteria that\nmotivate them to choose some attractive\nmen and not other\nattractive men\nthey assume attraction and maybe believe\nit socially unacceptable to say so\nexplicitly but there it is\nand this understanding has two really\nimportant consequences first it should\ndrive home that female attraction is not\nbased on the things that women\nexplicitly list as criteria in partner\nselection remember they want these\nthings from men they're already\nattracted to which means that the\nattraction comes first\nbefore they know whether the men in\nquestion possess these sought after\ntraits\nalmost every woman has had a sexual\nrelationship with at least one man who\nhas not been loyal\nor kind or emotionally supportive or\nfamily oriented or any of the things\nthat they claim that they're looking for\nbecause they made the decision based on\ntheir attraction which logically could\nnot be based on traits that were not\npresent\nand here's the second consequence men\nwith this understanding your Prime\nobjective\nshould be to become attractive\nto become a man that women are attracted\nto\nthat's how you get your foot in the door\nand the good news is it's really good\nnews that most of the things that\nactually relate to female attraction are\nthings that you can learn and develop\nthese are things like being physically\nfit knowing how to dress learning the\nart of charming conversation choosing a\nlife mission attaining success and\npicking up some game\nthese are things that women respond to\nand these are also all skills that you\ncan learn and they all benefit you\ndirectly with the indirect benefit of\nmaking you more attractive to women so\nwhat's the hold up Gents\nand that's what I have for you today if\nyou like this please be sure to check\nout my playlists on similar topics and\nlet me know what you think in the\ncomments below\nthanks for listening"
