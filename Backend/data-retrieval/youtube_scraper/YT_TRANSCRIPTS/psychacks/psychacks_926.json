    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why\npeople get married when they do\nI think this is going to be a really\ninteresting episode as the answer to\nthis question is not only elegant but\nit's substantiated across several\nindependent Frameworks as well\nnow I'm going to be building on the data\nthat I presented in my previous episode\nPeak sexual Marketplace value in which\nwe looked at desirability indices in\nheterosexual couplings on a dating app\ncheck out that episode for more\ninformation\none of the many results of that study\nwas that according to men women are most\ndesirable at 18 years old and according\nto women men are most desirable at 50\nyears old this was a conclusion\ncorroborated by millions of private\nAnonymous data points however as\nsurprising as this might be there's an\neven more fascinating conclusion that\ncan be drawn from the data this wasn't\ntalked about in the paper this is my own\nTheory but I think it checks out and we\ncan always test it out as we'll see\nlater in the episode now before I\nexplain what this theory is please\nremember to like this video And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\nhow you can support me and my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld thank you for your help\nall right back to the study according to\nthe researchers women's desirability\nstarts really high right at 18. and\nwhile it sort of Falls precipitously\nover the lifespan it also kind of takes\na while to do that\nmost significantly average female\ndesirability remains higher than average\nmale desirability for quite some time\nthe researchers in this study plotted\nthe desirability in the Seas of men and\nwomen on two separate charts they\nbasically\nlook like this\nthis is the women's this is the man's\nyou can see the women start high and\nfall the women's The Men start low\nand get higher\nnow what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\noverlay these charts as if they were on\nthe same y-axis which plots desirability\nand here's what that would look like\nokay now where do the two lines cross\nwell as you can see they cross right\nabout here\nright about here at\n30 years old\nso\nwho cares\nwell you could argue that this is pretty\nmuch the most significant event that has\nhappened to the participants in the\nsexual Marketplace up until that point\nin their lives think about it this point\nmarks the moment when the average\nwoman's desirability her normalized\nsexual Marketplace value drops below the\naverage man's desirability his\nnormalized sexual Marketplace value for\nthe very first time\nfrom that point on a woman's\ndesirability is a depreciating asset and\na man's desirability is an appreciating\nasset not just absolutely which was\napparently always the case but\nrelatively and that has to impact the\nway men and women relate to each other\nthose of you who have made it this far\nalready know the dating game changes\nsignificantly after 30. and this might\nbe why potentially for the very first\ntime in their lives the man might be\nconsidered more desirable than the woman\nand that's got to create some changes in\nthe dynamic between men and women don't\nyou think\nnow what also happens around the age of\n30. well according to the U.S census in\n2021 the median age for women at first\nmarriage was 29. in the median age for\nmen at first marriage was 30 or to put\nit another way marriage typically occurs\nat the last moment that women enjoy a\nsuperiority over men in terms of average\ndesirability\nisn't that interesting\nand why might that be well to the extent\nthat I'm correct marriage occurs at this\ntime because it's clearly in the woman's\nbest interest to do so\nfrom a pure Game Theory perspective it's\none of the most optimal moves a woman\ncan make in the sexual Marketplace think\nabout it the longer he lives the more\ndesirable the man becomes on average\nwhereas the opposite is true for women\ngiven that the same woman may not be\nable to secure commitment from the same\nman in even a few years time\nsecuring a lifetime commitment while the\ndesirability Gap still favors her is\nclearly in the woman's best interests\nand it will become as it will become\nincreasingly harder for her to do so\nwith men of comparable quality as time\ngoes on\nand to the extent that she is more\ndesirable\nthe woman would still have more power in\nthe relationship to dictate more\nfavorable terms for herself\ncouple this with the fact that the man\nmay as yet be naive to the Privileges\nthat come from a favorable desirability\nGap and you have a recipe for settling\ndown\nthis is why I say that all women play\nBlackjack\nthey want to get as close to 21 the bus\ncard as they can without going over\nand while it's not true that women are\nout of the game at 30\nwhen the desirability gap between men\nand women switches it does seem true\nthat the average woman will be fighting\nan uphill battle from there on out\nso it would make sense to stand as close\nto that point as possible this is not\nonly rational it's very very very smart\nnow this is just a theory but we can\nalso test it out to the extent that this\nis true there are two falsifiable\npredictions that we can make to test\nthis hypothesis in the first place we\ncan predict that if similar studies were\nconducted in different cultures women's\nage at first marriage will occur right\nbefore the age at which the desirability\nGap switches and in the second place we\ncan predict that in no culture will the\nwoman's age at first marriage exceed the\nage at which the desirability gaps which\noccurs so if you want to prove me wrong\ndon't yell at me or give me anecdotal\nevidence just find the data that's how\nyou can do it\nso that's my theory as to why people get\nmarried when they do if a woman\nperceives that her desirability is\nlikely to soon fall below a man's\ndesirability the decision to push for\ncommitment at that time is entirely\nrational and in her best interests so\nthis can't just be a coincidence\nand people say women are the irrational\nsex if that were true this is not what\nthe data would look like\nwhat do you think please let me know in\nthe comments below and thank you for\nlistening"
