    "transcript": "in a previous episode I discussed why\nromance is a poor man's game namely it\nallows lower status men to compete with\nhigher status men for desirable women\nand how do these men do this well that's\nthe subject of my most recent episode\nthe truth about romance solipsism\nsolipsism is a fancy word for the belief\nthat only you exist in a romantic\ncontext the solipsism is the belief that\nonly two exist the lover and the loved\none and we exist apart in a universe\nunto ourselves and you hear this all the\ntime in our everyday discourse about\nromance it's like us against the world\nwe don't need anybody else our love is\nsufficient things like that so we can\nsee that the way that romance works is\nit's sort of like a a spell it's an\nincantation designed to draw the loved\none away from reality away from anything\nthat would disrupt the effectiveness of\nthe spell so that the loved one is then\nfree to merge with the lover in a\nuniverse of two\ncheck it out"
