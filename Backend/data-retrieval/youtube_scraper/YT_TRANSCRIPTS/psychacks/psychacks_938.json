    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is neglected\nkinds of love\nspace\nso this is a continuation of my series\nentitled neglected kinds of love in\nwhich I look at the concept of Love\nthrough a spiritual lens by examining\nhow the divine's relationship to the\ncreated Universe reveals properties of\nlove and one such neglected property\nthat I'd like to discuss today is space\nI'm going to argue that space is an\nattribute of love a kind of loving but\nbefore I get into it please remember to\nlike this video And subscribe to this\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it's how you can\nsupport me in my mission to deliver free\nhigh quality content to the world thanks\nfor your help\nusually when we think of loving we think\nof closeness we think of togetherness we\nthink of merging with the loved one\nhowever I would like to argue that space\nthat separation is also an attribute of\nlove\nspace is the container of all that\nexists from a purely physical\nperspective space is the field in which\nmatter exists everything that exists\nmaterially exists in space without the\ncontainer of space no life is possible\nit would have no place to be so you can\nsee that space the field within which\nlife becomes possible is a form of\ngenerosity it allows life to exist\ntherefore It's a Kind of Love\nspace is also useful for example it's\nthe empty spaces of a house that we live\nin It's The Emptiness of the cup that\nholds the drink we build structure but\nwe use emptiness without space there is\nlittle that can be done space is also an\nextremely important component of passion\nand sexuality one way to extinguish a\nfire is to smother it\nspace to sexuality is like heir to a\nconflagration it's the element that\nallows combustion to occur without it\nthere is no flame of passion\nfinally space implies freedom\nit does nothing to impede the motion of\nphysical bodies through it\nso we can see that there's a kind of\ntrust and respect in space it suggests\nthat you're allowed to go where your\nmotion naturally impels you to go\nrecognizing space as an attribute of\nlove is to understand that freedom of\nmovement is an essential component of\nloving it deserves greater appreciation\nin the collective consciousness what do\nyou think please remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations consultations\nand sponsorship opportunities\nthanks for listening"
