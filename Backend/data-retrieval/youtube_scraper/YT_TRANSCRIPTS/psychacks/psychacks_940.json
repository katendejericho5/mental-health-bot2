    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cytax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is what is\nconfidence so in a previous episode\nthree steps to becoming more confident I\ndiscussed how the recipe for the\ncultivation of confidence is contained\nin my working definition of that concept\nnamely that confidence is the consistent\nfelt experience of success however\nthere's a mystery in the word confidence\nthat can Elevate our understanding of\nthe concept even further but before I\nexplain what that mystery is please\nremember to like this video And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you zero cents and\nit's how you can support me and my\nmission to deliver free high quality\ncontent to the world thank you for your\nhelp\nso there's a mystery in the word\nconfidence that is revealed by examining\nits etymology\nconfidence is a word from Latin it comes\nfrom the words Khan meaning with and\nFidelis meaning faith\nso confidence literally means with faith\nor Faithfully\nwhich is kind of weird in modern\nparlance when we talk about confidence\nwe usually don't think we're talking\nabout faith\nso what's going on why might confidence\nmean Faithfully well when do you most\nneed confidence you need confidence when\nyou're entering into a situation where\nyou don't yet know the outcome you don't\nthat you don't yet know whether you\nactually will be able to emerge\nVictorious or you don't yet know whether\nyou'll actually be able to do what is\nasked or expected of you you haven't\ndone it yet you can't have evidence that\nproves that you will because you haven't\ndone it yet\nso in the absence of evidence that you\ncan either that you either can or will\ndo it in order to take action you need\nto have belief beyond the evidence which\nis what faith is\nconfidence is Faith In Yourself\nyou really have no good reason to\nbelieve that you can do it but you're\ngoing to believe anyway\nand you believe it anyway because belief\nmotivates action\nthis is why they say that faith can move\nmountains without faith no action is\npossible and with even a little faith\ngreat Endeavors are accomplished\nand that's because confidence is faith\nin your own ability to overcome\nadversity as it inevitably presents\nitself on your path confidence says I\ndon't know what's going to happen\nbut I have faith that I will be able to\nhandle it if and when it comes up\nI will find a way or I will make a way I\nhave no evidence that I will succeed but\nI have faith in my own ability to rise\nto the occasion\nand that is the mystery of the word\nconfidence it is to act with faith with\nrespect to one's own ability or success\nhopefully that makes sense what do you\nthink please remember to like comment\nand subscribe for the algorithm and see\nthe about to add for more information on\ndonations consultations and sponsorship\nopportunities\nthanks for watching"
