    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the truth\nabout romance romance is for men\nthis title is probably a shock to most\nof you especially to the men out there\nI'm here to argue that all the things\nthat go into modern Romance the flowers\nthe chivalry the bent knee proposals are\nactually not for women\nthey're for men this was a big\nrealization for me and it was even\nbigger because it was actually staring\nme in the face the entire time\nit's so obvious that it's invisible to\npeople\nnow before I get into it please remember\nto like this video And subscribe to the\nchannel it costs you nothing it takes\nless than a second and it's how you can\nsupport me and my mission to deliver\nfree high quality content to the world\nreally thanks for your help\nnow let me help you understand why\nromance is for men in the pinned comment\nbelow there's a link to this really\ncatchy 90s song called Two Princes by\nthe band Spin Doctors I remember when I\nheard this song in the sixth grade for\nthe first time I made my mom drive me to\nthe mall just so that I could buy the\nsingle which I proceeded to listen to\nover and over and over again the song\njust spoke to me the song Hit number one\non the US charts and more important to\nour present undertaking it perfectly\nexemplifies what I'm here to talk about\nif you haven't done so already listen to\nit yourself it's really catchy now the\nlyrics of the song tell the story of an\nage-old romantic Trope two men are vying\nfor the same woman one guy is Rich he's\nestablished he has status as the song\nsays he's got diamonds in his pockets\nbut he apparently doesn't really love\nthe woman on the other hand the guy the\nsinger he's well he's poor he's got no\nfuture he's got nothing to offer but his\nheart but he apparently knows what a\nprince and lover ought to be\nthere is nothing new here this is the\nsame dichotomy you see in almost every\nromantic comedy or Hallmark movie so who\ncares well let me ask you a really\nobvious and stupid question\nwhy is this always the case that is why\nis it always the rich powerful man who\ndoesn't believe in love\nagainst the poor down on his luck dude\nwho does or to put another way why is it\nnever the rich powerful man who believes\nin love\nagainst the poor down on those dude\nwho doesn't\nand it's an easy question because the\nanswer is obvious the reason why it's\nnever the other way around is that it\nwouldn't be a fair fight the woman would\nhave absolutely no reason to choose the\nsecond guy\nso there's really no reason to tell that\nstory there's no conflict because\nthere's no contest the woman of course\nwould choose the rich and powerful man\nwho believes in love do you understand\nso what was the story before romance was\ninvented like how did it work in\nmedieval and ancient times leaving aside\nthe fact that women rarely got to choose\ntheir Partners how many men how were men\nselected for women back then\nwell before romance it was just the rich\npowerful guy against the poor down as\nluck dude\nwhich like my hypothetical counter\nexample also isn't a fair fight\nthe first guy wins every single time and\nin those times not only did the rich and\npowerful men get their pick of the\nchoicest women it wasn't all that\nuncommon for these men to have a whole\nHarem of women I mean according to the\nBible King Solomon had 700 wives\nand 300 concubines that guy had a\nthousand women\nwhich means that at that time in that\nplace there was probably\n999 other guys who were pissed at\nSolomon for bogarting all the best\nladies for himself\nbut can you really blame the women why\nwouldn't they choose Solomon he was the\nking he had the money and the Palaces\nwhich means he could offer resources and\nprotection and he was wise and generous\nto boot the other guys couldn't compete\nnow because romance was actually a\nhistorical phenomenon it originated in\nthe south of France in the 15th century\nwe know who invented it\nmen invented it more specifically the\nchivalric Knights of that time and place\nand these men invented it for them\nfour men not for women and they invented\nromance in an attempt to compete with\nthe rich and powerful men of their time\nfor access to the best women\nand this is because if a guy couldn't\nconvince a woman that he had something\nspecial something intangible that the\nking didn't have there's no way he's\ngetting laid\nthe truth about romance is that it's a\nstrategy that lower status men have\nadopted in their attempt to compete\nsuccessfully with higher status men for\nwomen\nthis is also why romance is a young\nman's game because most young men don't\nhave anything to offer women\nbut they still want to get laid and if\nit works it's a pretty slick game\nbecause I a lower status man would have\nconvinced you an attractive woman\nthat this intangible feeling in my chest\nis actually more valuable and important\nto you than all the resources and\nopportunity that a higher status man\ncould provide for you I would have to be\nextremely smooth for that to work and to\nbe honest it usually doesn't\nwomen might think the second guy the guy\nwho calls himself a prince is rather\nsweet and may even play around with him\nfor a little bit\nbut they generally end up with the first\nguy the guy who might actually be a\nprince\nand who can provide her with the kind of\nlifestyle that she would prefer\nand this is just\nmind-blowing for me because guys\ntypically think that romance is for\nwomen\nI mean they don't want chocolates and\nflowers and poetry and jewelry and they\ngive these things because they think\nwomen do\nbut women still want Solomon guys women\nstill want the king the powerful wise\ngenerous Rich alpha male\nthings haven't changed because women's\nnature like men's nature hasn't really\nchanged in the last few hundred years\nthe upshot is that romance was actually\ninvented by men for men to help them\ncompete with more powerful men who would\notherwise completely destroy them in the\nsexual Marketplace for desirable women\ntake that in\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and see the about tab for more\ninformation on
