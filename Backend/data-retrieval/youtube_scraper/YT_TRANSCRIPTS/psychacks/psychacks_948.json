    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic today short talk is the importance\nof sex in relationships so this is one\nfor the ladies out there both men and\nwomen have a hierarchy of priorities\nwhen it comes to what they're looking\nfor in a relationship and while sex is\nimportant to women\nit's typically not as important as it is\nto men and I'm going to try to explain\nwhy sex is so important to men in this\nvideo and to do that I'm going to use\nthe analogy of professional\nrelationships because\ncounter-intuitively what works in\nbusiness is often what works in\nrelationships but before I offer this\nanalogy please remember to like this\nvideo And subscribe to the channel it\ntakes less than a second costs you\nnothing and it's how you can support me\nin my mission to deliver free high\nquality content to the world thanks for\nyour help with this\nhere we go let's start with professional\nrelationships what distinguishes a\nprofessional relationship from all the\nother relationships on the planet like\nwhat is the one thing without which the\nprofessional relationship does not exist\neven if everything else is present\nthat thing is the receipt of money\na job is your money relationship in the\nvast majority of cases it's the only\nrelationship that people have in which\nthey receive money it's the defining\nfeature of a professional relationship\nwithout which the professional\nrelationship does not exist consequently\nit makes sense to prioritize the\nfinancial elements when considering\nentering into a professional\nrelationship sure you can want to be\npassionate about your work but the truth\nis you can get passion elsewhere\nyou can want your work to be meaningful\nbut you can get meaning elsewhere do you\nunderstand most people are not going to\nget money elsewhere so it makes sense to\nprioritize that in the scheme of needs\nwhen entering into a professional\nrelationship all right now let's\ntransition so what distinguishes a\nromantic relationship from all other\nrelationships on the planet one is the\none thing without which the Romantic\nrelationship does not exist even if\neverything else is present you guessed\nit that thing is sex\na romantic relationship is your sex\nrelationship\nin the vast majority of cases it's the\nonly relationship in which\npeople have sex and in an exclusive\nrelationship it's the only relationship\nwhere people are allowed to have sex\nit's the defining feature of a romantic\nrelationship without which the Romantic\nrelationship does not exist consequently\nit makes sense to prioritize sexual\nelements when considering entering into\na romantic relationship do I find this\nperson attractive do we have chemistry\nhow frequent is the sex what kind of sex\nare we having it's like you can want an\nunderstanding partner\nbut you can get understanding from a\nconfidant you can be\nemotionally supported but you can get\nemotional support from a friend\non the other hand most people are not\ngoing to get sex elsewhere and in a\ncommitted relationship your partner is\nkind of your exclusive sex dealer\nlike the company store at which you have\nto do your shopping so it makes sense to\nprioritize sexual elements in the scheme\nof needs when entering into a romantic\nrelationship now the pushback I\ngenerally get from this position is\nbasically well Orion this just sounds so\nmercenary like all you care about is\nmoney all you care about is sex and\nthat's not actually what I said\nthese aren't the only things to care\nabout\nthey're just the most important things\nto care about in certain contexts I\ndon't care what other reasons you have\nfor going to work if you stopped getting\na paycheck you wouldn't show up on\nMonday\nas passionate and fulfilled and aligned\nwith the mission statement as you were\nyou probably wouldn't work for free\nby the same token if the sex in a\nrelationship dries up it's highly likely\nthat the guy eventually won't be\nreporting for Duty especially if he\nisn't married to you hopefully that\nmakes sense\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations consultations\nand sponsorship opportunities thanks for\nlistening"
