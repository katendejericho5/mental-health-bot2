    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nwhy modern dating doesn't work\nor\nprivilege and responsibility\nso on the whole i think that comedians\ndo a much better job of understanding\nmen and women and sexual dynamics than\ndo the vast majority of academic\npsychologists and one of my favorite\ncomedians on this topic was patrice\no'neill that man was funny as hell and\nhe understood a lot of uncomfortable\ntruths about men and women\npatrice had this line about what men\nwant and the line was\nmen want to be alone\nbut not by themselves\nthat is men want their space they want\ntheir freedom they want their privacy\nand they want women but on the periphery\nof their lives i'm not saying this is\ngood or bad or right or wrong but i do\nthink it's accurate it is what it is\nnow before i unpack what this has to do\nwith modern dating please remember to\nlike this video and subscribe to the\nchannel it takes you less than a second\ncost you nothing and it's how you can\nsupport me and my mission to deliver\nfree high quality content to the world\nso please thanks for your help\nnow what does this have to do with\nmodern dating well to the extent that\nthis is true\nfrom a man's perspective there is a\nsignificant mismatch between the\nprivileges awarded to\nand the responsibilities expected of men\nas a relationship progresses\nand this\ndisincentivizes men from entering into\nrelationships which to the extent that\nrelationships are what women want is bad\nfor women\nwhat does this mean\nin an ideal world\nprivilege and responsibility\nare balanced\nyou want more privileges then you have\nto be willing to assume some\nresponsibilities you want me to take on\nmore responsibility then you have to be\nwilling to give me more privileges do\nyou see\nas workers climb the corporate hierarchy\nthey are expected to work harder make\nmore difficult decisions and assume\ngreater responsibility and\naccountability for the success of the\ncompany\nwhy would anyone want to do this\nbecause corporate officers enjoy\nfabulous compensation packages and other\nintangible perks the privileges are\nincreased to match the responsibilities\nso what does this have to do with dating\nwell\nif what a man wants\nis to have access to women and be left\nalone\nwhen is he most likely\nto enjoy these privileges in the course\nof a relationship\nin the earliest stages of the courtship\nin modern dating men can go on a date\nwith a woman or even multiple women have\nsex and then not see or even communicate\nwith the other person for a week\nor two\nthat's not a bad deal for a lot of men\nunless a guy is chomping at the bit to\nget married or start a family men in\nthis stage of the relationship get a lot\nof what they want they get high quality\ninteractions characterized by novelty\nexcitement and sex followed by periods\nof separation at this point men enjoy\ntheir freedom and autonomy and they get\nwhat patrice says they want to be alone\nbut not by themselves\nand what happens from there in the\nconventional progression of the\nrelationship\nwell a man comes to take on more and\nmore responsibilities and enjoys fewer\nand fewer privileges for his trouble\ni've personally been in relationships as\na responsible committed adult where i\nhad fewer freedoms and privileges than i\nenjoyed as an irresponsible selfish\nteenager\nsex dwindles expenses increase friends\nand interests are sacrificed freedom and\nautonomy vanish\nand vibrant mustangs become the plow\nhorses of women and children\nnow the men who allow this to happen are\nresponsible for their fate so i'm not\nblaming women here\nmy point is that this is how we as a\nsociety\nbelieve a relationship should go\nand that this is a raw deal for a lot of\nguys\nas a professional analogy\nthe relationship progression for men is\nakin to starting off in a private corner\noffice\nthese folks don't need to clock in they\ncan come and go as they please to\nsupplement their income\nthey might have some side hustles or\npersonal investments and this isn't a\nproblem for the higher-ups as long as it\ndoesn't cause them any trouble\nthese men can decide their own course\nthey can choose to work on certain\nprojects and veto others with immunity\nand they have fantastic benefits\nunlimited pto and lots of industry\nschmoozing\nnow imagine that a promotion at this\ncompany entails moving the man out of\nhis corner office into a public cubicle\non the floor\nhe's now expected to account for his\nwhereabouts at all times and to ask for\npermission to come in late or leave\nearly the man is also expected to sign a\nnon-competition clause and to divest\nhimself of all personal income streams\nfurthermore he's expected to build\nconsensus for his decisions and to\nsubmit to the direction of an or to\nsubmit to the direction of another\nfinally he is expected to be at the\noffice twice as much to forego the perks\nof his status and reputation and only\nvacation on company sponsored retreats\noh and they cut his salary in half\ndoes this sound like a promotion to you\nit doesn't to me\nand it doesn't to a lot of the guys who\nhave opened their eyes to the situation\nso what's the upshot modern dating\ndoesn't work because men are\ndisincentivized to progress\nrelationships with women\nthey're expected to do way more for much\nless\nand because of this lack of incentive\nrelationships are not progressed\nrationally\nbut emotionally\nwhich works until it doesn't and the\nfallout of which affects men and women\nand children if present\nthe fact of the matter is that men would\nenter into relationships\nenthusiastically\nif they believed they got more of what\nthey wanted as a consequence of entering\ninto them\nthe privileges have to match the\nresponsibilities\nwhat do you think\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm\nand see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations consultations\nand sponsorship opportunities\nthanks for listening"
