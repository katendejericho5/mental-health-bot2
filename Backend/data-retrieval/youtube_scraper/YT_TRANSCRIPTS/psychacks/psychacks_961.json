    "transcript": "so once again the internet is all a\ntwitter on the subject of male sexual\npreference this most recent\ncontroversy was sparked by the Andrew\nTate Piers Morgan interview that came\nout a few days ago I actually don't know\nwho either one of those guys is I'm not\nvery up on popular culture but I do like\nto make episodes that are relevant to\nthe time so that people enjoy them the\nfact of the matter is it's been very\nsolidly demonstrated empirically that\nmen have a preference for younger women\nand that women have a preference for\nolder men this is usually explained in\nterms of evolutionary psychology that\nyouth and Beauty are an indirect metric\nof reproductive capacity I.E fertility\nand so that men are kind of biologically\nprogrammed to seek after younger women\nbut there's another really important\nreason why this occurs please see my\nrecent episode why men like younger\nwomen for the answer staring Us in the\nface the whole time but nobody talks\nabout it"
