    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why men\nlike younger women\nso in some respects the answer to this\nquestion is fairly obvious men are\nprimarily visual creatures so they sort\nfor good Optics and Beauty from the\nperspective of evolutionary psychology\nis a indicator of reproductive capacity\nthat is it generally correlates with\nyouth infertility so to the extent that\nmen have a biological imperative to\nreproduce successfully it makes sense\nthat men would be attracted to younger\nwomen you don't need to listen to this\nepisode to know that you already know\nthat today I'm going to discuss another\npowerful and often neglected reason why\nthis is true but before I do please\nremember to like this video And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\nhow you can support me and my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld so thank you for your help\nso there's another really important\nreason why men like younger women it's\nstaring us all in the face but it almost\nnever gets said here it is\nthe reason why men like younger women\nis that women like\nolder men\nif women did not like older men it would\nactually be very very difficult for men\nto like younger women I suppose they\nstill could like them but it would just\nbe a recipe for frustration a kind of\ntorture and we actually don't see that\nin reality\nI don't believe that there is a culture\non this planet where the average age of\na woman exceeds the average age of a man\nfor a first marriage so in all places in\nevery culture around the world\nthroughout history women select older\nmen to partner with and why might that\nbe well what are some of women's\nselection criteria for partners\nthey'd like someone who is confident and\ncompetent who has wealth who has status\nwho has an emotionally compelling\nlifestyle who knows how to communicate\nwho is emotionally stable and who is\ngenerally an all-around successful guy\nokay so who is more likely to have all\nof those things a 25 year old man or a\n45 year old man obviously the 45 year\nold man is going to have significantly\nhigher levels of all of those things the\n25 year old might be fun and sexy but\nthose aren't the primary criteria upon\nwhich women sort for their Partners okay\nso the flip side of this is the\nunderstanding that a successful 45 year\nold man is sort of analogous to a fairly\nattractive 25 year old woman\nmost men will never even begin to\napproach the optionality enjoyed by a\nbeautiful 25 year old woman but if they\nplay their cards right they might get\nthe kind of optionality enjoyed by a\nfairly attractive 25 year old woman\nand it makes sense that when he's at his\nPeak when he has the greatest\noptionality he will ever have he will\nmove toward the women that all of the\nthings being equal he's most attracted\nto\nbecause that's what the attractive 25\nyear old women are doing they're at\ntheir Peak and they're moving toward the\nmen that all of the things being equal\nthey're most attracted to\nin our culture when we see a big age Gap\nin a romantic relationship we tend to\nthink that it's a skeezy old guy who has\nsomehow manipulated an innocent young\nwoman into a relationship\nbut it would probably be just as true to\nsay that it's a skevial little girl who\nis creeping on some established\nsuccessful man\nit's the other side of the same coin so\nwe either need to think of this as\ncreepy in both directions or even better\nstop being so judgmental\nseeing what people go after when they\nhave the most options is our truest\nglimpse into what they really want\nit is what it is\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations consultations\nand sponsorship opportunities\nthanks for listening"
