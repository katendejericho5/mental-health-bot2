    "transcript": "in why men don't go to therapy\nAustralian girl asked what advice would\nyou give for women trying to resolve\nrelationship problems with men this is\nan excellent question and I would\ncounsel you to take under consideration\nthe fact that men and women typically\nhave different styles when it comes to\nsolving problems in their relationships\nwomen tend to want to talk and when they\nhave an issue they want to sit down and\nthey want to they want to actually\ncommunicate about it and you know\nthere's some a lot of good you can say\nabout that approach men have a different\nkind of attitude towards this often they\nwant to withdraw and they want to\nprocess their emotions themselves and\nproblem solve before they come to you to\ncommunicate it's not that the\ncommunication doesn't happen it's just\nthat men tend to want to do their\nemotional processing by themselves\nwhereas women want to do it together and\nif you understand this about men you\nwon't push to have conversations before\ntheir"
