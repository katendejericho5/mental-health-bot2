    "transcript": "in my recent short doesn't this also\napply to friendships aligned asks\nbasically how do you navigate one person\nwanting a legal marriage and the other\nwanting a life partner status and it\nseemed like\nyou aligned were the uh one wanting a\nlegal marriage because you believed that\nthe life partner status was too vague\nand open\num you also talked about raising your\nchildren together from pre-existing\nmarriages so i'm just going to be kind\nof real with you\npersonally i would not marry somebody\nwho was divorced\nbecause on some level that person has\ndemonstrated that they were unwilling or\nunable to abide by the lifelong\ncommitment that they made to another\nperson for whatever reason\nso bulking at the commitment a lower\ncommitment when\nyou already were unable to reach a\nhigher commitment seems a little\ndisingenuous"
