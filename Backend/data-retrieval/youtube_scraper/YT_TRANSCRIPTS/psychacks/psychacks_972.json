    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nmasculinity and femininity\nthese are words that demand a definition\nit's not very empirical but the way i\nlook at masculinity in femininity is\nthat these are attributes of the soul\nand that they are related to but not\ncoincident with biological sex that is\nmaleness and femaleness\nin fact both men and women males and\nfemales have masculine and feminine\nenergies but before i really get into it\nplease remember to like this video and\nsubscribe to this channel takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\nhow you can support me in my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld so thank you for your help\nnow what are the essential\ncharacteristics of these two energies\nwell in line with several ancient social\nand spiritual traditions we can describe\nmasculinity as penetrating dominating\ncreative eros which is a type of love\nand femininity as yielding submitting\nreceptive agape which is a different\nkind of love\none is not better than the other though\nthey are different from each other and\nthe men and women have both of each\ninterestingly these two are not\nopposites the opposite of masculinity is\nnot femininity and the opposite of\nfemininity is not masculinity if they\nwere they couldn't really exist in the\nsame person at the same time\nthey are more compliments than opposites\nand research indicates that these\nattributes are orthogonal which means\nthat it's possible for someone to be\nhigh in both attributes like for example\nmick jagger\nand for someone to be low in both\nattributes like pat in the old saturday\nnight live sketch\nthese would be examples of androgyny\nnow\nall men have both masculine and feminine\nattributes and all women have both\nmasculine and feminine attributes so we\nknow that they are not completely\ncoincident with biological sex\nhowever we do know that they are\ncorrelated\non the whole the average man is more\nmasculine than the average woman\nand the average woman is more feminine\nthan the average man\nfurthermore the most masculine men are\nall more masculine than the most\nmasculine women and the most feminine\nwomen are all more feminine than most\nfeminine men\nand this is true across culture and\nhistory so it doesn't really seem\nplausible to assert that they can be\ncompletely independent of biological sex\neither\nlike many things that have to do with\npeople who are extremely complex\nit's probably for the best not to reduce\nthem too much in either direction\nas i discussed in my series on the\nconcept of the game\ntoo much structure and rigidity leads to\ntotalitarian control\nand too little leads to chaotic\ndissolution\nlife happens in the middle ground\nhopefully that makes sense\ndid you remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and please\nsee the about tab for more information\non donations consultations and\nsponsorship opportunities thank you for\nyour help"
