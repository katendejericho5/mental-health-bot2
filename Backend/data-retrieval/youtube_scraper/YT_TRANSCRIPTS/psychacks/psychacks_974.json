    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychx\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is you can't\nnot communicate\nthis is one of the fundamental truths of\nhuman existence every action and many\ninactions\nsomething with respect to the internal\nstate of the actor at the moment of\naction\nit's unavoidable you can't not\ncommunicate\nand before i really get into this please\nremember to like this video and\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\nhow you can support me in my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld so thank you for your help with\nthis\nno matter what we do\nwe are communicating something whether\nwe are conscious of it or not\nin my acting conservatory we played a\ngame in which one player would stand\noutside the room and knock on the door\nwith a certain intention\nand the other player would stay inside\nthe room and try to guess the intention\nbehind the knock\nthat was a playful knock\nthat was a terrified knock\nthat was a defeated knock\nif even a knock\ncan convey the internal state of the\nactor then imagine the wealth of\ninformation that your posture and\ngestures and semantics and tone and\nclothing and expression and movement and\nattention and status can express\nnow just because every action\ncommunicates something with respect to\nthe internal state of the actor it\ndoesn't necessarily follow that whoever\nis observing that action can\nconsistently and accurately identify\nthat state there's always some noise in\nthe transfer information from actor to\nobserver by the same token it can also\nhappen that an observer can correctly\nidentify the internal state of an actor\nof which the actor himself is not even\nconscious\ntherefore\nit follows that neither the actor nor\nthe observer is the absolute arbiter of\nthe communication which requires both\npositions to exist at all\nthere's an interesting example from\nhistory that nicely illustrates these\nprinciples it comes from world war ii\nwhen allied intelligence was\nintercepting morse code transmissions\nfrom nazi agents\nmorse code as you know is an electric\nlanguage in which words are spelled out\nthrough combinations of dots and dashes\nwhich are created when an operator\neither presses or holds a button\nit's a very mechanical process\nhowever the allies who were\neavesdropping on these nazi agents over\ntime came to recognize very small\nidiosyncratic differences in the way\nthat dots and dashes were created\nand they came to associate those\ndifferences with individual operators\nthey called these subtle variations in\nthe creation of the dots and dashes of\nmorse code\nfist\nand through this recognition they could\ntrack the movements of individual nazi\nagents across europe and this in turn\ngave the allies some insight into the\nmaneuvers of the axis powers\nthese agents could not help but impart\nsomething of their personality into\nsomething as mechanical and impersonal\nas pressing a button\nand they themselves were completely\nunaware of their tendency to do so\ninteresting huh\nso what's the upshot\nyou can't not communicate\nevery action even the smallest behavior\nin some measure bears the likeness of\nthe internal state of the actor\nand it's not necessary for the actor to\nbe aware of his internal state for this\ntransmission to occur\nwhat do you think\ndid you remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm\nand please see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations consultations\nand sponsorship opportunities\nthanks for listening"
