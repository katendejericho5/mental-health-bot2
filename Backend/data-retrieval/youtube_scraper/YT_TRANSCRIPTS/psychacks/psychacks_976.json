    "transcript": "i'm dr o'ryan taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nnot everyone can be saved\nso this is an uncomfortable topic\nit's one that we would collectively\nprefer not to hear but i would be lying\nto you if i suggested in any way that it\nwas not true\nbut before i explain why please remember\nto like this video and subscribe to this\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it's how you can\nsupport me in my mission to deliver free\nhigh quality content to the world\nthanks for your help\nnow\nwe don't have the belief that everyone\ncan be saved in the medical sciences\nlike we do in clinical psychology\nif a patient comes into an emergency\nroom after a terrible car accident and\nhis body has been pulverized and he's\nbleeding internally in a hundred\ndifferent locations and his brain is\nswelling out of his skull\nonly a grossly incompetent or an\narrogantly deluded doctor could examine\nthis person and say yes i can put this\nperson back together\njust as good as he was before the\naccident\nwe all understand that the human body\nthe physical structure the stuff of\nwhich were made has certain physical\nlimits and that once we exceed those\nlimits the body cannot be healed\nsometimes not completely sometimes not\nat all\nwhen a person does recover from a\nphysical injury\nthe scar tissue doesn't have the same\nsuppleness and sensitivity as the\noriginal flesh did\nand that's something that will never\nchange\nand we generally do a good job of\naccepting that fact\nhowever for whatever reason we\nculturally have this idea that no matter\nwhat a person suffers emotionally or\nspiritually\nthat he or she can be restored to their\nprevious level of functioning and\nwholeness and well-being\nnot only can these wounds always be\nhealed but always be healed completely\nbut they can be healed completely\nwithout scar tissue\nand that if some rigidity or\ninsensitivity persists well\nthat's just a failure of the therapy or\nthe patient which could be addressed\nwith more or different therapy\nand unfortunately i'm here to tell you\nthat that's not true\npeople are subject to passing through\nexperiences sometimes it's a single\ntraumatic experience sometimes it's a\nseries of traumatizing experiences\nthat more or less leave them\npermanently disabled at least in part\nfrom a psychic or an emotional\nperspective\neven more frequently when people heal\nfrom the bleeding injury and an\nemotional scar forms\nthey don't return to the same degree of\nsensitivity and openness that they\npreviously enjoyed in fact\nthat's what healing might look like\nfor some folks\nand more or different therapy won't make\na difference\non some level we all need to grieve the\nloss\nof that which doesn't return in our\nhealing however this is not the end of\nthe story\ndespite our losses we can focus on those\nresources and faculties that we do still\npossess and that may yet still allow us\nto move forward in the direction of our\ngoals\nhumans possess an indomitable spirit and\nthis indomitability can more than make\nup for whatever was lost in the course\nof a lifetime in most cases\nthere's enough left over for us to make\na good show of it moving forward\nwhat do you think\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and see the\nabout tab for more information on\ndonations consultations and sponsorship\nopportunities\nthanks for listening"
