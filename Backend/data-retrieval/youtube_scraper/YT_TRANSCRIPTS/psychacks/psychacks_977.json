    "transcript": "on my episode ladies find your Dark\nHorse Shania simsil comments bad advice\nevery man has potential but not every\nman reaches his potential well you're\nhalf right\num you're wrong about it being bad\nadvice but you are right about the fact\nthat every man has potential my dad used\nto tell me that potential is like sand\nit's extremely common element and that\nyou shouldn't make decisions about\nentering into long-term relationships or\nmarriage based on the perception of\nanother person's potential absolutely\nbecause in the vast majority of cases\nthat potential goes unrealized however\nwhat I did say in the video is that it's\nnot enough to have potential a dark\nhorse has a plan and is actively working\nto achieve that plan so it's not just\nsomebody who has a dream it's somebody\nwho has the skills and the effort and\nthe will to put it into practice so if\nyou're gonna make a comment you actually\nhave to watch the entire video that\nyou're commenting on okay"
