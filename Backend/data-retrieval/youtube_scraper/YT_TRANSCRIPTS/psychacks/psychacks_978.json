    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the\nbalance of creation and destruction\nso this talk will be somewhat similar to\nmy episode on the balance of pain and\npleasure because similar to those other\nconcepts there's not really a balance\nbetween creation and destruction at all\nin fact there is a dramatic and\nirreducible asymmetry between the two\nand before i explain what i mean by that\nplease remember to like this video and\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\nhow you can support me in my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld thanks for your help\nthe asymmetry between creation and\ndestruction is something that we all\nunderstand something that has taken\nyears decades or even centuries to\ncreate through effort and diligence\nperseverance and talent can be destroyed\nin seconds with sufficient malice and\npower\nthis is why impatience is always\ndestructive you can't create much of\nanything in the span of time it takes to\ndestroy\nnow destruction is clearly necessary in\nthe scheme of things\nin its most useful aspect destruction is\nlike a forest fire that can purify a\nland of stagnant growth and provide the\nfundamental nourishment for that which\nwe'll come after\na world without destruction would\nquickly become choked with the sheer\nmass of stuff which paradoxically would\nmake creativity destructive by\nsuffocating space and exhausting\nopportunity\nthat said it's just incomparably more\ndifficult and time-consuming and\nrequires substantially more effort and\ntalent to be creative\nespecially if you strive to create\nsomething enduring and worthwhile\nnsa symmetry is very easily observed in\nsocial media\nas the producer of my own little podcast\ni\ncan attest to the fact that it takes a\ngreat deal of effort and some degree of\ncourage to stand out from the crowd\nto use your real name and face and say\nthis is what i believe and while on the\nwhole the response to the channel has\nbeen extremely positive\ni think it's no coincidence that those\nwho seem to disagree most forcefully\nwith my positions\nhide behind anonymity\nthey use pseudonymous screen names they\ndon't show their real faces and\nlikenesses\nand as far as i know none of them have\nchannels of their own\nwhich would offer a more compelling\nresponse to my ideas than a dashed off\ncomment\nhowever that would require\nof course time\nenergy\neffort to create and potentially expose\nthem to the impatient destructiveness of\nothers\nall of which suggest that whatever the\ndetractors believe they believe to a\npoint\nnamely to the point\nthat courage and effort would be\nrequired to substantiate their beliefs\nin reality\nthat said should any of them decide to\ncreate such an alternative then we might\nbe able to have a dialogue on more equal\nfooting consider it a friendly challenge\nwhat do you think\ndid you remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and please\nsee the about tab for more information\non donations consultations and\nsponsorship opportunities\nthanks for watching"
