    "transcript": "in my episode how to improve your luck\naustralian girl comments it feels so\nstrange to dress up and put on a show to\nattract the opposite sex i've always\nfelt like it's the opposite of\nauthenticity\ni can understand how you feel that way i\nthink this is something that all people\nmore or less have to come to terms with\nthe way that i would ask you to consider\nto think about going out on a first date\nis similar to how you go about preparing\nfor a first job interview\ni assume that you put on a\na good business outfit and that you've\nlooked over your resume and that\npotentially you've practiced responses\nto certain questions and\nit's not so much that you are\nlying about who you are\nthough i guess some people do in order\nto get um jobs\nit's about presenting yourself in the\nmost desirable and attractive light in\norder to get what you want\nand um that's not necessarily\ninauthentic hopefully that makes sense"
