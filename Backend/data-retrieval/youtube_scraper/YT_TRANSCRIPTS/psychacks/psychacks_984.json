    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow to hunt for a partner\nin a previous video i described how\nthere are really only two approaches to\nfinding a partner you can hunt or you\ncan fish one is not necessarily better\nthan the other however each one involves\na different skill set that is useful at\ndifferent times and in different\nsituations so it's good to understand\nhow they diverge today i'm going to be\ntalking about hunting\nhowever before i do\nplease remember to like this video and\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\nhow you can support me in my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld\nthanks for your help\nso what is hunting\nhunting is when you target a very\nspecific individual for your romantic\nintentions you've made your decision\neven before the approach and go directly\nafter that target\nthe idea here is that you go after what\nyou want\nand then hope that the other also wants\nyou in return and this is why hunting is\ninherently a gamble you never really\nknow if the other will be sufficiently\ninterested in you to make something\nhappen\nand that's why i said that in general\nhunting is a more effective strategy the\nhigher your value in the sexual\nmarketplace why\nbecause\nstatistically speaking you will have a\nbetter chance of the other person\nwanting you in return if you can clearly\nindicate that you possess the traits\nthat are typically selected for by the\nsex to whom you're attracted\nas an obvious example a very physically\nattractive woman is going to have better\nluck hunting men with a cold approach\nthan a woman who is not as physically\nattractive because on the whole\nphysical attractiveness plays a huge\nfactor in women's sexual marketplace\nvalue to straight men\nhowever if you want to be a successful\nhunter you can't just be generally\nattractive to the sex to whom you are\nattracted\nwhy\nbecause you're not targeting the entire\nsex you're targeting one specific\nindividual and that specific individual\nis going to have specific needs\ninterests and desires\nneeds interests and desires that may\neven radically diverge from the\nconventional expectation\nso if you are targeting one specific\nindividual\nyou need to do your research\nthe way to successfully hunt is to\npresent yourself as either\na\nthe incarnation of the other's desires\nor be\nthe solution to the other's problems\nand to do this well you will need some\ninformation\nwhat does she like\nwhat are his goals in life\nwhere is she in pain\nwhat can he not do on his own\nwhen you answer these questions you can\nbegin to cultivate in yourself a\npresentation that effectively\ncommunicates that you are what the other\nperson is looking for\nkeep in mind that these questions are\nbest answered through observation\nthan through direct inquiry and that\neffective communication is often subtle\nand indirect rather than blunt and\nobvious\nthink of hunting like targeted marketing\nthe more you can tailor your\npresentation to your potential customer\nthe more likely you're going to get a\nsale\nhowever to do this\nyou need both relevant information\non your target\nand\na willingness to be flexible in your\napproach\nsome people are going to hear this and\nthey're going to think\ni am what i am take me or leave me i'm\nnot going to change myself to try to get\nsomebody else and to that i say\nthat's fine\nbut that's not targeted marketing\nhunting is not really something that you\ncan do casually it takes effort and\npreparation however if you put in the\nwork you'll get better results\nthat's it for today did you remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and please see the about tab\nfor more information on donations and\nconsultations thanks for listening"
