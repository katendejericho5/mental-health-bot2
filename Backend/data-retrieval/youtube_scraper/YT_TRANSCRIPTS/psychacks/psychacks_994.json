    "transcript": "i'm dr o'ryan taraban and this is\npsychax better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nall mental illnesses are compromises\nso what does that mean\nwell before i offer an explanation\nplease remember to like this video and\nsubscribe to this channel\nit takes less than a second it costs you\nnothing and it's how you can support me\nin my mission to deliver high quality\ncontent to the world\nthanks for your help\nwhat it means is that as people move\nthrough life they are subject to\nexperiencing great pain suffering and\ntrauma\nand when they come into contact with\npain suffering and trauma there is a\nhealthy tendency to avoid that which is\ncausing the problem\nthe issue is that the problem the pain\nsuffering and\ntrauma\nexist in reality\nand by avoiding the problem they're\navoiding reality\nnow if they avoid reality too much they\nwill create other forms of pain\nsuffering and trauma\nbecause they will be acting in a way\nthat's not grounded in reality\nas\nein rand said you can avoid reality but\nyou can't avoid the consequences of\navoiding reality\nso all mental illnesses constitute a\ncompromised solution\nthey seek to avoid the pain that exists\nin reality as much as possible\nwhile actually avoiding reality itself\nas little as possible\nand the degree to which folks will be\nsuccessful in their compromises depends\non a host of factors including their\ntemperament their intelligence their\nsocial context and their overarching\nculture pretty interesting huh\nwhen folks are fairly successful in\ntheir compromise solutions we call them\nneurotic\nthis means that they've distorted\nreality somewhat to avoid coming into\ncontact with the pain that exists there\nbut that their reality testing is still\nlargely intact\nneurotics suffer from a mitigated pain\nof reality in addition to the pain\ncreated by their reality distortions but\nthe sum of both is considered to be less\nthan the unmitigated pain of reality\non the other hand when folks\nsignificantly distort distort reality to\navoid coming into contact with the pain\nthat exists there we call them psychotic\ntheir reality testing is no longer\nintact and their beliefs and behavior\ncan be very bizarre\npsychotics often no longer suffer from\nthe pain of reality but they can suffer\na great deal from the pain created by\ntheir reality distortions\nthat said the pain created by their\nreality distortions is still considered\nto be less than the unmitigated pain of\nreality so this does represent a\nsolution of sorts\nthe various factors i mentioned before\ntemperament intelligence context culture\nwill flavor the compromise in specific\nways for instance one person will\ncompromise in a way that we describe as\nocd\nand another will compromise in a way\nthat we describe as schizophrenic and\nyet another will compromise in a way\nthat we describe as body dysmorphic\nthese are all just fancy scientific\nsounding terms for the flavors of\ncompromise\na compromise that seeks to avoid the\npain that exists in reality as much as\npossible while actually avoiding reality\nitself as little as possible\nhopefully that makes sense what do you\nthink did you remember to like comment\nand subscribe for the algorithm and\nplease see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations and\nconsultations\nthanks for listening"
