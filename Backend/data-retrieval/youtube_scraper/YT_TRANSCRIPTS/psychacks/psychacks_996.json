    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is cycax\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the best\nslave\nis still a slave\nthis is a realization that i had back\nwhen i was an actor many years ago i was\nplaying the role of moses in a play\nabout the exodus as you probably know\nmoses and the jewish people were being\nheld in bondage by the egyptians and the\nexodus story is the story of their\nliberation\nbut before i get to my realization\nplease remember to like this video and\nsubscribe to the channel\nit takes less than a second costs you\nnothing and it's how you can support me\nin my mission to deliver free high\nquality content to the world thanks for\nyour help\nwhat i realized over the course of the\nshow was that my competitiveness was a\ntrap\nwhen i was in this role even though i\nwas portraying somebody who was enslaved\nto an exploitative master\nthe competitive instinct in me wanted to\nbe better than all the other slaves to\nbe the best slave possible\nand this is something of a paradox it's\nlike i understand the desire to be the\nbest possible version of yourself\nwhoever you are but to be the best\npossible slave\nwell who is really benefiting from that\nand in that moment i realized that my\ncompetitiveness and my ambition could be\na trap\nuntil i became my own master\nmy creativity and productivity would\nprimarily go toward the enrichment of\nsomebody else\nand this is something that those with\ncompetitive streaks need to come to\nterms with\ncompetitiveness and drive if not applied\ncorrectly\nif not applied in the service of your\ngoals and values is a trap\nwinning this game typically means losing\nthe metagame\nas it will deplete your resources\nneedlessly as you expend your life\nenergy in the service of someone else's\ngoals\nthat said your ambition will privately\nreward you with a badge of honor for\nworking so tirelessly and for achieving\nso highly in your craft as a slave\nand this satisfaction can blind you to\nthe fact that you are spending your life\nin the service of someone else's goals\nand this is because at the end of the\nday the best slave is still a slave\nsomething to consider\nwhat do you think did you remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and please see the about tab\nfor more information on donations and\nconsultations\nthanks for listening"
