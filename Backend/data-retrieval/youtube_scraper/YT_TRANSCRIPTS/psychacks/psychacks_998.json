    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraband and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is a\nbad business blames its customers so\nthis is true literally and as we'll see\nit's also true figuratively when applied\nin the context of romantic relationships\nso\nif a company has a bad quarter if its\nprofits are down if its earnings are\ndismal if it's shares or tanking\nthe higher ups are going to get together\nfor a strategy meeting\ndo you think they're going to\ncollectively blame their idiot customers\nfor their problems like can you imagine\nwell\nthe real problem is that too many people\nare just too stupid to see what a\nfantastic product we offer they're even\ndeluded enough to believe that our\ncompetitors who are clearly inferior to\nus in\nseveral important ways offer a better\nsolution for their needs it's just an\nunfortunate reality that no one\nappreciates a good product anymore\ncome on\nit's a bad business that blames its\ncustomers\nshaming or blaming people for choosing\nnot to part with their hard-earned money\nto purchase your product or service is\narrogant and misguided\nwhy\nbecause the fact of the matter is\nthat most people are happy to part with\ntheir money\nprovided they believe it represents the\nbest value\nfor a solution to a personally relevant\nproblem\nand if they're not handing over their\nmoney with a smile on their face it\nmeans that the company isn't doing that\nand that means there is either a problem\nwith marketing like with the\npresentation of the solution or with the\nsolution itself\nor both\na good company that isn't yet\nexperiencing the success that it would\nprefer to enjoy fiddles with those knobs\nit takes an objective look at how it's\nbeing presented and received in the\nmarketplace maybe they do have a great\nproduct but no one knows about it so\nit's an awareness issue or maybe people\nget the wrong idea of the product from\nthe promotional materials so it's a\nbranding issue\non the other hand maybe they have\nexcellent marketing but their product\nisn't very good so they don't get repeat\nbusiness or it's being sold at the wrong\nprice point the idea is to locate the\nproblem in oneself and not in external\nfactors\nnow\nwe can very easily generalize this\nperspective to dating and relationships\ni've talked to a lot of folks who tell\nme that they can't find a good man\nbecause they're all narcissistic and\navoidant and afraid of commitment or\nthat they can't find a good woman\nbecause they're all and feminist\nand capable of pair bonding\nand i'm here to tell you guys\nthat it's a bad business that blames its\ncustomers\nif you are not yet experiencing the\nsuccess that you would prefer to enjoy\nin the dating market\nthen you have a problem with your\nmarketing a problem with your product or\nboth\npeople are always looking for sex\nconnection and relationship\nthat will never change ever\nthe opportunity to obtain those things\nis all around you\nespecially if you live in a major\nmetropolitan area so if you're having\ntrouble you need to locate the issue in\nyourself\nand not in external factors\nmaybe you're giving off the wrong vibe\nand you need to invest in your look or\nyour appearance\nor maybe you need to do some work on\nyourself in order to increase your value\nrelative to your competition in the\nsexual marketplace because\nit's a shark tank out there guys\nlocate the issue in yourself\nbecause if you do\nyou'll be able to do something about it\nit's hard to take the long hard look at\nthe person in the mirror but if it helps\nyou get what you want it's ultimately\nworth it\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm seriously it helps and see the\nabout tab for more information on\ndonations and consultations\nthanks for listening"
