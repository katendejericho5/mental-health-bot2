    "transcript": "in the truth about commitment janine\ngeorgette asks doesn't this also apply\nto friendships well it does to a certain\ndegree it's certainly the case that\nfriends can take increasingly divergent\npaths in life which causes the\nrelationship to slowly degrade over time\nor people can suffer perceived or actual\nbetrayals at the hands of their friends\nwhich lead to an abrupt end to that\nrelationship\nso\nfriends don't always exist forever but\nthe kind of commitment i'm speaking\nabout in this video on romantic\nrelationships a little bit different if\na friend came to you and said look\ni really want to get all of our friends\nand family together in one place and\neven hire a priest to attest to god and\nto the moon that you are my best friend\nand nothing will ever come between us\ntill death do us part and i want to sign\na legal contract to attest to the fact\nthat you are my best friend\nit would probably seem a little\noff-putting wouldn't it it's like we\ndon't expect that from our friends\nwhich is a good thing"
