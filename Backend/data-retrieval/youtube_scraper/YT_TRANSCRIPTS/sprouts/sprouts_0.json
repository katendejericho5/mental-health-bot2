    "video_title": "The Dark Side of Science: The Sad Story of Dr. Semmelweis",
    "transcript": "In the heart of 19th-century Vienna, \na young physician made a simple yet  \ngroundbreaking discovery that would \nforever change the course of medicine,  \nsave the lives of countless \nwomen, and ruin his own.\nDr. Ignaz Semmelweis was born, in Hungary, \nin 1818. He grew up in a modest family but  \ndisplayed an early aptitude for academics. \nAfter school, he pursued a medical education.\nThe young doctor began his career working \nin the maternity clinic at Vienna General  \nHospital. This is when he noticed a distressing \npattern: women who gave birth in the clinic,  \nwhere doctors were in charge, had an \nextremely high mortality rate—due to  \nchildbed fever. New mothers in the wards \nmanaged by midwives were just fine.\nThis puzzled Semmelweis, who was deeply \nworried about the women and their babies.  \nAnd so he became determined to uncover \nthe root cause of the tragedy. Scientific  \nstudy and meticulous research eventually \nled him to a groundbreaking discovery.\nHe noted that some doctors transitioned directly \nfrom performing autopsies to delivering babies  \nand hypothesized that they were transmitting \ndangerous pathogens that infected the new mothers.\nTo address this issue, Semmelweis introduced \na simple yet revolutionary medical practice:  \nhandwashing with a chlorine solution before \ndoctors attended to women in labor. This single  \nmeasure led to a significant reduction in maternal \nmortality rates in the physician-attended clinic.\nDespite these impressive results, Semmelweis \nfaced resistance from most of his colleagues—they  \nsimply didn’t want to wash their hands. \nThe medical establishment of his time was  \nskeptical of his ideas, as the germ theory \nof disease was not yet widely accepted.\nThe rejection and the tragedy that unfolded \nright in front of his eyes took a toll on  \nSemmelweis’s mental health—he started \nto experience depression and anxiety.\nIn 1865, at the age of 47, he was committed \nto a psychiatric institution in Vienna.  \nHe died there just two weeks later, \nreportedly due to a severe infection,  \nbut most likely because he was badly beaten \nby the guards—though this was never proven.\nSemmelweis’s story highlights the challenges faced \nby pioneers in medicine. His work would eventually  \nbecome standard practice in healthcare, saving \ncountless lives, but the tragic circumstances  \nof his life and death underscore the difficulties \nfaced by those who challenge established beliefs.\n“Science advances one funeral at a time,” \nthe German physicist Max Planck said. Or  \nmore precisely: “A new scientific truth does \nnot triumph by convincing its opponents and  \nmaking them see the light, but rather \nbecause its opponents eventually die,  \nand a new generation grows \nup that is familiar with it.”\nWhat do you think about Semmelweis’s story \nand its broader implications for innovation  \nin science and medicine? And do we, \nas Planck said, really only advance  \none generation at a time?
