    "transcript": "active learning means you participate\ncollaborate with others and apply\nconcepts to the real world\nit requires hard mental effort but leads\nto better retention\nand an understanding of the material\nthat can be transferred to other\nsituations\nto understand why active learning works\nso well it helps to know\nthat when our brain decides what to\nremember it asks itself\ntwo fundamental questions can i\nunderstand\nand do i need to know\nwhen you ask can i understand your brain\nalways puts the new information on the\nfoundation of existing knowledge\nif the foundation is missing the brain\nhas no idea what to do with it\nand as a result it throws it away\nin other words your brain needs to build\nfoundational neuron connections for new\ninformation to attach to\nwhich is both why active learning is\nmore mental work but also essential for\nlearning\nwhen we ask ourselves do i need to know\nour brain\nseparates between the material it finds\nworth to remember\nand the one it can forget if it's\nunlikely that new information will ever\nbe used again\nthe brain is smart enough to throw it\naway if your brain finds that the\ninformation is needed again\nsay it could increase your social status\nthe brain will store it\nin long-term memory to stay there and be\neasily recalled\nyou just have to periodically use or\nthink of it\nto understand how active learning is\napplied in classrooms\nlet's look at the teachings of professor\ncarl wyman\na nobel prize winning physicist and a\nleading proponent of the method\nthere are four steps to it\nstep one prior to class the students\nread up on the fundamentals of a lesson\nso they get an idea of the terms and\nbasic phenomena\nin class professor wyman starts with a\nbrief introduction\nand then gives questions to solve he\nwill have students use clickers\na little device on which students can\nanswer multiple choice questions\nalternatively or for more complex\nproblems worksheets can be handed out\nstep 2 wyman projects a problem and\nasks all the students to select one of\nthree possible answers using their\nclicker\nthis has two benefits first the teacher\ngets an idea of how many of his students\nalready understand the topic\nand second the students are now focused\non the question\nthey want to know if they are right it\nis important though that the question is\nboth challenging and interesting\nall this takes less than five minutes\nstep three without telling the students\nhow they voted\nand following eric mouser's peer\ninstruction method which involves\nquestions\npeer discussions votes and group\ndiscussions the students then discuss\nthe question\nand their answers with one or two\nclassmates ideally with someone who\ndisagrees with their own opinion\nduring the discussion the students have\nto come up with a reason for their\nanswer and why the others may be wrong\nmeanwhile the instructor is circling\naround listening in to gauge student\nthinking and answering brief questions\nthen there will be a second clicker vote\nand only now the results will be shown\ntypically the second vote will be much\nbetter than the first as students learn\na great deal from their discussions\nan ideal question will have about a\nthird correct on the first vote and 85\npercent correct on the second\nall this takes around seven minutes\nstep four now the professor leads a\nfollow-up discussion with all the\nstudents to provide feedback\nexploring the different reasoning which\none is correct and importantly\nwhich is incorrect and why\nonly at the very end professor wyman\nwill explain the correct solution and\nanswer follow-up questions\nascertaining the student's understanding\nfrom the questions they ask\nhe decides if it is time to move on all\nof which takes around\n10 minutes there are three reasons why\nactive learning works so well\nfirst the students are actively working\non interesting problems\nand as they all voted for an answer\nright at the beginning\nthey have a stake in the outcome that\nmeans their brains decide that the\ninformation covered is important to be\nremembered\nand are hence more receptive for\nlearning\nsecond by solving problems alone and in\ngroups they dive deeply into the\nmaterial\nexplaining to appear engages novel\nmental processes\nas a result they construct new synaptic\npathways inside their brains\nthird the explanation from the teacher\ncomes only once the students already\nformed their own thoughts about the\nconcept\nat this point the explanation makes more\nsense as the brain can connect the new\ninformation\nto all the thought it had just built the\ncorrect answers have a solid foundation\na large body of research has shown big\ndifferences in the outcomes between\npassive\nand active learning in one carefully\nexecuted experiment\nphysics instructors taught their course\nin two ways some classes were taught in\na conventional style\nand others using active learning even\nthough the teachers were the same and\nthe students were similar\non average the active learners doubled\ntheir understanding when they were\ntested at the end of the course\n[Music]\nother experiments have shown that\nlong-term retention is higher as well\nstudents that take conventional lecture\nthat is followed by a test forget around\nninety percent of the material within\nsix months\nin an active learning environment\nstudents can retain more than seventy\npercent of what they have learned\ntwo years later\nsometimes teachers show a problem and\nthen demonstrate to the class how to\nsolve it\nthey believe that they can just transfer\ntheir own thinking into the student's\nhead through an explanation\nunfortunately for new ideas a brain\ndoesn't work that way\nunless the brain actively constructs\nthose ideas within\nit is as if the material was never heard\nhow about you have you ever learned in\nan active learning environment\nand if so how does it compare to\nlearning the conventional way\n[Music]\nsprouts videos are published under the\ncreative commons license\nthat means our
