    "video_title": "Pavlovâ€™s Classical Conditioning",
    "transcript": "Classical conditioning is a way of\nlearning where a stimulus that triggers\na biological response is paired with a\nnew stimulus that then results in the\nsame reaction.\nThe most famous work in classical\nconditioning was done by Ivan Pavlov in\nthe 1890s. During this time Pavlov did a\nlot of research around the digestive\nprocesses of dogs. One day during his\nresearch Pavlov noticed that the dogs\nbegan to salivate in the presence of the\ntechnician who normally fed them. He\nwondered if the technician was a trigger\nthat stimulated a response associated\nwith food? To find out he constructed an\nexperiment that would allow him to\nmeasure a dog's output of saliva. First\nhe served the dog food. Then he served\nfood while playing the sounds of a\nmetronome and repeated the process a few\ntimes.\nfinally he removed the food and only\nplayed the metronome. The dogs began to\nsalivate in response to the metronome\nalone. Pavlov concluded that if a new\nstimulus was present when the dog was\ngiven food then that stimulus became\nassociated with food and caused salivation\non its own.\nWhen he published his findings Pavlov\ncalled the food an \"unconditioned\nstimulus\" because its effects on the dog\nwere not learned instead they triggered\nan \"unconditioned response\" that happened\nnaturally and completely out of the\ndog's control. the metronome is at first\na \"neutral stimulus\" through the process\nof repetitive pairing with food the dog\nlearns to connect the two. This means\nthat the \"neutral stimulus\" becomes the\n\"conditioned stimulus\" and the response to\nthat a \"conditioned response\". He also\nreported that 1) learning occurred most\nrapidly when the interval between the\nsound and the appearance of the food was\nshort. 2) the saliva produced by the\nsound differed in composition from that\nproduced by the food, which means that\nthe conditioned response was not an\nexact replica of the unconditioned\nresponse. 3) while there are several forms\nof conditioning such as forward and\nbackward conditioning, classical\nconditioning cannot create new behavior\nor be used for training, but instead\ntriggers involuntary biological\nresponses. 4) we can almost entirely\nundo the conditioning. This happens\nthrough extinction: when we repeatedly\npresent the conditioned stimulus in the\nabsence of the unconditioned stimulus.\nSo what occurs inside the brain? When a\ndog sees the food the signals from the\neyes and nose stimulate the brain which\nactivates the salivation glands to\nsecrete saliva to aid the dog with the\ndigestion. When a dog hears a sound the\nears send a signal to the brain which\ntakes note but has no reason to activate\nanything. When the two different\nneurological processes are being\nactivated simultaneously new synaptic\nconnections occur between the auditory\nstimulus and the behavioral response.\nOver time these synapses are\nstrengthened so that it only takes the\nsound to activate the pathway leading to\nsalivation.\nYou can try this popular classroom\nexercise: take a friend, sit down and\nrelax for two minutes. Then allow your\npartner to check and record your pulse\nrate. Your partner will then tap a pencil\non the desk, five times. Right after stand\nup and hop on one leg for 30 seconds and\nthen check your pulse again! Repeat the\nprocedure four times having the partner\nrecord all data. After relaxing for the\nfifth time your partner will tap the\npencil five times as usual now instead\nof getting up for your exercise, only\ncheck your pulse.\nIf the conditioning was successful your\npulse rate will rise even without\nengaging in exercise!\nWhat do you think does classical\nconditioning always work? If so, are\ncommercials a form of mental\nmanipulation and should we limit\nadvertising in public spaces?\n \nSprouts videos are published under the\nCreative Commons license that means our\nvideos are free and anyone can download\nedit and play them for personal use, and\npublic schools governments and nonprofit\norganizations can also use them for\ntraining, online courses, or designing new\ncurriculums.\nTo help us stay independent and support\nour work you can join our patrons and\ncontribute just visit www.patreon.com/sprouts.
