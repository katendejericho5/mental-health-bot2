    "transcript": "When we study in another country or move \ninto a new town, we are often exposed to  \na culture different from ours and need \nto go through four stages of transition:\nHoneymoon, frustration, \nadjustment, and adaptation.\nDuring stage two, some experience a real \nculture shock, severe forms of which can  \nlead to reactions that may need medical \nattention. But before we come to that,  \nlet’s first look at what happens typically.\nIn stage 1 — honeymoon — everything is beautiful. \nThe people are friendly, the culture rich, and the  \nway of local life fascinating. We are optimistic \nand excited about all the differences.\nIn stage 2 we feel frustration. Reality \nsets in. We have come to understand that  \nthere are plenty of barriers to connecting \nwith people and have difficulty with the  \nsocial norms. We start to reject local \ntraditions and begin to feel homesick.\nThe stage of adjustment is \ncharacterized by a growing  \nfamiliarity with our new way of life. \nWe begin to understand the new customs,  \nacquire language skills, and make local \nfriends. We start to feel more comfortable.\nLast is adaptation. During this stage, we \ngain a sense of belonging and are able to  \nfully participate in the new culture, even while \nmaintaining our own native identity. Known as the  \nstage of mastery, we now start to feel at home. \nHowever, not everyone arrives at this point.\nSome people are excited about \nthe foreign culture for months,  \nand others start to get frustrated \non day one. And then there are those  \nwho experience a culture shock that is so \nstrong that they leave before adjusting.\nThe Paris Syndrome is the most extreme form \nof culture shock. It typically strikes some  \nJapanese tourists who come to the \nFrench capital full of excitement  \nand romantic expectations but are then \nconfronted with filth and arrogance.\nThe 20 or so travelers that are \nreported to be hit each year,  \nexperience a wide range of psychiatric and \npsychosomatic symptoms, including anxiety,  \nhallucinations, and vomiting. And so they \nleave deeply distressed before they adjust.\nThose who have adapted to a new society, may \nface a surprise when they eventually return  \nhome. After another honeymoon, they \noften enter a reverse culture shock,  \nrealizing how much they have been estranged from \ntheir old way of life. But it can get worse.\nThe ones who are pushed into a new culture \nwithout being asked, often skip honeymoon  \naltogether and enter straight into the stage of \nfrustration. If that happens without the right  \nsupport, they never really settle in, can’t \nadjust, and remain frustrated indefinitely.\nStudies show that toddlers who are sent for \ntheir first days at preschool without anyone  \nto accompany them, experience so much anxiety \nthat they can’t bond with their teachers.\nAs a result they remain freighted to \ngo and clock significantly more sick  \ndays for their entire preschool \nyears. This is why good schools  \noften demand that parents stay with their \nchildren until they can fully settle in.\nThe original research on culture shock \nwas conducted by Sverre Lysgaard in the  \n1950s after the sociologist had talked \nto many Norwegians who had spent time in  \nthe United States — mostly for academic reasons. \nAnalyzing his interviews, he saw a clear pattern.\nThe culture shock curve with happiness on one \naxis, and months in a foreign country on another;  \nshows that, on average, the honeymoon period \nlasts for around 2 months. Then there are  \nabout 6 months of frustration before adjustment \nhappens. Adaptation starts after close to a year.\nWhat about you?
