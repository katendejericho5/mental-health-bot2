    "video_title": "Education Reform: The New Orleans School Experiment",
    "transcript": "Going to school in New Orleans in the\nearly 2000s was dismal, with only one in\nfour children scoring at their standard\ngrade level. The City School Board was so\ncorrupt that the FBI started an\ninvestigation and eventually put its\npresident and 30 others into jail. On top\nof this almost all of the teachers were\norganized in unions. This ensured that\neven the worst teachers kept their job\nfor life. Idealistic educators and\npoliticians tried to change the system\nbut their efforts were blocked by those\nin charge who did everything possible to\nkeep things as they were. Then things got\nworse. In 2005 Katrina, a massive\nhurricane, struck the city and destroyed\nvirtually everything including all\nschools. As a result, everyone left the\ncity. Kids stopped going to school. The\nschool board lost all of its funding and\nthe teachers lost their jobs leading to\nunions losing all of their members. It\nwas a true disaster for everyone. In the\naftermath of Katrina politicians,\nbureaucrats and educators saw an\nopportunity to finally bring change\nupon a system that had previously failed\nso many kids in such a miserable way.\nUnder the leadership of governor\nKathleen Blanco it was concluded that\nwhile they didn't know the best solution\nthey did know that the system had to be\ncreated using trial and error and\nexperimentation. They had an idea: Instead\nof running a top-down system of state\nschools, their idea was to allow\nindependent charter schools to take over.\nCharters are schools that are fully\nstate-funded, free of charge and run by\nindependent entrepreneurs who follow\ntheir mission. Charter schools hire their\nown teachers and set up their own\ncurriculums. They often even build their\nown facilities and then compete with one\nanother to attract new students. As a\nresult of this bold effort to reform\na lot of philanthropists and nonprofit\norganizations invested into New Orleans\neducation and hundreds of charter\nschools opened up. Parents and their\nchildren suddenly had a lot of choices\nin picking schools aligned with their\nideas regarding quality education. The\nschools that didn't attract enough\nchildren closed down again.\nin 2019, 15 years later, almost half of\nall students performed at grade level.\nHigh school graduation rates increased\nand college outcomes became\nsignificantly better. New Orleans had\nbecome the first large American city\nthat does not operate a single\ntraditional public school. The story of\nNew Orleans schools shows what is\npossible when old structures break down\nand people have no choice but to leave a\ndamaged system. Good people who were\nstuck in a bad system then get an\nopportunity to start fresh. Parents and\nchildren have the opportunity to choose\nfor themselves the type of schools that\nthey believe in. How are the schools\norganized in your country? Do you think\nthat a reform of that system would\nbenefit the students? If so, what change\nwould you propose?\n \n \nIf you like this video and the way we\nexplain the subject subscribe to our\nchannel.
