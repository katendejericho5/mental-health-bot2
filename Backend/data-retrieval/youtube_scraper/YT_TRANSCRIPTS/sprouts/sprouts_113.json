    "transcript": "Jerome Bruna's theory of development is\nbased on the assumption that we learn\nbest when we go from concrete to\nabstract in a three-step process. First\ncomes hands-on action, then learning with\nimages, and finally students transform\nwhat they've learned into language.\nthroughout the experience we constantly\nrevisit previously learned topics while\nteachers provide carefully structured\nguidance along the way. And it seems to\nwork.. In the 1980's the Singaporean\ngovernment decided to stop importing\nforeign textbooks and instead build the\nworld's best maths curriculum from\nscratch.\nSince that time Singaporeans study fewer\nconcepts with greater detail following\nBruner's guideline. Before we learn how\nwell this worked out let's go through\neach step of the theory with an example:\nFirst, we learn through en-active\nrepresentation. This happens in hands-on\nexperiences ideally with real-world\napplications: to divide 4 by 2, students learn to cut a cake into 4\nslices so each can eat one now and bring\none home later.\nStep two is iconic representation: we now\nlink our memories of the experience to\niconic pictures. Students are asked to\ndraw a cake that was cut into four\npieces.\nLast comes symbolic representation. We\nnow use the images we internalized\nearlier and turn them into abstract\nlanguage such as mathematical symbols.\nUsing a little bit of retrospection we\ncan easily solve the problem.\nThis last phase is also called language\nbased because we are really just\nlearning the right words and symbols to\nexpress our thoughts. The actual maths\nknowledge was acquired much earlier\nthrough hands-on experiences. Bruner\ntherefore advocated for the use of a\nspiral curriculum with continuous\nrepetition of the same fundamental ideas.\nThe curriculum is comprised of three\ncharacteristics: students revisit the\nsame topic at regular intervals, the\ncomplexity of the topic increases with\neach revisit, the new learning has a\nrelationship with previous learning.\nTeachers also use scaffolding, a term\ncoined by Bruner. Teachers do this by\nstructuring activities based on students\nexisting knowledge and in a way that\nhelps them to reach the desired learning\noutcome. The teacher first demonstrates\nthe process as the student watches then\nthe teacher lets the students have a go,\nsteps back and offers support and\nfeedback when needed. Today, by the way,\nSingapore's fourth and eighth graders\nare the world's best in both mathematics\nand science and Singapore's maths\ncurriculum is copied by educators from\naround the world. Jerome Bruner was born\nblind in New York City in 1915. At the age of\ntwo modern medicine restored his vision.\nLater he returned the favor by becoming\na pioneer in cognitive development.\nHe believed that any subject can be\ntaught in an intellectually honest form,\nto any child, at any stage of development.\nWhat do you think about Bruna's theory\nand his suggestion for better learning?\nIs this how you learn in your studies? If\nnot, what is one subject that you think\ncould be made more understandable by\nfollowing his ideas?\n \nif you like this video and the way we\nexplain the subject subscribe to our\nchannel we try to explain complex\nsubjects and simple language and\ncartoons to support students all around\nthe world in their learning if you want\nto support us you can go to WWII and\ncalm sprouts and donate just $1 from"
