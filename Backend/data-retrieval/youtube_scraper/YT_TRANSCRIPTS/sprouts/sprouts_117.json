    "video_title": "Peter Principle: When People Get Promoted Into Maximum Incompetence",
    "transcript": "The Peter Principle argues that people who have success and big hierarchical organizations are promoted and promoted and\nPromoted until they reach their own level of incompetence.\nAfter this, they get never promoted again and are often stuck there for life. To understand this better\nLet's look at a real-life example:\nDavid and Diana two graduates first met at a sales training to become representatives for P Pharma.\nThey were so proud to have gotten a job in which they could actually help people.\nThe company had just invented Oxy Devil,  a promising new painkiller,\nWhich the company advertised as being non-addictive. Little did they know that they had joined one of the most dangerous\norganizations in modern America.\nBoth do a good job of convincing doctors to prescribe Oxy Devil, whenever one of their patients has pain.\nOver the years they all become friends and often celebrate their achievements together.\nBoth deliver great sales numbers and eventually get promoted to managers.\nThe transition happens without much training and while Diana was a great rep,  she is a terrible manager.\nColleagues begin disrespecting her and Diana becomes very unhappy at work. As a result\nShe decides to put less effort into the job and doesn't realize that something odd is going on.\nSome members of Diana's team start selling Oxy Devil by the millions to small unknown clinics\nDavid is a natural. He knows what to do with his weakest reps and how to celebrate those who perform well.\nHe becomes a rising star in the organization and after a few years gets promoted to the position of Sales Director.\nNow when Diana sees David in the cafeteria she avoids him. She's afraid to expose her inabilities.\nShe is overly focused on herself and doesn't realize how stressed he looks. David's new position as a director is highly complex.\nHe lacks the analytical skills to make sense of the numbers.\nHe does not understand why the sales of oxy devil have increased so dramatically.\nHe feels insecure in order to compensate for that feeling.\nHe starts working extra long hours. The night before his first board meeting he doesn't sleep at all.\nHe's too afraid others will realize that he's a complete failure at his job.\nThe meeting starts with a science team,\nThey present new research that reveals that Oxy Devil is in fact very addictive and that hundreds of thousands of people could be affected.\nThe room gets completely quiet.\nThen the lawyer speaks up and confirms that there is nothing to worry about as the product had been approved by the FDA.\nShe adds that sales should now soar until the patent expires. The marketing director is relieved.\nHe can carry on running the same TV commercials. David wants to say something but doesn't dare speak up\nThere is only one person who understands that some of the people in the room have reached the so-called Peters Plateau or\ntheir final level of incompetence.\nThis is Richard Succar CEO and member of the billionaire P Pharma family.\nSo how does Peter's principle work?\nPeople advance in their careers because they have high skills in a specific task.\nOnce promoted these skills are often irrelevant to the new job.\nThe new skills required are above their ability level or they may not have received the required training.\nNote that their new manager might also be a victim of the Peter Principle and doesn't realize that training would be a good idea. And,\nthere are incentives at play. People often work hard to reach a certain position or salary once they achieve that some get lazy.\nOnce people lose their passion\nthey stop learning. They may fail to keep up with new\ndevelopments which may eventually lead to poor quality of work. In order to protect their comfort zone\nthey challenge any new idea or person that can make their lives\nuncomfortable.\nEmployees that are incompetent are often unhappy.\nThey left a job at which they were fantastic and well respected by their colleagues, now they watch how their colleagues get promoted or\nremain equally stuck. This has a negative impact on the company. Frightened to lose their jobs\nincompetent managers celebrate obscurity and implement complicated procedures.\nThese procedures only make sense to the manager and leave colleagues feeling confused and uninformed\nSome may work very hard to make up for the lack of skills, for this reason their supervisors\ndon't dare let them go. The results are often complex and incompetent corporations that move too slow to innovate.\nThe Peter Principle was first introduced by authors Lawrence Peter and Raymond Hull in\n1969 since its introduction it has been an often discussed topic in the area of leadership in 2018.\nProfessors Alan Benson,\nDanielle Lee and Kelly Xu analyzed sales workers' performance and promotion practices at over 200 American businesses.\nConsistent with the principle the researchers found that high-performing sales reps were more likely to be promoted up the corporate ladder\nregardless of their managerial potential which led to massive costs to the businesses.\nWhile our story of David and Diana was fiction.
