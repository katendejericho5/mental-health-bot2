    "transcript": "The mere-exposure effect is a \npsychological phenomenon by which  \nwe tend to like things merely \nbecause we are exposed to them.\nSo, simply exposing you to a random thing \nrepeatedly, makes you like it. And the same  \ngoes for pop songs, products, and people — with \nthe exception of those we dislike initially,  \nseeing them more often can \nmake us dislike them further.\nKnown for discovering the effect \nwas psychologist Robert Zajonc,  \nwho had noticed that organisms exposed \nto something new, experience fear. Each  \nsubsequent exposure to that new thing \ncauses less fear and more interest.  \nAnd with more exposure, the observer begins \nto react fondly to the once novel stimulus.\nUsing a tachistoscope, and a group of people, \nhe exposed each person to a series of random  \nshapes that changed so quickly that it was \nimpossible to discern that some were repeated."
