    "video_title": "Project-Based Learning: How It Works and Why Itâ€™s So Effective",
    "transcript": "project-based learning in short PBL is a\npowerful way to learn new things and\nremember them for a long time it\ndescribes a form of learning that\nhappens as a result to solving actual\nproblems it's arguably so effective\nbecause first it gives solving problems\nmeaning and second because each task in\na project is mentally tied along a\nstoryline which eventually leads to\neither failure or success of an entire\nproject that means what we learn during\nthe process has more meaning and we can\nremember it later by mentally revisiting\nour project story business visionary\nElon Musk explained it quite well he\nsaid that our brain has evolved to\ndiscard information that it thinks has\nirrelevance picking a problem and then\nusing various education tools like math\nlanguage or economics to solve that\nproblem is therefore far more engaging\nthan teaching the tools itself say we\nare going to take apart an engine to see\nhow it works and then put it back\ntogether again in order to take it apart\nwe need wrenches screwdrivers a winch\nand other tools in the course of solving\nthat problem of taking apart the engine\nwe learn about the tools how to apply\nthem and why they matter to understand\nit better let's look at the story of\nJane a shy 19 year old student who\nwanted to move out from home but\nmiserably failed Jane just finished her\nhigh school degree and still lives with\nher parents she is eager to move out and\nlive on her own but she has a tight\nbudget\nJane begins her project with asking\naround where do her friends recommend\nher to live how much do they pay she\nstarts to search online but is soon\noverwhelmed by all the options\nJane learns that her search is not\neffective unless she knows precisely how\nmuch money she can spend for rent her\nbrain takes note that such a big project\nneeds proper planning the next day Jane\nspends making some serious calculations\nabout her income her savings and her\nmonthly expenses like food phone bills\ngoing to the movies her calculation\nleads to the conclusion that her budget\nfor rent is very small she starts\nthinking about taking on a job tutoring\nmusic two kids this could get her\nanother $200 a month although there are\nadditional expenses since she would need\nto buy a new guitar\nJane's brain goes through the various\ncomputations making a cost-benefit\nanalysis and decides to try moving out\nwithout taking on a job\nJane is happy she made up her mind and\nrealized that math is a good tool that\nsupports making an informed decision\nthe next day Jane starts searching\nonline again this time for a shared home\nit doesn't take her long and she makes\nher first call to get an appointment to\nmeet the hosts this is her first viewing\nthere are three flatmates they tell her\nto sit down and start asking very\ndirectly about her habits preferences\nand how to describe her personality\nJane starts to feel uncomfortable and\nstressed all she wants is to leave she\ncompletely stops focusing she excuses\nherself and simply walks out outside she\nfeels terrible\nher brain notes an increased heart rate\nsome confusion about how to describe\nJane and a lack of communication skills\nresponding to immediate social pressure\nin the evening she lies in bed and can't\nsleep she starts to have doubts should\nshe really move out maybe this is not\nfor her maybe she is too young to live\nwith such independent people she decides\nthat she will stay at home for now\neventually she falls asleep during her\nsleep her brain keeps working and\nrevisits the experiences of that day it\nputs the experience in perspective and\ndecides what can be forgotten a few days\nlater Jane meets an old friend who has\njust moved into a shared house and tells\nher about his experience it sounded so\nexciting her friend made his project a\nreality\nJane remembers her initial motivation\nhow much she wanted to be independent\nshe decides to give it another try Jane\nspends the entire evening looking at\nlistings noting down the most promising\nposts at midnight she calls her best\nfriend asking him to describe her\npersonality to prepare for her next\ndinner\nher brain fueled by millions of excited\nneurotransmitters now learns with laser\nsharp focus the next day she goes to see\nthree new apartments she learns to\nanswer questions about herself and even\nask questions about the others\ndo you mind if I play guitar what do you\ndo for a living\nwhat are your thoughts on keeping it\ntidy on her fourth appointment Jane\nfinds an apartment with two super-fun\nroommates who share lots of her\ninterests two days later she arrives at\nher new home with her backpack and a big\nsmile on her face a new life begins in\nthe evening her brain notes all the\nthings that learned during the project\nher budget calculation her preferences\nher social anxiety and new developed\nsocial skills most importantly the brain\nrealizes that getting better at social\nskills is similar to improving her\nguitar skills we get better with\npractice\nten years later Jane reads a study from\n2009 that showed that PBL students\nperform as well or better than\ntraditional students findings indicated\nthat projects were superior when it\ncomes to long-term retention skill\ndevelopment and satisfaction of both\nstudents and teachers traditional\nlearning approaches were more effective\nfor short-term retention as measured by\nstandardized board exams the idea of\nproject-based learning was made popular\nby the educational reformer John Dewey\nin 1916 he claimed that the student\nlearns more if he is interested in the\nsubject and recommended learning by\ndoing or learning by solving a problem\nDewey further stressed the importance of\nthe connection between life and the\nobjects we are studying on learning he\nsaid if knowledge comes from the\nimpressions made upon us by natural\nobjects it is impossible to procure\nknowledge without the use of objects\nwhich impress the mind\nyou\nmillions of students from all around the\nglobe have watched our sprouts videos\nfor better learning thousands of\nteachers play them in their classrooms\nto start projects volunteers on YouTube\nhave translated them to over 25\nlanguages our mission is to promote\nlearning by doing in classrooms around\nthe world if you are a great explainer\nand a passionate teacher and you want to\nhelp us develop outstanding content\ncontact us to support our channel with a\ndonation visit
