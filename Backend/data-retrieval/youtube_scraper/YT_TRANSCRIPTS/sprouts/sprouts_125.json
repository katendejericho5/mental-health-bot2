    "transcript": "In response to the tragedy of World War\nII, people from the town Reggio Emilia\ndeveloped a new model of education. War\nought to never happened again.\nLed by Loris Malaguzzi, a teacher, their\nidea was to enhance a child's learning\nthrough real-life experiences instead of\na fixed curriculum so that each child\ndevelops a love for discovery, forms a\npersonality of their own and learns to\nrespect others. Land, money, food and\nskills for the first preschool were\nprovided by the community. The Reggio\nEmilia\napproach is based on the philosophy of\nan image of a child. All children are\nviewed full of potential, with an innate\nsense of curiosity and endless\nimagination. They are creative, capable of\nconstructing their own learning and they\nhave a natural interest to explore while\nthey follow their own interests they\nalso stay connected with others. Adults\nnurture their learning by providing a\nrich environment and support. Instead of\na one-size-fits-all curriculum Reggio\nEmilia uses a child centered approach\nand project-based learning projects can\nemerge anytime, for example during play.\nTeachers can observe and create\nopportunities for new learning at a\nspecific instance for example by opening\nup new environments, letting children\nraise thought-provoking questions or by\ninviting others to collaborate after an\nintervention. The children take control\nand progress independently until the\nproject is finished and can be shared\nwith others. Throughout a project\nchildren naturally embody the spirit of\nresearchers, risk takers, designers and\nexplorers. They make hypotheses, try new\nthings,\ninvestigate, play and imagine. To progress\nthe explorers raise the questions, the\nresearchers give feedback and the\ndesigners demonstrate ideas and\nprototypes.\nLastly they all turn their theories into\nreality and construct experiments\ntogether. The learning becomes social\nwith endless ways to solve specific\nproblems. To promote the development of\ncreativity teaches step aside and let\nmistakes happen. The conflicts that can\nfollow nurture their social skills.\nBecause conflicts teach children to\nspeak, to listen, to argue and to discuss,\nthen learn to accept different opinions\nand to respect others for who they are.\nIf two kids discuss a problem a third\ncan have an idea and the entire group\nlearns the value of teamwork. Teachers\ndocument projects through pictures,\nvideos or written observations. The\nlearnings become visible in photographs,\ndrawings or sculptures, ideas, quotes and\ntranscripts of conversations are put\nonto the walls. The children can later\nrevisit their achievements, see projects\nthat were left unfinished and learn\nthat failure is part of the path to\nprogress. They built confidence in their\nown abilities. But teachers aren't\ninstructors, instead they are companions\nin the child's own journey of discovery.\nThey can introduce books, show new tools\nor offer entirely new perspectives.\nHowever they always remain mindful not\nto take over the constructive learning\nprocess knowing that this limits a\nchild's endless imaginations and\nmotivation. The children are fully in\ncharge and develop a sense of ownership\nof their own progress, the foundation for\na love for lifelong learning. Malaguzzi\nbelieved that there are 100 languages\nchildren can use to express themselves:\nthey paint, sculpt, drum, whisper and hark\nthey build, listen, speak or sing and\ndance and they play, which Einstein\nallegedly said, is the highest form of\nresearch.\nChildren learn from adults, other\nstudents, the environment which is\nregarded as the third teacher. Rich in\nmaterials the space is designed to spark\ncuriosity, creation and discovery.\nIdeally there is an open kitchen and big\nwindows so the children can see what's\nhappening outside, just like at an\nItalian town square, a piazza, where\nwe can observe the lives of other\nmembers of our community. Parents are\nregarded is the last part of this\neducation. To deepen their knowledge of a\nchild centered education they are\nencouraged to learn from and with the\nteachers and children so when the\nchildren come home after school they can\ncontinue to be researchers, risk takers\nand explorers. Malaguzzi once said: \"stand\naside for a while and leave room for\nlearners, observe carefully what children\ndo and then if you have understood well,\nperhaps teaching will be different from\nbefore\". Maybe one day our small\nresearchers and explorers will grow into\nthe big inventors and great explorers.\nMillions of students from all around the\nglobe have watched our sprouts videos\nfor better learning, thousands of\nteachers play them in their classrooms\nto start projects, volunteers on YouTube\nhave translated them to over 25\nlanguages. Our mission is to promote\nlearning by doing in classrooms around\nthe world if you are a great explainer\nand a passionate teacher and you want to\nhelp us develop outstanding content\ncontact us, to support our channel with a\ndonation visit patreon.com/sprouts."
