    "video_title": "Stereotypes: The Truth Behind Cultural Clichés",
    "transcript": "A Stereotype is a common belief about a particular \ncategory of things or a group of people,  \nsuch as their personality, preferences, \nappearance or ability. For example:\nFrench are fashionable, arrogant, \nromantic, and have poor hygiene.\nGermans are punctual, hardworking, \nstraightforward, and have no sense of humor.\nAmericans are optimistic, loud, \nmaterialistic, and lack cultural awareness.\nAnd Japanese are shy, disciplined, can’t \ndrink alcohol, and love anything cute.\nAccurate or not, stereotypes help \nour mind to categorize information  \nand make predictions — so that \nwe can act fast without thinking.\nWhether you agree or disagree with any of \nthe clichés we presented about the French,  \nGermans, Americans, and Japanese, two types of \nstereotypes might have clouded your judgment.\nExplicit Stereotypes are preconceptions \nyou are aware of. For instance, you may  \nhave heard of the cliche that the French are \narrogant. Armed with this self-awareness,  \nyou try to interact with each French individual \nfrom a seemingly unbiased standpoint. However,  \nyou might still be judgmental, \nbecause of another sort of stereotype.\nImplicit stereotypes are those that guide \nyour thoughts from your subconscious — the  \nstories about people your parents might \nhave told you when you were too young  \nto remember. Associations that make you \njudgmental without you even realizing it.\nAnd that’s a problem.\nIf we are part of a group that is the target \nof stereotypes, they can become a threat.\nA stereotype threat occurs when \npeople are aware of the negative  \ncliché others hold against their \ngroup and then become afraid that  \nthey confirm it. As a consequence, \ntheir performance often decreases.\nSay a society holds the belief that boys are \nbetter in mathematics, teachers just need to  \npoint out that myth prior to math tests, and \nsome girls will get anxious and as a result,  \nperform worse than men. Even just sitting next \nto boys can significantly lower their grades.\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie summarized the problem \nlike this: “The single story creates stereotypes,  \nand the problem with stereotypes \nis not that they are untrue,  \nbut that they are incomplete. They \nmake one story become the only story.”\nSo what do you think? Are some stereotypes \nstill useful in today's diverse world? If yes,  \nwhy? And if not, how can we get rid of them? \nShare your thoughts in the comments below. And  \nwhile you are at it, tell us, are some of \nthe clichés presented in this video true?\nIf you like this video and want us to make more, \nsubscribe to our channel or support us on Patreon."
