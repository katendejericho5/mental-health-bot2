    "transcript": "The early Prussian school system provided \neight-years of instruction in reading,  \nwriting, music and religious studies. \nIt imposed a strict ethos of duty,  \ndiscipline and obedience. And that worked.\nThe model turned into a big cultural, \neconomical and military success.\nNot long after, state officials all around \nthe world started writing curriculums,  \nand public education became \nboth: a child’s right and duty.\nIn 1938 the Germans then went one step \nfurther and made school attendance  \ncompulsory. Ever since it’s not parents, but \nthe state that makes sure kids go to school.\nToday 85% out of all adults worldwide are literate \nand access to information is abundant. Should  \ngovernment officials still have \na monopoly on how we learn?\nA growing number of parents don’t \nthink so and want to take control  \nover their own child’s education. They \nadvocate for what’s called unschooling.\n "
