    "transcript": "Waldorf education is based on the principles of\nAnthroposophy by Rudolf Steiner.\nSteiner founded the first school\nin 1919 Stuttgart Germany\nto educate the children of the factory workers\nfrom the Waldorf Astoria Zigaretten Fabrik\n- hence the name.\nAll kids, independent of social status or talent\nreceived the same instruction,\nwhich made the school a pioneer \nof social justice in education.\nThe goal of a Waldorf \neducation is to develop free,\nbut morally responsible individuals\nequipped with a high degree of social competence\nand creative capabilities.\nFactual knowledge,\nhomework and tests scores receive less attention.\nStorytelling and experimentation\nare the main method of instruction,\nOver the twelve-year curriculum,\nstudents learn math,\nliterature,\nhistory and science\nas well as a wide variety \nof arts and hands-on skills.\nElementary students paint,\nknit,\nweave and sculpt with wax.\nOlder ones make patterns,\nbooks,\npottery and sculpt in stone.\nEverybody learns to do music.\nFirst all play the flute,\nthen some play string instruments\nand others join the choir.\nStudents play non-competitive games\nand learn to dance eurhythmy.\nThey do organic farming\nand learn two foreign languages,\nwhich in the first years are taught through songs,\nstorytelling and conversations.\nIn grade 8 and 12\nthe entire class develops a classical drama\nwhich they perform in front \nof their parents and friends.\nWaldorf uses a unique\nproject based approach to almost\nall main academic subjects.\nInstead of repetitive schedules,\na specific subject,\nsuch as history,\nmath,\nscience or even gardening\ndominates the first two hours in the morning\nfor a period of 4-6 weeks.\nAfter that, a new subject gets the main focus.\nSteiner also invented an experiential\napproach to science\nwhereby students observe\nand later describe scientific concepts\nin their own words and drawings\nrather than learning about \nthem in a textbook first.\nWaldorf schools therefore consider computers\nuseful to children only in their teens,\nafter they have mastered fundamental,\ntime-honored ways of discovering\ninformation and learning.\nIn the spirit of personal development and empathy,\ncompetition and grades are being avoided.\nTeachers instead assess the student’s individual\ngrowth of character.\nTests scores and grades are \nonly slowly introduced to\nolder students as they prepare for college\nand entrance exams.\nToday there are over\na thousand Waldorf schools in 60 countries,\nmaking it one of the largest independent\nschool movements.\nWaldorf has become a recognized\neducational theory in Europe\nand its schools have received state funding.\nFamous Waldorf parents include Clint Eastwood,\nLenny Kravitz,\nthe Forbes family\nand many parents from Silicon Valley’s tech sector\ndespite Steiner’s critical view of technology\nand mass media.\nSteve Jobs once told a tech journalist\nwho asked whether his children like the new iPad\nthat they haven’t used it and continued:\n“We limit how much technology \nour kids use at home.”\nAcclaimed psychiatrist \nWilliam Glasser famously said\nthat we learn 10% of what we read,\n20% of what we hear,\n30% of what we see,\nbut 80% of what we experience.\none could argue that despite \ntheir low-tech approach,\nthe experimental learning method of\nWaldorf education is exceptionally contemporary.\nWhat do you think?\nPlease share your thoughts in the comments below!"
