    "video_title": "The Future of Work: An Economic Theory by David Autor",
    "transcript": "Technological advancements are changing\nthe prospects for employment\nat an unprecedented speed.\nThings that just 5 years ago were done by humans,\nare now done by machines and code.\nThe long-term benefits are probably positive\nas things will likely become cheaper\nand we’ll have more time for leisure.\nUntil then individuals not prepared for the changes\nmay be replaced by machines,\nget laid off or take pay cuts.\nTo figure out if your job will be affected,\nMIT economist David Autor\ndefined three questions you should ask yourself.\nFirst, will technology compliment\nor replace the job you provide?\nComputers can’t think for themselves.\nBut they can and will do jobs that follow clear rules\nso programmers can tell them what to do.\nTherefore, people employed in jobs\nthat can be programmed away\nwill be driven out of work\nor find themselves in less paying positions.\nOn the other hand,\npeople that use technology to become more productive,\nwill hold onto their positions\nand even see a raise in income.\nSecond, is the demand for the product\nor service you help provide elastic?\nIf you run a cleaning service in a city where most people\nstill mop their own floors,\ntechnology might help you to offer\nyour services more efficiently.\nThe resulting lower prices,\nmakes your service suddenly more attractive\nto low-income households\nand the additional demand creates new jobs.\nHowever,\nif you work in the kitchen of a noodle shop empire\nthere will be a point at which no matter\nhow efficient you make the noodles,\npeople won’t buy an additional bowl\n- they are full.\nTherefore, the quantity demanded for food\nis not very elastic\nand more efficiency will not create more jobs,\nbut rather the opposite.\nThird, can you easily be replaced by other people?\nIf your job is easy to learn and can be done by others,\nthen you will feel pressure on your wages.\nBut if you are highly skilled or you possess unique character strengths,\nthen there will be less competition for your position.\nThus offering you job security and a stable income.\nUntil societies implement good models\nto share the wealth and the leisure time\nthat technological advances will bring us,\nthe most creative problem solvers\nand adaptive team players\nwill reap the fruits of an uncertain future.\nChildren that start school today,\nwill look for a job in 20 years.\nWhat do you think?\nWhat jobs will most likely disappear in your community\nand how should schools and parents\nprepare their kids to do meaningful work then?"
