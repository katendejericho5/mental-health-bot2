    "transcript": "Feynman learning technique is effective\nfull learning something new\ndeepen your understanding of what you\nalready know\nor helping you study for an exam\nthe first step is to pick a topic\nyou want to understand and start studying it.\nonce you know what it is\nabout take a piece of paper and write about it\nas if you're teaching the idea to someone else\nideally write and speak at the same time\njust as a teacher does it at the blackboard\nthis makes you realize which part you\nunderstand and where you still have gaps\nwhenever you get stuck go back to study\nand repeat that process until you have\nexplained the whole topic from start to\nend\nwhen you're done repeat the process from the beginning\nbut this time simplify your language or\nuse a graphic analogy to make a point\nif your explanation ends up wordy or\nconfusing\nyou probably have not understood it well\nenough so you should start again\nthinking about an idea by explaining it\nmakes this learning method very effective\nonce you can explain an idea in simple\nlanguage you have deeply understood it\nand will remember it for a long time\nRichard Feynman was a leading\ntheoretical physicist who received a\nNobel Prize for his work in quantum\nelectrodynamics\nhe was notorious for asking his fellow mathematicians to explain concepts in simple language\nto test their understanding\nthanks for watching\nalso check out others Sprouts learning\ntechniques\nas they can complement the methods explained in this video\nplease use the comments below to give us feedback or tell us which of the\ntechniques is your favorite"
