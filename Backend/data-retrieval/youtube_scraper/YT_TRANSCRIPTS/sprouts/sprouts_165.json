    "video_title": "Experiential Learning: How We All Learn Naturally",
    "transcript": "Arguably the most natural \nand powerful form of learning\nis through experience,\nor more precisely through reflection on doing.\nAlso called experiential learning,\nit’s what prima ballerinas do\nafter their performance at the national opera.\nBut it also happens to boys that are sad\nbecause their father got angry\nwhen they played football in the living room.\nBy the age of one,\nwe all had our own painful encounter with\nexperiential learning\nwhen we tried to walk, failed,\nfell and cried like, well a baby…\nAnd even though this was an unpleasant and\ndiscouraging exercise that lasted for months\nin the end\nwe all made it.\nHow is that possible?\nAs soon as we fell and the first shock was over,\nour brain unconsciously began to make sense\nout of all of the information available\nto identify how this embarrassment occurred.\nIt remembers that when we pushed ourselves up,\neverything was fine:\nour feet on the floor,\nour arms in position and our head\nand shoulders up right.\nReady to go!\nWhen our upper leg muscles\npulled our left foot 12.3% to the front\nat an angle of 23 degree,\nour arms didn’t compliment the movement\nand the ventricles in the inner ear,\nresponsible for static balance,\ngot confused for a second.\nWhen at the same moment the cat ran by,\nour eyes sent an alarming \nsignal to the hippocampus\nand we completely lost it…\nOutch!\nUnconsciously this is how our brain analyses\nthe relationship of events within our body\nor in the environment.\nIt happens all the time as we learn to walk,\ntalk,\nkiss,\nfunction in a fancy office\nor dance the salsa.\nOnce we understand the connections between\nwhat went wrong,\nwe know what we need to change\nwhen we try the next time.\nExperiential Learning\ncan also be used explicitly to learn a new skill\nor to become better at what we already love doing.\nHere is how it works:\nFirst get yourself into a situation to experience.\nAfter, reflect on what happened.\nThen try to understand the relationships\nto form an abstract concept\n- if I do A,\nI get B.\nLast, decide what to do differently next time.\nThen do it again.\nExperiential learning is also \nbelieved to be responsible\nfor the fact that musicians\ngenerally fare better at most tests,\nregardless of what they measure.\nPeople that practice an instrument\nnot only engage their brain in motor,\nvisual and auditory areas,\nbut they also learn by \nreflecting on what they’re doing\nwith a fast feedback loop\n– a wrong tone on the violin sounds too terrible\nto remain unnoticed.\nWhile playing they therefore \nnot only learn to make music,\nbut also that progress in \ngeneral comes through practice,\nreflection,\nunderstanding,\nand repetition.\nYou can use it with your friends\nor colleagues when working on a project.\nSilicon Valley start-ups do it\nwhen they tell their developers \nto get out of the building!\nAfter the interaction with \nreal potential customers,\nthe team gets together,\nanalyses the feedback\nand decides what to do next.\nTell us, what do you think?\nIs learning through reflecting on doing\nonly good when acquiring new hands-on skills\nor is it also suitable to study science,\nmath,\nthe humanities\nor abstract art?"
