    "transcript": "The Flipped Classroom is a new method of teaching\nthat is turning the traditional \nclassroom on its head.\nEvery day,\nthousands of teachers deliver\nthe exact same lesson in \nclass to millions of students.\nEvery night,\nmillions of students sit \nover the exact same homework,\ntrying to figure out how to solve it.\nThe Flipped Classroom is turning this upside down.\nTraditionally students listen to \nlectures and take tests in class\nand read textbooks and work \non problem sets at home.\nIn flip teaching,\nstudents first study the topic by themselves,\ntypically using video lessons on YouTube\nand then apply the knowledge\nby solving problems and doing \npractical work in class.\nModern schools who flipped their classroom\nreport many benefits:\n1. It allows all students \nto learn at their own pace\nas videos can be watched again.\n2. It's more efficient,\nas students enter the classroom \nprepared to contribute.\n3. It enriches the lesson\nas more time can be spent \non group work and projects.\n4. Doing homework in class\nallows students to help each other,\nwhich benefits both the advanced\nand less advanced learners.\nFlipping also brings changes for teachers.\nTraditionally, teachers engage most\nwith the confident students who ask questions.\nFlipping allows teachers to target the students\nwho really need help\ninstead of just those who are confident.\nAlso, instead of instructing from the front,\nteachers “guide on the side”.\nThis allows them to work more closely\nwith individuals or small groups.\nTeachers that are not great presenters,\ncan use third-party videos to explain the concept\nand focus on methods of \nteaching that suits their style,\nsuch as project work or experiments.\nOnce video lectures are made available online\nteachers don’t need to give the same lecture\nover and over again.\nAgain, they gain more time\nto focus on the needs of their class.\nMany scholars also argue\nthat the flipped classroom model\npromotes equal learning opportunities\nas all kids get the same attention\nwhen doing their homework.\nCurrently kids with caring parents,\nolder siblings at home\nor expensive private tutors\nhave a clear advantage over those who don’t.\nLet us know what you think?\nIf you are a teacher,\ntell us if this model would \nbe possible in your classroom!\nIf you are a student,\nlet us know if you would prefer learning\nin a flipped classroom!"
