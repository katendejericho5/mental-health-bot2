    "transcript": "In this Sprouts Teaching Technique\nwe introduce the idea of “Student Leaders”,\na simple task based method teachers can use to build self-esteem,\nteach responsibility and help students take\npride in themselves and their classroom.\nTo create your own student leaders,\nthink about activities that your students can help you complete.\nWatering plants,\nbeing in charge of getting you books\nor anything that is easy for them to do\nand makes them feel special.\nNext, transform these tasks\ninto special roles for your students.\nInstead of just having your students water your plants,\ngive them the title of “Rain-Maker.”\nInstead of getting a book,\nname them the “Book-Master”.\nGiving these tasks a title will make them excited to help you.\nIt will also help them pay attention\nand feel good about themselves.\nSome tasks can be daily and some every few days.\nIt helps to create a “Student Leader”\ncalendar for all your students to see\nand make sure that you rotate through the tasks\nand that everyone gets a turn at every task.\nPlease use the comments below\nto let us know what you think!\nIf you are a student,\ntell us if you’ve ever been a student leader.\nIf you are a teacher,\nshare your tips on how to use this in your classroom.\nWe’re releasing updates regularly,\nso don’t forget to subscribe to our channel.\nThank you for watching!"
