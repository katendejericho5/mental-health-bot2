    "transcript": "In this video, we introduce “Fruit Salad”\na group game to make class more fun, boost\nenergy and allow students to get to know each\nother better.\nTeachers can play the game with kids 8 years\nor older and with group size from 8 to 30.\nOne session can take 5 to 30 minutes and all\nyou need is a room and some chairs.\nStart with all students sitting in a circle\nand the student with the most recent birthday\nstanding in the middle.\nThen the student standing asks the questions\nthat can be answered with yes or no.\nYounger children might ask: Do you like vanilla\nice cream?\nOr do you like to get up early?\nOlder players are often more personal like\ndid you ever kiss anyone?\nDid you ever do something that your parents\nwould not allow?\nAll students who have answered questions with\nyes, get up immediately and try to find a\nnew chair without speaking their answers out\nloud.\nThey can pick any chairs except their own\nor the one right next to them.\nWhile everybody is up, looking for a new seat.\nThe aim of the player in the middle is to\ncatch a free chair.\nThe player who doesn’t catch a chair is\nnext to stand in the middle and ask a question.\nIf the player in the middle cannot think of\nany spontaneous questions, he simply shouts\n“Fruit Salad”!\nAnd all the kids get up and change places.\nThe game is fast to set up, fun to play and\nstudents love it because we get to know each\nother better.\nIf you are a teacher, please give it a try\nand tell us how it works for you.\nIf you are a student or parent, ask your teacher\nto give it a try."
