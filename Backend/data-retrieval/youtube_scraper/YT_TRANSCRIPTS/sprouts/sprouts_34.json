    "transcript": "Once upon a time, there was a boy who was \nborn into a family of simple tailors in the  \nmiddle of sub-Saharan Africa. The boy’s father \nwanted him to continue the family business,  \nbut the boy wanted a better life and one night \ndecided to leave his home and go to Europe.\nTo cross the sea the boy built himself \na raft. But once he left the shore,  \nthere was only a little wind and it didn’t \ntake long for his supplies to run out. And  \nthere he was: hungry, and lonely, floating \nin the middle of the mediterranean sea.\nImagine you live on the coast of \nSouthern Europe and one morning,  \nread about the boy's fate in a local \npaper. Should you yourself try to save him?\nFour influential philosophers — Aristotle, Mill, \nKant, and Nietzsche — can help us answer this,  \nand other difficult moral questions \nwith their respective theories."
