    "transcript": "Project-based learning is a pedagogical \napproach that involves students in a long-term,  \nin-depth investigation of a real-world challenge.\nSo instead of memorizing established knowledge or  \nfollowing an instruction that \noffers a fast path to facts,  \nstudents actively work on a problem that allows \nthem to develop several skills simultaneously.\nTo understand the difference, we can look at \nthe experience pupils have in a conventional  \nclass led by Mr. Listen and compare \nthat to what they take away from doing  \na project with Mrs. Do. The objective: \nlearn how to engineer a tall tower.\nIn the conventional class, the students sit \nat their desks and look at the blackboard.  \nMr. Listen first goes over some principles of \nphysics, and then instructs the students that  \nare still able to pay attention, to design \nthe optimal structure for a high tower.\nWhen doing project-based learning, or \nPBL, the students sit in groups. Mrs.  \nDo then gives each group 20 strands \nof uncooked spaghetti, scotch tape,  \na cotton thread, and some marshmallows. \nThen they are told they have 18 minutes  \nto build the highest possible structure \nthat could hold up the spongy confection.\nSo what will the kids in the different classes \nlearn? And what do their minds remember?\nWith Mr. Listen, all kids might \nlearn something about towers,  \na few might learn some engineering and \none could, in theory, learn to construct  \nan ideal tower structure. But, just a week \nlater, most will have forgotten everything.\nMrs. Do’s marshmallow tower challenge \nactivated the kids’ brains in various  \nareas and taught the children something about \nconstruction, creativity, physics, and teamwork.\nMaybe more importantly, they learn that if \nthey fail the first time, they can try again  \nand still succeed. They learn to learn. And even \ndecades later, some might still remember that day.\nThe benefits of project-based learning \ninclude high engagement and a greater  \ndepth of understanding. They practice \ncommunication, critical thinking,  \nand creativity, and as a result, often \nexperience better learning outcomes in general.\nRandomized controlled trials involving \nthousands of students demonstrated that  \nproject-based learning significantly \noutperformed traditional curricula,  \nraising academic performance \nacross academic disciplines.\nThe best teachers often combine projects with \ntraditional instruction or run what's known  \nas active learning classrooms. So that \nstudents get to make sense of trying,  \nfailing, doing, and the theory from the educator.\nWhat are your thoughts about learning through \nprojects? Since education is allegedly not  \nabout what the teacher covers, but what the \nstudents discover, is it the better way to learn?\nIf you found this helpful, check \nout our other videos and subscribe. \nIf you want to support our work, \njoin us on patreon.com/sprouts. \nFor more information and additional \ncontents, visit sproutsschools.com"
