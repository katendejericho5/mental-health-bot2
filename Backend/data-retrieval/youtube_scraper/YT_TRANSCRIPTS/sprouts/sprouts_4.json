    "transcript": "The Kuuk Thaayorre, an aboriginal \ntribe, does not use left or right  \nin their language. Instead, they rely on \ncardinal directions: North, East, South,  \nand West. They might say “Pass me the salt on \nthe South-west of the pepper”. As a result,  \nthey have navigational skills \nsimilar to those of migratory birds.\nThe languages we pick up and use, influence how we \nsee the world, the perception of our surrounding,  \nour sense of time, our memories, our \nbehavior and even our sense of self.\nLanguages are often associated with culture, \nand with the context in which it was learned.\nThose who speak various languages \naccess different parts of themselves.  \nOne study on Spanish-English bilinguals \nshowed that people exhibit different  \npersonality traits when switching \ntheir language. When speaking English,  \nsubjects were more agreeable, but when they \nswitched to Spanish they were more neurotic.\nWith about 7,000 languages all around us, \nnobody knows exactly how they affect our  \nminds. But they certainly frame our thoughts \nand influence the way we look at the world."
