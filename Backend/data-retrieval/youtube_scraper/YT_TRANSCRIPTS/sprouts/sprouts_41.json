    "transcript": "If we show you a random shape, your eyes \nwill send the information to your brain  \nwhich will then decide what to \ndo with it - perhaps not much.\nIf we show you another shape, your \nsenses will again send it to your brain,  \nbut now it might be able to find some related \ninformation that was stored in your memory.\nYou may have forgotten, but when you \nwere young, you knew nothing. The  \nfirst time you saw a particular shape, it was \nmeaningless. Over time and in search for order,  \nyou started to recognize patterns. One day \nsomeone gave that particular thing meaning,  \nyour mind labeled it as important and \ndecided to store it for future use.\nSo next time you see this or that shape, \nyou might want to pause and pay tribute  \nto the fact that there are more connections \nin your brain than stars in the universe,  \nhere to help you organize inputs, thoughts \nand memories to get you through life."
