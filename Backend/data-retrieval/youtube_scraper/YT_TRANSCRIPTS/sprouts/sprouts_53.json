    "transcript": "Ideally parents let their children \nlearn how to help themselves.\nParents who neglect their children or those \nwho are overly involved, achieve the opposite.\nTheir children often learn helplessness \n— and hence believe that they can neither  \ncontrol their life, nor change their environment.\nLearned helplessness was first discovered by  \ntwo researchers who conditioned \ndogs to endure electric shocks.\nMartin Seligman and Steven F. Maier conducted \ntheir experiment with three groups of dogs.\nDogs from the first group were caged and \nmade to wait for a period of time before  \nbeing released. These dogs were \nwhat's known as the control group.\nThe second group were also caged and got electric \nshocks from below. When they pressed a button,  \nthe shocks stopped. They learned \nthat they could stop the pain.\nThe third group of dogs were exposed to the \nshocks, but had no way of stopping them.\nAfter the conditioning, all three groups were  \nput into a box that gave shocks \non one side, but not the other.\nThe first and second group of \ndogs quickly learned to avoid  \nbeing shocked by jumping over the wall \nthat separated the two sides of the box.\nThe third group of dogs made no attempt \nto avoid the shocks -they had developed  \na cognitive expectation that they \ncould not avoid the pain. Seligman  \nand Maier attributed this to learned helplessness.\nChildren can also be affected, as \nthis oversimplified story attests.\nThis is the story of Joe. While \nother kids were allowed to run,  \nthis cute little boy was put in a \nwalker so he couldn't hurt himself.\nAnd so, from early on, Joe learned \nthat the world is a dangerous place.\nOn the rare occasions that his father was home, he \ntold Joe to toughen up, and become a strong boy.\nBut without a role model, Joe \nlacked the motivation to live  \nup to his dad’s expectations. \nHe began to feel inferior.\nOver time this feeling got stronger.\nWhenever there was a problem his \nmother would jump in to help.\nJoe began to internalize the belief that he  \ncouldn’t help himself when \nconfronted with challenges.\nWhenever he had to make a major \ndecision, he’d ask his mom for advice.\nDeep inside he resented her for not \nallowing him to become more independent.\nWhat are your thoughts? How can we help \nthose that fail to see the path out of  \ntheir toxic life? How can we help them \nto help themselves?
