    "video_title": "The 10 Stages of Genocides [Shorts version]",
    "transcript": "When living conditions worsen and the economy \nfails, people try to find reasons for their  \ntroubles. This is when political extremists \ncan become popular as they blame certain  \ngroups of people and promise that by getting \nrid of them societies’ problems will go away.\nExtremists divide people into separate groups \nbased on their different characteristics. This  \noften happens to create an us-vs-them mentality \nor find someone to blame for social problems.\nThis involves assigning symbols or \nnames to members of the other group.  \nThe goal here is to split the society \nand make it clear who belongs to who.\nExtremists now demonize the targeted \ngroup and try to fully divide society  \nby demanding that everyone must take a side.\nThose responsible for the cruelty deny their \ncrimes, destroy evidence, blame the victims,  \nand attempt to rewrite history justifying their \nactions as necessary for the greater good.\nThis is why in the aftermath of genocide, the \ncriminals must be made accountable and the  \ntrauma must be addressed. Then the survivors \nmay heal and society can attempt to reunite."
