    "transcript": "[Music]\nskin in the game is an economic and\nethical principle whereby those who seek\nto gain from their activity should also\nlose when things go wrong\nin other words the idea aims to create\nsymmetry of risk and return\nking hammurabi of babylon already used\nthe principle when he established one of\nhistory's first laws\nto ensure high construction quality\ninside the empire one set of laws was\nfor the builders\nlaw 229 stated that if a builder builds\na house for our client and does not\nconstruct it properly and the house\nwhich he built collapses and causes the\ndeath of the owner that the builder\nshall be put to death\nas a result builders who were not able\nto construct properly or tried to cheat\nleft the trade one way or another\nsoon those who were planning to build a\nhouse had less to worry about\nthe law's harsh consequences and its\nsimplicity made sure that the incentive\nof the builder who gains the profit and\nthe man who risks the cost of\nconstruction living inside the house are\naligned\nnasim teleb who wrote extensively about\nskin in the game argued that having a\nmeasurable risk when making a major\ndecision was necessary for fairness and\ncommercial efficiency he also linked the\nprinciple to learning\n[Music]\nin particular he argued that brains of\nsmart people who work in positions where\nthere are high returns but low risks\ndon't receive the necessary feedback to\nlearn from their mistakes\nover time this will produce inferior\nideas and risk turning smart people into\nidiots intellectuals yet idiots\n[Music]\ntake for example an intelligent ceo\ntoday who leads a public company and\nbuilds huge construction projects using\nother people's money\nunlike a babylonian our constructor sits\ncomfortably in his chair instructing\nthose who actually take the risk\nto protect himself further he hires\nthird party engineers who sign off on\nthe construction plans and have\ninsurance policies to protect them\nagainst any imaginable misfortune\nwhen important clients complain they are\nwelcomed by account executives and if a\nhouse actually collapses our constructor\njust reads about it in an annual report\nbecause the man who lost his family\ninside will only get to see the\nconstructor's legal team\nas a result and over time the\nconstructor becomes disconnected from\nreality stops learning from his mistakes\nand becomes bad at his job\nthe consequences are frustrated\ncustomers and poorly built homes\nto keep learning and achieve excellence\nit is therefore important to work in a\nposition where risk taking is part of\nthe daily routines\nnot only because we get feedback from\npeople who share a risk working with us\nbut also because only if we have a stake\nin the outcome do we give our best\n[Music]\none of the best ways to learn faster\ntherefore is to have a stake in the\noutcome\nto learn how to cook cook for friends to\nlearn about an idea publish a video\nabout it to learn about shares and\ncompanies invest in the stock market\nwith your own money\nalmost 4 000 years after hammurabi the\nbeautiful ruins of the ancient city of\ndara are testimony to the quality of the\nbuilders of babylon but what do you\nthink about the principle are there\nother possible downsides beside the\nhorrendous consequences of law 229\nplease share your thoughts in the\ncomments below to improve the quality of\nyour argument put your skin in the game\nand add your name and where you are from\n[Music]\nthis and all other sprouts videos are\nlicensed under creative commons that\nmeans teachers from all around the world\ncan use them in classrooms online\ncourses or to start projects and today\nthousands already do\nto learn how it works and download this\nvideo without ads or background music\ncheck out our website or read the\ndescription below\nif you want to support our mission and\nhelp change education visit our patreon\nthat's patreon.com\nsprouts"
