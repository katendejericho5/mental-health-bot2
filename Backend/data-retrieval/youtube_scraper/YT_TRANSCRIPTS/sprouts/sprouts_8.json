    "transcript": "Losing something we love, or someone who \nis dear to us, can cause us a lot of pain.  \nTo accept the loss and overcome the pain, \nwe often go through five stages of grief.\nDenial, anger, bargaining, \ndepression, and finally acceptance.\nGetting to acceptance, however, \ndoes not mean it is over.\nGrief is a complex emotional response to loss,  \nparticularly the loss of someone we love \nor something deeply meaningful — like a  \njob. This process is unique to each \nof us and is not always linear.\nOften we cycle back, revisit stages or experience  \nsome entirely new emotions. Sometimes \nit can feel like we are regressing,  \nbut with the support of others and each \nnew day, time will help heal our wounds."
