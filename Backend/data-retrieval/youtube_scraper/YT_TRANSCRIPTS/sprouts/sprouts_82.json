    "transcript": "What if morality is just a fiction  \nused by the herd of inferior human \nbeings to hold back the few superior men?\nIn this Sprouts special with \nStephen Hicks, we examine  \nNietzsche’s explanation for how ethics develop  \nand the consequences for master types living in a \nworld that’s dominated by the morality of a slave.\nPART 3 “MASTER-SLAVE MORALITY and \nthe origin of the bad conscience\nNietzsche argued that there are two \nexplanations for how morality develops.\nPart of the story is bio-psychological — \nin terms of what morality resonates with  \nwhat psychological type of person one is. The \nother part of the story is cultural, because  \ndifferent moral codes develop under different \nsurvival circumstances, and so Nietzsche searches  \nhistory for the survival circumstances that \nnecessitated the development of slave morality\nIn the West, Nietzsche finds the slave \nmorality’s roots in the Judeo-Christian  \ntradition–In a decisive set of events \nthat occurred early in Jewish history–the  \nenslavement of the jews in Egypt. The \nsignificant result of the Jews’ being enslaved \nfor a long time was the development \nand internalization of a moral code  \nsuitable for surviving slavery.\nSuppose that you are a slave: how do you \nsurvive? And if you have children who are  \nborn into slavery, what survival strategies will \nyou teach them? In order to survive, a slave must  \nobey the master. This does not come naturally. So \nthe first lesson is: you must stifle your nature.\nSuppose the master strikes you — the desire  \nfor revenge comes naturally \n— but you have to stifle it.\nSuppose the master tells you \nto wait — being inactive does  \nnot come naturally — but you must \nsuppress your desire for activity.\nSuppose the master tells you \nto do something you do not  \nwant to do — you must override your \ndesire to do what you want and obey.\nGeneralizing, you must train yourself to restrain \nyour natural impulses and to internalize a humble,  \npatient, obedient self. You know you must do \nthis because slaves who do not end up dead.\nConsequently, Nietzsche asserts, slave virtues \nhave survival value: obedience, humility,  \nforgiveness, and patience are good for slaves. \nAnd those are the traits slaves will drill into  \nTheir children if they want them to survive. Over \ntime, the slave virtues become cultural values.\nIn every generation many people are sheep-like \nand do not especially mind being slaves.  \nBut others resent it, and here the \nstory Nietzsche tells becomes darker.\nIn order to survive they must direct \ntheir natural strength and assertiveness  \nagainst the expression of their \nown strength and assertiveness.  \nThis naturally leads them to resent the \nmaster strongly—but they also start to hate  \nthemselves for doing what the master says and \nfor their own role in suppressing themselves.\nPsychologically, hating oneself causes unbearable \npressure inside: because the outward discharge of  \nthe instinct gets inhibited and turns backward \nagainst man himself. Hostility, cruelty,  \njoy in destruction — all this turned \nagainst the possessors of such instincts:  \nthat is the origin of the ‘bad conscience'\nHatred of the strong, self-hatred, \nand revenge fantasies to ease the pain  \nbecome the lived psychological reality \nof such slaves. Make this psychological  \nreality a matter of months and years, and \nthe results will be ugly and poisonous.\nMore provocatively, Nietzsche argues that such \nslave individuals who feel the internal war most  \nstrongly become the social leaders of the slaves \n— that is to say, they become their priests.  \n“It is because of their impotence that in \nthem hatred grows to monstrous proportions.\nIn their leadership role, it is the priests \nwho most strongly advocate meekness, humility,  \nand obedience —and who condemn the \naggressive strength and pride of the masters.  \nThe priests are not in a position to \nuse physical power against the masters.  \nInstead the priests develop and use \nmorality as their weapon of confrontation.\nIn the Judeo-Christian tradition, slave \nmorality becomes part of a revenge strategy. Its \npoint is to enable the weaker \nto survive in a harsh world—but  \nalso to undermine the master type's \nconfidence in themselves and eventually \nbring down the masters so as \nto exact a spiritual revenge.\nSo: Strength, aggression, weakness,  \nresentment. Is morality really about \nus getting along together in the world? \nOr is it really a tool of power, a survival \nstrategy, and a way for the losers to strike  \nback against the successful? Those are the \nhard questions Nietzsche makes us live with.\nTHE END\nWhat are your thoughts on morality? \nDo you agree with Nietzsche? \nFor more information, to reach Stephen \nHicks’s full account of the German philosopher  \nor to download this video without background \nmusic, check the descriptions below."
