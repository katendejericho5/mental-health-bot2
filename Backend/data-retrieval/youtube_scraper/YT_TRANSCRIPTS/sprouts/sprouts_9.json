    "video_title": "Pareto Principle: The 80/20 Rule",
    "transcript": "The Pareto Principle, also known as the \n80/20 rule, states that often 20% of the  \ncauses create around 80% of the outcomes while the \nremaining causes are responsible for the rest. Or,  \nas a simple rule for self-help: 20% of \nyour effort makes up 80% of your success.\nThe principle was discovered by the \nItalian economist Vilfredo Pareto,  \nwho first realized that 20% of the pea pods in his \ngarden were responsible for 80% of all the peas,  \nand then that 80% of all the land in \nItaly was owned by just 20% of its people.\nOver time, the principle became a valuable rule \nof thumb that allows our mind to understand all  \nsorts of complex distributions, focus on the \nessentials, and prioritize what to do next.\nBusiness owners, for example, often realize that \nabout 80% of a company's income comes from just  \n20% of the customers, and as a result, \nknow who to give special attention to.\nConstructors who find out that 20% of the \nhazards result in 80% of the injuries,  \ncan take important precautions to eliminate risks.\nAnd software engineers who know that fixing the \ntop 20% of the most-reported bugs eradicates 80%  \nof errors, can spend their time on these top 20 \nand let the other 80% continue bugging people.\nHowever useful the rule may be, Pareto \nhimself warned against relying too much  \non the principle when he said: “Men follow \ntheir sentiments and their self-interest,  \nbut it pleases them to imagine \nthat they follow reason.\nAnd so they look for and always find some theory \nwhich, a posteriori, makes their actions appear to  \nbe logical. If that theory could be demolished \nscientifically, the only result would be that  \nanother theory would be substituted for \nthe first one, and for the same purpose.”\nWhat do you think of the 80/20 rule? Where \ncan it be applied? And where do we need a more  \nthorough analysis to fully understand what’s \ngoing on? Share your thoughts in the comments  \nbelow! But beware: 20% of the responses \nmight make up 80% of the conversation.\nIf you like this video and want us to make more, \nsubscribe to our channel or support us on Patreon."
