    "transcript": "[Music]\nplay is the highest form of research\neinstein allegedly said today play also\nhappens in video games\nand teachers use them in class or for\nhomework for this video we teamed up\nwith the folks at g2a\nthe world's largest marketplace for\ngames to learn about the three\ndimensions of game design\nfour things games can potentially teach\nus and five video games that are great\nfor learning\none of which is played at harvard\nbusiness school\nfirst the three dimensions of video game\ndesign\ngames typically range from simple to\ncomplex\nthey can be played in a single or\nmultiplayer mode\nand can be played collaboratively or\ncompetitively\nwe can divide games along the spectrum\nof simple to complex\nand non-social to social simple single\nplayer games include puzzles and jump\nand run games like super mario\ncomplex non-social games include the\nshooters like far cry\nor simulations like simcity then there\nare simple multiplayer games\nlike guitar hero or need for speed and\ngames that are complex\nand social such as halo minecraft or\namong us\ngames can be competitive cooperative or\nboth\ncomplex multiplayer games are usually\nmost effective\nfor learning\nnow onto the four things games can teach\nus\nvideo games can increase our cognitive\nabilities boost our motivation\nmake us aware of our emotions and\nstrengthen our social skills\ngames can increase cognition by\nstrengthening particular areas of our\nbrain\none meta-analysis showed that video\ngames effectively teach mental rotation\nabilities\nand that such learning can be\ntransferred to the real world\nlogic and mathematical thinking can also\nbe effectively learned through specific\nvideo games\nshooter games for example often train\nour understanding of relations among\nobjects in space\nbetter than regular high school programs\ngames can boost our motivation and warm\nus up for learning\nfeedback loops that adjust to one's\nabilities keep players within what\nvygotsky called\nthe zone of proximal development and as\nwe learn that we advance through the\nprocess of trying\nfailing and doing we can develop a\ngrowth mindset\nsome of the confidence we gain through\ngames can be transferred to other\naspects of life\nthere are emotional benefits and some\nstudies report a causal relationship\nbetween playing video games and improved\nmood this makes sense\nbeing that according to uses and\ngratification theory\nmost of us seek diverse forms of media\nto manage our mental state\nputting the books aside for a short game\nbreak can therefore enhance our\nemotional state\none study reported that gamers often\nexperience high levels of stress\nand as a result learn to manage their\nemotions\nthere can be social benefits as we form\nnew relationships\nin some games we need to learn who to\ntrust how to communicate\nand when to take the lead video games\nthat are designed to reward cooperation\npromote pro-social skills particularly\nwell\none longitudinal study found that\nchildren who played more pro-social\ngames at the beginning of the school\nyear\nwere more likely to exhibit helpful\nbehaviors later on in the year\nfinally let's look at five games that\ndeliver powerful learning experiences\nremission is a video game that teaches\nsick children how to deal with cancer\nin the game the children control a\nnanobot that shoots cancer cells and\nmanages the side effects of the\ntreatment\na randomized control trial showed that\nchildren who played remission\nsignificantly increased adherence to the\ntreatment protocol and cancer-related\nknowledge\nthe game has since helped hundreds of\nthousands of young patients\nthe game minecraft promotes creativity\ncollaboration\nand problem solving through trial and\nerror players build their own world and\nalongside\napply math and learn about shapes and\ngeometry\nsome do electrical engineering and build\nmachines that run\nin the virtual world and others explore\nhuman history\nits education edition gives teachers\nspecial control\nand access to a wide catalog of lessons\nin democracy players get to know the\nchallenges of being a politician\nthey learn the basics of economics and\ndiscover how policies affect real people\nthey have to deal with difficult issues\nlike immigration\nand unemployment and then still try to\nwin the majority support in the next\nelection\nthe app brain quake allows students to\nlearn math in a playful way\nand without using symbolic language\ncontrolled experiments showed improved\nmath scores by 20\nwhen third graders play the game for\njust 10 minutes per day\nthree days a week for a month the game\nwas developed with the help of the\npopular math teacher\nkeith devlin its education edition\nallows teachers to monitor students\nprogress\nand creativity\nthe so-called harvard root beer game is\na team-based business simulation\nin which players manage a factory a\ndistributor a wholesaler\nor a retailer of root beer at the\nbeginning of the game\nthe root beer isn't popular but then it\nbecomes a big hit\neach player now needs to decide what to\ndo as they examine inventory\nanticipate demand and right orders the\ngame is played at top business schools\nbecause it teaches the importance of\nopen communication\nand teamwork what about you\nwhat do you think about the up and down\nsides of playing video games for\nlearning\nand have you ever learned something in a\nvideo game that was later useful in real\nlife\nif you want to learn more
