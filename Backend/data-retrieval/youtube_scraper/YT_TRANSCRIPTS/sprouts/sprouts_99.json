    "transcript": "there are only a few ideas that had as\nmuch of an\nimpact on education as those of john\ndewey\nto understand his ideas let's imagine\ndewey reappears in the modern world\nwith the mission to implement his\ntheories in a conservative school\ndewey championed learning by doing also\nknown as experiential learning\nhe observed that children learn better\nwhen they are actively engaged\nbecause they are immersed in the present\nand not a distant future\nsuch as final exams in biology\nstudents don't read books but instead\ngrow\nplants harvest fruits and then feed them\nto snails to see what happens\nsometimes things work out sometimes\naccidents happen\nwhatever the outcome the students take\nnotes of their observations\nand form rich memorable experiences\nat the end of each class they summarize\ntheir learning\nand turn to discussions\nthe discussions prepare the students for\nlife in a democratic society where\ndecisions ought to be based on\nreasonable arguments through the debates\nthe children learn to formulate their\nown ideas\nconvince others and learn to see the\nworld from a different point of view\nin one discussion some started to argue\nthat school uniforms\nlimit self-expression and that they\nshould be abolished\ndewey who believe that schools should\nprepare children for life itself\nand serve society as a force for\ninnovation and reform\nencourage those students to start a\npetition\nto find out for themselves if real\nsocial change is possible\nclasses are interactive because dewey\nbelieves that interaction with the\nenvironment\nis essential for the learning process\nsince education is an experience that is\nsubject to constant change\npassive recipients of knowledge on the\nother hand learn\nvery little if anything at all the group\nwho started the petition\npresent their ideas to the teacher and\nstart a dialogue that expands their\nunderstanding\nand underlines their learning\nlearning is interdisciplinary do we\nbelieve that continuity\nis critical to comprehension and that an\ninterdisciplinary education\nallows students to build on what they\nalready know\nwhich strengthens their understanding\nwhat they observed in biology\nis being calculated in math written\nabout in\nenglish and put into images through the\narts\nthis provides the students the\nopportunity to learn how things are\nconnected\nto the brain this process is more\neffective\nbecause it can link new knowledge with\nprevious experiences\nand build stronger mental models\n[Music]\ndo we believe that when societies\ncalculate the price of education\nthey shouldn't only look at the cost of\nschool buildings\nteachers salaries and other resources\nthey should also consider the costs of\nall the hours\ninput by the children because the\nchildren are the future of our society\nand human progress their time in class\nought not to be wasted\nit is thus the school's responsibility\nto be a playground to practice a future\nwe wish to see so when the kids grow up\nthey can go and create it\nabout education dewey famously said\nit's not a preparation for life\neducation is\nlife itself the group that sought dress\ncode reform\ngained a deeper knowledge about the\ntopic and were able to develop\ngood arguments they printed their\ndemands on banners and tracts\nand discussed their ideas with everyone\nuntil the day\nthe majority of students and teachers\nhad signed their petition\neventually the petition was presented to\nthe principal\nand a new school rule was passed\ndewey's ideas were not always popular\nduring his time\nand while we made some progress in\neducation over the last hundred years\nis the situation really any better today\nwhat do you think did you experience\nlearning by doing in your school\nand does your school encourage you and\nyour friends to engage in\nsocial reform and create the future we\nwish to see\nplease share your thoughts in the\ncomments below\n[Music]\nsprouts videos are published under the\ncreative commons license\nthat means our videos are free and\nanyone can download\nedit and play them for personal use and\npublic schools\ngovernments and non-profit organizations\ncan also use them for training\nonline courses or designing new\ncurriculums\nto help us stay independent and support\nour work you can join our patrons and\ncontribute\njust visit patreon.com sprouts even one\ndollar can make a difference\nyou"
