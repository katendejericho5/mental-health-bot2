    "transcript": "today I want to talk about why I stopped\nbeing nice so that I could be kind\nthere's a difference between being nice\nand being kind being nice is centered\naround how other people perceive us what\nthey need from us being kind is about\nbeing within our own Integrity being\nwithin our own boundaries a nice person\nthey can't say no when they're asked to\ndo something even if they want to and\nthey feel extremely guilty if they ever\nneed time or space for themselves a nice\nperson also thinks that it's their role\nto be liked by everyone they have a\nhabit of people pleasing a nice person\nalways worries about what other people\nare thinking and they tend to overe\nexplain themselves all the time a nice\nperson helps or is there for other\npeople even if their health is at risk\nor even if it creates chaos in their own\nlife and they give their time attention\nand energy usually out of fear or out of\nguilt these traits are actually based in\nanxiety when we're always worrying about\nwhat other people think of us what they\nneed from us we're in a state of hyper\nawareness awareness or hypervigilance\nand we end up betraying ourselves and\nour own needs we overstep our limits and\nwe do things being afraid of hurting\npeople disappointing them or letting\nthem down on the other hand a kind\nperson they take the time to see if they\nhave space to do something for someone\nelse and they let others around them\nknow their boundaries so that other\npeople know how to treat them a kind\nperson speaks up when they're\nuncomfortable and they understand that\nthey'll disappoint the people around\nthem and that adults are capable of\nbeing disappointed a kind person is\nthere for other people but not at the\ncost of their health or their mental\nWellness they understand that adults are\nresponsible for their own behavior a\nkind person allows people to face the\nnatural consequences of their actions\nand they give their time energy and\nattention out of a genuine desire to\nconnect or to support kind people know\nand honor their limits they directly\ncommunicate their limits to others which\nallows them to do things from an\nauthentic space understanding that it's\nokay and natural to disappoint others\ntake some time to non-judgmentally\nobserve yourself and your current habits\nso that you too can work on being kind\ninstead of nice when you're nice you\nautomatically say yes to things when\nyou're kind you pause to see if you\nactually have the space to say yes when\nyou're nice you betray yourself to\nplease others when when you're kind you\nhonor your limits and your boundaries\nwhen you're nice you think everyone\nneeds to like you when you're kind you\nknow that it's impossible to please\neveryone around you when you're nice you\nthink that other people are your\nresponsibility and when you're kind you\nknow that you are your own\nresponsibility when you're nice you\nbelieve that feeling guilty means\nautomatically that you've done something\nwrong wrong when you're kind you\nunderstand that it's okay and natural to\nsometimes feel guilty when you're nice\nyou drop everything for everyone no\nmatter what's going on with you when\nyou're kind you practice self-care you\nfactor yourself in and when you're nice\nyou believe that it's a badge of honor\nto put everyone else first when you're\nkind you know that if you continue to\nput everyone else first you'll end up\nbecoming resentful I know that for women\nthis is especially hard because we are\nconditioned to believe that we need to\nput everyone else first that it's the\nselfless thing to do that it means that\nwe're caring individuals we have to\nunderstand that when we do that we\nactually can't be there for other people\nif we want to have healthy relationships\nand to show up for the people around us\nwe have to have limits and we have to\ntake care of ourselves if you're stuck\nbeing a nice person like I was I want to\ngive you an affirmation or Mantra that\nyou can say anytime that you feel guilty\nor you realize that you're doing\nsomething because you don't want to\nupset anyone or disappoint them the\naffirmation is adults are capable of\nbeing\ndisappointed I take care of\nme I don't need to be everything to\neveryone I want to hear from you are you\na nice person or are you a kind person\nor maybe a blend of both leave it in the\ncomments"
