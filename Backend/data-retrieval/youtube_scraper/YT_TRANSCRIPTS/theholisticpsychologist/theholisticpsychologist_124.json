    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about how to\nwork through an emotional trigger you'll\nknow you're triggered when you feel\nyourself emotionally activated it's\noften an intense feeling that comes\nseemingly out of nowhere your muscles\nmight tense maybe your fist clench your\njaw clenches your heart rate might start\nbeating really fast and you find\nyourself overwhelmed with emotion when\nyou're triggered you're actually\nexperiencing a past wound in the present\nmoment so here's a common example that\nsome of you might even be experiencing\nright now you go home\nyour mom makes a comment about how you\nlook you feel anger surging through your\nbody you end up screaming and yelling\nsomething you don't mean then afterward\nyou feel really shameful and you numb\nout by scrolling on social media while\nwe cannot avoid what activates us we can\nlearn how to work through our triggers\nhow to understand them and how to break\nthat habitual reaction so that we can\nshow up more consciously and responsibly\nhere's what a typical unconscious\ntrigger cycle looks like you have your\ntrigger your mom's comment you have your\nemotional reaction all of that anger\nsurging through your body and then the\nscreaming and yelling that you end up\ndoing then you have your unhealthy\ncoping mechanism or your habit that\nperiod of Shame and numbing out on\nsocial media what we want to begin to do\nis to create a new cycle that can look\nlike this there's a conscious trigger\ncycle the trigger happens we can't\ncontrol what mom's saying or doing she\nmakes that same comment in this instance\nwe pause instead of habitually reacting\nwe maybe take a few deep breaths if we\nnotice oursel beginning to activate we\nmight say okay you're having a trigger\nand let yourself feel whatever it is\nthat comes up here you're just going to\nbreathe let all of that Energy race\nthrough your body and instead of\ntypically having that habitual reaction\nlashing out or shutting down you're\ngoing to rewire your response calming\nyour body's nervous system by pausing\nand\nbreathing after that pause you're going\nto to be able to consciously respond or\nmake a new Choice instead of going into\nautopilot you're going to choose how you\nrespond to that trigger so let's go back\nto your mom making that comment about\nhow you look instead of becoming\ndisregulated and saying something\nhurtful that you don't mean or saying\nsomething sarcastic you're going to make\na conscious choice to keep your body\nregulated and then maybe you'll change\nthe subject or ignore the comment and\nnot engage with it at all our triggers\ncan actually help increase our self\nawareness so after you've experienced\none instead of shaming or judging\nyourself take a moment to explore why\nyou got so activated became so\ndisregulated or so upset did you feel\nunseen not considered maybe not good\nenough what did you believe to be true\nin that moment take some time to explore\nthis thinking about it or journaling\nabout it and if you've tuned into this\nyou're ahead of most people because a\nmajority of people don't understand\ntheir triggers at all and it's by\nunderstanding what causes us to become\nemotionally disregulated often saying or\ndoing hurtful things or pushing others\naway that we can become better Partners\nbetter friends and by understanding what\ncauses us to be disregulated emotionally\noften saying or doing hurtful things or\nmaybe pushing others away we can become\nbetter friends better Partners I hope\nthis video is helpful leave a comment\nand let me know if you're working on\nyour own triggers"
