    "transcript": "how did it go well I've been needing\nmore space to myself especially on the\nweekends and I felt like I was being\nguilted to go to my parents house every\nsingle Sunday so this week when my mom\nasked me what time I would be over I\njust told her I couldn't make it and\nwhat did she say she got really upset\nshe asked me what I was doing and I told\nher I just needed a day to fully relax\nto myself then she said I could relax\nthere I got really disregulated and I\ntold her I had to go I had so much\nanxiety like I did something wrong well\nI'm proud of you for telling her the\ntruth and letting her know what you\nneeded how long were you anxious for\nactually not that long but then when she\nmessaged me this Sunday morning telling\nme that I really needed to come over I\nfelt even more anxious what can I say to\nhave her stop guilting me here's the\nthing we all want that magical thing to\nsay to stop someone from doing something\nbut the thing is people are going to do\nwhat they've always done this is your\nmom's pattern she's very used to using\nGilt and not truly listening to your\nneeds I know it's hurtful but we have to\nacknowledge that she may never change\nand she doesn't have to you can still\nassert your needs and take a day to\nyourself even if you feel bad"
