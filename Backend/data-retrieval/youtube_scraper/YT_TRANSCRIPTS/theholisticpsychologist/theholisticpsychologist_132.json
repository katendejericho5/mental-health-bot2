    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about glimmers\nmost of you have probably heard about or\nexperienced a trigger a present moment\nwhere we relive a past emotional\nexperience usually having a huge\nreaction a glimmer can be thought of as\nthe opposite of a trigger it's a moment\nwhere you feel calm grounded peaceful\neven content a trigger is a stimulus\nthat activates disregulation in our\nnervous system or our sympathetic fight\nORF flight response a glimmer is a\nstimulus that activates regulation or\nour parasympathetic nervous system or\nsafe and social response some examples\nof glimmers might be spending a special\nmoment with someone you love or just\nfeeling the sun on your skin when you're\noutside or maybe being in a of\nnature possibly having a stimulating\nconversation with someone or a kind\ninteraction with a stranger even reading\nyour favorite book glimmers activate our\nvental vagal nervous system this causes\nchanges in our body it lowers our blood\npressure and even the stress hormone\ncortisol and it causes emotional changes\nwhich include feeling safer more secure\nincreasing our feelings of belonging and\nacceptance increasing our ability to\nfeel joyful to laugh to be light-hearted\nand even increases our Mobility or\nmotivation it gives us the energy and\nability to try new things for many of us\nhelping us become unstuck Neuroscience\nactually shows us that we can teach our\nbody to notice and experience more\nglimmers through repetition our body can\nbecome more and more aware of and\ncomfortable embodying the Safety and\nSecurity that they offer you have to\npractice teaching your body how to feel\nsafer and becoming more aware of\nglimmers when they're available then\nyou'll experience more glimmers so how\ndo you do that one you soak them in\ngratitude is a key to having more\nglimmers being conscious or simply\npresent to what is a awakens us to the\ndifferent daily life experiences that\nmany of us just let us pass by so for\nexample when you see the next Sunset\npractice taking a deep breath\nacknowledging it and thanking nature of\nthe universe for the experience itself\ntwo you can practice inner sensing which\nsimply means feeling the sensations in\nyour body noticing your body at ease\nyour shoulders roll down your back your\nmuscles feeling relaxed the Sun or the\nbreeze on your skin\nthe more you practice feeling at ease in\nyour body the safer your body will feel\nto regularly be at ease three plan one\nunplugged moment every single day this\ncan be any moment where you allow\nyourself to be fully present in your\nbody my daily unplugged moment is\nsitting out in the sun for even just 10\nminutes with no headphones on listening\nto the birds fully present to the sun on\nmy skin to the breeze on my body and\naware of everything around me the key\nreally is to just practice so many of us\nhave to teach our body to notice and to\nsavor these safe moments so begin to\nnotice or ask yourself where you feel\nmost at peace or most at ease and then\nmaking sure you consciously plan time to\nhave more of those moments especially if\nyou're having a stressful day or a\nstressful week I hope this video is\nhelpful and I hope many of you begin to\nnotice more glimmers in your day I'd\nlove to hear what your last glimmer was\nin the comments below"
