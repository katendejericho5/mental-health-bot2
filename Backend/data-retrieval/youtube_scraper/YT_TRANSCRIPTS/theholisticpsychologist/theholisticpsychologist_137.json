    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about the\nscapegoat the scapegoat is the child\nthat gets the Wrath of the emotionally\nimmature parent they're often on the\nreceiving end of invalidation being told\nto stop being dramatic or it's not that\nbig of a deal gaslighting or they're\nmade to question their perspectives or\nthey entire reality the silent treatment\nor they're not spoken to or they're\nignored completely or rage erratic and\nexplosive behaviors they are the ones\nwho are blamed for everything so they\nfeel like they're walking on eggshells\nalways in fear of the next time that\nthey're going to get in trouble or get\nblamed for something they didn't do or\nsomething that they didn't cause usually\nthe child that's picked to be the\nscapegoat is highly sensitive they have\na lot of feelings they're artistic or\ncreative they want to express themselves\nin that way they're not super compliant\nwhich means that they question things or\nthey act outside of the box they saw\ntheir siblings getting treated better or\nbeing favored they're being punished and\ntheir siblings aren't they're mocked or\nmade fun of they're teased sometimes for\nbeing the one who's always getting in\ntrouble or they're criticized for being\ndifferent for acting outside of the box\nso why do parents scapegoat they\nscapegoat because they're emotionally\nimmature emotionally immature parents\ncreate dysfunctional family roles the\nscapegoat being one of them they are\nparents who cannot handle their own\nemotions so they blame other people the\nworld around them you caus me to feel\nthis\nway they believe that their children\nshould cater to themselves to their\nneeds this makes sense right if you're\ncausing me to feel some kind of way stop\ndoing that cater to\nme they can't self-reflect or they\nexternalize they project everything\noutward the world is happening to them\ntheir children include it they feel very\ninsecure and inadequate and they project\nthat onto their child the scapegoat\nfeels insecure inadequate because\nthey're being criticized or yelled at\nall of the time the adult impact of\nbeing a scapegoat in childhood is\ncptsd or ongoing relational trauma that\nleads to helplessness dissociation and\nrelationship\ndiscontent another impact is anxiety\nalways feeling agitated always feeling\non edge next depression feeling low\nemotions no motivation even\nhopelessness another one is chronic\nself-doubt you lack confidence about who\nyou are and your abilities in childhood\nyou weren't allowed to express those\naspects of yourself it leads to people\npleasing you put everyone else in their\nneeds above your own just like you had\nto do in childhood with your parents\nanother impact is selfesteem issues you\nfeel unworthy and unlovable because\nthat's how you felt in your childhood it\nleads to\nprocrastination you feel unmotivated\nunable to do the things that you even\nwant to do because in childh Hood it was\nkind of like why bother you're always in\ntrouble it leads to denying your own\nreality just like your reality was\ndenied by your parents it can lead to\nnegative coping habits addictive or\nimpulsive behaviors the way you're\ntrying to navigate all of those\noverwhelming feelings and it can lead to\ninvalidating Partners or simply choosing\nfriends and partners who reinforce the\nsame patterns that happen in your\nrelationship with your parents so how do\nyou heal you heal\nby realizing that your parents were\nemotionally immature your family system\nwas dysfunctional and while you can\nchange them and they're not your\nresponsibility you can change the way\nyou show up in your relationships you\nheal by understanding that you did not\ndeserve the treatment that you got your\nparents were looking for someone else a\nchild to blame rather than taking\nresponsibilities for themselves and\ntheir own\nactions you heal by getting angry anger\nis a completely appropriate response to\nbeing abused to being shamed and to be\nmistreated in childhood the way that you\nwere you heal by understanding that\nwalking on eggshells is not normal in\nany relationship in healthy\nrelationships you're able to share your\nperspectives your feelings your wants\nyour needs and to get\nsupport you heal by setting boundaries\nfor yourself because you're highly\nempathetic you have a lot of feelings\nsometimes you end up serving others at\nthe expense of your own wants and needs\nand if you find yourself in neglectful\nor abusive relationships you might need\nto go limited contact or no contact for\nshort or long periods of time so that\nyou can protect yourself so that you can\nbegin to meet your own needs you heal by\nlearning and knowing your true gifts\nyou've always been enough and the\ntreatment that you experien reflected\nyour parents insecurity their own issues\nand was not a reflection of who you\nreally are and you heal by finding your\ntrue path outside of those dysfunctional\nDynamics outside of the role that you\nwere made to play you find your own way\ndrop a comment if you were the scapegoat\nin your family I'd love to hear how it\nwas for you being the scapegoat is\nreally difficult it's really hurtful and\nyou can reconnect with who you really\nare outside of the role that you've had\nto play"
