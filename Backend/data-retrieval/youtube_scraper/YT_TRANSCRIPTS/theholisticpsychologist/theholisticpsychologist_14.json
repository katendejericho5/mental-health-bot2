    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about denial\nwe're going to explore how it holds us\nback and of course how we can get out of\nthis pattern to begin to make positive\nchange in our lives denial is really one\nof the most powerful coping mechanisms\nthat us humans have if you think about\nit denial serves a purpose because it\nhelps us avoid our pain if we don't\nacknowledge our pain then we don't\nactually have to feel our pain the\ndownside of course is that denial ends\nup holding us back from actually facing\nour issues so that we can fully heal in\nDysfunctional Family systems denial is\noften what keeps the family together\nthere's this tiptoeing around issues or\na feeling of secrecy because no one\nreally wants to talk about what's\nactually happening although it's\ndysfunctional this helps keep the family\ntogether in a way because no one really\nhas to change or confront any issues so\nhere are some signs that you or your\nfamily might be coping with denial\nthe first sign issues or problems are\nnot openly discussed they're there of\ncourse but they're swept under the rug\nignored avoid it entirely another sign\nyou regularly heard and may even now say\nyourself things like it could be worse\nwhile shrugging off your very real\nupset another sign is Extreme\ndefensiveness or even shutting down when\nissues are problems are actually\naddressed or when they're brought to you\nanother sign is avoidance or suppression\nignoring most if not all of our emotions\nsometimes in families one emotion is\nokay like sadness like anxiety while all\nof the other emotions are swept under\nthe rug though in other families all\nemotions are suppressed or avoided at\nall cost and the final sign is enable in\nDysfunctional habits like substance use\ngambling or other destructive spending\nhabits or other irresponsible behaviors\nwhen we are enabling someone else's\ndysfunctional habits or even our own is\na sign that there may be denial\nhappening so if you are resonating with\nthese signs I'm now going to give you\nsome prompts that you can ask yourself\nso that you can begin your journey of\nbreaking this habit you might want to\ngrabb a notebook and a pen and a pencil\nwrite these questions down so you can\ntake some time to sit with yourself to\nthink about and to journal your own\nanswers to these questions I'll make\nsure to also put these questions in the\ndescription so that you have them all\nfor your own\nexploration the first question you want\nto ask yourself and explore is who are\nthe people in my life that are causing\nme hurt or pain that I don't set\nboundaries with around this\nBehavior the second\nquestion what are the behaviors I\ncurrently take part in that are causing\nmy own hurt or my own pain and what are\nthose\nbehaviors the third\nquestion when do I struggle to be honest\nwith myself about something destructive\nthat I'm doing in my own life and what\ndestructive things am I\ndoing the fourth\nquestion what are the painful\nexperiences or\nsituations that I refuse to think about\nor to talk about and why the fifth\nquestion how am I spending my downtime\nmost of the time and does this help me\nget closer to my goals or farther away\nfrom\nthem and what steps can I take now to\nget a little bit closer to my\ngoals and finally the sixth\nquestion what part were parts of my life\nam I avoiding right now that are causing\nme more issues and more\nproblems take some time to think about\nand to write out your answers being as\nhonest and transparent as you can be I\nknow some of these questions and answers\nmight get you feeling uncomfortable and\nthat's okay a lot of the time it's that\ndiscomfort that allows us the\npossibility to actually create the\nchange that we need unlike denial which\nonly Keeps Us comfortable while keeping\nour behaviors or habits exactly the same\nI love to hear from you listening are\nyou in denial leave your experience in\nthe comments below"
