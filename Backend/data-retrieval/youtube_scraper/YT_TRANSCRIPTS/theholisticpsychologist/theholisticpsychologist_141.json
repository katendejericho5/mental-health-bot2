    "transcript": "oh just get over it how come you never\napologize when you hurt my feelings\nyou're a child why would I apologize to\na child because I'm also a human being\nand when you hurt someone it's important\nto apologize and repair after the\nsituation honey repair is for household\nappliances so how do you think I'll be\naccountable in my own relationships what\nwell accountability is apologizing and\nunderstanding how we impact people\naround us and I'm not learning that\nhere sometimes you'll yell at me or say\nsomething really hurt and then a little\nbit later you'll act like nothing\nhappened so I'm just wondering how do I\nlearn to not be that way oh I guess I'm\nthe worst mother ever see that's another\nexample of a lack of accountability to\nbe accountable we need to stop being\ndefensive and listen to how other people\nexperience us this is how we build trust\nand show people we care instead you're\njust dismissing me"
