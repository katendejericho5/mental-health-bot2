    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about\nemotionally immature parents first what\ndoes it mean to be emotionally immature\npeople who are emotionally immature have\nthese traits they're highly defensive\nand emotionally reactive they blame\nother people for what they feel and they\nrarely look inwards or self-reflect they\nfeel very upset if people don't see\ntheir point of view and tend to\ninvalidate them they can be highly\ncontrolling of other people and they\nstruggle with taking accountability for\ntheir behavior so here are some signs\nyou were raised by an emotionally\nimmature parent one your parent was\nhighly emotionally reactive parents who\ncan't regulate emotionally really\nstruggle with stress they have something\ncalled a low frustration tolerance and\nthis means that even small\ninconveniences or issues become a really\nbig deal and they might have intense\nshifts in emotions seemingly out of\nnowhere high reactivity might look like\nwatching your parent have emotional\nOutburst break breaking down emotionally\ncrying or watching them throw a temper\ntantrum when things don't get was\nplanned yelling screaming it might look\nlike being threatened or punished when\nyou felt an emotion or having\nunpredictable responses which means you\nnever knew how a parent was going to\nreact it can also look like giving the\nsilent treatment or something or\nanything cause the parent to pretend\nthat you don't exist at all and what\nthis teaches us is that it's not safe\nfor us to feel or express our emotions\nit creates hyper vigilance where we're\non edge always looking for cues and\ntrying to guess how our parent is going\nto react sign number\ntwo your parent was emotionally\nunavailable emotionally immature parents\nare usually emotionally unavailable this\nmeans that they invalidate their\nchildren and their emotions an example\nof this is when you went up to your\nparent growing up to tell them that you\nwere upset and they told you it's not a\nbig deal or it could have been worse\nmaybe they even told you that you were\nbeing too sensitive or too dramatic what\nthis really is is the parent feeling\nuncomfortable around your emotions so\nthey dismiss your emotions to try to\nmake their own discomfort go away\nemotionally unavailable parents they\nmight also expect their child to raise\nthemsel leave them alone feed themselves\nthey might avoid communication\naltogether they might never show\naffection or talk about any emotions\nthey might be dismissive about their\nchildren's interests or their\npreferences not care they might only\ninteract with their child when being\ncritical or they might punish or shame\ntheir child anytime that they're upset\nwhat this teaches us is that our\nemotions are something to repress or to\nfeel ashamed of and this creates a\npattern when we're adults where we feel\ninsecure or anxious expressing oursel\nemotionally sign number\nthree all of the focus was on them\nemotionally immature parents are\nextremely self-focused they don't really\nhave the capacity that a mature person\nhas to step outside of themselves and\ntheir own perspective to see how things\nimpact their children or other people so\nfrom a young age you start to learn that\nyour needs don't matter that it's your\nsubconscious role to take care of your\nparent and their needs self-focus can\nlook like expecting a child to never\nupset a parent blaming a child for the\nparents actions by saying look what you\nmade me do it can look like emotional\ndumping on the child telling the child\nhow difficult they are and all of the\nsacrifices they made for them what this\nteaches us is that we need to reject our\nown needs to keep the connection with\nour parents when your first relationship\nwith a parent is one where your needs\naren't getting met and all of the focus\nis on your parent you start to believe\nthat you're not worthy of being loved of\nbeing taken care of that your thoughts\nand opinions that they don't matter this\nis how people pleasing starts because\nyou learn to cater to everyone else's\nfeelings while at the same time ignoring\nyour own sign number four\nthey were obsessed with appearance\nemotionally immature parents are really\nfocused on how they look as a parent and\nhow the family measures up but there is\nlittle or no focus on how people\nactually feel you might have seen that\nyour parent was one type of person in\nthe home and a completely different\nperson in public maybe you even heard\nthem praising you or bragging about you\nto friends but they never said any of it\nto you directly and were probably\nactually critical toward you or maybe\nthey had you keeping secrets or asked\nyou to hide certain things to manage how\nyou look to other people or to those\naround you your parent wasn't really\nconcerned with your inner emotional\nworld but they were highly concerned\nwith how people viewed you and with how\nthey looked as a parent what this\nteaches us is that deception secrets and\nappearance are a normal part of life and\nthat our focus should be on what we look\nlike not how our life actually feels if\nyou resonate with this episode You are\nnot alone it's actually really common to\nhave emotionally immature parents my\nnext episode is on what you can do if\nyou have emotionally immature parents so\nmake sure you subscribe also I want to\nhear from you in the comments which sign\ndo you resonate with the most"
