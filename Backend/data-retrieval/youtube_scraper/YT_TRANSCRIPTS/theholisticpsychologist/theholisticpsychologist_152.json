    "transcript": "do you want to feel more confident have\nmore connected relationships and feel\nthat you can trust the people around you\ntoday I'm going to talk about how to\ncreate a more secure attachment style if\nyou want to go back over my last\nepisodes I go over all of the attachment\nStyles including secure attachment we\nknow that secure attachment is developed\nwhen caregivers are attuned responsive\nand predictable when we're raised by\npeople who are able to regulate their\nemotions elves they give us the ability\nto express ourselves and fully be who we\nare the reality is a lot of us just\ndon't get this we were raised by\ndistracted overwhelmed stressed parents\nwho might have been unhappy in their\nmarriages carrying their own unresolved\ntraumas or who were distant and cold so\nwe never got the chance to develop a\nsecure attachment or the ability to\ntrust that people are going to fully be\nthere for us the best part about\nattachment Styles is that they're fluid\nthis means that our attachment Styles\ncan change and develop over time we all\nhave an attachment style but that\nattachment style is not set in stone I\npersonally have an anxious avoidant or\ndisorganized attachment style and I've\ndone a lot of work around creating a\nmore aure attachment all of us can\nreally do this if we commit to it and\nshow ourselves a lot of compassion along\nthe way our attachment style is created\nwhen we're children based on the\nrelationships we have with our parents\nbecause our survival depended on them\nnow as adults our survival depends on us\nand we have the unique opportunity to\nbecome the loving parent that we didn't\nget we can give ourselves the things\nthat we really needed in our own\nchildhood and in the process we can\ndevelop a more secure\nattachment here are the four steps to\ndevelop a more secure attachment style\nstep one make and keep one small promise\nto yourself in order to build a secure\nattachment you'll have to learn how to\nbe secure with yourself and how to trust\nyour own word a lot of us including\nmyself have learned to betray ourselves\nto please or calm others or to neglect\nour own needs in order to keep others\nHappy by keeping a small promise to\nourselves we can rebuild our own self\nTrust TR and confidence here is how you\ncan create a small promise with yourself\nfirst I really want to emphasize small\nwhen we create these really huge\npromises to ourselves we're just not\nsustainable I'm sure you're thinking of\na time where you promise yourself to\nmake a lot of changes at once and when\nyou couldn't follow through what\nhappened you felt even worse about\nyourself so the small promise is going\nto be something that is under 10 minutes\na day something that you know you can do\nevery single day\nsome examples journal for 5 minutes take\na 10-minute walk do 8 minutes of\nstretching or yoga meditate for 5\nminutes or make one quick nutrient-dense\nhome-cooked meal every day you want to\npick one small promise to do every day\nthen set a reminder on your phone or\nsomewhere where you'll say it I suggest\ndoing this first thing in the morning or\nright before bed you're going to keep\nthis promise to yourself every day for\n30 days then add another promise\nnow I know this sounds like a small step\nbut those baby steps really do create\nlasting transformation and the act of\nactually following through with your own\nword is going to teach you that you can\ntrust yourself I even have a new\nrelationship future self journal that\nyou can download to get started I'm\ngoing to put the link in the description\nit's completely free it takes about 5\nminutes to fill out each day and it's a\ngreat way to start this practice moving\non to step two do things you love or our\npassionate about with no outcome all of\nus have talents skills and Gifts some of\nus never really got the chance to\ndevelop them because we're always doing\nthings for a specific outcome maybe\nwe're overachievers or perfectionists\nand never got the opportunity to just do\nthings because we like them a big part\nof developing a more secure attachment\nis to actually connect with ourselves\nnot with what people want for us not\ndoing things to get approval or\nvalidation but instead really connecting\nback back to our spiritual self that\ninner knowing of what we love some\nexamples of this can be drawing painting\nbuilding something gardening revisiting\nan old hobby learning about a new\nsubject that you really love or going to\na bookstore to spend some time reading\nthere are a lot of options and the most\nimportant part in this step is to try to\navoid having any expectation or outcome\nthis is really just time for you your\nown enjoyment and your own inner\nconnection maybe schedule a Saturday\nafternoon for this or an hour midday to\nconsciously spend time nourishing your\nown Curiosities and interest step three\nget out of your comfort zone our\nattachment style is\nneurobiological this means that the way\nwe learn to attach growing up is quite\nliterally hardwired into our mind and\nbody because of this we have patterns or\nways of relating and existing that we've\npracticed subconsciously our entire\nlives in order to create new patterns we\nhave to get out of our familiar a aut\npilot way of being so again we want to\ntake small steps to get out of our\ncomfort zone this is how we learn about\nwho we really are and reconnect with our\nauthentic self some examples of getting\nout of your comfort zone can be joining\na new club or membership this can be\nonline or in real life trying a new food\nor restaurant starting a conversation\nwith a stranger taking yourself out on a\nsolo date going on a hike somewhere\nyou've never been to before or inviting\na friend to try something new\nthese steps out of your comfort zone are\ngoing to build your selfworth helping\nyou create a more secure attachment when\nyou do these things you'll be able to\nfeel proud of yourself learning that\nyou're much more resilient and capable\nthan you think you are step four express\nyourself a big part of secure attachment\nis being able to express yourself and\nhow you feel self-expression can be\nreally tough when we haven't learned to\nsay what we feel or when we were raised\nin homes that didn't really allow us to\nfully express ourselves when we tried\nsome of us may have gotten the silent\ntreatment punished or even yelled at in\norder to develop a more secure\nattachment we have to start to practice\nexpressing ourselves I'm going to warn\nyou this might feel overwhelming and\nscary at first especially if you have\nmore of an avoidant attachment style\nwhere you shut down or oppress how you\nfeel it's okay if this feels\nuncomfortable and remember getting out\nof that comfort zone is really important\nif we want to heal from insecure\nattachment Styles keep in mind that just\nlike how your attachment style was\ncreated over a period of time it takes\ntime for you to take these steps and\nnotice changes you want to be patient\nwith yourself along the way and begin to\nnotice the small shifts as you continue\nto practice showing up for yourself I\nwant to hear from you are you working on\na more secure attachment style tell me\nwhat you're doing and learning in the\ncomments"
