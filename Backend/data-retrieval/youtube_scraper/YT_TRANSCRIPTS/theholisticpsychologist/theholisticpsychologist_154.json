    "transcript": "do you feel comfortable in relationships\ntrusting that people care about you and\nwon't betray you in some way you\nprobably have a secure attachment style\nso let's first talk about what secure\nattachment is secure attachment is\ndeveloped when caregivers are attuned\nresponsive and predictable being attuned\nmeans being aware and connected to the\nemotional state of another so for\nexample you're feeling really\noverwhelmed and your parents acknowledge\nyou're feeling this way being responsive\nmeans doing things to show you're\nattuned to the emotional state of\nanother if you're overwhelmed they're\ngoing to notice it and ask you about how\nyou're feeling and the important part is\nwhen you talk about what you think or\nwhat you feel your feelings are going to\nbe understood and validated they're not\ngoing to be dismissed or invalidated you\ngenerally have the consistent presence\nof a patient and calming person who is\nable to offer support or soothing when\nneeded this environment teaches us that\nit's safe to have emotions and that\nthere are healthy ways to deal with\nthese emotions overall developing secure\nattachment comes from growing up in a\nhome where the caregivers are\npredictable they do what they say\nthey're going to do and over time we\ndevelop this knowing that we can trust\npeople to love support and take care of\nus adults who develop secure attachment\nare able to emotionally regulate have\nhealthy relationships have much lower\nrates of addiction or self-destructive\nbehaviors and have higher levels of\nconfidence in self-worth this self-worth\ncomes because they've been taught how to\ncope with life they have had\nrelationships that provided Safety and\nSecurity to support them through the\nstress of living people with secure\nattachment are comfortable setting\nboundar IES they know one to walk away\nfrom situations that are unhealthy an\neasy way to think about people with\nsecure attachment is that they know what\nis Theirs to deal with and what is\nsomeone else's to deal with this is\ndifferent from insecure attachment\nStyles where there's a lot of enabling\ncaretaking and\ncodependency when someone has a secure\nattachment style they don't really\nengage in those behaviors because they\ndon't feel overly responsible for other\nadults and they don't believe that their\nrole in relationships is to Pease or\nplease others they come into\nrelationships as a whole being able to\ncontribute and act as an equal partner\nso here are some signs of a secure\nattachment one overall trust in\nrelationships they have a comfort and\nTrust in relationships or a general\nbelief that people love them and want to\nbe in relationships with them they will\nbe there to support them they tend to\nattract friends and partners who are\nemotionally stable transparent and\ntrustworthy two they're able to navigate\nconflict in Conflict they can\nself-regulate are able to be empathetic\nand find Solutions while they may shut\ndown or become reactive for short\nperiods overall they're not going to\nhave intense fights or chaotic\nexperiences they're going to be able to\nstay in their body and to stay connected\nto the other person three they're able\nto emotionally Express they're able to\ncommunicate clearly what they actually\nfeel be vulnerable and are comfortable\nhaving a emotions and difficult\nconversations four they're able to\nattune to others they can attune to how\nother people feel have empathy for other\npeople's experiences and hold space even\nwhen they don't necessarily agree with\nthem or share the same reality a core\ntrait with people with secure attachment\nis they are not hypervigilant always\nlooking for clues about how other people\nare feeling or what they're thinking\nthey have been shown that it's safe to\ntrust that people will come to them when\nthere are issues unlike those with\ninsecure attachment Styles where where\nthey learned that they have to become\nmind readers or pull things out of\npeople five they can set boundaries\nthey're comfortable setting boundaries\nand they don't feel a sense of dread or\nguilt around setting them they know that\nhealthy people respect boundaries and\nfeel pretty comfortable saying no or\nletting people know when they've crossed\nthe limit now I want you to keep in mind\nsecure attachment is a spectrum\nso you might not feel all of these\nthings all of the time but a majority of\nthe time you feel like you're in\nrelationships where you're valued heard\nknowing that if you need support you can\nask for it if you're listening to this\nthinking to yourself this isn't me at\nall that's okay secure attachment is\nactually not that common because many of\nus didn't grow up with ATT tuned and\nresponsive caregivers who really\nunderstood their own emotional states\nall of us can heal and create a more\nsecure attachment the next episode in\nthis series is going to be about how we\ncan move from insecure attachment styles\nto more secure attachments I'm going to\nshow you some tools and practices that\nyou can use to develop that feeling of\nsecurity in all of your relationships\nincluding your relationship with\nyourself if you resonate with secure\nattachment I want to hear from
