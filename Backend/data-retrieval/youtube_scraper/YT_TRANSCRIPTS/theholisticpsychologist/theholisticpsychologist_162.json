    "transcript": "Dr. Nicole LePera: Do you have a\nconstant fear of abandonment and\nrelationships? Today, I'm going\nto talk about anxious attachment\nstyle. Anxious attachment style\nis formed when we're raised in\nhomes with unpredictable,\nunreliable, inconsistent, or an\nattuned parents. So what does\nthat mean? It can look like\nhaving a parent that is really\nkind and loving one minute, then\nthe next minute, they're shut\ndown, giving the silent\ntreatment or they're yelling and\nscreaming. Another example is\nhaving a parent who's really\ninvolved in your life for\nperiods of time, and then is\nless involved or checked out\nentirely for other periods of\ntime, like when they're\nstruggling emotionally or\nfinancially navigating their own\nhealth issue, or getting into a\nnew relationship. This\ninconsistency leaves a child\nfeeling uncertain whether their\nneeds will be met, and not\nknowing what to expect from the\npeople that they love. It also\nleaves them feeling starved for\nemotional connection. The core\nneed and someone with anxious\nattachment is to feel\nconsistently close and\nconnected, a need that was unmet\nin their childhood. They\ncontinue to search for this\nclose connection. In order to\nfeel safe and secure. Any sign\nof distance or disconnection\nwill be perceived as rejection\nand will cause their nervous\nsystem to go into fight or\nflight. Here are some signs of\nanxious attachment. Chronic\nemotional neediness, you have so\nmany emotional needs, but you\ndon't know how to get them met.\nAnd you never feel like people\nin your life are meeting that.\nAnother sign a constant need for\nattention. You can be clingy or\npossessive, and always feel like\nyou need to be the focus of\nattention in order to feel\nsecure in your relationships.\nAnother sign is extreme\njealousy. You constantly fear\nabandonment or being left by\nothers. Another sign is lack of\ntrust. Because of your\ninconsistent care in childhood,\nyou can't trust that people will\nbe there for you. Here are some\ncore triggers in relationships\nfor people with anxious\nattachment. Someone being\nunresponsive, they're not\ntexting you back or not calling\nyou back. Another trigger is\nunpredictability, a partner or a\nloved one taking on new\nbehaviors or trying new things.\nAnother trigger is any need for\nspace, a partner or a loved one\nasking for space even for short\nperiods of time. Having an\nanxious attachment style can\nfeel like being on an emotional\nroller coaster. It can be really\nexhausting and draining, because\nyou're always subconsciously\nlooking for signs that you'll be\nhurt or abandoned. subscribe so\nthat you can learn more about\nthe other attachment styles and\nlearn how to develop a more\nsecure relationship. If you\nresonate with anxious\nattachment, leave it in the\ncomments. I'd love to hear how\nit shows up in your\nrelationships."
