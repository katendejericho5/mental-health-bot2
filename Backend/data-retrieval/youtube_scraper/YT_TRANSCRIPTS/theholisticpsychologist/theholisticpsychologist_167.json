    "transcript": "Here are three signs of complex\ntrauma that aren't really talked\nabout. complex trauma is trauma\nthat happens in childhood. It's\nongoing, and it usually occurs\nwithin our relationships. Because\nit's not extreme abuse or neglect,\nwe end up thinking that what\nhappened was normal. And it's not\nuntil adulthood that we realized\nthat some of these patterns were\ndysfunctional. So what are three\nsigns of complex trauma, or C PTSD,\nthese are actually common\nadaptations to insecure unsafe\nchildhood relationships or\nenvironments. One, chronic\ndissociation, this is where you're\nphysically present. But mentally\nand emotionally, you're gone. I\ncall it living on your spaceship.\nIf you're around adults who\ncouldn't regulate their own\nemotions, or if you were left\nalone, physically, or emotionally,\nyou learn that you have to fend for\nyourself. So disconnecting is the\nonly way that you can deal with\nthose overwhelming emotions. If the\npresent moment isn't ever safe. If\nyour body isn't ever safe, you end\nup dissociating or disconnecting as\na way to protect yourself to\nhopelessness. This is when you feel\nnumb, attached, you lack\nmotivation, you end up thinking,\nwhat's the point? Why bother, or\ngenerally you feel disconnected\nfrom life. These are actually signs\nthat your nervous system is shut\ndown. When you have parents who\nhave explosive arguments, or\ndisconnected or distracted\nentirely, or if the environment you\ngrew up in was stressful or\nchaotic. You learned that adults\ncan't be trusted to keep you safe.\nThe safest thing that you can do as\na child is to shut down, accepting\nthat you don't have any power and\ngiving up any hope for the\nsituation to change. So of course,\nyou end up feeling hopeless. Three,\nrelationship discontent. This is\nfeelings of overall confusion or\noverwhelm in relationships. You\nmight go from feeling smothered in\nyour relationships, anxious all the\ntime, or maybe some moments you\nfeel super committed. And in other\nmoments, you question the\nrelationship entirely. You find\nyourself looking around and other\npeople in relationships who seem at\nease who seem comfortable, and this\ndoesn't happen for you. So you end\nup worrying that it means that\nsomething's wrong with you. What it\nreally means is that relationships\ndon't feel safe or secure. And if\nrelationships don't feel safe or\nsecure, of course, you end up\nstruggling with connection. If this\nis you know that this is very\ncommon if you're beating yourself\nup, or if you're feeling shameful.\nThese are actually signs of complex\ntrauma. They're pointing you in the\ndirection of places that you can\nheal. If this is you. I'd love to\nhear your situation in the comments\nbelow. And if you find this content\nhelpful, hit subscribe.
