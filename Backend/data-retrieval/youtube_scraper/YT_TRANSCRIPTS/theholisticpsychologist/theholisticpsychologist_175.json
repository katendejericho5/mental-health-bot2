    "transcript": "foreign\nDr Thomas hubel is a renowned teacher\nauthor and international facilitator who\nworks within the complexity of systems\nand cultural change by integrating\nmodern science with the insights of\nHumanity's wisdom Traditions he is the\nauthor of Healing Collective trauma a\nbook that greatly impacted me and his\nlatest book attuned he's here to have a\nchat with me about that now so like I\nwas sharing with you Thomas before we\nhit record and got started I've been\nsuch a fan of your work for so long so\nhaving this opportunity not only to be\nable to take a sneak peek of your newest\nbook a tune but also now to have you in\nconversation I'm just so very grateful\nfor so thank you for sharing your gifts\nyour mind with the world it is truly\nlife-changing and thank you in\nparticular for sharing it with me and my\ncommunity right now so happy to be here\nwith you it's lovely so I'm curious\nabout our conversation yes so I'm super\nexcited and I think a grateful place to\nstart and I'm a quote person so\num those of you who've listened to my\ninterviews before now I often love to\npluck quotes because I just find words\nso beautiful and your words in\nparticular the way you capture so many\nof these Concepts I was really struck by\nso I want to start off with a quote and\nthen dive us into a conversation and I\nthink quite at the beginning of your new\nbook called attuned you say in the most\nfundamental sense healing is simply the\ncreation of the right container or\nenvironment one of Attunement or\nsynchronization which is the very\nlanguage of relating I have chills as\nI'm reading that aloud\naffirming I think the universal reality\nof that but starting us off with that\nquote in hopes because here we already\nmeet this word Attunement and your book\nof course is similarly called attuned\nwhat is it that you mean what does\nAttunement mean what does it mean to be\nattuned and what inspired you then to\ndedicate an entire book and the title of\nthe book to that concept\num\nokay so let's say when I sit here with\nyou and I feel you when you share and\nwhen you read your quote the quote that\nyou read then immediately my body and my\nnervous system start to get a sense of\nyou I get the I feel I feel connected to\nyou that's already Attunement which I\nthink for many people we do anyway very\noften we attune to each other uh but\noften unconsciously and so on the one\nhand I want to write this wanted to\nwrite this book because I think we can\npractice and make that a real skill\nversus something that's happening often\nunder the radar\nand um and on the other hand I feel you\nand I feel how you feeling me I believe\nis the basic building block of uh\nrelating it's how our nervous systems\nare wired to be social I mean they're\nwired to be social for ages and\num and so when we when we feel each\nother we also have the capacity to first\nof all notice much more information that\nis in the space that sometimes we when\nwe are hypnotized by the content of our\nwords and intellects and a lot of the\ninformation that's in the room is not\nbeing noticed so I think it deepens the\nway we experience life it deepens\nintimacy closeness and I think it also\ndeepens the capacity to hold space when\nsomeone in in an intimate relationship\nin a community in in the world is in\ndistress and we attune to that distress\nin a way that helps the person to slowly\ncome down digest whatever is difficult\nand integrated and I think for if you\nwant to create ecosystems because you\nmentioned the quote I think we are all\nnot only individuals we are individuals\nand ecosystems at the same time and I\nthink we use I use this as in the title\ninterdependence we're all interdependent\nand uh so that's why I thought after\nseeing so much trauma and Collective\ntrauma in the world and seeing how\npositive relationships and real\nlistening and not just giving advice but\nreally being interested helps a lot so\nthat's why I attuned needed to be the\nnext book I I appreciate that example\nand inadvertently I think even and I\ndon't know what you would say this but I\nthink even me noticing right the chills\non my body is is an example right of the\nthe visceral or the somatic the\nbody-based\num kind of state of some degree of\nAttunement right there was some aspect\nof my being that liked or was in\nalignment with that quote and I'm even\ngetting them now with your explanation\num and I'm saying that to say of course\nand you know I've come from historically\nor I was trained as a clinical\npsychologist and for very many years I\nhad a private practice where while I\nwould kind of I always thought of myself\nas integrative and I met the practice of\nmindfulness though it was very much just\na concept in my world it was not\nnecessarily something I was able to\npractice and we're going to go into this\nin terms of trauma and the nervous\nsystem the collective nervous system in\na bit though sharing that to say for a\nvery long time many years\num my body um was unable to really kind\nof be attuned I wasn't working with my\nclients more so even acknowledging their\nphysical bodies or their degree of\nAttunement or lack thereof based on\ntheir own trauma so for me I saw it as\nreally a shortcoming in my own inability\nto to heal to navigate some of my\nintergenerational trauma passed within\nmy own family and I very much saw it as\na limitation in terms of the field and\nthe way that I was then working with my\nclients so I love how so much of your\nwork is you know highlighting that you\nknow I've shifted now into working\nholistically and having a\ncommunity-based approach so there's just\nso much alignment in terms of the work\nthat you do really based in again these\nthese Concepts so you've already said\nsomething that I want to ask you to dive\na bit deeper into now I think I heard\nyou bring up the concept of a collective\nnervous system so can we talk a little\nbit for listeners who might not have\nheard that concept or or you know I was\nobviously describing an individual\nnervous system but what do you mean when\nyou say um Collective nervous system\nyeah anatomically when we see that\nnervous system it looks kind of pretty\nsimple and clear-cut that it belongs to\na body and it's an individual thing so\nit's your nervous system or it's mine or\nit's his or hers but but through my work\nI've seen listen this is not really true\nI think that our nervous system encodes\nfor individual experiences and traits\nand individual gifts and intelligence\nbut I think our nervous system is\nnaturally\nancestral 2 and its Collective too\nand and that the biosphere because\nsometimes when you I ask people so when\nyou go through the forest where is\nnature\nand some people say oh nature is round\neverywhere and say yeah but it's around\naround what\nand it's around nature so nature is not\njust around us and Society is also not\njust around me\nsocieties through me but it makes a big\ndifference either we are we are the\nplanet or we are walking on the planet\nbut even the concept of a human being\nthat my body doesn't feel like it's\nresting deeply as the planet or in the\nplanet and it's part of the planet so we\nhave kind of a dualism or kind of a\nseparation built into how we view the\nworld and sometimes how we then think\nabout the world and many many indigenous\nor other mystical healing Traditions\nlearn to dispel or integrate that kind\nof separation and and notice a much\ndeeper relatedness to everything it\nstarts with nature it starts it\ncontinues with our humanity and with a\nmuch bigger reality Maybe and so the\ncollective nervous system means that we\nare also anyway always collectively\nwired We Belong Together We Can Hurt\nthose connections it's very painful to\nhurt relationships it's very painful to\nwage Wars and we feel the after effects\nof over many generations of how the how\nit impacts the collective nervous system\nbut we are all connected underneath\nanyway it doesn't matter if we feel it\nor not sometimes we might feel pretty\nseparate but doesn't mean that we are\nreally separate and so that Collective\nDimension when I did a collective trauma\nwork and started 20 plus years ago I\nstarted to notice oh wow like the system\nis we are living in a traumatized system\nlike the water that we are swimming in\nis traumatized and we all were wired and\nconditioned by a traumatized system and\nso that's why it's so hard to see\nsometimes because it's uh it's a part of\nit is invisible to our senses and and\nthen we say oh that's how it is that's\nhow politicians talk that's how it works\nhere that's how it works here but that's\nnot how it works that's how it often\nWorks in a hurt world but let's say that\nat least that we are heard that we can\nstart to look at that and not say that's\nhow it is and so that's where also the\nnotion of because the positive effect of\nthe collective nervous system is we can\ncreate spaces and like you you create a\nbig community and the community is a\nconnected nervous system also and in\nthat Community many people can find\nHealing growth development just by being\npart of a community and I think that's\nsuper powerful that's I think the remedy\nand where we are going is is this\nCollective healing work\nI love that you kind of touched on our\nour blindness\num in in a sense I read about her in\nschool I remember at a visual uh\npsychology visual processing class and\nwe learned about a concept that I was so\nfascinated by which was called in\nattentional blindness which was the\nstudied you know kind of fact that we\ncould you know physiologically have\nsomething you know on our in our retina\non our eye to register seeing whatever\nobject it was though if our attention\nwas distracted\num we actually you know become blind to\nthat and you know listeners or people in\nmy community have heard me talk often\nheard me use a similar analogy of like\nthe horse with blinders on it and I love\nhow you're kind of describing it Beyond\nbecause I think about even in my own\njourney in my own family how it becomes\nso easy to self-identify right by that\nclimate those habits of relating or\ndisconnecting whatever it might be and\nto assume right it's just how we are are\nbecause everyone around you we are blind\nand you know I think then that shifts\nand changes as we go over to our\nfriend's house and we're introduced to\nnew climates but really when that's then\nmirrored in society\num I saw this for myself in my 20s where\nI was highly anxious highly disconnected\nI was living in New York City with a lot\nof frenetic energy all of my friends\nwere feeling the same way living for the\nweekend exhausted all the time so like a\nblindered person right why would I think\nthat there was any other way to feel in\nmy family in my relationships in my 20s\nbecause that's how everyone was feeling\naround me but I want to dig a bit deeper\ninto\num when you talk about you know kind of\nour own individual experiences of\nwhether it's individual trauma or\nCollective trauma and you know hoping\nyou could just stay say a little more\nyou know a little more specifically of\nhow that does impact or what is the\nimpact that we see in terms of our\nnervous system our Collective nervous\nsystem around simply our ability to\nattune\nyeah let's start with that most of the\ntrauma that we deal with is maybe\nbesides\nnature catastrophes or whatever so but\nmost of the trauma is\na result of anatily tunes relational\nmoments shut down relational moments\nparents don't beat their children up if\nthey feel their children so we need to\nbe so triggered and enraged and so cut\noff that we can beat the child or that\nwe can abuse somebody or that you know\nthere are many these moments are usually\nmoments that are disrelated and the\ndisrelatedness of one generation\nperpetuates itself through these moments\nto the Next Generation and so what\nhappens in the traumatic moment is that\nit's there's such an overload I often\nsay you know because many people work on\npresencing or becoming more present\nand it looks like it's a bit of an\neffort to become more present and\nbut\nwhen you when we look at the Trump\ntraumatic moments in the traumatic\nmoments\nlife says here in space and time it's\nnot good for me\nwhen somebody gets abused in that moment\nor experience violence like in that\nmoment here in the body staying open\nstaying related staying present to what\nis is not good so not being present the\nforces of getting out of our body\ngetting out of our emotions shutting\ndown something putting a kind of a\npermanent anesthesia onto parts of our\nbody and emotions and Minds is is the\nmost intelligent thing to do\nand and I think that's very important\nfor many of us that judge ourselves for\nthe wounds or the trauma and the issues\nthat we have in life but they are not\nreal issues in the sense that they\nshouldn't be there most of our patterns\nmake perfectly sense given our life\nstory\nso reframing not being present can\nsometimes be something like a kind of a\ndownside to me or like a weakness but\nit's not a weakness it's an intelligence\nthat helped me to survive something\nbetter than without it and I think once\nI begin to look at myself that way that\neverything even if I cannot feel my body\nat the beginning or certain parts of my\nbody then shutting those down was better\nthan leaving it open\nso we can say I can't feel my body or we\ncan also say I managed to shut that part\ndown\nthe way if the second version is\nempowering because it means oh first of\nall that's not forever secondly there is\na process in place that if I don't feel\nnot feeling is a process\nand and so if I get to know that process\nI can begin to soften that process\nbecause most probably today I'm in a\ndifferent place I'm in different\ncircumstances I don't need that anymore\nand I can synchronize my present moment\nwith that past with that numbing for\nexample\nand I think a similar process is also in\nplace in our society through racism\nthrough gender violence through\ncolonialism through big Wars and and\ngenocides and dictatorships and power\nover abuse\nlike we are living in a world where\nnumbing oneself fragmenting splitting\nwas needed in order to survive these\ndisasters and or Holocaust I mean how\ncould people not shut down their systems\nin concentration camps of course they\nhad to\nand and I think if we begin to feel that\nmore in ourselves and in others not\nsomething that just needs to be fixed\nbut something that needs attention\nwe need to provide for each other\nattention listening sensing achievement\nwhere we can sometimes we have enough\nspace to do this sometimes we are\ntriggered ourselves so we hurt ourselves\nso we can't but in the moments when we\ncan we can provide that and I think\nthat's also true uh collectively and and\nso that these wounds need attention not\ngood advice not fixing not oh we should\ndo it better not intellectualization but\nattention and relationships heal our\ntrauma and you know best also that that\nthere are many studies that say that if\nyou have positive relational experiences\nin adverse situations\num the after effect of the trauma impact\nwill be much lower so that's something\nmany of us can provide at least in many\nmoments maybe not always but in many\nmoments and if we do that we create\ncommunities that are much more generous\nand resilient\nI appreciate that and this kind of\nbrings in another beautiful quote where\nyou you write\num in terms of our own individual trauma\nand then and they ask you to dive a\nlittle bit deeper into the collective\naspect of it a second but trauma\ndisrupts the act of relation fracturing\nour capacity to relate with self and\nwith others and just to clarify because\nI was really fascinated um by the\nconcept of collective absencing and I\nthink you were mentioning it a bit\num though again can you say a little\nmore on kind of how you know our own and\nwhat is the connection between this\nindividual fracture and now this kind of\nin terms of our societal or our\nCollective nervous system in this it's\nreally fascinated with this concept of\nof absencing so what do you when you say\nCollective absencing\num kind of what is what is that\nconnection and can you just share a\nlittle more about that concept itself\nnow let's let's start with the absencing\nyou mentioned absencing in the the\nfracture of the self and our relational\ncapacities is often that sometimes\nwhen we feel ourselves we feel that we\ndon't feel\nand sometimes we don't feel and then we\ntry to feel that moment with some stuff\nversus saying\nI don't know\nand in the moment I I can be more with\nmy own absencing or with my numbing\nthat that's not something that I can do\nbut it's something I need to get to know\nbecause when I get to know my numbing I\ncan turn slowly numbing into feeling\nagain but sometimes when we don't feel\nwe go to look what we might be feeling\nand that's already overriding the\noverwhelm so we make it just worse than\nbetter because it just gets harder and I\nthink there's a similar no the there's a\nsimilar\num process in in the collective\nDimension that often Collective trauma\nmeans that many people of a society went\nthrough a similar trauma let's say the\nsecond world war Civil War racism in the\nUS or colonialism in other places that\nthat there was a very big impact on a\npart of the population\nthat many people experienced traumatic\nevents at the same time so it's not only\nbecause let's say somebody has there's a\nbike accident\nso there's one person traumatized but\nthen there is an environment in the city\nthat actually is a holding space so the\ncollective space doesn't go through the\nsame trauma then the one person\nso there's a stable Collective and there\nis an individual hurt when you have\nmassive impacts of trauma you have many\nhurt individuals but you the holding\nspace is diminished so the collective\nholding capacity is also very fragmented\nor chaotic let's say bombs raining down\nonly I was born in Vienna like my\ngrandparents experienced how Vienna was\nbombed in in the Second World War\nof course like the hundreds of thousands\nof people affected at the same time\nsitting in bomb shelters and some houses\nbeing destroyed so this is a the\ncollective field becomes very fragmented\nso there so that has and I believe that\ncreates immediately like a collective\ntrauma response or like a tribal and\ntoday it's much bigger but trauma\nresponse and and that gets stored in our\nCollective psyche so shutting down a\npart of our experience in order to\nsurvive these moments is intelligent but\nif we don't take care of it and often\nthere is there was no knowledge there\nwas no possibility people needed to\nsurvive they didn't have anything to eat\nlike there is no way that trauma healing\nand hanging out in a retreat center is\nthe thing that we do so it didn't get\ntaken care of and it get passed on to us\nand we needed to deal with that also\nbecause the former generation couldn't\nheal it and so Collective app sensing\nalso means that there that when we look\nat Society we might think\noh I know what's going on in society I\nsee it on social media I sit on I don't\nknow in the news but actually and then I\nwe developed a practice it's called\nglobal social witnessing then I said\nokay let's let's check that so let's see\nwhere we are when you get a CNN feed of\na school shooting\ncheck now we create the circumstances\nthat we check in what are you actually\nexperiencing and for many people some we\nread that but we can't feel what that\nmeans we know what that means\nintellectually but we can't feel it\nemotionally physically to tune in to be\nattuned to that event is too\noverwhelming and that's okay that it is\nthat but then it sounds like in the\ninformation age we all are so informed\nbut actually when you look at inform\nit's in\nand the form\nso when you inform me right now means I\nfeel you in me then you in I have a form\nof you in me your information informs my\nnervous system so I can feel you in my\nbody it can feed you emotionally I can\nfeel you I can feel you even though\nwe're sitting thousands of miles away we\ncan feel each other if we want to and\nand I think that that the collective\nabsencing prevents us\nfrom really being contemporary Witnesses\nof the things that are going on in our\nsocieties that's why they keep repeating\nthemselves all the time and I think\nthere's so much trigger that we need to\nlearn to work on that because if not\nthen those unfilled areas become the\nareas where all kinds of social issues\nstart to happen that we try to deal with\nsymptomatically often versus\nlike really going to the roots and\nhealing the societal framework from\nwithin not trying to put a patch on it\nyou bring up and I'm wondering if this\nkind of is a stepping stone to\num you bring up a concept of the\nrelational field\num and kind of a can you kind of say a\nlittle more kind of Define exactly what\nthat is what that looks like then\nobviously if you could wrap that into\nthis idea of you know whether it's\nindividual or social presencing or\nindividual or social absencing again\nbased in for many of us\nintergenerational Collective trauma\npassed down what then impact it could\nhave or how this translates because I\nthink from listeners and and my\nlisteners in particular\num you know the relational field I'm\nimagining and as you're going to explain\nis something that we are navigating\nright as individuals and collectively\nday in and day out so kind of giving us\nkind of the concrete you know what it is\nand again how we can see these different\nlevels of impact that you're beautifully\ndescribing\num\nyeah the first thing is\num\nlike a relation of course starts always\nwith me so if I don't feel my body\nI will miss a lot of information that\nyou're sending to me now when I'm more\nattuned to my advice like a tuning fork\nthen my body will naturally resonate\nwith yours and it will give me\ninformation and it will be a natural\nprocess that I'm going for It's Just\nHappening resonance just happens because\nit's more fluid so I think relating is\nanyway a process of like I feel myself I\nfeel the space in between us because the\nspace in between us is not just air or\nmaybe internet the space in between us\nis full of information you're in the the\ninformation that you radiate into the\nspace that I radiate into the space how\nthey meet how open we are how kind of\nretracted we are is all informing that\nspace between us so the inter-subjective\nspace is full of information and when we\nlearn to feel that space we can and\nespecially also like professionals like\nyourself if we work with a lot of\nclients we need that information because\nit tells us a lot about the process a\nperson is in\nand for example here's an example for\nexample when some people I believe that\nemotions or shared spaces\nhealthy emotions or shared spaces so\nwhen somebody let's say I'm afraid and\nyou feel that I'm afraid then your\nfeeling of my emotions make we meet in a\nshared space\nbut and if I learned as a child that\nwhen I'm scared I always have parents to\ngo to they feel me they're with me I can\nintegrate that I can go out into the\nworld be courageous so I my fear when\nI'm afraid I can share my fear with\npeople because I feel safe enough to\nshare my fear\nso I'll feel people that support me I\noperate an ecosystem and when I say I'm\nscared I will not retract my relational\nenergy\nbut for many people when they're afraid\nthey need to you see how immediately the\nenergy falls back inwards and they feel\nmore withdrawn\nso that's a sign that it's not only\nabout the emotion of fear it's the\nemotion of fear in the given relational\nspace\nthat says a lot about how we grew up so\nthe what happens between us is very\nimportant also for emotional healing\nbecause it's not just enough the emotion\nit's also the emotion plus the the\nrelational space are important because\nthat also is important how supported we\nfeel how much we can receive support\nfrom others and how we can integrate\nthose emotions and then of course so\nit's me it's the space in between us and\nit's also that I feel you when I talk to\nyou my my nervous system is feeling you\nhow you receive what I say what's what's\nhappening in you how you speak all that\ninformation is part of it and so I call\nthe wholeness of what I just shared me\nthe space in between us and you I call\nrelational space\nand this and the similar truth is also\nfor\num let's say my ancestors because I can\ndo my genealogy of all my ancestors that\nI know but I can also feel through my\nbody and feel into the relationships\nthat I can sense or not sense in myself\nand use that as a work to open my\nancestral\ninformation flow and learn about my\nancestors from inside and I think the\nsame is true also for I have seen this\nwhen we did large-scale events for\nCollective trauma fields\nso I've seen groups that were and we\nworked with Holocaust Survivors and with\nNazi descendants in the same room like\nvery explosive uh space one would think\nbut with the right relational holding\nspace of hundreds of people or more that\nare holding that kind of process it\nactually becomes an amazing presence\nand I somehow believe given what I've\nseen in the last 20 years that that kind\nof collective presencing space or spaces\nthat's that's the next step for healing\nand we will still do of course\none-on-one healing work but one even\none-on-one healing work in bigger\nCollective spaces is much faster much\ndeeper stronger it's like there is much\nmore power through the collective\nwitnessing and and so I'm very hopeful\neven if we look into the world and we\nsay wow it's uh there's so much pain in\nthe world which is true but if we come\ntogether and we synchronize our\nCollective relational space and we do it\nwell with the right ingredients I think\nthe healing power that this and I'm sure\nyou'll see this also in your community\nthat through the community there's a lot\nof power being generated that actually\nbenefits everybody in the community\nI'm shaking my head so so adamantly\ngetting just off of one of our workshops\nin the self-healer circle I was ending\nwith gratitude um reflected right back\nto the other individual members for the\ncontainer like you're beautifully\ndescribing that um they offer meat in my\nown healing Journey as I'm still very\nmuch on it healing from that\nmisattunement in childhood and all of\nthat absencing right that was then you\nknow kind of collectively validated in a\nsense and everything that I was sharing\nearlier so I do want to dive into\ncommunity and interdependence and even\nvirtual community in just a second but\nI'm really fascinated I mean it was\nsomething that you said earlier and\nagain wrote in your book\nI'm really fascinated by this line where\nyou say and you've used the word\nintegrated a couple times so I just want\nto poke into that a bit but you say\nunintegrated history is past\nintegrated history is presence I think\nthat's just so so beautiful and of\ncourse for listeners who have heard now\nthis idea of integration come in and\nkind of I think what we're talking about\nindividually and collectively even you\nknow utilizing or referencing ancestors\nand this idea of trauma passed on and\ncan you say more about the difference\nbetween unintegrated history and why you\ndescribe that as past versus integrated\nhistory and presence I think that's just\nso beautiful\nyeah like I love it too yeah yeah that's\nthe same so the collective healing work\nI I felt when they you know our whole\nconcept of History actually doesn't make\nsense because even the whole concept of\ntime that we have because it's commonly\nknown as yesterday was the past and\ntomorrow is the future and then\nsometimes instead of people how often\ndid you have tomorrow the same\nconversation with your spouse that you\nhad already 10 times or 20 times many\ntimes so we have this again so then I\nsay yeah but if you have the same loop\nagain tomorrow how come that tomorrow is\nthe future maybe tomorrow is just a\nrepetition of the past\nso that doesn't really make sense and\nthen and then\nbut when we integrate something in the\ntrauma healing work\nwe can see how something that was split\noff and was uttered in myself\nlike how many people say I want to get\nrid of my fear like as if the fear was\nsomething other that I can cut off\nand that's exactly the trauma and\nbecause I needed to cut off that fear as\na two-year-old\nso we repeat Even in our attempt to heal\nourselves the same thing that happened\nalready way earlier in our life instead\nof saying wow\npeople wouldn't say I want to cut off my\nright arm\nand then everybody says no of course not\nsay but why of course not by the fear\nyes and there are not it doesn't make\nsense but the fear is as much you as is\nyour arm or as part of you and and so\nthen we see wow we are repeating even in\nthe healing work we want to get rid of\nour problems more than to integrate them\nwhich means to to learn to feel that\nfear bring it back home integrate it and\nmake it part of our growth so to take\ninformation that has been split off and\nreintegrated into the central flow and\nand so\nwhen we\num when we say integrated history every\ntime something heals it feels more\nintegrated and present so all the stuff\nfrom our ancestors that is integrated is\njust part of our presence here all your\nancestors all my ancestors I mean the\nintegrated part is having this\nconversation\nbut the unintegrated history the history\nthat needed to split off that often\nlives in US is massive individual and\nCollective fears massive rage massive\nabsencing as we talked about\nfragmentation othering that reproduces\nitself again and again as circular\npatterns\nand so that's why I said yeah it doesn't\nmake we cannot say the history is the\npast that doesn't make sense so\nintegrated history is presence\nit's alive in us it creates our\nperspective right now because I didn't\ninvent a heart but the heart is pumping\nin my chest but I couldn't say that I\ndid that\nmillions of years did that through our\nancestors and so many other things even\nso many things we say today somebody\nalready said one somewhere so they are\nnot so original sometimes we play like\nwow everything will be development is\nsomething original you know there were\ngreat people around a long period of\ntime and but they're but unintegrated\nhistory\nproduces those patterns that we are\nafraid in situations where we actually\nthere is no threat and we are still\nafraid or we are numb and there is no\noverwhelmed but we feel numb because we\nwere overwhelmed in the past that's\nunintegrated history and that's the past\nor in a Far East language that's the\nkarma that has been passed on postponed\nexperience and so whatever we cannot\nintegrate we pass on to the next\ngeneration\nand our ancestors did the same so we are\nsitting in a way in the postponed\nexperience of former generations and\nthat's why I often say it's our job is\nHumanity to clean up the living room\nI think we need to clean up our\nCollective living room in order to\nreally be present with each other\nwe can't just innovate more and then try\nto be free of the past just let's forget\nit no it won't forget us that's that's\nthe problem we might forget the past but\nit won't forget us so it will come back\nas the ghosts and the demons and the\nfears and the shame that will again have\nan effect on our current day\nrelationships\nI appreciate\num that very beautiful description and\nwhat I've really always appreciated\nabout your work Thomas is your ability\nto honor even that which can't see won't\nsee right aren't equipped to see\nindividually and collectively um because\nI do think in the you know kind of\nprolific amount of information that we\nnow have available and I hear this often\nin within the community I do think a lot\nof us have this belief\num sometimes for well-intentioned\nsurvival based purposes right I'm past\nthere right those Generations didn't\naffect me\num and we kind of turn our own then\nBlind Eye yet we have a mismatch between\nwhat our body is saying differently in\nthose moments um though we're trying to\nalmost will ourselves you know sometimes\nreading information of you know just a\nfirm different and look toward and you\nknow spiritual emotional bypassing and\nthis idea and your work has always\nreally honored not only the individual\npain that inevitably we're going to\ncarry as humans so the pain that for\nmany of us that I think is even more\nconfusing pain that has been passed on\nthroughout in our ancestors and for me\nit was my the biggest shift was\nbeginning to view not only my child but\nmy childhood but all of my ancestors as\na impact on what experiences that I had\nbecause for a very long time you know I\nhad this narrative that you know I had\nthis very close connected happy family\nyou know nothing was wrong I had a roof\nover my head I had a you know physically\npresent caregiver at all times though I\ndid not realize that in terms of\nabsencing there was a huge hole of\nemotional absence again passed down\nthrough my lineage so for me it was\nreally a point of confusion especially\nbeing a clinical psychologist who worked\nwith people who had those big terrible\nthings you know that you even described\nearlier that had happened and yet I was\nfinding myself struggling in the same\nways feeling disconnected in the same\nways you know dealing with the\ndisconnection and all the habitual same\nways and without this language to\nunderstand that I actually too was\ncarrying this deep rooted suffering that\nwas almost indefinable until I began to\nhave the language and of course your\nwork was one of the biggest impacts in\nterms of being able to have the language\nto open up the blinders a bit and say\nwell wait a minute there there were a\nlot of things you know that did not\nhappen and ways in which you know\nindividuals coming from two older\nparents I did not even have the\nopportunity to meet even my grandparents\ngeneration let alone great grandparents\nand there's a lot of lack of recall in\nmy family again based in their own\ntraumatic childhood so there's no even\npassed down stories of how things were\nso again with that blankness you know I\ndidn't have the understanding that my\nbody still was carrying the memories and\nfor me even you touching on this kind of\nidea of collective fear for me\nindividual fear manifested in panic\ndisorder in those 20s that I was\ndescribing earlier and you know only\nhaving the language of oh well my\nfamily's kind of nervous and there's\nHealth stuff happening so of course I am\ntoo but not understanding the depth\nbeneath that Iceberg so I do want to\nmake a shift um back to like I offered\nearlier into\ninterdependence we talked about or you\nbrought up that that concept itself and\nwe've been talking about it in terms of\nabsencing and presencing in general but\nI am hoping you can say a bit more and I\njust as always on a one more beautiful\nquote the architect of true human\nconnection somehow includes yet\ntranscends the personal\ninterdependence is at once deeply\nintimate and utterly Universal\npure moments of relating reach us at the\nroot touching who we truly are while\nsimultaneously elevating what is\npossible for us to become so I'm sure\nmany listeners have heard this concept\nof interdependence being used can you\nsay a little more about what\ninterdependence is and particularly you\ndescribe it as deeply intimate and\nutterly Universal so in a sense we are\nall joined in this in this concept in\nthis practice\nhmm it's lovely how you read the parts\nit's lovely how you give it your energy\nand how it touches you and then it\nbrings this quality into the space it's\nvery beautiful\num yeah interdependence I think that's\nalso like me responding to how I feel\nyou feel this sentence is already part\nof interdependence that you affect me\ntouches me and then I respond to how it\ntouches me means we're sharing something\nwe are meeting through the quote in the\nemotional depth that we are both\ninterested in this in this kind of\nthings and in Exploring Life it it\ncreates a mutual space and I think\nthat's part of interdependence that by\nthe way we are also breathing the air\nthat keeps us alive right now and we are\npart of a biosphere that provides the\nair that we can have this conversation\nmeans that we are interdependent in that\nway and it also means that when I I'm as\na because we are living in this\nhyper-individualized Western world but\nit's not only Western anymore but this\nhyper individualism creates the illusion\nas if there is a separate individual\nthat can do anything rain every like a\nkind of be the king of the world and at\nthe same time uh get can have everything\nin the world that it can get and\nand is responsible for his own success\nand failure then of course I'm also\nresponsible for my way and my path but\nthat's not the only thing that there is\nand I'm not just an individual I'm\nalways ecosystemically active\nwhich I think also results in what I\nwrote In the book that I think like\nsometimes people say oh it's my\nunconscious yeah of course it's also my\nunconsciousness but I need a community\nto share my unconsciousness for my\nunconscious to stay in place because if\nI have many awake people around me I\nwill feel a lot of Developmental stress\nbecause all this stuff will come up\nbecause people will see and feel what I\ncan see and feel so that will create\nsome movement in me so there is no some\nnot something merely individual we are\nalways affecting each other all the time\nand that's I think also the great\nbenefit because it means whatever we go\nthrough as Society is look at covet how\nmuch covet was a fragmentation and\npolarization but at the same time we\ncould have solved covet as one Society\ngoing for one and integrating the\ndifferent views in a different way it\ndoesn't mean that we all need to agree\nbut it means that the relationships are\nstronger than the disagreement and\nthat's not what happened often the\ndisagreements were stronger than the\nrelationships and then the whole thing\nfragments and then we have the different\nthem and us and the ones we fight and I\nthink that shows us where\num where our where the collective trauma\nof the past has a lot of influence\nbut interdependence means how how I live\nmy life when people say oh I mean there\nare some interesting some interesting\nthings in the self-development scene one\nis like\num\nthe the notion like okay how developed\nwe are but how developed we are we see\nwhen we look at our life because what\nwhat you're able to manifest around you\nthat's your State of Consciousness how\nyour relationships look like how your\nfamily life looks like how your work\nlife looks like look let's look at that\nthat gives us a clear a reflection of\nwhat we need to work on and what already\nis flowing and where we are open\ngenerous\ntight and all this and all of that's\nokay but it's like it life gives us\nanyway all the time amazing feedback we\njust need to listen to it and the other\nthing that fits a bit to what you said\nyou mentioned something first was really\nbeautiful about the spiritual bypassing\nbecause sometimes we don't even notice\nthat we are doing this because\nhow many people say\nhow long do I have to do this work still\nhow long do I need to work on my when\nwill I be there\nand I say where and there and then there\nis an idea of it there\nand then we don't see that there is the\nreflection of what's not here\nthe part that couldn't be here because\nit was too painful always needs it there\nto give it give it hope that it can\ncontinue working but it's a sign that\nI'm not here\nand the whole question about how long do\nI need to do the work says only\nsomething about it some aspects are hard\nfor me to feel and discover but let's\nlet's call it that way but maybe that's\nokay it's okay that it's hard to\ndiscover but let's call it that way\nlet's not get hypnotized by where we are\ngoing and I think interdependence also\nis is a feeling that we are part of even\nif sometimes we don't feel that way\nbecause sometimes we feel very isolated\nlonely depressed and and that's that\nalso belongs to it but we are always\naffecting the ecosystem and if we put\npoison into the ecosystem we will\nbreathe poison and if we bring clean air\ninto the ecosystem we will breathe clean\nair because we will breathe it together\nand and I think that's why I love\ninterdependence and it's also that I\nthink I often say love is Precision or\nPrecision is love when we that love is\nuniversal\nbut at the same time it's very specific\nand it means exactly the person in that\nstate of development in that process\nthat's going on for him or her or them\nthat's what needs to be seen now so that\nthere is no you know it's it's Universal\nor it's both all the time it's very\nspecific and it's also very open and\nspacious and wide and Universal\nthat's so beautiful I'm again really\nappreciating\num again how you're you know kind of\nhonoring the reality that we are always\nconnected to someone to something at all\ntimes even because one of the things\nthat I do here often right is this idea\nof you know hyper-independence and even\nwhen I speak about\num I know a lot in my work I talk about\nthis idea of self-healing in community\nright this idea of exactly the\nconversation we're having in a lot of\nways of becoming aware of all that were\nyou know carrying into and creating\nthrough a more community-based model you\nknow shifting from the old way I used to\nwork after coming to this realization\nand the impact of relationships in my\nown Journey one of the criticisms I\noften hear is this belief\nmisinterpretation that what I'm\nsuggesting is anywhere a version of a\nhyper-independence focus on self so I\nappreciate you kind of acknowledging\nthat that's like that is actually\nphysiologically impossible in terms of\nthe natural being and the embeddedness\nthat we each you know are and offer and\nI was also left laughing when you were\ndescribing about getting there\num my language for that and I talk about\nthis often within the community is my\npreference was to be done\num to be completed to check off that\nfinal box of achievement that I was\nendlessly searching for because that's\nthe only way I knew how to define myself\nan absence of an emotional connection\nright so all of the shame of who I was\nin my entirety was shoved down in a\nself-focused on this identity of\nachieving and thinking that that would\nthen give me not only peace but a\nconnected fulfilling deep emotional\nrelationship which I was proclaiming\nfrom the rafters that I desperately\nwanted yet was continuing through my own\nabsence absence in my own relationship\nwith myself and absence in my actual\nrelationships with other people that I\nwas continuing of course to perpetuate\nthose Cycles so I am going to\nself-profess I was endlessly in search\nof done\num I call it my hippie hammock in the\nsky where I could throw my peace signs\nand live a fulfilling life only to\nrealize that I had to be an active\nparticipant\num as we're kind of diving just a bit\ndeeper before I let you go into this\nidea of interdependence as we touched on\na bit community and the value and the\nimportance as I'm hearing you reflect\nback my own agreement the importance of\nhealing in community so I'm hoping you\ncan speak a little bit about not only\nthe process of right getting in touch\nwith our own ancestral wounds trauma and\nhow that you know plays out in our\nrelationship so what you really do see\nand hope for the future in terms of a\nmore communal way of of healing and of\nnavigating and of healing again bringing\nthe concept very much full circle our\nCollective nervous system and what is\nkind of the role and the process of both\nagain our own ancestral wounds and\nconnecting globally or however it is in\na more Community interdependent way\num\nyeah it started like five years ago I\nstarted to I said okay we need to get\nthe word out about Collective trauma so\nI started a collective trauma Summit I\nthink the fifth is coming up soon now\nand um and and it it really worked it's\nlike Collective trauma became more of a\nbuzzword and we we I often say if you\nwant to start a movements gather your\ntribe\nconnect to the people that go into a\nsimilar Direction have resonances and\nyou you create networks and if you\ncreate networks you create the buzz and\nand you create you strengthen each other\nso and that really worked and this and\nduring that work I often said I think we\nneed like\nhospitals\nseems so normal\nwhen in fact there was a time when\nhospitals didn't exist\nso how come that there were no hospitals\nand then now there are hospitals is\nsomebody thought or some people thought\nit would be great for sick people to\nhave a place to find help okay however\nthat happened and however long it took\nand and I think we need the same\nwe need a collective healing\narchitecture that every nation I think\nneeds to begin to take responsibility\nfor the Legacy that has been passed on\nthrough multiple or one generation\nwhatever what has been created in this\ngeneration like a war in In Our Lifetime\nand uh and I think we have to learn to\ntake more ownership and this needs\neducation this needs to get the word out\nthis needs to systems to start embracing\nCollective trauma but we need an\narchitecture to heal those legacies this\nintergenerational work that you\nmentioned that you also did and you find\npowerful I think it needs to be a public\nhealth\nactivity and and we we need public\nhospitals for the collective health and\nthose are places also like you creating\na community like we need to create\nbigger communities where we can do that\nsafely where we can do that with each\nother where we have some guidance how to\ndo it and then heal the legacies and\nbecause\nI I also often say it's not only about\nthe trauma I mean the trauma is like\nimagine there is a book\nand the in the book is the remedy how to\nrestore something but the book is frozen\nin ice so you can't read it really so\nyou can't create the magic potion so you\nneed to de-ice the book A lot of the\ntrauma work is de-icing de-icing our\nlife making our life more fluid more\nrelational more connected but what does\nthat lead to that leads to the fact that\nwe begin to feel not only no begin to\nfeel what actually was the ethical\ntransgression that led to the\ntraumatization in the first place\nbecause as long as we can't feel it we\ncan't restore it so but the ethical\ntransgression is stored in the eyes\nin the permafrost so we need to de-ice\nthat permafrost not only to heal our\nbodies but I think when the ethical\ndevelopment can be harvested and we\nexperience post-traumatic learning\nto be literally upgrade the ethical\nunderstanding of our world and I think\nif you deal with AI if you deal with\nnanotechnology if you deal with genetic\nengineering if you deal with I don't\nknow all kinds of weapons\nwe have to have a sound ethical wisdom\nbut some of our wisdom as humanity is\nfrozen in the eyes that we didn't heal\nyet so that's why we can think a lot of\nethical thoughts\nbut in many moments when it really\ncounts we don't act like that and and\nthat's that's an issue we don't walk our\ntalk all the time\nbecause some of the past is still frozen\nin the eyes that we've never melted so\nwe never got the ethical learning and I\nbelieve that the ethical learning is\nmore than its ethics or its ways of how\nwe\nhowever the law is embedded in\nrelationships\nhas a beautiful sentence in the in the\ntranslation of Stephen Mitchell it says\nwhen everybody follows the Tao the law\nwill be written in their hearts\nI think that's so beautiful it's like\nthe law is not an external rule book the\nlaw is embedded in my action in my words\nand in the way how we relate to each\nother the law is in it not\nexternalized but when it's externalized\nit means that we also externalized in\nourselves we don't feel ourselves fully\notherwise we wouldn't do certain things\nso coming back to that ethical\nrestoration I think also\nwhen the ethical restoration happens\nthe self-healing mechanism of the\nbiosphere is coming fully back online\nand I think then we also live in\ncommunities where we can live together\nin peace and in in prosperity because we\nlive in with the law of life is being\nwritten in our hearts nobody needs to\nremind us how to be with our children\nhow to be with the neighbor how to be\nwith the other country once we need to\nget that reminder we already need to\nstop and look what's happening so I\nthink that's maybe this Collective\narchitecture that every nation has some\nLegacy and I think we need to begin to\ndo that globally in order I think it's\nalso needed in order to deal with\nclimate change and big topics like that\nI'm again shaking my head profusely and\nin just so much\num resonance with with everything that\nyou're sharing Thomas and I actually\neach morning I have a translation of the\nDow book and I read two pages in it and\nI have been known to say that I am of\nthe true belief and I will go on record\nsaying this that I truly believe that\nhumans again are compassionate\nconnective creatures and I could not\nagree more that when we're connected\nwith with our heart with the Dao with\nwall inside of us that we don't we're\nnot actually out to harm or to hurt or\nto destruct another person ourselves\nSociety in general that you know I am of\nthe agreement that I do believe we can\nyou know learn how to self-govern and we\nare you know intrinsically and even so\nmuch of my vocabulary love you seek is\nbased on that idea that returning to the\nheart and to our Pure state of\ncompassionate connection which again\nsome of us are very much disconnected\nfrom um is the way we heal and before we\nagain for a selfish reason I want to\nkind of just ask you a bit more in terms\nof building I heard you say right the\nsafe container for Collective Attunement\nand you know if there are you know\npractical parameters or suggestions or\nhow you would describe and whether or\nnot you think it can be done virtually\nyou know what it is that would be\nimportant for the safety of a of a\ncommunity to begin because imagining\nmany people listening or going to be\ninspired and are on different stages of\ntheir journey and many um you know\nwanting to create and share themselves\nand create their own individual\ncommunity so when we're thinking about\nright these these shared containers of\npresencing and of healing our nervous\nsystem you know are there any I guess\ntips or suggestions or what you feel to\nbe important and again how possible you\ndo feel it to be done virtually as\nopposed to in person\nyeah I think\num the basic\nthe basic aspect is the intention like\nwhy are we doing this we are doing this\nin order to come together to heal\nourselves so if that's the premises if\nwe come together to heal ourselves and\nbe part of other people's healing then\nthere are already a few things that that\ncome into being naturally one is it\nneeds to be a safe space that is not\nbased on judgment but that is based on\nlistening that is based on me not\nknowing more than knowing that is not\nbased on giving good advice but it's\nbased on asking questions that we are\ninterested in to inquire deeper and to\nand support somebody to give birth to\ntheir own Truth Versus me coming with my\ntruth about you and it's based on\nAttunement because co-regulation and\nAttunement creates safety in the nervous\nsystem so when we feel each other new\nreception is a is a process in the\nnervous system feeling felt creates\nsafety so when we when we come together\nand we want to look at the big topics of\nour society we need to create first the\nrelational spaces that are good holding\ncontainers with the right ingredients\nand then we begin to look deeper and we\nstart with ourselves obviously and we\nalso begin to hold space for others and\nI have seen\nif you practice that and we keep to the\ncertain of the precepts the there are\nmoments in those communities where we\nlooked at some of the deepest pain that\npeople can experience but uh like there\nwas you could hear a pin drop in like\neverybody like hundreds of little huge\nholes were absolutely quiet\nand and were there they were quiet\nbecause they were so in\nthat nobody thought really okay how long\nit's gonna take because in the state of\npresence you don't ask how long it's\ngonna take you're there and and it's\namazing like the power that that has\nthat witnessing is a holding space that\ncan hold very deep pain into\ngenerational pain and of course that's\nnot something that that without any\nexperience we can immediately establish\nbut I'm I'm just sharing that I have\nexperienced Collective healing moments\nthat are amazing and even if we create\nlighter versions where we come together\nwe make a space we open a space that\npeople feel safe enough to share we\ncreate the right architecture within a\nbigger group maybe that feels safer at\nthe beginning so we make sure that not\nbeing able to is not the dysfunction is\na need for something else so if somebody\ndoesn't dare to speak so most probably\nthere's a reason and we don't want to\noverride that reasons they can come on\ndo it no but we want to be mindful of\nthe in that people bring in a states\nwith them that are different in our own\nexperience I think that's important so\nthey're not knowing more than the\nknowing is important and I think\nthe same is true for Collective spaces\nbut it needs some more training that\nwhen we are\nwhen we are together Collective\ncollectively virtually\num then we really need to practice\nachievement with each other so let's say\nyou have a big Zoom class where you can\nsee up to thousand people\num that we\npractice Attunement virtually that we\nfeel each other because otherwise our\nmind tells me oh you're thousands of\nmiles away how can I feel you but I give\nsessions to people online in their\nfinest detail of their childhood and we\ncan feel each other very deeply and we\nare sitting and looking at the 2D image\nand the person feels the impact on the\nother side so there's more than just the\ndistance that connects us here and I\nthink if we can let go of that mental\nidea that's energy or sensing is local\nit's much more than local then we can\nreally bring a whole Community a global\nCommunity into a very intimate space\nonline and I've seen many of those and\nthey become very very intimate and so I\nthink if you can keep and we have some\nskilled maybe therap therapists or\ntrained people on board that can hold\nsometimes the space for for a more\ncomplex trauma this I think we need also\nsome trained people so\num then then many things are possible\nand then we can choose to reach level of\ndepth spaces can go and what is too much\nand I think if you know what we can\nhandle and what we cannot handle then\nI think it becomes a responsible space\nand and I also think that it's the\nemergence of this time is collective\nhealing spaces they want to emerge\nthrough us so\num this is the time\ncould not agree more and that\ndescription was was so beautiful and\njust again bringing up within Community\nwe talk a lot about Concepts and tools\nin the circle and you know things to do\nto embody every you know lots of what\nwe're talking about here today though\nI've never witnessed such profound\nhealing and that's not necessarily being\ntalked about and you know where\nsomeone's Journey\nsomeone's suffering is what's being\nshared because there's the moment of\nthen you know in the chat itself hearing\nsomeone from quite literally around the\nworld I'm saying I'm I'm crying here\nbecause what you're sharing right has\nresonated I've attuned to your\nexperience which could be different in\nsome way though emotionally right I've\ntouched my own grief I've touched my own\nanger I've touched my own you know loss\nor sadness or whatever it might be and\naside from the good ideas and Concepts\nthat I like to think that we share and\ntalk about in Practical tools right that\nto speak to your point so beautifully is\nis where this I think Collective you\nknow safety and Attunement when we see\nourselves and feel ourselves being seen\nthat is I could not agree more and I'm\nagain having met your work now quite\nsome time ago and continuing to to see\nthe impact that you're having and my\ncommunity and many other communities\nthat are now you know popping up by I\ntoo am really hopeful for the continued\nEvolution um not only of the psychology\nfield if you will but just of humanity\nitself really moving toward a more\ncommunal Collective curious you know in\nterms of our unique differences and\nsimilarities and and really everything\nin between so thank you thank you thank\nyou for for the impact that you're\nhaving and as we're getting ready to end\nhere\num where can any listeners if they're\nnot yet familiar with you or your work\nfollow along obviously we can make sure\neverything too is in the show notes for\nthis episode where can they pick up your\nyour book attuned if they are interested\nyeah I tuned in the bookstores and at\nAmazon Amazon you can find it you can\nfind it also on tunebook.com my website\nis Thomas whible h-u-e-b-l Thomas\nh-u-e-b-l.com it's the website and our\nupcoming Summit for everybody who wants\nto listen to a variety of great speakers\nand people from different disciplines\nand cultures and backgrounds so it's a\ncollective traumasummit.com Collective\ntraumasummit.com\nand maybe the last one is we have an NGO\nthat does collective trauma work uh and\nit's uh the pocketproject.org\npocketproject.org awesome so that's\nmaybe thank you and again we'll make\nsure all that is linked up below for\nanyone who is interested\num in any of those amazing resources\num obviously I have the opportunity to\nread your book it's it is yet another\ngreatly impactful book not only on my\nown individual journey within my\ncommunity\num and I do believe it will really\nimpact everyone who does choose to pick\nit up and thank you again for your\nimpact your mind the work that you two\nyou know are doing as a human and within\nthe collective and it has greatly\nimpacted me and as I always like to\nthank everyone for listening who tunes\ninto these conversations and is on this\njourney I I too am of the belief that\nthis is how we heal our Collective needs\nhealing and many of us are aware and are\ndoing our individual and our communal\nparts and doing that so again like I\nshared within my community earlier I\nwill share with all of you tuning into\nthis channel it is the role that we are\neach playing that allows me to continue\non my own journey and us to continue to\nevolve and to heal the collective so\nthank you all again\nthank you it's beautiful I just want to\nalso say that the the way you hold the\nSpace is really beautiful like it was I\nfelt it very grounded and very beautiful\nback and forth flow of information and I\nfelt this very connected so I deeply\nenjoyed the space that you create when\nyou when you do this uh conversations\nit's very beautiful thank you that\nreally um Thomas means more to me than\nyou know um as far Khan knows who's been\nwith me here in the beginning I've had a\nlot work through a lot of my own anxiety\nbeing seen being connected to being on\ncamera putting myself out there\nauthentically not only with another\nindividual that I was talking to but\nknowing that such a big community of the\ncollective would view it and that was\nvery much evidence in my presentation I\nhad a lot of high anxiety I spoke very\nfast I had all this frenetic uh energy\nthat I too myself have have seen move\ntoward a much more grounded presence so\nyou've affirmed so much of my own\nindividual Evolution and I'm so grateful\nto hear that you've experienced me in\nthat that new way as I continue like I\nsaid on on my own journey of evolution\nand back to my own heart so thank you\nthank you again for sharing that Insight\nthat awareness that experience of me and\neverything you've gifted us all"
