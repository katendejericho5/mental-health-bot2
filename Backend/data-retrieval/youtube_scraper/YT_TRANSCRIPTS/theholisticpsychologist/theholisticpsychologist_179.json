    "transcript": "so it sounds like you were the scapegoat\nyeah I was always the issue when I was\ngrowing up my parents always blamed me\nfor being so difficult and my dad told\nme when I was in high school that I was\nthe reason my parents were getting a\ndivorce that must have been painful to\nhear it was but I really got used to it\nI'm numb sometimes when my mom was at\nhome she would start yelling at me out\nof nowhere when she was upset and tell\nme to clean the house I know this sounds\ncrazy but to this day when I hear a\nvacuum I get anxious that actually\ndoesn't sound crazy at all those\nmemories are stored in the body and we\nremember it sounds like your parents\ncouldn't regulate their nervous systems\nso they blamed you for all the\ndysfunction within the home even though\nyou were just a child when adults can't\nregulate they will lash out and\nexternalize issues onto anyone including\ntheir own children sometimes they don't\neven know they're doing it the thing was\nthey weren't like this to my sister just\nme they were nicer to her and I just\nknew they favored her it sounds like she\nwas a golden child in families there are\ntypically highly formed subconscious\nroles that each member takes on it\nsounds like your sister was the one who\ngot all the praise and you got all the\nblame and these roles helped your\nparents distract them their own issues\nfrom what you shared your parents had a\nvery dysfunctional marriage and your dad\nhad issues with alcohol so these roles\nhelp them stay distracted from\nthemselves and see someone else as the\nissue so how can I heal from this well\nthis awareness helps and as a start next\nwe'll focus on developing your own sense\nof self separate from your family this\nmeans learning what you like what you\nneed and what your preferences actually\nare getting to know yourself see you\nhave this formed identity that they\ncreated and it's not reflective of\nreality so we want to get more in touch\nwith reality"
