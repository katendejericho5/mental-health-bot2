    "transcript": "foreign\nI'm joined here today with Dr Carolyn\nLeaf a communication pathologist and\nclinical neuroscientist specializing in\npsychoneurobiology her passion is to\nhelp people see the power of the mind to\nchange the brain control chaotic\nthinking and find mental peace Dr\nCarolyn Leaf is joining me here today to\ntalk about her latest book how to help\nyour child clean up their mental mess a\nguide to building resilience and\nmanaging mental health she gives so many\npractical tips for all of you parents\nout there you're going to want to stay\ntuned to have a listen\nso Dr Carol Lee thank you so much for\njoining us here today to talk about your\nnew book how to help your child clean up\ntheir mental mess a guide to building\nresilience and managing mental health\nthank you for sharing your time with us\nhere today oh thank you Nicole always\nlove having conversations with you and\nit's always exciting so thank you for\nhaving me on your show and I love the\nnew cover in the background thank you\nthank you thank you thank you I think a\nreally great place to start and this\nreally we had had a conversation so for\nthose of you who haven't checked it out\num this is not the first time that I've\nspoken to DR leaf here and I know a lot\nof your work typically and the last book\nthat you put out was about helping\nadults right clean up what you call\nmental mess and now you're gifting us\nwith how to help in terms of our\nchildren so I think a really great\nfoundational point to start with is what\ndo you mean when you say mental mess and\nare there particular I guess signs or\nsignals or ways that we might be able to\nknow or identify if our children are\nstruggling with with what you call\nmental mess absolutely well it's a great\nplace to start because essentially all\nof us as humans are like little\nexperiments and we like little\nscientists or you know we don't know\nwhat's coming up so we try this and we\ntry that and we say this and we say that\nand we do and it's kind of messy and we\nhave to kind of learn to manage that\nmess and put at certain points in our\nlife we don't manage the means very well\nand then things sort of sort of\ncollapsing\num and it can shift and then things from\nthe past of you know as we know so it's\nused no so well Trauma from the past can\nbe triggered and then patents start\nemerging in our life and that makes\nthings more messy and they're still open\nto all the different areas of our life\nand we kind of have to realize that we\nneed to manage our mind all the time\nbecause our mind's doing the work the\nbrain is just what the mind is using so\nin the in the field that I'm in of\npsychoneurobiology as you know I do a\nlot of research we've got big studies\nrunning another big one running at the\nmoment looking at just time frames and\ntime frames of change and it applies so\nmuch to the children's book and the\nreason I mention this and and the reason\nI brought out this book now is I have\nfour adult children but my youngest\npatient in my practice was two and three\nyears of age and I saw even at that age\nwe we can teach a child how to manage\ntheir mental mess how to recognize if\nsomeone's stolen my toy to someone's\nmaybe touching me incorrectly how to be\nable to tell your story to give them the\ntools to tell the story I mean just the\nwork that you do you cannot stress in\nenough how early we should start with\nhelping a child to be able to embrace\nand process and reconceptualize so\nthat's essentially the idea is to help\nthe person teach a child as well as\nthemselves to identify the messes\nwhether it's a one two whether it's on a\nscale of one to ten whether it's a daily\nstruggle like a little thing or a big\nthing like a sexual abuse or something\nlike that you can teach a child as young\nas two how to read these signs I love I\njust I was smiling when I was hearing\nyou\num describe or use the word in\nparticular Carolyn Messi\num and I think you know I'm smiling so\nmuch and and you know kind of\nacknowledging that because I think so\nfew of us you know as as adults\num really are able to embrace that The\nHuman Experience is messy I think we get\nto this point in life where we shame\nourselves we think we should have things\nfigured out yet you know we I think very\nnaturally maybe have more of a leeway\nright with children it might be easier\nto say oh yeah childhood is messy\nthere's difficult things that happen\nthough when we get to a certain age\nright it should become less messy but I\nlove how you're really embracing the\nmessiness that in my opinion right\nexists it is part of the human\nexperience but I'm interested in if\nwe're going to say on the one hand right\nlife is messy and really simplifying it\nof course right how do we make a\ndistinction then between what you might\nbe labeling as different degrees of a\nmess obviously some being instances of\nabuse or trauma or neglect and more\ninstances of just regular messy human\nexistence or does it even matter\nI definitely does because you if you\nthink of it you've got your day-to-day\nmoments that you have to manage so\nthere's like for example your sibling\nsteals a toy or takes a toy yours may\nnot steal that's a harsh word but takes\nyour toy and that's not a crisis but for\nyou in that you know long-term crisis\nbut that in that moment is very very\nmeaningful to you as a three-year-old or\nsomething like that so we don't want to\ninvalidate that experience because we\nknow that even those little experiences\ninvalidated will grow into big problems\nin the future so to be able to have a\nchild understand that when your sibling\ntakes your toy that's going to make you\nfeel a certain way it's going to make\nyou act a certain way it's going to make\nyour tummy feel sore maybe it's going to\nmake you think I hate my my brother when\nyou don't really but it's going to make\nyou feel like that to be able to to ex\nto be able to accept that that's okay\nthat I feel this way because taking my\ntour is not great but I can't stay in\nthis moment of messiness I can't go now\ngo chase him and hit him on the head\nwith things or scream and throw a\ntantrum for too long maybe for a little\nbit but not for too long it's energy\nthat's built up their child has all that\nexperience as energy in the brain\nbecause it's ch it's not nice to have\nyour toys it was such a basic example\nbut not nasty little toy stall stolen or\ntaken that energy is erratic so we would\nsee that on a scientific level as waves\nthat are like very erratic or think of\nwaves of the sea because I'm looking at\nthe beautiful sea at the moment and\nthink of a wave that's very big and busy\nversus a nice calm wave that energy\ndoesn't just go it goes it doesn't just\ndisappear transfers so a young child\ntransfers energy very fast sometimes\nquicker than an adult so it's going to\ntransfer that reaction is going to be\nquick and they're going to react maybe\nwith the Tantrum or throwing something\nor Screaming or something like that it's\ngoing somewhere if we then go and say to\nthat child that's so naughty you don't\ndo that which is a natural reaction but\nit's a very messy reaction and if we can\nrecognize that that messiness actually\nmakes the mess even bigger if we can say\nokay we don't throw and hurt each other\nthat's not allowed but I see that you're\nbad there's a reason why but for now you\nknow let's just like keep you apart and\neach of you I'm going to work with you\nsit with you different in it at\ndifferent in a different moment we're\nnot together and we'll sort this out and\nyou teach them how to resolve the\nconflict you don't resolve it before\nthem telling them that they naughty go\naway that's bad you don't teach them\nanything you just teach them that they\nthey're bad and that's bad and you can't\nhave emotions and all the distinction\nbetween boundaries starts disappearing\nbecause that child shouldn't have had\ntheir choice stolen in the first place\nand all the things that that we talk\nabout as adults so you can take a simple\nexample like that little messy situation\nand you can change start wiring in a\nresilient psychoneurobiological Network\nMind Body Connection at that young age\nby saying okay let's now sort this out\nso the way you do it the most simplistic\nway for kids young kids is to designate\nan area in your home now think of it\nbetween our teeth in the bathroom we\ndon't clean our teeth in the toilets we\nclean our teeth in the in the Basin we\nwe go outside to kick the ball we go to\ngym to do to a gym environment to do gym\nso we understand the idea of designating\na space for a specific thing why don't\nwe talk about designating a space in our\nhome for dealing with mind because mind\nis everything you do Nicole is mind\nyou're teaching people how to manage\ntheir mind everything about mind and so\nthat if you did you wouldn't do no one\nwould be able to read your book and\nlearn from you in other words mind is\nyour ability to experience and manage\nlife so it's your a priority function so\nif we don't teach mind management from\nday one you can it's never too late but\nit is our priority messy mind messy\nbrain makes your body miss your life so\nif we can designate in area use teach a\nbasic skill so for example you could\ntake like one of my clients did was\npaint a wall in their kitchen with their\nchalkboard pants put a cute little chair\nlike a little bean bag put a little\nbasket of toys and crayons and paper and\nchalk and whatever and you create a\nspace and that's your mind management\nspace or your brain space or your\nneurocycle space or whatever you want to\ncall it and in that space when you as a\nparent are are having a bad day you\nteach the child to yourself because\nmental health has managed the crisis in\nmental health is going to be one of the\nways is helping educate the parent and\nthe adult because then that transfers to\nthe child so you model and go like you\nhave a bad day you come home from work\nor whatever you go to their designated\nspace and you run through this\npsychoneurobiological system that I've\ndeveloped called neuropsychology I know\nwe'll unpack the you know it's very\nsimple in a moment trying to paint the\nsort of big picture first and then when\nthe child's having a bad day they can go\nto that area if a child's two and they\ncan't talk about how a child bullied\nthem at school because they don't have\nthe language yet they do have the\nInsight kids are a lot more insightful\nthan you realize they read body language\nbetter than an adult and they respond to\nauthenticity so by you being authentic\nand not pathologizing or suppressing\nwhat you're going through you've allowed\nthem to experience an emotion experience\nand experience with emotions with\nbehaviors Etc and you've demonstrated a\nmodel so your child comes home from\nschool they know they can go to that\ndesignated space you've opened the door\nfor conversation did meaningful\nconnection and they can then start the\nprocess now in the book I'm sure you saw\nthat there's a character that we've\ncreated called brainy you've even got a\nlittle toy there's a little toy it's a\nlittle brain I love them\nwe'll be sending you one of these so\nit's super cute it's easy to hold but\nit's a brain and kids love the brain\nthey love anything physical so you are\nhelping to fix brainy's brain so this is\nyour superhero that walks the mental\nhealth Journey with you and the\nneuropsychology is his superpowers the\nwhole book goes around brain\nexperiencing life the bigger the small\nthings and what does brainy do and how\ndoes brainy do it and and how does\nwhatever so we've even got a coloring\nbook color with Brady and friends so\nthere's a coloring book scenarios and\nbrain used in there and you can whatever\nso that kind of practical toolbox in the\ndesignated space is fantastic so here\nthe child gets in the car you pick them\nup from daycare they screaming they kick\nin the seat they won't talk to you then\nthey roll up in a little ball you get\nthem inside they run into their room\nrolling a ball they're crying and maybe\nat some point they calm down and maybe\nthis is a repeated pattern so it's\nhappening chronically over time they\ndon't know what to do you can get\nfrustrated it's like it's so annoying\nand frustrating if you've got other kids\nin life is happening and I've got this\nkid who's showing a tantrum so I'm not\nblaming any mom here I've been a mother\nof four and worked all the way through\nit's not easy so we need to get our own\nreactivity under control so the first\nthing that I would do is as the child\ngets in the coin you see this is\nhappening if it's a first off it's kind\nof easier to deal with because hey wow\nwhat's going on but even then if it's a\nfirst off that child may be\num won't they're just they so they're so\nactivated that they you could return\ndecompress them first they won't respond\ntoo much this is where your brain is\ninvaluable something like this a soft\ntoy the physical you know the whole\nholistic concept of you know getting\ngetting touching something so you could\nyou know have the toy available in the\ncar any toy you don't have to have\nbrainy but the concept of having\nsomething that they know is the contact\npoint that they can tell you they can't\nsay the words they can pick up raining\nthe brain is in the car they can grab\nbrainy or you could save you may have\nbrain in the front with you or a toy or\nthey can remember brain if you forgot to\ncarry Brady and you just say oh I see\nBrandy is really upset today brain is\nkicking the seat and brain has got a\ntell me I see brain is holding his tummy\nwhat's wrong with brainy you've you've\ntransferred to the the threat of me and\nI've got to deal with this you know I\ncan now transfer to a toy the child\nimmediately has a connection point and\nthey can tell you yes Brady this and\nthis and this and the child it is\nphenomenal and it's so much family\ntherapy when I was practicing for after\n25 years and the Insight that a child\nhas when you give them the tools to\nspeak\neven if they're not actually speaking\nthey can dramatize visualize Etc so that\nwhole idea of this earning a space\nhaving a a physical thing that you can\nattach to having a standard thing that\nyou can say DR leaf said that the brain\nlady said so it's not you as the mother\nor the father or the caretaker or the\npartner or whatever the the whoever's\ncaretaking the child it's not them\ntelling you to do another thing which\nkids can often resist because it's just\nit's actually hey let's do this look I\ndo this if you doing it they'll do it\nit's a demonstration there's a story in\nthe book I don't know if you saw about\nthe little boy with trauma which is such\na sad story of this child who was abused\nfrom the age sexually and physically\nfrom the age of three months and it was\nactually someone on my research team on\none of my projects who was the stepmom\nand they got the child once child was\nthree and they didn't know this had\nhappened and then all these incredible\nas you can imagine behavioral issues\nbecause this childhood had all this\nabuse for three years long story short\nis that this was a hard tough job for a\nstepmom to step into and to have to deal\nwith this kind of\nthe first child everything that this\nchild could be labeled with was labeled\nlet me tell you this child had\neverything from autism to you name it\neverything in the DSM I think they gave\nthis child out of desperation the doc\ngoing from Doctor to doctor and their\nmother knew this wasn't right this child\ndidn't sleep through the night long\nstory short the mum was so straight\nhaving to work financially strained\nbecause of all the money pouring into\nthis child's therapies she happened to\nbe on my team having to start using the\nneurocycle which is the system that I've\ndeveloped it's not a new therapy\ntechnique it's everything that they\nwould use everything you teach on your\nin your program and your book and\neverything you're teaching in your\nYouTube channel in your private club and\nthat kind of thing it's just put into a\nway that man that aligns with the psycho\nneurobiological networks it's not a news\ntherapy technique it's still all the\nbreathing meditation holistic stuff\num cbtf positive affirmation\npsychodynamic whatever you whatever\nwisdom you've gained it's just if you\nput things into the right psychodynamic\npsycho neurobiological framework you\nactually will create a sustainable\nchange and empower the person to do that\nthat's really key because so many people\nfeel disempowered by being told you've\ngot this by the professional I mean you\ntalk about this so much we want to\nempower people and the younger you start\nthe easier it becomes as an adult\ndoesn't mean bad things aren't going to\nhappen unfortunately doesn't mean that\nchallenges are going to happen covert\nsocial social media that's just part of\nlife okay these challenges what we need\nis to teach our children how to manage\nthose so change will always happen so\nthis whole thing oh kids Mental Health\ncrisis is because of coverts because of\nisolation it's because of social media\nthose are just contributing factors\nthey're not a cover obviously was a\nproblem but social media is not bad it's\nhow you manage the social media bullying\nis not nice but how you manage it is the\nissue you're simply taking your toys not\nnice but it's how you manage the issue\nso the neuroscycle is how you manage\nyour mind and manage issues from the big\nto the small and having that sort of\ndesignated space enables you to then\nprocess through and have a connection\npoint for these meaningful connection\nthat's a long answer but I don't really\nwant to unpack that or whatever yes yes\nI'm actually I'm I'm still having a\ngiggle to myself\num when you acknowledge you know\nchildren I believe is the context that\nyou acknowledge or don't like to I'm\ngoing to simplify it or what I heard\ndon't like to be told what to do don't\nlike to be controlled and I was over\nhere having a giggle because neither do\nadults and it's funny I find how we\nliterally categorize right adults and\nchildren somehow is distinctly different\nwhen in reality we're not us as adults\nthough have just gotten better at\nkeeping the things suppressed not saying\nthem right or or dealing with people\ntrying trying to control us or change us\naround us in different more covert ways\nbut the reality of it is we are still\nmany of us as adults are struggling in\nthe same way we are as children and what\nI find so refreshing and life-changing\nabout your work is not only are you kind\nof talking about children as not\nseparate creatures you're talking about\nthem very much as a part of our own\ndevelopment we were all children one so\nthat we can not only understand\nourselves we can understand the children\naround us but you really do very\npractically then give tools for the same\nissues that children are having we're\nhaving them as adults ourselves many of\nus though are just so conditioned in the\nway we've learned how to deal with them\nthough to speak to your very wise\nbeautiful point and the book that will\nhelp so many parents caregivers of any\nsort change their child's life is the\nearlier that we do intervene and going\nback even to the beginning give language\nright to this whole world of emotions\nemotions are energy we actually don't\nknow why we are wired to experience\ncertain emotions as humans they're in my\nopinion evolutionary Messengers we all\nhave them universally we don't\nuniversally know how to deal with them\nwe don't come right with that that chip\nso everything I'm here you saying is\nreally not only creating the space I\nlove that suggestion of an actual\nphysical space in our home but I love\nhow you're also emphasizing the role of\nmodeling of showing these new actions to\nour children and how important that that\nis especially when we're talking about\nback to this concept now of the mind\nright because this is a very elusive\nthing it controls these emotions which\nfew of us do have language to even talk\nabout them and I really love your\nconcept of thought trees because I think\nthere's a really simplified even visual\nway for many of us that we can either\npaint ourselves the picture or maybe\neven paint the picture for the children\nthat we're going to be helping clean up\ntheir mental mess what it what is a\nthought tree and can you describe that\nbeautiful way I think that you\nillustrate this connection between our\nbrain our mind and the rest of our\nphysical self or our body absolutely I\nlove how you just said everything you\nsaid it was it was beautiful those those\nemotions we're going to explain the\nthought chain I'm going to bring it back\nto the emotions and how we can visualize\nI mean just think of a tree any looking\nwe all know what it looks like so we can\njust visualize a tree if we think of\nwhat we are doing right now in this\nconversation we're both communicating\npeople are watching and listening so\nthere's auditory sound waves and\nelectromagnetic black waves so bear with\nme I'm going to give you a little bit of\nscience which I know you love and I know\na lot of people\nand you and basically um that that all\nthose electromagnetic sound waves light\nwaves and the auditory sound waves that\nis energy and that is nothing nothing\nweird it's energy and that energy is\nsomething that your mind grabs because\nyour mind is actually energy it's\nelectromagnetic like waves it's that's\nthe biofield around us it's very real\nwhen you die it goes and everything\ndisintegrates so that literally can be\ncalled the life force your aliveness\nit's how you function as a human if you\nare dead your brain is disintegrating\nyour body is disintegrating you're not\nexperiencing life so to when they say\nNicole that in a lot of scientists will\nsay that the mind is the hard question\nof Science and what does it feel like to\nbe a batch you know David Charles Thomas\nthing and whatever I always say no that\nis the most obvious question of science\nbecause the mere fact that you can\nactually ask that question shows\nevidence of mind because mind is the\ndriving force you are making eight\nhundred thousand to a million new cells\nright now as you and I look at each\nother and the people that are listening\nand viewing every second if you were\ndead you couldn't make those so what is\nthat life force it's this force that\nenables our brain our body everything to\nrun and in that process our mind is also\nnot only running the heart running the\nbrain it's also taking in your\nexperiences and 95 is taken in\nunconsciously and goes in and it\nliterally goes in as a wave think of\nwaves of the sea if there's a wave of\nenergy that goes in it creates an\nelectromagnetic light force it activates\nfrequencies of energy in the brain Delta\nsay that all for better gamma and it\nalso changes the neurochemistry of the\nbrain that then sends a signal to your\nheart to a hypothalamic the whole thing\nis activated by our discussion this is\ngoing on all day long now this wave\ncomes in and then it builds like it does\non the beach and then it crashes and\nmakes little waves and then it repeats\nthe cycle so every like burst of\ninformation that I'm giving you is these\nwaves building and crashing a child's\nyou've experience of waves building and\ncrashing it's the mind that grabs the\nwave directs it to the brain and body\nand then creates this crashing effect\nthe crashing effect\ncauses a genetic response I mean we get\na genetic response from every basically\nbuilding is little proteins that are\nmade of amino acids so just think of\nlittle proteins building blocks and they\nbuild into these little long things and\nthey grow together and cluster and grow\ntrees but their like a tree starts with\nroots that's our original source so the\nsource of the experience in this\nsituation now what I'm saying in the\nquestions you're asking in the\nconversation would be the roots all the\nlisteners are processing that's the tree\ntrunk they're unique Works no one no one\nprobes no one thinks feels and chooses\nin the same way and the branches that\nthey grow which are happening is all\nhappening kind of simultaneously are\ndifferent for every listener so though\nyou have thousands of listeners the root\nsystem will look the same but the\nbranches will be different because of\nyour interpretation now that's what's\nhappening all day every day to humans\nwhatever age you're at and that's\nbuilding into trees in the brain at the\nsame time as it builds into trees in the\nbrain it's building into fabric into\nliterally like vibrations in your in\nyour in your bio field and through your\nbody so you've got this physical\nstructure with vibrations in it each\nlittle protein holds the memories so\nmemory is like a vibration in a little\nprotein sounds complicated but the\nenergy is but it's also quite simple\njust think of a vibration in branches\ngrowing lots of little lots of little\nproteins making branches at the same\ntime\nin our bio in the mind we've got if you\nlook at a podcast and you see the little\nlines forming that's kind of a visual\nyou can use for the memory the thought\ntree in the mind so in the brain it\nlooks like a tree in the mind it looks\nlike a like a podcast vibration whatever\nthe little lines and in your body it\nlooks like a change in what we call the\ncytoskeleton on the cell so when you\nteach so much about how you can feel it\nin your body that is because as the Mind\nforms the mem The Poetry in the mind and\nthen in the brain it then forms it in\nthe body in that sequence mind brain\nbody the body holds everything slightly\ndifferently to the way that the brain\ndoes but it's in the cytoskeleton of the\ncell it's called a microtubule and it's\nalso made of a special protein so if we\nsell them we have 37 to 100 trillion\ncells so always surprised at our PTAC\nreactions are we surprised that that in\na child that has been rigged it was\nwired in as their child was being abused\nthat story in my book that I just told\nyou about\num that was wired into these three\nplaces and I'm emphasizing using that\nbecause that is why I think is\nexperiences become embodied and why we\nneed to do the breath work and why we\nneed to do all the different stages so\nall of that coalesces and\num and then we we had the stuff and then\nwe in life and that and we are working\nfrom what we've wired in 95 we're not\neven aware of so our networks are also\nlooking to protect us because for\nsurvival so what we find is that it's\nsearching where are the toxic looking\ntrees because the healthy trees will\nlook like beautiful green trees and the\ntoxic experiences or these ugly looking\ntrees it visualize whatever I literally\nwant and you can teach this to a child\ntake them into nature show them some\ntrees and say that and tell them that\nthat tree Grew From The Roots and you\ncould grow a tree I give lots of\nexamples get a little seed and grow the\nthing and whatever show them a pretty\ntree and an ugly tree tell them take if\nthey've had a great experience\num say that that's the great look at\nthat beautiful tree there that's choose\nwhich one you like that's the great\nexperience when you went to your friend\nand they had the party that's all the\nroots and then how you how you enjoyed\nthe party those are the branches look\nhow happy that is and then remember when\nyou were when you were bullied and you\nhad that horrible teacher who shouted at\nyou and made you sad and the kids teased\nyou that was the roots and then this is\nhow it made you feel that's what kids\nrelate to that really quickly and you\nsaid that's what's growing in your brain\nand you know what you can change that to\nthat ugly looking tree you can go and\ndig after the spade and you can go and\nput plant food on the root food on the\nroots and you can regrow the tree that\nenergy thing we spoke about at the\nbeginning of the interview and the\nenergy never gets lost it gets\ntransferred so that toxic tree if you\nput the heal the roots the energy now\ngoes into the healthy treat so it now\nre-heals in the toxic part or the Ugly\nTree becomes very small and the big tree\nbecomes very big though that's the kind\nof language that you can use as a child\nand they understand that that's what I\ndid for years in my practice and in\nFamily Therapy and you know I'm just\nthinking of the work that you teach so\nmuch on going back to the inner child\nand you know going maintenance finding\neverything to do with your attack\nmanagement styles and all these things\nyou can do you can this is where this\nyou could as an adult this is we've ever\nhad an adult saying hey they're using\nthis to do inner child work would you go\nback into the trauma from childhood and\ngoing back but is it almost like you're\nadults they don't like to do an adult\nsoftware but this um these visuals can\nactually help take you to that point you\ncan get into your child very easily\nusing this so I've done that in therapy\ntoo I've literally used the child\nlanguage to help a person get into that\nstate and then to be able to rebuild\nagain so that's just kind of that's the\nconcept of the thought trees are just so\nvisual so powerful and so easy to be\nable to understand so I'm sitting here\nlistening and I keep repeating a line\nthat you said that really just was\nreally striking to me and it was\nacknowledging I think the way you worded\nit was\num we all think feel and choose\ndifferently and I really want to just\nlet that sink in or just have a moment\nfor everyone to just hear that because\nagain I think this is another area where\nwe don't some of us will even fight that\nreality we have this idea that we could\nlive the same experience as our partners\nas our sibling you know as our loved\nones and we somehow assume that we're\nall going to think the same way about it\nwe're all going to felt the same way\nabout it and typically we should choose\nthe same thing because my my choice\nright is the right choice and your\nchoice is the wrong choice and of course\nI'm really simplifying it but I love how\nyou're highlighting the uniqueness in\neach of us that how that is not this the\nthe reality so many of us can live and\nmany of us have experienced this in our\nown families of origin where I know for\nme I have two siblings who our lived\nexperience in childhood was drastically\ndifferent around the physical presence\nof my mom the attentional presence of my\nmom other circumstances in terms of the\nfamily finances and different things\nthat were happening I lived a very\ndifferent experience and a very\ndifferent relationship with my family\nbecause of the difference in ages not\nbecause we came in the same environment\ndid not make it the same experience for\neach of us but the reason I'm not only\npulling out your beautiful you know\nacknowledgment for all of us to listen\nto and allow that to maybe embrace it\nand sink in though it's touching on I\nlove again back to this visual of the\ntrees right and I can understand now why\nmany of us into adulthood and why\nbeginning in childhood is so impactful\nall of these reverberations right the\nmore they become practiced over time or\njust repeat it outside of our awareness\nthe more they do become solidified into\nour identity and you speak very\nbeautifully about childhood you know and\nthe hypothetical place where our\nidentities begin to come to life right\nwhere we supposedly have the safety and\nthe space and parents who are tuned\naround us and interested in us to be\ncurious about our developing sense of\nself but again going back to when we did\nnot have that in childhood some of us\nthese trees that might not be as quote\nunquote pretty as we would like them to\nbe become our identity and you I want to\nread out an actual line that you write\nabout in childhood when we're talking\nabout this developing identity of\nchildren now\nwhen a child loses their sense of self\nit can result in feelings of bitterness\nrage aggression anxiety worry self-pity\nEnvy Pride jealousy cynicism\nhopelessness and depression this isn't\njust a child being naughty or difficult\nthey are going through an identity\ncrisis I just wanted to highlight that\nagain and really wondering what you know\nyou would be willing to speak to in\nterms of just identity I know it's a\nhuge topic but in terms of again this\nchildhood experience and how you know\nthese moments of identity crisis do come\nout for so many of us because you\ntouched on this a bit earlier too\nparents have reactions when children\nhave reactions you know especially when\nthere's many children running around in\nother obligations even outside of\nchildren that adults parents caregivers\nhave to contend with we have our own\nfeelings about it so bringing that up in\nthe context of when a child is you know\nbehaving jealously or you know in a fit\nof rage these are the moments I think\nthat really much elicits sometimes a\nreaction from us but here hearing you\nactually describing those moments those\nemotions as a marker right as an\nindicator of this lost sense of self so\ncan you say a bit more about that\nabsolutely it's it's really I love\ntalking about this because it's\nwe always hear so much about identity\nbut the fact that we can actually look\nat what our identities do you can train\na child to actually look at how the\nidentity is being impacted through\nlooking at four categories of signals\nyou can train someone from a young is a\nway of preempting what will naturally\nhappen like as you say different age\nchildren different lifestyle experiences\nthat the parents are going through\ntrying to maybe maybe you maybe not do\nthe\nthey based hopefully most of the time\nit's doing their best but you know it's\ndifferent circumstances and how the\nchildren perceive it if we can give the\nchild an ability to recognize when the\nself is being invaded or being disrupted\nor being broken down and you can do that\nwith kids as young as two and three then\nyou can help to rebuild immediately so\nkids are more insightful than what we've\ngiven them credit for the new research\ncoming out and you'll you'll work very\nit's very clear\num the whole thing of they must be seen\nand not heard and all that kind of stuff\nand they don't understand and dumb\nthings down is the worst thing that we\ncan do obviously there's language\nadaption and that sort of adaptation of\nlanguage and so on but they are\ninsightful they know when something's\nnot right even from the age of a few\nmonths old they can start picking up\nwhen things are not right so that's very\ninteresting they also like authenticity\nthey relate to authenticity they're very\nauthentic kids and as humans we also\nthese are not things that we don't like\nas adults but they are very much there\nwe kind of think walking City and\ninsight are adult things but they're not\nthe kid things too they just change as\nwe as you become more experienced\num so they and they really respond very\nwell to modeling they also read\nnon-verbal language better than a\nnon-verbal communication which is 50 of\ncommunication way better than adults so\nif you don't explain to a child\num if you're mad or whatever reactive or\nhaving a moment because of life that\nthey will immediately take that into\nthemself and think there's something\nwrong with them and if you are using\nthings like you are bad you are language\nsomething that I always try and say to\nparents don't use you are with strong\nadjectives like you are always you are\nnever these are are will be absorbed by\nthe child and will wire in as part of\nthe identity and it may seem subtle and\nyou may not have meant it in the moment\nbut if you're not authentic about why\nyou said that that won't go away that\nwill just cement and then every time\nsomething happens that's negative it\nwill just build on that so the identity\nis getting crushed and the self and the\nself-value that I factor which is the\ndriving force nature nurture charges are\ndriven by the eye factor which is our\nidentity us our our eye factors for me\nis like critical we have to constantly\nrecognize when that effect is\nfunctioning and the eye factor is gonna\nis wisdom it's a child is wisdom but\nalways astounded me when I work with\nfamily therapy is that you can and\nunderstand periods now we get so kind of\nexcited to say this that I can hardly\nget my words out but the wisdom in a\nchild when you sit with your own issues\nand you actually say I'm so sorry I\ndidn't mean to yell at you when I walked\nin the front door but I'm having my I'm\nso frustrated I yelled at you my my\nshoulders are so sore and they I'm just\nyelling and frustrations in my shoulders\nand I just hate life today you've told\nkids four signals and you've told them\nhow you feel you've gathered awareness\nwhich is the first step of the neuro\ncycle I'm going to link this to Identity\nyou've told him how you feel you've told\nthem what you're doing your actions\nyou've told them your perspective and\nyou've told them what it feels like in\nyour body you've created an embodied\nexperience you as an adult haven't\npathologized or medicalized or\nsuppressed you've actually accepted and\nsaid sorry and you've started giving\nthem a model maybe you go to the\ndesignated space in your house and you\ndo this or you walk over to that space\nthen you say you're clicked you go to\nthe next step so the first thing is just\nto get the awareness of those four\nsignals then you're going to reflect and\nreflection and I'm going to link it to\nour density now is why why am I feeling\nlike this I had such a lassy day and\nI've had so many lousy days and I really\ndon't like my boss and I really don't\nlike being so busy or whatever it may be\nso you've done a bit of why and then you\ngo over to that Blackboard idea or you\ngrab a piece of paper however you work\nit out but be like designated space and\ndraw some pictures if it's a young child\nmaybe with a sad face Maybe put some\nwords as well teach even if they're\nnon-verbal or no they're not right to\nreading it they're not um they're not\nlittered yet still write the word with\nthe picture because you're teaching the\nword letter Association so you're\nactivating reading you're generating\ncuriosity you then as you've gone\nthrough this process you've activated so\nmuch neuroscientific stuff in the brain\nand neurophysiology you've created a\nsituation where your brain your psycho\nneurobiological mind brain body networks\nvery tuned in you've brought all kinds\nof activation\num things networks app that you can use\nto guide you you've created a situation\nfor change to happen you've also created\nDP for connection you've also booked\nyour child's identity because you've now\nvalued them as a human you've said you\nyou're honoring them enough that you can\nbe authentic to them to tell them how\nyou feel and why you feel like that and\nthen you're sitting down and you're\nshowing them so you're modeling but\nyou're also being authentic you're\nyou're drawing on the inside so you're\nbuilding their value building their\nself-esteem and then you go to the\nfourth step which is to recheck together\nand rechecking is can this happen and I\ndon't know what I should do and let me\nlook at this differently and kids will\nbe will Astound you at the wisdom that\nthey'll come up with in those moments\nand then you just you know you draw over\nthe board and that's the fourth step\nwhere you you've collapsed everything on\nthe page or on the board on the talk\nwhatever however you've done it now\nyou're re-checking you're reorganizing\nyou reconceptualizing you're looking at\npatterns you don't have to solve The\nWorld's crisis it's quick it's simple\nand then you're going to do a little\naction you close off the cycle with an\naction that's how your brain works on\nthese waves the way it builds it gets a\nCrest it crashes makes little waves goes\nback in that's what the neuro cycle is\ndoing it's doing the cycle the cyclic\nprocess we really what we do naturally\nin our non-conscious mind which drives\nour conscious mind and our subconscious\nmind which is a portal we bring that\ninto the conscious mind so you're\nbringing a tick a system that is up\ndriving us you following that system\nwhich increases increases your Insight\nenables you to see things that go there\nengages the child values their identity\nyour identity is built through that now\ntake that situation out and if you just\nstay yelling at the child and you didn't\nexplain what it was or you just suppress\nit or you just glossed over and went on\nor you disappeared to your room or came\nback or you just didn't talk to the\nchild they're going to be seen as oh\nthere's something wrong with me I'm bad\nI've done something wrong if your\nchild's throwing a tantrum and you say\nto them you being bad you are go to your\nroom you've you've attached you've\naffected identity because and even\nthough you may feel like I just can't\ncope that's not that you are bad they're\ngonna think oh what's the point I'm just\na bad person identity is bad whereas if\nyou say hey what you're doing isn't\ngreat\nand sometimes beds got to pop out it's\nnot the greatest word to use but what\nyou but if you can say what you're doing\nisn't great it's really upsetting me and\nIt's upsetting you and it's upsetting\nthe whole family\ncan you can we just go into our space\nand that's why I love these designated\nspaces and kids will respond to that so\nthat we can sort this out and that's\nthat's that's kind of the idea of\nfunctioning so now you've identified\nyou've given you've validated that the\nchild's frustrated or whatever you\nvalidated that you're not always going\nto be happy you validate that bad things\ncan happen that you can feel for us and\nthat's okay but and but that's you've\nkept the value and identity in place\nbecause you're not saying you are you're\nsaying I see you are in this moment\nacting in a certain way so you've moved\nfrom the in the this the stamp you know\nthe stuck the what is it the this is it\nfinal no change a description and that\nall builds identity Now by that modeling\nyou then go into the deepest things so\nlet's say you're in a very religious\nenvironment and you've been told that\ncertain lifestyles are wrong which is\nsomething that I know you've had to deal\nwith and I know a lot of people I deal\nwith a lot of in my practice I talked\nwith a lot of that and you get so many\nletters like that that's also identity\nhow does a child then work through those\nkinds of things that that's not bad that\nthat's who you are that can crush us or\nyou maybe let's move away from from the\nmost obvious sort of gender roles and\nand sexuality which is such a huge\nproblem in identity it's it's massive as\nyou and I don't have to even talk about\nthe numbers it's so big but that's a\nreally big identity issue\num I think about of my own in my within\nmy own family my son is gay and I have\npermission to share this and he I put\nthem in a religious school I shouldn't\neven have done that but his identity got\nreally crashed him he had to work\nthrough the signals and whatever and\nsort that all out and you know so there\nwas that's all there happening then you\nsee in so many situations where a child\ncould be the new kid at school they've\nput glasses on maybe they a bit more\nGorky because they're taller they've\ngrown quicker than the others and they\nthey get bullied for you know so all\nthese situations if we can have created\na system that is I can go I can do this\nthis and this and within the first step\nof gather awareness you're dealing with\nfour signals emotions behaviors\nperspective and bodily Sensations\nthere's many different techniques out\nthere to pull on each of those and each\nyou can say four sentences and then you\ncan take each I feel anxious what about\nthe anxiety let's Dig Down Deeper into\nthe levels of those emotions what other\nemotions behaviors what you're saying\nwhat you do that's one statement I am\nangry I mean I'm sorry I am kicking the\nchair or I am withdrawing but let's go\ndeeper what other how are you saying\nthings how are you speaking so you can\nDig Down Deeper then we can say then\nwe've got content to say why reflect\nthen we've got content to know if that's\nopen but the the tree into the conscious\nmind weaken all the branches so it's\nmalleable I'm getting down to the origin\nSource I'm getting to the root and you\ncan use whatever technique other\ntechniques in The Gather awareness of\nthose four signals in the The Reflex all\nfive steps you can bring in all kinds of\ntechniques things like CBT techniques\nand visualization visualization works\ngreat at C3 CBT techniques with grade\nsix five but they don't work well at\nleast in one and why am I saying that if\nyou want to change you have to drive\npsychoneurobiologically quick in the\nright direction and what's happened is\nthere's so much great advice out there\nbut it's hodgepodge people are using a\nbit of meditation here a bit of this\nthere bit of that there and I'm sure\nyou've seen the research Nicole that if\nyou just bring things up into the\nconscious mind if you just make people\naware of something and you don't do\nsomething with it they get worse it's\nlike trying to fly a plane if you don't\nknow how to fly if you only know how to\ntake to um to make a plane take off but\nyou don't know how to fly or crash so\nwhat we do with a lot of techniques is\npeople are taking off and they're\ncrashing or people fly but they crash so\nwe want to get it coordinated because if\nwe crash it also affects our density if\nI try that and it doesn't work what's\nwrong with me meditation works for my\nfriends why is it not working for me\nthat breathing technique what's wrong\nwith me that I can't close my eyes when\nI'm breathing doing a meditation I\nremember that's something you and I\ndiscuss in one of the interviews I did\nwith you some people can't close their\neyes because it freaks them out and\nthat's okay you know but then people\nwill say well I've done these things\nit's affected identity kids are seeing\naround them the curated lives on social\nmedia why can't I do that affecting\nidentity scrolling through social media\nif we can teach our kids AI all of the\nstuff that we can teach our kids hey as\nsoon as you look at something or as soon\nas you read something as soon as you\nexperience something how are you feeling\nwhat's it in your body what are your\nbehaviors what is your perspective why\nwrite that down reach it what's the\npattern where's the origin what's the\nsource\nwhat can you do right now in this moment\nto get you through the rest of this\nafternoon so you can do your homework\nyou build on that skill you can re you\ncan help a child catch the identity\nissues quite early on and then rebuild\nfrom there I always want long answers oh\nI love I love I'm shaking my head very\nvigorously I'm just loving what you're\nsharing because you're really talking up\nas I language at building that bridge\nstraight from insight into action which\nreally again if I'm going to simplify\nagain it is really honoring the embodied\nexperience I'm even thinking about that\nparent that you described right being\nhonest with their child in that moment\nyes I yelled I am sorry here's what was\ngoing on inside of me and those are\nmoments that I think again for personal\nreasons because we feel shameful because\nwe didn't learn in our own childhood how\nto even acknowledge what is even\nhappening to have those self-reflective\nmoments to even give language to our\nchild to again this idea that children\nare not developmentally you know able to\ntolerate the reality of what's Happening\ncompletely though overstepping the\nreality that they're tolerating it\nanyway though without our right\nexplanation our language and to go back\nto what you were sharing they will in\ntheir own minds make their own sense of\nit and all roads will lead back to some\nstatement based on their identity so all\nof the parents listening again it is of\nsuch great value to be honest in those\nmoments because our children are sensing\nand sometimes are on the receiving end\nof our explosions right of our\nimplosions and this is really bringing I\nthink a great place before we end our\nconversation here because this to me is\nTiny tying my brain to what you talk\nabout in the book which is the concept\nof resilience right and you write an\nabsolutely beautiful line this all goes\nback to right this idea of identity\nright and who am I and I can have all\nthese embodied experiences but can I\ncreate space to be curious and discover\nthis self a self that over time can\nbecome resilient reminding all the\nlisteners right resilience is simply our\nability to deal with stress upsetting\nremote and other upsetting emotions to\nbe able to a rebound to be able to come\nback and be calm and be grounded and\ntune into ourselves and what we need to\ndo instinctually so that is essentially\nwhat resilience is and you write in your\nbook I think it is so beautiful you\nwrite a line that says protecting our\nprotecting our children means teaching\nthem how to manage life even when we are\nno longer there to protect them I'm\ngonna read this again because it's so\nbeautiful protecting our children means\nteaching them how to manage life even\nwhen we are no longer there to protect\nthem and in my opinion again this is\nwhat resilience is that ability and\nagain this is another area not being a\nparent myself I can't imagine how it is\nto even call to mind this awareness that\nthere will come a time where you aren't\nable to be physically present right\nemotionally present to help your child\nor support them there will come a time\nwhere they are on their own right and\nthat again I could not agree more I'm\nhaving chills as I'm reading this in my\nopinion that is what this work is about\nParenthood especially is actually\nimparting the tool so that our children\ncan right explore themselves so can you\nsay a little bit about kind of how this\nprogression then in your opinion leads\nus into and what you what what your mind\nsays about resilience and and what it\nmeans to you and to children in general\noh I love how you phrase it it also\ngives me chills that my span too because\nit actually thank you for highlighting\nthat and and resilience is something\nthat's actually in us we are literally\nour resilient beings but it's it's it's\ngot to be unmasked so through the\nthrough the challenges of life we end\nmasks so if we bubble wrap our kids like\nthe character philosophy is very\npredominant don't you know any emotion\nis bad and there's something clinically\nwrong with your child if they have\ndepression not depression and anxiety or\nintrusive thoughts these are your best\nfriend because the enemy got to teach\nour kids I said these are your best\nfriend because if you're feeling a bit\ndepressed they're not illnesses or brain\ndiseases which is just not even science\nthey are actually informational messages\nyou mentioned Messengers before I talk\nabout them as informational warning\nsignals it's the same thing so we can\nteach a child that okay I don't feel so\ngreat now I'm actually feeling really\nsad I don't even get out of bed I don't\nwant to talk to anyone that is okay it's\nokay to be a mess it's a message let me\nbe curious about that depression let me\ndive in deep when you do that you start\nunmasking the natural resilience that's\ninside of you and you start seeing that\nchallenge and you're more easily able\nresilience will look like this if the\ndepression you're feeling so depressed\nyou can't get out of bed you're just so\nanxious every time you do socially\ninteract with people because of what\nhappened at school or whatever the case\nmay be then those periods get shorter\nand shorter so resilience reduces the\nfeeling of of the depression going to\nthis level where it's out of balance\nresilience means as I practice going\nthrough the challenges of life I drop\ndown but I get back so much quicker so\nmaybe before I stage it for this long\nand now I'm doing this and it's not\ngoing down so much so I'm still going to\nget depressed good it's message it's an\ninformational signal and that's huge in\nresilience and Nicole to teach children\nnot to be scared of those so-called bad\nemotions and I'll even go as fast to say\nthere are no bad emotions and that links\nto me very much ties into the concept of\nresilience the other side of resilience\nand I agree with you all that you know\nbeing able to bounce back the science of\nresilience shows that it's unmasked and\nif we tell a child that the emotions are\nbad you mask you don't develop so\nunmasking means I can now see it and now\nI can grow it but you can't grow it the\nchild has to grow it all you can do is\nprompt the process of yes it's okay and\nthat's where the modeling and everything\nis spoken about is allowing the child to\ndevelop that skill of resilience I mean\ndevelop the unmasking and then sorry to\nunmask and then develop the skill we've\ngot to let them practice they have to go\nthrough the other side is that we most\npeople do the statistics show we'll\nbounce back pretty quickly and those\nthat take a little bit longer that's\nokay eventually you will get there\nthe beautiful side of resilience is a\nvery interesting side of resilience\nthat's very easy to grow and the\nneurocycle can be used for that as well\nas five-step process is also focus on\nthe good stuff remember the example of\nthe tree I gave where you've got the\nbeautiful tree and you focused on that\nfirst whenever if you're going through\nthe day this is for humans not just for\nkids and something great comes back like\nevery time I think of a conversation\nwith you I'm always and then I love your\nwork whatever so I'm using it this as an\nexample so if I think back to our\nconversations that's a good happy tree\nthat's a great curious deep thinking\nchallenging the tree that I enjoy to go\nand visit so if if you're popping my\nmind in this conversation I'm not going\nto just let it gloss over I'm not gonna\njust get it pass by in two seconds I'm\ngonna take 10 or 20 or 30 or even 60\nseconds to just gather awareness how did\nI feel what was my bodily sensation what\nwas my quickly go through those four\nsignals because those four signals are\nlike balloons and they are attached to\nthis tree and this tree is going to come\nfrom my non-conscious into my\nconsciousness month so as I oh hang on\nthat conversation then I dive in deep\nwhy did I enjoy that conversation and I\nmay not be in a place where I can write\nthings down but I can visualize like I'm\ntaking an iPhone maybe like a video on\nmy phone I can in the video I can recall\nin my mind I can watch as I'm watching\nyou and I and that in itself is doing\ntremendous things in the brain to build\nresilience and I'm going to make my\npoint now and then I can recheck okay\nwhat can I do what can I learn from this\nI learned so much more about Identity or\nwhatever and then action ah that was a\ngreat I love that moment kind of to go\nfirst up on the sentence that could take\nme 30 seconds to a minute I have just\npulled on a memory that is now grown\nbigger whatever you think about the most\ngross so I've created a bud not a memory\na bunch of memories there's\nconversations at least three thousand\nbits of memory at the moment in a full\ntree I've pulled that up it's great and\nit's healthy as I'm thinking about it\nit's generating an energetic change\ninside the psycho neurobiological\nNetwork that is very positive you know\nwhen you grow ivy you generally have to\ngrow it on a lattice first okay so this\nis what these kind of grab a good moment\nand grow from but you're growing a\nlattice so when you go into a situation\nthis conversation may be completely\nunrelated to some kind of challenge that\nI may be facing in the next 24 hours but\nbecause I did this consistently and\nwhatever I've now developed the skill of\nunmasking my resilience and I'm wiring\nin all this very healthy strength into\nthe psychoneurobiological network and\nthat will help me get this back quicker\nand that should teach with kids from\nYoung so it's a skill we can develop\ndoes that make sense oh my gosh I I am\nloving this so much I'm I'm really\nloving you highlighting\num the reality that we do have this\ninternal you know reservoir uh we are\nable we are capable and again we have\nlearned and I love your description too\nbecause the number one thing that I had\nheard most commonly when I was seeing\nclients is actual verbalization of that\nfear especially those that fell into the\ndepths of a depression or you know were\nso anxiety-ridden that they literally\ncouldn't leave the home or agoraphobic\nright they would actually these clients\nwould voice to me that exact concern I\nam so afraid to feel any version of\nsadness or worry or anxiety because I'm\nso afraid of falling into that depth\nagain and not being able to come out or\nreally simply not feeling resilient\nenough to right kind of come back up\nlike you were using that that beautiful\num that Visual and when we have and it's\nunderstandable it's natural and we have\nreached the depth of suffering or had\nlived in an experience that was so\npainful why would any of us want to go\nback and our mind will then have that\nmemory and I love how you're now\nshifting Focus because I think these are\nthe small ways that we can begin to\ncreate such significant change though\nthese are the small moments that I'll at\nleast speak for myself I override of\nmany positive you know I I hate using\nthose type of qualifiers that's joyful\nlight right thoughts can come into my\nhead multiple times a day but the\nquestion though is how much time am I\nspending on them am I so likely just to\nbe like oh that was nice on to the next\nthought which might not be as nice or am\nI actually hitting that pause and I\ncan't help but I know we've woven while\nthe book is about helping our children\nright clean up our mental mess I'm\nholding it up again so much of this has\nconversation has been the theme too of\nparents and again I can't help or being\nthe the adult right because we have that\nchild inside of us and when we are\ninteracting with our children I can't\nhelp but think how so much of these\npractical tools that are in the pages of\nthe book are so helpful for the parents\nthemselves too whether it's highlighting\nthese positive moments or these joyful\nmoments and spending a bit more time on\nthem whether it's the suggestion that\nyou beautifully gave earlier having an\nactual place in our home to designate to\nthe reality that this whole lived\nexperience of being human is beyond just\nthe thoughts in our mind it's the\nfeelings in our body it's you know kind\nof all of this other stuff that many of\nus do struggle to give words to to use\nthese unpractical suggestions of\nmodeling through your very beautiful\nneuro cycle these actual steps how much\nvalue all of us listening whether or not\nwe are in care of children or not and\nalso I guess highlighting I think it's\nimportant to acknowledge the difficulty\nright if we are an adult right and we\nmuch might very well intention to pick\nup this very beautiful book that you're\nyou know it will be published very soon\nwe might be reading this book and we\nmight struggle in those moments we might\nstruggle to embody our own feelings we\nmight struggle to embody and to speak\nour own truth we might be strong\njuggling as well not because anything is\nwrong with us not because we're a quote\nunquote a bad parent but because again\nno one gave us these tools ourself in\nour own childhood and I just want to\nemphasize that because again so many\nwell-intentioned parents out there I\nimagine right we jump to these books and\nwe imagine oh it's going to be so easy\nI'm just going to apply these protocols\nright and create this change but the\nreality of it is we are an embodied\ncreature applying these tools and if\nwe're not able to model them ourselves\nit's going to be incredibly difficult to\nthen gift these tools to our children\nthough as we do begin to model these\ntools for ourselves life-changing impact\nin my opinion that it can have on our\nchildren well it does it changes them\nand I'm so glad you mentioned about sort\nof the time frame it's it's I always say\nto people because you know you know part\nof the work I do is looking at habit\nformation and the time frames and we\nknow that it doesn't happen in 21 days\nthat's kind of common knowledge and it\ntakes around about 60 59 to 66 days to\nbuild to change the second\nneurobiological Network so these are pet\nnames all life with your child's life\nthat is a pet means it's it's chronic\nit's the it's there for a period of time\nand it's disruptive you're not going to\nfix this in one eurocycle you it's going\nto take a diligent guided planned daily\n5 to 15 minutes maybe a little longer\neach day for around about nine weeks and\nyou may think I don't have nine weeks\nbut my challenge to Oyster out there\num Nicole is for people to recognize hey\nthis may you may not have nine weeks but\nin night your brain's changing every\nmoment so is your child's brain and\nlife's still happening so either you can\ndirect the process and then in nine\nweeks time you've radically changed a\nlife as identity Etc you've built a tool\nyou've activated resilience or you're\njust care on doing what you do it's\nchanging anyway so my whole thesis is\nokay well don't you want to direct the\nchange and use all the great wisdom you\nhave put it in a framework that actually\ndoes change the psycho neurobiological\nNetwork which changes a person's life\nand that's where mental health can come\nout of so I just wanted to throw that in\nthere oh I love this I think this is a\nbeautiful place to end with such an\nempowering message from you DR leaf\nbecause that that is again in my opinion\nthe reality right is that so many of us\nit is a matter of unearthing right\nunearthing this resilience unearthing\nthese small moments of empowerment that\nvery few of us feel we have in our daily\nlife but we can begin right through\ntools and conversations like you and I\nare having tools like we'll be within\nthe pages of your book how to help your\nchild clean up their mental mess a guide\nto building resilience and managing\nmental health and in my opinion and my\nhope that the field itself and again\nthis is a deeper conversation for a\ndifferent time but my hope is with you\ncontinuing to put out the work and so\nmany other humans beautifully shifting\nthis Focus My Hope Is that we do see a\ngreater paradigm shift in the field of\nitself into a more holistic way to\nunderstand speak about and manage if you\nwill mental Wellness in general so thank\nyou thank you thank you as always for\ndoing your part in leading what I\nbelieve is a world-changing revolution\nI'm honored to be a part
