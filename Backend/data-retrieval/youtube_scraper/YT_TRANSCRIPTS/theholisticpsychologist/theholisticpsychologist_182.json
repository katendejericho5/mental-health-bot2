    "transcript": "another possibility is I continue to do\nthe work and you don't change and I\nreally accept one of the most difficult\nthings to accept because you know we're\nreally accepting Kevin that our mom or\ndad didn't change that they weren't who\nwe wanted or needed them to be right and\nthat's huge so when I really am going\nthere because it's not just accept that\nyou know your love your partner won't\nchange or no like this acceptance is so\nat our core it's visceral it really is\nabout us mourning our earliest\nrelationships and all the unmet needs\nand things that didn't happen that\nshowed up or maybe things that happened\nthat shouldn't have or whatever it is\nfor us right until we give ourselves\nthat space it is that deep it is that\nbig we are that unable to just allow\npeople to be who they are though the\nbyproduct again of the safety of the\nsecurity of the confidence that we\ncreate in ourselves and of us creating\nthe space to feel all of the different\nways about the parent who didn't meet\nour needs about the partner who's not\nnow meeting our needs about ourselves\nfor continuing to create these Dynamics"
