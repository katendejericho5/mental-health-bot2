    "transcript": "anxious attachment and I use sexual\nconnection to feel valued loved and\nneeded I had unpredictable parents so I\nhave a high need for reassurance usually\nthrough sex when you pull away or don't\nwant to be physical it feels like you\ndon't love me anymore I'm avoidant\nattachment and sex is overwhelming to me\nat times and is generally not really\nimportant to me I had emotionally absent\nparents and I've learned to be hyper\nindependent sexual connection sometimes\nfeels weird to me and instead of\nbringing me closer to my partner\nsometimes it actually makes me Retreat\nand I get more and more anxious and\nstart asking questions about what's\ngoing on\nand when I feel pressured to have sexual\nintimacy I shut down even more because\nit feels like it's being forced on me so\nI start withholding all affection\nand when I see you retreating I push\nharder to have sexual intimacy to not\nfeel abandoned you do which makes me\nfantasized about being alone again\nbecause I'm not really relationship\nfocused in the first place so I wonder\nwhat the point even is"
