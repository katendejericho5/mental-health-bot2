    "transcript": "so I made plans with Amy this Saturday\nnight\noh really is something wrong no I'm fine\nI just thought you'd be around this\nweekend I've had a really rough week and\nI thought we could hang out I love\nspending time with you and I also need\nyou to understand that I can't spend all\nof my time with you it's important for\nme to also have time to spend with my\nfriends so you don't care that I'm\nhaving a hard time right now I'm\nnoticing that whenever I make plans with\nfriends you say things like this and try\nto guilt me into staying home making\nplans doesn't mean that I don't care\nabout you having a hard time I've been\nhere for you all week I'm starting to\neven hesitate telling you that I have\nplans because you seem to have an issue\nevery time I'm not home I don't think\nthis is healthy and I'm having this\nconversation with you now even though\nit's uncomfortable because I see this\npattern I don't know if you notice it\nokay\nI really want a partner who's going to\nencourage me to do the things that make\nme happy and I also realize that when\nwe're apart it makes you anxious so\nmaybe we can talk about if there's\nanything I can do while I'm away that\ncan help you feel more comfortable can\nyou think of anything I guess just\ntexting me when you get there and if it\ngets late just texting me to let me know\nyou're okay I can definitely do that"
