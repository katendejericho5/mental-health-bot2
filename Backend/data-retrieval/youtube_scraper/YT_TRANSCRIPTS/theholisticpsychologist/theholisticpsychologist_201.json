    "transcript": "stop it you're gonna break your arm\ndon't think so\nI'm a parent with a low stress tolerance\nI can't self-regulate so even the small\nthing is a crisis for me I really wish I\nwasn't like this but it's a habit I\nlearned from my own parents\nwhat does it mean to self-regulate\nself-regulation is when we're able to\ncope with life in healthy ways so for\nexample when I saw you get up there I\ngot so scared that you would get hurt or\nthat it would break and instead of being\nable to handle those emotions I lashed\nout instead I always regretted it\nafterward but now it's a habit I\nunderstand it's not really that you lash\nout it's that afterwards you don't\nreally acknowledge how you've hurt my\nfeelings do you know how this will\nimpact me no okay well right now I'm\ninternalizing your behavior as something\nI cause because I'm in an egocentric\nstate of my childhood development this\njust means I take everything personally\nand literally so I believe that my\nactions make you treat me in a specific\nway and because you don't apologize and\nsay something like I'm sorry I just\nyelled at you it's not okay to treat you\nlike that I just think that this is\nnormal behavior I see in 20 years when\nmy partner lashes out at me I'll think I\ncaused it I won't understand boundaries\nor the reality that adults are\nresponsible for the way they behave I'll\njust think it's always my fault because\nI've learned that that's how I'm\nsupposed to be treated"
