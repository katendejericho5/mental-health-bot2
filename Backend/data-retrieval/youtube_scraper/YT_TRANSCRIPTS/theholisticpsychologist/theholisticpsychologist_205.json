    "transcript": "foreign\nI'm joined here today with a friend and\ncolleague Connor Beaton author of the\nnew book men's work during this chat we\ntalk about all things childhood impact\nas it has on our relationship and Conor\noffers a great perspective in terms of\nthe male Journey he shares so much of\nhis own personal experience in healing\nas well as his experience working with\nclients from all over the world so stay\ntuned you're not going to want to miss\nthis chat\nsweet all right good enough get me out\nof there all right I'm not an intro\nwriter thank you\nthank you Connor for sharing your your\ntime with me today I'm super excited to\nhave the opportunity now to have a chat\nwith you about your newest book men's\nwork so thank you for joining me here\ntoday\nyeah thank you so much for having me\nit's an honor and a pleasure to be here\nof course of course I think before we\ndive into the book\num a little bit of a temperature climate\ncheck because I had read the book\nobviously myself and I know within the\npages of the book are is so much of your\nown journey in terms of your own Journey\nEvolution through Men's Work evolving\nhealing and all of the things and you\nknow having myself written a lot of my\nown story and on the heels of being\npublished in the world I just want to\nsee how you're doing I mean how was the\nprocess of sharing so much of yourself\nand before we hit record you would\nacknowledge that you're now knee-deep in\nhaving conversations about the book on\nthe heels of it being released into the\nworld so how is that aspect of of this\nprocess for you and how has it been\nyeah I mean I I think uh it's been good\nin many ways I I am grateful for being\npracticed in the kind of art of\nvulnerability and transparency of my\nlife you know and I've made it my my\nmission in some ways to be honest and in\nintegrity and authentic about not just\nwho I am today but about who I was that\ngot me to where I am and so as I've\nstarted to have these conversations and\nyou know people have reached out and\nreflected back uh people that have got\nthe book ahead of time and have read\nthrough and just sort of\nbeen grateful for my transparency around\ncertain topics that not not a lot of men\ntalk about you know these conversations\nabout infidelity and pornography and\num you know abuse as a man experiencing\nabuse as a man and carrying pain as a\nman and what we do with that uh it's\nbeen it's been really moving actually\nI've had a couple conversations with\npeople where you know podcasters and\npeople that are in this work men who who\ndo this for a living and have these\nconversations for a living and and to be\nto hear and sort of receive back that\nthe book has had a real meaningful\nimpact on them has been has been nice\nand um one thing I will say\nbefore I wrap that up is uh you know I\nstarted writing this book the moment\nthat my son was born and uh well maybe I\nshould I should correct that I started\nwriting this book about five years ago\nand I didn't\nI didn't get a book deal uh until my son\nwas born so my son was born uh March\n13th of 2021 and I had my first call\nwith Publishers on the day that we got\nhome from the hospital which in\nhindsight was a wow it was a huge\nmistake I was like so under slapped I\nhad no sleep in me it was a brand new\nfather it was completely disheveled and\ndisoriented you know this new little\nentity is in my life and I'm trying to\nfigure out uh just like who the heck I\nam now as a dad and having these calls\nbut it's been it's been wonderful and it\nfeels wonderful because I got a lot of\nrejection along the way you know I had a\nlot of major publishing houses telling\nme things like men don't buy books and\nmen don't buy books for uh self-help and\npersonal development and I I just don't\nbelieve that and you know my pushback\nwas well maybe you're not publishing\nthings that they actually give a crap\nabout and so and so thankfully I ended\nup having a publishing house that that\ntook a chance on this and and so here we\nare so it's it feels rewarding it feels\nuh surreal and\num yeah it just it feels I have a lot of\ngratitude for for the process\nwell speaking from my own personal\nperspective I'm so grateful that that\nPublishing House took a chance on you\nand I'm so grateful even before you now\nhave the opportunity to communicate your\nwork in the form of a book for you even\ndeciding to make yourself so visibly\npresent and to share so much of your own\nJourney\num because to speak to that point I\nthink for many different reasons whether\nwe want to talk of the gender line or\nnot so many of us as humans you know are\nfearful of telling our authentic truth\nand in my opinion and now in my lived\nexperience there is so much healing and\njust hearing another story and I think\nas we're diving into the the content of\nthe wisdom that you're sharing in your\nbook men's work while it is called men's\nwork and you and I were having a bit of\na chat before we even hit record\num for all of you out there listening\nwhen we're talking about sharing stories\nnot only can I imagine might there be a\nuniversal you know similarity in some of\nthe content that we're hearing whether\nor not you you know identify as the male\ngender or not for all of us that are in\nwhatever relationship it is with any\nmales present in our life whether it's a\nromantic partner a friendship a business\npart partner or just navigating the\nworld with you know humans other humans\nin in the other gender I think there's\njust so much value and again in my\nopinion healing can happen as we make\nspace for each other's story and I think\nthe part of the story that I want to\nbegin with is actually the subtitle of\nyour book so anyone who is watching this\nthe book I'm holding it up now Men's\nWork a practical guide to face your\nDarkness end self-sabotage and find\nFreedom so let's dive into the darkness\naspect of it first it's right up there\nin the subtitle and you talk a bit about\nthe shadow so I think that's a really\ngreat place and one of the most\nvulnerable aspects and even lack of\nawareness around what the shadow is so\ncan you tell us a little bit about to\nyou what the shadow is\num how we know we have it where it comes\nfrom and let's dive into the darkness a\nbit yeah well there's a there's a\nmaybe a good title for another book is a\ndive into the darkness but yeah I mean\nthe the shadow in in just sort of like\nshort form is a concept that uh was\ncreated by a really famous uh\npsychoanalyst named Carl Jung back in\nthe early 20th century and the notion is\nthat the shadow is the the sort of\npsychological part of us where we store\nall of the content that we don't want\nother people to know about in order for\nus to fit in and belong\nso if you grew up in an environment\nwhere it wasn't safe for you to express\nyour humor or express your sexuality or\nExpress certain preferences or choices\nin your life that part of you you will\nhave learned very quickly to disconnect\nfrom that part of you and it's not that\nit goes anywhere it's not that it dies\noff it's that it it just begins to hide\nuh from the world right from the people\naround you and so this Shadow this\ndarkness is generally where we store our\ninsecurities are perceived inferiorities\nand the parts of us the elements of us\nare our behaviors our choices Etc that\nthat we genuinely don't think other\npeople will like\nand so for us to find a sense of\nwholeness\nfor us to find a sense of congruency and\nauthenticity and a sense of belonging\nwhether that's in a romantic\nrelationship or within the context of a\nwork environment or a friend's Circle we\nhave to be willing to see what it is\nthat we have tried to discard about\nourselves that is true because that\npsychological emotional spiritual\nphysical material\nis the stuff that will get in the way of\nour aims our goals the type of love that\nwe want the type of image that we want\nto protect out into the world the type\nof career that we want to have the goals\nthat we have so Jung said that the\nshadow uh essentially becomes the thing\nthat thwartz our most well-meaning\nintentions so we have to start to pay\nattention to this part of ourselves and\nin doing so and this is maybe the last\nthing I'll say about this and we can\nmaybe probe a little bit deeper in doing\nso our shadow is also the place where\nthe gold resides you know this is why\nwhen you read mythology or mythological\nlore fairy tales fantasies Etc it's\nalways in venturing into the underworld\nventuring into the unknown venturing\ninto the cave where you've you know sort\nof quote unquote face the dragon that\nthere's some form of intangible reward\nright the gold isn't always gold the\ngold might be your voice it might be\nyour truth it might be a strength to\nstand up for yourself in a relationship\nor claim something that you before then\nweren't able to to fully own and admit\nto and so for me how I came to this was\nI'll try and condense this as well was\nthat I had hidden a large part of who I\nwas and in my life and in the book I\ntalk about how I was sort of living this\ndual life where on the outside it looked\nlike uh I had this wonderful existence\nyou know I was traveling the world I had\nthis cool career I was singing opera of\nall things I was a classical singer I\nwas you know I had the motorcycle and\nthe Mustang and the cars and you know\nthe the wonderful partner who I was\nmadly in love with but behind the scenes\nI was complete disaster and I was\nabusing substances I was abusing\npornography you know drugs alcohol\num you know womanizing it was I was\nreally out of control in a lot of ways\nbecause I was insecure and I more\nimportantly was in a tremendous amount\nof pain I was really hurting from a\nchildhood of verbal physical emotional\nand and sometimes yeah and sometimes\nphysical abuse and so\none of the things that I talk about in\nthe very beginning of the book is a\nman's work begins in pain and I said\nthat because for many of us as men we've\nbeen taught to suppress our pain we've\nbeen taught to ignore our pain and so we\nbecome deficient in our capacity to deal\nwith emotional or psychological pain and\nso when we feel hurting or disconnected\nin our relationships or at work it's in\nthose moments where our shadow starts to\ncome online and we start to act in\nunsavory ways we become defensive and\nhostile and aggressive and we say\nhurtful things and we're we're doing\nthat because we're acting from our pain\nand we're acting from our pain because\nwe have disconnected from it for so long\nand that's become the method that so\nmany of us men have used in order to try\nand get through life it's the method\nthat I used as well so maybe I'll pause\nthere because I think I said a lot about\na few things that I want to make room\nfor uh for you to just really guide this\nI really appreciate you speaking on both\nthe kind of conceptual level what is the\nshadow what is the function why do we do\nit and also you know kind of overlaying\nall of that with your story and what I'm\nhearing is even for you know the large\nmajority of us who have gotten really\ngood at you know suppressing and keeping\nall of the pain below the surface and\ncontinuing to trudge on whatever\nhabitual behaviors we're doing to try\nand mitigate or navigate around that\npain I think when I'm hearing the\noverwhelming reality that I couldn't\nagree more with is that the pain doesn't\ngo away it's still part right of our\nexperience and you write a very very\nbeautiful line that I want to read and\nthen kind of Shifting us into you know\nanother concept that you talk about but\nthe first line is we only trust that we\nbelong to the degree in which we are\nwilling to risk being known right so\nthis idea of if we're not fully bringing\nall of us pain included right to our to\nour relationships for reasons of you\nknow fear or whatever they might be that\nreally might impact then the degree to\nwhich you know we're being known in our\nrelationship so kind of piggybacking on\nthat and you then go into a section\nwhere you're talking about you know kind\nof how this impacts males in particular\nand you reference the myth of male\nseparation or this idea of the Lone Wolf\nand figure out figure it out yourself\nmentality so can you say a little more\nabout kind of how these Concepts\nintertwine in terms so right what am I\nbringing to the relationship and how\nauthentically am I connected and what\nmight be the byproduct if I don't feel\nthat level of safety\nyeah well it's such a good question and\nyou know I I before I talk about the\nmail separation I want to just sort of\naddress what you're speaking to before\nin the sense of belonging you know we\nas human beings want to belong you know\nand we have evolved to belong we've\nevolved in community and so one of the\nmost dangerous things to us physically\nour nervous systems our minds our bodies\nis not belonging and we all have sort of\nsome interesting mechanisms to try and\nbelong right some of them are very\nmaladaptive they're not not very\neffective but for the most part I think\none of the biggest things that that we\ncan sort of all agree on hopefully is\nthat what many of us do is that we we\nExile certain parts of our authenticity\ncertain parts of who we genuinely are in\norder to try and belong\nso we separate from who we genuinely are\nand that might be separating from our\nsense of assertiveness are separating\nfrom our anger separating from our\nsadness or our grief and in in order to\nbelong in order to fit in in order to\nfeel like we're lovable or worthy or\nenough or that we can be trusted Etc\nand I and what I started to notice\nbecause I've been working with men for\nover a decade now and I've worked with\ntens of thousands of men from around\naround the world and it's been a really\ninteresting thing\nto notice how many men have bought into\nthis myth of separation and the\nseparation myth is essentially as\nfollows you will be stronger as a man\nfor separating or suppressing what is\nunsavory what makes you weak what makes\nyou look less than\nand your degree the Your Capacity and\nability to to suppress and repress those\nthings will make you stronger we'll make\nyou more of a man and eventually that\ndoesn't function it doesn't work it\nmight work as a short-term strategy no\ndoubt it might work as a short-term\nstrategy but as a long-term way of being\nand living it's soul-crushing you know\nit really starts to erode and destroy us\nbecause we know unequivocally the psyche\nknows and the Soul knows and the Heart\nknows we are ignoring a part of us and\nan important part and there's a man that\nI deeply respect his name is Francis\nWeller and he said your pain has its own\nintelligence your pain has its own\nintelligence I love this notion because\nwe as men often discard our pain discard\nour hurt and the experiences that we've\nhad and that pain has a quality of\nintelligence that we need to learn from\nand so we're not stronger in the long\nterm for suppressing that pain it\nactually weakens Us in the long term\nbecause it cripples our ability to\nunderstand when other people are hurting\nit cripples our ability to connect on a\nhuman level when our partner is in pain\nor feels embarrassed or feels\ndisconnected or you know wants a certain\nkind or quality of connection or\nconversation it hinders our ability to\nunderstand when we're on social media\nand see somebody that we disagree with\nit actually interferes with our capacity\nto empathize with them to understand\nwhere they might be coming from because\nwhat we do is we walk around in the\nworld saying well if I'm not allowed to\nfeel my pain then neither are you if I'm\nnot allowed to admit where I was abused\nor abandoned or neglect or where I was\nhurt in Life or where I have hurt other\npeople and the Damage that that's done\nto me then you're not allowed to do that\neither so we start to force this Act of\nsuppression and repression onto other\npeople as a as a means of control and as\nan illusion of strength and what most\nmen will find is that to deal with that\nto cope with that level of suppression\nwe need something to keep the lid down\nthe vault door down on our emotional\nbody and this doesn't make us a more\ncompetent complete and robust human\nbeing this makes us somebody that feels\nas if we're broken or an imposter right\nthis is why something like 72 percent of\npeople within the corporate world say\nthat they're an imposter why is that why\nis such a massive number of people\nwithin the corporate world why do they\nfeel like an imposter well it's likely\nbecause my guess is after having worked\nwith a number of them is that they're\nhaving to hide and repress a part of who\nthey are that is truly how they feel and\nour emotions are important data\nimportant information that we need to\nlearn how to interact with how to be in\nrelationship with with how to be with\nthat energy and so the repression only\nleads to us needing alcohol porn drugs\nweed Etc in order to numb it out and the\nlast thing I'll say is that numbness is\nnot an emptiness and I'm going to speak\nto this very clearly for a lot of men\nbecause a lot of men that come to work\nwith me they say I feel numb you know I\ndon't know what I feel outside of anger\nnumbness is not an emptiness it's not an\nemotional emptiness numbness is an\nemotional fullness it's when your body\nand your heart and your mind are so full\nof\nun dealt with unwitnessed and unseen\nemotions that you haven't been willing\nto engage with that your body and your\nmind start to short-circuit your nervous\nsystem literally starts to shut down and\nyour mind literally says I can't deal\nwith this and so I'm just going to\npretend like it's not even there and so\nwe need substances to help us numb to\nhelp us sort of go back to sleep to Our\nTruth\nkind of hearing my head repeat this idea\nof unwitnessed emotions unseen right\nemotions and how powerful that that\nlanguage is and\num so kind of when we're thinking about\nyou know we talked about the shadow\nthese aspects you know of our self and\nthis you know beautiful idea of to know\nanother's pain to be able to hold space\nto empathize really you know very much\naligned with the work I put up that\nbegins right with ourself and so when we\nthink about where whatever this habit of\nrepressing of suppressing of you know\nnot allowing our authentic expression to\nbe you bring up the topic and you know\nlooking back early on into our childhood\num you talk about a concept of the\nshadow of the father I think is how how\nyou call it um and obviously you know\nmembers of my community hear me go on\nand on about childhood and the impact of\nour caregivers in these early\nenvironments so can you say more about\nwhat your kind of thoughts are on these\nearly experiences and this learning\nessentially that take place listen what\nrole the father whether present or not\nmay or may not play in terms of this\ntype of learning that we're talking\nabout simply what is our relationship\nwith our emotions and how do those early\nfigures the father in particular play a\nrole\nyeah I mean there's a huge amount of of\nliterature out there you know of data\nand research that shows how important a\nfather is to a child's development and\nespecially for young boys and I think\nyou know one of the things that I wrote\nabout in the book is this notion I think\nI called it the plague of absent fathers\nand one of the things that's very\nchallenging is that young young boys you\nknow who will grow up to be men who\nidentify as men and who operate in the\nworld as men will learn what that looks\nlike from their father\nand you know we we very much mirror\nthings in our environment you know I\nthink this has been proven time and time\nagain right our environment helps to\nbuild who we are and there's a little\nbit of Nature and nurture embedded into\nall of us\num but the role of the father is really\nhelpful for young children specifically\nin being able to understanding Rough and\nTumble play taking risks\num and sort of encouraging those things\nto go out into the world and and take a\nrisk and and do things that uh that\nmaybe are borderline unsafe sometimes\nbut teach us valuable lessons about\nbeing able to be risk prone and create a\nkind of\num anti-fragile way of being and this is\na very helpful thing for for a lot of\nyoung boys and a lot of young men you\nknow you see the rise of public figures\nthat are very controversial when I say\npublic figures I mean men that are very\ncontroversial and and I've talked about\nthis a few times where you see people\nlike Jordan Peterson just as an example\nwho's very very controversial and I\nalmost like hesitate to drop his name\nbut he's very controversial and for me\nhe's controversial because for a lot of\nyoung men he embodies this sort of\narchetypal father that they didn't have\nsomebody that's telling them very simple\nthings right make your bed clean\nyourself up you know prioritize yourself\nfirst be able to lead yourself first in\nyour life and it's sort of these first\nprinciple\nexperiences that are are incredibly\nimportant so young boys will will\nspecifically we're talking about men and\nboys young boys will look at their\nfather as the image of who they could\npotentially become as a man\nand there's a lot of interaction a lot\nof quote unquote emotional nutrients as\nI call them that we get from that\ninteraction and I in the book I talk\nabout how my parents got divorced when I\nwas three and my father left and you\nknow I didn't understand what was going\non I didn't really know what was\nhappening and when I was about six or\nseven my mom remarried my stepfather and\nmy dad remarried to my now stepmother\nand for the life of me I couldn't\nunderstand what was going on but all\nthat I felt all that I was left with\nfrom that time period in my life was\nthis very deep very painful experience\nlike I can feel it today to well it\nstill almost brings me to tears of not\nhaving him around and and not\nunderstanding where he went and why I\ncouldn't see him and why I was limited\nto to interacting with him once a month\nand it was just this visceral\ngut-wrenching pain that as a young boy\nyou know not having him there really\ncaused me a tremendous amount of\nsuffering and then that coupled with the\nman who would then go on to to be my\nprimary parent my stepfather he and I\ndid not have a good relationship you\nknow so I was very much wounded by the\nquote-unquote masculine I had this heavy\nwound from men in my life and so to be a\nhealthy grounded man I didn't know what\nthat looked like because all I I had was\nan example of a man who had who wasn't\naround and then a man who was abusive\nand that would carry on and continue for\nthe years to come and so part of what we\nneed to do as men part of the work that\nI put in the book is to reconcile with\nthe shadow of our father whether that's\nhe was absent he was neglectful he was\nabusive or that he just didn't meet the\nneeds that we thought we needed as a\nchild and to be able to forgive the man\nthat he was or the man that we thought\nhe should have been and to and to really\nlet that go so that we can create some\nspace for what it means for us to be a\nman what it means for us to be a good\nfather or a good partner or a good\nleader in the world or just a\ncontributive human being to culture and\ncommunity and Society so that's a huge\naspect of of what we need to do because\nthere's a tremendous amount of again of\ndata that shows that young boys that\ngrow up without a father figure\nare much more likely to drop out of\nschool much more likely and prone to to\nviolence violent acts of aggression\nincarceration you know and and so we can\nsee statistically that not having a male\nfigure around for young boys is it can\nbe very very damaging so this is a huge\nfocus of the book so it sounds like you\nknow kind of making space like you're\ndescribing Conor for the reality of the\npain even if you are someone who's\ngotten really good at being disconnected\ndistracted feeling like you're fine even\nthough that's the case I think what I'm\nhearing is the reality of it is allowing\nyou know whether it's the absence or the\npresence of a father figure who whatever\nthe dynamic may or may not have been\nmight have caused some deep wounding so\nallowing yourself to embody right the\nexperience of being with going back to\nthat concept you beautifully worded\nearlier the pain being with the real\nquality of your experience and kind of\nshifting a bit now to the other\ncaregiver that I imagine some listeners\nmight have had present you you then go\non to speak of the role then of a mother\nand again similarly speaking a bit about\nthis concept of the shadow of of the\nmother and can you say a bit more about\nhow that then interacts with whether or\nnot father was present or not and\nessentially what role or impact the\nmotherly figure whoever that might have\nbeen in the listener's life might have\nplayed\nyeah well and just to say one more thing\nI think you know\num a lot of and again I'm coming at this\nfrom the context of speaking from you\nknow a man and male identified so I just\nwant to make that super clear but I\nthink that in in many ways\nyou know a\na father will also showcase what it\nlooks like for a man to interact with\nhis own anger and so a lot of young boys\nand a lot of young men who you know go\nthrough puberty or enter into the world\nand they hear all these messages about\nwhat it means to be a man or you know\nthey have this sort of volatility that\nlives within them for whatever reason or\nbullied at school or they've been told\nthat they need to act a certain way\nthere there aren't many examples that a\nlot of young boys and young men have\nthat are showing them how to deal with\ntheir anger and that is part of the role\nof a father is to be able to say here's\nhow you deal with the intensity that you\nfeel in your body you know because I can\ntell you that as a young boy and as a\nyoung man there was a very deep very\nintense energy that lived within my body\nbecause of the pain that I had\nexperienced you know and so not having\nthat was very detrimental and so being\nable to understand that and own that and\nadmit that like yeah that it sucked not\nhaving him around you know and here's\nthe impact of it Jung talks about how\nthe first step in the therapeutic\nprocess is confessed you know his\nadmission to what is actually present to\nwhat we are experiencing to what we are\ngoing through and I just love that\nconcept because we have to bring\nawareness into what our the truth of our\nexperience in terms of the shadow of the\nmother you know again I think\num I just love the sometimes the union\nframework but\nin in in the book I talk about how for a\nlot of uh children for a lot of young\nboys their blueprint of\num women and The quote-unquote Feminine\nwill come from uh their interaction with\ntheir mother and so an understanding of\nwhat it means to be in relationship with\na woman and how to treat a woman and and\nhow women treat men you know and how\nwomen view men will first come from\ntheir interaction with their mother and\nget a sense of what to expect or what's\nokay or what's not okay and so for a lot\nof men you know they they enter into\nadult relationships and and we just for\na moment we'll speak about heterosexual\nrelationships but for a lot of men that\nend to into adult relationships and\nstart having relationships with women\nwhat ends up happening is that a lot of\nunresolved stuff with their mother\nstarts to show up in their relationships\nwith the women that they're dating you\nknow they become the classic nice guy\nthat they're chasing validation because\nyou know they grew up in a household\nwhere their mom was highly critical of\nthem and nothing was ever good enough\nand so they're you know tying themselves\ninto pretzels to try and impress you\nknow the the women that they want to\ndate\num or you know they're very mistrusting\nof women because maybe they grew up with\na mom who was emotionally uh volatile\nand manipulative or whatever the case\nmay be and so it's in the book are\nreally talking about looking at Dynamic\nof the parents that you grew up with and\nunderstanding this sort of foundational\nblueprint that that parent\num put maybe not put on you but placed\ninto your mind just in by being in\nproximity with them by having a\nrelationship with them and being able to\nunderstand like oh this is my story\nabout women this is my story about being\nin relationships with them you know and\nhow it's safe or unsafe for uh you know\nthe the story that you know women are a\ncertain way or that they're you know\nthey're always going to do a certain\nthing and so challenging the narratives\nand the stories that men hold About\nWomen by viewing it through the lens of\nthe the primary woman that brought them\ninto this world because that's a very\nsacred relationship you know the\nrelationship between a mother and her\nchild is a very very sick relationship\nand I think for a lot of men\num they sometimes don't look at that\nrelationship and so I talk about being\nable to view you know what was great\nabout it and uh what did you love about\nthat Dynamic and that relationship and\nmaybe what are some of the stories and\nthe narratives uh and some of the pain\nthat you've carried through into your\nadult relationships as a man and are\nmaybe trying to resolve in your adult\nrelationship with your partner you know\nor even with the people that you\ninteract with online or at work you know\nwe all try and resolve our our stuff uh\nin in various different ways and so um\nthat's it that's a huge part of it\nyeah and I think you know what I'm\nhearing and I'm wondering how this\nconnects to a concept and that you talk\nabout when we get back you know kind of\ninto the bit of the end of the book and\nabout a honest self-audit I think was\nwas the language that you used right\nlooking honestly at ourselves at maybe\nthese narratives these roles how we\nembody these narratives and these roles\nand you know because anger keeps coming\nup and I think because it's a really you\nknow difficult topic for a lot of us and\nalso an important one especially because\nit drives so much of our Behavior you\nknow especially from beneath the surface\nI mean you talk about embracing anger\nand I think the language you use is\nusing reactivity as a compass says can\nyou say more about you know this process\nof truly being honest especially as it\nconnects to those moments of anger or\ntour maybe just our relationship in\ngeneral with anger and how can it be\nused as a compass what is its value in\nyour opinion yeah yeah well you know\nreactivity is kind of like a I call it\nthe neon sign pointing to towards the\nshadow being in play right and so\nwhenever we're becoming reactive whether\nthat's us becoming defensive or\nattacking somebody else or\num you know putting somebody else down\nor shutting down ourselves that\nreactivity is a sign that that we don't\nwant to deal with something in ourselves\nand whenever we're hurt it's very common\nfor us uh as human beings to to really\nput the onus on somebody else right you\ndid this you said this I can't then it\nmade me feel this way and so a big part\nof what I'm talking about in the book is\nour reactivity is a signal of something\nthat's happening within us that we need\nto take ownership over because we can\nonly ever go into our own internal\nexperience right the act of trying to\ncontrol somebody else's behavior in a\nrelationship is a losing game it'll\nit'll crush the relationship long term\nabsolutely destroy it and so what can we\ndo is we can go internally and start to\nbegin begin to be honest about what am I\ncontributing to this how am I actually\nfeeling that I might not be\ncommunicating you know if I'm getting\nreactive and I'm and I'm you know\nbecoming loud and you know sort of\npuffed up but I'm not admitting that\nactually it it hurt what you said or I'm\nembarrassed about what I did or what I\nforgot to do or I feel ashamed of how\nI've acted then I'm not taking personal\nresponsibility for my part in in the\nconflict in the dysfunction and one of\nthe things that I that I talk about in\nthe book is that you know we as men\nthere I sort of give a little bit of\npush to be become a trauma-informed man\nyou know to understand how trauma\naffects our systems because I think for\nmost men they you know I talk about this\nconcept of self-leadership and and being\nable to influence ourselves towards our\nhighest goals our highest aims and to\nreally have a vision of who it is that\nwe actually could become\num as as a person as a human being as a\nman and in order to do that we need to\nunderstand how our past how our\nreactivity how our pain is getting in\nthe way of doing that and so we we all\nhave our own certain brand of reactivity\nyou know for some people it's going to\nbe you're going to go straight into\ncriticizing the other person you know\nfor other people reactivity is going to\nlook like shutting down slamming the\ndoor walking away closing off for a few\ndays right or a few hours and so we have\nto start to turn the script on I'm\nreactive it's somebody else's fault to\nI'm reactive what do I need to\nunderstand about what's happening inside\nof me right what do I need to understand\nabout what's going on inside of me and I\ntalk about embracing anger specifically\nfor men because in our culture in the\nlast however many years there's been\nthis push that a man's anger is toxic\nand dangerous and unhealthy and violent\nand Etc and that is true in some cases\nyou know but generally speaking that\nhappens when a man is operating from\nundealt with pain hurt and Trauma and\nhis anger becomes violent because he's\nin so much pain he doesn't actually know\nhow to deal with that charge internally\nand so my hope in this book is to\nactually teach men that anger is not an\nenemy you know it's something that we\ncan turn towards and embrace there's a\nwonderful poet um David White who says\nthat anger is the greatest form of care\nanger is the greatest greatest form of\ncare and it actually helps us to care\nfor the things that matter most to us\nand so anger through the heart\ncan be something that allows us to\nprotect the things that matter our\nrelationship Etc they can give us a\nvoice when we would normally shut down\nthey can help us turn towards our hurt\nin the moments where you know\nsomething's happened in our relationship\nand we want to accuse the other person\nand you know to take a strip out of them\nor we want to shut down or we want to\nnumb out and go online on social media\nand actually turn towards and say you\nknow that really hurt me and I I\nactually I actually really heard when\nyou said that I feel a lot of shame that\nI forgot to do that you know that's a\nbig one for me it's hard for me to admit\nwhen I was wrong and when I forgot to do\nsomething and so I've gotten in the\nhabit of noticing when I want to be\nreactive and defensive when I've\nforgotten to do something or when I've\ngotten something wrong and say you know\nwhat I just feel ashamed that I got that\nwrong or I feel ashamed that I forgot to\ndo that and I'm sorry and so that anger\nthat we would normally project out into\nthe world or implode into ourselves and\nsort of self-criticize and\nself-deprecate and tear ourselves apart\nwhich a tremendous amount of men do I'm\ngonna end this answer by just sort of\ngiving you one example\nin a lot of workshops because again I've\nworked with a ton of men who just have\nsuch a\num damaging self-talk like really truly\ndamaging self-talk I I sometimes think\nthat most\num people underestimate how many men are\nare really engaged in this uh this\ninternal dialogue that is very vicious\ntowards themselves\nin in a lot of workshops what I'll do is\nI'll partner guys up and I'll get them\nto sit across from one another and by\nthis time they've usually built some\ngood rapport with one another they know\nthe other guy and they've had some good\nconversations with them you know they\nknow about their lives a little bit and\nI'll start asking them to give me a\nsense of what their inner critic sounds\nlike you know this voice inside of them\nthat's constantly criticizing their\nremove and their perfectionism and I'll\nsay okay now take a deep breath and\nspeak to the man across from you from\nthe place of your inner critic as if you\nwere the inner critic and he was you and\nthen go for it and every single time\nevery guy's like well I don't want to do\nthat I want to speak to him like that\nbut for some reason we have\num allowed ourselves to operate from\nthis place of really severe\nself-deprecation so our reactivity is\nthis sign that we're either harming\nsomeone else or harming ourselves and we\nneed to bring attention to it and we\nneed to be able to heal our relationship\nto our anger right here our relationship\nto our anger so that it can be healthy\nso it can be directed towards something\nthat's meaningful versus something\nthat's destructive so I think that's the\ndifference between anger and aggression\nright anger is something that can be\nhealthy that can that is just something\nthat we all experience it can be\nsomething generative that allows us to\ncreate boundaries right which teach\nother people how to treat us and\naggression is generally something that\nis attack oriented and destructive and\nmeant to tear down it's not meant to\nbuild up and so that's how I generally\ndifferentiate between those two things\nand talk about it with men I really kind\nof appreciate that distinction and also\nkind of piggybacking or building on this\nconcept of self-harm I really appreciate\nhow you illustrate how reactivity can\nlook a bit different than that explosive\nversion of anger that I think some of us\nmight be more familiar with and can look\nlike that shutting down that separation\nfrom and going back to the beautiful\nwisdom you shared very early on on this\nchat which is that we all need\nrelationships we all deeply desire to be\nknown to be connected to be in relation\nto other people so I could go as far to\nsay is because as someone who's lived\nthat separation that disconnection for\nme as that my main way of keeping myself\nsafe when I didn't feel safe just being\nwho I was that in my opinion is another\nway maybe not so explicitly obvious but\nthat we are harming ourselves and those\nthat want to maybe desperately be in\nrelationship and I imagine a lot of\nlisteners might be in relationship\nwhatever that might be with the shutdown\nversion of a partner and right how how\ndamaging that can be and another\ndistinction that I was very interested\nin I was hoping you could speak a bit on\nis you talk about the difference between\nSolitude and isolation and being you\nbrought up boundaries and separation and\nsafety and what role if any does\nseparation from any active relationship\nthat we might be in play in terms of the\nJourney of healing and journey of men's\nwork in general\nyeah I feel like I'm going to quote\nyoung a lot on this show for some reason\nbut he had a he had a great line where\nhe said you cannot you cannot heal what\nyou cannot separate from\nyou cannot heal what you cannot separate\nfrom now that doesn't mean that you need\nto cut yourself off from that thing\nright and so this is the tactic that a\nlot of us as men use which is either I\nfeel something that I don't like or I've\nbeen told I'm not allowed to feel and so\nI I either try and cut myself off from\nit entirely and ignore it or I become it\nand I react from that place so I feel\nanger I've been told that I'm not\nallowed to be angry or that it's bad\nwhen I'm angry so I'm either going to\ntry and cut myself off from that and\ncompletely shut it down or I'm going to\nreact from it and become it and then I\nbecome volatile and unconscious right\nbecause that's that's really what\nhappens when when we move into that\naggressive space this is I usually talk\nabout this because it makes sense for a\nlot of guys but you know when we say oh\nI lost it you know I just I just lost it\nright well what what do you actually\nmean when you say that for most people\nif you really tune in what they are\nactually saying is I lost consciousness\nI lost my conscious capacity to respond\nthere was no pause there was no breath\nthere was no regulation there was no\nchecking in with myself I lost\nConsciousness and I reacted from that\nemotional experience internally and it\nwas an unconscious experience right so\nwe really have to remain conscious\nto what our experience is and that is\nreally what I think a lot of the work is\nfor men is to remain conscious to the\nintensity of sometimes what the\nexperience is that we're feeling whether\nthat's the experience of grief after\nlosing a relationship and feeling\nheartbroken or staying conscious to the\nintensity of our the heat of our anger\nor our arousal or whatever it is that\nwere that we're experiencing because a\nman who's conscious of his experience is\nmuch more safe to women to men to\nsociety to culture than a man who's\nunconscious to his internal experience\nright that's a dangerous man that's a\nreally dangerous man right so I just\nwanted to say that but in terms of this\nSolitude and isolation you know it one\nof the things that I noticed in during\nthe uh the time that we just went\nthrough the the time that will not be\nnamed but one of the things that I\nnoticed through the time that we just\nwent through is that isolation equals\namplification is just a very simple\nequation that I came up with isolation\nequals amplification and it's this\nnotion that when we isolate we it\namplifies what's already happening\nwithin us and so again as men we've been\ntaught that if we're feeling angry or we\nfeel grief or we feel sadness well we\nshould suppress those things and over\ntime our what we convince ourselves of\nis in order for us to protect ourselves\nfrom the people around us from the\npeople that we love from our kids from\nour family from work environments in\norder to protect them from what we are\nfeeling and experiencing that feels too\nbig we need to isolate ourselves\nbut when it ends up happening in those\nmoments is that it amplifies our\nexperience right it amplifies our\ninternal experience and so I talk about\nin the book this notion that isolation\nreally makes you as a man impotent and\nnot impotent in the sense sexually but\nimpotent in your ability to connect with\npeople that you love because when we are\nisolating what we're really telling them\nand telling ourselves is I don't trust\nme I I don't trust me I don't trust\nmyself to deal with this anger or to\nexpress this grief or to express this\nsadness or for you to see my\nvulnerability or for me to own my part\nin it or whatever it is I don't trust me\nand so isolation then begins to brew and\nElevate our internal experience whatever\nthat experience is whereas Solitude is\nsomething deeply connective it is a\nconscious and intentional choice right\nisolation is oh crap I have to do\nsomething about this I need to run away\nright Retreat Retreat Retreat whereas\nSolitude is I'm feeling something that I\ndon't know if I know how to express or\nbe with or uh or deal with and so I'm\ngoing to intentionally choose Solitude\nfor a period of time to see if I can\nsort through some of this\npsychologically physically spiritually\nand emotionally you know in a journal\nI'm going to meditate I'm gonna do\nbreath work I'm going to go into the\nwoods for five days with nothing but a a\ntent and a pen and paper and try and try\nand make sense of what is happening in\nmy life and what's happening within me\nthat is very different so Solitude is\nconscious and intentional and isolation\nis this unconscious fear-based response\nto something that we don't know how to\nnecessarily cope with or deal with and\nthat's largely because we haven't been\nshown you know a lot of men actually\njust haven't been taught how to cope\nwith or navigate or Traverse the\nintensity that sometimes live within\nthem especially hard things like like\ngrief\nso beautiful and when you're when we're\ntalking now about kind of building this\nfoundational reconnective relationship\nwith all the stuff the Shadow the\nreality of the experience you\num talk about a concept of emotional\nsovereignty and I'm imagining is that\nkind of walking Us in the direction of\nwhat you mean when you say what does\nemotional sovereignty mean what does\nthat look like\num in action for anyone listening\nwhether we're in relationship or not how\ncan we become that or what does that\nemotional Sovereign being look like\nultimately in relationship\nyeah well what it means is in essence\nhaving the the fortitude and the courage\nand The Bravery to take responsibility\nand ownership over what is truly\nhappening within you that is an act of\nof courageousness that's an act of\nBravery you know if if you're a man who\nwas sexually abused as a child if you're\na man who grew up in an environment\nwhere you were neglected and it's coming\nout in your life it's coming out in your\nmarriage coming out you know in your\nparenting it is incredibly challenging\nfor a lot of men to just own the truth\nof their internal experience and even if\nyou didn't have those things right\nbecause those those are like you know\nthe the sort of the the big capital T\ntrauma right but if you just have uh an\nexperience of feeling very disgruntled\nor very unhappy or you know you've done\nsomething wrong you've forgotten to do\nsomething in your relationship and you\nfeel that shame you feel that grief you\nfeel that embarrassment\nemotional sovereignty is really about\nyou as a man you as an individual being\nable to say this is my responsibility\nand it's not the world's responsibility\nit's not my partner's responsibility to\nmake me feel better to accommodate me\nit's not their responsibility to have to\nemotionally regulate me and emotionally\nprocess me you know I think what I've\nnoticed in a lot of heterosexual\nrelationships is that men inadvertently\nturn their Partners into emotional\nprocessing centers so their partner\nbecomes the only person that they can go\nto to discuss\nprocess understand their emotional world\nand it creates this kind of dependency\nwhere she becomes the only person that\nhe goes to she becomes the only person\nthat he talks to about his emotions and\nit creates this kind of\num\nchildlike relationship where he feels\nlike the only way for him to sort that\nout to sort out what he's experiencing\nis to bring it to her and it might seem\nconnective at first and might feel good\nat first but over time it really damages\nthe the intimacy and the connection and\nthe just all of it and so emotional\nsovereignty is about that individual\nbeing able to say actually this is my\nresponsibility and I'm going to build a\ncommunity of people that I can talk to\nabout these things and you know my\npartner might be one of them but I'm\ngoing to take responsibility over what\nI'm feeling and I'm going to stop\nblaming other people for my reactivity\nfor my sadness for my grief and I'm\ngoing to start to see if I can muster\nthe courage and The Bravery to be with\nthe intensity of what I sometimes might\nfeel because for some of us as human\nbeings we feel things very intensely and\nwhen we have bought into this story or\nthis notion that I shouldn't feel this\nor I can't feel this then we rope in\nother people to be responsible for\nregulating our experience and we can\nco-regulate of course but that's a\nlittle bit different right even uh\nco-regulation requires two emotionally\nSovereign people who are willing to say\nthis is still my experience but damn I\nneed your help right now you know this\nis still mine to own but I could really\nuse some support for you to just sit and\nbreathe with me and and help me through\nthis right but I still mine to carry and\nthat's the aim right if we can become\nhuman beings who are more Adept and more\ncapable at carrying our grief at\ncarrying our sadness at carrying our\nanger carrying our disappointment then\nour our entire world and communities and\nrelationships will change because we\nwill be honest about what we're actually\ngoing through and it's a kind of\num dare I say like spiritual Quest you\nknow so yeah absolutely I really\nappreciate Connor are you making that\ndistinction of you know what support\ntruly looks like what responsibility\naround our emotions truly look like and\nhow often what the surface the habits\nwhat we think it is those moments where\nit does maybe feel so great even to\nmaybe be the partner who has someone\nsharing things that they know they don't\nshare with anyone else in their world\nand it feels so great but if it's you\nknow from that place of dependency right\nI need you to make me feel better I'm\nnot taking responsibility I'm in that\ndisempowered space all the same so I\nreally appreciate you making that\ndistinction in terms of what authentic\nconnection and support looks like with\ntwo autonomous separate emotionally\nSovereign beings and ultimately I think\nthis conversation really beautifully\nright overviewed a lot of the habits and\npatterns that keep us from that really\nconnected space all of the shame that I\nthink is wrapped up around it and\nultimately overviewing the journey to\nbecoming it and as we're getting ready\nto end because relationships as we\ncontinue to talk about and how important\nright spaces safe spaces supportive\ncontainers can be one of the things that\nI absolutely love your work from top to\nbottom though I'm so inspired with the\namazing community of men that you've\ncreated as a container for this work in\nmen's work so as we're getting ready to\nend not only can you tell us where we\ncan find your new book men's work but if\nyou wouldn't mind sharing a bit about\nthe role of your community what it is\nhow it came to be and ultimately how it\nfits into to this journey because I'm\nimagining a lot probably of men\nlistening out there who are looking for\nthe supportive containers could be\npointed in your direction\nyeah I appreciate that and um just the\nopportunity to be here and speak with\nyou and and share with your audience and\nyeah I mean uh the book is on sale\neverywhere um you can go to Amazon you\ncan go to mantox.com forward slash book\nand you'll you'll find the availability\nthere you can kind of buy it from most\nplaces Barnes and Noble et cetera uh and\nthen yeah I mean my my organization man\ntalks has has created\num support for men who are doing this\nwork who are going to therapy and who\nhave a coach and you know are looking\nfor other like-minded men to to get into\nthe weeds with you know whether they're\nhealing their their childhood trauma or\ntheir you know simply trying to elevate\nwho they are in their relationship or\ntheir career or their purpose and so we\nbuilt this program called The Alliance\nand it's really about men Gathering and\nbeing member-led right being being\nself-led and so they get their own\nCommunity their own groups I bring in\nexperts you've been a wonderful guest on\nthere before uh and it's an opportunity\nfor men to to be open you know to be\ntransparent to talk about some of these\nthings and to create really meaningful\nand Lasting change in in their life and\nand most importantly to have\nto have the hard parts of their lives be\nwitnessed you know as I said in the very\nbeginning we all want to belong and some\nfor for most of us what that looks like\nis having the things in our lives the\npast the pain the the failures be\nwitnessed by other people and and to\nhave the hard parts of our experience\nour grief be witnessed by other people\nand so it's a place for men to to really\nget to know one another in a completely\ndifferent way in a more depth oriented\nway than the the surface level that\nwe're sometimes accustomed to out in our\nculture I am so hard wholeheartedly\nappreciative like I said of your work of\nthis community you created you know\nhaving a community myself in and outside\nof membership\num and understanding how important those\nsafe spaces are those points to connect\nso you know I strongly like I said I'm\nwholeheartedly a fan of of your\nsupportive containers I think you just\ndo such an amazing job I think you kind\nof bring so much of your own journey and\nhaving been a participant in my own\nCommunity I couldn't agree more that\nthere's so much healing and having our\nstories heard space to safely Express\nthem and even for those of us who have\nthe opportunity to have so many aspects\nof our experience reflected back when\nyou hear from others oh my gosh I not\nexactly the details were the same but\nthe feelings I can relate and I'm\nactually getting chills as I'm sharing\nthis aloud with is how important and how\nhealing that can be so anyone who's\nlistening who's looking for a safe\ncontainer whether or not it's in or\noutside of your alliance I just\nwholeheartedly suggest you following\nalong will make sure that all of\nConnor's details are linked in the show\nnotes as well as a link to the website\nwhere you can purchase this amazing book\nhere is I'll hold it up one last time\nmen's work I could not could not could\nnot wholeheartedly suggest it more and\nlike I said even for those of you who\nare do not identify as male and anyone\nwho has a male in our life we are a\nshared experience of humanity the more\nwe can understand going back full circle\nthe more we can understand another's\npain regardless of the gendered body\nthat it is in in my opinion the more we\ncan create these authentic connections\nso thank you honor Connor for I'm\nhonored for sharing for all of your\nsharing of your time and your energy\nwith us and with our community thank you"
