    "transcript": "foreign\nPhantom about his new book The Path of\nan eagle we talk about the power of\nstory to connect us with others Jay\nshares about many different struggles\nthat he went through and speaks about\nthe importance of managing change or of\nchoice as we begin to heal and soar the\npath of an eagle stay tuned you don't\nwant to miss it so thank you for being\nhere and having this chat with me Jay\nI'm super excited to dive in a bit\ndeeper to your new book thank you for\nsharing your time and space with me\ntoday path of an eagle\nDr Nicole thank you so much for your\nkindness uh honestly it's amazing to be\nhere with you I'm very excited because I\nlove your work your work has helped me\nimmensely and the fact that I'm here in\nthe tables are being turned at the\nmoment it's a bit surreal so forgive me\nif I'm a little bit nervous\nbut I'm just very much looking forward\nto sharing my story and hopefully\nhelping uh your audience uh heal a\nlittle bit better but yeah very very\nexcited I appreciate the opportunity to\nhave the tables turn like you're saying\nso for anyone tuning in and listening um\nI was a guest on Jay your podcast the\nstory box and I think that's actually a\nreally great place to jump off of even\nunpacking this concept of of story in\nand of itself and I actually was tickled\num by the intro of your book where you\nkind of acknowledge just having gone\nthrough a writing process of you know a\nversion a if you will of your draft of\nthis this book to be the path of the\neagle of an eagle and then you kind of\npulled back a bit or at least is what\nyou shared in your book you pulled back\na bit and asked yourself right who's\nwhat is the purpose like why am I\ntelling this story\num and gave us the indication that you\nkind of went back gave a rethink but I'm\nusing this to just kind of explore that\nidea first and foremost of story in and\nof itself and what stories are and you\nknow to speak to your exploration you\nknow why why we tell them what is the\nfunction of telling them ultimately\nI firmly believe that each and every one\nof us has a story to tell and a lot of\npeople they keep their story to\nthemselves they keep it quite hidden\nbecause they feel like hey if I share\nthis what are people going to think of\nthings that I'm actually talking about\nor what are they going to think of my\nstory and stories have been around since\nthe very beginning of time I mean our\nearly ancestors they basically sat\naround campfires and they they shared\nstories because it's a way for us to\nreally connect and I think over over\ntime it's sort of I think it's gotten a\nlittle bit better as well as it's sort\nof being lost as well\num I think depending on the kind of\npeople and the kind of culture you live\nin uh for me in particular growing up in\nthe family that I grew up in I wasn't\nallowed to really watch TV or movies we\nsat around and read books which are\nfundamental with storytelling honestly\nfor me to be able to\nto read words on a page and transport my\nown imagination\nusing those words and just basically\ncreating what I was reading on the page\nin my mind was something surreal and I\nwas very much a curious kid growing up\nso whatever someone told me I'd ask them\na bunch of questions and I go up to\nadults and ask them these weird wild and\noutrageous questions that probably that\nannoyed The Living Daylights out of them\nuh but it was because I was I loved\nlearning and I loved this aspect of\nlistening to older people\nwith and say the world through their\neyes you know like they had lived a lot\nof life like for example being able to\nlisten to my grandfather share stories\nwith me and some of the things that he\nhas experienced then transport\nthe wisdom and the advice from that\nexperience through the element of the\nstory\nand there's so many like different\nfundamental aspects to her story like\nyou've got the beginning middle and end\nas as they always talk about and then\nyou've got the in-between moments like\nthe the bits that hardly anyone gets to\nhear it's it's sort of but for me\nand being able to unbox stories these\ndays I I will always forever be curious\nand I'll always want to ask questions\nbecause I just love learning so for me\nstories are powerful they can change\nlives for good or for bad and I want to\nuse stories whether or not I'm sharing\nmine or unboxing someone else's to help\npeople be better in their own life to\nbring the connection to help someone\nthat is struggling with a difficult time\nto be able to heal and I think that is\nlike really really really important\nthese days so hopefully that answered\nyour question 100 and really beautifully\nokay to be honest and in terms of really\nfocusing on the connectedness right when\nwe are narrating our life or any\nexperience what we're offering someone\nis it from our lived perspective and you\nknow obviously you're familiar with my\nwork and probably have heard me a\nmillion times over talk about the value\nand being able to expand and to hear\nsomeone else's lived experience that\nespecially when I should say it is\ndifferent than ours and through story or\nthat act of narrating you even use the\nword wisdom and for me that's what\nstories entail is the passing down right\nand for so long we we sought wisdom and\nright in books and in this thing outside\nof ourselves and again I'm really in\npassion just like you are of the power\nof each individual's Story the person\nwho wrote a book was a human individual\nat one time narrating their journey and\nit seems at least in my perception it\nseems that and again I don't know what\nyour experience as that curious child\ngrowing up was though I've seen the\nrepercussions the long-term consequences\nof not having that space to honor story\nand growing up in environments where\nmaybe people are similar to you and\nmaybe this was your experience of having\ncuriosity or interest in Sharing one's\nstory one's day at school maybe when\nyou're a child or an asking adults\naround you or other people and hearing\ntheir story\num of course you know in the community\nwe speak and explore a lot of what\nhappens when we don't have that space\nand when we're prevented the story\nversion right or narration of\nself-expression so I'm interested in\nright how it was for you as a curious\nchild enamored or immersed in the story\nworld but seems to have been internally\nof benefit you say it's you know it was\nmy imagination coming to life and you\nwrite about that in the book I'm\nwondering how that translated and how\nopen it felt and how safe you felt\nultimately to share that with other\npeople in the younger years of course\nwell I say in the book as well uh that I\nnever got on well with kids my own age\nand maybe it's because I couldn't really\nrelate well to their right their story\nwith that experience of yours when I\nread it I always got myself gravitating\nhaving conversation this is why I'm\nasking with an older generation so not\nto interrupt that is something that I\nsaw in myself and it's kind of of\nInterest why I'm taking us down this\npath I'm glad that you actually related\nto that because I know there are people\nthat might be listening or watching this\nthat would feel the same way and I knew\nthat I was different in that respect and\nin some ways I was criticized by my\npeers that were my own age because I was\ndifferent because I went to the older\npeople and because I wanted to learn\nfrom the older people rather than hey\nwhy isn't he actually with the younger\npeople his own age and I think a lot of\nthe uh experiences that I went through\ngrowing up I was in and out of Hospital\nquite a bit with some unexplained\nillnesses there was a lot just going on\nin my own life and a lot of struggles\nearly on that sort of helped shape me\nand made me understand that the world\nisn't all sunshine and rainbows like\nthere are a lot of things that there's a\nlot of pain there's a lot of suffering\nso being in hospital and seeing kids my\nown age and some older than me that were\non\nkidney dialysis or they were really\nreally in so much pain I saw that as a\nyoung kid and me I wanted to use stories\neven back then to make them laugh to\nmake them smile and that that brought me\na sense of comfort and joy to know that\nI was actually being able to make\nsomeone else that is in pain\neven though I was in pain too but I\nwanted to\nmake them smile make their experience of\nwhat they were going through a little\nbit lighter and stories helped like I\nsaid before they built that\nconnectiveness and I think my friends\ngrowing up and even I guess to my my\nlater years now I I've realized that if\nwe if we do want to change someone's\nlife for the better then it people they\nneed to share they need to\nwhatever capacity whatever it is\nwhatever level it is and I know some\npeople might not be ready to share and I\nalso say in the book that that's totally\nfine as well but if you you have a story\nand that's what I well that's what I say\nin the book\nso why hold it back if your story you\nnever know what your story could do for\nsomeone it could help them in so many\ngreat ways and for someone like myself\nthat felt alone for a long time being\nable to hear someone else's Story made\nme feel like I wasn't alone like I could\nactually\nfeel like I was part of a tribe part of\na community of people that were just\nlike me that that were in a lot of pain\njust like me that suffered a lot like me\nbut also they made the choice to go on\nthe path towards healing to have a\nbetter life and that's what I wanted to\nshare as well with with my story and the\nthings that I've been through\num so that's\nI guess what I I try it and as hard as I\nwork these days to to do\nand to speak to your point I think\nyou're really acknowledging\num all of the different types of Story\none could tell in different right ways\nthey could be utilized even saying I\nused to tell stories to bring people\nhappiness when they were suffering to\nbring a smile on their face stories can\nbe used right as pieces of our journey\nto give that point of connection to\nothers and kind of jumping off of that\nlast bit of it I mean I really want to\nacknowledge you Jay what you write\nbetween the pages of the path of an\neagle are so many aspects of really\nvulnerable places experiences like\nyou're even referencing from from\nmedical to you know trauma and\nrelationships\num to depression like you really cover a\nlot of The Human Experience and so first\nand foremost I want to honor you sharing\nsuch vulnerable aspects of our story\nbecause I think for those listening when\nwe think of the lighter Stories the\nstories we tell for fun for jokes even\nthe surf office level connection that's\nunderstandably an easier story for most\nof us to access and feel vulnerable or\nsafe enough to feel vulnerable to share\nwith someone and then we get into the\ndicey area right of the deep stuff\num and you so willingly gift all of the\nreaders who will come across this book\nwith that part of your experience so I\nmean how was that for you just in the\nprocess you know having written the book\nmyself and part of it is rethinking of\nall the stories that we're going to now\nput into words on a page and how was\nthat for you what was it like to go down\nthose darker parts of the journey to\nthen be able to package it up and gift\nit for someone to read\nit was when I finally figured out what\nthis book was\ngoing to be it was painful in of itself\nit was traumatic it was challenging uh\nso initially when I wrote the first\ndraft the first ever draft there was a\ncompletely different version of the book\nI actually titled it uh in Failure you\nlearn humility not a great title for a\nbook more a chapter title uh and I had\njust vomited out everything that I was\nexperiencing and going through there was\nno real structure at all uh and it was\nso actually reading it was painful I was\nlike what in the world is this and I\nremember sending it to one other person\nand they didn't understand what was\ngoing on my grammar too was shocking and\nI just remember giving up on the book\nentirely and saying no I'm not going to\nwrite a book I'm not going to share\nanything I'm just going to go about my\nlife as as normal but what is normal\nthese days right you know so\nand then I had a conversation in with my\nmy boss at the time\nwho actually inspired me to write\nanother book so I started writing this\nother book meanwhile I had given up on\nthe first book that I'd tried to write\nand here I was so I get halfway through\nthis new book I was I was writing and\nthen I had a conversation with Josh\nKaufman about you know removing fear and\nand facing the Hydra and and which is a\nmythological creature in Greek mythology\nso I had to in essence face my own fear\nof going back to this book and trying to\nfigure out what it was going to be so I\nshelved this new book that I started on\nI went back to the the uh the drawing\nboard as it were and I remember saying a\nquick prayer and just going Lord I need\nyou to give me the words that you want\nme to say enable me to share your story\nand just allow me to write whatever you\nwant me to write it's not about me I\nwant this book to be a help and to be a\nguide so use my my story and\nbasically I deleted everything\nand started from scratch again and it\nwasn't long after that that I eventually\nonce I removed my own ego out of the\nequation and basically made it about\nothers and I also used some wisdom and\nadvice from other people Marissa peer\ndoc um Dr Edith Edgar as well and so\nmany other incredible people that I've\nbeen fortunate enough to actually speak\nwith and hear their wisdom and advice\nfrom their story and it just made me\nunderstand and realize that I could\nrelate to a lot of what are the things\nthat they're going through we stand in\nturn help me share more of the things\nthat I was going through it gave me\npermission almost to share in depth of\nmy sexual abuse growing up of the\nmedical trauma and there's a lot of\nmedical trauma in the book\num there's significant things that I\nhave witnessed experienced gone through\nI mean even the loss of my my beloved\ngrandfather for example that that broke\nme up apart it tore my heart into and\nevery time I revisit that that chapter\nin that part of my life it was tricky\nI'm gonna just bawling my eyes out\nuh trying to write that chapter and the\nwords that I was using as well just made\nme just start crying\nuncontrollably and then when I went\nthrough the stages of talking about my\ndepression and then here's the hardest\npart the most vulnerable chapter for me\nwas\nthe addiction condition\nand talking about my addiction to\npornography and what that did for me how\nthat\nhow that basically almost destroyed my\nlife because it controlled what I was\nthinking how I was acting my emotional\nstate I was a recluse I kept this as my\nmy shameful personal friend I was I\ndidn't want anyone else to know about\nthis thing that was causing so much\ndamage to my life and I didn't even see\nit at the time I was so oblivious to how\nmuch damage it was causing which then\nled to my eating disorder and we stand\nled to my other addiction to exercise\nwhich then\njust massive catalyst\nlanded me in hospital for nine days\nand that where all my dignity was\nstripped\nI I get pretty in detail about what\nactually happened so I apologize for\npeople if they're a bit squirmish but it\nwasn't a fun experience but having\nhaving the permission from I guess not\nonly myself and giving myself that\npermission but also hearing other people\nthat have been through something similar\nit just made it a little bit more easier\nwasn't all easy but it just made it a\nlittle bit more easier and lighter so I\nguess in a roundabout way that I hope\nanswered your question absolutely and I\nwant to you know again acknowledge Jay\nand thank you\num for sharing exactly as you did\num especially around you know the porn\naddiction knowing how common and\nproblematic and dysfunctional and the\ndysfunction I should say in all ways it\ncan cause I had a really good friend\nwhose husband went through a very deep\npatch of significant porn addiction that\nsimilarly caused and again she was\nsomeone who hid it for a lot a lot of\ntime you know being on the other end of\na partner you know I think shame exists\nfor everyone ultimately involved and so\nagain I want to honor you for speaking\nso openly so vulnerably\num I I know put it this way that there\nwill be listeners out there who again\nwhether it's themselves that are\nsuffering with their own porn addictions\nor or having loved ones that might be\nable to unveil or pull back some of of\nthat shame and see it for what it is as\nas I believe all addictive behaviors are\nour best attempt for many of us at\nself-regulating deeper deeper emotions\nand also from a personal perspective I\nreally appreciate it how you went into\nyour different medical traumas coming\nfrom a family who has a lot of health\nrelated chronic illness and a sister in\nparticular Mr 15 years older than me so\nI was not around or alive for much of\nher medical trauma but very similarly\nsince she was an infant she was tricked\nshe died for a couple of minutes and had\nto be brought back and again having\nlived the remnants years down the line\nof what that does not only seeing it in\nmy sister right and all of the trauma\nthat still lives inside of her but what\nit does to the entire family system so\nhearing your story I want to acknowledge\nhelped me not only understand my own but\nunderstand possibly some degree or\nversion because of course it's not going\nto be exactly the same of what my sister\nmight have been and still be going\nthrough in that area and again I imagine\neveryone listening that you know your\nstory what I'm sharing is part of my\nfamily there will be so many other\npeople who see parts of their own past\nstruggles or or of a loved one struggles\nand and have that understanding and\nagain I think something you do so\nbeautifully and bringing rapping in\nfrom the first book idea title to this\nconcept right so you really illustrate\ncoming from the depths of the struggle\nwhatever it might be you've just given\nus a a big array of things that you've\nlived through the experience of\nand in a lot of ways you really shift\nthe story and make it one of overcoming\num and I imagine that even and I do I'm\ninterested in you sharing a bit about\nright even this title in and of itself\nthe path of an eagle\num and how that kind of applies to this\njourney and for those of us who aren't\nthat familiar with eagles who are\nincredible Birds I've learned much more\nabout them from you\num why is that the title you landed on\nand and how symbolic or what is the\nsymbolism there for you in terms of your\njourney of healing I love this question\nactually and and I'm holding up for\npeople to say that\nthat I've they can probably see because\nof the lighting uh this is the cover of\nthe book so you probably\nthere's an eagle on there it's probably\ntoo white to seek into the light but uh\nthe path of an eagle uh really\noriginated from\nI have my Live Verse which is from\nIsaiah 40 31 which actually is sitting\non one of my what I call my Eagle\njournals and it actually has the verse\non there which the third word is Hope\nwho am I hoping in and I think a lot of\npeople they they lost their hope\nsomewhere along the line and especially\nwith the pandemic that we've gone\nthrough it's like who are we hoping in\nthese days we're hoping in man we're\nhoping in ourselves are we hoping in a\nCreator and I know a lot of people might\nnot believe in that and that's totally\nfine I'm not trying to jam this down\nanyone's throat by any stretch of the\nimagination but for me being able to put\nmy hope and my trust in someone that has\nbeen there for me all the step of the\nway like I wouldn't be here if it wasn't\nfor for God honestly and\nlike I the verse talks about those who\nhope in the Lord will renew their\nstrength they will saw on the wings like\neagles they will run and not grow weary\nthey will walk and not be faint I mean\neven if you're not a Christian that is a\nbeautiful poetic verse honestly like you\ndon't have to be a Christian to to\nrealize there is some significance in\nthat uh and so for me the path of an\neagle really came from\nlet's look at what Eagles do let's look\nat what how eagles behave why is\nGod mentioning Eagles in this chapter or\nthis verse I should say and when I\nstudied Eagles I realized that they're\nquite significant birds and I also found\na story of when an eagle there's only\none bird that tries to bring an eagle\ndown and that is a crow for whatever\nreason it just thinks that you know what\nI can bring an eagle down you know but\nthe eagle when it's when the crow is\ntrying to inflict pain on it it doesn't\nreact\nit just decides to do the smart thing\nand the wise thing and Rise higher and\neventually constricting the Crow's\nability to breathe the cry gives up and\nfalls off\nso so in life when we are going through\nmoments of pain what I say is\ndon't react I know it's hard not to\nreact but don't react in the way\noftentimes that a lot of people react\nwhich means they get stuck they they get\ncollapsed and or they fall on the ground\nand they stay there I say rise higher\nfollow the example of the eagle so for\nme the path of an eagle is this unique\nhealing Journey enabling you to soar\nhigh in your life to not stay stuck on\nthe ground but to be your own leader to\nget up to move forward in the best way\npossible to live the very best life that\nI want everyone to live one that is full\nof joy hope fulfillment peace all these\naspects I mean you are you're not\nguaranteed that you're not going to be\nin any more pain that's not the point\npoint is being on the path of an eagle\nwhen you do it get pain you don't allow\nthat pain to cause you to remain stuck\nyou use that pain as fuel and and\nbenefit as the wings uh like give you a\nlift to get up and keep on soaring in\nyour life learn what you need to learn\nthrough the pain and I think pain is a\nis a wonderful and it's a beautiful\nthing if you choose see it that way I\nknow we don't often times see it in the\nmoment like that we want it to just be\nover but in hindsight when we see how\nBeautiful Pain really is for our growth\nand our development\nbecause we weren't\nwe weren't like I say we weren't made to\nbe stuck we were made to grow to\nflourish and this is what I hope people\nwill experience and see not just when\nthey read the book but when they\nactually make the choice themselves to\nunderstand they are their own leader\nthey can be their own self-healer as you\nso why does he always tell people and\nthey can get out of the darkness and\ninto the light but it first starts with\ntheir choice\nabsolutely and I couldn't agree more and\nI often talk about harnessing The Power\nof Choice honoring of course that as I\nimagine uh many people who will tune\ninto this will resonate with being\nstopped right with being entrapped in\nall the habits and patterns that don't\nserve us and\nI I believe right that that often times\nall of the time is a result of the\ncircumstances that we live though to\nspeak to your point right empowering\nourselves from the depths or wherever we\nare in that moment does then give us the\nopportunity for that integral new choice\nand I want to bring up something you\nactually in talking about\num becoming a leader and this idea of\nyou know the ego and this idea of\nbecoming a leader and you know\nemphasizing the importance of habits\num you use this this string of phrase as\nyou're getting ready to introduce a\nmethod that I want to talk about in a\nsecond but you you talk about being\nMaster being a master of managing change\nand I was just so struck\num by that and you're speaking that\npoint really beautifully and eloquently\nright here which is really honoring the\nchange Evolution growth expansion moving\nenergy if we really just want to\nsimplify it down to our core and like\nwhat we are that is the human Journey so\nfor all of us who are feeling stuck\nthere's a reason an explanation because\nit really is part of who we are in our\nDNA to change that doesn't mean though\nthat change and walking into the unknown\nfuture where I don't know what choices\nI'll have to make is comfortable though\nagain it is wired into our being and so\nagain just affirming for everyone\nlistening who's still feeling on that\nstuck end of the spectrum it's not that\nyou're damaged or broken or you're not\ngoing to be victim to the things that\nonce happened to you they're part of\nyour story I'm going to keep along with\nthe theme of this conversation though\nthey don't have to be and you reference\nthem in a method going by an acronym\nlove acronyms and you call it the cath\nmethod where you talk now about the the\nPractical right how do we begin to\nchange create new habits and you\nreference C being Choice a being\nacceptance and P being assistance and I\njust love the acronym and again as I\nknow many people listening to things\nlike this are hungry for okay well great\nhow do I change now how do I create\nthese habits how do I become a mask\nmaster of managing change so can you say\na little bit more about those those\nthree Choice acceptance and persistence\nit's funny because I know you love\nacronyms but I honestly can't stand them\nI I was never good at remembering what\nanything stood for so I was constantly\nasking people or trying to search up for\nGoogle like what does This Acronym mean\nuh I was like constantly surrounded with\nthem and yet here I am creating an\nacronym for people uh it's the irony\nright it's hilarious but I I think for\nme looking at it I wanted to create\nsomething that was visual so you can\neither say for me it was the cap on so\nlike a water bottle and here's what\nhappens for a lot of people and it's\nwhat happened to me they make the choice\nto accept that the current state that\nthey are in is all areas there's nothing\nelse and every single day there's\npersistently telling themselves all\nthese negative things and they're\nconstantly keeping the cap the\nmetaphorical cap on that bottle lid\ntight on all the negative there's no\npositive that's getting in there so what\nI say to people and what I show to\npeople in the book is the way you you've\ngot to reverse engineer that and you\ngotta have a completely different mind\nset shift this is exactly what I had to\ndo it's kind of like the light bulb\nmoment turning on for me and I I\nrealized hang on a minute\nI need to make the choice to accept that\nthe current state that I am in right now\nisn't all there is and I can work\npersistently to change in the best way\npossible and keep myself in the state of\nallowing more positive things into my\nlife I'm going to keep the metaphorical\ncap as tight as I possibly can and that\ncomes with daily practices and daily\nhabits and rituals which I I can share\nif you like that I have implemented into\nmy life you can Implement some of your\nown whether it's journaling I mention a\ncouple journaling is is a huge one I\nknow you're big on that uh Nicole\nthere's reading there is speaking with\npeople there is exercise there is seeing\ntherapist there's all kinds of things\nthat we can do in order to work towards\npersistently keeping those positive\naspects in our life and when those\nnegative things come you are aren't\ngoing to allow you're not going to\nunscrew the cap and allow them in but\nsometimes that does happen and when that\ndoes happen take it out and just\ncontinue the process every single time\nyou it's your cap you have the power\nwhether or not you allow the negative in\nand you keep it tight or you un unscrew\nit let all the negative out and then put\nthe positive back in so\nit's your choice to accept that in your\nlife and the persistence aspect to it uh\nis your willingness not to give up and I\nlove persistence there's a saying that\ncomes with that\nuh that I love sharing uh be persistent\nto remain consistent are the things that\nyou want so if you want to stay stuck\nand on the ground you're persistently\ngoing to keep yourself there but for me\nconsistency is the flow on effect of\nwhen I am persistent and I don't give up\nand it's like the analogy of someone two\npeople trying to dig for a diamond right\nuh one person is digging and digging and\nhe just gives up halfway meanwhile the\none next to him is digging for for\ndiamonds too\nbut he keeps on digging he doesn't give\nup and a lot of people they give up too\nquickly they allow the negative to\nconstrict them to control them and they\njust\nthat's it but I'm saying to people don't\ngive up\nand here's how\nhere's how you can get back into the to\nthe light and and never give up at any\nmore and if my life if Dr Nicole's life\nif anyone else's life that I share in\nthe book is any proof or example of how\nyou can continue to live this life in\nthe best way possible then\nI'm I'm I mean I've I've fulfilled my\npurpose I really have\nI love I love what you're you're talking\nabout here Jay and what you're talking\nabout is right being or allowing someone\nelse to be because this is how it begins\nI think for most of us a possibility not\nan exception because I know something\nthat my subconscious right based on all\nof my past life experiences and\nconditioning and beliefs led me to be\nthe person who looked to be the\nexception I would read about fantastic\npeople doing incredible things and\novercoming incredible odds and then I or\npart of my subconscious would it make me\nthe exception come up with all of the\nreasons why that could and will be the\ncase I wasn't diminishing them I was\nsaying oh okay you know good for you\nover there and I'm over here for reason\nX Y or Z and I'll never be able to be\nthat possibility or to see that in my\nlife um and what I think you very\nbeautifully and eloquently did in your\nkind of description of that method and\nreverse engineering is you actually\nbrought to the awareness that even if\nwe're stock and we're not acting as that\nperson and our life does look very\ndifferent you really highlight it the\nfact that that person is still\nessentially by not making a choice to\nchange making a choice every day and I\nthink that's the really gray area\nbecause we're so used to autopilot we\ncome to think that all of this world and\nthis way of being that we've been living\nfor however many decades for most of us\nright we just assume that that is us\nthat there is no other possibility we\ndon't even know how habitual we are\nbecause we're just going about our day\nin that autopilot State and really\nbringing that awareness which is you\nmight actually be making a choice by\nNicole not making a choice all day long\nand allowing that all right so you get\nreally kind of wrapped up in I think a\nlack of that awareness and when you see\nthat the choice to remain stuck might be\nthe choice that you continue to make\nhowever it is still a choice right it's\nthe choice to keep doing things day in\nand day out exactly as you have been and\nholding compassionate space for yourself\nwhile you're making that choice but\nagain honoring that you are making a\nchoice and I think that brings me to\nthis you talk at the end about\num when we're talking about choices and\nthis being and all of these actions that\nwe do every day you make a really\nbeautiful distinction and you talk about\nthe distinction this really might seem\nsimplistic for a lot of us though I\nthink when we live or think about the\nembodiment of this distinction and the\ndistinctions between\nWho You Are\nversus what you do\nand I think even just pausing there to\nright kind of offer to you for all\neveryone listening who might not have\nthat distinction what do you mean who I\nam is what I do right the role I play is\nwho I am\num can you give it like why is that a\ndistinction in your mind and what can we\nbegin to do to kind of separate that out\nif we are someone who feels so merged\nwith\nhow we show up or the roles we play and\nwe do feel like that makes us who we are\nit's a massive massive societal belief\nthat's ingrained within us whether or\nnot I was trying to figure out where it\nactually came from where I started to\nthink about it for myself and you know I\nI was surrounded by it growing up\nbelieve it or not like you you look at\nit from society's teachings whether it's\nmovies whether it's social media and I\nwas growing up and and social media was\njust starting to and that wasn't that\nlong ago I believe it or not I'm like 25\nI turned 20 26 on Monday but and I I was\nfor me i i s i strive for the better\npart of most of my life to be someone\nthat I thought that I was and I thought\nthat I was going to be the next Steven\nSpielberg he was my hero my idol so I\nendeavored whatever I did I lived\nbreathed everything revolving around\nfilm because that's what I thought my\nlife purpose and my life calling was to\nbe and so I Associated film with my\nidentity so whenever someone asked me\nwhat I did I'd say I'm a filmmaker no I\ndo filmmaking I am a filmmaker I\nassociate it 100 with the purpose and\nidentity and gave it so much\nsignificance and meaning in my life and\nso when that didn't happen the way I\nwanted it to happen\nand when things were going and crashing\nagainst everything that I wanted\nI had a clash of identity and I'm\nthinking hang on a minute what's going\non why don't I feel\nhappy fulfilled the society told me that\nwhen I get it and when I strive for it\nreally really hard that when I do get it\nI'm gonna be this major major success\nI'm going to be content\num but I didn't and it went the complete\nopposite way so then I really started to\nthink good and hard all right why am I\nhere on this Earth to for example why am\nI still alive for that fact and what is\nmy purpose what is my identity who is\nJay\nand I realized that here's the important\ntruth we need to start distinguishing\nbetween I am the verse I do who you are\nhas got nothing to do with what you do\nyou take who you are into what you do\nsee a lot of people they take they take\nwhat they do and make it who they are\nand that's the confusing aspect because\nit's got nothing to do with who you are\nand um if you if you take that what you\ndo into who you are you're just going to\nbe miserable for the rest of your life\nbut you are a unique human being you\nwere created to live this life to be\nalive and to live the very best way you\npossibly can that is your purpose on\nthis Earth just think about it life is\nthe most precious thing on the face of\nthis Earth and we take it so for granted\nit amazes me I know if it amazes you\nNicole but we take it like it's this\nit's not as valuable as what it should\nbe we throw it around\nbut we should value it we yes there are\nso many people out there that are\nsuffering and there's so much pain but I\nwant you to know there is pain and\npurpose\nthere is purpose and pain sorry there is\nall these aspects to your life that are\ngoing to make you better if you allow it\nto your your identity right now is to be\na person of good character if you want\nto be a person uh of Integrity this this\nis what I want to be at least a good\nleader because I've already got a lot of\nbad ones why add more bad ones to this\nworld this is going to make everyone\nfeel more miserable so\nfor me I realized that my identity was\nto be a service to use the gifts the\ntalents and the abilities to to help\nothers realize that they do have worth\ntheir story does matter and to show them\nthis is your identity it it is\nfundamental and and it's worked so much\nfor me so when I don't have all these\nthings that Society tells me I should\nhave I'm still happy I'm still content\nand I'm still fulfilled and so hopefully\nthat made sense to people when I\nexplained it properly\nI'm\nloving the quote when you acknowledge\nyou bring who you are into what you do\nand I really want listeners just to sit\non that for a moment as recovering still\nperfectionist overachiever as someone\nwho you know in in societal standpoints\nI checked many boxes I was quite\nsuccessful right in that very externally\ndriven way life should have\nbeen fulfilling been happy and when I\nyou know began my Dark Night of the soul\nI felt the farthest thing from all of\nthat making me feel even more broken\neven more shameful not seeing right all\nof the ways that I wasn't living in in\nmy purpose because I wasn't even\nconnected to myself to my story\num I definitely wasn't sharing\nvulnerably those aspects with not even\npersonal friends let alone being in a\nprofession that was taught never to be a\nhuman in the room which is a complete\nconversation from us for another\num complete topic for another\nconversation\num on the human side of things I was\nbuilt for that profession because I\ndidn't really even share my story or my\nvulnerable sides my emotions in my\npersonal relationships I was so caught\nup in playing that role in being who I\nthought I needed to be right and wearing\nthat badge of honor and all of those\ndifferent types of identity that the\ntruth of the matter is I wasn't really\neven being myself am I I wasn't\nembodying or living into my own story\nand I think that brings us before we end\nhere\num just kind of acknowledging and\nwondering kind of what role you know the\nthe podcast where we initially connected\nwhen I was a guest on your podcast story\nbox I mean that is really set around\nright this topic in and of itself this\nidea of talking about living in your\npurpose I mean you are a facilitator now\nyou are a stage\num for others as far as I view it at\nleast to share their stories um so talk\nabout kind of living in service as far\nas I see it that that I imagine is one\nof the intentions with the StoryBox\npodcast\nabsolutely uh I am\nforever grateful and forever blessed to\nbe able to to do the podcast I never\nthought that I would be where I am today\nwith the show uh and it's been this\nincredible evolution of change of\nlearning of just hearing people that\nhave been through far worse than what I\never have but not comparing myself but\nbeing able to relate to some of the\nthings and there's been so many things\nthat I have been able to relate to which\nhas been very very interesting for me to\nsee but it's also shown me that hey I'm\nhuman too we're all human it's part of\nliving this life the best way we can and\nnot being unkind towards people but\nbeing more kind and there's so many\naspects to the show so many lessons that\nI can share uh from all the incredible\npeople and even you uh Dr Nicola I've\nbeen following you for ages even before\nyou said yes to being on my show and\nbeing able to speak to you I was nervous\noriginally because I'm like you know\nhe's this amazing woman who helps so\nmany people why would she want to speak\nto me and so getting myself out of that\nthat state of and like even speaking\nwith Matthew McConaughey Tony Robbins\nall these people and just realizing that\nthey're humble they're kind they give me\nthe time of day and they're present with\nme you're being present right now you're\nreacting to things that I'm saying and\nfor me that's the kind of person that I\nwant to become as well someone that is\nkind that gives people time that is\npresent that you know is just constantly\nworking as hard as I possibly can to be\na help to be of service to those people\nthat are struggling because I know it's\nnot easy but if my example with my life\nand if your life Nicole or other peoples\nthat listen to it that have their story\nunboxed as it were for everyone to see\nthese vulnerable moments these\ncourageous moments these these moments\nwhere you know it is life-changing and I\nthink Tim Ferriss said the good stuff\nsticks and for me there's a lot of stuff\nthat has stuck with me and at the age\nthat I am I know I'm not all I'm not\never going to be there I don't believe\nit but I'm always going to be curious\nI'm always going to want to learn as\nbest I possibly can I love the aspect of\nconversation we need to have more\nconversations we need to ask more\nquestions we need to be forever curious\nbecause no one was ever killed or hurt\nbut being curious and I think Society\ntries to get rid of the Curiosity\nbecause they want you to live a certain\nway they want you to live this way but I\nalways will uh and for as long as I live\nEndeavor to share the curiosity is\nalways going to be a good thing it\nteaches you it can teach you what not to\ndo it can teach you what to do and I\njust\nuh forever grateful Nicole honestly to\nto have the show the story box to write\na book like this and to be where I am\ntoday I never take it for granted and if\nI do then shame on me\num no I'm just kidding but I need to\nwhenever that happens Nicole honestly\nI'm always always humbled it's amazing\nthe moment I start uh being proud or\narrogant\nincredibly how fast I am just brought\nback to my knees and just shown hey\nyou're not infallible you're not better\nthan anyone else you're a human being\nyou've got blood you've got bones in\nyour body so start acting like a human\nbeing that's not better than someone\nelse\nDJ for for doing that and going back to\nsomething you you were speaking just a\ncouple minutes ago with seeing the\nhumanity I I think at least begins when\nwe're curious to be then present right\nthis kind of is going to tie in all\nthese Concepts very beautifully to\nsomeone else and their story or their\nunique Journey or the wisdom right that\nthey can share with you and miraculously\noften what happens is you see that\nkernel of similarity of humanity of and\nthen we come back to that earlier point\nthat we kept touching on connection now\nyou don't Feel So Right deeply alone and\nall of that became kind of the Domino of\npossibility where you were curious to be\npresent with someone else outside of\nyourself only two well Circle discover\nhow not outside of yourself you ever\nwere and I'm getting chills even as I'm\nsaying this\num and it's really you know so so\nbeautiful and such an integral part of\nyour new book The Path of an eagle right\nall through the pages you were\nvulnerable you opened up you shared the\ngift of your story\num I appreciate you diving in even\ndeeper with me here today on this chat\nand I'm so excited for members of the\ncommunity to be exposed to here and\nbefore we end can you let us all know\nthe official\nrelease date I guess it would be um of\nthe new book where anyone can get their\nhands on it and where the best place is\nto connect or to follow along with you\noutside of course of the StoryBox\npodcast which I definitely shout out\nthank you so much Nicole I want to see\nyour support like I said is honestly it\nmeans the world to me knowing that I've\ngot you in my corner I've got so many\nother great people in my corner\nsupporting myself this message uh it\njust yeah I can't I don't want to take\nit for granted so like returning the\nfavor or whatever it is I I'm I'm here\nfor it and if I end up getting a much\nbigger audience or platform then I want\nto shout your message even further you\nknow so uh people can get the book where\nthe books are sold Amazon it's called\nthe path of an eagle uh just type that\nin on Amazon or wherever I'm sure Dr\nNicole have the link to make it easier\nfor you yeah I'll link below\num but then also you know I do want to I\ndo want to say\nso that there is this negative stigma\naround society that men can't share that\nmen are somehow Weak by sharing no it\ntakes more strength for a man to\nactually share and even a woman too the\nshare their vulnerabilities it takes a\nlot of Courage so I want to destroy that\nstigma and say if you are a man or if\nyou're even a woman that is\nstruggling with\nsharing with anyone\nyou're not alone there is someone out\nthere like me like you that has suffered\nor you know has been through a lot and\nthere is connectiveness there is\na place for you in this community in\nthis world and you matter more than you\nknow\nI love that I second everything that you\njust beautifully put into words gay it's\none of the biggest Inspirations that I\nhave for creating the community of self\ndealers and now\num my circle membership is to to break\ndown to create the safe space I should\nfirst say the Safe Community where these\nconversations can happen very similar to\nwhat you do on the podcast right that\nthat is a a\nthat is something of providing or\nprovision in and of itself the ability\nto be someone like yourself that allows\npeople to feel safe to open up that is\nsomething in and of itself to be\nacknowledged um creating the safe space\nwhere people can feel okay to go there\nis huge\num and again it's a living inspiration\nfor why I'm so focused now on\ntranslating what used to be just done in\na room behind a company you know behind\nthe screen and we don't really talk\nabout what happens in the therapy room\nout in this more Community Way\nunderstanding how important those spaces\nand those relationships are having\nsomeone who can kind of get what you're\nsaying when you might be surrounded by\npeople in your immediate environment who\nkind of have no idea what you're talking\nabout especially as you start to I think\nreckon with some of these new Concepts\nor go back to our past and a lot of\npeople especially into adulthood that's\nthe last place we ever want to go or\nlook at or talk about\num so again I want to honor your courage\nYour vulnerability and I do you know\nagree with you that societally there's\ndifferent levels and types of messaging\nthat we get and anytime I I see you know\nsomeone who identifies as a male who's\nbeen kind of raised with all of that\nconditioning to so readily be able to\nspeak their story knowing how scary it\nprobably is internally\num I just want to again honor you and\nthank you for your time for who you are\nin the world and now for gifting us with\nthis book so path of an eagle will make\nsure everything is dropped into the show\nnotes so for easy access and I look\nforward to continuing to stay connected\nwith you in your journey\nthank you so much Dr Nicole like I said\nbefore and I'll keep saying it you're a\nhuge blessing I am so grateful for you\nyour work and you do it so so well so\nplease don't stop you we need you so\nthank you once again for sharing my\nstory today\nthank you thank you of course all right\ncaught\ncool I'm not gonna turn off the\nrecording because I want to get the\nintro in um and obviously save idea\nthank you for that\nno thank you honestly I hope that was\ngood uh great I was able to share I\ndidn't ramble too much I have a tendency\nto go on different left field don't\nforget the question I was actually asked\nso I'm trying to get in the mindset of\nof flipping asking the questions and\nactually talking about the book which is\nan interesting experience but yeah\nanyway I think you did great um I think\nthe conversation went exactly where it\nneeded to and I I know that there's\ngoing to be so much\num value for for people listening in all\ndifferent ways on whether it's going and\ngrabbing your book or again just hearing\nor this might be the door that opens a\nbit of curiosity for someone who might\nnot have wanted to go there so I just\nthank you I'll be thinking about you in\nthe next couple weeks as I imagine it's\ngoing to get crazy\num and I'll be looking on my mail to get\nmy hands on the actual copy of the book\nit's coming and there's something also\nspecial that's in the mail too so keep\nan eye out yeah as well hopefully my\npublisher actually uh did what I asked\nthem to so we never know let me know so\nit's a crap [ __ ] you know I'm familiar\nwith this kind of request where it's\nlike yeah okay you get it\nthe multiple accounts you're amazing\nholding you in heart thank you\nthank you so much Nicole take care be\nWest and stay safe until next time my\nfriend until next time"
