    "transcript": "I'm doing inner child work\nwhat's that oh it's when you start to\nacknowledge the inner child that lives\ninside of you and all of the things that\nit's experienced what does that do we're\nlittle and we're regularly screamed at\nshamed or criticized we don't use logic\nor our thinking brain we fully feel\ntrauma's impact in our nervous system\nand in our brain development as adults\nthis will be called depression anxiety\nbipolar or borderline personality\ndisorder wow that makes a lot of sense\nwhat's a good place to start I start\nwith writing a short letter to my inner\nchild each day in my journal I let them\nknow that they're safe that they're able\nto say no that they don't have to please\nanyone and I let them know that I'm\ngoing to practice self-care and have\nclear boundaries now these are things I\ndidn't have growing up and they help my\ninner child heal I also made my phone\nbackground a picture of myself at age\nfive so I can remind myself that when\nI'm being mean I'm also being mean to\nthat inner child it helps me to be more\nself-compassionate"
