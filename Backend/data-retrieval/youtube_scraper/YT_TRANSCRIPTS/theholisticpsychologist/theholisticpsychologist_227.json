    "transcript": "i am so excited for today's interview\nwith a colleague of mine that i\nconnected with on of all things\ninstagram\ndr becky kennedy her work on parenting\nis so in alignment and she has a new\nbook coming out called good inside and\ni'm super excited to introduce her to\nyou all so who is dr becky kennedy dr\nbecky kennedy is a columbia university\ntrained clinical psychologist and mom of\nthree who is rethinking the way we raise\nour children\nnamed the millennial parent whisperer by\ntime magazine she specializes in\nthinking deeply about what's happening\nfor our children and translating these\nideas into simple actionable steps for\nparents to use in their homes with their\nown kids\ndr becky's goal is to empower parents to\nfeel sturdier and more equipped to\nhandle all of the different challenges\nthat they might face\nraising their kids today she's with us\nto discuss and explore her new book good\ninside which will be released this\ncoming september i'm so excited for this\nconversation\nsuper excited thank you so much dr becky\nkennedy for joining me here today to\ntalk about your new book good inside\nwell thank you\nso much for having me and i can't wait\nto have what i know will be a really\nimportant and really fun conversation\nabsolutely i can't remember at this\npoint when you and i crossed social\nmedia paths but i do know being so blown\naway um by your work and how you\ntranslate\na lot of these big ideas especially in\nthe world of parenting and i do want to\ni think begin with our field and what we\nhad thought for a long time in terms of\nparenting and the model of really how to\ninstruct even though i don't really love\nthat word but mentor give parents the\ntools um i think all of us kind of\nacknowledging that while i'm not a\nparent so i can't speak to that myself\nwhen we do come to the stage of our life\nwhere we have children i do think a lot\nof us very much have the intention of\nyou know showing up doing things a bit\ndifferently and really helping shape our\nchild's lives ultimately and again in\nthe field and we could i think perhaps\nstart there i don't think we've been\ngiven the really understandable\npractical\neven efficient effective i don't even\nknow how to describe it the way to\nunderstand parenting and really\ntranslate the tools into action i think\nhas largely been lacking so i since i\nsaw your work and the way you kind of\nthought about parenting and really\ntalked about it in such that\nunderstanding and applicable way i just\nthink it's so incredibly necessary for\nthese future generations\noh thank you and and yeah i mean i i\nthink i agree there i mean i\ni started working with all these parents\nin my practice and\nrealized that some of them they really\nweren't looking for therapy they were\nmaybe\nlooking to work on some things in\nthemselves but they were presenting\nbecause their kid was really struggling\nand it just just regulated the whole\nfamily system and\nwhat happened next is i actually said\nokay well i want to get extra training\nand how to work with parents like i feel\nlike that's something i was like well\nwhen you want to do something new you\nget extra training and so i went to one\nof these centers that claims to be like\nthis evidence-based\ncenter and\nas someone who likes science i was like\ni like evidence like i think sure\neverything that sounds good i want that\nand\nand it was all about time-outs and\npunishments and sticker charts and\nrewards and ignoring and attending and\ni have to be honest i just say it right\nout like at first i was like this is\namazing like i know exactly what to do\nthis makes so much sense because it does\nin your brain like pure logic is like\nyes yes yes that makes sense get more of\nthe good extinguish the bad\nand i literally heard myself\ngiving guidance to a parent in\nmy practice and i literally stopped my i\nwas like i really don't even believe\nwhat i'm saying like i actually don't\nknow how to help you right now but this\nisn't it so like at the very least i'm\ngonna refund you but like\nand then\nwhat struck me after\nwas\nlike i know the way i work with adults\nin therapy i know what ends up helping\nthem like the work they do\nand why can't we take that and that\ninformation and that\nprocess\nand like reverse engineer that back to\nparents in a way that they can\ninteract with their kids and help their\nkids when they struggle in a way that\nwould\nsupport\ndevelopment in the long term would build\nthe skills that we want our kids to have\nat 22 and 40 and of course if you don't\nhave them at 22 and 40 it's never too\nlate right um and yet like it's\nit's hard you know it's a thing to do\nand so that's really what guided me and\nyou know i think one of the things about\ntimeouts and punishments and sticker\ncharts that i like i appreciate\nis as a parent you just want to know\nwhat to do like feeling invested as a\nparent which every parent does loving\nyour kid and seeing your kids struggle\nit's really really hard and painful and\nwhat makes it\nlike just beyond painful is to think\nlike i don't even know what to do that's\na horrible feeling and\nknowing that timeouts and sticker charts\nthey're so concrete and they do give\nparents clarity i realized like if i'm\ngonna try to do something different and\nput it into a system it has to be\nas clear and as concrete as those other\napproaches because i feel like at the\nend of the day when we're overwhelmed we\nchoose clarity over anything else\nand so\nthat's like what i set out to do and\nthen\nthis book really puts it all in one\nplace a totally different approach yeah\ni think you're really you know speaking\na truth there and acknowledging that you\nknow when we're when one is overwhelmed\num we really do and i mean not to speak\nfor you but i know having had what\nsounds like a similar experience in a\ntreatment room with clients for me\nfeeling disempowered not fully believing\nwhat i'm saying and or if i did believe\nit not seeing the change the evidence\nand so not having\nthe what to offer next the concrete tool\nor even more so complicated when you\ndon't see the concrete tools that's\nnecessarily changing\nthe behaviors then it does feel\noverwhelming and i can imagine being the\nparent again knowing how it felt to be\nthe clinician who's supposed to be the\nhelper imagine that times a thousand\nwhere you do very much you know\nunderstand to some level that you do\nneed to be the sturdy leader to use your\nlanguage you do need to show up in\nservice of your child and their needs\nbut not knowing the how i think really\njust\ncomplicates it and you wrote something\nreally beautiful um\nin terms of this discussion and you said\nswitching the parenting mindset from\nconsequences or this idea of behaviorism\nlike the charts the stickers um that\nkind of reward or punishment idea around\nbehavior in particular and you offer\nthe very wise need for changing\nswitching the mindset from consequences\nto connections and going on to stay to\nsay that understanding that behaviors\nitself are only the tip of an iceberg i\nlove a visual\nand that below the surface is the\nchild's entire entire internal world\njust begging to be understood and just\nhaving that visual again right so\nclinically for so long all we're\nfocusing on is that tip um reacting to\nthat tip from a very well intentioned\nway but not seeing everything below it\nand\nyeah second\nbehaviorism\nis just so steeped\nin our culture at least in america i\ncan't like it is just it's an education\nit's in child rearing like to the point\nthat like we've just accepted it as a\ntruth like i feel like it's been moved\nto like the non-fiction area the library\nlike i don't know how exactly that\nhappened but when you take out a book\nfrom non-fiction you expect it to be\ntrue so\nyou know and that idea of behavior is\nthe tip of the iceberg i think what\nparents who are kind of new to some of\nthese ideas which is most people because\nagain we weren't parented this way\nthey'll say something like okay so if\ni'm not punishing my kid for hitting\nlet's say her sister\nthen like you do nothing like it's just\nokay to hit and it's this really either\nor mindset right where the assumption\nunder that\nis that if i don't punish a behavior i'm\ncondoning a behavior if i don't punish a\nbehavior my kid's gonna do more of that\nbehavior and\ni think at the very least it's just it's\na really nasty view of human development\nto think that people develop in this\nbehavioral way and i think like anyone\nlistening right now if you have a say if\nyou have a partner you have a friend and\nyou just had a horrible horrible day\nlike it was just everything you spent\nyour coffee in the beginning you got\nyelled at you lost\n20 whatever\nand then if you came home\nand your partner said to you like\noh you didn't unload the dishwasher just\nlike you know and like enough you're\nlike\nyou don't want to say that to me right\nand then you say like you don't do\nanything and you know like why don't you\non the like you just totally have this\nyou know big quote disproportionate\nreaction because right let's say you say\nthat\nlike i'm just picturing me in that\nmoment if my husband said to me i that\nis it go to your room and no tv for a\nweek okay like or i am taking away that\nnecklace i bought you yesterday okay\nlike i don't think that makes me any\nless likely to yell at him probably more\nlikely to yell at him\nif alternatively he said you know becky\nwell something is going on and like i\nneed a moment because whoa and i also\nreally don't like can you talk to me\nthat way and\nyou must be having a really hard time\nwith things beyond what i asked you to\nhave reacted that way and\ni'm gonna cry thinking about this um\nmaybe my husband will watch this and say\nthis to me one day um if he said like i\ncare more about what you're struggling\nwith\nthan the thing you just said to me so\nlike let's just both cool off and like\nfigure this out together\nlike i just want to know the person who\nafter it'd be like oh my goodness my\nhusband just gave me permission to yell\nat him i'm going to be more likely to\nyell at him because he condoned that\nlike it's just\nnot how we work like it's like we're so\nafraid that if you see a kid under a\nstruggle like that's what sets things\noff the rails like it's just and it's so\nimportant to come back i think to\nourselves like yeah no i wouldn't be\nmore likely to yell like i need that i\nwould need that i and\nthat i think is so\nthe source of truth of like where i try\nto come back to is just reminding myself\nmy kid is not some like animal that is\ntrying to be trained in compliance my\nkid is closer to me and like what would\ni need\nand what do humans need and it's all the\nsame stuff at any age\nwell i think what you're getting to is\nanother quote that i really want to\nhighlight and i believe really what is\nthe foundation of your your movement of\nyou know good inside parenting of even\nthe title of your book where you write\nand i think this is so beautiful i'm\nactually getting chills even thinking\nabout it and it very much aligns you\nknow kind of with with my belief and\nwhat you say is you speak of the\nprinciple of internal goodness\nwe are all good inside at our core we\nare compassionate\nloving\nand generous and you know as i talk a\nlot about heart centered and going back\nand where i locate what makes us us\nwhatever you want to call it spirit soul\nintuition essence that thing\nagain i i locate that in the organ of\ncare of compassion so very much in\nalignment and talk to me about you know\nand how this is i think a big shift and\ni think kind of what we're talking about\nhere if we can drop back into this idea\nof internal goodness\num i do think that is really\nfoundational and what i see and hear\nfrom your work\nyeah and you know i i don't think anyone\nwill walk into uh you know a therapist\nor psychologist or parent coach office\nand that person's ever gonna say well i\nbelieve kids are bad inside so here's\nwhat we do like no one says that but all\nof these more behavior first approaches\nthat are really based in behavior\nshaping and control\nthan they are in anything else the only\nreason\nyou need to control someone is because\nyou don't trust them like i think\ncontrol and trust are opposites right\nthe only reason you need to so\ncarefully shape someone's behavior is\nbecause you don't believe that\ninternally they have some internal\ngoodness strive that would bring out\nthat behavior like the only reason i\nneed to say we're over to my kid say\nthank you say thank you thank you parent\nthank you because like i don't think\nover time they'll develop that impulse\nfrom intrinsic motivation\nand\nso while no one explicitly says kids are\nbad inside because anyone said that we'd\nbe like that just sounds wrong\npsychology and parenting psychology kind\nof guidance i actually think is based in\nthat assumption i really do\nand when you realize or you if you\nbelieve or you try to experiment with\nthe belief that even that like okay my\nkid is good inside\nthe reason i think it's so powerful\nis not because then it's an anything\ngoes approach like i've never said like\nwell my kid is good inside so i don't\ncare that they spit at me because\nthey're good enough\nobviously not just doesn't even make\nsense of course i care but it creates a\ngap\nbetween my kids internal goodness and\ntheir not so good behavior\nand if you have a gap in that way you\ncan start being curious and like to me\nthat's where\nwe all win like in that curiosity space\nlike why is my kid who's good inside\nspitting at me why is my kid who's good\ninside lying to my face why is my kid\nwho's good inside hitting her sister\nlike and now if i can have that gap\nbetween a behavior which is not so great\nand a kid who's good inside\nnow i can wonder from a place of seeing\nmy kid as like a teammate\nnot as a problem and everything i do\nfrom there in terms of an intervention\nis going to actually be different than\nif i see my kids behavior as a sign\nof their identity and then everything\nthere is going to come from control and\nan adversarial position\nyeah that's really beautiful and i think\njust playing a tape forward you know\nhaving a lot of\nadults um you know in my own community a\nlot of us retain that right that this\nthat merger of my behaviors are me and i\nactually we just jenna and i released a\npodcast episode a couple weeks ago that\nwas really resonating with the community\non the topic of shame and how deep\nrooted so much of our shame is in\nadulthood and i can imagine this is one\nof the trajectories right if i have had\nno space\nbetween and again oftentimes and about\nvery well-intentioned household with\nparents and caregivers who were limited\nby again how they themselves were\nparented though what happens is we do\nbegin to merge ourselves with our\nbehaviors and then we carry well into\nadulthood this deep-rooted feeling of\nunworthiness of unlovability um that\nagain attaches\nour worth with our\nactions and creating that space i think\nis and like going back to that first\nquote right pulling it back\nunderstanding what's driving it from\nthat goodness there might be behaviors\nthat we want to shift or change or or\nmodify in any way but with that\nseparation allows us i think to to break\nthat pattern of shame\ni mean i yes like 100 to all of that and\ni think you know for anyone listening i\nthink there's a group of people who are\nlike yes that just feels better like my\nkid is good inside of course and i am\ngood inside\nand then there's another group of people\nand i have both these parts in me we\nprobably all do that's just like i'm\njust like focused on like effectiveness\nlike just like like what's effective\nright which i appreciate okay there's\nnothing wrong with thinking that way\nhere's the irony\nof it all\nlike coming down harshly on your kid for\ntheir behavior your kid's gonna tie that\nto their identity they're gonna think\nlike i got sent away when i hit my\nsister and i got punished so like in\norder to get control in order to get\ngetting they have to tell themselves the\nstory of badness right and then they\nhave that shame experience\nwe we freeze in shame like you know\nright like we literally our bodies\nfreeze like i don't know someone who\nwould ever think a frozen state is\nconducive to movement like you literally\nand if movement is changed like you\nliterally can't change when you feel\nshame right like you knows at home we've\nbeen trying for centuries to shame\nourselves and to change\ndoesn't seem to work not terribly\neffective because all of our energy has\nto go to self-preservation if we feel\nbad inside we we have to like really\nreally shut down so parents say well\naren't you letting the kid off the hook\nand again\nthe good inside approach has such firm\nboundaries to it there's such parental\nauthority without punishment but you\ndon't let a kid off the hook by not\nshaming them in punishment\ni actually think you let them off the\nhook for change by punishing them\nbecause you've made them frozen so if\nyou want your kid never to change and\nyou want them to be let off the hook\ncool punish away yell away call them\nnames if you want your kid to be on the\nhook for growth and development and\nchange just from a pure effectiveness\nstandpoint we have to keep blame and\nshame out of it we just have to\nright you're right i love this this\nconversation because you write\nchildren who are left alone with intense\ndistress\noften rely on two coping mechanisms\nself-doubt and self-blame and then you\ngo on to say that parents i love how you\nbreak down the job so parents have the\njob of establishing safety through just\nuse one of the words through boundary\nthrough validation through empathy and\nchildren have the job of learning and\nexploring through experience and\nexpressing their emotions\nyeah i mean right like you work with so\nmany adults like\nand i've worked with so many adults\nthat's like the most interesting thing\npeople always ask me about my experience\nwith child therapy and i used to do that\nbut i actually feel like all my ideas\nabout parenting come from\nmy work with adults i have never had an\nadult come to my office i'm guessing you\nhave into your office or to your\ncommunity who says my parents got all\nthe frustration and anger out of me like\nthey just\nthey got it out and i didn't feel it\nagain and it's amazing\nbut we see so many adults who may may\nnot say this but essentially they're\nlike i am a 40 year old who has the same\ncoping skills as a as a one-year-old i\nnever learned to cope right so like you\ncan't unfeel a feeling ever you're gonna\nhave all the feelings for the rest of\nyour life so i would rather my kids get\nto the age of 18 and 40 and be like wow\ni have better coping mechanisms than i\ndid when i was young because the\nfeelings are coming my way it's just a\nmatter of if i'm prepared to cope or not\nyou can't protect people from those\nthings you just have to prepare them\nand so your kid's job then like their\nactual job in their younger years is to\nfeel all the feelings because you can't\nlearn skills\nfor a feeling unless you have it but you\ngot to go through the tunnel to do the\nlearning and so that's actually their\njob\nand yeah in a parent's job and this is i\nthink everything always for me does come\nback to family jobs because that's the\nclarity right that's like if you know\nwhat you need to do even if it's hard\nyou feel okay\nand we know that maybe not we know but\nthe validation empathy piece is although\nlike you're allowed to feel that way and\nand i get it right okay so we can go\ninto that more but the other piece is\nthe piece i think that especially the\nmedia like they they never\nthey never represent well because if a\nkid is having a massive tantrum or is\nhitting if you go up\nto your kid who's hitting her sister and\nyou're just like you're allowed to feel\nmad like no i do not give that much\napproval like that would be very\ndisregulating for a kid who'd be like do\nyou see what i'm doing like you're just\ngonna let me keep pummeling my sister no\nthe thing i think that is\none of the differentiators about the\ngood inside approach is the way that it\nteaches parents and\nit's true especially women\nto embody their authority\nand set\nfirm\nboundaries for themselves and for their\nkids which in that example would be i\nwill not let you hit your sister and\nthen there might be a physicality to it\nnot cruel but you might have to actually\nremove your child you might have to\nactually separate them or hold your\ndaughter's wrist and say i will not let\nyou hit your sister you're mad i get it\nwe're gonna have to figure out a\ndifferent way because my job is to keep\neveryone safe and right now that means\nseparating you that's actually like a\nreally empowered position as a parent\nthat's from boundaries you also\nempathize you see the goodness in your\nkid you're not sending them away you're\nnot saying hopefully what's wrong with\nyou\nbut the boundaries piece the keeping\npeople safe stepping in to stopping the\ndamage the making key decisions\nthat's a really really important part of\nkind of like good inside parenting as\nwell yeah well let's kind of dive into\nthat just a bit deeper if you don't mind\nbecause what i am as a fellow you know a\nhistoric i should say\nboundaryless people pleaser you know\nvery much embodying difficulty in all of\nthose areas where you know the reason\nwhy i raised my hand so readily when you\ntalked about being in a 40 year old body\nwith no coping mechanisms um i\ndisconnected so long from very\noverwhelming emotions that when i'm\nhearing you to parent we have to have\ni'm imagining a sense of safety with\nemotions in general if we're gonna be\nable to co-experience our child right\ngoing off the wall and being able to\nstay in that boundary safe space to\noffer that sturdy leadership so just\nkind of imagining and i know that a lot\nof the community really struggles in\nthat same way with their own feelings\nwith creating safety with creating\nboundaries um and don't feel necessarily\ncomfortable doing that so what is the i\nguess individual role of your own\njourney in your own emotional resilience\nand how can that you know translate over\nand how can we overcome some of the\ndifficulties in trying to embody that\nrole when it is difficult in our own\nlives i know big question\nyeah well this like is the question\nright and i think it's what any\nparenting approach that's just about\nwhat to say to your kid or do\nit misses the mark because the emotional\nplace you'll be in and the moment that\ndifficult thing happens is gonna dictate\nkind of\nthe circuit that gets activated in your\nbody\nand if that circuit is an old one\nthat is a reactive one right from your\nown history then like it doesn't even\nmatter how much you've read a certain\nbook right it's just not lit it's\nliterally not gonna be available to you\nso yeah this is everything and i think\nthat as parents if you if you think\nabout even that just example like my kid\njust hit\nher sister i think about that idea of\nstepping in\nand like embodying authority and like\nsetting that firm boundary and i also\nthink about that other part of my job of\nlooking at my kid even in that moment\nas a good kid having a hard time not a\nbad kid doing bad things i think that's\nactually the sole thing our kids absorb\nfrom us in the moment which way we look\nat\nhim um often we have trouble we might\nhave trouble with both that's fine still\nnothing wrong with you but often we have\nmore trouble with one side of that\nequation is it the like stepping in in\nthe firm boundary is it the validation\nand the seeing the goodness under the\nkind of difficult behavior\nand i think it's like a next step we're\ngonna make this concrete\nlike the things that are hard for us to\ngive our kids are the things we clearly\ndon't have in excess in our own body\nforget an exit so you might not even\nhave at like a minimal you know way\nso\nif you let's say like grew up in a\nfamily that never saw your emotional\nlife right that you would have if you\nknow yeah if i would have hit my sister\ni know exactly what would have happened\nit would have been like what's wrong\nwith you why can't you be nice like your\nsister go to your room and come out when\nyou have something nice to say okay what\ndoes that mean you just became your\nbehavior in that moment you just were\ndefined by hitting you are not a person\nwho is having a hard time in that moment\nyou are a bit a bad thing and you're a\nbad kid so if we think about\nwhat might have happened in your body\nright after that well you're in your\nroom alone and the only thing you have\nto kind of have control is self-plane\nright so what happens you develop this\ncircuit of like if i just didn't feel\nmad or feel jealous or whatever the\nfeeling was and you you blame yourself\nand you probably even create a part of\nyou that yells at yourself like in order\nto try to like stop you and help you\nknow you function in your family okay so\nnow you're with your kids and you're\nthinking okay like now i'm an adult\nright i'm going to make different\ndecisions and we do have to have that\nintention\nbut you see this scenario and i always\nfeel like what happens in the body is\nyour body like scans and it's like of\nall your circuits like what do i know\nabout this situation okay and like apart\nit's like i don't i know exactly what to\ndo it's it's confused it's confused\nabout the time it's confused about what\nyear it is but especially if it's very\npracticed it's very overzealous and it\nwill jump and that part of you is the\none that says what is wrong with you you\nare so nasty right and so even though\nyou're thinking\noh i just really just read that book or\nright i just did this thing yeah that\ncircuit\nyou know we just we can't beat a part of\nus that was put in place to protect us\nuntil it feels over time like\num like we're safe you know and so\nre-parenting and i know obviously that's\na huge part of your work but that idea\nof really like becoming aware of your\nbody becoming aware that you real things\ninside you they're real even if you\ncan't represent them in the way we\nrepresent other real things not only are\nthey real they're important\nthere's messages for you\nthey're um\nthere's things that were never your\nfault there's things that you still have\na part of you screaming out that it\nneeds that's probably waiting for you as\nthe adult now to give\nthat work\ncombined with then i think we all need a\nlittle like extra tip or script or\nstrategy but that work i would think it\nhelps you then access\nthat strategy because it helps your body\nbe able to be in a more grounded sturdy\nplace realizing it's 20 22. right it is\n20 22 i'm safe high part of me that's\ntrying to jump out okay i'm asking just\nsome person asking you to step back\nright i can do this one step at a time\nbut that work\nfirst of all it helps you feel better as\na person it's it's also the single best\ngift it's like the best strategy\nyou could ever even use with your kids\nyeah i couldn't agree more and i think\nthat\nthe shame relieving aspect of it that i\nthink some people even just hearing this\nwill will receive you know that\nunderstanding of why because and again i\nwould see this in my clients week after\nweek as as insight went up right as i\nunderstood my patterns as i maybe even\nhad a plan of action this new thing i'm\ngonna do next time\nin that space before i'm actually able\nto\nembody this new experience and those\nreally reactive moments when all of our\nneurobiology really is at that hair\ntrigger like you're describing those are\nthe hardest times and those are the\ntimes i think without understanding the\nwhy again that i am so wired in this\nadaptive you know actual biological\nphysiological response that's why it\ndoes feel like\nit's over the limit right i've kind of\nreached that point this is how i\ndescribe it and i experience it myself\nthat point of no return i call it it's\nlike there is a train chugging down\nthose tracks and no amount of that\ninsight is online anymore no amount of\nthat awareness yet right after the fact\ndamn here comes all of the shame of what\nis wrong with me how could i be so\nhurtful so mean to either myself or\nagain if we're talking about children to\nthese humans that i love so much so\nagain while it doesn't change the\nbehaviors and big reason why i evolved\nmy own practice even my understanding\nand then my practice of embodying the\nphysical person the shell the body again\nis because it's not enough right that\nshame the understanding of where it came\nfrom can get us and relieve us maybe of\nthat self-judgment of that shame but we\nstill have those you know really\ncritical moments of how can i\nembody a new choice and to speak to your\npoint i think that you wove in there\nit's identifying the fact that we still\nas a parent have our own needs even if\nwe do have a family of responsibility\naround us we do reach a depleted state\nof energy of physical you know of\nemotional resources that once they're\ngone\neven though the family is still there in\nneed of us in some way we're really\nincreasing the likelihood of that\nreactivity 100 right like our triggers\nyeah comes from our past and our old\ncircuits but also like there's a lot of\npresent moment\nyou know stuff that comes into play too\nand you know now we're really getting\ngoing but this\nthis idea around is parenthood i think\nreally it's like motherhood and\nfemininity\nof um you know this selflessness you\nknow this giving like\nthere is nothing as disturbing to me as\na selfless mother like the term selfless\nlike i actually find like i actually\nfind it disturb like selfless like\nwithout access to self like i can't\nimagine i'd ever want a pilot who like\ncannot access their self for\ndefinitely not that's like oh like\nyou're just free floating like to me i\nalways say about people like i'm\nattracted to people like where i can\nlike locate them like i can just\nwhere they are that means like that\nperson has access to self selfless\nparenting benefits zero people like i\nreally mean that like it doesn't even\nbenefit kids like the idea that a kid\nwould benefit from seeing their parent\njust waste away and lose access to every\npart of them except for maybe one a\ncaregiving part which then of course\nyou're in a constant cycle of depletion\nand not feeling fulfilled like why would\nthat be good for a child in some ways\nthey would just see themselves as like\nmonstrous like look what i just did my\npoor parent i just destroyed their life\nyou know so i just i really call\nlike major on that narrative\nand the idea instead that like i i i'm a\nparent of three kids right being a\nparent being caregiver is of course it's\na huge part of my identity it's a huge\npart of my decision making right and\nlike there's other parts of me as well\nand\ni think this goes back to that idea of\nfamily jobs so much and why it's so\nimportant\nis that if i think about my job as\nsetting boundaries kind of making these\nbig decisions and validating and\nempathizing with my kids feelings my\nkids job is to feel their feelings okay\nthis is like there's there's often this\nlike csoc goes back and forth and we can\nsee the way we can still kind of claim\nspace for ourselves when you think about\nthose jobs so\njust the other night i went to dinner\nwith my husband and friends like that's\nimportant to me like that's really\nimportant to me do i do that every\nsingle night i don't because i think\nthere's something being with my kids and\nputting them to bed and being there i\ndid last night my daughter did not like\nit wasn't a fan wasn't a fan of my\ndecision okay so she was why do you have\nto go out why do you have to go out okay\nselfless parenting i don't have a self\nokay i get something sometimes i'll\nactually make the reservation at 9 30\neven though i don't know i don't know\nwhat adults go to dinner at 9 30\nbut um so if i go back to family jobs my\njob is my decision and empathizing with\nher feelings you can only empathize with\nsomeone's feelings if it's their\nfeelings not if they seep into yours it\nis not my feeling that she's upset that\nis her feeling and her job is to feel\nher feelings so if we played this out i\nsaid some version and i think this is\nthe clear boundary with so many things\nwe don't set as parents i am going out\nto dinner here's why i love being your\nmom i really do and i love so many of\nthose nights we cuddle and i put you to\nbed and i also love being a wife and\nbeing an adult and seeing my friends and\nhaving time with them when none of our\nkids are around and so i am going to\ndinner i know you're not happy i get\nthat like i hated when my parents went\nout to dinner two and some version of\nyou're allowed to be upset right\nmy kids feelings should not dictate my\nboundaries and my boundaries should not\ndictate their feelings like just because\ni think it's a good decision to go out\nto dinner my daughter does not have to\nbe on board with that decision and i\ndon't need her blessing\nalso just because my kid's upset\ndoesn't mean i made a bad decision and\nit definitely doesn't mean i have to\nchange my decision and actually when our\nkids see that their feelings\nchange a decision that we previously\nwanted to make\nthat feels really bad for them because\nessentially you feel like oh the\nfeelings that feel so overwhelming and\nscary to me like they actually are\noverwhelming and scary in the world\nbecause i just watched them come out of\nmy body and actually go into my parents\nbody and change a decision like\nthat's really terrifying for a kid so\nlike those family jobs i think are\nalways so grounding and that idea of\nparenting at times is about allowing\nmyself to make a decision not just from\npouring myself out and caregiving\npart\nit it's so important for the whole\nfamily system\nyeah i think you're really speaking to\nyou know having\nwhen i look back at my own you know past\nhistory of not having that separation of\nseeing and having that internalized\nbelief that if i had worry or stress or\nupset in my life really seeing how that\nimpacted for me my mom don't worry me or\nshe would become just as scared\nalongside of me for the impact whatever\nexperience i was have was having on me\nyou know and without that separation i\nvery much internalize that idea even to\nthis day there's many moments where i\nstruggle making choices or decisions to\ncare for myself and for my needs or\nexpress my feelings because i play that\ntape out oh\nthis is going to impact this person and\nprobably in a way that's not really\npositive and you know very much trailing\nit back to\nhaving that domino-like experience and\nimagining them from\na child-like perspective of how even\nmore scary that must have been because\nacknowledging that scare emotions for\nchildren are big they are overwhelming\nwe do need that stable secure caregiver\nto literally at times help our body\nfeel safe enough to even be in it while\nthose feelings are happening and then\nwhen you do see a parent or experience\nthem fleeing or diminishing or reacting\nto how you're feeling you do get that\nlack of of separation and you actually\nwrite something really beautiful in the\nway you define confidence and i think\nthis kind of wraps up into this\nconversation of feeling and you say\nconfidence is actually not about feeling\ngood at all i think a lot of times we do\nhave this idea that we put confidence in\nthis you know positive i'm exuding the\nself-assuredness around good feelings\nand so you go on to say confidence is\nnot about feeling good it's our ability\nto feel at home with ourselves in the\nwidest range of feelings possible and\nit's built from the belief that it's\nokay to be who you are no matter what\nyou're feeling and just kind of\nextending on this and we don't impact\nthe world as negatively as maybe we once\ndid that okayness i think is embodied in\nthat too that i can have a big\noverwhelming experience and my\nenvironment my relationship can contain\nit\nyes that's it that's it you know and and\ni remember i always remember i was in\nthis like really small seminar in\ncollege and there's this one girl who\nwas like she just was smarter than the\nrest of us you know like it's okay like\ni'm just she was like really everything\nshe said\nand there was a period where the the\ninstructor was like talking about\nsomething i honestly don't remember what\nit was and i remember internally just\nbeing like i actually have no idea about\nthis instructor i don't really\nunderstand this but i was like i'll\ncatch up later or something and i looked\naround the room i'll figure it out\nthis girl pulled up her hand\nand she's like i'm sorry like i i really\ncan't follow what you're saying i'm\nsuper confused like is there any way you\ncould just go back and say that a\ndifferent way\nand like\nif i think of one experience i have that\nto me like really epitomizes confidence\nit's like that moment like it wasn't\neven the smart stuff that girl said at\nother points in the seminar like she\ntrusted that she was confused\nlike she trusted\nthat she really was confused\nand in order to even say something you\nalso have to feel like i'm a good smart\nperson even when i am confused like i'm\nat home with myself in confusion and i\ntrust that feeling like that's what i\nwant\nfor my kids right like i want my kids to\ndo that in a seminar or to be in a\nsituation where someone's saying to them\nlike hey it's not a big deal come on do\nthis and they're like you know what my\nmy body's telling me it's a big deal so\nlike i trust that and no like that's\nconfidence and it doesn't get built when\nyou're 18 or 30 although we can build it\nthen 100 i just mean it doesn't have to\nstart then it's why when our kids are\nyounger like seeing what's going on\ninside them as real even if we don't\nunderstand it and i always think like\njust that those words like\nhey i don't even understand what you're\nupset about but like i believe you like\ni believe you you're a bot you are upset\nlike i see it\nand i believe you and i always say like\none of the things i try to say as much\nas i can to my kids is like you're the\nonly one in your body so you're the only\none who could ever know how you're\nfeeling or you're the only one who can\nknow what you want or what you like it\ndoesn't mean i give them\nthe 30 shows that they want to watch or\nwhatever it is but they know they want\nit they know they feel and i think\nreframing confidence in that way like i\nthink like what a gift if my kids go\ninto adulthood\nreally if the only thing they end up\nsaying to themselves is like i'm the\nonly one in my body i'm the only one who\ncan know like how i feel and what i want\nlike i don't care what they learn in\nhigh school or college like i feel like\nthey'll be ahead of the game i could not\nagree more i mean going back to what i\nbegan with right if i localize\nmy intuition right this internal\nguidance in my body then that means that\ni need to have that connection i need to\nbe able to hear\nyou know those pains of you know what\nthis doesn't actually feel safe or good\nfor me right now and then furthermore i\nhave to learn that i can trust\nthose pains that i have that space and i\nthink what you're beautifully describing\nis kind of that\nand um you bring up the concept of\nhaving an and when you talk about\nmultiplicity or allowing you know two\nrealities but we can even apply another\nand here right i can hold space for this\nbig overwhelming scary feeling my child\nis having and\ni can do so empathetically i can\nvalidate it i know you're having a\nreally big feeling right now and i'm\nstill my job is to have a boundary to\nkeep you safe i think that's a really\nbeautiful illustration of expanding and\nsaying all of this is true you're having\na big overwhelming feeling that makes\nyou feel like you want to hit or punch\nor you know do something off the wall\nthat and i can help you contain i can\nput us together if i have the resources\nto be safe for you in this moment or i\ncan rejoin you when i am in a safe space\nand and now i can allow the child to\nhave that confidence to have that\ninternal okay my feelings are big are\noverwhelming that's being validated\nthey're valid and real and alive for me\nright now and\nnow i'm given some options i'm being\nshown other ways that i can even over\ntime contain myself\nyes that that idea that and that i\nalways think like these two things as\ntrue\num it's like i feel like it's the answer\nto like all the questions in life it's\nlike okay like i can say in life for us\nadults too in a lot of ways like right\nit probably is because when we can't\nhold two things as true we do become so\nmyopic and like life feels really\noverwhelming when you're looking at the\nworld in that way right so\nlike yeah i won't let you hit\nor even i won't let you hit your sister\nyou can hit that pillow or i won't let\nyou hit and you're allowed to be mad\nreally mad huge man and one of my jobs\nis going to be to show you and help you\nexpress and feel anger in a way that\nstill feels safe because the other thing\nwe forget about kids when they're acting\nout in this way\nright\nit doesn't feel good to them\nto be hitting to be throwing like nobody\nfeels good when they're in a hurricane\nlike nobody and like i think if we're\nhonest with ourselves like when you're\nreally if you were like going around\nyour house destroying every room and\nthrowing things all over the place\nbecause you were just so disregulating\nlike it really is an act of love if\nsomeone near you takes you to a smaller\nroom and sits with you and just like i'm\nnot going to let you destroy the world\nlike you're not going to end like i will\ni will help you it's a form of help and\nyes that multiplicity like i'm stopping\nthe behavior i see the good kid i won't\nlet you do this you can do this or i\nthink a huge one is\nyes i'm making this decision and yes\nyou're allowed to have whatever reaction\nyou're allowed to you know you're gonna\nhave about it like that's a big two\nthings are true tv time is over and\nyou're allowed to be upset yeah you know\nlike and i think like doing it like this\nlike it really helps us visualize that\nboundary like my decision\nkid feelings and you can even watch for\nthe temptation to be like oh so upset i\nguess is it is it a big deal to watch\none more show and if you want to watch\none more show let your kid watch our\nshow be my guest but\nthat's should come from a place of your\ndecision making not your kids\nyou know overwhelming feelings and to\nwatch how those two things want to come\ntogether ooh that that my kid's sad\nfeelings is about to bleed into my\ndecision like oh like just like get that\nspace again like there are two different\nthings happening\nyeah yeah and i think you know to speak\nto what i imagine\nagain is very well intentioned parents\nwho might be trying to do the opposite i\ncan imagine all of you know us out there\nwho didn't have the present um\nphysically or emotionally present\ncaregivers who very much vow right from\nthat very early place to not do that to\ntheir child and to be you know there and\nand to tend to their child's needs i do\nthink sometimes something that very\ncomes from the parents own right paying\nchildhood very well intentionally can\nturn into what i would call it an\novercompensation or kind of a going to\nanother extreme again with a very\nwell intentioned thought in our minds\nbut in execution\nit kind of prevents that separation it\nprevents in these moments the ability to\nto stay you know in that boundary safe\neven contained way and it kind of just\nthrows you right in there maybe with\nyour child feeling just as overwhelmed\nin the scenario\nthat's exactly right and i think you\nknow i do i always come back to me like\nif i'm really overwhelmed and if i have\nmy partner next to me i want him to see\nthat i'm upset like if i'm super worked\nup i want him to like see that as real\nand to care about it\nbut if my feelings become like\ncontagious to him now like i've just\ndoubled my feelings like that wouldn't\nfeel good at all\nright and and i think there's some idea\nlike empathy is like that merger in some\nway like empathy is not a merger you\ncan't empathize with someone you've\nmerged with there's no one to empathize\nwith there's like just the poorestness\nhas just like come into each other so\nempathy requires the boundary like it\nreally requires even remind yourself\nwait my kid was left out of recess i was\nnot maybe i was in my past i got that's\nagain that self-worth my kid is really\nsad of course no one likes to see their\nkids sad that didn't happen to me\nlike that didn't happen to me my kid\nactually needs to see that i see that\npain yes\nand i need to not be in that pain\nexactly i need to walk beside her in it\nbut i don't need to take on that pain if\ni do\nit's like\nreally like the the pain deleting the\npain like\nyou know it it doesn't it doesn't help\nyour kid right so i think that's\nthat's so important because\nwe can be warm and caring and loving in\nfact to be warm and caring and loving\nyou actually have to have a boundary or\nelse if you take on your kids feelings\nas your own we're not even really\nparenting them now everything we do is\nreally in the service of just our own\nfeelings they kind of disappear anyway\ni was gonna say in a sense right what\ni'm hearing and the way my mind kind of\nunderstands and conceptualize\nconceptualizes in that moment now we've\nactually deleted our child it's about us\nin childhood being left out of recess i\nmean just to use you know write that\nexample it's kind of like okay now this\nisn't actually me even tending to your\nfeelings and i agree with you i think\nempathy has gotten confused as a concept\nand especially around this idea of being\na highly sensitive person or an attuned\nindividual which i believe all humans\nare we have energetic readers or\nconnections to all of the environment\naround us including other people and\nagain i think what is often being\ndescribed and labeled as highly\nsensitive or empathetic is that merger\nis that lack of boundaries that began\nagain in childhood that turned into this\nhyper-vigilant scanning and attuned\nnature again of self-protection but if\nwe really just want to objectively\nsimplify it in that moment now\nyour crisis your survival is your soul\nfor focus and your child\nin a sense in that moment isn't\npresent at all so true empathy isn't\nnecessarily there again but we are\nlabeling it as selfless as tending um to\nour child as is coming from that space\nso this i think goes into what you and i\nwere talking a bit about before i hit\nrecord which is really honoring right\nthe\nindividualized human\nbehind the parent\nright in this good good inside parenting\nwhich i believe is life-changing\ntransformational approach because i\nthink that's what we're all kind of just\nwhat this conversation is about is we\nhave a human that's the parent that came\nfrom all of these past layering\nconditioning experiences that in these\nmoments right sometimes even take us out\nof\nthe parenting role and right back into\nour own childhood wounding\nit really does that's that's exactly\nright that's why i think me and you\nconnect and why we're like wow our work\nis like so similar you know um like the\nlanguage and the examples are slightly\ndifferent right but\nyeah i mean as a parent\nof course we get triggered over and over\nby our kids right we go through there's\nlike widest range of experiences with\nthem and right our body kind of scams\nour own body and thinks about all the\nthings we've learned and that's what\nreally jumps up to respond first and so\ni don't know one parent who isn't\ntriggered like that like me included\nlike just to like put it out there like\ndon't think i do all the things that dr\nbecky says to do i do not don't hold me\nto that standard um and\nyou know that's that's also why though i\nthink being a parent like\nit can offer just so many amazing\nopportunities for like self growth and i\nthink you know people say sometimes in\nmy community and i always have an\ninteresting reaction like i'm here to do\nlike all the starting to be be a better\nparent to my kid and that's an amazingly\nnoble goal but i always say like\ni don't know i always feel like what's\nmissing is like okay can you be here to\nbe like i just feel like i deserve\nto feel like a more grounded sturdy\nperson like that's going to huge benefit\nmy kids and yeah i want to learn little\nstrategies and tips and scripts sure\nlike i'm here because i deserve to just\nlike feel better inside right and i\nthink\nlike that's been lost i don't know if it\nwas ever found but it was lost forever\nin motherhood like maybe like we're the\ngeneration who's reclaiming like when i\nbecome a mother i don't lose all the\nother parts of me and i don't just need\nto do things and change things just for\nmy kid probably the things i'm going to\ndo and change for myself are going to be\nthe things that go hand in hand that\nbenefit my kids so there's just like a\nnice synergy and efficiency there but\nlike i i just deserve that as a person\nright and i think that's so important to\nlike to reclaim that and to really\nredefine motherhood and parenthood with\nthat in mind\nand all this i think kind of goes\nbeautifully full circle right if those\nof us that are becoming aware of\nourselves and this self do we even have\none again speaking from my own\nexperience of not right you're like\nyou're saying this idea of selfless\nmodeling that's very much no boundaries\nis what i saw from every adult human in\nin my in my family so not having right\nthis separate this separate being the\nseparate self and really acknowledging\nhow few i'll go as far as to say that of\nus even in adulthood who\nhave that internal sense of goodness for\nus of being\nyou know a human who is worth whether\ndoing this for our role as a parent or\nmaybe our role in our relationships is\ngeneral or any choice that we make\ngesturing to ourselves i think really\ndoes activate\na pretty universal\nas far as i'm learning now having very\nmuch access to\nindividuals around the globe as i know\nyou do too i'm seeing that really core\nsimilarity that so few of us really feel\nworth it really feel worth of any\njourney you know in terms of self\ndefining itself self improvement\nwellness whatever it is that we want to\ncall it or forever the byproduct will be\nmy child my relationship whatever\nagain it is coming to the surface\nfor many different generational reasons\nyou know resource-based reasons that\nvery few of us to go as far to say have\nhad this sturdy type modeling and\nleadership and really do feel\nworth it so i think in and of itself\nthat's the first challenge\num is acknowledging\nthe self that we make we do feel less\nthan we do we do feel is unlovable and\nagain we can understand where it came\nfrom\nthough i think that is the reality that\na lot of us adults are living into\nokay i think you're exactly right and\nyou know one thing i want to make sure\nto get in here for\neveryone who's a parent and honestly i\nthink this is true for people who aren't\napparent and are in a relationship with\nsomeone with themselves\nis\nlike i think the single most important\nthing to get really good at as a parent\nis repair is repair\nand\nrepair is is like the best strategy\nbecause if you think about it if you're\nrepairing and if it's really important\nto get good at repair well if you're\ngetting good at repair you're still\nmessing up because you have nothing to\nprepare for if you didn't mess up it was\nlike a very like humanizing strategy and\na humanizing idea like you're gonna be\nmisattuned with your kid you're still\ngonna yell at your kid right and then\nrepair is just it's the most important\nthing and i think that what we always\nsay at good inside it's like number one\nis repairing with yourself like we\ncannot repair with a child or with a\npartner before we've repaired with\nourselves and repair doesn't have to\nmean that doesn't matter or i'm sorry\njust and i'm sorry\ni think repair is actually for yourself\nlike finding your goodness internally\nunder this thing you did like\nand i i always say like as a parent i\nwas like before you go to your kids room\nto say sorry for something like go into\na bathroom like put your hand on your\nheart\nand like remind yourself like i'm a good\nparent who is having a hard time i'm\nlike\nprobably if you say that to yourself\nover and over like especially connected\nto your body like\nyou will tear like something will happen\nin your body because it's probably a\ndeep message like we all needed to hear\nfor s for so long and then go to your\nkid like\nand i know me and unico both like think\nobviously about the body all the time\nlike when something happens with your\nkid that didn't feel good like you yell\nat your kid it lives in their body like\ntheir body can't forget it like it's\nstored there but that doesn't have to be\nawful like if that's part of a chapter\nin their life\nwhen you repair you like go back to that\nmoment in their body and like kind of\nopen up the file and now you can like\nend that file so differently like it's\nlike such an amazing opportunity you can\nalways do that a day later you could do\nthat years later like i'm sure me and\nyou nicole right if our parents called\nus now and we're like i have to tell you\ni've been thinking about this thing that\nhappened 30 years ago\ni that probably felt really bad for you\nthat was never your fault like i am so\nsorry and i'm open to hearing your\nexperience about it whatever they said\nlike that would that would still mean\nsomething like massive\nright and so repair like if a parent is\nwatching this like probably i think it's\ntrue in any relationship like take one\nthing\nlike find your kid at some point today\nor tomorrow and just say some version of\ni'm sorry for x or i've been thinking\nabout why\nit's never your fault when i yell or it\nwasn't your fault and i'm working on\nwhatever i'm working on you know\nmanaging my feelings too\nthat probably felt scary i'm working on\nit and i love you i think that\nthat repairs that reconnects it goes\nback to that building confidence and\nbuilding worth because you're showing\nyour kid like you don't have to\ninternalize that self-blame and like you\nare worthy of reconnection like it's\njust it's a huge bang for your buck\nstrategy yeah i love this and i really\nwant to commend you um for speaking as\nhonestly as you do of yourself and your\nown parenting because i even see you\nknow in my community when i share like\nyou're saying like oh dr nicole can say\nall of these things and in real time\ndoctor doesn't always do\nall of those things right so i think and\ni am always really struck\nby those moments where i'm sharing\nwhether it's you know in the circle or\non a podcast or what have you and i see\nthen messages and comments come in of\nhow healing it is even here right that\nreality that yeah you know these are\nideas concepts and in action it's hard\nto be human they i have those same\ntriggers i have those same moments of\nyou know losing my mind and acting in\nways that are very very shameful\nand\nright i'm human just like the rest of us\nand understanding and seeing you know\nthat you how much and readily you offer\nthat to the community and then\ntranslating that to these moments as\nwell right not having the fear as a\nparent to say you know what i did scream\nand yell at you you know child and it\ndoesn't doesn't mean anything about you\nthat's not any way that you know i\nshould have taken my feelings out and\nright here i am giving you that\nacknowledgement and i do think for many\ndifferent reasons um we haven't had that\nmodeled to us and those are the moments\nthat we're you know avoiding because of\nour own shame but those are the moments\nthat i think are so greatly impacted\nimpactful for for everyone around us\nthink about even applying that in our in\nour relationships with other adults um\nyou know going back to that moment and\nlike you're saying i i would know\nright if we a parent came and tried to\naddress something well into adulthood it\nwould alive in that as if it was right\nback there and talk about really\nchanging then your neurobiological\nrelationship um with that event and i'm\nreally happy you speak to this because i\ndo often hear you know people who are\nyou know older in life like having this\nfear of it's too late oh i've already my\nchildren are already adults themselves\ni'm watching them parent and you know\ni'm having all of these reactions to it\nand what i feel and think is so\ninspiring about your work is really\nunderstanding that it's never too late\nto understand ourselves and to create\nchange in our in our relationships\ni mean\nyes it's not too late it's like just\nsuch a core mantra\nyou know and it and it's it's not\n like it's just it's true like\nit's too late\nit's a common fear and i do think\nsometimes when parents worry about that\nwith their kids like i do feel like\nthere's something they're really fearing\nthat in themselves like is it too late\nfor me right like it's not too late for\nyour kid it is not too late for you or\nyes i feel like it's another two things\nare true our brain our body wires early\nand it's always open and i always feel\nlike eager like thirsty for that\nrewiring so like yeah it takes work it\ntakes some consistency it takes some\nlike really small but consistent steps\nand like we can do those things like\nespecially when we have support and you\nknow when we are surrounded by other\npeople who are cheerleading us in that\nor doing that alongside of us um it's\nreally really possible\nyeah absolutely and to speak to that\npoint i just want to highlight again um\nyour amazing new book good inside and\nreally you know not only did you\ndescribe so much of what we chatted\nabout today you know foundationally\nthe ins and outs of understanding these\ndifferent concepts in terms of parenting\nand attachment and repair and what's\ngoing on inside of us when we're having\nfeelings\ni really appreciate dr becky how you go\ninto\nactual objective right concerns like the\nchild who can't sleep being someone i\nremember many memories of childhood\nlaying in bed at night fearful bumps in\nthe night worried my mom wasn't gonna\nyou know wake up i was also the\npainfully shy child you devote a really\nincredible chapter of
