    "transcript": "do you know if you're dissociating\nthis video will cover what dissociation\nis\nthree common ways you might be\ndissociating and not even know it and\nthen of course as always we'll end by\nhow to break the habit or how to stop\ndissociating so what is dissociation\ndissociation is disconnecting from our\nthoughts from our feelings from our\nmemories from our sense of self from who\nwe are like i've described before if\nyou've listened to any of my previous\nvideos it can feel like living life on a\nspaceship or again completely\ndisconnected not grounded in yourself in\nyour body in your here and now\nthere are three common ways that you\nmight be dissociating and not even know\nit the first common way that we\ndissociate is by distorting or denying\nreality through repression projection or\nrationalization\nrepression is squashing or suppressing\nour thoughts and feelings to the point\nthat again we're disconnected from them\nprojection\nis by attributing how we think or feel\nto someone else a really common example\nif we're being controlling or selfish we\ntend to see other people around us and\naccuse them of being controlling or\nbeing selfish\nrationalization\nis when we deny the truth of how we're\nfeeling by trying to logic or\nrationalize it away\nfor example if you're waiting to hear to\ngo on a second date with someone and if\nthey never call\nyou might make sense of it by saying you\nknow what i didn't really even like that\nperson anyway\nagain avoiding the reality that maybe\nyou did maybe there was interest and\nmaybe you're hurt you rationalize it\naway by squashing it down\ndistancing yourself from how you really\nfeel\na second common way that many of us\ndissociate is by using substances or\nother compulsive behaviors to numb our\npainful reality\noften times when we're using or we're\naddicted to work or we're using a\nparticular substance we're keeping\nourselves distracted from what we really\nthink how we really feel what's really\ngoing on for us that's another type of\nthat disconnection or that dissociation\na third common way is when we find\nourselves trapped in cycles\nof emotional addiction or cycles of\nstress that produce that familiar\nfeeling inside of us\nwhether it's stress\nanger\nsadness for a lot of us that becomes our\nemotional home our body literally\nbecomes addicted to those chemicals the\ncortisol the adrenaline and the\nendorphins the more we're caught in\nthese cycles of anger of sadness of\nstress\nthe less attention we're paying to the\nother feelings that might be below the\nsurface\nso how do we begin to change\nfirst we need to observe all of the\ndifferent ways that we're dissociating\nin our lives\nso being present observing these cycles\nare you someone who does\nsuppress\nproject use substances or are you caught\nin your own cycles of feeling again\nignoring your deeper reality or simply\ndisconnecting from the truth of what is\ngoing on\ni'd love to hear from you in the\ncomments i know i struggle and continue\nto struggle with dissociation what are\nthe common ways that you're seeing that\nyou are still disconnected in your life"
