    "transcript": "how to connect with others\nevery month i pick a question from the\ncomments of previous videos for our\nvirtual q a\nthis month the question is\nhow do you connect with others\nletting them in without sharing too\nlittle or too much or over-sharing as we\nlike to say\nso how do you even connect with others\ni broke it down simplified it really\ninto two steps the first step of course\nis to\nknow yourself right we have to know who\nit is\nthat we are before we can be that person\nor connect that person to another\nindividual\nso this means developing self-awareness\nor simply\nknowing what it is that you think what\nit is that you want what it is that you\nfeel\nall of this means being embodied or in\nyour own person in your own space in\nyour own literal body\nsafety is so incredibly important in\nconnecting with yourself and knowing\nyourself\nall of us that are stuck in a\nfight-or-flight response\nlikely aren't connected to our bodies so\nwe might not know who we are who this\nself is to even present\nto another person\nso while i simplify this into step one\nand step two for most of us step one is\na journey and for a lot of us that\njourney begins with a foundation of\ncreating safety in our nervous system\nthrough breath work through grounding\nthrough consciousness building practices\nand then once we're safe in our body and\nwe are getting to know ourself\nthen we could take step two which is\nactually connecting with another person\nwhen we're talking about connecting with\nanother human we're not talking about it\nas a mental activity we're talking about\na felt sense\nof being known by another human\nwhich involves a practice of being\npresent with this other person\nin our full self\nand then sharing whatever it is that\nwe're comfortable sharing\nthere is no universal\nformula if you will for too much or too\nlittle what is that sweet spot because\nit's going to be different for all of us\nthose of us that are disconnected that\nmaybe don't feel safe in relationships\nmaybe because we have a history of\nabandonment\nthe amount we share\nwill probably be small amounts because\nsharing anything to someone else will\nprobably feel overwhelming\nso again spending time in step two\nlearning how to truly connect with\nanother being means being embodied in\nyour own self\nin your own truth\nand then sharing that with another\nperson in the space of a relationship\ni'd love to hear your comments on this\nvideo and any questions you might have\nfor next month's q a leave it in the\ncomments below"
