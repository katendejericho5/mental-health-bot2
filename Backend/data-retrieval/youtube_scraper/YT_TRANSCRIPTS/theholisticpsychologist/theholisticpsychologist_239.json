    "transcript": "are your parents parent\nthis video will explore what\nparentification is\nhow it affects us and then of course\nwe'll end by beginning to heal\nso what is parentification\nyou could think of parentification like\na role reversal that happens\nunconsciously and involves a child\nbecoming responsible to meet the needs\nof the parent oftentimes around\nemotional support where the child is\nconsistently relied on to care for or to\nprovide emotional support to their\nparent\nhow does it affect us\nparentification involves a dynamic that\nmodels or teaches us that love involves\nus\npushing down suppressing or ignoring our\nneeds in order to care for someone else\nand the more consistently this dynamic\noccurs the more we experience\ndifficulties or we might not even have\nboundaries at all meaning we don't have\nlimits we continue to push ourselves\nbeyond what is reasonably possible for\nus again all in service of someone else\nand of their needs\na lot of times it shifts into the habit\nthat we commonly know as people pleasing\nwhere we're showing up for the world\naround us again minimizing denying\navoiding ignoring our own needs\nit can also result in a difficulty\nidentifying or expressing our emotions\nand then again as a result we can't\ntolerate stress we don't have any\nability to cope and sometimes we end up\nrelying on dysfunctional coping habits\nlike numbing like substance use always\nagain as our best attempt to deal with\nor to regulate our overwhelming emotions\nso how can we begin to heal\nwe first have to make a small daily\npromise to ourselves to begin to meet\nour needs which for a lot of us means\npracticing first identifying\nwhat it is that we might need in a given\nmoment without having had a parent to\nmodel us that we need to teach ourselves\nhow to be that parent for ourselves\nso what does this actually look like\nthis might look like pausing to ask\nyourself\nwhat do i need right now\nand practicing compassion if you don't\nyet know the answer if you're not having\na habit of asking yourself this question\nchances are you're going to need to\nexplore\nwhat it is you could need\nit also looks like practicing limits\nif you don't have boundaries or if\nyou've overstepped them to show up in\nservice of others healing means creating\nnew limits for yourself by saying no\nwhen no is what you mean\nthis for a lot of us is a lifelong\npattern that started in childhood\nso practicing compassion along the way\nas we hit pause to begin to ask\nourselves what it is we need is how we\ncan begin this journey i'd love to hear\nfrom you listening have you experienced\nparentification in childhood and if so\nwhat was that like how is it for you now\nand sharing a little bit about your\njourney to change i'd love to hear from\nyou in the comments below"
