    "transcript": "for this month's virtual q a we're going\nto talk about your emotional body\nthe question that came in in the\ncomments section is\ncan you give examples of what core\nemotions are\nand how they show up in our bodies\nso to get started let's first understand\nwhat emotions are\nemotions are actually evolutionary\nsignals that communicate messages to us\nand to those around us about how we're\nexperiencing our current moment\nand there are actually six core emotions\nand these really map on to different\npieces of information we're going to go\nthrough them in a second they map onto\nactually two pieces of information they\nmap onto sensations in our body so how\ndo we know that we might be experiencing\nor getting one of these different\nmessages so we're going to talk a bit\nabout the different sensations for each\ncore emotion and then what that emotion\nmight be communicating or what those\nsensations might be communicating\nso for anger\ndifferent ways anger might show up and\ni'm saying this again intentionally\nbecause anger does look different for\neach of us so i really want to suggest\nto all of you listening to explore for\nyourself how do each of these feel in\nyour bodies you might notice slight\ndifferences then of course what this\nchart presents um anger often however\nright it shows up as tension it might\nshow up as heat in different areas of\nour body a lot of times in our face or\nour upper body we feel an actual heat we\nmight even turn red a lot of times we\ntense too tense our jaw we might even\ntense our shoulders\nso what message might be these\nsensations of anger signaling to us\noften\nanger signals that we've had a boundary\nviolation or that we're having an active\nneed that might not being met in that\nmoment so what do we feel we might feel\nangry or violated\nall right so sadness\nhow might sadness feel in our bodies\nsadness we might feel a shift in our\nenergy our energy might feel low it\nmight feel heavy maybe we even feel\ndroopy our whole body might kind of turn\nforward hunched shoulders we might find\nit hard to smile\nsmiling might not even be a thought in\nour mind\nwhat message might sadness be sending us\nusually sadness is activated around a\nloss or an imagined loss or a perceived\nloss or a feared loss of anything a\nperson an item an experience\nwhenever we experience a loss usually\nwe'll have those sensations of sadness\nhappening in our bodies\nso what about fear\nfear often increases our heart rate\nagain increases our tension in our\nbodies we might feel that similar\nclenching\nour breath might quicken as well it's\nkind of an elevation in all of our\nsystems in our body\nso what message might fear be\ncommunicating\nusually fear is communicating a\nperceived threat to our safety\nit might not be real\nit could be imagined but anytime we are\nfearful or we think our safety might be\naffected or we might become unsafe we're\nusually going to see those sensations\nshow up in our bodies\nso what about joy or happiness\na lot of times that maps onto lighter\nsensations in our body a lighter energy\nwe might feel even more alive energy\nzipping through us\nand of course we might wear it on our\nface we might naturally have a smile or\nwe might find it easier to smile\nwhat messages are joy or happiness\ncommunicating to us\nusually of interest of pleasure of\nexpansiveness\nit's a signal that what we're\nexperiencing feels good in some way or\nanother\nhow about disgust\ndisgust\nis\nusually we can locate that in our\nstomach discuss is literally when we\nfeel revolted by something and\noftentimes it's it's a sensation we\nthink of it when we eat something that\ndoesn't taste good that feeling um but\nof course we could be disgusted in\ndifferent ways it could be disgusted by\nactions\nwe might feel like gagging our nose\nmight wrinkle again a lot of times we\nassociate it with our stomach feeling\nupset\nso why might what might disgust be\ncommunicating why might we have those\nsensations\nusually discussed is signaling that we\nhave an aversion to something there's\nsomething that's coming up that we don't\nlike there's a displeasure there the\ntaste might not resonate the experience\nmight not resonate it's sending us a\nsignal that whatever experiencing we're\nhaving in that moment we're having an\naversion to it it's not resonating with\nus\nso how about surprise\ndifferent ways surprise might show up in\nour body\nour energy might begin to increase\nsimilar to fear our heart rate might\npick up our jaw our eyes we might be\nwide open when we're surprised by\nsomething simply we it's an unexpected\nevent or a violation of expectation\nwe're not expecting something to happen\nso it simply surprises us and a lot of\ntimes that looks like wide-eyed we're\ntaking in whatever that unmet\nexpectation is or that surprise event\nthe more attuned we can be to our bodies\nthe more we can connect ourselves with\nthe different messages that these\nemotions are sending\nand again all of these have evolutionary\nimportance right understanding things\nthat might be offensive\nthings that might threaten my safety\nways my needs aren't met all of these\nsignals can help me move into the\ndirection of finding safety of\nidentifying and meeting my needs and of\nfinding experiences that don't cause\nthat aversion or that resonate with me\nso how do we do the work how do we begin\nto explore and identify these different\nsignals we first reconnect with our\nbodies we get attuned to the different\nshifts and sensations begin to pay\nattention to your breath your heart rate\nyour musculature tension those are great\nplaces to start tuning in\ntuning into the different sensations and\nthe different changes that happen so\nthat you can begin to see the different\nmessages that your body might be sending\nyou\ni'd love to hear from you in the\ncomments as you're beginning to explore\nthese different core emotions in your\nbody and these different messages that\nthese core emotions are sending\nwhat is coming up for you do you notice\na particular emotion that your body\ntends to feel a particular message that\nyour body might be wanting you to hear\nfrom your experiences of your\nenvironment i'd love to hear from you in\nthe comments below"
