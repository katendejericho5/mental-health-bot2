    "transcript": "do you tell yourself stories\nthis video will explore mental stories\nwhat they are\nwhy we use them and how to get out of\nthe habit of allowing them to impact\nyour daily choices\nyour brain is a natural storyteller it\nassigns meaning to all the events all of\nthe experiences you have in order to\nmake sense of them\nit assigns these meanings quickly\nso that we can understand how we're\nexperiencing that current moment we are\nnamely concerned about our safety the\nquicker we can make that judgment the\nquicker then we can be on our way if\nthere's a threat in that moment\nso here's an example of a mental story\nsay you shoot a text to your friend your\npartner or your loved one and you don't\nhear a response back\nyou might start to witness your mind\ncreating a meaning of their lack of\nresponse\nyou might hear things in your thoughts\nlike they don't care about my feelings\nthey're not considering me right now\nthey're doing something else that's much\nmore important than me\nor\nthey're not responding to me to upset me\nor to hurt my feelings\nall of those are examples of mental\nstories or meanings what actually\nhappened was there was a lack of\nresponse\nyour brain then will begin to create a\nstory as to why\nunfortunately\nmost of our mental stories are based in\nour past experiences we tend to be very\nrepetitive revisiting the same stories\naround the same type of event\nso how do we begin to decrease the\nimpact that these stories have on our\nchoices\nthe first step of course is to become\nconscious to begin to witness the\nstories that your mind revisits on\nrepeat i assure you there will be some\nthemes there\nlearning how to view your thoughts in\nthis way will help you understand the\nimpact that these stories have on your\nchoices\nonce you have space to begin to see your\nstory you can then make some more\nempowered choices the first choice might\nbe asking for objective feedback or\nclarity\nasking that friend or that partner if\nthey really are not responding to you\nbecause they're upset with you\nallowing someone else a loved one some\nobjective support some feedback to be\nyour opportunity to then reframe\nthat story for yourself\ntaking step two right taking a moment to\ncome up with all of the other reasons\nwhy someone might not be responding to\nyour text\nthat then allows you\nto choose a new response if you can\nreframe what's happening to this person\nmight not be near their phone in this\nmoment you might not be inclined to\nshoot that mean text back or to then\nignore them when they respond to you\nthe more we witness our stories the more\nwe then give ourselves the opportunity\nto clarify or to reframe on our own\nwhat's actually objectively happening\nopening up a pathway for responses that\nare more aligned with what we want what\nour heart is saying authentically with\nhow we want to be in those moments this\nof course is a process and is a journey\nand i'd love to hear from all of you\nlistening what are your mental stories i\nknow one of my most visited mental story\nis i am not considered taking moments\nwhen i see that story to give myself an\nopportunity to come up with other\nreasons why something may or may not be\nhappening has empowered me to make\nchoices that are more aligned with my\nauthentic self i'd love to hear from you\nlistening what's your story and how are\nyou navigating changing that story"
