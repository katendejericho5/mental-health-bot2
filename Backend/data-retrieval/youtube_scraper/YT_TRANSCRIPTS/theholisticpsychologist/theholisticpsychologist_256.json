    "transcript": "are you connected to your intuition\nthis video will explore what intuition\nis\nthe reasons why so many of us are\ndisconnected and of course will end with\nways to begin to reconnect\nso what is intuition\nintuition is a sense of knowing it's a\nperception that comes from an internal\nspace not our thoughts at all it's based\non information or sensations that we're\ntaking in from the environment around us\na lot of people refer to it as our\nguidance or our inner knowing our\ncompass if you will\nit's the ping we get when we know we're\nwalking in a direction that's meant for\nus and it's the feeling of\nconstriction or alarm when we know that\nmaybe we shouldn't turn down that corner\nfor whatever reason\nso many of us aren't connected to our\nintuition at all\nour intuition is based foundationally in\na connection with our body and with its\nsensations\na lot of us have a habit of spending\nlittle to no time\nreceiving those messages at all because\nwe're not connected to our bodies at all\nwe don't know when we're having a\nsensation maybe we're lost in thought\nliving in our mind revisiting the past\nor worrying about a future\na lot of the times we do this\nbecause of our past experiences when\nthings overwhelmed us or were\ntraumatizing\noften the safest place is not in our\nbody\na lot of us create stories in our mind\nthat go along with those early\noverwhelming or traumatic experiences\nand then ways of being in the world the\nthings that we do to cope that aren't\nreally aligned with ourself with our\ninner needs with our body even at all\nthe more we're in a state of nervous\nsystem dysregulation in particular\nthe more our body is receiving signals\nthat aren't coming from that intuitive\nspace\nyou can revisit a previous youtube video\ncalled how our nervous system affects us\nthat will give you some of the signs\nthat your body might actually be\nresponding to a dysregulated nervous\nsystem and not your intuition at all\nif you resonate with that video you can\nfollow that up with a video called how\nto take care of your nervous system\nit's only when we create balance or\nregulation in our nervous system can we\nbegin to untangle what's coming from\ntrauma and that nervous system\ndysregulation and what sensations are\nactually coming from that intuitive\nspace\nso how do we do the work to reconnect\nwith our intuition\nwe first reconnect with our body\nagain if you are living in a body with a\ndysregulated nervous system we begin to\npractice calm in our bodies so that the\nsignals that we're hearing become\nclearer and we can begin to understand\nwhich signals are maybe coming from the\nstories in our mind or the threats in\nour environment and which are coming\nfrom that deep intuitive space\nwe can only reconnect with our intuition\nwhen we're reconnected with ourself when\nwe're living in presence of ourself and\nour bodies only then can we hear those\ninternal pings or that inner sense of\nknowing\ni know for me my journey back into my\nintuition was just that it was a journey\ni'd love to hear from you listening how\nis your journey going in reconnecting\nwith your intuition or in using your\nintuition as guidance in your life i'd\nlove to hear from you in the comments\nbelow"
