    "transcript": "this video is on reconnecting with\nsilence\nfirst we'll talk about what silence is\nand why it's important\nthen we'll explore reasons why so many\nof us are disconnected from silence in\nour lives and of course as always we'll\nend with ways to begin to reconnect with\nsilence\nsilence is an absence of sound a\nstillness\nin that space it can be thought of as a\npure presence when i'm fully connected\nor available to connect with whatever is\nhappening internally or externally i'm\nnot distracted by the internal noise in\nmy mind or whatever's happening in the\nworld around me\nthe ability to be silent with yourself\nallows you to be fully connected to\nyourself\nto your body and its wants and its needs\nto that deepest place of knowing or\nintuition\ni did a video called are you connected\nto your intuition you might find helpful\nto get some clarity on what intuition is\nand again why we're disconnected and how\nto begin to reconnect\nbeing silent with others\nallows us to be in that state of pure\npresence which is where authentic and\ndeep connections are possible when we're\nnot distracted by the thoughts in our\nhead or how we want to respond to what\nsomeone is saying or distracted by the\nworld around us we can open ourselves up\nfor true connection deep connection with\nanother human being\nsilence is incredibly important and has\nbeen heavily heavily researched\nit's been found to lower blood pressure\nto improve concentration and focus\nto calm racing thoughts\nto stimulate brain growth\nto reduce cortisol the stress hormone\nto\nincrease creativity or even allow you to\nbecome creative or to enter that space\nit helps you improve sleep\nand creates conscious awareness the\nability like we were saying to be\nactually present and receptive to what's\nhappening inside us\nand outside of us not distracted by the\nnoise of it all\nso many of us spent so little time in\nsilence\nvery few of us were modeled or taught\nhow to be in silence when we were\nyounger\nwe might always have been barred by a\ndistraction we might never have seen our\nparents or other caregivers sitting in\nsilence or being silent themselves we\nmight avoid silence due to past trauma\nor overwhelming feelings that resulted\nin a\ndisregulated nervous system\nwhen we're caught in a constant loop of\nfight or flight we actually can't find\nsafety in the present moment we can't\nfind safety in silence and we might\navoid it endlessly distracted by our\nthinking mind or if you're like me\nkeeping ourselves endlessly busy always\ndoing never even having a moment to\nbreathe or a moment for silence\nsome of us\nmight associate silence with abandonment\nor loss\nespecially those of us who received the\nsilent treatment in childhood\ni know for me when my mother was mad\noften times she would become silent she\nwould withdraw she wouldn't speak to me\nat all\nthose of us who have those consistent\nexperiences\nmight begin to associate silence\nwith a death of sorts or an abandonment\nso i know for me flash forward in time\ndecades even i avoided silence for that\nreason when partners of mine became\nsilent i would automatically assume that\nthere was an upset or that i did\nsomething wrong\nbecause i paired that association\nsilence meant loss of love or met\nabandonment\nwe compare the experience of silence or\nassociate it with many different\nnegative experiences that very\nunderstandably then we want to avoid\nassuming of course that we continue to\nassociate silence with that into\nadulthood\nso how do we stop how do we begin to\nreconnect with silence in our life\nwe become conscious of our current\nrelationship with silence are you\nsomeone like me who avoids it at all\ncost prefers to be endlessly distracted\non our phones or maybe endlessly\ndistract it with the thoughts in our\nmind\nif you find little to no silence in your\nlife here's an opportunity to begin to\nmake a conscious choice to create small\nmoments of silence in your day\nunderstanding that if you're like me\nit might be uncomfortable it will be\nuncomfortable\nthough building silent moments into your\nday gives you then the opportunity to\nfully become connected with yourself and\nwith others in the world around you\ni'd love to hear from you listening what\nis your current relationship with\nsilence and what steps have you been\ntaking to reconnect with silence in your\nlives drop it in the comments below"
