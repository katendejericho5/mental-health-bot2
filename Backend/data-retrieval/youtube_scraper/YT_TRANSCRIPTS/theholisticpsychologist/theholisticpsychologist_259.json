    "transcript": "this video will explore how to cope with\nstress\nwe'll first talk about stress and the\nvagus nerve\nthen we'll explore what stress\nresilience really is\nand of course ways to begin to build\nthat resilience\nthe vagus nerve is the main nerve that\nconnects our brain to all of the major\norgans in our body\nit helps control our breath\nour heart rate and even our digestion\nwhen the vagus nerve is activated or not\nit shifts us either into our sympathetic\nresponse otherwise known as fight or\nflight and this happens any time we\nperceive a threat in our environment\nwhen we activate our vagus nerve it\nactually downshifts us from the\nsympathetic fight or flight response\ninto what is known as the\nparasympathetic response otherwise known\nas rest or digest and it allows our body\nto do just that\nto repair to be peaceful to even sleep\nand rest\nstress resilience is our body's ability\nto cope with stress it's actually not an\nabsence of stress at all it's our\nability to shift into that sympathetic\nresponse and then downshift back into\nthat parasympathetic mode and it's\naffected by our vagus nerve stress\nresilience is actually our body's\nability to cope with stress and it's\naffected by what is known as the tone of\nour vagus nerve or really simply the\nability to go from fight or flight or\nthat stressed out response back into\nthat parasympathetic mode of calm\nour stress resilience is impacted by not\nonly our genes but our environment\nbeginning in utero so even before birth\nit's impacted by our mother's ability to\ndeal with stress by the stress hormones\nthat are present in her body and by her\nbody's ability to fall back into that\ncalm state of rest and digest\nonce we're born our ability to cope with\nstress also has to do with our parent\nfigures attunement to us when we are in\nthat fight or flight mode in childhood\nin infancy we need another human body\nnervous system in particular to help our\nbody our nervous system regulate to help\nus go from fight or flight back into\nthat parasympathetic calm\nthose of us who didn't have attuned\nparent figures around us\nmight never have had that flexibility\nmight never have come back into that\npeaceful calm state might not as a\nresult have very much stress resilience\nat all\nhow do we begin then to rebuild stress\nresilience\nwe do so by actually causing stress to\nour body so that our body goes into that\nfight-or-flight mode and then activating\nthat vagus nerve allowing our body then\nthrough conscious choice to come back\ninto that calm\nstress resilience is built the more\ntimes we experience a little bit of\nstress not overwhelming stress of course\na little tolerable amount and then we\nbring our body safely back into that\nparasympathetic mode by activating our\nvagus nerve\nthere are actually exercises that you\ncan engage in daily to help stress your\nbody and then create calm\none of the best ways to do that is\nthrough the power of our breath\nanytime you naturally feel your body\nbecoming stressed your heart rate\nelevating your breath becoming shallow\nyou can redirect your breath down to\nyour belly putting a hand on your belly\nand feeling it inflate\nactivates your vagus nerve bringing your\nbody from stress back into calm\nyou can also activate your vagus nerve\nnot you can also activate your vagus\nnerve through breath by elongating your\nexhalation which simply means if you're\nbreathing in for one second\nbreathe out for two\nor in for three\nout for six\nthe longer and slower the exhalation the\nmore you're activating that vagus nerve\nso again going from stress into calm and\ncreating that resilience\nanother way to build stress resilience\nis through activity or exercises like\nyoga\nyoga is so powerful because a lot of the\nposes actually stress your body i know\nwhen i'm doing yoga and i'm in a\nparticular pose i feel my heart rate\nbegin to increase\ndoing a stressful pose followed by a\ncalming pose will activate your vagus\nnerve in the same way stressing your\nbody and then bringing it back to calm\nanother way to build stress resilience\nthough for a lot of us it's a way that\nis very uncomfortable is through cold\ntherapy\nif you live outside in a cold climate\ngoing outside and allowing your body to\nbecome stressed by the cold or turning\nyour shower to cold\nthat too will stress your body\nactivating your sympathetic or your\nfight-or-flight response i know for me\nmy heart rate begins to increase in\nthose moments\nusing that long deep exhalation of the\nbelly breath will help then bring your\nbody back in too calm\nstress resilience is built when we\nactually stress our body out each time\nwe do that we're building that ability\nto cope with the daily stressors in our\nlife\ni'd love to hear from you listening have\nyou experimented with any of these\nactivities to bring that stress to your\nbody and to help you cultivate that much\nneeded resilience to deal with the\nstresses of the daily world\nleave your experiences and or any\nquestions in the comments below"
