    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about what it's\nlike to be the Peacekeeper in every\nfamily people play roles and most of\nthese roles are unconscious meaning we\ndon't even realize we're playing them we\nadopt these roles when we're really\nyoung and most of us end up repeating\nthese roles into our relationships well\ninto our adulthood so the Peacekeeper is\nthe member of the family who does two\nmain things the first thing is they're\neasy they have very few needs\nand they rarely ask others for help the\nsecond thing is they find themselves\nregularly navigating issues between\nothers usually other family members so\nmaybe you're the person that one of your\nparents calls to vent about the other\nparent or maybe you're the one who's\ncalled to fix issues when there's fights\nbetween\nsiblings so how does this role begin\nusually the Peacekeeper is raised in an\nenvironment that's unpredictable in some\nway so maybe you were raised in a home\nwhere your parents were always stressed\nout in a tense marriage and you often\nfound yourself in the middle of their\narguments or maybe with parents who are\nreally shut down and cold so you end up\nlearning to repress all of your own\nneeds some common things that you might\nhave heard growing up if you were the\nPeacekeeper maybe you heard you're so\nmature for your age usually this is\nbecause you had to act like an adult at\na really young age\ngiving others the impression that you\nwere much older than you actually were\nmaybe you heard you know I never had to\nworry about you this is especially\ncommon if you had other siblings who\nwere either highly sensitive or who\nrequired a lot of care themselves you\ndidn't show many outward signs of\nneeding anyone or anything giving others\nthe sense that you could care for\nyourself and giving you the sense that\nyou raised yourself or that you spent a\nlot of time alone or maybe you heard\ngrowing up you're such an overachiever\nor all of your achievements were\ncelebrated this is because a lot of us\nlearn to channel our anxious energy or\nour feelings of low selfworth into\nachievement we end up doing really well\nin school and then ultimately our\ncareers trying to seek that external\nsource of validation but usually\ninternally having a sense of emptiness\nor of\nloneliness it is really common for\nsomeone who is the Peacekeeper to look\nlike they have everything together\ngrowing up my family always referred to\nme as oh nothing bothers Nicole when in\nreality I had a ton of anxiety and\noverwhelming feelings and I ended up\ndissociating but to everyone else I\nlooked like I had it all together and\nlike I was doing well even a core trait\nof someone who is a peacemaker is we\ndon't end up having a lot of outward\nemotion a lot of the time we're\ninternalizing our feelings or we mask\nthem very well so if you notice yourself\nin these roles here are some things you\ncan do to begin to break this pattern\nthe first thing you can do is become\naware of your own needs The Peacemaker\nis really out of touch with their own\nneeds because they've been putting\neveryone else's needs first so you're\ngoing to want to begin to pause to check\nin with yourself by simply asking what\nam I needing\nit can be something as simple as maybe\njust needing to take a break to regroup\nto decompress for 10 15 minutes instead\nof maybe answering that phone call from\nthe friend who you know needs to vent\nwhen we start making this shift from\nfocusing on what's happening outside of\nus to what's happening inside of us we\ncan become better aware of our own\nneeds the second step is you want to\nbegin to ask for help now this can be\nvery uncomfortable for a peacemaker\nbecause we're used to relying on a sense\nof being independent of doing it all a\nlot of us even Pride oursel on that\nsense of Independence so we're going to\nwant to practice reaching out to people\nthat we trust and asking for help when\nwe need it now this can be asking for a\nfriend to listen after you had a bad day\nbecause you just want someone to be\nthere for you or asking for a small\nfavor when you're over overwhelmed\nasking for your friend to pick up\nsomething for you on the way home from\nwork letting people help us when we\nactually need it creates strong and\nhealthy\nrelationships the Peacekeeper is usually\nthe glue of the family the one that\nholds everything together so it is so\nimportant to begin to receive the help\nand the support that we need too and the\nthird thing that you're going to want to\ndo is practice saying no now of course\nthis can be the most difficult because\nwe don't want to say no we're quite\nliterally conditioned to be the person\nthat's helping that's fixing or that's\nadjusting Our Lives to accommodate those\nthat we care about so you're going to\nwant to practice saying no and letting\npeople know when you're not available\nwhich of course will feel unnatural at\nfirst and maybe even like you're doing\nsomething wrong but so much healing can\nhappen when we're finally able to honor\nand respect our own limits now I know\nthese things probably sound really\nsimple and they're definitely not easy\nremember to take these steps slowly\nconsistently and to really acknowledge\nyourself as you begin to do this\nlifechanging work I'd love to hear from\nall of you peacekeepers in the comments\nshare your journey below"
