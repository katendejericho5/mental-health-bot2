    "transcript": "is it your mind or your body keeping you\nstuck\nthis video will first explore your\nbody's role in creating mental wellness\nthen we'll dive into the mind's role in\ncreating mental wellness and of course\nas always we'll end with tips on how to\ncreate overall mind-body wellness\nthe first thing to understand is that\nour mind and our body are in constant\ncommunication and that communication\ngoes both ways\nour mind communicates with our body just\nas much as our body communicates with\nour mind\nwhat is our body saying\nour body is sending signals to our mind\nletting know how it's doing in our\ncurrent environment specifically whether\nit's safe\nor unsafe\nour body does that first by taking in\ninformation from the environment from\nour senses\nour body also sends information based on\nchanges in its internal world or changes\nin sensations changes in our heart rate\nit quickening or it's slowing maybe even\nchanges in our breath\nall of these signals are then sent up to\nour mind and our mind uses them to\ninterpret to try to make sense of what\nis happening around me and again am i\nsafe or not\nour mind likes to assign meaning to the\nevents in the world around us it also\nlikes to make predictions meaning it\nuses things that have happened in our\npast to predict or anticipate that those\nsame things will continue to happen into\nour future we become stuck for this\nreason\nwhen our body is stuck in responses in\nan over-activated nervous system\nassigning meanings that we are unsafe we\ncontinue to predict that things will\ncontinue to make us feel unsafe\nin that way we remain stuck\nif we don't shift how our body is\nfeeling we can't shift the signals that\nit's sending to our mind and then of\ncourse our mind is going to keep\nassigning the same meanings continue to\npredict the same events and we're going\nto remain\nstuck in how we feel\nhow do we begin to do the work the work\nbegins when we first just become aware\nthat our mind and our body are both\ninvolved in this process it's not enough\nto just think your way or have a\npositive thought and create change we\nhave to invite our body into the story\nunderstanding that our body is playing a\nrole\nin the signals it's sending to our mind\nthat are then keeping us stuck\nreliving the same emotions reliving the\nsame patterns and often making the same\nchoices\nfor a lot of us this is incredibly new\ninformation some of us really believe we\nwere separate that our minds were\nsomehow separate from our bodies i'd\nlove to hear from all of you what is\nyour reaction to hearing this\ninterconnectedness between our mind and\nour body this incredibly powerful\ninformation that can be used to empower\nactual change"
