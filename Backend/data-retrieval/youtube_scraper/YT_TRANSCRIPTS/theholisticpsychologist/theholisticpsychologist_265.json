    "transcript": "do you have unrealistic relationship\nexpectations\nmost of us do this video is going to\nexplore very common ones many of us hold\none of the most common relationship\nexpectations is the belief that others\nshould meet all\nof my needs\nin childhood where many of these beliefs\nor expectations were formed that of\ncourse was the case we were completely\ndependent on our caregivers to meet all\nof our needs\nas we grow and as we mature it becomes\nour responsibility to identify and to\nmeet our needs quite honestly no one\nelse can meet all of our needs at any\ngiven time it is really on us when we\nhold our partners up to that expectation\nto meet all of our needs all of the time\nwe really create a lot of conflict and\nsuffering in our relationships\nanother common relationship expectation\nis this what i call mind reading or this\nidea that others even can\nknow what's in our head know what our\nneeds are anticipate and then meet them\nwithout us even speaking any words to\nthem at all\na lot of this is based in childhood\nwhere we didn't have verbal\ncommunication where it was the job of\nour caregivers to show up to have that\nlevel of attunement to be able to figure\nout what it is that was wrong with us\nwhen we were crying were we tired were\nwe hungry were we uncomfortable and did\nwe need a change there was a sort of\nmind reading that caregivers needed to\ndo because we couldn't communicate\nas we age no one can be in our heads\nexcept ourselves to hold others up to\nthe idea or the expectation that they\ncan be\nagain creates conflict and suffering in\nmany of our relationships\nanother common expectation i hear often\na lot of times this is a belief passed\non from our families from our culture\nmaybe from media it's this idea that\nothers or relationships in general their\njob is to complete us\nas if i'm not whole on my own\nwe are all whole and complete on our own\nrelationships add things to our life\nthey're an enhancement they're an extra\nof course we all need them though we are\ncomplete and we are whole on our own\nespecially when we're not in\nrelationships\nanother really common expectation\nsurrounds this idea around conflict\nwith many of us avoiding it thinking\nthat any indication of conflict means\nthat the relationship isn't working\nor means that the relationship isn't\nworking or should be avoided at all cost\nconflict is a natural part of being in a\nrelationship of being human we are all\ndifferent people we're not always going\nto agree\nso many of us run from conflict we fear\nit we don't feel we have the tools to\nnavigate it again based on things that\nhappened maybe around anger in childhood\nmaybe we never saw conflict being\nresolved in our home or conflict just\nlooks like scary screaming and yelling\nof course she would then want to avoid\nit and of course she would then believe\nthat maybe it is a bad thing and it does\nmean that the relationship isn't healthy\nor isn't for us\nagain i assure you\nconflict is completely normal it's not\nthe presence of conflict that's an issue\nof course it's how is conflict navigated\nright what do i choose to do when i'm in\nconflict\nanother expectation is this idea around\nattraction or around connection\na lot of us have this belief that being\nattracted or connected to others\nagain is problematic means the\nrelationship isn't working or should be\navoided we're all different humans we\nmight find other people attractive we\nmight be able to connect with different\npeople in different ways again just like\nwith conflict it's not necessarily the\npresence of attraction or of connection\nthat's a problem it's of course how is\nit handled\nyou and your partner of course can\ndetermine the boundaries that work for\nyou in terms of acting\non your attraction or on your connection\nhowever believing that being attracted\nto others is problematic or being\nconnected with others is problematic is\njust simply unrealistic it's part of the\nhuman experience it's part of connecting\nand being in relationship with people\nthat are different connections are just\nas unique as the people involved\nanother really really common\nrelationship expectation that causes\nmany\nof us suffering\nis this idea around boredom or the\nexperience of boredom a lot of us when\nwe don't feel really passionate or we\ndon't have that rollercoaster highs and\nlows that maybe come with the beginning\nof a relationship like the honeymoon\nperiod\na lot of us take that absence of that or\nmaybe the boredom just the monotony of\ndaily life with a person\nto mean that again the relationship\nisn't working or that it shouldn't be\navoided\nrelationships actually at their core\nare stable they provide a stability they\nprovide a security they're not\nunpredictable\nso many of us are used to those\nunpredictable highs and lows again\nbecause of our earliest relationships\nwhat we call those is trauma bonds we\nseek those we might leave a partner when\nwe begin to feel bored looking for that\nnext person who we can ride that same\nroller coaster with\nit's unrealistic to feel like you can\nmaintain those highs or those lows all\nof the time what we're really looking\nfor in our relationships is stability\nnot that roller coaster\nso how do we begin to do the work the\nwork begins first when we just witness\nwhich of these expectations might you be\nholding might you be bringing into your\nrelationship might you be putting on\nyour partner and might you be causing\nyourself conflict or suffering in your\nrelationship\ni'd love to hear from you what is your\nmost common unrealistic expectation that\nyou find present in most of your\nrelationships leave it in the comments\nbelow"
