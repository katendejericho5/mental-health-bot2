    "transcript": "are you living in a fairy tale\nthis video will explore the difference\nbetween what i call fairy tale love and\nauthentic love\nand will end by exploring ways to begin\nto cultivate authentic love in all of\nour relationships\nso what is the difference between what i\ncall fairy tale love and authentic love\nwhen we're living in fairy tale love we\noften expect others to just know what we\nthink what we feel what we need\nand then we expect them to go ahead and\nmeet our needs for us\nthis of course looks different than\nauthentic love\nin authentic love we understand\nthat i or another human is solely\nresponsible for understanding\nidentifying and meeting their own\nneeds\nin fairy tale love we believe it is\nanother's job to complete us to make us\nhappy to allow us to feel fulfilled to\ngive us a feeling\nin authentic love however we understand\nthat the only person that can make us\nfeel anything be it happy be it\ncompleted or whole be it fulfilled\nis our selves\nin fairy tale love\nwe hold others responsible when we're\nupset\nwhen they upset us we understandably\nwant or ask them even to change to stop\ndoing things that upset us or to start\ndoing things so that we may feel better\nin authentic love we understand that our\nreaction to anything that happens to us\nor around us\nis our\nresponsibility\nand we then take the time to understand\non a deeper level what might be\nhappening for us why we might be having\nthat reaction we don't hold others\nresponsible and we don't necessarily ask\nthem to change so that we can feel\ndifferently we first\nexplore that reaction within ourselves\nin fairy tale love\nwe believe that how emotionally close we\nfeel to someone is based solely in in\nthem how they are showing up to the\nrelationship\nthe emotional depth that they may or may\nnot be capable of\nand when we don't feel that we're\nemotionally connected to or understood\nor our relationship doesn't feel to have\nthe depth that we would like it to\nsome of us blame the other person maybe\neven look for another partner who has\nthe qualities that we believe we need\nemotionally\nin authentic love we understand that our\nability to be emotionally connected to\nanyone again begins with us\nbegins with how emotionally connected we\nare to ourselves\nhow attuned we are\nand how able we then are to\nauthentically present those emotions and\nthat self to another\nperson\nwe understand that when we're not\nfeeling emotionally connected to someone\nor the world around us we look to\nourselves to understand where the\ndisconnection might be\nin terms of us\nso how do we begin to do the work\nthe first step is to empower ourselves\nto identify which type of love we're\nfunctioning in now this doesn't just\ninclude romantic relationships this\ncould be in our friendships as well we\nhave expectations of our friends just as\nmuch as we have expectations of our\nromantic partners so begin to explore\nwhat is the type of love we typically\nseek in relationships and of course the\njourney is to create one new small daily\npromise\ntoward that authentic love in all of our\nrelationships"
