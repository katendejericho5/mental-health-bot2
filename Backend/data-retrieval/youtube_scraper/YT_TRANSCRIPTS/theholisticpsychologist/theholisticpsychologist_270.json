    "transcript": "what's causing your depression\nthis video will explore possible root\ncauses for depression and of course how\nto begin to heal\nto get started we have to understand a\nnew science a new science that shares\nthe wisdom that we are not our genetics\nfor a very long time we believed if you\ngenetically were passed the gene for\ndepression you had no choice\ninevitably you would get those symptoms\nyou would get that disorder\nwe now know that genetics absolutely\nplay a role however so does our\nenvironment or the choices that we're\nmaking day in and day out for more\ninformation you can visit my previous\nvideo you are not your genes\nso let's talk about how this applies to\ndepression\nso common causes of depression are\nactually trauma\nand nervous system dysregulation\nwhen we are overwhelmed our nervous\nsystem can go into a state that i simply\ncall shut down it's actually a state of\nparasympathetic activation when we have\nsymptoms that very much mirror the\nsymptoms of anxiety we can feel listless\nwe can feel like we have no energy at\nall no hope we can even feel numb to our\nemotions\nand again these symptoms stay with us\nthis this regulation lives in our\nnervous system well beyond the time or\nthe event of the trauma which means that\nsome of us\nmight be at living in that state of\nshutdown from an experience years\nearlier yet our body still is\ndysregulated causing the symptoms that\nwe end up calling depression\nthis is incredibly important if we can\nunderstand that it's our nervous system\nthat's causing these symptoms we can\nbegin to activate our nervous system in\na way that will help us resolve the\nsymptoms of depression\nother factors that might be contributing\nto our symptoms of depression are our\nlifestyle choices we're making daily\nwhat do we mean when we say lifestyle\nfirst we mean nutrition what are we\neating we now understand that our gut\nplays an incredibly important role in\nour not only our physical wellness but\nalso our mental and our emotional our\ngut is the first place where our body\ngets to absorb the nutrients from the\nfood that we eat\neven more problematically many of us are\neating food that causes damage to our\nvery thin gut lining\nand it pokes holes in it as a way to\nthink about it and what happens through\nthose holes for some of us is toxins\nbegin to distribute through the body\nand our body then identifies that\nmaterial as toxins and it activates our\nimmune system causing inflammation\nthe issue becomes when that inflammation\nas it does for most of us travels up to\nour brain\nour brain can become inflamed and\ndamaged in the same way that our gut did\nand when our brain becomes inflamed we\ncan suffer the symptoms that very much\nfeel\nlike depression we're talking about our\ngut for another reason because of the\nfood that we're eating\nwe need food as humans that are high in\ncertain nutrients one nutrient that's\nbeen as of recently very much implicated\nas a cause of depression is something\ncalled sam e s-a-m-e\nthis nutrient works in conjunction or as\na team member to two other nutrients\nto our b vitamins and our foley\nall three of those together when we\ndon't have enough\nwe might again suffer the symptoms of\ndepression so if we're not getting\nnutrients and if we're not getting those\nparticular nutrients we might be\nstruggling with what feels like\ndepression\nsleep is another area we want to explore\nif we're not sleeping enough if we're\nsleeping too much\nall of these factors might be\ncontributing to our mood into how we\nfeel\nso does movement\nfor some of us when we feel depressed\nactivating quick movements stimulating\nour musculature body can help increase\nour stagnant energy and can help resolve\nthe symptoms of depression\nas can our breath\nfor a lot of us who feel depressed we're\nactually barely breathing at all and if\nwe are it's very shallow even very\nconstricted we might even be hunched\nbarely getting the breath into our body\ninto our lungs that we need\nlearning how to activate or stimulate\nour breath through a quick\nbreathing pattern can help us similarly\nstimulate our body's energy helping\nresolve those symptoms of depression\na final area that we want to explore are\nour hormones\nwomen who are premenstrual\nwho are postpartum who are\nperimenopausal\nall of those fluctuations that happen\nfor some of us monthly\ncontribute to our mood to our energy\nsome of us who don't have regulated\nhormone levels generally or during those\ntimes of the month or post-labor\nmight be suffering with symptoms of\ndepression again all related to those\nunderlying dysregulation in our hormones\nso how do we begin to do the work\nas always we definitely don't want to\nchange our life from top to bottom we\ndon't want to do something different in\nall of those areas starting tomorrow\nwill overwhelm ourselves the best path\nforward is picking one small daily\npromise in one of those areas\nfor some of you it might be paying\nattention to what you're eating\nit might be learning how to move our\nbody in a more stimulating way or\nbreathe in a more stimulating way to\nhelp move that stagnant energy help lift\nour mood and our symptoms of depression\ni'd love to hear from those of you out\nthere who have been on this journey to\nheal your depression and also those who\nare new to it what is the number one\ntool you found most impactful on your\njourney of healing your depression"
