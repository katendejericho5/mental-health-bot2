    "transcript": "this video is inspired by a question i\nget asked most frequently when i talk\nabout doing the work or creating a habit\nof consciousness to create change in\nyour life\nthe question i get is\nhow do i know the difference between me\nbeing conscious and doing the work and\nme overthinking always being lost in my\nmind so today we're going to explore\njust that\nwe'll first cover the difference between\nconsciousness and overthinking\nand then of course we'll talk about how\nto begin to cultivate consciousness in\nyour life\nso what is the difference between\nconsciousness and overthinking so doing\nthe work\nwhy do we talk about consciousness when\nwe talk about doing the work\nmost of us are living in habits and\npatterns that we formed back in our past\noften in our childhoods that no longer\nserve us we're running in that autopilot\nthat many of you have probably heard me\nor someone else speak about\nso to create change we of course have to\nbegin to make new choices and choices\ncome when we're not of course in that\nautopilot when we're instead in the\nconscious part of our minds so to create\nchange we want to build a foundational\nhabit of consciousness in our lives\nso what is the difference between this\nstate of consciousness that i'm\ndescribing and all other types of\nthought or overthinking in general so\nwhat consciousness is it's awareness of\nour thoughts or thoughts of course as we\nhave many throughout the day\nand the related ability to redirect our\nattention to choose whether or not we\ncontinue to think those thoughts lost in\nour mind or whether we make the choice\nto redirect our attention elsewhere to\nthe current moment the conversation i'm\nhaving maybe even to this video that\nyou're watching right now\nthis of course is different than over\nthinking\noverthinking is the tendency to get\nstuck in our thoughts not to be able to\nremove that spotlight of attention\nwe're lost in thought thoughts that\nmight be about the past the future they\nmight be critical thoughts again the\nthoughts were caught in or different for\neach and every one of us\ni know for me i was always lost either\nworrying about the issue i had in the\nmorning or\nworrying about the issue i could have\nlater in the day\nanother difference between consciousness\nand overthinking\nconsciousness includes the ability to be\naware of and present to the current\nmoment right that ability to take my\nfocus from wherever else it is and be\nfully present to whatever is going on in\nthe current moment letting my senses\neven be receptive to the moment smelling\nthe aromas feeling my feet on the ground\nbeing in my body ground in this moment\nin time\nthis of course is different\nthan over thinking overthinking is often\ntimes where we find ourselves distracted\nfrom the present moment again whether\nwe're lost in the past the future we\nmight not even know where we are\nfor me i called it my spaceship because\nsometimes i didn't know where i was i\njust knew i wasn't present here and how\ni knew is because i was often forgetful\ni'd read a book i'd watch a movie i'd\nnot remember what it was about even 10\nminutes later i'd see my friends for\nlunch i'd forget what we talked about\nagain that forgetfulness often goes hand\nin hand with that lack of presence\nbecause if i'm not really here if i'm on\nmy spaceship say i can't really be fully\npresent and receptive to what's\nhappening so chances are i don't have a\nmemory to even revisit later\nanother difference between consciousness\nand overthinking\nconsciousness includes the ability to\ncheck in with our emotions not only ours\nto attune ourselves to the emotions of\nothers and again the related ability to\nredirect our attention away\nnot to become engulfed in those emotions\nas we often do when we're\noverthinking\noverthinking often results in hyper\nvigilance around our emotions think\nabout it this way if we're constantly\nthinking whether it's stressful thoughts\nwhether it's anger invoking thoughts\nwhether it's sad thoughts chances are\ni'm probably constantly feeling those\nways too\nand again that's the difference when i'm\nstuck in those feelings versus\nconsciousness the ability to see\nof course we always we all have angry\nthoughts we all have sad thoughts we all\nhave worrying thoughts\ndo we also then have the ability to\nremove the focus not to become then that\nfeeling but to shift our attention\nelsewhere and that's what we develop\nwhen we cultivate consciousness\nso how do we begin to practice\nconsciousness in our lives we talk about\nthis foundationally in our self-healer\ncircle our online virtual community the\nfirst tool that we give all new members\nis consciousness building awakening our\nconsciousness where we make the\nsuggestion as i'll make to all of you\nlistening right now\nto set an alarm on your phone for a\nrandom time during your waking hours of\ncourse say 2 30 p.m so that when 2 30\ncomes you'll probably forget you set\nthat alarm and when that alarm goes off\nhere's the check-in\ncheck where is your attention\nare you actually conscious maybe you\nwere lost in thought at that moment\nthough can you return your attention\nfully into your body fully to whatever\nit is you're doing in that moment\nor again are you so far lost in thought\nthat you're not connected at all and\nthen of course if you're like me always\nchecking that ladder box i was never\npresent to what was happening each and\nevery time my alarm went off begin to\nrefocus that attention\nuse the present moment use whatever it\nis that you're doing maybe even just use\nthe fact that your body is breathing to\nbe that hook to bring you back into that\ncurrent moment\nconsciousness is so different from\noverthinking when we're in our thinking\nmind oftentimes we're still in those old\nstories those old habits as old patterns\nso creating this new habit of\nconsciousness really allows us to create\nthe change that we're looking for\ni'd love to hear from those of you out\nthere who have been noticing this\ndifference when am i being conscious and\nwhen am i overthinking i'd love to hear\nhow this practice is going from each of\nyou if you're liking these videos for\nthose of you who have not yet
