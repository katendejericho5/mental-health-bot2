    "transcript": "this video will explore how our nervous\nsystem affects us\nfirst we'll talk about the three main\nstates of nervous system activation\nand then dive into the effects each have\non us each day\nthe first state we want to explore is\nwhat is scientifically known as the\nventral vagal state some of you might\nhave heard it refer to as\nparasympathetic\nor as i call it our rest and digest\nthis is a state of peaceful calm energy\nwhere we're most grounded most present\nmost attentive to the current moment\nin this state we feel at peace we feel\nrelaxed we feel curious and we feel open\nfor connection\nin this state we are able to think to\nmake clear decisions\nto manage our life and even to be\nspontaneous to be creative\nour beliefs when we're in this state are\nthat the world is safe and that is not\nout to harm me\nin our relationships when we're in this\nparasympathetic mode this rest and\ndigest state we feel safe around others\nable to make eye contact to be\nvulnerable and to trust those around us\nthe next state i want to talk about is\ncommonly known as the fight or flight\nresponse it's when our nervous system is\nin a sympathetic state of activation or\nwhen we're in a survival mode when we\nfeel threatened\nin this state accordingly we often we\nfeel unsafe\nwe feel on edge hostile\noverwhelmed out of control\nin this state it affects us behaviorally\nit affects our minds we're not able to\nmake clear decisions we don't feel able\nto manage our life and oftentimes we\ndon't even feel safe in our bodies\nthis results in beliefs that the world\nis dangerous threatening out to harm me\nin our relationships those beliefs are\nreflected\nwhere we feel defensive we don't feel\nlike we can connect with other people\nand there's a very real reason why when\nwe're in this state of activation we\nactually confuse neutral faces so when\nsomeone's you know has a very blank\nexpression even we might confuse that\nfor a threatening face continuing again\nthat threat response in our whole bodies\nanother state i want to explore again\nscientifically it's been called the\ndorsal vagal state it's another form of\nour parasympathetic activation however\nthis results in a version of shut down\nwhen we're in this state we might feel\napathetic uninterested tired exhausted\ndisconnected hopeless\nwe might not feel inspired again we're\nnot able to create like we're able to in\nthat\nopen receptive state a ventral bagel\nthat we talked about sometimes we don't\neven feel emotion at all we might feel\nhopeless we might just feel flat nothing\nin this state we often have beliefs that\nthe world is hopeless pointless\nunfair not even worth investing myself\ninto it at all\nin our relationships the similar beliefs\nare reflected we might not even feel\nlike we want to connect we might not\nshare our feelings at all some of us\nmight avoid relationships entirely\nso how do we begin to do the work we\nwant to begin to cultivate awareness to\nlearn how to be a witness to ourselves\nwhen our body is in those different\nstates of nervous system activation\nbecause when we're in those different\nstates of nervous system activation as\nwe were just exploring\nit does affect everything from the way\nwe think and believe about the world to\nhow we operate in it especially in our\nrelationships so as we develop this\nawareness we can begin to extend\ncompassion to ourselves\nif we see these beliefs if we see this\ndefensiveness if we see these nervous\nsystem states in activation we might be\nable to understand what's going on for\nus at a deeper level\ni'm interested in hearing from you out\nthere\nanyone who's been observing their own\nnervous system and the effects it has\ni'd love to hear from you i know for me\ni spent almost a lifetime in that\nshutdown state that we just explored\ndissociated disconnected even though i\nwas achieving all these things in the\nworld i felt flat and i felt so\nemotionally alone\nso my healing began when i was able to\nidentify that i didn't have feelings i\nfelt flat i felt disconnected because of\nmy nervous system not because of any\ndeficit in myself or any unworthiness\nso again i'd love to hear from each of\nyou out there as you begin to explore\nthe effect your nervous system has on\nyou each and every day"
