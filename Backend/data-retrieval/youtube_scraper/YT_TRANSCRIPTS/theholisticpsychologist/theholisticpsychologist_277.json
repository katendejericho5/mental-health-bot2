    "transcript": "this is a video on your conditioned self\nor what your conditioned self is\nwe're going to cover what your condition\nself is\nhow it keeps you stuck and of course\nhow to begin to work with it so first of\nall what is a conditioned self a\nconditioned self is our habitual\nthoughts\nfeelings and behaviors that are based on\nour lived experiences\nstored in our subconscious mind and for\nmany of us become the autopilot that we\nshift into upwards of 90 percent of our\nday\nour conditions self at their core\ncontain unmet needs suppressed emotions\nthings that we weren't safe enough to\nshow in our earliest environments\noftentimes with those that we love the\nmost our parent figures our caregivers\nour conditioned selves also contain the\nhabitual ways that we attempted to cope\nwith those unmet needs\nwhen we're not conscious many of us are\ngoing through our day\nliving not as our authentic self but\ninstead as these assumed roles these\nconditioned selves whether it's the\noverachiever the caretaker the people\npleaser we shift into this state again\nas a habit as a habit that formed at a\ntime based on our lived experiences when\nour needs had gone unmet these of course\nbecome problematic because they're not\nhonoring our authentic needs they again\nare based on our conditioning\nso what do we do how do we begin to work\nwith our conditioned self\nwe want to empower ourself beyond our\nconditioning with two steps\nthe first step is to cultivate\nconsciousness\nto teach yourself how to begin to bear\nwitness to see\nthese very habitual thoughts feelings\nbehaviors roles that you are likely\nshowing up as day in and day out\nprobably most frequently in your\nrelationships when we become conscious\nwe then gift ourselves the opportunity\nto take step two\nto be able to integrate these cells what\ndoes integration mean integration means\nhonoring the deeper unmet needs again we\nadapt it into this self because needs\nhave gone unmet so when we integrate our\nconditioned self we honor those deeper\nunmet needs and now in that space where\nwe're not reacting in that old way\nwe may begin to make new\nchoices\nchoices that are now in alignment with\nthose deeper needs of this self now\nagain this is a practice these two steps\ndon't happen overnight for many of us\nwe've been living in these conditioned\nselves for a lifetime so for many of us\nthat means focusing in on step one\nbecoming conscious without judgment of\ncourse\nlearning how to bear witness to all of\nthese conditioned roles you've been\nplaying that then will set that\nfoundation for step two\nalso a journey undef also a journey in\nuncovering those deeper unmet needs and\nfor many of us exploring new ways that\nare more in alignment with who we are\ntoday\nso i'd love to hear from you anyone\nwho's met any of your conditioned selves\ndrop them in the comments what are you\nbeginning to notice what are the roles\nthat you are showing up as most\nfrequently if this is a new practice or\nif you have any questions i'll be\nlistening in the comments for those as\nwell"
