    "transcript": "so hello i'm super excited\nin just a few minutes i will be inviting\ndr\nshafali live with me dr shafali i've\nconnected with her work some time ago\nand so in alignment with the way i think\nthe way i conceptualize\npsychology the field the work all of the\nthings\nvery similar to my own journey dr\nshafali came through the system as a\nclinical psychologist\nand is really working with kind of\nmerging the field the eastern and the\nwestern so she's been\nan incredible source of inspiration for\nme\nand my work and now that i have the\nopportunity to connect with her\nlive and to introduce you all to her\nwork if you\nhaven't yet heard of her i am super\nexcited to do so\nso a little bit about dr shafali before\nwe get started\ndr shafali received her doctorate degree\nin clinical\npsychology from columbia university\nspecializing in the integration of\nwestern\npsychology and eastern philosophy she\nbrings\ntogether the best of both worlds for her\nclients\nshe is an expert in family dynamics and\npersonal development teaching\ncourses around the globe she has written\nfour books\nthree of which are new york times\nbestsellers including\nher two landmark books that some of you\nmight already be familiar with\nthe conscious parent and the awakened\nfamily\nand today we're going to be talking\nabout her very newest book\na radical awakening i blew through this\nbook if you guys can see i have a lot\ndog yard in there because it is so so\ngood\ndr shafali hello hello hello\nhow are you good i'm so happy to meet\nyou you know i was\nuh at lewis's lewis house's place doing\nan interview\nand he said oh you need to read this\nbook and you need to meet her and\nso here we are we've done we are here we\nare i have been such a fan of your work\nand watching your own journey and\nvery similar to mine figuring out a way\nto to kind of\nmove the field in a direction and i just\nthink you are such a trailblazer so\nthank you for everything you've been\nputting out in the world and\nlike i said i'm super excited for i know\na lot of my community\nprobably is very familiar with you in\nyour work but for those who aren't i'm\nsuper excited to introduce them because\ni know that they're going to gain\njust as much benefit as i have thank you\nso much and\ni'm so honored to be here really of\ncourse so let's start\nbecause i think you break your book down\ni blew through it i don't know if you\nsaw me\nsaying that i have all these great parts\nthat i want to talk to you about or that\nresonated with me\num the first thing that i was really\nstruck by dr shafali is how you broke\ndown\nthe sections of the book with the first\none really jumped out at me asleep in\nthe matrix so i know\na lot of us have throwing this a word\naround matrix these days\nand what pill are you going to take so\ntalk to me a little bit about\nwhat you mean when you say matrix and\nwhat do you mean when you say we're\nasleep\num or many of us i should say are asleep\nin this matrix\nsure sure sure so what i describe as the\nmatrix\nis that we are living in a culture that\nwe\nthink uh pre-determines the way we\nshould be\nbecause we don't understand that it's\nconstructed\nso we live within it as if it's a\nmandate\na doctrine a cage where we don't\nunderstand that it's a bubble\nand it literally can change like like\nthat\nit's like by the flick of the finger but\nbecause it's been brainwashed into us\nwe think it has caged metal bars\nthat keep us inside subscribing to it\nso the radical awakening occurs when you\nunderstand\nthat the cage you live with within is a\nbubble that you can burst with the flick\nof your finger\nif your consciousness is ready for it\nsuch an incredible visual\nto think of and such an empowering\nstatement to make though i know a lot of\nlisteners are probably\nlistening from inside the bubble i know\nthat's where\nreally my own journey of healing and\nthen my own clinical journey and\nshifting my practice came\nwhen i too was stuck inside that bubble\nbut i was wondering why i was so bad\nat being a psychologist and helping\npeople get out of that bubble because i\nreally understood how stuck\nyou do feel and i use the word you know\nconditioning\nwhen i think about that influences the\ncycle of influences and i think that's\nwhat you mean when you say\nwhat is what is the impact what's\nforming that bubble and how does our\nconditioning really\nremove us from you use a word that's\nvery similar to a word i've used as\nessence\num and like that that part within and i\nknow i hear in my community we're always\nsearching for\nour intuition our inner knowing yet\nwe're stuck in the bubble of that\ndisconnection and i just love the way\nyou describe that because those bars are\nreal\nright so you and i know as psychologists\nthat there's nothing that can beat\nthe conditioning of the early years i\nmean it's\nan indomitable force that is like glue\nit's like super glue and we as\ntherapists were trying to\npeel the person away and we both know\nthat because we we are all surviving\nthat\nferocious hunger from childhood\nwe've created these masks right and\nthese masks that i call ego i'm sure you\ncall it ego or something like that these\nfalse personas\nkeep us in that very much\ntethered inside the cage so in my book\nof radical awakening i talk about\nthe two layers to radically awaken the\nfirst layer is to know that\nit's happening to you there's a matrix\nthat you're living within that is\neffing with your brain and the second\npart is now you are doing it to yourself\nright so the real radical part happens\nespecially when we women the oppressed\nwake up and go okay now i'm doing it to\nmyself i am like\nworse toward myself and my sisters than\nany man out there can ever be\nand that's when you begin to wake up and\nyou realize that you've internalized\nall that's loathing and all that shame\nand that it lives within you\nyes absolutely you've internalized the\nword that you revisit often in your book\nis expectation and i want to read a line\nand it's going to be\nyou know where i'm going to speak the\nword women and gender but i think we\ncould even blow this out to all though\nin terms of your book you wrote and this\nwas really poignant most women are\ntrained from an ur from early girl hood\nto crave what i call the triple threat\nthe need for approval\nvalidation and praise so just to get a\nlittle bit more concrete\nright when we're talking about the\nexpectations i do think that i loved how\nyou worded that then the kind of\nexpectation the need for the approval be\nmeeting the expectation of others\nso that we can get validated and praised\nand the way you're saying yeah it begins\noutside of us\nthough we become then the militant in\nour army where we're now\ndoing it on repeat some of us not even\naware\nthat we have that power in our minds\nyeah we're like robots in the army of\nour own self-destruction\nand dome we're the commanders in chief\nright\nso as children because we girls\nespecially\nmore than men and boys are trained to\nget our validation\nfrom what we do best what do we do best\nwe are\nnatural healers nurturers tribe builders\nconnectors\nthis is in our emotional dna but because\nwe do it so beautifully\nculture has marauded us to the point\nthat we now lose ourselves\nin the giving so we we give but in the\ngiving we are losing\nand we're so conditioned to to receive\nour validation am i even\nworthy of existence from the outside\nworld\nso we become people pleasers or uh\nachievers\nor really uh you know super nurturers or\nthe perfect mother the perfect wife\nwe're seeking validation like a drug\nthrough those expectations we put on\nourselves we don't realize\nwe are drug addicts yeah addicts to the\ndrugs of validation approval and praise\ni'm smiling um because seeking seeking\nthat\nperfection that word is is something\nthat really kind of at my core and for a\nvery long time dr shafali\ni you know obviously coming through the\nincredible amount of schooling that you\nand i went to\nright that's the obvious obviously\nseeking the achievement\nthe degree the letters after my name i\nunderstood that i\ni sought validation in those ways i like\nto be\nperfect to be seen as best however i\ndidn't see how pervasive that was\nto the extent that any expectation i\nwould put on myself\neven in my relationships to be the type\nof partner i\nwanted to be or thought i could be was\nthat drive to that perfection and when i\ndidn't meet\nmy own expectation or to complicate\nthings the expectation that i imagined\nsomeone else\nhad of me i would beat myself up and i\ndidn't realize for a very long time how\npervasive that drive\nfor perfection was because i think a lot\nof us naturally intuitive like oh yeah\nachievement\ndegrees accolades so i think a lot of us\npush ourselves\nin many different ways and we're not\neven aware of it\ni know i know we're just like compulsive\nyou know like it's just in our emotional\nwiring and we don't even\nsee that it is something that we have\ninherited\nbecause we grew up like that and and we\ncan see it when we begin to break down\nso breaking down as a therapist in a\nweird way\nis the gift right and you know as a\ntherapist we are waiting for rock bottom\nwe're like when will this person wake up\nand that's a terrible thing to want but\nit's a beautiful desire because we know\nit's coming\nand so when is the wake up call going to\nbe the real wake-up call\nso you know people don't even know that\nwhen their jaw is clenched\nthat is anxiety when their chest is\npalpitating that is anxiety\nwhen they're cursing and yelling all the\ntime or eating 10 cookies a day\nthat is yourself out of alignment\nsomething is awry screaming help me help\nme\nand we're not listening because our\nrobotic compulsion is to keep going\nbut one day is going to break down\nbecause the false self cannot last\nand that is an opportunity for a radical\nawakening it is the radical awakening\nmoment\nbut we are so afraid of it that we run\nback into our show\nyes well the unfamiliar as we talk about\nin my community\num at extent is is very uncomfortable it\nis something to run from but you're\nbringing up another point that i think\nis interesting here\nand i love what you do in your book um\nso the point you're bringing up is for\nso many of us dr shafali\nwe haven't known any different these are\nmasks that we have been wearing\nfrom as young as we can remember and you\npresent this whole i think it's in your\nconfronting the shadow section of\nall of the different faces of ego where\nfor lack of a better word archetype\ncomes to mind for me just because that's\nwhat i call it\nbut you do prevent i mean you do you do\nprovide\nthese roles right you do show like these\nare masks that so many of us\nwear and the point being i think is that\nwe wear that for so long\nand we make maybe feel the effects of it\nwe might feel disconnected we might feel\nunfulfilled some of us making feel angry\nand resentful of the world around us\nbecause our needs are consistently not\nmet\nthough we don't have a point of contrast\nbecause there's no other way we've\nknown so i love how you provide i think\nthat's what's such an incredible i mean\nthe whole book from\nfront to back but i think that people\nare really helped when they're able to\nsee\nthemselves in these shadows that you pro\npresent so i think you did a really\nreally great job and i'd love for you to\nsay a little bit about the shadows and\nthen again the role that they play you\nknow so\nthat's why books like yours and mine are\nso\ni'm praising ourselves i just realized\nbut it's okay\nit's okay the reason why they're good\nbooks is because\nlike you said we don't know\nthat we're going through an experience\nit's nebulous\nit's what we've always done it's the\nfish in the water doesn't understand\nit's wet\nso we need somebody to show oh my\ngoodness that's me that's me\nthis is the path so in my book i\nseparated it into the\ndifferent journey the different aspects\nof the journey the first part is that to\nrecognize you're asleep\nhow to know i'm asleep so i talk about\nthat and i use my own example very\ndeeply about how i was asleep and i was\nin a in a haze and a daze and a fog\nand then the next phase is where you\nbegin to wake up\nand the first thing you have to confront\nare these false selves that you've been\nliving i've been living\nlike a people pleaser all my life i've\nbeen living as a conflict avoider oh\nshoot\nso the different faces that i talk about\narchetypes\nare the ones that i see women typically\ntake\nare the givers such as the empath the\nsavior\nthe bleeding uh the bleeding empath the\nsavior like you and i\nare and uh how we must constantly\ngain our validation from the act of\ngiving\nand the act of giving is polluted with a\ndesire to receive validation back it's\nnot pure giving\nand then the controllers are the\nperfectionists\nuh the tyrants you know the passive\naggressive ones the shield the strong\none\nuh the helicopter uh and then the takers\nno one likes to think they're taker but\nevery one of us is a taker\nis the diva the diva in us the princess\nwho just wants to wait for it to happen\nyou know we're like oh i'm supposed to\ntake charge of my life\nwhat i thought i'd just be picked and\nbecome the queen of the world\nso i lay out these archetypes and then\nafter you\nunderstand who you are and how you've\nplayed your false self\nthe next section in my book i talk about\nembracing your sexuality why because we\nas women\nhave been so blasphemized to be\nin our sexual energy we've been labeled\n you know all the words so we have\ngreat shame\nabout our vagina and we don't explore it\nand in that\nin our lack of sexual freedom and\nexploration\nwe actually give in to the patriarchy we\nactually allow the patriarchy to have\nits power over us because we believe\nwe need a man or we need a relationship\nso the patriarchy you know keeps us\ncontrolled keeps us\nsmall and then the next section i talk\nabout awakening\nyou know cracking the matrix what does\nthat mean\nwell now you have to do the real work\nyou have to examine your belief systems\naround love around marriage around\ngoodness around youth around beauty so i\ntalk about that\nand then the last section is how do you\nreally awaken\nuh so books like ours help people\nto place themselves on the continuum of\nconsciousness to go oh\ni'm there oh i've done that and you\nbegin to have a synergistic experience\nwith your sister the author\nand you realize you're not alone yes yes\ni love how you break it down\ntoo into the evolution of the journey\num because i see and we're human and we\nwant the road back we want to know how\nlong this step will take and then when i\ncan progress onto step two so i can\nneatly check step one's box and\nunfortunately when we're talking about\nhealing and we're talking about right\ndeveloping the conscious\nawakening it doesn't it's not as clean\nit's not as linear and you know so i\nlove how your\noverviewing the process allowing for all\nof the individual\nvariation within that it isn't a neat\nlinear easy step where there's a one two\nthree model to follow\nbut these are generally the stages of\nthe process and\ni want to read one more line from your\nbooks i think it's so beautiful and i\nlove how you talk about\nlove and i think about love a lot\nbecause i think about relationships a\nlot\nat the heart of us as humans are the\nrelationships that we're in\nand how connected we are to\nnot only ourselves but of course then by\nextension the people\nand the world around us and the way you\nyou\nwrite this these two sentences on love i\njust think is so beautiful\nand you write love is the ultimate\nenergy\nit is the self fully actualized and i\njust\ni just love that because i love love but\nthat is\nso for me an important piece of the\nwhole picture\nbecause if we want to tie on these masks\nand love\nright to me i see all of this\nconditioned way of being just to use all\nthe language we've been using all of\nthese masks all of this ego all this\nshadow\nfrom in my perspective that's a\nseparation from the love\nthat we are at our core and as we begin\nto awaken and peel all this back\nthe way you word it and the way i hear\nit at least is so beautiful we actually\nregain then\naccess to that which we already were um\nso it's not that we're seeking i think\nabout this a lot for the things outside\nof me and for the love that i can find\nsomewhere else\nwe're unearthing that beautiful\nself-love energy\nthat some of us might not believe me and\nwatching the comments because we might\nnot have been connected to that energy\nfor a very long time\nbut that in my opinion is the journey\nhome and i just love that so i'm going\nto read one more time\nlove is the ultimate energy it is the\nself-fully actualized i chose\nso beautiful it's so it's it takes away\nthis idea\nthat you have to find love you have to\nfall in love\nit has nothing to do ultimately with the\nexternal\nand and the reason why love has messed\nup\nso many relationships is because the\nidea of love\nis that it has to do with the other what\nwe don't understand\nthe actualized self is love embodied\nand when you are at that level of\nfrequency whatever word you want to use\nit\nwhatever you want to use for it then you\nautomatically\nare going to move towards relationships\nwhere you can\nkeep at that frequency so it's there's\nno\nseeking love looking for love falling in\nlove upset about love betrayed in love\nthose concepts fall away there's no\nbetrayal\nthere's no forgiving those are those are\nconcepts that exist in the dualistic\nworld\nof me versus you when you understand\nthat everything\nis uh bouncing off your own energy\nnobody can betray you because it's\nbouncing off you so you're part of it\nand so in this book i talk a lot about\nthat our ultimate power comes especially\nas women in our co-creation in our\nunderstanding of our co-creation you're\nnot a victim\nyou're not a blamer nobody's done\nanything to you on the emotional level\non the physical level people can harm us\nbut on the emotional level ultimately\nour radical awakening occurs\nwhen we realize our co-creation in our\nown oppression\nright i write that the the the lion\nof the patriarchy can only be fed by the\ncivility of the oppressed\nright the there is no outside oppressor\nwithout the civility of the oppressed so\nwe are playing our part\nand how are we playing our part when we\nlook in the mirror and we objectify\nourselves\nway more than any man has ever done\nright\nthey may just say oh you have a flat ass\nor oh you're so whatever oh you're so\nbeautiful\nbut we go no no no do you see this\nand do you see that this i mean we are\ninsane\nwe are the surgical critics beyond\nbelief\nso who is the ultimate oppressor we are\nright\nif we can the thought i had to dr\nshivali right there you say this\nif some of us can even look in the\nmirror\nright so many of us even avert our eyes\nstruggle to even see the physicality\nthat is us um that that you know mirror\nwork i think because\nmaybe i'm speaking from my own my own\nexperience it's hard it's hard to look\nat yourself and then to\nyou know the tendency is to look in\njudgment\nof ourselves and you're right oftentimes\ni say the critical voice we become the\nworst enemy we do become\nthe conditioning that then lives within\nour head that keeps us trapped\ngoing back beautifully full circle in\nthe bubble and to empower\nourselves i love that i actually just\ngot off of a workshop for my self-healer\ncircle\nwhere we talked all about our energy in\nthe context of the energy as it connects\nwith the world around us the energy of\nother people and the energy of the world\nand how ultimately the goal is to\nempower ourselves\nto use the energy that is us the love\nenergy the presence that we are\nyou use that word in your book i love\nthat talking about the role of presence\nbeing here right and how shifting into\nthat space can be empowering it can be\ndevastating\nthere was many participations i had to\nlook at roles i was playing\nmasks i was wearing right the way i was\ncontributing to\nnot happy healthy energy that was\npainful\nfor me to see in reflection though in\ndoing that it allowed me to create\na new reality and that's what your book\ndoes a radical awakening i've been\nseeing a couple questions coming in so\nanyone\nwho wants the name a radical awakening\nwe'll make sure that\nwhen this goes up we have all of your\ncontact info but tell
