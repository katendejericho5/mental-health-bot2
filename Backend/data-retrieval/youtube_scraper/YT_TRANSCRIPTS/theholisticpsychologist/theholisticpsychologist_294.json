itself all of the\ntools that you constantly hear nicole\ntalking about and sharing on instagram\num have really been compiled in such a\nbeautiful way in this book and i know so\nmany people have been asking\nuh you know what's in the book what what\ndo you talk about how is it different\nfrom instagram so we really just want to\ngo over some things that\nparts that i love about the book that\nreally just naturally is a flow of you\nknow\nyou're new to a healing journey what is\na healing journey and kind of\nchronicling you know okay well\nnow that i understand what it is and\nconsciousness how do i put these tools\ninto place and kind of just\ntaking us on a conversation and overview\nof really some\nsome bullets in the book that we love\nand really just having\na free-flowing convo with you guys to to\ngive you a little bit of what is inside\nthis beautiful book that has been a\nlabor of love i know personally too\nseeing nicole pour her heart and soul\ninto this book\nover the last year has been incredible\nand phenomenal to see and to see the\nlove that has gone into it it truly\ntruly is nicole to a masterpiece so i\nknow\nyour team knows that um so we also thank\nyou\nand before i get too emotional um\ni want to dive into the beginning part\nof the book i'm going to read some parts\nof it that i love\nand then would love to just join you in\ncombo\num this first part so on the cover of\nthe book\nhow to do the work recognize your\npatterns heal from your past and create\nyourself\ni want to dive into in chapter two we're\ntalking about\nthe conscious self becoming aware\nso this is actually in the book on page\n25 if you have it you guys can follow\nalong\nand nicole writes when people hear about\nmy whole person\napproach to healing they want to dive\nright in and meet their inner child\nstart their parenting process do the ego\nwork remove the trauma\nthis desire for the quick fix emblematic\nof the western culture in many ways\ncomes from an understandable want\nunderstandable want to end the\nincredible discomfort of living with\nthese wounds\nbefore we can get to these deeper layers\nwe first have to gain\nthe ability to witness our internal\nworld it may not sound sexy but it's\nfundamental\neverything that follows is grounded in\nawakening your conscious\nawareness i love diving into the book in\nthis section because it is\nvery important um i know as we start\nwhen you learn of this healing journey\nyou just want to do do do and i think\none of the things here in nicole where\nyou talk about\nyou know when people hear about my whole\nperson approach to healing and what it\nis that you really mean by whole person\nyeah absolutely and this is really jenna\ninformed by\nmy my own obviously experience as a\nhuman um and also my clinical practice\nwhich for a very long time i i saw it as\nnot really offering the full\ncomprehensive tools for empowerment and\ni i saw this in my own life\nas someone who considered myself with\never increasing you know insight and\nawareness\ni too have been in therapy i've laid on\nthe couch if you will\nin psychoanalysis so continuing to\nunderstand myself\nand obviously working as a practitioner\nin the room attempting to\nto help instill that level of awareness\nin my clients\nyet i kept finding myself and others\nincredibly\nincredibly stuck i think that's the\nnumber one word that keeps coming up\nand of course when we're stuck usually\nwe're struggling in some way we're\nuncomfortable\nwe're repeating patterns that don't\nserve us and as\na human myself who was quite\nuncomfortable when you read the\nthe start of the book and i share a\nstory where i'm crying into my oatmeal\ni mean i don't think you know words\nreally could express how deeply\nunfulfilled i was and mainly because i\nwasn't\nconnected to the depth of that lack of\nfulfillment\nyet it was i was struggling and i wanted\nto change yet i couldn't figure out how\nso it really was my own journey of\nunderstanding\nthe very incomplete way that many of us\nare thinking about\nourself with many of us maybe trying\nthe mantra approach the affirmation\ntrying to think ourself\ntoward being better because we're\nuncomfortable to different degrees\nyet we can't so really honoring again\nthe the places that we all come from\nin our despair and in our struggle and\nof course\nthe work the book now is my hope of\ngiving people the toolkit\nreally understanding as we'll talk a bit\nmore\nof how this is a process of healing and\nhow i very intentionally in the\nbeginning of the book\ntalk a lot about like jenna offered this\nconcept of consciousness\nand it's in my opinion it's because it's\nthrough the foundation of becoming\nconscious\nthat two things become really apparent\nhow stuck we are\nand how unconscious we're living again\nrepeating the habits and patterns that\nlive in our subconscious\nand then obviously giving us the tools\nand the pathway forward so i want to\nhonor every individual out there who\nhas met my work in one form or another\nand now who may have the book or might\nbe considering ordering the book\nhonoring again where you're at on your\njourney acknowledging it it\nis our natural tendency to want to plow\nthrough okay i know what hurt me in the\npast and now i want to get better\nbut i'm urging everyone who might pick\nup this book\nreally to settle into that practice of\nconsciousness first\nit is until we see ourselves clearly\nthat we gift ourself then with the\nchoice to create change\ni love that and if you're hearing that\nand thinking you know\ncoming to a place of consciousness or\nwhere to begin that's exactly what this\nportion we're talking about here in the\nbook\nbegins to go into i know for me\npersonally on my own healing journey as\nwell when you first get introduced to\nthe work or the work of healing in\ngeneral and consciousness you really\ni personally experience getting to a\nplace of wanting to like do do do\nyou first learn about and it's okay i\nwant to heal i want to go in i want to\nget all this done right now kind of in\nthis quick fix you know if i order food\ni can\nfind something on my phone and have it\nat my door in 30 minutes and\nit's it's normal and often times we go\ninto healing and also have that same\ndesire to do this quickly and it's\nvery i think it's written out\nbeautifully in the book really as a\nstepping stone\nand an introduction to the fact that\nthis is a journey you are\nembarking on if you're not already and\nthis is supplemental\nthis is giving you access to opening a\ndoor to really embarking on a longer\njourney\nthat does begin with awakening\nconsciousness and beginning a\nconsciousness practice and if you're\nwondering you know\nhow do i do that that's exactly what\nthis book is for is to supplement a\njourney and also to open a door and to\nto welcome you into embarking on a new\njourney\nyeah and i think as we become that's\nvery beautifully spoken jenna and as we\nbecome more conscious\num what we're able to to really fall\ninto witnessing of\nis our really interconnected being the\nfact that we\nare a physical body um again like i\ndescribed earlier i was so disconnected\nfrom how i\nfrom the depths of how unfulfilled i\nfelt\nbecause i was so disconnected for so\nlong\nfrom my physical body those of you who\nare familiar with my work um and who\nwill pick up the book will read about my\nspaceship\nthat i used to dissociate or detach\nmyself from the very overwhelming\nfeelings that lived in my body for so\nlong\nit was my it was my life support it was\nmy raft it was how i\nkept myself safe and it wasn't until i\nconsistently began to practice\nconsciousness that i\nmet my physical body and all of its\nsensations\nand then of course even more complicated\nare our emotional\ncenters the fact that we have energies\nand hormones that course through us\nthat as far as i'm concerned are\nmessengers they contain messages our\nfeelings this whole emotional world\nand then of course there's so many of us\nthat are awakening\nto the to the essence of humanity to the\nreality that there is this uniqueness\ninside each and every one of us\nwhether or not you want to call it a\nspirit or a soul or give it a name or\njust\nwe're all kind of i think falling into\nthat awareness that there is something\nthat makes me me\nthat makes jenna jenna makes for a\nconfircon and really kind of embodies\nwho we are and as like i said we begin\nto practice consciousness\nat least for me we begin to meet those\nparts of ourself and the the most\nfrequently asked question i get from\npeople who are discovering this essence\nand i'm sure you've probably heard this\ntoo is\nwell where is my intuition how do i know\nwhat my purpose is how do i know if i'm\nwalking in the right direction\nwhether it's in my relationship or in my\nlife you know at scale\nand the how we meet ourself is by\nbecoming conscious\nto our full being so what holistic work\nand wellness means to me\nwhat i sincerely hope the field of\npsychology begins to embrace\nis a holistic model of healing really\nhonoring that we are all\nliving life on this in this human\nexistence in a physical body\nand again we all have emotions very\nnatural\nmessengers of humanity really and again\nreally beginning to honor our uniqueness\nso my hope again is we embrace\nour fullness of humans and really\nunderstand that\nthe more disconnected we are from those\nparts of self the more likely we are to\nbe stuck\nin the ways that we're stuck\nthank you i think that beautifully\nilluminates the\njust the beginning of this where it says\nyou are not your thoughts and\nyou're like you're saying you're not\nyour thoughts you're actually the soul\nthe being whatever it is that you want\nto call it who's actually thinking those\nthoughts and where you say\nyou know when people hear about my whole\npersonal approach to healing i think\nwell you just spoke that\nreally illuminates beautifully that it\nit is a mind body\nsoul spirit whatever it is that you want\nto call it that there is that level of\nconsciousness yes in our thoughts\nalso in our bodies and our connectedness\naround us so it's really\num i think it's incredible what you are\ndoing in the field of psychology and\njust\nreally illuminating that there is so\nmuch more\nin a whole person approach to this\nhealing and what we're doing and i think\nit's kind of been like\na missing link or bridge that is is\nclearly very powerful to everyone who's\ntuning in now and everyone who's already\npre-ordered and purchased the book i\nknow you've been\njust watching you write it as well there\nis something that is uniting all of us\ntogether for\nfor this teaching and this truth that i\nthink whether you can put a name to it\nalready\nthere there's a reason you're watching\nthis there's a reason you've gotten the\nbook there's a reason a friend gave it\nto you there is something already about\nit that is uniting us which is\nvery much part of that deeper whole\nperson approach that you're talking\nabout\nyeah i couldn't agree more and i've\nalways said you know one of one of the\npromises i made to myself\nin my healing journey was to to learn um\nhow to speak my truth because i i really\nstruggled in that way and i\ni really centered myself on the\nawareness that\nif i was able to embody my truth and put\nit out to the world that it would find\nits way to the people so i see that\nbeautifully every day in the creation of\nthe self-healers community\num now obviously that is trans\ntransferred over into the circle and now\num the book so i i agree i think that we\nall\nhave found the message um at the time\nthat we needed it\nand really we're all in different places\nof our healing journey as well\nand really honoring that space because\nit is brave\nto begin to even consider what for many\nof us our new ideas our challenging\nideas very much as a part of my own\nhealing journey there was a lot of\nshedding\na lot of grief of old belief systems old\nstories and narratives\nwe're going to shift into and talk a\nlittle bit about how much narrative\nshape our life\nbut i like all of you listening had so\nmany of those that were ingrained\nin who i thought i was and in how i\nthought my life would play out\nand time and time again you know i i\nbegan to challenge those and peel back\nand and within that is a lot of grief so\ni just want to honor\neach and every one of you who like i\nsaid for so many of you these are\nthese are new these are challenging uh\nmessages even though i know that you\nfound your way here for a reason\nand even just for those seeing the back\nend of nicole and as she's written this\nbook and is involved in these teachings\nseeing you and hearing you talk now\nabout\nyour intuition and finding your truth\nand that voice i know\nsince we've converged paths over the\nlast year\nyear and a half now it's been an honor\nand very beautiful to also watch you\nembody the work that you're teaching\nbecause i know even now the layers that\nyou're talking about or the grieving\nthese\nthese aren't like past things this isn't\na one-stop shop where suddenly like oh\nyou know nicole wrote the book she's\ndone and she's good these are things\nliterally on a daily basis as a team as\nnow i consider you family it is\nit's a beautiful honor to witness and\nalso to see that two behind the scenes\ngoing through this work in real time on\na daily basis i've seen\nyou speaking now and even just your\nessence sitting here versus how you were\non camera a year ago or two years ago is\nit's been really cool behind the scenes\nto see like you know i think\ntwo months ago it was like nicole's new\nbirthday because nicole had arrived and\nit was really just\nit's nicole's truth and you're really\ncoming into you\nand speaking yourself i know everything\nall the current events just everything\nthat's been happening over the last year\nyou really have taken this and embodied\nand gone through\nshedding those old beliefs and there are\nstill ones in present\npresent day now that it's continually\nit's very powerful to watch you work\nthrough especially on such a main stage\nand really to have that transparency and\nvulnerability i think too\nis you can also really learn and gain\nwisdom from the book\nactually just by watching and listening\nso also thank you\nthank you for sharing and for allowing\nyourself to evolve\nin front of me in front of us in front\nof everyone i appreciate you\nyou acknowledging all that jenna and and\nyou everyone out there who who follows\nthe instagram probably wonders how there\ncan be so much content and it's because\nwe live it\nday in and day out and now i spend this\nis our life a lot of time with humans\nwho are walking the same healing journey\nwith me and we can all jokes aside there\nthere are still challenges day in and\nday out\num i know probably a lot of people do\nlook at you know someone like myself i\nhave my name on a book now with this\nidea that\ni am that ideal done i think that we all\nlook for it's all good now\ni'll be the first person to share with\nthe reason why there's so much content\num is because there is no done and i am\nstill very much\na work in healing progress um even those\nof you who have suffered through my\nearliest of videos can even i think\nbegin to see\nwhat jenna's indicating all of the\nevolutions that\nyou know i am still working through day\nin and day out so it is an honor to\nshare my story with each and every one\nof you\non whatever platform you meet my work\nand now obviously within the covers of\nthis book\nbecause i do go into aspects of my past\nexperiences that\nyou know i may not have necessarily\nshared thus far\non any of the social media platforms\nthat i do speak about in the book\nso there's a lot of me um in this and a\nlot of\nvulnerability and i'm someone who on my\nspaceship i was very protected\nfrom this very vulnerable space and it\nis even challenging for me\nto you know knowing that i have such an\namazing resource next to me\num really in all of my team there's\nstill so many moments where it's hard\nfor me to\nto ask and to say i'm struggling so i'll\nbe the first one to\nto acknowledge and honor that i am still\non the journey\nright alongside each and every one of\nyou and it is truly an honor to be here\non the journey with each of you\nas you go into the book as well you do\nlearn from\nyou learn about you know little nicole\nand really the journey of nicole so\nthere's also while\nit's packed with so many tools for\nhealing\nit also is so relatable in just relating\nto your life and you as little nicole\nand you\nyou know growing up as a teenager and\ninto college to where you are\nnow makes it very relatable in a way\nwhere i can\ninstantly i think no matter where a\nperson comes from we come from very\ndifferent backgrounds and yet\nare still in the same place on a very\nsimilar path\nand it's that relatability i think in\nyour sharing that also gives you such\naccess\nthat this could essentially just read\ncover to cover\nlike a fiction book as if you're reading\nsomeone's life story and\npacked in there are so many so many\namazing tools along the way\num one of which i want to dive into this\nin particular\nthis is chapter six this is probably\nit's hard to say a favorite because i\nreally they're the whole book is a\nfavorite um but the power of belief\nis to me it's such a powerful one that i\ntruly love so\nwe're gonna go into move a little bit\nforward from that place from that\nsort of stuckness and that grieving now\nthat we've recognized\nneeding to dive into consciousness and\nour past we're gonna look at\non the cover healing from our past\nand so we're going to do that in chapter\nsix i'm going to read right here from\nthe book\nit's been said that we tell ourselves\nstories in order to live these stories\nare often based in our actual\nexperiences\nbelieving we're desirable because we\nwere pursued romantically from a young\nage\nsometimes these stories often created in\nchildhood are never updated and don't\nreflect our current reality\nthose of us like myself who may who\nmight have been who might have been a\nshy child may continue to consider\nourselves a shy person\neven though we no longer feel or act\nthat way\nnow let me just look here\ni had some other notes up here that i\nwanted to read\nokay so let's talk a little bit about\nthat so looking at you as\nmaybe little nicole or little nicole is\na shy child and going into\nyou sort of embody this like belief or\nthis narrative that you are\nshy so as an adult you're showing up\nfrom that past and those patterns\nas now a shy person almost as an\nidentity\nyeah absolutely so little known fact um\nis that i was incredibly shy i'm sure\nsome of you listening might see\nthe follower count on some of my social\nmedia and think how the hell\num could i be someone who is shy though\ni was a little girl who it's a running\njoke in my family used to\nliterally hide behind my mom's leg um\nwhen strangers came into the home\ni could be found under the the dining\nroom table um we all had i think that\nchildish belief that if you can't see me\nor if i can't see your eyes you can't\nsee me yet\ni very much heard hi nicole being\nshouted from the other room wishing i\nwas invisible under that table so\ni'm very very shy in childhood and\nthat's just one example of\nmany of the narratives that we begin to\ncreate about ourselves so of course\nmy i'm shy narrative was born out of\nevents where i didn't have many friends\nin childhood where i was\nyou know seemingly afraid of people not\nreally the the child who was gonna have\nor strike up a conversation\nwith the strangers next to me there's so\nmany other stories however that lived in\nmy own\nsubconscious mind about who i was what i\nwas\nwhat my position in the world what was\ngoing to be ultimately in life\nand really about everything in life we\nall create stories\nsomething that unifies us i know we have\nquite an international community\nso regardless of where you are around\nthe world something that unifies us as\nhumans is we our minds our brains\nseek to understand the world through\nnarratives that's why many of us like\nbooks we like stories many of us are\neven amazing storytellers\nthis is how traditions were passed down\nthrough our ancestry for for a lot of us\nand again it's because we're wired to\nassa\nto create and assign meeting meanings to\nevents that happen\nin our life and then of course the more\nconsistently\nan event happens the more consistently\nour thoughts are\nvalidated by what happens to us the more\nwe become even more sure\nthat these stories are true\ni go into the book about a very helpful\nyet also very unhelpful little place\nlittle function in our brain it's called\nthe reticular activating system\notherwise known as the ras which works\nas a self-confirming belief\nmachine it's actually our mind's filter\nand what it does and we're very grateful\nfor this function like i said we need\nthis reticular activating system because\nif we had even in this one moment in\ntime\nif i had a tend to all of the stimuli\npresent here\nwe would completely there would be smoke\ncoming out of our ears we would be in\nfull overwhelm\nas humans so our brain outside of our\nconscious awareness\nhas to determine what is relevant for us\nin this moment what do i need to be\npaying attention to in this moment\nto continue to to live essentially and\nso what my mind\ndoes is it filters out everything else\nessentially so we become a\nself-confirming machine\nthe more we practice a thought the more\nit does\nmap on to what we see our experience in\nour environment\nthe more we're telling that reticular\nactivating system that this is relevant\nto who i am\nso the more that ras then filters out\nanything else and unfortunately what\nit's doing for us\nis it's filtering out disconfirming\nevidence it's filtering out the moment\nor the moments where\nsomething against what i believe to be\ntrue is present for\nus and that's so powerful because little\ndo we\nknow it and i've been doing this myself\nwe've been doing this our entire lives\nso while i use that example of me being\na shy\nchild that was called into question in\nmy in my\nhigh school years when my mom and i\nbegan to be a little less shy\ni began to have friends and i began to\nspeak a little bit more in groups in\npublic i began to you know\nnot be hiding under tables and i have so\nmany moments where\nwhen my mom was met with this new\nversion of me i would have friends over\na lot i'd love to have my friends at my\nhouse\nand my friends would be now responding\nto not shy nicole and they would be\nyou know discussing me around my mom in\nparticular you know offering how\nthey view me now and i remember my mom\nbeing like\nmy nicole you're you're saying that\nabout my nicole\nand that's just one example of how not\nonly do we\nget locked in our stories about\nourselves but others around us do\ntoo obviously the work of self-healing\nis to become conscious\nof what are our stories first and\nforemost what are the ways that we're\nallowing those past experiences to\ncontinue to color\nour current moment typically again\nthrough the meanings\nthat we're assigning to what's happening\nand then obviously the meanings that\nwe're assigning to what's happening\ninfluences how we feel about what's\nhappening\nand those past experiences then that are\ncreating our patterns that do create\nthis belief around ourselves like you\nadd you know your example as a child or\nthat shy child\nreally growing into that having it\nreinforced by the environment around\nus it becomes a stronger and stronger\nnarrative with this meaning attached to\nit these\nall these stories of our lives that then\ninstills these beliefs and we talk\nbeautifully\nin you talk beautifully in the book the\npower of belief in this chapter\num specifically in the origin of belief\ni want to read this paragraph out\nbecause i think it\nis very powerful and for you guys who\nare maybe wondering well what is a\nbelief exactly\nnicole breaks it right down for you in\nthe book what is a belief exactly\na belief is a practice thought grounded\nin lived experience\nbeliefs are built up over years of\nthought patterns and require both\ninterior\nand exterior validation to thrive\nbeliefs about ourselves\nour personality our weaknesses our past\nour future\nare filters that are placed over the\nlens of how we view our world\nthe more we practice certain thoughts\nthe more our brains wire itself to\ndefault to these patterns\ni think that this is so wonderfully put\ni love here where you say\num beliefs about ourselves you know our\npersonalities our weaknesses our past\nour future our filters that are placed\nover the lens of how we view the world\nand for me i'm a very visual person so\nwhen i read this i think\nyou know all of those all those old\nthoughts those stories about myself my\npersonality my weaknesses my past\nall the meaning i've attached to them\nevery single one of them is kind of like\nputting on a pair of sunglasses\nand putting on another pair of\nsunglasses and another pair and another\npair\nso now i'm suddenly sitting here as\njenna but i have all of these layers of\nlenses in front of me\nfrom all of these past stories and\nbeliefs about myself\nthat actually in the book doing the work\nallows you to recognize and then break\ndown and remove each of those\none by one until you are left with your\nactual true self\nyeah it's such a beautiful i love i love\nyour visual examples\ni wish i had a bunch of glasses jenna\nalways paints beautiful pictures\ni'm very visual for me as well and as\nanother visual\nhuman um i love her how she paints that\num that's exactly what the case is we do\nwe are\ncoloring our experiences and like i said\ntypically what we're having the\nemotional reaction\nto um is the meaning that we're\nassigning\nso those of you who will read the book\nread about one of my\ncore narratives so shifting away from me\nbeing a shy person\none of my narratives that my\nsubconscious revisits time and time\nagain\nand likes to paint over pretty much\neverything that could be happening in my\ncurrent experience\nis this deep belief of me not being\nconsidered that's the language that that\nmy mind has has applied\nto pretty much a multitude of of\nexperiences\nand all roads i've come to realize as i\nbecome conscious\nso let's build on this on this\nfoundation usually taking the steps\nbecoming conscious becoming conscious\nthat again we're in a physical body and\nthat we're\nhave mental thoughts coloring our day\nday in and day out\nthe more we're a witness to that the\nmore we can see these narratives as they\ntake hold\nand then for instance as i learn how to\nbe a conscious witness\nto myself in daily life i can begin to\nvisually see\nif you will the themes that my\nsubconscious continues to offer\nand i speak in the book about how this\nreally is laid down in the hardware\nof our of our brain i'm sure by now many\nlisteners have probably\nheard the statement neurons that fire\ntogether wire together\nwhere that that's all happening you know\nin our brain\nneurons are firing and wiring each and\nevery second even\nall day long and what happens is the\nmore we fire certain networks\nthe more we're pumping up like iron\nwe're getting\nthose networks ready to be our\npredominant way of\nnarrating the world so what i came to\nwitness\nas i watched my own thoughts so anyone\nout there wondering well how do i know\nhow do i know what\nmy narratives are we learn how to to\nwitness our thoughts we learn how to\ndrop in and\nsee those in real time narrations\nand then typically you you tend to see\nthe stories that you tell yourself so\nback to my most frequently visited story\nwas i'm not considered so i'll use a\ngeneral example i text jenna\njenna doesn't respond to my text if i\nsee her lack of response and if i allow\nmy subconscious meaning which it's\nprimed to offer oh well that's because\njenna\ndoesn't consider me so likely in that\nmoment i mean i might feel a million\ndifferent things i probably feel some\nversion of hurt\nor upset and then typically what i might\ndo next\nis the thing i always do when i'm hurt\nor i'm upset so for me that's one of two\nthings\ni ignore you and act like i don't care\nthat you're ignoring me\nuntil of course i can't ignore you\nanymore and then sometimes i erupt i\nscream i yell and i ask you why the hell\nwhat what's wrong with you\nnow that could go a much different way\nif same event\ni text jenna she still doesn't respond\nto me for whatever reason\nif i make space in that moment and say i\ndon't offer that narrative of well\nshe's not responding because i'm not\nconsidered what if i offered a narrative\nof\nshe's not responding because she's busy\ndoing something else\na simply objective alternate version of\nwhat\ncould be the case in that moment\nobviously now listeners can probably\nimagine\nif i acknowledge that something else\nmight be causing her attention to not be\non my text in that moment as opposed to\nher lack of\nconsideration for me now of course you\ncan\nunderstand that i might allow a\ndifferent feeling and then i might allow\nmyself to respond\ndifferently in that moment so what i saw\nfor myself\nagain is i tended to revisit narratives\ni tended to color\nmy daily experiences with the same\nversion\nof what's happening without really fact\nchecking without seeing\nif that's the case and when we do that\nthat's one of the ways that we become\nlocked so our beliefs\nright operate down to the hardware down\nto how our brains are wiring and firing\nthen they kind of nudge our reticular\nactivating system and says here's the\nscript that we care about\nkill anything else 86 it for those of\nyou who are in the serving industry\nright\nand then we marry along continuing to\nstrengthen those narratives about\nourselves\nso anyone listening like i said the\nfoundation of consciousness not only\ndoes it allow us to connect\nto our body to our physical self to our\nemotional self to our spiritual selves\nand all of the needs\nthat we have that are ever changing in\nany of those areas\nas we begin to turn that spot spotlight\nof attention to our mental worlds you'll\nbegin to see\nfor yourself what are those narratives\nthat are coloring your daily\nemotional reactions and then the typical\nway you respond\nand are any of them up for modifying can\nwe begin to change can we\nupdate can we begin to create space\nfor some new feelings and then of course\nfor some new responses in the world\nand i think it's really important here\nto remember too everything you're saying\nis so powerful and i can see\nif even just now and as if you were on\nthe other side you know wanting that\nimmediately and to\ncontinue highlighting that you know you\ndidn't just snap your fingers and get\nhere overnight it's not like you woke up\nand thought oh i assign meaning to these\nstories\nokay cool well then if i don't text or\nif i text jenna and she doesn't write\nback\ni'm just going to choose to have you\nknow a workable meaning around it\nthat's not necessarily the case it is\nimportant to remember here that\nthis is a journey this is a practice um\nyou mentioned something earlier that had\nme think\nyou know when you go to the gym if\nyou're new to going to the gym or you're\nbarking on a new strength training\njourney or you want to get stronger\nyou don't go and begin lifting the\nheaviest weight first you likely won't\nbe able to lift it\nand this practice is much like that\nmuscle where you're going through\ncontinuously in small ways to build that\nmuscle\nto practice first that layer of\nconsciousness simply\nobserving being able to see that you\nhave thoughts\nand that you're not actually the\nthoughts themselves yet you're thinking\nit when you first\nhave that awareness then then you're\nable to be in the position that nicole's\nspeaking of these narratives where\nyou're able to watch them you're able to\nwatch your thoughts\ngo by um and then able with practice\nto strengthen that muscle and then\nbegin to get to a place where you\nactually can choose the meanings that\nyou're assigning narratives\nand choose something that works for you\nand if you're hear that and think okay\nwell great how do i do that\ni do want to show you at the back of\nevery chapter in the book\nthere are actual exercises for you to\ntools for you to take the context that\nyou've learned in the chapter the tools\nthat you're learning\nand then actually quite literally put\nthem into action you could write them\nright here in the book\nso every time you're introduced to\nsomething or everything that nicole just\nshared with you\nshe's then also so wonderfully at the\nend of that chapter it created a space\nfor\nin real time here are some prompts for\nyou to actually embody and put that work\ninto action\nso you're already set up right away to\nbegin practicing\nstrengthening that muscle yeah thank you\nfor that that very beautiful reminder\njenna\num then i'm going to second that and\noffer don't expect\nto believe new things about yourself\novernight don't expect for\nall of everything that we've been\npracticing day in and day out to change\nthis is why for a lot of us you know\nmantra work affirmation work this idea\njust think a new thought\ndoesn't actually work because our whole\nsubconscious mind here i'll paint a\npicture for for us all\nlike jenna is kind of rolling its eyes\nit's saying yeah okay\nthat's actually not what i believe why\nwould i believe\nthese things all of my life and probably\nevery moment i'm living in right now is\nshowing me evidence of otherwise so it\nreally is and that's again\nwhy the book is even titled how to do\nthe work\nwe know that our brain is capable of\nincredible change\nwe are gifted with an actual\nneuroplastic body for all i'm concerned\nour brain can change our whole body and\nthe way it functions can change\nhowever we need to do the work we need\nto\npractice the consciousness we need to\nsee how we're coloring all of these old\nnarratives\npast or painting it around over what's\nhappening now\nand begin to do that less begin to do\nthat less before we\ncan begin to even give ourselves the\nopportunity to believe\nsomething new about ourselves and of\ncourse i'm\nspeaking from the other side of like we\ni mentioned earlier peeling back\nlayers of belief really challenging\nmyself and then\ngiving myself the opportunity the gift\nat having a new experience because\nyou'll probably have maybe heard me\nspeak this and i'll speak it right here\nagain\nin my opinion the lived experience\nwisdom is our greatest teacher so\ni can say until i'm blue in the face and\nwrite a book about how do i change\nbeliefs how do i\nyou know show myself that i'm now this\ntransformed human\nand i know how it is to be human and i\nknow that until we do the work of\nwitnessing\nmaybe for for the beginning part of our\njourney how much our past is coloring\nwhat's happening now and then of course\nbeginning to do the work of healing\nwe likely won't believe it so like jenna\nsaid\nas you embark on this journey don't\nanticipate that\nnow if you begin to identify the\nproblematic beliefs in your world don't\nanticipate that they'll go they'll go\naway overnight they absolutely won't\num though they can we can begin to teach\nourselves how to\nlet in new experiences\nand that that wisdom that you speak of\nthat inner wisdom really it\nis just it glows from this book and that\nsame wisdom that nicole is talking about\nis\nis also in each of you it's in each of\nus it actually is connecting us and this\nbook\ngives you access to really kind of\nopening those doors peeling back those\nlayers\nso that you're able to hear your\nintuition you're able to tap into that\nown wisdom\nyourself i know i have a tattoo on my\narm even that is wisdom and that's been\nsomething\nthat maybe to me is just like my heart\nthat's been guiding me all along the way\ni think\nyou'll see that in this book that\neverything all these tools every all the\ncontacts everything that\nis in the book and then gives you tools\nto put into action\nreally is bringing you back to yourself\nand the beautiful thing about that that\nis highlighted so well in the book is\nthat\nyourself is also who you begin with\nyou're not searching for something far\nout there creating something that's not\nin existence\nit's already here within you and this\nbook really is\nkind of if you think of like a giant\nblock statue and you have to chisel it\naway to actually get the work of art\nunderneath\nwe're all sort of these giant blocks of\nclay or whatever\nit is that you want to chisel and going\nthrough these pages\ndoing the work on this journey of\ncontinuous practice\nallows you to begin to chisel that away\nto really meet your true self and to\nmeet the wisdom that is already\ninside of each of us and a great segue\nto and how to do that when you're\nthinking okay well this sounds great how\ndo i actually begin\none big thing you know you hear nicole\ntalk about a lot it's in our work in the\ncircle a lot is\nre-parenting re-parenting the inner\nchild\num so i want to touch just a little bit\nbefore we wrap up\ntowards the end of the book um this is i\nthink chapter 11\nis re-parenting i'm going to read you\nguys the definition of re-parenting\nin the backs from holistic psychology\nterms the practice of relearning\nhow to meet the physical emotional and\nspiritual needs of the inner child\nthrough daily dedicated action um i know\nyou could speak for days on re-parenting\nso i'm\nto segue this to you and then we'll go\ninto the four pillars\nyeah i i love that you're piggybacking\nand your segway was you know really\nhonoring\num the us-ness the fullness that we all\neach\nhave inside of us um very much you know\nvery intentionally when i created that\nself-healer's hashtag\nit was really with the hopes of being a\nliving reminder\nthat we are all whole um so anyone\nlistening that's living maybe in\nrepetitive patterns\nstuckness that's not serving them i am\nmy hope is to be a messenger of hope um\nthat it's not because you're broken\nit's not because something's wrong with\nyou or you have that genetic chip\nthat is unchangeable it's actually again\nas a result of the\nhabits and patterns the environments the\nexperiences\nthat you've accumulated over time though\nwithin each of us there is that\nwhole full well being\nthat we can access that we can find our\nway back\nhome a lot of the reason we're so\ndisconnected\nwhether it's from our physical bodies\nour emotional bodies or our spiritual\nselves\nis a result of what we were taught what\nwas modeled to us\nare very often well-intentioned\ncaregivers\nbest attempts at raising us\nat showing us how to to be human\nessentially\nand we i urge us all to acknowledge the\nhumanness of those that came\nbefore we are only able to teach or\nimpart to others\nthat which we we know ourselves and for\nsome of us\na lot of this is generational um a lot\nof us and our\nour caregivers and our you know our\ngenerations before us\nwere under such insecurity such scarcity\nthat\nphysical survival was all they really\ncould focus on\num obviously circumstances have changed\nfor some of us though not all of us\nthough the point being we are all\nlimited by that which our caregivers\nmodel\nbecause we understand or at least i\nbelieve\nthat everything we learned in childhood\naround how to care for our physical\nbodies our emotional selves our\nspiritual selves\nwas imparted to us by these incomplete\nhumans themselves\nso i talk a lot about the process of\nre-parenting\nwhich is honoring the fact that many of\nus are are living in daily habits\nthat don't serve us that don't serve us\nin our uniqueness\nin our unique physical bodies that even\nthose of us that might feel\nvery similar to our caregivers to our\nfamilies\nthe reality is is that we're all\ndifferent\nand we might not have been raised in\nenvironments that actually supported\nthat uniqueness that's of course\ncompounded by those of us that had\nenvironments where we had\ntrauma or wounding that we are carrying\nwith us\nso as far as i see it in adulthood i\nbelieve\nwe could all use a new process\nof teaching new skills to our adult\nselves\nones that more fully honor my uniqueness\njust like jenna her daily habits and\npatterns might not\nlook exactly like mine because she's a\ndifferent human in a different\nbody so re-parenting really is the daily\ncommitment\nto showing up for ourselves in this new\nway to being conscious to what our needs\nare\nin any and all of those areas and then\nagain\nthrough a very process-based approach\nbecause\nchances are you might not know how to i\nknow i didn't really once i\ndeplaned my spaceship and i dropped into\nthis body i really didn't know how to\ncare\nfor my physical needs emotions were in a\ncompletely different world to me\neven those of you who you know hear me\nspeak of this being a\ndoctor of emotions really didn't\ntranslate to me knowing how to care\nfor my emotional self and i had a lot of\nolder coping skills that i used around\nmy emotions that didn't serve\nme in my relationship so what\nre-parenting is just a pullback focus\nbefore we talk a bit about the pillars\nit's the general process of honoring the\nways in which\nagain our past what we learned in our\npast\nis no longer serving our present and\nthen of course taking those very small\nsteps\nto begin to create newer habits that\nwill better serve\nthe fullness of our adult experience\ni and i love hear you highlight this in\nthe book as well where you\nsay you know we're constantly changing\ntransient creatures which\nas you're talking about even how what's\nunique to you is going to be different\nto what's unique to me\nand what was unique to me yesterday may\nbe slightly different than\nwhat is unique to me today and it is\nreally important i think\nto highlight as you do throughout the\nbook that we all we are creatures we are\nall humans that are constantly evolving\nwe are these transient beings\nwho are continuously evolving and\nchanging and those needs or those\nreparenting needs which we'll go into\nmay also continuously evolve as we go um\nand i emphasize that uniqueness because\nas you say here in the book too\nit is helpful to know that this process\nis different for everyone\nand does not have exact linear steps i\nthink\nyou highlight all throughout the book\nand all throughout your work and our\nteachings that\nyou know this isn't a one-stop shop for\neveryone it's also not a linear path\nit's not going to look the same for\neveryone my healing journey\nis going to look different than nicole's\nhealing journey nicole's healing journey\nis going to look different\nfrom each of you that is out there um so\ni do want to highlight that\ncontinuously as we go that this is a\npractice this is unique to you\nit's not going to look the same as it\ndoes for your neighbor\nand the book specifically like these\ntools that nicole's talking about\nthe four pillars for re-parenting so\nnicole's broken down re-parenting into\nfour pillars which we'll go into\neach of these pillars are also going to\nlook unique and specific to you\nso really this book serves as and all of\nthe tools each of the chapters really as\nguideposts and really as messengers to\nsay you know\nhere's a tool here's kind of this this\nbox without a lid\nwe're not in a closed one but here are\nsome guidelines and some guide posts for\nhow\nhow to help you how to serve you how to\nsupplement your journey\nand then what you choose to do or not do\nwith those is going to look different\nfor everyone which is perfect\nnow the first pillar so there are four\npillars of re-parenting\nthat are broken down in this book the\nfirst pillar of reparenting is emotional\nregulation\nor the skill to successfully navigate\nour emotional states now if you're\nsomeone who's new to emotional\nregulation\nas i think a lot of us as adulthood are\nnew to it um successful emotional\nregulation looks like\nhaving a feeling as we will always have\nas humans i love that you\noffered that reminder jenna of we are\never changing\num and our emotional states are ever\nchanging\nwe don't just have a baseline where we\njust feel\none kind of way all the time like i said\nearlier our emotions\nactually contain messages for us we want\nto continue to\nfeel about life so what\nsuccessful emotional regulation looks\nlike is having the feels about life\nagain our goal isn't to be emotionless\nwe're definitely going to be reactive to\nthings that happen to us in our given\nenvironments\nhowever our goal is to return to a\nbaseline to have the feeling\nand then to go back from having the\nfeeling you'll see in the book i talk\nabout\nmotions lasting 90 seconds so many of us\nas adults so i was joking when i said\nmany of us don't have that flexibility\nmany more of us are getting stuck in our\nemotions or all we know\nis either flatness because maybe you're\ndissociated like i am so you're so\ndisconnected that it feels like you have\nno emotions\nor maybe you're really just intimately\nfamiliar with one emotion you're caught\nin a stress cycle\nor you're caught in a sadness cycle\nagain the goal\nis to have the feelings and then to\nreturn\nback to baseline a large reason again\nwhy we don't have those tools\nis because of what was modeled to us\nbecause perhaps many of us\nwere in environments that were way too\noverwhelming\nso we did what we all do we adapt we\nfind the way to make\nlife as tolerable or as bearable as\npossible\nyet we don't maybe develop the more\ncomplete set of tools\nwith how to navigate our emotions so\nagain the goal for emotional regulation\nis to have my feelings whatever they\nmight be\nhonoring also that they might be\ndifferent jen and i could live a moment\nand i could have a reaction emotionally\nthat she doesn't have\nin that moment the next goal is to offer\nthose around us our relationships the\nspace\nto have their own feelings to express\nthemselves\nand then obviously the safety to return\nback to their baseline so the gift we\nwant to give the\nour relationships not only is our\nemotions um\nbeing vulnerable being honest like i\nshared earlier i'm still working on how\nto\nexpress in emotions how to allow others\nto hold space\nfor my emotional states and then the\ngift we give our relationships is by\ndoing the same\nby allowing other people to express by\nme holding space for jenna when she does\nhave a reaction to something that\nmight not bother me and to allow her\nthat\nroom to express and then like i said\nreturn\nback to safety so while it's not linear\nthere are many tools in the book with\nhow to get started\num how to begin to learn how to navigate\nour emotional world\nbecause i think it's pretty safe to say\nmany of us are functioning in our\nrelationships not having that\nflexibility not\neither being connected to our own\nemotions um or not feeling safe around\nothers when they're having their own\nemotions\nand something just to note here too as\nnicole is talking about or even using us\nas an example it's not always comfy it's\nstill even on a daily basis i sometimes\nwill still struggle to allow nicole to\nhold space for my emotions or if\nif i'm going through a reaction this\nhappened i'm human\nso i will get reactive to some things i\nwill get stuck in\nan emotional cycle and nicole is very\nwonderful at holding that space and i\nnotice how\nuncomfortable it is for me to allow\nanother person to hold that space\nbecause i'd rather go through my cycle\nthat's what\ni'm programmed to do i'd rather stay\nstuck in that so it also\nis it feels a bit exposing or it can\nfeel a bit exposing and uncomfortable\nto allow someone else to hold that space\nfor you as you do begin to regulate your\nown emotions\nalso being the one holding that space\nonce you're able to allow\nanother person to do that if i'm able to\nallow nicole\nto hold space for me if i'm able to put\nmyself sort of in that\nexposed i feel like i'm naked in front\nof a crowd and feeling really seen\nonce i'm able to do that and sit through\nthose uncomfortable feelings\ni know then i'm also able to hold that\nspace for nicole and for those around me\nso it does first take\nme being able to do it myself before i'm\nthen able to do it for others so again\nit's this building block of this theme\nof always going back\nto self going back to you as your\njourney really truly does\nstart with you re-parenting is going to\nstart with you and re-parenting\nyour inner child the second pillar of\nre-parenting i'm looking at the clock\nbecause we could really talk about this\nall day\nbut i do want to go through the second\nthird and fourth pillar since we've\nalready started this so the second\npillar of re-parenting in this book is\nloving discipline this pillar involves\ncreating boundaries with ourselves that\nare maintained\nover time yes so loving discipline\nreally again applies to\nany of those three areas around\nself-care of our physical bodies\naround our emotional resources knowing\nwhen we're tapped out when i can hold\nspace for someone else or when i can't\nand again holding space for our own\nselves\nspiritually building in the practices\nthat allow me to reconnect so what\nloving discipline is\nis the not only setting of the intention\nto create those spaces\num those moments of reconnection for\nmyself but holding myself\nto it um knowing right because a lot of\nus and i'll speak\nfor myself be the first one included is\ni got\nso good at not acknowledging my needs i\ngot so good at looking about how i\nneeded to show up\nfor everyone else in my life that\nholding myself\nin that space and keeping those\nintentions and\npracticing that loving discipline where\ni acknowledge that no i have needs\nand that i needed to work through the\ndiscomfort of honoring\nthose needs was an act of loving\ndiscipline so\nfor many of us we can maybe take the\nother road we cannot be loving we can be\nour own worst critics we can hold\nourselves to almost tyrannical standards\num so the the suggestion here is really\nto cultivate the loving aspect the\ncompassion\num acknowledging and honoring the\nmoments where we don't show up for\nourselves as we're not always going to\nthough very gently and compassionately\nbeginning to allow\nour needs to factor in so again it's\nvery individual in terms of some of us\nmight\nwant to really get started on the\nphysical needs of the self\nand practice some compassionate loving\ndiscipline around\ncaring in those areas and others might\ndive into the more emotional needs\nthough loving discipline is the act\nof holding ourselves accountable of\nacknowledging that we all have needs\nand that it's okay and it's safe to\nbegin to honor them\nin our relationships or in our\nenvironments\ni love that and i think it's important\nto note when we're talking about loving\ndiscipline too it's not morality it's\nnot good or bad\nlike nicole's saying really holding\nspace for that love and compassion\nfor yourself is non-judgmental or if\nthat judgment of yourself\ndoes come not judging the fact that\nyou're judging yourself\nand just allowing it to come and\nallowing it to float away\nthis takes us to the third pillar of\nreparenting now the third pillar of\nre-parenting goes hand in hand with\nloving discipline\nthis is self-care yeah so these are the\nactions then of creating new habits and\npatterns\nbeing honest um in the areas where we're\nnot showing up for ourselves in the ways\nthat we need\ni know for me it was getting really\nhonest around how much am i sleeping how\nmuch\nam i building in moments to de-stress or\nto decompress\nthe answer in both of those areas was\nnot much at all\nand then of course it's beginning to\nactually create the new actions the new\nplans\nmaking the bedtime a priority hitting\npause before i jump into work first\nthing in the morning and for me\nthe morning hours were really sacred um\nbuilding a boundary around that so that\nwithin those hours i can begin\nwhatever the practices that resonated so\nfor me it was\nbuilding consciousness into my day and\nthen it was building the moment of\nturning inward and\ntrying to rediscover that intuitive\nspace\nand what it was saying throughout the\nday so the actioning of self-care\nis incredibly important again it looks\ndifferent depending on where we are in\nthe journey\ni definitely don't suggest you adding\nfive things to that to-do list of\nself-care you'll hear me go back in the\nbook\nto the concept of small daily promise\ntime and time again\nit's building a new promise in one area\nof self-care\ngoing to bed five minutes earlier not\nfive hours earlier\nreally beginning to create change in\nsmall ways\nbecause what we want in this area of\nself-care isn't white-knuckling it where\ni can maybe do this you know new\nthing one time for maybe the next three\nweeks and then life crashes around me\nand i can't maintain it\nwhat we want to do is to integrate these\ninto what we do\nso now two years later two three years\nlater i have a morning routine i just\nget up\nat an early time i didn't come by that\novernight\ni practiced keeping promises so that i\ncould create these spaces so\nagain the suggestion is don't expect\nlife to look different\nnow that you've listened to this talk or\nnow that you've purchased this book\nlife will not look different tomorrow um\nthough we can set ourselves up to\nsucceed because what we're interested in\nis the longevity of these promises so\npicking one area that you could use a\nbit of better self-care\nand practice keeping that promise for at\nleast 30 days just that one promise\nbefore you build in another promise in\nterms of self-care\nit's building that muscle\nnow the fourth pillar of repairing also\nwhat nicole's talking about i just want\nto highlight in the back\nso of this re-parenting chapter we will\ngo into the fourth pillar\num really quick but these if the things\nthat nicole's suggesting or if you want\nsuggestions on how to really\nimplement these things each of those\nfour pillars in the back in\nwith these action steps is broken down\nwith suggestions there's space for you\nto also get curious and\ncreate what you could implement in your\nday and there again\nthis book is a guidepost it serves as a\nguide there is guidance here for each of\nthese pillars that\nnicole is speaking about so that you're\nnot just left with oh that sounded great\nnicole i read the book okay what do i do\nthis actually is a guide as if there is\na teacher next to you really\nkind of taking you along the way\nallowing you and empowering you to\nactually be your own best teacher\num and with that we'll go into the\nfourth pillar of reparenting the fourth\npillar\none of the ultimate goals of the work\nis to rediscover our childlike sense of\nwonder\nyeah so listeners out there might wonder\nif i lost my mind you know kind of\noffering that we all have this very\nchildlike place inside of us\neven as adults and i'm here to say that\nwe do\num wonder aw being present\nin the moment is actually a\nconsciousness state\nsome of you might have heard to a\nconcept called flow\nessentially it's being here for it\nhashtag if you will\num and that actually like i said is a\nconsciousness state\num that uh we are able to allow the\nmoment\nin the wonder that is in the moment in\nwhen we feel\nsafe when we feel grounded in our bodies\nwhen our needs are met are you sensing\nthe theme here of what we're building\ntoward\nright when i have foundational practices\nwhere i feel whole and\ncared for and integrated i now can feel\nsafe to be and when i am just being\nas we talked about earlier so many of us\nare focused on doing on checking the\nboxes on\nfinding the thing outside and stuffing\nit inside\nwhen we can just be we can be in receipt\nand reception of the moment\nand that's actually a very beautiful\nplace to be we can then\nallow in all that is life all of the\nfeelings\nall of the relationships we can remain\nconnected to our purpose\nand then begin to live in purpose and in\naction\ni believe the work that is probably\ndrawing most of you here\nis that desire to either find that\npurpose or find that connectivity\nwhether it's to the perp to your purpose\nor to other humans\nor to the collective or to life itself\nand the way back is by doing the work by\nbeing foundationally grounded to your\nwhole\nself and when you are when you're safe\nin your body when you're meeting your\nbody's needs when you're meeting your\nemotional needs\nand when you're in connection to that\nspirit or that essence\nyou're in that state of wonder you are\nin receipt of whatever is available to\nyou in that moment\nand you're in the position you're in the\nembodiment of your self-expression\nand in my opinion that's that's why\nwe're here we're all here to do the work\nof healing\nto do the work of changing not only\nourselves but\ni mean this might sound a pretty grand\nyou know idea but\nchanging the world around us and it is\nthrough being in that childlike state of\nwonder\nwe don't lose access to it life is here\nin this moment\nand the more of us that can embody this\nmoment fully\nand then create the space for everyone\naround us to embody their true selves\nthat is in my opinion how we create the\nchange that we're all looking for\ni obviously will echo that\nentirely it can sound very broad to say\noh well you know you're out changing the\nworld and\nyou actually are everyone who's\nlistening nicole being here am i being\nhere behind the scenes here\neach of us doing that first with\nourselves us being able to come home to\nourselves and that self-expression i\nknow nicole\nused the term you know our purpose\neveryone's searching for their purpose\nand it becomes a very stern like what's\nmy purpose\nand it's really important here\nespecially in this reparenting section\nthis fourth pillar is really beautiful\nthat\ncoming back to that childlike wonder is\nactually just coming back to your true\nself-expression which\ndoes it is a dynamic of spontaneity of\njoy of imagination of playfulness\npurpose is your connection as your your\ntrue self and your self-expression\nwhich is play and when you're able to to\nbe\nand to be present in that childlike\nwonder\nin that playfulness and authentic\nself-expression\nthat in itself is what ripples out and\nchanges the world\nthe world is not going to change if each\nof the individuals\nin the world stay stagnant and do\nnothing to evolve or\ntransform which thankfully just by\nnature of us living and breathing\nwe are doing every day as you said\nbeautifully in the book we are transient\ncreatures who every moment every breath\nevery second of the day\nare constantly evolving yeah such a\nbeautiful\ni think place to end and reminder and\njust like i said i want to honor each\nand every one of you\nwho are curious about what for many of\nus is new information\num i do think that in terms of that\ngrand scale i do think that we all\nare all here um to do something bigger\nand\ni i know that we can love hate all the\ntechnology that surrounds us these days\nthough what i know one by-product of\nthat for so many of us is the ability to\nlive in purpose\nwe don't have we're not stuck in the\nsystems necessarily as we\nonce were there's new systems being\ncreated around each of us\nand new tools to create new systems\nwhere they don't yet occur\nso again when i talk at scale like this\nof changing the world\ni really am connected to that as being\nthe purpose because\nwhen we live in purpose one of your\nbeautiful analogies jenna that i always\nlike to share\nis um the puzzle piece when we are\nliving in ourselves\nin our fullness we are living in our\npurpose even if that is\nwhatever that means in life that could\nbe the scale that i'm living with my\nimmediate family it doesn't have to be\nof course blasting to millions of people\nas\njenna and i are right now purpose\nripples out\nand there's so many ways that so many of\nus are living in purpose and we don't\neven realize it\nand there are so many more ways we can\nbegin to live in purpose\num again using these tools just by\nembodying who we\nare and allowing that to be enough in\nand of itself so\ni believe that work that we're doing\nhere each and every day is\num the scale of changing of changing\nourselves\nand thereby changing all of the\nrelationships and the world around us so\nagain i want to honor each and every one\nof you for taking the time\nfor jumping on this event for grabbing\nthe book\nfor engaging your curiosity around\naround some of this information\ni honor each and every one of you and\nlike i said i'm i'm here right with you\ni know jenna's here right with you and\nwe're all we're walking the same journey\nand now\nwe're doing it together i think that's\none of the most beautiful byproducts um\nof this community when i thanked\neveryone\nfor your role in shaping this book and\nhelping this book become a co-creation i\ni mean that in my heart\nit's through the safety that i\ncontinuously feel of being able to\nself-express in this way\nknowing that i have humans that honor me\nand\nand have and hold that space for me to\nallow me to share\nmy thoughts and my opinions and my\nbeliefs and my journey\num i am indebted to each and every one\nof you because it's through that safety\nthat i didn't have\nin my past relationships that continues\nto allow me to embody this work and to\nshare it with each and every one of you\nhey are we still alive yes yeah we're\nstill alive i'm just getting\na book because i know that we have a\nhere is the book\ni wanna we do have a book to give away\nand for those of you whether you have\nthe book already or you don't know the\nbook\num this nicole like you're saying really\ni know we got into this theme of\nchanging the world and i think\njust i want to illuminate again by\nnature of us all being here\nwe are each changing the world right\nthis second whether we\nwhether we want to or not whether we're\ndoing it consciously or not\nand for someone who's already on a\nhealing journey or embarking on one or\njust\nhas sheer curiosity this book really is\nan\nopen door to giving someone access to\nconsciously\nchoose and to have the tools to learn\nhow to consciously choose\nhow you in fact want to impact yourself\nand your life\nso that you're actually making a\nconscious choice in the transformation\nof the world because it is happening\naround us\nwhether we're aware of it or not um and\nas much as we love this book we also\nhave been
