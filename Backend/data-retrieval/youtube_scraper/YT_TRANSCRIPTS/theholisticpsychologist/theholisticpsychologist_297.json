    "transcript": "hi everyone dr nicole lepere the\nholistic psychologist here\nhere actually to talk about a very\npersonal\ntopic to myself which is co-dependency\nin relationships\nso those of you who followed my work or\nany version of me sharing my personal\nhistory and story\nprobably know by now that i talk a lot\nabout a really conditioned pattern of\ncodependency\nin myself you know via vis-a-vis my\nfamily that i really\nhad to break essentially and learn how\nto operate\nnew in relationships so talking about\nthis\nis really helpful i think for a lot of\nus because i'm i know i'm not alone\ni'm in these codependent patterns and\nthere's a lot of ways that it shows up\nin relationships so\ni want to talk about a few of those ways\ntoday anyone out there listening i know\nsome of you have\nheard this word and are definitely like\nyes this is me and\nfor a lot of us this is a newer word on\nthis concept of codependency\nso the way i define codependency is\ncodependency\nis really rooted in consistent that's an\nimportant word here\nconsistent choices right directed at or\nresulting in\nis a better word the neglect of self the\nneglect of our physical self\nthe physical needs of our body our\nemotional self\nor our spiritual self for most of us\nthese conditioned habits and patterns\naround conditioning\noriginate in our very early life\nexperiences typically in childhood\nso in childhood when we come to this\nplanet however it is you believe we get\nhere\nwe are in a state of complete dependency\nmeaning we cannot meet our needs on our\nown so we are dependent to the humans\naround us and again we've all grown up\nin different\nfamily environments with different\npeople around so essentially we're\ncompletely dependent on\nwhomever the caregivers are around us\nagain to meet our physical or emotional\nand our spiritual needs\nso from that state of dependency we are\nvery adaptive\nmeaning we learn through being in\nrelationship with these people how\nattuned or not attuned they are to those\ndiffering needs\nand then what happens is we\nkind of internalize what we saw\nmodeled to us so we're watching our\nparents take care of their physical\nneeds we're\nabsorbing how they help us meet our own\nphysical needs same thing with emotional\nsame thing with spiritual\nand then we tend to internalize\nessentially those same habits and\npatterns\nand a lot of us what we internalize and\nthen repeat into adulthood again is that\nneglect\njust put it really simply it like looks\nand feels and you'll see when we go\nthrough each of these\nof like an other focus right where i'm\nfocusing my time my attention my choices\nmy feelings\non things or people usually codependency\noften happens in relationships outside\nof ourself\nso what does it actually look like what\nare some markers that we might have that\ncodependent conditioning\nif you find yourself having an obsessive\nfocus on your partner's behaviors this\ncould be your friends your family\nmembers\nif you're always kind of focused on what\nsomeone else is doing\nright as opposed obviously to you this\nis consistently\nit's not the time over here where you\nknow i know my sister's struggling so\ni'm a little more thinking about her\nthis is if consistently i'm always kind\nof focusing on what everyone else is\ndoing\nnot really focusing on what i'm doing so\ni just want to kind of reiterate this in\neach of these we're talking about kind\nof a consistent pattern\nthis isn't the one-offs contextually\nwhere it is actually maybe the choice i\nwant to make\nthat's what conditioning is when i'm\nkind of habitual about these choices\njust to make that clear\nso if i'm habitually always focused on\nsomeone else\nthen it might be a marker that i'm\noperating with that codependency pattern\nsimilarly if i find myself habitually\ntrying to\ncontrol change or fix usually these two\ngo together the more i focus on people\noutside of me i can diagnose what they\nneed to do differently and then i\ntypically\nattempt to affect that change\ninterestingly so what what is driving\nboth of these just so we're\nunderstanding why this is codependency\nit's\ndriving this idea right that they're\nanyone else's choices outside of me\nwhat they're doing or not doing\nobviously i want to tweak those and the\nsecond version\nthat they're reflecting on me in some\nway\nthat's that kind of example of\ncodependency that what you're doing\npartner\nhas some reflection on me there's not\nthat separation so\nunderstandably if i change or help you\nchange what you're doing\ni get to feel differently in whatever\ncontext that is so just to make clear\nkind of what's going on behind this\nor deeper in both of these and that's\nwhy it's kind of codependent\nmy focus on someone else has some\nmeaning for me\nwhat we want to cultivate of course is\nthat separation where i can allow\nother people to behave as they will\nobviously within limits if i need to\nset a boundary for myself that's a\ndifferent conversation\nbut i'm not trying to change people to\naffect change\nindirectly through me i may be showing\nup differently and affecting change on\nthem\nanother marker of codependency in\nrelationships is\nenabling harmful behaviors or lacking\nboundaries entirely\nso if you find yourself as being someone\nwho's always kind of like okaying\nthings that deep down you know maybe\naren't okay for you\nthat friend calling you at all hours of\nthe night you know when i say harmful\nthat's harmful to your\nsleep yet you can't seem to find the way\nto put up the boundary by not answering\nor by telling the friend that you'll\nno longer answer those late night calls\nso harm doesn't mean i think\ntraditionally what we typically think of\nlike i'm physically harming myself\nwe might be emotionally exhausting\nmyself by not having boundaries in that\nfriend calling example\nagain pattern do i always find myself\nallowing anyone to kind of be as they\nare around me\nto my own detriment or disservice and\nfurthermore if i've heard of boundaries\nand limits do i struggle\nto keep them or enact them another\nmarker of codependency\nis if separation the experience of it or\neven the\nthought of it brings up anxiety or\nbrings up fears of abandonment\ni very much can resonate with this one\nfor a very long time\nnot having a response text back or not\nhaving my partner available on the other\nend of the phone\nor even my partner wanting to travel or\nbe separate from me\nat my core again because of that\ncodependency right because\nthat separation feels threatening i feel\nfearful\nand i operated with that anxiety a lot\nand so for me\nhow that expressed i would try to kind\nof reach out and grab the person so\nyou're not answering me\ni'm going to text you i'm going to\nbecome angry i'm going to chase you\nto relieve that fear of abandonment or\nthat anxiety\nso again consistently if you find\nyourself struggling with distance\nphysical emotional relationships if it's\nhard for you to\nyou know kind of give partners or\nfriends space or to go and be\nor being a different emotion than you\nare any\nsort of separation because separation\nemotional separation feels like\nseparation\ni still see while i'm very much more\ntolerant of actual space between my\npartner lolly and i now\nthe thing i find myself struggling about\nis emotional separation\nwhen very naturally understandably we're\nin different mood states in any given\nday we're different humans we have\ndifferent hormones some days i'm in a\nyou know positive high vibe state and\nshe's not\nthat separation can bring up a little\nanxiety\nbecause old codependent me from my\nfamily this was the environment i was\nraised in\nwe all shared the same feeling when one\nperson was stressed we were all stressed\nso that to me\nfelt like a emotional connection i now\nrealize it isn't\nit's kind of superficial and artificial\nso what actual emotional connection\nis for me now means allowing us to be in\ndifferent emotional states\nand still feel togetherness that's just\nanother example that just came to mind\naround emotional separation that isn't\nas clear i think a lot of us can say oh\nyeah\nbeing alone is hard for me so i\ndefinitely know i'm a little bit\ncodependent\na lot of us aren't able to really\nidentify the emotional piece and\nsometimes that's what it looks like when\nyou struggle to hold space\nfor someone feeling differently than you\ndo for whatever reason\nin any given moment a final marker\nagain this kind of sums it up anytime\nconsistently\nwe betray ourselves or our own needs in\norder to be chosen\nsometimes we're conscious of this where\ni know that someone i love and care\nabout has this need and i have the\ndiffering need in that moment\nright sometimes i'm consciously saying\nokay i'll put this person first and\nsometimes it's unconscious\nthis isn't the one-off context where you\nknow i've determined that in this\nsituation\ni can hold off on what i need to show up\nfor someone i care about\nthis is when it's consistent i just want\nto continue to kind of hammer that in\nso when consistently the other person\nalways wins\nright when i always see my need or maybe\ni don't even know what my need is\nmaybe i don't even know to ask myself\nmaybe i'm always just deferring to\nanyone else's needs so\nagain when this habit is consistent when\ni don't even\nacknowledge or check in with what my\nneed is and or when i do\nand i always pick someone else chances\nare you might have this codependent\nconditioning\nso i hope this was helpful i think\nthere's a lot of ways this\npatterning can show up again it\noriginates very early on\nit becomes the patterned way we relate\nto others\nand as all patterns it can be broken so\nthe first step to creating change\nis to create awareness to become\nconscious to whether or not you are\nsomeone\nwho sees this codependent patterning who\nwitnesses it\nin your current relationships so take\nnote\nobserve yourself it could be all of your\nrelationships\nyou know you see these these markers it\ncould be a certain type of relationship\nsome of us operate differently in our\nprofessional world versus our personal\nworld some of us operate differently\nwith family versus with friends\nsome of us don't some of us are very\nhabitual\nin all of the ways so again the first\nstep to change is to create awareness\nnotice notice if you like me have this\ndeep rooted\ncodependent patterning\nyou"
