    "transcript": "hi everyone dr nicole lepere the\nholistic psychologist here\nas always thank you to each and every\none of my subscribers those of you who\nare not yet subscribed\nif you like this video and you feel\nthere's value please hit subscribe at\nthe end\nso today i want to talk about social\nmedia and social media\nboundaries because i obviously those of\nyou who follow me on social media\nknow that i'm on there pretty much every\nday is really the main platform where i\nput out this content\nand i come to realize that i have to be\nvery aware of my relationship with\nsocial media\nbecause i'm sure like many listeners it\nreally does affect us\nthe reality of the internet is it is a\nreality\nas far as i see it it's not going away\nhowever it's a new reality\nfor all of us humans we're not yet used\nto living with the virtual world\never present ever accessible so we don't\nyet really know\nwhat the long-term effects could be\ni know that there are effects that i\nsuffer\nor i experience based on my social media\nuse\nso i want to talk a little bit when i\nsay social media boundaries\ni'm talking about personal boundaries\nright how do i\nrelate and engage with social media so\nthings to\nkeep in mind or be aware of for\nourselves and our relationship with\nsocial media that would be really\nhelpful\nis taking a social media inventory what\ndoes that mean\nwriting down the content that you're\nconsuming what are the major\nthemes back in the day we didn't have as\nmuch\nchoice the news ran a story we got one\nversion of the events\nand until the news ran another story on\nthat particular event\nthat's the only information that we\nreally had available to us\nnow we could hear the news story on\nevent go online\nread all the experiences of the event\nread all of the opinions about the event\nyou get the picture we can fully immerse\nourselves now\nin information per topic\nso what am i talking about when i say\ntake a social media inventory\na lot of us right are focusing because\nit's maybe an area of interest maybe\nit's an area of concern\non particular topics so we might become\nonly focused on that one aspect of our\nlife\nwhy am i talking about this if i'm\nviewing content on social media the more\ni view it\nthe more i become stuck in that one way\nof perceiving the world\nand before i know it when i go out into\nthe world\ni'm stuck in that same way so it would\nbe really helpful to take that inventory\nto assess what are the topics that\nyou're spending your most time\nconsuming and furthermore are you only\nviewing the topic through one lens or\nare you maybe\nresearching other perceptions in that\none area\nthe more focused we are the more stuck\nwe can become\nin our virtual life and in our real life\noutside of our virtual landscape\nnumber two really helpful if we begin to\nnotice how consuming these\nmessages makes you feel impacts your\nrelationships\nimpacts what you think about for me\nright if i\ntend to view particularly negative\ncontent online or stressful content\nonline\ni notice the effect i feel the stress i\nfeel the negativity\ni carry that with me and then even\nthough i put maybe the phone down\ni'm now still stuck in that feeling\nstate and personally for me i know that\nimpacts me that impacts my emotions that\nimpacts how i feel about myself\ni could often bring that into my\npartnership and like i said earlier i\ncan bring that then carry what happened\nonline\nout into the world and then i remain\nstuck in that experience\nso when you're doing your inventory also\ncheck\nin check into how each of these content\nareas\nmakes you feel and observe if there is\nany of that residual\ntakeaway that you're carrying with you\nonce you've closed down that social\nmedia page\nlikely the answer will be yes another\nstep that would be really helpful\nnotice how and when even you're reaching\nfor your phone\nfor me when i'm sitting when i have\nnowhere else to put my attention and\ndefinitely when i'm feeling agitated\ninside\nmy go-to is my phone oh let me see\nwhat's happening on all my accounts let\nme check my email\nlet me put my attention somewhere else\nso notice how often you're doing that\nanother byproduct of the social media\nuse\nis the dopamine that hit that we can get\nfrom that stimulation immediately\nand a lot of us are using that to\ndistract to move away\nfrom either what's actively present in\nour current environment\nor maybe internally present in our\nemotional world\nso notice notice how often notice\nwhen you're picking up your phone notice\nhow many hours you're spending on it\ni mean now apps like instagram tell you\nthis might be surprising i know at times\ni don't think i'm on as much as i\nam and when i see that that reading it's\nwell beyond what i anticipated so just\ndo an assessment\nsee how long log the hours that you're\naccumulating online it might be\nsurprising you might be spending well\nmore time\nthan you're aware of which leads us to\nanother step if you do\ncome to the inclusion that you're\nspending more time than you would like\non social media\nit might be helpful to designate times\nwhere you're social media free\nor maybe phone free so for instance\nthis weekend i was at the beach and i\ndecided not even to bring my phone\nthat way i wasn't tempted to fill my\ndead time my down time\nwith looking at the phone sometimes it\ncan be helpful\nto do that with a partner to do that\nwith whomever we're doing the event with\nso hey\nfriend we're going to go on a hike can\nwe both agree to keep our phones in the\ncar\nand then we can check in when we get\nback\nbringing me to the final point if you do\ntake the break from social media\nnotice how you feel notice if there's\nany changes\nin the way you're thinking and the way\nyou're feeling and in the way you're\nbehaving in the world\nfor me i notice a big difference i can\nfeel much more grounded\nin the world outside of social media\nright so wrapping this all full circle\nnotice what you're consuming online\nright notice how what you're consuming\nmakes you feel\nand then what you're carrying with you\ninto the real world\na lot of us are replicating what we're\ndoing online\nin our external physical environments\nnotice how long we're spending put those\nbreaks elicit the support of friends if\nwe need to\nand as we take the breaks notice how we\nfeel\nfor me i can feel so much more grounded\nmy world can feel so much more expansive\nwhen i'm in it\nsocial media can really make us feel\nsmall and stuck\ni hope this video was helpful i know i'm\nalways evaluating my boundaries and on\nmy social media use\nand it really really really is\nbeneficial because we really don't know\nwhat the long-term effects are going to\nbe of constant consumption\nin this way\nyou"
