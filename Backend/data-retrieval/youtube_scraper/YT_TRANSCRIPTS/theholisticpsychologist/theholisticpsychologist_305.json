    "transcript": "hi everyone dr nicola pera the holistic\npsychologist here\ntoday's video we are going to talk about\nsomething i talk about\nquite frequently which is what i call\nthe trauma body trauma is not just as\nmany of us think of a mental or a\nemotional event and it definitely isn't\nsomething that only exists\nat the time when we experienced the\ntrauma\nmany of us carry trauma with us\ninto our daily into our future\nin our bodies trauma remains\nstuck in our bodies and actually for a\nlot of us\ncauses physiological symptoms what are\nsome of the symptoms\nheadaches i know i if i could have\nbought stock\nin the headache medicine etc i would\nhave\ni lived with it in my bag from my school\nbag to my work bag\nas long as i can remember i always\nhad a headache so chronic headaches a\nlot of times\ncan be the effects the residual effect\nin our body\nof that stored trauma sweaty palms\nright a lot of us can maybe feel just\nkind of\nmoist and sweaty racing heart anytime\nour heart rate is just\ngenerally elevated a lot of us that are\ncarrying trauma\nhave a higher resting blood pressure in\ngeneral\nand or we can feel our heart rate spike\nthroughout the day we don't feel that\ncalmness in our in our heart muscle\nanother thing and i definitely suffered\nwith this is hunched posture you can\neven still tell\ni have a little bit of a slouch i\nremember growing up\nmy mom would always say to me stand up\nstraight\nso for me this slouch began\nat a very young age and remains i make\nit a daily practice to try and\nbrighten my posture another way trauma\ncan ex\nwe can experience trauma in our bodies\nis with consistent\nstomach pain stomach issues digestive\nproblems\neverything from ibs to constipation\nit can really affect the way we process\nor don't process\nour food so a lot of us\ncontinue to live under these chronic\nsymptoms\nbecause we're carrying that trauma that\nstuckness the stuck\nenergy in our physical bodies\nso how do we heal we have to begin to\nrebuild the connection\nthat probably was severed from most of\nus between our mind and our body\nas a protection mechanism we begin to\nsever that connection to keep ourselves\nsafe when the trauma happens\nand then many of us remain living in\nthat disconnect\nthose of you who follow my work know i\ntalk a lot about my spaceship\nthat's where i live the majority of my\nlife disconnected from my physical body\nunaware that those symptoms that i just\ndescribed to you that i was experiencing\nunaware that they were happening a lot\nand or unaware of what was really\ncausing them i thought that's just how\nmy body was\ni didn't understand that that was the\nresult of this\ntrauma so we want to begin to reconnect\nthe mind and the body\nso that we can get more in tuned with\nour bodies energy and sensations\nand then begin to practice releasing\nthis stored trauma\nso how do we do this through stretching\ngentle stretching gentle yoga right you\ndon't have to go into\nbuy the the fancy yoga class there's\nmany free videos i happen to love yoga\nwith adrien i think she's a great\nbeginner she has short practices maybe\nthis isn't even yoga\nmaybe you're just stretching learning\nhow to be in our body\nfocusing our attention in our body when\nwe're stretching how does it feel\nright to touch our toes how does it feel\nin our body you might not know it first\nso this is a practice when we're moving\nour body through stretching or gentle\nyoga\npaying attention to the sensations and\nthe changes in sensations\nas we engage in that movement hand\nenergy technique\ni did a video on this i'll make sure\nthat we link it below\nthis is a practice of tuning into the\nenergy\na lot of us can begin to feel energy as\nit moves through our body\nit might feel like tingling right it\nmight feel like a lightness like a\nbutterfly sensation\ni know for me because i've practiced i\ncan feel it mostly in my legs and in my\nfingers\nso check out my video learning how to\nsit with ourself\nand tune into the energy that's always\npresent in our bodies\nagain it might not be apparent to you at\nfirst\nbut as you begin to practice and sit\nwith yourself and learn your body's\nenergy fields\nyou'll begin to understand how your\nenergy shows\nup and how it shifts and changes another\nway is\na lean over right just touching our toes\nthis is really helpful not only is it\nstretching\nit's actually shifting the way that our\nblood is flowing\nand then notice the theme here with all\nof these steps is to notice don't just\nfling your body over and i'm done\nreally feel i have the tightest\nhamstrings\nso when i stretch i feel it i feel the\ntightness i feel it move a little bit\ni can feel those sensations and use that\nas the hook\nto keep my attention in my body because\nwhile we're doing these things\nour monkey mind is trying to pull our\nattention to everything else\nso using those sensations of the deep\nstretch and then how do you feel when\nyou\ninvert yourself back up and all of the\nblood goes flowing back down\nyou might feel the energy shift that we\nwere talking about earlier\nanother thing if you guys follow me you\nknow i go on and on and on about\nlearning how to practice deep belly\nbreathing\nwhen we learn how to breathe down from\nour bellies and not shallow in our chest\nwe're learning a new relationship with\nour nervous system\nour calming nervous system those of us\nthat are living in a trauma body\nwe're probably living in an\nover-activated fight-or-flight nervous\nsystem\nour body's always turned on so the\nsimple practice\nof belly breaths can go a long way\nto redistribute that energy and to bring\nour body toward\ncalm using our nervous system\nthe beautiful part of each of these\npractices is they're what i call\nportable\nwe can do them anywhere we could do them\nin the middle of the day when i'm having\na stressful work experience or i'm\nhaving an argument with my partner\ni can excuse myself to the bathroom or\nthe back room\ncheck in with my energy maybe gently\nstretch if i'm feeling tension for me i\nknow\ni can always stretch the tension out of\nmy neck right if i can stretch some\ntension\nand maybe i want to deploy some deep\nbelly breaths to calm myself before i\nre-enter\nthe stressful situation as always\nremember that this is a practice those\nof us that are living stuck in the\ntrauma body\nthis doesn't happen overnight it takes a\nlong time to rebuild that connection\nwith our body so we can get clarity on\nhow does our energy feel how do our\nsensations feel what's going on in here\nso as you begin to practice if it's\ndifficult if it's uncomfortable and if\nyou're just not sure what you're feeling\nthat's okay\nthis is new cultivating this\nrelationship with our body can allow\nus to begin to release some of this\ntension\nto begin to move us back into that\nparasympathetic balance state\nand to give us an opportunity to create\nnew experiences\noutside of the loop that many of us are\nstuck in because of our\nbody i hope you found this helpful\ni know for me living in a trauma body\nstill healing my trauma body\nthis practice goes an incredibly long\nway\nit really does build in the foundational\nbalance upon which\nall deeper level healing can occur"
