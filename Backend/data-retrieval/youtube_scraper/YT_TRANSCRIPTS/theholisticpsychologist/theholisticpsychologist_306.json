    "transcript": "today's video is on how to deal with\nconflicts in relationships\ni get asked a lot of questions about\nconflict in general\nhow to navigate conflict in all types of\nrelationships\nin our friendships and our family\nrelationships and our romantic partners\nso i thought this video would be helpful\nto clear up some things and also to give\nsome\noverall helpful tips with how to\nnavigate conflict in our lives\nso the first thing that i really think\nis important i really want to emphasize\nfor all of us\nis that the presence of conflict doesn't\nmean that there's something wrong\nit's actually quite normal it's human we\ncome into our relationships with many\ndifferent perspectives many different\npoints of view\nmany different lived experiences that\ncause us to often\nhave opposing moments in time where i\nthink one thing\nwhomever thinks another i'm having\nemotional experience and\nthey're having something different or\nwe're just at odds on whatever the thing\nis happening in our world\nso i really want to emphasize that\nbecause i know many of us myself\nincluded\nit's a long time where i thought because\ni was not used to a family that engaged\nregularly in conflict\nwe didn't talk about things that were\nhard so there wasn't those blow ups so i\nnever\nsaw that so when i would find myself in\nconflict in my relationships i very\nnaturally\nunderstood that as meaning something was\nwrong because i wasn't\nused to i wasn't modeled the very\nnatural experience of conflicts that get\nresolved\nthat is a normal human experience so i\nwant to emphasize that\nso it doesn't mean there's something\nwrong and it's natural and normal and\neven could provide us in our\nrelationship\nmoments to grow to understand ourselves\nmore to understand\nright the deeper for many of us\nemotional wounds\nthat are contributing to these moments\nof conflict\nso it's not an indicator of something\nwrong it should not be avoided\nit's natural we're all going to be in\nconflict and like i said\nit can be incredible learning moment for\nmany of us there's many reasons\nwhy we find ourselves in conflict with\nanother so moving on to two more\npractical tips\nwhat happens in conflict for many of us\nbecause like i said\nwe're being activated for a lot of us\nemotional wounds accumulated emotions\nthings that have been suppressed across\nour lifetime\nare coming to the surface i know i feel\nit my\nemotions go through the roof and i feel\nreally really activated\nwhat that can produce in many of us\nespecially if we have a history of\ntrauma\nis something that's called emotional\nflooding it leads to overwhelm and it\nactually leads to a complete shutdown of\nour system\nit's not helpful to allow ourselves to\nfeel emotionally overwhelmed\nso there's a really practical tool we\ncan call it a\ntimeout or a mutual agreement for a\nbreak what are we going to do\nas one or both of us feel ourself\nescalating to that point as i call it of\nno return\nthis agreement is really helpful if we\nmake it beforehand\nright so if you have that friend or that\nsister or the partner right where\nconflict is a recurrent theme\ntotally normal you and that person might\nwant to come to the agreement\nthat as you feel one or both of yourself\nescalating to that point of no return\nthat you petition for a timeout in that\nmoment\nthe reality here too is that both people\nhave different\nyou know kind of sensitivities or\nthresholds for this\nso we want to honor ourself in calling\nthat timeout\nand someone else so some conflicts i\nmight feel myself being flooded and i\nmight say you know what\nhere's the moment where i need to step\naway from this conversation\nother occasions that might be the person\nwith whom i'm in conflict that person\nmight say\nyou know based on their own unique\nhistory that they are feeling\nclose to that moment of flooding and\nthey need to so it's that mutual\nunderstanding and respect\nthat this we might have those different\nthresholds and i might still want to\ntalk about something when my\npartner or whomever is feeling flooded\nso then what do we do\nwe literally just take time away from\nthe conflict\nright away time space\ncan be what helps our bodies return to\nthat\nbaseline or just more of a balanced\nemotional state\nso this is the second important part of\nthis timeout\nto return and re-engage the conversation\nat a later time\nthis isn't about shoving under the rug\nand just going on until this conflict\nhappens again\nthe two parts of this are agreeing to\ntake that break when\nit's necessary for one or both parties\nand then agreeing to come back\nwhen you are both in a calm or emotional\nspace\nbecause that is when we're gonna set\nourselves up\nto actually come to a resolution during\nor around the conflict\nso it's two parts we honor we take the\nspace\nand then we re-engage the conversation\nthere's one caveat here as always\nthe question about what are you doing\nduring that space\nbecause if i take space and say i take a\nwalk\nbut say on that whole walk i'm\nrevisiting that argument\ni might come back from that walk feeling\nworse off emotionally than i\nbefore i left on that walk if i take\nthat walk however\nand i just bring my full presence to the\nwalk to my body moving through the\nuniverse to feeling the sun on my skin\nyou get the picture\nif i'm not in my mind that might be what\nallows me\nto down regulate and to enter that calm\nspace\nso it's not just about the break it's\nalso about\nhow are you using that break so if we\nare just spinning the issue in our mind\nthat's\nnot going to achieve this return to\nbaseline that we're aiming\nfor here and the final step okay great\ni'm calm my partner's calm we're back at\nit we're gonna have this conversation\nnow what\nnow we have to begin to create a\npractice because many of us are not used\nto listening in this way\nof active listening really short and\nsimple what is active listening\nbeing present truly hearing what the\nother person is saying\nand trying to understand the experience\nthrough their perspective\nthis is not coming up with a retort for\neverything the person says in their mind\nthat i don't agree with\nor saying you know what that's not what\nit was because this is what it was for\nme\nthat is not active listening active\nlistening is\nhearing someone else's perspective and\nthen allowing your perspective which\nmight be different\nto also be heard i have a full video on\nthis i will link below it is called how\nto support someone\nyou can dive into that video and get\nsome more tips with how to\ncultivate this practice of active\nlistening so i'm going to end on this\nnote as well\nall of this is a practice a lot of us\naren't used to having\na more positive if you will relationship\nwith conflict\ni know i avoided conflict at all costs\nbecause remember that family\nthey never showed me how to deal with\nany other way so these steps are\nsomething i still work on i still\ncultivate\nand at times are still really hard so do\nnot have the expectation that you've\nlistened to this video and now\nconflicts are going to be different in\nyour world because they're not\nbut if you practice these steps you can\ntruly\nchange your relationship with conflict\nin your life"
