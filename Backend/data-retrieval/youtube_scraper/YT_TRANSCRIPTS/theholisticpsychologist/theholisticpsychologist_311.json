    "transcript": "hi everyone so a new look for\nthis video here today because i was\nactually inspired\nwhen i was doing some yin yoga myself\nthis week yin yoga is a particular type\nof\nyoga that really focuses on activating\nthe parasympathetic nervous system\nso those of you who follow my work know\nthat i'm often talking about our nervous\nsystem\nand its states of regulation or\ndysregulation which most of us fall into\nmyself include\nit the most common state of\ndysregulation that many of us fall into\nis the fight or flight a lot of us get\nlocked in a\nfight or flight response so the\nnervous system that we want to practice\nactivating if you're like myself and\nyou're either\nlocked pretty consistently in that\nfight-or-flight response and or\nif we're living in a stressful\nenvironment if something kind of acutely\nstressful happens\nwe want to practice activating our\nparasympathetic\nnervous system it's otherwise known as\nour\nrest and digest nervous system\nallowing our body to come back from that\nactivation\nthat happens when we're in that\nsympathetic fight-or-flight state\nand to gain that balance back\nso i was doing in this week because i\nwas feeling stressed\nmy body i was noticing was feeling very\nactivated in that fight or flight way i\nwas feeling\ntension i was feeling a lot of emotional\nreactivity\na lot of agitation so those are my\nmarkers of knowing when\nmy nervous system is activated in that\nfight-or-flight state\nso it came to mind that perhaps it would\nbe\nhelpful for me to practice in yoga to\ngive me some time\nspending in that parasympathetic state\nso what i'm going to show you here today\nis one particular exercise that i really\naffected me\num and really brought into my body a\nsense of calm\nthat happens to be quite easy so those\nof you out there\ni'm hoping you know that are feeling the\nstress in their bodies\ncan maybe use this exercise so i\nhave a yoga block here for those of you\nwho don't have a yoga block\nyou can use a pillow a blanket a towel\nand you want to kind of roll it up to\ngive it a little bit of\ndepth okay so what we're going to do i'm\ngoing to turn sideways to show you\nwe are going to use the block\nto elevate and i'm going to show you i'm\ngoing to lay back in a second\nbut what we're going to be doing is\nusing the block to elevate\nmy hip area so that i'm creating like an\nincline\nthe point of this is so that my\nmy lower body is higher than my heart\nand when my lower body is higher than my\nheart what happens\nis my blood pressure begins to gradually\ndecrease\nright so when i'm in fight or flight my\nbro my blood pressure goes\nup you can probably feel it in your\nheart rate increasing\nso the elevation my heart below my hips\nmy legs right my lower area\nwill decrease my blood pressure and it\nwill also decrease\ncortisol which is the stress hormone\nassociated with fight or flight\nso we can spend however long from three\nminutes to five minutes\nwe want to sit in this position for a\nbit of time to allow those changes to\ntake place\nso i'll be using my yoga block you might\nbe using a pillow\nor a towel rolled up like i said we just\nwant to make sure it's able to lift our\nhips\ncomfortably right don't hoist them up so\nhigh that you're in a state of\ndiscomfort\ncomfortably the goal being that our\nheart is below\nso i have this when we place it we\nwant to make sure we're placing it if\nyou can see this in our lower\nwhere you kind of feel your hip your\nbones down here your lower lumbar area\nso that you can be supported right so\nnot up here it's going to jut you so\nlow down here so i'm going to take my\nblock\ni'm going to oops hoist it right there\nright\nand i'm going to lay\nmight take a second or two right to find\na place for you to settle\nso hips lumbar areas being fully\nsupported\nmy heart i can now tell is lower so the\nblood\nright my blood pressure will decrease my\ncortisol will decrease\nonce i found a nice comfy place to sit\ni sit you can set a timer on your phone\nwe want to be here for a handful of\nminutes at least three minutes set a\ntimer\nwhen that timer goes off check in tune\nin see how your body feels the reason\ni'm sharing this with you\nis when i did this and i spent about\nthree to five minutes myself in that\ni was being queued because listening to\na tape there is a lot of yin yoga\ninstructors out there on the internet\nthat are amazing\nso maybe you want to do a more extensive\npractice though this\nexercise goes a long way so i felt\nmy nervous system upon doing this\ndownshift a little it's not going to be\nanything crazy right if we're\nreally activated and a stress response\ni'm not gonna feel like i'm throwing\npeace signs and i'm chilling right\nbut it's going to help me calm a bit\nit goes a long way so i thought i would\nshare this with you\ni got a lot of help by it i know a lot\nof us are having this nervous system\nactivation and dysregulation both based\non what's happening in our lives now and\na lot of us are just living chronically\nstuck\nso i hope this helps give it a shot and\nthen let me know in the comments\nwhat you think"
