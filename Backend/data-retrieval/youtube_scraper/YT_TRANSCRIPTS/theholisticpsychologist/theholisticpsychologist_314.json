    "transcript": "hi everyone dr nicole lapera the\nholistic psychologist here\nas always thank you to all of my\nsubscribers out there\nif you're not yet subscribed and you\nenjoy this video please hit subscribe at\nthe end\nso today's video is going to be on inner\nchild\ncommunication in our inner child is the\nhouse of our unmet needs\nchildhood wounds that lives in our\nsubconscious mind\na lot of the feelings when we are\noverwhelmed by feelings on a day-to-day\nbasis\na lot of the time it's because it's our\ninner child\nand those deeper wounds that are being\ntouched\nwhen we're in that state of reactivity\nand we go to communicate our feelings to\nour friends our partners our family\nmembers\nwe often lead with other based language\nmeaning we\nuse the word you right we say things\nlike you\nalways do you did you said\netc when we use that you language\nthe listener oftentimes can begin to\nfeel\nthreatened when we hear something that's\ndirected at us by the word you\nour the listeners nervous system can\nbecome triggered\nthey can perceive what's coming next as\na threat\nand when we are feeling threatened i\nassure you we are not listening\nfun fact when we are feeling threatened\nour nervous system activates and one of\nthe activations\nis in our inner ear it actually\nconstricts some of the small\nbones in our inner ear actually making\nthis type of dialoguing\nquite difficult many other reasons it\nbecomes hard when we are emotionally\nactivated\nso the bottom line is we really want to\navoid\nthat type of languaging so that when we\nshare our feelings the feelings that our\ninner child\nmight be having we set ourselves up to\nbe heard\nwe want to really evolve our\nrelationships into\nsafe spaces for communication especially\nwhen our deeper needs and wounds are\ncoming to the surface\nso how do we begin to change you know if\nyou're listening and you kind of\nidentify yeah maybe i do\nuse this you based language how can i\nshift\nhow can i shift the way i talk about my\nfeelings\nin my relationship so that i can feel\nsafer and more known to the people that\ni want to feel safe and known\nto so here are five steps the first step\ninstead of beginning with you\npractice beginning the statement with my\ninner child is feeling\nthat shift from you to my inner child is\nfeeling me\nexploring what my feelings are can allow\nthat person the listener\nto rest to feel safe to maybe be more\nreceptive\nto hear what's coming next as opposed to\nagain at you\nwhere my my senses you know become\nactivated and i shut down so begin\npracticing\nstatements that start with my inner\nchild is feeling this is probably going\nto feel weird\nat first we're not used to communicating\nin this way\nbut with practice this can become a new\nnormal and like i said can go a long way\nto increasing the likelihood that our\nmessage especially around our feelings\na really important message is heard and\nthe next step once we've spoken\nthese feelings especially because many\nof us don't\nshare our feelings in this way a lot\nmight come up so we want to then pause\nand allow things to wash over us\nwhen this as this is new for a lot of us\nit could make us feel\nvulnerable we might be surprised at the\nthings that are coming to the surface\nso we want to make the communication\nstarting with my inner child is feeling\nand then we want to pause to allow the\ndeeper feelings to come to the surface\nso when we're paused and when we're\nallowing\nright the feelings everything to come up\nsome of this might be in our physical\nbody in the form of an energetic release\nit can be tears it can be sensations\na lot of us have had those feelings\nthose energetic energies\nessentially contained and suppressed in\nour body\nso this is okay this is normal this is\nhelpful\nallowing those energies to release i\nknow when i began sharing\nmy inner child feelings i cried a lot\ni felt it in my body much needed release\nbecause for so long\nlike a lot of you those energies were\nstuck\nin me and were keeping me stuck so we're\nwe're stating my inner child we're\nallowing anything and everything that is\nthere to come up and honoring it\nincluding the energetic releases that a\nlot of us might feel\nand then we want to allow the other\nperson\nto have time to process and to feel\nabout\nwhat we just shared the time might vary\nright some of us you know can process\nand be in the moment\nin real time not all of us can these\nmoments might mean\nhours days right allowing the person to\nsit and feel about what they heard you\nshare and having the patience to allow\nright the listener to have that space\nonce then right they have had that time\nto process\nthey might want to share right their\nfeelings based on what they heard\nso then we want to ask practice active\nlistening right do and allow this person\nnow\nto respond in that same way creating\nthat safety\nso that we can learn to practice hearing\nhow someone else feels in a new way\nso i hope this video was helpful again\nremember this is a practice this is a\nprocess this doesn't happen overnight\nit's incredibly challenging to share our\nfeelings with other people\nwe want to learn how to evolve our\nrelationships into safer spaces\nand these tips are a great way to begin\ni hope you found this video helpful\nyou"
