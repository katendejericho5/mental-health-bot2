    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist here so I thought\ngiven all of the circumstances that are\naffecting so many of us a lot of us\nneeding support I would do today's video\non how to support someone so first and\nforemost what is my definition of\nsupport support is allowing someone to\nfeel seen and heard through active\npresence without trying to change them\ntheir feelings a situation the problem\netc just being so how can we what are\nsteps that we can begin to practice so\nthat we can offer or allow those with\nwhom or in relationships to begin to\nfeel support it the first thing we can\nbegin to practice doing is to avoid\ninterrupting or deflecting when someone\nis sharing whatever they're sharing\nthey're sharing about the experience\ndetails their feelings just listening\nmuch harder done than said much easier\nsaid than done\nit is very hard to just sit quietly and\nlisten probably one of the most\ndifficult skills to practice receptive\nlistening that's what we're talking\nabout here so first that means don't\ninterrupt don't talk while the person is\nsharing don't which a lot of us do\nformulate the response or have an\ninternal reaction or imagine how you\nwould deal with it just practice\nlistening like I said much easier said\nthan done another step we can begin to\npractice is to avoid offering advice\nunless of course you're asked for advice\nso many of us lead with advice once we\nheard the problem and a lot of the\nadvice we're leading with is what would\nwork for us we've already come up with a\nsolution and then we're gonna offer the\nadvice what has worked for us in the\npast or what hasn't worked for us in the\npast even if that's your reality try to\navoid offering that advice unless\nsomeone asks you you could begin to make\na habit too if you feel yourself wanting\nto offer advice ask the person hey Janet\nare you interested in advice right now\nif Janet says yes by all means offer\nadvice if Janet says no then withhold\nthat advice another step we can begin to\npractice\nasking questions ask the person what was\nthat like for you how did that feel for\nyou what would have felt better for you\nagain this is an important practice\nbecause what most of us do is we assume\nthat that person has the same ik or\nwould have had the same experience of\nthat situation or that problem that we\nwould we assume from our perspective\nfirst right so it's really helpful to\nbegin to break that habit of assuming\nand just to ask even if you've had a\nvery similar sounding experience what\nmaybe Janet is telling you yes Janet how\nthat was for her you might be surprised\nto hear that would have made you\nincensed or really angry wasn't the part\nthat bothered Janet there was something\nelse that upset Janet what we all do\nthis naturally we live from our own\nexperience first and it's often very\nwell intentioned so that's a practice\nthat we want to break begin to ask the\nperson themselves how it was for them\nthat goes a long way in helping that\nperson feel seen and heard based on\ntheir experience not yours another thing\nwe want to practice isn't affirming what\nwe're hearing or what we're seeing\nsimple statements\nI hear that was really tough I can see\nhow frustrating that must be I can\nimagine that must feel really painful\nagain this doesn't mean that your\nexperience or you would have had the\nsame reaction this is about that person\nand supporting them and what's going on\nfor them in their world so even if you\nwould have reacted differently you can\nshow that you're supportive and you're\nreceptive listening by imagining from\ntheir perspective we all have different\nways we experience the world so to\nreally truly allow someone to feel\nsupport it we're showing up in presence\nright we're listening we're not\ninterrupting we're not deflecting we're\nnot offering unsolicited advice unless\nit's asked for we're asking how the\nexperience was for them we're not\nassuming that we know because we've had\nsomething similar and we're affirming\nwhat it was like for them even if it\nisn't an agreement in alignment with\nwhat how we would feel so I hope these\nsteps are helpful like I said these are\nactive practices that go a very long way\nand allowing those with whom we're in a\nrelationship to feel fully supported so\nI hope this video is helpful giving us\nsome practical steps so that we can also\nto show up in a supportive way for all\nof those in our worlds"
