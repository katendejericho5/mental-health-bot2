    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist here today's video\nis on how trauma affects the body I'm\ngonna talk a little bit about how trauma\naffects the body and polyvagal theory\nwhere is really based in and then I'm\ngonna talk about the consequences of\ncarrying and housing this trauma in our\nbody and in our minds as a lot of us do\nso polyvagal theory developed by an\namazing man named Steven Porges in my\nopinion revolutionize or is\nrevolutionizing the field of psychology\nI think for a long time a lot of us\nweren't really aware of two things of\nreally the long and Lant long-standing\nimpact of trauma and how expansive\ntrauma is meaning a lot of us are\ncarrying some trauma into our adult\nlives and are really really being\nimpacted and when I say polyvagal what\npolyvagal is actually is it's a nerve so\nwhen we're talking about polyvagal\ntheory and trauma in this way we're\ntalking actually better nervous system\nand dysregulation that comes and that we\nlive with within our nervous system so\nyou can imagine our nervous system is\npretty important it runs all of our\nbody's physiological processes in\naddition to the the mental world the\nbrain where our mind is housed so if if\nwe're struggling you know if we're\nhaving dysregulation at that really core\nlevel you can probably imagine that\nthere are a lot of consequences that\nwe're living so when we're children we\nare born onto this planet with a\ninability to regulate our nervous system\nreally an inability to regulate anything\nthat's why as infants we're really\ndependent we need someone to care for\nour physical needs we need someone to\ncare for our bodies energetic and\nemotional needs to help regulate us when\nwe get that regulation let me start\nthere we develop safety and the sense of\nsecurity usually with one or multiple\ncaregiver essentially the people that\nare helping us as a little infant and\nover time when we cry if we get our need\nmet or when we're upset emotionally if\nwe are soothed and brought back into\nthat balance of an equilibrium state we\ndevelop an anticipation or a prediction\nthat that will continue to happen in the\nfuture so we are what we say we feel\nsafe we feel secure in that relationship\nso once we have that core sense of\nsafety and security now we open up\nourselves to the beautiful interpersonal\nnation nature that we as humans are\ngifted with in our species meaning we\ncan we have communication we can mirror\neach other we can be reflected back we\ncan be known so what this looks like in\nchildhood is having a parent a caregiver\nshow up for us\nand reflect back us to us when we're\nupset this is a person who can help us\nunderstand what's happening for us\nthey're at us in that moment but they\ncan help us to make sense of maybe the\nthoughts that we're having or the\nfeelings that we're having in our body\nand they can help us regulate each and\nwant every one of those moments where\nwe're regulating a distressing emotion\nwhere we're just joyful right when we're\nhaving a child if you're watching a\nmother and a child\ninteract and they're just in that pure\njoyous state and smiling at each other\nall of these are examples of this\nmirroring to be seen and known in a\nrelationship is so important these are\ncalled pro-social interactions so\nfoundationally once we feel safe and\nsecure now we can start to have these\npositive experiences of being\ninterpersonal with another creature with\nanother human that is the whole of being\nhuman that's what it means to be\nmirrored and to develop all of these\namazing skills what happens we don't\nhave that sense of security or that\nregulation which often happens again\nbecause we have a parent a caregiver\nwho's dysregulated themselves like my\nmother my mother is extremely\ndysregulated within her nervous system\nso as an infant struggle to help me\nregulate as a toddler struggle to help\nme understand myself my emotions wasn't\nreally fully emotionally available to me\nto reflect back who she saw me to be or\nknew me to be a few instances of really\nfeeling seen and heard and understood\nright so before I know it I had very few\ninstances of that mirroring I didn't\nfeel safe so I started to interact like\nthat and all of my relationships one of\nthe three that I really want to\nhighlight when we are dysregulated we\nare living in trauma we remember a lot\nof us are carrying that with us so the\nexample I'm giving was I'm relationship\nwith my mother at a young age\nhowever because of my conditioning I\ncarried those same patterns into all of\nmy relationships three of the big\neffects of living in this dysregulated\nnervous system that a lot of us carry\nour we struggle as an adulthood using\nothers are using our relationships to\nself-regulate relationships or I\ncontinue to feel unsafe for us to feel\nnot secure maybe we bring our emotions\nin them maybe we don't but we don't have\nthat kind of pro-social experience of\ncoming to another person with a feeling\nand allowing that to be safe and\nregulatory for us more often than not\nwhat we feel is threatened we feel\nunsafe in those relationships so we\nmight not even bring our feelings or\nourselves to our relationships and if we\ndo we don't have those moments right of\nconnection of intimacy where we're being\nmirrored so we lose the ability to\nregulate or to use relationships as a\npoint of security to regulate when I say\nwhat we're interpersonal creatures we\nare bringing feelings and having\nfeelings creat or relationships that\nhelp us create safety is part of being\nhuman but because we're so dis\nregulating because we never had that\nexperience in childhood we struggled to\ndo that in adulthood we struggle to use\nour relationships as points of\nself-regulation another thing that's\nreally confusing it keeps us stuck in\nthis cycle of threat as we actually\nmisinterpret facial expressions so when\nwe see neutral faces our nervous system\nright and begins to affect us\nperceptually we actually see them as\naggressive we see fearful faces is angry\nso now we're misinterpreting facial cues\nfacial cues are how we know if someone\nis safe to be around so imagine how\nconfusing it becomes for us now if\npeople that were neutral or maybe and\nscare themselves we're missing\ninterpreting so negatively again you can\nsee this loop we get stuck in now now I\ndefinitely don't feel safe in my\nrelationships because everyone starts to\nfeel like a threat to me and this is in\nromantic relationships friendships\nfamily work strangers on the street so\nessentially what happens we live this\ncycle long enough and other people\nactually do become true threats we\nactually are activated in our nervous\nsystem some\nus all day long we're walking through\nthe world in survival mode we don't feel\nsafe anywhere we don't feel safe in\nourselves because we never learned how\nto self-regulate in childhood and we\ndon't feel safe in our relationships\nwith others and then before we know it\nsome of us especially given what's\nhappening now contextually we don't feel\nsafe in the world and then before you\nknow what we're living in this survival\nmode and everything is a threat and\nthat's real because we feel it in our\nbodies so some of you listening might be\nthinking great now what check out my\nlast video how to self-regulate I talked\na bit more about the nervous system and\nits development and then I give you five\ntools to get started to build\nself-regulation into your adult world\nand into your relationships I hope you\nfound this video helpful"
