    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist here so today's\nvideo is really important because it is\non the concept of selfishness a lot of\nyou listening have grown up or have\nconditioning around this idea of what is\nselfish and what isn't selfish and in my\nopinion most of us are throwing things\nin this selfish category that are\nactually important acts of self-care\nthat allow us to show up as our best\nself in our relationships so a lot of us\nhave been told that putting ourselves\nfirst that putting our needs first that\nmaking choices that are in our best\ninterests are selfish so what we do\nbefore we know it is we begin to show up\nfor other people for things outside of\nourselves before we show up for\nourselves first and the problem with\nthis is over time this leads to many\nthings that a lot of you listening are\nprobably struggling with such as burnout\nendlessly feeling exhausted never\nfeeling like you have time for yourself\nor for what's important to you in time\nand relationships this translates to\nresentment before we know it we get so\nupset everyone that we're showing up for\nand in a sense we blame them for us\nconstantly showing up for them before we\nshow up for ourselves\nand that can kill a relationship so I\nwant to assure each and every one of you\nlistening that it is not selfish to want\ntime periods where you just don't have\nplans or you don't have obligations or\nyou can just be I've worked with so many\nclients who's months are planned out in\nadvance they know exactly you know who\nthey're seeing Saturday and Sunday and\nplans are great I understand that a lot\nof us have busy lives and to share space\nwith the people that we want to share\nspace with we do need to have plans but\nwhat I come to see is everything is\nplanned there are obligations that we\nhave lists of obligations that just\ncolor our entire social calendar and I'm\nhere to assure you it is okay to rein it\nin not to have every moment of your free\ntime planned with someone\nit's okay to have a morning or an\nafternoon where you just don't have\nplans and you wake up and you see how\nyou feel and you take the day based on\nhow you feel I also want to assure you\nit is not selfish to prioritize your\nhappiness now here's a subjective word\nwhatever happiness means for you it's\nokay to make choices based on what\nyou're going to do in any given day or\nhow you're going to spend your time or\nnot spend your time that allow you to\nfeel some version of your own happiness\nthat is not selfish that is actually\nincredibly important that your happiness\nfactors in somewhere in how you spend\nyour time or in your relationships a\nshirt each and every one of you\nlistening that is not selfish to say no\nto things that feel draining no is one\nof the hardest words I've had how to\never learn to speak because I am someone\nwho endlessly showed up for everyone\naround me and as I started to become\nmore and more connected to myself I\nbecame more and more connected to how\nexhausted I felt doing that so I started\nto realize and I started to be able to\ndifferentiate the things that were\nmaking me feel more exhausted and\nlearning how to say no in those areas\nwas incredibly important so I assure you\nif you are if you know the areas that\nare causing you that drain practice\nsaying no to one you know a suggestion\nor one offering or one invite with that\none friend that you always leave feeling\nso drained just begin to practice saying\nno if you're listening and you don't\nknow exactly what's causing you to feel\nso drained begin to watch begin to\nobserve find that list of the things\nthat are a little bit more draining than\nyou would like them to be and begin to\npractice saying no it's not selfish it's\nalso not selfish to change your mind\nthis goes back to I used to be an\nendless planner all of my weekends were\nplanned weeks in advance because the\nidea of not having plans for me was\nreally uncomfortable and what would\nhappen I came to find out I would make a\nplan on Tuesday\nfor Saturday and by Saturday I the last\nthing I wanted to do was that plan I\nmade on Tuesday how do I know how I'm\ngonna feel on Saturday so coming to that\nawareness that it's okay that what I\nthought I was gonna want to do a week\nago isn't what I actually want to do\ntoday it's okay and it's not selfish to\nchange your mind it is also not selfish\nto have boundaries\nmeaning limits that might be different\nthan the limits of those around you\nlimits around how I spend time with my\nphysical body how much space my physical\nbody needs boundaries around again\nemotions how much time how much energy\nI'm investing it's okay to set a limit\nand to begin to say no when you are\ngoing outside of those boundaries in a\nway that doesn't feel good for you is\nnot selfish it is also not selfish to\nreevaluate relationships that are\nchaotic that are draining that are\nstressful that just aren't working for\nyou over my healing journey of how to\nreevaluate so many relationships as I\nbegan to do all of these steps to\nunderstand I could change my mind to\nbegin to say no to tune in to how I feel\nwhen I'm relating with other people\nI had to reevaluate a lot of my\nrelationships I started to show up\ndifferently or not at all in a lot of\nlong-term relationships because they\njust weren't working for me anymore and\nthat is not selfish it's also not\nselfish to have hobbies and interests\nother people don't get or don't\nunderstand or that aren't into this\nconnects with with with number one if\nyou don't know what your hobbies and\ninterests are just carve out some time\nto explore yourself to see what makes\nyou feel good to see how you like to\nspend your time at the end of that\nexploration you might find that you have\nsome interest and no one gets and that's\nokay and is not selfish to pursue time\nand interest that people might not be\ninterested in it is not selfish so those\nof you listening I hope these are\nhelpful reminders that I want to offer\nyou today we really need to start to\nrethink this concept of selfishness\nbecause like I said as we begin to\nprioritize our self to have boundaries\nto say no to tune in to how I feel to\nexplore what makes me feel good\nI set myself up to decrease resentment\nin my relationships I set myself up to\nshow up in my relationships as the\nauthentic me and to have more fulfilling\nrelationships overall so I hope these\nreminders were helpful for you today\nyou"
