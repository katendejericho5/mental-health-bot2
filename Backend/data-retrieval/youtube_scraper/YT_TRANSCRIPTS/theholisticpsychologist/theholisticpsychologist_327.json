    "transcript": "hi everyone doctor Nicola para the\nholistic psychologists here as always\nthank you to each and every one of you\nsubscribers out there if you're not yet\nsubscribed and you like this video\nplease feel free to do so at the end so\ntoday's video is on the trauma brain\nfive signs that you might be struggling\nwith trauma brain so first and foremost\nwhat is trauma I'm a big believer that\ntrauma is a much more expansive\nexperience that most of us have had in\nour past then the traditional definition\nso what do we typically think of when we\nthink of trauma we think of a big\nglaring instance of abuse of neglect the\nbig bad thing that happens and while yes\nthat is part of the experience of trauma\na lot of trauma that a lot of us are\nexperiencing is overlooked trauma also\ncomes in the form of not feeling seeing\nheard valued as a child having our\nboundaries violate it typically in our\nyou know first environments and our\nfamily systems also trauma involves\nhaving really big overwhelming emotions\nwith very little guidance on how to work\nthrough them or how to process through\nthem so when you hear that expanded\ndefinition a lot of you out there\nlistening while you might not have the\nmemory of the big bad thing that\nhappened you might resonate with these\nfive indicators of trauma brain because\nlike I said trauma is much more\npervasive than most of us realize so\nfirst and foremost one indicator of\ntrauma brain an obsessive desire to be\nchosen by others romantic partners\nfriends bosses professional without any\nawareness of how you or your body feels\nin that context in that relationship\nwithin that connection it's really just\na hyper focus on does this person\nwhoever they might be like me do they\nwant me I hear this a lot in dating I'll\nspeak to people who are in the early\nstages of cultivating a romantic\nrelationship or even a friendship and I\nhear such a focus on what him or her\nthey or them think about me without well\nwait a minute how do I feel showing up\nto spend time with this person how do I\nfeel in my body is this positive do I\nfeel lighter and lift it when I leave\nthis\nexchange or do I feel heavy and\nnot-so-positive\nagain this really is forsaking what I\nfeel with only a hyper focus on being\naccepted being valued or being wanted by\nthe other person number two this also\nlooks like in these two are connected\nchronic social anxiety what is that when\nI am hyper vigilant I'm always if I'm\nout even if it's me and one other person\nor me a group of people I tend to find\nmyself monitoring what everyone else\nmainly is thinking about me alright so\nagain without any focus on how am i\nenjoying this exchange or these people\nin my mind I'm worrying about who do\nthey like me do they say the right thing\nand a lot of us experience this version\nof social anxiety another version again\nof this is I'm worried more about you\nand how you're experiencing me then how\nI'm experiencing the situation number\nthree this is another one that a lot of\nus struggle with especially in the\ndigital age so a need for consistent\ndistraction right part of trauma is we\nreally don't feel safe in this present\nmoment so what many of us do and I'm the\nbiggest I used this biggest coping tool\nthose of you been following you know I\ncall it my spaceship of dissociating of\ndistracting myself from the present\nmoment because the present moment\ndoesn't feel safe to many of us who have\ntrauma brain this I mean the the typical\none that most of us think about\nsubstance use but this looks so\ndifferent now this is so much more\nexpanded again this could look like\nchronic social media use this could look\nlike just distracting myself daydreaming\nbeing somewhere else entirely and again\nwe're leaving the present moment\ntypically because something doesn't feel\nsafe about the present moment might not\neven be mapping onto the reality of a\nnot safe moment some of this is just\nthat remnant of the trauma of feeling\nunsafe and past experiences so what do\nwe do we escape it and we escape it like\nI said by dissociating by distracting\nourselves by just doing something else\nwith our attention and not being as\nfully present here for another sign of\ntrauma brain is consistent chronic egos\nbased on self judgment in comparison\nmany of us have that internal critic in\nour minds and what that sounds like is\nan endless litany of and again the\ndigital age provides us multiple\nopportunities to see how other people\nare doing and to compare ourselves and\ntrust me oftentimes we're not comparing\nourself favorite favorably we're feeling\nless about ourselves and others were\njudging ourselves and then number five\nso trauma brain also looks like a lack\nof self trust that often leads to\nprocrastination self-sabotage and shame\ncycles again as a result of our past\nexperiences and our conditioned\nexperiences many of us don't show up for\nourselves we betray ourselves we show up\nfor others we worry more about others\nwe're distracting ourselves from\nourselves and then before you know it we\nfind episodes of procrastination putting\nthings off never getting to them endless\ncycles of self-sabotage not showing up\nin the world as we want and not\naccomplishing the things that we want so\nif you are resonating with these five\nindicators of trauma brain take a look\nthe way out of trauma brain because this\nis the result of our past experiences\nand our conditioned behaviors we now\nhave to teach ourselves how to show up\ndifferently in the world for ourselves I\nwill link below a video on the how to's\nof re parenting that is a great way to\nget you started in healing the trauma\nbrain so I hope you found this video\nhelpful"
