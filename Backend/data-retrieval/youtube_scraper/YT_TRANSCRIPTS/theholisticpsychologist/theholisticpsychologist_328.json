    "transcript": "hi everyone doctor Nicola Perry the\nholistic psychologist here so today I\nhave a really awesome conversation that\nI'm gonna be having with actually a\nlongtime friend and colleague Christina\nfuria you those of you who might have\nbeen following my story I shout her out\noften she's over at your new frequency\non Instagram a little back story\nChristina and I actually trained\ntogether and worked together at a\npsychoanalytic Institute so for those of\nyou listening and don't know what that\nessentially means is think Freud take\nthe couch think talk therapy and since\nthen her and I have both gone on and\nevolution in terms of our practice and\nChristina is now doing some\ntransformation work based in energy\npsychology it's really incredible really\nimpactful and the conversation that\nwe're gonna have today I think is gonna\nbe of great benefit for everyone\nlistening so I welcome you Christina to\nchatting with me today thank you so much\nfor having me of course of course so\nwhat we're going to talk about today is\na big word but I think you and I agree\nthat it is probably the most important\ntool for change and it is a practice of\nwhat we call metacognition so first to\nclear up any confusion we're gonna talk\nabout what metacognition is and then a\nlittle bit about why it's important and\nthen of course we're gonna give everyone\nlistening some tools to get you started\nso first just talk to me a little bit\nabout what metacognition means to you\nmaybe how and where you met it on your\nown journey and I love the way you\nexplain these sort of more elusive\nconcepts so what is metacognition\nchristina do tell us yeah yeah\nabsolutely so medical cognition is the\npractice of noticing your thoughts on an\nongoing basis so in other words as\nyou're going through your day you know\noftentimes we're engaging in in habitual\nways of functioning and also habitual\nways of thinking and because of that we\nend up sort of being more or less on\nautopilot in fact I think it's estimated\nthat most\nrunning up too late 95% of our time on\nautopilot so metacognition kind of\nallows us to come out of autopilot by\nreally just observing what's going on\nwithin ourselves once we do that we then\ngain the immense power of being able to\nactually reap a turn and reprogram some\nof the stuff that we're observing that's\nnot serving our highest interests in\nterms of my specific journey with\nmetacognition I learned about this kind\nof in the midst of actually you know\nthese aren't things we learn about\ntraditionally as therapists which is\nreally super interesting but but true so\nI've only known about it since I've been\ndoing kind of this new body of work and\nhonestly I think that in terms of my own\ntransformation metacognition was pretty\nmuch there's pretty quintessential\nactually because that's how you really\ncan can start to just restructure things\nand really notice the things that hold\nyou back and for me I found that there\nwere lots of negative patterns of\nthought that I really had no idea even\nexisted within me that once I sort of\ncame to the understanding of course I\ncould get in there and switching things\nup so metacognition super-powerful\npractice yeah for sure and I I couldn't\nagree with you more Christine and I'm\nfinding more and more as I connect with\ncolleagues in different areas I mean you\nand I shared a very similar focus in\nterms of the psychoanalytic world so I'm\nvery connected with what you were\nlearning but expanding my reach and\nconnecting with other professionals you\nknow in other areas the social workers\njust all different types of training I'm\nhorrified in a lot of ways that these\nthings just aren't talked about because\nthey're incredibly powerful and it took\nmy own realization of how habitual I was\nas a creature after a lot of kicking and\nscreaming in terms of my not wanting to\nbe as honest with myself in some of the\nways but you'll often hear and everyone\nlistening who follows my work knows that\nI often describe I talk about\nconditioning and what I mean when I say\nthat is what you and I are talking about\nin terms of the patterning that\nconsistent whether it's the patterns\nthat we're living behaviorally but I\nthink even more powerfully that\npatterns that were thinking day in and\nday out and a start point becomes I\nthink for most of us just the initial\nrealization that for some of us at least\nit thoughts are happening all day long\nand I don't think that some of us humans\nare connected with that reality you know\nI think we get confused with these\nvoices in our head that we're all living\nwith them I think we can all identify\nthat yeah something's going on up here\nbut I don't think we're really fully\naware of what it is of how present it is\nand of how to then begin to harness it\nfor change because I think before we get\nto the change part it is incredibly\nimpactful our thoughts our coloring our\nexperiences all day long and I've worked\nwith many a client who part of the work\ninitially was introducing them to that\nendless dialogue in their mind and I\nthink that's that's where change begins\nso the practice of metacognition is\nessentially the beginning practice of\nobserving that that endless dialogue in\none's mind that I do believe has\nfar-reaching consequences for most of us\nyeah absolutely I mean I'm low and it's\nit's suggested that we're thinking like\nminimally 10,000 thoughts a day and on\nthe high hand it's something like 60,000\nI mean that is a lot of thinking that\nwe're doing every single day so to not\nbe cognizant of what that thinking\nactually entails at this point in my\nlife it's like oh my goodness this\ndoesn't make any sense we've got to be\npaying attention you know there's\nthere's a world of knowledge about\nourselves and our programming our\nconditioning that lives in those those\nmany many thoughts that are existing so\nit's it really is crucial to any growth\njourney yeah\nfor sure for sure and I think sometimes\nwhen you engage in that process it can\nbe surprising alarming for some people I\nknow when I met my internal world and\nreally saw if you will what it was\nsaying what I was saying to myself it\nbrings up a lot of feelings too it's\nit's it's it can be and I think for some\npeople and when we get to I think the\nclose of this to how to begin I think a\nlot of people maybe resist looking\nsometimes internally in doing this this\nobservational work\nas I call it because it can be\noverwhelming to to have eyes in there\nand to see because it's not always\npositive I know you talk often about\nyour own critical thoughts and you know\nthat endless real I know we all have\nthem I have them myself and it's I think\nit can it can begin put it this way in\ndiscomfort a process like this but it\ncan end an incredible incredible\nempowerment I've definitely worked with\na lot of people who when you meet there\nyou meet your internal world it's it's\neye-opening but you're right I think\nit's very pattern we can gain so much in\nterms of self-awareness and then so much\nin terms of how to harness the mind\nitself for change so I mean that why why\ndo we want to look I mean what what is\nit that is so important about taking\nthis journey inward in a sentence in\nyour opinion yeah I mean I think that by\nreally starting to pay attention you\nknow ultimately we come to understand\nwho we are in in deeper ways than just\nhow we move through the day you know the\nthe stuff that kind of lives beneath the\nsurface of our conscious mind our\nsubconscious is really where the bulk of\nthe information about who we are if you\nknow it that's where it exists and so to\nreally in tune into that stuff one\nyou're gonna learn about yourself but\nyou're gonna learn about the areas of\nwork that are really yet to be to be\ndone and just to what you were saying\nearlier about kind of wanting to be\navoidant of actually doing this getting\nin there and paying attention I think\nthat that is incredibly true and\nsomething that is important to remember\nat the beginning at least for my journey\nthis was true is that I would start to\npractice alright let me pay attention\nI'll pay attention a little bit more a\nlittle bit more but my defense\nmechanisms which would show up and then\nredirect me away from it I'm like oh\ngosh how long has it been since the last\ntime I noticed my thoughts and you know\nit probably been you know maybe hours or\nwhatever but I think that it truly is a\npractice and you know as you do it more\nand more those\ndefense mechanisms start to lower and it\nbecomes more possible to actually\nwelcome in the observation instead of\nsword like oh gosh I'm not sure do I\nreally want it do I really want to look\ndo I really want to know yeah 100% I\nlove that language that you just used to\nsaying welcome in but I think to speak\nyour point even before the defense's you\nknow can come up because you're bringing\nup this subconscious which I love so\nmuch we are driven we I often describe\nas I did earlier humans as habitual and\nwe prefer our subconscious prefers us to\nbe on that autopilot so before we even\nget to oh what am I seeing you know is\nit uncomfortable or my defenses being\ntriggered that's gonna divert my\nattention away we are you know kind of\nin the in those moments throughout our\nday our subconscious pull to do the same\nthing that we always do whatever that is\nif you think the same thing that you\nalways think is behind the scenes\noperating meaning we are driven toward\nthose ruts as I call them of that\nfamiliarity based in that subconscious\npull so even the practice of observing\nyour your thought in a new way or your\nmind in a new way is in my opinion going\nagainst that green going against that\nfamiliar pull so it does take that\nconsistent practice of learning tonight\nthis is just the language I use learning\nto navigate your mind in this new way\nfirst and foremost because if not our\neyes open at the beginning of the day\nand we just go about our day and for\nmost of us that's not going about our\nday in a self observational way or\nliving as I say in our conscious mind or\nwatching our thoughts as you and I are\ntalking about we're not doing that on\nautopilot our auto pilot looks\ndrastically different depending on who\nwe are I know what my auto pilot looked\nlike I was disconnected largely so while\nthere might have been things happening\nin my external world and in my internal\nworld I was my attention was somewhere\nelse entirely so to begin to use and\nharness this tool I think for a lot of\nus it's learning at that first step to\nto be practicing that observation and\nthen we get to the hurdle of oh now I'm\nuncomfortable about what I see and I'm\nusing my defenses of avoidance or\ndetachment or whatever it might be or\nwhatever the defense is and then\nthat hurdle to then open up and welcome\nand soften into what is there but yeah I\nthink the autopilot pull for most of us\nis not a life that's self observational\nis a lot not a life that's practicing\nmetacognition a lot of us have developed\nother conditioned habits that aren't as\npresent again to our external world but\nwhat we're more interested in today is\nto our internal world yeah absolutely\nand speaking to that point I think that\nit's really helpful to pair this work\nwith the knowledge that we are not\nactually our thoughts who we are\nat a core level really is very little to\ndo with our thoughts our thoughts are\nour conditioning of course but but the\nthe core of who we are on a very human\nand even soul level really has nothing\nto do with our thoughts and and for me\nwhen I learned that it was like okay I\ncan do this because at first it's kind\nof like oh gosh these thoughts are\nhorrible I don't want to pay attention I\ndon't actually want to know but I think\nthat pairing the watching of your\nthoughts with that knowledge actually\ncan can be a bit of a game-changer\nbecause I think there's less stress than\nsort of distress about what you might\nfind yeah 100% I love that that language\nthat you're using there too and that\nreminder to everyone listening that you\nare not your thoughts I mean none of us\nare our thoughts and that is I think one\nof the the core tenants of this process\nthat we get to me is that self that's\nnot what's going on in our head and I\nthink what I was referencing earlier is\nthe start point where we don't really\nknow what's going on up there a lot of\nus have merged what's going on up there\nespecially with this one concept that I\ncomes up a lot in my work which is\nintuition we do believe on some level\nthat that voice in our head is us I mean\nin so much as its medium guiding us it's\nhelping us to make our decisions you\nknow it colors who we are and that what\nyou displace so beautifully is we are\nnot our thoughts that's just such an\nincredibly empowering truth but as far\nas I see it we don't embody truth unless\nwe live that truth so it's not until\nobserving that separate\nthat there is a self that's behind the\nscenes and I love the collective in the\ndirection that's moving because now we\ncan universally speak of this elusive\nconcept of the authentic self so that's\nmainly what I'm really interested in in\nmy work and I think that's what you're\nreferencing here is that that self all\nof those stories that your mind might be\ntelling you that you are isn't actually\nwhat you are that there is something\nelse would you say you agree that\nthere's what is it that is behind the\nthoughts and what is it that you you\nknow kind of are referencing when you\nsay you are not your thoughts who argue\nthat in your opinion or who is one yeah\nyeah I mean I think that we are\nconsciousness we are the one that looks\nand can observe everything observe who\nwere being observed how we're thinking\nobserve how were interacting and\ninterpersonal relationships you know we\nare that kind of bird's-eye view that is\nis the truest sense of who who we are\nlike I said the thoughts are just kind\nof the conditioning and kind of the\nstuff that actually kind of MUX up who\nwe are at that high level but again same\nthing I think that that is an important\npiece of knowledge to hold with you when\nyou're doing this work because if you're\nnot I think it gets into the territory\nagain like oh gosh this is some ugly\nstuff that I don't really want to\nexplore but when you're exploring it\nfrom the perspective of this is kind of\njust what life has done to me as opposed\nto this is who I am it all feels very\nvery different yeah I couldn't agree\nmore and what life has done to me an\naccumulation of my experiences as\npainful as they might have been for some\nof us what empowerment on the other side\nof that to begin to detangle you know\nall of that a lot of us have been\nwearing as our identity for so long\nunderstandably so I mean when you're\nliving that life and within those\npatterns within that conditioning that\nthat is the fruit that's all you see is\nthat is Who I am\nbut it's so empowering when you start to\nrealize and separate that out and\nseparate all that you've been through\nit's part of your story it will continue\nto impact and inform your life but it\ndoesn't have to be the remainder of your\nstory which I think brings us into so I\nwant to I think break up the amazing\nwork that you're providing outs of the\ncollective into these because I know\nthat you do a lot of work around a\nconcept or a practice called visioning\nbut before we get there to sticking on\nthe topic of metacognition or observing\nourselves and our thoughts you know kind\nof in the simplest way how with\nlisteners out there you know who are\ninterested in this and who are maybe\nfeeling a little bit empowered that they\ncan break out of some of these condition\npatterns how would you suggest we just\nbegin to touch our toe into the practice\nof metacognition itself and then I want\nto talk a bit more about your particular\ntype of visioning that you that you talk\noften about yeah absolutely so I think\nthat it starts with intention setting\nyou know actually setting the intention\nevery morning if possible that today I'm\ngoing to notice my thoughts throughout\nthe day I'm gonna notice what's going on\nwith my thinking and then you know of\ncourse like I was saying earlier you're\nnot gonna remember all day it's just\nit's especially at the beginning it's\njust a given you know you'll become\ndistracted you'll forget you'll go back\ninto autopilot that is fine however I\nthink it's very helpful to have some\ncheckpoints to kind of get you to to\ncheck back in to recalibrate and and\nstart looking at things again so\nsomething that I did when I was first\nstarting was sort of silly but every\ntime I filled up the my bottle of water\nI'm like the slow thing that drips on\nthe refrigerator it takes so long I'd be\nlike oh this is a great checkpoint so I\nwould check in but how have I been\nholding my mind have I have I been\nnoticing how I'm holding my mind what\nI'm thinking about a mentor of mine\ntaught me also doorknobs any handle\nevery time you touch a handle how are\nyou handling your thoughts how are you\nhandling the situation and I thought\nthat that was sort of clever and cute\nbut also really helpful because you know\nwe touch doorknobs quite often\nthroughout the day so again and it can\nbe whatever you want it's really just\nabout I think what\nworks for you what's kind of practical\nfor your set of circumstances but\nespecially at the beginning it's very\nvery important to have some external\nreminders that this is what you want to\nbe doing because like I said it's not\ngoing to be a thing like Oh suddenly I\njust pay attention tonight that's all\nthe time yeah 100% that's the point that\nwe were agreeing with earlier our\nhabitual is not conscious in those ways\nfor some of us our habitual is not\nnoticing where our thoughts are what our\nrelationship is in our mind throughout\nthe day so I agree with you we have to\nbe intentional about creating that habit\nshift what one in which we do check in\nwith ourselves so I am the biggest fan\nof setting daily intentions you know\nbringing to conscious awareness okay\nthis is what I want to work toward doing\ndifferently today but I agree with you\nwholeheartedly even though if I've done\nthat so for me mine looks like my\njournaling in the morning I set my\nintentions of how I want to show up\ndifferently throughout that day but a\nlot of minutes happen between when I\nshut my journal that morning and then I\ngo about my day a lot of moments that\ncan easily lead us to shift right back\ninto by the time of my lunch I'm fully\nan autopilot again and I'm not noticing\nmy thoughts so while I'm gonna sit in\nagreement in two ways the consistency of\nthe daily practice is important we need\nthose reminders as far as I say it until\nthat becomes a habit throughout the day\nand I love the reminders of just pairing\nit with something that you do naturally\nthroughout your day open doors you know\nI often say I ask my clients that I\nwould work with what what is something\nyou do every day regardless I mean you\neat you know so maybe those can be I\nmean we now have a world of technology\nset reminders on your phone you know\nwhen your phone goes off oh right\nwhere's my attention what am I thinking\nwhere am i but I agree with you it needs\nmore prompting to set the intention and\nthen to follow the intention throughout\nthe day and sometimes it's just setting\nthose moments throughout your day to\nhave those check points so I love I love\nthose suggestions so anyone listening\nyou know find the thing that you're\ndoing anyway throughout your day and at\nfirst because I'm a big fan of small\npromises and you make it just that one\nintention you know if you're\none who makes coffee every morning while\nthe coffeepot is brewing that's the time\nwhere you're gonna check in with\nyourself our goal of course is to expand\nthat throughout the day I mean I think\nthat you would agree with me our goal is\nto be as aware of our thoughts ourselves\nto be that hovering you know observer in\nmy opinion throughout the day and I\nthink that you would agree but it starts\nwith just making that intention\nkeeping that intentional promise and\nthen expanding expanding that practice\nand if yeah absolutely and I think you\nmake it in yeah I think you make an\nimportant point and that you know it\nreally the goal is to be really paying\nattention throughout the day you know as\nclose to at all times as possible but\nthat that also shouldn't be the\nexpectation right away you know I think\nthat if we set ourselves us it's sort of\ntoo high of a standard or goal at the\nbeginning it's a recipe for failure\nbecause it's kind of a gosh I suck at\nthis I only checked in like you know a\nfew a few times a day so really starting\nto your point about kind of small\npromises starting with you know setting\nthe intentions starting with creating\nsome check points and really being kind\nand easy with yourself compassionate\nwith yourself as you get into the rhythm\nI mean certainly a solid 90 days really\nfeeling like you're just kind of\nlearning to crawl not even to walk but\njust a crawl and then you know kind of\non the other side of that those first\nfew months I think then you can start\ntalking about the ante and and you know\nnotice a little bit more throughout the\nday and my favorite part of this process\nfor me is when I got to the point where\nI started noticing my thoughts all the\ntime without needing the checkpoints it\njust became implicit to how I exist in\nthe world which is really wonderful\nbecause now it's actually a built in\nhabit my autopilot if you will actually\nwithin it consists of this practice this\nheightened consciousness so I think\nthat's that's the long-term goal yeah\nyeah and I appreciate you highlighting\nthat the long-term\nhave it changed and I think that's what\nI'm hearing you say so anyone listening\nit does happen it happened for me as\nwell I mean I broke habits of\ndissociating I came down to my body so\nthat I could observe my thoughts and now\nI do live life more or less as a\nconstant observer of myself and the\nworld around me and in that state I have\nincredible opportunity to create change\nbecause that's in my opinion where\nchoice lives so starting at the end I\nassure everyone listening it does happen\nbut I'm really happy that you pointed\nout how long it takes and the patient\naspect and the concept of expectations\nbecause a lot of us put such a high\nexpectation on ourselves and especially\nwith the practice like this where it's\nchallenging and it's uncomfortable that\nwe almost set ourself up to fail if we\nenter into this journey thinking Oh\nbuh-bye next week I'll totally know\nwhat's going on and then maybe by the\nweek after I'll tweak the things that\nare going on that could benefit me a\nlittle more and then by week three you\nknow I'm golden\nI'm often the bearer of this bad news\nand I'm really happy that you're now on\nmy team to bear this bad news that it\njust doesn't happen like that this does\ntake commitment and there are going to\nbe days at least there were for me we're\nin the beginning I was not consistent I\ndid not keep those promises to myself\nfor a million different reasons and I\ndid not string together you know this\ninto becoming a habit for quite some\ntime so I'm really happy that you're\ntalking about the expectations and how\nit really does start small but on the\nother end of it it's so incredibly\nempowering but I think here's some\nanother important thing to touch on\nbecause I think about this often I've\nstruggled with this often and we alluded\nto it the discomfort I think that\nsometimes comes I talk about honesty and\nradical honesty with with ourselves a\nlot of the time too and I loved it\nbecause you wrote a post a bit back\ntalking about keeping secrets from\nyourself and we could I can hear that in\ntwo ways the first way is oh I'm always\ngoing to be observing myself so that\nthere are no secrets there's nothing\nthat's unseen but then my mind goes to\nthe necessity at least as I see it of\nbeing honest with ourself about what we\nsee once we're doing this work and\nthat's challenging to some of us are\nseeing condition patterns that are quite\non call\nthat we'd rather not see I know myself\nincluded when I started to observe what\nwas going on a big part of me like you\nwere saying with your defenses wanted to\nturn away wanted to say oh that's not\nreally what I'm seeing and that's not\nreally what I think of myself and if he\ncan plis it in this process is that\nhonesty is having to come to terms with\nand maybe even feel about for a bit what\nwe are seeing that's happening in our\ninternal world and I don't know if you\nwould agree with that or what you what\nyou think of in terms of how the\ndifficulty of what it is that you see in\na necessity of being honest but I think\na lot about that because I know that\nwith the discomfort a lot of us want to\nrun away and and through that it's\neasier to deny what we're seeing\nespecially when we're thinking about\nourselves because it's not always shiny\nyeah yeah I mean for me personally I've\nreally taken the stance of sort of\naccepting anything that I observe with\nreally just an openness just again like\na kindness and a compassion and you know\nsometimes I don't like what I'm\nobserving but it's very much like hmm\nokay and then making the choice to just\nsimply be alright with it and and then\nfrom there I think once you get to that\npoint of acceptance then you are ready\nand empowered to start creating the\nchange but I think that if you're\nresisting your thoughts if you're\nresisting something that is part of your\ncurrent truth it's very difficult to\ncreate that change because you're not\nyou're not in alignment and so it's very\nimportant to your point to really be\ncomfortable with that that radical that\nradical honesty yeah I couldn't agree\nmore and you just something sparked when\nI ate when I heard you say resistant to\nyour thoughts because I think that\nbefore we even get to judge our thoughts\nfor some of us there is is that\nresistance just to thoughts in general\nand when I talk I talk often about a\npractice of you know consciousness\nbuilding typically through a practice of\nmeditation and I'm often met with a lot\nof people believing falsely that the\ngoal of all of this work is to become\nthought-free\nbecome to go to a utopian place where\nthere just is no thoughts that happen\nand so I think it the first step of this\nis realizing that that's not that's not\nreally accurate we're not going to live\na life that's thought free the goal\nactually in my opinion isn't you I think\nthere's such a value in our thoughts in\nunderstanding our self and then where I\nwant to shift this conversation now into\ncreating change in our from our thinking\nmind into our lived experience but I\nthink a lot of us believe out there and\nmaybe some listeners do that the\nultimate goal I mean yes the byproduct\nof this work often is a quiet herb mind\nhowever we're never going to be a\nspecies that does not have thoughts we\nneed thoughts the issue becomes how\noften we're engaging with our thoughts\nand whether or not our thoughts are\nproductive or unproductive as I call\nthem but at that first juncture it is\naccepting our thoughts you know just\nknowing that they're there that we're\nnot trying to battle them away and then\nwelcoming and leaning into to speak to\nyour point what you're seeing using it\nfor self awareness and then let's talk a\nlittle bit about using it for change so\nnow we begin to create a habit of\nconscious self observation of\nmetacognition of watching our self\nthrough the day maybe some of us are\ndoing it using these great suggestions\nof pairing it with what's happening and\nmaybe I'm starting to gain some traction\nand I'm starting to live more in that\nstate what what now or what do you\nsuggest I know you talk often about a\nprocess called visioning can you say a\nlittle bit about you know where we could\nbuild to actually now begin to change\nour maybe our minds our views of\nourselves others the world I mean what\nhappens next\nyeah so one of the core tenets of my\nwork is visioning which pretty much is\nthe process of creating a future vision\nfor what you would like your life to be\nI normally start with three years out\nbut you could also do it one year out\nfive years out you can really do it\nhowever you'd like and it it covers\nevery life domain but you could also\nkind of just hone in on one or two areas\nand the reason why it pairs so well with\nmetacognition is because\nvisioning work and and actually living\ninto the vision requires you to shift\ninto a higher frequency you need to be\nkind of vibrating on a higher level and\nthat aligns us with our vision so we\nmight say we want to stay in the\nfrequency of our vision so the thing\nabout that is you can't just magically\nyou know think differently and beyond\nthe frequency if you're not able to\nreally observe how you're holding your\nmind and so when we become active\nobservers and stay an active observer\nfor a period of time then we become\nempowered to create that change which\nallows us to become a match for our\nvisions which allows us to live into\nthat vision I love that because I think\nyou agree with me and I think I've we've\ntalked about it and I've seen you post\nabout it or at least I know my\nexperience of this whole world so you\nknow visioning I know a very collective\nterm that we a lot of us have come into\ncontact with now manifesting you know\nthis whole world of I thinking it is at\nleast when I first met it decades ago\nnow and the secret you know first came\nout I thought it was a bunch of\nI thought that's so silly you know what\nI think of something and it shows ah not\nonly did I not understand the science\nbehind it that is real that is based in\nthe quantum world but I just did it\nprobably part of it was I didn't feel\nlike it would work and probably a big\npart of it wouldn't have because the\nspeak to your point I wasn't able to\nshift my mind I wasn't able to step into\na frequency because I wasn't able to not\nto you know embody that practice first\nand foremost of metacognition so and I\nthink listeners out there might be\nresonating with this because it's very I\nmean now that we understand the science\nbehind it you know I think it's gaining\nsome traction oh the mind is so powerful\nI can create change in my world by my\nmind that's really attractive but I\nthink a lot of us might be not able to\nsuccessfully harness that power and that\nwork because we're not taking that first\nstep of you know\nseeing our mind being able to use our\nmind or our attention more intentionally\nto be able to create that vibrational\nshift because what we're doing even if\nwe're playing around with it maybe you\nknow different points in our day or a\nweek or what-have-you\nwere then spending the rest of our time\nyou know not practicing that observation\nnot you know seeing our mind is there\nand us and us is here and I think that's\nreally really limiting so I'm really\nhappy that you know it's or I think\nwe're illustrating is the two-step\nprocess of it you know first we have to\nrearrange the relationship with our mind\nand then we can create in my opinion at\nleast incredible change by using a\npractice such as visioning yeah yeah\nabsolutely into your point about you\nknow I'll just think about what I want\nand you know it will come to me I think\nthat's really important because these\nconcepts I think can alienate a lot of\npeople from the beginning because it's\nkind of like well that's silly and\nthat's not real you know magics not real\nso obviously this isn't real but the\nreality is this is there's some\ncomplexity to two manifestation it's\nvery it's very much doable and it's\nsomething that you know you me anybody\nwatching can absolutely do but it's\nimportant to really understand that it\nvery much is a process of changing your\nyour mind changing your thinking it's\nnot just thinking about what you want\nwanting something really bad it's it's\nmuch more holistic than that and I think\nthat's crucial 100 percent 100 percent\nso you have a visioning guide so for\nthose listeners I think our agreed-upon\nsuggestion is right begin to practice\nmetacognition incredibly foundational\nstep toward change and then tell us a\nlittle bit about this this really\nhelpful practical I've taken a look at\nit myself guide that you've put together\nfor those listeners who are maybe ready\nto start to shift into creating that\nchange into creating that vibrational\nshift tell me a little bit about this\nthis visioning guide that you are\noffering\nyeah so one of the great things about\nthe visioning guide are just visioning\nwork in general is that you are actually\ncreating the neural pathways in the\nbrain that would support that life in\nadvance of you ever having it so you're\nwriting in present tense you are writing\nin ways that would invoke the feeling\nstate of what it is that you're that you\ndesire and the combination of doing both\nof those things with consistency and\nrepetition like I said it actually does\nin advance of ever having that life\nstructurally change what's happening in\nour brains and so it's extremely\npowerful and and the other sort of fun\npiece of this is that neuroscience and\nyou know various research and studies\nthat have been done is showing that\ndoing that actually dramatically\nincreases the likelihood of you living\ninto that life you actually having that\nlife in reality because you're you're\nset up for it you're a match or you are\naligned with it yeah that's beautiful I\nmean one of the most impactful realities\nthat I was introduced to a bit ago now\nis that our brain or we do not know the\ndifference between the real and the\nimagined and because of the\nneuroplasticity so the ability of our\nbrain to change we can actually start to\nmanipulate those things in absence of\nthem mapping on to the now by just the\npure aspect of thought by using those\ntweaks in language you know speaking as\nif it already is occurring the\nincredible if you're saying the neural\npathways that we can lay down in absence\nof it mapping onto reality right now can\nactually translate into it mapping on to\nreality right now when I learned that\nand like you I'm I'm interested in the\nscience backing in certain some of these\nconcepts I like to know the why and how\nthese things work so when I met that\nwhole line of research and there's\nincredible amounts of it now where\npeople are doing just mental rehearsal a\nlot of times in sports whatever it is\nyou know\nthat reality that if I think enough I\ncan set up the systems in my brain that\nit is as if it is the case and my mind\ndoes not know that I'm just imagining it\nto be or if it really is and for me that\nwas that was a game a game changer that\nrial ways knew the the mind was\nincredibly powerful honestly it's the\nbig reason why I'm in the field that I'm\nin just ever fascinated with the\ncapacities but I don't think it was\nuntil I understood that and that I\nunderstood how powerful our mind really\nreally is and for me that change that\nchanged everything and then it made it\nworth putting in those consistent\nefforts in these type of practices\nwhether it's through writing you know\njournaling as if it's true or a\nmeditation you know kind of stance of\njust envisioning as if it's true\nwhatever it is you know putting that\npractice in really will overtime\ntranslates to creating that in your\nexternal world in a more palpable way so\nthat you can see and I suggest along the\nway to notice because you'll start to\nsee the evidence trickling in you know\nover time you'll start to see you know\nwhatever you were envisioning begin\nlittle by little to map on to what's\nactually happening and in my opinion\nthat's incredibly motivating each and\nevery time I started to create that\nchange just from thought alone into my\nworld that kept me going with this\npractice because then my you know the\nfuture opened up I mean now it's like\nwow this is true whether I'm creating\nchange you know in terms of how my\nphysical body or my my shows of my\nrelationships what I want for my future\nlife in general when I started to see\nthat evidence coming in I mean my mind\nwas blown and I was like okay this is\nthis is very very real so those of you\nlistening when you begin to practice\nthis visioning look begin to watch your\nenvironment for these evidences of\nchange because when you see that I mean\nthat is incredible for me then I feel\nvery powerful and I feel like wow this\nmind of mine is incredible it's really\nreally incredible yeah absolutely and I\nthink you know to sort of come full\ncircle here truly it all does in in a\nbig way relate back to your increasing\nyour level of consciousness because if\nyou don't come\nout of autopilot it's going to be very\nvery difficult to create lasting change\nyeah 100% so this was incredible\ntell us all thank you first and foremost\nfor having this chat the way you're\nshowing up in the virtual world really\nreally is incredible like I said earlier\nthe concepts that you're now talking\nabout in a very practical and\nunderstandable way you think it felt\nvery elusive for a lot of us and the way\nyou show up everyday and you break it\ndown and you're doing the work yourself\nI mean that is inspiration alone but\nit's also I think bridging you know that\nwhich is possible into that which is\nactually practically possible and that\nis very much mirroring my own intention\nfor how to use this space but you just\nwant to say you're doing it beautifully\nespecially with this concept you know\nthat a lot of people would just rather\nbut I don't this is just not for me the\nway you're breaking it down you're\nreally opening up and expanding the\ncollective the possibility that this is\ncollectively for way more than us may\nmore of us than we then we initially\nthought so tell us remind us where we\ncan see you and follow you and get all\nyour goodies yeah yeah so right now I'm\nprimarily on Instagram my handle is your\nnew frequency if you had to the link in\nmy bio there you will find the visioning\nguide and anybody has questions comments\nthoughts I would be more than happy to\nhear them so please definitely do feel\nfree to reach out and thank you\nNichole's so much for having me this has\nbeen fun of course of course I agree\ndefinitely reach out to christina cuz\nshe's incredible with answering\nquestions and clarifying and helping\nsupport each and every one of you on\nyour journey and I am honored to be\nsharing virtual space with her so thank\nyou again"
