    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about people\npleasing what it is and how to break the\nHabit so what is people pleasing people\npleasing is when we do something for\nsomeone else that usually causes us to\nbetray oursel we end up doing this a lot\nof the times because we think that in\npleasing someone else we're keeping\nourselves safe or maybe we're\ncontrolling how the person views us we\nmight fear disconnection we might feel\nlike we're walking on eggshells to avoid\nan explosion so we end up pleasing in\norder to keep connection or to avoid\nthat explosive behavior and because a\nlot of us grew up in homes where we\ndidn't have boundaries where we couldn't\nsay no or where we had to be an adult or\nparent or siblings or the adults around\nus at such a young age that it makes\nsense that we end up developing a\npattern of people pleasing as a result\nand a lot of people want to know what is\nthe difference between people pleasing\nand just being a kind good person the\ndifference is when you're being kind and\nyou make the choice to do something\nwhatever it is you usually end up you\nfeel good you're doing something because\nyou want to support the other person you\nwant to be there for the other person\nyou want to help out on the other hand\nwhen you're doing something to please\nthe other person you usually end up not\nfeeling good you usually end up feeling\nresentful you might even feel like\nyou're being taken advantage of or maybe\nthe entire relationship is unequal and\nvery understandably you end up feeling\nexhausted because you're in this cycle\nof tending to someone else's needs\nbefore your own you usually end up\nacting or doing something to get\nsomething back from someone else or to\navoid a behavior of someone else you're\nnot doing it because you want to so you\ndon't end up feeling good or like a kind\nperson at all so here's an example say a\nperson comes to you with a need or with\na request whatever it might be you might\nnotice that your kneejerk reaction\nbefore you even think about it you hear\nyourself immediately saying yes at the\nsame time ignoring your needs you end up\nthen feeling maybe immediately you're\nsomewhere down the line you feel\nregretful you feel angry you might even\nshame yourself why did I say yes to\ndoing this thing that I don't really\nwant to do and so the cycle continues\nyou're feeling shameful you're feeling\nregretful maybe the same person maybe\nanother person comes to you with another\nrequest right to think you're being a\ngood person you swoop in you do the\nthing that you don't want to do in a\nknee-jerk reaction and then before you\nknow it you're feeling that same shame\nagain all of the while none of your\nneeds are getting met so you can see\nwith this cycle of people pleasing it\nhas truly become a habit we're near\nimmediately saying yes before we even\npause to check in and see how we really\nfeel if we're even available to say yes\nor to do the thing someone who isn't a\npeople pleaser for instance might when\nasked for a request maybe a friend is\ncoming to you and saying hey you know\ncan you watch my dog next weekend\nsomeone who isn't a people pleaser might\ntake a moment might pause might check in\nwith their own schedule might see if\nthey have the time the space and the\nenergy to actually say yes to that\nrequest and if they don't for whatever\nreason they are able to deliver that I\ncan't do this for you right now though\nmaybe I can help you find someone else\nto watch the pet sitter or maybe I have\nsomeone else that I can offer you but I\nhave taken the time not being a people\npleaser to pause to see what's possible\nand then to deliver the truthful\nresponse so using that example the\ndifference between a people pleaser and\nsomeone who isn't a people pleaser when\nyou were able to give your honest\nanswers and not just do something to\nplease someone else you don't walk\naround with a constant feeling of\nanxiety of dread waiting for the next\nrequest and of exhaustion or resentment\nand I imagine a lot of you are\nresonating with this I know I have a\ndeepr rooted habit of being a people\npleaser it is so important to become\naware of this pattern so that you can\nbegin to break it so how do you break\nthe habit of being a people pleaser the\nfirst thing that you want to do to break\nthe Habit is to create SP space or a\npause before you make the same habitual\nchoice and what this can look like and\nas I started breaking my own habit I\nnoticed that I would near immediately\nagree to any plan that anyone offered\nbefore checking in with myself so this\ncreating space can look as simple as\npausing before you say yes taking a\nmoment to actually honestly reflect on\nwhere you're at on where you're energy\nis on whether it's possible and how you\nfeel about the request itself so this\nmight mean taking an extra minute to get\nback to the person delaying your text\nresponse or the phone call so that you\ncan check in and say how do I feel which\nmight mean your communication back to\nthe person who made the request is as\nsimple as I need a moment to think about\nit I'll get back to you on that now\nremember this is a practice even taking\nthat immediate step to pause and create\nspace will probably be uncomfortable for\na lot of you so remember to be kind and\npatient with yourself along the way the\nSecond Step once you've paused you want\nto begin to create or to set new\nboundaries or limits for yourself\nboundaries and limits are really\ndifficult for people Pleasers so this is\nnot going to be easy largely because we\ndidn't learn boundaries in our\nchildhood but boundaries or limits are\nhow we get to break free of this pattern\nso for example right let's say your mom\ncalls you pretty often or a friend\nsomeone calls you pretty often\ncomplaining about things whatever is\ngoing on in their life whatever say is\ngoing on with your dad and you begin to\nrealize that you notice yourself feeling\nreally anxious when you see that\nperson's name mom on your on your call\nlist and then after the conversation you\nmight notice that that anxiety continues\nthroughout the day once the conversation\nis over now you're worried about what's\nhappening between Mom and Dad you might\nnotice in some moments that even though\nyou want to be supportive and there for\nyour mom or the friend or whoever it is\nyou might notice that energetically\nemotionally you might not always be\navailable in the moments where they need\nyou especially if this is someone who's\ncalling you near\nconstantly so you might begin to then\nset a boundary or limit where you are\nable to communicate to this person mom\nwhoever it is you might say something as\nsimple as I understand that you're\nhaving issues with dad with work with\nwhatever and at the same time I also\nknow it's really not my place I cannot\nit's too much for me again whatever\nlanguage resonates with you it is not my\nplace I cannot support you in these\nmoments I have too much going on\nmyself these things upset me to hear\nright whatever is the truth for you and\nthen here's your boundary you may still\ncall Mom in those moments where you need\nme or friend or whomever and my boundary\nwill be in place that if in those\nmoments I'm not available I might\ncommunicate my lack of availability and\nI will call you or get back to you when\nI can when I do have the space when I do\nhave the emotional bandwidth to hear\nthat's what a boundary is to be clear\nit's not us asking mom or dad or\nwhomever not to call anymore it's us\nshifting our relationship setting our\nlimit regardless of if they keep calling\nor if they don't keep calling now this\nis a really great example really\ndifficult one but of these small ways\nthat we can begin to honor our own needs\neven if the person doesn't understand\neven if they get defensive even if they\ndon't like our new boundary we can set\nit for ourself stand in our boundary\ncommunicating to ourself that our needs\nmatter even if this person can't honor\nour needs or our boundaries or our limit\nin that moment and over time the more we\npractice Breaking the Habit creating\nspace setting a boundary the more we'll\nbe able to rebuild our confidence and\nultimately our trust in\nourselves the third step once we've\npaused to create space once we began to\nset some new boundaries for ourself we\nthen want to begin the Journey of\nlearning how to self soothe or to calm\nour upset our disappointment our worry\nour fear whatever on is going on inside\nof us or inside of our body our stress\nor our anxiety we need to teach oursel\nhow to be with it those habitual\nreactions often come when we can't\ntolerate how we feel so we go right into\npleasing mode to avoid the discomfort of\npossibly disappointing someone that we\nlove so ultimately we end up people\npleasing someone else to avoid feeling\nguilty feeling shameful feeling like a\nquote unquote bad person or letting\nsomeone else down as an adult for me\nincluded it has been so important to\nunderstand and to learn that it is okay\nto let someone else down or to\ndisappoint someone else disappointing\npeople is part of the human experience\nwe can't always even if we want to be\npresent to someone else and help support\nthem we don't always have the ability or\nthe emotional bandwidth or the energy to\ndo it we cannot be everything to\neveryone and we will disappoint even\nthose that we love the most this is part\nof being human and again as you practice\nwe will learn more and more ways to be\nwith the anxiety the anger the guilt\neverything we felt that is created the\nhabit of pleasing to avoid it we will\nlearn how to expand our ability our\ncapacity to be with those emotions so\nreally practically self- soothing can\nlook like going for a walk moving your\nbody your arms your legs in whatever is\nways are available to you it might look\nlike journaling getting out into words\nall everything that you're feeling it\nmight look like tucking yourself in to a\ncozy spot on your couch and just giving\nyourself a moment to be to relax to feel\nsafe maybe if you're like me I know I\nfind a lot of soothing in doing\nsomething creative and taking my paints\nout and getting immersed in painting a\npicture without judging what it looks\nlike or going and spending time in\nnature going for a hike these are\nmoments where I'm able to just be\npresent to whatever is there without\nbecoming overwhelmed or consumed by\nwhatever is there and ultimately I end\nup feeling more grounded more connected\nto how I'm feeling and my mind and body\nover time are able to calm and to become\nmore grounded as a result so practically\nself soothing can look like going for a\nwalk moving your arms your legs your\nbody in whatever way is accessible it\ncan even look like journaling getting\nout onto paper everything that you're\nthinking everything that you're feeling\nmight look like just coing up wrapping a\nblanket around you and finding a safe\nplace on your couch just to to be in\ncomfort for a minute or maybe you have a\nfriend you can call and just ask if they\ncan just listen while you vent or you\nget out how it is that you're feeling if\nyou're like me I know anytime I bring\nout something creative like my paints or\nanytime I bring myself into nature like\ngoing on a hike those are moments where\nI'm better able to be out of my head all\nthe stories about what's happening and\ninto my body where I'm able to be\npresent to whatever upsetting emotion is\nhappening and at the same time I'm able\nto do so in a in a way that helps me\nfeel grounded helps me feel safe and\nultimately will help me feel calm on the\nother side of it as opposed to more\nupset because I was so stuck in my mind\na really helpful affirmation that some\nof us can use in these moments to remind\nourselves we can even repeat\naloud I am safe to disappoint people I\ncannot be everything to\neveryone I take care of me you might\nwant to write those down write all three\npick the one you resonate with worse\nwrite your own and use these as a verbal\nreminder even though you might not feel\nthat's true true in the moment your mind\nmight be telling you it's not safe to\ndisappoint someone you have to be\neverything to everyone you are not on\nyour priority list you don't matter\nrepeating these new thoughts over time\nas you are in action creating the space\nthat you need the boundaries that you\nneed tending to your emotions in the way\nthat you\nneed over time you will begin to believe\nthese affirmations is true some of you\nmight want to write it down I know for\nme when I find an affirmation really\nresonating I save it as a background on\nmy phone so every time I click cck my\nphone on I'm reminded of that new mantra\nthat new thought put in a place you can\nsee it and practice these reminders\nespecially in these moments where your\nmind and body are telling you otherwise\nas you're beginning to break what for\nmany of you is a lifelong habit of\npeople pleasing behaviors I have spent\nso many decades of my life stuck in this\npattern of people pleasing so I hope all\nof you people Pleasers out there have\nfound this video helpful and as always I\nwould love to hear from you what are the\ndifferent ways that people pleasing has\nimpacted your life so far and what are\nyou beginning to notice is Shifting and\nis changing as you begin to break this\nhabit for yourself leave it in the\ncomments below"
