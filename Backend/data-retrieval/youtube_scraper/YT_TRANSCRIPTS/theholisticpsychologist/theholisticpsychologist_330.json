    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist here so this video\nis going to be on leaving your habit\nself first I'm going to talk about what\nyour habit self is and then five steps\nto begin to practice breaking out of\nthat habit itself so what is it\nso the habit self is the conditioned\nself from the past so what is\nconditioned our thoughts are conditioned\nour beliefs are conditioned our emotions\nare conditioned for in many ways now\nremember nicely when I say emotions I\nalso mean our body and our body's\nphysiology and our energy and all of\nthose things that are based on that\nconnection between the mind and the body\nalso included are our patterns our\npattern ways of being we are incredibly\nhabitual creatures us humans so whether\nwe're talking about our just behavior or\ndaily habit patterns or our patterns and\nrelationships how we show up how we\nrelate with others how we relate with\nourselves so that's what the habit self\nis because most of us are living our\ndaily life in autopilot and when we are\nin autopilot what is running our\nday-to-day choices is that subconscious\npart of our brain and that's where our\nhabit self lives so unless we start to\nmake a choice to show up differently or\nhave itself is going to be what's\ndictating our daily choices so how do we\nbegin to practice breaking out of our\nhabit self so five steps first is build\na discipline habit muscle which means\ncreating habits whatever they might be I\nalways talk a lot about small daily\npromises a habit starts with one of\nthose a very small promise that we\npractice keeping that's all discipline\nis a stated intention and then the\naction the follow-up of that intention\nso remember when you're setting up your\nintention keep that promise small I use\nthat word for a very particular reason\nthat small daily promise but this takes\npractice it's a new habit we have to\ncreate I am someone who was\nundisciplined in most aspects of my life\nso this was not an easy step that meant\nfor me everyday first starting with one\nsetting that as an intention and keeping\nit despite what might have itself was\ntrying to dictate otherwise so begin to\ncreate habits discipline habits in your\nlife somewhere anywhere one of my\nfollowers one of my community members it\nstarted with a glass of water so that's\na perfectly fine or five minutes of\nsilence could be a great habit that you\nbuild a discipline muscle around number\ntwo future self journal to create\nconsciousness\nso I created a tool those of you who are\nnot yet on my email list might want to\njump on I will link it in the notes\nbelow so you can get these prompts this\nis a way every day I do mine in a\njournal so I just follow those prompts\nevery day every morning and what that is\nit's the habit of two things really of\ncreating an intention so this connects\nback in with one every day I set an\nintention you know to change or to be\ndifferent\nthroughout just that one day that's my\npromise that day journaling in this way\nalso does a second thing it creates\nconsciousness because remember when I'm\nin autopilot my have itself is gonna\ndictate my habits throughout that day\nbehavioral interpersonal emotional\nwhatever it is every morning if I set a\nnew intention of showing up in a\ndifferent way in the world I'm\nactivating consciousness I'm showing up\nnow as that person who gets to choose\nand break out of my habit self which\nmight be the pivotal difference between\nlater that day when I want to keep my\nintention of doing it and not doing it\nmeaning when I created the intention and\nI brought it up to my conscious\nawareness that oh yeah I'm working on\nthis new habit today I might be likely\nlikely more likely to keep that habit\nlater that day number three get past\nmental resistance so this is something I\njust want to throw out there for each of\nyou listening your habit self is going\nto try to argue the case along the way\nso whatever the intention is whatever\nyou would have been doing otherwise as\ndictated by your habit self you're going\nto hear that mental chatter all the\nreasons why not to do this new thing you\nmight even feel uncomfortable doing this\nnew thing it might show up in your body\njust don't feel right or normal because\nyou're doing something unfamiliar so\nfirst and foremost don't anticipate that\nmental resistance isn't there it's going\nto be there\nand again it's gonna take the form of\nall of the thoughts all the reasons why\nnot to do this new thing some of us\nmight get it in our body just feel\nunfamiliar uncomfortable to ourselves\npractice getting past it\npractice showing up is that conscious\nself and keeping that promise to\nyourself to do it anyway and again this\nis just along with the habit of\ndiscipline something that just takes\npractice so up my my resistance is there\nand I'm going to choose to keep this\npromise over here because I know why I'm\ndoing it which brings me to celebrate\nvictories this can be such for a lot of\nus we think this is so inconsequential\nsuch a silly step it's so important each\nand every time you keep whether it's\nyour discipline habit or you keep your\npromise of journaling or you create your\nintention to change and you keep it\nthroughout your day notice celebrate\nyourself celebrate each and every time\nyou do something despite your mental\nresistance telling you not to do it\ncelebrate those victories it can be so\nmotivating and so empowering to help you\nget past that mental resistance the next\ntime and do it again so the final one is\nto begin to recreate or to reframe our\nstories around failure a lot of us have\na relationship with failure that is very\nas I would call cataclysmic meaning if I\ndon't do this one thing this one day\nI've now a washed I'm never going to do\nthis again I'm hopeless I'm helpless I\ncan't change that's not going to set you\nup to have a chance at keeping that\npromise that next day so for a lot of us\nthis journey is reframing those stories\nand something I would always remind to\nmy clients is each moment reminding\nyourself they each moment literally each\nmoment gives you another opportunity to\nmake a new choice so even if you made a\nless than positive choice this past\nmoment this next moment in front of me I\nmight say you know what I am gonna keep\nthat promise I am going to keep my\ndiscipline now but I am going to go\njournal or whatever it is for you so a\nlot of us can do ourselves a great\ndisservice by changing that relationship\nwith failure and by reminding yourself\nactively that each moment really does\nafford you with another opportunity I\nhope you guys found this video helpful\nthose of you aren't
