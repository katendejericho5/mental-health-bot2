    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist here as always\nthank you for tuning in so today's video\nis going to be on friendship boundaries\nlittle backstory I actually was having a\nconversation with a high school friend\nof mine so many years and we haven't\nseen each other in the flesh in a very\nlong time and her and I were talking\nabout a possible overnight that I'll be\nspending at her place and I loved it\nbecause she too is healing so as part of\nour conversation she let me know her\nearly bedtime she also let me know an\nearly plan that she would have to be\ncommitted to that following morning I\nreally appreciated that because I also\nhave an early bedtime and I have no\nproblem getting up and getting out of\nher place that she can carry on with her\nplan I really respected that and it got\nme thinking about boundaries and\nfriendships so why not talk about them I\nbroke down three big categories of\ndifferent types of boundaries that you\nmight be considering in friendships the\nfirst one is conversational real simple\ntopics that are okay or not okay to be\ndiscussed so here might fall you know\nsay family you're going through\nsomething with your family and it's just\nreally raw for you right now maybe you\ndon't really want to be talking about\nfamily things in friendships totally\nokay to say hey friend whomever I really\ndon't want to talk about that topic\nright now this could apply for any topic\nbecause the reality of is we can choose\nthe conversations that we want to engage\nin another thought comes to mind say we\njust went through a breakup and we keep\nshowing up and this one friend is really\nin a well-intentioned way trying to be\nincredibly supportive but we begin to\nnotice that the way that this person is\noffering us support it's the badmouth\nour ex and while for some of us that\nmight feel good you know maybe we feel\nangry and we're you know getting those\nemotions out not all the time would that\nfeel good for each of us so if I come\nhome from time spent with that friend\nand I begin to realize I see where she's\ncoming from she thinks she's supporting\nme but actually every time I hear about\nmy ex in this negative way it brings me\ndown completely appropriate to say hey\nfriend I know you're trying to be\nsupportive but maybe we don't talk\nabout my ex for a little bit those are\nexamples of conversational boundaries\nnext type of boundary you might consider\nin a friendship is consumption what I\ncall consumption boundaries so things or\nenergy again that we might choose to be\nor to not be around so some of you out\nthere if you're navigating a new\nrelationship say with alcohol this might\nbe a conversation with your friends you\nknow hey I'm trying to avoid or limit my\nalcohol intake so maybe I don't want to\nbe around bar type settings or happy\nhours anymore maybe I might offer that\nnature or something outside is more\nalong the lines of what I'm interested\nin doing now same thing goes in terms of\nour emotions and our mood if we're\nfeeling down\nmaybe we're interested in consuming\nsomething light or light hearted a funny\nmovie it's okay to express these once\nand needs in friendships included so if\nthere are places that you find yourself\nexpending energy or things that you find\nthis one particular friend always\noffering come to the table with a new\nsuggestion it's okay to have a boundary\nup around the things that we want to\nconsume even in our friendships another\ntype of boundary that I think is really\nimportant is what I call energetic\nboundaries essentially that just limits\nlimits on what we can and what we cannot\ngive give meaning emotional bandwidth\nenergy really pretty much anything now a\nlot of you listening of course many of\nus want to show up and be supportive of\nour friends however we have to\nacknowledge where we are energetically\nand emotionally because we cannot always\nexpect ourselves when we're going\nthrough a stressful time period to be\nable to pick up or to want to pick up\nthat call from that friend to hear about\nwhat is going on in their life we are\nall on different rhythms and when we are\njust and we don't have our emotional\nbandwidth available to us or our\nresources it is really okay to just\nacknowledge that to your friend hey\nfriendless and I really want to be\nsupportive to you I just am in a bad\nplace right now I need to take care of\nme another example that comes to mind\ncan be around our triggers so for in\nif we have been cheated on and say we're\nstill in that raw period you know\ngrieving the wounds that oftentimes\ninfidelities bring up then we come to\nfind out a good friend of ours also has\nbeen cheated on so it might be you know\nintuitive for the two of us to get\ntogether and talk about how we've been\ncheated on and how much that hurts it\ndoesn't mean that's gonna feel good for\neach of us hearing my friend and what\nhas happened in my friends relationship\nmight be completely overwhelming for me\nmight bring and bring up all of my own\nemotions that are just too much and\nthat's okay to to that friend you could\njust offer a listen friend I really want\nto support you I'm just I'm going\nthrough it too you know maybe you can go\nto a third friend at this time so just\ngiving some thought these are incredibly\nimportant boundaries they are completely\nappropriate in terms of friendship and\nall of these are up for negotiation the\nmore we can communicate with our friends\nacknowledge the areas that don't feel so\ngreat in their relationship and offer a\nsolution that works for both parties\nwill lead to the more fulfilling\nfriendships that we can each have"
