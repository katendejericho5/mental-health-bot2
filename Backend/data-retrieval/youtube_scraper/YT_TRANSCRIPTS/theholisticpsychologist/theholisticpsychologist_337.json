    "transcript": "hello everyone dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist here as always\nthank you for tuning in so today's video\nis going to be on the concept that I\ntalk about often which is called\nemotional addiction so I'm gonna dive\ninto what exactly that is but first I'm\ngoing to share with you my journey to\ndiscovering this concept and really\ngiving it this name so when I first\nbegan my clinical training I did a lot\nof work in substance use treatment\ncenters\nI ran groups in particular for\nindividuals and differing stages of\ntheir recovery recovery journey and\nduring these groups we would talk a lot\nabout their pasts and their histories\nand the development of what they would\neventually call an addiction we talked a\nlot about their use behaviors and then\nof course we spend a lot of time talking\nabout the consequences of their using\nwhatever substance it was and what I\nfound was that globally while yes when\nwe're ingesting a substance there are\nphysiological changes that most of us\nrefer to as being high that differs\ndepending on the substance that we're\nusing understandable but what I began to\nrealize is that what we were really\ntalking about regardless of the\nsubstance that we were using we were\nreally talking about the emotions that\nwere part of that whole process the\nemotions leading up to the desire to use\nthe emotions of acquiring you know the\nsubstance that I'm going to use and then\nthe emotions that met me on the other\nside of my use and what I came to\nrealize is that that was part of the\nstory of addiction and then more\nsurprisingly when I evolved my practice\nand I was working with individuals and I\nwent through my whole wakening period\nand I became really conscious of myself\nand my own patterns what I came to\nrealize is that I - and many of my\nclients had what I call an emotional\naddiction even in absence of using any\nsubstance that a lot of us humans are\nquite literally addicted\na sense to emotion so what do I mean so\nI've called it the hid emotion we become\nhabituated or used to an emotion in\nparticular that could be anything could\nbe sadness it could be anger it could be\nstress so for me I'm gonna use myself as\nan example and I think one that a lot of\nyou might relate to as a child I grew up\nin a very chaotic feeling stressful\nenvironment a lot of stress a lot of the\ntime very overwhelming but it became my\nnormal with stress so I'm gonna use this\nthis example particular though all\nemotions map onto actual changes in the\nbody there are hormones that get\nreleased neurotransmitters our body's\nenergy shifts and changes so using the\nstress example being a young child being\nin a stress inducing environment my body\nbegan to release very frequently because\nI was very frequently stress hormones\nlike cortisol and adrenaline that\nactually maps on to a physiological\nchange in my body so does anger so does\nsadness whatever feeling you might come\nto the awareness is your emotional\naddiction they all affect our body and\nthey all result in physiological changes\nin our body so that coursing through my\nbody that became a chemical cocktail or\nit produced a high it produced up a\nspace of emotion that I became so\nfrequently used to experiencing it\nbecame a normal in a sense and it became\nthe emotion that I fell so I became very\nused to feeling a degree of stress all\nthe time and my body became very used to\nfeeling a degree of stress all the time\nwhich led to what we called\ndesensitization meaning I need it more\nand more stress to register a feeling my\nfeeling that I was most familiar with\nbeing stress so our brain now our mind\nif you will gets gets wind of our\nfamiliar and for me my familiar remember\nwas stress so we have a part in our\nbrain it is called the reticular\nactivating system short and simple it's\nour minds filter because the\nany of it is if I took in every piece of\ninformation available to me in this\nmoment right now I would be debilitated\nI wouldn't be able to process at all so\nwhat I had to do is I had to my brain\nhas to make sense of what's relevant for\nme and my life experience and what's not\nso because I got used to certain level\nof stress hormone\nI needed that level to feel normal to\nmyself and I need it more to have a\nfeeling so what my reticular activating\nsystem did is it began to filter to my\nexperience all stressful experiences all\nthings that could possibly stress me out\nand I got really used to noticing that\nso I would walk through my life not in\nyour notching the things that would give\nme that hit of emotion and when this\nbecame really clear to me and I want to\nshare this because I know it resonates\nwhen I share this experience became\nreally clear to me when daily life\nevents I live alongside of partners as\nshe gets to observe me and my experience\nis a lot they would be stressful\nno no arguments here small life stresses\nwould happen however I would be thrown\ninto an over-reactive tizzy for\nseemingly small things and as this would\nhappen time and time again\nshe sat me down one day and she said you\nknow Nicole I don't think you mean I\ndon't think you're that frazzled when\nthese things happen and she really spoke\nto me because the truth was I didn't but\nmy body was so used to the hit of panic\nof chaos that it took forgetting like\nlosing my key or miss filing a piece of\nmail it took that as the reason to\ncreate that level of stress in my body\neven if me and my conscious awareness\ndid not mean it I wasn't really that\nupset so how do we get out and how do we\nbreak out of these patterns now as I\nalways say there is no quick fix but\nwith consciousness with showing up as\nthat observational self where I can in\nthose moments say you know Nicole it\nreally is only a piece of mail and then\nif stress is your hit emotion I did\nvideo last week how to balance your body\nthrough stress because remember these\nare real events in our body so they to\nheal our emotional addictions are two\nsteps consciousness so I can make new\nchoices\nnot those age-old reactions so for me\nrunning screaming around like a chicken\nwith my head cut off not helpful to\nanyone but we also need to integrate\ndaily body regulatory tools then as well\nso I hope you guys found this helpful a\nlot of a struggle with emotional\naddiction and there really is a way out\nfirst and foremost being conscious and\nobserving and discovering for yourself\nwhat that hit emotion might be"
