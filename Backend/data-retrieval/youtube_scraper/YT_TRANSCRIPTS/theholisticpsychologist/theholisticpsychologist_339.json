    "transcript": "this video is three steps on how to\nbegin to heal self-betrayal so first\nwhat is self betrayal self betrayal is a\npattern that most of us\nas adults have carried from childhood\nwhen when we were younger we have had to\ndevelop a habit of betraying our self in\norder to feel loved or accepted by the\nmost important people around us who were\nusually our caregivers so what we did\nover time as we learn to either put our\nones our needs secondary or some for\nsome of us not even on a priority list\nin service or in favor of showing up\nfirst and foremost for others that we\nare in relationship with so as adults we\nlive that pattern meaning we tend to\neither not be connected to our own wants\nand needs and or we don't feel like we\nhave a right to satisfy our own wants\nand needs as a priority this usually\nends in lack of self-confidence lack of\nself-esteem and sometimes a pretty\nnegative behavioral habit so how do we\nbegin to heal first and foremost we want\nto begin to set a very small promise to\nourselves daily when I say very small I\nmean so small it almost seems\ninsignificant a lot of us had an\nexpectation bar up way too high that\nbefore we know it our only option really\nis to disappoint our self when I meet\nsmall I need one minute of meditation or\nbreath work one minute five minutes two\nminutes even of journaling waking up so\nsay you want to create a morning habit\ndon't set the alarm for an hour earlier\nthan you typically wake up set 15\nminutes earlier one home-cooked meal\nsetting the expectation bar so so low\nessentially that it sets us up to\nsucceed to keep those promises because\nremember the word I'm always talking\nabout is consistency it's not gonna help\nwe're not gonna be I'll really heal that\nself betrayal by keeping the small\npromise once every 5 10 7 days we really\nhave to begin to practice as each day so\nthe more attainable the expectation that\nwe set for ourselves the more likely\nwe're going\nbe able to do it so please keep that\npromise I know I did myself so small and\nthen notice meaning acknowledge yourself\nthat you did that one minute of breath\nwork or you made that one home-cooked\nmeal during the week and resist any and\nall urge to minimize it I know a lot of\nus live with a very critical voice in\nour head do not pay attention if it\ntries to diminish or tell you it was\nonly one meal and you're not doing\nenough right that attention that I'm\nalways talking about remove your\nattention from those voices do not feed\nor diminish what you just did for\nyourself but do not forget to notice so\noften we just do the thing and by the\nend of the day we are focusing so much\non what we didn't do throughout the day\nthat all of these beautiful promises are\ngetting lost so just make it a habit of\nkeeping that small promise and noticing\nnot minimizing it and then the third\nstep celebrate meaning accumulate this\nis not going to be immediate these small\npromises I'm gonna let you know right\nnow aren't going to shift your\nexperience of life or your emotions or\nbreak your patterns in one day but I\nassure you they will over time so begin\nto notice look for those small changes\nas they accumulate acknowledge even\nthose for yourself that will go a long\nway to keep you motivated to keep that\nnext small promise that next day so I\nhope you guys found this video helpful 3\nsmall steps a lot of us suffer from that\nself betrayal and over time we can\nreally begin to accumulate and rebuild\nthat self-confidence in ourselves"
