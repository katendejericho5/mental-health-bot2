    "transcript": "hi everyone doctor Nicola para the\nholistic psychologist here so today's\nvideo is going to be on a very important\ntopic which is attachment first I'm\ngoing to talk a little bit about\nattachment and how attachments develop\nand how we carry then those patterns of\nrelating and interacting in relationship\nwith others into our adulthood and then\nI'm going to overview the four big\ndifferent types of attachment styles we\nas humans are all wired to connect first\nand foremost with our earliest\ncaregivers so thinking about it\nlogically we need our caregivers our\ncaregivers when we're very young infants\nhelp meet our physical needs they feed\nus they change us we quite literally\nneed them to physically survive we also\nneed them to help us to emotionally\nregulate ourselves because again is\nlittle baby infants we can't do that on\nour own\nso each and every one of you listening\nhas come to this planet with that wiring\nwe need to connect and we look to do so\nwhat happens is we engage in\nrelationships with these caregivers and\nagain the caregiving environments that\neach and every one of us were born into\nlook different for each of us but\nwhomever who at whomever's it was that\nwere our primary caregivers we learn to\nconnect and we experience connections\nwith those humans in those relationships\nand then we replicate that's our model\nfor our relationship so what do we learn\nfrom those early humans we learn how to\ninteract we learn how to emotion how\nemotions exist in relationships and we\nlearn how to communicate in\nrelationships we learn how to cope with\nenvironments again a lot a big function\nof our early caregivers is helping us to\nnavigate the world and navigate our\nenvironments we can't do that on our own\nwe also learn how to recover from stress\nin particular I call that that ability\nto recover from stress I call emotional\nresilience\nso all these three major functions are\nmodeled to us and experienced by us in\nour earliest of relationships and then\nlike I said they carry effects in our\nadult relationships over\nI'm so I want to overview the three the\nfour major attachment style so the first\none is what we call secure I kind of M\ndubbing this the autonomous adult this\nis essentially through our healing\njourneys what each of us are striving\nfor so what that looks like in childhood\nis it looks like having a caregiver or\ncaregivers that were able to tolerate\ntheir own stress or able to tolerate\nstress in the relationship between\ncaregiver and infant and we're able to\nremain attune at more or less all times\nto their child and oftentimes what is\ntheir child's differing emotional needs\nin each and every moment those of us who\nexperience that secure attachment and in\nour very young early relationships in\nadulthood we become the adult who can\nspend time alone who can navigate our\nemotions on our own and also can\ncommunicate and can relate to emotions\nand emotional experiences of others in\nrelationship so the perfect example of\nthis is you know in childhood if you had\na caregiver that was was regulated\nenough that when you were in distress\nthey showed up for you for your distress\nand helped you come up with the ways\nthat worked for you as a unique\nindividual that you are to tolerate\nwhatever stress it was the sadness the\nanger fast-forwarding in time then you\nbecome the adult who has their own\nemotional states in their relationships\nthat they're in can tolerate their own\nemotions and of course if and when they\nwant to bring those emotions to the\nrelationship table if you will they have\nthe language and they know how to\ncommunicate they also are able to give\nthat space to their partner's friends or\nwhomever is they can allow other humans\nto navigate their emotions on their own\nmoving into the next type of attachment\nstyle is what we call insecure or avoid\nit so in childhood what that looks like\nis having a caregiver that is\ndisconnected and of course this lays on\na spectrum with how disconnected but\nmore or less disconnected from physical\nand emotional connection this leaves\nthen the child to navigate their emotion\non their own having that pattern or that\nmodeling in childhood is carried into\nour adulthood and looks like for that\nnow human that adult human it looks like\nthem having a disconnect often between\ntheir own emotional world so how they're\nfeeling inside and essentially what\nthey're doing or how they're relating to\nothers outside this is also then the\nadult who becomes or who is a little\nless sensitive to the social or the\nemotional cues of any other of their you\nknow colleague of their friend and\ndefinitely then of their intimate\npartner so in terms of examples of this\none I am a very living breathing example\nof this type of attachment style I had a\nmother who was very emotionally\ndisconnected again living on her own\nmodeling and her own attachment styles\nfrom childhood but that left me very\nalone to navigate very very big feelings\non my own so not only was my mom my mom\nwasn't really a handsy you know kind of\nphysically loving caregiver I mean I got\nmy needs met of course I survived but\nyou know I wasn't you know kind of all\nof my physical needs weren't you know\nshe wasn't super fully attuned to put it\nthat way in terms of emotional needs she\nwas really on the other end of the\nspectrum in terms of disconnect meeting\nnot really available to me to help me\nnot attune to my emotional needs and\ntherefore not really able to help me\nnavigate my emotions on my own so fast\nforward in time I now became the adult\nwho really struggled with in my own\nemotional needs I could have to\nillustrate this point you know a\ndisconnect between my emotional my inner\nemotions in my outer I could have a\nwhole lot of things happening internally\nexternally you might not know or if you\nare aware that something's going on with\nthe externally you're not experiencing\nme as kind of seeking or looking for\nreassurance or looking for support\nbecause again I'm replicating that model\nI didn't have that and have someone\nshowing up for me in childhood helping\nme with my emotions and truth be told\nand this might sound surprising to some\nof you guys listening because I'm in the\nfield of emotions if you will I had a\nhard time especially I could do this in\nwork I was very attuned\nto others and their emotional experience\nin my job but when it came to in my\nrelationships I had a really hard time\nbeing fully attuned and attentive to say\neven my partner's emotional world again\nbecause I wasn't aware and navigating my\nown emotional world so I'm a prime\nexample of this type of attachment style\nthe next one is what we call insecure\nanxious so in childhood what that looks\nlike is a Miss attunement between the\nchild's needs and the caregivers we're\nmore often than not the caregiver is\nresponding to their needs first and\nforemost so say for instance I know this\ncould sound a little complicated mom is\nin a bad mood right and child is looking\nfor love instead of responding to the\nchild's attempt at love Mama's gonna be\nresponding to her bad mood first and do\nwhatever mom does when she is in a bad\nmood so that's what that means in terms\nof the missive Tumut to the child's\nneeds with the caregiver putting\ncaregivers needs first\noftentimes that then looks like\nunpredictability or inconsistency\nbecause think about it logically\ncaregiver is responding to the natural\nflow of the caregivers emotions so on\ngood days to really simplify it\ncaregiver is there and may be attentive\nin attune so they are showing up\nsometimes days where the the caregiver\nis not in a good emotional place that\nmight be the days where that there's\nthat more in predict unpredictability or\ninconsistency so in adulthood that looks\nlike a tendency to override one's own\nemotional needs this is what I hear I\nthink of this kind of attachment style\nleads to the adult who's calling\nthemselves the helper the caregiver\nwhere they very consistently with what\nthey experienced in childhood begin to\nput other people's needs and emotional\nneeds in particular first it's this kind\nof mindset that if you're okay whoever\nyou may be I'm okay because that's\nexactly what they experienced in\nchildhood when mom was okay we might\nhave had a great relationship this is\nwhy this is can be really confusing so\nsimilar than an adulthood I approach my\nrelationships with trying to make sure\neveryone else is okay so that then I can\nfeel\nokay myself oftentimes of course this is\nme doing a disservice to my own\nemotional needs because there are might\nbe days where I'm not feeling okay and I\ncannot wait for someone else to be okay\nto allow me to then you know kind of be\nable to tolerate whatever is going on\nfinal attachment style is what we call\ninsecure disorganized so in childhood\nthis oftentimes looks like a caregiver\nwho is a combination of either a\nneglectful the press traumatized or\nabusive you know this can be you know\nthere's kind of big T's of trauma that\nwe often think about the messaging here\nfor the child is very confusing it's\ncontradictory in a sense because it's\nnot safe when the caregiver is in that\nabusive or a lot of times substance use\nsubstance abusive behaviors fall under\nthis category so on the one hand there\nare many occasions you know where if the\ncaregiver is the abuser in a sense it's\nnot safe for the child to be in relation\nwith them but because of the state of\nthe child and their physical\ndependencies or emotional dependencies\nit's also not safe for them to run away\nto not be with a core caregiver so very\npush-pull kind of contradictory\nemotional experience for the child who\nthen becomes the adult that is still\nunable to distinguish between danger and\nsafety and relationships in particular\nthey have a desire just like we all do\nto connect but they have a really hard\ntime differentiating whether or not that\nperson or that relationship is actually\na safe place to connect to or if similar\nto their past experiences it might not\nbe as safe as it appears on the surface\nthis also translates to an overarching\ninability for that for that adult to\nregulate their own emotional state\noftentimes they're feeling very\ncontradictory and therefore very\nconfusing emotions so I hope you guys\nlistening found help in this video able\nto understand why we talk about\nattachment styles and how those earliest\nrelationships with our caregivers really\ndo affect us and really do become those\nirons that were you replicate and this\nis across relationships we might see\nourself engaging in that patterning in\nour work relationships and our\nfriendships and definitely probably\nthose of us who are in romantic\nrelationships in those as well it is\nalso helpful I hope for you guys to be\nable to give some thought into which of\nthese categories you might fall into and\nthen begin to explore for yourself\nhow they might be affecting you into\nyour adult relationships so I know I\ndidn't go into what to do next I'm\ndefinitely going to continue to put out\ncontent on this topic so stay tuned and\nI will start to then explore how to\nbegin to navigate and change these\nrelational styles thank you so much for\ntuning in"
