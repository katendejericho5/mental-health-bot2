    "transcript": "hello everyone dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist Here I am\nincredibly excited for this conversation\nthat I'm getting ready to have with\nsomeone who has been a mentor for me in\nmy not only my own healing journey but\nin my my clinical practice and shifting\nthe way that I work entirely so I'm here\ntoday with Kelly Brogan and I am just\nbeyond honored you were the first person\nthat I ever saw working holistically\ntrained conventionally she's a medical\ndoctor came through more or less the\nsame chute of training that I have but\nreally turned my world upside down so\nI'm beyond honored to have dr. Brooke in\nhere today thank you for having a chat\nwith me Kelly it feels so good to\nconnect I'm really excited to be here\nawesome so you have an amazing new book\nout it's similar to a lot of the\nconcepts that I talked about really\nground it with this idea the word I\noften uses in empowerment and a big part\nof the goal of what I'm doing online\nthrough this whole shift in the way that\nI work is to begin to give the humans\nout their tools to understand that they\nare well beyond capable of doing some\nvery deep level healing and the word\nthat you use and I love it so much is is\nreclamation or reclaiming and that is\nthe title of your new book so tell us a\nlittle bit about what your guess mindset\nis on this whole concept of of\nreclaiming the self yeah so I think we\nshare a mission and I like to sort of\nencapsulate it by describing what I feel\nto be the importance of sharing\ninformation and educating around\ninformed consent when it comes to the\ndominant orthodoxy around treatment so\nwhat do we what do we enculturated to\nbelieve is like the best most effective\ntreatment for any given illness or\nsyndrome and then also providing people\nwith the tools to heal in ways that they\nmight not have been told was possible by\nthat very system that makes those\nprimary recommendations\nthe reason I've come to this is you know\nas we do through my own health journey\nthrough my own diagnosis of a chronic\nillness that I basically chose to listen\nto that small voice that said no thanks\nyou know to lifetime prescribing I knew\nwhat conventional medicine had to offer\nI could have written my own\nprescriptions and I just wanted a\ndifferent way and so committed myself\nyou know as you have to really lighting\nthat that path but I think we have this\nidea that kind of like getting you know\nI think we have this feeling right like\nall of us right now that it's like time\nto level up like it's time to really\nshow up in a different way to our\nproblems and to orient around our life\nfrom a different perspective because the\nold way the habitual way the reflexive\nway is becoming more and more like\nbereft on fulfilling and maybe worse\nlike maybe we're finding ourselves just\nwith like one challenge after another\nafter another and it's like morass of\nadversity and I think we still imagine\nthat the mandate is to like get it\ntogether and be in control and sort of\nlike show up a boss you know in your\nlife and we think that that means like\nholding the mask on really tight and\nputting extra tape around it and you\nknow strings that rosin me but I think\nthat some of us are developing this\nsense and maybe the inner knowing that\nowning ourselves that that kind of\npersonal authority looks different than\nwe might have imagined and it involves a\nkind of vulnerability it involves\nbreaking habits that maybe at one point\nhad us feel comforted or strong or even\nsafe you know and and moving into these\nnew territories exploring what we were\nrunning from and so so you know when I\ntalk about illness and and specifically\naround what's been labeled as mental\nillness I I use this analogy like you\nknow it's like if this scary man was\nlike\nrunning after you right and and you\nwould do anything not to let him catch\nyou right you jump off a cliff but like\nwhat if you just turn towards him and\nyou were like what do you want peace I\ngot this letter for you\nyou absolutely need it's like unlocking\nthe secret to your existence right and\nyou never would have known that if you\njust kept running so there's a way of\norienting around struggle and crisis and\nspecifically as pertains to our help\nthat can really unlock an entire pathway\ntowards self ownership and and really\nengage the process of self-discovery\nbecause I think you would agree that's\nprobably another definition of wellness\nright is engaging the process of\nself-discovery week we want to know\nabout this you know we want to learn\nabout this and in conventional medicine\nthat's not even really something that\nfigures in to the treatment plan right\nthis concept of you know sort of delving\ninto the catacombs of what makes you you\nit's just a matter of getting those\nannoying symptoms dangerous symptoms I\nthink Campinas experiences like out of\nthe picture yes I could not agree more I\nlove that visual about wrapping just\ntrying to keep the mask on and I\ncouldn't agree more I think that whether\nor not we're talking symptom management\nphysical or emotional symptoms I think\ntoo many of us for far too long have\nbeen putting on an external brave face\nor medicating the symptoms or just\ntrying to manage all of the surface this\nthat's that we living and I lived this\nexperience myself one of my biggest\ngo-to coping mechanisms was associating\nso I say that I say that some of us I\nthink it's so distanced from our\nfeelings and what's driving what's\ncoming out all over the place in many\ndifferent ways with them the focus being\nokay let's keep whatever is driving it\nreally tucked away it feels unsafe it\nfeels vulnerable and let's just continue\nto try to soothe or medicate what's\nbursting out of the\nhop and quite honestly I agree with you\nI think people are done with that and\nintuitions are waking up and I believe\nthat a large reason that my Instagram\nhas grown as exponentially as it has is\nthat testament is that we're starting to\nrealize that these these band-aids just\nare no longer working and I felt that in\nmy own practice for a really long time\nhe felt the talk therapy model the\nmedication there are really two options\nthat we were given in seven plus years\nof training I thought that they were\nlargely missing the underlying driving\nforces or driving symptoms of it and I\njust think that we're ready I love you\nyour view is very similar to my own I\ncall our emotions teachers they have\nincredible value for us especially when\nyou're finding ourselves up against the\nsame type habitually whether it's the\nanxieties or the depressions or the\nangers or whatever is driving it there\nis meaning there and I love that turning\naround and saying okay well what is this\nlet me understand what's really going on\nwhether it's in my physiological body or\nin these emotions that I never looked at\nI felt so overwhelmed by and I just I\nlove the way that you you conceptualize\nit and I could not agree more and what I\nsaw the word I heard a million times a\nweek even in my old practice was stuck\nyeah way I fell it's my whole life\nwas stuck so I really had to put a\nspotlight and start and try to\nunderstand and that really was that\nniggle that I knew all along is we're\nall stuck because we're not looking at\nwhat's really causing or driving these\nthese issues absolutely and you know I\nwould I would add that I think most\npeople who end up being captured by the\nmedical system whether it's\npsychiatrically or otherwise have this\nmomentary validation right that that\nthey are indeed broken maybe because I\nthink so many of us walk around with\nthis deep secret that we really feel\nthat something is wrong with us and we\nhope that we can paper that over so that\nnobody will notice and we'll never have\nto encounter you know that deep dark\nthought again so when the medical system\nsays yes you do have a chemical\nimbalance yes you do have a an illness\nthat runs in your family so take your\nmedication and be a good patient there's\nsome little part of us that says oh you\nsee I knew I was messed up right and and\nwe don't understand what it is to then\nsurrender our our power to a system that\nlabels us as such you know when you open\nthat prescription bottle it has your\nname on it there is a subliminal\nmessaging that says yep you can't fix\nthis yourself you know you and every\nsingle day you're exposed to that and so\na lot of what I think you know we're\ndoing and I my advocacy represents it's\njust turning that on its head and not\njust for fun or to be controversial but\nreally because I'm witnessed firsthand\nthat those who are labeled and\nparticularly those who are\npsychiatrically medicated are some of\nthe most exquisitely complex sensitive\nand even powerful individuals on this\nplanet and I've witnessed that over and\nover and over again that once they are\nliberated once they enter into their\nhealing process these gifts emerge from\nthem\n[Music]\nthat they have to magnetize light you\nknow to their lives is so humbling and\nit's something like you know what what\nKrishnamurti says that it's it's no sign\nof health to be well adapted to a\nprofoundly sick Society so is it\npossible that these individuals are\nthrough their symptoms right so whether\nit's poor concentration sleep\ndisturbance you know low energy\nsuicidality you know brain fog whether\nit's you know all sorts of strange\nphysical symptoms like hair loss and\nbloating and rashes and pain or whether\nit's psychosis or symptoms of mania is\nit possible that they are expressing a\nvery real imbalance and that's their\nsignature means of expressing and\nresponding to what is off right so that\nlist of what's off right now is very\nlong and that's because I think you\nprobably agree I think we're at this\nlike really incredible inflection point\nof a shift of collective change and like\nthe old model has run its course it\nserves for a period of time the old\nmodel of force and control and tamping\ndown what feels scary and now we're\nwe're being ushered into the new model\nbut we're kind of in the in-between\nright and so we need these these\nindividuals to begin to turn towards\nthemselves begin to develop self mastery\nand begin to express their gifts in in a\nway that that serves the collective and\nserves their own healing maybe even\nbreaking lineage level cycles right how\nmany of those who've been labeled\nmentally ill are the black sheep and\ntheir family it's it's almost to a\nperson right and so might it be that\nthey're here sensitive in the way that\nthey are in order to learn how to wield\nthat power in service of literally\ngenerations of trauma dysfunction and\npainful you know patterning so you know\nI I like to when you when you refer to\nkind of like what's driving it if\nhave the audacity to ask the question\nyou know why is someone experiencing\nsymptoms you know which is not a part of\nthe rubric of conventional medical care\nwe don't ask why we just manage and if\nwe're going to ask why you know they're\ngoing to be as many reasons as there are\nindividuals right because it's their\native it's your journey it's your\npersonal experience of you know\ndiscovery and that's why you know it's\ninteresting as a sidebar like you uh a\nwoman the the patients that I've treated\nwhen we complete treatment because I\nthink that should be the goal of any\nresponsible practitioners care right\nthere should be a completion point or\nyou let them go they say I finally feel\nlike myself thinking the first site\ncouple times I heard that I remember\nthinking like why do you want to feel\nlike you're still okay that doesn't\nsound like we accomplished much mm-hmm\nyou know because I saw what they want to\nfeel strong and pretty and you know we\njust want to feel like we are inhabiting\nthis skin properly right like like we\nknow what to do with this like we have\nread the owner's manual of our\npersonhood right and so so it's it's\nhelped me to understand like if that's\nthe goal how do we take the invitation\nof symptoms to begin to answer the\nquestion why to understand how it fits\ninto your narrative meaningfully and so\nI you know I like to sort of like lay\nout an order of operations and that's\nnot to say it's the only one you know\nthere are obviously so many ways to to\nengage your healing process but I am a\nbig proponent of you know beginning to\nreally fortify the physical body and the\nheal the nervous system so that you can\nhave this liberated energy this shift in\nperspective that allows you to fully\nengage your toxic relationships that job\nthat's totally unfair\nall the elements of your daily lifestyle\nchoices that are fundamentally at odds\nwith what you on a soul level believe\nyourself to be entitled to and maybe\nthen begin to work with you know\nchildhood traumas and lineage level\npatterning of you know pain and so you\nknow there's that kind of hierarchy then\nthe beginning steps can be very basic\nyou know sometimes you can be diagnosed\nwith major depression or OCD or ADHD\nlet's say and or even schizophrenia you\nknow and and you can literally have\ngluten antigenicity or a b12 deficiency\nor hypothyroidism or it could be a\nreaction to another medication whether\nit's you know birth control pill or even\nan acid blocker or an antibiotic and it\ncould be blood sugar imbalances leading\nto your six panic attacks a day maybe\nyou don't need to go on a massive\nheroines journey you know into your\nspiritual catacombs maybe not maybe\nthat's what your body was asking you to\nattend to and it's so reversible in the\nspace of weeks you know that that why\ndon't we start there with like what I\ncall the low-hanging fruit of engaging\nin this self-care ritual that has the\ncapacity to reverse the symptoms of what\nmight be chronic illness I could not\nagree more and I nothing something that\nalways didn't sit really comfortably\nbecause what we do learn in school is\nthis emphasis on the empirically\nvalidated which would in one way or\nanother the manualized treatments a\nstudy where those that they're listening\nthe way scientific research happens is\nyou need to have things universal enough\nto be studied so the way that it is as\nthings become manual is CBT is the\nbiggest manual\nI think treatment that we're taught not\nthat something about that never really\nsat comfortably I don't believe humans\nfit into a manual I believe in\nindividualized nature because to speak\nto your point and I conceptualize it\nsimilarly sometimes some of the\nsymptoms that were experiencing are\ndirectly related to physiological\nimbalances so for me that was part of my\nstory and until I had my body and a much\nmore balanced state with my nervous\nsystem included because I had a lot of\nchronic and this is something I often\nspeak about I think it's important to\nexpand what we're typically taught as\ntrauma the big t the the glaring\ninstances of abuse or neglect because I\ndidn't check necessarily those boxes but\nemotionally I had a completely accident\nmother chronically a lot of anxiety and\nhealth related concerns in my family so\nreally simple too big of feelings for a\ntoo little of a human that I was to cope\nwith so before I knew it I did carry\nthat nervous system over activation that\nmade it incredibly difficult for me to\neven dive into the deeper level of\nhealing so honestly Kelley it was when I\nheard one of your interviews speaking\nabout these hormonal and physiological\nimbalances and blood sugar this\nregulation that I had no idea about we\nare the gut nutrition this is not even\nspoken about in any program I mean I\nguess logically why because we are very\nmuch still in a conventional system of\nseparateness yes mine is separate from\nthe body so make sense that body is not\ntouched so you really introduced me to\nsome lifestyle changes I I got my sleep\nin order I changed the nutrition that I\nwas eating I really was able to gain\nphysiological balance and I don't\nbelieve that I would have been able to\ndo the deeper level of the inner child\nwork that I now evolved into a my own\nhealing journey without and I think a\nlot of people listening or than seeing\nboth we're just so disregulated\nphysiologically hormonal ER in our\nnervous system over activation of either\nof those the parasympathetic or the\nsympathetic nervous system that we don't\nhave that solid foundation as I call it\nto do the deeper work even more\nfrustrating and I would find that in\nmore off almost all to be honest of the\nclients that I worked with and so for me\nit wasn't until I really understood that\ninterconnectedness and I addressed my\nlow-hanging fruit to use your language\nthat I wasn't able to progress into the\ndeeper level of healing that I think a\nlot of us want to a need to do but\nwithout that foundation as I call it I\ndon't think it's possible so I agree\nwith you in terms of getting some basic\nsystems back maybe our body wants to be\nbalanced so sometimes it's a matter of\nremoving yeah the activities or the\nthings that are keeping us in balance\nbefore I think we can progress in our\nhealing yeah I call it like sending a\nsignal of safety right so it's like this\nreset or or or reboot and to your point\nI mean it's exactly it's the good and\nbad news is that you're in control but\nonly you know what you need there are\nmyriad healing modalities out there I\nmean you can use homeopathy essential\noils acupuncture Reiki I mean it's\nincredible time the menu is huge right\nand you can allow yourself to be totally\ninundated it overwhelmed confused\nlooking for that expert who's gonna tell\nyou what to do or you can begin to\ncultivate a relationship with your inner\ncompass and when I first sort of came\nupon this concept of like self guided\nhealing I was like well yeah but how do\nyou know like okay nice idea and now\nwhat do I do\nso that's pretty much how I conceived of\nmy offering is like do not take it from\nme right I am NOT here to tell anybody\nhow to heal but what I have come upon is\na ritual practice a 30-day you know\napproach to to getting you in touch with\nthat and I found it to be pretty\neffective and I think for the reasons\nwe're discussing because it's simply a\nway based on self care and simple\nlifestyle choices you know related to\nnutrition related to detox related to\nrelaxation response that you can calm\nyour nervous system shift into\nregenerative state that has itself you\nknow a bio neurological signature that\nallows\nto you to deceive interact and respond\nin ways that you're simply not when\nyou're in that chronic fight-or-flight\nstate of you know neuro inflammation and\nonce you do that things become clearer\nso that's pretty much what I have to\noffer you know is this one it's like a\nportal it's like a one month portal you\ngo through and then you're ready it's\nlike it you're you're you're in mastery\nmode because you are gonna know exactly\nwhat you need and I found you know from\npatients to participants and you know my\nonline program but on my reset that it's\nyou know to a person they commit they\nchoose this experience and then what\nunfold from there has nothing to do with\nme literally you know other than that\nperhaps I was in a you know position to\nsay listen it might be the case that\nnothing's wrong with you and your body\ndoesn't make mistakes and it's been\ntrying to get your attention so how do\nyou learn its language how do you begin\nto dialogue with it in in and through\ncuriosity rather than you know reflexive\nfear which is a natural response given\nyou know the ways in which we've been\nenculturated by this site yeah I\ncouldn't agree more it's something I\ntalk about because I believe the result\nof whether again it's these hormonal\nimbalances that are keeping us how the\nsame the societal message that were\ngiven I think we become the adults that\ndon't trust ourself our intuition and\nour body and I think the work that I do\nwith my own clients as well is one of\nreconnecting with that intuition that\nauthentic self that's down below has\nalways been there as far as I see it I\nwill always describe I don't know how\nyou believe we get to this planet but\nupon arrival I use two adjectives all\nthe times I believe this to be true\nwe're intuitive we have that intuition\nand internal guides and we're adaptive\nyes and I think what happens that a lot\nof times whether it's our immediate\ncaregiving environment school systems\nand messages society at large\nover time we become disconnected from\nour intuition and distrustful of it I\ntalked a lot about here\nsooo often of no ill intention of their\nown but who diminish reality our\nperception that intuitive sense that we\nhas little children have or put an\nexperience after experience where and\nbecause we're in a dependent State we\nforsake our reality for the people that\nwe need to be bonded to and connected\nwith not only for our physical needs but\nfor those universal interpersonal needs\nthat I believe we all have and share as\nhumans so before we know it were an\nadult who is either so disconnected from\nourself and our intuition that we don't\nhear it speak and or we don't trust what\nwe hear so I think what drives a lot of\nthe deeper and the empowerment of this\nsort of journey is and the language that\nI think was so beautiful that your\nclients would would offer is feeling\nlike myself I think it is ultimately our\njourney back to that self that has just\nbeen so conditioned and invalidated away\nby the time that we get to adulthood is\nthat the question I get so often is how\ndo I know it's my intuition how do I\nknow if I can trust it and I think\nthat's the journey that we then spend\nonce we take that pivot and begin to\nheal is back to our self that was\nauthentically challenged in one way or\nanother yes and I think the medical\nsystem and its dominance in our psyche\npeace you know not not to mention that\nthe role of the pharmaceutical industry\nin messaging to us about our biology\nright so we are one of three countries\nin the world that allows industry to\nspeak to consumers directly through\nadvertisement and so we're just bathing\nin these needs about what's wrong with\nus and how we need an external authority\nto help us to understand but really it's\nnot a facilitation it's not really\nhelping it's like a top-down you know\nobjectification when you go to a doctor\nwhether that's an ob/gyn or a\npsychiatrist or whatever it might be\nyou're going to them as the authority on\nyou and it sounds to most of us\nobviously yeah of course I am I want the\nanswer\nwe have to start to consider what is in\nin what does that entail right what are\nwe empowering them with that is costing\nus a certain degree of empowerment and\nin fact can we learn about the\nsignificance of what we are experiencing\nperhaps on our own with some support\nright it's a different model and through\nthrough this model you know we really\nresolve a childlike consciousness a\nconsciousness that that perceives\nauthority figures whether it's the\ngovernment the FDA or your internist as\nhaving you know the final word on your\nexperience whereas an adult\nconsciousness would you know certainly\nrepresent what you're describing where\nthat locus of control is is inside and\nit's not changeable and you know moving\nin the way and it's done depending on\nwhat other people are describing to be\nyour state you have a connection to that\nsignature essence within you and it\ntakes time absolutely takes time you\nknow these days when I you know I think\nyou would probably use the same language\nlike self abandon right or self quietly\nthere is a signature feeling to that you\nknow it's like and I get defensive about\nit inside myself it's like my little\nattorney inside myself just like at the\nstand ready to defend unnecessarily\nbecause no one even said anything right\nlike the way that I micro lied or the\nway that I represented something and\ncompletely or the way that I said\nsomething to my daughter that I'd need\nto you know and and so you begin to\nlearn your biological signatures as your\nheart race do you tense up do you sweat\na little do you feel like you you need a\nyou know a drink or a candy bar or you\nknow what is your what is your a\nsignature your doctor can't tell you\nthat you know I can't tell you that and\nso that seems intuitive in the realm of\nour emotional terrain and personalities\nand and psychic structures but it's\nreally not different in the in the realm\nof biology you know even in seemingly\nreified\ninstitutional medicine you know when it\ncomes to heart disease and cancer and\ndiabetes and autoimmune conditions I\nmean you can find I can help you find\nyou know we're constantly at the at the\ndesk trying to publish these outcomes of\npeople who reclaimed their health\nno doctor involved right or very minimal\nguidance from a doctor so how do you\nexplain that if the doctor is the final\nauthority or enter a new realm yeah I\nthink it's really exciting Kelly and I\nthink some of it is generational too\nbecause I book back at my parents my\nmother who has been chronically ill my\nentire life and they're in their\neighties now so they believe are of a\ngeneration where the doctor was seen as\nAuthority and furthermore where the\nworld of the internet and exchange of\ninformation did not exist so unless\nthey're going to be the person who's\ngetting multiple opinions you do have\nthat mindset okay so whoever is wearing\nthe white coat tweets to me what it is\nor what it isn't and here are my options\nand I don't think that they had very\nmuch I mean some really industrious I'm\nsure could have gotten multiple opinions\nmaybe go into some text books but I\nbelieve we're in an era now with a free\nenergy exchange that you can actually go\non and empower yourself with opinions\noutside of one doctor's own that's\nsomething else that never really sat\ncomfortably with me with which is this\nidea that I am in the room as the expert\nthat holds the actual pieces of the\npuzzle even with the clients I work with\nnow I say that's don't look to me do not\ndo exactly what I do like I see highly\nsuggest you don't I highly suggest you\nyou know do exactly what your you're\noffering which is discover you I am a\nbig proponent of developing what I call\nself observation so the ability to\nobjectively you know explore and view\nyourself throughout the day so you can\nknow what your cues are know what your\ntrigger points are know how emotions\nbegin to take hold in your body and then\nwhat value that they could offer of you\nand I think I love that visual you gave\nor okay so\nis what this professional said this is\nwhat it must be my partner I talk about\nthis a lot because we observe that a lot\nof people I call it reactive they're\nliving in a very reactive state where\nthey are either taking everyone else's\nopinion and doing or they're just\nreacting emotionally to each and every\none of the occurrences in their given\nday so you'll always hear me speak of\nshifting from that internalizing that\ncontrol at locus of control that you're\nspeaking of so that we can develop\nchoice and responsiveness so we can take\nin all of the information but then as I\nsay we go back and we try it on for size\nknowing that ultimately I am the person\nwho knows if this fits or if this\ndoesn't fit because not all of the\ninformation that we're getting from\npeople is helpful is accurate or is\nabout us at all like you're saying all\nof this internal workings I could be\nresponding to were reacting to something\nin a given moment that was not even\nabout me that was an offhanded comment\nthat this person said about something\nthat I triggered in them and now I'm\nhaving my own workout emotionally about\nsomething that's not about me they think\nuntil we develop that home base we're\ngoing to feel very reactive and very out\nof control in this world and not very\nempowered totally and and even the\netymology I love to sort of visit with\nsometimes right because like reactive is\nrepeating of a past patterning and and\nso many of us are obviously living in\nfact I think it's vendor called who\ndefines trauma is like you know living\nthe present does a repeat of the past\nand that's why we see the same patterns\nover and over and over again and we're\nvictimized in the same way you know over\nand over and over again and this concept\nof taking personal responsibility right\nso anytime you have that trigger how can\nit not be a new victim story how can it\nbe an opportunity for responsibility\nthat you know you just break it apart\nit's response-ability\nlike how can you cultivate the capacity\nto respond rather than react match and I\nthink you know there are some pretty\nbasic ways to begin to save that that\npath but it might start with first of\nall awareness\nso again in the realm of informed\nconsent and this democratization of\ninformation through the internet you\nknow we are in a position to consent\nourselves really you know because if you\ngo to a doctor and you're prescribed\nanything from you know a an antibiotic\nfor cough to you know a steroid or\nwhatever your doctor is going to tell\nyou what your doctor has been taught\ntrust me when I used to prescribe\nincluding to pregnant and breastfeeding\nwomen as a specialist in that\ninteresting arena I thought I knew what\nI needed to know you know and I had very\ngood intentions right so these are not\nbad people doing bad thing they have a\nlimited scope and I I describe it as\nlike you know you wouldn't go to the\nbutcher to learn about veganism so how\nare you gonna learn about veganism\nyou're gonna have source information\nfrom other places right and so if we're\nlooking at informed consent we have to\nknow about the risks that perhaps your\ndoctor is not told about you know so\nparticularly let's say the the\ndependency forming nature of these\nmedications and how challenging it can\nbe without proper support to come off of\npsychiatric medication so you're not\ngoing to learn about that from your\ndoctor and you're not gonna learn about\npotentially how the benefits are\noverplayed and over-promised because of\na small keyhole of the literature that\nthey are a you know encouraged to look\nthrough you're certainly not going to\nlearn about alternatives right so what\nis alternative you know I I'm very\ninterested in the fact that some of the\noutcomes I've had you know that the\nprivileged to witness whether it's you\nknow chronic recidivist stick treatment\nresistance its afrien eeeh suicidal\ndepression bipolar disorder on the way\nHospital whether it's OCD or whether\nit's like you know grief after a loss\nthat these individuals for the most part\nwere either\ninjured by our not helped by in some\ncases kind of left by the side of the\nroad in the treatment-resistant category\nby the conventional system right so so\nthis is not only something that is like\npotentially as good quote-unquote with\nfewer side effects it's actually a realm\nof outcomes that are not available\nwithin the system that are literally not\navailable and so what do you want to\ncall that remission or cure or radical\nhealing that is not a concept in the\nchronic illness realm of conventional\nmedicine that's what makes it chronic\nnobody's trying to resolve it or curator\nhealing so if you know that that's\npossible and that's a big part of my\nadvocacy it's just making sure that\npeople know what's possible then a\nlittle a little you know spark might\nignite in you that says yeah I want that\nand you're gonna know exactly what\nyou're gonna be attracted to what you\nneed to do to make that a reality for\nyourself yeah yeah I love that and I\nlike particularly that you do speak so\nstrongly about informed consent because\nwhat I hear when you say that is you're\nnot saying do or don't do one thing or\nthe other you're actually just saying\nequipped yourself with the whole of it\nwith all of the knowledge that then you\nfor yourself can make the most empower\nchoice because for some people maybe\nthat is a bit continuing down that\nconventional system in one way or\nanother I know for my family it is and\nit will always be for others though that\nspark might be lit enough so I love that\nthat's your mindset because with\ninformation we do equip ourselves or at\nleast give ourselves the opportunity to\nbegin to make new choices and I and I\nthink that there are people out there\nyou know this is one of the main way I'm\nusing my platform is to show communities\na big motivator for me out\nstarting to talk about these new\nholistic methods that I knew were going\nto be really helpful and to start to\ngive tools to humanity in a sense\nanother a really big motivator for me\nKelly was to discover other humans who\nwere experiencing the same things\nbecause it can be really lonely and\nisolating because the reality of people\naround us are still going to be marching\ndown that conventional system or just\nmaking daily lifestyle choices that I\ndon't choose to make for myself anymore\nso big I went online I thought okay\nthere have to be other people in this\nworld and my mind is blown daily with\nhow many other people are living and can\nshare their experiences and community is\nhealing and I think that now that the\ncollective is waking up there are more\npeople that understand that there are\nalternate ways of healing and I just\nlike that we are putting the message out\nthere and allowing the communities of\nthese people to find each other so now\nit's people I came in contact with I'm\nseeing relationships developing comments\nand you know that makes that just warms\nmy heart and I'm like okay this is these\nare other humans that get it we're not\nnot for everyone I understand that but I\ndo think that the more information at\nleast you're setting people up to making\npower choices and I like to just\nhighlight that because that's all you're\nthat's what you're speaking for and I\ncould not agree more because I know I\nwasn't given information I was down that\nstandard path that's all I thought that\nwas available and to speak to your point\nwe only know what we're told or what\nwe're taught so now you have other\npeople out there that are sending\ndifferent messages and I'm just I'm just\nI'm excited it's a state continue to see\nthe trajectory I think of this of this\nbig shift absolutely I mean it's it's\nit's interesting because when I wrote my\nfirst book of mind of your own I thought\noh well one somebody has this\ninformation then obviously they're never\ngonna touch a medication right mm-hmm\nI was you know slowly disabused of that\nassumption mm-hmm it's like you're\nfamily and like so many people that I\nknow like my own family\nthat's not the case information is not\nsufficient to change minds so so what I\nthink is happening it's like you know\nfolks like you and me it's like we're\nwe're howling up and into the you know\nstratosphere and people are hearing that\nand then the information is kind of like\nthis like the pebbles on you know the on\nthe moonlit path you know but it's it's\nnot the information that changes\nanyone's minds and I've learned that the\nhard way trying to convince people that\nin fact not everyone is called to this\nprocess and path and it's it's something\nlike we're just organizing around\ndifferent resonances you know like I\nhave a community final life project for\npeople who like don't want to take the\ndeep dive into the protocol yet but they\nneed to warm up and they want to take\nlittle steps and I and I have witnessed\nlike that if all we do in that community\nis practice expressive and narrative\nhygiene around victimization right like\nwe talked about our experience of\nsymptoms and our challenges through the\nlens of personal empowerment then we are\ncommitting to a shared vision and goal\nand that's what brings us together like\nthat's the resonant frequency that we're\noccupying and I I'm recognizing like\nit's kind of like I had this thought the\nother day like in these little\ncommunities when you feel like yes like\nthey get me they get what I'm talking\nabout even if you're not doing this\nstuff you're not reading the books but\njust something in you is like yeah\nthat's a more beautiful life I want to\nbe a part of that right it's like we're\norganizing around like different tissue\nstructures and cellular lines like you\nknow like there's the liver cells and\nthe heart cells and the kidney cells and\nall together we make an organism but\nwe're not all of the same resonant\nfrequency and so I think that's like\nwhat's happening it's like we're kind of\nlike finding our organs and you'll know\nyou know what that was that signature is\nit's probably not going to come through\nthe vector of information which is\nfrustrating for me because I love that\nthere's so much science to support you\nknow this this new approach to the body\nand you know this this\ninterconnectiveness that you're you're\ndescribing I mean there's literally two\nand a half decades of research into\npsychoneuroimmunology that tell the\nstory of the validity of this that it is\nreal and maybe more real then than the\nscience and medicine that's currently\nbeing practiced but it's just there to\nkind of support us it's not there to to\nyou know change anyone's mind yeah yeah\nno I agree and I I joke often and I say\nmy hope is I guess I should say that I\nbelieve that this time in history is\ngoing to be looked back upon from a much\nmore evolved place where epigenetics is\nactually the science that we all adhere\nto where we do understand this\ninterconnectedness and words like psycho\nterminology or very much I and I think\nthat we're going to be viewed as the end\nof dark ages I just think it's\ninevitable when that happens\nyou know question mark but it's\nhappening so I know you do have tell us\na little bit about you know if anyone is\ninterested and got a kernel later a\nspark from this conversation I know you\nhave an amazing community advisor life\nand a new book coming out so where can\npeople find you and find other\nlike-minded individuals if they have you\nknow something that's parked up inside\nof them after the conversation today\nawesome yeah I mean I've been I've been\nat this for you know I don't know ten or\nso years beginning with my own healing\njourney and I I feel a bit of like a mic\ndrop moment because I feel like I've\nI've created the offerings that are\nnecessary for self healing and published\nyou know science to support their\nefficacy and have testimonial videos of\npeople healing from all sorts of things\nthey were told they couldn't heal from\nand so the you know the offerings range\nfrom like a low-cost month-to-month\nmembership where we do this little\nstep-by-step stuff called vital life\nproject to the deep dive it's kind of\nlike that's the yin space the deep dive\nis the yang space of vital mind reset\nwhich is like when you're ready for that\nmonth and you're ready to potentially\nmove through\nwith a dark night of your souls healing\nyou know that's what you know we've\nbuilt up and then there's kind of like\nyou know books that match those right so\nmy newest book is really more meant for\nthe long haul process of awakening you\nknow and how to stay strong primarily\nfrom the perspective of not engaging the\nmedical system from a place of fear\nright so with you know there's tips on\nit everything from how to work with a\nUTI snood UTI symptoms naturally to you\nknow how to engage suicidality and my\ngoal is really to to have created a tool\nkit that will keep people from engaging\nthe system when it's not right for them\nbecause they might imagine they don't\nknow what else to do so here's what else\nto do and it's called on yourself and\nit's something of a sequel to a mind of\nyour own which was the first book was\nmuch more on deconstructing psychiatry\nand and I don't know kind of some of the\nmyths that we might have been exposed to\nthe protocol in there has been refined\nand I was sitting with my partner\nyesterday he was reading my book\nactually now for the first time and\nshe's like wow you're really giving away\nthe goods on the protocol huh and it's\ntrue you know we decided to just put it\nall in on yourself because people can do\nit from a book I I wouldn't be able to\nbut people can and we've seen that and\nnow that I see that I feel like have at\nit you know here's all you need here's\nall you need to know and some you know\nsort of tips and and tricks from the\ntrenches and and we'll you know we'll\nsee how ready people are it's it's\nreally high\nyou believe you know that will begin to\nshift this for all of us all of our safe\nyeah I think it's incredible and I think\nhaving the community offering with the\nbook coming out to speak to your point\nand the reality that maybe these are\npeople who are in burdens of treatment\nthat's what I believe very strongly\nabout my work - it doesn't have to be\nstandalone go see your therapist go get\nsupport please go use all the tools and\nresources\nhere's another addition here's some\nhelpful toolkit and to speak to the\npoint your your first blow-up honestly\nso anyone listening he was not read a\nmind of her and this was for me it was\nreally pivotal you did introduce me to a\nwhole world of science that I had not\nlearned about and I needed to and that\nwas my really jump off point to then\ndive a bit deeper and really inform\nmyself for my own healing that I was\ngoing through very actively but the the\nultimate the clinical work that I'm\ndoing and those listening I did get eyes\non her new book and I'm about halfway\nthrough because I can't put it down and\nit's just amazing so you are equipping\nhumanity in such a pivotal way Kelly and\nlike I said you've always been a mentor\nfrom afar so today getting to chat with\nyou is and seeing just continued\nalignment in our work is everything to\nme so I just want to wholeheartedly\nthank you and anyone out there listening\nshe knows what she's there waiting go\njump in her community too and really\ngive yourself more of a tool kit and I'm\njust I'm excited like I said I think\nthis is a testament to the times that\npeople like you and I exist Center you\nknow CAPA following and have other\nhumans out there anyone listening I\ndefinitely watched many am a testimonial\nthat you put up go get yourself some\nempowerment someone listening that maybe\nhas a spark jump on see that there is so\nmuch possible and then come join our\ncommunity so thank you I been really\nreally pivotal beyond what you can\nimagine\nthank you know it's it's it's an honor\nand I find myself wondering if if this\nbook on yourself is like it's something\nlike a mind of your own plus your work\nlike now that I'm reflecting on it like\nthere really is so much over\nup and and I I think you know we're in\nan exciting moment and those who are\ncalled to their high air more powerful\nexpression you know the tools are there\nthe support is there and you deserve it\nabsolutely well thank you for taking the\ntime thank you"
