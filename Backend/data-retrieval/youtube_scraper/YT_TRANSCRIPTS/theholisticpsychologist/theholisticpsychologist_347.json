    "transcript": "hello everyone dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist here I have a\ntreat for you guys today I have my long\ntime at this point now it feels like\nyeah be BFF on a ferret over at mindful\nMFT I know a lot of my followers are\nalready following Harvick yeah\nabsolutely amazing and I brought her on\ntoday we're gonna talk all things\nconflict and couples and here she is\nthank you so much for being on here\ntoday thank you for having me I know\nwe're like BFF high-five Instagram for\nthe win bringing good people together\nthis is fun I love it on oh yeah so\nabsolutely I know you do a whole hell of\na lot of couples work and you're always\nbeing a talking about couples and I\nthink when we think about couples most\nof us think about conflict the\nchallenges couples so talk to me a\nlittle bit about conflict in couples and\nkind of what your mindset is on all that\nyeah I mean I think that you know you\nand I talk a lot about sort of the\norigin stories of the templates of how\nour programming gets put into motion and\nI think conflict obviously is one of\nthose things that a lot of couples like\nto avoid and you know people want to not\nfight they want to bury it they want to\nmove it away they don't want me to go\nthere because the story around conflict\noften is something that we've been to\nthis connection and separation and anger\nfrustration chaos whatever it is and so\nI know for me conflict you know it can\neither be the thing that just stories or\na space where conflict can be in my\nopinion one of the greatest connectors\nand sort of like intimacy builders that\nwe have and I think this reframe around\nconflict is so important but it\ndefinitely takes way more than you know\ncounting to 10 and just trying to say\nthings in a kind fashion it's like you\nknow we we really struggle with conflict\nand for me I love to start with the\norigin story and that template of where\nwe saw how we saw conflict and\ndemonstrate it and for me I go back\nobviously to family of origin I know\nthat you you do the same\nand bring people's attention to the way\nin which they saw conflict and bring\nawareness to like was it something that\nwas passive-aggressive was it something\nthat was one person screaming did people\nshut down and put it under the rug was\nit something that never got resolved and\nwe start identifying the way in which\nthat template was built out so that we\ncan understand what the programming is\ndoing when we're actually finding\nourselves in that threat response in\npresent day yeah absolutely I mean you\nand I are in such alignment in terms of\nconsidering our past experiences and how\nthey inform our current or current ones\nparticularly in couples so just backing\nup for one second why I mean why is it\nthat we find ourselves in our\npartnerships I mean I'm probably\nspeaking I know from my own experience\nbut I think from a lot of ours why is it\nthat our closest relationships are\nromantic partnerships if you will are\nthe ones that are the most maybe if\nthey're not the most conflictual but\nthey get the most heated when so well\nwe're spending so much time with those\npeople first there's something that\ntends to be really familiar in that\nphase right we want to be seen you want\nto be understood we want to be loved and\naccepted and connected to this person I\nmean more than most people in this world\nand so when that threat response gets\nactivated we're wait a second you did\nnot hear me or you did just cross over a\nline or I feel betrayed or I feel\nembarrassed or I don't feel seeing heard\nconnected to you then reactivation\nhappens and we can you know we can go to\nwe can go to work there right it's like\nI need to move myself to safety becomes\nthe number one priority and that's where\nwe move from a couple to individual I\nneed to move myself to safety we don't\nreally think about how the system moves\nto safety now this stuff this is really\nhard right like and I think you and I\nare actually quite honest about where we\ndon't do things well and where it's like\nyeah like this is the human part of it\nit's not that you are never going to\nhave this moment where you try to move\nyourself to safety like Connor and I\nwill label it he I call him the\njackhammer and he calls me the\nthe point prove ur right so it's like\nwhat we'd get into that space like like\nif I got it like I actually understood\nwhat I've done that has you know that\nhas hurt you and keeps going and going\nand going and there isn't that room or\nspace for that connection to happen so\nyou know there's you have to have a\nlittle bit of flexibility and humor with\nus because we're gonna misstep you know\nand we're gonna we can misstep often but\nthe goal is to be able to move the\nsystem to safety and why it happens with\nthe people we love is because we get\nhurt because those are the people who\nare supposed to have our backs who are\nsupposed to love us who are supposed to\nsee us in a way that feels safe and\nsecure and then when our human parts\ncome forward it feels so much more\nbetraying and it's it's such a greater\nletdown for us because we put so much\ninto that dynamic to sort of hold the\ncontainer for us to grow and be deeply\nintimate and expansive and you know\ntransparent with with one another and\nvery vulnerable ways and when we do that\nand it doesn't work it you know it can\nfeel it kind of feel like death you know\nand I don't mean that in a really\ndramatic way but it's sort of like this\nthis part that just doesn't feel alive\nand connected yeah absolutely absolutely\nI couldn't agree more I think it's a\ntestament to the depth of the emotional\nconnection and I love that you have\nwoven in in your response that concept\nof safety because as far as I see it and\nI think traditionally especially I don't\nknow how much training you know you had\nin your program but I think societally\nwe had this idea that unless you had I\nthink a lot of us are familiar with the\nbig day of trauma unless you had the big\nglaring instance of abuse or neglect\nthat was the only thing that earned you\nthat title of trauma experience however\nI am a big believer in a much more\nexpansive definition and I'm gonna throw\nout a universal statement right now I\nbelieve most of us humans walking this\nearth are carrying some version of\nlittle T trauma which to me and the\nreason I wrap this in with the concept\nof safety is because when we are feeling\nthreatened we actually do go into a\nsurvival based response and I love how\nyou worded it we move from the system\nmoving\nsafety to the individual and I agree\nwith you I think that perceptually even\nthere's something that happens in our\nminds I talk about this often where our\nfield our perceptual field shrinks and\nwe cannot care or can't even consider\neven if it's the other person that I\nlove more than anyone else on this\nplanet right they don't matter when my\nwe have to remember that this is very\nevolutionarily based they don't matter\nwhen my safety is what is being\nthreatened so I allow the way I love\nthat you will VIN and I think this\npiggybacks and going back to what you\nare offering we get information about\nrelationships and in particular the\ndynamics and how things like conflict\nare resolved from a very young age so\nnot only are we feeling very emotionally\nthreatened in these most intimate\nconnections but we oftentimes are then\ndrawing upon those models that I know I\nheard you referenced earlier what we saw\nhappen or not happen when the adults\naround us the caregivers around us not\nonly when they themselves as adults were\nin conflict but maybe even when what\nwould happen when we were in trouble as\na kid how was conflict handled and I\nknow that in principle us and then\nsometimes becomes the way in which we\ntry to navigate conflict usually\nunsuccessfully when we are now in our\nadult relationships yeah absolutely and\nI love what you said about little -\ntrauma like I agree with you a hundred\npercent I would say that probably most\nof us are walking around with you know\nsome experience of trauma and actually\nrecently in a in a session of mine I was\nsaying you know we tend to see trauma as\nit's like a cute moment in a person's\nlife and if you don't have that acute\nmoment where you're like yes that thing\nthat happened to me and that's my big\ntrauma right people people don't know\nwhat to do with the work and yet I love\nyou know I think that a lot of times\ntrauma is this slow burn that is you\nknow very consistent and regular in a\nperson's life and isn't this a cute\nmoment and so yes when we're thinking\nabout conflict and we're constantly\nthinking about how we're moving\nourselves into safety when we were a\npart of systems where it wasn't safe\nwhether it was you know having an an\naddict parent or someone who was you\nknow with mental health issues that were\nwe know we're not being addressed and\nwe're not being\nyou know managed well whether it was a\nsibling who you know had something going\non in their life I was taking up a lot\nof the time and energy and space in the\nsystem that you didn't you didn't get\nattention and you didn't get connection\nand you didn't get what it is that you\nneeded as a child there's so many\ndifferent unique experiences that bring\nus to the space of I need to protect\nmyself and when you said and that's why\nI said that word before is like I'm\ngoing to war like even though I love you\nmore than anything else in this world\nright now all I can see as it shrinks is\nI need to protect myself and bring\nmyself to safety really at all costs\nit's why we become defensive it's why we\nbecome critical it's why we become\ncontemptuous it's why we can sometimes\nStonewall right I'm naming all of the\nfour horsemen John Gottman's work and\nit's why we go into that space because\nwe're like I'll bring I'll bring it all\nout whatever I need to do to make sure\nthat I'm okay\nis what we activate and so this work\nit's not good enough to just know that\nwe do this right our work is to find\nthose moments where we're actually able\nto pivot and move those things that will\nalways lead us into disconnection with\nour partners into a space where we can\nconnect and listen sometimes that means\nthat we get it wrong their first time\nright sometimes that means that we do\nTerror at the relationship and we get\ndefensive and we prove our points and we\ndon't want to listen to the other person\nbut then maybe whether it's 20 minutes\nor two hours or 20 hours or you know\nsometimes a little bit longer we come\nback and we say can we do this again\nbecause I think I would like to really\nunderstand what your experience is and\none of the most important things that I\nthink we have to do is remember that we\nare both having an eternal experience\nthat is so important for us to\nunderstand and when I go back to where I\nstarted today like conflict for me is\nsome of the most important information\nthat we will ever get I always tell my\ncouples like yeah well if you are you\nlike each other and you get along good\nI'm glad I hope so\nright like you have fun you have shared\ninterests like you laugh together you\nfind each other funny right all that\nstuff good high-five each other that's\nan A\nbut how you do conflict is gonna be what\nsets you apart conflict is information\nif you're willing to listen to it to me\nit's this like red flag in the sand that\nsays something really really really\nimportant is going on in your and your\npartner's internal world and if you take\na moment to pause in that space and\nactually like move yourself into this\nspace up okay how do I care about what\nis happening in that other person's\nexperience just as important as how I\ncare about what's happening in my and\nlisten sometimes this [ __ ] is really\nreally hard but when you come back to it\nwhen you can start asking yourself those\nquestions and say I need to know what's\nhere because there's an origin story\nthis there's a story there's something\nhere that is activating something in\nthis other person that is bringing this\nforward in such a way that wants to\ndisconnect and that wants to shut down\nthat wants to you know bring the claws\nout and that means that there's\nsomething really important for me to\nunderstand about you and something\nreally important for you to understand\nabout me and if we can make a deal here\nand bring both of those things forward\non the table we're gonna learn something\nvery important about ourselves and each\nother which is gonna build out intimacy\na deep understanding beautiful\nconnection I can't tell you how much\nintimacy and connection I have gained\nfrom moving through conflict well yeah\ntruly I yeah I can't agree more vien and\nand the reality the language I always\nuse is our triggers are our teachers and\nwhat we're talking about here is very\nacutely triggering moments that happen\nin one of two ways when one partner is\ntriggered so something happens in my\nworld and this had what happened often\neven in my own relationship something\nwould happen or not happen and I would\nassign a meaning that touched upon and I\nlove that you talked about wanting to be\nseeing her connected with because some\nof us as individuals carry core wounds\none of mine is not feeling seen and\nheard by a completely emotionally absent\nmother\nso this wound for me and my partnership\nwas triggered right and left especially\nat the beginning of my relationship and\nthat wasn't a one person come it wasn't\na two person conflict interestingly\nenough or at least it didn't start out\nas one that would start out as me\nfeeling triggered because I would assign\na million different you know instances\nthat meaning oh here's another\nway that my partner is not considering\nor seeing me obviously I would erupt or\ndetach whatever I was you know needed to\ndo in the moment to keep me safe and\nthen my partner oftentimes is left\nconfused at what the heck er you know is\nhappening because I'm having such a big\nemotional response and then I think\nthere's a conflict as well that's even\nmore difficult to navigate when both\nparties whether or not it started you\nknow in a mutual eruption or one thing\nwas said by one of the partners and then\nit devolved or erupted and now both\nparties are having something like you\nsaid very deep happening where both\nsystem both individuals are attempting\nto move to their own safety sometimes in\nvery different ways and I work with a\nmillion couple so guys of you know kind\nof one partner is wanting to avoid and\nthat is triggering the other partner\nwound who is now trying to chase and\nthen the snowball goes running down yeah\nbut I think that the important to note\nthat there are those different types of\nentries into conflict because talk about\norigin story we get into conflict I\nthink in both of those paths absolutely\nabsolutely and there's you know there's\na reason why some of us want to resolve\nimmediately and there's a reason why\nsome of us want to distance and get away\nfrom it and if we track backwards we're\ngonna see why that's in place and yes\nthat cycle of pursuer distance err and\nyou know safety needing to be away from\nthe conflict versus safety needing to be\nwith that person don't you dare leave me\nwe need to do this right now you can't\ngo to bed with a you know with with\nanger or conflict you know some of those\nnarratives and yeah you know it's not\nlost on us that you know you see almost\nall couples have a very different style\nfrom one another you're like how did we\nand that's you know it's that\nopportunity for growth right there's a\nreason why we partner with people and\nthere there becomes this beautiful space\nwhen we stretch it and we see it where\nthe healing can happen where yes those\ncore wounds that you were talking about\nbut I do believe that you know most of\nus most of us have something in there\nthat really\nactivates our system and gets us going\nand you know ideally we are doing some\nof this prob work where you know you\ndon't just talk about conflict when\nyou're in the middle of it that is very\nvery hard to do but when you are\nactually outside of the conflict\nexperience really getting to know\nyourself and getting to know your\npartner it's one of the things that we\ntalked about in the course they've got\nthe lucky one course where you you move\nyourself out of this space and you start\nto bring awareness to what are my core\nwounds right what is my defense\nmechanism what's my coping style what do\nI do when I'm feeling threatened and\nwhen you start to get to know this part\nof yourself and this part of your\npartner if you're if you are partnered\nright now it does bring beautiful\nawareness because then when you do\ntransition into that conflict state\nwhich it will happen and it will guess\nwhat happened for the rest of our lives\nlike it's just gonna be there right it's\nlike you have a deeper sense of\nawareness that you can tap into when\nthat activation happens again I go\nsaying before it's not always that you\ntap into it in the moment and yes\nideally like if we can get that practice\ninto that space that is beautiful but\nthat when you have that deeper sense of\nawareness because you're building it out\noutside of a conflict scenario that\nreally is deeply helpful for for a\nsystem to be able to navigate and to say\nwell what do I want to be responsible\nfor when we get into conflict right what\nis one thing that I can bring awareness\nto what's one thing that you can bring\nawareness to what are we committed to\nand then sometimes when we're actually\nin that space one of us or both of us\ncan hold ourselves accountable to it\nwhen we know when we've named it when we\nsent it out loud and said like I know\nI'm guilty of this like I am the point\nprove er I know that I can go into that\nspace I'm like I'm gonna show you how\nyou're wrong and I'm gonna tell you\nexactly how you know like why it's this\nway and I'm gonna keep going until you\nsee that I am right you know and you\nknow Connor in our conflict will\nsometimes be like\nand it will like just Lodge it for me\nbecause we've you know obviously we've\nhad a lot of practice with it\nbut it can be something that starts to\nshift ourselves out of the life\nprogramming of like this is what I need\nto do this is where I'm headed and I'm\ngonna do it at all costs because I don't\nwant to take my partner down with me\neven though in that like you said from\nlittle T to big T you know our obviously\nour number-one goal is to move ourselves\ninto safety but if you are dealing with\na partner with whom you believe you know\nactually has your best interest at heart\nwhich is not everybody right so that's\nnot every person who's watching this and\nlistening to this you don't\nnot everybody has a partner who's\nactually standing shoulder to shoulder\nand wants to do this work and sometimes\nyou actually do need to move yourself to\nbecause you actually are in harm's way\nright so we're at right now we're\ntalking about people who have the\ncapacity who are doing it who want to do\nthis not if you're in an abusive\nrelationship where you are actually\nneeding to move yourself there but that\nI the the narrative that we want is that\nI am safe with you and I know that right\nand and that leaning into you right and\nyou leaning into me is safety and it's\nthat we're trying to override that\nthought and that narrative that getting\naway from you and proving my point or\nwhatever it is is what's gonna lead me\nto safety\nI am overriding that thought to say\nactually with you I am the safest when\nboth of us can start to shift ourselves\nout of the coping style or the defense\nstrategy or you know whatever you know\nwhatever else is being you know thrown\ninto the mix there yeah I absolutely\nabsolutely love that Fianna because the\nreality of it is we can do our own work\nseparately even if we're not in a\ncommitted partnership or even if we are\nto know ourselves like you said to know\nour stories our wounds and then the way\nour defenses around those wounds and\nthat is as I see it the responsibility\nfor each of us as partners hauser or not\nwe're in that relationship now or not\nand but you're bringing up a great point\nbecause a question I do get asked a lot\nis okay if I'm if I'm responsible for\nmyself do I open myself up to abuse or\nto boundary violations absolutely not we\ncan know our self and own our part in\nconflict and still you know have a\ndefinitive line\nwhat's okay and what's not okay and the\nreality of it is not all of us are going\nto find himself in that safe partnership\nso that things aren't mutually exclusive\nowning our responsibility for the part\nthat we're playing in a conflict doesn't\nmean that we are absolving partners who\nare egregiously crossing boundaries\nbecause that's just not the case and I\nthink the reality of it is as we get\nbetter over time we can start to be more\nand more aware the language I use is\nconscious in the moment so that one of\nus I love how you put that can hold\naccountability for the system but that\ndoesn't happen overnight so it does\nstart by one of us calling it when once\nwe've reached a point of escalation\nthat's no longer going to be helpful for\nthe safety of the partnership because\nthat happens I know what happens with me\nand I know especially when our course of\nwounds are touched and both of us are in\nthat really emotional reactive State\nthere comes a point of no return so\nsometimes putting a pin in it and you're\ndressing it later but our goal is in\nreal time like yeah you're stating to be\nable to hold accountability to call to\nconscious mind the reality that this is\nsomeone in front of you even though\nyou're your subconscious is screaming\nthat no this is the villain and the\nperpetrator in the moment that it's\nactually not the case if this is a human\nwho does have your best interest in mind\nyeah absolutely and I think you know\nwhen you I often times feel like the\nmore the conflict and builds you can see\nmore of the hurt the hurt part actually\nbeing activated which has always been\nvery helpful for me because I think\nevery once in a while when I really can\nsee the hurt in my partner all of a\nsudden the rest of it moves away from me\nand that becomes the priority where it's\nlike ah now when I'm just as hurt that's\nthat's much harder right so you know\nlisten in conflict not all conflict is\ncreated created equally\nyou know sometimes it's very clear that\nlike I've done something that has really\nhurt you\nright and then there's moments where\nit's very clear that you've done\nsomething that's really hurt me every\nonce in a while we are like very equally\nhurt\nwhere it's like oh yeah like no no I'm\nnot gonna give up any inches here when\nwe know that when we see that our\npartner is is deeply hurting and maybe\nwe're not in the same space as they are\nI have always found it really important\nto seem you know to see my partner as a\nas a young boy and I can see like the\nkid in him you know and I obviously you\ntalked talked so much about you know\nhealing the inner child and I think that\nthat worker in that language around the\ninner child within and knowing that that\ntemplate story right that origin story\nwherever it took up place whether it was\nat six or twelve or you know whatever\nwhatever age it is is being able to see\nthat ah there is an inner child who's\nactivated right now and I love that I\nlove this person and I love that inner\nchild and all I want to do is create\nsafety for you so let me move my stuff\naside and show up and again really hard\nwork to do but you know in our in our\ncourse we talk so much about how to do\nthis right not just the awareness around\noh like these aha moments and this is\nwhat it looks like and let me understand\nwhy I do this and oh great I get it my\nparents fought this way or they fought\nwith me in this way and so that's why I\nam the way that I am it's you know we\nhave to take it further and we have to\ndo the integration work I think that's\nwhere so many of us get caught it's\nmoving it from our awareness and what it\nis that I know about myself and you've\ngot ha moments and all of these like\nlight bulbs that are going off into the\npractice right the action and the\nintegration of the work that we're doing\nand so it's it's work as we all know\nit's work but it can be done and that's\nthe beauty of it yeah 100% and I've\nactually seen that on a really global\nscale Vienna where this is one of the\nlimitations as far as I saw it of just\nthe standard therapy model to because we\ncan have a beautifully conscious insight\nyou know new ribbon conversation where\nwe totally get it and we know exactly\nwhat we're going to do differently the\nnext time and the next time happens and\nwe're right back into that wounded\nsubconscious place so translating that\ninsulator that consciousness or the\nawareness as I put it into the two steps\nof change is that being the first one\nmaking the second one to change the\nbreaking these\npatterns ever possible does not happen\nwithout that insight however there's a\nbig hurdle in between that step 1 and\nstep 2 that I believe we struggle with\nwhether or not it's in conflict with\ncouples I know that's what you and I\nmight say in general in life my old\npatterns come sneaking out when I'm\nemotionally activated and that\ndefinitely does apply to couple so tell\nme a little bit about about this course\nthat you have gone it sounds like really\nreally helpful to get given some of\nthese more practical tools of okay cuz I\nknow a lot of listeners out there have\ninsight in spades and that they'll find\nthemselves in conflict and not resolving\nthis conflict in a helpful way within\ntheir partnerships so tell me a little\nbit about about your doors yeah totally\nit's I feel really proud about the\ncourse we we've run it once before and\ngot really good feedback and I think you\nknow for anybody who's ever run of\ncourse you're like I don't know until we\ndo it the first time like what this how\nthis is gonna really land so it was\nreally lovely to get such positive\nfeedback from people so the course is a\nsix-week some self led course you can\nenjoy at the speed that works for you\nlifetime access and we we do focus a\nlittle bit on self awareness relational\nawareness at the beginning and then we\ntake you through conflict boundaries and\nthen sex and intimacy and it's like\nreally deep ma modules that are videos\nthat are PDFs with you know prompts and\nquestions and journaling you take it on\nyour own or in a partnership it really\ndoesn't matter because this is about\nbringing a deep sense of awareness and\nthen looking at these patterns that keep\nus stuck and finding the way to actually\nintegrate change for me exactly what you\nsaid Nicole is that I you know we're\nbook we are both trained in sort of like\nthe models the academic models and I\nalso found it to be really challenging\nwhere it's like this you sort of got\nstuck in this loop of awareness and\nhaving these revelations and these aha\nmoments and I found a lot of I became\nreally frustrated and wait where's the\nintegration part of this and that's what\nthis course really is about is moving us\nyes from the awareness into the\nintegration but and having things that\nare long-lasting that create that change\ncreate the new programming in the\nconditioning so that are the practice\nlike practice makes new programming I I\ngrew I grew up with the perfect model I\ndon't know if you heard that growing up\nI heard that growing up playing the\nviolin practice practice practice makes\nperfect perfect perfect which now for me\nhas shifted into practice makes new\nprogramming and that's what we are doing\nhere and that's what the course does in\na way that does ask you to dive in and\ndo some heavy lifting but it gives you\nyou know real-life examples we do live\ncoaching calls to you know dive in and a\nlittle bit further and you know for me I\nthink those the boundaries conflict and\nsex and intimacy with a sort of bigger\nframework of constant self-awareness and\nrelational awareness are some of the\nmost important things that we need to\nmanage and figure out within the context\nof any relationship right we guess we\nare more geared towards the romantic\nrelationships or whether it's\nrelationship with family members\nrelationship to self oh conflict with\nself I mean this is where it's like you\ndon't need a partner to do this work you\nknow like if you don't even have to have\nhad a partner to do this work we have a\nlot of evidence and a lot of examples of\nfamily system stuff or you with you that\ncan give you the tools where you can\nstart implementing the tools with your\nown self and building out that structure\nand that strategy and that programming\nand that conditioning to do it\ndifferently when if and when you move\ninto you know a romantic relationship so\nI'm super proud of the course it's\namazing I love it I think everybody\nshould take it honestly just because\nit's you know it's one of those things\nthat you have to move from self\nawareness into integration I want as\nmany people to you know to take it and\nsay yeah that's possible yeah absolutely\nI couldn't agree more and I think the\nway we relate in relationships is often\nreflective of our relationship with\nourselves first and foremost and the\nreality of it is there are many\ndifferent types of relationships and you\nknow intimacy does span friendships and\nfamily based relationships we don't have\nto just be speaking of physical intimacy\nI think\nwe you know often think of in terms of\nthe romantic relationship but there are\nmultiple types of intimacy's and I love\nthat you highlighted boundaries and then\nsex and intimacy because again in even\nin our romantic relationships boundaries\nare really still important that does not\nabsolve us just because this is the\nperson with whom that we're married or\ncommitted to for life or in that deeper\ndeepest level of relationship with that\ndoesn't absolve that relationship from\nhaving boundaries in and of itself and I\nbelieve that conflict in and of itself\nactually can sometimes be prevent or end\nthe lack of resolution and complication\nsay can prevent the depth of intimacy\njust as much as our patterns and our\nprograms and things we learn a lot of us\nI think struggle in terms of developing\nand like I said intimacy on a big global\nsense not just physical intimacy I also\nlove as I'm sure you're gonna know I say\ngonna say this that you're highlighting\npractice because that's the reality\nthere is no as I say it magic wand I can\nread a book and then just oh the next\ntime I'm in this situation I'm gonna do\nit differently it really is in my\nopinion about practicing repetition\nlearning from each and every misstep\nthat we are Ain shifts and changes in\nthese in these deepest deepest ways yeah\nand I think to you from me you know I do\nwork with couples a lot and and\nindividuals within the context of of\nrelationships but I think you know\nmoving from like book to practice or you\nknow hearing some insight to practice\nit's like I have it's crazy I've worked\nit I calculated this before like months\nago I don't even know maybe six months\nago that I had done 12,000 direct\ncontact hours with couples and I say\nthat because I think in theory we can\ntalk about what goes into creating a\nhealthy relationship and you know these\nare some of the things that you should\ndo but I really truly believe that\nunless you are working with couples you\ndon't really see what is actually going\non it is so much harder than what the\ntheory might suggest and I think for me\nthis idea of like\nthe fact that I have worked switched so\nmany couples and have really seen where\npeople get stuck and where it becomes\njust harder then then just like follow\nthe five snappier is is such an\nimportant part that I've been able to\nbring into the course so yeah well I you\nknow I think that makes you isn't it ten\nthousand hours makes you faster so where\ncan we find the practice from the\nrelationship master yourself where can\nanyone out there listening who is\ninterested whether they're single or\npartnered at the current moment or maybe\njust folding and family relationships\nwhere can they get more information on\nyeah so our course launches on September\n11th so we are only taking registration\nup until then and the link for it is in\nmy bio on Instagram which is at my full\nMFT it's also on my website which is New\nYork couples counseling comm and I think\nyou're gonna link it too right so yeah\nso I think they'll find it in lots of\ndifferent locations but yeah we have a\ncouple of weeks before we get started\nhere and so Punk to be able to chat\nabout this with you thank you for having\nme of course well that's incredible\nabsolutely everyone out there listening\nI will link it below in the show notes\nbut I do urge you I'm happy you got your\nhandle out there I do urge you everyone\nlistening to go over give a follow you\ngive great information and I'm sure\nwe'll be keeping and any future force\nlaunches keeping updated and I super\nappreciate finally getting to more\nofficially connect with you and have you\nI thought this was incredible thank you\nso so much\nAnna Thank You
