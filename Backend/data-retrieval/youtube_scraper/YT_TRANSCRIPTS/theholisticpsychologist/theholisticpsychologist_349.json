    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicole Parra the\nholistic psychologist here and as always\nthank you guys for tuning in this video\ntoday is going to be on the difference\nbetween trauma coupling and bonding and\nthen I'm going to talk a little bit\nabout where these patterns come from so\nwhen we're thinking about these patterns\nand I say relationship I really do mean\nall different types of relationships\nsometimes we'll see these in friendships\nsometimes we'll see these in family\nrelationships sometimes we'll see these\nof course in romantic partnerships like\nyou'll always hear me say we as humans\nare very habitual which means that if\nyou guys are starting to see some\nevidence of this trauma coupling in your\nrelationships you likely will be seeing\nthem across all the types of\nrelationships that you are in so what is\ntrauma coupling me trauma coupling is\noften rooted in emotional addiction so\nwhat do I mean when I say emotional\naddiction I think a lot of us when we\nthink of addiction only thing you know\nwe're chasing usually a feel-good\nfeeling the way I think of emotional\naddiction is actually based on\nneurotransmitters chemicals hormones\nthat were habitually used to feeling in\nour bodies so that doesn't mean that\nthey're always positive so I have listed\nfear rejection excitement I can throw in\nthere anxiety because I lived a version\nof this that I'll share with you in a\nlittle bit so doesn't mean that their\npositive emotions that we're seeking it\njust means that they're familiar another\nsign of a trauma coupling is a push and\npull dynamic or risky and impulsive\nbehaviors again it feels like a lot of\napproach and withdrawal that we see in\npartnership so we're one of the parties\nin a relationship is it's kind of\nfleeing and the other person is chasing\nthat kind of push and pull love and hate\ndynamic also with the risking impulsive\nbehaviors it's a lot of highs and a lot\nof lows in this type of partnership\nyou'll often hear me describing is\nwriting an emotional\nrollerCoaster little to no boundaries or\ncodependence now you guys know I'm\nalways talking about boundaries in these\ntrauma couplings a lot of the time the\nboundaries if they're even there or\nblurred this means not only physical\nboundaries how much time am i spending\nwith this person you know in their\nphysical presence\nit also means emotional boundaries it's\nalso like I said results in this\npush-pull this emotional roller coaster\nwhere one of the parties feelings\naffects both people involved another\nsign of it is a lack of emotional depth\nwhere that emotions are like I said they\ntend to be very predictable you know\nfear-based rejection these anxieties and\nthey're not really going down deep and\nseeing or feeling the whole spectrum of\nhuman emotions now a lot of times in\nthese partnerships both parties are\nhiding parts of their self they're not\nable to be they don't feel comfortable\nbeing there for authentic self with all\nthe feelings that each of us humans have\na lot of times it's because they don't\nfeel safe these relationships don't\nnecessarily feel safe so what do I mean\nwhen I say bonding bonding relationships\nare usually slow and steady and they\nactually deepen with time it don't kind\nof start off the bat and hit the crazy\nemotional high yes we all have a\nhoneymoon phase especially if we're\ntalking romantic partnerships or even if\nwe meet a really cool new friend we like\nthem but those really big spikes again\nat the high and low that we see in\ncoupling doesn't typically look like\nthat in bonding it's slow steady gradual\nit accumulates over time the feelings in\nthese relationships vulnerability and\nauthenticity is present there's a\nfeeling of safety so both parties feel\nable to show all of themselves good the\nbad the ugly all of it is safe there's\nan often\nbecause the reality is as us humans were\nnot all the time brain and shiny and in\nthis more bonded partnership we're able\nto show all parts of ourselves or\nexperience all parts of ourselves in\nthis relationship there's space of trust\nof acceptance like I said it all feels\nokay maybe uncomfortable but okay to\nbring to the table boundaries boundaries\nare present and again compared to the\nblurred boundaries of the trauma bond\nthere is what I call interdependence\nwhich is I'm a separate human whomever I\nam in a relationship with is a separate\nhuman and because of your social\ncreatures there obviously is a shared\nspace between us that we can experience\ntogether but it is not that emergence of\ndependency that we see a lot in that\ntrauma bond partnership again this\nallows for authentic or depth emotional\ndepth like I said it's not just surface\nso there's not just consistent patterns\nand feelings all feelings are present\nwhere does this come from\nso bonding and whether or not you're\ngoing to fall in the trauma coupling or\nthe bonding category this has learned\nfrom care errors I separated out three\nbig categories of caregivers that most\nof us have had sometimes we experience\nmerchants of a couple of these so if\nreceiving love or children the first\nexperiences with relationships that we\nhave are within our caregiving\nunit we see relationships happening\nabove us and we watch people relating\nand then we have relationships with\nthese people with our caregivers\nbrothers and sisters so we're taking in\nall of these informations really about\nhow to be in a relationship and then\neven though we grow we mature we start\nto develop peer friend groups romantic\npartnerships over time we still bring\nthese patterns in so what typically\nhappens because social bonds and feeling\nloved and understood and care for as a\nchild is of utmost importance when we\nreceive love or when love from a\ncaregiver is conditional or is only\nreceived if certain conditions are met\nthen like I said we typically adopt\nthose patterns of getting that need met\nthat we then live in our relationships\nas we mature so what are the three\ncategories conflicted a lot of times it\ngoes hand-in-hand with abuse whether\nit's a verbal sexual physical this means\nwhile a parent can be inflicting an\nincredible damaging pain and trauma on\nme this is also the human that I'm\nsupposed to love and care for it some\nparents actually do present with those\nboth sides we can be getting hit one\nminute and then being praised and told\nhow much how good we are and how loved\nwe are another for a child that's very\nconfusing that's very much that\npush-pull dynamic unpredictable this is\nthe parent who we can't we can't\nunderstand there's no pattern with\nwhat's gonna make maybe make them a\nruptor or remove their love from us or\nwhat punishment will ensue and this is\nhard as children bringing back this\nconcept of safety that I talked about\nearlier in my opinion we are very\nattuned as children and if we can see\npredictable patterns of okay dad doesn't\nlike messes so I have a bit of control\nas a child if I don't allow a mess in my\nroom I won't be on the other\nthat's punishment however some parents\nthat a lot of us had aren't as\npredictable so we're left feeling really\nunsafe in childhood\nanother type of parent and this is one\nthat I have had is a withdrawn parent\nparent who may be physically is there\nmeeting our needs but emotionally they\nare largely absent so if any of you\nlistening have experienced any of those\ntype of bonding experience or trauma\ntrauma couple things essentially in our\nchildhood typically that's gonna be what\nyou repeat then into your adulthood so\nthe example I wanted to share with you\nis a previous relationship actually a\nmarriage that I was in before the one\nthat I'm currently and now was based on\na trauma coupling I met someone who was\nvery much like my mother her language\nwas her predominant emotional experience\nbased on her childhood was out of\nanxiety so when I met this person I felt\nvery close and immediately bonded to her\nbecause that was my emotional experience\nboth with my mom and then with myself so\nI confuse that relatability around\nanxiety with a bond we followed a lot of\nthose trajectories as well they went\nvery quick there was a lot of an\nemotional rollercoaster happening when\nshe was anxious before I knew what I was\nanxious and then vice versa we were on\neach other's anxiety roller coaster\nagain both of us really confused that\nfor connection what I what happened then\nover time for me is I started to evolve\nI started to heal and I no longer\nexperienced the anxiety in that way\nwhich left me feeling a lack of\nemotional depth I looked around and I\ncouldn't couldn't feel much else of her\nan emotional world and I started to feel\nreally separate and we weren't able to\nheal together\nso speaking of healing what do you do if\nyou're out there listening and you find\nyourself checking more of the boxes in\ntrauma coupling first and foremost I\nwant to just throw this out there this\nis nothing to be shameful of I know a\nlot of times for a lot of us there's a\npart of ourself me too that's like I\ndon't know this doesn't feel like the\nhealthiest relationship some of us a\nfriend and family that are in arrears\ntelling us how this isn't the healthiest\nrelationship it can make us feel really\nshameful so something I just want to you\nknow throw out there to you guys is this\nis totally normal this is a pattern this\nis all you knew in childhood you're\nreally seeking in all of your\nrelationships friendships include it to\nreplicate that same familiar emotional\nfeeling that you've gotten used to and\nthat you've received love around in\nchildhood so as I always say the first\nstep is to be aware and then if you guys\nare interested I did an IG TV on me\nparenting that you guys can check out\nthe big point of healing if you find\nyourself in a trauma coupling even if\nyour partner maybe comes to the\nagreement that both of you are engaging\nin this trauma coupling healing happens\ninternally first where each of you as\nindividuals are going to go through\nevery parenting process to start to heal\nsome of these deeper wounds and meet\nyour own emotional needs\nyou can still remain in the relationship\nbut the healing really is individual and\nthen as each of you as individuals heal\nyour trauma coupling can shift very\nbeautifully into a lifetime bond so I\nhope you guys found this helpful if\nyou're interested in that follow-up\nvideo the holistic psychologist\nInstagram IG TV you can check that out\nhow to repair it and as always thank you\nguys for tuning in"
