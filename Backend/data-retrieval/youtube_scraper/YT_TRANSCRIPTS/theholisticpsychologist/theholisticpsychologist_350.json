    "transcript": "dr. nicola paraphyletic psychologists\nhere as always thank you guys for tuning\nin\nthis video is going to be on signs of\nhealing this video is so important\nbecause I think that a lot of us out\nthere are healing and we're actually\nseeing progress in our day and something\nthat I know about humans myself included\na lot of us tend to focus on where we're\nnot yet or the things that haven't\nchanged because the reality of healing\nin his holistic ways it's a long time\njourney there are going to be things\nthat are still habits things that are\nstill present things that we want to see\nchange in my own world as well so while\nI still want to evolve as a human I\nbelieve it's really important to start\nit on his progress to start to see the\nthings in ourself that I assure you are\nprobably there if you start to look\nseeing the progress each and every\nmoment that it's there so if you guys\nare listening and if you see any of this\nin your daily life\nnotice it notice how you're healing\nthat's gonna be so motivating to keep\nyou healing alright so what are some\nsigns of healing first and foremost\nyou're starting to become aware of your\nhabits of your patterns of your thoughts\nthe more each and every one of you\npractices is daily self observation that\nI'm always talking about watch yourself\nas you go throughout your day notice the\nhabits notice the patterns the more you\npractice this the more natural it will\nbecome this also applies to your\ninternal world you'll start to see\nyourself noticing through the day the\nthoughts that you're having that is by\nfar a sign of progress notice that too\nwhen someone else notices a lot of you\nout there are messaging me you know my\npartner's my family people are signing a\nlot of the clients I work with they're\nsaying people are starting to say hey\ngirl or boy or remember you're changing\nyou know that's great notice that when\nyou hear someone reflecting back to you\ntheir experience of you being different\nnotice that's\nfinnaly when other people can start to\nsee those shifts in you though you\nshould not rely on other people notice\nyourself first and foremost but notice\nacknowledged knowledge yourself and the\nwork that you're putting in when other\npeople are noticing a change it'll\nhappen three you can enjoy time alone I\nknow for a lot of us we're starting at a\nplace where a long time as threatening\nas scary it's overwhelming\nso as you evolve and as you begin to\nheal you'll start to notice this it's it\ngoes from let bad to less bad and then\nyou might even get to the time in the\nplace where it's enjoyable that is\ndefinitely a sign of healing us as\nhumans while we are social creatures and\nwe are always going to be interacting\nwith others we we all have a different\ndegree of need but we all in my opinion\nneed time alone and that the more\ncomfortable you become in that alone\ntime is a sign of healing of progress\nnotice for you can notice when your mind\nis creating a story this is like we were\ntalking about earlier the more you're\nstarting to become aware of your\nthoughts you'll probably start to notice\nthese stories these narratives these\ninterpretations that are coloring your\ndaily experience our mind is a narrative\nthinker a story maker the more you\nbecome internally aware and you're\nobserving your internal world the more\nyou're going to notice when your mind is\ncreating a story and that's going to\ngive you choice with whether or not that\nstory is accurate you don't have to\nbelieve the story that your mind is\ncreating you will start to notice those\nstories throughout your day and that is\nthe sign of healing I've you focus less\non trying to fix and\nothers again those of you who listen to\nme know I often talk about our limits of\ncontrol and I often draw a very small\ncircle around ourselves really just\nillustrating we cannot control other\npeople no matter how much we love them\nhow much we desperately want them to\nchange order different or be different\nin their relationship with us we cannot\nchange that the more you're healing the\nmore you're going to notice that you're\ngetting more and more comfortable with a\nvery uncomfortable reality as humans in\nmy belief we do not tolerate this well\nwe like feeling like we have control\nover everyone and everything and the\nreality of it is we don't so the more\nyou are able to just be more comfortable\nwith that that is a sign that you are\nhealing\nsix they're becoming less reactive when\nyou're triggered you're starting to\nnotice more and more space between the\nthings that would cause you to react\nangrily or sad or whatever it is you're\nnoticing more and more space between\nthat and a new response becomes possible\nthat's not to say that you don't feel\nthose ways internally but you're not\nreacting externally in the way that you\nnormally do kicking screaming or\ndissociating you're having more choice\nthat is a sign that you are healing\nseven you're becoming more aware of your\nown needs\nthis is bodybeast needs when is my body\ntired socialization ease when do I need\nto go out and be around others and when\ndo I need to go in and rest as you heal\nyou're going to become more and more in\ntouch with yourself in this way so that\nyou'll be able to identify\nthe needs that you have which are\ndifferent the needs that I have are\ngoing to be different than the needs\nthat any of you out there have it is\nreally our journey just to become aware\nof ourselves and you will and that is a\nsign that you are healing eight you're\ntaking things less personally as all\nthings this starts internally at first\nmeaning the more you realize that a lot\nof your emotions and your reactions in\nyour day are driven by your thinking\nmind meaning it's in your own world the\nmore you're aware of that in your in\nyour life the more you're going to be\nable to be aware of that in others so\nwhen my partner comes home from work and\nis grumpy and is short with me I can\ntake that as personally over time I can\nmaybe now assign the meaning of it's not\nme they had a bad day at work and that's\nokay that's separate from me that is\nassignment you are healing when you see\nand you're taking things less personally\nso those of you out there listening if\nyou're seeing evidence of any or all of\nthese in your life notice notice every\nday this is progress you guys are well\non your way to healing so thank you\neveryone who's already subscribed and if\nyou have it and you like it hit\nsubscribe that would be awesome thank\nyou"
