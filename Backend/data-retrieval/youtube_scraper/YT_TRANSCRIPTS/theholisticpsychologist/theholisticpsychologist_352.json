    "video_title": "Trauma manifests in the body: Talking the Polyvagal Theory with Justin Sunseri, LMFT",
    "transcript": "hello everyone so dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist here I have\nsomeone awesome mr. Justin Sunseri on\nhere today you guys might know him from\nhis totally amazing Instagram talks\nabout all things polyvagal so he is\nJustin LM ft I believe that sir handel I\nwill link this all accurately in the in\nthe notes below this video but he has an\nawesome Instagram account and really\ndoes share a lot about what we're going\nto be talking about today which is\npolyvagal so some of you listening might\nthink what the hell is that and he's\ngonna tell us all about what the hell it\nis and why we care and how to get\nstarted using some of the practical\napproaches in terms of regulating our\nnervous system so really cool he also\njustin has a really amazing podcast that\nalso talks about all things polybag also\nhe has a polyvagal man without further\nado thank you so much Justin for having\na chat with myself in the community I\nthink this is going to be invaluable so\nwelcome thank you my absolute pleasure\nlike anything I can do to spread just\nsome basic fundamental knowledge of how\nwe as humans connect but also how we\nrespond to danger and stress it seems\njust knowing these fundamental things\nhas a huge impact on people so I'm happy\nto I we spend Mercedes and I spent hours\non that podcast talking about about this\nstuff so I am absolutely pretty much\nthinking say obsessed or I call it hyper\nfocused I love it I learned about\npolitical theory about a year ago and\nalmost I would say almost every day\nI've spent learning about that or things\nin that sort of realm so yeah this is my\nabsolute passion right now I love it I\nlove and you could totally tell I love\nhow passionate you are and how where you\nare of this reality cuz I think a lot of\nus clinicians I don't I don't know if\nyou've gotten any of this training in\nschool I know I didn't so having come\nacross this and sought this out I think\nonce you know this it's hard to undo it\nespecially as a clinician and we are\ndoing the clients that we work with a\ndisservice if we don't understand so\ntalk to me what the heck is polyvagal\nand you did mention a concept I think\nthat a lot of listeners out there can\nrelate to you said the word\nstress and threat and all of that and I\nsay that cuz I hear that word a million\ntimes over where a lot of the humans\nthat I'm working with and living with it\nyou know experiencing on a daily basis\nmore often than not you hear when you\nasked how are you doing it's I'm\nstressed so talk to me how does this\nconnect and what the heck is this\npolyvagal the polyvagal theory is so\nlike in school and I think just people\nwho take learning about trauma series\nstudents I mean I love how passionate\npeople are about this stuff we hear that\nthere's a mind-body connection that\ntrauma lives in the body we hear about\nthings like flight and fight and like\nfries and all the other things so we\nhear these pieces of it but polyvagal\ntheory is really what ties everything\ntogether and like in school we learn\nabout mind-body connection but no one\never said what that is at least it from\nmy schooling they never really went into\ndepth but the Palio theory explains that\nwe receive cues from the outside world\nbut also from the inside world and that\nwe shift down it's called the polyvagal\nladder this is a political ladder it's a\nrepresentation of the hierarchy of the\ncircuitry in our nervous system so at\nthe top lives the safe and social\nengagement system where you can make eye\ncontact and smile and use vocal prosody\nwhich is like that up and down sing song\na kind of quality versus a more monotone\nlike talking like this and when we shift\ndown the ladder leave our first stop is\nflight mode and this is like sympathetic\narousal where we have to get away\nthere's danger and this is what I love\nis that polyvagal theory lays out and so\ndoes Peter Levine and his work that it's\na sequence of events not a menu of\noptions and when you call it a menu of\noptions which I know we do we're not\nhopefully not currently but you know in\nschool of what now we said well this\nperson responded by running away this\nperson responded by running by fighting\nthis person collapsed or froze or did\nnothing or what looks like nothing and\nthere's anis there's like an element of\nblame there or accusation or questioning\nor judgment and the polyvagal theory\nbreaks down that's not we're choosing no\none's choosing these things we just do\nthem so if we can't be safe and social\nwe drop down into flight behaviors if\nthat doesn't work our next stop is\nfighting and this is if we perceived\nthat we can run away that we can't fight\nit sometimes you know in the presence of\nlike a police officer or a\nschool principal there's a power\ndifferential there so the perception of\nbeing able to run away may not even be\nthere so we might drop down to the\nbottom part of the ladder which is shut\ndown and that's where we basically the\nbody goes limp and collapsed\ndissociation happens there and then\nthere's which I love here there's dr.\nPortis when I he's the father of the\npolyvagal theory pic home\nwhen I interviewed him he specifically\nsaid that the Free State and the\nshutdown state are different things and\neven I had made the mistake of confusing\nthe language there but he broke down\nthat when we shut down it's more of a\nclass kind of thing and when we freeze\nthat's really more of a combination of\nshut down plus sympathetic arousal so\nshut down Plus wanting to fight or run\naway and when these two things happen\nday to day it feels like panic when you\npanic like you're supercharged your mind\nis going a mile a minute but your body\nstops like you you kind of freeze up\nright this happens to be on this bridge\nthere's this bridge that goes to San\nFrancisco and I panic I don't do well\nwith Heights\nbut this bridge in particular it's one\nlane and it feels like I'm driving into\nthe sky and I freaked out and so my body\nlike it really tenses up I grabbed the\nsteering wheel super tight so panic is\nreally this experience of wanting to\nshut down but also being sympathetically\ncharged so that's that's what the\npolitical theory is it lays out this is\na sequence of events that all human\nbeings all mammals that we go through\nand something we're choosing to do I\ndon't want to freeze when I go up that\nbridge I want to go through it\npeacefully and you know how enjoy my\ndrive and look out over the water but my\nbody for some reason even though I know\nit's safe I know my car is new enough so\nI kind of collab like it's like at a\nbreak all of us been there forever it's\ngonna be good but my body for some\nreason detects that I'm in mortal danger\nand wants tonight shut down yeah I love\nthat you I love that you are pointing\nthat reality out but this is outside of\nour conscious control this is actually a\nlower order a back part the way I'm\noften describing it of our of our brain\nwhere it does limit choice and I say\nthat because I do think that sometimes\nespecially after the fact when our\nconscious mind comes back online if you\nall right we can start to feel maybe\nshameful about the the reaction\nthat we're seeing herself have or after\nthe fact of Ewing herself\nretrospectively of having had in that\nmoment I think it's really important\nthat you acknowledge and that the\nlisteners out there hear that again this\nis is this as a nervous system response\nhappening outside of our conscious\nawareness and I love what you ended on\nis not often touched by logic we cannot\nlogic our way or rationalize our way\nfrom from those responses in that moment\nbecause it's just not as powerful and\nthat lower-order brainy totally and it\ncan't it's the brain stem area it can\nabsolutely help but just for me\npersonally like I knew the bridge was\ncoming I saw coming and I'd done this\nmultiple times like I know it's there I\nprepare myself I held my wife's hand\nwhich usually helps me kind of ground\nlike I like physical touch mm-hmm and\nnothing was helpless whatsoever except\nfor what helped me was this just didn't\nairy what was happening out loud that\nkind of help me for some reason\nbut it yeah it's not like you can just\nlearn it's not exactly like you can just\nlearn a coping skill and download that\nlike coping software and you're good to\ngo oh I've got a new thought technique\nbecause I'm good like yeah it's usually\na bit more complex than that yeah yeah\nabsolutely absolutely but as I say\nthere's two steps of change really\nputting it simply and awareness and you\nknow and I think this really does kind\nof go into that awareness bucket so if\nyou're out there listening anyone what\nthey're listening you know when you do\nhave a history of those kind of flight\nfight whatever they are freeze type of\nbehaviors that you know maybe at a time\ndue to originate I think this is part of\nit too at a time might maybe some of\nthose moments did originate with those\nthe big t the big trauma right the big\nbad thing that happened not all the time\nis that the case but what more I think\nbecomes the case is that becomes an the\nhabitual coping mechanism that then we\nuse over time so I say that because a\nlot of us could see be seeing those\nbehaviors or those coping you know kind\nof tools or if you will happening at a\ntime now when there don't really map on\nto something big and bad and scary\nthat's happening it's just kind of like\na remnant of that nervous is it\nthe theory lays out and again Peter\nlooking to me these really go hand in\nhand that we can get stuck in these\nmodes or in these our nervous system not\nlike we're choosing to again but that\nour nervous system can actually get\nstuck there and it's possible to be\nstuck there for a long lot like decades\nwell that's you know well they know so\nit's you can get stuck did that that\nlike flight energy to fight energy can\nget stuck especially when you go through\nwhat we call more of a freeze response\nwhere you basically are immobilized or\nyour body shuts down while being\nextremely fearful I think it's the basic\nway to put it that the that's that\nenergy can get stuck in your system and\nreally stay there for a long time until\nyou allow that process to complete\nitself and Peter Levine is he's really\nthe man to go to for that I read lion\ndoes some really really good work on\nthat also but that these things can stay\nwithin you and it's absolutely not a\nchoice to keep them there of course but\nit just learning these things can help\nit can help someone become unstuck and I\nlike to say I'm stuck and not broken not\nnot like the word we use the word heal\nand it doesn't make sense but really\nit's you're not broken you're stuck this\nthis sister system is literally stuck in\nthese defensive states this also could\nbe you know day to day more of a\nstressful and like they used stress\nbecause for me I'm always thinking like\ndanger and whatnot and trauma but really\nif you have a stressful job what you're\nreceiving from the outside potentially\nare these cues of danger we call it and\nthat might be very very simple things\nlike the background low base noise of a\nheater or air conditioner if you work in\na public school system there's all kinds\nof noises that you hear street people\nyelling potentially gunshots depending\non where you're at like that's you know\nhear those things the rattle of air\ncrisper kicking on people stomping\noutside of your door like there's all\nthese like deep sounds or shocking\nsounds that you hear that can send you\ndown the ladder and put you in more of\nlike an anxious place and day to day you\nmay not even notice it but you know if\nyou're grinding your teeth like I do\nthat a lot if you grind your teeth or if\nyou like you know tap your pen like\nyou're your body has this energy and is\ntrying to get out\nbut it's not working because you're not\nmindful plus using the using the body\nmovements that make sense\nlike it's not good enough to just tap\nyour leg all that it doesn't really\ndischarge the energy have to do is\ncombine that you're mindful of it and\nthis really comes from like meditation\ncan be a great place to do this to\nreally be mindful of what you're going\nthrough and allowed that energy\ndischarge to happen but it could be\nliterally a my opinion anything example\nin my podcast that I talked about was\nriding my daughter scooter which I\ndidn't break I fit it it's being\nmindfully aware of how it felt for me to\ngo faster to go slower how does it feel\nin my hands till I grip the rubber\nhandles how does it feel to just glide\nalong and make turn sharp turns and just\nto experience not just do it but to\nactually experience it and it's really\nlike I notice when I do that my\nbreathing changes and that tells me that\nthere's something going on in my nervous\nsystem that is becoming unstuck or is\nkind of releasing yeah you're really\ntalking about what I talked about a\nmillion times over which is\nconsciousness and when I say that I just\nmean being present to where our\nattention is with the choice the best\nchoice in my opinion at least always\nbeing the current moment so I love that\nyou're really practical so I think what\nI'm hearing you say is the more we\nutilize that consciousness and that\npresence you know showing up for\nwhatever is going on if we're on the\nscooter and we're going fast or slow if\nwe're having a nice relaxing sit at a\nbeach or in nature or whatever it is\nbeing fully there I'm hearing that that\nalso does translate to kind of that\nnervous is some shift that's helpful it\ndoes like there's the it's literally\nsomething you can do throughout the day\nis just notice even it's like little\nincrements because looking inward is\nterrifying for a lot of people and you\ndon't have to close your eyes you don't\nhave to like do your deep breathing it\ncan't be helpful but if you want to\nstart by just noticing what it feels\nlike to wiggle your toes start there and\nbut you have to actually notice that you\nhave to like how does my breathing\nchange what like what sensations do I\nhave what a feeling what thoughts pop in\nmy mind from simple things or if I do\ncontrol my breathing and extend my\nexhale which could be really helpful\nwhat kind of set what's that experience\nlike for me and to be very curious and\nnot evaluative not judgmental\nthose are accused of danger but be\nreally curious and and like want to\nlearn about what your body is telling\nyou okay it's really connecting the bots\nthe body's sensations to the awareness\nthe mindful awareness of those\nsensations yeah absolutely and I like\nthat suggestion because when I talk\nabout meditation as like a structured\npractice a lot because I think that\ngives us the I call it the arena you\nknow to practice that mental exercise as\nbeing separate from our thoughts first\nand foremost because so many of us you\ndo believe are merged with our thinking\nminds but then it also allows us to\npractice viewing our thoughts\nnon-judgmentally and then furthermore to\npractice moving our attentional focus\nand bringing it into the current moment\nhowever I think for a lot of people that\ncan feel overwhelming the practice of\nsitting so my second suggestion is if\nyou are one of those people listening\nwho do you feel like that more sitting\nkind of structured practice of\nmeditation is overwhelming because to\nspeak to your point that you just made\nour internal worlds can be downright\ndistressing at times you know I'm often\neven but using those practical ways is\ndefinitely a suggestion that I give all\nof my clients as well so how can you\njust go filled mindful moments because\nsomething that you also acknowledge\nthose go really do go a long way and if\nyou just make a habit of checking in\nwith where is my attention and can I put\nit fully into what I'm doing whether\nit's in my body or what's happening in\nmy current moment outside of me I think\nthat those moments go much longer of a\nway so anyone listening while you know\nmeditation is a great structured\npractice to have it can allow you to\npractice you know navigating thoughts\ndifferently internally I think that just\nas helpful is been finding those moments\nin a given day to do the same yeah\nthere's\nthere's things that I not reply and\nthere's things like sorry that's get\nthere yeah all right there's things like\ndrawing or art just some sort of\ncreative outlet writing can be so\nhelpful with these things but the trick\nis again to be mindful and I used to\njust draw but now more when I do draw\nnow I'm like well how does my body feel\nabout what I'm drawing next up now so\nit's less about what I want it to look\nlike\nwell and my body will tell me like and I\nlisten to my chest and my my belly area\nespecially it'll tell me like move my\narm faster and I know it sounds super\nweird now but really it does it's like\nokay so I'm supposed to move like this\nand to not worry and not evaluate what\nso the lady froze hold our frozen them\nall right we're back all right we're\nback to perfect I love that so you're\ntalking about drawing and and just to\nyour internal your body kind of compass\ncues yeah yeah so I just listen to how\nmy body feels and I'll be like a sweat a\nslight I experience it as a slight\nlittle to me it feels like a little acid\nlike I my stomach like a little like a\nlittle pinch and that tells me oh let's\ndo something else so I just listen to\nhow I feel about my creative outlets and\nI follow that and it's I feel my\nbreathing change I feel a release and\nthat's that that is I think kind of like\nmeditative and in a way but it's not\nlike I'm sitting there just going inward\nI'm doing something I'm moving enough\nand you notice how does it feel to draw\nslow or paint slow or whatever how does\nit feel to move faster here's notice\nlike as I do this what how did my body\nrespond music not just creating music\nthat's of course awesome but listening\nto music I find to be a way for me cuz I\ndon't create music and I don't like\ndancing either but listening to music I\nfind to be really like it releasing in a\nway and so if I'm listening to something\nand noticing that I'm not connecting\nwith it or I'm not able to like focus on\nit responds like a podcast that so I\nhave to ask myself am I in a place where\nI just need silence and so I allow there\nto be silence and then I'll notice as I\nhave silence I allow myself to kind of\nget back up to me that's like kind of\nlike a shutdown sort of place where I\njust want to like be quiet and I want to\nbe in word and just kind of be quiet you\nknow so once I do that a little bit they\ndon't listen my body I'll be like okay\nnow I'm ready for some music and what\nI'll listen from for me it's heavy metal\nI was now like heavy metal music after\nthat or something more aggressive and\nI'm going up the ladder from shutdown\ninto this sort of aggressive fight mode\nnot fighting people I'm just like\nlistening to you and then from there I\ncan listen to my body be like right now\nI'm ready for something else and I'll\nlisten to something more like all these\nEtta James as usually my go-to just\nsomething very peaceful it's like lots\nof prosody and it brings me it helps me\nget out of like a fun like a like a sort\nof like shut down you know place and\ninto this more you know safe and social\nI'm ready to\nconnect with people or play some music\nas well can be extremely healing if as\nlong as you're aware of your body\nsensations while listening to music\ndon't just listen to that of habit but\nlike how does it feel what's the\nexperience of this music why what's your\nbody telling you about what you're\nlistening what is this what is it about\nthat music that appeals to so much you\nknow yeah I love that\nI love those suggestions Justin because\nyou're really talking about for what\nsome of us is rebuilding a connection\nfirst and foremost to our body - like\nyou said back the suggestion given what\ndoes it feel like just to be in your\nbody to wiggle your toes but then\nobviously extending that and then okay\nonce I've just grounded myself in my\nbody and I just want to acknowledge that\nsaying a lot of people listening you\nknow might be sitting on the far end of\ndisconnect from their body so the first\nI think step is let's learn how to\nreconnect with our body and then I think\nwe can expand and use our body as a\nguidance tool exactly as you are and you\nknow what's making me feel good how is\nthis making me feel and then asking\nthose more exploratory questions and\nusing the feedback that our systems are\ngiving us naturally anyway so it's a\nthing so those of you listening if\nyou're not feeling this consistently at\nleast connect it to your body it's not\nthat your your intuition does not exist\nor it's not that those singles aren't\nthere they're there and I think that's\nthe important reality is to realize\nthey're still there they've always been\nthere they've never went away we've just\nbecome more disconnected likely because\nwe're more in our thinking Mynor more in\nthat shutdown place so I think the first\nstep is to reconnect with the body so\nthat then over time you can start to\nhear those cues and see them and use\nthem in these moments that I love the\nsuggestions are giving to you do mm-hmm\nI'm glad that you pointed out that you\ncan or that listeners like you can it's\nnot like it's done these things aren't\nbroken you can you can connect with\npeople like it's still there you can it\nis possible trust people they've maybe\nbeen broken and maybe you are in more of\na defensive state and I don't blame you\nI really don't but it's not like it's\nlost it\nthe possibility is there but we need to\nhave safe and social cues from the\noutside world and use this from other\npeople we have to have the possibility\nfor safe connection Plus stay\nenvironments and the reality is not all\nof us get those sadly but that really is\nhow we work our way up is by being safe\nthat's that's the heart of therapy as\nbeing in a relationship in a safe\nenvironment with a safe person and that\nwill allow you to feel tip-tippy feel\nsafer in looking inward experiencing\nyour body talking about difficult things\nthat's really the heart of therapy is\nbuilding a safe building safety\nyeah I agree now let me ask you justin\nis there are there universal factors to\nconsider when we talk about safety so\nthe opposite of the threat environment\nwhether it's external or internal or\nthey do they really individually differ\nas it are kind of our task to figure out\nwhat it is that safety is for us or are\nthere some like I said more Universal\nthings to consider again whether we're\ntalking in the external environment or\nour internal environment I think that\nthere are and not just as human beings\nbut also just mammals in general when\nyou hear when you hear like a load bass\nsound that's a danger cue but if you\nhear someone who's using more vocal\nprosody and they have that singsong\nequality that is universally a safety\ncue if you have a dog you know that if\nyou have more prosody in your voice they\nrespond to that differently then if you\nhave more of a like shameful sort of you\nknow I know you ate the cookie sort of\nthing yeah yeah no just to confirm for\nthe listeners porosity is is that kind\nof what like talking to a baby that kind\nof singsong that's perfect exactly the\nparents do that and I must say like talk\nto each other is like your baby what I\nplayful you know up and down range and I\nthink that if you have more masculine\nvoices a little bit harder to pull that\noff but I think I have enough prosody\nthat people can hear that I'm safe and\neven like that when you ask a question\nyou sort of like at the end of the\nquestion you sort of go up right like\nyou ask a question so that's the ability\nto use your voice to express how you\nfeel and people who are in a flight mode\nor fight or shut down they don't do that\nthey've lost the capability in that mode\nto be able to use vocal Prostate that\nare more likely if you're in if you're\nin fight mode you're more likely to use\na date\nto our deep bass tone and it might be\nmore forceful in your language if you're\nin flight mode you your voice may pick\nup in pitch in talking about like it\nbecause you're sort of signaling in\ndanger and if you're shut down it\nbecomes very quiet very flat very kind\nof Numb being hearing those vocal\nprosody seeing people use their I\ncrinkles everything from like what's\nthis area the the you know eyes up\nbasically above the nose that area is\nhuge for mammals you could tell a lot\nabout where someone's at just by their\nbut that by the top of their face\nbasically so you know I crinkles suggest\nthat I'm listening to you and if I'm\nlistening to you that means I'm in a\nsafe state that means I'm a safe mammal\nso that's a universal cue to mammals or\nto at least know human beings I don't\nknow I don't have dogs respond to that\nbut if I'm not in a good space my eyes\nbecome wider like if I'm in danger mode\nor if I hear danger my eyes go wide\nmy whole body freezes so if I'm able to\nyou know rock back and forth\nthat means I'm safe if I'm like that\nmeans okay my body's like has this way I\ncan hear music I can you know dance not\nthat I would but I could so that yet I\nthink there's some very universal cues\nof safety that all of us pick up on\nright well I'm hearing some of that too\nis outside of our control right so if\nwe're talking about human on the other\nend of the conversation obviously where\nthey are in nurse T you know in their\nnervous system state it's going to\naffect the quality of their speech is\ngoing to be that which we can't control\nright so again I think it's just being\naware then possibly of how we are\nfeeling in response to if we are having\nto interact with someone that is in one\nof those kind of you know lower wronged\nstates on the ladder right if they're in\ntheir own fight fight or flees freeze\nmood then just being aware of the effect\nthat's carrying within us and obviously\nif we have a choice either end the\nexchange or not you know and navigate\nthat person to begin with obviously that\nmight be the better choice especially as\nwe're trying to find our own safe\nmoments and save people\nwe are healing so so I think that's part\nof it it's just to be aware of how other\npeople are or how were we or this way\nare reacting to other people absolutely\nif you have some control over who you\nreact with and you can if someone's not\nsaying for you it's okay to not interact\nwith them on a day-to-day basis you can\navoid it but I know people are asked are\nwondering or they're going back to the\nway they grew up and they're recognizing\nyou know my mom or dad or my parent did\nnot provide these safety cues they were\nalways sort of flat or are like\ndisconnected and they're probably\nwondering right now like well how did\nthat affect me and yeah so that's called\nCo regulation is when you provide these\nsafe and social cues that's called Co\nregulation that you're you're providing\nsafety and kids feed off of that and\nbuild their ability to be safe\nco-regulators\nbut that also builds their ability to\nself-regulate and self-regulation is\nbuilt off of Co regulation so we do have\nto have especially in early childhood I\nthink is the most important it's not too\nlate but we do have to have Co\nregulators so people that are in their\nsafe and social state that can provide\nkeys of safety and provide actual safety\nas well and a lot of people a lot of\npeople do not get that when they when\nthey're growing up yeah that's kind of\nthat's the common thread I see with all\nof my clients is that there's a lack of\nhealthy Co regulation healthy attachment\nthat is underlies I think every single\nperson I've ever met with I work with\nmost of kids ya know I'm gonna extend\nthat dress I'm gonna say that I find\nsimilarly too I think that in some way\nshape or form we are carrying whether\nit's in our nervous system or but the\neffects of the lack of that co\nregulation in our because we're humans\nraising humans I mean I really just\nsimplify it to that I'm no ill intent of\nthe caregivers you know and it's often\nwe cannot as you'll often hear me say we\ncan't give someone else our children\ninclude a things that we don't give\nourselves we have a parent that\nstruggles in their own emotional\nregulation then chances are they're not\ngoing to be able to meet their child and\nhelp their try\nand Caligula their child's emotions so\nagain of no of no ill intent but I think\nthat's a reality and I am a living\nbreathing you know example of that from\nmy own personal life so living in just\ntwo always on edge always something was\na family motto really but that just\nmeant always activate it always stressed\nalways always always some sort of\nnervous system activation going on which\nresulted in to a large extent my parents\nmy caregivers being emotionally\nunavailable to me so I I'm a living\nexample of that dysregulation so a lot\nof my own healing journey was doing this\ndeeper level work and especially someone\nwho had the outward then experienced a\nsymptom if you will of anxiety and my\npanic attacks Justin might as well have\nbeen my 20s I mean might as well been\none panic attack after another it was a\ndecade of a nightmare of it right so\nagain I see that as the symptom of this\ndysregulated nervous system which I\nbelieve at least that I carried from\nchildhood like I think a lot of us do so\nI wasn't able to really get a grasp on\nmy own anxiety until not only did I\nbring my body into physiological balance\nbecause that was driving some of it but\nuntil I understood the role that my\nnervous system this regulation was\nhaving that I continued to carry now it\nI mean I'm distance I'm not in that\nfamily environment but I was still\ncarrying it and nervous system\naccusation that's that's exactly the way\nit goes and you touched upon you call\nthem I think you basically air quoted\nsymptoms right that the the medical\nmodel of looking at these things as\nillnesses I've I don't buy into that I\nnever have it never fit for me and\nhearing political theory it's now it's\nnow it's an issue of being stuck not\nbeing ill not being defective not being\nbold effective not having in my opinion\na chemical imbalance because no one's\nmeasuring for that anyways but now it's\nan issue of being stuck and now we can\nconnect that to okay well what where am\nI stuck you know where is my body stuck\nand usually people will trace it back to\nchildhood but it could easily happen\nafter childhood as well where am I stuck\nand then the question is well how do I\nget unstuck and that's a lot different\nthan saying I have these symptoms I'm\nsomehow born defective and then what do\nI do about that that's a lot to me\nthat's a much different prognosis for\nwhen you look at things Paulie vaguely\nand dr. Porter's laid this out\ntried to push him on it but he laid it\nout a little bit my interview with him\nthat this is an issue of being stuck in\na defensive state and then how do we\ncope with that and some people cope with\nthat through it through drinking some\npeople cope with that by throwing desks\naround the classroom because they cannot\nhandle this it the state that their\nnervous system is in and they're\nattempting to release the energy somehow\nor because they're not getting Co\nregulation from a safe teacher or safe\nparent so how we deal with these things\nlooks different and then people like you\nand I come along and say well we call it\nwe'll call it this diagnosis right but\nreally issue is not the label really the\nissue is we're stuck in a defensive\nstate and you're there for a reason\nand every time I hear that reason I go\noh yeah that makes total sense and I I\ndon't look at someone and say well yeah\nyou're ill that makes complete sense i\nif I lived your life I would have the\nsame reaction whereas I'm a mammal - I'm\na human being - like it sounds like you\ndidn't get what you needed I cannot\nblame you for that and I also don't\nblame the parents I'm glad you said that\nbecause the parents say they they they\nreceive parenting probably in a very\nsimilar way and these things pass on but\nsaying you're stuck that defensive state\nhas so much more Hope than you're ill or\nyou're chemically imbalanced or you have\nsome sort of genes that have been passed\non to you that I can't measure for ISO\nto me to spit perfectly but the way that\nI view the people I work with which is\nyou just stuck ID you can do better I\nfully believe in you and there's tons of\nhope and it totally makes sense why\nyou're Stein mm-hmm\nI totally agree and I say similarly I\ncall everything that I end up working\nwith someone to break an adaptation I\nthink it was us doing the best that we\ncan at the time you know when we are we\nwere much more limited you know in many\nways and again it just became stored in\nthat subconscious and there's so a\nfunction for it we just need to teach\nourselves and update you know all of the\nother tools that are available but I\nthink that mammals us humans mammals are\nincredibly adaptive creatures and I\nthink that I love the way that you you\nframe that so you've already got given\nsome really great examples right soso\nokay so what if we are someone out there\nis in that overactive nervous system\nbeing aware of our cues for safety I\nthink is what I'm hearing it\noverwhelming suggestion right your your\nway find the people the places that feel\nsafe connecting with our bodies right I\nthink that's something else I heard\nusing that you know kind of mind-body\nconnect using those mindful moments\npeppered throughout our day can be\nreally really helpful to to being able\nto stay ground it and give ourself a cue\nof safety you mentioned something too\nit's interesting because I know I talked\nabout breathwork a lot but you you in\nyour description you said my breath\nchanges is that another kind of thing to\njust kind of navigate and keep in mind\nas well when we're talking from a\npolyvagal lens or yeah dr. Portis says a\nlot and I course we agree but you know\nif you control your breath that can't be\nhealing like as if you know basically\nextending the exhale but what I find for\nmyself is that when I listen to a\nmeditation that's describing like how\nlong to hold my breath or either because\nsomething called the it's basically\nbreathe in for four seconds hold it for\nseven when I do that that puts me in the\nstate of evaluation and I'm wondering am\nI doing this right am i counting right\nshould I be saying Mississippi and so I\nyou know I don't really that's not super\ngrounding for me that that style so I\nfind it just for me personally I find it\nmore helpful to just be aware of how I'm\nbreathing and to be aware of my what my\nchest say says but what my gut says\nthat's dope that's my navigation just\nthose two areas for most part and from\nthere when I draw or yep pretty much\nwhen I draw actually pretty much\nanything I do if I'm running a scooter -\nlike I listen to those things I do what\nthose things tell me and then I notice\nall I'm breathing easier now\nso vert is one way you can do it is by\ncontrolling your breath that works for\nyou have at it but if you're like me in\nthe the controlled breath thing is kind\nof limiting I like to just listen to how\nI feel and then I notice\noh my breathing changed naturally and\nthe same thing happens with music that\nif I shut off music and have quiet my\nbreath will change or if I need to come\nup the ladder into this more aggressive\nstate which is okay that's that's it\ngoes from shutdown to fight to flight to\nsafety so I recognize I'm going up the\nladder then my breathing will change and\nI might be sounds right now that's fine\noh yeah I'm breathing differently I'm\nthinking differently I'm ready for music\nnow I'm ready for more stimulation I\nlisten to some heavy metal it's the\nwhole sequence I went through and I\nnoticed that as I do that my breathing\njust naturally changes I will also\nextend my exhale I do that in therapy a\nlot I'll notice how I'm breathing and\nreally kind of let it out slowly to make\nsure I'm grounded so a either path I\nthink it's totally fine or if you have\nyour own technique you know that's fine\ntoo there's not just like one path that\nyou have to and I think that meditation\nis fantastic I've been doing more and\nmore of that just in my own way but like\nI said earlier guy scares the heck out\nof some people clothes yeah so there's\nno pressure to like close your eyes and\nsit in quiet rooms that's not for you\nyou don't do it I would rather be active\nbe active but well I think what I'd\nasked is just be mindful of it and then\nnotice how that affects your breathing\nyeah yeah yeah I love that I love that\nsuggestion cuz you're also talking on I\nthink the individuality of a lot of\njourneys for each of us and I love that\ntoo because I get questions often you\nknow what exactly do you do or you know\ngiving me this idea that there's a\nuniversally that there's a formula that\nlies to everyone and I don't believe any\nof those things to be the truth I don't\nthink so I think there's things that can\nbe helpful but I'm not gonna dance\nthat's not my thing\nyeah with my kids maybe but I don't\ndance that's not going to happen so it's\ngiving me a prescription to go dance\nlike it's not gonna happen but if you\ntell me to go draw or paint I'll do that\nand that'll help out a lot and I know\nthat works for my body so this is so\nindividualized that it's I when people\nask that how do I climb up the ladder\nI'm like I don't know you I don't I\ncan't response it's not I don't do\ntherapy online but or out of my state\nbut like I can't just say we'll do this\nthing so we have a bull Mercedes and I\ndid a few episodes about our techniques\nwe have some listener techniques which\nis really cool and there's literally I\nthink an unlimited amount of things that\nyou can do but I don't know the person\nand you have to become curious and\nfigure out my body likes this it doesn't\nlike that\nI'll do more of this less of that this\nperson's feel safe to be around this\nperson not so much let me reduce this\nincrease that so it's like a trial and\nerror kind of thing and just coming from\na place of genuine curiosity and\nbuilding from there yeah I love that\nthat you keep coming back to that word\nthat concept of curiosity - yeah I think\nthey're not evaluation yeah the more\nthat we can look at just us life\nteachers I mean you'll hear me say\ntriggers our teachers things like that\nget curious just asks yourself the\nexploratory questions and I think the\nmore and I weave this in in terms of the\nmeditation piece the more that we can\nget away from what I think is we've all\nevolved into the more natural tendency\nwhich is to be a value it's it to judge\nto see see things very simply in that\nblack-and-white sense and I think when\nwe can break that habit in all ways and\nunderstand that there's there is no\nright wrong there there's no universal\nthere is just finding your way back into\nconnection with yourself which i think\nis also going to apply when you're using\nthis theory which i think is incredible\nand I think this is this you know I'm\nhoping at people out there listening you\nknow kind of maybe have some\nunderstanding that they've gained or you\nknow a practical way to start to employ\nsome of this but we're talking about I\nthink some really pivotal stuff here\nJustin and necessary stuff because you\nknow I think those of you listening room\nmay be beginning to understand the\nreally impactful role that that this\ndeeper this nervous system these fight\nfight or freeze modes and might even be\nable to see and observe of themselves\nnow in their daily life those moments\nwhere they are acting from that lower\nrung of the ladder and maybe have you\nknow some new language for understanding\nabout what it is and why it is that\nthat's happening and then I love these\nsuggestions that you just gave of you\nknow how to start to evaluate people\nenvironments around this concept of\nsafety how to build a reconnection back\nwith the self that does have I think is\nyou and I agree that internal guidance\nsystem that that knowing sense that's\ndeeper and that's there and that's\nspeaking and once we become more\nconnected we'll be able to use that as\nwe move ourselves just to kind of make\nsure I'm right right up the room into\nthat social that connected that I think\nand again as a mammal we are very social\ncreatures so you know I think that\ncoming up the ladder is of importance\nfor so many reasons for us as humans not\nonly for our survival but to give us a\nfulfilling relationships in life and\nand all of that I think that comes with\nthat higher highest rung which is where\nwe're able to interact with other humans\nit's yeah interaction safe relationships\nfulfilling life sleep you know being in\na safe and social place means you can\nimmobilize you can lay down and be calm\nand be okay with that but people who are\ndown the ladder laying down\nTrillian lights off closing their eyes\nthey go somewhere else they go because\ntheir body is stuck in this place and\nthey go right there because now all the\nstimulation is turned off and now\nthey're left with being immobilized or\nbeing still but and you know all these\nthoughts pop it in their brain about\nalways about the past of course or\nstress about the future the next day and\nwhat do I have to do at work and stuff\nlike that yeah 100% yeah I'm happy you\npointed that out because sleep and\npre-sleep time for many of the clients\nthat I work with are a really\nproblematic it is where our mind goes\noff to the races to one of those two\nareas back past their future and in a\nreally unhelpful way and I'm really glad\nthat you pointed that out but that too\nis a function of this of this nervous\nsystem response that is as crazy as this\nmight sound like oh my bed my bedrooms\nunsafe but it is the darkness of silence\nto stop it can still because I think\nsometimes to these cues of safety aren't\nour threat aren't always as apparent\nfrom the surface I mean you think\nsomething like that your bedroom might\nbe the most lush safe looking place but\nlike you're saying there's something\nunderlying that your nervous system is\nbeing queued on that it's responding to\nand it's not seeing the lush pillows and\nthe Oasis that you maybe created it's\nresponding like you're saying to the\ndark or the laying or the silence or\nwhatever it is that comes along with it\nso I think that's something else\nimportant to highlight to that again\nanother way we're not as logical because\nour nervous system is detecting\nsometimes things that are not visual to\nus or not as a parent for what they mean\ncause we're your existing in these\nstates throughout the day of being down\nthe ladder in a more stressed out or\npanicky or shutdown place and we cope\nwith those by you know watching TV maybe\ndrinking maybe positive ways by\nsocializing with people so we\nwe Co put these in different ways right\nbut then at the end of the day we shut\nthose ways off and we're left with we're\nleft with stuff that we were coping with\nand hasn't healed it hasn't gotten\nunstuck it hasn't progressed it's still\nthere so the issue is becoming unstuck\nnot just dealing with stuff not just\ncoping but actually becoming unstuck and\nmoving up into your safe and social\nplace and once you do that you'll be\nable to lay down and go to sleep\nwith probably little problem yeah I love\nthat I love that thank you for this\nwhole conversation Justin I think this\nis going to be really helpful for people\nout there listening and I am gonna link\neverything about you in the notes down\nbelow so that everyone can check you out\nand I definitely suggest everyone\nlistening visit his Instagram he's on\nthere just as frequently as I am and is\nalways sharing really helpful knowledge\nand I think his podcast is pretty badass\ntoo so all of that you can find and you\nwill be all find below and thank you for\ntaking the time to chat I super\nappreciate it Justin thank you and keep\nputting this out to the world because I\nthink this is incredibly nice I mean I\nthink all clinicians are gonna need to\nbecome first in this so thank you for\nshowing the way that's totally a goal of\nmine and just thank you again you've\nyou've given me a couple shout outs and\nso many people have come over and they\nsay dr. Nicole sent me and I'm like okay\nI'm definitely taking this seriously\nokay like that there's so much I think\nby in the premier community and there's\nso much community and they take it\nreally seriously so I'm like I'm not\ngonna miss ride out this okay okay yeah\nno I love it and I had I mean I have to\nand I will keep shouting you out because\nlike I said this is pivotal information\nand I know many innumerable people in my\ncommunity or struggling in these these\ndeeper ways so I want them to have their\nhands on some of these not only the\ninformation but the tools to start to\nuse because without that I don't think\nthat we're all going to be fully able to\nheal so thank you thank you for taking\nthe time and thank you so much"
