    "transcript": "so this is going to be a quick video\nover viewing the concept of reap Aron\nting what is your parenting reparing is\nthe fact that each of us now in\nadulthood are really responsible for\nteaching ourselves and meeting all of\nthe needs that many of us did not get\nmet one way or another in childhood so\nthose of you listening even if you\ndidn't have the big glaring bad thing\nthat happened to you and childhood\nchances are you were not fully given all\nof the tools to succeed really in many\nareas of life so now as an adult it's\nour job to teach ourself to essentially\nraise ourselves so I was recently asked\nactually in a podcast if I thought that\nevery human essentially needed to\nreparent and my answer was an\noverwhelming yes so what are the big\nareas that we want to take a look at\nthat possibly we need to teach ourselves\nsome some skills in so the four big\nareas are discipline so a lot of us were\nnot taught simple habits rituals healthy\nhabits rituals in childhood so those of\nyou who follow me or work with me know\nI'm always talking about have a\ndevelopment in ritual development\npromises to stuff where does that what\ndoes that mean so as now an adult and we\ntry to change things up we try to\ndevelop that healthy you know\nearly-morning week up or meditation\npractice chances are something called I\ncall these mental resistance is going to\ncome up all the thoughts telling us all\nof the reasons why you not to do it it\ncan be really overwhelming to change so\nI developed the concept that I call\npromises to self essentially what that\nmeans is setting one attention one small\npromise each day and making the choice\nto do it despite what your mindset is\nthat is how we cultivate what I think is\ndiscipline so to South care what does\nself care mean really all of these are\ntools aimed at keeping your body in\nphysical balance sleep incredibly\nimportant make sure you're getting\nenough sleep\nit is really healing and that's\nreally for brain functioning and\nemotional wellness nutrition\nnutrient-dense foods really going to\nhelp your body maintain a balanced\nmovement physical activity any kind not\nfive hours at the gym a walk\nsmall things light stretching any way\nthat you're just moving your body our\nbodies are meant to move nature\nconnection with nature I think this is\nincredibly important is really the\nenergy of nature can be so healing sit\nin a park like I said sit on your stoop\nanything that just gets you outside joy\nso this might sound simple a lot of us\nsadly did not have many experiences of\njoy in our childhood I am one of them\nliving in an environment that feels\nchaotic oftentimes as people in\nfight-or-flight mode and joy just is not\npossible when we're in fight-or-flight\nmode also sometimes you know we just\ndidn't see parents that had interests\nthat had hobbies so what is important is\nto develop play in our life to develop\ninterest in hobbies and if you're\nsomeone like myself I did not know what\nmy interests were I had to cultivate\nthat and connect with myself and find\nthe things as my adult self that liked\nwhat I like to do human connection so\nincredibly important you're social\ncreatures we need some level of just\nconnection with humans it releases\nhormones that are incredibly healing for\nthe body emotional regulation so\nessentially what that means is\nmaintaining a baseline where we can\nnavigate the highs and lows of life they\nare always going to be there how do we\ndo that those of you follow me you know\nI go on and on about meditation\nmeditation allows us to develop a new\nrelationship with our thinking minds the\nreality being that are thinking minds\nand our thoughts contribute to a lot of\nour emotional experiences so as we\nmeditate we don't learn how to do\nwe learn how to separate ourself from\nour thoughts and we are going to choose\nwhere we put our attention which then\ntranslates over time into doing those\ntwo things daily that's what conscious\nawareness is being present being\nobservationally of yourself seeing when\nyou're lost in your mind and like I said\nseparating yourself and redirecting your\nattention where you choose and then\nbreathwork those of you again follow me\nnow I go on and on about the tool of\nbreath work it connects our mind to our\nbody in a way that actually allows us to\nregulate our body and physiological\nresponses that come with our emotional\nexperiences so these are the areas that\nwe want to look at as an adult and I\nwant to just acknowledge one last thing\nto end many of the reasons why we were\nnot taught these things in childhood is\nbecause our parents did not give these\nthings to themselves likely of course\nthat was a result of their own parenting\nexperiences with their own parents so\njust want to throw that out there\nbecause I think that's really important\nyou cannot teach things we cannot offer\nthings to others not even our children\nif we don't first offer these things to\nourselves so I hope that was a quick\noverview and you understand what\nrepairing is and so next Friday night\nyou know and you can't go out because\nyou have to do one of these things for\nyourself know that you're not alone and\nI'm right there with you\nso I hope this was helpful thanks guys"
