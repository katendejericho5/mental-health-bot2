    "transcript": "hello everyone dr. Nicola para the\nholistic psychologist here so today I\nhave someone really awesome that I've\nbeen following for a very long time\nKatie Crosby she is a pediatric\noccupational therapist who those of you\nout there listening might be wondering\nwhy the heck I'm talking to a pediatric\noccupational therapist but she's\nactually quite an expert and specializes\nin relationships emotional regulation\nand is really amazing does a lot of\ngreat work her handle and I'm gonna be\nposting this all in the notes because\nI've already suggested many of you have\ncontacted me about all things parenting\nadvice sending them her way\nFriday littles on Instagram YouTube I\nthink you for podcast as well as amazing\nsuch a resource\nquite honestly invaluable in terms of\nall things conscious parenting so today\nwe're gonna have a great conversation\ntalk a little bit about our little ones\nand emotionally regulating ourselves\nhelping them to emotionally regulate\nthemselves incredibly important skills\nand tools and those of you who listen to\nme always hear me talking about\nemotional resilience and this is the\nhow-to so welcome Katie and I thank you\nso much for having a chat with me today\nNicole thank you so much for having me I\nthink there's so many parallels between\nthe work that you do and that's really\nthe foundation that's starting with us\nso I'm so excited to talk about in the\nmoment ideas and all the foundation that\nwe can set for them through the way that\nwe interact and our day to day lives\nyeah absolutely I so agree and anytime\npeople ask me about parenting advice\nthat is always my number one suggestion\nis really as we're healing as the humans\nthat we are and as we are teaching and\nrepairing and kind of being very\nconscious and aware of our emotions and\ndeveloping the tools which quite\nhonestly a lot of us as parents did not\nget in our own childhood that's always\nmy number one advice is to parents is to\nyou know engage in your own self-healing\nprocess and that will 100% go a long way\nin helping helping your little ones but\nI'm having you on because you are such\nyou're always talking about the prac\nall the daily the how-to and I think\nthat this is really going to be helpful\nfor a lot of listeners out there because\nI know that we do want to talk a little\nbit more ok well that's all great that's\nfine and great but what do you mean what\ndo we mean in these moments and I you\nknow is the conscious painter who's\nmaybe navigating my own emotional\nexperience in the given moment or my\nlittle ones and or both and sometimes it\nhappens and we have a lot of big\nemotions that I know get that are part\nof the parenting experience so you're\nvery much about the practical\napplication I'm really excited to hear\nsome of the tips so kind of heading in\ntalk to me a little bit about what you\nmean when you say conscious parenting\nand what may be a general you know kind\nof what is your idea about the role that\na parent plays and emotions yeah so\nfirst disclaimer I'm not a parent so my\nexperience and my work with kids is\nreally based on mileage which with lots\nof kids with different sensitivities or\nvulnerabilities especially that really\nreally need this attuned support from us\nin order to develop their own\nself-regulation and when I think about\nconscious parenting I think about it's\nit's all about observing and being aware\nin the moment with kids and with\nourselves and I think Dan Siegel has a\ngreat book mine site and there's so many\ntools that you have out there for just\nthe awareness that comes from being\nconscious in the moment and for kids\nit's helping them to develop that\nconsciousness capacity which we also\nnearly self-regulation so when I think\nabout regulation to take a step back I\nwould say it is the ability to take in\ninformation from the environment or\nothers and then monitor or modify our\ninteraction or our response in the\nmoment\nso thinking about this process as a\ndevelopmental process it really sets the\nstage for kids learning and interaction\nwith the world and regulation is the\nbasis of everything so when I think\nabout consciousness isn't regulation how\nthose things fit together I think if you\ndon't have a child that's regulated\nwe're an adult\nregulated and it fluctuates all\nthroughout the day and moment-to-moment\nworth we're always shifting up and down\nthroughout the day but if we don't have\na baseline idea of what we need in the\nmoment to be calm and organized and\navailable then we tend to miss a lot and\nstay in our heads in this you know it's\nalmost like the narrative that we use as\nadults it's like the spine going there\nitself that we have if kids are not able\nto regulate then they're acting on\nimpulses their reactive they're showing\nbehaviors that you know society views as\nnegative and leads\nwe don't want essentially or they're\nreally getting in the way of interacting\nin the world in a way that feels\nfulfilling for them so the big broad\nanswer of what I think is conscious\nparenting and emotional regulation\nabsolutely I actually love that answer\nand it touches a lot of the concepts\nthat I'm always talking about and I love\nwhat you said there there's there's a\ngem in the middle I mean there was many\nof them but when I heard because I get a\nquestion a lot acknowledging right that\nlife is there can be things that happen\nbut this way to given day that we feel\nabout them I really simplified we feel\nhigh whatever then we feel low we feel\nsome version of not good and not\npositive right negative if you will and\nthat's life and I love that you pointed\nout that that is true because a lot of\nthe life that we're reacting to is I\nwill always talk to my clients about the\nrange that exists that is not within our\ncontrol and I always share the brutal\ntruth I think for many of us that a lot\nmore falls outside that line of our\ncontrol than we I think are comfortable\nwith acknowledging meaning life happens\nand speak to your point we could have\ndifferent emotions and they could feel\nvery much up and down but what is\nimportant is finding that baseline of\nstability that's not to say because when\nwhen I referenced earlier I get a lot of\nquestions some people will say to me\nbecause I'm always talking up being an\nobserver and usually you'll hear me say\nwords like being a neutral observer just\nseeing the world right as objectively as\npossible for how it is so in response to\nthat I get questions\nlike well am I not gonna have feelings\nthen about the world how will I know if\nsomeone's taking advantage of me to put\nyou know a boundary up does this mean\nthat I'm just a passive recipient to all\nthat which is and so I love the way you\neven explained that in your definition\nbecause no that is not the byproduct of\nhaving that stable base that you must\nbeautifully describe having it's just\nthat we get in way my language or I\nlanguages I get choice and how I respond\nthe world still happening I can still\nfind out in it more I can make a choice\nif someone has crossed a limit of my in\nor if something does not feel good and I\nneed to use that to guide a future\nchoice but I get choice to use even\nlanguage use not to have that reactive\nexistence of now I'm writing the\nemotional rollercoaster that is the\nworld outside of us that was such a good\npoint with I think I hear the same thing\nwith parents and kids because emotional\nregulation isn't just being this like\nnot an emotional being that's constantly\nregulated and it's all about accepting\nall the emotions as they come and\nfeeling it as an acknowledged Ginga is\nenergy that needs to you know come up\nand be felt in some way and experienced\nand then metabolized in some way so yes\nif we are constantly telling kids and\nthere's time different there's so many\ndifferent styles out there there's no\nright or wrong but as an OT I'm thinking\nabout what is the most effective or\nhelpful way to help child develop\nself-regulation so the way that I look\nat parenting strategies or techniques is\nall about how do we get this energy out\nof the body in a in an adaptive way\nversus shutting it down or internal\nizing it and pretending it isn't there\nwe're telling a child not to get angry\nor not to get upset or don't cry or stop\ndoing that and there's so many tapes\nthat we all heard as kids that show up\nwhen our child especially is is crying\nor is hitting because we have those\nbiological triggers that were never\nreally metabolized so it's like our\ninner child as you you know\nlanguage is still you know figuring out\nhow to metabolize that emotion and feel\nthe sensation and make sense of it so\nit's really a cool opportunity and I\nthink there's this whole wave of\neverybody interested in this and the\nresearch lately is is really on par with\nhow do we help kids to understand and\nmake meaning of their individual signals\nand cues of their body and their mind\nand their emotions in a way that it's\ncommunicating and it's we can see as\neither communication or healing that\nneeds to come out in some way so I think\nthe first step that I talked to parents\nabout is guess the zero zero step so the\nbase it's always understanding those in\nourselves and recognizing in the moment\nand then the next step is to really be\nan expert on each individual child so\nthere's so much information out there\nabout ways to parent and ways to be with\nkids but I think as an OT what it really\ncomes down to is looking at that\nindividual child because it looks so\ndifferent and emotions are indefinable\nfor you know important to put a blanket\nstatement on because they're so\nindividual in the way that we experience\nthe way that we feel them and each in\neach nervous system is as unique as a\nfingerprint so we really need to be the\nones that are investigating and\nexploring and being a detective if you\nwill about each child so we can make\nsense of what they're doing in the\nmoment or what their actions or\nbehaviors are yeah absolutely and I love\nyou know I always since I started to to\nreach or kitty you talking and\nacknowledging the reality that similarly\nto the way I define emotions as energy I\nalso think being so kind of aware as you\nare of the effect on our nervous system\nhas always been you know I've always\nfound that so important as part of doing\nthis work and quite honestly overlooked\nyou know if this isn't being talked\nabout in terms of that because the\neffect that our emotions have on our\nnervous system with this regulation of\nand nervous system and the difficulty in\nin self-soothing or in teaching the\nchildren to soothe themselves when we're\nin that dysregulated emotional or\nnervous system state it we we could spin\nourselves crazy because without\naddressing that I think cordis\nregulation we are we are doing ourselves\nwe are setting ourselves up not to be\nsuccessful and I also love how you're\ntalking to to conversations here right\none of which is the parent again\nacknowledging that some of the times in\nthose moments with even our children we\nare we are functioning in that energy\nfrom that inner child and so meaning we\nare not from the conscious adult State\nwho is making or has available to us the\nchoice is quite often similarly to the\nway I talk in terms of partners and more\nwith our partners right when we're both\nin a reactive state that applies to\nchildren as well so I love that you're\nhighlighting hey parents out there Lea\nknow that in some moments you two are\npossibly entered into it dysregulated\nmore childlike state in your own psyche\nif you will that similar is your child\nis in in those moments I think that's\npart of the reality but I love what\nyou're saying in terms of the second\nstep is knowing the individuality of\nyour of your children so can you give\nsome I guess kind of practical like how\nhow can we start to do that how do we\nknow if our child is having a feeling\nobviously if we're out of our own child\nin our child mode and we're showing up\nthis to consciousness all how can we\nbegin to understand what is happening\nfor especially our little guys don't\nhave the language to tell us yeah yeah\nso there's a lot of different ways that\nthe dysregulation can present and I\nthink you bring us a good point because\nit's always these times of heightened\nstress when the behaviors that we don't\nwant if you will are coming out for both\nof us or all of us so so when I'm\nlooking at little kids early childhood\nand this can go off with a life span\nbecause again if you don't learn to\nregulate our own and adaptive ways it\nshows up all throughout life so ways\nthat little kids may communicate that\nthey're having a hard time or they\nto guide them maybe kind of action urges\nor behaviors that show up they stun\nthese emotions so things like hitting or\nbiting or kicking or not wanting to play\nwith other kids so not wanting to move\nin and experience joy with other people\nor other individuals or kind of be more\npassive in the environment so maybe\nthey're in a room with toys and they're\nnot sure where to start where they're\nfeeling unsure about exploring that's a\nbig sign of something going on and some\ndysregulation they're one that i see all\nthe time is silliness so you know it's\ntime to leave the clinic and the parent\nis stressed\nready to get somewhere everybody needs\nto get out the door and this is in the\nmorning too I think you're ready to get\nout the door there's a lot of things\nmornings can be big times for you know\nboom boom boom ABC let's do this let's\nget on with the day and then suddenly\nthe child's running around silly\nlaughing or giggling and nothing's\nreally funny so it's like there's not a\nmatch in the emotion that's being shown\nand what the situation is so that's a\nbig sign of dysregulation anytime we see\nthat mismatch and okay here's what's\nhappening right now and here's what the\nchild's doing so that's indicating to me\nthat they may be having trouble\nidentifying their emotion and showing us\nwhat they want or what they need in a\nway that makes sense to us other ways\nthat dysregulation may show up maybe\nthings like them saying hurtful things\nto parents so some some kids may say\nthings like I you know I hate you you're\nI never want to be with you or things\nthat they you know of course probably\ndon't mean but in the moment they're\nusing whatever tools they have available\nto communicate that they really don't\nfeel good in the moment and they're\nneeding our help in some way so so\nthere's a lot of ways that we can look\nat the dysregulation how it presents and\nthen questioning you know how do we not\nmeaning to those behaviors in the moment\nbecause if we give it a meaning like\nthey hate me I'm a terrible parent they\ndon't love me oh no and then our shame\nor our guilt is triggered but what it\nreally means is that the child's having\na hard time and they're communicating\nthat to us and it's an opportunity to\nhelp and shake this into something that\ncan be more adaptive so so in the\nbeginning when they're learning the\nemotional release it comes out first as\nphysical embodied experience so if\nthey're angry they hit so it's more\nimpulsive it's more reactive and it's\nthe stage of development that is\ncreating that so until they get more\nnuanced and have more opportunities Co\nregulating we say we're calming and\norganizing with the trusted adult then\nthese behaviors will show up because\nit's really developed developmentally\nage-appropriate at the time as well\nbecause I think that they might they\nmight kind of really trigger a lot of\npeople and parents out there thinking\nbecause another again from my\nperspective another messaging that can\nbecome problematic one obviously is\npersonalization airing so as a parent I\nsee my child and I own that means\nsomething about me as parent they hate\nme they don't listen to me it's about me\nanother I think you know narrative that\nis equally as problematic that I then\nend up working with the adult who has\ninternalized as narrative around has\nbeen when and the parent you know\nunknowingly\nobviously of course says something along\nthe lines of it needs something of the\nchild so in terms of being uncooperative\nor why can't you help mom your help and\nI you know not helping mom get out the\ndoor so now again inadvertently out\nmight slip some narrative that's\nobviously negative that the again then\nreally simplify that the child is bad or\nthat this is something about the child\nintrinsically and not understanding that\nI think as you beautifully put it it's\ncoming from that dysregulated emotional\nstate so I think that's another again\ndamaging narrative that fast forward in\ntime no matter how long it is adults\ncould still\nwe'll be operating around some level of\nbelief that particularly around their\nemotional experience again originating\nat a time where they didn't have the\nlanguage for it and it was just a\nmisalignment in parent and child the\nchild male who is the adult becomes they\nthey feel badly about their own mega\ntheir own emotional experience and this\ncould globalize so I've had even clients\nwho say you know I I was told I was an\noverly sensitive child I was too much\nand now they become the adult that I\nthink struggles to own their own\nemotional world again because of just\nthese statements said in these times\nwhen it was coming from an inaccurate\nperception on the parents part where the\nparent did on some level not have the\nunderstanding that you are now imparting\nyou know in an invaluable way so if\nparents listening if you do see your\nchildren engaging any of those behaviors\ncould be really helpful just stop for a\nmoment and instead to step back and\nmaybe try to understand it through now\nthis new plans that was happening for\nyour child is a dysregulated emotion and\nnot an attempt to not to operate or not\nwhatever it was that your own narrative\nmight have been telling you yes and I\nthink all the boundaries work is so\nimportant with this not managing one not\nmanaging their emotions or feeling that\nwe are responsible to keep them happy\nall of the time so I see that a lot\nwhere parents or caregivers think that\nif their child's happy that's a\nreflection of their success or their\nskills as a parent or caregiver and if\nit can be tucked to separate from that\nwhen we grew up thinking that no mom or\ndad is mad so they must be you know I\ndid something wrong what's my fault for\nall those thoughts that show up so so\nyes in a moment we see that all the time\nwith how do you separate and realize\nthat their emotions really don't have to\ndo with with us as much as we think they\ndo so it's a really important thing to\nthink about absolutely another really\ngood point there too because you know\ncoming myself from a very Amishman\nespecially emotionally codependent\nfamily that was definitely messaging\nthat I was given and you know out there\nwe get two versions of message messaging\nsometimes a very direct message you get\nthis in mommy you know you made mommy or\nyou made daddy mad sad whatever it is\nclad even right messaging directly you\nknow you did this back action on your\npart results in this feeling on someone\nelse's part I think that's an implicit\nmessage that you are responsible for\nsomeone else's emotions and I think it\nalso happened much more indirectly we're\njust you know the emotional climate of\nthe whole family unit is impacted by one\nindividual meaning when one person is\nupset the whole family unit that kind of\nbleeds into that upset space as well\nregardless again you do I think evolved\ninto the adulthood struggles and those\nsimilar ways feeling responsible\nengaging possibly and helper or\ncaretaking or a million in different\nother functions or behaviors and\nrelationships in fact some of them\nFriday I guess aimed at just managing\nsomeone else's emotional experience and\nI also want to acknowledge not having\nchildren myself either\nI can't imagine what it would be like to\nwatch your child or experience your\nchild in their sadness grief anger I'm\nsure it's quite difficult and a lot of\ntimes natural I would imagine for the\nparent to want to swoop in and and try\nto make it better I think from from that\nangle to but I think to speak to your\npoint that also can be doing the child a\ndisservice not allowing themselves to\ndevelop their own emotional regulation\nso with that said once if you do start\nto see these dysregulated moments in\nyour little ones what what do we do how\ndo we deal with the big feelings that\nare happening in that moment our child\nto deal with the big feelings that are\nhappening mmm-hmm so the first kind of\nfoundation to all this and then I didn't\nspeak to as much in the first point was\nthat getting to know the child signals\nand cues first means also knowing what\nreally brings them joy and pleasure and\nfun and first helping them feel safe\nseeing soothe and secure which is Dan\nSiegel turns four\nall those things as contributing to\nlevel of calm and organization so we\nreally want to know the child in both\ntheir dysregulated states or their\ndisorganization but really spend the\nbulk of our time is spent helping them\nfeel seen or heard and whatever that\nmeans to that individual child so\nfocusing on what brings them fun or joy\nand daily routine means and integrating\nthat into their day and knowing what\nlights them up and I think a lot of us\nare still figuring that out if there\nisn't again this adult there to guide oh\nyou're really into that you should go do\nthat you know like that's not it's more\nabout what society wants and what the\nexpectations of everybody around us are\nso we can help kids from a young age\nunderstand that yeah they are totally\nunique and their wants and needs and\ninterests are totally unique and how do\nwe nurture that and grow that as a build\nthat's where we get vitality and the\nzest for life that we want and that\nreally sets us up for it to ride that\nroller coaster a little bit you know and\nhave more fun I love the point that\nyou're making about you know where is\nthe limit between I accept that is just\nyou as individual child aside from what\neveryone else in the world and a lot of\nI say that because I think a lot of us\nare overly concerned men have maybe even\nourselves raised as now a parent you\nknow from a caregiver who was overly\nconcerned about what that meant if okay\nif the world and this has seized my\nchild liking this thing you know might\nthat reflect negatively on me and I\nthink that's a reality and I also want\nto touch on because I think we're we're\nhaving two separate conversations which\nis really interesting right how do I\nmeet always here throw out the chai\nalright but what is also happening in\nthe adult because I also believe that a\ndifficulty and again I'm likely speaking\npredominantly from my own experience\nbecause I raise a child right yeah all\ncan't get help it but growing up in a\nfamily that was constant fire flight\nmood had very few moments of co-sharing\njoy with a caregiver to my detriment so\nit became and I say this because again I\nthink a lot but something else is just\nsitter in the climate is the warfighter\nflying and I say this again because I\nthink a lot of humans adult humans are\nspending incredible disproportionate\namount of times in that fight-or-flight\nstate so really gaining control of your\nown nervous system responses so that you\ncan inhabit that enjoy space with the\nchild because again I use my example my\nparents as my caregivers were unable to\nfind joy of on their own they did not\nhave interest in hobbies and pleasures\nand joyful moments as sad as that is in\ntheir own personal world so when it came\nto Co sharing that with me it was just\nsomething they were not able to give\nthemselves so how would they then be\nable to meet me in a joyful moment they\nweren't so again I just want to leave\nthat ynx I think that's another part of\nthis story when we talk about being the\nconscious adult as well is making sure\nthat you're healing your own nervous\nsystem response and assume that you can\nyou know kind of share those moments\nwith your children and I think that\nthere to speak to your point incredibly\ninvaluable and a lot of us do end up\nbecoming the adult who you know how many\ntimes I hear I don't know myself I don't\nknow what I want I don't know what my\ninterests are and that's okay we can\nreconnect with ourselves and rebuild our\nown connections to interest and joy but\nI think you know kind of finding those\nmoments with our children's gonna set\nthem on a path always be connected to\nthemselves and their positive\nexperiences of the world and yeah\nsoluable way mm-hmm and it's so true\nthat if the emotion isn't seen or felt\ndeeply by another person in early\nchildhood and it really can come off as\ninvalidating and the child creates a\nstory that they're not good enough or\nit's their fault again so there is a lot\nof layers that we have from early\nchildhood that if things aren't going\nwell and our shame is triggered then\nthat really keeps us and prevents us\nfrom being in the moment with the child\nunless we're able to step back and\nobserve it and question it other than\njust repeating this shame tape over and\nover again that really keeps us from\nbeing on the floor in the moment\nspontaneous silly and all that good\nstuff so yeah\nmuch easier it says and done and there's\nso much work that can go into just being\navailable in the moment especially if\nthat wasn't the case for us growing up\nso yes huge disclaimer thank you for\nthat before we dive into these in the\nmoment things there's so much that goes\ninto this I think it's mostly outside\nthe moment stuff that goes into this in\nthe moment big feelings so no I could\nnot agree more actually well that\nstatement because I am always talking\nwhere it's like consistency and habit\nand change in that more global scale\nbecause unfortunately as much I think as\na lot of us humans like to have those as\nneeded you know kind of PRN you know\ndeploy in the moment you know toolkit\nbut the reality of it is I'm happy\nyou're making that point is beyond is\nliving and you know consistently\npracticing and healing more often than\nnot more consistently than not so that\nin the moment then we can show up as\nthat fully president present I don't\nwhether it's in their joy or you think\nshifting into it when they're not in\nsuch a joyful state as well so how can\nyou even touched on the joys I think so\nmany of us are focusing a week when we\nhave these conversations our mind\npredominantly goes to okay ones when\nit's not working when they're kicking\nwhen they're screaming when they're\nthey're not in a good emotional place\nwhat then but I love beautifully because\nthere's the positive - and that's just\nas important so I'm really really happy\nactually that you started mm-hmm yes and\nevery time you have you have that really\nread its reciprocal back and forth\ninteraction it's almost like we're\nstrengthening this attention and\nregulation myself where they're getting\nthese reps of interaction feels good\nthere's the pleasurable hormones that\nare being released through the body and\nit's setting this really nice glue for\nthem putting a lot of things together\nthat they can recruit when things are\ntough and I think yes why play is so\nimportant because it really allows them\na safe place to play out some of these\ntough emotions and experiences and\nrealize that their caregivers are on\ntheir side so so after that the first\nthing that I would do in the moment is\nalways\nobserve so observe and think okay who do\nI need to regulate first myself or them\nso and I think this is where some people\nstart to realize that they maybe have\nunresolved trauma that showed up and\ndevelopmental trauma is I think so\nprevalent and I loved your post on\ntrauma and how it can show up in so many\ndifferent ways because for many of us\nand I think this is a big part of\nobserve so I'll mention it briefly but\ndevelopmental trauma can happen anytime\na child is upset and their nervous\nsystem is telling them to go to their\ncaregiver go to safety peac safety to\nsue that's a biological instinct and\nthen the parent though if they are the\nones that are the threat to the child in\nthe moment so if the parent is the one\nthat's yelling a little bit louder than\nthey maybe would like to and it's coming\nacross to the child is scary and the\njobs nervous system is saying run away\nget away from the threat so if the\nthreat and the safety source are the\nsame then it creates this rift in the\nbody and the mind and emotions that can\nbe like little little traumatic moments\nespecially if they're not repaired so\nfor a lot of us repair wasn't a big\nthing so you know people get mad people\nthat angry and then there's no repair so\nthe child creates the story\nsubconsciously that again it's their\nfault and they're bad so it's like these\nlittle Ostrom attic experiences that's\nin the moment when when everybody is\nupset as the caregiver that might be\nshowing up for us so how do you step\nback and observe that and then recreate\na tape around it or just observe and\nthink okay there it is I'm thinking it's\nmy fault is it my fault probably not no\nso so that's the first step is observed\nif we need to regulate ourselves first\nor and then we can move to them so\nthat's really the first step is just\nbeing in a moment and trying not to\nleave them unless you know there's\nsomething that is triggering you that\nyou really do need space so there's\nthreat and you feel anger coming up and\nyou do need to separate from the child\nand\nto be safe if that's that's very true so\nlike rate which I think you know even\nI've had rage in my personal\nrelationships that showed up as kind of\nunresolved trauma that I didn't know\nthat I really had to work through and\nthere's so much shame that comes with\nthat because it's like all of a sudden\nyou snap and it's emotional flashback\nand in a moment you you're not thinking\nclearly so you're not able to think like\nOh take take a breath and and have space\nit's more like okay how do you do\nsomething and move yourself away so\nyou're not hurting something or hurting\nsomebody and I think this is something\nthat people don't talk about that\nespecially as parents when you're\nbiologically triggered in the moment it\nhappens and people talk about it more\nand more and it's so powerful because\nonce we get it out there we can shift it\nbut if it's stuck inside you're feeling\nshame and guilt over it it's just it'll\neat us up so that's I think a really\nimportant part of this step one is if\nthere's something you know deeper going\non we need to get there yeah I think\nthat's incredibly important part two\nbecause I just love how you normalize\nthat and I don't think people are\ntalking about it enough and they think\nthat there is so much change it's over\npossibly a belief you know that I\nshouldn't feel this way about my child\nwell again if understanding right which\nis why I talk about the inner child and\nthe wounds and all of that which you\ncarry from our own past experiences\nthat's why I think the awareness is\nalways an important first step of change\nbecause now I can understand that what's\nhappening I'm not actually it's not\nactually right about my child really at\nall in the moment the child it for lack\nof a better words it's just acting as\nthe catalyst right for this deeper\nemotional pain that I'm feeling but I\nthink it's it's it's unfortunate that a\nlot of times and if we do react in a way\nthat's less than favorable not that I\nwon't ever condoning right anything that\ncould escalate in terms of a\nparent-child relationship but we then\nleave that and we feel so probably in\nMorden like devastated Lee shameful and\nwe take it to mean something about us\nwho could never cross a line like that\nwith a child and again I just think we\nhave to understand that we do lose a\nsense of control we are straight back in\nthat emotional brain and it's\ndetective mechanisms which are again\nreally simple I simplify it right I\neither check out so I can either\ncompletely abandon my child and not be\npresent in any way shape or know if I'm\nreally acutely triggered that is what my\nmom would do with me especially\ndissociate right so for me the messaging\nI got that conflict in a relationship\ntalk about repair was was not repairable\nmy mom actually I let my mom I lost my\nmom my caregiver when she was angry and\nthat's a dozen devastating message to\ninternalized as a child or obviously we\ndo the other kind of more extreme it's\nactually the outward behaviors we kicked\nme now and then we're the parents doing\nthat but again I think that we could\ncarry so much shame and we have to\nunderstand it we do at a point lose that\nback control so we do have to take a\nstep and I always say time sometimes is\nour best friend in those moments where I\njust distance myself put some physical\nspace between me and the triggering\nevent if you will child include it so\ndown-regulate enough and then be able to\ncome back online and make a new choice\ntrying to navigate that in the moment\nwith some of these really deep emotions\nare that alive for us we're in a losing\nbattle in us mm-hmm yes I think when\nwhen them techniques it's been helpful\nis in the moment to repeat the emotion\nthat you're feeling or if you can label\nwhat you're feeling so just say anger\nanger anger or fear fear fear I'm Tara\nbrach who is one of my favorites\nshe has podcasts and she's a great\nresource for this kind of stuff and then\nto you if you can get to some compassion\nand I care about this pain I care about\nthis anger I care about this sadness so\nagain it's more cognitive so you'd need\nto be a level of calm in order to access\nthat if you can even start doing that in\nlittle moments outside in daily life\nthat's a really helpful one that I think\nis the same idea of what we want for\nkids would just help them label it so so\nthen the next step would be to really\nfocus on emotional cues in the moment so\nlike you said it's this emotional more\nprimitive brain that's activated under\nstress so if the child is in stress they\nneed us to avoid any logic or teaching\nso as adults our tendency is to go to\nlogic or teaching or you know if the\nchild is at the store and wants a toy\nand they start crying because they're so\nupset that they don't have the toy so\nparent might think Johnny you have a\nmillion toys at home you have so many\ntoys at home you can play with why do\nyou want you know this doesn't make\nsense why are you crying\nso unknowingly and unintentionally we're\ninvalidating the child's experience and\nthey are really feeling like neural\nneurologically this is real for them in\nthe moment so they are thinking of this\ntoy this is their whole world right now\nwhich is kind of this beautiful centrism\negocentric mode of early childhood that\ncomes in like their whole world is into\nthe moment and their whole world is that\ntoy so if we say no it's like we're\nrocking their world or shattering their\nvisual in their mind and they're not\nable to adapt and think about those toys\nat home so if we invalidate or we say\nthat no don't cry no stop this doesn't\nmake sense like you're fine and you have\nso many toys at home then that's setting\nup the child for confusion in making\nmeaning of that sensation in their body\nwhich is emotion so whether whether we\nknow it or not we're invalidating so if\nwe can connect from the emotional level\ninstead of the logical level that's\nreally where we need to start to how do\nwe connect at the emotional level versus\ntriggering them further so typically\nwhen we say that child feels not seen\nand not heard and it triggers and\nheightens their stress response in the\nmoment versus helping to down-regulate\nit back to where they might be able to\nvisualize or problem-solve another\noption I love that actually took a\nminute while you're chatting and I wrote\ndown making meaning out of the sensation\nI just love that as kind of a practical\nwhat what are you doing what is\nhappening what is the goal of a parent\nin that moment and I love that making\nmeaning out of the emotional sensation\nthat they're having in their bodies and\ngiving them words to understand it\nexplore it maybe give words to it\nultimately over time depending on how\nold is I just think that's actually a\nbeautiful way to describe the after the\nfunction or the what's actually\nhappening there in a way that can be\nmuch more expansive and exploratory as\nopposed to the like you're saying the\nlogical attempt in that moment and I\nthink if we're all honest as adults\nright we can be remember the time maybe\nit was more recently than not for some\nof us right where we were in an\nemotional state and maybe it was our\npartner or some loved one that in a very\nwell-intentioned you know attempt at\ntalking us down off the ledge or you\nknow making it okay for us maybe did\nsimilarly try a more logic based\napproach right where it's pointed out to\nme all of the logical reasons why what\nI'm feeling is is really not that big of\na deal and it's okay in the moment you\nknow I think most of us can remember\nback to when that moment happened for us\nand say okay\nthat did feel a little bit invalid that\ndidn't feel good I'm not looking for\nsome of the logically solve the promises\nlanguage I of these I'm not looking to\nbe have a problem solve I'm just looking\nfor someone to just allow myself and my\nfeelings to be and I think as an\nextension maybe to be seen and\nunderstood and like you were saying\nearlier I think the the drives that we\nall have as humans that Dan Siegel talks\nabout right to be just known our\nemotional worlds included by another and\nand that is how we feel I believe more\nknown as opposed to just being having\nthe problem solved for us I don't\nactually think that's what any of us\nreally want in those moments at all and\ngetting that can be really invalidating\ntotally yeah and it takes a level of\ncomfort with their emotions in order to\ngo there and I think it's like we're all\nkind of uncomfortable with emotion our\nsociety is like you know be this way\ndon't be that way you can be sad but not\ntoo much you're not too long and then\nyou're you know not okay so there's so\nmuch judgement and and yeah I think the\nfact of the matter with kids is that in\nthe moment they're not they're not able\nto go logical at all so\nif we are trying to use words and\nliterally say things so sometimes when I\nsay name it to tame it or you know focus\non connection then the adult is using\nwords Oh Johnny you look sad hmm you\nknow or you you're mad right now that me\nyou know you're mad right now but it's\nthey're saying it in a way that isn't\nemotional so when I say emotional and\nconnecting with that side or that's part\nof the brain we're focusing on our body\nand our tone of voice our volume of\nvoice face that we have between words\nless language so yes words are rarely\nsoothing when they're used alone so we\ncan say things but our body might be\nsaying a complete other so we'll have a\ncaregiver that's saying something but\ntheir their presence is saying stop this\nwe need to go somewhere like this is I'm\nfrustrated but their words are saying\nsomething different so if we can I say\nless language even just no talking at\nall so that's kind of the next step even\njust no talking just stop talking in the\nmoment and get down at their level so\nthink about body positioning and how we\ncan support a sense of safety so if\nyou're a big person standing over this\nlittle child it's a sense of threat\nwhether we're intending it to be or not\nso getting down at their eye level or\nbelow kneeling even laying down on the\nfloor and not talking so you are like\nthis safe being that is there to help\nthem energetically make sense of this\nand focusing on you know maybe eye\ncontact but for some kids eye contact is\ntoo much or it can be triggering in the\nmoment so again going back to reading\ntheir signals and their cues and what\nworks for them in the moment for\nco-regulation because it's so different\nfor every child so if we don't know what\nworks for the child it can be tough to\nmove on and through this process and\nconnect at the emotional level that they\nmay need absolutely I love those very\npractical suggestions too because these\nare likely things that might not even\ncross the adults mind in them\nright you're used to just coming down or\nat or you know talking at the regular\nrhythm of voice I think some of those\nslight shifts to the delivery of the\nmessage and the nonverbals of it speaks\nat two points you know I think that\nwe're consistently making which is know\nyourself and know you know if you are in\nthat more dysregulated\nend of the spectrum where you cannot you\nknow make that alignment between words\nand actions because as I will always say\na million times over it may be just my\nbelief but however you think we get to\nthis plan and I believe we are so\nattuned individuals so little children\nso they're gonna know and they're gonna\npick up possibly even more strongly on\nthe nonverbal aspect of your\ncommunication so even if you're gritting\nyour teeth and trying so hard to say the\nright things and I throw this out there\nas well because I think again very\nwell-intentioned parents want to have a\ntoolkit of the right things to say but\nyou're really highlighting again that\ninternal part of the work to really\nmaking sure that you can make put those\ninto alignment within the practical\ntools of what is safe body communication\nor what are safer feeling for for most\nchildren but again acknowledging that\neven within that there's individual\nvariance so you could actually end up\nhaving a child assumably that the\nchild's preference in terms of what\nhappens when emotionally activated might\nbe much different than what you find as\nhelpful or soothing and I say that\nbecause I think it's really natural that\nwe assume of most others similarity\nright so if this makes me feel calm I\nassume this makes everyone also come and\nagain without having actual children\nmyself I can only imagine that is\nextended if not amplified when it's your\nchild why would they not you know gain\nsoothing in this type of behavior if\nthat's what you do and something I\nlearned very early on clinically was not\nto make those assumptions about anyone\neven if you're speaking the same\nlanguage and we're both saying yeah\nwe're anxious that doesn't mean that our\nanxieties mean the same thing to both of\nus so really like you're offering\nexplore understand the child and\nquestion whether or not you're\nprojecting okay this is what works for\nme so I'm assuming this works for Johnny\nthat might not be actually what works\nfor John you actually see how Johnny\nacts and see if it's soothing as well\nfor Johnny and then gray and if it's\nno I find the things that Johnny finds\nhis face mm-hmm that's such a good point\nbecause this isn't a linear process in\nstep one observe step to meet them\nemotionally step 3\nvalidate or normalized its we're\nconstantly going back to the observe so\nif you go in and connect emotionally and\nyou're observing and thinking okay\ndid that seem to just anything is can I\ncreate space here and wait for watch and\nobserve if it's helpful for them because\nyes it's such a good point that it is so\ndifferent for everybody and and it's\nmore about the how of what we're doing\ninstead about the what so we can share\nthese details but it really is the art\nof you know there's such an art and\nscience in this it's it's a fact\nregulation science and what works for\nthe child but it's also this part and\nthis nuanced way of adapting so if\nsomething's not working and we adapt and\nwe go back and in this process and serve\nand learn how to connect to the child\nversus them feeling separate and\nisolated and triggering that fear\nresponse again so so that's a huge part\nis our constantly going back to observe\nand step one when I say so step three\nthen is where I get to the validate\nacknowledge and normalize so once we\nnotice that the child is calm enough to\nnot need sensory strategies to soothe\nthat's another disclaimer so Bruce Perry\nhas a triangle online if anybody's\ninterested in googling it's called the\nlearning triangle he's a trauma\nresearcher and but it really goes to\nbuild safety and all kids and it's a\npowerful triangle where the bottom is\nregulate so as an OT when I think about\nregulates we're thinking about sensory\nstrategies to soothe so if the child is\nso upset that they can't process\nlanguage it's really triggered and they\nneed us to go back to more infantile\nways of soothing so that's where we\nthink rocking holding\nusing sounds or running water I think is\nsomething that I see to be calming for\nsome infants or little kids so we're\ngoing back to these sensory strategies\nto soothe the body that's an emotional\nbody level and then when a child is\nready to go to the next stage which is\nrelate sew up the triangle those\nregulate relate reasons relate that's\nwhere we would bring in some of the\nother co-regulation\ntechniques across space so you think\nabout instead of the child being on our\nbody or really connected physically then\nwe're moving across space a little bit\nand giving this chance for them to take\non some of the regulation on their own\nwith us directly there so that's where\nthese techniques like eye contact or\nphysical presence where we're just on\nthe floor next to them without holding\nthem so we're stretching out energy and\ntheir capacity to regulate a little bit\nso instead of rocking you know we might\njust be rhythmically matching their body\nin the moment across at arm's length or\nacross the room if that's what it seems\nlike they need so moving on to those\nco-regulation strategies and then the\ntop is reason or actually I'll go back\nto really a little bit so the validating\ncould come in there where you might just\nbe saying I know I know or trying to\nshow that we're with them we see what\nthey're experiencing and we're matching\nit or we're honoring it in a way that\nhelps them feel heard and helps them\nmakes make sense of again make sense of\nthat sensation or the emotion in the\nbody so you might say it's going back to\nthe toys example that's really looks so\ncool that toy although we had little has\nthose buttons you could press on it that\nwas like so cool so again more a fact\nyou bring in more effect because that\nclicks the emotional brain in so oh my\ngosh it had that blue color and you love\nblue you know it's really blue it's\nreally shiny it looked I bet it looked\nreally cool in the Sun and that's when\nthey're like oh you get me you get that\nthat toy was really cool\nto me and yeah that would be cool to\nplay with that out in the Sun so no\nmatter what it is you're really and it's\ncute has to be kind of truly empathetic\nand truly authentically understanding of\nit so if you say it's just like you said\nif it seems in often seems like you're\njust going through the motions to get\nthem on their way it takes a lot of the\npower out of that moment so you really\nhave to you know think dig deep what is\ncool about that toy yeah it's not really\nyou know you're digging deep and and\nhelping the child in the moments you\nreally almost like you're it's\ncounterintuitive because you're pushing\ninto the emotion you're pushing into wow\nthat is so sad that you can't bring that\nhome right now you know like that's\nthat's staying success so how do we\nvalidate deeply validate that and\nacknowledge and normalize why they're\nfeeling that way make sense that you're\nso bummed about that like you've never\nseen the toy like that before and we\nhave nothing like that at home like oh I\nlove that I love those examples too\nkidding I love to a minimum if we don't\nin that movement as the parent right\nmaybe have access to speak to the\nempathy or two maybe legitimately you\ndon't understand\nright where the feelings are coming from\nyou know from the child even just a\nminute could seem like a minimal I know\nI love that you offered that it's just a\ngeneral good response or better response\nin that moment obviously if you can\nfully join the child and see from the\nchild's eye but they ever imagining it\nso great but I think even just as simple\nI know and allowing that space to be\nheld even if you don't really truly\nunderstand which brings to me then I'm\nwondering you know if there's also a\nscenario where you ask if you do\nobviously have the emotional bandwidth\nand you are in that more regulated state\nas the apparent might that also be a\ntime to maybe you know inquire about the\nchopper from the child or at a later\ntime help have the child help you to\nunderstand what was so upsetting I don't\nknow if the child had access to that in\nthat mm-hmm acutely you know emotional\nmoment but I'm wondering could that also\nbe a moment of just exchange where you\nasked\nesque of your child what was you know\nupsetting or problematic or hmm\nI think yes if you can observe so really\nclosely observing if the child is still\nin their emotional state so the more\nreactive impulsive wanting to grab the\ntoy if we ask what they're feeling in\nthat moment it will likely trigger\nstress because they're unable to access\nthe cognitive tools that require\nlanguage formulation in the moment so\nthen their nervous system is saying\nthere's this demand on me that I can't\nmake meaning of because I'm in the\nstress response mode so then it can\nfurther trigger it so when we see that\nthe child is clicking into us and tuning\nin in a way that they're looking at us\nthey're feeling like they know we see\nthem they're feeling her word that's and\nI might say I wonder what you're what\nyou're feeling right now\nor I wonder what that under of what you\nyou know what you're thinking or just\ncreating some space for them to label it\nand to feel it because again I yeah is\ntough because yes we want to label it\nbut we don't want to assume what they're\nfeeling so maybe they're mad and we're\ncalling it sad and that's conflicting so\nand vice-versa so I think anytime we can\ncreate space in this process for them to\nvolitionally or intentionally share what\nthey're feeling is positive however\ndoing it at a way at a time that makes\nsense for that child and if you notice\nand of course nobody's perfect and we\nreally just need to be good enough\nthroughout this process so recognizing\nthat we will mess up and we will label\nand say the wrong thing yeah and you\nknow good enough and safe enough and if\nwe're intentional and we're really\ntrying like recognizing that we will\nmess up and that's part of this process\nwith them is we might assume a cue a\ncertain way and they don't and then we\ncan repair that so right I love that\ndistinction thank you for making that\nand clarifying it because again I do\nwork with a lot of clients who are also\nparents and who are trying very\nintentionally to be conscious parents\nand I love that you\nand acknowledge that distinction so\nwhile it is helpful and it can be a\nmoment of conversation making sure again\nthe parent is aware that in that acutely\nemotional moment it is actually\nexperienced by the child as an\nadditional stress or because again a\nwell-intentioned parent trying so\ndesperately to be very conscious you\nknow I my concern the reason why I asked\nfor that clarity is that then it's\nalmost an overly questioning and an\nattempt at trying to over verbally\ncommunicate again with the child who is\nin too much of a distressed state to do\nthat so maybe neither again that\nattunement around the emotional world of\nthe child comes first before even an\nattempted verbally understanding favor\nwhen the child is to activate it I think\nI'm here you say it's just meeting them\nholding space and then emotion is always\ngoing to be preferable so thank you for\nclarifying so I think again that could\ncome up from a very well-intentioned\nplace but could possibly just be\nexacerbating the the child's response\nyes\nthe intellectualizing kind of\nconsciousness and what that means and\nhow where we are and we want to share I\nthink this happens like with adult\nrelationships too we're in the moment\nit's you want to intellectualize and\nshare all this great stuff you're\nlearning but the other person just isn't\nready and it's triggering so I think the\nmore we can recognize how that feels the\nmore we can understand how it might be\nhelpful for them in the moment so and\nthen so I would go so one observed to\nfocus on the emotional aspects versus\nlogical three is acknowledged validate\nnormalized and for when they're calm\nenough and reaffirmed the limit and the\nwhy so going back to the toy example I\nwould say what we can't get this toy\ntoday because you know whatever your Y\nis or maybe you know there isn't it\ndoesn't mean to be this really profound\nwhy just we aren't getting in toy today\ntoday isn't a toy a day to get toys so\nreaffirming that there is the\npracticality and reaffirming the limit\nin a connected way so instead of a\npunitive way which I think you know if\nif a caregiver is feeling guilty and\nthey you know maybe there's not money\nfor the toy or there's stress behind it\nthen that can come out and say no we're\nnot getting a toy today no this is not\nhappening so it's again more about the\nhow more about that no we can't get that\nI'd be so cool if we could but today\nisn't a toy day you can't you know maybe\nmaybe in a few weeks or then getting to\nproblem solving so the last step is\nproblem-solve and I wonder if it would\nhelp if we did a pillow fight for five\nminutes when we got home or what if I I\nwonder if it would help if you know I\nknow you're really bummed about the toy\nI wonder if you want a piggyback ride to\nthe car or helping them to visualize and\nmove back to a positive interacted state\nso anytime we go through this negative\neffect a sexual experience together and\nthen move back to a positive and it's\nthis constant balance of letting time or\ncreating space for the emotion to\nrelease and then getting back to the\npositive so it's building the cycle of\nregulation and the child that they can\npull from down the road when it's time\nfor them to self-regulate so\nproblem-solving or visualizing in their\nmind that there is something after that\nmoment in the store where they're sad\nand helping them get there so that's the\nfinal step before I would say or a pair\nif needed so I love that kind of stop\nyou here for a second I guess yes have a\nquestion I want to get both of the\nexamples you gave in that kind of return\nto positive co-regulation were\ninteractive right you I mean just what I\nheard Ray's piggyback ride pillow fight\nyou us parent car involves and I'm just\nwondering actually for demos advocacy is\nthat important that you engage in the\npositive experience because again I'm\njust thinking and this is probably again\ncoming from my own experience another\nversion could be here here's ice cream\nthat I know you like here so you can\nreturn to happy from this bowl of ice\ncream but mom can obviously be in the\nother room and not a part of my my\nhappiness in my ice cream into a coffee\nthat's my personal example I'm using\nyeah how important is it that the parent\nit's a really put it simply kind of be\ninvolved in that or be a participant in\nthat\nin future even in the imagining aspect\nof an annual of the execution of it or\nis it okay to find something that the\nchild can engage in more individually\nthat also is just toward that more\npositive effective experience mm-hmm\ngreat question so when we're thinking\nabout how we used to be you know all in\na tribe and when we were so connected\nand the relationship was really set a\nstage for our safety and our security\nand it was the biggest tool for\nregulation so biologically and our\nnervous systems are wired for connection\nso if we can take out all this noise\nthat we learned it really is innate in\nus to go to another human when we're\nupset or when we need something or when\nwe need to feel and exchange the energy\nso yes so focusing on positive\ninteraction with another human is a lot\ndifferent than oh you know what let's go\nget this candy bar it'll make you feel\nbetter or right now resorting to okay\nhere's an iPad like you're done crying\nhere's the iPad you can go on after 10\nminutes so how do we shift in a way that\nwill help them realize that humans are\nsafe enough to go to when they're upset\nso one thing I think about and teen\nsuicide which is really close to my\nheart is we want kids no matter the age\nto come to us when things are difficult\nor when things are tough so if we can\nteach them at the young age that yes go\nto human things will get better things\nwill be more positive then that sets the\nstage for life and so many of us don't\nhave adapted patterns when it comes to\nbeing upset so we go to malady after\nthings like scrolling social media\nmindlessly or perfecting everything in\nour lives performing or doing constantly\ninstead of being with others there's so\nmany tools or addiction you know\nalcoholism drugs there's so many numbing\nthings that we use because we're trying\nto feel better and we didn't get this\nrepetition of feeling what it's like to\nfeel with a human and release some\nemotion and metabolize it in a safe way\nso we all have like you said that stuck\nenergy that's built versus this ability\nto be present in the moment to share it\nand to move on and to recognize that\nit's all part of the human experience\nand it's how were wired absolutely thank\nyou for clarifying and I'm not surprised\nthat that was was the answer but I do\njust want to acknowledge that because I\nthink again another tendency can be to\nuse the thing and that can again\ntranslate like you're saying so the\nadult then who books for the thing\nthat's not obviously a person yes and\nthen repairs so anytime there's a\nrupture in their relationship so\nrecognizing that none of us are perfect\nperfection is not the goal even as as\npart of the developmental process\nanytime we mess up so yes these are all\nbeautiful opportunities these emotional\nexperiences are opportunities to connect\nand help them develop regulation however\nif you've had a lot of opportunities in\na shorter short amount of time I'm\nfeeling with whoever you are because\nit's not simple and it's it's not you\nknow it's much easier to talk about and\nto intellectualize and to go through\nthese cognitive steps than it is to be\nin the moment triggered and everybody's\ncrying and you're pulled in all these\ndifferent directions so recognizing that\ngood enough and present as present as we\ncan be is the goal and then anytime we\ndo mess up so you yell a little bit\nlouder than you wanted to maybe you grab\nthem harder than you meant to so anytime\nwe have a rupture like that then we make\nrepair so maybe afterward you talk about\nit or even draw a picture of what\nhappened and tell a story about it and\ntell the child that how you're feeling\nso I didn't mean to mean I didn't mean\nto I yelled louder than I meant to maybe\nthat was scary like you could have been\nscared that makes sense you know next\ntime I will I'm trying to not yell as\nloudly and you know whatever it is for\nyou so creating a story that makes the\nchild\nlet's the child know that it wasn't\ntheir fault\nit wasn't because of them it was because\ntheir parents a human going through this\nprocess too so it's it's a big way to\ncreate resilience in the child and let\nthem know that things will go wrong in\nlife and things will happen but it\ndoesn't mean that they're bad or things\naren't okay or that conflict isn't safe\nit means that we can get through it\ntogether and it sets them up for not\njust relational stress but academics\nstress or life stress that comes up so\nrupture repair is a big ending to any\ntime we do inevitably mess up yeah\nabsolutely I love that you're touching\non the value of those or parent moments\nin terms of becoming the more resilient\nyou know that adult you know so having a\nparent who's able to admit when you know\nand because again I get a lot of parents\nthat will reach out to me in one of two\nways right oh I did this shameful thing\ntriggered by my child but I'll also have\nparents reach out to me especially when\nI talk about the theta wave\ndevelopmental period or a birth to age\nseven yeah of a lot of like oh shoot\nlike that's I'm already past that I by\nare you know and my answer regardless of\nthe moment you're reaching out is always\nthe same that they're there's so much\nmore you know than value and repair and\ntalking about it and you know we are all\nhuman and if damage is more often done\nwhen you have the parent who does it for\ntheir own you know kind of difficult you\nknow reasons not want to admit those\nthings because they can hear the child's\nbrain like I will always say is gonna\nmake it's gonna find a story it's gonna\nspin its own story so if you can fill in\nthe pieces with the reality of what it\nwas that likely like I said earlier and\nyou're also acknowledging the child God\nwas attuned to underserving on a level\nso if you come back and you just\nacknowledge and give worse so the\nreality of the child already sensed I\nbelieve implicitly you're you're not\nonly building up emotional resilience\nthat you're admitting humans are\nfallible and we sometimes don't do great\nthings if the child kinking value in but\nI believe you're actually allowing the\nchild's reality to be more in alignment\nthen so the child can say oh I was\naccurate this was right mom was upset in\nthat moment you know and told me she\nwasn't that's really confusing so I\nthink on a deep level those moments of\nrepair can offer that bow\ndatian in a sense for the child and\ntheir reality that they Arnie were\nvibing on they they knew more or less\nwhat was happening so I think it also\ngives words to that too because again I\nthink a lot of us becoming adult that\ndoesn't trust ourselves because we've\nhad those moments of mismatch where the\nparent didn't come back and say you know\nwhat this is what actually did happen\nand I'm sorry and I'm human and now we\ncan have this beautiful moment of repair\nI think that also is a value in that yes\nwe want to still want to have meaning of\nthings and the coherent narrative of\nwhat happened is super validating so I\nknow I experienced that myself with I\ndidn't really know why these unresolved\nemotion was showing up the way it was\nyou know I thought Oh immune disease I\nhad chronic fatigue I had things that\nwere showing up in my body and really\nkind of forced me to pause because I've\nalways been such a doer\ndoot-doot-doot just don't feel just you\nknow you'll be good feelings name don't\ngo there so it really forced me just\nslow down and to think about what did\nhappen and what my life look like and\nhow this impacted me and the coherent\nnarrative is such a big piece of our own\njourneys in a way that it's so cool now\nto think about how we're doing that for\nkids in this rupture of hair sequence\nand you know creating this tape that\nyou're like you're right it's it's more\nclosely related to the truth versus the\nmaladaptive stories that we tell\nourselves for lives and if they're not\ncoming out and then I'm meeting po-wei\n100% 100% and I think Thank You Katie\nseriously the this conversation today\nand I mean the takeaways that I have and\nagain not even having children and I\nthink I really appreciate your I mean\nall of your work to be honest not only\nthe way you can sexualize and understand\nyou know kind of I think all of these\ndifferent levels of parenting and of\nemotion and emotional resilience and\nnervous system activation and really\nputting it together in these real really\npractical applications and approaches I\nthink there's gonna be many parents out\nthere that are going to listen to this\nyou're going to have a take away so not\nonly a deeper understanding of what's\ngoing on but ok and now with what to do\nI think there's a lot of us I\ndesperately want to start to do\ndifferent and that because some of this\nis really overwhelming and because again\nwe're a human involved in the scenario\nand having our own emotional experiences\nto what's happening that having these\npractical understanding but also that go\nto the tools that exactly what to do in\nthe moment I think you're gonna shift an\nimpact just from this conversation here\ntoday a lot of parents out there beyond\nthe amazing work that you're doing so I\ndon't want to listening I'm going to\nlink up all of your information below\nfrom thriving littles I seriously am\nalways when parents reach out to me and\nI'm always directing them to to all of\nyour work and your stuff because it's\njust parent even not having parents I\nmean we're not having children I think\nyou just have such an invaluable force\nin this world and I so appreciate you\ntaking the time to to chat with me today\nand
