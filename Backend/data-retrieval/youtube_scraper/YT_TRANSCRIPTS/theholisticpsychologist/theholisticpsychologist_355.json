    "transcript": "dr. Niccole up our holistic psychologist\nhere if you like what you hear today in\nthis video take a moment and subscribe\nto my channel afterward this video is\ngoing to be on mental resistance so what\nis mental resistance mental resistance\nis the internal thoughts or chatter that\nwe all experience that prevent us from\ndoing from completing an action from\ndoing something we set an intention to\ndo we mean to do we want to do it is\nsomething that we all experience the\nreason is it comes from our subconscious\nthe subconscious is a part of our brain\nthat stores literally our habits put it\nreally simply it stores our habits and\nthe reality is we run in that\nsubconscious on those programs if you\nwill ninety-five percent of our day so\nwhen we want to make a new choice or\nwhen we have a new intention what we're\ndoing is we're going against those old\nhabits why why do we have this mental\nresistance our subconscious operates\nwith what is called a homeostatic\nimpulse it's the reason why we're stuck\nso what is a homeostatic impulse our\nsubconscious regulates two areas it\nregulates our physiological body which\nis great because we don't really want to\nthink nor can we really think about\nregulating things like our heartbeat or\nour body temperature right that happens\ndaily our heart could speed up and then\nit slows down back into a range or range\nof balance that's what homeostatic means\nsame thing with our body temperature our\nbody temperature fluctuates and then our\nbody kind of accommodates that or brings\nit back into a range so that we can feel\ngood and healthy and our bodies can\ncontinue on this is controlled within\nour subconscious and it's a good thing\nbecause personally I don't want to think\nall day long about what my heart's doing\nor you know what my temperature is so\nvery neat it our subconscious also does\nthat for our psychological or mental\nworld so to put it really simply our\nsubconscious\nhas a range of thoughts that we\ntypically think of feelings that we\ntypically feel and of behaviors that we\ntypically do and this is based on what\nwe've done so it has a balanced area or\na zone of comfort if you will so each\ntime we try to move out of that by\nthinking a new thought by having a new\nfeeling by creating a new habit our\nsubconscious literally pulls us back and\nsays no no this is not something I'm\nused to this is not the program I'm\nstill running come back here and get\nwithin range so this is a big big reason\nwhy those of us out there who have tried\nto change understand how hard it is to\nchange because I could send a new\nintention so tomorrow you know I'm gonna\nwake up earlier and I'm gonna do I'm\ngonna meditate for five minutes I try to\nget up earlier and what happens this\nhappens to me every day to be honest I\nwake up and my mind starts my mind says\noh you didn't sleep well you're tired\nlight bed a little bit more right that's\nmy chatter if I were to listen to my\nmind and make a choice based on that I\nwould stay in bed I'd go right back to\nthat old habit of sleeping in same thing\nso I get up and now I've made a choice\nto get up and I'm gonna go meditate\nagain my brain is not used to that habit\nof meditating it's used to picking up my\nphone and mindlessly scrolling so when\nI'm sitting there trying to meditate my\nbrain is gonna say my mind's gonna say\noh what about those emails you're\nstarting early today go go get the\nthings you need to get done again this\nis examples of pulling it back into that\ncomfort zone into that memorized me that\nmy subconscious has stored this is why\nit's so important to expand our\nconsciousness to be aware of those\nmovements to know that we are a\nconsciousness we're an awareness that\ncan make different choices so know that\nresistance is part of change it's part\nof change for all of us but also\nunderstand that we have the control and\nwe can make those new choices so I get\nup and my brain tells me to go back to\nbed I choose to get up anyway I choose\nto go and sit on that cushion I choose\nnot my subconscious and each time you\nmake those choices we're doing is we're\ncreating a new habit the more\nconsistently I do that the more I learn\nto incorporate new aspects of thoughts\nnew feelings new experiences into my\nzone of comfort that'll make it easier\nfor me to keep doing that but I think\nthis is really important because a lot\nof us take those thoughts and we either\nbelieve them we take them to mean that\nword this is a one I hear really really\noften that we're lazy that we're\nundisciplined and then we throw our\nhands up hopelessly and say see I can\nchange you can all change we can all\nchange this is why we're stuck our\nsubconscious likes to keep us stuck but\nwe all have choice so thank you guys for\nlistening next week I'm going to do a\nvideo with some easy steps to create new\nhabits because new habits new rituals\nare how we break out of this\nsubconscious so stay tuned those of you\nwho are subscribed will get an email\nwhen this video releases and those of\nyou who have not yet subscribed please\nfeel free to do so"
