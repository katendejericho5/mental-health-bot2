    "transcript": "hello everyone this is dr. Nicola paired\nthe holistic psychologist here I'm here\nwith a self heal her name Teresa so a\nlittle backstory\nshe has been on an incredible healing\njourney of her own for several years now\nshe's going to tell you all about it but\nhow her and I got connected issues very\nvery active in the community very active\nin the comments-section\nalways kind of touching me with the\ncomments that that she was writing you\nknow I jumped in her stories a couple\ntimes and really really profound\nprofound stuff around healing so I was\ndoing a live then and randomly she\nrequested to come live with me and I\nhappened to pick her name and she came\non and we talked a little bit about her\nhealing journey and a lot of you guys\nout there were relating to a lot of\nthings that that Theresa was talking\nabout so I made the decision obviously\nthe universe brought us together so I\nthought we should have a little more of\nan in-depth conversation and I'm hoping\nit could help you guys so particularly\ntoday we're going to talk about kind of\ntwo interconnected very loaded topics if\nyou ask me and I think if you ask a lot\nof the other healers out there topics of\nself-care prioritizing self-care and\nboundaries and how both of those kind of\nevolve in our journeys so here is\nTheresa tell us a little bit hi first of\nall thank you for coming on and and\nagreeing to have further conversation\nyeah you're doing incredible work so\ntell me a little bit this has been quite\na journey for you can you tell me yeah\ntell us all a little bit about how you\ngot started or what kind of propelled\nyou into all things self healing and\nthen obviously how did it go okay I my\nname is Theresa and I live in Canada\njust outside of Toronto and um let's see\nI'd say this started probably about nine\nyears ago when I separated from my\nhusband we have two beautiful children\nand they were six and eight at the time\nand I would say that I was around I was\n41 I just said 40 and I was going\nthrough at the time it was a breakdown\nbut I\nI have redefined it as a breakthrough\nand sensory defined it's like an\nawakening right and so I guess up to\nthat point like the majority of my life\nI would say that I lived I was always a\nhappy person is a positive person I was\na help helping type person but I think I\nlent most of my life in that ninety five\npercent you know what I mean of the\nsubconscious like I thought I was had a\npretty healthy self-esteem I thought you\nknow anyways I just got to the point\nwhere I just I turned 42 I had lots of\nmy life boxes checked you know I had a\nbeautiful home I had the two kids you\nknow and I was engaging and all those\nthings that you think of this self-care\nyou know I was doing yoga I was you know\ndoing girls nights out all those things\nand I just there's but there was just\nsomething that I just I just I just had\nto acknowledge that wasn't happy right\nand you know I I just I just kind of\nwoke up so anyways it's been a very long\njourney and I've had moments and periods\nof where there's sort of little mini\nawakenings and aha moments but one of\nthe things that was a turning point for\nme was Eckhart Tolle he's the power of\nnow and that really struck with me\nrealizing that I I pretty much lived\nalways sort of in the past where I felt\na lot of sort of resentment anger you\nknow guilt or I lived in the future\nwhich is a lot of a fear and anxiety\nboth places not very happy places to be\nand so when I started to live more in\nthe present and actually spend more time\njust with myself my voice just got very\nloud and I couldn't even you know I\ncouldn't ignore it anymore\nyou know when she sort of it's very easy\nI think to just kind of deflect and\nproject and blame and come up with\nreasons why and your there was a post\nyou didn't know if it's your most recent\none or two back but where you know I\nthink\nyou try to get to the point of like you\nknow you got all your basic needs match\nand self-esteem and belonging and then\nyou get to that point where you think\nand I don't believe it's the it's it's\nthe end point anymore where you self\nactualize you think okay I'm reached my\nfull potential that you're so tied to\nall those things that define you you\nknow past and future even and and I just\nfelt completely lost so I felt like\nquite honest I woke up and I was like it\nwas like highway hypnosis you know where\nI just I got to this destination and I\nused the metaphor of not only did I not\narrive at a destination I didn't even\nknow how I got there but I was a\npassenger I wasn't even the driver and I\nwasn't even in my own car so I pretty\nmuch just jumped out yeah tuck and roll\ntalking about a well-know truce I mean\nyou're you're really I think hitting on\na lot of realities for probably a lot of\nus you know hearing you say that\nobjectively if you will eyes checked\nboxes right I was doing the things I had\nthe family the house even self care I\nwas maintaining yoga and friends and\neverything that we hear and think and\nknow on some level because it is the\nreality of it is those things are\nhelpful right but I think what you're\nreally highlighting is the power of the\nminds role in all of that so while all\nof that was the case for you right where\nyour perspective point was like you said\nbe it in the few past or in the future\non that more moment-by-moment basis is\nthat overruled in a sense all of the\nother stuff that was still there and I\nbring that up because I can imagine a\nlot of people out here listening you\nknow probably might feel similarly like\nokay what is so why am i you know if I\ndo stop and ask myself why am I not as\nhappy or fulfilled or actualized as I\ncould be because maybe a lot of people\nout there listening more like you and\nare doing the things you know and but\nstill aren't the power I think of the\nmind is so is so so strong it's such a\npart of I truly believe what is keeping\nmy stock and then ultimately what allows\nus whatever\nyou're talking about another point to\nwhich I think is important and impactful\nenticing with this idea of self care and\nfounded a lot of us I think you know\nhabitually assume roles like that of you\nknow child civic sibling eventually\nmother wife professional you know and\nit's not to say that there's not value\nin those roles of course there is and\nsome of us even feel validated by those\nroles but I think again you're sharing\nprobably a similar experience that a lot\nof us have when the majority or an over\nyou know kind of disproportionate amount\nof our value as a person is ascribed to\nthose roles then I think a lot of people\nhave that destabilizing experience as\nwell really big points yeah and I think\nfor me that I started to realize that\nyou know if you think of\nself-actualization as like reaching your\nfull potential living your best life\nwhatever you want to call it as sort of\nlike the end goal then it really isn't\nthe end goal because you could\nconstantly be chasing you know so cope\nwith so what I found was that I was very\ngoal-oriented and I had you know\ngratitude journals I had daily intention\njournals I had you know calendars with\nquotes and motivational posters\neverywhere I was doing all the things\nright and I always had multiple\nself-help books on my nightstand and\nwhat I realized was that you know it's\nkind of like that's why when I jumped on\nI was I've been going to that something\nyou're you were so helpful and helping\nme unpack that but I started to realize\nlike it's almost like you know that's\nthat child that's you know like on the\npark you know doing something new it's\nlike mom look at me look at me like you\nspend your whole life sort of look at me\nlook at me and trying to identify you\nknow where your natural abilities and\ntalents aren't build and hone those\nskills so you can identify yourself in\nroles and functions achievements\nwhatever and then I'm trying to get to\nthe point where I'm just trying to\ntranscend beyond that like I'm trying to\nit's it's funny it's like ironic it's\nlike you build all this up\njust erase it all like like I'm aware I\njust I want to be free of it yeah no\nabsolutely I I often myself even think\nabout a lot of the aspects of the\nhealing process as an unlearning and\nundoing and unpeeling right that kind of\nmetaphor that I think a lot of us use is\nkind of the onion just peeling back all\nof the layers and the programs and\nbeliefs and the disconnect really to be\nhonest from ourselves so I do agree with\nyou it's about so let me ask you as you\nstarted to fall into these realizations\nand did things start to shift then when\nwe talk about self care how you were\ndefining like you said I was doing the\nthings what started to then shift for\nyou as this healing evolved for you yeah\nI think that I really moved from a place\nof thinking of self-care as\nself-indulgent you know and and selfish\nbut it was it was trying to reach out\nbut it was in the cliche forms of what\nyou think of pampering right so it was\nmani-pedis it was retail therapy buying\nnice pair of shoes right it was going\nfor a girls night out dancing all the\nthings that gave you joy that gave me\njoy but there was still a sometimes very\ndifficult to do when you're busy right\nthat involved other people and that\nwe're still externally fed like I really\nI still was dependent on someone else\ndoing my nails or someone else going you\nknow out with me and so when I kind of\nfor me self-care just shifted into the\noverarching sort of umbrella is just\nit's it's when I'm by myself like\nwhatever that looks like I can see your\neyes going yeah like that for me like I\nhad this sort of Epiphany it was about\nsix months after I separated and it was\nChristmas Eve and it was I was 40 41 and\nit was the first time in my whole life\nthat I've been alone because my\nex-husband his Christmas was always on\nChristmas Eve and mine was on Christmas\nDay and I had places to go like the\ngirls were with him I just didn't feel\nlike pretending to be okay for everybody\nbecause wish I knew I would\nit was the first time I was alone and\nanyways I have a story on it but I just\nit was like an hour of like an\nout-of-body experience when I realized\nthat I'm not alone like I have myself\nthat I am actually the most powerful\nperson and to deceive myself to make\ncomfort myself and then all of a sudden\nit just started a long time just like\ngoing to movies by myself I think things\nthat I love go to coffee and people\nwatching right and anyway so my my\ndefinition of self-care is now expanded\nquite a bit and so I still do those\nthings like I do my nails and seeing\nsome girlfriends tomorrow but the daily\nself-care is really a lot of what you\nsay like it's it's such annoying it's\nthat breathwork it's going up nature\nit's the picking it back it really is\neasy right and it doesn't impact anyone\nit doesn't take away from anyone so of\ncourse it's not selfish it's just taking\ncare of yourself right and then as I\nstarted to develop it as part of my\npractice because generally I try to have\nself cares as a proactive rather than\nreactive\nI certainly check my resources right\nwhen I'm feeling like I'm depleting my\nreserves and as jumper then but it's\nmuch more easier I think to self-care\nwhen you're proactive and just you know\nyour cups are sort of always sort of\nmore than half-full right rather than\nreactive ly going oh gosh I just you\nknow just telling a friend cancelling up\nlast night because you have you need\ntime for yourself so anyway so now I've\nmoved now into more broadening even more\nso self-care that is much more difficult\nbecause it does impact other people like\ncreating boundaries like saying to\npeople like asking for help sometimes\nright accepting help so so yes my my\ndefinition of South cares and and it's\ndefinitely now more perceived because\nsomething that once you identify that\nthere is another self that there is a\nself that you need to care for whether\nit's your child self or your your\nConte yourself whatever it is then it's\nnot even a choice like if you are going\nto do for others you're going to care\nfor this you you have to start first\nwith yourself there's three sides\nI literally at one point I got chills\nfrom what you were saying there's just\nso much gold there so I mean again\nprobably really relatable I agree with\nyou I think sometimes even societally\nright we have different levels of\nmessaging and I'm gonna go ahead and say\nthat the greatest level right global\nsocietally I do agree that a lot of us\nhave defined self-care as those more\nindulgent based things right you know\nthe feel-good and I I do agree with you\nthat it's beyond that I do agree with\nyou for similar reasons that part of the\nproblem with looking for anything\noutside of us as an individual that we\nare - I'm gonna simplify this to feel\nbetter in any way right whether I feel\nbetter hi hairs did or my nails are done\nor I feel better if I hold that friend\nyou know what and then they maybe feel\nbetter again not that we can't rely on\nsupport of others of course we can but\nthe problem becomes when it's an\nover-reliance when our only Ralph to\nfeel better is through something outside\nof ourselves and I agree with you I\nthink it becomes the biggest goal of\nhealing and this starts for many\ndifferent factors obviously is probably\na much deeper longer conversation about\nwhere this originates right a lot of us\nwere not modeled given the tools you\nknow other etc.etc ways to self-regulate\nare as children you know we have you\nhave adults around us that were you know\ndoing the self-care thing in this more\nintimate emotion face away I think\nthat's part of South care too right how\ndo I make myself feel better when I'm\ntired when I'm anxious when I'm angry\nwhen I'm happy what do I do and I think\nof a lot of us asked ourselves that\nquestion right now we might not know and\nI know there was a very pivotal moment\nwhen I was in my I think it was probably\nmid 20s or late 20s at one point and\nsomeone had asked me a very simple\nquestion what I want it was about\nsomething superficial like holiday plan\nsites and I honestly was so dumbfounded\nI did not know so if I did not know what\nwant it how I want to spend my holiday\nyou better believe I had no idea how to\nmanage my emotion so I agree with you\nand I love that expanded definition of\nwhat self-care is it means and I love\nthe examples you get because a lot of\npeople out there listening to might feel\noverwhelmed well I don't know how to be\nalone alone has a lot of negative\nassociations with it I don't know what\nto do then just start and just like you\nsaid it can really be as simple as let\nme go take a bath let me go on a walk\nlet me go to the coffee shop and maybe\nI'll have my coffee to go and maybe\nsomeone comfortable being alone in\npublic this you know ten minutes to\ndrink a coffee might be a great start I\njust think that's such a great evolution\ninto self-care because then when we\nreally dig down into it that evolved\ninto okay now I know what I need to do\ncuz we're not going to get there right\naway\nI know how to take care of myself when\nI'm sad now I know and that is the most\npowerful place to be like you said well\nwe don't identify our own power and and\nthe reality of it that no one can make\nus feel better you know win ourselves\nright and because if you ascribe to the\nflipside to which is amazing that no one\ncan make you angry no one can make you\nlose it and go and say gosh definitely\nlost it and dysregulated but but no one\ncan make you that's just a choice like\nyou know that's the thing is that you\nknow there's this book of Viktor Frankl\nI love him answers for me you know that\nwhen my favorite closes is in between a\nstimulus and on response it's a space\nright and you have control not only of\nyour response right your power is within\nthat space but I've also learned that\nyou can actually tighten the space or\nincrease it and space itself is actually\nquite infinite like but but I guess I\nrealized that I I there's certain things\nwhere you know if you're hungry you're\nhormonal you know life stuff that makes\nit difficult for me to create space and\nit gets very very tight and so little\nthings like you know a comment or a\nlike at work or or something that just\ndoesn't go your way can trigger me make\nthe choice right to blame to make the\nchoice to react we get angry whatever it\nis but when I'm more mindful and I\npractice those parts of self-care that\ninvolves solitude that involved just\ndaily just check-in right\nchecking my reserves and giving only in\nproportion to what I have right not\noverexerting myself then I'm I'm able to\nreally open up that sink quite a bit you\nknow and it doesn't matter what happens\nbecause I'm able to realize that I can\ncontrol me and it's it's scary at first\nwhen you're used to not making decisions\nwhen you're used to not taking\nresponsibility because it's just easier\nto react but once you it's the most\namazing it's empowering\nWow right yes yes that's so incredibly\npowerful I agree I do think a lot of\npeople this concept of accountability\nyou know acknowledging that there is a\nchoice there I had one I honestly think\nit was a supervisor very early in my\ntraining said something along the lines\nto me that everything is a choice and at\nthat point I was really struck by that\nconcept and I was a little unsure of\nthat over time as I've evolved from my\nown healing I completely agree with that\nand I do think that there's a\ndouble-edged sword of accountability\nyour self responsibility which is it's\nreally can be overwhelming and it could\nbe a duck it's JC like a betrayal OTT of\nus get used to externalizing claiming\nthe world out there because again that's\nwhat we are shown as messages we\nreceived but I do think the other side\nof that sword is huge power and you know\nI just think choice is everything and I\nlove that so there is a space between it\nall and I think what this and part of\nthe healing process is shifting out of\nbringing the subconscious back in right\nthat more habitual mindless way of being\nwhere for a lot of us when we're in\nthose moments and you're right when our\nresources are low right when we're\nreally getting triggered at that Heath\nway right\nit really takes me back to that really\nterrible thing that happened a million\ndifferent reasons our space gets smaller\nand smaller but I love the suggestion\nyou made I make a similar one I call it\na resource check-in and this tied\ntogether something that you referenced\nearlier too we need to be so self aware\nand acknowledge that there are days\nmoments days weeks even where we're just\nlimited on resources for many different\nreasons\nformal is half of sleep right stress in\nour world we're just not there and I\nthink in those moments we do our selves\nthe greatest disservice by not taking\nmore space then and by snapping that\ntext right back right when we are\nimagine resources we are we are\npractically living in our emotional\nbrain and that's where all of us habits\na car and you reference something\nearlier and I think it's important so I\njust want to highlight it here the\nconcept of that consistently right we\ncan't wait until we're in that acute\nmoment to then enjoy these coping skills\nand that's why people who work with me\nor here I think the word consistency a\nmillion times because you are right we\nneed to have a habit that's so\nconsistent so that will more in that\nacute moment right we can do our\nresearch check in hold space step away\nfrom the triggering event if you need to\nto have access to choice back sometimes\nit's time we needs a lot our emotional\nbrain deactivate enough so that we can\nbring online right a choice because\nchoice lives are more frontal lobe right\nbut I doing that and if we expect to oh\njust employ breath work or mindfulness\nonly in the as need at moment yeah\nreally disappointed so I agree and\nthat's why it's about lifestyle and\nabout half yeah I would argue as well\nthat the breath work I don't go I don't\nget there certainly as often as I used\nto but that actually doesn't help you in\ncrisis like when you think about the\nthere's like a pre pre crisis crisis and\npost crisis continuum and we use this\nfor dealing with children right\nbut that asking a child when they've\ncompletely had a meltdown\noh just count to 10 right now do your\nbreathing right\nit's almost like when it's closed when\nit's crisis vision you have to wait to\npost crisis to just let it run its\ncourse like the things that for me the\nbreeze the breastworks the mindfulness\nthe resource tracks all those things\nthey happen almost pre-crisis right like\nif you make them part of your practice\nyou're always kind of stopping it's that\ncrisis point right so if I do get to the\npoint of where I've tipped because I\njust have neglected the signs that like\nyou know T like you know you need to\njust say no right now you need to not\nshut your mouth and don't offer to help\nright now or or like you said when your\nsister calls just you know put some\nvoicemail and texture that you'll call\nher tomorrow whatever it is that if you\ndon't pay attention to those warning\nsigns that's where all the work happens\nbecause once you're in crisis once\nyou've had a complete and sometimes\nneeded like I've had a good power pride\nthat's I've tried to avoid the crisis\nthere's no that happens in crisis I'm\nnot sitting there worried about trying\nto you know do a body scan jacket you\nknow when I'm completely lost it like I\njust realized you know what I just need\nto have compassion right for myself let\nmyself just kind of like run its course\nand after that's where it's like hmm why\ndid that happen\nwhat what what were the warning signs\nlike and also to not to not judge myself\nfor being dysregulated for eating like\nan [ __ ] or for whatever it is that\ngot me to the point where I just had no\nno strategies at that point 100% and\nthat is the reality I mean you couldn't\nhave spoken it better that that is it\nand we do once cause crisis is some\nversion of an emotional reaction I say\nthat sentence arts our emotional brain\nthe limbic system and all that's\ninvolved in it and this is where trauma\nmemories legs and those of us with\nexperience whether it's a cue or a more\nchronic low-grade trauma right before we\nknow it we're right back in that\nand in our and the way the brain works\nstructurally it does more or less limit\nthe access that we have to the frontal\nlobe to choice to the ability to say or\ndo something different I love how you\nsaid in those moments it is about\ncompassion and it's about removing\nourselves from possibly complicating\nthings more by the problem\nthere are choice lies in terms of the\nreaction right if I can feel myself\ngetting to that boiling point it might\nbe better that I'm just me\nI don't go to have those plans with that\ntrend today or you know I do take a few\nmoments by myself if I can even activate\nto that choice in that moment and then\nafterward it is about self compassion\nand it is about I think using that as a\nlearning experience like let me view\nwhat is it what I do how could I have\nknown and then I I can even make an\nargument but on the deepest level there\nis an implicit learning that is\nhappening in those moments that you can\ntolerate really big huge uncomfortable\nfeelings because I think a lot of us\nespecially those of us who have suffered\nbig huge uncomfortable feelings whether\nit be at the hands of a traumatic event\nor someone like myself who has had\nanxiety and panic my whole life felt\ncompletely out of control right me my\ndeepest level of healing came when I\nfinally internalized so I came to\nbelieve about myself that I could\ntolerate any and all feelings so I think\nthere's a beautiful deep lesson on the\nother side of break down even which is\nand I made it you know my world didn't\ncrumble it was less than it was less\nthan shiny but everything okay and I\nthink that's a huge pivotal lesson so\ntalk to me you've already introduced\nthis topic of saying no to others how\ndoes talk to me out the boundary aspect\nof this and when that really started to\nI think kind of present itself what\nboundaries you know kind of you know\nmeaning you need it to insert all and\nhow it was because I bring this up\nbecause boundaries is a huge topic and I\nthink an implicit part of healing\nbecause before we know it we start to do\ndifferent someone some relational car\nlife rightful the strain of that so I\nthink pretty much everyone out there\nat some point has come up against a\nboundary something or other so talk to\nme about how how that all kind of inter\nplayed in your healing and what the\ndifficult aspects were for you and um so\nfor me um I grew up in a you know it's\nfunny whenever I would be I read a lot\nabout dysfunctional families codependent\nfamilies because my family I mean I was\nin a huge trauma or abuse or anything\nand so there's a lot of guilt\nworrying about these first world\nproblems and what is like so for me\nevery family by definition is\ndysfunctional I mean you're sticking\ntogether a bunch of people with\ndifferent personalities you know\ndifferent temperaments you know\neverything and expecting them to you\nknow unconditionally accept and love\neach other but you know learning always\nhappens so anyways for me I think I was\nin a very codependent dysfunctional\nwhatever you want to call that but it\nwas a very weak kind of environment of\nyou know very strong-willed\npersonalities my parents are very\nhard-working immigrants very loving who\nyou know they come you know educated in\nKorea but coming here to work in jobs\nthey were educated for to do for their\nchildren so their children are supposed\nto do for the family right so everything\nbecame about you know I was in school I\nwas I did very well I was supposed to be\na doctor I'm gonna be a doctor and so I\nthat's that's how you know I've moved\npast I don't because it's a choice I\ndon't blame my parents it's just to give\ncontext but I went through school this\nwas a narrative I told myself is that\nI'm smart at school so I need to fully\nyou know achieve to my potential and do\nmath and sciences even though I had\ninterest in like arts and creative\nwriting and stuff but just stayed\nstraight through to science and I also\ntold myself that I was the oldest of\nthree parents that often work latchkey\nkids and so I with the mother I'm you\nknow\nwas Mother Teresa when I was growing up\nthat I was the mother of my my siblings\nand so anyway yes absolutely when I when\nI separated everyone was shocked because\nI I never complained I just pretended\neverything's okay so I was like what's\nlike like what are you talk and I was my\nmind and then when I started to retreat\nand be very selective about who I let in\nbecause I just I needed to process and\nfit in it myself and get very very\nvulnerable and I just was not\ncomfortable to do that with everybody I\nsaid I really did start to see where the\nboundaries were very difficult for me\nyou know and you know and that's where\nI'm pretty good now but they do get more\nblurred the closer the relationship is\nthis person of course right and so I\njust now know - sometimes you know the\ntoxic people that were in my life I just\nkind of removed completely and then the\nones that you can't and you don't want\nnecessarily want - there's a history\nthere I've just learned to - yeah just I\ndon't know just take I don't know I\ndon't want to try say except that I just\nwant to not let there I guess okay I\nneed an example there's a picture of\nthat I've used often of a girl there are\ntwo kids on a pier a girl in a pretty\npink dress with all those pink balloons\nand then there's a boy with a black\nhoodie with a bunch of black balloons\nand the girl is extending she's in\nabundance and extending one of her pink\nballoons to this little boy and the boys\ngot his head down he's reaching out to\nget it so to me this is what boundaries\nI used to be I don't think self-care\nself is selfish when you are not in\nabundance\nright like so I you know I don't give\nout all my pink balloons when I have\nnone but what I used to do is not only\ngive out all my simplest I would take\nall the black ones\ndude I mean like so I I would not only\njust more than on themes and not\ncheck my resources and give everything\naway\nI also took everybody else's yes and so\nand so I had that sort of rescuer martyr\nSavior kind of mentality that I put on\nmyself and it was it was reinforcing to\nmyself because it you know first who\ndoesn't like to think of themselves is\nlike someone who helps people and\nchanges people's lives and makes people\nhappy but it's not your but I realized\nthat happiness that I derive from\nhelping others was not my own right and\nit came out across because I felt very\nresentful\nso as I've learned create boundaries I\nnow it's amazing I don't do anything I\ndon't want to do anymore so that\nresentment is not there because if I do\nsomething and I feel resentful I was\nlike well you know you made that choice\nyeah no absolutely I I talked to people\noften you know about the need to be I\ndid a post on honesty with ourselves\nthis week because I talk to people often\nand I think the natural tendency for\nunderstandable reasons right is if\nthings feel again I'm gonna simplify it\nunequal to whatever extent in a\nrelationship so one is giving more than\none feels they are receiving right the\nmore that happens over time\nwhat creeps in and is a killer in my\nopinion of relationships is resentment\nright because before I know it I start\npointing my finger at you you know\nTeresa who's not doing for me who's not\nmeaning my knees who I'm doing too much\nfor when really the finger needs to\npoint it maybe why am i yeah why am I\nstill showing up in those ways but I\nthink this connects to cuz it's\ninteresting we and I work with them so\nmany of us now but for Senate of people\nwho will self-identify if you will as\nyou know people energetically sensitive\nyou know so I can feel others energies\nI'm affected by them that's that's real\nfor a lot of us so to speak to this\npoint when I'm in an interaction and\ndepending on how close this relationship\nis with the little boy be in the black\nhoodie right now before I know it\nwhether or not anything is even I'm even\ndoing regarding what I'm even doing in\nthe context of our relationship I some\nof us can very much sense the energy of\nthe other person\nrelated so there's that aspect of it\nright but then if you are the way you\nhave this I'm imagining that's probably\na pattern for you of giving of taking on\nnegative toxic energies of others I\ndon't know where it originated but just\nsomething a little bit of your childhood\nthat you shared with me it sounds like\nright you were kind of embodying that\nrole of caretaker right for your younger\nsiblings right back from the days of\nbeing Mother Teresa right so I say this\nbecause we learn relationships and we\nlearn our part in relationships from the\nsecond we come to this planet however it\nis you think we get here right we're\ndeposited in some version of a\ncaregiving environment it looks\ndifferent for all of us who's involved\nor who is it involved right but\nultimately we are getting some\ninformation observational about what we\nsee in terms of people relating some of\nus are given direct messages about\nrelationships how they work what's okay\nagain I'm supplying it what's not okay\nright and then we experience ourselves\nin relationships with all of these other\npeople before we know and we internalize\na model not only of relationships but of\nus in relationship so for you just kind\nof beating this back it sounds like that\nwas one of your very early models of no\nfault of your own of just the necessity\nof the family structure\nyou had to embody that role so I'm not\nsurprised to hear that fast-forward\nhowever many years now of you embodying\nthat role you probably had some\naccumulated feelings and also bound your\nblurred boundaries in a lot of\nrelationships and you are so right so\nwhen I talk to people about boundaries I\nsay explore boundaries right explore you\nknow the difficulties that you're\nidentifying and know that they're gonna\nfeel different and it's going to be\nharder to shift and change your point so\nthe closer the relationship is to us so\nyou did say something interesting how\ndid you start to notice and navigate in\nthe beginning the people that you would\nkind of put a harder boundary in and the\npeople that you would let in a little\nmore how did you make sense of who was\nwhom as you started to explore all of\nthis more interpersonal world yeah I\nthink I started first obviously with my\nimmediate you know my you know my sister\nwho's my best friend my mom my dad my\nimmediate family children it that's a\nwhole other realm of as a mother those\nbound gets completed burglar\nvery difficult but I think I think what\nI did is I came from a place of\ncompassion there's another quote who is\nit you quoted me once too but it was\nabout you know if you are intent on\nimproving or changing then you have to\nalso be content with people thinking\nthat you're foolish and stupid right\nthat you know everyone has their own\nagenda and so I think initially when\npeople whatever form that took whether\nit was like I'm really worried about you\nTeresa like you know like you know\nyou're not going out as much and you\nknow you're challenging and you know my\ninitial feeling it was very visceral\nwhere I I was like well no no I I didn't\nwant to change like I did like I wanted\nto say stop because because it felt\nscary very very scary but what I found\nwas that when I came from a place of\ninstead of being defensive I just\nassumed that it's much easier with the\nit's harder but much easier with people\nthat are closer to you I just realized\nyou know they just want me to be happy\nand so if I assume that but people care\nabout me then I just became a broken\nrecord and I just kept saying like look\nI love you I'm okay I'm on the right\npath I know what I'm doing even if I\ndon't feel it I would say right just to\nreassure them to almost end the\nconversation until I was ready to sort\nof open that up a bit\nand for some people I still haven't\nopened that up and it's it's okay and\nbut for a lot but as like I said as I\nsearch it's funny as you start to create\nthe boundary then you can you can cross\nit back and forth freely journey me like\nlike depending on needs depending on\nwhat being solicited from me but when\nyou don't have the boundary you have no\nidea when you're going to does that make\nyour choice my mind when you have choice\nonce you have a sea of space let's bring\nthat concept back in you can look in\nstart to exert choice yeah yeah so\nthat's what happened is that I just\nstarted to create boundaries and I just\nstarted to not necessarily you know\ndoom I didn't do more than then I had in\nand so I never\nso the resentment started to go away and\nthen and then it's amazing because once\nyou start to fill yourself up first once\nthere was when she start to live your\ntruth and do stay what you mean and mean\nwhat you say kind of thing then there's\nno disconnect and you actually have way\nmore abundance right and then the\nuniverse\nyou know you manifest all that the\nuniverse it it's crazy but it's been now\nalmost 10 years where I'm telling you\nyou when you texted me like it was just\na week ago and I said oh my god I\nsummoned you Nicole like I said like\nweek at work and I just called off\neverything I had a weekend of self-care\nlike said myself physically emotionally\nmentally thing and I woke up on Monday\nmorning gonna work there and makeup\ngoing gosh like I I wish I didn't get to\nthat point where it just like I just had\ncollapsed but I needed it feel good very\nstern weak and I said on Nicole's life\nwe should just meet up for coffee just\nchat with her it sold out yet and I'm\nnot kidding then an hour later followers\nshe gets like hundreds of responses on a\npost within minutes of course scared as\nthey started happening because it would\nhappen with like insects it would happen\nwith music people said you're beautiful\nout of the blue right because most the\ntime it happens when I'm alone but\nliterally sometimes what happens like\nthat moment where you di I'm like what\nwith your professor emailing you back\ncourseware you realize that the universe\nis so abundant and it has everything\nthere for you right it's just have to be\nready to receive it right yeah I love\nthat I love that so I wasn't joking in\nthe beginning of this right when I said\nI think the universe really did connect\nus but you know I think so when we in\nterms it's the cliched thing right I\nthink repulsed has at best I'm you can't\nlove anyone else if you ain't loving\nyourself or something I mean there's so\nmuch truth in that whatever version of\nthat saying you know you've come across\nthat's the bottom line and until we\nprotect ourselves and our resources I\nmean even giving to another in any\nversion of relationship whether or not\nwe are you know have had experiences and\nI speak from my own personal experience\nwith this as a codependent and meshed\nfamily right so even if I have that\nexperience of boundary blurring really\nprotecting that space but you're\nbringing up a good point because even\nthose who are very close to us you know\nand one the wood is well-intentioned\nfrom us come to expect us behaving\nshowing up or not showing up in a\nrelationship in a particular way right\njust logically thinking about our\nrelationships across time right we both\nparties become very predictable to each\nother so when we start to do different\nwe are already introducing unfamiliar to\nsomeone else there we're violating our\nexpectation so even if they do\nultimately want what is best for us\nthey're going to register our difference\nin some way you know because yes they're\nused to and you've now violated the\nexpectation you're always on the other\nend of that text why aren't you there\ntoday\nare you okay so that's natural and I\nthink to speak to your point a lot of us\nfear or imagine so many million\nscenarios I know I did about what would\nhappen if I did start to say no or take\nspace for myself in these relationships\nand ultimately like you sent the\nrealization that those of those who are\nin our worlds who are close to us and\nlove us and support us and want what's\nbest for us even if they might get\nshocked or thrown by the initial\nshifting and having boundaries into\nexperiencing ourselves differently\nultimately the end result of that you\nknow is accepted\nis not all the things we imagine and\nfear that not domestic lies to all\nrelationships because I don't know maybe\nsome of us out there I know I had very\nconditional relationships meaning when I\nstopped showing up in that way that\nperson did not love me and you know\naccept me in unconditionally so I did\nhave to drift from those relationships\nmore fully and I think that\nreorganization that happens at like I\nsaid opens us up so much more and I can\nbe honest and say that will ultimately\nbenefit the relationship itself even\nmore right so if you can feel like I can\ngive when I'm Abed it's available to me\nI can say no when it's not and all of\nthis is accepted in a relationship now I\ncan fully accept and appreciate I think\nthe other person in this new more\nexpansive way yeah absolutely and then\nyou and then you touched on it again but\nwhen you spoke about you know a creating\nplace of learning that comes from like\ncompletely using it you talked about it\nbeing very anxiety fear-based and same\nwith now like when you stop you know\nshowing up for people because you need\nto care for self that fear you have like\nwhat happens particularly in the context\nof conditional relationships that yeah\nto me you know fear for me is the\nunderlying like you know everyone has\ntheir own sort of like anger iceberg\nwhatever it is but for me it was always\nfear-based\nmasking as something else or whatever it\nwas and so yeah like for me I just I\njust kind of pushed through it and\nthat's really has been my experience is\nthat when I just let myself whether it's\nfeel all the feels put through my worst\ncase scenario of what I was worried\nabout what happened even if it does\nhappen you realize oh it happened I'm\nstill here\nit's okay or it doesn't happen you\nrealize like you know real or imagined\nfears fear but you realize like ah so\nthat was in my head you know kind of\nthing whatever the outcome the staying\non this side of fear where you're not\nit's still up here and you haven't\nacknowledged either that it was\nor that it was real but you're still\nokay on the other end of it keeps you\nvery stuff right I completely agree and\nthat goes back to what I referenced\nearlier in terms of top showing\nourselves how much we can tolerate and I\nagree with you the biggest pivot for me\nyou know in terms of healing my own\nanxiety I had tools I knew mindfulness\nlike I got it I knew where it came from\nlogically I knew right I got I got I got\nit but until like I said I know I\ninternalized that I could tolerate even\nthe worst case scenario that it was not\nimagined that did happen right and I\ncame off the other side of it even so to\nbring this in terms of the relationship\nconversation even if it was a terrible\nreaction that I got from someone and I\ndid you know that the relationship did\nsuffer in some way or maybe even lost\nthe relationships not to say that\ngrieving isn't painful and loss doesn't\nhurt absolutely but again instead of\nwalking up the other side and showing\nyou that even if the imagined was not\nimagined that I Finn tolerates so so so\nmuch more so I think that really\nsensible 22 for everyone out there\nconsidering because I did a YouTube\nvideo on boundaries and I always\nacknowledge there's three steps right\nthere's sitting with ourselves let's tie\nthis all together right taking the\nmoment alone with ourselves to realize\nwhat we need to even identify the fact\nthat okay I do I do need to put some\nboundaries in my world right so now I've\nstated it to myself honestly then I have\nto state it to the world either directly\nor behaviorally right to these\nrelationships and then I have to\nmaintain you know those down because I\nthink that's another critical place\nwhere a lot of us struggle a lot of us\ntend to engage in some version of a feel\nbad when that kickback which is very\nnatural like I said earlier violation of\nexpectation we might hear about it and\nfrom direct indirect ways but if I'm\nable to stand firm in my boundary I\nthink that that can go such such a long\nway for not only pretty speak ourselves\nto heal and that's the reality a lot of\npeople I think are going to share your\nexperience of healing I know I did in\nthe beginning there was a big drive of\nme to be separate from right there I\nfelt so overwhelmed\nso many ways not only with all the new\nstuff I was doing the heal but with all\nof the realizations I was having all of\nthe emotions that got wrapped up in in\nand I need it if I'm honest distance\nfrom people in a very real way you know\nso I needed my own individual space\nespecially and I say this I know there's\na lot of healers out there that are at\nthe beginning of the journey and might\nbe feeling similarly this is a floor\neven the world my world has reacted to\nme right so I just felt like I need a\nlittle bit of time you know and then\nonce I started to or once when people\nstarted to notice I needed a little bit\nof time or experience me differently\nright then maybe that negative feedback\nso I think there's multiple stages of\nthis in healing then that feedback\nstarts to come in and that's what I\nthink it's really critical to make sure\nthat we're protecting our space and our\nenergy so yeah I would say that most of\nmy awakenings have been following or\ncoinciding with periods of Solitude yeah\nfor sure like I had my most recent one\nwas over Christmas and I got a new phone\nand I just didn't load any of my social\napps right and I just didn't use my\nphone for a week and it was great and it\nwas funny because I was leading my phone\nat like well like I always know where my\nphone is but that's why I emphasized so\nmuch with you when you lost your phone\nbut um but yeah over Christmas I just\nspent time reading books I just spent\ntime with my you knows with my family\nbut I eat that time for myself and she\nhad that's so that's what I would say\nyou know if anyone asked me how to start\nself-care just say start start being\nbeing by yourself you know whatever that\nlooks like start small if you can reduce\nthe distractions noise of people of\nmedia like unclog then you'll start it's\nfeels really weird feels uncomfortable\nyou start to feel self-conscious but\nthen it feels really really good and\nthen you actually like I thought it was\nan extrovert my whole life and I realize\nI'm actually just I'm really I'm an int\nor I'm social interact like but I get I\nget re-energized by solitude that's\nwhere I find my Center so yeah so that's\nwhat I'm saying for me the most\nimportant part of self-care is just\nwhatever you do you know see if you can\ndo it by yourself\nfind comfort um and be by yourself yeah\nI love that I think that's a beautiful\nplace and because I think a lot of times\nmany listening could probably relate to\na lot of what we're talking about and\nthen the great question I always get is\nhow to start and I think that's\nbeautiful and I love that distinction\nthat you offered so it's one thing to be\nalone and be tethered to my cellphone on\nsocial media there's been how alone am I\nand we don't you don't even have to\nstart with anything crazy don't you have\nto carve out a day or a weekend or go\ntribal alone literally like I said\nearlier a trip to the coffee shop where\nyou're just with yourself or your\nthoughts and you're right expect it to\nbe overwhelming expect it to be\nuncomfortable don't expect it to be for\ntwo reasons\na the sheer unfamiliarity of it we're\ndoing something new you're going to be\nuncomfortable and self-conscious and\nthen be you're finally distraction free\nwhich means and this is why I'm entirely\na meditation practice with people a lot\nof people in the beginning was like well\nthis is too overwhelming I can I'm\nuncomfortable on fidgety I'm crazy you\nknow go crazy and that's it because it\nyou're now with yourself but I think\nthat's a great great kind of first step\nhow to just carve out some time any time\nget to know yourself ultimately what the\ndeepest part of that process is learning\nwhat you need what makes you feel good\nwhat doesn't make you feel good and then\nthen you get to that boundary\nconversation with yourself then you\nstart to ask yourself okay how am I\nfeeling in my relationships and really\nbeing brutally honest and identifying\nwhen they don't feel good that there is\na role we're playing and that there is\nsomething you can shift or do\ndifferently and one of the biggest tools\nto do that is to carve out space and we\ndo that with the boundaries so Teresa\nthank you this was incredible so much\nwisdom I am so grateful that you\nliterally became part of the community I\ndon't know how long though now and\nyou're always buzzing in those comments\nand I just knew something and I so\nappreciate you coming on here and\nsharing your story and I just I know\nthat so many people are gonna get value\nfor this and I know that our time\ntogether this will not be the first and\nthe last because you're auditioning so I\nhope you take moments to feel proud of\nyourself this is this is this is really\ncool so thank you for sharing this with\neveryone"
