    "transcript": "today I want to explain to you guys a\nsimple way that the mind and the body\nare connected specifically around\nemotion so what happens is we have a\nthought our subconscious assigns a\nmeaning to that thought we then have an\nemotion and what an emotion means is\nthere's a response actual response in\nthe body it can be our nervous system\nresponse such as us going into\nfight-or-flight mode it can be a\nneurotransmitter response so we start to\nrelease adrenaline or epinephrine\nserotonin things like that which very\nmuch directly affect our mood affect the\nway our body's physiology is or we start\nto have an immune response so I'm going\nto use an example to illustrate this I\ncome home and there's a sink full of\ndirty dishes so my thought is I wish the\nsink wasn't full of dirty dishes whether\nI'm not whether I'm aware of it or not\nmy subconscious possibly assigns a\nmeaning that my partner who was\nresponsible for some of the dirty dishes\ndoesn't care about me right so I then as\na result of this meaning so if I sink\nbut an x-ray if I think someone doesn't\ncare about me I might feel uncared-for\nnot considered not loved I might feel\nfrustrated angry irate any a million\ndifferent things right so then I\ntypically react to that you know maybe I\nyell or a screaming right store never\nwe're going to cry you know whatever my\nresponse to any of those are my reaction\nI should say any of those emotions might\nbe so illustrating that really shows how\nmy thought wow this desert in the same\nmy subconsciously assigned meaning I am\nthis is an indicator of me not being\ncared for my partner does not consider\nme that is what is producing the emotion\nnow that I have been the emotional the\nemotion part of this chain of events now\nI've really affected my body so say I'm\nangry right because I'm not cared for\nand consider now again I have all of the\nchemicals possibly gum in fire flights\nyou know mode\nI'm hyper vigilant heart is racing maybe\nI'm yelling now I've actually affected\nmy body so this is a really simple and\nthis applies to everything and when we\nlook at it this way I think it's clear\nin some extent these to me it is that\nit's not really our thoughts that are\ncausing this right and all this or our\nnervousness governor they're not really\nit's not our thoughts that are affecting\nour physiology per se it's these\nmeanings and like I said where these\nmeanings come from they come from our\nsubconscious and those of you who follow\nme now I talk a lot a lot a lot about\nthe subconscious because the\nsubconscious contains all of the\naccumulation of all of our past\nexperiences from the entire time we've\nbeen on this planet right so this is why\nwe are often seeing the reactions that\nwe're seeing ourselves right we've kind\nof imprinted these meanings from an\naccumulation of life experiences that\nI'm now carrying to that dirty sink of\ndirty dishes and that is what is causing\nme to have that reaction so what do we\ndo we there are three really really\ngreat techniques that we can start to\nkind of utilize this connection between\nthe mind and the body to heal right to\nstart to unpack some of this because\nthinking about it this way right now\ncause it and on alert response in my\nbody right I can just as easily start to\ndown-regulate and teach myself through\nmy mind and the connection through my\nmind and my body to bring myself down\ninto a more balanced overall system\nearly so a great technique is something\nthat's called the emotional freedom\ntechnique I have a video that I just put\ntogether so I will link that you guys\ncan take a look at how to start\npracticing this EFT I also those of you\nwho follow me on Instagram I actually\nintro breathwork video as well breath\nwere hugely helpful especially for this\nthe nervous system our breath gives us\ndirect access and control over our\nnervous system it helps us go from that\nby your flight system to that restful\nsystem bringing again all of the\nhormones right all of the body kind of\nshifting us all physiologically into a\nbalanced place another great one is yoga\nyoga again works with the breath it\nworks with movement again we're\nconnecting our mind and our body anytime\nwe do that a lot of the movements and\nbreath work in yoga again it's relaxing\nis tapping into that opposite of that\nfight-or-flight nervous system hugely\nhugely helpful there's a million\ndifferent resources out there whether or\nnot at your local yoga studio online is\na great great resource personally I got\ninto yoga and now use a utilize it daily\nalmost doing a 30 day challenge there\nare some great yoga teachers out there\nthat do very specific you know kind of\nget started in yoga a great one that I\nwant to shout out because she really\nhelped me develop a yoga practice is\nyoga with Adriene so I can link her\nchannel below that's helpful to you guys\nbut again a little small way it doesn't\nhave to be an hour-long yoga class\nanytime you're just moving stretching\neven as a form of yoga and focusing on\nyour breath what you're doing is you're\nconnecting your mind and your body so I\nwould love to hear in the comments\nanyone who's tried any of these let me\nknow how that goes you know really\ntrying to connect those two things in a\nhealing in a balancing way is really\ngoing to help us to unlearn these\npatterns that are really really\nproblematic because like I said our\nthoughts have a direct connection\nthe way our bodies are functioning\nthanks for tuning in if you guys like\nwhat you heard today please subscribe to\nmy channel turn on the vacations and you\nwill find out when a new video comes out\nand I look at 14 guys next time"
