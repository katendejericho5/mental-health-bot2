    "transcript": "hi everyone so I'm dr. Nicole a pair of\nthe holistic psychologist thank you for\ncoming by this YouTube video if you are\ninterested please hit subscribe and if\nyou would like to get an alert each time\nI release a new video please hit the\nbell below so this video is going to be\non b12 and brain functioning or its\nimportance for mental wellness so what\nb12 has a role in actually is the\nfunction and development of brain cells\nand the synthesis of myelin so what\nmyelin essentially is it's a fatty\nsubstance that covers our nerves is\nreally important for normal motor\nfunctioning so any movement that we're\ndoing walking running anything that's\nsensory so literally hearing smelling\nseeing we definitely need our myelin to\nbe intact to be functioning normally and\nalso for cognition are literally\nthinking so learning acquiring knowledge\nand retaining knowledge huge importance\nthat myelin has so clearly right this\nthing is pretty important we need to\nmake sure that our b12 is at normal\nlevels so the reality though is about\n40% of Americans have a deficiency in\nb12 is hugely problematic the elderly\nhave a particular issue with absorbing\nb12 so as you're getting up in age it's\nreally important to make sure that\nyou're getting your b12 from somewhere\nresearch shows that there's a\ncorrelation between neurodegenerative so\nthat's Alzheimer's\nthat's dementia and psychiatric\ndisorders so that's depression anxiety\neven schizophrenia so correlation\nessentially means as our b12 levels drop\nwe have an increased chance altima t at\nhaving any of those symptoms diabetes\ndisease whatever we want to call them so\nremembering that Alzheimer's the\ndementia the depression the anxiety and\nthe schizophrenia so this is a really\nproblematic a lot of humans are walking\naround you know struggling in those ways\npossibly because their b12 levels are\nlow so we study from Oxford\nthis has been studied a lot but one\nparticular one from Oxford University\nfound that as b12 levels rose so did Bri\nfunctioning so our brains are more\nefficient they got they got better and\nwhat reduced was atrophy and essentially\nwhat atrophy is is brain shrinkage right\nso what happens over time especially if\nwe're not getting or eating nutrient\nrich rich diets is our brains can shrink\nright if we think about it because this\nis so involved in Mindlin and cell\ndevelopment as I said earlier make sense\nif we're not getting the b12 and if our\ncells aren't developing then our brains\nare shrinking so big big problem so what\nare signs some of you might be sitting\nthere thinking oh my gosh I have these\nsigns I know I personally did weakness\ndizziness tingling a lot of times in the\nextremities and shortness of breath so\nif you are struggling with any of these\nthings you might want to take a look at\nyour b12 levels so where do we get b12\nthe big five places that we get b12 are\norgan meats fish beef in particular\nshellfish and poultry organ meats are a\nhuge powerhouse of b12 they literally\nhave the highest levels so I know that\nnot everyone can solve it stomach we're\ngonna meats eating them naturally in\ntheir form and I know that there's\nprobably some vegans and vegetarians out\nthere that you know are not eating meat\nor animal products in general so there\nis supplementation if you are going to\nget a b12 supplement you want to make\nsure that it is methylcobalamin that is\none essentially that's really important\nbecause it makes that that b12 much more\nbioavailable now as those of you who\nknow my work and follow me will know my\nstick with supplementation is\nsupplements are only as good as our gut\nis healthy so whether or not you're the\nvegan\nvegetarian just want to make sure your\nmaybe having some of these symptoms or\nyou want it you know make sure that you\nhave enough b12 making sure that we're\nhealing our guts first so so incredibly\nimportant because if our guts aren't\nhealed not only our body's not going to\nbe absorbing the nutrients that were\neating but it's also not going to absorb\nthose supplements so huge importance\nheal those guts anyone who has followed\nme know that I released a gut guide\neveryone who has not been following me\nif you want to head over to my website\nat your holistic psychologist comm I\nhave an email list you can sign on you\ncan get my free guide healing guide\nmaking sure that your gut is filled so\nthat you can start to absorb these\nsupplements so I hope you guys found\nthis helpful\nb12 like I said a huge huge importance\nsome of you out there might be having\nthe depressions the anxiety symptoms\nbecause you don't have enough b12 so you\nknow so a lot of you out there you know\nor some of you out there might be having\ndepression symptoms anxiety symptoms you\nknow weaknesses dizziness --is that\nmight be the result of b12 it might not\nactually be you know a depression or\nanxiety at all so definitely you know\nkind of take a look at what your diets\nlook like make sure that you're able to\nget your b12 in get some supplementation\nif you're not make sure your guts are\nhealed so I hope you guys found this\nvideo helpful like I said earlier if you\nhave please hit subscribe please hit the\nbell for notifications I would love to\nsee you guys back here"
