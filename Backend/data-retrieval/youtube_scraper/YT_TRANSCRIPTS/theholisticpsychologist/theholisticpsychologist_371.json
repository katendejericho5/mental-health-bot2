    "transcript": "this video is on a body scan meditation\nso first I'm going to talk a little bit\nabout what it is why it's important and\nthen I'm going to give you the tools to\ndo it so the reality is a lot of us\nspend way too much time if not all of\nour time in our thinking mind what the\nbody skin does is it literally allows us\nto practice connecting with our bodies\nso incredibly important as you those who\nfollow me know I'm always going on and\non about how problematic sometimes our\nthoughts can be the stories that we're\ntelling ourselves but really think about\nit when we're in our mind we're\ndisconnected from our body we're\ndisconnected from the current moment so\nthis is a really helpful tool to start\nto literally practice connecting with\nour bodies and I say this because\nliterally we have to practice it we\ndon't do this naturally more often than\nnot we're in that thinking mind so the\nreality is emotions live in our bodies\nand a lot of times they use all in\ntension in our stomach you know kind of\nthat butterfly feeling I know for me I\nput a lot of tension in my shoulders\nso emotions can be a really physical\nexperience for a lot of us emotions can\nbe a really physical experience and a\nlot of us carry stress in our body if\nyou might feel tension in our shoulders\nknots in our stomachs or shallow\nbreathing sometimes we feel these things\nphysically and you don't know that these\nare might be connected to our emotions\nso what breath work again allows us to\ndo is connect with our bodies but also\nmake those connections when we're having\nthose feelings in our body maybe they\nare also connected to our emotions it's\nimportant to learn to identify when our\nphysical symptoms are connected to our\nemotions but also give us the tools to\nbe able to tolerate them a lot of us as\nwe do a lot of things we tend to avoid\nthem so practicing this this body scan\ntechnique literally will help you to be\nable to sit with these physical\ndiscomforts again whether it's at\nor you know the tightness whatever it\nmight be but also sit with the emotional\nfeelings that come up as well this body\nscan will help you to identify what\nyou're feeling we're feeling it in your\nbody\nand then also give you the tools to\nrelease it so how do we do a body scan\nwhat you'll like to do is do so lay down\non obviously sitting but laying down is\nreally helpful so find a comfortable\nplace to lay in your bed the only thing\nwith this is this is not a relaxation\ntechnique this is not necessarily to put\nyou to bed so try not to do so you know\ndoing it before bed but not with the\nintention to go to sleep so find a\ncomfortable place to lay down I'm going\nto take you through one sitting here but\nI'm going to explain it first so you'll\nbe laying and I want you to allow your\nbreath just to slow naturally as you do\nturn your attention to your breath\nfeeling your abdomen right putting a\nhand on your stomach and a hand on your\nchest as I always talk about that belly\nbreath is what we're looking for just\nallow your breathing to slow so it'll\nlook like that now as you're laying\nthere you can start I would say start at\nthe top of your head focus your\nattention at the top of your head feel\nwhat it is feels like are you feeling\nanything do you have a headache you know\ngo down at your temples do you feel some\ntension there do you feel any pain so\nonce you've got yourself laying\ncomfortably and your breath is you know\nat a natural rhythm I want you to what\nI'm going to show you is an abbreviated\nversion so you can get really specific\nwith this you'll see what I mean but I'm\ngoing to take you through a really\ngeneral later practices so I'm laying\ndown my breath is flowing naturally I'm\npaying attention to my breath this is a\nreally big important part of it because\nwhat's going to happen as it always does\nour thoughts are going to come this is\nwhere we really have that chance to\nstart to flex that attentional muscle I\ncall it away from our thoughts letting\nthem just drift by us and on to what\nwe're doing so\nright now we're just having that value\nbreath all right so we can start at the\ntop of our head remember I'm going to\nshow you generally how to do this and\nthen I'll tell you later how you can get\nreally specific if you want so starting\nat the top of our head I'm gonna start\nwith my head first as I'm breathing I'm\ngoing to turn my attention to my head\ndo I feel tension do I feel a headache\nam i pulsing at my temples am I starting\nto go travel down my neck I know me when\nI'm stressed I have an attention that\nstarts right here at the base of my\nskull\nso what I'm gonna do is literally feel\nmy body I'm breathing I'm paying\nattention putting all of my attention on\nmy head and I'm feeling what it feels\nlike to be in my head right now if as I\nsaid earlier as I travel down my head if\nI do feel a spot of tension literally\njust practice breathing into it so I'm\nbreathing into the tension that might be\nin my in my temples I'm breathing in the\ntension that might be in my neck I'm not\nrunning away from it this is what I was\nsaying earlier right I'm not I'm not\nlabeling it I'm just being with that\nexperience whether it's pain whether\nit's tightness whatever it is I'm\nbreathing into it then I'm moving down\nI'm feeling my shoulders again another\nplace where I know I carry tension what\ndoes this feel like today today I feel\nsome tension back up here in my you know\nbehind my shoulders what does that\ntension feel like how tight is it again\nI'm focusing just breathing into that\nnot labeling it not running away from it\nyou can do this as slow as you want\nmaking sure that you're really taking\nthe care to learn your body right now\nI'm going down feeling my belly my\nabdomen as I breathe anything going on\nin there down to my legs I did a leg\nworkout today so I\nbe feeling some tension you know in my\nin my quads are my hamstrings and then\nall the way down to my feet now like I\nsaid earlier that's a very general\noverview of how to do this you can get\nreally specific literally pop up your\nhead tip of your ears tip of your nose\nand again this might sound silly but\nwhat we're working on here is two things\nwe're working on connecting with our\nbody we're working on experiencing the\nfeelings in our body and experiencing\nthem not running through them breathing\ninto them this is incredibly helpful\nthis is a practice that we should do\nconsistently you who have tried this\nbefore or who are going to try this in\nthe comments let me know what you think\nand if you liked it please feel free to\nsubscribe to my channel the holistic\npsychologist and turn
