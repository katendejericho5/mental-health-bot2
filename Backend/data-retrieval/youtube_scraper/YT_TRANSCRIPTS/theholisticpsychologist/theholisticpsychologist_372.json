    "video_title": "the subconscious vs. the conscious mind",
    "transcript": "this video is on the difference between\nthe conscious mind the subconscious mind\nwhy the conscious mind is so important\nand how do we tap into it so the\nconscious mind the conscious mind is\nactive 5% of our debt which isn't that\nmuch essentially what it is is our nail\nmoments it's being aware of what's\nhappening right here right now\nthe subconscious mind obviously if the\nconscious mind is operating at 5% the\nsubconscious mind is operating 95% of\nthe time that means that 95% of the time\nwe are not being presently aware and we\nare running on what I like to call\nautopilot a great example of this that\nI'm sure a lot of you have either heard\nof her experienced is I'm walking home\nI'm getting out of my car I'm putting my\nkeys in the door I drove home but I\ndon't remember my drive home who drove\nthe car my autopilot my subconscious\nmind I'm alive so thankfully it's very\ngood at driving but I wasn't present\nlike I said I didn't see the streets go\nby I didn't see the cars on the road I\nwas somewhere else probably lost in my\nthoughts so fact the conscious mind is\nalso responsible for our logic and our\nreasoning it's what we typically think\nof when we think right when we are\nworking through problems in a very\nlogical way subconscious mind is\ndominated by emotion so when we are not\nbeing logical our thinking brain and our\nfeeling brain are not matching our\nemotional brain is actually a separate\nolder part of our brain I'm going like\nthis because it's actually down here in\nthe back part our heads our brains some\nof you might have heard the reptilian\nbrain the mammalian brain those are\nparts of our brain the reptilian brain\nis very evolutionarily based it's\nresponsible for our fight like fight\nflight or freeze response our mammalian\nbrain is responsible for our emotional\ncenter\nour limbic systems so when that is\nrunning and I'm sure we can all remember\na time in a place where you know usually\narguments are emblematic of this or are\nan indicator of us being in that\nemotional blink brain we're coming\nbecoming reactive we're becoming\nemotional and you know it's not on line\nor logic or our reason so that's that\nlevel of difference our conscious mind\nis where we can access a conscious\nchoice that is so incredibly important\nliterally each moment that we live we\ncan make a choice doesn't always feel\nthat way why because of our subconscious\nmind and our programming I'm always\ncalling it our narratives this comes\nusually from childhood really it comes\nfrom an accumulation of our life\nexperiences\nwhen we come to this planet and however\nyou think it is that we get here we\nliterally don't know how to be a human\nour brain is just soaking in all of this\ninformation for how we work our bodies\nfor how to be in relationships for what\nthings mean in the world we are learning\nall of this because it's so much\ninformation our brain is an organ does a\ncouple things\nit categorizes it it finds patterns in\nit it makes meanings and narratives\nthat's how we can understand it the\nproblem is it's like I said this starts\nso early it starts in our early\ncaregiving environment it happens across\nour life but a lot of our messages are\nlaid down at a time and a place where we\ndon't have much control the problem\nbecomes when we grow older and our life\nphysically looks different maybe we are\nliving in a different part of the world\nwe are having relationships with\ndifferent people yet we still find\nourselves engaging in those old patterns\nthat's because we're really tapped into\nthose programs that are so so so old\nokay\nhey because we have tools and that's why\naccessing this conscious mind and\nchoosing to be in that 5% more than 5%\nof the time gives us control it gives us\nchoice it gives us choice around the\nthoughts we think the feelings we have\nand the behaviors we make ultimately\nthis is how change happens we learn and\nwe can learn we develop the ability to\naccess that 5% more of the time how do\nwe do it through mindfulness and through\nmeditation so hugely important for two\nreasons again being mindfully present in\nour given moment means that we're in\nthat conscious brain it means that I\nhave a choice so let me access awareness\nlet me show up to my moment let me not\nbe in my thoughts let me not be in\nyesterday now let me not be worrying\nabout tomorrow right here right now\ngives me choice so working on that\nawareness another huge skill that\npracticing meditation and mindfulness\nhelps us to develop is what I like to\ncall our attentional muscle we have two\nforms of attention a great way to\nunderstand it is literally like the\nlights in a room so the overhead lights\nthat's a form of hovering attention I do\nnot have control over that meaning if\nthere were to be a crash outside my\nwindow right now or an alarm would go\noff I would hear it though I'm not even\ntrying to be paying attention to that\nright now I would hear it it's again it\nkeeps me safe from threat that's always\nthere hovering above and then I have\nwhat I like to call my spotlight of\nattention this is my spotlight that is\nwhere I'm putting my attention so right\nnow my spotlight of attention is on all\nof you I have now been paying attention\nby choice this is the one I have control\nover so when you develop a mindfulness\nand\nAsian practice not only are you more\nable to show up and be aware of your\ncurrent moment which allows you new\nchoices from those old thoughts those\nold feelings and those old behaviors\nwhich are usually getting you more of\nthe same but you can also start to tone\nthis muscle meaning I get to decide\nwhere I put my attention this is again\nthe autopilot example I'm driving home\nmy spotlight was in my mind not on the\nroad possibly a safety concern even more\nso how many of us I know myself I read a\nbook right I get to the bottom of that\nthat one page I have no idea where I\nread what I read why because my\nspotlight was somewhere else so\npracticing this skill allows us to tone\nthat muscle it is not something that is\neasy and is not something that\nnecessarily comes naturally but the more\nwe do it the better we get so how do we\npractice mindfulness one of two ways we\ndo what most of us think of we think of\nmeditation we go we sit somewhere\nsilently you know we tune our attention\nto our breath we just focus on our\nbreath what happens our thoughts come\nhere is where we get to flex that muscle\nso instead of attaching to the thought\njumping down the rabbit hole of the\nthought and a lot of us do myself\ninclude it we work on bringing our\nattention back to our breath again and\nagain and again because that's the thing\nall right once we bring our attention\nback our thoughts still come but like I\nsaid this is a practice I know it can be\nfrustrating at first but we can get\nreally good at this if we work at it\nanother way that we use this mindfulness\nor met\nAsian is daily in our lives our senses\nso what we're seeing what we're hearing\nwhat we're smelling are hugely helpful\nwhy because they can only work in our\ngiven moment\nright so I usually give this suggestion\nI use it myself when I'm eating\nthat's very sensory based I'm tasting my\nfood for me cooking is to whenever I'm\ndoing something that I can taste like\neating put the phone away\nit's what buy ten minutes to eat and\nfeel and taste your food that will help\nyou ground yourself in the present\nmoment same thing with music with sounds\nright when you're listening you are here\nyou are here now being able to meditate\nin that closed room hugely helpful very\nimportant it allows us to develop this\nmuscle being able to be mindfully\npresent in the world even more important\nwe have to learn how to do both because\nwhen we are mindfully present and\nconscious and have choice in our given\nmoments is where we get to choose a new\nbehavior we get to work on those old\nhabits those narratives and we get to\ncreate who it is we want to be now so\nempowering so important so for those of\nyou out there who have meditated who\nhave practiced mindfulness let me know\nin the comments how helpful it's been to\nyou and for those of you who might be\ntrying it now for the first time let me\nknow how it goes you guys like this\nvideo please hit subscribe and if you'd\nlike to be alerted when my next video\ncomes out please hit the bell thank you\nso much"
