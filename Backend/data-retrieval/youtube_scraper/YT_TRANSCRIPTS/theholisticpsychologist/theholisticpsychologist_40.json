    "transcript": "I'm a parent who raised my child with\nsecure attachment how'd you do it well I\nwas attuned to your emotional needs most\nof the time I listened when you were\nupset instead of telling you to stop it\nand I taught you how to breathe through\nintense emotions I didn't coddle you\nbecause I was confident in your own\nresilience and most importantly I was\npredictable my words match my behavior\nit's true I never had to walk on\neggshells or guess what you were feeling\nI knew you were capable and that helped\nme become capable exactly I understood\nmy role as a parent was to work on\nmyself and to heal my own trauma I also\nknew that you needed to grow into your\nown unique person not who I wanted you\nto be so I gave you space to do that I\nwasn't perfect at all and I messed up\nplenty of times but I always apologize\nand I owned my behavior you really did\nand it's helped me so much in\nrelationships because now when I make a\nmistake I'm not drowning in shame I\nunderstand that it's okay to not be\nperfect and I apologize and move on I\nknow how to meet my needs and how to ask\nfor help when I need it"
