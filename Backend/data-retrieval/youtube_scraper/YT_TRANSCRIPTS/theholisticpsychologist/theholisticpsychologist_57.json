    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about how to\nheal the mother wound if you don't know\nwhat the mother wound is you can check\nout my previous content on the mother\nwound that I'll link in the description\nbelow so there are five steps to Healing\nthe mother wound and I'm going to go\nthrough each of them with us now the\nfirst step you're going to want to vent\nit out this is as simple as grabbing a\npen or a pencil and somewhere private\nthat you can write in like a notebook or\na journal and you're going to let\nyourself freely write down everything\nthat happened how you felt in your\nrelationship with your mother now make\nsure this is something that you can keep\nprivate so that no one else is going to\nread it so that you can feel free to\nfreely write your experience without\ncensoring yourself allow yourself to\nexplore you want to write down maybe\nwhat you wish you had from your mother\nhow you wish she made you feel when\nyou're around her maybe you felt unseen\nmaybe you felt\nunheard and because a lot of you have\nprobably never looked at these things\nbefore even thinking about this or\nwriting it down might be uncomfortable\nso be patient and be kind to yourself\nand take breaks if you need it the\nsecond step to Healing the mother wound\nis you're going to want to get to know\nyour own\nneeds most of us have a pattern of\nignoring or denying our own needs\nbecause we had a parent that wasn't\nattuned to us or our needs we might have\nbeen left alone a lot or maybe our\nissues were ignored or they were\ndownplayed teaching us that our needs\ndon't matter a lot of us don't even know\nwhat our needs are and that is totally\nokay so now we're going to get in touch\nwith what our needs are through\nsomething called a self checkin and what\na self checkin is is starting with one\ntime a day you're simply going to check\nin with yourself and you're going to\nnotice how you feel in your body you're\ngoing to notice what you're thinking and\nyou're going to ask yourself if there's\nanything you need in that moment and now\nthis can be as simple as needing a glass\nof water because you're thirsty or a\nquick bite because you're hungry or\nmaybe you just need to pause for a\nminute or two to let yourself calm down\nthis is really just the process of\nlearning what's going on inside of you\nso that you can Empower yourself to\nbegin to meet your needs the third step\nof healing the mother wound is asking\nfor help or support this goes right\nalong with meeting your needs because\nsometimes we have a need that we can't\nmeet oursel we might be feeling down and\nwe want someone just to listen to us or\nwe might need help around the house or\nmaybe we're confused about something and\nwe want someone else's input a lot of us\nfind that asking for help is really\nuncomfortable especially if we didn't\nget the help that we needed or if we\nwere shamed when we needed help growing\nup as a result we understandably end up\nfeeling like no one is actually there\nfor us asking for help or support can\nlook like say when we check in with\noursel say we discover that we have a\nlot of overwhelming emotions and we feel\ntired maybe we haven't been sleeping\nwell and we need a break we might then\nin that moment ask our roommate or maybe\nour partner if they can help us maybe\nthey can help clean up the kitchen or do\na small chore to help take something off\nof our plate it's these small moments\nthese small practices where we can teach\nourself how to ask for and receive the\nhelp or the support that we need the\nfourth step in healing the mother wound\nis processing your anger and\ngrieving this one can be really hard\nbecause it's really uncomfortable and\neven scary for a lot of us to admit that\nwe needed or wanted something that our\nmother was not able to give us sometimes\nwe even feel like in some way we're\nbetraying our mother for even\nacknowledging that we had needs that\nwent unmet and in reality it's\nabsolutely okay to feel upset it's okay\nto have won it different and it's okay\nto even be angry at the type of care\nthat we received the more we let those\nfeelings be there as they are and the\nthe more we validate those experiences\nthe more we're able to process the grief\nand anger that comes with our needs not\nbeing met practice allowing yourself to\nfeel these emotions without talking\nyourself out of them allowing yourself\nto be with the natural anger and grief\nthat you may feel the fifth step in\nhealing the mother wound is to become\nyour own best mother the be beautiful\npart of adulthood is that we have so\nmuch more choice now than when we were\nyoung When We Were Young how our mother\nbehaved or interacted with us had a\nprofound impact on us and we had no\nchoice but to live with it and to adapt\nto it and now as an adult we have the\ntools and the awareness to become the\nparent that we needed and wanted and\ndidn't get and this can start with\npaying attention to the way we speak to\nourselves instead of saying things like\nyou know I'm lazy that I sat around all\nday we can reframe that thought to\nacknowledge that maybe I sat around all\nday because I got the rest that I need\nit or maybe instead of saying I always\nforget things I'm an idiot we can start\nto remind oursel that I am doing the\nbest that I can in addition to talking\nto oursel more kindly we can also begin\nto take better care of ourselves making\nsure that we're getting enough sleep\nmaking sure that we're eating\nnutrient-dense Foods to the best of our\nability and making sure that we're\ngiving ourselves some downtime to do the\nthings that we love so these are the\nfive steps that you can begin to take to\nheal your mother wound and of course\nit's not easy but with practice these\nsteps will allow you to begin to create\na healthier relationship with yourself\nand ultimately with those around you I'd\nlove to hear from you if you practiced\nany of these steps let me know how it's\ngoing in the comments below"
