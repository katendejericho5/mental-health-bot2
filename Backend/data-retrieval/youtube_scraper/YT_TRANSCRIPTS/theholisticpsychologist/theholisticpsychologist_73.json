    "transcript": "I had emotionally unavailable parents so\nof course I'm hypervigilant and notice\nevery shift in your mood and tone how\nelse would I keep myself safe I had\nemotionally unavailable parents so when\nsomeone gives me a compliment I\nimmediately get awkward and make a\nself-deprecating joke I had emotionally\nunavailable parents so of course I'm\ngoing to compare myself to others and\nshame myself for not being good enough\nPerfection is the only way I think I'm\nworthy of being\nloved I had emotionally unavailable\nparents so when someone I love gives me\nemotional breadcrumbs I feel right at\nhome after all I've always had to work\nto be loved I had emotionally\nunavailable parents so when someone gets\ntoo close to me I sabotage the\nrelationship or leave them before they\ncan leave me I learned to think ahead"
