    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about\ncodependency we're going to explore what\nit is signs to know if you're struggling\nwith it and of course how to heal so\nwhat is codependency codependency is\nactually a relational pattern of using\nsomeone else outside of oursel to Define\nour emotional state sometimes even our\nidentity so what this means simply is\nusing someone else to tell us how to\nfeel what to do who to be and when we do\nthis we often get into a pattern what's\ncalled self- betrayal where we're doing\nthings without honoring our own needs\nand sometimes even overstepping our own\nlimits and as with most of these habits\ncodependency originates in our earliest\nenvironments really in our earliest\nrelationships where a few different\nthings could happen and really commonly\ntwo things that happen are either were\nmodeled codependency by our parent\nfigures we might have a parent figure\nwho's overprotective always overstepping\nour boundaries always trying trying to\noverare for us being really codependent\nwith us or they might model codependency\nwith someone else and they become\nneglectful or\nunderpronator not to do that or not to\nsay this or that maybe because we're\ntold Mom or Dad or whomever will feel a\ncertain way will get mad we'll\nyell essentially\nwhen we are not seen and heard and\nhonored and valued for the unique\nindividual that we are with different\nones with different needs we end up\nadapting and many of us even end up\nlearning to play roles in our\nrelationship roles where we can fit in\nwe learn how to show up and how to get\napproval in order to sustain whatever\nlove and whatever connection is possible\nbut when we're regularly told maybe\nwe're told to stop running because it\nmakes dad mad or maybe when we're crying\nwe're told that we're being too much we\nend up internalizing a belief that we're\nresponsible for someone else's emotions\nfor how they feel for what they think we\nend up learning that our joy can upset\nother people or that our crying and our\nemotions are\nundesirable and so naturally we end up\nslowly starting to disconnect from\nourselves and we end up becoming more\nattentive or hypervigilant to the people\naround us we're always worrying about it\nwe're upsetting someone some of us even\nend up going into a caretaker role where\nwe're always on the lookout for\nsomething anything anyone else could\nwant or need at the same time we're\nneglecting\nourselves and the end result is as I\nknow many of you know we become an adult\nwho doesn't know oursel who doesn't\nvalue oursel who doesn't even know what\nwe want or what we need and we end up\nover relying on other people to feel\ngood about ourselves we over rely on\nother people to give us advice we over\nrely on other people and we don't trust\nourselves so what are some signs that\nyou might be struggling with\ncodependency one sign is you struggle\nwith setting boundaries the boundaries\nwere blurred in childhood when we were\ngrowing up so as adults we struggle to\nput limits or boundaries within our\nrelationships usually because we worry\nor fear that we're going to upset other\npeople and so many of us have been\nconditioned to avoid upsetting other s\nthe second sign is we're controlling or\nhave micromanaging behaviors this looks\nlike telling people what to do\nsuggesting different ways that people\ncould solve their problems when they\nshare them with us and while it might\nfeel like we're helping them really\nunderneath we're offering the suggestion\nwe're controlling we're\nmicromanaging as a way to calm our own\nanxiety we are worried about other\npeople we can't control we can't\ntolerate how it is that we feel feel we\nfeel anxious and somewhere we believe\nthat if if we don't control them if we\ndon't solve the problem for them that we\nwon't be able to handle how we feel so\nwe jump into a controlling or\nmicromanaging role to tolerate our\ndistress another sign is you might be\nindecisive when we're disconnected from\noursel we look to everyone else to tell\nus what we should do and this can be as\nsimple as what we should have for dinner\nor what career path we should take I\nfind that a lot of people much like\nmyself that are codependent are big\nadvice Seekers calling asking everyone\nelse what they think about small things\nabout big things because we struggle to\nmake our own choices if we're not\nconnected to ourself we're not going to\nbe connected to the decision that's\nright for us so we're going to look\noutside of oursel and we're going to be\nindecisive another sign is we often feel\nlike we're on a roller coaster of\nsomeone else's emotions when some\nsomeone else is upset we become upset\nthe people around us control our\nemotional climate when they're up we're\nup when they're down we're down we can't\nremain emotionally separate we lack\nemotional boundaries we can't let\nsomeone else have their feeling while\nwe're having a separate feeling of our\nown so how do we heal\ncodependency we heal by self reclaiming\nby taking a spiritual journey of\ndiscovering who you are listening to\nyour own needs and learning to meet them\nnow of course there's a few steps to\nthis process but we can all start by\nsetting small clear boundaries by simply\nsaying no when we mean it letting people\nknow when we're uncomfortable as we\nbegin to better understand our own\nlimits our own emotional needs spending\ntime to discover ourselves what we want\nhow we feel will be probably\nuncomfortable for a lot of us especially\nif we haven't practiced tuning in into\nour self spending even more time then\nexploring our unique gifts following our\nCuriosities our interests and\ndiscovering what excites each of us\nfinding even new hobbies will be a new\nexperience that's so important we need\nto create separation so that we can\nexplore and\nreclaim who it is that we are not who it\nis that we think we have to be for\nsomeone else many of you I know like to\nexplore this through a journaling\npractice you could take some time\nwriting about what you're experiencing\nwhat you're thinking what you're sensing\nwhat you're feeling as you go along on\nthis journey I even wrote a workbook\nit's called how to meet yourself that\ntakes you on a stepbystep guide on how\nto explore yourself authentically in\nthis new way and as you all begin your\nself- reclaiming Journey remember to\nhave patience with yourself as you\nslowly break the cycle the conditioned\nhabit of codependency of focusing\neverything on someone else and how they\nfeel and what they need and as you begin\nto create the space to\nReDiscover\nyourselves I'd love to hear from you in\nthe comments do you like me struggle\nwith codependency and how has it\nimpacted your life"
