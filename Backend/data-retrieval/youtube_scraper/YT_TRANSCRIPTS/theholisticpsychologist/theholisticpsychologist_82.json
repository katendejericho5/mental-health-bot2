    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about listening\nlistening is one of the most important\nskills and many people just don't know\nhow to do it we end up getting\ndistracted or become loud and reactive\nespecially during difficult\nconversations listening is actually\nsomething that we have to practice to\nget good at it's not natural So today\nwe're going to talk about how to become\nan active listener when you're an active\nlistener what you're doing simply is\nquieting yourself so that you can give\nyour full focus and attention\nto the other person and to what they're\nsharing this type of listening allows us\nto create deeper and more authentic\nConnections in our relationships when\nyou're truly listening to someone it's\nlike you're saying to them I respect you\nI respect your perspectives and I\nrespect what you feel so here are five\nsteps for how to listen step one don't\nhook into every thought when someone's\ntalking you're going to have a lot of\nthoughts running through your mind and\nprobably a lot of impulse to speak those\nthoughts don't do it practice pausing\njust breathing so you can stay as\npresent as possible to the words the\nperson is saying most of us end up\ngetting distracted by our own thoughts\nand not listen at all to what they're\nsaying so have patience this practice\ntakes a long time the second step is\npractice asking questions not making\nstatements sometimes we think we're\ndemonstrating that we're actively\nlistening or we're trying to connect\nwith other people when we paraphrase\nback what we think they said and when we\ndo this we usually end up\nmisinterpreting it and then they end up\nfeeling even more invalidated so we can\neither repeat back directly what it is\nthat they said not adding our own words\ninto it or a better bet to create more\nconnection is asking them questions\nespecially if they share something that\nwe're not certain about we're unsure we\ndidn't know what they meant it can be as\nsimple as us saying what did you mean\nwhen you said X this will allow the\nother person person to express\nthemselves exactly as they thought as\nthey're feeling so that they can feel\nheard they won't feel invalidated by\nwhat we paraphrase back to them the\nthird step is practice not trying to fix\neverything a lot of times when we feel\nuncomfortable or anxious we jump in\nimmediately we try to fix the problem we\ndo so from a very well-meaning\nperspective we want to relieve the\ndiscomfort especially if it's someone\nthat we love that's suffering in any way\nand in reality most people when they're\ntalking to us when they're sh Shing\nsomething especially something difficult\nthey aren't looking for a solution they\nare just looking for someone to be\npresent to them in what they're sharing\nand the emotion that they're\nexperiencing the best way to support\nsomeone in those moments especially when\nthey're sharing something upsetting or\nstressful is to Simply sit with them be\npresent in whatever emotion or\nexperience that they're sharing with you\nif they say they're feeling scared you\ncan reflect back it does sound scary or\nif they're being feeling uncertain you\ncan reflect back wow there is a lot of\nuncertainty right now this will help\nthem feel heard in exactly what they\nshared instead of Feeling invalidated by\nhow you tried to paraphrase what it is\nthe fourth step is to remind yourself\nthat you are not in court active\nlistening means that you're simply\nlistening you're truly listening you're\nnot creating your case you're not\nwaiting for your time to respond or\nreact or retort or one up or win the\nargument and a lot of times when we hear\nsomething upsetting we get lost in our\nown heads we create a counterargument we\ndisagree with them or we try to explain\nourselves internally becoming only more\ndistracted from the conversation we\ncreate tension in our bodies we create\ndistance from what we're hearing and the\nperson speaking feels it so anytime we\nnotice oursel going down that Court\ncreation trying to be a lawyer in our\nminds hitting that pause removing that\nfocus and refocusing back on what is\nbeing shared the fifth step if you get\nto disregulated it say something a lot\nof times we can't listen because our\nnervous system is over stimulated we're\noverwhelmed we're stressed out the\nconversation is too upsetting and we\nsimply need a break when we're stressed\nor overwhelmed we will physiologically\nstruggle to shift out of our own\nperspective to listen to someone else so\ntaking a break is the best thing we can\ndo for the conversation we can say\nsomething as simple as I just need a few\nminutes to calm down or I need a few\nminutes to process what I just heard and\nthen in a few minutes we can come back\nwhen we're in a calmer grounded State\nand when we're more able to\nphysiologically shift our focus and\nactually listen to the other person so\nthese are the five steps on how to\npractice active listening remember as\nalways to be patient with yourself as\nyou practice you won't be able to do\nthese steps perfectly not at first and\nmaybe not for a long time and that's\nokay\njust keep practicing and you will notice\nhow much your relationship improves how\nmuch deeper the connection feels so do\nyou consider yourself a good listener\nI'd love to hear from you in the\ncomments"
