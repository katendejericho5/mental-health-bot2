    "transcript": "today I had the opportunity to interview\nJamie Kar Lima New York Times\nbest-selling author of believe it and\ntoday she's here with me to have a chat\nabout our new book worthy we talk about\nthe difference between self-confidence\nand self-worth we explore the fear of\nfailure and rejection that keep many of\nus stuck and we uncover the biggest lies\nthat lead to self-doubt you're not going\nto want to miss this conversation so\nJamie thank you so very much for being\nhere with us today to talk about your\nnewest book worthy how to believe you're\nenough and transform your life Nicole\nthank you thank you so much for having\nme it's going to be a fun time of course\nof course I've been very much looking\nforward to not only the opportunity to\nsupport you in your work but the\nopportunity to have a conversation and\nfor those within my community who aren't\nyet familiar with you your incredibly\ninspirational and Powerful journey and\nnow the two beautiful pieces of work you\nput out there in believe and in worthy\nI'm super excited to introduce them to\nall all things Jamie Kar Lima and I\nthink a really great place for us to\nthen jump off and get started even when\nI see the topic of the book or the title\nI should say worthy right and I think\nmaybe people who know their background\nor who have listened to my to the intro\nhere um are aware of how much really\nthat you've achieved and accomplished in\nyour in your life so when I hear of of a\ntopic a book topic like worthy coming\nfrom a person like yourself for anyone\nlistening who may is it instinctually\nthinking well what do you mean of course\na person like you feels worthy what is\nit that really inspires you to tackle\ntackle this\ntopic I believed for most of my life\nNicole the lie like the lie that if I\nachieve enough of what the world tells\nme will make me happy um then I'll\nfinally feel enough and so I spent\nDecades of my life you know kind of\nworking so hard and and you know for\nanyone listening you know with us right\nnow who like has had a goal or or\nsomething they thought oh when I finally\nget that thing then I'll be happy or\nthen I'll feel enough and for some of us\nit might be you know a professional goal\nor for others that might be like oh when\nI finally get in a relationship or get\nmarried or have kids or have get hit my\nfitness goals and get that six-pack abs\nor the dream car or the number of the\nbank account whatever it is for anyone\nwho's ever sort of like thought oh once\nI finally get that thing then I'm gonna\nbe made in the shade I'm gonna be happy\nand then you know for a lot of us we've\nworked so hard and then if you know\nwe've actually gotten one of those\nthings and been like huh I thought you\nknow we're happy for a little while um\nsometimes a year sometimes a few months\nsometimes a few hours and then before we\nknow it it's for most of us we're back\nto that spot of like why do I feel like\nsomething's missing why do I feel like\nthis isn't enough why do I feel like I'm\nnot enough and you know my answer to\nthat for a lot of years of just you know\ncontinually feeling like I wasn't enough\nwas oh I just got to achieve more I got\nto try harder I got to hustle harder I\ngot to go to the next level and after\ndoing that and finally getting a whole\nlot of what I thought would be enough I\nrealized uh I was still in my life\nfeeling like it wasn't enough like I\nwasn't enough I was still uh sabotaging\nthings in my life and I was still uh not\nunderstanding why and there was kind of\na big moment where uh uh something\nhappened with Oprah of all people and uh\nlike a dream of a lifetime for me\nhappened and I sabotaged the entire\nthing and this was at a moment where I\nhad a lot of what the world told me\nshould make me feel enough and what I\nrealized in that moment was I was really\nself-confident I had a lot of confidence\nbut I did not have self self worth and I\nlearned that they're very different and\nso I became about three years ago\nobsessed with studying self-worth with\nunderstanding how it's so different from\nself-confidence and from all the things\nthat you know so many of us all the\nmessages so many of us hear from the\nworld will tell us once we finally get\nthem then then you know we'll be happy\nand fulfilled and feel enough and um and\nI realized that I had worked really\nreally really hard for a lot of years um\num you know uh trying to believe I\nbelong in my family in my own skin in\nthe boardroom in the CEO role in you\nknow all the things um and I had built a\nwhole lot of self-confidence but\nUnderneath It All had not build\nselfworth and so you know when you\nGoogle my story you always see like\nDenny's waitress builds billion dooll\ncompany uh which is true but my real\nstory is a girl who spent most of my\nentire life not believing in my myself\nand it's really been a recent now\nmulti-year journey of learning how and\nlearning to believe I'm enough and so I\nreally wrote worthy uh for anyone else\nlike for anyone out there who just feels\nlike who they are isn't enough uh and\nthey don't know why and they don't want\nto feel that way and it's really a book\nabout you know there's 20 Tools in it\nabout how to sort of unlearn the lies\nthat that lead to self-doubt and and\nsort of ignite those truths that that\nwake up worthiness and I think um and\nyou know I've talked about this uh uh a\nlittle bit before offline Etc but the\nthing one of the things I've shared that\nI'm really excited about is that while\nsome things take a whole lot of work or\nyou have to learn a bunch of new things\nalmost like a foreign language um the\nbeautiful thing about selfworth is that\nevery single person like who's listening\nto us watching us right now is fully\nworthy like exactly as they are and your\npast mistakes and failures and regrets\nand all the things that you think are\nwrong with you have nothing to do like\nwith it just like all your you know wins\nand successes and victories all of\nthat's all great and all out there but\nit has nothing to do with the you that\nis you which is fully worthy and so\nbuilding selfworth is so much of a\njourney about just really unlearning\nunlearning all the lies that lead to\nself-doubt and really just um waking up\nuh the Beauty and the power uh and then\nthe full worthiness that is you know you\nand each one of us um and so for me it's\nbeen a very recent thing really just the\npast couple years now where I'm able to\nactually enjoy the things I'm doing or\nfeel fulfilled in the things I'm\npursuing because Underneath It All um\nI'm building that knowing that oh I'm\nenough regardless of if I fall flat on\nmy face and fail at this thing\nregardless of if someone rejects me or\ntells me I'm not enough or regardless of\nif I crush it hit it out of the park and\nwin all of that is separate from this\njust like unshakable sense of selfworth\nso I'm so excited to get worthy out into\nthe world um and uh and it's really just\nfor every person who has some self-doubt\nto destroy and a destiny to\nfulfill which just you know speaking\nfrom my lived experience my now\nexperience within my ever growing\nCommunity there are so many Jamie some\nones out there who this book is going to\nspeak to um not only in terms of so many\nsimilarities I think that many people\nare going to see as you so generously\nshare so much of your own Journey seeing\nthemselves in you at different stages of\nyour own self-worth journey and so many\npractical tools to begin to unlearn as\nyou're very wisely sharing is the\nprocess that we need to do to unlearn\nand I want to get to some of those lies\nin just a little bit but I want to go\nback because I'm I really relate with\nthe aspect of your journey in terms of\nthis endless drive to accomplish to\nachieve right I think you even write in\nyour book most of my life I believe that\nI if I accomplish just that one thing\nand I invite listeners to fill in the\nblanks in their own mind right now what\nis that one thing that you might In This\nMoment have the idea belief or even hope\nwould give you that sense of worthiness\nthat give give you that sense of\nenoughness that give you that sense of\nfulfillment and on a very similar\njourney of always looking for these\noutside external achievements that very\nmuch I think are celebrate it or\ncelebrate it within my family of origin\nor celebrate it on a grander scale by\nsociety and one of the reasons why I I'm\nso I'm so grateful that you share your\npersonal Journey because I do think\nthose of us that have those external\nachievements whether it's the letters\nafter our name or the life and The\nBusiness business or the thing that\nwe've created that we're we're getting\npraise or validation from you know other\npeople around I think the reality for a\nlot of us at least was the case in my\nown journey is we don't have that level\nof fulfillment we don't feel I mean I\ncame into my 30s after checking so many\nboxes of things that I desperately\nwanted to achieve that I too thought\nwould lead me to feeling happy to\nfeeling fulfilled to even feeling\nconnected to those achievements and when\nI was left feeling really empty not only\ndid I feel you know shameful and\nunfulfilled myself there was a part of\nme that was even judging myself kind of\nfrom the outside well why Nicole do you\nhave the right to feel as you do when\nyou've done so much and so again I\nreally want to kind of speak to both\nsides of this that those that are\nlistening that don't yet feel worthy at\nall and maybe don't have externally\nthose accomplishments they're looking\nfor and also those that have and are\nmaybe on that trajectory that you and I\nhave been on of trying to just grasp for\nthis feeling um that really comes from\nwithin and I think as we're talking\nabout building this Foundation you've\nalready spoke a bit about kind of the\ndifference between self-worth because I\nthink these are Concepts that many of us\nhave heard of or maybe you know want to\ncultivate in our own life but difference\nbetween or similarities and differences\nbetween\nself-worth and self-confidence because I\nthink those are an area where we might\nnot know exactly what we're talking\nabout or we might not understand that\nthose can and are sometimes distinctly\ndifferent concepts in it in and of\nthemselves and I have learned you know I\ndid not know the difference between the\ntwo I thought oh selfworth\nself-confidence same thing let me just\nbuild it and I think most people for\nsure confuse the two and why it's so\nimportant like lifechanging important to\nto distinguish the two is because when\nwe're only doing things our whole life\nthat build self-confidence while that is\nimportant we will never feel enough as\nwho we are if we don't also build\nselfworth and so you know kind of the\nway I describe them the differences\nbetween the two in the book uh is you\nknow for self-confidence while it's an\ninternal trait is is based so much on\nhow we assess our own skills and\nabilities um our willingness to try and\ngo for it um it's it's largely based on\nexternal things that fluctuate like if\nwe're winning or losing at the moment\nright like the study show the boxer who\nwins the fight uh she is 30% more\nconfident when she wins um uh uh she or\nhe and if if if you know they're losing\nsame thing uh it fluctuates right and\nand how we feel we Stack Up and compare\nourselves to others our confidence is uh\nvery volatile and it's fragile and it's\nup and it's down all the time and and\nwhen we see so many of the ads um you\nknow growing up commercials on\ntelevision ads out there so many of them\nfeed on things that boost our confidence\nlike they tell us oh when you finally\nget this dream car then you'll be happy\nthen you know all the things we have\nwell- intended if we're blessed well-\nintended friends and family that will\nsay you know they ask us things like oh\nyou know how's your job how is your\nrelationship you know these kind of\nthings and and for decades we hear those\nquestions that really they're kind of\nreally for most of us the only questions\npeople ask is about your job or about\nyour relationship or kids right kind of\nthing and we sort of learn that oh once\nI have really great answers to those\nquestions then I should feel enough and\nall of these things are important you\nknow pursuing our goals our dreams all\nthat's so important to build\nself-confidence but none of those things\nwhether it's the dream car or the\nsix-pack abs or you know the\nrelationship status or anything else\nnone of them build selfworth they all\nbuild self-confidence which is fragile\nand fluctuate but none of them build\nselfworth is the Deep internal knowing\nthat we are innately worthy of love and\nbelonging exactly as we are not as our\nrelationship status not as our job title\nnot as our past or\nfail failures or successes none of that\nbut exactly as we are and the way I kind\nof like to think about it is like our\nself-confidence is is the big house that\nwe're building with all of the rooms\nthat we're adding and the windows and\nit's a it's a fun journey of growth\nwhich is important uh but that the\nself-confidence of that of that house uh\nis sitting on top of the\nfoundation uh which is your selfworth\nand and the house will only ever be a\nsecure as the foundation is and when we\nhave cracks in our selfworth when our\nself-worth is shaky when it's not\nexistant uh that's when it feels like\neverything kind of comes crashing down\nand you know our selfworth also in so\nmany areas is our ceiling it's really\nour ceiling and so you know there are so\nmany things that maybe every a lot of\npeople listening can can relate to this\nor maybe it's it's an epiphany in some\nways for some people like it was for me\njust a couple years ago in a big way\nthat we can be really confident in our\nskill set we can do personal development\nwork and overcome limiting beliefs\naround I'm too young or too old I'll\nnever make a million dollars like I'm\nnot smart enough I don't have the right\nskill set we can do all the work on on\non building our skill set overcoming\nlimiting beliefs around uh things we\nthink hold us back Etc but if Underneath\nIt All We do not believe we're worthy of\nthe\nthing like that becomes our ceiling\nright so so we can know how to do all\nthe things but we you know if and the\nthree ways just to share quickly the\nthree ways really that\nself-worth um because if someone's\nlistening going well I think I'm\nconfident do I have a self-worth issue\nor do I have both challenges the way\nthat that that are are very common for\nselfworth or lack of self-worth to show\nup in our lives is when we have low\nselfworth it often looks like we're\nstuck like we're stuck right like we\nhave an idea to write the book but we\ndon't or we you know really want to have\na relationship in our lives but we're\nnot getting on the dating app or not\nleaving the house like different things\nlike that right or or you know we have\nthis great idea for a business and we\nwant to register the domain name but we\ndon't and we don't know why um we hate\nour jobs and want to leave so badly but\nwe we just we feel stuck and we we don't\nknow why and we think we tell ourselves\nstories often like oh I've just got to\nyou know get more experience I got to\nget more Skillets I've got to put more\nreps in then I'll be ready and often the\nunderlying reason is we don't believe\nwe're worthy of the thing so deep down\ninside so so we sabotage it to stay\nstuck because in our relationships in\nour goals and dreams uh in our career\nAmbitions like our selfworth is our\nceiling and so when we have low\nself-worth it often looks like we're\nstuck when we have like low to medium\nself-worth that sometimes looks like\nyou'll go for the thing you'll go for it\num uh uh and then you'll hit a ceiling\nuh and you don't know why or you'll\nsabotage it along the way so there are\nthings I have done right I have actually\nand maybe people listening relate to\nthis I have dated someone and I've been\nlike wow they're finally like a great\nhuman being being right versus like a\nbad boy who's going to crush my heart or\nwhatever and what do we do we put him in\nthe friend zone we're like oh I don't\nknow why I'm just not attracted to them\nand um and and and I learned the hard\nway it's because Underneath It All I\ndidn't believe I was worthy of a a\nhealthy loving relationship so I found\nmyself attracted to what was most\ncomfortable and most familiar which in\nmy case was people that uh didn't didn't\ntreat me as if I was worthy um and so\nwhen we have low to medium self it looks\nlike that it looks like we will sabotage\nopportunities we'll get something we've\nalways hoped for and then somehow\nsabotage it we'll be making all this\nmomentum in our business and or our\ndreams and then find ourselves scrolling\nInstagram for eight hours a day like we\nwill hit a ceiling and not know why\nbecause our selfworth is our ceiling and\nthen if you have you know medium to high\nself-worth what that can look like is\nyou go for the things you know you you\nyou know you you you know attracted\nbeautiful relationship in your life and\nyou you know accomplished this goal or\nthat goal or all the things that you're\ngoing after in your life but then when\nyou finally arrive at those things you\nstill feel like it's not enough you\nstill feel like something's missing like\nyou're not enough and perpetually\nunfulfilled and so self-worth really is\none thing that is just so powerful and\nand and affects every area of our life\nand what I realized and maybe a lot of\npeople listening can relate to this is\nbecause when I realized this in my life\nNicole I had like you know that emoji\nwith the head exploding like oh my gosh\nthis is why I've been doing what I've\nbeen doing I realized that most of my\nentire life I was trying to subsidize\nall of my feelings of not enoughness\nthrough things that only build\nself-confidence but don't build\nselfworth which was achievement external\nrecognition uh all the things that the\nworld celebrates trying to check all the\nboxes that I have learned or been taught\nyou know are what you do when you've\nmade it or you're enough or you're you\nknow accepted or you're validated and\nagain those things are all great\nself-confidence building self-confidence\nis very very very important but you also\nhave to build selfworth and knowing the\ntwo are different is huge because I\nthink a lot of people even the people in\nthe category you described where where\nyou know you've really gone after\nyour goals and dreams a lot of people do\nthat their entire lives and still arrive\nat the very end of their life\nunfulfilled and feeling like it's not\nenough and feeling like they're not\nenough um and so there's something so\nbeautiful and Powerful about unlearning\nall those lies you know embracing the\ntruth that we truly are fully enough as\nwe are that no external things Define\nthat um and having that that sort of\nRock Solid certainty and uh I think\nsometimes for really ambitious people\nthey get afraid that well if I think I'm\nenough as I am am I going to lose my\nambition and it's like no actually you\nget more ambitious because when you\nbelieve you are enough as you are what's\nso cool about that is that you then\nyou're not afraid to you become for me\nI've become even more ambitious like you\nyou become unafraid of going after the\nthings because you know even if you fail\nmiserably even if you fall flat on your\nface it might shake your confidence but\nit cannot touch your worth and that is a\nplace of power and also a place of peace\nand also a place of Freedom so\nself-worth is such a thing and I know\nyou talk a lot about it by the way I\njust have to say um for anyone watching\non YouTube I loved um how good worthy\nlooks next to how to be the love you\nseek because when you H you know it you\nsee yeah like literally it starts to\nturn purple like a little bit next to it\nbeautiful I love it I love it I love\nstart to turn purple um I want to thank\nyou as always Jamie I think that even\nthese examples you're giving can be so\nshame relieving for many listeners out\nthere because I know so many people who\nhave found them stuck themselves stuck\nin these cycles of of self- sabotage or\nall the byproducts of that deep rooted\nfeeling of unworthiness or not\nenoughness and can't seem to kind of\nflick out of even like you were sharing\nearlier having very well-meaning\nsupporting loved ones in our Corner in\nour Circle as you describe you know not\nhaving that from within and earlier when\nyou were sharing a bit about being asked\nthe question I had a big smile on my\nface when you brought up the very common\nquestion of how's work because what came\nto mind so immediately for me um when my\nmom was was alive she's now been dead\nfor a little over two years but every\nphone call every visit home the and I hi\nMom it's it's me it's\nNicole within seconds out of her mouth\nwas hi Nicole how you doing how's work\nalmost immediately in the same sentence\nnot even a pause how are you doing comma\nyou know how are you doing how's work as\nif those two were one and the same and\nfor me that was so\nreflective of learning my childhood\nconditioning where there was a sense of\nfusion between how I performed or what I\ndid\nand my inherent sense of worth so much\nso that bringing out back in this Con\nconcept of\nself-confidence I found a pattern in my\nlife very begrudgingly so of and I was\njoking with you a little bit it's funny\nthat this came up behind the scenes\nbefore we hit record things that I was\nimmediately good at and in childhood\nthat began with academics Athletics you\nknow certain Sports I excelled at I\nloved it I got praise from my mom my mom\nvery much wanted me to be successful in\nlife so of course you know prioritizing\nacademics and Athletics even being as an\nAvenue to getting into the college to\nhaving the job to pursuing the degree\nthat then I spoke I wanted to pursue\nright all of those are good things right\nmany parents do want that of their\nchildren though I had learned right very\nquickly how to intuitively know what I\nwas good at so much so that if I tried\nsomething new and I immediately didn't\nexcel at it almost immediately I would\ndetermine that that's not for me that\ngame's not a game I like to play that's\nnot a sport I'm going to continue to\npursue I'm going to stop doing things\nthat I can't be immediately confident at\nin and the reason why I'm sharing this\nwhen I first started to present more\npublicly speaking on a camera right\nthings that immediately came very\ndifficult to me were very\nuncomfortable almost that that pattern\nright because I didn't have that\nself-confidence I mean that self-worth\nof a found Foundation right I knew what\nI was I was confident in a lot of things\nI got very good at distinguishing what I\ncould be confident at and what I\ncouldn't be confident at I would avoid\nthe things that didn't immediately\nelicit confidence because I hung my\nworth on what I did I didn't have that\nFoundation to feel enough being who I\nwas and that habitual pattern almost\nremoved the possibility for me pursuing\nthis more public platform that is the\nholistic psychologist that eventually\ntranslate for me to have this beautiful\nCommunity this membership and now to be\nthree books into my own author Journey\nso very much relating to lacking that\nfoundation and again just continuing to\nbring up a concept that I know many\npeople in my in my community hear me\ntalk about often which is unlearning\nright our conditioning and what that\nbegins with for a lot of us is becoming\nreally conscious or present to where we\nare now to what habits and patterns as\nyou beautifully describe right might be\nkeeping us stuck might be resulting in\nour decision not to share our idea right\nnot to talk of our dreams not to reveal\nour authentic truth or to stay stuck\nlike you were just describing and you\ntalk of fear and specifically two fears\nin general so when we can become\nconscious of maybe the role fear plays\nand can you offer us what those two\nfears are because I think for a lot of\nus that's a a beautiful starting point\nwithout shaming maybe the fact that\nthose fears are something that you're\npresent to in your in your current\nhabits but what are those fears and and\nkind of what information can that give\nus and then ultimately how can we begin\nto embrace those fears and essentially\nmake the choice to do it anyway yes and\nand one thing I want to say um really\nquick on what you just said that makes\nme so excited just for anybody listening\nright because obviously everyone part of\nyour community is so connected to you\nand you know how so often we can\nexperience our own healing or our own\nbig aha moments through seeing someone\nelse's example and I just want to call\nout one thing really quick uh because I\nthink it's just so beautiful and\nPowerful that you just shared for for\neveryone listening who is just so just\nblessed and benefited by your work and\nby you showing up in the world the way\nthat you do and by you being on you know\nInstagram and YouTube and all the your\nbooks all the things you're doing and to\nthink about how it could have not\nhappened right to think about what you\nand and I want to relate this to every\nsingle person who's who's with us right\nnow listening and watching us like how\neasily if Dr niaa decided oh no I'm just\ngonna only do the things I'm fully\nconfident in and and and never actually\nhave enough you know selfworth to\nbelieve I am enough as who I am so I'm\ngonna put myself out there and do things\nthat maybe are out of my comfort zone\nand and then build my skill set and\nconfidence in them but have enough worth\nhave enough selfworth to know who I am\nis enough and then to make that decision\nto go for it and when I think about like\nfor me and most of my life so many of\nthe things in my life almost didn't\nhappen and a lot of things didn't happen\nbecause I doubted myself out of them and\nand I just want to tie this into every\nperson listen right now because I know\nthere are people with us right now who\nmaybe have their own expression of their\nsoul they have been holding back on\nsharing with you know could be the world\nit could be one person it could just be\nsharing it with their own time in their\nlife and so often it's because we've\nbeen taught that lie oh oh if I'm bad at\nit let's keep it moving and it's not for\nme I'm not right all those things things\nand and yet like you know watching you\nuh and I should say celebrating you uh\nin how you show up and serve and the\nimpact that you have and your books and\nyour work and YouTube and I was\ncommenting before we started recording\nabout uh uh how fond I am of the videos\nyou'll do with with Jenna and uh I\nhaven't seen Lolly and any we got to\nstart that too but anyways uh you know\njust all of the expression\nof of of your offering out into the\nworld that if you still were in that\nplace of oh if I'm not good at it\nimmediately I'm not going to do it I\njust think of all of the things that\nwouldn't have happened all of the people\nwho are with you and me right now who\nwouldn't be impacted by your work\nbecause they wouldn't know about it like\njust like the ripple effect right and\nthen I just want to relate that to every\nperson listening um because it's so\nbeautiful and Powerful to embrace that\nyou are enough as you are and and it\nshifts how you then think of oh yeah I'm\ngoing to try things even if I fall flat\non my face I'm going to try things even\nif I feel like I don't have the skill\nset or the experience or haven't done\nthem before or they're new to me you\nknow and and and and and I just want to\nencourage everyone right now to think\nabout the things in their life right now\nthat maybe they're doubting themselves\nout of and it and it could be putting\nyour art out into the world it could be\nlike taking up bom dancing lessons again\nyeah you know it could be like just\nlooking in the mirror in your own eyes\nyou know what I mean and and just and\njust saying I love you like even if it's\nfor the first time ever or the first\ntime in a long time or it could be you\nknow deciding you're getting on the\ndating app no matter how many how many\nmisfires happened there you whatever it\nis but I think about how so many of us\nlike doubt ourselves and I'm speaking\nfrom experience here like doubt\nourselves out of our own destiny and\njust hearing you share that about\ngrowing up and with your mom and how for\nso long you wouldn't do things if you\nweren't immediately good at them and you\nknow when we think of this day and age\nwe're in you know for so many people\nright now they maybe want to express\nparts of who they are but they're not\ngood on social media or technology and\nso then they don't try or you know\nwhatever there's all these reasons why\nespecially with how rapidly the world's\nchanging if we if we're worried about\nnot being first of all no one's good at\nanything when they first try or very few\npeople are that's the first thing and\nand and and so and so just hearing your\nstory because obviously your work is\nincredible but there's little things\nthat hold us back like oh I don't know\nif I want to share it on YouTube I've\nnever done that or oh I don't know if I\nwant to do a book I've never written one\nor I don't know if I you know there's\nall of these things and I just I don't\nknow I just want to honor and celebrate\nin this sort of like real life example\nfor everyone with us because they're\nimpacted by you the way I am and and and\ntheir lives are so much better because\nof you so so for them to then go oh wow\nimagine if if if if little Dr nicoa Pera\nnever decided to do anything that she\nwasn't immediately confident in oh my\ngosh the difference that would be in\nthis world and and it's the same for\nevery person listening and so I I think\nit just kind of speaks to the the idea\nof of just how important it is to to\nbuild self-worth because again your\nconfidence is going to fluctuate you\nknow the first time I ever launched a\nproduct on television oh my gosh I was a\nhot mess like you know it was years of\ngetting rejected in my business told no\nyou know you're not right for us and I I\nfinally got one shot on live TV to sell\nthe product and I was shaking like a\nleaf I sweat through my dress I was a\nhot mess but had I never tried you know\nwhat I mean like had I never been bad at\nit at first um I could have never built\nwhat became a billion dollar company\nwhich is wild to even say but my point\nis just I don't know I I just had this\nfeeling when you shared that just a\nminute ago that like somebody needs to\nhear this right now today that maybe\ntoday is the day you know uh that\nthey're going to make that decision to\nstart fully embracing their own\nselfworth building their own self-worth\nand deciding like oh you know me not\nhaving confidence around something or\nbeing good at it instantly uh shouldn't\nbe the reason I'm holding back so uh but\nto answer your question about fears oh\nmy gosh so so there's two and two that I\nthink are really really big to talk\nabout you know at our core as human\nbeings I think our deepest fear is that\nis that you know uh we're not enough and\nand if we're not enough we won't be\nloved and you know right now my gosh\nstudies show 80% of women don't believe\nthey're enough uh 75% of female\nExecutives deal with impostor syndrome\n91% of girls and women don't love their\nbodies 73% of men feel inadequate and\nyou know when I see all those things I\njust think like you know to use the word\nyou and I both love it we got to unlearn\nunlearn some lies because that when you\nfundamentally believe you're not enough\nas who you are it is a lie it is a lie\nand I think the time for change has come\nand you know um and one of the one of\nthe big uh uh lies I think that we often\nwill Embrace um that can impact our\nself-worth stems around two fears a lot\nof people have and a lot of people have\na fear of rejection or a fear of\nfailure and if you are going out in the\nworld and just getting rejected and\nfailing that can rattle your\nself-confidence but when we let it take\nroot and start to think oh I have failed\nuh so many times I am a failure or I've\nbeen rejected I am a reject I am you\nknow that's when it can take root at our\nidentity level and really really impact\nour selfworth so in worthy there's a\nwhole chapter called uh when you change\nyour relationship with rejection uh you\nchange your entire life and uh it goes\nthrough like a real it's very it's a\nvery simple to apply to your life right\nnow kind of four-part framework on how\nto reframe rejection and uh and failure\nand you know Nicole a lot of people if\nif they're aware of IT Cosmetics or\nmaybe they used it or they've Googled\nthe story it looks like a fairy tale it\nlooks like a Denny's waitress which is\nme which is true started a business in\nher living room and now it's just this\nhu and then sold it to L'Oreal for over\na billion dollars it looks like this\nfairy tale and and and usually as we all\nknow when we see headlines or highlight\nreels that's all it is we usually do not\nsee the story behind the story and the\nreal story of that Journey was from the\nmoment I had launched the business in my\nliving room uh it was over three years\nbefore I could pay myself even a penny\nbut it was also hundreds and hundreds\nand hundreds of rejections and Nos and\nso often we let someone else's doubt\nabout us uh turn into doubt in our own\nhead\nor the people that we maybe put on a\npedestal and really value their opinion\nthey tell us they don't believe what\nwe're doing is going to work uh so after\none no or five NOS or five rejections or\n20 we quit we give up we think we don't\nhave what it takes our gut or our\nintuition or our knowing that said you\nshould go for this must be wrong and we\nliterally quit and you know what I have\nlearned and what I what I what I\ncaptured in um it's a funny story in\nworthy there's so there's 20 tools on on\nbuilding selfworth one of them is a\nchapter called when you change your\nrelationship with rejection you change\nyour life and that was actually its own\nbook so I wrote an entire book and and\nabout this because I'm so passionate\nabout it because for everyone listening\nwhen you learn how to completely change\nyour relationship with rejection or\nfailure and and and you actually assign\na new meaning to it it can change\neverything in your life and I had to\nlearn to do that not in theory but in\npractice like like learning to do that\nis the only way I kept going rejection\nafter rejection after rejection failure\nafter failure after failure to\neventually what now looks like on the\noutside world is this huge miraculous\nfairy tale um and on the inside what it\nwas was some real practical tools of\nlearning how to do this in my life and\nand that book uh called change your\nrelationship with rejection change your\nlife as you know as an author I would\nhave to wait another two years after\nworthy comes out to launch that book and\nI'm like I can't wait and so we put it\nin as chapter two in worthy so the whole\nentire uh framework and all of it about\nrejection failure is now chapter two in\nworthy and this is really what it\ncenters around and just for for everyone\nlistening in your life right now right\nso many of us think of failure or\nrejection of something that's painful or\nnegative or hurtful and as human beings\nwe will avoid pain if we can often at\nall costs and it's why like you know for\nme I have all these fitness goals and I\nknow the positives that will come from\nthem if I work out every day I know oh\nI'll feel so great I'll you know all my\nblood counts will be good all the and\nthen the pain of going on that treadmill\nor going to I don't want that pain and\nso many of us even though we know their\nreward we will avoid paying at all costs\nand it it shows up in so many different\nareas of our life but in particular when\nwe have a fear and a a big pain\nassociated with rejection potential\nrejection or potential failure the the\nthe meaning we assign to that is so\npainful that we will stay stuck we won't\ngo for the things we won't go after the\nthings right and so and so uh or we'll\nexperience them a few times and be like\nuhuh I'm giving up on that idea I'm\nGiving Up on dating I'm Giving Up on\ngoing after the business I must just not\nhave what it takes and so many of us\ntalk ourselves out of our own Truth uh\nbecause of how much pain we attach to\nfear of rejection and and fear of\nfailure so you know everything in life\nis the meaning we assign to it like\neverything the meaning we assign to it\nand so I go through in in worthy um I\ntake everyone through this this\nfour-part framework uh and and I'll do a\nmini version of it real quick with\neveryone just to add as much value as we\ncan in this episode um I know how\nprecious everyone's time is and and and\num so like right now and just for\neveryone listening to me and Nicole uh\nwhen you imagine we're gonna go through\nthe first R right now uh which is reveal\nso when you imagine getting rejected\ncould be you know the job you applied\nfor and didn't get the person that\ndidn't see your value the that you know\nyou wanted to be invited to the party\nand you weren't uh it comes in so many\nforms for us every day um it could be a\nbig rejection something in the past but\nwhen you imagine yourself uh being\nrejected or failing at something right\nwithout even thinking about it just uh\nthink what's the first thought that goes\nthrough your head when you are get\nrejected or you fail at something like\nthe first thought that goes through your\nhead for me most of my life it's yep\nthere's proof again I'm not enough proof\nI'm not enough what what has it been for\nyou um Nicole like thinking back to most\nof your life if you fail at something or\nget\nrejected yeah I think it's a version of\num for me it's the fear of of failure\nand then I think immediately again in\nthose contexts of I'm not good oh my God\nwhat do they think right I'm not enough\nfor them for the circumstance for the\nthing I want to do for the life I want\nto create yeah you know I once asked\nthis in a small group it was like a\nevent uh it wasn't that small actually\nbut it was an event and it was actually\na CEO conference and I think this caught\nthem by off guard when I said like\nwhat's the first thought you think of\nwith rejection or failure and a lot of\npeople shared what you and I had just\nshared a version of I'm not enough but\nsome people were were sharing their\nfirst thought which was I'm a failure\nI'm stupid why' I even try I'm a loser\nI'm a reject I knew I didn't have what\nit takes this always happens to me those\nwere some of the and people started\ncrying\nat the CEO conference um and so what I\nwant to share is for everyone listening\nand watching us right now that very\nfirst thought you just had that that\npopped into your head without thinking\nthat write it down if you can okay and\nthere might be more than one and write\nthem down because those are your current\nyour current definitions of rejection or\nfailure that is and for Mo most of us we\ndon't even realize right it's just a\nthought that comes really fast\nand for most of us that current\ndefinition is so\npainful that we will not go after the\nthing we will we will stay stuck we'll\navoid the possibility of of failure or\nrejection at all costs because that\ncurrent definition that popped into our\nhead is just so painful and so for me\nmost my life it's oh yeah I'm not enough\nand there was a moment as I was as I was\nbuilding my company we were a couple\nyears in I had gotten hundreds of\nrejections and I had had this dream this\nvision of like okay all these stores are\ntelling me that they don't like my\nimages of inclusivity with using all\ntypes of people and identities and\nshapes and sizes and skin challenges the\nway I have skin challenges and they're\ntelling me no one will ever buy makeup\nfrom from images like that so I had this\nVision what if I could go on QVC and\nbecause because all the stores were\nusing images that were very photoshopped\nthat weren't even real of models and I'm\nlike okay I get that that what they\nbelieve is the only way to sell a\nproduct at the time what if I could go\non QVC you can't Photoshop live TV at\nleast not not yet probably pretty soon\nbut not yet and um and I was like I\ncould prove the product works and I had\nthis Vision right for anyone listening\nwho's ever had this like gut feeling and\nyou start daydreaming you this Vision uh\nthat doesn't even make sense yet but you\njust have it I was like I have this\nVision I could go on live TV because\nthey broadcast to a 100 million homes I\ncould remove my makeup and show my\nbright red rosace and like prove this\nproduct works I had this whole Vision\nthat I could do it but they kept telling\nme no after no after no and I had\nfinally gotten a phone call with their\nhead guy and I was so excited and it was\none of the most painful NOS because it\nwasn't like no come back later it was\nlike no and he he said to me period says\nyou're he actually said the words you're\nnot the right Fit For A QVC or for our\ncustomers and when someone tells you\nyou're not the right fit first of all it\nhits in kind of a way that's but I\nremember this day crying under my covers\nI remember uh uh just so many rejections\nand I I I remember praying about this\nmeditating trying to understand why do I\nhave this strong gut feeling in this\nwhat feels like a knowing I'm supposed\nto do this but everyone keeps telling me\nno and and what I have learned by the\nway side note is that your knowing is\nmore powerful than anyone else's no I\ndon't care who's telling you no today\nwhen you get still and you feel your\nknowing that is what you trust and when\nyou do that it will it will change your\nwhole life it's hard to do that when\nwe're going through it and so that day I\nstarted Googling I was so upset I\nstarted Googling everybody that I\nadmired in the business World in who's\nhelped move Humanity forward people that\nI just thought were so impactful in this\nworld and I I Googled one after another\nafter every single one of them has had\ncountless failures and rejections in\ntheir Journey they're just the brave\nones willing to keep going anyway and\nthat day I wrote down in my journal\nrejection and failure does not mean I'm\nnot enough it means I'm one of the brave\nones willing to keep going like I'm not\ngonna live my life on the sidelines and\nregret like criticizing everyone else is\ngoing for it like I'm gonna go for it\nI'm gonna like and I I decided that was\nmy new meaning I was going to attach to\nrejection um another one is rejection is\nGod's protection or rejection is the\nuniverse's protection right depending on\nwhatever your belief system is you apply\nthat and when you write out a new\ndefinition for rejection which is the\nsecond R which is redefine it's\nimportant that it has to feel true in\nyour soul you can't say something that\njust sounds good on paper or or whatever\nyou it has to feel true and I knew in my\nin my soul that like oh yeah rejection\nmeans I'm one of the brave ones willing\nto keep going for or another definition\nrejection is God's protection there's so\nmany really really great um definitions\nand and I wrote out the ones I really\nbelieve to be true and I literally uh\nreframed I started reframing this every\ntime it happened and you know I would go\nand it helped me get back up and keep\ngoing um because I started to associate\nwhen I believe these new definitions I\nAssociated empowerment with getting\nrejected which does not make any sense\nto our old belief system we're taught\nbut I retrained my mind to associate a\nnew powerful meaning with rejection and\nfailure and so what started happening in\nthe real story that you never read about\nin The Press is I still kept getting\nrejection after rejection but instead of\nbeing like Oh yeah this means I'm not\nenough I should give up I should quit\nI'm a failure like oh this rejection is\na victory it's a reminder I'm one of the\nbrave ones willing to keep going for it\nor oh this re ections God's protection I\ncannot wait to see like what what better\nis coming down the road and and what\nbetter timing is going to happen but I\ngoing to trust this rejection is\nhappening for me um and I started\nredefining it and that is how I got back\nup every time I got knocked down and\neventually we got one shot on QVC after\nyears of rejections um a whole other\nstory I can share if at any point if you\nwant me to it's a whole other story\nabout trust in your knowing over all the\nnose um but we eventually sold out that\none airing we we then started doing live\nshow after live show after live show and\nand we built the beauty biggest Beauty\nbrand in QVC's history and I only share\nthat because for years they had said no\nand you're not the right fit and if I\nstill Associated so much pain with going\nafter it again and rejection and failure\nI would have never gone after it I could\nhave never built what became a billion\ndollar business but but more importantly\nI could have never believed I was worthy\nof being in that room of being on the\nset of all of those things of of\nbuilding an actual company and I\nredefined the meaning of of rejection\nand failure um the third R is revisit\nthis is my favorite one so many of us\nare carrying meanings that are so\npainful assigned to past rejections or\npast failures and one thing I do in my\nlife is I will go back and re visit and\nand ask myself what meaning am I\nassigning to that\nrejection and I will redefine it in my\nlife and remind myself of that that new\ndefinition until I truly believe it it\nhas to be one that's true it can't just\nbe positive thinking or BS or any of\nthat stuff but you know I was adopted\nand and and through you know the parents\nthat raised me working all the time I I\nalways had the story I told myself I'm\nabandoned and and reject and unwanted\nthese were kind of these labels that I I\ntook on and they they came out in a lot\nof different areas of my life um and it\nit was just a few years ago where I\nreally did the work of like oh wait a\nminute I'm I was actually chosen like my\nyou know I was chosen to come into this\nworld and my birth mom's life would have\nbeen way easier if she did not have me\nuh my adopted parents chose to raise me\nlike God chose me to come into this so\nfor me I'm like oh I'm I am not rejected\nand Abandoned and\nunwanted I can easily believe that\nbecause those labels apply to my story\nif if I want them to I'm gonna also I'm\ngonna also redefine it in a way that\nhelps me uh not let them take root in my\nselfworth and and also look at something\nI also believe is true this can't be\nagain positive thinking or lie I know\nit's true I'm Chosen and I'm one of a\nkind and all of those things and so um\nand the last small example just for for\nanyone listening today and again you can\nreplace the word god with universe or\nanything that you believe but probably\nmy all-time favorite one that I use all\nthe time Nicole because you me have both\nlearn this everyone listening it does\nnot matter how successful you are in\ndifferent areas of your life it doesn't\nI feel like we are all the same we all\nexperience versions of rejection and\nfailure for a lot of us myself every day\num and so my favorite definition I apply\nto past ones but also current ones um\nyou know and this is maybe for anyone\nlistening today who's had someone break\ntheir heart pull the rug out from\nunderneath them not see their value\nmaybe it's something like you really\nwanted the job and you don't know why\nyou didn't get it like I literally look\nat their rejections in my life and I\nfeel them fully I feel them all the\nfeelings that come with them I allow\nmyself to process those feelings and be\nin them uh and then I and then once I'm\nthrough that I decide the meaning I want\nto give to it and and that's when I use\nthis tool and I will most often and I've\ndone this with past dudes that have\nbroken my heart with so many things\nright I I really believe this I imagine\nand I do it to this day when I have a\npainful rejection or a friend that I\ndon't know why they don't like me they\njust don't or whatever it is a colleague\nwhere you're just like why wasn't I\ninvited whatever it is the job you\ndidn't get whatever I literally imagine\nmy Creator saying to me oh you weren't\nrejected I hid your value from them\nbecause they're not assigned to your\ndestiny and I believe that to be true\nand I trust it and it helps me that new\ndefinition helps me not let it take root\nin my Identity or selfworth when\nsomebody rejects me or when I fail I\ndon't feel like I'm a rejector I'm a\nfailure I'm like huh okay God was\nblocking my value from them because\nthey're not a signed to my destiny right\nfor some people it might be oh yeah the\nuniverse has my back universe is\nblocking my value from them because they\nare not assigned to my destiny right\nthese are tools you apply no matter what\nyour belief system but they will\nfundamentally shift uh so that things\ndon't take root in your self worth and\nso that you're like free like like these\nthese labels and these lies we put on\nourselves uh uh are heavy and and for me\nmost of my life it feels like trying to\nfly and spread my wings while carrying\nlead balloons and it's like Breaking\nFree of them and and and and assigning\nnew\nempowering uh beliefs and and\ndefinitions even the things that are\npainful that happen every day failure\nrejection Etc when they're true when\nthese when these definitions and they\ncan for everyone listening and watching\nyou create your own and they have to\nfeel true in your soul like for me I\nknow rejection is God's protection I\nknow\nyou know when someone rejects me oh I TR\nI have a Divine trust that my value is\nbeing blocked from them because they are\nnot assigned to my destiny I will trust\nit and doing this tastes like freedom\nand you just feel light and it's just\nit's one of my favorite tools in the\nbook so that was a long answer but\nhopefully Mak sense I absolutely\nappreciate it and what I think I\nspecifically appreciate about a theme\nthat's kind of woven through all of\nthose very helpful and practical tools\nJamie is your continued emphasis right\nthat this is almost kind of a two-\nlayered for lack of a better word\nJourney right this is beyond right for\nmany of us when you're talking about\nfears and feelings and our ability to be\nwith right what we're really in in kind\nof my language talking about is kind of\nour body's experience of emotions right\nthat being separate layer from the\nthoughts in our mind because I think\nmany of us have maybe heard of powerful\naffirmations to think even just\nrepeating right for sake of this\nconversation I'm worthy right over and\nover again the the many of us who have\ntried that probably get a bit frustrated\nbecause that isn't fully unless we're\nworking on that deeper level where\nbeliefs also exist Beyond just the\nthoughts in our mind all of those\nfeelings that are imprinted and stuck\nfor many of us in our body from our past\nexperiences our learning what was\nmodeled to us and everything in between\nthose affirmations right don't\nnecessarily work because even going back\nto when you asked me what was the first\nthought imagining a rejection or a\nfailure you know for me it would be more\nso a failure because that's my my more\npredominant fear it wasn't a thought\nthat I became most aware of first for me\nwhen I asked that question and calling\nto mind a failure or imagining myself\nfailing it was a feeling what I felt in\nmy body was a constriction almost like I\nwas holding my breath like I had knots\nin my stomach because what over time for\nme has gotten merged together is when I\ndon't perform or achieve or show up\nright in this display that someone wants\nor needs of me or thinks I'm capable of\nor is successful in this world what I\nlearned in my first earliest experience\nwith my mom in particular as I was\ndescribing our relationship earlier\nright was that I am not worthy right I\nhad this\nFusion of what I did and my ability to\nbe connected or belonged in my most\nimportant relationship so when imagining\nfailing or not living up to that\nexpectation what became prominent to me\nand just even tying all these Concepts\ntogether was the fear that lives in my\nbody because the meaning I have\nhabitually assigned over time was not\nachieving or performing results in Lost\nLove lost connection right loss of\nsomething I need there's the fear and\nthe constriction in my body and then\nthat merger of oh I am what I do so\nreally pulling apart and giving myself\nspace to not only explore kind of what\nhad caused and created this subconscious\npatterning but then allowed me to not\njust affirm my way into worthiness like\nI was describing earlier actually\nthrough daily actions creating the space\nin my life to show up in the embodiment\nof worthiness so that over time I didn't\njust have to rely on the actions and the\nfeedback that those actions would elicit\nI was beginning to have that internal\nFoundation of okay I might succeed in\nsome areas I loved how you even reframed\nfailure to some extent when we're trying\nsomething new the language you offer\nvery beautifully in the book and I now\nIncorporated this into my own my own\njourney is I am doing this for the first\ntime I am the first who right and I'm\nspeaking to the many cycle breakers out\nthere the many many of you listening who\nare beginning or going to Now set the\nintention to try something new for me\nthat was a incredibly powerful reframe\ninstead of that expectation that I\nshould immediately succeed being the\nfirst to go down this New Path being the\nfirst the first time I'm doing something\nreally reminding myself that it's new\nthis is a first and my worthiness again\ndoesn't hinge on what the outcome of\nthis action is and I do want to ask you\njust a little bit I know many of your\nchapters you go into a whole section of\nthe book and I really appreciated this\nwhere you as you referenced earlier you\nexplore and unpack a whole multitude\nreally an Arsenal a book if you will of\nlies that many of us right because what\nwe're talking about these beliefs\ningrained not just in our mind for many\nof us ingrained in our bodies keeping us\nstuck keeping us as you write\nbeautifully canceling oursel out of even\nacting in new way so I know we don't\nhave time to go through each and every\none of them but can you highlight um\nsome of the common lies that you have\ncome to the awareness very much do keep\nmany of us and I'm sure many listeners\nStuck In Those Old\nHabits oh my goodness yes uh which one\ndo I dive into there are some good ones\nin here right there are lies that say if\nI am me I won't be able to be loved\nperiod I won't find love\nuh I need to please them in order to\nlove me all of these lies in in the book\nand I share experiences and lessons\naround them um another one I think is is\nreally common that actually affects a\nlot of men and women is that my weight\ndetermines my worth um and I talk a lot\nabout realizing that I was waiting on my\nweight to actually think I was worthy of\nliving my best life and the numbers are\njust staggering around this around uh\nyou know\n91% of of of of people opt out of\nmeaningful activities and interactions\nwith loved ones and Etc when they don't\nlike how they look and it's wild um you\nknow I remember uh recently you and I\nwere talking about in in another\nconversation uh uh uh and and also Oprah\nI was having conversations with Oprah\nwhich sounds really wild to say that out\nloud but I'm just going to say it\nbecause she brought she brought this up\npublicly which will be shared soon but\nshe was saying that even if she gained\nfive pounds she would decline a party\ninvitation she would miss a big event\nand for me I talk a lot in the book\nabout this lie about waiting on your\nweight to to to and it has nothing this\nthis chapter has nothing to do with your\nweight by the way it's the idea of of\nwaiting for something to change before\nyou're worthy of of living your best\nlife and of being who you are of showing\nup um and sometimes it's our literal\nweight sometimes it's the weight of\nothers expectations or anything else um\nbut what I realized Nicole was even\nthough I had built you know a a company\nthat you know we had over and have tens\nof millions of customers just in the us\nalone and the the brand at Cosmetics was\nbuilt so much on uh uh feeling worthy\nand seen and and enough as you are and\neven through all of that in in my own\nlife you know I used to hide my rosacea\nI have bright red rosacea on both of my\ncheeks it gets very bumpy and I used to\nalways hide it because when I didn't I\nwould H go to the grocery store and\nsomeone would be like are you feeling\nokay or oh you got a sunburn huh or like\nit was such a thing and I always used to\nbe uh ashamed of it and I literally\nredefined my rose the way we just kind\nof went through that exercise and I\nthere was a moment one day in the\ngrocery store where and I was much\nyounger at the time uh this was over 10\nyears ago and I remember seeing a woman\nin the protu aisle who had all this\nhyperpigmentation across her face and uh\nuh I had my bright red rosacea it was a\na rare day I didn't have makeup on and I\nremember she and I made eye contact and\njust like smiled and in a moment it was\nlike without saying a word word it was\nlike thank you I see you you are\nbeautiful and there was just this moment\nand it it's it helped me uh redefine the\nmeaning I gave to my rosacea I saw it I\nwas like oh this is not a flaw I should\nbe mortified or embarrassed over like\nyou know this this could every time I\nshow it it could be inspiring and\nempowering which is part of why you know\nI see makeup the way I see fashion you\ndress up some days you dress down most\nday I wear sweats most days 99% of my\nlife I do not wear makeup some days I\nwant to put it on just like I want to\nyou know put on a real fun outfit or or\nwhatever but when I launched the company\nit wasn't about the product even though\nI really believe in the products it was\ntrying to redefine this whole thing\ntrying to empower uh uh people to see\ntheir their own Beauty and that's part\nof why I took my makeup off on National\nTelevision what became over a thousand\ntimes even though most of my life I\nwouldn't leave the house without makeup\nand my point is I learned how to\nredefine the meaning I attached to what\nI thought was a flaw my skin condition\ncalled rosacea but even through all that\nand even through this journey I still\nstruggled with thinking I needed to be a\ncertain weight to be worthy and I opted\nout of events if I didn't fit into\nclothes and all of the things you know\nand I talk about this a little bit in\nthe book which I've never talked about\nbefore but even you know I would make\nsure the lights are dim when I'm in the\nbedroom with my husband like all of\nthese insecurities and I didn't I didn't\nwear a swimsuit for like two decades and\nit wasn't until one day when um I was\nwith my my daughter who had was turning\none and we were in at a hotel in this\nreally crowded public pool and I was\ngoing to just not swim again and I just\nhad this huge Epiphany you talk about\nyour body you're just talking about the\nthings you feel in your body I always\nfeel like when we get still and stop\nlistening to our thoughts we can feel if\nsomething's true or not in our body by\nthe way that is how I ended up um a\nwhole other story calling Oprah after\nsabotaging that for four years because\nmy thoughts were telling me I wasn't\nenough but in my body I knew I'm enough\nlike every person listening to us right\nnow right because our body tells us it\ngets tense and something's a lie when\nsome and it just relaxes and something's\nthe truth and when we're able and this\nthe big focus of the book worthy when\nwe're able to get out of our own\nthoughts and and get into our body get\nout of our thoughts and get into our\nknowing that knows at our core each and\nevery person is fully enough it's like\nthe very first step in building\nworthiness and what I realized in that\nmoment in that pool was like uh oh my\ngosh me just not swimming because I\nthink I need to wait on my weight to be\nworthy of putting on a swimsuit that is\na lie and all I'm do first of all no one\ncares what I look like in a swimsuit and\nsecond of all all I'm doing is teaching\nmy daughter she's unworthy a of being in\na swimsuit and you know what I mean and\nand it was like that was the day where I\nrealized this question what has waiting\non my weight already cost me in my life\nand the answer was way too much and that\nwas the day I decided to literally no\nlonger wait on my weight to live my best\nlife and there's a whole chapter just\nabout that lie that we need to wait on\nsomething to finally HP to happen to be\nenough and it is a a lie that leads to\nNowhere um and it's kind of all hindered\naround that that fundamental question\nreally even bigger than beyond that\nwhich is what is self-doubt already cost\nyou what is believing you're unworthy\nalready cost you in your life and\nearlier you and I were talking about how\nwhen you associate pain to something um\nyou know we'll avoid it at all costs and\nI have found the reverse can be true\nmeaning not the not the reverse of that\nbut that you can apply that to instead\nof being fearful to step out and start\nyour worthiness journey and and make the\nphone call and get on the dating app and\ndo all the thing instead of being\nfearful over that a great way or a great\nboost of encouragement and a boost of to\nto go after all of those things on your\nown journey of building selfworth is to\nuse that human fear of pain in the way\nof flipping it and saying well what has\nself-doubt already cost me and the pain\noften of everything that's costed us by\ndoubting ourselves is going to be far\ngreater than the pain of what might\nhappen if we go for it and it doesn't\nturn out how we wanted it to and so I go\nthrough kind of in the book how to do\nthat as well but for me I mean it's such\na simple silly example but it's how I\nended up putting on the swimsuit and\njiggling my cellulite with joy and all\nthe things uh no longer waiting on my\nweight uh to feel worthy um and it's\nreally just a one of many lies though to\nto unlearn that's that's really powerful\nbecause you know for everyone listening\nto think of what a self-doubt already\ncost us in our relationships and our\ngoals and dreams and our hopes etc for\nso many of us the anwers way too much\nright you write a beautiful quote and\nyou say self-doubt and self-belief take\nan equal amount of energy to manifest\nsomething that hasn't happened and so\naside from the pain the energy the focus\non whether it's again the self-doubt or\nthe self-confidence or the self-belief\nright it is it is taking a toll right it\nis a very real piece of our experience\nand for many of us it does contribute so\nmuch attentional focus on doubt so much\nfocus on the fear the pain and all of\nthat that which is wrapped up up in this\nbelief of I'm\nunworthiness is very objectively and\nlogically pulling our attention and our\nresources away and even outside of our\nawareness contributing to what we are\ncontinuing to recreate even if\nultimately that we want to avoid it and\nI just have to say going through the\nmany different lies there were so many\nin there Jamie that I saw kind of\nreflected in bits and pieces of my own\nself-beliefs that have been create it\nand reinforce and validate it over time\nand I just want to continue to thank you\nfor really your generosity in being so\nopen and vulnerable there's so much of\nyou within these Pages many things that\nI learned about you for the first time\neven in reading your your narrative in\nhere that you know are so close details\nare different circumstances are\ndifferent but\nunderlying experience beliefs shifts\nchanges um for me was just really really\nsupportive um in terms of again this I\nyou know when we see ourselves reflected\nin someone else and this is why I'm just\nso grateful that you so readily speak um\non the more kind of the deeper aspects\nof our journey because I do think that\nthings can be projected that aren't\nnecessarily the reality and seeing so\nmuch of myself in you has relieved again\nthat suffering that I think many of us\ncreate in our own Journeys where we\nsecretively believe that we must be the\nonly only one struggling with this lie\nstruggling with this area sabotaging in\nthis way and back to I think a beautiful\nconcept you offered earlier there is so\nmuch similarity in our individual human\nexperiences wherever you're tuning in to\neven listen to this talk from then\ndissimilarity so just want to continue\nto thank you for who you are how you\nshow up in this world in general of\ncourse all of the beautiful work that\nyou've now put into both of these books\nI think they're going to be of such\nbeautiful impact when the collective you\nknow as they get their hands on it and I\nkind of I want to end with a really\npowerful quote I love quotes So I have\nmany quotes actually of yours that I've\ntaken from from this now new book but\nyou you kind of pose a question if you\nwill for readers I think it's toward the\nend of the book um and you say what will\nyou do with the power that is you\nbravely boldly live the answer answer so\nmy very long-winded way of sending you\nthe gratitude for all of the ways Jamie\nthat you do bravely boldly publicly\ninspirationally right not only just live\nthe answer of what we see and think is\nreflected externally but how open you\nare about the whole journey that is you\nan evolution that is you it is so from\nnot only a kind of professional you know\nkind of us join together in service but\nfrom a very personal side of things I'm\njust so appreciative and inspired and\ncontinue

say\nto you is this was my hope is you know I\nI love when you give your you put your\nbooks out in places for people that and\nI just remember I have a memory growing\nup of the library cards like traditional\nlibrary cards so the end of worthy I\ndon't know if you'll see so you're going\nto be the first to see it you're like\nliterally you have a copy Nicole before\nmy family let's just put that on record\nsay I love you see this library card at\nthe end so it's like a traditional libr\nlibrary card because I had this Vision\nthat you know when you get your book at\nhome um when you're done with your book\nwrite your name in the library card and\nthen pass it on to another woman another\ngirl another person who you know oh my\ngosh if they just learn to believe in\nthemselves or see how amazing they were\num if they just knew how worthy they are\num and I'm just imagining like a full\nlibrary card when people pass their\nbooks on and um and so I'm just yeah I'm\nso grateful I'm honored and you\nliterally you have you and me are\nholding two of the very first copies um\nI have not even been able to give one\nyet to anyone in my family or I mean\nthis is yeah brand new hot off the press\nand I'm so honored and excited to share\nit with you and just every every person\nin your community that's joining us and\nthat's part of this conversation it's\njust so important and it matters and\nwhen we learn to believe we are worthy\nit just changes every single aspect of\nOur Lives it also changes how we love it\nchanges the relationships and what you\nall of it so thank you so much for the\nhonor of of just sharing this this space\nand this conversation with you my gosh\nwhat a what a powerful sentiment to end\non right when we begin to believe that\nwe're worthy it changes really\neverything right our ability to show up\nin in service of ourselves ultimately\nthen our ability to show up in service\nof our relationships and generally just\nin service and something you'll hear me\nsay quite frequently is I do truly\nbelieve that inherently part of each of\nus as individ ual is that desire to\nserve to be of you know value to someone\nand something that is even bigger larger\ngreater than ourselves and I do think\nthat you gave us the blueprint in your\nnew book worthy here it is again one\nfinal time for everyone to take a look\nat the blueprint on how to begin as\nalways I will offer the very realistic\nreminder the journey right this is not\nan overnight um process of just flipping\nthe light switch As I like to say though\nas we begin to build this Foundation\nthis internal Reservoir if you will of\nworthiness the impact is in my opinion\nfar greater than any of us can even\nimagine so thank you again Jamie as\nalways thank you to the beautiful\ncommunity that tunes into to these\nepisodes that is open and curious and\ninterested and in my opinion creating\nsuch a great impact that I truly honored\nto be on this journey alongside each and\nevery one of you"
