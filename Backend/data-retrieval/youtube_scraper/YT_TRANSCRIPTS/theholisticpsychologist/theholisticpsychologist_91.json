    "transcript": "I really don't like my daughter-in-law\nokay so what don't you like about her\nshe's controlling she wants everything\nto go her way and my son just goes along\nwith it he never stands up to her in\nwhat ways is she controlling well she\nwears the pants he has to go to her\nabout everything even making plans to\nbring the kids over I think right now\nyou might be grieving what feels like\nthe loss of a son but you're not able to\naccess those feelings because that would\nbe vulnerable so instead you're blaming\nhis wife because that feels a little\nmore comfortable my son is just\ndifferent since he met her that's what I\nknow I get it you're right he is\ndifferent your son now not only as a\nwife to consider but two kids that would\nchange anyone he isn't going to always\nbe available to you like he's been in\nthe past this is where you can work on\nlearning how to cope and building the\nrelationship with your husband so he can\nmeet your needs instead of just relying\non your son to do that in past sessions\nwe've talked about how there's some a\nmment between you and your son which\njust means an unhealthy dependence and\nnow you have the opportunity to shift\ninto a healthier pattern for you both so\nI'm the problem here not that his wife\nsays jump and he says how high"
