    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about\nreparenting I outline these steps in how\nto do the work and I want to make sure\nthat everyone has access to them so\nwe're going to go over them here healthy\ndevelopment in childhood depends on\ngetting our intrinsic needs met we are\nborn completely dependent on the parent\nfigures or caregivers around us to meet\nour needs in three main areas the first\narea is our physical needs our body\nneeds nutrients oxygen water for all of\nour cells and organs to run our body\nalso needs movement and moments of rest\nor restorative sleep at night the second\ngroup of needs are our emotional needs\nwe all need to feel safe to feel secure\nto feel supported we need to feel\nconnected and belonged in relationships\nwhere we can truly be ourselves the\nthird group of needs are called\nspiritual needs this is really\nemphasizing the uniqueness in our\nself-expression\neach of us have our own individual\npurpose our own imagination our own\ncreativity and we're very playful joyful\ncreatures these are all our spiritual\nneeds so really simply when we're\nthinking about physically emotionally\nspiritually universally as individuals\nwe all have the same core need to be who\nwe are or simply to be seen to be heard\nand to be authentically\nexpressed even well-meaning\nparents often can't consistently meet\nthe needs of their children either\nbecause they lack resources they have\ntheir own unresolved trauma or they're\nemotionally immature they can't care for\nsomething else emotionally outside of\nthemselves and what this leaves us with\nis with wounds and with coping\nstrategies that can hold us back and\nkeep us stuck in cycles and we can all\npractice rep parenting or simply meeting\nour own needs reparenting is be becoming\nour own wise inner parent so that we can\ndo three things so that we can quiet our\ninner critic we can notice all of those\ncritical judgmental voices in our mind\nand turn down the volume remove our\nattention from those critical voices the\nsecond thing is we can learn how to\nexplore and validate our own perspective\nour own reality our own emotions our own\nexperience the third thing is so that we\ncan cultivate compassion and patience we\ncan accept oursel along the way of our\njourney exactly as we need it in\nchildhood so what does this look like\npractically how can we start\nreparenting this can be as simple as\nevery morning before you get out of bed\nand get started with your day pausing to\nask yourself what can I do for myself\nwhen we pause to ask oursel what we need\nwe're creating this space in our day and\na statement to oursel that we matter and\nthat our care matters now for some of\nyou what you might need is a couple of\nminutes alone others might want some\ntime to journal or maybe some time to\nstretch I know for me every morning\nafter coffee I take some time to journal\nand then I take some time to read in\nsilent reflection and then I spend some\ntime moving my body could be 10 15 20\nminutes that's all before I get started\nwith whatever else it is that I have to\ndo with my day these moments this PA\nasking oursel what do I need for myself\nis so incredibly important because it\nhelps us break any habits of denying or\nignoring our own needs especially\nimportant for all of you parents out\nthere who have other people children to\ncare for throughout your day it is so\nimportant to create space for your own\nself-care and by consistently pausing to\ncheck in with your own body you'll\nbecome more and more aware of knowing\nwhat it is that you need and ultimately\nin being able to meet your needs so when\nyou're practicing that pause asking\nyourself what it is that you need you\ncan explore your needs in these four\npillars of reparenting the first pillar\nis called self-care this looks like\nsupporting your needs and valuing your\nselfworth it could be calling a friend\nwhen you need support it could be\nresting or knowing when your body needs\nto slow down or take it a moment of rest\nor it can mean moving your body when it\nfeels stressed or overwhelmed this\npillar of self-care building in moments\nof self-care is so important especially\nwhen you come from a home where you\ndidn't see your parents taking care of\nthemselves or their bodies this is your\nopportunity to build that practice or to\nreparent yourself through self-care the\nsecond pillar is called loving\ndiscipline loving discipline involves\ncreating new habits or new boundaries\nwith ourselves by making and keeping\nsmall promises I want to emphasize the\nsmallness of the promise this could be\nan activity and exercise that takes us\nanywhere from one to five minutes a day\nno more than 10 minutes the smallness of\nThis Promise is so important because it\nallows the promise to be approachable so\nthat we can begin to build trust or\nfollow through with our own word so many\nof us have made a million promises to\nourselves created a million different\nroutines that we weren't able to keep\ntried to set a boundary and taken it\nright down so if we've self- betrayed or\nneglected our care in those ways make\nthe commitment to making and keeping\nsmall promises it could look like\nreading five pages in a new book or\nsitting in Stillness for two minutes\nmaybe stretching for five minutes or\ntaking five deep belly breaths or\njournaling for 3 to 5 minutes the third\npillar of reparenting is called\nemotional regul ation this is the\nability to navigate our emotional states\nin flexible in tolerant in adaptive ways\nreally simply being responsive instead\nof reactive when we start to feel that\noverwhelming fight ORF flight reaction\nour blood starts to race our muscles\nbecome tense we want to scream and yell\nor run away in that moment we can\npractice pausing doing three deep slow\nbelly breaths maybe putting your hand on\nyour belly to help help you out calming\nyour body through your breath will help\ncalm your mind it'll help give you\naccess to that new response rather than\nrelying on that old habitual reaction\nnow emotional regulation as I'm sure\nmany of you are thinking or have the\nexperience it is not easy but the more\nyou practice the more you'll develop\nself- trust and self-confidence in your\nability to navigate your emotions\nresponsibly the fourth pillar of\nreparenting\nis rediscovering a sense of childlike\nWonder or awe this is learning how to\nplay being spontaneous creating moments\nfor creativity and finding joy in the\nsimple things all of those states are\nreally natural for children but as we\nage we often lose touch with those\nthings I mean even think about the\nmessages that you received growing up\ndid you see your parents play did they\nsay anything about play or the\nappropriateness of play or is everything\nfocused on work were they creative do\nthey always want you to do something\nproductive or always focused on your\nachievements because that was the case\nfor so many of us it is so important to\nbegin to practice doing things without\nan agenda without a focus on a specific\noutcome doing things simply because we\nenjoy them and this can look like\nfinding a new hobby taking a lesson and\nsomething that you've been interested in\nfor a while it could also look like\nputting aside some time to draw create\nor build something or maybe even\nlearning a new language now of course\nthese practices might be difficult at\nfirst some of you might not even\nunderstand what it is that you like or\nwhat you want to do what your passions\nare be patient with yourself and spend\nsome time in\nself-discovery take the time that you\ndidn't get in childhood to explore and\nto ReDiscover who you really are use\nthese pillars as a blueprint for\nreparenting yourself make that daily\nsmall commitment to check in with\nyourself and to take the small steps\nevery day in reparenting being patient\nwith yourself as you heal the leftover\nwounds from your childhood I want to\nhear from you have any of you practiced\nreparenting yourself let me know how\nit's going in the comments"
