    "transcript": "imagine for a moment that you're stood\nin front of a busy road with traffic\ngoing both ways each of those vehicles\nrepresents a thought or a feeling coming\nin and out of your mind now you might be\nlike most other people and spend a good\ndeal of your time\nin the middle of that road trying to\ndirect the traffic there are some\nthoughts you want to hold on to right\nand there's others that you want to push\naway doing that causes more stress\nbecause the traffic just keeps on coming\nnow if i asked you to just\nstep back from the curb and watch the\ntraffic instead of trying to control it\njust allowing it to pass and watching as\nit goes that would be the process of\nmindfulness when you notice that you're\ntrying to hold on to certain thoughts\nand push others away see if you can step\nback from the traffic and let it pass"
