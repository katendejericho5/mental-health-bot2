    "transcript": "if you're struggling with your mental\nhealth i'm a psychologist and you need\nto hear this one of the most dangerous\nmisconceptions is that we all fit into\none of two boxes\nwell\nor unwell now here's the problem if you\nsee yourself as well and then you hit a\nperiod where you feel less than okay\nit's terrifying to speak out and get\nhelp for fear of being judged and put\ninto the other box and when you're\nhaving a tough time and you see yourself\nas unwell it's so hard to see a way out\nyou feel trapped in this box with this\nlabel but what if i told you it's not in\nboxes at all in reality it's a long\nspectrum that we're all constantly\nmoving along\nno one is immune from moving towards\nbeing unwell but crucially if you can\nmove in this direction then you can also\nmove in this direction and if you have\nbeen labeled as unwell there is hope\nthere are things you can do to start\nshifting your mental health towards\nwellness"
