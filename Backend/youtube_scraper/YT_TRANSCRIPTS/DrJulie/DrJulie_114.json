    "transcript": "now imagine this is you and these are\nall the bad things that happen to you so\neach one represents a memory of\ntraumatic experiences that you've been\nthrough and as you go about your life\nthe thing seems like it's overflowing\nmemories just keep falling out when you\ndon't want them to emotionally\noverwhelming you and you can't seem to\nfocus on the rest of your life so what\ncan we do about it well i'm a\npsychologist and this is what happens in\ntrauma therapy first of all a therapist\nwould gear you up with all the skills\nyou need to manage just how painful\nthose memories can be and then you take\none memory at a time\ncarefully open it up at your own pace\nand allow you to process that memory and\nthen\nyou can neatly fold it up\nyou do the same with the next one and\nthe next one until\nwhat you're left with\nis a neat little pile of memories that\nfit neatly at the bottom leaving you\nmore capacity to focus on the life that\nyou want to have today"
