    "transcript": "if you set yourself the rule that you\nshould only have positive thoughts i'm a\npsychologist and i want you to know that\nyou're setting yourself up to feel like\na failure here's why you can't control\nwhich thoughts pop into your head but\nwhat you can do is choose how long you\nspend with those thoughts once they\narrive and how much of your time and\nattention you give to them so when those\nnegative thoughts do arrive instead of\ncriticizing yourself for not being a\npositive person\nnotice the negative bias in the thought\nand make a careful choice about whether\nspending time with that thought is going\nto help you or hinder you"
