    "transcript": "I'm a psychologist and here's three\nthings you need to know about anxiety\nnumber one anxiety is not in control of\nyou and you don't have to be at the\nmercy of it there are skills you can\nlearn to bring down the intensity of\nanxiety so that you can feel more in\ncontrol and number two anxiety is not\npermanent when it feels like it's there\nall the time it's usually because it's\nbeing retriggered repeatedly either by\nsomething outside of us in the body or\nmaybe the thoughts that we're spending\ntime with and number three most\nimportantly anxiety is not something\nthat's wrong with you you're not\nmalfunctioning anxiety is a normal human\nemotion that everyone is wired to\nexperience when our needs for things\nlike safety and connection are not being\nmet so instead of seeing anxiety as the\ncore of the problem people do better\nwhen they see anxiety as a sign of those\nunmet needs"
