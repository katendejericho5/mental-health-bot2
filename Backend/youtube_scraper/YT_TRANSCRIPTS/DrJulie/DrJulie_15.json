    "transcript": "sh I'm a psychologist and here are four\nways I use psychology to get people to\nopen up in therapy number four kill\njudgment not conversation as soon as\nsomeone feels judged you've lost them so\nseek only to understand and number three\nuse open questions this means asking\nquestions that need more than a yes or\nno answer so instead of asking are you\nokay ask something like what's on your\nmind and number two when they finish\nspeaking reflect back what they' said in\nyour own words this gives them the\nchance to really feel heard and\ncrucially invites them to keep expanding\non it further and number one most people\nfeel extremely uncomfortable when\nsomeone cries so the natural instinct is\nto shut it down and round off the\nconversation but if you want someone to\nopen up you need to be able to sit with\nthat discomfort and allow the emotion to\nbe there without trying to make it go\naway"
