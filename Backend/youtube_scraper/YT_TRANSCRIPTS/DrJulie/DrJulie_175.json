    "transcript": "if you ever struggle with low mood and\nthen ask yourself why me why can't i\njust be happy like the next person i'm a\npsychologist and i want you to know that\neven when you're depressed there's\nnothing fundamentally wrong with your\nbrain\nlet me explain so your brain is this\ncomplex system just like say the weather\nand take england where it rains a lot\ncompared to spain where it hardly rains\nat all there's nothing fundamentally\nwrong with england there are just this\nset of conditions that make it more\nlikely to experience rain more of the\ntime\nand just small changes to those\nconditions can have a big impact on that\noverall system\nthe same is true for your brain if you\nstart making small changes to the\naspects of your life that influence your\nbrain you can set up this new pattern in\nmotion towards feeling very different"
