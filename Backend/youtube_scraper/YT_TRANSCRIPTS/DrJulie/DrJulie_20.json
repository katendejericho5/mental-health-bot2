    "transcript": "I'm Dr Julie and I want you to imagine\nthat this is the trauma you experienced\nin the past a big mistake people make is\nthey see trauma as something on its own\nthat's separate from the rest of your\nlife but when you try to maintain your\nrelationships it's there when you're\ntrying to build your career it's there\nand when you're trying to be with your\nfamily it's there it touches everything\nit's like a thread that's woven into the\nfabric of your life you can't escape it\nwhen you try to keep it away from one\narea of your life it gets tangled up\nwith something else and years later it\ncan feel like such a mess and by this\npoint trying to isolate the trauma just\ndoesn't work but here's what happens in\ntherapy we take each loose thread one at\na time and we work out how it's Tangled\nUp with the other aspects of your life\nand when you hit a block in one area you\ncan shift to another thread the key is\nto keep pulling where it moves until\nslowly the trauma loosens its grip on\nthe rest of your life"
