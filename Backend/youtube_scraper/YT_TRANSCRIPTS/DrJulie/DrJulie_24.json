    "transcript": "if you find yourself struggling to feel\nthat drive and satisfaction that you\nonce felt for your work I'm a\npsychologist and I want you to imagine\nfor a moment that this is you and these\nare all the people that you work with\nnow here's some of the traps that we all\nseem to fall into to save time you send\nan email to your colleague rather than\njust speak to them or to focus you put\nyour headphones on to be more efficient\nyou skip lunch with your colleagues and\nto be more productive you're working\nfrom home more and all of these things\nby themselves are fine but the more you\ndo them the more disconnected you feel\nfrom the people you work with gradually\nyou start losing that drive you once\nfelt however the research shows that\nwhen people start to prioritize time to\nget to know their colleagues again not\nonly professionally but personally they\nstart to build good quality trusting\nrelationships and they notice that\nbringing something as apparently\nunproductive as social connection can\nstart to reignite that drive and\nsatisfaction for work once again"
