    "transcript": "I'm a psychologist and here's something\nyour brain does that will destroy your\nday if you don't spot it in therapy I\nlike to call it the Domino mindset let\nme explain now every day you stack up\nlots of these small actions and many of\nthose are things you can feel good about\nfor example you meet that deadline and\nyou remember your friend's birthday but\nthen one small thing goes wrong and in\nyour mind this happens\nyou instantly write off the whole day so\nfrom this one small event you start to\ntell yourself that you've achieved\nnothing now I like to call this the\nDomino mindset but it's a cognitive bias\nalso known as over generalizing and it's\nsomething we all do but we tend to do\nmore of it when we're stressed or low in\nmood but while you can't stop it from\nhappening\nyou can take the power out of it simply\nby noticing those thoughts and labeling\nthem for what they are\nbiased"
