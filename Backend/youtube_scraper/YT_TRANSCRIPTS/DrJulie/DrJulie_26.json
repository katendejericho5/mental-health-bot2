    "transcript": "[Music]\nif you or someone you love has ever\nexperienced trauma I'm a psychologist\nand I want you to imagine for a moment\nthat you have this wound and the pain is\nunbearable so the most natural response\nis to keep it covered hide it away but\ninevitably people brush past that wound\nand they have no idea the pain that it\ncauses all they see are these intense\nemotional responses and to them it just\nseems like an overreaction and so to try\nand fit in and feel normal\nyou numb it maybe with drugs alcohol or\nstaying busy and that works\nfor now but it doesn't let the wound\nheal part of healing is to recognize how\nthat sensitivity and the intense\nemotions that come with it are not a\nfault in your personality they're a\nreaction to that past trauma and healing\nhappens best when we're safe to open\nthings up\nand take a look at what we're dealing\nwith"
