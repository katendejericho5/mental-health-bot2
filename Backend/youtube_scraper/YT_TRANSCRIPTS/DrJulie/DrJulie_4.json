    "transcript": "if you want to be at your best even when\nlife gets tough I'm a psychologist and\nhere's something I teach people in\ntherapy now you have five core defenses\nthat protect your well-being and I bet\nyou're going to say yes I do these\nalready but I guarantee when things get\ntough these are the first things you let\nslide and doing so is like leaving an\nopen goal on your own health our\nDefenders are social connection\nnutrition routine exercise and finally\nthe most crucial sleep now however\nstrong you think you are if you neglect\nthese core defenses your well-being will\ntake a hit but a strong defense doesn't\nhave to be complex you can keep track of\nwhich defenses might need your attention\nsimply by writing things down or using\nsomething like the Samsung Galaxy watch\n6 to track things and share personalized\nguidance which is great for staying\nconsistent with your tracking so that\neven when life gets busy nothing gets\nmissed"
