    "transcript": "here's the top four things not to say to\nsomeone with depression number four you\ndon't look depressed now depression\ndoesn't have a look someone can seem\nfine on the outside but be tearing\nthemselves apart on the inside number\nthree if I was depressed this is what I\nwould do now people are much more likely\nto act on suggestions if they've asked\nfor them so I would always ask for\npermission before sharing any advice\nnumber two don't worry you'll be fine\nnow we do this when we feel\nuncomfortable in the presence of their\nemotional pain so we just dismiss it and\nhope it goes away so instead allow them\nthe chance to talk about how they're\nfeeling without trying to make it\ndisappear number one you have no reason\nto be depressed other people have it so\nmuch worse and not being able to see the\nreasons doesn't mean they don't exist\nInstead try letting them know that if\nthey're not okay that matters to you"
