    "transcript": "when something traumatic happens that is\nso big and so painful that you just\ncan't bear to look at it the only thing\nyou can do is push it down this way no\none can see it and as long as you don't\nthink about it it's gone so you carry on\nwith life and it takes everything you\nhave to hold it under the surface but\nthen one small thing happens that\ntriggers the memory and\neverything comes to the surface and it's\ntoo much pain all at once so you lock it\nback up and you push it back down and\nthis can be the cycle that you have to\nlive through again and again and many\npeople are so frightened to go to\ntherapy because they think that is\nwhat's going to happen but in reality\nhere's how it actually happens we don't\noverwhelm you with everything we\ncarefully process the memories and all\nthe emotions that come with it in a way\nthat is safe and at your own pace so\nthat over time you can heal I'm a\npsychologist follow for more"
