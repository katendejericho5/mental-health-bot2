    "video_title": "3 Ways Past Trauma Can Show Up | Dr Julie",
    "transcript": "here's three ways that past trauma can\nshow up in your present\nnumber one is explosions of anger that\nseem to come out of nowhere and not just\na bit of anger but so intense that it\nfeels out of proportion to the thing\nthat triggered it number two it takes\nconstant effort to push painful memories\nto the back of your mind but as soon as\nyou let your guard down\nthose memories come out of nowhere hit\nyou so hard you can barely function and\nnumber three the withdrawal when things\nget too much the emotional shutters come\ndown and nobody can connect with you not\neven you you feel numb to the world"
