    "video_title": "Reason That You Can't Make A Change - Dr Julie",
    "transcript": "one of the reasons people always give up\nwhen they set themselves a new lifestyle\nchange is that they're either too rigid\nor too flexible so some people will say\ni'm gonna work out at seven a.m every\nday no matter what and\none day something happens they can't\nfulfill that and they're more likely to\nthen say well that doesn't really work\nout for me and then give up\nbut equally if they're too flexible\nlike if they say well i'll work out when\ni feel like it or when i have time then\nother things take priority because it's\nnot urgent\nthe trick is to mix the two so if you\ncan set yourself a non-negotiable\nsomething like\ni will work out for 20 minutes every day\nand then you set yourself a time but the\ntime is flexible so if you can't work\nout at 7am that day\nyou have to fit it in somewhere else in\nyour day but the working out for 20\nminutes is the non-negotiable"
