    "transcript": "if you see yourself as a bit of a people\npleaser i'm a psychologist and i want\nyou to imagine for a moment that this is\nyou\nevery time you allow someone to trample\nover your boundaries in order to be\nliked by them\nit's a bit like doing this\nand every time you change yourself just\nto keep others happy\nit's like that and when you betray your\nown values just to fit in\nit's a bit like doing that so you tell\nyourself it's not a big deal but over\ntime those small betrayals chip away at\nyour sense of self so that when life\ndemands that you show up as you there\nare so many gaps that you don't even\nknow who you are anymore\nyou're not sure who you want to be or\nwhat matters most to you because you've\nspent so much of your life putting\neveryone else first\nbut before things come tumbling down\ncompletely there is a way forward you\nsee when you start to prioritize\nyourself the way that you do with\neveryone else and every time you hold a\nboundary so that you can live by your\nown values it takes time but brick by\nbrick\nyou can start to rebuild"
