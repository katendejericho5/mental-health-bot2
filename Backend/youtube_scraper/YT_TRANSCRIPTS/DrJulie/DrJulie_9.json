    "transcript": "imagine for a moment that growing up the\nonly movies you ever saw were horror\nmovies you had no idea that any other\ntype of movie even existed so now as an\nadult when you come across a horror\nmovie there's some reassurance in the\nfamiliarity of that this is your only\ntemplate for how things are supposed to\ngo and it's much the same in\nrelationships we seek The Familiar so if\nyou only have experience of feeling\nunsafe growing up why would you expect\nanything different as an ad adult so\nwhat may have looked to others like a\npoor choice from your perspective maybe\ndidn't feel like a choice at all"
