    "transcript": "here's a quick tip from a psychologist\nif you're trying to help someone with\ndepression be careful you don't fall\ninto that trap of becoming the rescuer\nscooping somebody up can make you feel\nbetter but when you treat someone as\nfragile and you start taking on\nresponsibilities that they're still\nmanaging to do for themselves you can\nactually disempower and de-skill that\nperson and they lose even more\nconfidence in themselves instead it's\nbetter to help by supporting them to do\nthe things that they need to do for\ntheir recovery"
