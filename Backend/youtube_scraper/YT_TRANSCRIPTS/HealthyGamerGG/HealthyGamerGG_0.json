    "transcript": "the more time we spend dwelling on\nsomething the more likely we are to\nre-engage in some kind of action so this\nis where very practically what we want\nto do is spend time doing a postmortem\nand I encourage you all to think about\nthe times in your life when you screw up\nand we may dwell on things in a very\nnegative way but if you're like me we\ndon't really do a post-mortem right we\ndon't really think about things in a\nvery logical way what we tend to do is\nactually avoid it so anytime that I\nwould take a test for for example and\nthe test did not go as well as I wanted\nI was so frustrated that I would jump\nimmediately into something else and what\nwe literally do when I work with people\nwho are low performers or less\nsuccessful what I force them to do in my\noffice is a postmortem let's\nunemotionally look at the situation\nlet's not jump into a reflexive behavior\nlet's just spend some time monitoring\nthe outcome of our actions"
