    "transcript": "people are starting to have negotiating\npower and so people are leaving now\nwe're gonna see a selection pressure on\nmanagers which i think is a good thing\nyou get employees that don't recognize\nwhen they actually have a decent manager\nso they get so riled up by this stuff\nthis emotional stuff right you feel\nvictimized but you may not really\nrealize that\nyour manager because there's like\ncognitive bias here right there's ego\nand this is the other problem with these\nkinds of tick tocks is this person is\nsort of saying like employees aren't\nputting up with it anymore but like what\nhappened to the dude who quit if you\nquit a job because someone makes fun of\nharry potter like what does that mean\nfor your future does that just mean that\nany place where someone wants to\ncriticize harry potter you're not gonna\nwork there\n[Music]\ni don't know when we're finally going to\nunderstand that this new generation of\nworkers is not to be played around with\nyou and i'm saying if they don't like a\njob they will leave it gone van moose\nthey'll they will quit so fast a two\nweek notice is just a really funny joke\nto them at this point it's an urban\nlegend right my friend worked at baskin\nrobbins for two days right and my friend\nhad one specific rule do not make fun of\nharry potter right his manager said\nharry potter's stupid my friend said say\nthat again and i will quit right now and\nthe manager called the bluff he said\nharry potter stupid guess what my friend\ndid he got a scoop of mint chocolate\nchip and then got out of there the\nmanager had to close by himself my\nfriend said i will not be disrespected\nin the workplace i'm like look\nwhat right at our job right somebody\nsaid hey don't schedule me on mondays\nand guess what they did schedule them on\nmonday and guess what happened he's not\nworking mondays anymore because he quit\nexpeditiously he sent me a spongebob\nmeme that says i don't really feel like\nit that's the workplace nowadays respect\nyour workers please there are some\nthings\nabout this that i love and some things\nabout this that you got to be super\ncareful about\nso the first thing is that i think a lot\nof the problems in the workplace\nhave happened because\nthere have not been feedback mechanisms\nand power dynamics that\nhave mattered\nso like like oh sorry let me just\nrephrase that so the reason that this\nstuff persists is because there's no\nlike\nevolutionary\npressure against it\nso if we think about the theory of\nevolution there's like natural selection\nright which creates pressures that\nreward certain kinds of behaviors or\nselect for certain kinds of behaviors\nand then you know\nnegatively select for other kinds of\nbehaviors\nand what we've seen in the workplace for\na very long time is no selection\npressure and so when there's no\nselection pressure\nbad behaviors have started to propagate\nbecause there's nothing keeping them in\ncheck\nso you'll have these bosses that sort of\nlike\nwill lord their power their petty\ntyrants over their employees\nand so if employee says like don't make\nfun of harry potter instead of the boss\nbeing like a decent human being\nthe boss is like i can make fair fun of\nharry potter and there's nothing you can\ndo about it and furthermore what you're\ntelling me is a challenge to my ego\nbecause i'm the boss and you're the\nemployee and i don't think you\nunderstand how this relationship works\nyou don't tell me what to do i tell you\nwhat to do and i'm gonna demonstrate\nthat to you right now\nbecause i'm gonna make fun of harry\npotter again and then let's see what you\ndo\nand generally speaking that kind of\nbehavior was fine because there was no\nselection pressure against it right so\nif you look at like\nyou know curliness versus straightness\nof human hair\nto my knowledge the reason that we have\nboth is because there's no clear\nselection pressure for one versus the\nother\nso there are all kinds of attributes\nwhere you'll see like no selection\npressure so it's kind of like all sorts\nof random stuff so sometimes you get a\ngood boss sometimes you get a bad boss\nbut the bad bosses essentially aren't\npunished\nthere's no problem with it\nright and this is where you see things\nlike this on tick tock where where now\nworkers the power dynamic between\nworkers and employers is changing some\nso you're sort of starting to see people\nlike recognize that if i go somewhere\nelse like i actually don't need this job\nso i'm able to find a job that pays as\nmuch as you pay me and i don't have to\ndeal with your toxic ass\nso people are leaving\nso this is also creating all kinds of\ninteresting things in the workplace\nwhere\nyou know like as people are shifting\naround a lot and we've known this for a\nwhile that like moving jobs on a\nsemi-regular basis\nis on average the best strategy to\nmaximize your income\nnot just staying at one place over time\non average but then you've got to be a\nlittle bit careful because there are\nexceptions i mean it's not really a rule\nit's just on average whereas there are\nsome employers that you know sticking\nwith one\nplace for an extended period of time can\nbe very good and moving around a lot\nwill actually be worse\nso you got to be careful about some of\nthose truisms right because it's an\naverage it's not\nmay not apply to even 50 of people\nso we'll see things like this and then\nthe other thing that's happening is the\ninternet\nis\nsharing these kinds of stories and the\nreason that these stories do so well is\nbecause they validate and and we feel\nvindicated because we've been in that\nposition\nright where it's like oh my god like\nit's like that the justice boner that i\nget when i listen to that oh my god i\nremember i had that boss who's toxic to\nme and like i should have done that we\nsee this a lot actually in medicine\nso like this is where like you know\nduring the pandemic\nnursing\nwas stressed\nto a whole different level so nurses\nwere dealing with an unparalleled amount\nof work\nan unparalleled amount of toxicity\nof people in the icu i have friends that\nare icu nurses that like\nyou know their\nfamily comes in\nsomeone's dying of covid and is on a\nventilator and family is like they don't\nhave covet\ncovet is a hoax y'all are crazy\ntries to get bleach or ivermectin or\nlike whatever other kind of like stuff\nand the doctors are like that doesn't\nwork\nand they're like first of all they don't\nhave covet\nsecond of all ivermectin is the best\ntreatment for covet\nthird of all i don't care about your\nmedical degree\ni brought them to the hospital because i\ndon't believe in what you do\nand they're on the ventilator because\nyou guys are completely clueless\nand then it's like just so damn\nconfusing\nright it's like if you don't believe in\nmedicine like why are you here\nwell\ni i don't know if you don't believe in\nkovid why are you wanting to give him\nivermectin to treat coven\nthere's just like in the nurses\npoor nurses are on the front line of\nthis stuff\nthey have to deal with this stuff day in\nand day out so they start getting burnt\nout\nthen what happens is everyone calls them\nheroes\nit's like the nurses aren't heroes\nthey're sacrifices right so like it's\ngreat to call the cannon fodder on the\nfront lines\nlike\nit's great to call them heroes like\nthat's wonderful like let's call him\nhere it's like we really appreciate the\nwork you do are you gonna pay us more no\nin fact there's some weird contraction\nof certain kinds of services during the\npandemic right so elective surgeries for\nexample pay a lot but we had to stop\nelective surgeries because everyone's\ndying of covet so we're getting money\nfrom the government\nnurses are maybe getting some kind of\nhazard pay maybe not and then what\nnurses realize is that\nsome places are stressed\nokay and like they're like we\ndesperately need nurses because we have\na thousand patients and we have a\nthousand nurses and that doesn't work\nso then we started seeing like travel\npay increase\nso then nurses realized like okay i'm\nmaking\nlet's say 80 000 a year here\nand i can be a travel nurse and get paid\nthree times as much\nso like i know nurses that made 300\ngrand in the us during the pandemic\nand that's because they were travel\nnurses and then like employers get super\nupset\nbecause all their nurses are leaving\nbecause some places are starting to pay\nlike ridiculous amounts of money you\neven see legislation getting passed in\nplaces like texas where it now becomes\nillegal to be a travel nurse you can't\nleave anymore\nyou can't accept a job in another\nstraight state which is like wow\nyou also see this with residents right\nso\nmedical residents for those of you that\ndon't know like we basically are like\nindentured servants\nso i once calculated that when i was in\nresidency my first year i got paid\nsomething like three dollars an hour or\nsomething like that and so what happens\nis in residency like you have no you\nhave no option to move so you sign like\na four-year contract and if you don't\nlike it like there's you just can't find\na job somewhere else so part of the\nreason that residents get paid very\nlittle and like can't don't really\nadvocate for themselves because they\ncan't they have no negotiating power\nand so what's happening now is like\npeople are starting to have negotiating\npower and so people are leaving\nand like now we're going to see a\nselection pressure on managers which i\nthink is a good thing\nbecause now managers like have a choice\neither you can be an [ __ ] manager you\ncan be a good manager and then the next\nthing and this is this is the thing so i\nthink like all this stuff is good\nbecause there hasn't been selection\npressure\nthat\nhas allowed managers to be essentially\nlike\nbad human beings and like not treat\ntheir employees with respect\nthe\ndownside\nthe real downside that i've seen with\nthis is that sometimes\nyou get employees that don't recognize\nwhen they actually have a decent manager\nso they get so riled up by this stuff\nthis emotional stuff right you feel\nvictimized but you may not really\nrealize that\nyour manager because there's like\ncognitive bias here right there's ego\nand so you may not realize that like\nit's not that your manager is being\ntoxic it's that you continue to screw up\nat work and they're actually trying to\nhelp you and so the third time that they\nbring you into their office and and talk\nto you about it you feel disrespected\nand then like you're like f this i'm out\nthe door and this is the other problem\nwith these kinds of tick tocks is this\nperson is sort of saying like\nyou know employees aren't putting up\nwith it anymore\nbut like what happened to the dude who\nquit like what happened to the harry\npotter\nthe dude who quit when someone made fun\nof harry potter\nand this is what like concerns me right\nis if you're\nlike i can sort of like i i can get the\nsort of sense of social justice there\nand it's like if people are gonna\ndeliberately disrespect you that sounds\nlike a toxic work environment you should\nprobably leave\non the other hand\nif you quit a job because someone makes\nfun of harry potter like what does that\nmean for your future does that just mean\nthat any place where someone wants to\ncriticize harry potter you're not going\nto work there\nlike what if they just have a valid\ncriticism of harry potter and has\nnothing to do with trying to you know\ncreate some kind of power dynamic to\ndisrespect you and put you in your place\nright so because that's the way that\nthese things are framed\nright it's like the boss like looked at\nme and they're like\nharry potter sucks\nand it's\nyou know\ni don't doubt that the person who was on\nthe receiving end of that\nfelt that that's what's going on but\nthat may not have been what was going on\nright so like maybe what's going on is\nthe\nthe person your boss just doesn't like\nharry potter and like what they're not\nallowed to make entertainment choice\ncriticisms\nlike oh i dislike the wire say that one\nmore time and i quit\nwhat bro i don't like the wire i'm out\nof here\nit's like hold on a second is that what\nwe're really talking about because i can\nabsolutely see the first scenario\nhappening which we talked about because\ni've seen that where you have petty\npower struggles from managers that are\nlike trying to put you in their place\nbecause they have a big ass ego\nand like want to show you who's boss and\nshould you quit in that situation\nabsolutely teach him a [ __ ] lesson\nbut\nwhat we're also seeing is people who are\ncompletely intolerant and are like\nquitting jobs at the drop of a hat and i\njust don't know what their employment\nprospects are like for the person who\nquits like what is did they pay their\nmortgage at the end of the month do they\nhave a mortgage like what are their\npersonal relationships like\nare they you know like is and this is we\nsee this right we see this on like\nplaces like tinder and bumble and dating\nsites where it's like refuse to date\nanyone who does not love harry potter\nyou need to be this tall make this much\nmoney and have to love harry potter by\nthe way you can't just love harry potter\nyou have to be a gryffindor or ravenclaw\nno hufflepuffs no slytherins\nand so what\nwhat does that mean for that person so\nthis is like the the this is what i\nthink is the problem with sort of like\nthese kinds of tick tocks is like i can\nget behind them i absolutely can because\nthere are power dynamics in workplaces\nthere are power dynamics that have gone\nunchecked for far too long and sometimes\nwhen your ego gets out of whack as an\nemployee and you think that someone is\nintentionally disrespecting you whereas\nlike let's remember in the grand scheme\nof human communication sometimes people\ndon't intend to hurt you in any way\nsometimes you're sensitive\nand sometimes like conflict resolution\ninstead of grabbing a cup of mint\nchocolate chip ice cream and walking out\nthe door is like a healthier long-term\nstrategy\nright\ni'm not saying that it doesn't feel good\nand i'm not saying you shouldn't do it\ni'm just saying like be careful if\nthat's your default\nright like oh like\nwhat's better tacos or burgers\nif you say tacos i'm a quit\nit's like okay\nso be careful\n[Music]\nso i think this is also like a great\nexample of what we're seeing in sort of\nlike the corporate wellness\nand corporate mental health space\nis\nso everyone's like\nwe gotta focus on wellness\nbut the problem that i see is that\nwellness is like the tack on feature\nright it's like i'm gonna make a single\nplayer game and then i'm gonna tack on\nmultiplayer functionality\nthat's different from making a\nmultiplayer game\nso we see this a lot also like even in\nthe you know i i kind of learned this\nvery well at the game developers\nconference a couple weeks ago\nwhere it's like you know people will\nlike game developers are now thinking\nabout okay we want like positive\ncommunities\nright but they sort of say that at the\nend\nand they're kind of saying like oh like\nwe need more positivity in our community\nwhen it comes to the game design\nmicro transactions are critical in the\ndesign of the game we want to make a\ngame that is so micro transaction\nfriendly that is built on micro\ntransactions so the design happens early\non\nright we want to make a great game by\nthe way let's include micro transactions\nwhere the micro transactions where's the\nsubscription where's the battle pass\nyou know how are we gonna how are we\ngonna monetize this and then towards the\nend 90 through you've made your game you\nfigured out how you're gonna charge your\nplayer base you figured out you're gonna\ncustomize armor and sell cosmetics and\nthis kind of stuff by the way when we're\ndeveloping character models we need to\nbe easily be able to swap out cosmetics\nthat's a core functionality that we need\nto think about at the beginning of the\ngame\nand when it comes to like positive\ncommunities they're like ah\nwe're seeing all this stuff about toxic\nwork environments and like toxic gaming\ncommunities and there's the the female\ngamer market that we want to tap into so\nwe need some kind of like let's tack on\nsome positivity at the end so they go to\nthese developers and they're like hey we\nneed some online\npositive community kind of stuff\nand so the developers are like okay like\nwe tack it on as an afterthought so we\ndon't really think about community as a\ncore feature of the game we think about\nit as something that we tack on now\nthere are games that think about core\ncommunity is core features of the game\nso the best example of this is like the\ndevelopment of the massively multiplayer\nonline rpg\nbecause community is a huge part of that\nwhat would an rpg be like\nif it was massively multiplayer not just\na multiplayer rpg like baldur's gate 2\nwhere each person can control one\ncharacter but one person can control all\nthe characters but if you have a game\nthat is designed\nfrom being multi for being multiplayer a\ngame where if you want to beat the last\nboss\nyou have to find 39 other people and\ncooperate that with them in a\nsubstantial and meaningful way so that's\nawesome right so that's community\nthat is built into the design and what\nwe see right now in like\nwork environments and corporate\nenvironments i say this is someone who's\nlike a consultant for these people right\nso sometimes they'll call me in less so\nnowadays\nmaybe on the upswing a little bit but\nthen like a couple years ago before he\nwas a big thing this is what i used to\ndo for people so i ran\na program that trained 650 people in\nresilience skills a year\nand so then i started working with\ncompanies and they'd be like you know\nhey we want we want like a wellness\nprogram so i'd be like cool like let's\nbuild a wellness program and so they\ntend to do is they call an outside\nconsultant to then makes recommendations\nand they'll go to people like hr and\nthis isn't hr's fault this is just like\nwhat hr is\ntasked to do right so your ce ceo goes\nto hr and says\nhey people are complaining about burnout\nwe need to do something about it and\nthen the hr person does their job\nright they look at what's out there they\nread some scientific papers they like\nlook at industry stuff and they're like\noh meditation helps reduce burnout let's\nget everyone a subscription to a\nmeditation app\nlet's get everyone like access to an eap\nemployee assistant programs those are\ngood i'm not you know they're not wrong\nbut they're also like tacked on right\nand then what happens is like\nbox is checked we're done\nso ceo goes to hr and says hey we need a\nsolution for burnout\nhr is like this is what google and\nmicrosoft and\nthese other companies are doing they\nhave meditation stuff we can get a\nsubscription to a meditation app we'll\ntell our all employees to meditate we'll\ngive them a food stipend which can\nbe valuable right we're going to buy\nthem a starbucks gift card\nand we're set\nbecause when it comes to the design of\nthe job like wellness isn't really\nconsidered\nright because like 401k no that costs\ntoo much money or like\nworking for five days a week work from\nhome is a great example of this\nwhere it's like what's the cost of\nworking from home this is like what's\nterrifying for people\nor by people i mean like managers and\nceos and commercial real estate\nuh building owners\nright he's like we got to get people\nback in the office because\nbut no one's been in the office it's not\nlike the world ground to a halt the\nstuff that ground to a halt like ground\nto a halt because of covid but you have\na lot of like you know\nno accountants\nstopped working because of covet\nlike consultants kept working investment\nbankers kept working there was plenty of\nstuff going on in distressed investing\nlike people kept working like even\npeople moved to like telemedicine\nright\nand so now it's like like that's great\nfor wellness because\ni don't i just have to get my work done\ni don't have to spend 45 minutes driving\nto work 45 minutes coming back from work\nlike work from home is the worst\nwellness initiative i mean is the best\nwellness initiative that's ever happened\nbecause it actually makes a substantial\nimpact in people's lives\nand it's not tacked on\nso what i tend to see with companies\nthat i work with people that i work with\nwho are at companies\nis that if you really want to tackle\nwellness like you know things like\nemployee assistance programs even\nstarbucks with gift cards like there are\nplaces that you know you'll see this as\nwell like on the internet like this\nplace my workplace charges me 50 cents\nfor every cup of coffee\nthat certainly doesn't help and on the\nflip side you know like we're like we're\ngonna give you a starbucks gift card it\ndoesn't feel like it's enough which sort\nof makes sense because it's not enough\nit's something but it's not enough\nand so this is something that we're\nseeing a lot where people are not\nthinking about wellness\nfrom the get-go\nit's not baked into how you do work how\nwe do work is\nalready established we're gonna do as\nmany mergers and acquisitions as we can\nthis\nyear we're going to do a lot of deals\nwe're going to do big deals\npeople don't think about\nmental wellness as like a resource that\ngets depleted so we think about\nfinancial capital\nright we think about how much money do\nwe have to spend\nwe think about things like\nspace as capital as well like how big of\nan office do we need can we afford to\nuse this space for this kind of thing we\nthink about time as a resource how many\nhours can we work sort of right or like\nhow many deals can we get done but then\nthe problem is that when it comes to\nlike human wellness\nlike how many deals we can pack into one\nteam\nwe don't think about what that's going\nto do to the team and we see this a lot\nin the tech industry\nso crunch\nhas become a norm\nright and what happened is crunch used\nto be something that happened every now\nand then\nlike not every now and then like\nhappened every year there's gonna be\ncrunch before a big launch but then what\nhappened is crunch started happening\nlike more and more and more and more\nand the people at the top stopped caring\nabout crunch right they're like it gets\ndone\nthis game needs to release on this date\nthis is our launch we need the revenue\nwe need this we have investors we have\nshareholders it needs to launch on this\ndate and you work you do whatever you\nneed to to get it done i don't care\nthe good news is that there are a lot of\ngood employers out there like i've met a\nton of people senior software developers\nthings like that who genuinely care\nabout their employees\nright we even had an interview a couple\nweeks ago where like someone's boss is\nlike bro you're working too much\nyou don't need to do this on the weekend\nlike stop\nright you do have employers who care you\nhave managers who care like they're\nabsolutely out there and they're not\nlike rare they're not like purple\nunicorns\nthey're like out there for sure\ni don't even want to say close to 50 i\nhave no idea where that number's coming\nfrom but there are a lot of decent\npeople out there you know and just think\nabout yourself for a second like what do\nyou prioritize with the people that you\nwork with do you actually care about\nthem\nthe problem is that that caring\ndoes is not built into the structure of\nwork\nright so like good examples of this are\nlike the 40-hour work week which now\nlike people some countries are piloting\na four-day work week\nand even if you work for i once again\nwith nurses\ni talk to nurses so a lot of nurses in\nmassachusetts are unionized\nand they'll a full-time nursing job is i\nthink actually just 32 hours of work per\nweek that's considered full-time\nand so what they'll do is like they'll\nwork four eights\nor like\nthree or 32 or 36 or something like that\nit's less than 40.\nso they have like the option of like if\nthey have to work 36 hours they'll work\nlike\nfour\neight hour days and one four hour shift\nor what they'll do is work three twelves\nso they'll work 12 hours a day three\ndays a week and that's considered a\nfull-time job so that's like a good\nexample of how like you can modify\ntiming\nand still get a productive amount of\nwork like a proper amount of work in\nbut like be so much better in terms of\npeople's like wellness and their family\nand stuff like that right because some\npeople have kids and it's like i'm a\nnurse i'm married to a nurse i work\nthree days a week i work three twelves\nmy husband works three twelves\nwe're fine\nright so i work monday tuesday wednesday\nhe works thursday friday saturday\nand it's fine but the problem is that we\ndon't think about this\nduring the actual conception of work we\ndon't think about\nour workers wellness and energy when\nwe're designing a job and so\nthis is what's going to happen\nright we just get stuff tacked on and i\ndon't think it needs to be like this the\nthing that's the real tragedy here is\nthat i think employers can actually do a\nlot better without making gigantic\nfinancial sacrifices because ultimately\nlike what they see is like some kind of\nheavy financial problem because if\nthere's a problem that you don't really\nthink about from start to finish\none solution that you're going to end up\nwith is throwing money at it so it's\njust kind of like that's the default\nsolution whereas you don't need to throw\nmoney at it you just need to think about\nit ahead of time and actually make\norganizational changes that are\nefficient which is absolutely possible\nwe just need to focus on it some\nquestions does that make sense to people\nbecause i think it's not going to work\nas long as we're just tacking on\nwellness\nso you're saying it's really a systemic\nissue absolutely this is an easy\nquestion how do you make middle managers\ngood people\nvery easy\nthe first thing that you do\nis you in your recruitment process look\nfor good people\nso right now if you think about what\ngoes on a resume\nall that goes on resume is results\nright so this is where like i've had you\nknow i've worked with a lot of people\nwho\nyou know have started to ask questions\nor started to look for people like even\nwho people who are high up at very\nprestigious institutions they'll start\nto try to get a sense of like how does\nthis person work with their employees\nwhat are the you know what's your\nrelationship like with them how did you\nget these results results what did it\ncost the people under you to get these\nresults\nbut everyone's focused on results no\none's focused on the cost of results\nthat's number one so just pay attention\nto it\nnumber two is you reward them for being\ngood managers\nright so this is something that i had to\nsort of make this argument and it was a\nreal really easy argument to make\nso i was working for a\nfinancial institution\nand i was trying to explain to them that\nthey need to treat their employees\nbetter it's like your employees are\nburnt out like that you all need to do\nmore about that like significantly and\nthen they were like\nno we don't right so i asked them i was\nlike what's the cost of burnt out\nemployees\nwell\nthere isn't one like they either do the\nwork or they don't do the work and they\nget fired oh interesting okay\nso\nis getting fired the only way reason\nthat people leave oh no like a lot of\ntimes people leave like we've got you\nknow\nsometimes people leave because they\nthink they have better opportunities oh\ninteresting\nwhat percentage of people leave\noh like you know like last year we had\none person really solid performer rising\nstarted left that one hurt\noh interesting how many people do you\nhave to leave what's the cost of people\nleaving what's the cost of turnover\nthe cost of turnover is high now we have\nto get a new person we have to train\nthem up like you know we like a lot of\nthe good ones leave\ninteresting why is that\nwell people just offer them more money\nhow do you know that\nwell because that's how it works it's\nlike okay let's try talking to them\nwhen you try talking to them what you\nfind is that\nyou know money is important but for a\nlot of like people who want to do good\nwork like they'll they'd be willing and\nyou think about it yourself i don't know\nhow much money you make if you're\nwatching this\nbut\nthink about the worst boss that you've\never had and think about the best boss\nthat you've ever ever had\nand would you take a 10\ncut in your pay to trade the worst boss\nin the world for the best boss in the\nworld\nand generally speaking human beings are\nokay with you know not making maximizing\nthe most money if there's like a good\nwork environment\neasy right people are saying yes\nabsolutely so google figured this out\nwhen they started paying their\ndevelopers less slightly less than\nmarket rates but treating them well\nso it was like i remember like back in\nthe day\nlike the google cafeteria was like a\nmythical place that if you knew someone\nat google and they could take you as a\nguest and google wouldn't charge them a\n[ __ ] penny brilliant\nright i'm going to take you to this\nawesome cafeteria because you're you're\nmy friend\nthis is the privilege of being friends\nwith me because i work at google that's\nawesome\ni have access to this sweet thing that\nisn't going to cost you a penny is going\nto be the best food that you're going to\neat today\nand it's free\nthey treat people right right and then\nyou say but google pays like 35 more\nthan most people employers in my\nprofession yeah so they don't so\ncompared to some other companies they\nhad started paying a little bit less and\nthis is my whole point is that\nyou can pay 35\nabove average\nand treat your employees well and how\nthe hell does that work\nhow is that financially possible it's\nbecause\nget ready for it i know this is going to\nsound kind of weird it's going to sound\nweird\nwhen you have happy employees who enjoy\ncoming to work and enjoy doing a good\njob when they receive praise when they\nreceive reward when they receive\nfeedback when you give them\nopportunities to grow when you give them\nopportunities to learn new new things\nthey will actually out produce the [ __ ]\nout of a burnt out\ncrusty\nyou know like\nfried employee\nand you will make a hundred percent more\nthan your competitor and then you can\nafford to pay your employees 35 more\nthis is what employees don't understand\nso they try to like here's a starbucks\ngift card and a meditation app\nsubscription\nthey don't understand that they're like\nshooting themselves in the foot\nand you see this right like with like\nyou'll see this like places like doctors\nwithout borders where people like come\nthere and they like work\nbased on a mission\nand then like what's the best is that\nwhen this is the other thing that some\ncompanies learn how to do is if\nsomeone's mission oriented\nthen that means we can pay them less so\nwe're going to take advantage of this\nand this is what sucks about a lot of\nthe medical profession the worst though\nis the teaching profession\nat least in the u.s\nwhere like we take your desire to like\ngive kids a positive experience and\nwe're gonna pay you crap\nbecause we know we can take advantage of\nyour desire to like make the world a\nbetter place the wild thing is that you\ndon't have to this is where like\nthankfully we live in a world where one\nplus one equals three so this is where\nlike some of the stuff about capitalism\ni don't entirely agree with i'm not an\nexpert in\neconomics but i do believe that when\nhuman beings\ncome together and work together they\nactually generate more value\nthan\neither one can generate on their own\nand i think that's where\nlike\nthe extra money comes from it's not like\nevery every dollar\nthat someone else makes is a dollar that\ni'm not making it's like you and i like\none plus one can actually equal three\nwe can come together and outperform\nlike what either of us could do on our\nown\nand so this is the wild thing is that if\nyou get people who are driven and you\ntreat them well like they will do\namazing work\nand this is what we see about i mean you\nknow we've seen this some\nlike we see it in our community we see\nit in our team\nlike you guys look at this setup and\nmaybe they disagree maybe they think\nthey're being treated poorly but\nyou know\nlike that we try to treat them well\nand i think they do a phenomenal job\nlike the people\nwho work here are awesome and we try to\ndo the best that we can by them\nand it's possible i've seen tons of\ncompanies do it like hopefully you all\nhave had good jobs where people treat\nyou right\nright and it's like we're not\nwe're not going to nickel and dime stuff\nit's like\nyou know\nyou're coming here to work like eat\nwhatever you want to for lunch\ndon't worry about it\nmaybe they just don't tell me right so\nmaybe i'm maybe i'm blind to it\nso this is the kind of thing where i\nthink if you're an employer like think\nabout this\nthink about the way that you treat your\nemployees recognize that wellness is not\nsomething that is tacked on at the end\nwellness is something that is baked into\nthe structure of a job\nand it's as simple as\nyou know\nnot all work is the same for all people\nso this is like a huge revelation\nso you can have two people in the same\njob\nthat have the same roles but they\nwhat they like doing is different so you\ncan just manage that\ndifferently right so there's like\nnot going to go into too much detail but\nthis is also where\nsometimes like so as especially in like\nresidency for example so residency in in\nthe medical culture is one where\nyou've got people under you right so you\nhave the attending who's at the top\nthey've got a resident who does the\nworst work\nand then the resident passes on the\nworst work to the intern\nsome of that work the intern has they\npass on to the medical student if\nthey're competent enough to do it\nso we have a saying in medicine that\n[ __ ] rolls downhill\nso i thankfully trained at a place where\nthat was not the case\nand what my superiors did is take the\nworst work from me\nand they were like you know what i can\nsee you don't like doing this like you\nshould go home you've had a long day i\nwill stay late and i'm your boss\nand there are some attendings who do\nthat and some attendings who don't\nright and so then like i learned i was\nlike oh wow like i should ask people\nwhat part of their job do they enjoy\nand what part of the job do they not\nenjoy\nokay you don't like doing this\nparticular thing then i will do it\nso this is the thing about leadership is\nthat\neverything is your responsibility but\nwhat we tend to find is that people will\npass off the worst work to people\nbeneath them due to a power dynamic\nwhereas i was lucky enough to have\npeople who like tanked it\nright\nand that's what you can also do like the\nworst work doesn't have to go downhill\nyou know like if you're a manager like\nyou can unclog a toilet just like a\njunior person can\nand so i think that it's absolutely\npossible to create a healthy work\nenvironment\nit's just you have to think about it\nright you have to really think about\nwhat what do we reward people for what\ndo we care about what do we prioritize\nyou know another just random example of\nthis before i move on\nis sometimes\nwhen i'm doing something i don't do like\ncouples counseling much\nbut when i do couples counseling\none member\nso i'll teach people how to listen and\nvalidate right so i'll say like you know\nif your spouse is having a hard day or\nthey're complaining about you not doing\nsomething\nyou know you can validate that\nyou can validate that you can say yeah i\ncan totally see how it's like\nfrustrating when i just let the trash\noverflow instead of taking it out\nright because then you have to clean it\nup like i just toss it in it bounces out\nof the trash can ends up on the floor\nand then you end up picking it up that\nsounds incredibly frustrating\nthat's so hard for people to do\nbecause\nin couples counseling it's like but then\ni'm wrong and they're right\nand i can't have that\nright there's sort of this idea that\nlike you can't give an inch\nin couples counseling\nbecause if you admit anything if you\nvalidate their perspective if you\nunderstand their perspective\nthat means that they're right and if\nthey're right that means you're wrong\nand we cannot have that\nand so sometimes a marriage becomes a\ncompetition between one person being\nright and one person being wrong\nand so the only way you can have a\nwinner in that relationship is to have a\nloser\nand we see this with employment as well\nwhere it's like if i let my employees\nwork from home they're going to slack\noff and i will lose\nanything this is the basic problem with\nwork environments nowadays\nis that there's become an antagonistic\nrelationship between workers and\nemployers\nand the employer has started to think\nany inch i get like if i give them an\ninch they're going to take a mile\nand employ employees feel this too where\nit's like if i give them an inch they'll\ntake a mile\npeople have stopped caring about each\nother there's been like a loss of\ncollaboration and an increase in\nantagonism the cool thing is that when\nyou do reflective listening and you\nvalidate your partner in a marriage both\nof you win\nit doesn't necessarily mean you're wrong\njust means that you understand\nyou"
