    "transcript": "i think there's it's first of all\ncompletely acceptable to set sort of\nboundaries on what is acceptable\ncommunication and what is not acceptable\ncommunication but what pushes people to\ndo this why do i don't know that people\npretend to be stalkers that's just what\nthey're that's just the manifestation my\nguess is that they want to be noticed\nkind of like when the kid in class acts\nup to get attention of the class\nyeah in the future and and oftentimes\nthe kid who acts up doesn't quite know\nwhat drives them to act up they just\nknow that they\nneed to be\nyou know they act up so when do you plan\nto throw that food back up you're fat\nfat girls shouldn't eat hey what is the\nsong what is a song how does it feel to\nbe a stripper for 10 year olds and that\nwas before i had the poll so i don't\nknow what they're talking about i'm not\ngoing to ask about the farts for a\nthousand dollars in a jar debating\nasking about it i can send you some jars\nbefore the novelty effect just like a\nlittle you don't even have to open it\njust like to sit on your little shelf\nback there as a souvenir\n[Music]\nhello\nhi i'm still getting your\nvideo on my screen let's see\nall right how are you though i'm doing\nwell i'm really looking forward to the\nweekend i've had a busy week in a busy\ncouple weeks\nhow about yourself really good yeah i've\nbeen staying busy too got my game show\ncoming up\nin may that i'm hosting\ncan you tell me about that\nuh it is going to be\ncalled streamer royale the bunch of\ndifferent streamers we've got like xqc\nmoist critical\njack manifold\nwow me too\nmiss kif says yes austin is going to be\nthere too\num\nyeah a lot of people so many people\nwe're still adding more so\nand and what is the what is the nature\nof the game show\nuh it's gonna be\na series of physical challenges i don't\nwant to give away too much of course\nyeah\nthat sounds intriguing\nyeah competition style that's very cool\nokay so we're going to be looking at\nband appeals today\nwe are yes we are so should we dive in\nor you want to lay ground rules or how\ndoes this work\num\nwe can we can dive into them\nare you a mod in my\nproblem probably should just mod you i\ndon't think you're mod that way you can\nsee band appeals too okay where do i go\nuh once i mod you there'll be like a\nlittle sword icon\nat the bottom of the chat\nwhich chat\nmy chat\nso i should go to\nso i might be able to just link you the\nurl let me see\ni will go to\nhold on let's do this\ni think i modded\nokay\nhold on\ntechnically i can just link this to you\ndoes that work for you i've linked it in\nthe discord chat\num let me see\nwork work work fingers crossed amaranth\nyes\ni see a window\nyeah\nand um there's a way to sort them at the\ntop as soon as i see uh\nlike latest first oldest first i like to\ngo by oldest first okay and and is this\nokay if i show this on stream\nyes i mean i'm gonna show it on stream\ntoo okay so i'm just i want to be um\n[Music]\ncareful about\nuh\nyou know because people will be able to\nsee who we're talking about right if we\nshow it on screen i crop out um their\nusernames and profile pictures\nis how i do it like i crop out the\nentire left column of that window where\nit has like the list and i just focus on\nthe actual\nokay\nso since i have not done that i'm not\ngoing to show it on my screen can you\nscreen share with me\nuh it won't\nscreen share the cropped view here i'll\nshow you the cropped view in a sec when\ni have it so you can just perfect thank\nyou so much\nuh yeah are you reading them or yes\nwelcome to my insanity\nwell\nwe can pick the ones that you want to\nbecause i i think some of these are\npretty\ni i don't i don't know what yeah\num i did look through\njust a few of them there's been a lot\nmore seriously good i did a collab this\npast week with two other girls and you\nknow that always brings the weirdos uh\nwhen there's multiple girls in the\nstream so most of these i haven't seen\neither a few of them i did save for you\nthough like the really old ones maybe\nmaybe the first 10 or so are ones that\ni've seen before where i just thought it\nwas a\ninteresting evolution going down okay so\ni think i'm ready to start let's do this\nokay\nwhich one do you want to start with\nsanborn\nokay so like this is the oldest i'm just\ngoing by oldest\nall right let's take a look at this\nlook at that\num so\nlet's see this says\nwow\nyou want to read this out or\nyeah i'll read it okay sure\nwow money rules the world i swear she is\nmy dad's girlfriend i want to be my dad\nnow sometimes in life we are lucky to\nview things like this her dad probably\nwants some\nlike where does this\nyeah where does this come from can we\nstart by\ni don't even know if i understand what\nthis person is trying to say\ni don't either\nokay so so if we go through this so wow\nmoney rules the world\ni i don't understand what that what what\nis he talking about there\nuh\nthat's a great question you know\ni i would assume that probably just like\nyou know how they say like things people\ndo for money when they talk about\nstreamers or youtubers i'm probably\nsomething to that effect\nokay\nand all right so\nand then money rules the world so that's\njust and so i swear she is my dad's\ngirlfriend\ni want to be my dad now\nso that's bannable for you get a timeout\nright\nfor 600 seconds\njust because i think my my mod is like\nthis guy's kind of weird there's time to\nmount for being weird yeah\nthat in and of itself is not\nnecessarily\ni guess his dad has a girlfriend that\nlooks like you\nor maybe\nmaybe maybe i think the the abandonable\noffense was her dad probably wants some\nyeah so that's that's uh incest comment\nright that is an incest comment yes yes\nthat's pretty bannable right\nright\nyeah so i don't know how do you think a\nperson is if you had to guess\nuh i don't know maybe 20\n20. oh that's old okay\nhow old do you think they are uh like 12\nmaybe 13. for me what one some is\nprobably like a 14 year old at least 14\nterminology\nyeah i'm sorry but i'll be respectful\nthough i don't know i i i don't so is\nthere is there some kind of appeal\nwhere do we see the appeal oh the appeal\nis at the bottom it says i'm sorry but\ni'll be respectful thanks that's him\nappealing his chat history and you get\nto choose deny your unban so what do you\nthink\ni don't know honestly he probably he\ncould probably\nbe\nunbanned because it's not like a death\nthreat yeah but i'm just wondering\nwhat makes people\nsay incest comments\num\nthat's such a good question let me just\nthink about that for a second because\ni'm trying to understand\nsometimes in life we are lucky to view\nthings\nright what does that mean\ni mean\nlike this\nmaybe he maybe he was talking about he's\ntalking about you that we're lucky to\nview things like you\nmaybe\nprobably\nher dad wants to be his dad\nand he thinks that i'm his dad's\ngirlfriend\ni would only assume that\nso he is calling me attractive\nbut i could be wrong yeah so that's\nlet's talk about that for a moment\ncan we just spend a moment talking about\nthe different ways in which you can call\na woman attractive\nhe could just be like you look nice yeah\nbut so so\nyou were asking about why do people say\nthings like this\ni think it's because they don't know how\nto simply compliment someone right so we\nsee a lot of this weird passive\naggressive\nyou know\nin the in the pickup artist community\nthey call it negging\nwhich is when you insult someone when\nyou like them\nright and then sometimes you get i mean\ni guess sometimes it works my take on\nyou know that community is that they\ntend to have a bunch of techniques that\nwork on people who don't have a whole\nlot of confidence in themselves so\nthey're sort of like the selection bias\nand that's also why they kind of say\nlike you have to keep trying you have to\ntry it a hundred times yeah consult\npeople a hundred times eventually you're\ngonna find someone with low enough\nconfidence where it takes advantage of\ntheir psychological traumas and they\nrespond to you well in some way\nbut\ni mean i i think if what we're talking\nabout here is\nyou know if he wants to compliment you\nit's a weird way it's a weird way of\ndoing it\nmy guess is that this person has\nfeelings that they don't understand and\ni would agree they're they're frightened\nby their feelings\num\nand\nalso they don't know how to behave\nproperly but also i don't know if\nthey've ever had a role model about\nbehaving properly\nright um\nand i imagine that sometimes\nas many streamers do you excite\nparticular feelings in your audience\nwhich is why people get connected to us\nright i do too\num\ni tend to be merciful though so\ni mean if you feel like giving this\nperson a second chance i'm game\nwhat do you think yeah i think so\ni think so\nokay cool\nlet's do it\ndo it\ndid you click the button yeah i clicked\nthe button okay\nawesome\nstrong work what's next\nthis is uh kia's okay so we're just\ngoing down the line all right there we\nare okay let's do it\nis\nhe\ndid they bang overnight so i had s\nfendover for a collab and we did a sleep\nstream\nokay in my bed but obviously it was\nvery uh\nvery platonic\nbut why is that obvious\nit is obvious it should be obvious\nanyways but you know sometimes chat\ncan't handle when a man and a woman are\nin the same room together yes they think\nthat that can never be platonic yeah\nyes okay\num what is give it in my eyes\ni see that part is what i'm confused by\nalso i don't know if he meant like\ncoming in the eyes or\ni i don't i don't i don't know what that\nmeans either\nwhat is coming in the eyes\nhumi is like [ __ ] oh yeah yeah i\nguess i could have put that together\nokay hold on\nall right so let's let's\nokay so did they bang it overnight give\nit in my eyes maybe what he's looking\nfor i think what he's looking for is the\nis the representation of the banging\nmaybe he wants to see that yeah yeah\nyeah\nand then is he her boyfriend\nand then\nif it was me i would f her so what did\nthis person get banned for it's the if\nit was me i would f her\nyeah a little entitlement a little uh\nrapey vibes\nokay\nlike isn't is and if this person was\nengaging in a platonic relationship with\nwith a woman if you were sleeping in my\nbed\nhe would [ __ ] me basically is what he's\nsaying okay\nyes and\nand\nyeah so that's a touch rapey\nyeah i think we can agree on that\num\nhis appeal is really what gets me sorry\nsorry sorry\ni got taken over by my emotions please\nunban me and i will make it worth\nthanks fellow amaranth fan\nwhat does that mean i will make it worth\ni don't know\ni will make it worth like what\namaranth i'm kind of thinking so we can\ngo through this but i'm kind of thinking\nlike i'm noticing like maybe a need for\nsome basic education here about\nmanaging your emotions and and what's\nokay and not to say and if you like\nsomeone\nand and because i think when he says\ngive it in my eyes i mean i i know that\nwe can always jump to the cooming but\ni i would i really think what he's\nlooking for is an image of you and s fan\nbanging\num\nbecause that's maybe that's maybe a\ntranslation barrier you know like a\nlanguage barrier well i mean i think it\nwould be nice to give them the benefit\nof that by the way the reason i thought\nthe other guy was uh i assume it was a\ndude um was\nan older age it's because he used\ncapital letters\nand punctuation right which generally\nspeaking you know the the youngans\ndon't really do that as much\ni i don't know\ni don't know though but i mean i think i\nthink the\nyou know\ni i don't know dude\ni don't know about this one because i i\ndo think the rapey vibes is kind of\nyeah\nyeah so deny i think so i\ni guess so i\ni'm gonna reply to him not worth\noh ouch\ni would be careful about that\nreally yes\nhow would you what would you say\num so\nokay so i'm not an expert here but\nso generally speaking like if if a\nperson is like making\nyou know threatening statements you\ndon't want to overreact to that and you\ndon't want to under react to that but\nyou also don't want to do something or\njust the way that i work i mean you you\nknow your community way better than i do\nyou you're way more successful as a\nstreamer than i am so take this with a\ngrain of salt but i think that just\nbecause they behave out of line doesn't\nmean that you want to hit back\nright so like when you're doing that\nyou're kind of like women approach\ncaution\nyou're taking the real life woman\napproach to creepers be cautious because\nyou don't want them to follow you to\nyour car\nsure\nthat's not the approach that i was\ntaking but thank you for educating us i\nthink that makes sense\nbut i i think it's just more about like\nyou know just because they make i mean\nhe's saying something inappropriate and\nthen you're gonna insult him which is\nlike fine from uh you know like this is\nthe internet and like don't dish it if\nyou can't take it\nwhich i sort of get i get that i get\nthat that's sometimes like you have to\ndisplay your power and put people in\ntheir place\nbut generally speaking i try not to give\nin to those\nfeelings\ngotcha so is there something that you\nthink we could say that might make him\nthink about the next time he engages\nwith a woman on twitch yeah\nso i think that that i actually really\nlike because i i know it sounds kind of\nweird but i think a lot of these people\nwho say inappropriate things i i do\nthink they need help and i think they\nneed education\nso like let's just think through this\nfor a second if you had said not worth\nwhat is that going to encourage him to\ndo with other female streamers on twitch\ni don't think he's going to learn his\nlesson it's just going to piss him off\nright probably he's like i'm going to\nshow that [ __ ]\nwhat i'm worth\nright like seriously i mean maybe it'll\nmake him gift 100 subs to prove me wrong\nwe don't know you know that's a\nyeah that that i can't i don't\ni'm not very good at soliciting\ndonations or subs\nand\nmy team has been trying to get me to do\nthat for like two and a half years and i\njust don't know how to do it properly\nbut\ni i would say this is the kind of thing\nthat it's like you know\nyour your quote gives us off rapey vibes\nand that's really not acceptable on\ntwitch like twitch is a place where like\nwe can have fun but that crosses the\nline\nnow okay but i'm gonna defer to you\nbecause if that doesn't feel right you\nknow please don't do that to other\npeople and like please recognize that\nyour words have meaning and you are an\nimportant part\nof the twitch community\nbut that's not nearly as fun\ni'm with you in terms of not worth is\nway more\nexciting entertaining and\nemotionally engaging it makes for better\ncontent\nso i told him your chat history gives us\na bit of entitled rapey vibes so maybe\nconsider this type of wording when\nengaging in other chats in the future\ni think that's maybe reconsider that's\nthe better word yeah i think that's uh\nwell said amaranth very eloquent there\nwe go\nokay\nnow we are on guy donny\nriddle me this amaranth i am inside of\nyour home\nyeah so that's like straight up stalking\nright\nyes\num\ni i don't see i don't understand why\npeople like to pretend that they're\nstalkers\nyeah what do what do you think what i\nmean\nwhat is there to be gained\nuh\nthat's a good question\na ban\nwell yeah but\nlet me let me think about that what is\nthere to be gained\nso\nthis is you know so it's fine that this\nperson gets banned but i think that if\nwe look at like\npeople oftentimes test limits and test\nboundaries right they want to see like\nwhat's okay to get away with\nand they want to be maybe a little bit\nedge lords\nthey want to be\ncool they want to\nthey want to get so oftentimes they'll\nthey'll do things like this to get\nnoticed\nattention right so like they they want\ni mean we saw so there was an\ninteresting post recently on our\nsubreddit about someone who's like i am\nan internet troll and i don't know how\nto stop\ni just feel seen i feel heard when like\ni can like when there's a streamer that\nhas 10 000 viewers and they respond to\nmy comment like\ni'm at the top of the list of ten\nthousand\nso i think there's a lot i mean we can't\nread i mean\nso much hypothesizing into so little\ninformation but\ni think there's it's first of all\ncompletely acceptable to set sort of\nboundaries on\nwhat is acceptable communication and\nwhat is not acceptable communication but\nwhat pushes people to do this why do i\ndon't know that people pretend to be\nstalkers that's just what they're that's\njust the manifestation my guess is that\nthey want to be noticed\nright kind of like when the kid in class\nacts up to get attention of the class\nyeah and in the future and oftentimes\nthe kid who acts up doesn't quite know\nwhat drives them to act up they just\nknow that they\nneed to be\nyou know they act up\nright um\nand and i i think that it's also\nprobably an important lesson to learn\nthat like stalking is not okay\nand joking about stock like like certain\nbehaviors are not okay and certain behav\nlike\njoking about certain behaviors is also\nnot okay like stalking is not okay\njoking about stalking is not okay\nyou know\nsexually assaulting people is not okay\njoking about sexually assaulting people\nis not okay\nsmurfing in dota or league of legends is\nnot okay joking about smurfing about\ndoterra league of legends is not okay\nright there are certain things that\nsocietally we just\nset limits on and\nyou know\nbut smurfing is the kind of thing that\nwe you know let people joke about\nwhat is smurfing exactly\nso if i'm\nwell a couple of think so generally it's\nlike when you're if you're a high\nskilled player and you have like a high\nrating\nand if you go into matchmaking you get\nmatched against other players who are\nlike high skill\nand so\nwhat tends to happen is like eventually\nyou're gonna start like you're gonna\nkind of get to a 50 50 win rate and you\ndon't win very much or you win half the\ntime and so what people will do is\nthey'll create new accounts and they'll\ngo into players with they'll go into\ngames with like newer players or worse\nplayers and they'll just dumpster all\nover them so they'll just like crush\nnoobs and they should be playing\nit's kind of like if i you know if i go\nwrestle a three-year-old it's like yeah\ni can win but\nyou know it's not really but some people\nlike the feel of winning and so they\nsmurf\ni see\nwe're learning new things you're\nlearning about [ __ ] i'm learning\nthis is going to be a wonderful exchange\nof information\nwe're both going to be learning about\nthings that everyone in both of our\nchats already knows a ton about we're\ngetting the only ones learning here\ntoday\ni let my chat vote on this one though\nthey said they want to keep him banned\nand so i think we should tell him um\ntalking slash pretending\nto be a stalker is\nnot okay\nif you wanted attention\nso okay before uh before you do that can\nwe read the person's um\nreasoning oh\nyes yes okay yeah it's okay i did not\nrealize that i would get banned for this\nthis is my first time in the chat and i\nam incredibly not sober i would like to\nrequest a second chance at life what do\nyou think about that part i am\nincredibly not sober\num i don't think it's good to blame\nalcohol\nor drugs\nfor\nacting out\ni think that you have to be responsible\nfor your actions just like in person if\nyou punch someone while you are drunk\nyou are still responsible for punching\nthem\num\nyeah that's what i think about that and\nalso the request a second chance at life\nleads me to believe that he doesn't take\nit seriously or see what was wrong with\nwhat he said\nyeah\nso i i first of all completely agree\nwith your first statement that i think\nthe decision to use substances does not\nmake you\nimmune to the behavior afterward or like\nit does not absolve your responsibility\nafterward so i don't think that's an\nexcuse and oddly enough i think you\nwould be reinforcing the wrong things by\nunbanning him\nbecause actually interestingly enough\nthe signal that you would be sending is\noh by the way if you blame drugs chances\nare punishments will be removed\nright oddly enough this is one of the\ncases where i think what he says makes\nme less likely to want to unban him\nappeal indicates and he's trying to get\na pass\nand then if you unban him\nwhat we're actually going to be teaching\nhim is\noh by the way if you blame the drugs\nstalking people is okay\nright you can get a pass for that sort\nof thing\nyeah i agree\nby the way chad i just tweeted so please\ngo like comment and retweet i'd\nappreciate it um i think we're going to\ndeny this guy\nokay\ntell him that stalking slash pretending\nto be a stalker is not okay if you\nwanted attention you could have\nmade actual funny comments in the chat\nor sub it for free with twitch prime\nokay goodbye\nso next up\ninnaj\nlet me see\ni think this is also in response to\nesfen being here\nthey said yes he's her boyfriend\nand then um his appeal is i hate you\nmods i don't really think that should\nhave been banned um\nbut it is interesting that anytime that\na mail is on my stream they there's\npeople in chat who will assume it's my\nboyfriend even when i had my like 50\nyear old uncle on my stream with me they\nassumed it was my boyfriend\num\nhow does that\ni was about to ask you how that makes\nyou feel but i don't know if we want to\ngo there\nlike i said i feel it doesn't really\nmake me feel anything about me it's more\nof i question\nthe fact that they can't handle men and\nwomen being in the same room together\nwithout being in an intimate\nrelationship and that's strange to me\ni'm wondering why so many people seem to\nbe like that i don't know if it's a\ncultural thing or if it's an immaturity\nthing\num\nwell i mean i i think\nand let me know if this is a little bit\nout of line but i i think that\nyou know you do have a sexual undertone\nto a lot of your streams\nand so i wonder if they're kind of\nreading too much into that i don't think\nthat that makes it acceptable by any\nmeans\num\nbut i think you i i wonder\ni wonder if those two things are related\nlike i have to think that you attract a\ncertain kind of coomer let us say\num\n[Music]\nbut\nbut this isn't just a my chat issue i\nsee this all the time on uh like mail\nstreams too if there's a female on\nthey'll be like are you [ __ ]\nso that's a really good point so then i\nthink maybe it doesn't have anything to\ndo with you and it has more to do with\ntwitch chat\num\ni'm not sure though i i don't know like\nso that when i get a question like\nyeah so do you think the first band was\nappropriate or\ni don't actually think this should have\nbeen banned i think a timeout would have\nsufficed\nyeah so it seems like they timed out and\nthen banned\nso how does that what what do you think\nhappened there does that does some did\nsomeone um\nin this case i think it could have been\na miss click like a double thing because\nit was literally like the same second\nokay so and then and then what i'm\ncurious about is their response their\nreason to\nget unbanned as i hate you mods\nwhat are you yeah there's no mod comment\nso i don't think it was like a ban\nevasion situation\num\nso are you thinking unbanned\ni think we can unban and be like just\njust a bit of advice the way to get\nunbanned is to not tell the mods you\nhate them\ntypically\nyeah\nand i don't know about this why do they\nhave to why do people make comments so i\nwonder if like some of it uh amaranth is\nlike\num\njust you know if you tell twitch chat\nnot to do something\nthe first thing they're going to want to\ndo is do it\nright\nlike\nso i i wonder if there's just sort of\nthis thing where like you've you've set\na very clear boundary and you've made it\nvery clear that you can have platonic\nrelationships with people\nand then like that's actually like\nimportant and acceptable and should not\nbe frowned upon and some people really\ntake issue with that it really like\nbothers them in some way\nif we really want to get into it i mean\ni think some of this is because they\nthemselves have trouble having platonic\nrelationships so they can't imagine that\nthat's possible for other people\num right so i think people oftentimes\njudge\nothers based on\nwhat goes on in their head\nso if i lust after every single woman\ni'm ever in a room with including 50\nyear old\nfamily members\nthen what i'm going to naturally assume\nis that's what other people are doing\num\nand so\nyou know because it's kind of like so i\nran into this problem many many years\nago with my wife where like i don't care\ntoo much about occasions\nbut she does\nso for me it's like not that big of a\ndeal if like\ni'm celebrating my birthday on my\nbirthday or a week later like it's you\nknow the the day doesn't mean much to me\nbut for her it does mean something so\nlike to do things properly like kind of\non that day is important\nright um and so in that same way like it\ntook me a while to realize like when i\ndidn't do something on her birthday like\nlike she was very hurt by that because\nwhen she does things on my birthday like\nshe puts a lot of meaning and effort\ninto it and so i'm wondering if that's\nkind of the same thing where these\npeople just don't believe that platonic\nrelationships are possible if you're\nsexually frustrated at home\nand have trouble engaging with women in\na platonic way and and that also results\nin you having trouble seeing them as\nhuman beings because you don't have\nfemale friends then you kind of\nsexualize them and then you kind of like\nyou know it like becomes a vicious cycle\nwhere since you're sexualizing women you\ncan't have friends since you don't have\nfriends you don't know how to humanize\nwomen and then you sexualize them and\nthen they show up in your chat\nhow is that for\nan answer\nit's sad\nyeah so i think that\nyou know we can teach people hopefully\nwe can help people like learn how to be\nfriends with people of the opposite\ngender or same gender for that matter\nthat's true\nyeah we don't judge here\num\nso\non band right\num\ni think i kept them banned oh you oh you\nkept them\nwait no no no no i didn't ban i think i\ndidn't unban that was on the mod band\ntoo fast yeah yeah i'm i'm i'm a band\nbehind still yeah we unbanned that one\nokay so\nbravo\nthis is a new person now yes let's do it\nokay\nokay\nif you want you can read it out i have\nto send the message real quick yeah i\ncan read it out and i'm sure this will\nget clipped i'm not a simp\ni just came to realize that kate is a\ngood person who is actually really cool\nin life so stop hating her\nyou are all so you're all just jealous\nkate you were so beautiful\nyo\nuh\nyo\nenglish only match phrase group three\ndo amazon cosplay\nblocked language detected\nand then\ni know you all can't see this\nyo yes baby oh jesus why doesn't he\ninvade her\ni'm confused\nthe s finn sleep stream\nwhy doesn't he invade her\nokay\nand then the the reasoning that they\nprovide is what is wrong with what i\nsaid if i were in the same bed with you\nbaby you would be getting it in your\nmouth and stomach\nah\nthis is so bad bro\nit's so don't be so sexist it is natural\nthat men want to have sex with you and\nimagine it or you yeah\nare you guarded by men's desire towards\nyou and yet you show your booty to the\nworld\ni'm not gonna read that next part\nand i like you babe but don't be a\nhypocrite\nyeah so what i was like looking through\nstuff and was like yeah this is bad this\nis the kind of stuff i was reading\nyeah\num\nso i'm still confused about why the\nperson got banned in the first place\ni'm not he said oh jesus why doesn't\naspen invade her while they're in her\nbed oh yeah that part i understand but\nthey were getting timed out and stuff\nbefore that\num\nthis is\na bot timing out foreign language okay\nso this is this is a bot\nyeah for either spam or foreign language\nokay so so it's not the top stuff it's\nnot i'm not a simp i just came i'm not a\nband\nyeah i just came to realize that kate is\na good person who is actually really\ncool in life\nthat doesn't i\nis that bad\ni don't even know what they're talking\nabout no those are fine that's fine okay\nthat's fine\num\nyeah it's it's more of like the appeal\nis very young well the reason why band\nis yikes and the appeal makes it even\nworse yeah i think the appeal is way out\nof line so just to be clear like\nyou know i don't think\nso this guy's talking about what is what\nis offensive about someone's desire\ntowards you\nand and you know this could be another\nplace where maybe i'm incorrect or\noverstepping but i don't think desire is\nwrong\ni think presumptions on desire or\nimplying that\nother human beings don't have a choice\nin the matter\nor i think entitlement is the issue here\nto other people's bodies without consent\nyes completely agree\ndesire is just you know people desire\nall kinds of things i want a cupcake\nbut you know i don't get to eat it if\nit's someone else's\nor even i don't have to give into it\neven if it's my own cupcake\nexactly\nso i think this is a pretty clear deny\nright\noh absolutely\nyeah\nthat's been to me that's been the\nclearest one that we've looked at so far\nhave we looked at something that you\nthink is clearer than that\nno this is this is the worst one so far\ni'm sure it'll get it'll probably get\nworse but this is the worst one so far\nyeah\nshould we move on then or do you want to\ntalk about this\nno i think i think everyone here this\none isn't too hard to analyze it's just\nvery\nuh\nrapey vibes\nokay\num\nall right\nnext what what did i miss something\ni'm just reading that first message of\nthe next one uh\ni have small schmeet and will any girls\nstill let me tap\nis it the motion of the ocean or the\nsize please i need answers please help\nme i have a girl in the bag do i try to\ntap or do i just talk because my shmeet\nis small this is urgent\ni'm connected and then he works on and\nhe escalates to\njust spamming a [ __ ]\nand then his appeal is thought thought\nthought dot dot thought now what do you\nthink drives individuals to behave this\nway\nuh hold on i'm just trying to understand\nwhat the person is saying can can you\nhelp me understand that first sentence i\nhave small small schmidt will anything i\nthink he says he has a small penis\nokay\nand girl taps me still let me [ __ ] it is\nintercourse yes tap is intercourse\nis it the motion or\nof the ocean or the size\nand this is referring to\nhow\num\nimportant\nthe size of the penises in terms of\nintercourse you need answers\nand then please help me i have a girl in\nthe bag\nwhat does that mean\nis that like a abduction means he's\ndm'ing a girl and he doesn't know if he\nshould\nmake plans to hook up or just talk to\nher because he doesn't know if she would\nwant to hook up with his small penis\nokay\nyeah so\nlet's pause here for a second\nso so far\nuh i mean i guess this guy is just\ntrolling right\nuh i like no like i don't think but i've\ni've met some guys who are actually\nconcerned about their small penis so\nyeah but i mean is this the way that you\nexpress concern about\nyour small penis do you do it on twitch\nchat\num i mean\ni could see it reasonably if you\nconsider\nthe\nthe type of person who might use\ntwitch chat for this kind of question\nthey probably\nare on the computer a lot inside without\nreal social skills and feeling insecure\nand watching a lot of porn where angles\ncan look like all guys have a big dick\nand that's actually not true but they\ndon't know but they're insecure and so\nthey're asking for help okay so i'm i'm\nlearning a lot like so also from chat\nthat\ni guess maybe people are\nlike serious about this stuff right so\nmaybe they're pretending to be trolling\nbut deep down they're actually like\nlooking for an answer\nlike they're actually looking for some\nkind of like validation or comfort or\nreassurance that even if you have a\nsmall penis you can engage in a healthy\nrelationship\nexactly yeah and we think that that's\ngoing on here instead of\nthe person trolling\ni it could go either way yeah what do\nyou think let's do a poll\num\nand then i think after that when when he\njust starts\nsaying horror\n[ __ ]\nthat actually implies to me that maybe\nthere is a legitimate\nfeeling or concern here on the part of\nthe person not to say that their\nbehavior is appropriate but that maybe\nthis isn't a troll because usually when\ntrolls get called out they don't respond\nso\nit's more like can't you take a joke\ni was joking\nit might if he doesn't have a small\npenis\nand he actually is insecure about it i\ncould see how he could project his\ninsecurities\nonto people over the internet\nby calling them names i mean so i think\nthis is kind of like the way that this\nperson responded by being toxic and also\ntheir ban appeal is thought thought\nthought\nwhich by the way i do know what that\nmeans\nso i i've learned you know that one yeah\ni know that one\nyeah i mean i think so this one doesn't\nget unbanned right\nuh no we're not going to advance it yeah\nand then i think the other thing is um\njust from a medical perspective like\ni think that\nuh\na couple of just like medical facts\nwhat\na medical perspective about the small\npenis sure\nokay okay yeah\num so if\nyou know i think that if you look at\nhealthier healthy sexual relationships\nthey can be like very varied i mean if\nwe you\nknow for example lesbians have healthy\nsexual relationships with no penises\num and so there's just a you know\nthere's a lot of options out there so i\ndon't think that a small penis\nnecessarily precludes right you can\nalways use a strap-on over your small\npenis it's fine\ni wasn't necessarily thinking that but\num\nyou know i think that just just to\nremember like i'm serious like seriously\nlike there's you know there's a lot of\ndifferent ways that people can engage in\nhealthy sexual relationships and if\nyou've got a partner and if you have an\ninsecurity like a healthy sexual\nrelationship is actually a wonderful way\nto overcome an insecurity\nright you just share like everyone has\nthings that they're insecure about\nand it's okay to like have those\ninsecurities and treat people with\nrespect and like give them the chance\nlike don't\nyou know don't make decisions for them\nso if you have a small penis and you're\nout there and you're thinking oh\nthe person that i'm talking to would\nnever be interested in me because of my\npenis like that's their choice right\nthey get to make that judgment\nthey get to make that decision about\nwhether they want to engage with you or\nnot\nand if you assume that\nthat's a deal breaker then like you're\nnot even giving other people a chance to\naccept you and if you don't give other\npeople a chance to accept you then like\nof course you're going to become\nresentful and feel unaccepted because\nyou're not giving people a chance to do\nthat\ntrue 100\num\nyou have any thoughts on the matter it's\nnot a troll it's just because we're both\ntalking about i think that a lot of guys\nalso\nare not realizing what the average penis\nsize actually is\num especially in america it's like four\nto five inches and i think a lot of guys\nassume that just because other men\nsay they're like nine inches online that\nthat means they're small when in reality\nyou know people just aren't actually\nthat big on average\nyeah i think there's also i remember\nlearning it's been a while since i took\nanatomy but if you actually look at um\n[Music]\nthe nature of the nerve endings in the\nfemale\ngenital area the most concentrated\nnerves are actually like towards the\nfront or the outside\nand then inside the nerves are like\ndifferent so you have a lot more light\ntouch\nin other kinds of like nerves that are\nvery very sensitive on the outside which\nis like\nso that's sort of you know\nwhether you're four inches or eight\ninches\ni can't really attest to this but\nanatomically there's\nmore\nsensation so even with a small amount of\ninches i think you get a lot of\nsensation and obviously the clitoris is\non the you know on the out outer part\nright which is oftentimes what you need\nto stimulate to achieve orgasm yes and\nyeah if if people know where that is the\ndick isn't as important as far as the\nsize goes yeah and i think studies show\nthat\ni want to say like 50 to 70 percent of\nwomen are\nmaybe not capable i'm a bit rusty on the\nstatistics but are not capable of\nachieving orgasm through penetrative sex\nright\num\nbut i'll have to find a result\nanyways\nright and then there's lots of jokes\nabout does that mean that people aren't\ndoing it right or what i actually don't\nknow i i i'm gonna have to look into\nthat\nand double check the science\nno it's not about right it's just that's\nnot as sensitive for women\nyeah the inside\nyeah\nso takeaway is that you know if you have\na small shmeet is this person put it\ndon't\nassume that\nyou can't have a fulfilling romantic or\nsexual relationship that's right\nthat turned out wholesome\nit did\nit did\nnow the calling people [ __ ] and thought\nthat's that's all yes\nprojection of those same insecurities\nyeah i don't know exactly what that is i\nmean i think sometimes we like to call\nit projection right so like i can get\nbehind why we say that but sometimes i\ndon't know like sometimes i feel like in\npsychiatry\nwe attribute everything to like\npsychological stuff instead of just\npeople not being good people\nright like good and evil has left the\ntextbook\nof mental health\nand sometimes i do believe that you know\nthere's like mental health aspects but\nsometimes i'll like work with patients\nwho are just me like it's not\nit's not because they were abused it's\nnot because\nthey're you know sometimes people are\njust like choose to do bad things\num\nand and i mean yeah i think i think we\ncan tell him though a good note is it's\nokay to be small you aren't lesser just\nbecause you\nthink your penis is a smaller than\naverage size\nwhat that's very wholesome\nand also\nyou're you can't\nget unbanned if you call people [ __ ]\nand thoughts\nthat's what you should be ashamed of yes\nso how is this y'all\nlike i i this was very different from i\ndon't know what i was expecting\nbut like you know\num\nwe did a ban appeal stream some time ago\nbut i think we also like engaged with\nthe people who we banned\nso we actually had them on and and kind\nof talked to them and had a conversation\nwith them and stuff\nwhich i'm not so sure that that's\ndoable in a situation like this\num\ni i do think though that like so what i\nwhat i like about what we're doing right\nnow is that\nso i don't think we talk enough about\nbanning\ni think that banning is like not a\nperfect system by any means and that we\ncould do a better job at it my biggest\ncomplaint with banning people is that i\ndon't know that there's any kind of\nsubstantive feedback given to people\nand so then like the concern that i have\nis like on the internet um\nyou know like you can ban someone but i\ndon't know that it necessarily changes\ntheir behavior in a positive light and\nwhen i think about like so if we look at\nit from like basic principles of\npsychology like why do we punish people\nso some of it is like kind of this eye\nfor an eye karmic kind of like this\nperson has hurt someone so you deserve\nto be hurt\nbut\ni tend to really find that the the main\nreason for punishment is to alter\nbehavior like that's what i believe i\nguess or believe in maybe is a better\nway to put it\nthe reason that you know you administer\na punishment to someone is to alter\nbehavior ultimately and and oftentimes\nit you know in situations where there's\na power dynamic it's actually to\ninstruct\nso like you're trying to teach someone\nso if i you know if i get upset with you\nand i yell at you like like that's not\ni mean i don't think that's a good\nexample but if we really look at like\nthe goal here is like we're not trying\nto take people who misbehave on the\ninternet and like radicalize them\nfurther or build more resentment which\nif you look at some of the ban appeals\nlanguage right like this is where\npeople are just resentful\nand then i think amaranth is right\nthey're going to go to another\nlike they're just going to show up\nsomewhere else on twitch should we keep\ngoing\nyeah have you read any of this one yet\nuh no\nokay okay\nokay\num we can start on she needs to lose\nsome weight her tummy is growing you've\nbeen gaining weight you need to stop are\nall americans in bread\nit's a shame you're fat and a ra rang i\ndon't know what that is does anybody\nknow i i don't know what a ranga is\neither\nokay\nas surely is their appeal i'll donate\n100 if you unban please\nchad what is a ranga a redhead oh chat\nsaying it's a redhead\nwait so it's a shame you're fat and\noranga\nso he's saying that\ni have\nred hair like in orangutan\noh wow\nhow creative\nokay\nwhat a shame and so so if we go through\nthis\nwhat's the difference between your free\nonly fans okay and premium one put\nclothes on\ngot timed out needs to lose weight tummy\nis growing\nyou've been gaining weight you need to\nstop\nbullying that makes sense\nand then fat and ranga\nuh so clearly they don't actually hate\nme because they want to be unbanned and\nwant to donate money or at least oh i\nwouldn't do that\ni wouldn't assume that that people\nwon't donate just because\ni i don't think you can necessarily draw\na 100 parallel between people donating\nand liking you or hating you\num i think that's true sometimes when i\nhave my chat in sub mode people will sub\nto insult me yeah so i think sometimes\nthere's a certain power dynamic and\nalmost dehumanization when you're the\none who's got the money\nand oftentimes that hatred comes with\nthat exercising of the power dynamic\ni see yeah i used to joke about that uh\nin my interviews like with anthony\npadilla and vice is that streaming\nis actually just being insulted for a\nliving\nthat's brutal\nyeah\nbrutal\num\nat least for a lot of females i don't\nknow if male is good i assume males get\ninsulted too but probably not\nin the same\nlike like uh sexual undertone horror\ntype ways you know yeah i mean i think\neven undertone is\nan understatement there i think a lot of\ntimes the the toxicity is a lot more\novert towards female streamers\nbut yeah i mean i i don't know that\ni mean maybe they are i'm just not that\nfamiliar with it but generally speaking\ni think that\nthe kinds of insults i imagine must be\ndifferent and the kinds of toxicity that\npeople face must be different\nyeah\n100\nlike i know train wrecks gets people\nsaying chicken legs even though he has\nvery swoll calves like i think people\njust like to insult but definitely\nthat's not as toxic as like this kind of\nthing\nyeah so i mean i think that the the\nneeding to lose weight and tommy is\ngrowing and you've been gaining weight\nyou need to stop like that's very those\nare very cruel and hurtful things to say\ni almost think that those are\nworse than\n[ __ ]\nthat's true because a lot of people um\nhave those actual real insecurities\nabout their appearance you know i i\ndetect more malice\nfrom these kinds of statements\nas opposed to just like\nreflexive yeah just like reflexive like\ni'm gonna toss out misogynistic comments\nversus like\ni want to really make you feel bad about\nyourself and i'm saying this to hurt you\nright\num\ni i also think this is another case\nwhere\nwhat are you thinking here\num\ni'm not really sure like what makes\npeople be toxic towards others i assume\nit must be unhappiness in their own\nlives because happy people just don't\nsay these things to each other yeah i\nthink that's oftentimes true\num\nare you thinking about banning or\nunbanning or what like\ni'm thinking\nstay banned\ni think so too and i think that too is\nthe kind of thing where\num\ni think if you unban they're gonna\nattribute it to\nthe 100 donation\nright and then i think\nwhile it may be financially lucrative to\ndo that\num\ni think it sets the wrong message and\nteaches the wrong lesson which is that i\ncan buy my way out of\nbad behavior\nright\nwhich unfortunately is sometimes true\nwhat would you say is a good lesson for\nhim to take away if we were gonna\nbesides like of course insulting others\nis never okay but i mean i feel like\nthat is common sense yeah no i don't\nthink it's it's insulting i think\nactually the lesson to take away is that\nlike your words can actually hurt people\nand this is not a community where like\nwe don't want to\nsupport a community that has people\nbeing malicious towards each other and\ntrying to hurt each other\nright so like think about\nyou know like i i don't know i mean i\nfee this may be this it may be weird\ncoming from you but\nlike\nyou know i think this is the kind of\nthing where\ni think everyone needs to understand\nand by weird coming from you what i mean\nis that you have a particular way of\nlanguage which is just different from\nthe way that i speak so\neven when you translate my words or you\nknow when you take away\nwhat i'm saying and kind of inject what\nyou put into it i think that's wonderful\num but i think that this is where just\nin general like my thought is that i\ndon't think people realize that they\nhave a responsibility on the internet\nright\nand and if there's some way for him to\ncome and assuming it's a him once again\num\nwhat\nlifesaver just cheered 10 000 bits\nand said thank you for pointing out\nunacceptable behaviors never let them\nget to you\nwow\nthat's so wholesome\nyeah so i think signaling to them in\nsome way that\nyou know you have a responsibility on\nthe internet\nand that your actions matter\ntrue\nand that like money\nyou know you may be able to buy your way\nout of unbanned sometimes but like\nthat's not really making the world a\nbetter place\nlike you being an [ __ ] and hurting\npeople and then paying money to\nget them to forgive you\nis not\nthat's not\nhelping anyone\ni don't know how else to put it\ni agree\nall right next one all right next one\nlet's go where is minecraft please may i\nbuy your bathwater kind woman yo this\nwas two this was 2021 this man was ahead\nof his time yo what up guys hello\ngorgeous\ndown bad deluxe\nwhat aryan hype is that like the the\nnazi thing\ni don't know why this person was banned\ni don't understand what any of this\nstuff means\ni'm assuming it is i don't unless it's a\ndifferent spelling oh yeah yeah it is\nokay well that one we can just deny\nbecause racist\nbut maybe we will respond i don't know i\ndon't know i know this sounds kind of\nbizarre but aryan is also uh like it's a\nname in my culture\nso i i have no idea if this is a\nmisspelling\nit could be it could be a different\nactually\ntwo letters mixed\nit could also be like ryan with a type i\ni don't know right i could be reading i\nthink i read it wrong it's it's\nthe racist one is a-r-y-a-n yeah but\neven a-r-y-a-n is a name in indian\nculture\nso it's like\nlike in you know so i i\ni i have no idea i don't know how to\ninterpret this so my chat is saying that\num this spelling is a turkish drink\nbut i've never had this on my stream so\nnow i don't know what the context is\nright yeah so that that's my point is\nthat it's not\nthey didn't say context is difficult uh\nwe also look at the the history of what\nthis person is saying\nso i think this is a unban\nokay okay that's true\nand\nit's not it's not a typo because they\neven said in their\nband reasons right they said banned for\naran hype let's go\nso i i think if it was a typo they would\nhave spelled it right the second time\nright sorry they're just referring to\nsomething else i also wonder is this is\nthis just something we can\nhold on i don't know what is gonna\nhappen to my cookies if i do this but\nyou're gonna search it yeah so like look\nthere\nit's just a drink\nokay\nokay so so i i mean as as as much as we\nwant to be\nyou know anti-nazi\nwhich i don't know i think i think we\ndon't i don't i don't want in my mod\nprobably both misinterpreted it yeah\nwe don't want our own racism\nright to ban people\nright who are\nnot racist\nright\nright that makes sense\nso yeah i think that's an unban\nso instead i will write kirk varmi\nwhich i think means any turks here\nand um a heart\nthe turkish people are probably my\nbiggest percentage of audience\nreally\ni don't know\nbut maybe pornhub's banned in turkey so\ni'm just assuming all right sin unbanned\ndecision\nokay\nnext up\nwe've got\ndylan shoots\nwhich says yeah for sure dog [ __ ] i\ndon't even know why this was banned i\ndon't know either\nthis was 2019. when stuff is this old\nand especially if there's no context i\njust unbanned because i i don't know\nyeah i that doesn't make any sense\nthis person was\nmaybe a mistake\npossibly\nthey last typed in your chat in 2019\nyeah because that's when they got banned\nso\nthat's when they got banned\nyeah they can't type if they get you\nknow they get banned so it says uh this\nchat history and he's banned a second\nlater so the person is is now applying\nfor an unbanned three years later\nyeah which is weird you would think that\nhe would have maybe he took a hiatus\nfrom twitch who knows okay\nwho knows\num i don't know who nikki poo is but\ni mean i don't know either\nbut if he if he comes up and unbanned\nthen we'll know who cares too all right\nbone breaker\nso when do you plan to throw that food\nback up you're fat fat girls shouldn't\neat\nwhy do you ban me for promoting healthy\nlifestyle where i'm from in france you\namerican girls are massively overweight\ndue to mcdonald's they have mcdonald's\nin france and while already being\noverweight she eats in the middle she\neats in the stream girls watching will\nthink that\nthat in public is okay it's not okay to\nact like a hungry hippo in front of men\nfirst of all i don't understand\nthis whole um\ncharade that some people have with\ncalling\npeople who aren't fat fat and even if\nthe person is fat what does it concern\nyou\nyeah i don't understand that at all but\nthis this seems like a toxic\ntoxic piece of [ __ ] um we won't tell\nthem that though because we are kind and\nrespectful here\nno i mean so it's it that right right so\nif we like think about it right it's\nokay for us to have a reaction\nto what the person says\nbut then we also want to like\nacknowledge that that's a reaction and\nwe don't have to give in to that\nreaction\nright um but i mean i do think that the\nthe person first of all doesn't seem\nso i'm not sure that unbanning this i\nthink unbanning this person will\nreinforce the wrong behavior because\nthey're doubling down and they're\nunbanning appeal right so\nshe eats on stream like that's totally\nfine like you're allowed to eat on\nstream it's not against tos\num\ngirls watching this will think that\neating like that in public is okay\nthat's something that we want more of\ngood job\nright\nlike we want women to feel like it is\nacceptable to eat in public\nyes and\nit's not okay to act like a hungry hippo\nin front of men that is where i beg to\ndisagree\ni think you should act like a hungry\nhippo if you want to\nin front of men in front of women you\ncan act like a hungry hippo if you're\nfeeling a hungry hippo\nand so i think that person stays banned\nagreed agreed because i just told him\nthat i will eat whenever i want whatever\ni want i ate your dad's dinner last\nnight and i'll do it again hungry hungry\nhippo i'll be all four hippos because\nthere are four in that game\nwhat is the dad's dinner\nthat's because i wrote i ate your dad\nand i paused\nand i kept typing it was for chats\nentertainment okay i was kind of\nconfused about what that meant but\ni ate your dad's dinner\ni just don't know i gotta say amaranth i\ncan't keep up with\nhonestly like the stuff that worries me\nthe most is like sexual because some\nthings that are sexual or just\nthey're just so like you can't even\nconnect the dots\nlike when i first heard coomer\nthere's this thing called a maine [ __ ]\ncat\nright it's a kind of cat\nand that's just what i thought of\nhumor c-o-o-m-e-r\nlike to comb it's like a i i get it the\nspelling\ni get\nokay\ni appreciate it though i mean you know\nbecause nine times out of ten i'm gonna\nneed that level of detail this just\nhappens to be the one one time where i'm\nable to connect the dots\nbut thank you\nall right\nokay um\nokay so moving on this next one\nnice xqc click bait stupid [ __ ] i'm not\nsure\nwhat this even meant i don't understand\nwhat that means either i i don't know i\ndidn't have xqc in my title so i'm not\nsure\num you know calling you a horror is not\nokay\nstupid is not okay\nalso in their appeal reason they said i\nsaid it and i meant it i feel like it's\npretty fair\nso they don't seem\nyeah they don't seem very uh apologetic\nyeah so i think the person you know i'm\nnot seeing any reason to unban them no i\ni'm not either and i don't think they\nexpect to be unbanned to be honest from\ntheir appeal that's a really good\ninsight\nso to them i'm just going to say\noh which is so interesting right xqcl\nis all i will say what does that mean\nthat's uh one of xqc's emote with a\nheart i see\nyes um\ni'm just a little bit curious though if\nthe person isn't expecting to get\nunbanned and you unban them what would\nthat do\num\ni'm not sure\nthat's kind of cautious\nwell\nmaybe we'll find out a different one\nokay let's go\nso she's been streaming for eight hours\nso his wisdom uh tet wisdom tet yo that\ndude that said it's heaven just shut the\n[ __ ] up i don't know what the context is\nhere wait is she getting held against\nher will\nshe said i'm sorry in a whisper\nsounds like it sounds like craziness to\nme um\nsomething about iowa\nnot iowa oh maybe i was playing\ngeoguessr here\nthat would make sense if i was playing\ngeoguessr\nyeah so then it goes\ni'm a head out good night send\nhep dang the only fans\ndown bads\nor only fans i don't know what that\nmeans\num\nyeah i i don't know either it's crazy uh\nsomebody asked for her off and i checked\nthe the links i just stated down bad\nokay so this man is saying he's down bad\nand i personally don't see an issue with\nthat i think that it's okay to be down\nbad\num so i'm going to unban and say it's no\ncrime to be horny\ni don't know what that what does down\nbad mean does that\nmean it's basically horny is basically\num see this is what i'm saying like like\ndown bad doesn't there's no there's no\ndown is a direction\nbad is the opposite of good\nlike i don't know\nwhere do people even come up with this\nyeah i don't i don't know\nbut it sounds like you feel okay that\nthis is\nyeah i don't think they said anything\ntoxic um\nyeah i think they're okay okay\nyeah\nthese days so be it\nexclamation mark social exclamation mark\nyoutube those are fine are your boobs\nfake obot got him and then he says hey\nif you guys are looking for pokemon card\ngiveaways check out\npoca lucas very good deals now i don't\nthink this should have been banned i\nknow why my mods timed it out because um\nit is technically self-promotion of\nanother stream but i think that could\nhave just been a timeout and he seems\nfairly innocent so for that i think i\nwill unban what about the boobs fake\ncomment i mean he's just curious that\nthere's no harm in being curious however\nmaybe just chill\ninteresting so so\ncan i\njust ask you about that for a second\nabout about which part about about your\nresponse and the way that you handle\npeople asking if the boobs are fake\num thank you\nit's a compliment\nso do you do you think that's an\nacceptable question like\nwhat your personal threshold is it\nsounds like you're okay with it it's i\ndon't think it's appropriate to ask\npeople that but i also know online\npeople tend to gravitate towards the\nanonymous aspects and feel way more bold\nthan they do in person\nand\ni don't think it's always ill-intent i\nthink people often just word vomit what\nthey're thinking in their minds without\nfiltering it\nyeah that's that's really interesting\ni've never\nmost people i've talked to would be very\nvery offended by that\nuh but you know it's it's really\ninteresting\nto hear you sort of think about it\nalmost as like curiosity because like\ni'm al also like kind of\nwondering right so if i'm a 14 year old\nkid on the internet how on earth am i\never supposed to know what's real or\nfake and like how right where do you\nlearn that\ncool right and if we're\nyou know\nyeah so that's that's really interesting\ni'm gonna have to really think about\nthat a little bit more but i really\nappreciate that perspective\nyeah\ni think it's normal\num\ncool so unban\nno worries\ni i i think he's okay okay\noh this one is interesting shut the [ __ ]\nup you ugly [ __ ] suck my dick and what\nwe find interesting is the appeal we'll\nget to a chat if you're afk and just\nlistening you can suck my dick shut the\n[ __ ] up and then his appeal is\nyou wasn't talking to you\num\nwhat\nso i don't know is so this is the other\nproblem with some of these is you wasn't\neven talking to you\nlike the letter u\nand then the problem is that i don't\neven know is that a typo\nwas it i wasn't talking to you like he\nwasn't talking to me but then the other\nquestion is well who would he be talking\nto\nwhen the other questions you and i are\nright next to each other on the keyboard\nright so that that's where that's where\nyou know is aaron a drink or is it a\nnazi\nis it a misspelled nazi\nyou know\nrace kind of thing\num\ni i i don't know though\ni mean even if they're not talking so\neven if they're not talking to you are\nwe implying that\nsaying this to someone else is okay\nthat's what i wonder like there's i like\nhow they just did not address\nthe uh chat history at all as far as was\nit right or wrong they just said i\nwasn't talking to you\nyeah so then i guess the question is do\nwe want that kind of stuff no so i think\nthat's sort of like matter who you're\ntalking to yes\nwell said\nthat's not acceptable to say\nnext okay um\nso this person was banned in 2019 this\nis their chat history you guys hey what\nis the song what is this song how does\nit feel to be a stripper for 10 year\nolds and that was before i had the poll\nso i don't know what they're talking\nabout\num\nyou are a stripper for 10 year olds you\n[ __ ] weirdo so you like stripping for\nkids trash go to my free cams stop\nstripping for children you [ __ ] pedo\nthey must be irish because they speak\njust like justin minx\nbut you [ __ ] you [ __ ] you [ __ ]\n[ __ ] okay um\nthis is an interesting take though i\nalways find it strange when people say\ncan't care for 10 year olds or whatever\nbecause\nall the 10 year olds i know are watching\nfortnight in minecraft so\nyeah i don't i don't think\n10 year olds are usually pre you know\npuberty hits around 12 13 14 yeah\nyeah once again like medically like it's\nusually yeah it hits\num so his appeal is sorry i didn't\nrespect the hustle back when i made my\nprevious comments now after seeing\namaranth sold farts in a jar for a\nthousand dollars i must recant my\nprevious statements i don't have to like\nit but i can respect it\nhow do you feel about that\ni applaud them that's the best pillar\ni've seen all day\nwhy is that the best appeal are they\nrespect they respect it now\ntrue\nthank you i'm on ban them thank you for\nthat thank you for that it's been a few\nyears\nyeah\nyou apologized\nfor his comments\nyeah and you respect the hustle\ncool\nyep\nregardless of your personal beliefs\nbecause he says i don't have to like it\nbut i can respect it\nwell said\nyeah i i really like how you i would not\nhave unpacked all of that that quickly\nout of 10 appeal and\namazing i\ni'm just curiou i'm not going to ask\nabout the farts for a thousand dollars\nin a jar debating asking about it i can\nsend you some jars before the novelty\neffect just like a little you don't even\nhave to open it just like to sit on your\nlittle shelf back there as a souvenir\nis one of our donation goals\nno no no no no no no no\nfor free for free no no i i understand\nno let me finish\nso we were thinking about donation goals\nlike sub donation goals\nand one of the donation goals we came up\nwith\nwas\nchat gets to pick something that we put\non our shelf\nso like they get to add something like\nthey get to pick something oh i love\nthat and i was thinking like oh this is\nthis is the\num\nperfect\nthe person i've never seen i've never\nseen the universe come together\nin so much synchronicity\nbecause i was thinking like what are\nthey well like what are they gonna like\nare they gonna do like a lotus or an\norchid\nor like a set of prayer beads or maybe\nlike an incense holder or like a little\nbuddha but i mean it's kind of like an\nincense holder well as long as we just\ndon't tell anyone\nwell\nokay i won't tell if you don't that's\nfine\nthat was hilarious dude that's brilliant\nit is like an incense holder yeah but of\na you know a different kind of you know\nflammable fragrance it's yeah yeah yeah\nit's fine yeah i'll just have to let let\nme check with my wife first and then\ni'll you know oh of course of course but\nmaybe it'll be fair as long as you we\nsend one for her office too oh sure yeah\nno problem yeah\nyeah\neasy\neasy here we go all right moving on\nokay um\nthis person has a lot of chatter so\nwe're just gonna start more at the more\nrecent ones chat because if we can read\neveryone's entire chat history we'll\nnever get through these so uh this guy\nsays\nhas anyone heard about ukraine and\nrussia and he just got timed out because\nwe don't like politics in our checks it\ncaused a lot of fights um and then he\nsaid hi all you ever do is lick a mic in\ndying you banned him\ni don't know i'm not sure why oh there's\na mod comment let's see\nban evasion\noh he was banned evading it seems\nokay\nwait how is he banned evading help me\napparently he had an account before\nthat they realized\nbecause this is now his username and\nhe's gone through the original two three\nand now four i see\nso dj sharper image three and two were\nthe same same main card yeah and the\nsame person yeah okay yeah\nso that that's scary\nyeah so that's and also he seems to be\nnegative towards the hustle so we don't\nlike that here we want acceptance and\nrespect\nokay i'm just gonna deny him i'm not\ngonna type why\num okay so this next person\nokay royal jeffer says free healthcare i\nassume he's making fun of america by the\nfact that he doesn't have it because\nwe're probably playing geoguessr and\ntalking about stuff oh no it's actually\n2018. so it could have been anything who\nknows\num\ndestroy all liberals he said oh well\nhe says yeah i was going through a bin\nshapiro phase\ni i don't know what that means\ni don't\ni don't either i don't know what that\nwhat what does that mean by a bin\nshapiro phase i'm actually gonna\ncircumstances i'll let chad decide but\nsay what you want about it i mean ben\nshapiro is a conservative comment\ncommentator commenter right\nso um but i i would assume i don't know\nbut i don't know what that has to do\nwith\nthe free health care i mean destroy all\nliberals\ni think sounds\nviolent\nthat that's that that too is the kind of\nthing where i don't know like how\nserious i mean i don't think they're\nserious but like how would you know and\nyou know does right\nright i don't know\nso what does your chat say\nmy chat is voting currently to unban\nchad if you disagree i encourage you to\nvote on the poll right now this is one\nof the only times you will ever get to\nmake a decision ever in my chat so make\nsure that you vote right now what you\nwant his fate to be\nwow okay now 51 say band 52\nokay so\nsomeone in my chat is saying destroy\nusually means arguments\noh\ni don't know destroying the argument i i\ndon't know either i i don't know\nwell 54 say banned so we will just deny\nbecause he's not contributing any ways\nto chat\nokay crap\nwhoops\num what year was this 2019. she's\nwearing the same clothes from yesterday\nyou know it probably was same clothes\nnever went home lol\nthose never went home that means i was\nat are we doing that are we doing um\n[Music]\nokay yeah yeah\nsame clothing never went home simps\nstaring lull top tier donated there\nshe looks like an escort i mean i\nprobably did to be honest i mean i who's\nto say i still don't but um this is\nprobably at twitchcon because he's\nsaying security bunch of nerds lull\nso actually yeah this is probably a\ntwitchcon stream\nbut his appeal is good he says yeah i\nwas a douche keep doing what you do it\nworks it's all right if you decide not\nto unban me i just want to apologize\nsorry this was 2019 and he apologized i\nthink we can unban yeah i think so i i\nthink if it's you know three years later\nif he sort of recognizes\nthat he was acting like an [ __ ]\nyeah\nokay\nright so this is the next one\nzero says suck my dick please he was\ntimed out so we tried again the next day\nwith uh shockingly suck my dick please\nagain\nand uh he got banned and now his appeal\nchat is i was just expressing my\nfeelings\ndot dot dot\nwell\ni mean i think that this is where we got\nto be careful about whether expressing\nyour feelings is an excuse for saying\nthings that are hurtful or\num you know unacceptable\nyeah and\ni i think it's like something that\npeople will do as sort of a cop-out\ni don't think that he was actually i\nmean that sounds like a bs excuse to be\nbut just while we're on the topic he\ndidn't have one variety when he said can\ni [ __ ] you so we got a little bit of\nvariety from the sea of suck my dick\nplease\nat least he uses please\num\nyeah i i guess so\ni\nit was hard for me to see that\nin with\nyou know with all the other words he's\nasking for consent technically with a\nplease but um let's educate him though\num\ni'm going to let him know women are like\ncats\nokay\nby all means educate me as well yes yes\nyes women are like cats\nif you ask them to do something they\nwon't they don't want to\nbut also probably not the best choice\nto say this to strangers\nit comes off very entitled and creepy\nyeah i feel like\nthese people need some kind of basic\ncourse in like communicating with people\nlike how to talk to other humans i don't\nthink they would read it is the issue\nthe people who need the help typically\naren't aware of how much they need it\nyeah i mean i can i can see that\na lot of times people who are ignorant\ndon't know they're ignorant but\nsomething tells me\npeople are\npeople who are behaving like this on the\ninternet probably know that they're not\ngreat communicators right that's why\nthey're here and\nright it's easier\nfor them\nyeah i don't know\nokay next stop\nuh what year was this this is okay so a\nfew days ago\napril 27th\nso that's a nice new profile pic of\namaranth the captions are often\nmishearing what it said when you read\nthe captions so we were watching the\njohnny depp amber heard trial and the\nlive feed of it the caption was trying\nto match it and it wasn't doing a great\njob that's what he's talking about there\nlet's see why he got banned um\nwe are all human i'm only human after\nall don't put the blame on me\ni don't know what you're talking about i\ndon't know either amaranth found the\nright outfit to wear yay well delayed on\nmine lol great\nthat bs procrastinator almost\nan hour of time from you wow\nwhat kind of bs death threat letters or\nsomething we are all human\nhe might just be crazy because he's his\nappeal is a rag and bone man human i\ndon't know what that means either i\ndon't know what that means either but oh\nthey're saying lyrics to a song\nit's from a song\noh are these we are all human i'm only\nhuman after all and he's saying the song\nhere maybe\noh\nsee i'll never understand the people\nthat just like quote lyrics randomly\nwith no context in a chat why was the\nperson banned in the first place\ndo you know\ni think we just thought he was crazy\nbecause he was quoting lyrics out of\ncontext\nand that we didn't know were lyrics\nokay\ni will give him maybe he was vibin you\nknow in his headphones and he was just\nreally feeling the moment i'm going to\nsay unbanned i'm unbanned i don't if\nchad knows i can sort of i can sort of\nget behind that because like you know\nsometimes you're just vibing with a song\nand you're just singing out loud and if\ni'm typing on the internet i'll just i\ni've typed\nyeah yeah yeah that's probably what it\nwas\noh i'm bad\nthis person says can you ban me please\nand because we don't like to give people\nwhat they want here of course mods just\nmerely timed them out ban me i just want\nyou to ban me to see what it feels like\nwhen you get banned he's been trying for\na while right this was uh so he's been\nbanned since\njuly of last year almost a year now\nand he says very sorry for being\nannoying i was passing through a bad\nmoment and i would like to come back to\nthe chat thanks for reading my silly\nmessage\nenglish isn't my first language\nvery sorry fast spelling mistakes okay i\nthink that's fine yeah i i think it's\nokay also the first reason that they got\nbanned was not that severe right\nright they just they wanted to be banned\nokay that's fine\nokay\num\nnice booba dead ass\nmaybe this is a different language not\nsure\nno i think this is internet speak\noh\nokay\nsorry i have something to say more just\nin that kind of mood\ni just started spamming in the chat\nsorry oh they're saying this is an arab\nterm\nwhat is it\nthe the\ni don't know how to say it n-i-k-m-o-k\nit's a bad word arab they said okay i i\ndon't know how to\narab what about other stuff booba\nnice back normal chatter stuff\nnice ass and booba is pretty typical\num\nyour your boobs look like the anime ones\nokay thank you i think\nall right\num\nchad's saying it's a bad word though in\narabs so we're just gonna deny\nokay um moving on\nsays i hate men and i hate women is the\nnext person\ni don't hate women also do they hate men\nuh\ni i don't know\ni'm so confused\nso we will deny and put question marks\nthen\nand uh oh i'll put quotation question\nmarks i'm so confused and then\nquoted by dr k what about what about\nwhat so they say i don't hate women but\nuh do you own there i think she says is\nit okay to hate men\nthat's what my question was yeah\num\ni don't think it's okay\ni mean you know everyone has their own\nreasons but\ni i wouldn't say\nhate is worth it for anyone regardless\nof gender because hate usually only it\nreally affects the person having the\nhate\nit's a very\nstrong distracting emotion right\nyeah i don't think that your energy\nshould be focused on hating people i\nthink if you don't like somebody you\nshould just remove them from your\nthoughts entirely or pray for them\nthat's very kind of you\nit depends on the context\nokay\nnext stop\nyep\nflavor i don't know what uh why was this\nbanned\ni have no idea but the guy this is\nprobably a miss click to be honest i'm\ngonna unban i\nthink um\n[Music]\nokay\nsomething about this particular word\nthat looks us is the name of polish ice\ncream\ni understand that you think i said the n\nword i'm not racist so i'll never say\nthat\ni'm also looking at some of the context\nso it does look like they're talking in\na separate language\nyes and in this case google has this\nfeature that's not always accurate but i\ntry if you right click you can it'll\nshow translate to english as an option\nin the little grey menu that pops up\nso i'm going to try translating it to\nenglish\nand it says bored as a prick i get the\n[ __ ] out of here\num\nokay\nuh it also says we because the chick\nhere is about to [ __ ] and you are\npromoting the league okay i'm even more\nconfused than before\nyeah so i did an image search for\nice cream\nusing the letters n-o-g-g-e-r\nand it\nit does appear to be an ice cream\noh\nokay\nbut\nso\nunban maybe i i don't know that that's\nwhat's kind of confusing is like\ni don't know\ni i don't know man this is i don't know\nhow to understand that chat this side\nand in situations where we're unsure i\nthink chad can can decide and then it's\nmajority\nruling here so so my chat is saying it's\nobvious he knew what what they were\ndoing no donut on banning he's dodging\ntos\nwell i would think that too but he typed\na few sentences of ice in polish before\nwhich makes me think like it's not just\nlike a one-word occurrence yeah so that\nthat was that's what i was kind of\nthinking too\nor whatever is that like if i'm just\nlike typing in a foreign language\nthen\nbut a lot of a lot of chat seems\na lot of chat seems to be uh\nuh convinced that\nthat they knew what they were doing\nchad wants to ban him okay\nchat\nruling good luck in the future\nokay\nall right\nuh\nthis was 2019 they said womp womp womp\nthen a dance game that's my turtle\nsomeone pants her on fire it's moin just\nlook it's got my name on it\nhermione fantasies right now maybe i was\ncosplaying not true\ngive me my turtle oh this might have\nbeen asmr\ndon't believe the crackling sound pants\nare on fire sound probably sounded like\na fire crackle\nand then i did cosplay hermione's\noccasionally in asmr and then we also\nhad a massage turtle\nlittle figure that i would tap\nand this is also late at night judging\nby the timestamp so i'm assuming most of\nthis is responding to asmr sounds\ndon't believe your bigger excuse never\nmade the letter b with your mouth what\ndoes that mean\noh that was some controversy when i had\nbraces i slurred words together and i\nmispronounced\na sentence that had no racial context at\nall and people thought i said the n word\neven though it didn't make sense at all\nyeah\nso am i missing something i don't\nunderstand what the ins what the\nuh i'm confused there was like people\nwere clipping it out of context and uh\nwe were talking about ramune and pocky\nin a\ngrocery store\nbeing on the ethnic aisle but because\nand i said they probably have that in\nbigger stores\nand people thought because of my slur\nthey thought the word ethnic and then\nthe the\nbigger part of bigger was the n word\neven though we were talking about asian\nfood so it made no sense but people were\nstill hung up about it i see so i mean\nis there something here that's bannable\ni'm confused\num\ni think he was just getting caught up in\nthe drama but it was so long ago that i\ndon't really care and he doesn't don't\nbelieve your bigger excuse i understand\nnow so yeah yeah they thought that you\nwere intentionally using a racial racial\nslur you did not buy yourselves\nyeah i don't know is that bannable or i\nthink we can unban i think that's you\nokay\nall right\nlet's see uh where's the lotion\nnot a great question probably on his\ndesk to be honest\nuh step on my marbles you queen\noh my gosh i love you\nand uh please step on my balls maybe\ni'll be meant by marbles and ruin my\nlife i love you so much i just want to\nfeel the pain from you mommy whammy\nthat's cringe\nyeah i i don't know man\nthis doesn't seem\ni mean i'm more concerned about this\nperson than\ni mean\nmaybe it's just because we're we've been\ndoing this for a little while or\ni\ni'm starting to get kind of numb in my\nmind\noh yeah that happens after a while\nthat's what like\nhow do you deal with that\num\nyeah it's difficult sometimes\nfor sure i think that's part of that i\nknow our last talk in 2020 i said i feel\nlike i'm losing my personality reading\nchat so much this is that's a little bit\nof what i mean it just built up over\nyears you know that numb feeling yeah\nit's better now i don't even know how to\nso when i look at this like there's a\npart like i'm like operating on instinct\nhere i'm not at the very beginning when\nwe were looking at appeals i was like\nreally really thoughtful and like\nlooking at each sentence and looking at\nwhich letters were capitalized and which\nones weren't and like trying to\nunderstand age and\nyou know reading into things and at this\npoint it's just like you know when i see\nwhompy wampy wubble wobble\nit's like i don't know how many you know\nis aaron\ndid they mean to say aryan\nwho knows you know like there was a lot\nof like i i just feel like my mind is\ngetting fried like i don't know i mean\nhow are we going through all these\nno no no no\nno because because\ni mean this person sounds like they just\nneed help like which doesn't mean that\nthey shouldn't which doesn't mean that\nthey\nshouldn't stay banned\nright\nright right right like because like just\nbecause you need help doesn't mean that\nyou can't do things that are hurtful to\npeople or behave in an unacceptable\nmanner but you know like i'm kind of\nconcerned about this person\nlike i've worked with some people who\nhave strange fetishes and kinks and\nthings like that and and you know\nsometimes like that comes from a place\nof\npsychological hurt or trauma\nhave you ever had um clients with a ball\ncrushing fetish where did that come from\nyeah\nwhere did they say where that comes from\nfor education so i i think no i mean i\nthink it's actually like a good question\nlike\nit's not\ni mean i'm not trolling when you ask the\nquestion for educational purposes i\nrecognize that could sometimes be used\nas like a troll kind of comment like\nyeah explain to us what kubernetes\nno but so i think a lot of times people\nso it can be a couple of different\nthings\none is um\nwe have a sense of self-worth\nwhich we want to see and feel\nheard and noticed\nbut so like if you think about a sexual\nrelationship to feel like\nto be seen and heard and accepted and\nnoticed for who you are\nis related to intimacy right\num and so to be vulnerable\nand so but if if what i am\nis something that is like pathetic\ni also want people to see me as pathetic\nand so sometimes i can get tangled up\ninto sexuality the other thing to\nremember is that like\nwhat the mind or the brain finds\narousing can be heavily shaped\nso for example like you know in in\ncultures where like particular body\nparts are covered\nthose\nthose body parts can be sexual pieces\nright so or sex can be sexually arising\nbut there are other parts of the world\nwhere like different body parts are\ncovered and those parts of the body\naren't like inherently sexual\nso\nthe other thing is just we get\nconditioned to think that certain things\nare sexual\nand that's where you know the worst\ncases sometimes you'll have kind of\ntraumatic experiences that are sexual in\nnature which will also\nlike get kind of get cross-wired in the\nbrain to where people will be like\naroused by that kind of situation\num the point is that it's complicated\nand no one really knows or at least i\ndon't\nbut i've worked with people like that\nand i think that's where you know i\nthink some of it some of it gets better\nbut then the other thing is that we did\na stream many months ago about\num\nbdsm and just how that's probably like\njust like a normal variant\nuh but there's not a whole lot of\nresearch into that\nbut it does appear that\nyou know some of that stuff is like just\na normal variant of sexuality\ndid they ever say\nhow they get fetishes when you when you\nhave like um\ni guess\nconsultations with clients\nit is what it is yeah so so people don't\nget a fetish they have a fetish\nright so it's not like they can trace it\nback i mean you may be able to some\npsychologists or psychiatrists may\nhypothesize that we can trace it back to\nlike this is the point that you know the\nfetish began\num\nbut i i think\noftentimes you know the mind is like\nmore complicated and like this is the\nmoment like if we think about who we are\nand what we like it's not single moments\nit's\nconstellations of experience\nbut i think there's just something that\nsometimes is like arousing about being\ndenigrated to some people and then some\npeople also will will literally somehow\nuse pain as like some something gets\nwired\nto where that becomes sexually arousing\nor somewhat of an erogenous zone\ninteresting case i once had someone who\nwas\nhad a partial amputation\nwho um\nso the interesting thing is our brain\nhas a map of our body called the\nsomatosensory cortex and so if you look\nat like how much of our brain is devoted\nto the middle of our back it's not very\nmuch versus our hands and feet are like\nhuge\nso there's right which is why we're so\nsensitive there the interesting thing is\nif you lose a part of your body\nsometimes that part of your brain can\nmove to a different part of your body\nand so it so happened that this person\nwould would get sexually aroused by the\ntouching of their\num\nthat stump\nbecause like the part that was their\ngenitals like took over that part of\ntheir body\ntook over that part of their brain that\nused to be their arm\nhuh\nso then you can sort of look at some of\nthese these other kinds of fetishes and\nthings like that that involve\num things like stumps\nand so there may be some kind of\nneurological\nhypothesis there\nthat's super interesting yeah\ni'm just trying to it feels weird to say\nbut honestly it's not i'm not trying to\nbe\nrisque yeah no no\nit's just the body is weird sexuality is\nweird it's highly individual it's highly\npersonalized and we don't really\nunderstand how it\nworks most of the time to be honest\nyeah i've i've heard that um\na lot of time people who have a foot\nfetish comes from the placement in the\nbrain where controlling your feet is\nright next to the sexual arousal section\nand they like get crossed a bit for some\npeople yeah so i also saw something else\nwhich i don't know how\nreal this is but that the neurons from\nyour feet and the neurons especially for\nwomen which i don't know if this is like\nfactually correct or not i mean i saw\nsomething about it in a textbook around\nscience but sometimes they can be wrong\nso our neurons each have a sheath or\ncovering so if you think about like a\ncord right it's got like an insulation\nand if cords weren't insulated signal\ncould transmit from one cord to the next\ncord\nand that's something there's somewhere\nin the spinal cord or spinal tracts\nwhere there's a lack of myelination so\nthere's a lack of insulation between\nfeet and some of the genital regions so\nthe signal from one can kind of\njump into the other but\nbased on what i read that's more in the\nuh i mean it's part of the central\nnervous system but it's like not in the\nbrain it's like in our spinal cord and\nsome of our more peripheral nerves\naround the sacrum so\nlike some of our genital nerves and and\nnerves from our feet they all enter in\nthe in the tailbone so they like all\nenter the spinal cord so there could be\nsome kind of\nunder elimination where a signal can\njump\nnow that doesn't have anything to do\nwith people being aroused by feet\nthat is more about the physical\nsensation\nright\nwell\nwhat i guess what i'm referring to is\npeople who are aroused by other people's\nfeet but we we do have a possible\nanatomical explanation of why a foot can\nbe an erogenous zone if that makes sense\nright\nthat's so crazy\nyeah sorry if that's\nweird yeah dude that's not even mine\nthat's just the nervous system the\nmonster is just there\nthen we add psychology on top and it\njust becomes something completely\ndifferent\nwow anyway\nand are you going to be leading us\nthrough a meditation today yes yes yes\nshould we do a couple more\num\nyeah we can do maybe like three more and\nwe can do some meditation sounds awesome\nlet's do it

what irks me the most\nwhich one the phrase sweet lips\nyeah it just sounds\nthat sounds weird it's like a it gives\nme the image of like\na like a\n60 year old man\njust like hitting on women in a bar\ncalling them weird things like sweet\nlips yeah\nyeah yeah\n50s pickup line\nyeah broad also\nyeah\nyeah yeah what does that even i mean i\nknow it means a woman but where does\nthat even come from\nlike i don't\nunderstand i'm not sure where the\nexpression broad comes from\nthat's a good question broad\nwomen definition or i don't know slang i\ndon't even know what to search for\nyeah i don't know\nbut\num\ni don't know how reputable urban\ndictionary is says a term originated in\nthe 1930s\nderived from the fact that the most\ndefining characteristics of all females\nare their hips which are proportionally\nwider than the hips of male counterparts\nlook at those\nbroads i don't know if that is accurate\nuh one person i believe that's one more\na butcher's term for a slab of meat with\na hole in it men use it to classify\nwomen\none person from my childhood i believe\nthat one more that sounds more effective\nis from the german brought which means\nbride\nwell there's lots of different\ni don't know different opinions it looks\nlike but this person is\nthis broad better unban me sooner i'm\nchanging the channel\ngo for it change the channel\nthey're not unbanning that\nokay\nokay last one then we'll do some\norientation\nthis one i don't understand um\nlike the middle one and i'm like what do\nyou think i have three tits what's\nhappening the middle one\ni'm back hello amaranth hope you've had\na good day you're crying\nhate chats that go so fast you can't\neven read anything wow imagine having a\ngirl in your life this dramatic if\nyou're actually sad turn off your stream\nand go take care of yourself\ni was just playing\noh sorry y'all can't see that but\nwow total recall i don't know there was\nthree\ni don't think there was three people\ni'm this is not this is not my collab\nday\ni don't know\nwhat but what is\nyeah i don't\ni mean i assume that the person is being\nmean when they say\nif you're actually sad turn off your\nstream and go take care of yourself or\nthey actually you know saying like you\nshould like i can see that being\ninterpreted two ways one is like\nyou should you know take a mental health\nday and don't stream\nand but also like the wow imagine having\na growing life\ni don't know if you're aware but you\nknow women are more emotional than men\nso\ni mean\non average\nwe have all these hormones\num\nand cycles\nlet's see uh\ni'm i'm mostly confused about\nhope we can see her nips like the middle\none\ni don't know what that means\nuh well so sometimes people i think can\nhave theoretically i i mean this is\nsomething that i saw in a james bond\nmovie so i don't know if this is\nmedically accurate or not but people may\nhave a third nipple\noh\nbut i don't necessarily think it means\nyou have a third breast and also it's\nfrom a james bond movie so i don't even\nknow if that's a real thing and you have\na third nipple without having a third\nbreast\ni've never seen one i have nipples and i\nhave no breasts so\nit's possible to have a nipple without a\nbreast\nbut\ni don't know about\nthree\ni have no idea\nand there are there are rare cases of\nmen being able to lactate if you're a\nman who's lactating you should\ndefinitely go see a\ndoctor\nnot normal what no no it's not normal\nit's a sign of potential cancer\noh if you have a man who's lactating i\nthought it was just uh a category on the\nhub okay\nwhat does that mean a category on the\nhub uh\nthe orange youtube\nthe uh\nthe p the p hub\nokay\n[Laughter]\njust using lots of phrases i don't\nunderstand\nbut yeah no oh that's disturbing i just\nno there's there's a thing there's a\nkind of brain tumor\nthat's not good in which a part of our\nbrain starts secreting prolactin which\nis prolactin which is the hormone that\nuh people who are pregnant i mean so\nstarts to increase in pregnancy and then\nafter you have a child like that's what\ncauses\nyou know because people don't lactate\nall the time right even if you have\nbreasts and you're a woman so it's the\npresence of prolactin that does it if\nyou have a prolactinoma sometimes you\ncan get and there's a ton of prolactin\nin your body even as a male you'll start\nto like differentiate some and start to\nlactate\na little bit\nso you should get that checked out if\nyou're doing that as a man as a public\nhealth advisory that's not a troll or a\njoke or anything like that\nokay it's actually terrifying because\nit's so embarrassing of a problem that\npeople are like\nwill never\nyou know yeah they're embarrassed to go\nto the doctor for it because it's like\noh my god i'm a man\nyeah it's scary yeah\ngood news is it's very operable very\neasy to remove tends to not metastasize\nor get bad or anything like that you\njust take well that's great yeah that's\ngood got a good prognosis so go get it\nchecked out\nokay\ni let him know\ni don't know about the third nipple\nthough that's yeah i don't know about\nthat one\num\nyeah i think maybe i'm just looking at\nthe next one and\ni'm okay calling it right here yeah no\nwe're good we're good we can move on um\nthis is just one of those that\ni don't know man\ni feel like we need like good\nlike\nmentorship\nhonestly\nit's a very\nit's just a lot of sexual words it's\njust not\nwhat are we gonna do with these people\non the internet\ni don't know um we have to figure\nsomething out\nyou know\nit's uh\ni just hope they stay on the internet\nand don't\nharass women like this in real life\nwell i mean yeah that's\na victory of sorts but it's just like i\ni can't think that they're\nyou know i mean it's like\ni don't know\ni mean harassing women in real life is\ncertainly\nprobably worse than harassing women on\nthe internet but it's not like harassing\nwomen\nyeah they're great yeah\nand okay uh\ncan you link your meditation yes here\ni'm just logged into twitter okay no um\nlet me do this real quick hold on\nokay\ni will send this we're gonna charge our\nlasers together\nokay\ni don't know if do you have\nuh i'm gonna message you on discord okay\nokay\nyou're gonna be using\nso get them ready get them primed\nuse your twitch prime\nfor free can you can you access that\nuh let me check\nyes awesome\nso today this is fantastic i'm so glad\nyou're doing this because i get to\nmeditate and i get to be led through\nmeditation oh great i found some\nmeditation music\ndo you like music when you meditate or\ndo you like silence uh i will sometimes\nlisten to music before i meditate to\nkind of get me in the mood\nso in the pre in the preparatory phase\nof meditation and then once the the\nactual meditation begins then i will not\nlisten to music\nthat should\nokay um\nso which one is your favorite out of\nthese\nuh so they're of different lengths\nso you can do charging the laser beam if\nyou want to but i think you're you're a\nvery good uh i think the asmr stuff that\nyou do is like really cool\nso i think actually the space one is\nlike a more visualization heavy one\nwhich i think that\ndoes a lot better with a guide so\ncharging the laser beam is something you\ncan kind of do on your own the space one\nis kind of long though\num\nthe space i don't know\ni haven't looked at the space one yet i\nsaw the middle finger and i was like\nyeah okay we can do the middle finger\none then that's actually one of my\npersonal favorites it's one of the\npractices that i did a lot\num because it opens up your chakra which\nis your third eye\na lot it's a big word\nit's two words but yeah oh\nagnya\nis the first word that means it's\nspelled\na j n a or a g n a but there's a there's\nlike a letter that we don't really have\nin english which is like a\nnia\nyeah\nyeah it's like a\ng-y-n\ng-y-n\nthat's like a that's like a vagina\ndoctor right huh no well yeah\nso actually it's probably gny is a\nbetter way to not\nyeah\nit comes from the throat it's like yuck\nyeah yeah\nokay\nin the chat little anime emotes yeah\nokay so\nlet's read what this says chat\nso in this practice we will use our\nmiddle finger to activate our third eye\ndo you have a preference of which hand\nfor the middle finger uh dominant less\ndominant\nyou can okay\nyeah\nso uh to start this practice off chat\nclose your eyes and sit up straight\ni can't close my eyes and read so you\nguys close your eyes\ncurl in all your fingers except the\nmiddle finger\nhover it over the center of your\neyebrows\ndoes that mean in the middle yeah yeah\nokay\nyou don't want the finger to touch just\nhover it right above\nyeah if you don't feel anything you can\nmove your finger a little bit closer try\nto find the sensation\nsome people describe it as a warmth\nor pressure or charging your laser beam\nhover your finger for another 10 to 15\nseconds\nnow go ahead and relax your hand\nyour eyes remain closed and focus on the\nsame spot in your forehead\nyou may notice a bit of sensation right\nat your forehead\nnow what i want you to do is to drive\nall of your attention into that point\nput all your concentration and focus\ninto that point between your eyebrows\nif you're having trouble feeling\nanything you can even gaze at that point\nwith your eyes closed\nhow does that work\nso\nuh do you want to do you want to try\ndoing it so you get a sense of how it\nworks\ndoes that mean like with your eyes\nclosed cross your eyes or like what yeah\nsort of so okay this is what i would say\nclose your eyes\nso take your middle finger and point it\ntowards that area so i would uh lift up\nyour wrist some so you're pointing\ndirectly because you're pointing up\nright there you go\nsee\nright so do you feel something kind of\nin the middle of your forehead\nwhat does it feel like to you\nlike\nanticipation a little bit okay\nso just focus on that feeling\nfor about\n10 seconds\ngood\nit's a good breath now go ahead and\nrelax your hand\nlet it come down keep your eyes closed\nand then\njust focus on that part of your eyebrow\ni mean not eyebrow but the space between\nyour eyebrows\ndo you still feel something there\nnot as strong it's like fading yep good\nso like try to hold on to it\nso if you want to you can even\nbring your middle finger up again to\nlike reinvigorate like almost like\nblowing\ncoals uh like you know blowing it uh\nusing a fan on embers\nso you looks like it's just a tiny bit\noff center but if you're going on feel\nthat's fine yeah\nthere you go there you go\nand then once that feeling is very\nnoticeable it may feel like a warmth\nthat may feel like a pressure\nanticipation is also a good word\nso just like reinvigorate that feeling\nand then when you're ready go ahead and\nrelax\nand now focus on that part\nthe space between your two eyebrows\nand then if you want to you can sort of\nlike\nif you notice with your eyes closed\nthere's kind of like a screen of\nblackness in front of your eyes\ni think those are my eyelids exactly\nand so\nif you visualize like where that point\nis between your eyebrows it's kind of\nlike not really in the center but a\nlittle bit above the center of your the\nscreen of blackness of your eyelids\nis that if it doesn't make sense don't\nworry about it\ni think so\nand so you can like look at that point\nand if you concentrate on that point as\nif you're quote unquote looking at it\nyou may notice\nthe sensation is more present or\nstronger\nand what i want you to do is just push\nyour attention into it\nlike just put all of your focus into\nthat point\nhow are you feeling what what are you\nexperiencing right now\num\nit's like\nit's like i i can see like this like\nit's like a darker spot in between yep\ngood and i'm just wondering like\ndoes it move if my\npupils move or is it actually fixed\ngood so those are all questions that you\ncan answer through experience\nright so you can try to move your eyes\naround if you'd like\nbut keep your concentration on that\npoint\nand what do you discover\ni think it does move\nokay so then what we can do is if it\nmoves with your eyes then where you put\nyour eyes\nwill put the point in the right spot\nwe can control where it is through your\neye movement\ndid you lose all sensation from your\nforehead\ni have no idea\nso go back good go back to focusing on\nit so you learn something that's\nwonderful\ncan you find it again\nyeah\ngood so now just focus on that\nso try to keep your pint uh spine\nstraight but relax your shoulders a\nlittle bit\ntake a big deep breath\nexcellent beautiful so as you exhale\njust let your shoulders kind of hang\ndown\nlike imagine like your body is just on a\nhanger and your spine is straight\nand it's supporting the entire weight of\nyour body\nand as you breathe and exhale you can\nlet everything relax\nyour spine is going to keep you nice and\nupright\nbut there are a lot of things that you\nhave to worry about\na lot of things that you're concerned\nabout a lot of decisions you have to\nmake\nyou're concerned about your horse\nyou have to figure out who to ban and\nwho not to ban\nvery taxing it is taxing\nright you have a lot going on\nand feel\nhow much of the world you support\non your shoulders\nbut for this moment\nall of that weight is being transmitted\nthrough your spine and into the chair\nand into the earth\nthe ground supports you\nand you can let your shoulders rest\nwith each inhalation\nyou're going to feel your body move\nand expand\nand with each exhalation you can relax\nso now slow down that exhalation\ntwo to three seconds for an inhalation\nand six seven eight nine seconds for the\nexhalation\nslow slow slow slow slow\nthat for these few moments\nthe entire world that surrounds amaranth\ncan be set aside\nall of it'll come back when you open\nyour eyes but for these few moments you\nhave peace\nthere's just blackness there's just you\nthere's the weight of your body\nand you're gonna let the world that you\ncarry on your shoulders down for a few\nminutes\nyou've earned that much at least\nso bask in it\nenjoy it\nyou want to hang out here for a little\nbit are you ready to come back\ni'm going to come back to my eyelid\nitches\nso bright now\nyeah\nso much there's so much light\nyeah it's weird huh\nit is weird\na lot to focus on when you're trying not\nto focus on anything\nyeah well said\nthat's like trying to\ntime the breathing trying to find the\nspot trying to relax the body yeah i i\nwas getting the sense that maybe we were\ntrying a little bit too hard\nbut\nso i was trying to focus\non just breathing and just let your\nshoulders like\nthere's a lot of tension you really do\ncarry a lot\nyeah i'm also just [ __ ] up\nstuff so\ni don't know what that means my muscles\nmy muscles are very tense\nyeah\nyeah\nso i know we talked about charging the\nlaser beam but i'd say that you know\nyoga and especially like that muscle\ntension around the shoulders\nit's like you carry it you you have such\na strong mind\nthat\nthat the stress and the tension will\nlive in the muscles\nso it's amazing how many people i have\nno idea about you know what's going on\nwith you but\nwhat i've seen time and time and time\nagain is that the stronger someone's\nmind is the more they carry in their\nbody\nit makes sense\nbecause you just\nyou know\nyou'll do whatever needs to be done\nand your body will hold everything that\nyou can't for you and it holds it as\nenergy it's excess\nenergy that you haven't been able to\nvent\nso i'd say\nyeah\nhave you done surya namaskar it's a kind\nof yoga before\nno\ni would highly recommend it how do you\nspell that s-u-r-y-a\nand then\nn-a-m-a-s-k-a-r it's also called the sun\nsalutation\noh i do those all the time okay\ngood\nthen you're doing that you do it a lot\ndoes it help yeah i mean yeah\nalmost daily sometimes every other day\nand when you do it\nhow often\nhow much time do you do it for like for\none round\num\nprobably just a few minutes\nso one recommendation that i would have\nis pose\nnot the starting pose but the first pose\nin the second pose that you go your\nposes number two and three so when your\narms are above your head and then when\nyou're hanging down\ni would spend like\n30 to 60 seconds in each of those\nand the rest of it you can do in like\nthree minutes\nyeah for those two poses like this\nand this when you're bending down and\ntouching your toes yeah and what you\nwant to do is like\nreach as high as you can reach reach\nreach reach and then when you're\ntouching your toes let yourself hang\nwith each exhalation\ni want you to go like\nfurther down like let your body just\nhang let gravity pull you down towards\nyour toes\nright see when i do that usually it's\nlike i'm trying to pop my lower back and\nso i'm like pulling\nlike this kind of thing so like no no no\nso hanging is difficult\nbecause my arms are so long\nyep so so so when you're trying to pull\nyour back i mean when you're trying to\npop your back\nthat's not relaxation that's actually\ntension so i saw you put your your hands\nbehind your knees and then you were\npulling\nso\nlet your head hang down\nlet your arms hang that's good so put\nyour feet together\ntouching ankles touching\nokay legs straight knees straight\nthere you go so as you as you lock the\nknees and keep them straight\nhead let your head hang down\nnot back head\num\nso where does the back go yeah so you\ncan bend your back but just let your\nhead hang just feel the weight there you\ngo now just i know it's kind of weird it\ndoesn't look like it's great form\nyeah good straighten the knees and then\njust sit there like that\nlike\nfeel it in your shoulders and feel it in\nthe back of your neck you feel that\nnot really i feel like i don't see this\non the platform because my arms are kind\nof like\noh yeah\nthat's interesting\nhmm\nbut when when you let your head hang\ndoes it hang\ni don't know good question\nso i think i don't feel anything in my\nneck\nyeah but does it\nyou're not tensing it right it looks\nlike it's hanging\nyeah i think that's good\nbut\nback of my knees are tight but my head's\nflat yeah so i think i think you're\nactually gonna have to focus on the\nknees and then your head will hang\nbetter i know it's kind of weird\nbut that looks that looks good\nlike this to here yep yep it's gonna be\nyour hamstrings\nyeah right\nso you'll you'll feel it in your\nhamstrings for sure\nwhich is okay\ndon't rock\nokay yeah just just feel that tension\nand then when you're ready you can come\nback up\nand arms above your head\nnamaste position\nyes\nlet your uh let your biceps touch your\nears\ngood close your eyes reach up\nup up up up up good\nnow do you feel that kind of like right\nin your what is that your um\ntrapezius\num i feel it more here okay so so yeah\njust let me eat\nokay\ngood so close your eyes and breathe\nwonderful\nso hold that for like 20 seconds\nand now go back down\nso touch your toes you can also if\nyou're if your hands um\nif you're\nthere you go and what you did is\nnaturally is perfect you figured it out\nso now you're trying to place your palms\nflat\non the ground which is what you should\nbe doing\nmake sure you\nif you need to come up a little bit you\ncan especially if you feel tightness in\nthe hamstring but now close your eyes\nand breathe into this position\nbreathe into it\nlet your body do\nas you breathe in and out your body will\nnaturally adopt\nsmall changes\nespecially with the exhalation so just\nlet it happen don't try to do it\ngood\nso go ahead and come on back up\ncome back to\nyeah so up and then you can come down to\nnamaste position\nwhich position oh\nright and then so just close your eyes\nfor a second\ntake a second to breathe\nand i would\nkind of acknowledge that you have a lot\nbut also give gratitude\nand recognize that you're like capable\nof whatever life throws at you\nright that you're strong\nyour body supports you your mind is\npowerful\nyou have a powerful force of will\nwhich even though you have a lot on your\nplate you're going to be able to handle\nand give thanks for that\nwonderful\nis this the right arm position or sure\nyou can go up a little bit if it's tense\nup meaning you can um put your yeah\nthere you go if that feels better and\nput your fingers together\nyeah like that\ngreat\ncool\nhow long supposed to hold that for you\ncan be done whenever you're ready to be\ndone\nyou're a pro amaranth oh\nthank you\nyeah it's\ni think um yeah\ndid that feel i mean i don't know where\nyou felt you felt tightness where i was\nnot expecting you to feel tightness but\nuh you know i think that a lot of that\nstuff because it's clear that you are\nflexible and you do stretch and stuff\nlike that but really a lot of people\ndon't realize that that second posture\nyou are doing it right the second time\nwhich is that your your palms should be\nflat on the ground\noh all right\nand people don't because most people\naren't that flexible so what we tell\npeople to do is touch their toes\nyou think that tightness could be from\nsitting because the knees are always\nbent when you're sitting and they just\nkind of get used to that\nposition\nyeah so it's\ndue to sitting certainly but also like\nour hamstrings\ncertainly but even if you walk\na fair amount your hamstrings can still\nbe tight like that\nbecause it's just behind the knees it's\nnot like\nthe upper hamstrings it's definitely\nlike above and below and right behind\nthe knee that's not your hamstring then\nthat's like you're\nnot sartorious\ni'm rusty on anatomy but if it's right\nbehind the knee then\nthat's something else\nlet me i'm kind of curious now i wonder\ndo i have my anatomy textbook here\nno\ni do not\nno i do hold on one second do you have a\nsecond\nyeah\nanybody else's chat is like\nhere to here\nyeah let me tell you\nso we have a\nnetters and atlas of human anatomy which\nis rusty for sure because i don't use\nthis much as a psychiatrist\nalso though you'd be surprised at how\nmuch i do use it\nbecause i think there's a lot so head\nand neck back and spinal cord\npelvis and perineum lower limb\nlet's look at the knee plates 506 to\n512.\nso let's figure out where you're type\nnerves of the hip and buttock we don't\nwant nerves of the posterior thigh\ncross section of the leg\nhere we go\nknee lateral and medial views\nso it's could be your plantaris\nis it on the inside or the outside um\nit's like right in the middle so i don't\nknow it's so if it's right right in the\nmiddle that's your gastrocnemius maybe\nthe gastroc leg too so it's like equal\non both\nlegs show me can you point to it with\none finger\nit's like here yeah that looks like well\nyour gastrocnemius is you know like\nright uh\nso move further down the leg towards\nyour foot\nyeah so like you know if if you feel\naround there there's actually two m i'm\npointing to it you can't see yeah so\nthere's like two muscles on either side\nof where you're pointing right can you\nfeel that so that's your gastrocnemius\nright there so it's it's in between the\ngastroentemia so that may be a a ligam i\nmean it may be a ligament\nwhere's an orthopod when you need one\nor physical therapist\ni'll have to look into that but yeah so\nthat right there\nis your biceps femoris\nso i see like an indention to above the\nknee like here yeah that's because\nyou've got like\nthat's your biceps femoris muscle i\nthink okay so i'm not quite sure\nso then actually what you need to do is\nactually a different asana entirely yeah\nso it's so when you pull your it's\nthat's what you need to do so when you\nhold on a second\nall right i don't know if you guys can\nsee this but\nso\nwhat you can so what you can do is\nif you pull your toes back\nuh\ndoes that i can't hear you but hold on\nyeah i mean that's always been\ntight when i do that yeah right so\nthat's what you want to do so you want\nto touch your toes\nand lift up your toes there you go\nand then the other thing that you can do\nis this have you done this awesome\ntake your right leg put it over your\nother leg\nyeah i do that all the time and does\nthat\nwell that's nice\nthat's going to be for your back\nactually yeah so i i'm not i don't\nusually do those kinds of ascents but i\nthink it's like\num the other thing that you can do is\ngo up against\nso you can stand up against a wall and\nflex your foot\nso you can do\nuh i don't know how to demonstrate this\nbut\nso but you have to turn around and put\nyour you know\nand put your toes on the wall\nput your heel on the ground\nright heel on the ground but toes on the\nwall\ni like this yes\noh\ni don't really feel anything there huh\nit doesn't really feel like anything no\nbut but you have to raise your toes up\nso you can like flex your i i wish i\ncan't explain it\nbut\ni could\nyeah this is just this is fail\nkind of\nit's hard\nso so if if your ankle if this is your\nankle\nand\nthis is your foot you want it at this\nangle against the wall is over here\nso like we'll pretend that this box\nyep\nso it's like this yes\nokay yes at the same time or one foot no\none foot at a time and then what you\nwant to do is move forward\nso like with your body as you move\nforward it'll it'll increase that\nstretch\ndoes that make sense\nyeah i think so\nright so you should feel it in your calf\nyeah and and right beneath below the\nknee and you'll stretch out that\nligament and then if you you have your\nother foot back but if you move your\nother foot forward\ndon't hop never hop when you're\nstretching okay never hop and never\nwiggle that's how you're gonna pull\nsomething\nthere you go perfect\ncan you feel that\nyeah just do those forget about the yoga\nokay\nif i find a good asana i'll i'll dm you\nor something\noh but i'd have to do a little bit of\nresearch\nyeah that is interesting\nbecause that's probably why i have\ntrouble keeping my foot in the stirrup\nof the saddle with correct form because\nyou're supposed to have your heels down\nso it's that same angle\nlike you're riding like this yep because\nit's tight there so it probably makes\nthat make sense yeah\ncool\nany last thoughts or questions before we\nwrap up for the day\nwhat do you think about\nchiropractors you think do you believe\nin them\num so i think chiropractic has some data\nto support it\ni think that there's a high degree of\nvariability in clinical outcomes\nfor different chiropractors\nso good chiropractors are very different\nfrom bad chiropractors and what i do\nfeel pretty confident about is that many\nchiropractors\nclaim that they can treat a lot more\nthan the data suggests that they can\nbut i've just had too many patients who\nhave had\nthe science behind chiropractic is not\ngreat\nbut i've had too many patients that have\nhad very very positive outcomes for from\nchiropractic to where\ni think there's something of value there\nit's just really hard to tell what is\nand what isn't\nokay uh i actually am scheduling\na chiropractor appointment with like a\nyoutube chiropractor\num that'll be at the end of may and\nshe's gonna put it on her youtube so if\nyou wanted to watch it after i can send\nit to you you can watch with your stream\nyeah i mean and i'd love to hear just\nwhat your experience is like in terms of\nlike whether it's good or not good or\nhelps or doesn't help i think she does a\nbetter job i think than just like\npopping stuff into place because she\nactually like looks at the muscles and\nlike massages them too on the spot\nbefore\nrealignment which i think is much better\nthan a lot of them that just pop you for\n10 minutes and then you're out of the\noffice yeah so i think one of the big um\ncomplaints against chiropractic that\ni've heard from physical therapists\nis that physical therapy will s so you\ncan get adjustments or whatever the what\nwhat do they call it um\nnot manipulations that's osteopathy i\nforget what the what the term that they\nuse is but\nbut\none of the criticisms i've heard of\nchiropractic that's given by physical\ntherapists is that a physical therapist\nwill teach you how to strengthen the\nmuscles so that you don't need to be\nregularly popped into place\nyeah that's a more sustainable solution\nthere's very very good evidence behind\nphysical therapy whereas chiropractic is\nlike more\nmixed\nright um\nbut you know i'd love\ni i think it i've certainly seen them\nhelp some people a lot especially with\nmusculoskeletal issues\nyeah i think a lot of them don't address\nthe muscular\ntightness that is making your spine be\nout of alignment\nexactly\nthat's that's oftentimes\nwhat happens but we'll see\nyeah\num are you gonna be streaming still are\nyou done\nuh i'll be streaming after this yeah\nokay so i'll wrap up and then we'll just\nhead your way for a raid but thank you\nvery much\nyeah this is really fun yeah uh how did\nyou enjoy the band appeals uh i i\nenjoyed them a lot at the beginning\nand then and then i i think it's just\nlike i i'm very\num\nit just seems to be a lot that you have\nto kind of numb yourself against\nyeah that's actually my exact feeling\nevery time i do it i start off being\nlike this is interesting and then like\n30 minutes into it i'm like\nthis is disappointing\nyeah and\ni think it's the same feeling i think\nthat yeah it's like training\nit is it is and so i'm sure you get\nbetter at it like i remember when i\nfirst started doing therapy it also felt\nvery draining and now you kind of get\ngood at it and you enjoy it but but i\nthink that that's also where\ni mean like this it feels so one way\nlike in terms of band appeals like at\nleast in therapy like sure it's\nemotionally draining but you're like\nworking with someone and you guys are\nlike making progress together and\nthere's like positivity that comes after\nthe negativity whereas with vanity like\ni don't know where's the positivity like\nwhere's the end of the rainbow\nyou know right\nand it also is just making me realize\nlike i don't know what's happening on\nthe internet but\ni think like\npeople\nneed education or help or something i\ndon't know what they need but we had so\nmany questions about what makes someone\ndo this and like i don't know if we have\nan answer but i think we need to find\nout and then we need to like address it\nwhich could good punishment could\ninclude education could include\nforgiveness you know i think it's like\nall options but\nyou know\nhow did you enjoy it\ni i had the same feelings you did i\nthink um\nare there other like therapists or\npsychologists who use twitch and stream\nlike you do\ni'm sure there are other therapists or\npsychologists who are on twitch i don't\nknow if they do what we do\nyeah it'd be interesting just like\nhave different assessments of\nmy band appeals yeah and i think i've\nhad guys to review them and they're like\nwhat is this like guy streamers just\ndon't understand the stuff that girls\nget yeah\nkind of eye-opening\nit in a shocking way yeah yeah\ndo you think there will ever be a\nsolution or is it just\neducation and holding each other\naccountable\non the internet i mean i think that's a\nbig part of the solution but i do think\ni do believe these things can get better\nand i think that\npart of the hopelessness that\nthings can't get better is i don't see a\nwhole lot of concerted effort at trying\nright right so that that's where i mean\ni was at the game developers conference\nin san francisco a couple weeks ago and\neven if you look at twitch for example\nso twitch has wonderful functionality to\nmute people and ban people\nbut it doesn't have a built-in\nfunctionality to provide like positive\nreinforcement quite as robustly as it\ndoes for like\nbands right so what we're seeing in\ntechnology is that it's really easy to\nban people\nbut educating people\nencouraging positive behavior is more\ndifficult\nso twitch even has some features there\nthat i think are moving in the right\ndirection like stuff like featured chat\nand stuff like that where you can like\nhighlight positivity\nyeah i think that's cool and i think uh\na better solution but i know twitch is a\nbusiness so they would never do this but\nin theory i think it would be cool if a\nuser has gotten banned in like five or\nmore chats let's say on twitch maybe\nthey're just ip gets banned\nin general from the whole site but i\nknow they would never do that because\nmoney but i think that would be a way to\nactually combat it otherwise we'll just\nmake a new account\nyeah so my experience working with\ncorporations is that they don't seem to\nbe quite as corporate as people think\nthey are like oh they'll never do this\nbecause money like my experience even\nworking with twitch has been that like\nthey\ni tend to have a more positive view but\ni think the bigger issue is not banning\nan ip the bigger issue is like what are\nthey going to do to encourage positive\nbehavior\nright so that's where like i think\nthat's what's missing there's a vacuum\nof like all we have is punishment but\nhow is like the main question that i had\nfor a lot of these people which i think\nwe talked about is how does this person\nget feedback on how to behave because\nwhen you ban them and you don't unbe\nlike you know if they're like and\nthey're just going to go home resentful\nand then they'll show up\nwould be a better method it's finding\nout how do we do that effectively yeah\nso like you can absolutely punish bad\nbehavior but what i see on the internet\nis that we've learned how to punish\nway more quickly than we've learned how\nto like support or encourage positive\nbehavior and you see that in parenting\nas a whole right so like a hundred years\nago it was like spankings belts and like\nwhatever like you know there was like\nthis positive reinforcement\nlovey wavy stuff is like and now if you\nlook at you know\nbooks on parenting and stuff like that\nit's all about love and positive\nreinforcement we see that positive\nreinforcement changes behavior better\nbut like the internet is sort of\nfollowing the history of parenting where\nwe're learning how to punish we're\ndeveloping very sophisticated tools for\npunishment but in terms of positive\nreinforcement things are lagging behind\nyeah i think something twitch could do\nbut it would take some designing is if\nthey had a\nlike a whole\ntier of like several different emotes\nthat you couldn't access unless a\nstreamer or like a mod or a vip from a\nchat like gave you like a gold star on\nyour account and then you can unlock an\nemail the more gold stars you get the\nmore exclusive emails you have something\nlike that to encourage it\nso i think if people start actually\ndoing that and put that in their habit\nof chatting then subconsciously like\nthey would actually just become a more\npositive chatter even if they're faking\nit until they make it\nwell so there's also evidence that shows\nthat faking it until you make it\nactually does change internal behavior\nright so there's data that shows that\npunishing people does not give them an\ninternal moral compass\npositive reinforcement is how people\ndevelop an internal moral compass\nyou can learn to follow the rules\nthrough punishments but it won't change\nyour\ninternal like what is right and what is\nwrong we're taught what is right and\nwhat is wrong through positive things\nright\num but the good news is i mean i think\npeople are exploring this stuff right so\nthey they did have me at gdc which is\nlike so game developers were really\ncurious about like what can we do in our\ngame that's substantial that encourages\npositive behavior\nand so i think if we try like\ni mean we're pretty good like humans are\npretty good when we put our mind to\nsomething and i just don't think we've\ntried we haven't given it our all yet\nso i'm actually pretty hopeful\nyeah i think there's definitely room for\nimprovement i wonder if they'll actually\never take streamers advice for changing\nthe community in that kind of way\nthat'd be really interesting i mean i\nfeel like they've been pretty\nopen to hearing what\nwe've had to say\nbut i think that we may have a little\nbit of like luck there or not luck but\nwe may you know\na lot of what we say to twitch is also\nbacked by science and stuff but i think\nif you have suggestions and stuff i i\ndon't know\ni'm curious about i just have to think a\nlittle bit about that but my experience\nwith twitch has been pretty positive in\nterms of how responsive they are to\nfeedback\nokay\nand i'm way smaller than you are so\nyou're also uh more brand safe though\nbut you know after the show i'm\nrebranding so\nhopefully using the game show i'm doing\nas a way to kind of\nlaunch every branding because i feel\nlike that'll bring in a lot more\nmainstream audience who either haven't\nseen me because they're in other\npeople's communities or giving me a\nchance for a second time because the\nshow is actually really hyped so cool\nhopefully i can keep some of them by\nchanging into a more brand safe and i\ndon't like the fact that like i kind of\nfeel like i am uh\nsaying that\ni don't know like there's something\nwrong with sexuality and cleavage but at\nthe same time\nyou know it is what it is and i think\nthat rebranding is actually just better\nlong term for my goals\ni have to go with the state of reality\nsometimes\nyeah so i mean i i amaranth what i\nreally appreciate about you is that i\ndon't think you're black and white about\nthese things i think you're kind of like\nnuanced about it right there are\nadvantages and disadvantages and there's\nsomething to be said for pushing the\nenvelope and like\num\nand also for like playing by the rules\nlike so i think if everyone plays by the\nrules then we don't really ever get\nprogress\nright and at the same time progress can\nbe dangerous being on the front the\nfrontier is a dangerous place\nand something that i really appreciate\nabout what you do and it's especially\nhearing your thought process on ban\nappeals and especially the comment about\nyou know are they fake like i think that\nthat kind of stuff has really given me\nuh a new perspective which i really\nappreciate and i think you're doing some\nreally awesome work by just like\ntrying to figure out and redefine like\nwhat's okay what's not okay like what\nare you willing to do what are you not\nwilling to do how do you draw boundaries\nbecause we all say\nright that oh like women should be able\nto you know body positivity and feminism\nyou should be able to do whatever we\nwant to but we also we may say that but\nwe don't stop judging people\nright that's true we create a double\nstandard where we say one thing and we\nactually treat people like a different\nway\nand that's challenging and so i i\napplaud you for being right on that\nfrontier which i imagine has advantages\nand also like\nyou know puts you in the line of fire\nall of the ban appeals that we saw today\nwhere people are like you know sending a\nlot of toxicity away so it's tough yeah\nit's really interesting how um\ni guess maybe more common in america i\ndon't know if europe's as prudish\nbecause you know american\nculture was based on puritan values and\nstuff it's just interesting how we seem\nto\nstill have this stigma around like\nfemale body parts\neven if they're not doing anything\nsexual just like the presence of them\nseems to be a little taboo still\nlike like the undertones even if i'm\njust having a conversation it's like\nbecause i have cleavage it might be\ndeemed inappropriate even though\nchildren literally suck on titties\nfor nourishment and that's considered\nwholesome\nso it's really weird how like\nadults view it\nas the sexual thing and kids don't even\nview it as that but because the adults\nare putting such taboo things on it kids\nstart to view them differently\nlike younger than i feel like they\nshould be\nit's so weird there is a ton of social\ncommentary there not really my area of\nexpertise but i'm i'm with you and i\nthink that that's like\noh man there's just so much to talk\nabout there in terms of how do we\ndevelop\nso there's this\nset uh subset of psychoanalysis called\nobject relations\nwhich is like i'm a human and there's an\nobject right and how do i relate to this\nobject how do i think about it is it\nokay is it not okay do i judge it do i\nlike it do i dislike it and i think if\nyou look at like how we relate to\nbreasts\nyou know it's like very like a lot goes\ninto that\nyeah um and i i even sort of notice\nit's interesting to see my own reactions\nto like\nnow i have two daughters so\nhow that's changing my perspective and\nwhat kind of conditioning i never\nrealized i had\num\nbut you know i think it's it's\ninteresting and i you know i think maybe\nwe can talk later but i\nyeah i don't know how women navigate the\nworld when yeah\nit's unclear what the rules are\nright it's almost like ban appeals where\nlike no one tells you what the rules are\nbut you could just get banned or\ncanceled or whatever for doing something\nyou know yeah or you can get judged or\nor you can be successful or like you i\njust don't know how you navigate this\nworld\nyeah it's really confusing to me it is\nyeah\nanyway\nyeah\none of those things where i guess\nis what it is it just it's one of those\nthings in society where it is what it is\nyeah and also\nit doesn't have to be\nright\nyeah i think that's the tricky thing but\num thanks for doing this i i thought it\nwas educational and good luck on your\nshow and um best of luck to you well\nthank you yeah this was fun yeah take\ncare\nyou too\nokay\num\nso we i just had one thing that i wanted\nto share with y'all so we had a couple\nquestions\nso that was fun first of all interesting\nmore taxing than i expected it to be\num i think you know when we did our ban\nappeals like we actually interacted with\nthe people which i think is a little bit\nmore challenging in amaranth's case\nbut\nyou know i think it's like i don't know\nthe answers to this stuff\nand i don't know that\ni'm ever going to know the answers\nand that's where like i really think uh\ni really hope that\ny'all can figure this stuff out\nright so i'm gonna do what i can for the\ninternet and i'm gonna do what i can for\ny'all but ultimately like\nthese problems that we talked about\ntoday like toxicity on the internet and\nyou know what's appropriate to show in\nterms of cleavage or not cleavage or\nwhatever like these are kinds of issues\nthat we need y'all to fix\nbecause we can't do it all right so this\nis where like if we really want to\nchange society if we really want to\naccept people if we really want to\nunderstand people if we really want to\neducate people and even if you all\ndisagree with like some of the things\nthat amaranth said or i said and you\nwant to educate us\nother people have to step up and do it\ntoo\nand so i think it's like\nyou know\nlike this is too much for\nus to handle\nbut like thankfully it's not just us\nright so streamers have a\ncontent creators have a platform so\nthere's like we have a voice that\nreaches more people and potentially you\nhave\nbut it doesn't have to be that way\nforever\nand so i encourage each and every one of\nyou if\nyou know if you think that some behavior\nis inappropriate to like\ndo what you can in a safe and respectful\nand like compassionate way to correct it\nyou also for you to think about your own\nbehavior and how you relate to other\npeople and recognize that other people\nare like you know the the people on the\ninternet that you play against\nin your games or the streamers that you\num\nwatch right they're human beings that\nhave thoughts and feelings and hopes and\ndreams and\neven though they may like have thick\nskin or\nact a particular way it doesn't mean\nthat they don't have feelings and that\nit doesn't hurt\nand sometimes i think that like people\non the internet feel like they're\ninsignificant but that hasn't been my\nexperience at all\num\nand that you have a lot of power at your\ndisposal like you really do and comments\ncan mean a lot to people\nright like positive comments negative\ncomments like you can affect people\nyou"
