    "transcript": "so when you're a kid with adhd at the\nage of seven and everyone's in recess is\nstanding in line to get on the slide and\nwhen you have adhd and you can't stand\nin a line so you wander away and then\nyou come back and you cut\nright because you were in line you were\nahead of this kid and then you wandered\naway for a minute and now that kid is\nlike second from the front and you step\nback in front of him and you're like\nthis is my place in line and then you\ncause conflict so you can sort of like\nlook at someone who's like bipolar has\nmajor depressive disorder and you can\nsee like okay this is not how the brain\nis supposed to be working whereas the\ninteresting thing about a personality\ndisorder is that even though it causes\nthem problems it's the way that their\nbrain grew up learning how to survive\nbut it's kind of this idea that like i\ndon't know how else to say it it's just\nreplacing in your mind so when your mind\nreacts to something\nit's never and it's always but yes\nright it's either or i can be mad at you\nand still love you but someone with bpd\ncan't hold both of those thoughts that's\nwhy it's so terrifying i am self-aware\nwhen it's happening and i'm trying to\ntell myself stop thinking this calm down\nso i can't let me ask you a question\nmakes do you think that personalities\ncan change over the course of someone's\nlife\n[Music]\nwelcome\nthanks thanks for having me oh thanks\nthank you very much for coming on i know\nsometimes it makes people kind of like\nnervous anxious\nto\nbe on and we really appreciate you\nyeah\ni'm excited i'm excited and can you tell\nme first um what do you go by or what\nwould you like to be called today\nuh minx works okay and is there\nsomething in particular that you wanted\nto talk about or anything that we could\npotentially help you with\nwell nah there's so much things i need\nhelp with where there's not specific uh\nsure i'm\n[Music]\nkind of nervous i don't even know what i\nshould say first maybe maybe\nyeah maybe even if chat you push me how\nto start i'm like this is kind of\nnew for me yeah absolutely so um let's\nwe don't ever want to push you\nright okay so but we can absolutely get\nstarted and maybe what i can do is sort\nof like take the lead if that makes you\na little bit more comfortable so the\nfirst thing that i want to point out is\nthat\na lot of times if we're thinking about\nwhat we want to work on there are like\nso many different things and they're all\nlike tangled together\nand so it can feel like we don't even\nknow where to start is that kind of what\nyou're feeling\nuh yeah pretty much every single day of\nmy life\nevery single day wow that sounds\nhow do you deal with that\nnot when i well when i i take my\nadderall is what i do and then i'm\nstraight ahead focus on what i need to\ndo\nwow so it sounds like adderall really\nhelps you\nah i also think that uh\nit doesn't help me as much as i think it\ndoes i think every time it's like a\nmetal thing similar to in the past when\ni used alcohol as a like because i was\nshy or anxious where i could have one\nshot and then i'd be like social for the\nnight when realistically it's just a\nbrain thing\nyeah so i'm almost hearing that the\nadderall changes your sense of\nconfidence more than it actually changes\nyour brain and you're like yeah that\ni've taken out all i can work yeah i\nfeel like if i take it i'm like i know i\nhave to work because i'm like you know\nit's prescription it's prescribed so i'm\nlike once it's there it's like well now\ni have to work i can't just doss around\nand do nothing yeah absolutely\num can i share with you kind of an\ninteresting study i read recently about\nmedication for adhd\nyes\nso\nthey\ndid an interesting study on kids with\nadhd and\nparenting styles of kids with adhd so\nwhat they found is that when a kid has\nadhd it's very very frustrating for the\nparent\nand the parent actually will like yell a\nlot more when their child has adhd so\nkids with adhd have this thing called\npassive non-compliance where their focus\nis like so big on a particular thing\nthat the parent is kind of like talking\nto them and saying hey it's time to go\nto school it's time to go to school it's\ntime to go to school and the kid just\nisn't paying attention like that's\nthat's what adhd is right it's a problem\nwith attention\nand then eventually what happens is the\nparent yells at the kid\nand then the kid gets yelled at they get\nkind of snapped out of like what they\nwere doing\nparent is kind of frustrated and angry\nand then then the kid listens and then\nover time the parent actually learns\nto like yell more often because that's\nwhat it takes to get a kid to listen\nwith me so far yeah\nso the weird thing is that when you give\nthe kid the medication\nand you actually\ntest in a laboratory their ability to\nfocus it does not change at all\nbut what changes\nis\nthe parents behavior once a child is\nmedicated and we're not quite sure how\nthat works but something about the\nmedication allows kids to listen to\ntheir parents better even though their\ninattention score does not change so\ntheir ability to focus doesn't change\nbut it's weird so it definitely does\nchange something it improves their\nsymptoms like so if you look at like\nthem getting in trouble at school\nthem doing their homework them being\nlate to school it improves all of the\noutcomes\nthat adhd sort of causes like it causes\npeople to be spacey causes them to be\nlate causes them to be disorganized so\nit fixes all those things\nbut it doesn't actually change their\nmind's ability to like focus\nand we don't quite know why that is but\nit's really interesting what the hell no\nthat makes sense because i was like\nbecause so adhd medication in ireland\nlike in ireland when i was being\ndiagnosed like it took me months to get\ndiagnosed with bpd and i was like in the\nprocess of being diagnosed with adhd for\nmonths and then i came to america and i\nwas like oh i'll continue with but i had\nto restart and i was diagnosed within\ntwo weeks which is insane to me how\nquick it is over here and then we don't\neven have adderall in ireland we we i\nthink it's i don't even know what we\nhave because i was never on the\nmedication but like they just threw\nadderall at me immediately and i thought\nthat fixed everything but exactly what\nyou said there where i like i did a test\nwith it where i was like i'm doing\nnothing today and i had it and i i think\nit was more a mental thing where i was\nlike i should work because i've had it\nbut realistically i was able to lie it's\nweird\nyeah tell me more about that that sounds\nso i i'd love to hear kind of your\nexperience of that if you feel\ncomfortable sharing it's just i think\ni've always like i'm i kind of have a\nfear of adderall if that makes sense\nbecause it's\nit's not necessarily banned in ireland\nwe just don't have it and like it's just\ntalked about a lot where it like makes\nyou almost like you're just ooh you know\nenergy energy energy so i was always\nscared of it where the i actually i'm on\n15 mg twice a day but i don't take that\ni like break it in half and do 7.5 and\nthen if i need more of it\num but then like if i take one whole\npill even though it doesn't make a big\ndifference\nin my head i'm like whoa bro i'm so\nfocused right now\nbut it does feel like a lot of the time\nit's more me telling myself i'm focused\nthan actually feeling focused but now i\nfeel like reliant on it when i need to\ndo work like if i need to sit and do\nmeetings and stuff\ni like have to you know take an adderall\nwhich is kind of annoying because i've\nhad adhd my whole life and i was able to\nyou know survive without it until i came\nto america but now i feel like i caught\nin survivor outward\nyou can't survive without not survival\nlike do my work with it like i couldn't\nlike i feel like now i can't like go\nthrough emails for three hours or like\ndo all that well without it yeah i mean\ni think going through emails for three\nhours without it sounds terrible for\nanyone\nlet alone\nyou got me there actually\nyou know\nbecause i'm wondering then if it's if\nit's just that it's not that\nhow can i say this i i know it's kind of\nweird because that's your experience and\ni don't want to disagree with it but\nwhat i i'm wondering is whether you're\njust like doing more now like whether\nyour plate is just stacked higher with\nlike stuff to do\nthat actually could be it too because to\nbe fair when i was in ireland it was\njust me myself a nina little renovated\nmorgan here i'm like living with\nroommates and going out consistently\nbecause l.a yeah might be it too yeah\nso\nhow are you feeling now by the way are\nyou okay talking about this you feeling\nlike nervous or does this feel okay no i\nactually feel fine talking about because\ni usually don't get to talk about like\nthis stuff on my stream at all yeah can\ni i'm just so curious i'd love to learn\nmore about\nyour experience because you mentioned in\nireland it took like you were getting\ndiagnosed for months\nyeah and and can you tell me a little\nbit about what that was like\nyeah so i never um actually got\ndiagnosed in ireland with adhd i was\nlike going through a bunch of tests uh\nand it was similar where to be fair a\nlot of the time i wasn't making myself\nto go to the appointments like every two\nweeks or week because i'm like\nuh you know it's taking forever like\nwith my bpd it took like i think nine\nmonths to get properly diagnosed because\nthey didn't want to\nuh mess up the diagnosis and stuff and\ncan you help us understand what bpd is\nuh it's like borderline personality\ndisorder uh\nit's it's honestly hard to explain it\nreally has a bad rep\num\nbut i personally like think it helps me\nwith my content because if i'm like\nhaving a really bad mood swing that i\ncan't control i throw it into like you\nknow\nacting where it's like a lot of my crazy\nbits come from that but it's it it took\nmonths where it felt like a it felt\ntreacherous and honestly that's my\nquestion i'm like\namerica's so quick with diagnosis where\ni'm like are they misdiagnosed or is\nireland just so slow that took months to\ndiagnose what do you think\nyou've been evaluated in both places\nwho do you think is doing better uh\nso\nhonestly i i like how america was so\nquick because i feel like i've always\nknown i've had adhd and it was taking\nmonths like i've always been aware of\nthat but i've never like had the proper\ndiagnosis except for when i was 16 but\nlike they threw that out the window\nbecause temple street is weird it's a\nweird dublin hospital um\nbut at the same time i also worry about\nhow quick\nthey diagnosed you with it like my adhd\nwas like three\nphone calls not even meeting me in\nperson or like like three phone calls on\na questionnaire while in ireland it was\nlike i had to meet amy in person\nevery week and do different like tests\nand stuff and like\nbefore i got like diagnosed with\nanything yeah so i'm i'm\ni'm happy to share some thoughts on that\nbut i just want to make sure we're kind\nof like okay with talking about this so\ni'm gonna ask you one or two questions\nthat are like because you're you're\nsharing your\nexperience of diagnosis and i may be\nable to shed some light on that but i\nwant to ask you one or two questions\nthat are like a little bit more medical\nis that okay like you recognize we're on\nthe internet and stuff like that right\nyeah so when you were in in ireland\num\nwere you being evaluated for bpd or\nevaluated for adhd\num so i was diagnosed with bpd two years\nago but it took months but when i was in\nireland before i came to america i was\nin the middle of an evaluation for adhd\nthat was ongoing for about it was\nsomewhere between four to six months so\ndid they get sidetracked from the adhd\nand went into the bpd no so i was\ndiagnosed with bpd first before anything\num and then i like brought up amy was\njust asking she was like you know have\nyou ever looked into adhd and i\nexplained how like at 16 i was like\nbeing evaluated for it but with my\nepilepsy for some reason they just kind\nof threw that to the side\num so then she started the diagnosis for\nmy adhd but it was like four months of\nlike different kind of\ntests and stuff but to be fair this was\nalso like free healthcare like what i've\nnoticed is like yeah you pay for a lot\nin america but like they're quicker with\nwhat they do half the time\nso yeah so here's here's what i'd share\nso i think a lot of times the amount of\ntime it takes to diagnose different\npsychiatric things is different\nyeah so uh bpd is is borderline\npersonality disorder which sounds like\ndevastating like if you're just you have\na disorder in your personality you're\nscrewed for life and by the way um your\nexperience is not uncommon so i do think\na couple things i feel like we got to\ntalk about bpd for a second so the first\nis that i think bpd gets a very very bad\nrap um i think the second thing is that\na lot of very very high functioning and\nsuccessful women\nhave bpd\num\nit's\ni just it's just\nit's just facts\num so a lot of the women that i've\nworked with who have bpd are also very\nvery successful and very high\nfunctioning and something about it i\nthink is similar to what you're saying\nwhere there like something about it like\nmakes them and we could theorize more i\ncould share what my thoughts are on that\nif you're curious about that but\nmake something about\nhow sensitive they are to criticism and\nhow careful they are about like it's so\ndamn important to do a good job if\nyou've got bpd\nthat's been my experience of sitting\nwith people who have it\ni'm like honestly definitely interested\nin hearing more about bpd from you\nbecause in ireland like it was very\nvery like it yeah\nit's i feel like it's not as\nnot common but like they my first\ntherapist like she almost misdiagnosed\nme with um\nuh\nminor sociopathic tendencies\nwhich\nwhen i went to amy my new one she was\nlike that is not\nlike nowhere near you why would she say\nthat because like bpd is so like\ni guess not it's not uncommon it's just\ni feel like not really spoken about a\nlot um and then like they they just put\nme on the same like lamictal\nmood disorder pills for it but here in\namerica they won't give me my damn\nprescription\nare you joking about being frustrated\nabout that are you actually frustrated i\ncan't tell\nit's just kind of annoying because they\nwon't give me it they're like no this is\nan irish prescription and i'm like mate\nyou gave me adderall within two weeks\nand you can't see my name is on these\npapers\nand they don't want to prescribe it\nno they don't do they think you\ndo you mind if i ask them questions like\nnot so much about your diagnosis and\nstuff but what's that like in terms of\nlike what have you explained to them\nwhat do they understand do they not\nthink that you need it do they disagree\nwhat they\nwant me to go through another like they\nwant me to re like they want to\nre-diagnose me because they said like\nla michtel is one of the minor ones they\nthink i should be on like\ni don't know what the pill is called\nit's like a mix between depressive and\nmood disorder one so they want to kind\nof completely restart from the beginning\ndo a fresh diagnosis that isn't from you\nknow ireland and then give me something\nbut i don't want to go through that i\njust want my goddamn lamigdal\nand so it sounds like when mctill helps\nyou\nuh it's once again the kind of thing\nwhere\nit might it\nmaybe i over think that it helps me and\nit doesn't help me because that's what\nmy but my mom every time i call her\nhaving a little breakdown she's like get\nback on your limital and i'm like\nmother i cannot america is keeping it\naway from me that's so weird so they're\nthey're really quick to diagnose adhd\nand not so quick to die\nthat's that's strange right because\nadderall is a controlled substance it's\na stimulant\nback when i was in residency one month's\nsupply of adderall you could sell for a\nthousand dollars in in boston that was\nthe street valley you know i'm gonna be\nkeeping that i ain't i don't know i\ndon't know i don't know if it's still\nthe case but that's what you know\nhey i'm gonna be rich\nthat that's just what i heard from you\nknow my patients who were testing\npositive like you like i'd be working in\nthe emergency room and someone comes in\nthey test positive for adderall they\ndon't have a prescription i'm like you\nhaired that huh\nyeah don't worry\nmix you are awesome to talk to\noh thank you i i i needed that i needed\nthat\nno seriously\nit's it's been a long time since someone\nimplied that i was selling drugs on the\nstreet it's been many many years now i\ndidn't imply it you see the wings no no\ni know i know i know that's me that's me\nprojecting right i'm reading into it\nit's actually completely neutral now\nyou've admitted to your own fault i\ncan't help you here well done well done\nfor you i've been i've been\nactual checkmated signature\num\nanyway what were we talking about oh\nyeah so so\nyeah i i think so let's just talk about\nthe diagnosis of of bpd for a second\num and you know i can pull out the the\nipad and draw if that helps at some\npoint okay if i'm saying things that are\nlike hard to follow without visuals\nbecause i know also sometimes people\nwith adhd really really benefit as being\nvisual learners\num so if that would help just let me\nknow okay\nsee i'll be real with you it would help\nbut me admitting a drawing would help as\na 25 year old grown woman on the\ninternet it's kind of embarrassing but\nuh yeah pictures actually do help me pay\nmore attention oh yeah so let's do it\nthen because i mean that's that has\nnothing to do with you being 25 years\nold like\nyou know drawings help all humans\nand especially when\nit's like weird confusing stuff okay\nhold on a second so this is going to\nturn into a lecture are you okay with\nthat like a little one and then please\nask questions\nokay so minx i'm gonna need your help\nall right\nyes so here's what i need you to do\nso i'm gonna give a lecture\nbut my class size is going to be\nhold on\nis going to be like kind of like one\nbecause you're the only person i can\ntalk to right now okay so what that\nmeans is that if i say something that\ndoesn't make sense\nyou're the only person who can let me\nknow\nokay\nso what i'm going to need you to do is\nlike pretend like you're you\ni need the activity from you that i\nwould get from 30 students sitting in a\nclassroom can you see this by the way\nit's just gonna be a black screen i can\nsee it\nokay then we're gonna do this all right\nso let's start so you can see you can\nsee this right\nyeah okay so let's run through a couple\nof different things about your\nexperience the first is that\nso there's bpd\nthere's adhd\nand a couple other things that we\nnoticed is that it took you six months\nto get diagnosed\nin ireland\ntwo weeks\nin the u.s\nokay so like what's going on here how do\nwe make psychiatric diagnoses\nso for for bpd it was nine months but i\nwas in the middle of four six months for\nthe adhd but never got fully diagnosed\nwith it and then i came to america and\nwent to continue and then it was just\ntwo weeks off the bath beautiful\nbeautiful in the sense i love that level\nof participation\nokay\num oh sorry you uh you said two weeks\nright is how long it took you in the us\nyeah\nso let's first talk about how these\ndiagnoses are different\nso um has anyone explained to you or do\nyou understand what the difference\nbetween a personality disorder and a\nnon-personality disorder are\nuh personality disorders in your brain\nand cannot be fixed with meds\nvery very good answer yeah so\nwe have this thing called a personality\nright\nand our personality is sort of like\nthe way that we perceive the world\nand also the way that we react to it\nso it's like\nyou know if you think about what's the\ndifference between two people's\npersonality it's like you know if if\nboth of us show up to a party\nthis the situation is exactly the same\nbut the way that will perceive the\nsituation oh is everyone like looking at\nme and making fun of what i'm wearing or\noh yeah this is awesome like everyone's\nso excited to see me like even though\neveryone's sort of acting the same way\ntwo different people could perceive it\ndifferently and then the way that we\nrespond to that situation\nalso changes does that make sense yeah\nokay\nso personality disorders also tend to be\nlike developed early on so our brain\nlike develops like a way of interacting\nwith the world\nand then that pattern\nof like how we perceive\nand how we behave\nis sort of who we are\nand then if that if that\ngets laid down in a particular way that\ncauses us suffering or some kind of\nimpairment and function if it causes\nproblems\nwe call it a personality disorder does\nthat make sense yes she do be causing\nproblems yep and we'll talk a little bit\nabout benefits of personality issues in\na second but\nso the key thing about the personality\ndisorder is that if you look at a human\nbeing\na human being let's say like this is\nyour\nstress level\nuh so\num your stress level like that a tiny\nbit bigger uh we're talking about my\nstress levels like huge oh moon and back\nyep okay\nworried about heart there stress levels\nwhen i get that pickle and ex\nokay no the line never goes down\noh we'll talk about that we'll talk\nabout how the line never goes down\nthere we go\noh this is gonna be good okay don't let\nme forget about that okay minx okay\nso the key thing about the reason so\npersonality disorders generally speaking\nare supposed to take a long time to\ndiagnose and the reason for that is that\nif i'm stressed out i'm gonna be\nbehaving in like\na\nmore impaired way right if i'm going\nthrough a temporary period of stress\ni'll be lashing out at people my mood\nwill be more irritable i'll have\ndifficulty sleeping i'll feel bad about\nmyself does that make sense\nbut it's just like it's like stress\nlet's say like finals time for example\nor if someone you know loses their job\nor if there's a death in the family or\nyou have a breakup or something like\nthat there are all kinds of temporary\nthings that will make you feel worse\ncause problems and impair function with\nme\nso the reason that we need time to\ndiagnose a personality disorder is if we\nlook at like let's say\num someone without a personality\ndisorder\ndude makes you're so good at this\nbecause this is what someone with a\nnon-personality disorder may look like\nor yeah those lucky\nyeah they\nthey certainly are\nor actually that's probably a better\nthing so they may have so if you look at\njust one point in time if we look at\nlike this\none month period\nfor someone with a personality disorder\nand without a personality disorder it\nactually looks the same\nthat's why we need a lot of time because\nis this your\nbase like is this just who like is it\npart of your personality or is it a\ntemporary effect\ndue to stress does that make sense that\nmakes a lot of sense actually yeah okay\nso this is why generally speaking it\ntakes months it's supposed to take about\nsix months\nokay\nright to diagnose a personality disorder\nbecause you need to see people through\nthe ups and downs you need ups and you\nsee you need downs and when you kind of\nlike remove the ups and downs of\ntemporary stress from the equation what\nyou're left with is like their general\nway of functioning their default way of\nperceiving and behaving\ndoes that make sense that actually makes\nso much sense because i was so confused\nwhy i was taking so long nine months for\nsomething that you know isn't even fully\nmedicated i thought they were just\ndusting around but that actually makes\nso much sense because everyone has\nstress everyone has different that oh my\ngod yeah so let's see\nuh i don't know about that i think\nyou're helping me a lot here this was\nthis is all you minks this is all you\nso we're we're gonna do it together okay\nyes okay so now let's talk about\nmedication\nso i know it sounds kind of weird\nokay i'm gonna ask you questions minx\nbut i think you're gonna don't worry\nabout giving me the right answer i just\nneed someone to interact with and you\nunfortunately are the person on stream\nso what does medication do what do you\nthink it does\nthat's kind of weird supposed to help\nyeah and how do you think it helps\nby\ncalming my\nmind when i'm about to blow up from\nsomething so small that it doesn't\nmatter\nyep very good okay so\nand so like if we think about a\nmedication like when you take adderall\nlike that's a physical pill\nright\nhow do you think and our mind is not\nphysical right so how do you think what\ndoes the adderall do where does it go in\nyour body and what does it act on my god\nmy stomach\nokay\nwait what the hell no now i'm getting\nfreaked out okay no what does that\nreally do how does it affect me yeah\nyou're good good where does it go after\nthe stomach\nout my [ __ ]\nif it just slot\nokay so it gets absorbed to the\nbloodstream\nokay right it gets digested\nyes and then it goes to your brain\nokay\nokay two different answers there well i\nwas pretty close\nthis is a great\noh my god\nthis this is so much better than\nteaching at harvard medical school let\nme tell you what\noh my god i would i would still be there\nif i had students like you\nokay\nand and then it like it does stuff to\nyour neurotransmitters right\nthis is am i what your neurotransmitters\nhave you heard of these\nyeah have you heard of like serotonin\nand like dopamine\nand all this crap like we have wait okay\nso what's the difference between\nserotonin and dopamine great question i\nthought serotonin was like happiness but\ni think i was wrong with that\nyeah so this is where so here's the\nthing to understand about\nneurotransmitters so we have things like\ndopamine\nwe have things like serotonin\nwe also have\nuh you know noradrenaline let's say\nso the thing to understand is that\nneurotransmitters are like letters of\nthe alphabet\nso like if i have a c and t\ni can put these together\nto form cat or tac or whatever they're\njust signals and so what they do\ndepends on like how you arrange them and\nwhat part of the brain they're in so\npeople think that dopamine is for\nexample like the happiness\nneurotransmitter or serotonin is the\nhappiness neurotransmitter but dopamine\nfor example governs reward\nso when you do something that's fun and\nyour brain is like oh i want more of\nthat that's governed by dopamine but\ndopamine also does things like smooth\nmovement\nso for example like if i wave my hand up\nand down my ability to control that is\nactually due to dopamine\nso they do yeah it's kind of all kinds\nof weird things so serotonin also\ngoverns like whether you have diarrhea\nor not in the gi system so well said you\nsay you were right about it goes out the\n[ __ ] that's all adderall will\nstimulate that too it'll affect adderall\nwill actually affect your appetite\nright so i don't know if you've\nexperienced that yes so so\nyou know we got to be we got to be clear\nthat's why we got to be clear i don't\nknow lost to me a nice little 15 pounds\non that pill yeah right so it actually\ndoes all kinds of stuff so\nneurotransmitters do all sorts of things\nand generally speaking people have a\nsimplistic view of them so this involves\ngi health\nin your gi tract\nthis also includes motor stuff\nso there are all kinds of different\nneurotransmitters do all sorts of\ndifferent stuff it just depends on where\nit is so it's kind of like a building\nblock it's just a chemical signal in the\nbrain but like\nyou know\num\nwhere that signal is and what's\nreceiving it will determine what it does\nright so like let me just i'm trying to\nthink this is gonna be a terrible\nanalogy okay\nso\nif someone let's say i'm lying in bed at\nnight and someone puts their arm around\nme and says i love you\nthat signal\nmeans very different things whether i'm\nat home and in bed with my wife versus\ni'm sleeping in a hotel room on my own\nright\nif you're on your own that's the ghost\nmate yeah that's what i'm saying exactly\nright so even though the stimulus is\nexactly the same\nthe the meaning of it and the effect of\nit is completely different\nbecause one is comforting and one is\nterrifying even though technically the\nwords are the same the feeling is the\nsame you with me\noh yeah ew\nright it's a terrible analogy but okay\nso that's where these neurotransmitters\nare just different chemical signals in\nthe brain and what they govern so\nserotonin like people think about\nserotonin as happiness because\nwhen someone has something like major\ndepressive disorder or mdd and we give\nthem a serotonin boosting agent\nwhat we find is that their depression\ngets worse oh it gets better so their\ndepression goes down and they feel\nbetter\nso what we sort of do is we assume that\na serotonin deficiency is causing\ndepression\ndoes that make sense\nyes but it's not i mean serotonin does a\nlot more than that\nokay and it's dopamine\ndopamine the adderall helps\noh yeah\nso so don't\ndie they're so confusing they're all\nlike the same thing but different oh\nyeah no it's it gets even more confusing\nlike so here's the way that uh let me\njust think about whether i want to go\ninto this so okay is that why mdma is\ncalled\nbecause mdd mdma\nis an mdma like happiness\nuh\nno i don't think those are related\nokay um so mdma\nmdma gives people a sense of connection\nso it does help with potentially mdd but\nyou're you're right but for the world\nare those like\nare those like drugs then like they\nboost your dopamine no so so\nlet's talk about mdd\nso this is depression\nand mdma\nokay\nlet's talk about how this works so mdma\nwhich i do not recommend people use is\nalso called ecstasy\nright\nyeah\nand generally speaking makes people feel\nvery connected to each other\nright what the hell\nuh i i don't know i've never tried it\nbut that's what i hear so let's talk a\nlittle bit about sure doc\nwell said thanks\nokay\nso let's talk about depression so in\ndepression what people get stuck on is\nthinking about themselves\nin a negative way\nso when i'm depressed\ni'm just thinking oh my god like i'm\nsuch a terrible person\neveryone else would be so much better\nwithout me\num you know like\nlike my family would be happier if i\nwasn't around they think all these like\nweird bizarre thoughts i don't know if\nyou've experienced that or if you have\nfriends like this are you kind of you\nknow people feel that way and depression\nthey always like think bad about\nthemselves\nyeah\nso what happens here is we have this\npart of the brain called the default\nmode network and i know the acronyms are\ngetting crazy here but the default mode\nnetwork is the part of our brain that\nthinks about us\nso this is what separates humans from\nanimals\nright so animals don't think about\nthemselves\nwe think about ourselves and when\neverything in our life becomes all about\nme me me me me\nbut in a bad way we get stuck thinking\nabout ourselves i can't think about\nsomething else i can't just sit outside\nand enjoy the sun because all i'm\nthinking about my my mind is like it's\nstuck on this thought that i'm a\nworthless person\ndmiu huh\ndo monkeys have it aren't monkeys the\nclosest to humans uh so they may have a\nvery primitive default mode network but\ni don't think it's nearly as developed\nas ours\nreally\nso we're basically stuck thinking about\nourselves and so if i had to hypothesize\nhow mdma can help\nis that remember mdma creates a sense of\nconnectedness so i think it kind of\nstops this action of the default mode\nnetwork where all we're thinking about\nis ourselves we're able to start\nthinking about other people and like\nconnecting with other people and there\nare even studies that show that\nsome of these uh drugs which are now\nbeing used as treatments for depression\nlike ketamine work oh i've heard about\nthe ketamine treatment the ketamine\nactually shuts off the default mode\nnetwork so we've figured out how\nketamine helps people with depression\nand the really interesting thing is that\nketamine is the fastest acting treatment\nfor depression that we've ever\ndiscovered\nokay so i heard about it my friend\nshe was telling me that she she might be\ngoing for it but\nin ireland ketamine is known as horse\ntranquilizer\nsure\nso\nketamine is also used in anesthesia\nwhat the frick\nyeah\nso\nso it because what ketamine does is it\nkind of like it's a dissociative agent\nso we'll use it in anesthesia to like\nif we're doing surgery on someone\nbecause they kind of get like\ndisconnected from themselves\nwhat the hell why is everything the same\nit all loops back in together ketamine\nis in anesthesia\nthat well yeah i mean you're not the\nonly one right so if we look at other\ndrugs for anesthesia like nitrous oxide\npeople love that stuff too\ni don't know what that is uh that's like\nlaughing gas\nokay i thought that was anesthesia\nyeah it is it is anesthesia okay right\nso a lot of the anesthetic agents can be\ndrugs of abuse\nand and so you're right it all like yeah\ni mean it all\nyeah makes you're right it all connects\nokay\nshould we go about oxy\nokay oxy is an opiate\nokay okay listen do you know i had a\nrun-in with oxy so in ireland oxy's like\nbanned\ncompletely banned\nhere i had like surgery uh last year at\nthe end of last year and they gave me\noxy\nand i didn't even know anything about\ndidn't know what it was but i would like\ngo live and i'd be like yo i'm feeling\ngood i'm feeling loopy and then my\nmother who was a nurse and a special\nneeds assistant once she found out i was\non it she was like please\nget off that please for me get off that\nit's addicting\nand then i did get off it like i\nthrew it away and stuff\nbut i didn't realize like it's a huge\nthing here in america\nyeah so a couple years ago i'll tell you\na story so a couple years ago i was\ntalking with\nsome people who were in the leadership\nof the american psychiatric association\nand i was telling them hey i think\ntechnology addiction is a huge problem\ni think that people are starting to get\naddicted to technology i think it's\ncausing a lot more problems than we\nrealize\ni think we need to take this a little\nbit more seriously they were very very\nnice and very supportive but their\nresponse was right now this country is\ndying of opiates\noxies are like killing people at an\nalarming rate and we have to fix that\nproblem first\nand so it's really challenging but what\nhappened to you is very common where\nwhere people like because people who\naren't that familiar with addiction are\nusually the ones prescribing oxy right\nyou'll get like surgery or you'll go to\nthe emergency room with like a sprain or\nsomething like that and a surgeon will\njust prescribe oxy because that's you\nknow it works really well\nand it and oftentimes like if you really\nthink about it\nyou know surgeons don't really sit down\nwith you and ask you about like you know\ndo you use drugs or they'll maybe will\nask you do you use drugs then you say no\nand they're like all right\nhere's a prescription feel like a\nwarning should be like in place though\nbecause i have no idea i was just like\nokay this is gonna like make me feel\nbetter after surgery and like if my mom\nhad not told me\nbecause i was i would obviously i was\nenjoying those pills they were putting\nlike making my pain go away but i was\nalso feeling like\ngiddy\ni'm just i'm a mama's girl and i trust\nher where the moment she asked me to\nstop i stopped it and i went on\num i think it was like\ntitle no um which did not it barely\nhelped what's weird it's weird why do\nthey give it up so easily especially\nlike i feel like you know i'm irish i\nhave an irish passport not even a state\nlike they gave it so easily to me\nyeah so\nthat's a complicated that answer is\ncomplicated but the short answer that\ni'd give you is that\nmany many years ago when oxy came out\nthe drug companies that made oxy\nreally really pushed it and were\nprobably not entirely honest\nabout how addictive it was\nbut they probably knew that it was very\naddictive and knew that it was very\neffective and so what they ended up\ndoing is like sending a bunch of like\npharmaceutical reps and then it\nessentially like became the standard of\npractice in medicine very quickly and so\npeople just started like prescribing oxy\nbefore they realized how bad it was and\nnow the problem is that\nit's so\nall over the place like you can think\nabout it like almost like a smartphone\nwhere like now like everyone has\ninternet on their phone and it's it's\npermeated the the american medical\nsystem so heavily\nthat it's really hard to like go back\nand like change\nthings now\nso it because a bunch of doctors just\ngot trained in using it\nright it's so weird yeah it's it's bad\nman\nand then like now we have like fentanyl\nand then\ni've heard of fentanyl actually do you\nmind if i run to toilet sorry no go for\nit\nthank you\nokay i guess this is a dr k talks about\ndifferent drugs\nstream\nyeah\nyeah oh yeah i i know that we started\noff with the diagnosis of bpd i didn't\nforget but it's good i mean we can\nit's important so so you know she's\nsaying that like i didn't know that oxy\nwas a problem and like that why do you\nall think we're talking about this now\nright because there's a very good chance\nthat there are people out there right\nnow that you're gonna get dental surgery\ndone\nyou're gonna get like a tooth taken out\nand your dentist will prescribe an\nopiate pain medication\nand you may be one of the unlucky people\nthat has a genetic predisposition to\nopiate addiction\nand then it will transform your life\nlike it'll be so amazing\nit's going to help with the pain so much\nright and so you all need to know these\nthings because i don't know\nyou know how many hours of education\ndentists get about like how to deal with\naddictions how to screen for addictions\ni'm sure they get trained i mean they\nobviously they know and\nmust know that opiates can be addictive\nthere's no question about that but it's\njust in terms of like there's a\ndifference between telling a dent a\ndental student\nopiates are addictive and like really\nequipping them with the clinical skills\nto evaluate whether\na particular patient is vulnerable to\naddiction\nso for example i've been to the dentist\na ton of times\nno dentist has ever asked me do i have a\nhistory of opiate\naddiction in my family which is probably\na question they should all ask before\nthey prescribe it to you\nright like but it's just not a big part\nof their training\nthat's so crazy\nlike america's so\nno offense man\namerica's so insane\nyeah\nlike i feel like ireland's on the other\nend of the shtick though where they\nrefuse to like give out like my older\nsister just got diagnosed with adhd\nrecently and they refused to give her\nany meds which i don't\nthink meds are okay needed no a\ncontroversial opinion\ntell me\ni just i'm like\nyou know i feel like\nmaybe it's just different for me like\nwell since i've started taking adderall\nit makes me\nway more work focused but i also feel\nlike\nnot meaner but i want to get work done\nbecause like i said i've taken it and it\nfeels like even though it doesn't drain\nmy like\nloudness character i feel more serious\nwhen i have it and i'm just like\ni don't know man i'm like\nlet nature take its course\nso you're i'm confused by that are you\nsaying that so i'm hearing that it helps\nyou\nbut yeah but so where i am right now if\ni was to go back to ireland i won't have\nadderall and right now i rely on\nadderall a lot and maybe that's my own\nmental\nissue with it but like that's why i\nsplit it in half because i'm like don't\nwant to run out of it don't want to do\nthat if i'm splitting it in half and not\neven taking my right dosage\nyeah what what uh so that like i would\nnot recommend but it's something that\ni've dealt with can i are we done with\nthe lecture you want to talk about this\nfor a second or you want me to keep\ndrawing oh yeah we can talk about that\nokay give me just one second okay let me\njust\nstop sharing this move you back over\nhere let's talk about this this is very\nimportant to talk about\nso\nokay\nso\ni'll can i share with you what my\nexperiences of of patients who take half\nthe medication they're supposed to\nyeah so generally speaking i don't think\nit's a good idea and here's why\nso i've had lots of patients who like\nyou\nhave adhd and are terrified of becoming\ndependent on adhd medication\nalso terrified of doing things like\nrunning out because if i run out then\ni'll be non-functional so it's almost\nlike you're saving for a rainy day or\nlike preparing for winter right where we\ngot to make sure\nwe have lots of potatoes in the basement\nin case we run out of potatoes\nis that an attack on the famine duck\njust because i'm irish\nyou could have said brussels sprouts but\nyou chose potatoes well i don't think\nbrussels sprouts can be stored for a\nlong time right it's got me there you\ngot me there so carrots potatoes root\nvegetables\nturnips i could have said turnips and\nbeen more culturally sensitive\nyeah\num but maybe maybe i did think potatoes\ni don't know\nmaybe it's just because i grow potatoes\nso i was thinking about building a root\ncellar you roped hail oh yeah they're\nvery easy to grow\nwait really is it like just potatoes or\nyou have like a little vegetable garden\nwell the only things that are left now\nare are potatoes but i used to have okra\npeas\ni tried growing melons they didn't\nreally grow very well the thing is not\nlike a comfort thing or you just wanted\nyour garden to look nice or it was like\ntherapeutic because i've heard plants\nare therapeutic uh so there's all kinds\nof reasons but the short answer is i\nlike gardening and i wanted to eat some\nof the food so peas is a good example of\nit's very hard to get fresh peas\nand i've grown tomatoes and stuff and\nlettuce and so like lettuce and stuff is\nfantastic because think about lettuce is\nlike you buy some lettuce right but then\nfirst of all it's getting really\nexpensive and secondly like for the\nfirst day you have fresh lettuce but\nthen if you want to eat it like a week\nlater it's going to be like not very\ngood so what i really like about lettuce\nis you can just cut off as many leaves\nas you want to eat on a particular day\nand the lettuce will just keep growing\n[Music]\nyeah so what you don't have to harvest\nno you just you just snip whatever\nleaves you want it just keeps growing\nhow long does it take to grow less\nprobably like\nsix weeks for it to be harvestable in\nsome way and then it just keep it just\nhangs out for like three months and you\nhave fresh lettuce whenever you want it\nit's great\nhighly recommend it this is actually a\nlife hack\nit's actually a life hack they have less\nthat goes stale in my fridge because i'm\nlike okay peeling it off the sphere of\nlettuce yeah i know that's not the name\nno sphere of lettuce sounds great\nso the other thing about potatoes is you\njust stick them in the ground and they\njust grow\nthey just like keep growing you just\nlike reach into the ground you just pull\nout a potato\ni know nothing about gardening okay i'm\nactually shocked right now oh yeah\nlike you know you see an oak tree it\ntakes 70 years to grow i'm just\nsurprised that less takes a month\nyeah two weeks some of that stuff takes\nweeks\noh\ni need to get i need to get some less\nyeah it's i highly recommend it the one\nthing is my lettuce started getting\nbitter like i don't know if you've had\nlike bitter lettuce and i could never\nfigure out why it was bitter and i\ncouldn't make it kind of sweet\nso i've never had better or less that\nsounds like a big you issue are you sure\nyou're not like eating some\nweird\nbitter you've had bitter less yeah kind\nof bitter has like a better taste to it\nmaybe it is a problem and now you're\nfrightening me\nno it was like fresh but it was just had\nthis bitter taste to it\noh okay\nand you just ate it you just kept eating\nit did which now i'm beginning to\nrealize may have been a mistake you were\nlike well you know i myself it might\ntaste better mike could be in a [ __ ]\nless that tastes like piss and he'd be\nlike well i group myself bought a petite\nfair enough\nyeah maybe i should have paused a little\nbit there i\nuh\nlike did you did you put it in boiling\nwater\nlettuce no i ate it raw i mean that's\nreally\nyeah do you cook your lettuce\nyeah\ni thought you were supposed to boil it\nto get the insects off\nno you can wash it\nbut but do you boil lettuce\ndo you cook your lettuce usually you eat\nit in salad\nlet us know why you buy it from the\nstore i just assume because there's dart\non it\nyeah it could have been a problem now\nthat i think about it anyway i don't\nhave lettuce anymore like i said all\ni've got left is potatoes and sweet\npotatoes the problem with sweet potatoes\nis that they are very big but don't\ntaste very sweet\nfeel like maybe your garden isn't really\nwork like oh your sweet potatoes don't\ntaste sweet your lettuce tastes better\nthat's two big big big issues there well\nlook you're proud of it you're proud of\nit so i'm look good on you for growing\nit but don't eat stuff that doesn't\ntaste like that\non the upside on the upside my peas are\nexcellent\nlike amazing like better than\nmost of what i've tasted well you don't\nhave your peas anymore yeah i mean\nbecause they're a winter crop so they're\nthey're gone now\noh they grow in the winter\nhow do i get peas\nright now answer that and to read that\nriddle meet up there may be some kind of\nhydroponic sort of stuff where you can\ngrow it in certain kinds of controlled\nenvironments that's also why peas are\nfrozen right so if you like wanted to\nbuy peas right now and you went to the\ngrocery store you would not find fresh\npeas you don't see fresh peas at the\ngrocery store you just see frozen peas\nso they freeze\nthem okay i'm so stupid i didn't even\nrealize this\noh my god i'll never be a farmer man my\nancestors are crying and rolling over in\ntheir bed\nwell i didn't know any of this you know\nit's it's interesting that you mentioned\nthat because there's actually an\ninteresting theory that\nnot really that scientifically valid i\ncan go into the data if you really want\nto that people with adhd were like not\nfarmers so there are some societies that\nhad were more hunter-gatherers and those\nsocieties actually have a higher genetic\npredisposition for adhd so even\nif you're thinking about a hunter well\nif you think about a farmer they wake up\nat the same time they do the same damn\nthing every time all day\nwake up at 5 a.m they water this they do\nthis they do this they do this they go\nto bed at the same time right same\nroutine routine routine routine routine\nroutine they never get bored they're\nhappy yeah some people are\nand then you have hunters who are like\nout in the wilderness they're like\nthinking about this thing they're\nlistening to the sound over here looking\nat this footprint over here they're\nsmelling this thing oh there's a little\nbit of like fur over here and so they're\nlike integrating a lot of stimuli and\nthey don't need to be focused on one\nthing at the same time and in fact the\nmost successful hunters were the ones\nwhose attention could bounce all over\nthe place\nand so there's\nsome evidence\nthat\nsocieties that have more hunter gatherer\na greater amount of hunter gathering as\nopposed to farming have a higher genetic\namount of predisposition towards adhd\nbecause it was actually more adaptive\nthe problem is that there's larger\nstudies where we look at that more\nclosely and it turns out that that\ndoesn't seem to be quite as simple as\nthat or may not even be true\nbut it's an interesting hypothesis that\nadhd is essentially an outgrowth of like\nvariable attention in hunter-gatherer\nsocieties\nthat's actually so interesting\nholy\ngod it's actually so impressive how you\nbring it back around like\ni know i got sidetracked with the\nvegetable thing but like\nso i'm a hunter\noh yeah that's why you're so successful\nas a streamer right so like so this is\nthe other thing\ni am beginning to think also that adhd\nmay be an adaptive advantage for content\ncreation\ni actually agree with that um\nthat's why i said i said i'm like why\ntake why take adhd medication when you\ncan let it out and be funny and like be\nall over the place and keep going i feel\nlike that's that's that's something i\nalways say i think my bpd and my adhd\nhas helped me grow because i'm sure you\nknow what bpd\ni feel like i can half the time i don't\nknow who i am like i disassociate a lot\nbecause i see a person and i mimic them\nto fit in\num so with streamers i feel like i can\nyou know\nmimic not mimic but like\nsee how they act and then act like them\nand fit in perfectly and i feel like\nthat's what really helped me\ngrow and like\nhave kind of a foot\nin this industry\nyeah so it sounds like you can be what\npeople need you to be\nyeah\nyeah well i feel like that's normal\nthough like every you know i feel like\neven for like every friend group you're\na different person\nwell so this is the interesting thing so\ni think people with bpd may be\nparticularly good at that right so\neveryone is going to adapt some\nbut then sometimes you'll have people\nwho like stick out like a sore thumb you\nknow like\nthey're just not\nable to adapt the other really\ninteresting thing about adhd is there's\nstudies that show that\nthis is wild okay\nso\npeople were looking at how often people\nhave adhd and depression\nso\nif you have depression as a kid\njust toss out a number minx what\npercentage of people who you think have\ndepression as a kid grow up to be\ndiagnosed with adhd\ni'm setting you up\ni'm setting you up to it's two point\nseven percent\nthree percent\nokay now hold on a second\nwhat percentage of kids with adhd grow\nup to have depression\ntwo percent\nfifty to seventy percent\ni debated you there\nthat supposed to make sense\nhuh\nhow does that make sense it's\nfascinating\nso if you're a child with adhd the\nlikelihood that you'll be depressed as\nan adult is between 50 and 70\nbut so people were trying to figure out\nif a kid has adhd and depression\nor do they just happen together or does\none cause the other but kids with\ndepression don't grow up to have adhd\nbut kids with adhd grow up to have\ndepression and this is really\nfascinating a big part of this\nis discordant relationships so when\nyou're a kid with adhd at the age of\nseven\nand everyone's in recess is standing in\nline to get on the slide and when you\nhave adhd and you can't stand in a line\nso you wander away and then you come\nback and you cut\nright because you were in line you were\nahead of this kid and then you wandered\naway for a minute and now that kid is\nlike second from the front and you step\nback in front of him and you're like\nthis is my place in line and then you\ncause conflict so kids don't like kids\nwith adhd they feel very lonely they're\nisolated\nthey can't attend to conversations they\ncan't pay attention\nso you know what kids end up doing\n[Music]\nthey end up becoming funny\nthey end up being the class clown\nbecause i don't have to know what's\ngoing on but if my mind is fast and i\ncan make some fart joke\nor if i can fart in front of this\nteacher everyone will laugh\nand so kids are actually with adhd are\nvery isolated growing up they have a lot\nof social problems\nand that's part of the reason they\nprobably get depressed\nis adults because they don't they're\nit's difficult but what they what they\ndo end up doing is being funny just like\nyou minx\nright because you're very good at being\noh there's always a win huh we're always\nlooking at the wind side you might grow\nup alone might you know years of turmoil\nwith no friends well look at me now\nreally funny\nand a woman\nsorry that was a low blow\ni think women are funny i it's just i've\nseen comedians say that i just i'm a\nwoman i can now now now i'm bottling it\nso we're gonna change back to adhd doc\nwhat how about that you just okay sure\ni didn't catch that i didn't quite\nfollow but um yeah back to adhd so\ngoing back to diagnosis so remember\nthere's personality diagnosis which\ntakes a long time because we have to see\nfluctuations\nand then there are things like adhd so\nthere are some diagnoses which you can\ndo faster\nbecause they're essentially malfunctions\nso you can sort of like look at someone\nwho's like bipolar has major depressive\ndisorder and you can see like okay this\nis not how the brain is supposed to be\nworking\nwhereas the interesting thing about a\npersonality disorder is that even though\nit causes them problems it's the way\nthat their brain grew up\nlike learning how to survive\nso for example\npeople with bpd will have one of the\nfeatures of it is a fear of abandonment\nand the reason for that is because\noftentimes people with bpd like got\nabandoned in some way growing up\nso their brain is like this is bad let's\nmake sure this never happens again\nwe want to watch out for this and we\nneed to be terrified of this and so that\ntheir brain forms with a fear of\nabandonment\nright that's not it's not a bug it\nbecomes a feature so we need to protect\nourselves from being abandoned because\nit hurt so damn much the last time we\ndon't want it to ever happen again\nso then i have a because you know you've\nyou've\nobviously you know your [ __ ]\nis there any way a bpd brain can stop\nbecause the most annoying thing\nis i am self-aware when it's happening\nand i'm trying to tell myself stop\nthinking this calm down\nso i can let me ask you a question mix\ndo you think that personalities can\nchange over the course of someone's life\nyes\nthen the answer to your question is yes\ni completely agree with you\nright so the way that we perceive\nand behave can change\nand so the good news is that there is\ndata that shows that bpd can essentially\nbe cured\nlike cure is like it's a weird word but\nessentially\nyou can have sustained remission after a\ncertain amount of like time and\ntreatment or even stable relationships\nso\npeople have done studies that show that\n50 pro we don't 100 know about this but\nbeing in a stable relationship for two\nyears\ncan potentially\nnot quite cure but essentially make it\nso that people no longer 50 of people no\nlonger have bpd if they're in a stable\nrelationship for two years now does that\nmean that you have to be in a\nrelationship is that the only cure for\nbpd no so you can be in treatment and\nlearn things like there are\nevidence-based treatments like\ndialectical behavioral therapy\nwhat are you looking for\nmy phone i'm bowed down a little bumble\nif i knew that was the cure you would\nhave got tinder so that that's where i i\ngot it it's not just the cures this is\nepidemiologic data so people have done\nstudies and taken people that\nhave bpd\nand then no longer seem to have bpd and\nwhat changed they were in a stable\nrelationship for two years but what we\ndo know that you can do so this is a\nlittle bit tricky whereas i wouldn't say\nthat finding a relationship is\nnecessarily the cure to bpd\nbut what you can do is do\ntreatment like dialectical behavioral\ntherapy\nso that's like it's a kind of therapy\nthat's heavily influenced by mindfulness\nwas is fascinating so there was a\npsychologist named marshall linahan who\nherself had bpd\nand what she was trying to figure out is\nlike what worked for me became a\npsychologist was also very high\nfunctioning very successful and\ndeveloped the best treatment for dp bpd\non the planet which is dialectical\nbehavioral therapy so that's what i\nwould recommend if you you know want to\nget that\ndiet sorry dialectical behavioral\ntherapy and i can even explain to you\nkind of what it is and how it works yeah\nbecause i i i like at the time they sent\nme to a lot of therapy but it was like\nthe exact therapy i was going for my\ndepression where it felt like it didn't\ndo a thing i didn't know there were like\ndifferent types yeah if you could\nexplain instead of me reading it off\nthat'd be handy thank you so i'm gonna\nask you a couple of like\nsomewhat personal questions you don't\nhave to offer a whole lot of detail it's\ngoing to be like more yes or no if you\nwant to add color or explain what your\nexperience is you can but you don't have\nto okay\nso sometimes people with bpd\ntheir\nway of thinking about something becomes\nvery black and white and very rapidly\nand oftentimes completely black\nso is that something that you feel\ncomfortable like can you just give us an\nexample like it doesn't even have to be\nreal but like does that happen to you\nwhere\nit consists of me like it'll be some\nsmall like like i'll be driving in the\ncar i'll get a message that just upsets\nme and i'm like\neverything i'm doing today\nsucks because this is in my head for the\nright like and i'm like what's the point\nof being happy when this one thing has\nupset me or like evening and when people\nare like even when people are just late\nto something i'm like well now we can't\nplan efficiently and like it's ruined\nand it's like everything's just and i\ncan't see the bright side okay perfect\nright can't see the bright side okay so\nit's ruined so when one bad things hap\nhappens it's ruined period\nyeah right you can't see the bright side\ni couldn't set it better myself\nso what marshall in a hand did is she\nstudied buddhism\nand she discovered a very interesting\nprinciple that is rooted in something\ncalled advaith vedanta which is\nnon-dualism okay i know it sounds kind\nof weird\nwe'll catch you up give me a second\nso essentially what she discovered is\nsomething that she translated into\nenglish is the dialectic which is that\ntwo things that are polar opposites\ncan be true at the same time\nand once someone with bpd understands\nthat and can live that they get a lot\nbetter so i'll give you an example\ni can be mad at you\nand still love you\nbut someone with bpd can't hold both of\nthose thoughts that's why it's so\nterrifying either you love me\nor\nyou're mad at me\nand i can't have you ever being mad at\nme because that means\nyou don't love me\nso it's ruined\nmeans uh you're late therefore it's\nruined it's impossible for your late and\nwe can still have we can still have a\ngood time\nsure we're half an hour late but we can\nmake the most of the next three hours\nthat thought is very hard for people\nwith ppd\ni know and it's pissing me off now\nbecause i'm literally thinking like\nsomeone didn't reply to my text for two\ndays because they were busy and i'm like\ni'm done with this person yeah i'm like\ni'm like i'm like they can't even send\nme a message like i am completely done\nthey're cut off and then they message me\nlike i'm so sorry and i'm like oh you're\nfine and it's like why can i change from\nplanning to cut them out forever to\nbeing like you're my best friend i love\nyou yeah and not balance it yeah so so\nhere's the thing here's the tricky thing\nabout what dbt teaches people\nit's not balancing it\nit's not that one goes down and one\ncomes up\nit's that both are true at the same time\nin their intensity\nso over time it will lead to balance but\nit's kind of this idea that like i don't\nknow how else to say it it's just\nreplacing in your mind so when your mind\nreacts to something\nit's never and it's always but\nyes\nright it's either or\nit can never be like two things like\nthis person is mad at me and they love\nme\nlike you can't say that that's annoying\ni'm aware of that i'm saying to you i'm\naware of it so why at the time\nevery time because i've had bbd for\nyears why can't i stop and realize at\nthe time why does it take the next day\nto be like\noh\nactually cutting this person out my life\nand blocking them is not the solution\nit's so aggravating so i know i'm\ntalking about my issue but it keeps\nhappening a good excellent question so\nlet me ask you a couple questions okay\nso what's different you said why can't i\nrealize it until the next day\nright you said that you asked that\nquestion so let me ask you what's\ndifferent between\nthe day it happens and the next day\nmy emotions are strong because i'm\noverthinking and they did something\nexcellent right\nso 100 correct so this is where remember\nhow you were saying that your stress\nlevels i drew the stress graph and\nyou're like no dr k that's wrong it's\nway higher and way lower so people have\ndone studies this is really fascinating\nwhen you have someone who has bpd\nability to their brains ability to\nexperience negative emotion\nis way faster than a neurotypical brain\nso your ability to like for me to go to\nzero to 100 in terms of being pissed\nwill take me like 60 seconds\nfor someone with bpd it'll take like\nfour\ni'm just making those numbers up i don't\nknow what the exact numbers are but the\nability for someone's brain with bpd to\nexperience negative emotion is more\nrapid the other really really\nthing that just causes people to suffer\na lot is the ability for the brain to\ncalm down takes longer so not is it not\nonly is it easier for you to feel\nnegative emotion if you have bpd\nbut\nit takes you longer to kind of like\nreconstitute so it'll take 24 hours\ninstead of like two hours\nthat's so annoying because that means\nlike my brain is actually slower than\nothers it's like why because i know like\ni should be able to because right now\ni'm thinking about stuff that i got mad\nabout where i'm like\nwhy did i get mad about that or like\neven even times like i'm gonna have\nmyself here my older sister upset me\nrecently because she said something to\nmy mom\nand i attacked my mom over it because\ni'm like why didn't you tell me this\nyou're fake and then the next day i was\nlike i love you i'm sorry i don't know\nwhy i did that and it's like\nyeah why do i even go for the kill when\nthat person hasn't upset me\nyeah so that that's where that's what so\nif we talk about the treatment of\ndialectical behavioral therapy that's\nwhy mindfulness is such a big part of it\nso mindfulness is going to be one of the\ncentral techniques\nthat can literally like train your brain\nlike everyone's brain\nto be like emotionally a little bit more\ndetached emotionally kind of calm down\nall right you you look like you're\ngetting emotional a little bit now\nis it happening\njust slightly are you frustrated are you\nfrustrated with yourself it's annoying\nbecause i'm talking about here but\nwhy can't my brain understand it when\nit's happening okay hold on a second\nso\nminx\nare you being black and white in the way\nthat you judge yourself in this moment\nmaybe\nsay more what are you thinking about\nyourself\nbecause i can see oh like a lot of\nrelationships i've ruined with it and\ntalking about it it's just like\ndifferent and easier to understand but\nthen at the time it's like\nhow is my brain so [ __ ] dumb and slow\nthat i can't process and realize how\nnormal the situation is instead of\nblowing up and ruining everything yeah\nso that in and of itself so makes it's\ngonna sound kind of weird but i want you\nto take a step back from that conclusion\nbecause that conclusion is black and\nwhite that you're [ __ ] dumb and slow\nbecause you're neither dumb nor are you\nslow what you have to understand about\nthis is what i've come to understand\nabout bpd is the reason your brain is\nlike that is because it's like that to\nprotect you\nbecause there was probably a time in\nyour life that if it did not think like\nthat you would have been screwed\nso bpd is like your guard dog\nand now what's happened is that\nyou know people have been trying to\nbreak into your house for so long that\nany stranger that comes over it starts\nbarking\nso you're not busted you're not broken\nyou're an amazing person this is just\nwhat happens this is your karma\nit's your karma that you grew up in a\nparticular circumstance\nwhere you have these particular ways\nthat you're wired that let's remember\nmakes you more successful at streaming\nhas allowed you to come to la\nhas allowed you to fit in\nto\nthe stream or culture and\ncauses you to suffer\nright that both of these things can be\ntrue\nthat this can\ni wouldn't quite call it a gift but\nlet's call it that it can some things it\ncan do good for you and some things it\ncan't\nnow i'm having trouble reading what's\ngoing on in your brain are you\nno discarding everything that i'm saying\nno i i'm i'm listening and it does make\nme like it\nit i i do like agree with saying like i\nthat's why i say i try to call it gift\nbecause like half of my\nviral clips that happen is when i feel\nlike a trigger go in my brain and i'm\nlike instead of\nending and being upset act into that\nemotion and make it a character and it's\nlike but it's also\nlike turmoil when you're alone and it's\nlike 100 percent and it make it feels\nlike i'm [ __ ] mimicking my own issue\nand\n100 like you know you dissociate you\ncan't tell what's real and what's fake\nyeah so i i think it's this is the real\nchallenge of people that i've worked\nwith who have bpd is that it is so\nresponsible for their success\nand\ncauses them to suffer immensely\nright like\nsure\nyou're successful\nbut boy have you paid a price for it\nexactly and exactly like you said with\nall the like\ndarkness like i i i call my mom all the\ntime like every day and i tell her like\nhow sad i am and then she'll be like but\nlook how much like you've done and how\nmuch you've grown you're in la you're\ndoing dreams and it just makes the thing\nbecause it's either black or white and\nit's just so annoying because\nthis is the first time i can properly\ntalk about it and it's like\ni can walk to advantage but it sucks so\n[ __ ] bad when you're 100\nyeah i don't want to like i don't want\nto be with people because if it acts up\ni just hurt them\nyeah\nthat sounds\nlike an impossible situation that you\ncan't win\nbecause on the one hand you don't want\nto be on alone but on the other hand you\ndon't want to ruin your relationships if\nit gets out of control you feel like\nyou're not in control\nso almost to protect them you have to be\nalone and then you're signing yourself\nup for being alone and suffering\neven even small things like if i like\nhave a plan and i'm like because i sleep\nearly especially with my boxing like\ni had a plan for a friend to come over\nand they were like an hour and a half\nlate and i ruined the whole night\nbecause i'm like we waste that hour and\na half and now i have to sleep in an\nhour when we could have two and a half\nhours and they didn't get why i was\nupset and i'm like why can't i just tell\nyou the reason\ninstead of being mad and sulky and it's\nannoying because i can talk about now\nbut i can't talk about at the time\nso this is so i would you know if this\nis\nthis is what i feel confident about minx\nis that\ndbt\ngenerally speaking helps people a lot\nwho are who struggle with the things\nthat you struggle with\nand what it literally will do is like so\nthis is why the mindfulness component is\nsuch a big piece of it so there's a lot\ngoing on here\nso would it help you for me to talk\nthrough\n[Music]\nwhat i think it could help you with\nyeah\ncan i think for a second and compose my\nthoughts\nyeah i know i may have to whip out the\nipad again okay\nyou know what actually when i cry it\nbrings color to my face and i'm kind of\nfeeling cute right now\nusually i'm like a walking corpse we got\na little blush going on natural blush\ntoo\nthere's there's the humor there's the\nadhd there's the leaning into it there's\nthe entertainer\nright\nlook at you looking at the dialectic now\nbring some color in hey\nyeah\nman\nyeah i'm like making my cheekbones pop\ntoo i'm starting to feel like a little\nmodel\nlook at you rocking it\num\nsorry you just threw me off which i'm\nnot upset about i really appreciate but\ni was just thinking a little bit about\nokay\nlet me just think for a second okay\nyes take your time\ni'll sing a little song with chat come\nby and\nlord\ncome by yeah\n[Music]\ni'm not singing christian tunes i don't\nknow why we're back into that\nuh i'm christian anymore i'm agnostic\nso\nlet's think through\nso let me just understand this okay so\nit seems like you're very frustrated\nwith yourself\nfor losing control\nyes\num you're also\nnot frustrated but i get the sense of\nalmost like you feel kind of powerless\nthat it's like either or\nlike yeah either you're on and you're\nstreaming and successful and fun and\nhappy and\nor you're alone which we haven't really\ntalked too much about i don't know that\nwe really need to but and then in in the\nloneliness there's suffering there's\nyou know\nkinds of stuff\nthen there's\nalso\nokay so let's like think through this\nfrom a very\nbasic level\nso the first thing to understand is that\nwe're talking about treatment so here's\nthe way that i would think about\ntreatment for someone like you this is\nbasically how i think about\neveryone with bpd\nso the first is learning particular\nskills that literally like work on your\nbrain\nand correct that emotional when i say\nsensitivity i don't mean like oh you're\nsensitive like i mean like literally\nlike your neurons are like twitchy and\ntheir ability to get feel anger or upset\nor things like that is like very very\nquick\nokay\nso you can learn certain grounding\ntechniques i'ma teach you one today\nokay\nthat will hopefully\nif you practice it because it takes\npractice\nit'll help you if we if we think about\ntoday versus tomorrow what's different\nthat your emotions have calmed down\nit'll help you calm your emotions and\nthen if you calm your emotions it'll be\neasier to realize so this meditation\ntechnique won't help you realize it\nwon't make you realize anything all\nit'll hopefully do is counteract that\nrapidity which your brain gets upset\nwith and also the length at which your\nbrain stays upset\nokay\nyeah so we got to help you in the moment\nokay\nsecond thing so we're going to start\nwith like meditation at the top second\nthing\nthere are going to be\nthings that you are frustrated with\nyourself\nyou're going to be frustrated with\nyourself because you have bpd there are\nthe things that you bla why can't i dot\ndot dot dot dot\nthat\nmakes you lose confidence in yourself\nright because you think you're busted on\nthe inside\nif you lose confidence with yourself you\nbecome more vulnerable to the opinions\nof others\nand then the love and affection of other\npeople becomes more important to you\nbecause you don't believe it in here\nthat combined with the brain's itchiness\ncreates like a bad scenario you see that\nlike if i can't love myself\ni need other people to love me if they\ndon't answer my text message because\nthey're the they're going to be the ones\nthey're the ones that love me then like\nit triggers the whole thing\nso the other thing that you need to do\nis like forgive yourself for being who\nyou are\nbecause this is all a part of your\njourney minx i believe that 100\neven if you think about if you never had\nbpd we wouldn't be talking about this we\nwouldn't be streaming\nonline right now\na thousand people 10 000 people 20 000\npeople 50 000 people would not watch\nthis\nand there are thousands of people just\nlike you out there who may not even\nrealize what they've got sure it took\nyou nine months to get diagnosed you got\ndiagnosis think about all the people out\nthere that have no idea they're just\nthey understand this they live it every\nsingle day but they have no [ __ ] clue\nand so there is a karma to the work that\nwe're doing here there's like an\nimportant that's actually something i\nalways remind myself like because i know\nbpd is hard to diagnose and it can be\nmisdiagnosed so many times where i'm\ngrateful that i know what the root of\nthe issue is and that there is ways to\nwork on it\nlike like you said the therapy which i'm\ndefinitely gonna look into that\nyeah so so that so the second thing is\nyou got to learn how to forgive yourself\nfor having bpd in the first place\nnext thing to do is understand the\norigins of it\nso understand because remember this is\nyour brain's way of protecting you it's\nthe way that your brain like it's not\nit's not busted that's what's so tricky\nabout a personality disorder versus like\nsomething like depression if there's a\nneurochemical imbalance we can give you\na pill to correct that neurochemical\nimbalance it's actually a malfunction of\nthe brain\nwhereas narcissistic personality\ndisorder\nborderline personality disorder these\nare not malfunctions of the brain\nthey're adaptations of the brain that\nnow start to cause you problems so you\nhave to understand where that came from\nyou have to understand why your brain\nevolved to be this way and the truth is\nit's not your fault you're not like\nfundamentally busted it learned\nsomewhere along the way that we need\nthese techniques\nit's like i don't know you know what\ngames you play or if you play games but\ni almost think about personality\ndisorders as like blood magic you know\nwhat blood magic has have you played any\ngames with blood magic\ni've not played games with blood magic\nactually so like this this is this idea\nwhere you've got like mana right and you\nuse mana to cast spells but then there's\nblood magic where you use your life\nessence to cast spells\nand so everything that every step\nforward\ncomes at a cost to you and i almost\nthink about personality disorders is\nlike the blood magic of psychiatry i'm a\n[ __ ] wizard is what you're saying you\nare a wizard\nright but you pay the price for it\neach time\nyou cast a spell each time you work your\nmagic it comes with a [ __ ] price\nbut now that makes bpd so much cooler\nnow i'm like well you know yeah when you\nsee that you put it into that little\nperspective and i'm like\ni'm pretty cool my bpd you're right yeah\ni mean\nlike i think that's the thing about\nblood magic is that sounds cool when you\nplay it in a video game sucks to\nactually be the wizard who's like losing\na piece of their life force\nright that's true but i think it is\nuseful to understand the origins of why\nyou are the way that you are\nand then\nultimately i think it comes back to\nmeditation so once you do all that stuff\nand you also develop like coping skills\nand things like that once you come back\nto it i think that there's almost like a\nspirituality to it that at the end of\nthe day when i work with people who are\nlike really\ni can't say the word cured because who\nknows how they're doing now but people\nwho get so much better to where they no\nlonger if they went to a psychiatrist\nand they put them through the diagnostic\nprocess of bpd they would not qualify\nthat's what we can say confidently\nis that there is like\nalmost like a spirituality to it and\nthis is what i think marshall linehan\nkind of stumbled upon is that the world\nis fundamentally not black or white\nlike if you think about you said that\nyou know the potatoes or\nmy lettuce is bitter\nor you know the sweet potatoes are sweet\nwhy are you coming back to play it was\ndoc i said nothing about your potatoes\ni'm just i talk [ __ ] about your life no\nno i'm not very stereotypical over here\naren't we miss murder no no no no no no\nno let me finish please makes\nso like at the end of the day not all\nsweet potatoes are going to be sweet\nright some of them are going to be\nsweeter than others and that's just life\nthat at the end of the day like even\nbeyond dbt and dialectics and being able\nto hold two opposites to be true that's\njust what life is that life is ups and\nlife is downs\nand even then if you really go far into\nspirituality you can start to do things\nlike develop a detachment where you can\nacknowledge that\ndid i want this thing yes did i want my\nfriend to show up on time and could we\nhave had two and a half hours of fun yes\nbut they showed up an hour late and so\nthe most i can get is an hour and a half\nof fun\nand now i sort of have not really the\nchoice because we can't really control\nit we make it sound like a choice it's\nreally not\nyou know it with practice and with\ndedication and with effort i can still\nenjoy the next 90 minutes\nand this is something that i've seen a\nlot with like you know people like that\nsounds kind of weird but some of the\nmost inspiring moments in medicine for\nme have been people who have been\ndiagnosed with cancer so it's like they\nhave a limited time on this earth left\nand like\nyou know some of them really learn to\nmake the most of it and like the last\nyear or two years of their life like is\nthere suffering and awfulness absolutely\nbut there's also like beauty and that\nlike that's what life is and they serve\nas an inspiration to people around them\nand then i also hear really bizarre\nthings which i still have trouble\naccepting which is like cancer is the\nbest thing that ever happened to me\npeople will actually say that right\nusually these are people that are in\nremission\nbecause you know but that like cancer\nhelps them realize what life is and like\nstuff like that\ni mean people will say things like that\nit sounds crazy\nit is it is but it does it does make\nsense and going back to\nyou said something there where it was\nlike the last 90 minutes is what matters\nand it's like that's another thing that\naffects the because you said you know a\nnew day's new emotions and that's true i\nrestart but then you know the guilt that\ncomes with it because i'm like i'll\nthink exactly what you said now with\nthat nine minutes i have it in my head\nthe next day i'm like\nwhy did you have to\nbe like that and be so moody when you\ncould have enjoyed the time that you had\nwith them and then i feel worse the next\nday because\ni just have a guilt building up in me\nand it's like damn you were so angry\nthen when you could have you didn't even\nhave to be angry just neutral\nyou didn't have to\nso makes that's the tricky thing so that\nis the same thing though because that's\nthe black and white because the next day\ninstead of enjoying today you're ruining\ntoday by thinking about yesterday\nand so the cycle perpetuates\nso that's where you really have to learn\nhow to forgive yourself\nbecause if you can learn how to forgive\nyourself you can also learn how to\nforgive your friend for the 60 minutes\nthey're late and enjoy the 90 minutes\nit actually starts with the next day not\nnot the 90 minutes it starts with hey\nthis is the way that i am whether you\nbelieve in god or karma or entropy or\nchance or whatever this is the way that\nthe universe has made me right i am a\ni'm a\ni'm the\nthis is the fruit that has been born\nfrom the tree of my life and this is\nwhat it is\nit may not be the sweetest fruit but\nthat's okay\nright so it starts by like forgiving\nyourself like really and like the four\ncomponents are like learning how to\nmanage your emotions in the moment\nlearning how to forgive yourself for not\nmanaging the emotions in the moment\nlearning the origins of why your brain\ndeveloped to be this way and ultimately\nlike almost take a spiritual perspective\nand recognize that this is all what's\nsupposed to happen\nand that despite all of the suffering\nthat you have you can grow from it you\ncan learn from it you can appreciate\nlife so much more\nthrough these experiences you can help\nthe world and make them a better place\nand your community absolutely loves you\nand that's where like because like sure\nyou're\nhere\nwith blood magic and you're suffering\nbut you've enriched so many people\naround you\nso you suffer and you make the world a\nbetter place you have fun and you suffer\nand you are i'm sure frustrating to deal\nwith by some of your friends at times\nand an absolute joy to have in their\nlives\ngod\ni [ __ ] hope so i get these [ __ ]\nfood all the time they better i better\nbe a [ __ ] joy in their life yeah\nand that's where you may be getting them\nfood but bribery only works so far\nand at some point\n[Music]\ndid you give that to boa bribery always\nworks okay we will not get you very far\nbribery will always work okay\n[ __ ] love some bribery some bribery\non it\nwednesday evening is it wednesday\nyeah there we go knowing the dates look\nat me\nhow you holding up minx\ngood\nreally good actually this was\nnot how i expected to go i was expecting\nmore to be like\nfunny the whole time but it's actually\nbeen really helpful\nyeah\ni i'm\nnoticing that maybe if we pause for a\nsecond you're feeling\nconflicting things now\nuh i'm feeling like you might be correct\nactually\nright so that's good right so this is\nwhere like this is just what you have to\nlearn and the cool thing is like right\nnow you're feeling those emotions i\nactually see you doing it right now i\nsee you feeling the emotions and feeling\nthem intensely but also not losing\ncontrol of them\nand it's it's what you're doing right\nnow is hard it's to be commended\nthank you\nthank you could you get a\nfour seven in chat please if we\ncommending it i'd like uh wait that's\nnot they won't what that i don't know i\njust did what you did i didn't know what\nyou're doing it almost happened i made\n007.\nthere they go what does that mean\nthey're commending me for my bravery and\ndealing with my emotions do you not have\na\ndude are you just seeing oh seven are\nyou not seeing the emote yeah i'm just\nsaying go seven okay so they're it's a\nsalute they're doing a salute\nokay well i i salute you i suppose i\njust feel weird saluting people because\ni don't know how to do it properly\ni think you did it fantastically thank\nyou\nokay beautiful psy you want to learn a\nlittle meditation technique\nman i've tried meditation so many times\nand i'm like oh that wa\nyeah make me better already i'll sit\nthere cross-legged and i'm like why am i\nnot feeling better i'm with you yeah\nthose those meditation techniques suck\ncan i try to teach you something else\nyes okay\nso\nhmm\ni felt confident in what i was going to\nteach you but i wonder okay now we're\njust going to do this\nall right so i'm going to teach you\nso i'm going to share with you\na phrase in english\nokay\nso have you heard the phrase this too\nshall pass\nyes my mother says this to me every day\ni call her\nand does that upset you\nno it's just comforting at this point i\nused to upset me as a kid i'm like okay\nstop but now hearing it from a distance\ni'm like you're right this too shall\npass so i can't tell if that means that\nthis is the right thing to teach you or\nthe wrong thing to teach you but let's\nstick with it for now okay so\nand so what i'm going to teach you is a\nreally simple technique so if you look\nat the the sections of your fingers okay\nso like you see these like you've got\nthree on each finger\nso i want you to start with this one the\nmiddle one of your ring finger\nokay put your and then what i want you\nto do is we're gonna go up\nto the tip\nout to the side\nto the pinky\ndown to the middle\ngood and then down to the bottom\ngood and then across this way\ngood and then across this way\nand then across this way\nand we're gonna go up\nwe're gonna go up\nwe're going to go across\ndown\nand then back to where we started\nmiddle of the ring finger so you see\nwe're making a loop so we're kind of\ngoing\nlike that\nand we're making like kind of a loop you\nsee that\nyes so there's 12\nthere are 12 of these so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n9 10 11 12. and then back to the center\nso what i want you to do the next time\nyou're feeling upset we're going to\npractice now the next time you can't let\nsomething go\nokay\nwhat i want you to do is do 12 rounds\nclose your eyes\ntake a deep breath and do 12 rounds of\nthis too shall pass\nand do one breath with each one\nand what i really want you to focus on\nis the sensation across your fingers\nof just touching\ntouching\nand then like so does that sort of make\nsense we're gonna do like you can take a\ndeep breath in you're gonna say this too\nshall pass and then you're gonna move on\nto the next one\nno i actually like this way i never even\nthought i like\ndamn i actually like this way because i\nfeel like like when i get anxious i like\nwill scratch my palm a lot or something\nbut this is more like a chill way and it\nalso makes me feel like i'm in tokyo\nghoul\nso\nbecky\nso let's let's do it together okay so\nokay\ndo you did you did you get the sequence\ni know it's kind of confusing\nso we're going to start\nmiddle oh okay yep and then show me\nwhat's next\nso yeah so we go down and then out\noh down and out i thought it was up and\nout okay down down right then out to the\npinky and then up the pinky\ngood and then this way\nand then this way\nright and then this way\nand then down\ntwo good and then three\nlike and then back to the center\nright\ngood\nuh yeah don't skip the pinky the middle\npinky i skipped it that was confusing\nbecause okay i'm kind of adhd too\nokay so there should be so just touch\neach of them 12 times\ni mean sorry they touched each other\nonce and that'll be 12 rounds good very\ngood so then the middle good down\nback towards the middle finger good\nand then and then cross over perfect\nokay so we're really going to focus on\nthat tactile stimulation\nso you can take if you this is the other\nthing the more upset you are you don't\nhave to do one breath with each one if\nyou're upset you can do it super fast\nthis two shall pass this two shall pass\nthis two shall pass this two shall pass\nthis to pass this two shall pass this\ntwo shall pass this too shall pass this\ntoo shall pass this should show this\n[ __ ] fast\nokay and then slow it down okay\nthis too shall pass\nway i like this this is very comforting\nmaybe it's because my mom always says it\nreminds me of home but it's also like\nfixing my nail digging thing it's like a\nmix of both i've never heard of this\ntwo shall pass\ntwo shall pass this two shall pass this\ntwo shall pass this two shall pass\nthis two shall pass this two shall pass\nthis two shall pass\ngood\nokay\nnow you can work your way up to doing it\nnine times you can do this when you're\nupset but ideally you want to do 9\nrounds or 108\nbreaths or 108 this too shall pass\nokay\nso you can even keep track if you want\nto get things super complicated you may\nlose this because of adhd but you can\neven keep track on this hand so as i do\n12 over here i move down here\noh no no shot i'm gonna count and be\nable to do that okay don't worry about\nit\nyou know i got a small frontal lobe i\ngot epilepsy\nwell\nthat's true did you know that people\nalways think i'm joking when i say it\npeople with epilepsy have a small\na smaller frontal lobe that like hinders\ntheir decisions\nyeah people with adhd have that too so\noh great so you're saying i'm a double\nsmall brain huh\nno i think that's probably me i guess\ndo you mind if i ask how old you are\ni'm 25. okay so your frontal lobe will\ncontinue to grow until you're 30 or 32.\nso\nthings could get better for you\neven just on their own\nlet's have our fingers crossed because\nshe better be grown man i'm missing a\nbig part of my brain right now\ndo you have any questions about the\nmeditation technique do you understand\nit\nno i actually do understand i like it i\nthought you were going to make me like\ncrisp cross my legs and like close my\neyes at home in silence for like 30\nminutes no silence is terrible so when\nyou're way better\nso here's the thing for you mix you need\nactivity and grounding\nfor meditation\nwhat you're you don't silence is just\ngoing to be filled with your negative\nthoughts like if you try to like sit and\nmeditate when you're struggling like you\nneed you have so much energy in the mind\nright like that's what makes you so damn\nsuccessful is you've got like so much\nenergy\nand so what you need to do is direct\nthat energy because when you get upset\nwith yourself it's just bouncing around\nin your head and creating thought after\nthought after thought after thought and\nit ramps up and ramps up and ramps up\nand ramps up this sushapot boom boom\nboom boom as fast as you can go like a\nmachine gun and then slow down\nyou know what you said bouncing and\nthat's actually how i explain it when\ni'm angry you know the windows logo when\nit hits the corners oh yeah it feels\nlike that's what's like in my head\nticking it's like boom\nand every time it hits it takes me\nlike it makes me angrier and angrier and\nangrier\nover a small situation\ni don't know if i agree with small\nright because the whole point is that\nit's not small to you\nit's it's it's black and white and i\njust see it\nit's big to me but it'll be a small so\nif you stop seeing it as small\nbecause that's the that's the black and\nwhite you see that\nbecause if you view it as a small\nsituation\nthat means that it's insignificant and\nyou're so stupid for getting caught up\nin it that's the\nno it's important you were really\nlooking forward to this and your friend\nwas an hour late\nand it's okay to be upset by that right\na very smart person\nhuh very understanding huh you you very\nunderstanding guy\nman saying my thoughts before i can even\nthink them out here\ni\nyeah i mean i i think\ncut yourself a little slack\nthanks seriously\nyou deserve it\nthanks\nthank you\nand now i've gone and messed it all up\nagain\nthis too shall i see i'm not even mad\nnow this is just a comforting cry it's\nmore like a comforting one good well\nany\nthoughts are i mean i feel like this is\na good place to stop for today in\ngeneral like i think we've covered a lot\nand yeah you know i i don't want to\nforget\nwhat we learned in the first half do you\nwant to do you have any thoughts or\nquestions um i don't i don't really have\nany questions i just feel more like a\nthis was a dice it's because it's you\nknow like you you have therapy alone\nprivate thing where it's nice to be able\nto talk about it and like the safe\nenvironment try to be very sweet\nwhere i was just like not expecting to\nopen up so much but yeah you'd be very\nnice too so i thought we were going to\ndo adhd lecturing\n[ __ ] but there's adhd we screwed from\n[ __ ] lettuce to [ __ ] grasp you\n[ __ ] you can't you can't blame me for\nthis\nno it was like growing up\nand asking about your lettuce you're\nbitterless by the way and also there was\na point where you spoke about like you\ndid an analogy and you were like not all\nsweet potatoes are sweet and you were\nreally into it but i wanted to roast you\nand i'm like man that's just your\n[ __ ] sweet potatoes you literally\nlike said earlier sometimes you're not\nsweet i'm like\ni think this is an analogy like hitting\nclose home i've never had a sweet potato\nthat was not sweet okay that's just you\nand your strange ass garden okay yeah\nmaybe with my bitter lettuce and unsweet\nsweet potatoes i don't really know what\ni'm growing here\nroast away you know that only makes it\nsweeter\n[Laughter]\nokay well\nminx i wish you all the best good luck\num you know thank you one very concrete\nrecommendation i would recommend you\nkind of look into dbt a little bit more\nthey're also groups which can be really\nreally good that they'll teach you like\nthe skills and stuff\nyeah\nso you can just like kind of look in\nyour area if you're\nuh and you know if you have any\nquestions or anything like that just dm\nme\nokay perfect\nthank you for having me on i appreciate\nit thank you very much take care thanks\nfor having me bye bye\nokay so\nthat was that\nthat changed rapidly\nbut we talked about a lot of important\nstuff\num\nyeah\nyou know it's interesting because i\nthink mental health is like\nwe kind of think about it so\nuh\nin isolation\nright we think about adhd or we think\nabout bpd or we think about adderall or\nnot adderall or like you know medication\nor not medication whereas like the truth\nis like it's so much more integrated\nthan that and the people who tend to do\nwell i think are the ones that are\nreally able to take\nan integrated non-isolating approach\nwhich is part of what i dislike about\nthe way that this profession is going\nso like one thing that we see a lot in\nthe united states which which is not i\nmean it's good for a lot of reasons but\nhas like some serious cost to it is the\nseparation of medication from\npsychotherapy so a lot of times people\nwill have a psychiatrist who prescribes\nmedications and someone else who does\ntherapy which sort of makes sense i mean\nthere's a lot of good reasons that we do\nthat\nbecause there's a shortage of\nprescribers for example so like you know\nyou can just treat more people as a\nsociety if you have someone kind of\nprescribing and someone else doing\ntherapy\nso there's like some like you know\npublic health\naccess to healthcare kind of issues\nthere that sort of makes sense for that\nalso you don't sometimes the medication\nis pretty simple and it's not\nnecessarily that integrated but\ni think you know one of the things that\ni've come to really appreciate is that\ntaking care of your mental health and\nlike being happy or healthy\nis not just medications it's not just\ntherapy it's like the whole shebang\nright it's like learning skills to calm\ndown your emotional mind and i don't say\nthat as an indictment i mean when your\nmind is ramped up your brain is ramped\nup and it's triggered in a particular\nway and your neurons are just you know\nyou get that kind of like thoughts\nbouncing around in your head you need\nsome something to\ndecompress that in the moment but that's\nnot enough\nright then you also have to understand\nokay how did my brain get to here how\ndid my mind get to here why do i\nperceive the world in this way and\nthat's what i really like about some of\nthese\nyou know deeper kinds this deeper sort\nof work is you start to recognize where\nyour patterns come from and once you\nrecognize where your patterns come from\nthen the cool thing is that that\nforgiveness becomes so much easier\nbecause the whole thing is like we just\nthink that we're idiots and we're busted\nright like oh my god like why am i so\nstupid\nno it's like you became that way because\nit actually served a very important\nfunction for you and then what we also\nhave to do is think a little bit about\nthe consequences of things like bpd and\nadhd\nso this is part of the reason why i\nthink people with adhd\ngrow up to have depression is because\nthey like don't know how to properly\nmourn their like negative experiences\nright because when you when you're a kid\nlike this is what's so hard is that\nbeing adhd\nmakes you fail at being normal\nso you're smart and you know you're\nsmart but you can't do what other kids\ncan do\nand so like that\nconsequence or that conclusion that like\ni just can't be normal like there's\nsomething wrong with me that seed is\nwhat really grows into depression\nand so this is where there's not just\nthe the the adhd itself right there's\nnot just like the attention problems and\nthings like that there's also like the\nconsequences of having lived with it\nwhich require another like layer of work\nbut the good news is that you know some\npeople may think oh my god this is so\noverwhelming like how am i supposed to\ndo all this stuff and the but the good\nnews is that\nif you're kind of feeling like you're\nstuck in life and you haven't done any\nof these things and you feel like okay\ni'm operating at like 40\nof my potential\nthe good news is that the more things\nthat you haven't done like you can get\n20 from meditation 20 from\nself-forgiveness and 20 from like you\nknow learning like organizational skills\nfor adhd and you can get to 100\nthat's the real thing that i've seen as\na provider like as a treater as a\npsychiatrist\nis that there's a like people you will\nbe amazed at what people are capable of\nyou'll be amazed at what you're capable\nof and like actually getting there\nbecause the truth of the matter is that\nmost of us haven't done most of this\nstuff and there's a lot to be done\nand you just gotta get started and then\nit'll like happen like i give it like\nthree to six months for each of those\nthings and then a year to 18 months from\nnow you will be in a completely\ndifferent place\nyou"
