    "transcript": "a society has told us you can't\nnot do this it makes you a bad person if\nyou don't work on your relationships\nlike what kind of human being are you\noh my god like if you eat processed food\nwhat kind of human being are you you\nknow i want to get married at this age\ni'm gonna have my first kid at this age\ni'm gonna get second get at this age i\nmake this much money i'm gonna retire we\nhave like this timeline right and we\nthink that life is a race recognize that\nit's okay if your life is a dumpster\nfire it's not actually a dumpster fire\nunless it's a dumpster fire focus on\nlike two or three things at a time and\nit's okay to not be perfect you don't\nhave to be like life is not actually a\nrace\nyou don't have to be ahead of the pack i\ndon't even know where the pack is\n[Music]\nso\none of the challenges in life\nis that you're working your job while\nworking on your mental health while\nworking on your relationships while\nworking on physical health while working\non your family while working on your\nsleep habits while working on self-care\nwhile working on exercise while working\non personal goals while working\nright so like i think one of the things\nthat's happened is we've started to\nrealize that\na lot of this stuff is work that you\nneed to spend some time\non right like you have to devote time to\nit so i get the sense that in my parents\ngeneration you know no fault of theirs\nbut\npeople weren't quite as cognizant like\nabout mental health and the fact that\nmental health needs to be like taken\ncare of\nright so uh you know the concept of\nseeing a therapist when my dad was my\nage was like pretty foreign\nespecially in india or even like 20\nyears when he was like\n20 years old it was like completely\nforeign like they didn't exist in india\nor very few of them did\nand then the other thing is like when it\ncomes to family and relationships and\nstuff that too was sort of like\nthey just kind of worked themselves out\nright so like when\nin 20 years ago 50 years ago 60 years\nago just to like share a story with\ny'all\nso when i talk to my grandmother now\nabout like relationship stuff\nshe like shushes me so she'll be like oh\nlike you know like there are problems in\nevery marriage there are problems you\nknow these things happen like\ndon't dwell on them just you know\neverything will be fine\nand there's kind of like this sweep it\nunder the rug mentality and i realized\nthat like a lot of that sweep it under\nthe rug mentality comes from\na social situation in which change is\nnot viable so like talking about it or\ncomplaining about it or things like that\nwere not like really useful\ninterventions\nso my grandmother grew up in a time\nwhere\ndivorce was like unheard of\nand economic options were very few and\nfar between right so you like get\nmarried you have a joint family unit the\njoint family unit which means that you\nlive with your parents and potentially\nlike siblings or in-laws or whatever and\nso you'll have like 10 12 14 people\nliving in a single household\nand the reason for that is because\npeople were like farmers and you like\nneeded to have shared labor and shared\nresources and stuff like that you had\nyour own internal small economy she grew\nup in a in a village that had like 150\npeople\nand you know going to the next village\nover which was like a three or four hour\nwalk\nwas like a big deal\nso it was like an event right it's kind\nof like for us flying internationally\npeople would like go you know once in\nthe first 20 years of their life they're\nlike oh yeah i went to like that other\nvillage\nand oftentimes it'll be for some kind of\noccasion like you know getting married\nor something like that\nthere just wasn't a whole lot of like\nviability for changes divorce economic\nfreedom independence so like talking\nabout family stuff wasn't a d it wasn't\na thing like there was no point in\ntalking about it because you you're\ndealt the hand that you're dealt the\npower dynamics are also very very like\nor strong right so like they're\nhierarchical so like if the head of the\nhousehold doesn't like what you're doing\nyou don't have any kind of recourse\nthere's no\noption b you're gonna have to live there\nand they don't have to listen to you\nso that's sort of like i think what's\nhappened is that attitude which may have\nbeen quite severe in india like back in\nlike\n1930 1940\nplaces like that i don't know exactly\nwhat things were like in the u.s and not\neveryone in india lived in that sort of\nsituation\nright so there's heterogeneity there for\nsure\nbut i think the the big thing is that\nthere wasn't a cognizance that this kind\nof stuff you work on like physical\nhealth maybe people were aware of you\ngot to kind of take care of your\nphysical health don't eat a bunch of\nsweets\nyou know like exercise here and there\nand then work too was something that was\nsort of like handed to you back in the\nday\nand now i think what's happening is\nwe're gaining an awareness as our\nsociety changes as we have upward\nmobility as we have lateral mobility as\nwe have the options to choose our\nrelationships to a certain degree choose\nyour work and also as the stresses of\nthis current society bear down on us\nthings like sleep and family and mental\nhealth are like more under attack\nright so when i was like a farmer a\nhundred years ago\nlike\ni wake up when it's time to wake up and\ni go to bed when it's time to wake up\nthere's nothing to do\nthere's like literally like there's no\nelectricity\nso like once the sun goes down like\nunless other people are willing to\nsocialize there's like nothing to do i\ncan't stay up till 4am doing nothing\nthere's like literally nothing to do\nand so now what we have is we have like\nentertainment in our fingertips right\nyou can stay up all night long if you\nwant to like there's plenty to do\nyou can text people you can browse\nreddit you can\nyou know troll people on twitter like\ntrolling people on twitter is a 24 7\nkind of activity\nand so like now we've realized like oh\ncrap this stuff needs work\nbut when do you have time to do it\nright\nbecause work needs work too\nand work is no longer like show up at\nnine and leave at five like clock in and\nclock out right everyone wants you to\ndistinguish yourself you gotta be a\nleader\nyou gotta get promoted gotta get a raise\nyou can't be content at work you gotta\nhustle\nright you gotta have your hustle at work\nyou gotta have your side hustle\nthere's hustle and side hustle right\nand so we gotta have hustle gotta have\nside hustle\ngotta make your boss happy\nboss now has to make you happy which\nwe'll see\nright it's just so much stuff to do like\nwhen are you supposed to have time to do\nthis like the by the way there's no\nentertainment here\nyou got to work on your relationships\ngot to work on your family\nset boundaries with them talk to them\nmanage their emotions it's a pandemic\ngotta move in with them\nyour sibling is like doesn't respect\nyour boundaries\nthey're expecting free child care from\nyou\nbecause they decided to have children\nwhen you have decided not to have\nchildren because you're still focused on\nyour career\nbut they got pregnant and they're six\nyears younger than you are and now\nthey're losing their weekends\nand they're like i don't understand like\ni need a break and it's like you should\nhave thought about that before you have\nkids\nand then what they do is they start\nmessaging your parents then your parents\nstart messaging you and then like\nright\nso now you got to work on that\nand your sleep is screwed up\nand you're drinking too much coffee\nand mom is a q anon sure\nright so oh my god like don't get me\nstarted on\nman i have seen vax and anti-vax\nphilosophies like tear apart families\nduring the pandemic\nit's wild like\nlike you need to get vaccinated because\ngrandpa's got heart failure and is on\noxygen already and can't afford to get\nsick because he's on\nprednisone\nand it's like\ni'm not going to get vaccinated because\ni'm not a sheeple\nand then like tears families apart\nright and then like people say oh yeah\ni'm vaccinated and they show up at\nchristmas they're not vaccinated they're\nasymptomatic carriers of kovid\ngrandpa gets sick\nof kovid dies\nand then oh\nit's bad\nright i mean it's just so there's just\nso much to handle right now and like i\ndon't know how people are supposed to\nget a break like i don't know\nit's just overwhelming there's just so\nmuch stuff you need to do\ni mean i think that this is where like i\ndon't have wild wisdom that is gonna\nmake this easy i think this is the\nsociety that we live in where we're\nyou know we're being assaulted on\nseveral different sides like we're\nmanaging so many things i think part of\nthe upside though to this that's kind of\nweird is that we're at least aware that\nthese are things that you can work on\nright so like people have resources at\ntheir disposal for like the first time\nin human history\nabout how to deal with a parent who has\nborderline personality disorder how to\ndeal with a child who's narcissistic how\nto support a child who has an addiction\nlike\nall these kinds of things we have\nresources for we have tools\nfor sleep habits right\nwe've got melatonin which you can get\nover the counter and we've got\nyou know apps that you can download that\nwill help you train your sleep schedule\nand we also have things like sleep\nstudies and therapists and cbt for\ninsomnia and all this kind of stuff\nwe also have all these people who will\nyou know tell you how to be successful\nat your work on youtube\nright and it's great because we have all\nthese resources\nand so surely what that means is\neveryone is getting promoted right\nbecause i watch these five videos about\nhow to get promoted how to make a\nmillion dollars how i made my first\nmillion in two years\nand so everyone's walking around with a\nmillion bucks because look at all these\npeople out there telling us how to do it\nand it's so easy\nand so sometimes what happens is we're\nkind of like we do this sort of stuff\nand then we're kind of confused when\nlike i'm watching all these youtube\nvideos and it's not working\nright and then we wind up like this\nbecause the subtle thing here is that\nthese are all things that i need to work\non\nbecause i have to work on your job and i\nhave to work on my mental and i have to\nwork on my physical i have to work on my\nrelationships i have to do my family i\nhave to do this i have to self-care\nexercise sleep habits\nhustle side hustle try hustle\nright\nbecause that's what successful people do\nif you want to have a successful\nmarriage you got to work at it man\nif you want to have a successful career\nyou got to work at it\nman if you want to exercise properly you\ngot to work at it girl\nright\nbecause we got to do all this stuff\nbecause here's this person on instagram\ntelling us how we should exercise\nand here's this you know doctor on\ntwitch or\nneuroscientist who has a podcast who's\ngoing to talk about sleep\nand meditation and now i got to meditate\nwe didn't even she didn't even include\nthis meditation is a big one i got to\nlearn how to meditate\nright\nso what do you do about this stuff the\nfirst thing is take a step back\ntake a big deep breath\nand figure out that or understand a\ncouple of things you can't work on\neverything at the same time it's just\nimpossible you just really can't\nthe other thing to understand is that\nif you work at something\nit doesn't take work forever so\ngenerally speaking the establishment of\na habit\nis the hard part and once the habit sets\nin or once you make some kind of\nprogress once you learn how to\ncommunicate better in a relationship\nthat carries with you\nso everyone wants to do everything\nby a certain time and so i'd say let go\nof that\nyou know i want to get married at this\nage i'm going to have my first kid at\nthis age i'm going to get second get at\nthis age i make this much money i'm\ngoing to retire we have like this\ntimeline right and we think that life is\na race\nso like somewhere along the way we got\nthe idea that life is a race i'm behind\noh my god that person is crushing it\nthey made their first million by 2\nthis person made their first million by\n22\nright because we have that now with\nesports and streaming and youtubers and\nall this kind of stuff\ni remember being at the twitch awards\noh sorry not twitch awards the streamer\nawards\nand meeting other streamers and like you\nknow because like you meet people and\nthen you make small talk\nand i was like you know hi my name is\nall look it's nice to meet you there's\nlike another stream in there and they're\nlike oh my god i'm such a huge fan\ni'm a sophomore in college and i'm\nstudying psychology\nand it's like we're peers right\nit's wild\ni think it's great that they're studying\npsychology i think it's great that\nthey're a very successful streamer but\nsomewhere along the way we start making\ncomparisons and we think that we got to\ngo fast\nand if you look at that tweet what\nhappens\nis like we're trying to do it all at\nonce\nbecause society has told us you can't\nnot do this it makes you a bad person if\nyou don't work on your relationships\nlike what kind of human being are you\noh my god like if you eat processed food\nwhat kind of human being are you\nright like if you don't hustle and side\nhustle and try hustle and quad hustle\nright like what kind of human being are\nyou like you're not gonna be one of the\nsuccessful humans\nthere's like the successful humans over\nhere who are crushing it and rocking it\nand posting stuff on instagram and like\ndoing all this\nstuff pen to hustle\nlike i'm gonna develop you know if we\never decide to do something besides\nhealthy gamer i'm gonna\ndevelop the penta hustle machine\nthat both allows you to eat exercise\nmeditate work\nand\nnofap all at the same time it's going to\nbe this device\nthat you plug yourself into and it's\ngoing to do everything for you all at\nonce\nthere's gonna be a chastity belt there's\ngonna be a meal tray we're gonna we're\ngonna stick in a gastric tube so you can\nget ideal nutrition you don't have to\nwaste time cooking or eating\nbecause you know what the worst roi is\nconsuming food\nand then we're gonna do this thing where\nwe have a constant we're gonna have two\nivs running one with ketamine and one\nwith caffeine that way we can like\nreduce our sleep\nto\nhighly\nefficient three hours a day with\nbiofeedback\nand then i'm gonna take this device and\ni'm gonna stick it into a sensory\ndeprivation chamber so i can get utter\nrelaxation with vr goggles so i can\ninteract with people in the world\nright\nbecause this is what's happening now we\nhave this like tech hustle culture too\nwho are saying oh by the way the\nsolution i don't know if you guys know\ndid you guys know this\nthe solution to this problem is a\nsensory deprivation infrared sauna\ndo you guys didn't realize that\nright\nlike we're gonna oh by the way download\nour app\nit'll help too\nit uses science\nand look at our board we have a\nscientist on there\nbecause we got to do everything all at\nonce\nso here's what's happening right we have\nto do everything all at once\nand then\nsociety is there\nyou could talk about capitalism if you\nwant to but if you're looking to buy\nsomething that doesn't exist\nsomeone will make it for you they're\nlike oh you're trying to do everything\nall at once\ndidn't you know that there's this device\nthat improves your meditative efficiency\nby\n88\nabsolutely we have a scientist on our\nboard\nand didn't you know that you would sleep\nbetter if you ate organic purchase this\nthing and it will improve your life\nhaving difficulty with your\nrelationships here\nlet us sell you i i literally i kid you\nnot i once talked to someone\nwho's having trouble communicating with\ntheir child and they purchased a set of\nmusical tapes\nthat will make their child more\nemotionally aware and better able to\ncommunicate\nand\nthey were just\nthey made their kid listen to the tapes\nlike\nand they were like i'm confused like\nhe's not talking to me\nand i make him listen to the tapes and\nafter he's done listening to the tapes\nhe still doesn't talk to me\nright\nso like take a step back\nfocus on one thing at a time\nrecognize that it's okay if your life is\na dumpster fire it's not actually a\ndumpster fire unless it's a dumpster\nfire you may feel like it's a dumpster\nfire but when you try to do everything\nall at once it feels overwhelming so\ntake a step back focus on one damn thing\nat a time if you get bored of one thing\nfocus on two\nyou get bored of two focus on three\ndon't go past three\nright so okay like\nthis week\ni'm gonna try to get my job in order i'm\ngonna try to clean my house and i'm\ngonna pay my bills\ndon't worry about exercise and sleep\nlike if you need to eat fast food or\nfrozen pizza eat fast food and frozen\npizza don't worry about it your heart\nwill be okay for like a week\nand then like do them one at a time and\nput your mind to it right like really\nfocus on one thing\nif you want to focus on relationships\nthen focus on relationships that's a\ngood one because if you learn\ncommunication skills it'll help you at\nyour job\nright cut yourself a break\nfocus on like two or three things at a\ntime and it's okay to not be perfect you\ndon't have to be like life is not\nactually a race\nyou don't have to be ahead of the pack i\ndon't even know where the pack is like\nyou know i don't know\nlike people you know half the world is\nlike not half but like a third of the\nworld is like literally below\nthe u.n poverty line right so like\nyou're okay\nand if you're below if you're in that\nbottom third then like that's going to\ntake some time to fix\nso cut yourself a break is the most\nimportant thing focus on like a couple\nthings at a time and recognize this is\nlike if they have one bit of wisdom that\nmaybe\npeople haven't heard before recognize\nthat the way that you feel this way\nis because society is making you feel\nthis way that doesn't necessarily mean\nit's true\nright because we live in a culture where\nwe're bombarded by like people working\non these things constantly\nso i see this a lot with people who are\nlike\nspiritually hungry\nwhere they're like going to this retreat\nand going to that retreat and going like\ni need to be like more in touch with\nmyself like i need to understand myself\nbetter like i need to learn how to\nforgive\nlike i'm\nlike i really need to learn how to\nforgive like i've been struggling to\nlearn forgiveness for so long\nand then i realized like\ni can't forgive others unless i forgive\nmyself because i read this book that\ntalks about how forgiving others sorts\nof forgiving yourself and it's like bro\nif you're beating yourself up for not\nlearning how to forgive you're like\ndefeating the point like you guys get\nthat it's like oh my god i can't forgive\nlike forgive yourself for that why don't\nyou say it's okay not to forgive\nand then like mind blown\nright\nit's okay to not forgive that's\nforgiveness\nso like we we get into this\nlike cycle without even realizing it\nright it's like\nin this like wellness cycle where it's\nlike oh i gotta work on this i gotta\nwork on this i gotta work no you don't\nyou don't actually have to work on it\nright you're allowed to be\nnot a perfect child to your parents\nyou're allowed to tell your parents you\nknow what i just don't have the\nbandwidth for your bs right now i love\nyou guys i just need to take a step back\nyou're allowed to dodge phone calls\nyou're allowed to do that\neven that what i just said requires a\ncertain amount of like\nself-understanding and being able to\ncommunicate you're allowed to not answer\nthe phone if someone that is stressing\nyou out doesn't you know you don't have\nto answer it right now\nnow if you have some kind of\nrelationship at some point you don't\nwant to like ghost them\nright you want to disappear off the face\nof the earth like send them a text\nmessage let them know you're doing okay\nbut like you don't have to answer i just\ndon't have the bandwidth for this right\nnow so here's the concrete piece of\nadvice\ni just don't have the bandwidth for this\nright now\nright so like that's something you need\nto learn to tell other people and learn\nto tell yourself it's okay just don't\nhave the bandwidth for it right now\nthat's fine\nright\nquestions that's my wisdom\nit's like be aware of what society is\ndoing to you\nand don't fall for it\nyeah there we go so out fair saying then\ni should have more bandwidth exactly\nright so\ni bet you\nif someone came up with a product\nthat they claimed\nturn 24 hours\nof a day into 26 hours of a day\nsomeone would buy it\nsomeone was like we've discovered this\nsupplement that alters the perception of\ntime and the speeds up your neurons by\n18\nand allows you to get 26 hours out of a\nday instead of 24.\nsomeone would buy that\nit's called 420.\ni like that so big brain plays are\nsaying limitless that's that's the brand\nhey how y'all doing today my name is dr\nkonodra i'm here from limitless\nwe've discovered how to warp the\nperception of time in our brains and\nwe're allowed to we've we've\nbroken the time barrier\nand we are now limitless\ntm\ntrademark\ndot\nlimitless dot alive because we couldn't\nbuy the dot com\nbecause it's used by another\nmotivational speaker\nyou"
