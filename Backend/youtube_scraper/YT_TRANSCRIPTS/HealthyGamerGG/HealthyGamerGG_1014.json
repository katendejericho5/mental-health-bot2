come\nfrom a lot of it's romanticized a lot of\nit's\nmythologized\na lot of times we think like in binary\ncircumstances the other thing is we\ndon't think about\nwhy this is an important question for us\nnow are there particular things in my\nlife that are making this an important\nquestion\ncan i optimize those things will that\nmake me more content\nwhy am i not resilient am i spoiled\nhello hg community i am 25 this year m\ni'm currently working at my third\ncompany since graduating with an\nengineering degree in 2020\nthe first company i worked at i wasn't\nreally interested in it but the people\nthere were very nice and it wasn't\nstressful\ni never thought of leaving so soon about\nthree months until one day i got an\noffer for for my second company it\nsounded like what i really wanted to do\nand they could accept me despite not\nhaving\nmuch experience with it so i went with\nit\nhowever after a few months i realized\nthe company was not what i expected and\ni felt really\nfrustrated working there so i left my\nparents weren't supportive of me leaving\nmy second job because they don't want me\nto have a bad\nrecord of job hopping\nnow i'm at my third company and facing\ndifficulties because there's a lot to\nlearn\nmy mentor that's not really nice helpful\nand that's not what i'm interested in\ni feel a lot of pressure and anxiety\nbecause i don't know a lot of what i\nshould do and it's hard for me to learn\nand catch up\nand i feel like i don't have the right\nmentality that the company would want\ni'm just in this job because it's a\ntypical sustainable job\nwhat i'm really interested in is the\nfitness industry\ni i like working out in nutrition a lot\nevery day that is mostly what's on my\nmind which is why i recently started\ntrying out part-time to see if i can\nfully venture into this field someday\nhowever being a fitness trainer isn't\nthe most stable job or so it seems even\ni myself am figuring out whether it is a\nfeasible thing to do i actually do still\nlike engineering but engineering is a\nwide field and i just am not in the\nfield i wanted\nin my high school years i loved physics\nand would be inquisitive about\neverything\nit's sad how that passion died out after\ngrowing up and learning the more\ntechnical boring stuff\nor maybe i'm just interested on the\nsurface level should i stay at my\ncurrent job can i succeed in this field\nwithout having interest\nis this a learning curve everyone faces\ni told myself to stay for at least a few\nyears because i'm tired of switching\njobs and frankly this industry\nbut i don't want to mess up in my\ncurrent job because of my incompetency\ni wonder if i'm just spoiled and not\nwilling to face hardships\nplease ask me uh please advise me on\nwhat i should\ndo or work on i might not have described\nmy situation in detail so feel free to\nask for clarification\nthanks for reading so let's look a\nlittle bit further\nadditional context that might matter\nthe duration of my first second and\ncurrent job are three months seven\nmonths and seven months to present\nwhen i was young my mama asked me if i\nwanted to learn the piano i said i would\ngive it a try after some time i didn't\nlike it but my mom insisted\nme to continue to not waste it\neventually i would quit after the third\ngrade\ni studied japanese language with a\nprivate tutor after year so i began to\nlose interest i studied until the n3\nlevel i tried going after a girl that i\nhad a crush on for about three months\nafter that i lost interest and stopped\npursuing because i felt it felt\none-sided although she said she's\nwilling to give me a chance\ni know dating is a whole other topic but\nyeah just providing more info ha ha\nokay\nso very similar right\nin your 20s\ntrying to figure out\ni have engineering jobs\ni don't really like what i do\nnot sure i should quit\ni'm passionate about the fitness\nindustry started doing it on the side\nright so we're seeing some patterns so\nwhat's the first thing that we're going\nto look at\nwe're going to look at some of these\ntemporal factors temporary factors so\nonce again when we're struggling to make\ncareer decisions\nright we don't know it's like okay i'm\nin this field it pays pretty well\npeople are advising me to stay in it\nit's safe\nbut it's not my passion i don't really\nenjoy it that much\nbut the problem is that my passion\nis like less stable i don't know how to\nmake a career out of it i don't know\nwhat kind of money i can make really\ncommon situation right we're stuck\nbetween a rock and a hard place which\none should i do\nso the first thing that we're going to\nlook at once again is the temporary\nfactors\nbecause what begs this question why are\nwe asking this question now where is\nthis question coming from\nso oftentimes when people come to me\nright they'll say like\noh you know i need to see a psychiatrist\nand then i'll ask them what's changed\nrecently why now\nand oftentimes we don't appreciate the\ntemporary factors that make us that push\nus to make these like drastic life\nchanges\nand so let's take a look at those\nokay\nso\nfacing difficulties because there's a\nlot to learn\nmy mentor that's not really nice helpful\nand that's not what i'm interested in i\nfeel a lot of pressure and anxiety\nit's hard for me to learn and catch up\ni don't have the right mentality that\nthe company would want\nright so there are a lot of things that\nare internal here and i know it sounds\nkind of weird but the person is asking\nam i resilient am i not resilient am i\nspoiled\nand the answer to that question may be\nsort of so i don't think that this\nperson is spoiled\nbut i think that they\nmay have a dimension to grow\nokay so this is we're going to kind of\ntake a step back\nand let's think a little bit about like\nwhat do we perceive\nas what a career is like or what a job\nis like like where do we get these ideas\nof like what work should be like\nright like where do we get our ideas of\nlike what should i expect from a job\nlike am i spoiled do i should i stick\nwith it\nyou know\nso and it's like all kinds of different\ninformation that's very poor in quality\nso the first thing is that we've got\nunfortunately a lot of people from the\ngeneration above us\ntelling us to that we're spoiled and\nthat we have it easy and back in my day\ndot dot yada yada\nright so we get this idea like am i\nspoiled like do i have it really good\nlike\nand it's not just coming from them it\nalso comes from us\nit comes from media comes from social\nmedia so we have this growing trend in\nour society\nto gatekeep suffering and unhappiness\nbased on privilege\nright so what we started to say\nincreasingly so is that there's two\ncamps of people there's the privileged\nand the non-privileged and if you're\nprivileged\nand you complain about something you're\nspoiled you're a wuss you're you know\nnot a good person you don't realize how\ngood you have it\nand if you're in the underprivileged\nclass\nthen\nall of your suffering is acceptable\nlegitimate etc\nso i tend to\nfall on buddha with this\non his side which buddha said that\nsuffering is like a general aspect of\nthe human condition and i think even\nneuroscientifically\nyou know there are all kinds there's all\nkinds of data that we know that for\nexample people who do have a certain\namount of income are statistically more\nlikely to be happy you have more\nsecurity you have less cortisol you have\nto worry less so there are actually like\ngood correlations with like happiness\ncontentment security and income so\nprivilege does absolutely matter but\nit's not the it's not binary\nright that people with privilege still\ndo struggle and we see that right\nbecause this person seems like they've\ngot a stable job it's like what are you\ncomplaining about\nand so that aspect of judgment\ncauses us to feel like we're spoiled\nright because i have it so good what am\ni complaining about\nand so then once again like if you're\nthinking about making a career change\nbecause there are aspects of your job\nthat are hard\nit's hard for me to catch up it's hard\nfor me to learn\ni don't really like what i do my mentor\ndoesn't seem that interested in teaching\nme\nso those all feel like temporary things\nto me\nso those could change depending on the\ncompany depending on the field depending\non the you know the situation so i'd be\ncareful about making a drastic career\nchange based on what i kind of call\ntemporary factors i mean they may\npersist and the whole point is if they\npersist then you're more likely to make\na career shift or it's more important to\nmake a career shift so be a little bit\ncareful about those things\nnow the next thing that i want to talk\nabout is like where is our perception\ncoming from\nabout what a career should look like\nis a career supposed to be\nhard\nor easy\nare we supposed to be interested in it\nor not interested in it\nwhat makes us excel\nand this is where once again media and\nsociety mythologize and romanticize the\nconcept of a career\nso they think that there's like there's\nthis mythical thing there's a unicorn\nout there which is like something that\nyou do that pays really well\nand that you wake up every day being\nenergized and passionate\nand can't get enough of\nright you work it's like this hustle\nculture where like you just like you're\ngrinding right like\nand it's i do it because i love it my\npassion is so great that it drowns\neverything else out\nyou should see those people's personal\nrelationships by the way they're an\nabsolute mess\nyou look at these people who are like in\ninvestment banking got been divorced\nthree times or third marriage been\ndivorced twice\n55 years old\nmore money than they know what to do\nwith\nthere's always a price that myth i\nwouldn't really chase that myth\nthe reason is because once again we have\nlike most people out there are kind of\nlike doing something in the middle\nright they don't have something that\nthey're incredibly passionate about\nand even i can say this i mean i think\ni'm\ngenerally on the you know the luckiest\none percent here because i really enjoy\nwhat i do and i don't think you guys see\nthis but like i don't enjoy what i do\nmost days\nlike most of my day is taken up with\nstuff that i find absolutely exhausting\nand unenjoyable\nwhat i love doing is talking to people\nright but now it's like it's like\nmeetings\nand like gotta run this and gotta do\nthat and like take this meeting and all\nthis kind of stuff there's a lot of\nstuff that even i do that i don't like\ni'm not saying that i'm unlucky i think\ni'm definitely on the luckier side\nbecause all that stuff is in service to\nsomething that i really care about so\ni'm really lucky that way\nbut we get this idea that\nwork is something that we're supposed to\nbe\nenjoying day in and day out\nam i no i didn't say i was unhappy i\nsaid i don't enjoy\ni'm very happy\ni just don't enjoy most of how i spend\nmy days\nright and so someone else is saying work\nis literal slavery and it's like sort of\nso this is where in my opinion work is\nabout value\nthat's what i think is the best reason\nto work is to create value let's think\nabout it on a very simple level i'm sure\nthere are economists or\nyou know political philosophers who know\nway better than i do will pick apart\nwhat i'm saying this is just how i've\nunderstood it okay as an ignorant person\nlayman\nso generally speaking let's look at\nfarmers like so if i'm a farmer and i\ngrow food\nand there's a blacksmith who makes tools\nif both of us are doing both things\nwe'd\ndo less we'd be less successful it'd\ntake more time and our quality would be\nlower than if we like specialize and\neach do one thing\nso the blacksmith provides value to a\ngroup of farmers the farmers provide\nvalue to a group of\nblacksmiths right that's kind of like\nfundamentally what work is about it's in\nmy opinion it's about generating value\nit's about trying to make the world like\na better place\nand that doesn't mean charity it means\nlike trying to like you know enrich the\nlives of people around me and the whole\nidea is that if we all kind of do this\nthen if there's a farmer if there's a if\nwe have two farmers versus one farmer\nand one blacksmith\nthe blacksmith increases the yield of\neach individual farmer by giving them\nhigh quality tools\nand then the net result is that like we\nhave more efficiency than we ever did\nbefore\nright because like five farmers with\ngood tools\nwill out produce\nsix farmers\nso efficiently like one blacksmith plus\nfive farmers out produces six farmers\nand if you guys play video games like\nyou'll see that this is like video game\nanalogies right we know this\nthat like if i'm playing starcraft i can\nbuild seven zealots or i can build six\nzealots in one upgrade\nand the six zealots with one upgrade\nwell actually they may lose to the seven\nzealots but at some point there's some\nkind of economy of scale right\nso 20 zealots with one upgrade is going\nto outperform 21 zealots with zero\nupgrades\nso that's the same thing\nso work is about creating value it\ndoesn't necessarily have to be\neasy or fun\nit's really about generating value\nthat's why we do things\nand what we also tend to find is that\nyou know compensation is dependent on\nhow much value you generate versus how\nhard it is what you do all kinds of\ndifferent things there i'm not going to\nget into that because i don't understand\nthat stuff very well\nbut the first thing that i'd kind of\ndisabuse you of is the idea that like\nyou're supposed to enjoy what you do day\nin and day out because the truth of the\nmatter is that like if if the goal is\nvalue like that's not the same as\nenjoyment\nand somewhere along the way what\nhappened is like we started generating\nso much value that recreation became a\npart of it we some people really enjoy\nwhat they do i think you should\nabsolutely gravitate towards what you're\nenjoying what you do\nbut in terms of being spoiled like\nyou're not supposed to enjoy every\nminute of it or there may be rough\npatches\nright so i really like detested parts of\nmedical school i detested parts of\nresidency i really did not enjoy those\nthere are parts of my day to day that i\ndon't like\nand so i'm not going to say just suck it\nup because i don't think that's helpful\nit's to acknowledge\nthat not everything that you do is going\nto be fun\nand if you're asking the question are\nyou spoiled i don't think you're spoiled\nbut i think it's important to\nacknowledge\nthat there are going to be parts of what\nyou do that you don't enjoy and that's\nokay\nright because like that's not what we've\nmet that's not like how we mythologize\nwork\nbecause even like if you look at like a\nmovie like i remember watching the firm\nwhich is a book by john grisham that got\nturned into a movie in these lawyer\nmovies right like they show like these\nmontages of like attorneys like flipping\nthrough books\nand in like 60 seconds they're like oh\nlook at how hard they're working do you\nall realize like how much that sucks in\nreal life but we romanticize that right\nif you look at a a lawyer movie what\nyou're going to see is like powerful\nscenes in the courtroom\nthat's going to be like half of the\nmovie\nand five minutes is going gonna be like\npeople flipping through books if you're\nan actual attorney 99 of it is flipping\nthrough books one percent is in the\ncourtroom\nso we get these like perceptions that\nthis is how it's supposed to be\nif you watch grey's anatomy it's like oh\nmy god this person has a ticking time\nbob inside them\ni can't move my hand otherwise the bomb\nwill explode\nand what you'll see is in some scenes\nthey'll have books on the bookshelf\nwhereas most of medical school and\nmedicine i mean not medical school for\nsure\nis like the books it's not taking time\nbombs\nmost of the crappy part of medicine is\ntyping i kid you not\nthe reason i became a psychiatrist\ninstead of oncologist number one reason\nactually maybe not number one what a\nhuge one was i realized so i had advice\nfrom a really good advice from a mentor\nwho was like you should do one month of\npsychiatry and one month of medicine and\nat the end of every day write down what\nyou like and what you don't like\nof that day forget about the field\nforget about the big picture on a\nday-to-day basis what do you like and\nwhat do you dislike and that's what i\nrealized brilliant idea\nwhen i was doing physical medicine i\nliterally spent\n10 hours a day in front of a computer\nyou round once in the morning you check\nup on all your patients have you all\nbeen in the hospital you'll know this\ndoctors show up they'll listen to your\nheart and lungs they hang around for 10\nminutes and then they leave\nthen they show up at 5 pm\nsee you for another 10 minutes then they\nleave\nright 10 minutes if you're lucky\nsometimes it's 5.\nwhat are they doing the rest of these\nsitting on their asses i they're writing\nnotes sending orders monitoring vital\nsigns in front of a computer\nyou used to have to walk around\nand see charts now everything's on the\ncomputer i spent 10 hours a day in front\nof a computer\nin psychiatry\nthe least amount of time in front of the\ncomputer i got to sit with human beings\nthat's when i was like oh i got into\nmedicine to like help people\nnot click buttons\nlike clicking buttons and optimizing\nstuff is what i do in video games i\ndon't want to spend my time doing that\nbut some people really enjoy that right\nwhich is totally fine\nso you spoil i don't think you're\nspoiled but i think it's important to\nrecognize your cognitive biases about\nwhat to expect\nand that if you're generating value and\nthat's really what work is about right\nlike if we think about what we\ncompensate people for\ni'd like to think\ndepending on you know\nwhat your political and economic\nphilosophies are and what you read and\nhow knowledgeable you are you may\ndisagree with that which is fine i'm not\nsaying i'm right here but i'd like to\nthink that generally speaking it's about\ngenerating value\nand generating value isn't necessarily\naligned with like enjoying yourself\nso if you're struggling to figure out\nwhat to do and you're like should i\ntolerate this more is the grass greener\non the other side it's been my\nexperience that the most effective way\nto build a career\nis not necessarily in macroscopic\nchanges but in like minor modifications\nas you go through it and those are those\ntemporary factors so if you're in\nengineering\nyou know and you're like you don't enjoy\nlike you don't have a good mentorship\nrelationship don't quit and go into\nfitness like try to find a good\nmentorship relationship\nso try to fix all of the things that are\nwrong in your job first before you\nswitch careers\ndo the level best that you can\nfind work that you consider more\nengaging because this person is talking\nabout like some stuff that like\nbut i don't think they kind of realize\nso it's sad how my passion died out\ngrowing up\nand learning more of the technical\nboring stuff this is where the value\ncomes from\nright like learning about the theory of\ngravity is super cool\nbut at some point like if you want to\nsend a spaceship into the air\nthere's a lot of just like straight math\nwithout the spaceship going into the air\nyears and years or even decades\nof like the boring stuff that's that's\nhow you get something into the air\nso like the technical boring stuff is\nlike how you bring oftentimes value to\nthe world right like that's where like i\ndon't like it's not fun to call a\npharmacy\nand try to figure out\nwhy like this prescription is not being\ngiven to the patient\nlike my job is to help people\nbut\nin order to do that sometimes they need\nmedication\nand so figuring out which medication\nthey need and like like that's all\ndiagnostically very satisfying and stuff\nlike i'm helping this human being that's\ngreat fulfilling they feel better they\nthey're getting better that enriches me\nbut at the end of the day the\npracticalities\nof prescribing the medication has a lot\nof crap\nit's studying pharmacology\nright it's memorizing this gigantic list\nof pharmacologic interactions\nthat before i\nprescribe a particular medication i need\nto remember to ask the patient do you\ndrink grapefruit juice\nright i have to remember and memorize\nall these really really minut tasks i\nhave to set up speed dial with the\npharmacy so i can get the patient the\nmedication there's a lot of it that\nsucks\nand so i'm not saying like you just got\nto suck it up but you know understand\nthat that's a piece of it\nand so you should try to optimize that\nas much as you want to as much as you\ncan but recognize that that's a piece of\nit\nand then over time what you'll find is\nthat there are going to be some jobs\nwhere that stuff is too much\nright like\nit's just not worth it for you which is\ntotally fine\nbut it takes time to figure that out you\nhave to give it a shot\neveryone's getting caught up in\ngrapefruit juice\nthe last thing that i'd say\nis that\nyou know if you're someone who's in\nengineering and you love fitness\ni don't think that's an either or and\nthis is where once again i think that\nthere's sort of this idea\nthat if you're in engineering you have\nto like\nswitch\ninto fitness and become a personal\ntrainer i would move away from that\nthinking if you can so be more creative\nso instead of just assuming that like\nthe only way you can get into fitness\nand nutrition is to be a personal\ntrainer like recognize that your real\nvalue in the world and your real success\nis not going to be choosing either or\nit's actually combining the two\nso if you have a technical expertise and\na passion is there any way you can\ncombine the two\ni love video games but i'm a\npsychiatrist\nwhich one should i quit my job as a\npsychiatrist to become a professional\nvideo gamer\noh interesting\nlike those are my options right it's not\nlike i can start streaming on twitch\nand talking to gamers it's not like i\ncan be a psychiatrist for esports teams\nit's not like i can develop a program to\nhelp other content creators with their\nmental health\nand so i wonder\nis there anything in the fitness\nindustry\nthat needs an engineer\nare people in the fitness industry i\ndon't know making devices\nthat require engineering expertise\nright is there anyone in like\nis there a field of engineering\nthat\ninvolves nutrition i don't know maybe\nsomething like biomedical engineering\nand this is where you say\nbut that's not what i'm trained in i'm a\nstructural engineer\nwell that's where like it's pretty cool\nbut there are a lot of companies out\nthere that what they really need is like\na core skill set not a particular\nexpertise and so lateral moves are\nabsolutely possible especially within\nstartups\nbecause especially the frontier of\nthings\nyou may like the core it's the core\ntechnical stuff that you hate which is\nlike applicable across fields\nright and so startups are the ones where\nlike they're doing something new anyway\nso like sort of experience matters less\nsometimes it can matter a whole lot but\nit's like you're not going to be you\nknow like\nhow can i say this like if i'm starting\na food truck\nand i'm making burgers\nit's more important for me to have\nsomeone who knows how to cook than\nsomeone who's been working at a burger\nplace for 10 years does that make sense\nand that changes some\nright like in engineering like\nstructural engineers may not really like\nif you're talking about precise medical\ndevice equipment like there may be like\na steep learning curve there so i don't\nknow that you can make you know\nan intra-arterial stent\nif you're a structural engineer\nbut i guess that you know a lot of it is\nlike fluid dynamics and core equations\nand you know like clotting stuff like\nyou can learn a lot of that stuff so i'm\nnot saying it's easy to make that shift\nbut ideally what you can actually do is\nnot choose either or but combine them\nand in fact that's where your value is\ngonna be the highest\nso there are gonna be fitness companies\nout there that are looking about looking\nfor engineers like i can find some guy\nwho's a good engineer who doesn't give a\ncrap about my product\nor i can find someone who doesn't have\nquite the technical expertise that i'm\nlooking for\nbut absolutely is a strong engineer who\nhas got a good work history and is is\nlike comes in and is like clearly a\nfitness buff and cares about what they\ndo and you've got a real shot there\nand the interesting thing is that's also\nironically how you may make the most\nmoney\nyou're going to combine your skill set\nwith your passion and you'll generate\nthe most value\nright and someone saying electrical\nengineers do whatever they want to\nyou're right like i've seen electrical\nengineers in all kinds of positions\nso it's it's interesting i mean i think\nthat like we we think a lot\nwe don't realize where our notions\nof what a career should look like come\nfrom we don't realize where they come\nfrom a lot of it's romanticized a lot of\nit's\nmythologized\na lot of times we think like in binary\ncircumstances the other thing is we\ndon't think about\nwhy this is an important question for us\nnow are there particular things in my\nlife that are making this an important\nquestion can i optimize those things\nwill that make me more content\nis there some way to combine these two\nthings\nand if the question is are you spoiled\nlike well that sort of depends on what\nyour expectations are and how hard you\nwork\nso i think spoiled is more about\nexpectations than it is about like\nanything else right because it's like\nyou have this idea that it's supposed to\nbe this way that's what we think about\nis spoiled i'm spoiled because like i\nwanted pasta and this isn't pasta i\nwanted the carly pasta not the straight\npasta it's about expectations\nand letting go of expectations\nso recognize that whatever you do\nthere's going to be some work that you\ndon't enjoy\nlike that's probably going to be a part\nof it so stop looking for that unicorn\nbecause it let's assume it doesn't exist\nor maybe a better way to put it is the\nunicorn is not found it's crafted\nso optimize each part of your life if\nyou don't have good mentorship find good\nmentorship\nif you don't like your current job but\nyou've moved jobs too recently you need\nto stay there for a year but the next\ntime you switch jobs you're going to\nlook for some of these things what is\nthe leadership sugar look like what is\nthe learning environment look like and\nwhen they ask you during an interview\ndo you have any questions for us\nthat's when now that you've been at\nthree different jobs you're gonna know\nwhat kinds of questions to ask\nthink about how can you ask a question\nwhat's a question if you don't like the\njob that you're in\nhere's how to prepare for your next\ninterview you have to ask yourself what\nare the questions i should have asked in\nthis interview that would have flagged\nmy current job situation and that's what\nyou need to ask\nthe most important part of the job\ninterview everyone's like oh my god i'm\ninterviewing how do i do good interview\nforget about doing good in an interview\nthe most important part of a job\ninterview is you figuring out what the\njob is right for you\nit's not about impressing them\nand then craft your life one step at a\ntime\nright if you're a fitness buff\nlike\nsee if there are like people at fitness\nstartups that are hiring engineers\nand you apply and this is where like\ndon't\nyou know negotiate against yourself oh\nthey're looking for this kind of\nengineering\nthat's not what i have so i might as\nwell not apply just apply anyway write a\nreally strong cover letter hey i know\nyou all are looking for this kind of\nengineering\ntruth is\ni'm a really good engineer i have strong\ntechnical skills i'm not exactly what\nyou all are looking for but i really\nlove fitness\nthat's why i'm making such a you know\nthat's why i'm applying to this job\nbecause i care about this stuff\na lot i'd really appreciate an interview\nright and this is where you're gonna say\nthings\nlike\nby the way\num one of my strengths is that\neven when there's a lot to learn and\nit's hard for me to like\nwhen there's a lot to learn and i have a\nlot of catching up to do and i don't\nhave good mentorship i can do that\nreally well that's actually what\nhappened in my current job\nis that i'm really good at like learning\nthings even when i'm behind and like\ncatching up in the absence of good\nteaching\nthat's something to start up with love\nbecause that's what a lot of startup\nwork is because there's no one to teach\nit to you because it's new"
