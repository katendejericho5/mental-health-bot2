    "transcript": "and so then what happens is my mind is\nunsatisfied with a b unsatisfied with a\nc unsatisfied with a d\nthe only thing it'll look for is an a\nand a guaranteed a at that\nbecause if i don't get an a and it winds\nup being a b then i'm screwed and i've\nfallen further behind and i had this\nopportunity to make things up and i\ncan't make it up so what does that\nreadiness mean readiness means a\nguarantee of an a\nso if you're afraid of death and you\nneed to make up and you want to live\nlife to the fullest what readiness means\nis knowing that you will live life to\nthe fullest\ni want to live life to the fullest\nbut i don't know how\nbit of background\n23 and from the uk fell into major\ndepression anxiety right after leaving\nhigh school and have been piecing my\nlife\npiecing together my life the last two or\nthree years\nthe rut started because of a realization\nof death interesting it sent me into a\npanic mode an instant instantly and it\nwas always on my mind every single day\nfor at least a year wow that sounds\nterrible\ni'd have constant panic attacks which\nled to agoraphobia and nowadays social\nanxiety\nthankfully the fear of death has\nsubsided\nbut it's left\na feeling of wanting more out of life\nit's almost given me pressure to go out\nand do things i want to do because life\nis so short\ni've been playing catch-up the last few\nyears seeing my friend my past friends\ngo to university and graduate whilst i\nwas homebound was honestly soul crushing\ni never thought i would have been in\nthat position\ni'd speak to peers online and have to\nmake up lies about my situation because\ni was so embarrassed to tell them my\nstory\nat one point i couldn't walk outside my\nhouse it was that bad and it was even\nmore hurtful seeing people i knew having\nthe time of their lives whilst i was\nstuck in helpless\nat times it felt like the world had\nmoved on and i was ready and i was left\nbehind with no direction or path\nit still does feel like that sometimes\ni'm in a position now where i see\nfriends moving on family members moving\non with their lives etc\ni feel ready to move on and pursue the\nlife that i've always wanted to live but\nfor some reason i'm scared\nmy anxiety has lessened but i still\ndon't go out much\ni'm still anxious around people and\nstill insecure with who i am\ni've accepted my anxiety and have made\nmassive progress but i still feel left\nbehind\nhow do i even begin to just go my own\nway throughout those years where my\nmental health was at its worst i\ncouldn't do what i wanted to do but now\nthat i feel okay i still don't feel\nready to just go out there and do it how\ndo i overcome this\ni have dreams of becoming a tattooist\ni'm drawing every day but i don't feel\nready yet\ni've wanted to start going to the gym\nand get some gains\nbut i don't feel ready i want to connect\nwith old friends and have a good time\nbut i don't feel prepared enough i'm too\nanxious what if they ask me how i've\nbeen doing these last few years\nevery single thing i want to do has an\nexcuse of not feeling ready but why am i\nlike this\nwhen i have this fear of death\npressuring me to just go out and live\nlife to the fullest because we're all\ngoing to\ngo someday\ni feel like if i don't address this now\ni will regret it the older i get i don't\nwant to look back on my life and i feel\nashamed\ni want to i want to feel proud of who i\nbecame and what i did\nso part of the reason we're sharing this\nis that this is a story of someone who\nhad anxiety had depression you know fell\nbehind\nright so it sounds like maybe they\ndropped out of school for a little bit\nor something like that we're not\nentirely sure\nand now they've made progress right\nso their anxiety is a lot better they\nstill sometimes feel that way\nyou know they've accepted their anxiety\nthey're like starting to get better\nand so the tricky thing is like when we\nhave sort of a clinical diagnosis like\ndepression or anxiety and we're not able\nto do stuff we've got an excuse\nright\nand this is one of the problems i think\nwith mental health today is that we'll\ntreat the depression and anxiety and\nthen we enter this sort of like\nintermediate period\nwhere like my anxiety is better\nmaybe i'm not as agoraphobic maybe the\npanic attacks have gotten better the\nfear of death has gotten better but i\nstill can't\ndo what i want to do\ni don't feel ready i've fallen behind\nand so\nit's almost like\nyou know in physical injuries we have\nthis idea of rehab so you have the\nstroke\nand then you have the stroke care\nright maybe you'll\ndo a tpa or like whatever you do some\nkind of procedure\nand then there's this sort of assumption\nthat like after you have a big physical\ninjury let's say you break a bone\nwith physical medicine we're really\nreally good at sort of saying like okay\nwe're gonna give you medical care right\nyou're gonna have the surgeon who's\ngonna come and fix your leg they're\ngonna put nails in it or whatever screws\nand then you're gonna go see a physical\ntherapist for six months\nand get back to where you were\nso in physical medicine we have a good\ninjury control\nrehabilitation to back to where you are\nokay\nwhen it comes to mental health care this\nis missing\nright so like we'll have treatments for\nanxiety\nwe'll have treatments for depression\nbut what do you do afterward\nright so like now you're 23 your friends\nare all way ahead of you\nlike how do you deal with that\nand so there's a big part of this so\nwhat we're going to do is kind of\napproach this in a couple of different\nways\none thing is i'm not going to go too\nmuch into the concept of falling behind\nbecause there's a whole video about that\non dr k's guide in the depression module\nthere's some scott or fallen behind\nwhere that comes from things like that\nhow to deal with that we're still going\nto talk about something but if you guys\nare really interested in that that\nresonates with you that's kind of we\nalready have that there so we're going\nto focus on other things today\nso then what happens is like you've kind\nof fallen behind right you've missed out\non some years\nso when i've missed out on something i\nneed to make up for it right\nso now like you have this fear of death\nyou've missed out on a couple years you\nwant to live life to the fullest\nbut you're paralyzed\nyou're not ready\nso what's going on there what does it\nmean to be not ready why do we need to\nbe ready\nwhat are we looking for\nso the first thing to understand is that\nif the number one reason\nwhy we don't do things when we want to\ndo things i mean i don't know if it's\nthe number one reason\nis not being ready this concept of\nwriting this is something that's very\nvery dangerous\nit's very very sneaky\nand it keeps us very paralyzed\nso one thing\nlet's try to dig into this a little bit\nokay\nso what is readiness when i feel ready\nhow do i feel right because this is like\ni'm i don't feel ready what what do we\nthink of what are we shooting for when\nwe want to feel ready we feel confident\nwe feel prepared\nso what does go readiness sort of mean\nit means that i can handle what comes\ni'm not 100 sure about what's coming but\ni can handle it\nright that's what it means to be ready\nso like i'm ready for this test so\nwhatever the test sends me i you know i\ncan handle it\nso the first thing to understand is that\nif we've fallen behind and we lack\nconfidence in ourselves\nwhat is that going to do to our sense of\nreadiness\nnow that what i mean by that is like\nfeeling ready and being ready are two\nentirely different things\nand the problem is that if you feel\ninsecure if you lack confidence if\nyou've fallen behind\nas long as you believe that\nyou will never be ready\nbecause you can prepare and prepare and\nprepare\nbut as long as you lack the confidence\nyou'll never feel ready you can be ready\nlike what do you need to be ready to go\nto the gym\nmaybe a bottle of water that's it\nright like\nwhat else do you need you don't need\nanything the whole point is you do the\nwork there\nso readiness is tricky because readiness\nis\na problem\nthat is born of our insecurity which\nappears to have an external solution\nand that's what gets us stuck\nbecause we go on thinking okay let me\nget these workout clothes let me get\nthis water bottle let me start\nexercising at home we look at all of\nthese internal solutions but the source\nof on unreadiness is right here and it\nkeeps on spewing a feeling of\nunreadiness\nand so we go on like trying to fix our\nlife trying to fix our life trying to\nfix our life and we never make any\nprogress\neven though we're making progress\nand so then we don't act\nokay\nso the other thing that i kind of want\nto point out is that like sometimes when\nwe feel insecure\nlet's like just look at the social\nexample for a second\nour mind will start to project\nokay so i'm still anxious around people\nand still insecure with who i am\ni've accepted my anxiety and have made\nmassive progress but i still feel left\nbehind\ni want to reconnect with my old friends\nand have a good time but i don't feel\nprepared enough i'm too anxious what if\nthey ask me\nhow i've been doing these last few years\nand we can see this too where the person\nkind of says\ni never thought i would have been in\nthat position i'd speak to peers online\nand make up lies about my situation\nso in terms of social readiness\ni want to reconnect with people i lie\nabout my situation what's going on there\nso what's wrong with saying\nyou know last two or three years have\nbeen rough the pandemic hit me hard i\nactually got like hit with really bad\nanxiety and depression and it really\nthrew me off and like honestly it took\nyears to just get over the anxiety and\nnow i'm putting my life back together\nwhat's wrong with saying that\nright\nso then people will say well like what\nwill people think they'll think i'm\npathetic now let's understand be careful\nlet's understand\nif you think that sharing your life will\nmake other people think you're pathetic\nwhere does that idea come from\nwhy does your mind conclude that someone\nelse will think you're pathetic\nright so like i i mean this has been my\nexperience that when you share with\nsomeone that you're struggling and\nyou're making progress and stuff like\nthat as long as like you don't\nmonopolize the conversation about it and\nmention it at every turn and you\nactually hang out and have a good time i\nactually think most people will respect\nyou for that\nand it's not like the last two or three\nyears have been easy on most people\nright let's be honest like the pandemic\nhas accelerated how bad rental health is\neveryone's been on the struggle bus\npeople who say like i've been on the\nstruggle bus oftentimes will open the\ndoor for connection because everyone\nelse has been struggling but no one\nwants to say it so we all lie to each\nother that everything is okay\nand then we don't engage with each other\nand we become further isolated because\nwe don't want to share how much we're\nstruggling\nso where does it come from it comes from\nhere\nright because what we do\nis like human\nnature\nwe insert into the minds of other people\nthe way that we think ourselves\nso it's the person who has the affair\nthat is paranoid that their partner is\ncheating on them\nright it's the person who trusts other\nhuman beings who gets taken advantage of\nright until they learn\nso we assume that other people will come\nto the same conclusions we have that's\njust how the mind works it's how our\nempathic circuitry works\nso since you feel like you're pathetic\nif people knew that if they saw you they\nwould come to the same conclusion\nwhereas like that's not actually usually\nthe case\nright usually like when people think\nsomeone is pathetic it's not because\nthey're actually struggling it's because\nof the way in which they\nadvertise their patheticness\nso there's something to be learned there\nfor sure but generally speaking the\nreason that you think everyone's going\nto think this way is because you feel\nthat way about yourself so i'll give you\nlike another example eating disorders\nsomeone can be have a bmi of 14\nand think they're overweight and they'll\nbe embarrassed\nto wear a swimsuit because everyone else\nis gonna think i'm so fat i'm so fat i'm\nso disgusting\neveryone else is going to think that way\ntoo\ni use that as an example because like\nhopefully i'll understand some about\neating disorders and you can see that's\njust like that's not how other people\nare going to think right you can have\nsomeone who's got an eating disorder\nand other people will be telling them\nyou're underweight you're underweight\nyou need to gain weight you need to gain\nweight and the person with the eating\ndisorder if they've got it in their head\nthat they're overweight\nno amount of like\nstuff is going to change that so that's\nwhen it rises to the clinical level\nwhere like they're very impervious to\nfeedback and stuff like that but even\nremember that clinical pathology\noftentimes is an amplification of what\nactually exists within us\nso everyone can feel sad when it rises\nto a certain level we call it depression\neveryone worries about the future when\nit rises to a certain level we call it\nanxiety\neveryone is worried about what people\nthink when it rises to a particular\nlevel we call it social anxiety and\neating disorders the opinions of others\nprojecting our judgments\non to how other people are going to\nperceive us as human nature it's how we\nwork that's the nature of empathy\nright so i can understand what that\nperson is thinking because i can think\nit myself\nthere are all kinds of other little\nthings like so gift giving is a good\nexample of this\nwhere for some people giving gifts is\nlike a huge huge\nshow\nof\nlike a particular it means something in\na relationship for other people gift\ngiving is more casual\nright so like when i don't get a gift\ni interpret that as my partner does not\nlove me and does not care about me\nbecause that's what it means to me it\nmay mean something completely different\nto him or the flip side is i didn't get\nmy partner a gift and i'm torn up with\nguilt because guilt uh gifts are very\nimportant to me but my partner really\ndoesn't care that much they're totally\nfine with it they don't you know not\nthat big of a deal\nso we project our own judgments onto\nother people\nokay so the key thing to understand here\nis when you don't feel ready there's\nbeing ready and there's feeling ready\nand feeling ready comes from you\nsome amount of preparation can help for\nsure\nright so like i don't feel ready for a\ntest i may not actually be ready for a\ntest maybe i'll study hopefully it'll\nhelp\nso i'm not saying don't prepare at all\nbut then there's kind of another angle\nto this which is a little bit more\nalmost spiritual in nature\nso this is a person who's afraid of\ndeath and is missed out on something so\nwhy is writing this important because\nyou have to make up for it if you have\nto make up for it it has to be perfect\nright if i have an f on my transcript i\ncan't afford to get a b because i'm\nalready behind\ni absolutely need an a or even an a plus\nan extra credit\nand so then what happens is my mind is\nunsatisfied with a b unsatisfied with a\nc unsatisfied with a d the only thing\nit'll look for is an a and a guaranteed\na at that\nbecause if i don't get an a and it winds\nup being a b then i'm screwed and i've\nfallen further behind and i had this\nopportunity to make things up and i\ncan't make it up so what does that\nreadiness mean readiness means a\nguarantee of an a\nso if you're afraid of death and you\nneed to make up and you want to live\nlife to the fullest\nwhat readiness means\nis knowing that you will live life to\nthe fullest\nbut that's never going to happen\nso then you get\nstuck and so some people may think i\nwant to live life to the fullest why\ncan't i [ __ ] do anything and it's\nbecause you want to live life to the\nfullest that you can't do anything\nbecause the only thing you're willing to\ndo is when you know you can live life to\nthe fullest so paradoxically it's not\nit it's not like these two things are at\nodds they're one and the same\nbecause how can you go to a party if it\ndoesn't go perfectly how can you go go\nto a party how you've missed out on so\nmany parties so this party that i have\nto go to i need to be confident i need\nto have a good time i need to have an\nanswer i need to say something i can be\nproud of because if i can't say\nsomething i'm going to be proud of i'm\nnot going to have a good time i'm going\nto miss out and then it's just like it's\nall over again i've been traumatized by\nthis once i don't want to do it again\nnever again never again never again\nneeds i need to be ready this party\nneeds to be hype i need to have the best\ntime of my life because i'm 23 years old\nand i've missed two or three years of my\nlife i need to make up for it\nso i want to be ready\nso how do you deal with this\nthis is where we lean on spirituality\nso the first thing to understand is that\nwhen we think about writing this we want\nthings to be good we want things to be\nperfect we don't want things to be\npainful so this is the other thing about\nreadiness readiness is the avoidance of\npain\nat its essence\nbecause when i'm ready i can handle it\nand bad things don't have to happen and\ni can avoid the pain when i can hold my\nhead up high and they ask me what have\nyou been up to\ni can answer freely and speak with pride\ni don't have to lie even if i lie i feel\nguilty on the inside oh my god\nand if i speak the truth it's so shaming\nso do you see i have a choice once i'm\nready i don't have to experience that\nshame i don't have to experience that\nguilt readiness is an antidote to those\nthings it's the avoidance of those\nthings\nbecause when i'm ready like that i have\nnothing to worry about i won't feel any\nanxiety i won't feel any shame i won't\nfeel any guilt\nonce i'm ready\nwhen am i ready to go to the gym when\ni'm ripped\nthen i don't have to feel like i'm out\nof shape i don't have to feel like other\npeople are judging me i don't have to be\nashamed of myself\ni don't have to be pathetic when the\nperson at the gym swipes me in and then\n15 minutes later i leave and they're\nthinking\nthis guy's not cut out for it\nthey're not thinking about you\nbut it doesn't matter right that's what\nyou think\nlike if i was working in a gym i saw\nsomeone come for a little while and then\nleave it's like hey at least they made\nit i've been there\nthere are too many days where i have\nchosen not to go for 15 minutes and just\nstayed at home instead\nand the next day i wish i had gone for\n15 minutes but the 15 minutes is a c\nwe can't have c's because we're so far\nbehind\nso readiness is the avoidance of pain so\nwhat do you do with this\nthe first is on a fundamental spiritual\nlevel if you want to wipe this away root\nand stem\nand leaf and flower all of it understand\nthat life is a totality\nthat part of the experience of life is\npain\nright that's the nature of things like\nif you want to become healthy you're\ngoing to be huffing and puffing for a\nwhile\nlike that's just how it is\nright if i want to get good at a video\ngame i'm going to go in and like get\nowned\nlike i tried pvping for the first time\nlike a week ago in lost ark\nand like got absolutely demolished\nand that's just the price of life that's\nwhat happens like life is going to be a\ntotality life is not perfect\nright life is not all positive\nnow the problem is that society has\ndeveloped in such a way where it deludes\nus into thinking it's all positive\nit deludes us into thinking that like\npure happiness is possible how did this\nhappen because of things like social\nmedia oh my god look at all these people\nout there being so happy\nso if i log into facebook or instagram\nand i see all these posts of people\nhaving a great time i think this is what\nlife is\nright even when we talk about depression\nyou know what what what posts get\nupvoted the most on reddit when people\ntalk about depression\nthey're the ones that are like i kicked\nmy depression's ass\n40 000 upvotes\ni finally stopped letting depression\ntake advantage of me and i cleaned my\nroom here's before and here's after\neven the people struggling with\ndepression are absolute chads\nthere's the way that\nthe good people handle depression\nabsolute chad and then there's me\ni can't even clean like i wish i was\nlike man i wish i had that kind of\ndepression\nbecause like their depression is like\nturning them into a good person it's\nlike look at how like much they're\ngrowing is a human\ni can't even clean my [ __ ]\nsink\nthink about that the triumph of the\nhuman spirit is how we represent\nadversity\nit's not the failure of the human spirit\nthe truth is most of the time it's\nfailure of the human spirit\nthere's a reason why\nthat one post gets upvoted and we have a\nthousand posts about depression is\nkicking my ass in one post about i\nconquered my depression\nright that's why they're stories that's\nwhy they propagate because they're the\nexception\nso readiness is the avoidance of pain\nreadiness is your mind's way of telling\nyou hey if you get ready it doesn't have\nto hurt\nyou don't have to lie anymore\nwell you don't have to lie now it's just\nthe only thing is you're gonna have to\ndeal with a little bit of shame\nso understand that life is both and the\nbig big big irony this is why readiness\nis so [ __ ] paralyzing the big big\nirony is it's the person\nwho looks for readiness to be the\navoidance of pain that never winds up\ndoing anything and is never ready\nthe person who is actually ready is\ndoing the opposite\nthey're the one who's saying you know\nwhat\nis the best i'm gonna do\ni'm never gonna be ready i might as well\ngo\nand that's readiness it's the acceptance\nof pain\nthat life is a totality it's not just\nlike one way\nand you can't escape from that other\npiece\nright that's the other big thing that we\njust like all need to understand is like\nyou just can't escape there's no way to\nescape from the suffering that is life\nthat's what buddha said when he talked\nabout duk\nhe's like there's no pass\nyou can use drugs for a while if you\nwant to not going to fix the problem\nit'll delude you into thinking it\nyou can pretend it doesn't exist by\nspending time on the internet\nyou can look at other people who triumph\nand say oh i want to get to that point\nbut what they don't understand like you\ndon't see the thousand other days before\nmy clean kitchen where i struggled\nwe don't advertise the nasty parts we\ndon't advertise the boring part so we\ngive ourselves a false perception\nso accept life in its totality\nexcept that it's gonna suck except that\nthis is the price you pay you fell\nbehind you were cursed with depression\nbad rng\nthis is the consequence that has nothing\nto do with you\nright you can maybe take some actions\nhere there\nyou spawned with fear of death\ndepression anxiety and agoraphobia\nright you're now 23\nand like you're behind so be it\nonce you accept that life is a totality\nthen like readiness is no longer\nnecessary and you can act\nbecause you don't have to get an a\nyou can get a b a b is still going to\nimprove your average\nright\nand then you can maybe get an a next\ntime\nso you want to live life to the fullest\nbut it's your desire to live life to the\nfullest that keeps you living life why\ndon't you just start [ __ ] living life\nand then you'll get to fullest\neventually but you're never going to\nfind it ahead of time that's the essence\nof it right it's like i want to live\nlife to the fullest like why don't you\njust start living start living halfway\nbro\nor girl\nstart living halfway but that's not\nenough so be it it's never going to be\nenough what is fullest how do you live\nlife to the fullest what does that mean\nlike think about what is this thing that\nyou're chasing i want to live life to\nthe fullest like tell me what is that\nit's not a thing\ndoes it mean going to a party with 15\npeople does it mean going to 15 parties\na week does it mean going to a single\nparty\nit's an unsolvable problem\nstop trying to live life to the fullest\nand just start living life whatever it\nhas to offer\nwhen you start living life whatever it\nhas to offer that's when you get the\nfullness of life because the fullness of\nlife is not just positive the fullness\nof life is pain and pleasure\nthis is why our literature is the way\nthat it is it's not\nyou know\nwe don't have movies about\ni was born rich and every day of my life\nhas been easy and good\nand in the end i win\nthat's not the movie\nthe movie is pain and pleasure together\ntriumph over adversity\naccept both\nthat's how you live life to the fullest\nshooting for just the pleasure that's\nnot life to the fullest that's half of\nlife\nyou're afraid of living half of life and\nthat causes you to live half of\nlife you're afraid you want to live life\nto the fullest and you're living half a\nlife instead live life\nlive half the life and you'll live a\nlife of fullness\nwhatever it has to offer\ntake it\nthat's like literally that's life\nso i'm gonna leave y'all with\nkind of a spiritual scripture this is\ni guess you could call it it's called a\nprayer it's not really a prayer\nso the concept of prayer is like a\nwestern thing sort well it's not just a\nwestern thing but it's not really a\nprayer so this is a segment it's it's a\nset of sutras from one of the upanishads\nof the hindu tradition\nand people turned it into a prayer but\nreally it's like an explanation of\nthings it's like science more than\nspirituality you're not asking for\nanything\nyou're not beseeching anyone\nso it's not like that but people use it\nas a prayer but it's really like it's a\nnugget of wisdom that people will chant\nand will meditate on\num\neva\nthere's a hole\nlike not h-o-l-e like they're the hole\nw-h-o-l-e\nyou can take a piece\nout of the hole\nand the hole still remains whole\ninterestingly enough the hole is still\nrepresented within the piece\nthe hole is not diminished by removing a\npiece from it\nright so you guys don't need to chant\nthat thing but i want you all to really\nthink about the next time you meditate\nso as you do a formal meditation\npractice think a little bit about the\ntotality of life what is life just look\naround and observe use the full of your\nfocus to observe and ask yourself what\nthe is this\nyou're so afraid of death like forget\nabout death like start figuring out life\nwhy are you so concerned about death\nlike forget about death\nwhat you need to figure out is what\nyou're doing here\nso what is the totality of life\nthink about it\nwhat does life have to offer\nand hopefully you'll understand that in\nlife there's just\nit\nand any kind of\npositive you try to create out of it\nwill create a negative on the flip side\nany tried and a kind of negative that\nyou experience will also have a positive\nthat's just how it works\nif i split a neutron i don't just get a\nproton or i don't just get an electron\ni get a proton and an electron\nright if i break a cookie in half i'm\ngonna get two equal pieces like there's\njust no way that you can get one plus\none equals three it's just not possible\nand life is the same way\nall pain has pleasure associated with it\nall pleasure has pain associated with it\nand if you disagree with that you could\ndisagree with that logically if you want\nto whatever\nbut experience it\nright and people will say but all i\nexperience is pain i don't experience\npleasure well that's because you're not\nthere yet\nthat's been my experience anyway\nso i've come to understand the wisdom of\nof the sutra\nand it's like it's staggering and will\nbe transformative if you ever get it\nquestion\nokay this is a great question\nwhat does it mean to\nnot be there yet\nwhat it means to be not there yet\nis a false understanding of how things\nwork because there is no yet and there\nis no there\nthose are both conceptions of the mind\nall that exists is what is\nand all that exists is here\nso you will never\ni will i'm not there yet is not\nsomething to even think about in its\ntrue sense i realize i just said that\nbut that's the honest answer so if you\nunderstand\nthat\nif you understand that what you'll\nrealize is there's no there and there's\nno yet\nthere's only what you do today\nright there's only where you are now are\nyou at the gym\nno\nokay so go there\nright be here do the thing\nthat's life do that over and over and\nover and over and over again then you\nwill be living life to the fullest it's\nthat simple it's hard\nbut it's simple\ndoes this lesson sort of relate to just\nyolo through life sort of\nright what is yolo\nyola is carpe diem\nso like i don't think so i think the\nproblem here is that sometimes remember\nhow we were saying that\nthe mind will infuse itself into\nwhatever it\nperceives\nright so if i'm anorexic and i think i'm\noverweight i'm gonna assume that other\npeople think i look fat\nthe challenge with the yolo carpe diem\ncrowd\nis that oftentimes there is some kind of\nlike subtle emotional or physical need\nthat they will then use this philosophy\nto be an [ __ ]\nright so like i don't want to feel\nguilty i don't want to care about other\npeople so i'm just going to yolo it\ni don't want to prepare so i'm going to\nyolo yolo has become synonymous\nfor forget about consequences\nbut\nmost people who yolo are not like don't\nbehave the same way as enlightened folks\nit's in fact oftentimes they're very\nopposite\ni don't know if that kind of makes sense\nto y'all but it's like it's a very\nimportant distinction so there's a\ndifference between yoloing\nand like acting yolo\nand in acting yolo suppressing all of\nthe negativity that you have\nthat's a false yolo\nright so generally like sometimes they\ncan look similar\nyou got to be really careful about\nwhat's on the inside\nright does that make sense\ndon't do the yolo be the yellow yeah\nright so sometimes because like let's\nthink about you only live once so what's\nthat for right that\nthat's an excuse to get away with crap\ndo you all see that it's like such a\nsubtle excuse for the slippery ass mind\nyou only live once\nguess i might as well not do that\nproject\nyou only live once\ni don't need to text this person back\nyou only live once guess i'm gonna eat\npizza seven days a week\nright\nlike that's not\nand by the way you know for the record\nthe meditative tradition does not\nbelieve that you only live once\nright\nso i mean like in general i think that\nsees the day is a good idea right that's\nsome of the sentiment behind yolo that's\ngood like take\nenjoy every day to its fullest that i\nagree with\nbut don't try to maximize the fullness\nlike the enjoyment of every day that's\nwhat a lot of yolo people do and in\ndoing so they actually like\nlive a life of hedonism\nis this similar to the performance mode\ngifted kids usually rely on\nsort of yeah i mean i think there's a\nlot of overlap so i think falling behind\nneeding to be ready\nyou know being unable to not get an a\nall of those things are relevant to\ngifted kids for sure\nyou"
