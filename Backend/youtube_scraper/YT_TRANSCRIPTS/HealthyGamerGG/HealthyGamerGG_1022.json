    "transcript": "there's a reason why we end up in these\nsituations we're not looking we're not\nrunning around trying to be\ndisrespectful to ourselves at the end of\nthe day self-respect is about\nwho controls your happiness in life so\nwhether you're happy or unhappy\nis dependent on her kissing you cuddling\nyou then blocking you for five months\nwithout any kind of explanation is not\nan acceptable thing to do as a boyfriend\ngirlfriend or friend\nit's not an acceptable way to behave as\na human being the truth of the matter is\nthat sometimes we're sort of not starved\nfor affection but like addicted\nor have some kind of really important\nemotional need met by another human\nbeing so how the hell do you have\nself-respect like where does\nself-respect even come from what is it\n[Music]\nshe unblocked me after almost five\nmonths\nhi everyone my year-long friendship has\nended about five months ago\ni thought we fit perfectly same\ninterests the same sense of humor and\nsimilar life goals\nwe used to spend almost every weekend\ntogether going out watching movies and\ncooking together this was easily the\nbest relationship i have ever had\nfast forward to five months ago this\nentire breakup situation lasted about a\nweek\nit all started with her giving me mixed\nsignals flirting wanting me to stay\nlonger staying overnight touching\nkissing cuddling you choose\nafter one of our cuddling sessions after\ni came back home she sent me a wall of\ntext saying that everything between us\nwas wrong and that we shouldn't have\ndone that and we are better off cutting\nall contact\nafter that she blocked me literally\neverywhere\nwhatsapp snapchat facebook phone number\ni was devastated to say the least\nspent countless hours crying not eating\nanything and skipping my workouts\nstarted to look like a zombie lost 15\nkgs of weight in a month\nand lost interest in anyone and\neverything\nit took me two months to start doing\nstuff\nit's been three months since then and i\nwas desperately trying to forget her but\nwell that didn't work\nshe has been in my head every day for\nthe duration of these five months both\ndaily and at night\ni learned how to live without her sort\nof and accepted the fact that we will\nnever meet or talk again fast forward to\nyesterday i saw that she unblocked me\neverywhere\nfirst i thought it might have been an\naccident but there are way too many\nsteps to unblock someone for it to be\nrandom i couldn't resist and texted her\nyesterday didn't get any response\nbut she didn't block me again so i guess\nmy theory of randomness has been\ndebunked\ni'm pretty much sure she has seen the\nmessage because she was online a couple\nof times during the day\nshould i wait and hope\nshe will eventually answer i think you\ndon't unblock someone after such time\nfor no reason am i right i really want\nit to work out again because i i know i\nhaven't done everything perfectly in the\npast\nthis whole situation just confuses me\nand doesn't let me function normally\nalrighty\nso we're gonna go to the comments a\nlittle bit\nso top comment have some self respect\nif she wants to talk to you she will\ndon't build your identity around someone\nwho discards you when it's good for her\nbeing desperate is repelling\nokay\num\nhey her name do you want to talk about\nthings between us life is shirt short\ni'm well assured\nokay\nso\ntwo options right one is have some\nself-respect\nso what i want to talk to you all about\ntoday\nis how does one develop self-respect\nwhat does that even mean right because\nwe find ourselves in this situation\nunfortunately\nand like when you say have some\nself-respect like it's such a\ndamning judgment right\nso like let's start by understanding\nthat\nthere's a reason why we end up in these\nsituations we're not looking we're not\nrunning around trying to be\ndisrespectful to ourselves the truth of\nthe matter is that\nsometimes we form relationships with\npeople\nand that this relationship can feel\namazing it's the best relationship i've\never had like i connect with this person\nthe truth of the matter is that\nsometimes we're sort of not starved for\naffection but like addicted\nor have some kind of really important\nemotional need met by another human\nbeing\nwe can feel loved we can feel enjoyable\nwe can feel like oh my god this is\namazing i enjoy spending every moment\nwith this person\nthat's not a lack of self-respect\nright that's like being in love\nthat's not a bad thing\nand then\nsomething can happen you know this\nperson blocks you after sending you\nmixed signals and stuff that sounds\nquite traumatic\nand when we get something pulled away\nfrom us dramatically like when something\nis really great in my life and i really\nenjoy hanging out with this person we\nwatch movies there's also kissing\ncuddling like it's moving in the right\ndirection i'm getting a little bit\nexcited like where is this going to go\nlike i'm not really sure\nand then suddenly like this person is\ntaken out of our life and we've been\nwith this person for a year like they've\nbeen our best friend for a year it's\nabsolutely traumatic and we always want\nto like go back to\nwhat we've lost right and this is not\nsomething i mean this person isn't\npathetic or anything like that i really\ndon't believe that\nbecause you have you know kids who do\nthis with parents all the time where\nparent is withholding of affection\ndoesn't tell my kid i i love you or you\nknow we have the typical asian parents\nno racial offense here but i really\nrecently stumbled upon\nasian parent subreddit\nbut you know there are a lot of stories\nin there about like parents who withhold\naffection unless you get a pluses and\nare the smartest kid in the class\nand despite the fact that these people\nhurt us\nwe are wired to try to get them back to\ntry to win them over\nso it's like it's a reasonable situation\nto be in\nbut you know there's something that kind\nof like resonates with like have some\nself-respect\nso we can say that right i'm not saying\ni mean that was the up top comment the\nother comment was good too it's like hey\ntry to talk to her try to resolve things\nright like communicate\nthat's what we do at hg\nwe engage with our problems\nbut then the problem is that like no one\never tells you like how do you get\nself-respect\nright have some self-respect it's like\noh\n[ __ ] i forgot to pick oh let me like go\nto home depot\nand pick that pick up oh yeah\nself-respect where can i find oh i'll\ntoo let me go pick that up okay now i've\ngot it easy done fixed saved\nso how the hell do you have self-respect\nlike where does self-respect even come\nfrom what is it\nokay\nso the first thing to understand is that\nwhen you're in a situation like this and\npeople say have some self-respect\nunderstand what your emotional needs are\nwhich are like completely legit\nokay just like you met this person and\nshe's is it a she i'm not even sure\nlet's assume heteronormative for a\nsecond i think we did right\nyeah she unblocked me okay\nso\nlike that's normal for you to want that\nright you want everything that you've\nhad before\nso\nwhen we don't when we when we lack\nself-respect what we tend to end up\ndoing in in essence what a lack of\nself-respect is\nis chasing after happiness from another\nhuman being\nat the cost of ourselves\nso we're looking from a benefit\nfor a benefit from another person\nand we are willing to sacrifice our\ndignity to get that benefit\nright so like i'm willing to do whatever\nit takes to get this job i will do your\ndry cleaning i will take out your trash\ni will on i will plunge your toilet for\nyou if you need to\nwhatever it takes to win you over\nso we sacrifice of ourselves\nto get\nhappiness from another person\nand so why do we call this a lack of\nself respect because now this person is\nthinking oh she unblock me let me\nmessage her should i do this should i do\nthis should i do this and what it is is\nthis person is addicted to what the\nother person provides\nright so they're willing to debase\nthemselves i'll message her again i mean\nthey're not willing to do this right\nbecause it sounds like they sent one\nmessage\nthey're being very introspective they're\nreaching out for help they're doing\neverything right this is actually really\nawesome\nbut when we think about the classic\nperson who has no self-respect and comes\ncrawling back\nright because she really hurt you what\nshe did was not okay like\nkissing you cuddling you then blocking\nyou for five months without any kind of\nexplanation is not an acceptable thing\nto do as a boyfriend girlfriend or\nfriend\nit's not an acceptable way to behave as\na human being\nshe may have been feeling anxious she\nmay have been feeling confused and all\nthat kind of good stuff\nso generally speaking when people say\nhave some self-respect what they're\npointing out is that you're letting\nother people mistreat you you're letting\nother people do things that are\nunacceptable and you are not holding\nthem accountable\nwhy don't we hold them accountable\nbecause we want what they're selling\ni want to see those movies again i want\nto cuddle again i want to talk again i\nwant my partner back i want my best\nfriend back\nand so i'm willing to sacrifice\nwhatever it takes to get them back\nthat's when your self-respect goes\nso what is self-respect how do you get\nit\nso right now you're willing to sacrifice\nyourself to get happiness from outside\nof you and without that happiness from\noutside of you you're going to feel\nalone you're going to feel hungry\nright because you don't have all of\nthose things\nso self-respect is actually choosing\npain\nself-respect is saying that you know\nwhat\ni'm not going to let myself have her\nagain\nright i'm going to give her up like she\nblocked me but i have held on to her and\nwe sort of see this because it is like i\nhaven't been able to get her out of my\nthoughts\nyou don't get her out of her your\nthoughts you give her up or you let her\nlive there rent free for a while and you\njust tolerate it\nright she's living there rent-free and\nyou're just like okay i'm not going to\ntry to give her up this is the price\nthat i pay for getting attached to her\ni think this is the the issue is that at\nthe end of the day self-respect is about\nwho controls your happiness in life and\nwhen you surrender that control to\nanother human being even if you're\naddicted to it i can understand\nright when you're addicted to the\nhappiness that she provides and you\nlet her dictate the terms of the\nrelationship\nwhat you're doing is you're putting your\nhappiness in her hands\nso whether you're happy or unhappy\nis dependent on her there's still a\nchoice there and it's does she message\nyou back or does she not message you\nback\nso you're surrendering that control and\nthat's when other people when when one\nhuman scene sees another human being\nsurrender their self-control that's when\nthey tell them to have some self-respect\nso how do you get your self-respect you\ntake that control back\nwhy is it hard to take that control back\nbecause oftentimes taking that control\nback comes with pain\ni'm not saying that you should block her\nbut you tell yourself i'm not going to\nmessage her again\nright whatever it is you take control of\nthe relationship\nyou take control of your own feelings\neven if it means choosing the painful\nroute\nso like when we think about the phrase\ndignity\nright like to live with dignity is to\nnot\nis oftentimes\nto choose things that are painful\nright so if someone comes up to me and\nsays i'll pay you 10 million dollars if\nyou let me take a picture of your\nscrotum\nand it's like i'm gonna say no but\nthey're like what about the benefit\nthat's exactly the point is that the\nbenefit can be whatever it is\ni am choosing to keep control over my\nlife\na smart bad example what a terrible idea\nright my point is like\ndon't like turn down the money right\nlike whatever it is turn down the\nhappiness like you should retain control\nof yourself even if it means\na path of pain\nright so like when you choose to act\nin accordance with your values and you\nsay like i like even if it's my choice\neven if it hurts it's my choice\nand so the challenge here is that like\nyou've got a choice you can either give\nher up or you can give yourself up and\nthat's fundamentally what a lack of\nself-respect is\nit's when you give yourself up for the\nsake of another person you surrender\nyour happiness to like her texts whether\nshe texts you or not determines whether\nyou're happy or not\nand then we say like that's a lack of\nself-respect so how do you stop that you\ntake control\ntaking control means giving her up\nright so do you want to have do you do\nyou deserve\nthis is where the self-respect comes\nfrom because if you respect yourself\ndo you deserve someone who will treat\nyou this way or do you deserve someone\nbetter\nbecause\nif you let someone mistreat you and you\nthink of yourself as low then that's\nokay\nbut if you deserve better\nthen you're gonna move on because that's\nthe end of it but i want her i miss her\nokay\nso what\nbut it'll hurt to not have her\nokay\nso it'll hurt accept it\nthat's life\nthat's what living life with dignity is\ndignity comes with pain doesn't come\nwith pleasure people who seek pleasure\ndon't\nlead dignified lives\nquite the opposite\nright when we're chasing dopamine or\ndrugs or materialistic things or the\nrespect of random people on the internet\nright when we chase after those things\nand we'll do whatever it takes to get\nother people to like us that is the\ndegradation of self-respect when you\nplay someone else's val opinions and\nview of yourself above your own and so\nyou say i'll do whatever it takes to get\nyou to like me then you lose your\nself-respect\nand so why is it hard to get\nself-respect because you have to pay the\nprice of other people not liking you\nyou have to give up whatever the [ __ ]\nthis was that you had with this girl\nwhich i still don't understand what that\nwas\nright it sounded like a friendship that\nwas turning into a romantic relationship\nshe doesn't know how to communicate this\nis where like i don't disagree with the\nsecond person who's like you know give\nher a chance to talk which i think is\nfine\nif that's really what you want to do but\nyou need to be centered before you have\nthat conversation man\nyou need to be prepared to reject her\nbefore you have that conversation\nyou need to be prepared to hold her\naccountable for her actions\nbecause if you don't do that\nthen\nyou're signing yourself up for this all\nover again\nbecause unless there's accountability\nfor her actions and i know this is like\na man talking about a woman but it\ndefinitely goes both ways or\nhomosexually or whatever\none human to another\nif someone treats you wrong in a\nrelationship you need to be prepared to\nhold them accountable and if you don't\nhold them accountable don't expect the\nbehavior to change\nand so then like you know you're gonna\ncome groveling back like\nyou know i understand why you do it i\ndon't think less of you for doing it by\nthe way which i know sounds weird he's\nlike that's a need that we have right\nwe're addicted to that love we're\naddicted to that warmth we really want\nit so bad that we're willing to\nsacrifice anything that doesn't mean\nthat we're pathetic that just means that\nthat's a\nsome damn addictive\nrelationship stuff there right so we\nneed to respect that as external\nobservers we need to respect that this\nperson's choice is actually very hard\nit's easy for me to say help some\nself-respect moon\nwhen i'm not the one that was cuddling\nwith her right\ni'm not the one that was watching movies\nwith her i don't know any of that\nbenefit i watching movies\nso we're all willing to debase ourselves\nfor like some of that sweet sweet\nwhatever the hell that is\nso have some compassion for randoms on\nthe internet who are like making bad\nchoices right it's not easy to make\nwhy do people make bad choices because\nthey're easy\nthat's why we make the bad choices\nbecause they're the easier choice\nwell we're going to blame these people\nfor making bad choices we're making them\nright and left center all the time\nso how do you get resp self-respect it's\nsimple\nchoose the path of pain give things up\nif they don't make you behave in a way\nthat you are comfortable with\ndon't let people mistreat you\neven if\nthey're like crack cocaine\nright and that's like literally what we\nsee with like drug addicts is that they\nwill be willing to debase themselves to\nget that next fix\nand that's just a drug what if it's like\nlove and cuddling and movies like holy\ncrap man\nthat's just not a hit of dopamine that's\nlike\nfeeling loved y'all that's what this\nperson has to give up\nthat's the price of self-respect\nso it's a hard choice to make don't get\nme wrong\nhow do you make it you recognize that\nthis is not the way that do you deserve\nto be treated this way yes or no because\nif you respect yourself the answer to\nthat question is yes\nand if i'm sorry you don't deserve to be\ntreated that way then the answer to that\nquestion is no if you respect yourself\nright i do not deserve to be treated\nthis way then you have to have the balls\nor the ovaries\nor whatever you're going out of choices\nto hold that person accountable and\nholding that person accountable\nsometimes means giving her up\ndoes it mean blocking her if sure if\nthat's what you need to do\ndoes it mean a conversation sure\ndoes it mean a conversation where you\nsay hey by the way what you did was kind\nof [ __ ] up\nit really hurt me a lot\ni'm incredibly angry with you\noh i'm sorry\nhow can i make it up to you invent a\ntime machine go back in time and don't\ndo it\nbut i can't do that yeah the hurt that\nyou set my way is irreparable it's done\nright like\nlike not all hurts can be repaired\nso like look people are saying bass\nsigma chad move look y'all it's it's\njust respect yourselves right\ndon't let people mistreat you don't\nblame yourself if you let people\nmistreat you that's an important point\nbecause i understand that if you let\npeople mistreat you there's got to be a\ndamn good reason human being\nself-respect is a natural state of\nthings\nright but like\ndude come on man like\nfor those of y'all that don't treat\nyourself with respect\ni don't know how old this person is\nbut like do y'all i mean i\ni remember what it was like to be 21 i\nremember what it was like to be 24. i\nremember what it was like to be 27.\nyou're not like that high level yet so\nyou're going to be making these mistakes\nit's okay to make these mistakes\nright that self-respect comes with time\nit comes with sacrifice really\nbecause it's it's it's like it's really\npowerful to say to someone like to give\nsomething up like i cannot if you guys\nwant to talk about meditation\nwe'll talk about fasting\nso like to give something up is the\nfirst step to self-respect this is why\nfasting is a thing in religious\ntraditions multiple reasons but that's\none of them i think what started to\nhappen is people have lost sight of why\nwe fast to begin with\nshe's like i'm gonna like give something\nup for lent for example in the catholic\nchurch like the whole it's not like okay\ni'm gonna get like we're not gonna eat\nfish for a month so like let's just eat\nlots of other delicious food no that's\nlike missing the point the whole point\nis self-deprivation the whole point is i\nwant this thing and i'm not going to\nhave it\nthe whole point is that i choose what\ni do\nand i'm not going to let the temptation\nof an external substance\nusually talk about food\nright with fasting\ndictate my life and is it gonna suck\nsure is it gonna be less tasty yes\nabsolutely\nso what"
