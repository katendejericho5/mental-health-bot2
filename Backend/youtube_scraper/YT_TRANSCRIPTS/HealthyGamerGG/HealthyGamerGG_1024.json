    "transcript": "if he's not going to make the right\nchoices or refuses to make choices if\nhe's not willing to give sobriety a shot\nif he's not willing to give therapy a\nshot like if he's just like\nlike basically turning the hourglass day\nafter day after day hoping that\nsomething will get\nbetter and then you decide that this is\nnot the person that you want to be with\nlike i think that's totally fine\nand then when you do break up with him\nand he says oh like i knew like you're\ntoo good for me and\nlike you can say like do you want to\nhear why i'm breaking up with you like\nwhat my reasons are my reasons are what\nyou choose to do\nhas nothing to do with your looks has\nnothing to do with you being a man-child\nor anything like that like all the\npsychological crap it's just how you\nchoose to spend your time\nso my partner says that he will be\nmiserable in every job he works he ever\nworks my 25f partner 27m\nsays that he will be miserable in every\njob he ever gets and it's working that\nmakes him anxious and miserable\nhe's currently working a service desk\njob he hates that gives him constant\nanxiety and panic attacks\nhe feels trapped because he believes\nthat quitting will be taking a step\nbackwards and staying he will hate his\nlife\nhe feels behind in life and has said\nmany times that he feels like a child in\nan adult's body who isn't ready for the\nresponsibility of being full grown\ni sympathize him and understand work\nanxiety i used to get\nget a lot of it myself\nhe's currently seeing a therapist but he\nthinks it's not working and she's not\nunderstanding his issue he feels\nmisunderstood and issue and the issue\nisn't being solved\ni've told him it takes time to find a\ntherapist who works for you but he\ndoesn't believe me and thinks that no\namount of therapy will help him\nhe clearly has severe anxiety and\ndepression but refuses professional help\nokay\nhe currently uses video games and weed\nas an almost constant escape from his\nlife if he's not higher playing a game\nhe's stressing out about work and\nfalling feeling behind in life i love\nhim and want him to feel happy again but\nit's so hard when it feels like there's\nnothing i can say to comfort him or give\nhim advice\nand he thinks that getting professional\nhelp would be useless\nhe's stubborn and won't take steps to\nget better because he's convinced his\nlife will be [ __ ] no matter what he does\nit's also really making me question my\nfuture with him if he feels like he\ncan't hold a job and he often says i'd\nbe better off without him i really need\nsome help here and i'm posting to see if\nif i can get opini any opinions from the\ncommunity\nnothing i'm doing is helping him and i\nfeel helpless to improve his life\nso this unfortunately is an increasingly\ncommon situation where\nwe've got one partner who's kind of\nstuck\nand the other partner like really cares\nabout them loves them a lot you know has\nbeen in this relationship we're not\nreally sure how long\nbut oftentimes is committed to trying to\nmake this relationship where can you\nlove this person you care this person so\nyou want to help them\nnow oftentimes when you see these posts\non the internet what you'll sort of get\nis like dump them and move on right like\nthat's sort of the sentiment that most\nof the internet internet is quick to\njudge\nquick to abandon people quick to like\nyou do you right and sometimes that\nthat's that's\nnot uh honestly it's not a bad option\nlike there when we'll kind of get to\nthat\nbut the truth is like we should try to\nmeet the person where they're at right\nso if someone comes onto into our\ncommunity or just anywhere else on the\ninternet one of the things that i try to\ndo is just like meet people where\nthey're at so the first thing is if this\nperson has said i want to try to help my\npartner how can i do that\nit's not our place to say dump his ass\nand move on right it's like if that's\nwhat you want that's what we're going to\ntry to help you do\nand in my experience supporting people\nwho want to try to help their partner\nit's through\na very\nsincere effort to help your partner and\nwhen you've tried everything and fail\nthat's when sometimes it's time to move\non and actually i think that that's like\na healthy way to move on right because\nthen you're not feeling like you abandon\nthem you're not feeling like you didn't\nlike you know you were mean\nyou can leave that relationship sort of\nwith a clear head and like a clear heart\nbecause you've done everything within\nyour power but unfortunately you can't\nfix another human being so i'm a huge\nfan of not giving up on people\nand also like doing everything that you\ncan but also recognizing that like\nthere's a difference between giving up\non people\nand doing everything and then sort of\nrecognizing that like you've done\neverything that you can and there's\nnothing else to do so you're not giving\nup on them it's just like they need to\ndo the rest of it\nso what i'd like to do is first talk a\nlittle bit about the boyfriend's\nsituation based on what we've heard\nlet's try to understand what this person\nis going through because i think\nsometimes people in our community are in\nthe same situation right i've got a\ndead-end job i hate it it gives me\nanxiety\ni'm behind so i can't quit but i can't\nstay because i'm miserable\npeople tell me to go see a therapist and\ni see a therapist but it doesn't seem to\nbe helping and so it's sort of like and\ni'm smoking weed and playing games all\nday right like so it's sort of like i'm\nstuck like i can't improve my life but i\ncan't take a step back i can't quit i\ncan't get a break i'm using certain\ncoping mechanisms because nothing else\nis going and like that's the only thing\nthat's keeping me from like exploding\ninternally\nright so this is a really challenging\nsituation to be in\nso let's try to first understand like\nwhat the partner is experiencing so if\nwe sometimes if we equip no uh the the\nyou know the girlfriend with knowledge\nabout what her partner could be\nexperiencing we'll sort of set her up to\nbetter support her partner then we'll\ntalk a little bit about you know what\nyou can do as a partner\nand the last thing that we're going to\ntalk a little bit about is like how to\nhave conversations about leaving\nright so this relationship may not work\nout because it takes two to make a\nrelationship work out and we're not\njumping to that that option we're not\nsaying that you should have that\nconversation now but i think that\nthere are healthy ways to have\nconversations\nmoving towards a breakup\nand the reason i call them healthy is\nbecause the reason we have those\nconversations it's not that you decide\nto break up with this person it's that\nyou have a conversation where you signal\nto this person hey this relationship is\nnot really working for me this is what\ni'm trying to do to fix it this is what\ni need you to do to try to fix it\nand sort of how to have a breakup in a\nway that you know like in a sense\nprotects you not protect you but like\nthat you can kind of feel good about\nyourself and also can give your partner\nsome feedback so that hopefully even\nwith the breakup you're sort of helping\nthem move forward in their life okay\nso let's start by trying to understand\nthe partner\nso let's go through a couple of things\nthat\nwe're sort of noticing about the partner\nokay\nthe first is that he's 27\nhe feels like he's fallen behind\nokay what are the other relevant\nrelevant details that you all think\nabout\nwhat have you all kind of pointed out\nokay what have you all noticed\nokay so someone's saying mindset\nso how do y'all think okay so they've\ngot work anxiety very good\nokay substance use to cope weed\nself cred so the mindset we're going to\nrefer to is self-criticism\nokay\nso fallen behind\ntrapped\nokay therapist isn't working very good\nokay we've got some five head stuff over\nhere\nlearned helplessness\nright\nokay\ngood\ni like this one suicidal\nbut not really suicidal\nbrilliantly said\nright\nokay uh cycle of self-fulfilling placebo\nso we're going to include that over here\nthat's correct we're going to talk about\nthat self\nokay\nright so there's\nself-loathing\nokay excellent so i think this is pretty\ngood like you all are doing really good\nso i don't know if you'll notice this\nbut we're changing what dr k is doing\nso dr k used to just list all this stuff\nout right and then i'd walk you through\nit\nbut now what are we doing\nwe're asking chat and chat is finding a\nlot of the right answers look who's\nlearning chat good job\nokay this is everything that i have on\nmy list and even more\nall right\nso let's talk a little bit about what's\ngoing on\nso\nthe first thing to understand is they\nsaid that they have crippling anxiety\nand panic attacks\nokay\nand then this causes them\nto want to quit work\nbut if they quit work they're going to\nfall behind\nbe a child\netc you all see that\nso how do we fix this\nright so this is where presumably\ntherapy helps we'll talk about that in a\nsecond but what do you all think\nah someone's been paying attention very\ngood\nthe culprit here i mean i don't really\nknow right so once again we're not going\nto diagnose and treat things but we're\ngoing to teach all some information if i\nhad to say there's one big problem\nthat needs to be fixed if you're in this\nsituation it's the weed\nso this is where this is something\nthat's kind of unusual so a lot of\npeople will use marijuana\nfor medication for anxiety right so\nthey'll use it as like\nself-medication for anxiety\nbut there are two things\nthat weed can cause that is kind of\ninteresting because we'll also use it as\na medication for nausea in cancer\ntreatment\nso\nthere are two big problems with using\nweed on a daily basis the first is that\nit can cause something called rebound\nanxiety that's the a plus student\nsecond thing rare thing is it can cause\nsomething called cyclic vomiting\nsyndrome\nwe're not going to talk too much about\ncyclic vomiting syndrome this person\nshould be glad that they don't have it\nbut\nwhen we see a lot of chronic weed use\nthe funny thing is that it actually\ncauses like this this rebound anxiety\nthat's really really bad so the\ninteresting thing is that a lot of\npeople will use weed to treat their\nanxiety because it's the only thing that\nhelps them feel good but then once the\nweird weed fairs wears off the anxiety\ncomes back sometimes even stronger than\nthe original thing that you were\ntreating and the more chronic your\nanxiety use\nthe greater the chances that you're\ngoing to develop this sort of like\nrebound anxiety for\nwith with weed so i know it sounds kind\nof weird but like if they want to have a\nbetter time at work what they really\nneed to do is probably stop the wheat\nmore than anything else\nthey're also weed has all kinds of\nnegative effects on motivation\nand also habit formation\nokay if you guys want more information\nlike\nwe have a video on our our youtube\nchannel about\nsmoking weed like in watching\nmotivational videos are you someone who\nsmokes weed every day and watches\nmotivational videos on youtube there's\nalso a whole section on rebound anxiety\nand dr k's guide but the key point here\nis that we develop a dependence on a\nsubstance to treat anxiety when the\nsubstance wears off the anxiety comes\nback twice as bad\nso the other problem with weed as we\nmentioned is that like it prevents you\nfrom or it makes it harder for you to\nform good positive habits and make\nsubstantial positive changes in in your\nlife so the first thing to understand is\nlike as long as your partner is smoking\nweed on a daily basis\nchances are that is making all of these\nthings worse\nright so this is where like once again\nfrom a treatment perspective so your\npartner may not be willing to give up\nweed and like that's their choice right\nbut like for you to understand what role\nthe weed is having now the video games\nmay also be playing a similar role but i\nthink less so than the marijuana or at\nleast we have less evidence from a\nneuroscience perspective from a clinical\nperspective\nyou know i don't know that video games\ncause a physiologic rebound anxiety that\nis like really really profound generally\nspeaking people who play video games a\nlot can sometimes be more anxious\nabsolutely but that sounds\nyou know like i just don't think it's as\npowerful an effect of an effect as we\ndoes\nnow the second thing\nthat someone pointed out is that your\npartner says that therapy doesn't work\nso people have heard of something called\nthe placebo effect which is when\nmy belief about something\ncreates a physiologic benefit so it's\nsort of like a psychological\nfrom\nan inert\nsubstance this is what we call placebo\nit doesn't necessarily have to be inert\nbut basically if i believe something\nwill make me better\nit will actually like physiologically\nmake me better\nthe interesting thing that we talk less\nabout is there's something called the\nnocebo effect which is essentially the\nopposite of the placebo effect which\nif i\nbelieve something won't work\nit actually won't work\nokay\nso we see this actually a lot as\ntherapists where some people like don't\nbelieve in therapy oh therapy isn't\nright for me i don't need therapy\ntherapy can't fix my problems so people\ncome in with this attitude\nchances are that the the therapeutic\neffect of the therapy will actually be\nreduced\nso the good news is that hopefully most\ntherapists are trained to actually deal\nwith this right like i get a ton of\npeople in my office\nwho don't think that therapy will work\nfor them so like i mean not nowadays but\nlike back when i was working at a\nresidential addiction treatment facility\nvery common occurrence\ni get someone who's there for an alcohol\naddiction and i asked them okay so what\nbrings here well\nmy partner said that if i don't come\nhere they're gonna divorce me\noh okay like what\nso do you have a problem with alcohol do\nyou not have a problem oh i don't have a\nproblem with alcohol i don't need your\nhelp i don't need anyone's help this is\njust something i'm doing to save my\nmarriage so i'd hear that kind of thing\na lot so it's like oh okay so like you\nknow if there's nothing that we can do\nto help you and you're just here for 30\ndays to save your marriage that's\ntotally fine is there's like something\nproductive we can work on right so like\nin order to make your partner your\nhusband or your wife happy you have to\nmeet with me three times a week for an\nhour so what are we gonna do like you\nwant me to bring a deck of cards\nlike you're here right so like what is\nthere anything we can work on\nso you kind of start to talk to them a\nlittle bit oh well like you know like\nyou know everything in my life is great\nokay like any work related stress any of\nthese problems those problems you want\nto talk about like you know marital\nstress and conflict oh yeah like it's\nreally hard like my wife is really not\nunderstanding oh tell me about that like\nwhat's it like having a wife who doesn't\nunderstand you what's it like having a\nwife who listens oh it sucks it's\nterrible i hate it it's like she doesn't\nlisten tell me more about that oh my god\nthat sounds awful man wow\nyou know so it's it's kind of like you\ncan get there\nright but and hopefully your therapists\nare trained at that\nso like you know you could you can get\nthere and then suddenly like you know\nthey're coming in and they're like oh\nman so like how this had that meeting\nwith your wife go on thursday oh it was\nlike you know it actually went better\nthan expected oh really tell me about\nthat well you know this happened this\nhappened this time wow that's awesome\ndude it sounds like you're really like\nyou know\nlistening to her a little bit better and\nable better to communicate i know that\nyou're only here to save your marriage\nbut what do you think about like\nlearning some communication skills over\nthe next two or three weeks maybe\npatching things up so that you know\nnot only is she happy that you did your\n30 days of rehab but you know after that\nlike hopefully y'all can build some kind\nof positivity while you're here what do\nyou think about that okay we can give it\na shot i'm here anyway shrug\nright so you can do that\nso the key thing though is that like you\nknow if your partner or you yourself\ndon't believe that therapy can help you\nyou have to understand\nthat\nthis is going to like negatively impact\nyour therapy and if you're if you have a\npartner who you're encouraging to\ntherapy and they don't think that it'll\nhelp them\nlike you have to understand that like if\nyou don't believe that therapy will help\nyou it will actually have a\nscientifically less\nimpactful\neffect now hopefully you have a good\ntherapist\nwho will like win over your your partner\nright or like win over the person who's\ncoming to their office demonstrate to\nthem what the value is\nbut\nisn't that sort of like gaslighting no\nnot really so there's a huge difference\nso gaslighting is\ntricking someone into believing\nsomething is false okay\nthe whole the way you trick someone into\nbelieving therapy is that you give them\nvalue from therapy\nthat they were not expecting\nright and then you change their mind so\ni'd say it's not like gaslight\ngaslighting at all i'd say the best\nanalogy is like oh hey like try this\nlike the sandwich is really good you\nshould really try it no i don't like\nsandwiches i don't like it well take a\nbite\nright even if you don't like it like oh\ni know you don't like it just take a\nbite you take a bite you're like oh\nthat's actually pretty good you just get\nthem to try it right and then they can\nform their own opinions if they can't\nfind value from it they can't find value\nfrom it but it's my job as a therapist\nto try to like\ndemonstrate the value that i bring\nespecially when someone's coming like\nbecause they're coming right they're\nthere to get help so the first thing\nthat i've got to do is convince people\nand make my case that i can actually\nhelp you which is like one of the key\nparts of therapy is like you have to\nconvince people that it's worth their\ntime and if i can't convince them then\nyou know maybe they don't belong there\nokay\nso\nbe careful about the nocibo effect now\nwhat can you do as a partner about the\nnocebo effect the first is that there\nare a couple of other things that this\nperson mentions one is that they feel\nmisunderstood\nokay so if you feel misunderstood by\nyour therapist\nwhat should you do\nwhat you should really really do is tell\nyour therapist hey\ni feel\nmisunderstood\nright and then let's see if you all can\nfigure out\nwhat is the next question that a\ntherapist should tell them\nwhat should a question at uh what\ntherapist should uh what question should\na therapist ask next\nright uh\nokay\nokay missing this one\nall right a little bit so you don't want\nto ask why you never want to ask\nthe word why should generally speak\nspeaking be removed from a therapist's\nvocabulary\nright\nyeah that's good so so we've got the\nright answer in there what am i\nmisunderstanding\nokay\nright so that's the communication tip\nnever ask why\nso why is that\nbecause why tends to have a judgmental\nconnotation in our language so this is\ndifferent depending on what country\nyou're from but it's like if i ask you\nlike why can't you stop playing video\ngames\nwhy can't you stop smoking weed\nwhy don't you wake up on time in the\nmorning\nright i could ask like i could be\ngenuinely wondering like oh you know but\nit sounds like an accusation\nright so you all see that\nso it's not that it's actually an\naccusation it just comes across that way\nright\nyou all see that so i mean you can still\nuse it i sometimes use y but you have to\nlike you you generally want to steer\nclear of it but that as a therapist you\nwant to just ask you know what am i\nmisunderstanding what am i missing\nso help me understand like if i'm\nmisunderstanding i'm sorry like can can\nyou please explain it to me\nokay\num\nmy therapist asks why all the time then\ni mean if you're working with them and\nthey're good like that's fine so just so\nremember that i'm i'm a medical educator\nright so i'm faculty so it's my job\nsometimes to like teach therapists stuff\nso this is just one of the things that\ni've learned that i was taught that i\npass on to people that i teach\nso you can i mean there's no absolute i\nmean there are some absolute rules for\ntherapists but generally speaking like\nif your therapist uses y doesn't make\nhim a bad therapist right in the court\nand judge and jury of dr k like\ndifferent people use different\ntechniques they may be really good at\nasking it i sometimes use y but i use it\nlater on in relationships\nonce like they understand that like i'm\nnot accusing them of anything and they\ncan kind of tolerate that once i know\nthat that's off the table then you can\nask why then it's very efficient okay\num\nso okay so\nyou could you should just tell your\ntherapist if you feel like you're being\nmisunderstood now this is gonna be a\nproblem for your boyfriend because this\nwill probably send them into a panic\nattack\noh i can't tell my therapist that i'm\nbeing misunderstood so if that's\npossible you know you can ask them hey\nwhat would it feel like to tell your\ntherapist that you're being\nmisunderstood the other thing that you\ncan always do is find a different\ntherapist\nand i make that sound like it's easy\nbut generally speaking like you know you\ncan also do both concurrently so you can\nsort of say hey why don't we like try to\nfind a different therapist\num what do you think about finding a\ndifferent therapist and at the same time\nlike tell your therapist that you\nmisunderstand them\num so you can talk to your your partner\na little bit about the therapy\nexperience\nbut in general\nif we want to understand like some of\nthis stuff the main thing that we're\ngoing to get to some of this stuff in a\nsecond but the first thing is like be\ncareful about the weed because the weed\ncould be a big big culprit just as\nsomeone who's done a lot of work in\naddictions\nit just feels like people who are\nchronically using substances are just\nplaying a completely different game like\nwhat's easy for them what's hard for\nthem what they can handle what they\ncan't handle their tolerance for work\ntheir tall their patience their ability\nto like manage anxiety and stuff like\nthat the amount of anxiety that they\nexperience just becomes night and day\nonce you're sober\nso i've seen this a lot especially like\nalcohol and weed where like people just\nbecome different humans also opiates but\nopiates is so much clearer\nso alcohol and weed are the two that i\ndon't think people realize like how\nnegatively it impacts them like usually\npeople who are you know [ __ ] up on\nopiates like recognize that they're kind\nof like screwing up their life and\nthey're like not functional when they're\nusing opiates whereas people think when\nthey're using weed and alcohol in a\ndaily basis that they're like relatively\nliving life normally\nokay\nso next thing so so there's just a\ncouple of things that you need to\nhopefully will\nwill sort of\nhelp you understand your partner so as a\npartner what can you do\nokay\nso the first thing that you can do is\nlisten\nso what i'm sort of i think you probably\nalready do a good job of this but let's\nkind of like\ngo through this um\nbut it's so hard when it feels like\nthere's nothing i can say to comfort him\nor give him advice so that's what i\nwould that's what i would like i\nrecognize that so this is the hard thing\nabout listening is when someone shares a\nproblem with us\nwe want to make their pain go away\nright and we want to make their pain go\naway we don't want to just listen\nwe want to do is help them\nand the way that we help them is by\nproviding advice\nand also\ncomfort right we want to give them\ncomfort or reassurance\nwe want to say hey everything's okay\nhere's a road forward we'll figure this\nout together like here's how you do it\nlike you know everything will be okay\nlike don't worry you're growing up\nyou're doing a good job\nright so like it's kind of interesting\nbut even comforting\nmay have the effect of infantilizing him\noh it'll okay it'll be okay babu\na little baboo\noh it's okay\nyou're gonna be such a big boy soon\nyou're going to work at that job for 27\nfor seven more months and then you're\ngoing to be a big boy\nright\nproviding advice can also be like you\nknow you're sort of falling into the\nparent role you're not like a partner so\nyou're saying like why don't you do this\nwhy don't you do this so i'm not saying\nyou shouldn't provide advice but like\njust be careful about the possible\neffects right and this is really common\nlike everyone does this so if you love\nsomeone you want to help them and when\nyou want to help them sometimes you fall\ninto these patterns that don't end up\nworking and they can sometimes backfire\nand then you as the partner who like\nloves this person feel incredibly\nfrustrated feel powerless because it's\nlike these are the two tools in my tool\nbelt why aren't they working what do i\ndo it's hopeless\nso instead of what you should do is just\nlisten\nso ask questions\nokay\nnow this is where you know like you you\nshouldn't necessarily become you should\nnot become your partner's therapist but\nthere are some questions here that you\ncould ask which go to some of these\nthings so these are going to be your\nclues okay\nso you know i would even lay out for\nthem and say like you know it sounds\nlike you're feeling really trapped\ncan you tell me about that like what's\ngoing on\nokay so you can start to like ask\nquestions about feeling trapped falling\nbehind\nright when he says i i'm so far behind i\nfeel like a child in an adult's body you\ncan say no no you're not you're clearly\nan adult in an adult's body i don't you\nknow don't don't try to comfort or\nreassure just ask them like what makes\nyou feel that way what is that like for\nyou okay so you can just like listen so\nthe way that i want you to understand\nthis is here's your partner\nokay\nand they are hopeless right\nso here's what hopelessness is like it's\nlike they're filled up\nwith all this negativity\nand what they do\nis every time they use pot\nit kind of like\ncovers it up some\nbut all that negativity is there so when\nyou listen to people what happens is we\nsort of like let that negativity like\nout\nokay and as we let the negativity out as\nthey you just kind of listen and he gets\nhis feelings kind of out you know the\nnegativity will reduce on the inside\nand so i know it's kind of weird but\nlike sometimes like really all you need\nto do is just listen just let them\nemotionally decompress and they can\nstart to feel a little bit better\nhopefully they can start to feel a\nlittle bit more hopeful\num so just listen okay there's more to\nit than that but that's the first thing\nto to do is just listen to your partner\nright if they say oh i feel\nmisunderstood by my therapist oh what is\nit that your therapist doesn't\nunderstand now you may have a reflex to\ntry to say okay well then why don't you\nexplain it to them so don't give them\nadvice don't give them suggestions\nin your mind for like two or three times\na week for up to like half an hour or 45\nminutes\nset in your mind that this is a\nconversation where i'm not gonna give\nany advice i'm just gonna listen\nright so two to three times a week\nyou guys like talk like this for 30 to\n45 minutes\nright just listen to what they've got to\nsay if they've got to say something\nnext thing\nthat you can do as a partner is\nencourage some positivity so we don't\nwant to be like\nuh\nhow can i say this blindfully positive\nbut what i'm hearing in this post is a\nlot of things that are wrong with your\npartner's life\nso sometimes what happens in our mind is\nif our mind is like filled with negative\nthoughts that are just swirling swirling\nswirling\nright like it just feels bad so\nsometimes what we can do is we can like\ninsert some kind of like positive\nthought in there\nright so what what that just means like\nexpressing gratitude having a good time\nlike saying like you know everything\neverything here sounds awful\nbut\nwhat we want to do is like not have\nyou know you could there's got to be\nsome stuff in your life that's good\nthere's got to be some reason you're\nwith him and you can just dwell or talk\nabout that right so you can sort of say\nlike hey you know i really enjoyed what\nwe did this weekend like what'd you\nthink of that movie oh did you see dune\nlike man dune was awesome i'm so glad we\nwent like what'd you think of the movie\nlike you know you can just talk about\nsomething that's positive it doesn't\nhave to be\nto the exclusion of negative things so\nlike i'd say like you know one to two\nconversations a week where you all are\ndwelling on the positive\nthe second thing that you can do to\nencourage positivity is just encourage\ncertain kinds of positive behavior\nso this is where like i don't know if\ny'all go for walks\nbut just like getting out of the house\nand saying hey let's go for a walk\nand then he's gonna say i don't want to\nand say like hey that's really important\nto me will you please come with me\nright so just ask him\nso like we'll get to that in a second\nbut encourage some kind of positive\nbehavior because right now there's a\ncycle of\ni don't know like video games weed\nterrible work and panic attacks so you\njust got to break that up with something\nelse\nso like i would try to go for a walk if\nyou can i don't know where you live\ni don't know if it's safe to go for a\nwalk\nyou know like would i just go for a walk\nlike once a week twice a week\nand then like afterward you can express\ngratitude say hey i'm really glad you\ndid that we did that how did that feel\nto you and you they say oh i was like it\nwas okay it's like cool\nyou know so try to do that a couple\ntimes a week\nnext thing that you can do\nis let him\nhelp you\nso one of the things that's really\ninteresting\nis if you look at people who are stuck\noftentimes they can help other people\neven if they can't help themselves and\nwe see this a lot in like addiction and\nrecovery where once you start on the\npath of recovery and you start helping\nother people it like really helps you\nlike grow as a person\nso like even if you can't help himself\nso this is why i would you know ask him\nfor the walk like you can frame that as\nsomething that you need that you need\nhim to do for you so that's going to\ngive him like the opportunity to first\nof all like step up and do something in\nthe relationship\nright so he's going to feel like less\ninfantilized he's going to feel like\nhe's contributing\nhe also like makes the world a better\nplace and like helps you out in some way\nyou should always express appreciation\nafterward\nbut let him help you ask for his help if\nyou need his help with something\nokay you can say hey like i really need\nto get out of the house can you please\ntake me somewhere\nright so if like depending on what your\ngender dynamic is you just like take me\nsomewhere\nright so\nand like let him kind of figure it out\nand stuff like that and so that that can\nactually be really good but giving him\nthe opportunity to help you can actually\nbe very very healthy for him\nso\nand then at some point you know if you\nwant to you can try to talk to him but\nthis is really more for a therapist you\ncould talk to him about the therapist\nright help me understand what's going on\nthere like do you want to try switching\ni know you don't believe it'll help you\noh by the way speaking of the positive\nyou can also highlight a couple of\nthings that are actually big wins here\nso this post looks like a bunch of\nlosses\nbut there are things that are wins which\neven if you share with him in that\nmoment he may swat them away so be\nprepared for that but remember if you're\ntrying to help another human being and\nthey swat away some kind of positivity\nit doesn't mean that it doesn't have an\neffect it's just reflexive for them to\nswat it away right but like it'll still\nhave some effect\nyou know it's kind of weird but that's\njust how our mind works because his mind\nis trapped in this cycle\nso anything positive that you try to do\nhe'll kind of like knock it away\nbut it still\nlands in some way so it's hard to\ndescribe but this is just something once\nagain from my experience i've come to\nunderstand\nis that they might not consciously like\nit may not make a difference to them but\nsubconsciously it can absolutely have an\neffect\nso a couple of things the first is that\nthey've still got a job\nright and so what you can kind of point\nout to them is like wow like you're\nsuffering every day\nit sounds like your job is an absolute\nmess i think it's pretty amazing that\nyou've been able like you have so much\nendurance to be able to tolerate that\nthat's insane\nright like\nit sounds so awful\nand then like what are they gonna do you\nall have hopefully heard devaluing right\nit happens in all of our interviews\noh no it's not that bad whoa what what\nwhat what\noh interesting okay\njust leave it don't push it don't say\nlike what do you mean it's not that bad\nwhat you like it tell me more about it\nno no no oh okay\ni didn't realize that it sounded pretty\nawful the way you're describing it\nother thing\nis there was one other win\noh yeah they're going to therapy\nright so like wow like i really\nappreciate your commitment to getting\nbetter\nbecause i'm hearing that your therapist\ndoesn't understand you i'm hearing that\nlike you know you don't think it's going\nto work\nand you're going anyway like i really\ni can really like respect you for that\nbecause what that signals to me is that\nlike even if things are hopeless you're\ngonna keep trying and that gives me hope\nbecause i think it's when we give up\nthat like really things are at a loss\nbut like at least it's got a chance of\nworking and like i think it's really\ngreat that you're setting aside your own\nkind of prejudices against therapy and\ngiving it a shot anyway so you can like\nencourage them in some way there are\nactually a couple of wins here right so\nwhen i look at this situation\nyou know like if we remove the job and\nremove therapy\nso smoking weed all day\nbad anxiety playing video games\nfeeling fallen behind feeling trapped\ntwo huge steps forward for this position\nperson would be getting into therapy and\ngetting a job those would both be steps\nforward right so this person is doing\nthose like you can acknowledge that\nokay\nso\nthose are the wins now\nlet's say you do all this stuff\nand it's still not working\nokay\nso let's talk about\nbreaking up\nnow as we mentioned before\nthis is the kind of situation where i\ndon't know that we're going to need\nnotes for this this is the kind of\nsituation where a lot of people on the\ninternet or friends or family would say\ndump his ass and move on right\nand like i can get behind that sentiment\nup to a point\nlike i just said i think there are a\ncouple of things that your partner is\ndoing that are actually like a real step\nin the right direction which gives me\nhope that you all will eventually get\nthrough this\nso how do you know when to break up and\nhow should you have a conversation about\nit\nso the first thing to understand is that\nlike you can do as much as you can do\nbut if your partner is not willing to\nput in the time and effort to change\nthen\neither you have to accept the\nrelationship and your partner the way\nthey are\nor you should leave right so like\nthere's there's no\ndon't plan on him magically transforming\none day\nbut he is doing things that i think are\nreally really important in that process\nof transformation one is that he hasn't\nquit yet in the second he's like seeing\na therapist right so i also don't know\nthe duration of time in terms of therapy\nbut if he's been seeing a therapist for\nsix months and doesn't feel like it's\nnot helping that's a problem\nbut let's remember that the the clinical\ntrials on therapy usually have are\nlooking at a minimum of eight weeks\nso eight weeks is sort of the amount of\ntime it starts\nto help\nso then what we're talking about is like\neight weeks to six months is really like\ntwo to six months is really when i hope\nto see a therapeutic benefit in therapy\nand then hopefully post six months\nyou're just like getting better better\nbetter better and then within a year or\ntwo i think most people that i work with\nare like in pretty good shape\nokay\nso\nhow do you have a conversation with him\nif you are getting frustrated and like\nyou know what should you say and like\nshould you break up with him is he\nterrified that he's you you should break\nup with him so this is where you know if\nhe says things like you'd be better off\nwithout me and you can say like you know\nthat may be true but i i'm choosing to\nstay with you the reasons that i'm\nchoosing to say with you is because\nyou're working on yourself\nso the main thing that i would emphasize\nhere for what you respect and also what\nyou blame when you break up with him is\nchoice\nso like it comes down to your partner's\nchoices so this is where a lot of people\nlike even they'll say oh you'll be\nbetter off without me you'll be better\noff without me and then you break up\nwith him right\nand then what go what happens is he\nleaves the relationship thinking all\nthese kinds of like hopeless thoughts oh\ni knew it i knew i wasn't a good person\ni knew i liked like i would never be\nhappy i knew she was too good for me\nand so you want to be careful because i\ndon't think you want to let him get away\nwith that\nwhat you want to emphasize is the reason\nthat you're staying with him and the\nreason that you're breaking up with him\nthis has to feel internally right to you\nor his choices\nright it comes down to choices usually\nso like if he's willing to work on\nhimself if he's willing to make the\nright choices then you're gonna stick\nwith it and you're gonna try to support\nhim\nif he's not gonna make the right choices\nor refuses to make choices if he's not\nwilling to give sobriety a shot if he's\nnot willing to give therapy a shot like\nif he's just like\nlike basically turning the hourglass day\nafter day after day hoping that\nsomething will get better\nand then you decide that this is not the\nperson that you want to be with like i\nthink that's totally fine\nand then when you do break up with him\nand he says oh like i knew like you're\ntoo good for me and\nlike you can say like do you want to\nhear why i'm breaking up with you like\nwhat my reasons are\nmy reasons are what you choose to do\nhas nothing to do with your looks has\nnothing to do with you being a man-child\nor anything like that like all the\npsychological crap it's just how you\nchoose to spend your time\nso we've talked about certain things\nthat you choose not to do\nand if you had chosen differently like i\nwould feel good about this relationship\nbut what i'm getting from you\nis that like you're not willing to put\nin the effort that it takes to change\nand i'm happy to try to support you if\nyou're willing to put in that effort but\ni can't fix your life for you you've got\nto fix you know like i'm happy to help\nyou\nbut it requires some effort on your part\nand i don't think you're making the\nright kinds of choices i understand that\nsometimes those choices are hard i may\nnot understand how hard they are they\nmay feel impossible to you but they\ndon't seem that way to me\nso and also like when it comes to like\nconversations about breaking up like if\nyou're starting to lean in that\ndirection i would talk to him about it\nand this is where partners tend to get\nterrified\nbecause\nthey're like oh my god it's happening\nlike you're gonna break up with me\naren't you and you can say like no like\ni don't want to but this is what i need\nfrom you in the relationship to try to\nlike stay in it\nlike i can't carry this [ __ ] on my own\nthis is what i need from you\nand this is where like sometimes like\nthat thought can be shattering for a\nperson\nbut this is where we have to remember\nthat this is like a romantic\nrelationship between partners\nright it there has to be some point at\nwhich you're honest like the foundation\nof this relationship should be\nauthenticity and reciprocity that's my\nbelief so if you disagree with that's\nfine nick should you protect your\npartner sure should you support your\nactually support your partner sure\nshould you protect them i'm not so sure\nso that's where like there should be a\nlot of positive encouragement i'm not\nsaying jump to this conversation right\ni'm saying like there's a lot of other\nstuff you should listen first you should\nask for their help you should point out\nall the good things that you're doing\nyou should give them positive feedback\nsupport them in finding a new therapist\nif that's what they need to do tell them\nthat you love them tell them that you're\nin in it for the long haul\nand also that you can't be the only one\nin it for the long haul\nright that they have to choose to try to\ndo particular things and even if they\ndon't want to make your choices\nthat's okay\nright because we don't necessarily be\ncontrolling and say like oh you need to\ndo x y and z like maybe with weed you\nknow or if there's some things that are\nvery significant that you know is like a\ndeal breaker but\ngenerally speaking if he says oh i don't\nwant to give up weed then you can say\nokay what else are you gonna do like i'm\non board with a plan but tell me what\nthat plan is tell me what you're doing\nto try to get better\ntell me what you're doing for our\nrelationship\nand i know that that can feel like a lot\nfor some people and it may be a lot for\nsome people and those people may not be\nready for a relationship because the\nwhole point is that you don't want to\npreserve the relationship\nby infantilizing your partner because\nthen you're just going to be like\nresentful and it's like they're not\ngoing to grow anyway right like people\nhave to grow in relationships that's a\nbig thing that people don't get\nis that you know when you start dating\nand you're 21 and you're both 21\nthat relationship is different from you\nwhen you're both 25. like you all have\nturned into different people so the\nrelationship has to evolve and change\nso i would really emphasize choice\nand really think about choices like is\nhe making the effort\nto try to\nput his life back together and if the\nanswer to that is yeah i think it'd be\nnice if you stuck with him you don't\nhave to right it's your your life\nand at the same time like if he's not\nwilling to put an effort like you can't\nyou can bring a horse to water but you\ncan't make it drink and so like you can\ntry to find him a therapist you can try\nto do this you can try to do that but if\nhe's unwilling to have conversations\nwith his therapist about how he's\nfeeling misunderstood if he's unwilling\nto consider sobriety or talk about\nsobriety if it's causing all these\nproblems\nright like if he's unwilling to do that\nstuff and sobriety is a big one\nbecause it may not i mean this may not\nbe rebound anxiety right we don't really\nknow\nbut like i think at the end of the day\nit comes down to choices and then that\nway like hopefully if you do break up\nwith him you can feel good about what\nyou did right you can feel good about\nand this isn't just like an excuse to\nlike live guilt-free no this is about\nbeing a decent human being and\nrecognizing that like i did what i could\nand i could sleep at night because i did\nwhat i could\nlike the goal isn't to like necessarily\navoid guilt it's like i'm gonna be a\ngood human being i'm gonna be there for\nmy partner i'm gonna try to support my\npartner and also like i can't fix their\nlife for them\nright that's that's the role of a parent\nthat's not the role of a romantic\npartner\nquestions\nso just to wrap up\nreally common scenario that we see\nthankfully in this community which is\nawesome right that we want to help\npeople that we love it's fantastic\nsometimes the people that we love are\nstruggling\nreally bad anxiety on the brink of\nquitting panic attacks at work if they\nquit they're gonna fall behind\nthey're gonna feel pathetic about\nthemselves smoke weed every day play\nvideo games every day try to go to\ntherapy therapy doesn't work it'll never\nwork i'm so broken it can't help me but\nhe's still going\nso what do you do first understand him a\nlittle bit\nsecond thing\nthink about how you're gonna interact\nwith him right listen to him don't\nnecessarily solve his problems for him\nhe's like let him put his big boy pants\non and solve his problems himself\nright that's going to give him\nself-respect\nso don't solve his problems for him\nsupport him in his endeavors\nyou also want to be a little bit careful\nabout\nyou know how you encourage positivity so\npoint out that not everything in your\nrelationship is a loss and when good\nthings happen appreciate those things\nask for his help that's sort of like the\nsecret technique when someone's feeling\nreally really bad about themselves\noftentimes they can help you even if\nthey can't help themselves it's part of\nthe reason why altruism is like a thing\nright it's really cool\nthat being a good human being is like\ngood for your own mental health\nnext thing is you know at some point\nyou're gonna have to probably have\nconversations about your relationship\nwhich could be moving towards the\ndirection of breaking up and generally\nspeaking you know i think the best\nreason to break up with someone is\nbecause of the choices that they make\nit's not because of how they look it's\nnot because of their luck it's not\nbecause of their health it's the choices\nthat they make\nright because that's really the only\nthing that's in their control and even\nif you break up with him and you say i\ndon't think you made the right choices\nyou're at least\nleaving him with the seed that this was\nsomething that was in your control and\nyou screwed it up\nwhich doesn't that result in shame and\nstuff like that sure but that's the\ntruth right that's life like we have to\nhold people accountable for their\nactions\non some level right we may not\nunderstand them fully\nand we don't want to like judge but at\nthe same time like we want to give him\nthe message that\nyou know what i fought you for is your\nchoices and then they feel devastated\nbecause i i screwed this up and it's\nlike yeah you did\nright but that also me like you can't\nyou can't have the power to fix things\nunless you have the power to screw\nthings up like the power is the same\nit's one and the same\nso you have to accept responsibility for\nyour actions\nand if we chalk up your circumstances to\nthings that are not your actions and\nthat stuff is out of your control in the\nfirst place\nso you want to give him responsibility\nor not if you want to give him\nresponsibility you have to hold him\naccountable to that responsibility and\nmay it hurt him sure\nbut that's like that's part of the\nprocess of becoming an adult like right\nis like recognizing that you have power\nand you can make good choices and you\ncan make bad choices\nquestions\nokay someone's saying\nmy girlfriend is struggling with some\nmental health stuff suicidal issues i\ndon't know if i really love her anymore\nand i have a crush on someone else i\nthink i'll feel like a pos if i leave\nher because i still care about her but i\ndon't know if i love her if i just care\nabout her and don't want her to be sad\nsuicidal\nso this is a really\nlike in in this scenario right so\nsometimes we get caught up in a romantic\nsituation\nwhere we have a dual role\nokay\none is like caretaker or\npseudo-therapist and the other is like\nboyfriend or girlfriend\nnow when we think about a romantic\nrelationship we think that these two\nthings\nlike should go hand in hand right so\nlike it's kind of like till death do us\npart through sickness and through health\nso you don't want to abandon your\npartner because they got ill\nbut at the same time if you've shifted\nlike if their illness is so profound\nthat you're not really like feeling like\ntheir boyfriend\nthen that's kind of like it's a tricky\nsituation right the other way to kind of\nthink about it is if they were not\nsuicidal would you break up with them\nand if the answer to that question is\nyes because you've you know because\npeople fall out of love\nand like\nthat's just part of life\nuntil hopefully you find the one\nand then it's really tricky because if\nif you would be breaking up with this\nperson except for their mental health\nand like why are you staying in the\nrelationship that's just really weird so\ni'm not saying that you should break up\nwith them because of their mental health\nbut at the same time like if you're\nfeeling like the relationship is\nchanging i think you can also\nin a sense stop being their romantic\npartner but still care about them as a\nfriend and say like hey i'm really here\nfor you i'm gonna help you like you know\nget your mental health and stuff in\norder i just don't know that i feel like\ncomfortable being your boyfriend anymore\nbecause i'm just not feeling those kinds\nof feelings\nshe's like are you breaking up with me\nand you're like well sort of\nand i wouldn't start dating your crush\nthough like i would give her some time\nright but like it's okay to tell people\nlike hey like i think it's you know\nlike i really care about you as a person\ni just don't know where this\nrelationship is right now\nand you can try to support her\nbut\nif you're not you know if you're not\nfeeling a romantic connection anymore i\nwouldn't rush out of it and jump into\nanother relationship just because you're\ncrushing on another girl that feels bad\ni would try to genuinely support this\nperson and try to help them get their\nmental health back on track\nkind of give yourself time and space to\nlike see what feelings arise\nbut so i wouldn't abandon them but at\nthe same time you don't have to like you\ndon't have to stay in a relationship\nthat you would have left a long time ago\nbecause your partner is like kind of\nsuicidal\nright like\na romantic relationship is not treatment\nfor suicidality\nmental health treatment is treatment for\nsuicidality and sometimes the two can\nget really conflated and you can feel\nreally guilty sometimes you should\nlisten to those feelings i'm not saying\nyou should dump your partner and start\ndating the crush\nlike that feels like an ass kind of\nthing to do\nso i'd give it some time and definitely\ntry to help her don't leave her hanging\nbut you can also like take a step back\nfrom some of the romantic aspects of the\nrelationship like don't have sex\nright like say like\ncan't you gotta give that up if you're\ntransitioning out of a romantic\nrelationship i think anyway\npeople may disagree\nseems to complicate\nthings immensely\num i fear my partner would leave me for\nsomeone better i don't really make bad\nchoices\nwell that's their choice right so i\ndon't know why you think that's other\npeople out there are better than you are\nand if you're making good choices then\nyour life is probably on the right track\nand if your partner wants to leave you\nfor someone better let them and then\nyou're going to continue making your\ngood choices and then you'll run across\nsomeone who will respect you for the\nperson that you are and respect the\nchoices that you make\nif your partner wants to leave you with\nsomeone better\nright you're going to be the best human\nthat you can be and the partner that you\nwant to end up with is the one that\nrecognizes that\nnot the one that you try to trick into\nstaying\nby you know\nchanging the person that you are to try\nto avoid them from like finding someone\nelse who's better\nlike you be the person that you are you\nbe the best version of yourself you try\nto grow as a human being and as long as\nyou're trying to keep your partner from\nleaving you\nlike what you're not a jailer\nright like your partner is not a\nprisoner they're free to go anytime they\nwant to relationships are based on\nchoice\nand so you just be the best human being\nthat you can be and let them choose to\nstay with you or not stay with you\nsomeone else is asking um\nmy therapist only has counseling every\nthree weeks i have a feeling i'm not\ngetting anywhere am i fomoing or is this\na legit worry i'd say that's a legit\nworry\nso if you look at so people say that\ntherapy is effective right so it does\nthings like reduce\nsymptoms of depression and anxiety and\neven like improve schizophrenia and\nthings like that\nso when we make that claim\nit is based on a certain\ndosage of therapy\nso generally speaking the clinical\ntrials on therapy are one hour a day\nonce a week for a minimum of about eight\nweeks and we're usually looking at\nmonths\nso let me put it to you this way if you\nhad\npneumonia\nand you got prescribed an antibiotic\nand let's say you get prescribed\nazithromycin okay so you're taking 500\nmilligrams a day if you suddenly start\ntaking 500 milligrams every three days\nif you're using the dose at a third\nof what the recommendation is you're not\ngoing to treat your pneumonia\nso there's a certain effect size\nthat is generally speaking\nnecessary for therapy i think\ni'm you know a bit rusty i mean there\nare you know cases of brief\npsychotherapy for example like brief\nintensive psychotherapy\nthere are also cases of once a week\npsychotherapy once a month psychotherapy\ngenerally speaking as a clinician i'll\nsee people once a week for an hour until\nthey get into a good place and then we\ncan start spacing things out okay let's\ncheck in every two weeks\nas they start to learn coping mechanisms\nas they start meditating\nas some they start to get better at\ncommunicating\nthen they don't need to see me as often\nso it just depends like\nbut generally speaking if you're not\ngetting better\nand your dosage is small like i'd up the\ndosage\nuh do you know if meditation can cause\nmental disorders trigger a psychosis or\nsomething yes absolutely\nthere are scientific studies of that i\nwill just show you quickly\nright people are wondering can\nmeditation cause psychosis absolutely\nright this is a paper from 2007 i'm sure\nthere are other case reports reviews\nthings like that\nso i think this is a good conclusion\nmeditation can act as a stressor in\nvulnerable patients who may develop\ntransient psychosis with polymorphic\nsymptomatology the syndrome is not\nculture bound but sometimes classified\nin culture-bound taxonomy like qigong\npsychotic reaction\nso can meditation cause psychosis sure\nanything that can help you can hurt you\nright\noh wow i missed something okay\nall right\nlet's move on\nyes\nchats\noh this is a good one\nthis stream always makes me feel worse\nis that bad yes\ni don't know why it's making you feel\nworse but you don't necessarily need to\ndo things that make you feel worse the\nstream is supposed to help people\nand if it's having the opposite effect\nlike\ni\nit's because sometimes like feeling\nworse is like up on the road to healing\nright i don't know how to put this but\nyou know when you're like sore and you\nstretch a muscle and it kind of hurts\nbut it like sort of feels good over time\nlike if it's that kind of worse then\nsure but if you like leave stream and\nyou're like\nsad all day long because of what the\nstream did then don't watch it\nright we're not\nwe're not\nperfect\nnow if you feel like attacked but you\ngain insight and then you start to make\npositive changes in your life\nthat's fine\nwe're happy with that\nbut\nyou know if it's not helping like\nyou know i've seen no studies that show\nthat dr k is\nalways helpful and makes people feel\ngood like there's no such science that\nexists so we if it doesn't help don't do\nit\ni mean i'm not saying just leave but\nyou know\nsomeone's asking how do you stop\nrepressing\nokay\nlook we're gonna get to this post in a\nsecond we're gonna talk about this\ndon't stop repressing\nokay\nrepressions are there for a reason and\nwhen you're ready for it then it's time\nto open the pandora's box\nbut like there's a reason so remember\nmost of the stuff that your mind does\nis good for you\nright like that's the way it's\ndeveloped\nso i see this a lot with people who have\nlike trauma and there are even studies\nabout this so there was a study\nnot one many studies that have been done\non like brief intensive processing after\ntraumatic experiences\nand so a group of like psychologists who\nwere like we're gonna save the world\nwent to some trauma-stricken sudan or\nsomething and they were like let's\nprocess your trauma baby\nthey're like tell me about how much you\nwere starving and tell me about what\nhappened and oh my god where's it like\nto starve and then what happened and\nthen what happened turned out that they\nlike re-traumatize people\nright so we've stopped doing that\nthankfully as a profession i don't blame\nthose people they thought they were\ndoing the right thing they were smart\nthey did research they respected their\nresults they did not\ncontin\nconduct scientific misconduct\nthey didn't lie about it they're like oh\nthis was a mistake we should stop doing\nthis awesome job good job psychologists\nyour attempt to help the world actually\nhurt it and then you owned it and then\nyou told everyone else hey we need to\nstop doing this\nit's awesome\nright so we learn that's what we do with\nscience\nso if you're repressing things don't\njust go and unrepress them\nnow do you need to unrepress some\nmemories to heal and stuff sure but do\nit in a safe slow manner when your mind\nis ready right\nyou"
