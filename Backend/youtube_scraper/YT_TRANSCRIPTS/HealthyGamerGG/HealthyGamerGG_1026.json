    "transcript": "some people don't understand this\nbecause their comfort zone breaking out\nof their comfort zone is not that hard\nwhereas for some of us\nbreaking out of our comfort zone is very\nhard it's like i have a phobia of snakes\ngreat we're going to have you swimming\nin a pit of snakes in three months right\nthey're like oh i like dug deep and i\novercame i went to a job interview i did\nit\nand then what happens the next day does\nthe anxiety go away no it comes roaring\nback the reason that you think other\npeople are going to be inconvenienced by\nyou comes from you it doesn't come from\nthem but what's the one thing that you\nhaven't accounted for is your own mind\nand how it's gonna like wreck you if you\ntry\nso i don't talk unless people talk to me\nhow do i change that\ni started college last week it's a\ncourse i enjoy and the classes and\nprofessors are fun\nfor a while now i was fantasizing about\ngoing back to college so i'd finally\nbreak the cycle of being 24 7 stuck at\nhome with no human contact\nand here i am and i'm underwhelmed\ni dropped out of my previous course\nbecause of depression and mostly because\ni had no contact with anyone there\nand i fear i'm headed to the same route\nnow\ni finally understand the problem though\nnot at its root\ni do not engage in any interaction with\nanyone unless the person does it first i\nsimply remain quiet completely silent\neveryone in the class seems to be\ngetting along and i feel behind i'm\nunable to start a conversation or let go\nof my inner voice that always prevents\nme from saying anything because it might\nlook stupid\ni know i need to break through the\ncomfort zone but i can't\nit just does not apply in practice i\nsimply cannot enjoy talking to people\nlet alone when we don't know each other\nyet\ni always feel like i'm bothering them\nwhen most are already in groups and i'm\njust there floating around this is more\nof a vent than anything\nso this is\na fantastic post my heart goes out to\nthis person\nso this is the challenge is that we know\nthat we're supposed to like engage with\npeople right and we even want to engage\nwith people we feel lonely we feel\nisolated we know that like human contact\nis important\nand we also sort of hear about people\nlike breaking out of their comfort zone\nright so we sort of have this idea that\nlike okay like i need to just get over\nthis anxiety or i just need to get over\nmyself i just need to step outside of my\ncomfort zone i need to put myself out\nthere right we sit like we hear things\nlike this people who don't suffer from\nthese kinds of things will say things\nlike this to us\nthey'll say just put yourself out there\nbro\ngirl\njust put yourself out there\nright\nbut the problem is that like we can't\nbecause like that solution\nworks for that person\nbecause the hump that they have to get\nover is a lot smaller than the hump that\nwe have to get over\nor\nwhat we end up concluding is that the\nhump is the same but i'm just so much\nyou know\nmy ability to climb is so much lower\nthat i can't do it and then i start to\nfeel bad about myself right so this is a\nreally common problem where people like\nare kind of stuck in this\nwanting a relationship but sort of\npassively waiting for it to show up and\neven then strategically\nyou know it's the wrong idea like you\nknow that you should be putting yourself\nout there but you can't really bring\nyourself to do that so what i'd love to\ndo today is walk through a couple of\nthings with y'all okay\nthe first is\nwhat the hell is going on in your mind\nlike how does this work right what\nhappens in our mind why does our mind\nprevent us because that's actually what\nit's doing right because you want to\nmake connections with other people why\ndoes our mind prevent us from reaching\nout to other people speaking up what are\nsome of the mechanisms that go on in the\nmind that keep us from engaging with\nother people\nhow can we understand those and then\nwe're also going to introduce you to a\ncouple of like cognitive things that you\ncan do this sort of draws on basically\nexposure therapy\nto sort of think a little bit about what\nthat hump is and how you can reduce that\nhump to position yourself to re-engage\nwith people socially okay\nso we're going to start\nby understanding okay what's going on in\nthe mind so the first thing that you all\nhave to understand is that when we are\ninexperienced with something\nour mind is going to fill it in with\npossibilities\nand because the mind fills it in with\npossibilities and has no experience it\nhas no way of assigning probability to\nthe possibility\nso if i've never you know\ngone\nswimming before\nmy mind is naturally going to fill it in\nwith like all kinds of stuff could\nhappen if i go swimming\nand generally speaking if we have an\nanxious temperament depending on what\nkind of some scars we have depending on\nour five factor personality level like\nif we're high on neuroticism the things\nthat my mind tends to fill it in with\ntend to be negative right because that's\nhow the mind works so our brain has\nevolved\nto sort of assume the worst they're like\nsafe things which we all do and then\nthey're like things that we tend to not\ndo too much so if we look at people who\nlike are explorers right explorers are\nlike the mid like the smaller section of\nour population most of the people that\nhave existed didn't board a boat and\njust see what's out there\nso generally speaking exploration is\ndiscouraged in some ways by the mind\nunless it's a very safe way to do it and\ngenerally speaking when there's an\nunknown our mind fills it in with the\nmost negative possibilities\nand why is that it's to try to protect\nus right because if we don't know what's\ngoing to happen think about all the\nthings that are going to go wrong we\nknow if we don't talk to anyone like\nsure we're going to be kind of miserable\nbut like at least we'll be safe\nand what the mind prioritizes more than\nanything else and i think this is\nevolutionary as well is safety right so\nit's like\nthe body the brain the mind prioritizes\nsafety this is why for example if you\nlook at\nyour favorite restaurant so let's say\nyou go to a restaurant you eat there 20\ntimes and you love the food every single\ntime\nif you get food sickness food poisoning\nonce the 21st time you go out to eat you\nget food poisoning like what's going to\nhappen\nyou're not going to want to eat there\nagain right so our brain is actually\nbiased doesn't say oh by the way we're\ngoing to food poisoning five percent of\nthe time\nlike it doesn't make a probabilistic\ncalculation that's not how the mind\nworks\nthe mind works by like single things\nthat are very negative\nhave a larger weight in our experience\nin our behavioral calculations than all\nof the positive stuff right so another\nway a simple way to think about it is\nlet's say i've been married for 20 years\nand i found out my partner has been\nhaving an affair for the last six months\nthat's the kind of thing where it's like\nyou can still have 20 years of good\nmarriage and if you discover an affair\nthat's been lasting for six months it\nkind of wipes away all the all the good\nwith a couple of bad things or maybe not\na couple i'm not saying that that's a\nnecessarily a bad thing i'm not trying\nto place a value judgment i'm simply\npointing out that there's a mechanism of\nmind that like one bad experience is way\nstronger than like a pile of good\nexperiences so that's a bias that our\nbrain has so when we get socially kind\nof anxious we don't talk to anyone\nthat tends to be because our mind is\nimagining all this bad stuff so let's\ntake a quick look at this post right\nso\num\nlet's look at this so breaking the cycle\nbecause i have no contact with anyone i\nfear i'm headed down the same route\neveryone in class seems to be getting\nalong and i feel behind right so that's\nwhere we start to think like oh my god\ni'm i'm kind of like a loser like we\nstart to have negative identity thoughts\nabout ourselves\nmy inner voice that always prevents me\nfrom saying anything because it might\nlook stupid\nthere it is right so what is that inner\nvoice actually telling you\nthe inner voice is trying to protect you\nit's saying hey this is unsafe don't do\nit\ni know i need to break through the\ncomfort zone but i can't it's not a\ncomfort zone it's safety zone\num\nand i cannot it doesn't apply in\npractice i always feel like i'm\nbothering them most when most groups are\nalready there and i'm just floating\naround right so all of these negative\nthoughts kind of come up and they start\nto get in the way of us actually doing\nthings\nso let's take a quick look at\nwhat\nhow we sort of tackle this problem okay\nso can't initiate\nconversation\nso\nhere's you\nhere's the activation energy to initiate\na conversation okay\nthat looks\nlet's do make it straighter i'm at an\nangle oh no\nokay so here's the activation energy so\nin order to engage in something for\nthose of y'all that are familiar with\nlike chemical reactions and stuff\nthere's this idea of an activation\nenergy right\nand actually if we want to be\nlegitimate around\nchemical\nstuff this is actually what the curve\nshould look like right so we end up we\nstart here and we end up lower so moving\nfrom a high energy state to a low energy\nstate so this is the gap\nthat we have to overcome in order to\ninitiate the behavior so let's try to\nunderstand what that gap is so for our\nfriends\nwho say oh just put yourself out there\ntheir gap is gonna be like smaller okay\nso like when they say oh like just put\nyourself out there their gap is like\nthis\nright that's why it feels easy to them\nand they're like oh like sure there's\nlike there's some activation energy i\nknow exactly what you're talking about\nthere's an activation energy for me too\nyou just have to get over it\nbut what we face and what they face is a\nlittle bit different\nso let's try to understand what are the\ncomponents of this hump that we have to\ngo over okay\nso even if we look back at our post what\nwe're going to sort of find is that\nthere are particular\nthere's a lack of experience\nand in that lack of experience we're\ngoing to have doomsday scenarios\nright and this in turn makes us want to\nbe safe\nso it's actually a feeling of safety\nhere okay\nnext thing to kind of consider is\nthere's an identity component\nright other people are social but when\nwe start to say things like fallen\nbehind\nif y'all have been paying attention to\nour content and watching and stuff like\nthat you recognize that this is a\ncomparison\na comparison is born of the ego or the\nahamkar\nand this in turn is an identity issue do\nyou all see that\nso it's like you can chain this stuff\nvery easily right\nand so then there are also like some of\nthese doomsday scenarios like we'll talk\nkind of more specifically here but\nthere's this idea that i'm bothering\npeople\nthere's also the concern that\ni'll look like an idiot\nso\nhow do we overcome this stuff right\nso a couple of different things that we\ncan do to lower this activation energy\nthe first thing is that as we sort of\ndeal with some of these things\nas we address these issues it should\nlower the activation energy so even in\nsomething like exposure therapy so let's\ntalk about exposure therapy\nfor a second what's the what's the\nprinciple behind exposure therapy okay\nso the principle behind exposure therapy\nis that what we want to do is like give\nyou more data points\nso let's say that i have one data point\ni eat at a restaurant once\nand i get sick\nright i just have one data point and\nthat data point is sickness and\ntherefore i'm not going to engage in the\nbehavior because like i had a really bad\nexperience right so let's say let's use\na kind of a better example so let's talk\nabout exposure therapy\nof like a phobia\nof let's say\ndogs\nokay so i was bitten by a dog when i was\na kid\nand i got terrified\nand so now i'm scared of dogs\nso any time that we have a hypothetical\nencounter with a dog\nwhat our safety circuit fills it in with\nis negative possibilities\nright all we have is these negative\npossibilities\nand really all we have is is let's call\nit one actual\nnegative experience so this is our\nnegative experience okay\nbut then we have all these negative\npossibilities that we'll we're kind of\nlike filling it in with so the goal of\nexposure therapy is to try to have these\nkind of neutral\nsort of experiences that we're going to\nfill it in with\nand then what happens is like the\nbalance will start to change\nright it won't be all negative so the\nway that exposure therapy will work is\nwhat we're going to want to do is we're\ngoing to sort of think about a dog\nand this works physiologically okay so\nwhen i think about a dog when someone\nwhen a patient is sitting in my office\nand i tell them think about a dog what\nstarts to happen they have a sympathetic\nnervous system reaction\nso what does this mean this means\nadrenaline\nincreased heart rate increased blood\npressure\ndiaphoresis\nsweating\nright tachypnea\nthat's elevated respiratory rate\nhyperventilation\nwe have all these kinds of physiologic\nthings\nand then what happens is the brain gets\nthis exposure of thinking about a dog\nhas this physiologic reaction\nand then nothing happens\nso the brain is like\ni thought we were in danger okay so\nthere's no reinforcement of the danger\nand then when they come back next week\nwe're gonna think about the dog again\nokay we're just thinking about the dog\nbut this time there's a little bit less\nsympathetic reaction because we thought\nabout the dog and nothing bad happened\nso our body's like okay not that big of\na deal\nmaybe i don't need to freak out as much\nthen what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to\nelevate the exposure then we're gonna\nlook at pictures of dogs\nand now instead of just thought what\nwe're what we're adding is actually like\na sensory organ sort of activation and\nthen we're gonna go sit on a park bench\nor maybe go sit inside a coffee shop\nthat'll probably be safer look outside\nat dogs playing but there's a wall of\nglass\nright and then so what happens is like\nthis is to increase our sympathetic\nnervous system\nright so we're going to get that\nreaction and then like the more we sort\nof what we're gradually going to do is\nthen we're going to go sit on a park\nbench\nand then that person like the patient is\ngoing to have a rapid heart rate they're\ngoing to be like freaking out right\nthey're outside of their comfort zone so\nlike what we gradually do is we get like\ncloser and closer to like encountering a\ndog but we do it sort of in a safe\nmanner\nokay\nso and then what happens is like\nremember that the mind has no experience\nor it has a limited experience and so by\nadding a lot of other data points that\nare benign\nwe make it easier to engage in the task\ndoes that make sense\ncan you do this with women absolutely\nyou can do this with women okay\nwe're gonna talk i mean i hope that's\nokay to say what i mean by that i don't\nknow if you're a man or a woman but you\ncan do this with social interactions\nlet's call it that way let's let's say\nthat okay\nso\nlet's talk a little bit about\nhow to actually do this\nso the goal here is that we want to have\nan increase\nin benign\nsocial\ninteractions\nso there are four things that we can do\nfour things that we can focus on to make\nit easy okay\nwhen we'll talk i may have opened a can\nof worms by answering a question from\nchat but we'll get to that in a second\nokay i'll try to fix that and hopefully\nnot offend people so let's kind of focus\non the core principles\nso increase in benign social\ninteractions that's our goal so what we\nwant to think about first of all is\nwhat will the social interaction be\nokay we want to lay that out\nand that's usually where people stop\nright so when people are like oh i just\nneed to do this so they just think about\nthe action and they stop there they\ndon't explore any of the resistance that\ntheir mind will come across the second\nthing that we need to look at is\nself-image\nwhat will people think\nso i would recommend concretely asking\nyourself\nso let's use let's start small right so\nwhat we're going to do is\nsay hello\nto the person next to you\nin class\nnext to you\nand then we have to get more specific\nthan this because what does hello mean\nright so when i'm actually working with\npatients what we need to do is be\nconcrete so what we're going to say is\nhey how are you today that's what we're\nactually going to say\nso what feels natural so think through\nactually what you're going to say is it\ngoing to be hello\nor is it going to be hello right so is\nit going to be a\nelder scrolls npc\nor is it going to be hey how are how are\nyou today you know like what are you\nactually going to say what feels\ncomfortable so you have to think through\nthat a little bit\nand even as you're thinking through it\nwhat what are you going to get you're\ngetting a sympathetic reaction\nokay or you could say how howdy hello\ncitizen\nright\num\nhave you heard of the thalmor the glory\nof the thalmor is that\nhello traveler\nright so then so don't say zug zug\nbecause we're going to get into problems\nwith self-image so then you got to think\na little bit about how are they going to\nperceive you if you say hey how you\ndoing because what happens is in the\nabsence of this\ncognitive exploration your mind is going\nto fill it in with like random negative\nthings they're going to think i'm trying\nthey're going to think i'm a complete\ncreep no they're not right so if you\nreally like think about it logically and\nyou engage with your mind you may feel\nthat way you may feel awkward but what\nare they actually going to think if you\nsay hey how are you doing today\nright\nso just think through it grapple with it\nand this is where some ego stuff is\ngoing to come up so like how are they\ngoing to think about you and then think\njust think through that a little bit\nlike so your mind may start with saying\nthey're going to think you're a complete\nidiot and then just sort of question\nthat and be like ask yourself if someone\nwalked up to me and said hey hey how are\nyou doing today you know and i was\nsitting next to them and maybe if they\nwalked up to me on the street it would\nbe weird but they're sitting next to me\nand they said hey how are you doing\ntoday like does that really bother me no\nlike it doesn't really bother me so\nthink through that\nnext thing that we want to do\nis think through\nthe consequences\nof taking action\nso what is actually going to happen\nso we want to think about what the\ninteraction is going to be we want to\nthink about you know what people are\ngoing what what how are p how will\npeople view me so you want to think\nthrough self-image and then you want to\nthink about what are the actual\nconsequences like what are people going\nto do if i say hey how are you today\nand it's not going to be like oh they're\ngoing to stop showing up at class\nbecause i said hello to them like that's\nnot gonna happen right whereas in a\nnon-structured cognitive way if you let\nyour mind run wild it'll actually think\nthoughts like that right it'll think\nlike oh i'm they're gonna feel so\ninconvenienced by me\nbut if we really think about it the\nreason that you think other people are\ngoing to be inconvenienced by you comes\nfrom you it doesn't come from them right\nit comes from your own idea\nyour self-image that you are a burden to\nother people\nso that's where the ego component comes\nin so think through the actual\nconsequence\nthen what we want to do\nis\nanticipate internal challenges\nso if i were to stop there\nand say\ngo say hi to someone the next time\nyou're in class\nnot good enough because you've thought\nthrough all this stuff right but what's\nthe one thing that you haven't accounted\nfor is your own mind\nand how it's gonna like wreck you if you\ntry so what is my mind going to do this\nis the next very important question you\nneed to ask yourself right\nwhat is gonna happen okay i'm gonna feel\nsweaty\nright i'm gonna feel awkward\ni'm gonna feel bothersome\nand then kind of think through a little\nbit like okay what what could i say or\nwhat could i do\nthat would make me feel less of these\nthings even if i felt this way\nwhat could i get away with right what\ncould i convince myself or push myself\nto do because what you may just discover\nis that you know like something like\nthis is actually is going to make you\nfeel so awkward and so uncomfortable\nthat\nyou know like it's too much to handle so\nthen maybe what you need to do is like\ndownplay like what you kind of do so\nmaybe the you know there are all kinds\nof modifications you can make so you\nhave to remember that like instead of\ntrying to overcome yourself\nso this is what tends to happen is we\ntry to overcome ourselves and then we\ncreate internal conflict in the mind\nwhen we create internal conflict in the\nmind that does not increase our\nrelaxation it increases tension in the\nmind\nramps up our internal energy and the\nmore that our energy is ramped up and\nthe less relaxed we are the more it\nboosts our anxiety\nso if you all have seen dr k's guide to\nanxiety you sort of know this with\nrebound anxiety\nwhich is like this problem where like\npeople run into this issue where they\novercome their anxiety\nright they're like oh i like dug deep\nand i overcame i went to a job interview\ni did it\nand then what happens the next day does\nthe anxiety go away no it comes roaring\nback\nright\nso what you have to do is work with\nyourself\ninstead of trying to overcome yourself\nbecause the part of you that feels\nunsafe is going to come roaring back\nokay you can sort of bludgeon it into\nsubmission with enough time so if you\ncreate enough experience\nthat can get better\nbut generally speaking what we want to\ndo is work with ourselves right so if\nyou're if there's a part of you that's\nlike yeah that's like that's too much i\ncan't handle that then be like okay so\nwhat can i handle\nso maybe this is something as simple as\nlike sit in the same chair twice with\nsomeone else the same person sitting\nnext to you so sit next to this person\nlike three days in a row you're not\nsitting next to the person you're just\nsitting in the same chair because in my\nhead in my anxious head\ni'm so afraid that people are gonna\nthink that i'm trying to sit next to\nthem that i keep on moving around\nright like i create all of these ways in\nmy head that i inconvenience the rest of\nthe world\nand then what i try to do is like stop\ninconveniencing the rest of the world in\nmy head so i start sitting in a thousand\ndifferent places\nand then i'm sort of doing everyone a\nfavor by like not sitting next to them\nright\nso you need to think through your own\ninternal challenges that that are going\nto arise and prepare for them once you\ndo that\nthen you actually want to take the\naction right so this is where what i'd\nrecommend is if you're really like in a\nschool situation\nit's not sufficient to sit you know to\nsay hello or like that's not enough like\nyou need to do more and don't worry i'm\nit's not going to be bad so what i'd\nrecommend if you're kind of socially\nanxious is that you find other scenarios\nbecause let's say that you have a class\nthat's monday wednesday friday if you\nsay hello\non monday and then on tuesday you're\njust anxious all day\nit's going to be harder to do it on\nwednesday where you say hello\nand then you felt so awkward that you're\nanxious all day\nand then on friday\nyou managed to say hello but your voice\ncracks\nbecause you rile yourself up and then\nyou're traumatized going into the\nweekend\nand then monday rolls around\nand yeah we're done with that\nyour mind is like yeah we're done with\nthat\nso this is another common mistake that\npeople make is that like they they think\noh i've tried this i've tried this i've\ntried this it doesn't work it doesn't\nwork it doesn't work and they're not\nwrong\nright like they're not wrong this is\nyour experience the question is why is\nthat your experience the question is how\ncan you change it\nso what i'd recommend if you've been\nsocially isolated\nis that you ramp up your activity and\nyou\nmortify people in different situations\nso even\non monday we're gonna say hey how are\nyou but then\non monday afternoon when we go go to the\ngrocery store\nwe're gonna like make like we're gonna\nsay thank you\nto the person\nthe cashier right\nif the waiter\nlet's say you go out to eat with some of\nyour close friends who you can socialize\nwith you're going to ask them you know\nwhat's good here\nand then you're gonna feel super awkward\nright what are the internal challenges\nthe waiter is like oh yeah the\nsandwiches are really good here but you\ndon't want to eat a sandwich then what\ndo you do you're screwed\nbecause the waiter said the sandwiches\nare good and i'm not gonna order a\nsandwich then why the hell did i even\nask if i'm not gonna follow their\nrecommendation so think about these\nthings\nright it's okay\nright\nso it's okay so like you're gonna ask\nfor the recommendation and then if you\nreally want to oh thanks for\nrecommending i'm not feeling a sandwich\ntoday so you're gonna prepare\nokay thanks for the recommendation not\nreally up my alley\nor if you want to go like you know super\nchad mode\nyou can even say like i know it's super\nbizarre i asked you for a recommendation\nnow i feel like an idiot ordering\nsomething else\nyou can even joke if you want to and go\nmeta with them right\nyou'll get that like you just say like\ni've done that before because i feel\nlike an idiot asking and then\nyou know not ordering what they say\nyou know like they don't care like\nthey're not gonna lose sleep over\ntonight you may lose sleep over it\ntonight\nbut you can just they offer a small\nexplanation if you want to you can say\nlike oh like thanks for the\nrecommendation you know what this salad\nsounds amazing i think i'm gonna try\nthat\nyou know just\nit's not that big of a deal feels like\nthat big of a deal\nso you need to think about multiple\ninteractions we want to actually kind of\npace them up right so monday wednesday\nfriday we're going to say hello to\npeople that we sit next to\nwe may even ramp up a little bit we're\ngoing to say hello\nhow are you\nfriday you can ask oh yeah have you like\ntried the homework yet\nright you can sort of ask that one day\nyou can\nby the way i never got a chance to\nintroduce myself\neasy so this is another like there are\ntechniques you can use so i don't know\nif you all have ever gotten to this kind\nof social anxiety trap which is that\ni've been making small talk with this\nperson and like i don't know their name\nand they don't know my name so now i\ndon't know how to interact with them\nbecause i feel like i should know their\nname and it's been two weeks\nand now we're like\ngg\nso then like you're like i don't know\nhow to ask this person their name\nbecause it's too late now so i guess\ni'll go sit on the other side of the\nroom\nand and just\nyou know never speak to them again\nright\nand so then you know you don't want to\nwalk up to them and say like hey\nyou're an npc so i don't know your name\nno you want to say hey i didn't get a\nchance to introduce myself\nright and you can say\ndidn't get a chance\nand what how are they going to feel when\nyou say that\nthey're going to feel relieved because\nthey don't know your name either\nbecause you'll never introduce\nyourselves you just started talking\nand they're like oh thank god\nbecause every week they're coming into\nthe class\nthey're like oh [Â __Â ] that guy's gonna\nsit next to me again and i don't\nremember his name i don't remember his\nname i don't remember his name\nright\nlike\nthey're gonna be relieved oh by the way\ni didn't get a chance to introduce\nmyself or if i did introduce myself i'm\nsorry i didn't i didn't catch your name\nit slipped my mind\ncan you please remind me what was your\nname again\nwhatever feels comfortable so i i\npersonally i keep track of this kind of\nstuff so i'll say like you know i didn't\nget a chance to introduce myself hi my\nname is and then you can kind of do that\nright\nand so if you have these other kinds of\nsocial interactions remember what we're\ndoing\nhere's our vacuum of experience of human\nexperience\nthat our social anxiety is filling in\nwith doomsday scenarios\nright and so when we have a waiter\nconversation it's over not even\nconversation we say hi to the waiter we\nthank the cashier we say hi to someone\nin class\num you know there are other things that\nyou can just like whatever opportunities\nyou have for brief social interactions\nlike very very brief social interactions\nright like if you're waiting on the bus\nyou can just like nod to someone like\ndon't you know don't make it weird\ngender wise\nyou're just like nod to someone so like\ni i'm a big fan of\nthe bron right depending on what you're\ninto you can be the down knot or the up\nnod\nso it could be like a you know\nlike i acknowledge you i see you as a\nhuman and you're a good person\nright\nand so that that's kind of you know that\nmay be a bit much for other people\nbut whatever you feel good with\ncashiers grocery stores family members\nyou know\nlike\nwhatever you feel comfortable with and\nyou want to try to pack in as much\nmild social interaction as you can\nwithin one week\nokay like don't just do like one thing\nevery 48 hours like try to have small\nthings with people who will never talk\nto each other so they can't because\nthere's the thing oh my god like you\nwon't believe the weirdest person talked\nto me at the bus stop oh that guy's i\ntook a picture of him he's in my class\noh and then the rest of the world is\nconspiring and talking about you behind\nyour back about how socially awkward you\nare\nand they go to a party and their friend\nis the cashier from the grocery store\nand their friend is also the one and\nthen his roommate is the waiter and all\nfour of them are gonna talk and they're\ngonna realize like there's like oh man i\nmet the most awkward [Â __Â ] this guy\ncame to my restaurant today and asked me\nwhat was good i told him with sandwich\nthis [Â __Â ] ordered us uh\na salad here i i got a copy of the\nsecurity footage and we could compare to\nthe picture of the guy that\nlike that's not gonna happen\nright you all get that like that's just\nnot gonna happen\nbut that's what your mind does and why\ndoes it do that it's because it's got\nnothing else to fill it in with\ny'all get that like there's none of this\nover here\nit's all gone\nso then what happens what happens with\nsocial anxiety this is what happens with\nsocial anxiety i don't know if you guys\nknow this\nthis is what happens\nnightmare scenarios and i'm like oh like\noh my god\nand then it becomes this whole big thing\nin your head\nand then\nthis is where the hump comes from\nright so by having these mild social\ninteractions\nwhat tends to happen\nis this\ni mean sorry we reduce this so what\nhappens when we have mild\nwe break this up\nright oh like this gets kind of broken\nup and the nightmare scenario kind of\ndisappears we lower the hump a little\nbit we're going to prep for it\ncognitively we're going to recognize hey\nthis is going to be tough it's going to\nbe hard it's going to make me feel\nuncomfortable i'm going to get all\nsweaty that's okay\nit's really not okay but i'm gonna do it\nanyway i'm gonna do what i can manage\nright so i'm gonna ask myself okay what\ncan i manage\nright\nand if you can't if it's too terrifying\nto ask the waiter what's good you can\nsay\nwhen the waiter asks you at the end of\nyour meal\nthey're like how was everything oh\neverything was fantastic thank you\nyou could say that\ni think you can get away with that right\nwe're not going to get to like some of\nthe harder stuff because then later on\nwhen dr k really wants to screw with his\npatients who have social anxiety not\nreally but it's\npart of the fun of working with people\nright then it's like next time you go to\nthe restaurant and a waiter asks you how\nwas everything because they've done like\nstep one step two step three step four\nstep five step six\nthey're like okay i'm good at talking to\npeople not great\nso the next time you're unsatisfied with\nsomething at a restaurant\ntell them when they ask you how it was\neverything how's that oh everything was\ngreat\nmy fish was undercooked and inedible let\nthem know\nright\njust let them know just be like hey i\nthought this is like\ni thought it was light on the seasoning\nto be honest oh i'm so sorry about that\nno no big deal you know\nmaybe try it\nyou know\nyou don't have to say it was horrible\nbecause oftentimes like restaurants and\nwaiters and chefs and lion cooks\nappreciate feedback right they want to\nknow if they're like doing something\nwrong\ninstead they just keep on getting you\nknow three-star reviews on on google or\nyelp and they're like\nthey're just forking over money to yelp\ni suppose try to fix the problem\num\nokay so does that make sense so really\nreally common so let's kind of summarize\nso we run into this scenario where\nwe don't know how to talk to people\nunless they talk to us\nand this is where like our friends who\nare more socially comfortable than we\nare\nwill say get out of your comfort zone\nright\ni need to break through the comfort zone\nbut i can't and why is that it's harder\nthan it appears to be\nso some people don't understand this\nbecause their comfort zone breaking out\nof their comfort zone is not that hard\nwhereas for some of us\nbreaking out of our comfort zone is very\nhard\nand so what are the factors that go into\nthat the first just a lack of experience\nthat the mind in order to keep us safe\npopulates our head with hypotheticals\nokay second thing we have to watch out\nfor if we've been this way for a while\nthere may be identity related stuff\ngoing on the hump god may be active we\nmay be comparing ourselves to other\npeople it's so easy for other people\npeople i am such a bother right so when\nyour mind starts thinking that way it's\nnot that my conversation is boring it's\nthat i am boring so there's a difference\nbetween like when you identify with\nsomething and like you know some\nattributes like i suck at dancing\nwhereas like i am a bad person\nright there's a big difference between\nwhen we get identified when we identify\nwith something\nand so then we have all these thoughts\nlike i'm bothering people so if you want\nto deal with this what you want to do is\nwe're going to draw like the general\nprinciple of exposure therapy is that we\nwant to have a graduated exposure to\nthings which is terrifying and there's\nnothing more terrifying to someone with\na phobia than exposure therapy\nthey're like you gotta be freaking\nkidding me like exposure therapy has\nsuch a pr problem\nit's like i have a phobia of snakes\ngreat we're gonna have you swimming in a\npit of snakes in three months\nfantastic\nand i wonder why people don't come back\nokay\nso generally speaking it's because we\nhave all these hypotheticals and what we\nwant to do is create safe situations\nthat create a\nphysiologic response which then we\nacclimatize to so we want people in\nexposure therapy to feel safe the entire\ntime okay we don't want them out of\nthere let's say here's your comfort zone\nhere's the danger zone we don't want to\nmove you from here to here we want to\nmove you here and then here and then\nhere and then the inevitability of\nmoving over there is what terrifies\npeople when it comes to exposure therapy\nso you don't have to go all the way if\nyou don't want to okay\nthere are four things you can do to\nincrea to decrease that that burden\nthat activation energy that you have to\novercome\nfirst is clearly define the interaction\nsecond is think about your self-image\nlike how what are people gonna think\nabout me if i actually do this\nand don't let that answer\ncome up naturally in your mind like it's\nnot the first thing that your anxiety\nthinks of actually do like a calculated\nintrospective exploration of if i sit\nnext to someone and ask them how they're\ndoing today like how are they actually\ngoing to think about it so you can even\nrestructure that thought\nthink about the consequences of taking\nthe action what is actually going to\nhappen is there going to be a party the\nnext day where the waiter\nyou the cashier\nthis person from my class\nand this person from my class's roommate\nare all going to like talk about me\nbehind my back that's not going to\nhappen right so but think through it\nengage with those thoughts\nand then anticipate your internal\nchallenges ask yourself what can i get\naway with\nwhat can i manage because you don't want\nto fight yourself right it's like what\ncan you manage\nand the cool thing is that when you\nmanage it then what you can also do pro\ntip\ngood job you\nstrong work\nhey i actually did it today like i know\nit was terrifying then you're gonna feel\nlike an idiot\nright\nbecause like if you like said hello to\nsomeone in class you can't give yourself\na pat on the back because you've fallen\nbehind you're so socially inept that i\ncan't you giving yourself a pat on the\nback for saying\ngood job\nfor saying hello to someone\nthat's pathetic so watch out for that\nthat thought right that's your ego as\nwell so you should give yourself a pat\non the back it's not easy to do\nnotice your ego anticipate the internal\nchallenge\nright be prepared for that voice that\nsays oh that was so pathetic you had to\nwork yourself up just to say hello\nyou're like yeah like it's hard for me\nlike chill bro\nwe did it\nright like we moved one step forward\nso you can reframe that a little bit\ntoo\nnext tip to remember\nis that\ngenerally speaking when people are\ntrying to like socially integrate\nthey'll pick one thing\nspace it out over a long period of time\nlike i'm gonna say hello\nhello on monday hello on wednesday and\nhello on friday you need to pick it up a\nlittle bit right so you can do more\nthings that are less mortifying so like\ndo a couple of different things so that\nyou get used to more social interactions\nand then watch out for the nightmare\nscenario\nright because that's what your mind is\ngoing to do and if you do these kinds of\nthings hopefully you can start engaging\nwith people remember to go slow\nremember not to like it doesn't matter\nlike don't judge i mean i say don't\njudge yourself your mind will try to\njudge you just acknowledge that say like\nyou know hey like everyone's on their\nown road\nwe all start from where we are and like\nwhether other people are further ahead\nor behind or whatever like that's\nirrelevant i am where i am\nokay\nand just take it slow\nquestions\nso this is a great question can you help\nme i'm i'm too sus because i think my\ngirlfriend might just be too beautiful\nto be with me so that can be confusing\num it's something i understand really\nwell because i too thought my wife was\ntoo attractive to be with me and that's\nwhere like instead of assuming\nso this is the interesting thing if you\nthink your partner is too attractive to\nbe with you\nthis is where\nyou know you can assume that\nthat's sort of true or you can recognize\nthat your value is greater than what you\nthink\nright\npossible\num\nhow to continue from hello you don't\ncontinue at the beginning\nokay\nso like you don't have to continue after\nthe whole you can just say hello and\njust stop it and they're like but that's\nawkward because i'm not saying anything\nwell it's like well there's another\nhuman being involved too so here's the\nother thing\nif you're socially anxious the other\nthing you really really need to remember\nis that you can't carry the whole\n[Â __Â ] conversation nor should you try\nto carry the whole conversation\nwhen you try to carry the whole\nconversation when you think to yourself\nfirst i'm going to say hello then i'm\ngoing to say this then i'm going to say\nthis if that doesn't work i'm going to\nsay this if that doesn't work i'm going\nto say that's going to lead to a\nterrible social interaction that\nterrible social interaction is going to\nmake you feel more socially anxious\ngoing forward don't carry the whole\nconversation\ndon't map everything out there's another\nhuman being involved let them carry it\nhello\ndon't say anything else don't go to plan\nb if that's the reaction you get\nand they say hey how are you\nso if they say hey how are you you can\nsay i'm doing well\nhow are you\ni'm doing great cool\nenough for today\nright next day you go in what's up man\nhow's your day going\nup none\ngot it\ndude like let's see\noh no what the [Â __Â ] is it this guy do it\nso don't carry the whole conversation\nthat's where a lot of socially anxious\npeople like get tripped up because they\ntry to do all the work\nbecause you have to like plan for\neverything that's going to go wrong\nright so it's like this happens i got to\ndo this\ni get to do this and then you're not\nhaving a conversation\nyou're like playing it like a\nconversation simulator game in your head\nright like then it really is turning\ninto like npc oblivion dialogue where\nit's like let me try this dialogue tree\nin this dialogue tree in this dialogue\ntree\nright so so like it's a conversation\nwith another human being involved\nso don't don't play conversation\nsimulator even though it's really\ncomforting to do because what does\nconversation simulator do for us\nmakes us feel safe\nif i've mapped out all the conversation\ni've predicted every possibility\nthen i can go into the conversation and\nfeel safe because no matter what\ni know what to say\nconfidence doesn't come\nfrom mapping everything out ahead of\ntime and knowing exactly what's going to\nhappen that's closer to cheating\nright like confidence like if you're\nplaying an rts in your map hacking\nthat's not going to build your\nconfidence\nbecause you know where everything is\ngoing to be confidence comes from\nplaying the map blind\nit's like i can scout i can handle it if\nthey're rushing like not that big of a\ndeal like\nright like these conversation maps that\nyou make in your mind is like a map hack\nthat just reinforces your dependence on\nthe map hack and then you can't play a\nregular game\nyou"
