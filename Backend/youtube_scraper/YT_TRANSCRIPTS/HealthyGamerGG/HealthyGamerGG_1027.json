    "transcript": "every once in a while this is where\nthings get good every once in a while\nsomeone will say yes\nand your dad will be like yeah i went\nthrough a very similar thing started\nshooting myself up with testosterone and\nthat's how i learned how to be a man i\nswear to god every once in a while you\nhave that and then it's an eye-opening\nmoment\nright\nand it's like wait a minute\nmaybe my dad has gone through something\nsimilar\nright maybe this is why he's terrified\nbecause he's spent his entire life\ntrying to convince himself that he's\ncisgender\ni swear to god this happens every once\nin a while it happens\nhey everyone i've been watching healthy\ngamer for a while and has helped me out\nbut this is the first time i've had the\ncourage to write anything\nstrong work\nright\ni recently came out as trans to my\nfamily and they have not taken the news\nwell at all\ni feel bad because even though it's\nsomething that i have wanted to do\nbecause it will make me happy it ends up\nhurting a lot of people in the process\nmy friends and extended family have been\nvery supportive of me but my immediate\nfamily is basically disappointed with me\nthey try to convince me about how i\nshould try to date girls work out more\nand take testosterone so that it would\nfix me\ni know that deep down it wouldn't change\nmy feelings but it's hard to communicate\nthat to them so i end up lying\nhow could i date someone if i can't even\nlook in the mirror and see myself\nall my life i've had feelings of\npowerlessness and i've been trying to\nmeet the impossible standards of my\nparents\ni understand that it is a lot for them\nto process and i would be very scared if\ni was in their shoes but their lack of\ncompassion and understanding is very\ndisheartening\nanyways if anyone has advice or thoughts\nand is going through a similar\nexperience i would love to hear about it\nso this unfortunately is an increasingly\ncommon experience\nthat\nis precisely why it's very very\nimportant to talk about\nso we're going to talk about now is\nfirst of all if you're trans how can you\ntalk to your family\nthere's going to be a lot of individual\nvariation there depending on you know\nyour family and and what the situation\nis but in general\ni think that one of the things that\nwe've missed out on is sort of a skill\nset\nto talk to our parents or other people\nabout things that they're not really\ncomfortable with so it doesn't have to\nbe trans it can be\nstepping away from the religion of your\nparents it can be stepping into a\ndifferent religion it can be wanting to\nbecome a professional gamer or a\nstreamer as a career it can be getting a\ntattoo it can be moving out of the house\nit can be majoring in something that is\nnot if you're indian medicine\npre-law engineering finance or cs\nright like there there are all kinds of\nthings that our family will react poorly\nto\nand then we sort of feel\nlike you know there's a lack of\ncompassion and understanding it starts\nto feel very disheartening\nand then what we end up doing\nis we end up lying\nand why do we do that it's to preserve\nsome semblance of a relationship right\nbecause like you can't fix this problem\nso like i'm gonna just sweep it under\nthe rug\nbecause you care about your family\npresumably your family cares about you\nthis doesn't seem like when you try to\ntalk about it things don't seem to be\nmoving in the right direction\nand so as a result like what's the point\nof having a conversation that's just\ngonna get like move things in the wrong\ndirection so you start avoiding you\nstart lying you start feeling internally\ndis like you know disconnected from them\nyou start putting on a mask and you kind\nof wind up in the situation where your\nfamily disapproves of your choices\nwhether it's sexuality gender identity\nreligion career choice\nwhat you wear\ni one time\nhad a\npatient whose parent\nfelt personally offended by their\ngrooming habits\nthey're like don't you realize\nhow you make me look bad\nwhen you don't\nshave\ndon't you realize\nhow bad it makes me look\nright\nit's like\ni didn't realize that my personal\ngrooming had to be held to the standard\nof your social reputation i i didn't\nconnect those two dots\nright\nso\nthe question then becomes okay like how\ndo we talk to people like this right\nso the first thing is especially if\nyou're trans\nyou you know i think you've got to be\ncareful for a number of reasons\nthe first is that remember that gender\nidentity and even sexuality tend to like\ntake time to form so i've worked with\nsome trans people who knew from a very\nvery young age that their gender\nidentity was not like their biological\nidentity and they were like it was set\nin stone a long time ago they were just\nborn into the wrong body\ni met with other i've worked with other\npeople who felt like they were\nnon-binary or something in the middle\nand then like later on sort of like\nsolidified actually their biological\ngender right so there's the teenage\nyears in adolescence and young adulthood\nare like a big part of discovering who\nwe are\nand so one of the things that i think\nactually happens way too often is that\nwe try to jump to labels\nto capture our experience\nso for example like just because someone\nyou know is not starts to have feelings\nfor\nstarts to be sexually attracted to\nthe same gender let's say at the age of\n14 or 15 they may\nbe terrified that they're actually\nhomosexual jump to the conclusion that\nthey're homosexual they assign\nthemselves a label because it helps them\norganize their life some and then later\non they may discover actually that\nthey're bisexual or pansexual\nso this is something that i think is\nactually kind of a problem is that i\nthink we jump to labels too quickly and\nnow we have so many labels right so i'm\nlike demiflex i'm non-binary pansexual\nbisexual so just remember that\ndiscovering who you are is a process\nit's not something that you have to like\nfigure out by the age or 15 and a half\nand then you stamp yourself with a label\nand that's what it is for the rest of\nyour life that's been my predominant\nexperience\nso give yourself time you know don't\nlock your yourself in if you know what\nyou are if you're one of the people who\nknows from the very young age that's\ntotally fine then it doesn't apply to\nyou both i've seen both both versions\nokay\nso then the question kind of becomes how\ndo i talk to my family\nso this is where\nyou know\nis this person kind of pointed out\nit's a lot to absorb\nright so this is also where if you think\nabout issues of gender identity and you\nthink about the time scale that the\nindividual has to come to terms with\ntheir gender identity\nis usually a lot\ngreater than what their family has\nright so like if i've been struggling\nwith my gender identity since the age of\nthree\nand then on my 19th birthday i come out\nto my parents as\ntransgender\ni've had 16 years\nto like figure that out right and then\nlike six months later my parents\nhaven't nearly had that much time\ni mean they haven't had like they've had\nsix months\nand you've had 16 years\nso it is a lot for people to process\nthey have certain conceptions of you\nright they have certain maybe hopes or\ndreams or things like that so parents\noftentimes have to go through when i'm\ntrying to help parents\ndevelop healthy relationships with their\ntransgender children\nwill actually go through a mourning\nprocess and i i've done this also with\nparents who have special needs kids\nso i'm not trying to say that trans and\nspecial needs is the same my point is\nthat both of these kinds of situations\nare a parent will develop a conception\nor even non-special needs kids you know\njust kids who decide not to become\ndoctors with indian parents\nso there's a mourning process that\nparents need to go through where they\nhad all these ideas of like for example\nit seems like you know you're\nbiologically\nyou're born as a man\nand you know you're a transgender woman\nso your\nyou know your\ndad or mom\nmay\nlike your mom have had may have had all\nthese dreams and and kind of like\nhopes about what she was going to do\nwith her daughter-in-law and she was\ngoing to have these daughter-in-law spa\nweekends and all this kind of stuff\nright so your parents have like built up\nall these conceptions which it takes\ntime\nto like let go and mourn so i think it's\nhealthy for parents to like mourn that\nkind of stuff\nand then you as their child should try\nto be as patient as you can\nso that's the first thing is to\nrecognize that the timeline that you've\nhad to deal with this change and the\ntimeline that your parents have had to\ndeal with this change is probably\ndifferent or your immediate family\nthe next thing\nto consider\nis that often times when you're trying\nto get your parents to understand that's\nthe experience that i've had with a lot\nof\ntrans people is that they're struggling\nto get their\nparents\ntheir family to understand right like\nthey they their lack of compassion and\nunderstanding is very disheartening\nwhich i completely get\nso this is where\nit's it's foreign to them so it's going\nto be hard for them to understand\nso i know this sounds kind of weird but\noften times what i think is almost like\na mistake or if it's not a mistake it's\njust you need to think a little bit\nabout whether this is the primary thing\nyou should be doing at this time is\ninstead of trying to explain to them\nwhat your experience is try to\nunderstand their experience this is the\nsecond thing that you can do\nso i would start with questions like\nthis so when i work with families these\nare the kinds of questions i'll ask as a\ntherapist in the room\nwhich kind of brings people together\nright which is that so now that you're\nyou've discovered that you know this\nperson who you thought of as a son is\nactually like your daughter\nwhat is that like for you what does it\nmean for you that if i'm a woman instead\nof a man\nwhat is the significance of that and you\ncan even dig into some of the stuff\nthat's actually really hurtful right so\nthis is like this is the hardest thing\nis that sometimes family members will\ntry to like slot you into their\nconception so once i have a conception\nof what your life should be like and\nthis has nothing to i mean this goes way\nbeyond you know being trans or special\nneeds or whatever so if i'm a parent\nand i have a conception\ni am a baseball coach\nand i want my son to be a star baseball\nplayer\ncan be you know trans expectations you\ncan have sports expectations\nyou can have\ncareer expectations\nright and to be fair not all of these\nhave the same\nlevel of difficulty in terms of\nadjustment so i think coming to terms\nwith the fact that your child is of a\ndifferent gender\nrequires a lot\ni would hope a larger shift than someone\nwho doesn't want to be a professional\nathlete\nif\nthat's bad if that's the scale of change\nthat a professional change is but\nand so they have this like conception of\nwhat they want you to be and you don't\nwant to be that thing right so they they\ngrew like when you were two years old\nyou got your first catchers mitt\nand they threw the ball around with you\nevery single day and then you're like\nactually i don't like\nbaseball\ni like\nfortnight\nand then what your parents do is they\ntry to slot you back in there\nright so your parents may say things\nlike\nyou know pretty unaccepting things like\ntry to date girls work out more take\ntestosterone so it'll fix you it'll be\nlike you know they're like\nget back into the box we put this box\nfor you\nand you need to\ninject yourself with a hormone\nand then get back into the box\nright because\nif you have to inject yourself with\nhormones that's really you know that's\nthat's how you know what's natural and\nwhat is suiting suited to you\nso this can happen a lot where parents\nlike just don't understand you and so\nthey try to like they're trying to make\nsense of it they're trying to like make\nit work in their head so they'll try to\npush you into a particular thing and\nthat's where i would you know once again\nask them questions so i would start with\nlike questions like\nyou know if i dated girls what do you\nthink that would change\nright how would that affect me how would\nthat affect you what effect do you think\ndating girls would have if i started\nworking out more like what do you think\nwould happen\njust ask them open-ended questions in a\nnon-judgmental way and oftentimes i find\nthis is the best way to like\nexpose their ignorance\nright so when they're unable to provide\nanswers to these questions and they may\nprovide answers like yeah like once you\nwork out more like it'll just become\nclear\nand then like i would dig in a little\nbit help me understand that so you seem\nreally confident that what will become\nclear\nyou know like\nand then let's say your dad does work\nout doesn't work out\ndo you feel like\nwhen you work out like do you feel like\nthat's when you feel like a man like do\nyou feel like a man\nat other times too like what is your\nunderstanding like how do you know\nyou're a man so i would just start to\nask lots of questions right so try to\nunderstand their viewpoint and as you\nask questions and as you sort of like\ntry to understand their viewpoint that's\ngoing to do a couple of really important\nthings\nthe first\nis that it'll establish a dialogue of\ncuriosity and understanding instead of\ntrying to convince people or force\npeople or whatever so you're going to be\nmodeling for them that hey like i'm here\nto listen i'm here to try to understand\nand it opens the door for them to\nreciprocate huge\nthis is why people go to licensed\ntherapists because like therapists\nestablish a foundation of like curiosity\nand openness and understanding\nsecond thing it'll do is it'll start to\nhelp you understand how to talk to them\nbecause once you understand their their\nunderstanding of how the world works\nthat like transgender issues can just be\nfixed with testosterone like gender\nidentity issues can be fixed and then so\nyou know you can be a little bit\ninquisitive about that be like did you\nneed to take testosterone to understand\nthat you were a man\nand then like\nevery once in a while this is where\nthings get good every once in a while\nsomeone will say yes\nand your dad will be like yeah i went\nthrough a very similar thing started\nshooting myself up with testosterone and\nthat's how i learned how to be a man i\nswear to god every once in a while you\nhave that and then it's an eye-opening\nmoment\nright\nand it's like wait a minute\nmaybe my dad has gone through something\nsimilar\nright maybe this is why he's terrified\nbecause he's spent his entire life\ntrying to convince himself that he's\ncisgender\ni swear to god this happens every once\nin a while it happens\nbut it brings people together right and\nso like it works for your dad now he\ndoesn't take the testosterone shots he\nfeels like secure in his masculinity\nlike whatever\nthat you'll be amazed like so i've seen\nthis all the time with like especially\nthings like drug abuse and\ni've seen this with patients who have to\nget abortions or thinking about getting\nabortions and stuff like that they had\nno idea\nright like this\ni don't want to go into too much detail\nfor patient privacy so i'll be a little\nbit chimerical\nbut there was one kid i was working with\nwho had a parent who was very\ncontrolling\nand then like parent really didn't a kid\ndidn't really know much about like\nparent in their\nlate teens early 20s so a parent grew up\nin the 60s\nokay so like back in the kind of good\nold days of the 60s and they showed\ntheir kid kid was going through a drug\nproblem showed their kid\na picture of them like at woodstock or\nsomething like that i don't remember the\nexact festival and like prompted such an\nawesome conversation where like the\nreason the parent was like so\nrestrictive against drugs is because\ndrugs really screwed up their life and\nthey were totally into it and like\nmessed things up and all kinds of stuff\nso like it's facilitated some surprising\nsharing\nso what you want to do is ask questions\nright\nask questions try to get them to\nunderstand like explain to me like what\ndo you think is going to happen if i do\nthis this or this\nright\nso if you've tried dating girls for\nexample you can even ask them\nwhat's your understanding of like\nwho i've dated and like what that\nexperience was like\nright and like so you can try to try to\nunderstand their perspective and\nhopefully what will happen is usually\nwhat happens in my experience if you\nsort of approach things non-judgmentally\nand really try to understand them\nwhat you'll discover is that there's not\na whole lot of foundation to their\nbeliefs or they have some kind of\npersonal investment\nand you can even acknowledge that so\nlike for example if you're a\nmale to female\nif you're going through a male to female\ntransition and your mom really wanted to\nhave a daughter-in-law right because\nshe's got\ntwo sons and so she was really looking\nforward to having a son i mean a\ndaughter-in-law because she wanted to\nhave daughter-in-law's spa trips that's\nwhere you can like talk to her about\nthat and it's like what's it like for\nyou for you to not have that like what\ndo you think about like me and you going\non a spot trip\nright because like yeah instead of\nhaving two sons now you have a son now\nyou have a daughter like\nyou know i'd like to do that with you\nwhat it like you know those kinds of\nthings are the kinds of\nmoments and discussions and connections\nwhich i think that\nin\ndiscussions of like gender identity like\nwe just lose sight of\nand so try to just really understand\ntheir perspective\nand then if you're lucky if you're\nblessed if you're lucky\nif you set the right kind of foundation\nand you\ntry to genuinely understand their\nperspective even acknowledge their\nperspective\nyou can watch the communication workshop\nby the way that's a video on our youtube\nchannel that is hard to understand but\nit's really good if you can understand\nit\nthen hopefully they'll start to try to\nunderstand you and then you can start\nexplaining\nbut generally speaking\npeople i it's been my experience that\nlike you know someone has to be in the\nright frame of mind they have to have an\nopen mind to be able to really hear your\nwords\nand what i find too often in in\nconversations between parents and kids\nis that the parents will have a\nconception kid doesn't agree with that\nconception and the parent is not really\nin a frame of mind to listen to what the\nkid has to say\nso it's like it's a flight that you know\nnever gets off the ground basically\nbecause they're and then then it leads\nto increasing frustration resentment\nyou're not listening you're not\nlistening you're not understanding\nyou're not understanding\nand then you push and you push and then\nno one feels understood and then like\nmesses up the communication and then we\ngo to things like lying and avoidance\nand let's just pretend and like all this\nkind of other\nband-aid sort of solutions that don't\nactually fix the problem\nand there are a couple of questions you\ncan do to facilitate that\nyou know is some of those are really\nsimple questions they're like do you\nwant to understand what my experience is\nand that's when the parent says yes\nand that's when you can ask okay what's\nyour understanding so far\nand then they'll say well i think you're\njust confused okay what have i said\nif i said that i feel confused at all\nlike well no but you're just confused\nokay\nso now you can see why i have difficulty\nwith this conversation because i'm\nsaying something and i understand that\nyou think i'm confused\nbut do you see how from my perspective\nit doesn't seem like you're really\nlistening at all all you're doing is\nsharing your opinion does that make\nsense to you\nright because you're not really\nacknowledging what i'm saying\nand you don't have to get into whether\nyou're trans are not trans you can sort\nof focus on the communication issue of\nthe words that i'm speaking are not\nbeing received it's like i'm\ntransmitting this signal\nbut the signal is like not getting\nreceived\nand so what should we do about that\nyou can even ask your parents what\nshould we do about that\nwell you should just\ntake a testosterone shot and that'll fix\nthe problem it's like yeah i don't think\ni'm gonna do that\nright so this is it's a problem for me\nbecause i'm i'm feeling like\ncommunication is really important for us\nand that it's not really happening i'm\nnot sure what else i can do\nso if you're in this situation where you\nknow you're coming out as trans or\nanything else that breaks away from your\nparents conception to summarize a couple\nof things to keep in mind\nthe first is that you probably have had\nmore time to come to terms with this\nthan they have\nand sometimes the amount of time that\nyou've had is\nlike orders of magnitude higher right\nwe're talking years versus weeks or\nmonths\ndecade\nversus\nthree months\nso try to be as patient as you can\nsecond thing is remember that\nthey may have to go through some amount\nof mourning or adjustment\nand that talking to them about what that\nexperience is like can be like very\nhelpful so\nand then what we want to do is sort of\ncreate this environment this sort of\nfoundation of like curiosity and\nunderstanding so instead of trying to\nget them to understand you what you need\nto do is understand that\nwhat does this mean for you if i'm trans\nwhat do you think this means for my life\nare you worried about me not worried\nabout me do you think i'm going to be\nhappy do you think i'm not going to be\nhappy\ndo you think i'm confused like help me\nunderstand that like where do you get\nthe idea that i'm confused\noh i see because i don't understand\nthings the way that you understand them\nyou're coming to the conclusion that i'm\nconfused\nwhat's your understanding of how long\ni've been thinking about this\nand what this journey has been like for\nme\nso you want to start with curiosity\nyou know try to understand their\nperspective and hopefully what they'll\ndo you'll model that behavior and then\nthey'll start to be open-minded towards\nyou\nthey may have to do some mourning\nthen if you're lucky\nat some point they'll want to understand\nyour experience and they'll start to ask\nyou questions and as they ask you\nquestions they're actually going to be\nopen-minded enough to listen to your\nanswers\nthe challenge is that for a lot of\npeople who are trying to get their\nparents to adjust to some change in in\nmy life if i'm trying to get my parents\nto adjust i'm impatient\nright i want them to adjust now\nlast thing that i'll say is that\nsometimes your parents are right\nright not necessarily saying for gender\nidentity but like\nsometimes your parents are right so i've\nseen this especially when it comes into\nlike premature relationships especially\nthings like marriage\nwhere your parents are like you're like\nthis is my partner i've known them for\nsix weeks and we're in love and we're\ngonna get married i need you to accept\nthem unconditionally\nyour parents are like well\nthey're kind of an [ __ ]\nno\nsupport me unconditionally this is my\nchoice i choose my choice\neither you need to accept them or we're\ndone\nit's like\n18 months later you get divorced and\nyour parents are kind of like\nyou know they don't say it like i told\nyou so\nso sometimes you should also remember i\nmean hopefully you have this kind of\nrelationship with your parents where\nthey really do love you and they really\ndo care about you\nand their hesitation doesn't necessarily\nmean that and this is what we're seeing\nmore and more with the internet\nright it's like i'll post about\nsomething on the internet\nand\nyou know i'll it'll be full of my\ncognitive biases and i'll get\nlike\nall kinds of support from the echo\nchamber and then i get really really\nupset by my nuclear family when they\ndon't support me the same way\nis this echo chamber on the internet\nwell there's like more to it than that\nright\nso hopefully you know what what i would\nstrongly strongly recommend\nis that you facilitate conversation and\nyou be patient and give them time\nit's possible that things don't end up\ngoing well that they really don't want\nto understand or they're not going to\ntry to understand in which case you have\nmy condolences\nbut this is the other unfortunate thing\nis you can't force someone\nto understand\nright that's something that you can't do\nthe best you can do is sort of tee\nthings up for the highest probability of\nthat happening\nso you got to be careful\nyou"
