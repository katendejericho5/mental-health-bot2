    "transcript": "see a lot of people don't realize that\nbeing truthful in life actually makes\nyour life better and makes you more\npowerful so if we think about lying\nlying is all about the avoidance of\nconsequences and if lying is about the\navoidance of consequences then you can\ncontinue engaging in behavior that you\ndon't have to pay the consequences for\nand you should be because usually more\ninefficient whatever it is going\nabsolutely and so the really interesting\nthing is that when when I kind of like\nstopped lying I think it maybe once in a\nblue moon I'll lie like I want to say\nmaybe two or three times a year but are\nyou lying right now I don't think so\nmaybe this is one of the two or three um\nbut but what I really found is that once\nyou stop lying it changes your behavior\nso if you take lying off of the table\nthe way that you have to live your life\nchanges when I was a kid I lied\nconstantly and I realized over time I\nlike this is a lot of energy to like\nupkeep all this because you're\nconstantly like trying to spin the\nplates on like which lie did you tell to\nwho and it just turns into this web of\njust like why it's ridiculously wasted\nenergy"
