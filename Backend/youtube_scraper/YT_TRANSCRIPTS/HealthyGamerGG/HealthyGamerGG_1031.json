    "transcript": "so what tends to happen is sometimes\nwhen we lose sight of ourselves\nwe try to hold on to the echoes of who\nwe used to be what comes from inside so\na lot of like motivation desire\nexcitement\nthese are the kinds of things that come\nfrom the inside you can't really like\nlogic your way to being fulfilled right\nlike you can't just like logic your way\nto like being motivated right so like\nmaybe in your teenage years you were\nexcited about stuff\nand you were like oh it'd be cool to do\nthis or cool to do this you know now\nwith the pandemic if you're a teenager\nnow that can actually be really\nchallenging because it's hard to be\nexcited the problem here is that once\nyou lose sight of your internal voice\nand we'll talk a little bit about what\nthat is and where that comes from the\nbest that we have is intellect to guide\nus\n[Music]\nokay the image of the person i thought i\nam got destroyed and now i feel dead\ninside\nhi the story is\nlong but maybe it's is not all needed to\ngive you the answer so i'll keep it\nshort i'm over 30 now i was or i thought\ni am the person i know and like\nfor over 20 years and then something\nhappened\nit destroyed the image i had of myself i\nwas not sure who i am at this moment i\ndidn't know what to do and i think i i\nslowly was going closer to do what the\nperson i knew before would do\nand then something happened again that\nstabbed that image again i feel dead\ninside i think i don't feel it every day\nthough\ni even thought i'm okay\ni thought i'm okay to this point and and\nthat i was thinking about being a\nrecovery coach because i went through\nsome stuff and and i'm okay now\ntoday i started thinking that what i\nwould say if i told dr k all my story i\ngot to some point i started thinking\nabout it i realized i'm not okay\nhow can i help someone if i'm not okay i\nmiss the person if i was and if i'm not\nthat person i feel dead inside because\nit is like that person i thought i am is\ndead\ni'm scared to try to be me i knew again\nbecause i tried twice and all it did was\nto hurt me again\ni feel like i don't know if the person i\nthought i was was even real i don't know\nwho i am now nothing matters but i don't\nwant to kill myself because i don't even\nknow who is that myself\nlife goes on and i pretend even to be\nmyself that everything is okay until the\nmoment like this happens when i realize\nhow i feel\nwhat do you think about it what would\nyou suggest for first time people\nwelcome\nso i know that um\nthis post can sound a little bit\nconfusing but let's start by trying to\nunderstand a little bit about what this\nperson is experiencing\nso oftentimes\nwhat can be challenging for us is that\nwe have a sense of who we are\nand the sense of self kind of hopefully\ndevelops like early on during\nadolescence or teenage years then we\nfor many of us we kind of feel pretty\ngood when we're 20.\nand then our 20s are actually\ncharacterized by some sense of like loss\nor some sense of losing sight of who you\nare some sense of the world kind of\nkicking in and sort of like\nbecause because things in when you're a\nteenager can be sort of bright and fun\nand then when your 20s sort of roll in\nyou can sort of lose sight of that\nbright hopeful person you used to be\nand then what ends up happening is we\nsort of try to hold on to that person\nright so like that person used to be\nlike excited to do things they used to\nbe excited about the future the world\nwas filled with opportunity\nand so then what happens is we start to\nlike things can happen if we kind of pay\nattention to this post it sounds like\nthis person had a couple of setbacks and\nthen we when we have setbacks we sort of\nlose sight of our positive self\nand then we're kind of left with this\nvacuum of like not being internally\nmotivated because like that person feels\nlike they're gone and all of my\nmotivation came from that person\nand then we run into a separate problem\nwhich is that like once we lose track of\nkind of our inner self right that inner\nkind of guiding force\nthen what we try to do is we try to\nfigure out okay how am i supposed to\nnavigate now like if i don't know kind\nof who i am or where i am or or what i\nshould be moving towards\nhow do i figure out like where to go if\ni don't feel naturally excited about\nanything\nand then what we do is we cling to our\nimage of former self well that person\nback when they were 20 years old would\nhave done this that person would have\ndone this and that person would have\ndone this so we try to like hold on to\nthe memory of who we were\nthe funny thing is that as we hold on to\nthe memory of who we were it kind of\nstarts to feel like life is very like\nartificial because there's no actual\ninternal drive anymore right it's sort\nof like i want you all to just kind of\nthink about a really simple analogy\nwhich is let's say that i'm really\nreally craving to eat a particular kind\nof food and i remember that craving that\ncraving is super super strong and i\nreally really want to eat that food and\nthen as i start to eat it i start to get\nsatisfied and then the craving kind of\ngoes down\nand then\nmy desire to eat doesn't really like\nisn't there anymore right because in\nthis situation it's been satisfied\nbut then what sort of happens is that if\ni continue\nholding on to that relic of what i\nwanted before and i think to myself oh\nlike this food made me happy before so\nlet me eat it again let me eat it again\nlet me eat it again it's not going to\nbring you the same kind of joy\nso what tends to happen is sometimes\nwhen we lose sight of ourselves\nwe try to hold on to the echoes of who\nwe used to be\nand in holding on to the person that we\nused to be\nwe actually end up getting ourselves\nstuck\nright because that's not who we are\nanymore\nand yet we're kind of stuck between this\nrock and a hard place because i don't\nreally know who i am so how do i move\nforward because that internal voice\nisn't there anymore but the best i've\ngot right because that's like the best\nyou've got is like the memory of who you\nused to be and so then you start to\nchase after that kind of thing\nand yet like even if you try to chase\nafter it that internal motivation isn't\nthere so you can start to chase after it\nbut your actual productivity your actual\nenjoyment your actual ability to\ntolerate difficult circumstances without\nthat internal drive all of that becomes\nmore difficult\nand so then what happens is even if\nwe're chasing after the echo of who we\nused to be\nour productivity our performance our\nyield from our efforts tends to be very\nvery low and that in turn\ncauses us to lose more motivation right\nbecause now i'm like trying and i'm\ntrying i tried this i tried this i tried\nthis it's not working it's not working\nit's not where i want to be it's not\nwhere i thought i would be it's not\nwhere where i wish i was\nand then we sort of get like kind of\nlike lost and then we kind of feel stuck\nand we don't really feel like doing\nanything\nso how do we sort of get out of this\nsituation of kind of feeling dead inside\nand furthermore once i feel dead inside\nchoosing what to do based on the echo of\nwho i used to be right because like all\ni remember what i used to like so maybe\ni'll just kind of try to do that again\nbecause that seemed to work at some\npoint\nright so the real solution to this is to\ndiscover who you are now and that's kind\nof easier said than done but we'll kind\nof walk you through how to do that\nbecause the problem here is that once\nyou lose sight of your internal voice\nand we'll talk a little bit about what\nthat is and where that comes from the\nbest that we have is intellect to guide\nus\nthe problem is that intellect is not\nlike something that gives you\nfulfillment right intellect can analyze\nbut it can't provide enjoyment our mind\nmay be able to give us like some amount\nof pleasure through dopamine but it\ncan't provide us with like\nlife satisfaction\nso then what starts to happen is we\nstart to live a very surface level life\nand the more we drown ourselves in a\nsurface level life the further we get\naway from our kind of deeper self our\ntrue self whatever that\npart of ourselves that brings\nfulfillment and then we kind of get\nstuck in this situation where we're not\nreally sure what to do we don't have an\ninternal compass\nbut all we know is which way the compass\nused to be pointing so we go in that\ndirection and hope that things will work\nout\nso how can we understand how to overcome\nthis situation okay let's break it down\nso\nokay\nlet's take a look at this so if you are\ndead inside\nnope work\nno hold on\nhold on\ntech support\nokay\ngood\nall right\nso let's map out this problem\nso i'm\nif you feel dead inside\nso let's first understand what that\nmeans dead inside\nhow does someone be dead on the inside\nokay so there's some psychiatric issues\nso for example there's something called\nthe cotard delusion\nwhich you know hopefully this person\ndoesn't have and we have really no way\nof knowing that it doesn't sound like it\nso cotard delusion just interesting\nfactoid so the cotard delusion is a\nparticular kind of delusional syndrome\nwhere you believe a part of your body or\norgan is like dead so i'll feel like oh\nlike my stomach is actually dead or like\nmy arm is dead like it's like dead flesh\nit's kind of weird it's sort of a\nmisinterpretation\nby your\nbrain of\nproprioception\nexceedingly rare so this is like\nmisinterpretation of like internal\nbodily signals okay so when we say dead\ninside the first thing to understand\nthere is a little bit of a differential\ndiagnosis here we're not diagnosing\nanything by the way\nbut\num\nso sometimes there are like conditions\nthat will\nmake you feel like literally dead inside\nbut most of the time what we sort of\nmean is that there's sort of this inner\nself\nthat we lose track of\nso if you think about like what comes\nfrom inside so a lot of like motivation\ndesire excitement these are the kinds of\nthings that come from the inside okay\nand when we kind of talk a little bit\nabout inside let's let's try to think a\nlittle bit about what are the different\nrealms of self okay\nso in our core if you ask the yogis\nthere's something called turiya\nand so thuria is our innermost being and\ndurya has some of these qualities of\nit's also kind of the thuria technically\nin sanskrit means fourth\nstate\nor other state\nso this is kind of a state of\nconsciousness that is beyond the other\nstates of consciousness so they sort of\nmeant is that you know we've got durya\nover here and then we've got sort of\nthis area over here where\npurpose\nfulfillment\ninspiration\ncomes from like a deeper part of our\nmind and then above that we have sort of\nour surface level mind and in the\nsurface level mind we get things like\ndopamine or\ndopaminergic stuff\npleasure\nenjoyment\nemotions\nright sadness\nthoughts\nso this is kind of our surface level of\nmind so when people say i feel dead in\nthe inside what i oftentimes find that\nthese people are experiencing is they're\nstuck up here\nin this area of mind so their experience\nof life is highly mental\nas opposed to like\nbelow the mind is like inspiration\nfulfillment you can't really like logic\nyour way to being fulfilled right like\nyou can't just like logic your way to\nlike being motivated you can't kind of\nthink your way to being motivated sure\nyou can do mental work that will help\nyou with your motivation sure\nbut generally speaking they're kind of\nstuck on this this surface mental level\nso their lives are kind of you know\ndictated by dopamine the chasing of\ndopamine\nso that we can get away from the other\nnegative thoughts\nright so\nat this surface level of mind they're\ndoing their level best to be at this end\ninstead of this end so this is like the\npositive end this is the negative end\nbut the whole point is that they stay\nover here and they lose track of the\ninner self okay\nand so then what happens is once we lose\ntrack of the inner self and this sort of\nhappens as we kind of develop right so\nas we're kids\nwe're closer to these parts and and\ntheoretically even have some access to\nthuria so this is a state that can be\nattained from sort of advanced\nmeditation and things like that\nso then what happens is we lose track so\nlike our inner desi like our inner\ndrives come from a deeper level of mind\nright so like maybe in your teenage\nyears you were excited about stuff\nand you were like oh it'd be cool to do\nthis or cool to do this you know now\nwith the pandemic if you're a teenager\nnow that can actually be really\nchallenging because it's hard to be\nexcited\nand then when you lose track of your\ndrives then what happens is you hold on\nto the memory of your drives and then\nyou try to get motivated\ntowards\nold drives\nand this this sort of is a problem\nbecause what this actually ends up doing\nis making you stuck\nbecause you're a different person now\nright like you're not the same person\nyou weren't 10 years ago you've grown\nyou've changed you've maybe become more\ndespairing like growth doesn't\nnecessarily have to be positive in you\nknow in all of its emotional valence\nright so you like a different person if\nyou just try to repeat the old thing\nover and over again what that's going to\ndo is end up\nmaking you stuck\nso instead what we've got to do is is if\nwe've gotten stuck up here\nright and we've sort of lost track of\nour inner voice what we need to do is\nessentially learn how to move further\ndown this way\nright so we need to move beyond the mind\nsort of to the level of drive\nand then ideally\neven find some experience of thuria\nand if we can do that then like the cool\nthing is we'll find that natural\nmotivation again\nokay\nso\nthe main thing here the tricky thing is\nlike how do we lose track of this and i\nthink what we've learned how to do or\nwe've what we've forgotten how to do as\na society is listen to ourselves so the\ncore thing that we have to do to get\ndown here\nis listen\nto our self\nnow\nlet's think a little bit about why we\nhave forgotten as a society to listen to\nourselves\nthe first\nis that sometimes down here we have\nunpleasant stuff\nso when we have unpleasant stuff down\nhere what does the mind want to do it\nwants to go back up here\nand now the problem nowadays is that\ngoing back up here has become way too\neasy\nso it used to be that like the amount of\nlike dopamine you could get 500 years\nago\nwas like limited right so like let's say\ni'm a farmer in like europe\nand it turns out that like i can only\ndistract myself kind of so much like\nmaybe i was the village drunk so like\nthat's a good example of people who were\nlike really really you know good at\ndistracting themselves but there just\nwasn't that much fun stuff to do there\nmay be like a festival or you may be\nable to like play you know a sport or\nsomething like that but generally\nspeaking like you couldn't automatically\nreturn to a positive dopaminergic state\nof mind whereas nowadays with all of our\ntechnology\nit becomes really really easy to forget\nto listen to yourself right so like and\nthink about it this way\nif i'm like playing a video game for\neight hours\nthink about all of the internal signals\nthat i'm suppressing when i do that\nright when i binge watch a tv show or\nspend hours just like binge watching\nlike chain watching crap on social media\nor switch from youtube to reddit and\nthen do some instagram and then do a\nlittle bit of tick tock and like you\nknow like doom scrolling right like we\ncan just doom scroll for hours and the\nother thing that happens when we do\nscroll is we're also\nmoving over here\nfrom the negative to the positive the\nfunny thing is that even doom scrolling\ncan sometimes create negative emotions\nso sometimes we're actually doomed\nscrolling goes this way\nright this is when i'm looking at\npictures of my ex\nor reading about how everything in the\nworld is going to hell i actually engage\nmy negative emotional mind so why does\nour mind do it if if it's sort of\nnegative emotion and that's because it's\nmoving away from the internal self so\nthe mind just loves to be occupied the\nmind sort of doesn't care\nwhether it's like\nit's lost in sadness or like lost in\nhappiness what it wants to do is be lost\nin an emotion and like forget about the\ninternal self the mind loves that\nokay\nso then then we sort of get into the\nsituation where it's like it's so easy\nto move away from ourselves\nand so now what we have to do\nunfortunately is like\ngetting in touch with yourself is now\nbecoming like a harder thing to do it\ndidn't used to require like training\nright so we've had training for it for\nthousands and thousands of years right\nthese are what the yogis in ancient\nindia discovered buddha sort of\npopularized right and then buddhism\nspread throughout east asia and then is\nnow like spreading across you know the\nwestern civilization western hemisphere\nso there are skills for this but that we\ndidn't need them before now with the\nadvent of technology this is why like\nyou know so many people are into\nmeditation now because you need to\ncounteract this this\nforce that moves you away from your\ninternal self and then once again down\nhere we've got thuria okay\nso how do we do this\nthe first thing that i'd recommend is\nthat if you're in the situation where\nyou feel dead inside\ngo\nget\na mental health evaluation\nthe first thing you should do\nokay\nwhy is that it's it's to understand that\nsometimes\nthe feeling of being dead inside is\nactually contributed to by a psychiatric\ncondition\nright so we mentioned the cotard\ndelusion kind of as an aside it's\nexceedingly rare i don't think you know\nlikely that a single person is watching\nthis as having the quarter delusion is\nvery very low right it's like i don't\nthink that's actually what's going on\nbut you may have some degree of\ndepression\nright you could have something like an\natypical depression\nyou may have something like a seasonal\naffective disorder\nthere could be all kinds of things going\non and remember that like when it comes\nto clinical depression\nyou know like something like 20 to\n35 of the population will experience\nthis\nso this this number is like very high\nright\nand the cool thing here is that there\ncould actually be treatment for this\nright so there may be like neurochemical\nsignals\nthat are altered in your brain that make\nit hard for you to connect to your\ninternal self\nso that feeling of despair that feeling\nof like lack of motivation and stuff\nthere could actually be some kind of\nneurochemical imbalance that could be\nsort of a psychiatric condition going on\nand that's the kind of thing where it's\nlike unless you sort of get that fixed\nthen the rest of it is going to be very\nvery hard so i'd actually start with a\nmental health evaluation\nand this too if we kind of look at this\nyou know\ni went through some stuff and i'm okay\nnow this is really important because\neven if you're okay\ndoesn't mean that you're like healed or\nfixed right so this is where like it's\nsort of like if you you know if i if i\nbreak a bone\nand i don't set it and fix it properly\neventually like the bone will heal\nand i'll be able to like walk again\nlet's say i like broke a bone in my leg\nlike i can walk again it's just gonna\nyou know it's not gonna be like ideal\nlike it'll be a little bit harder to\nwalk it'll take more energy it'll be a\nlittle bit more painful it'll be harder\nto climb stairs and so in that way\nmental injuries to us and this person\nsort of says like you know they got\ntheir internal image has been stabbed so\nmental injuries to us also try to heal\nnaturally\nbut much like physical injuries they\ndon't necessarily heal the right way\nautomatically right they sort of like\nscab over whereas like you can sort of\nmentally reset your mind as well if you\nkind of heal properly\na good example of this is trauma so like\nour body will adapt and equilibriate to\ntrauma but that doesn't mean that it's\nactually healing properly we'll sort of\nlike develop new habits distrust for\nother human beings which is what will\nhappen after we get traumatized and\nthat's like that's sort of a natural\nadaptation to the injury but it doesn't\nactually make it an ideal healing\nso it's kind of a no-brainer but i'd say\nstart with a mental health evaluation\nbecause i'm not i didn't see anything in\nhere that this person had gotten that\nokay\nso\num\nnext thing that we need to do\nso remember the goal here for the next\nsteps two three four and five\nare going to be to like\nrebuild your relationship with your\ninternal self okay\nso now we're gonna do is rebuild\nour connection to self\nso\nthis can be done in a manner of\ndifferent like introspective spiritual\nkind of things but we're actually going\nto start with what's easiest so there's\nthis very simple principle from kind of\nlike eastern spirituality that you start\nwith the body because the body is the\nmost accessible\nso what we're gonna do is get our body\nactive\nand you may say okay what does that mean\nget it active it means just do anything\nthat's active do anything that your body\nwill send you signals\nokay that's what we want to do we just\nwant to be receiving signals so a good\nexample of this is let's say we go for a\njog\nif you go for a jog and you're huffing\nand puffing\nafter five minutes\nyou may think to yourself oh my god i'm\nscrewing up so bad i'm so out of shape\nthat's not the point you're doing\nfantastic if you're huffing and puffing\nbecause what's happening in that moment\nis you are reconnecting with internal\nsignals even if you're huffing and\npuffing\nyou can go cycling\nyou can do push-ups you can go for a\nswim you can just get your body active\nstart to re-engage this sort of like you\nknow this is the mind and there's stuff\nbeneath the mind and when you're huffing\nand puffing you're not going to be\nthinking about anything right you're\ngoing to be like retouching with your\ninternal body\nsignals you're going to kind of get like\ngetting back in touch with them\nokay so just get your body active just\ndo something with your body and the goal\nhere is just to like get feel stuff from\nyour body if you want to exercise go for\nit that has the added benefit so that's\nlike good right so i'd say like try to\ndo some exercise\nand\nyeah\nsmall f okay we okay saved saved okay\nnext thing that we want to do\nin terms of\ngetting in touch with our body this is\ngonna be great\nis eat food\nokay so start with the body but once\nagain what you want to do is watch your\nbody's signals in response to the food\nso we want to do is\nengage\ninternal signals\nso you're going to eat foods that you\nlike\nbut before you eat them you're going to\npay attention and grab the food that you\nwant to eat you're going to stick it in\nfront of you in a plate and i want you\nto first of all notice the craving\nnotice the desire\nthen you're gonna start screwing with\nyour mind you ready and then you're\ngonna say to yourself with this food\nthat is in front of you hey\ni'm not gonna eat it\ni may eat something healthy instead\ni'm assuming that what you want is\nunhealthy\nwhich is maybe\nsomething else\nand watch what your mind does\nright like\nno no because because here you are\nand here's the mind and we say no no\nwe're gonna we're gonna move in this\ndirection towards the healthy food and\nthe mind is like no no no give me this\ngive me this i want to eat it i want to\neat it i want to eat it okay\nand that's okay like we're not going to\npunish our mind but just notice what\nhappens within yourself so now already\nlike when you do that what like it's\nreally subtle but it's it's huge what\nthis practice does this practice puts\nyou\ndown here\nas you are watching the mind\nright so we've got our observer which is\nlike looking in this direction\nso now we're like looking at the mind\nand we're just kind of screwing with it\nand then what you want to do is eat\nsomething that you dislike\nright so you can eat the thing that you\nlike but once again what we're going to\ndo is pay attention to like as the mind\nas we tell the mind hey we're moving\nthis direction it's going to want to\nwant to move over here and even if you\neat it's important to eat the food that\nyou dislike why is that because you need\nto experience the dislike\nthat's really important\nso experience the dislike\nwhat when we experience the dislike what\nwe're going to do\nis move in this direction does that make\nsense\nbecause now our body is like telling us\nlike you're getting tastes you're\ngetting flavors it's not just thoughts\nthere's going to be an experience of\ndislike\nokay\nand the likes will become the dislikes\nand all that that's la that's a\ndifferent\nchapter okay we're not worried about\nthat right now\nwhat we want to do is just get back in\ntouch with our internal signals\nright so then what's happening is like\nwhether we experience likes or dislikes\nnow what we've got is like a better\nunderstanding of motivation towards food\nover here\nokay\nso now like even if you dislike stuff\ndeep down here\nit's still waking up right it's not dead\nanymore it's sending you bad signals\nlike i don't like this but that's okay\nwe're getting signals that's the\nimportant thing\nokay\nnow as you guys do this now comes the\nadvanced part so there's gonna be like\nsort of an advanced part and the last\npart is actually gonna be super super\nbasic which is gonna be our meditation\nfor the day\nnow our advanced part is as we get in\ntouch with the likes and dislikes down\nhere\ni want you to notice what\ndirects\nmy thoughts\ntry to answer this question okay so this\nis like more inquisitive in nature\nso like once you get\nin touch with it's kind of hard to\ndescribe but you're going to have all\nkinds of thoughts up here\nyou're going to have desires that want\nto move in this direction you're going\nto have desires\nthat want to move in this direction\nyou're going to have different kinds of\nactions\nright i want to do this i want to do\nthis you can have all this crap going on\nup here\nand then down here you're going to have\nyour drives\nbut like what actually controls your\nactions what controls your thoughts\nwhen you end up doing something are you\noperating from up here are you operating\nfrom down here\nand this is where you're gonna say like\nyeah i mean i don't really know i don't\nreally understand the question even and\nthat's actually totally fine this is why\nyou need to lay out the landscape of\nlike how the [ __ ] you work on the inside\nand the way that we're gonna do this is\njust by creating signals and like\nlearning like where these signals come\nfrom is this my mind is this my body is\nthis an internal drive\nright is it emotions like who knows\nthe whole point of this is so that you\nunderstand like how how to control this\nthing that you are\nokay\nright so like listen to your heart like\nhow do you do that we're gonna figure\nout are you actually listening to your\nheart what's your heart saying and it's\nokay if you're being controlled by\ndopamine like that's actually not a\nproblem right now the main thing is to\nunderstand it okay\nthen we get to number five\nso i'm going to teach y'all a meditation\nto get\nin touch with your body\nthis meditation is called kaishtheeram\nif you want to get in touch with your\nbody\nthe best meditation to get in touch with\nyour body\nis kaiser\nokay\nso for those of you that are meaning and\nthinking that okay there means touch\nyourself oh dr k is going to tell me to\ntouch myself dr k asmr stream touching\nyourself with dr k no\nit's going to be the very opposite of\ntouching yourself guys theorem is not a\nbody scan no no no too easy to easy chat\nk-a-y-a-s-h-t-i-r-a-m\nokay\nguys theorem means stillness of the body\nso if you want to get the most signals\nfrom your body\nall you have to do is sit\nperfectly still\nso\nif you want to feel no longer dead\ninside\nreally simple technique\nmake you feel alive in 30 seconds maybe\na minute maybe two\nmaybe three minutes\nah no no cartoon jesse no so someone's\nsaying i do that all day long no you do\nnot you do not do kaiosh theorem i am\nalmost 100 this does not mean sit in a\nchair what i am doing right now is not\nkaiser because i'm moving\nso we are going to close our eyes\nwe are going to sit perfectly still\nand we are gonna prepare ourselves\nfor the torrent\nof internal signals\nthat we're gonna get and we're not

as we count down\nnotice what happens in your body\nthe yearning to move will it increase\nintensely for some people\nright as we get back to one\nso now i'll count

breath\nthe number will come when it comes\nyou will be still until it does\none and relax\nhow was that\nokay\ngood that is the right answer\nokay i had to laugh why do i feel\nnauseous i hated it but also liked it\nthen you're doing it right it took so\nmuch effort is swallowing okay i felt\nwobbly that's crazy\nlisten let me explain something to y'all\nwe just sat still for like five minutes\nthat's all it was\nthat's just\njust sat still for like literally\nwhat we did is sit still for five\nminutes\nright like that's all we did like that's\nnot a thing\nand\nnotice how rich your internal\nenvironment is holy crap\nif sitting still can for five minutes\noffers so much\nin life both good and bad think about\nhow empty the rest of our life is\nlike how we're living empty lives\nbecause we're not living them mindfully\nevery experience of your life can be as\nintense as that\nevery bite of food you can eat ever as\nintense as that\nevery time you step into the sun and\nfeel the sun on your face as intense as\nthat\nliving life with intensity\nfinding like losing track of like this\nperson that you are inside you feel dead\ninside yeah it's because we don't live\nlife like that we live life like in a\n[ __ ] haze\nsitting still for five minutes\ncan be such a wealth of experience\nintense man like the relief you feel at\nthe end the struggles with your mind\nit's like you know what i was\nenvisioning that y'all are doing what it\nfelt like to me i could feel it\nit felt to me like you're the captain of\na ship in stormy seas and the seas are\ntrying to like break your ship apart\nbut you're holding steady in your course\nand then even though you're getting\nrocked and bumped and there's gale force\nwinds and all this kind of stuff you're\ngoing to keep this the ship going in the\ndirection you tell it to go\nand somehow like suddenly now breathing\nfeels amazing like who knew that\nbreathing could feel so good\nmoving which we do all the time just\nfidgeting\ncan feel amazing\nand it's all about up here right this is\nthe biggest problem that we've lost\ntrack of is we've started to believe\nthat living a life of fulfillment is\nlike comes from the outside and when all\nthese [ __ ] instagram gurus right of\nwhich we may be guilty who knows i don't\neven really understand\nwe'll say like oh my god you have to\nlike live life like happiness comes from\nwithin like what do you think people\nmean when they say that 90 of them don't\nknow what they're talking about but the\n10 who are actually saying this is what\nit means when fulfillment and like life\ncomes from like within like this is what\nthey mean\nit's because they figured out that our\ninternal experience of things is where\nlike intensity and passion and enjoyment\ncomes from even negativity can be\nintense like can you imagine if you were\njust relaxed that whole time like how\nempty that experience would have been\nlike if you were just chilling and\ncomfortable like laying in the sun and\nlike really like sure it'd be like\nenjoyable\nbut like just think about like what you\naccomplished you sat still for five\nminutes it's so intense\nright\nso like that's that's the thing so you\nknow if y'all are feeling dead on the\ninside\nyou got to get in touch with yourself\nbut what but everyone's like oh like get\nin touch with your inner child like oh\nmy god\nyou know like don't what does that mean\nthis is how you do it like literally\nthis is what you have to do when you eat\nfood when you exercise it doesn't have\nto be exercise just do something that\ngets your body to send you signals and\nbe with those signals\nright\ni feel like this would have been even\nmore intense if we did it in total\nsilence you're absolutely correct and\nyou're not ready for that which is why i\nwas there with you\nright so\nnext time you're going to be on your own\nwithout dr k\nso you're the captain of the ship in\nstormy waters dr k is a little tugboat\nthat's along for the ride and it's going\nto give me be giving you all a hand but\nwhen you're ready to go sail into those\nwaters on your own could be today could\nbe now could be tomorrow then by all\nmeans do it and you're damn right it's\ngoing to be way harder\nright\nfive minutes with yourself\nokay\nso how do you get in touch with yourself\nif you feel dead on the inside\nthis is how the process of getting in\ntouch with yourself can literally be\ntrained\nright so let's kind of recap and wrap up\nnumber one\noftentimes our early years are filled\nwith joy and light and excitement\nand then sometimes our 20s hit\nand then like things happen right and\nthis this vision of the world that we\nhad starts to like fall apart\nand it's not what i thought it was it's\nnot as fun as i used to be like your\nexcitement for life goes like as life\nyou know drags you through crap\nit extinguishes the desire to live from\nyou\nthe excitement for life\nthen what happens is we sort of get\nstuck\nin this situation where we're chasing\ndopamine we're chasing enjoyment of the\nmind and losing sight of ourselves in\nthe process\nbecause you can like watch youtube for\neight hours a day like you can do that\nbut it's not gonna you're not gonna look\nlike there's gonna be like it's you know\nit'll entertain your mind but the rest\nof you will become like empty\nand then what happens is we like start\nto struggle because we don't have\nmotivation we have like no desire like\nwe they're like in here there's nothing\ncoming out of this there's no like i\ndon't feel like doing anything\nso then what does the mind do it does\none of two things well i used to want to\ndo this so let me do that again let me\ngo back to the way that i used to be\nthen we and ourselves end up getting\nstuck because we're moving backwards but\nyou can't really move backwards so\nyou're just staying still then you feel\nstuck because you're not moving forward\nyou're chasing after what's gone and\nthen you're just kind of there\nit's also easy to get\nlost in the dopamine of it right like\nmine doesn't like getting in here\nbecause sometimes in here there's nasty\nstuff\nso how do we get back in touch with this\nfirst use your body it's the easiest way\nokay there are other ways to more mental\nin nature but use your body it's easy\nvery easy\nright so like engage your body do\nsomething that your body is sending you\nsignals good or bad\nso if you're you know if you take a cold\nshower that's unpleasant but your body\nis sending you a signal\ntake a warm shower but if you take a\nwarm shower this is important\nenjoy the warmth right really feel that\nwarmth the problem with relaxing\nstimulation for the body is that it\ngives our mind the tendency to wander\nokay\nyou can eat food that both you like and\ndislike and notice the different signals\nthat your body sends you\nlast thing\nis notice what directs your thoughts and\nyour actions\nand then kaishthiram\nsit perfectly still five minutes six\nminutes seven minutes whatever you can\nhandle\nand notice the torrent of things that\ncomes up for you\nso we should focus in our body at all\ntimes\nduring the practices yes\npay attention and then what you'll\nnaturally do is you'll start to get in\ntouch with your internal self\nand the cool thing is once you learn how\nto look within you\nit starts with the body because the\nbody's going to be sending you lots of\nsignals then what you can do is continue\nto look within you now that you know how\nto look within you it's easy because\nlike the body's sending you signals so\nyou know exactly where to look but once\ni know okay this is where i'm going to\nlook even in the absence of signals i\ncan still look there and that's when\ni'll start to discover like internal\nstuff\nokay so someone's asking when is kaish\ntheorem too much\nnot yet is the answer\nso i think you can do this practice for\n20 minutes at a stretch like once you've\ntrained your body properly you can\neasily do it for 20 minutes some yogis\nwill do it for days\nright so i don't recommend that but i'd\nsay like 20 minutes of stillness is good\nokay\nyeah so i have depersonalization\ndisorder but this was the first time for\na while i talked to my body hopefully\nthat's a good thing\nright so remember that if you're\ndepersonalizing there may be a reason\nfor that right so sometimes some of\nthese depersonalization disorders and\nstuff are\nresponses\nto\nlike protect you so don't rush it\nespecially if you've been diagnosed with\nsomething definitely talk to your\ntreater about stuff like that\ngot it five minutes then build up to 20\nabsolutely it's a good way to do it\nah days after that i'd feel like walking\ni'm walking on air now y'all understand\nwhy enlightenment leads to happiness\nbecause once you do these spiritual\npractices\nevery moment of your life is walking on\nair\nexcellent\nsomeone's saying hey sorry just tuned in\nwhat do you let your mind do while\nstaying still\noh your mind isn't going to be your mind\nwill have plenty of do to do\nall you have to do is try not to move\nand your mind will be occupied don't\nworry about it\ngo back and watch the vod and do the\npractice\nokay\nit's okay\nso so it's a great question i'm not i'm\ni'm laughing because\ni think we chat just experienced\nsomething i'm not i'm not trying to\nuh keep you out seriously you should go\nwatch this i don't\nit's just so i want y'all to notice that\nquestion and notice the questions of the\nintellect\nand how absurd the questions of the\nintellect can sound to someone with\nexperience\ndo you all get that\nit's like the question is completely\nappropriate right so this is someone\nwho's smart has figured out okay like if\ni'm focusing on my body what do i let my\nmind do isn't meditation about focusing\nthe mind\nit's an excellent question\nright and also like completely\nirrelevant\nso once you do the practice you'll see\nthat your mind i mean maybe maybe you're\nyou do have to occupy your mind i'm not\nsure so if if you're able to do kai's\ntheorem without any difficulty then you\nprobably want to move on to a more\nmental meditation which is like mantra\nor something like that that's what i\nwould recommend\nall right\nokay next one\nyeah so i noticed that when we were\ncounting down last 10 seconds slowly i\nwas getting more and more anxious closer\nto being done yeah that's why i was\ncounting slowly to make it harder for\nyou because y'all were such chads y'all\nwere doing so good that we had to make\nthings difficult\nright\nyou couldn't stop laughing good so next\ntime i won't be there this is easy mode\nlittle tugboat dr k's your little\ntugboat next time y'all are on your own\nokay\nso here's the other thing\nnext level play so if you were\nmeditating for five minutes\nand you couldn't help but laugh during\nthat time\nyou're meditating right\nright that's what's actually beautiful\nabout meditation it's like what you're\nlaughing for five minutes without any\nkind of\njoke or funny video or tick tock or\nanything like that you were just sitting\nwith yourself and like couldn't suppress\nlaughter\nyou're doing it right\nright so someone's saying what if you're\ncrying you're doing it right\nright whatever is within is coming out\nyou're in touch with yourself this is an\nantidote to being dead on the inside\nyou all get this\nit's very important to understand\nah so\nokay\nokay so\ni'm noticing a lot of questions do you\nguys\nokay let's let's say there's good\nquestions here so we're going to talk\nabout it okay so number one\num\nokay dr k what if it becomes a mindless\nhabit like other meditation after a\nwhile\nthen you're doing the meditation wrong\nso this is it's a very common problem\nbut it's also incorrect that\nonce our body develops a habit it puts\nit on autopilot and then our mind likes\nto wander right so the whole purpose of\nmeditation is to not let your mind\nwander and have it focus on one thing\nand you can get good at that so you can\nlike breathe for 10 minutes without it\nbecoming a habit as long as you learn\nhow to control your attention\nokay so but it is a danger so for a lot\nof people who find that their body\nacclimatizes this is why we teach\ndifferent meditation techniques so for\nsome people one meditation technique is\ngood enough\nbut for a lot of people that i work with\nespecially like people with like adhd\nand stuff what they'll find what they'll\ndo is entrain their habit circuitry and\nso i'll mix up their meditation quite a\nbit there's a reason why i don't do the\nsame meditation on stream every single\nweek\nright because what's going to happen is\nall you all are going to check out and\nit's going to become automatic so that's\nwhy we teach new and new meditations and\nover time what you'll do this the level\nof focus your training is going to be\nlike\nevery meditation you do is leveling up\nyour focus\nwithout letting you en engender some\nkind of habit and distraction\nso if you if you do this enough times\nwithout getting distracted then your\nmind will learn how to focus without it\ndeveloping a habit so that's why you\nshould just mix up your meditation\nokay\nnext question is\num\ni forgot uh there's another good one\nwhat if the only thing coming is rage\nand anger then let it come\nand stay still\ndo not lose yourself in the rage and\nanger right because remember the kaish\ntheorem practice is about staying still\nand maintaining that don't get lost in\nthat let those rage and anger will come\nand they'll go\njust like an itch comes and goes just\nlike you know the hunger comes and goes\njust like you know the tickling\nsensation comes and goes everything will\ncome and go you stay still\nokay\nsomeone's asking what if i want to smash\neverything in my room out of anger\ndon't\nstay still\nyou can want to do stuff\ndon't do it the practice is to stay\nstill\neasy\nokay\nhow do you control their thoughts is is\nthere a way there's absolutely a way but\nit's more than i can answer right now\nokay\num\nthere's another question but i'm missing\nit now\nuh\nokay\na lot of good questions\nso you let it come but don't give in\nthat's perfect\nwhat if i fall asleep you can sleep if\nyou want to you better not move a damn\nmuscle i don't care if you sleep\nno moving\nall y'all are asking all these like\nquestions but like it doesn't it's\nsimple the instructions are simple what\nif i fall asleep don't don't move\nyou're like but if i sleep i can't\ncontrol whether i move good then don't\nfall asleep\nsit for five minutes\nseven minutes eight minutes nine minutes\nten minutes\nyou have one job just sit [ __ ] still\nfor five minutes\nwhat if i become aroused\nthen you're aroused\nright\nwhat if this what if this what if this\nwhat if this\ndo you see how your mind loves to rebel\nthere's the intellect again\noh but dr k what about this oh if i fall\nasleep but then i'm gonna fall asleep oh\ni guess i'd better not do it eh\nwhat the [ __ ] you're not gonna fall\nasleep\nyou'll be fine\nyou see that\nso much resistance\nlike i get the intellectual curiosity i\nreally do\nand if anyone\nfeels you know like i'm being\nuh i'm not\ni'm\nbeating up on particular people for\nasking questions it's it's like i i do\nit with love hopefully y'all are getting\nthat seriously like your mind is going\nto come with all these kinds of\nquestions most of the questions are good\nand also like they're sort of relevant\nlike this is the whole thing you all\nhave to understand is that the purpose\nof the kaiosh theorem practice is to\nhelp you understand how intense the\nexperience of life can be the mental\ncrap is just floating around up here\nright like\njust sit and then all of your answers\nwill be right there\nokay\nyou sometimes have an erection during\nmeditation is that normal it's very\nnormal\nokay random question which i will answer\nrandomly dr k why is marijuana so bad on\nreinforcing patterns of behavior because\nthe habit circuitry in your brain\nuses endocannabinoid\nsignals and receptors\nthat's why so the parts of our brain\nthat form habits use the endocannabinoid\nsystem\nso like the neurotransmitters that have\nto do with habit formation or\ncannabinoids so what happens when you\nuse pot is that like you're tossing in a\nbunch of artificial cannabinoids which\nin turn are gonna hit receptors in your\nlike habit formation circuitry because\nthat's what's gonna happen\nand then when they hit those receptors\nit's gonna you're gonna start\nreinforcing weird behaviors it's really\ninteresting"
