    "transcript": "i didn't learn anything there's so much\ni don't know i'm so incompetent no\ninstead of what you say is here's here\nare the skills that i learned i'm\nproficient in a b and c and you've got\nto be prepared in something if you've\ngot a portfolio here are the six things\nthat i'm really hoping to learn because\ni think they'd really enhance\nmy ability to like make graphics\nall that stuff that you don't know\nokay\ni feel like i won't be employable\nwhen i graduate\nright now right so i'm a graphic design\nstudent and i mean you know the how the\njokes of the unemployed art student go\nbut even if i have trouble finding a job\ndue to mostly external reasons i think i\ncan cope with it if things are looking\npessimistic i can accept lower paying\njobs and move towns etc not an insanely\nbig deal however the thing is that my\nuniversity doesn't really teach us how\nto design\nthey just give us projects and make us\ntry our best it's too late for me to\ntransfer and i'm honestly very\nfrustrated with my uni but you may say\nwhy don't you teach yourself how to\ndesign\nthat's the thing when i tried to do that\ni barely had time for the insane\nworkload i was given it's always a\nbalancing act between learning the\nbasics of what you're in uni for and\ndoing assignments\ni just don't know what to do any anymore\nthere's so many things i don't know and\ni don't trust myself to learn them over\nthe summer as the past two were spent\nbeing depressed in my home\ni'm already picturing the crappy state\nof my portfolio as i try to apply for\njobs\nno one cares if it's\nbecause my uni is a uni a job is a job\ni'm already seeing this now as i\nstruggle at my work internship and i\nhonestly feel horrible\nlike a mix of self-hate and incredible\nfrustration towards my uni i seriously\ndon't know what to do\nokay\nso this unfortunately is\na problem that i've seen a lot during\nespecially covid\nso what's happening is i've seen a lot\nof university students\nfeeling\nmore and more pessimistic about their\nopportunities\ntheir work opportunities after college\nso a lot of people are feeling like\nreally really\nyou know not good about this\nso\nwhat i'm seeing a lot of is that\nsometimes we have college students who\nare like afraid that their university is\nnot preparing them the way that they're\nsupposed to be\nuniversities aren't teaching right\nespecially with like online school and\nstuff like that like it's been really\nhard because the quality of education\nthat most people are getting is going\ndown\nfurthermore\nthey're so busy and or so mentally burnt\nout that\nthe independent learning that they\nshould be doing to fix things is like\njust so hard because they're either\nmentally burnt out or there's a lot of\nbusy work or other crap like that so\nit's sort of like you're placed in this\nsituation you can't transfer\nyou're not getting the skills that you\nneed you don't have time to teach\nyourself the stuff\nand so you're kind of just like doomed\nright and there's this kind of attitude\nthat people have that i'm screwed\nbecause i'm not going to be employable\nand like i can see you know it's sort of\nlike you're you're on a train that's\nheaded towards a cliff and you can see\nthe cliff coming you can see that\nthere's a there's a railroad there's\nlike railroad tracks that are going\nstraight towards the cliff like you\ncan't change direction you can't slow\ndown the train you're like committed\nand like they're they're there's the\ncliff and you're kind of screwed\nso it can be very very very\nscary for people to like be in this\nsituation where they feel like they're\nnot getting adequately prepared\nthe tricky thing\nhere is that there are a couple of\ndifferent pieces to this puzzle\nthat\nwe have to consider\nin order to understand how to navigate\ntowards like becoming employable\nthe first is\nit's kind of weird but where is your\nidea of how employable you are right so\nthe first question you've got to ask\nyourself\nis how qualified are you to know how\nemployable you are so this person was\nkind of saying i have a crappy portfolio\ni can envision the piece of crap\nportfolio that i'm putting together\nwhereas you have to really stop for a\nsecond and think a little bit about like\ndo you know what people who are looking\nfor entry-level you know graphic design\nartists are looking for\nright so you're going to get your first\njob out of college like what are they\nlooking for what are the requirements\nhow much of what you actually do in the\nworkplace do you even learn in\ncollege right so let's kind of start\nthere for a second\nbecause the truth is that chances are\nyou're actually going to be totally fine\nand we'll get to that in a second but\nlike most people you know who are hiring\nfor the first time understand that\nyou're coming right out of college most\npeople also understand in the workplace\nthat when you hire someone out of\ncollege what really college is for is or\nunity is for is developing a foundation\nupon which you build your skills\nso just as an example like you know in\nmedical school is intense right so\nmedical school is like four years\nand it's there's a lot to learn in\nmedical school you're studying a ton\nand you probably learn like\ni probably learned like five to ten\npercent of\nwhat i use as a psychiatrist in medical\nschool in the next four years during\nresidency you learn like 95 of\npsychiatry so it's kind of bizarre\nbut that's true for a lot of other\nprofessions too and graphic design i\nthink is generally speaking in a sense\nno different is that people know that\nyou know if you're out of college you're\nout of college you're not going to be\nexpected to be perfect\nso then the question kind of comes in\nlike then why does this person feel this\nway right where are these thoughts\ncoming from where is the pessimism\ncoming from\nand let's kind of take a second look at\nthe post and kind of highlight a few\nthings\nokay\nso\njokes of unemployment right at the start\num\nif things are looking pessimistic so\nthis seems kind of optimistic right\ndoesn't teach us how to design they give\nus projects\nbut they don't really teach me anything\ni don't know what to do they feel like\nthey're learning the basics\nthey kind of spent some time depressed\nat home\ni'm already picturing\nthe crappy state of my portfolio as i\ntry to apply to jobs\nno one cares\nright\nlike\ni'm already seeing this now as i\nstruggle at my work internship and\nhonestly i feel horrible\nso this is kind of tricky\nbut\nand this is something i've seen a lot\nduring the pandemic like i said so i'm\ngoing to point out to you all a little\nbit about what's going on in the mind\nand how this person is coming to\nconclusions so if you're someone that\nthinks that you're not prepared for the\njob market\nyou have to remember that your mind is\nmaking that conclusion right but how\nqualified is your mind and what is your\nmind influenced by let's take a look\nso if you feel\nif you're a college student\nwho feels\nunprepared\nlet's start to understand a couple\nthings one is how qualified are you\nto know\nyour\nemployability\nsecond thing is\nwhere does your mind\nget the idea\nthat you're unemployable\nokay\nso\nfirst thing is that you're not really\nvery qualified because like how many\npeople have you interviewed for design\npositions do you know what companies\nlook for when they're hiring are you\npart of hr if you you know like\nyou don't know\nright like i know it's kind of weird but\nlike you have no idea what people are\nlooking for\nand actually this person seems quite\nattractive\nuh\nin terms of a lot of the things that\nthey're doing so this is kind of weird\nbut like the short answer is like you're\nnot you're not an expert in like\ndesiring uh hiring graphic designers you\nhave no idea what people are looking for\nso we're not saying that you aren't uh\nmaybe maybe you should be pessimistic i\ndon't know but let's just start by sort\nof understanding if you're a college\nstudent you have no idea what people who\nare like actually hiring or looking for\nthe skill set that matters to them\nthings like that you just don't know\nright so you're just first thing is you\nknow how qualified are you the answer is\nnot very\nso\nif you're not very qualified why are you\nfreaking out\nright\nand it turns out there's a really good\nreason for this so in college especially\nlike pre-pandemic\nso in college\nwhat we get what\na big part of college is developing\nconfidence\nand what i've seen more and more often\nis that like this confidence kind of\ncomes from things like grades\nit comes from being you know\na junior\nor senior\nand working like being a ta\nfor freshmen for example\nright so like\ncomes from grades comes from junior\nsenior comes from generally speaking\nlike learning more advanced things over\ntime\nit also comes from feedback\nfrom peers\nand professors\nso this is really important right\nbecause a lot of confidence isn't\nactually learning the on on the job\nstuff it's like learning things like\nwork ethic\ndeadlines\nthis is really what college is about\nand then we get these different kinds of\nthings that give us confidence so here's\nwhat i've noticed\nduring the pandemic\nduring online schooling\nso as more programs move to online\nthese kinds of confidence developing\nthings\nget decreased\nbecause you're not interacting with\nfreshmen as much you're not quite a ta\neven if you are a ta if it's online you\ndon't really form relationships with\npeople it's kind of like you're just\nkind of reviewing work and stuff like\nthat so what's happening is that as our\nas our college situation and our\npandemic situation changes i'm noticing\na global decrease in the amount of\nconfidence that people have coming out\nof college\nokay and then this is creating further\nproblems so once you lack confidence\nnow we're answering this question a\nlittle bit better\nso once we determine that we lack\nconfidence then what happens is our mind\nconcludes\nwe\nare\nscrewed\nnow is this person applied for a job no\ndo they know what employers are looking\nfor no\nand yet their mind still comes to the\nconclusion that they're screwed but\nwhere does that that conclusion stem\nfrom it stems from a lack of confidence\ni'm not blaming this person for doing\nthat that's what happens to everyone\nright so unless we're given confidence\nthrough some of these reinforcing\nmeasures\nunless one of your professors because i\nthink this is the problem they're faced\nit's like their professors are too\nmentally checked out they're not saying\nhey you're doing a really great job what\ni'm not hearing from this person at all\nis anywhere in here someone telling them\nhey you're doing good a good job you're\ndoing great you're managing the workload\ni know it's a lot we're not seeing any\npositive reinforcement and when there's\nan absence of positive reinforcement in\nour college experience or in any other\npart of life that leads to lack of\nconfidence it's not a personal failing\non this this person's part it's like\nit's not their job to be naturally\nconfident confidence comes from the\nreinforcement of people who are more\nexperienced than you are\nand in the absence of that they're going\nto naturally end up with a lack of\nconfidence\nthen they're going to conclude that\nthey're screwed this in turn is going to\nactivate the ahamkar\nright so remember ahamkara\na-h-a-m-k-a-r-a\nthe sanskrit word for ego\nis a defensive mechanism that arises to\nprotect you when you are feeling bad so\nwhen we lack confidence\nthe ahamkar activates\na hum card to the rescue and then the\nhum car unfortunately does a couple\nthings that can\nbe weird one is it makes comparisons\nright so how does this person know that\ntheir portfolio is going to look like\ntrash it's because they've looked\nat\nother portfolios\nright so even if you look at this\nhow does this person okay so\nthat's the thing what um\nso like it's always a balance act\nbetween learning the basics of what\nyou're in uni and doing assignments i\ndon't know what to do anyway there's so\nmany things i don't know\nright so they're like they're aware that\nthere are a lot of things that they\ndon't know yet\nthey're they're aware of the growth that\nthey need to have that's actually really\nhealthy we'll see that in a second\nbut all they're focusing on they're not\nfocusing on the things that they they do\nknow and all the things that they've\nlearned they're not focusing on the fact\nthat they've successfully completed\nassignments what the hum guard is going\nto do when we lack confidence when we\nhave the ahamkar this is going to result\nin cognitive distortions\nokay\nthese cognitive distortions are all\ngoing to be negative in nature so\nthey're going to focus on all the things\nthat you don't know because you're not\neven going to appreciate you're so\nburied with all your workload that\nyou're actually doing that you don't\neven appreciate how much you've learned\nbecause all you've felt week after week\nmonth after month after month is that\nyou're like alone in the ocean stranded\nby yourself with no sense of feedback\nright you're trying to navigate through\nfog and you can't see anything so of\ncourse you're gonna feel lost because\nyou're not getting any feedback from\nanyone\nthis\nin turn\nis going to result in\ni'm unemployable\nbecause you're going to look at all the\nother people you're going to go look at\nlike design portfolios of professionals\nwho have websites and you're going to\ncompare your crappy design portfolio to\ntheirs and then you're going to conclude\noh wow look at how awesome that person\nis forget the fact that they have like\neight years of experience you're going\nto conclude i'm unemployable because\nthis is my competition\nnow this is where things get really\ntricky because once you start looking\nfor a job with this attitude what do you\nthink this attitude is gonna do in terms\nof shaping the job that you get\nhere's what's gonna happen\nokay first thing that's gonna happen is\nyou're going to avoid\nthe best jobs\nokay\nyou're going to avoid the best jobs for\nsure\nbecause you're on there's no way that\nthis person would hire you\nright because you're unemployable so the\nfirst thing that you're going to do\nis knock out\nthe 50\nof jobs\nthat are awesome or like not awesome\nthat are that are good right so the top\n50 so let's say here's all the jobs that\nyou can get this is the perfect job\nthis is the shittiest job that you can\nget the first thing that you're going to\ndo is x out this\nso now all that's left is the bottom\nhalf\nnext thing that's going to happen is\nlike when you go in interview places\nbecause of your lack of like confidence\nin yourself you're going to\nnaturally attract\ntoxic\nworkplaces\ni know it's kind of weird\nbut this is almost a situation\nkind of like when you have been abused\ngrowing up you look for partners that\nwill continue to abuse you\nbecause it's like it feels right right\neven if it's not good for you it feels\nright\nso when someone when you go to an\ninterview and someone cheats you with a\nlittle bit of disrespect or they're like\nyeah you know i don't know if you\nactually have what it takes but we'll\ngive you a chance\nthat's actually going to align with your\ninternal sense of self\nso you'll be like oh like these people\nlike know what to expect from me so let\nme work there\nso over time what you're going to do is\nyou're also going to shoot yourself in\nthe foot\nin terms of negotiations\nand because you think as you think so\nlittle of yourself you lack that\nconfidence right and so like\nwhat you're gonna end this is this is\nwhat gets really tricky so when when i\nsay toxic workplace why do i say toxic\nbecause someone with more confidence\nwould be able to walk away from like\nmistreatment during the hiring process\nright someone with more confidence who\nrecognizes the value they bring to the\ntable\nif a boss is like are you willing to\nwork nights and weekends and not get\npaid for it are you willing to get me\ncoffee and like someone with confidence\nis going to be like no\nwhereas like you if you're worried right\nso look\nlook at how much they're already willing\nto compromise against themselves\nto make it work\nright\nself-compromise\nyou're gonna shoot yourself in the foot\nyou're gonna compromise\nright it's tricky\nthen what's going to happen this is the\nworst thing\nthey're going to get a job\nit's going to be toxic\nthey're going to burn out\nand then what is this going to do\nreinforce\ntheir\noriginal beliefs\ni knew it\ni knew i was unemployable\ni knew i was unemployable now you're\nburnt out now you can't even work right\nwe're back to the summer\nwhere\nwhere is this they gave us uh why don't\nyou teach yourself it's a balancing act\nyeah\nlike i barely had time for the workload\ni was given\nlike\nburning out can't learn stuff during the\nsummer the summer is supposed to be a\nbreak right it's not supposed to be\nwhere you learn\nyou knew it i told you so\nyour mind is like hey your hum car was\nlike i warned you about this buddy i\ntried to protect you by telling you\nthat you shouldn't expect to get a job\nlook at you dumbass\nthought you could get a job\nbecomes a self-fulfilling prophecy\nright and then then the cycle just\nrepeats\nnow you make more compromises\nit's tough\nright this is what our mind does i'm i\ndon't think that i think this person is\nawesome for the record\nbut that's what our mind does all right\nso like like we we see this a lot where\nlike our mind will tell it like warn us\nhey don't try and then when we try our\nmind is like i told you so why did you\nbother i tried to protect you from this\nyou should have never applied for the\njob in the first place and then we end\nup getting stuck because we don't want\nto like our mind is like don't apply for\nthe job don't apply for the job i'm so\nanxious\ni tried to change my life and i got\nsmacked down\nwe can sometimes start to form negative\nopinions about the world oh then like\nall workplaces are toxic\nright like all kinds of things can come\nout of that\nso\nhere's the crazy\nthing i think you are very employable\nwhy\nbecause you are self-directed\nyou get your stuff done\nwithout guidance\nor support\nyou have humility\nmaybe a little bit too much\nyou know\nwhat you don't know\na couple of other things that i'm sort\nof picking up here is that you're\nisolated\nso here's what i'd say\nwe're going to kind of start\nat the end and we're going to work our\nway backwards\nokay\nwhen you apply for a job you can say hey\ni have a design degree from this i've\ncompleted this many projects\ni'm highly self-directed so\nunfortunately the university i had\ndidn't have a whole lot of hand-holding\nlike they just sort of gave us projects\nand they were like figure it out so the\nfunny thing is like this is how a\ngraphic designer works in the real world\nnow right so like we even employ them at\nhg\nlike we employ designers and like\nself-direction is huge because what\nhappens is someone comes to you and\nthey're like hey we want you to make\nthis thing and then it's like up to you\nto figure it out right like companies\nare going to hire you so that you can do\nit\nso you're actually perfect this is great\nif you had a bunch of handholding like\noddly enough i'd be more worried about\nyou in the job market your university\nexperience actually mirrors what a lot\nof like work experiences can be like\nthis is great\nit's a huge thing sucks for you don't\nget me wrong i'm not saying that like\ni wish i didn't wish things were\ndifferent for you it'd be really nice if\nespecially people could give you\nfeedback that's what i think is really\nmissing\num\nbut you're like you're self-directed you\ncan manage project timelines\nyou are good at like learning skills on\nthe fly\nright\nso this is what i would say like in in\nyour application so i put together your\nportfolio don't worry about how crappy\nit is because it's it can only be so\ngood right\nand you're like people understand you're\nnew at this so like this is where what\nyou kind of like this is what how you\nspin it so you can just say look so i'm\ngood at managing project timelines i'm\nself-directed i have a list of stuff\nthat i'd like to learn more about that i\ndidn't get a chance to learn in\nuniversity so you have to change the way\nyou say things right you didn't say i\ndidn't learn anything there's so much i\ndon't know i'm so incompetent no instead\nof what you say is here's here are the\nskills that i learned i'm proficient in\na b and c and you've got to be\nproficient in something if you've got a\nportfolio here are the six things that\ni'm really hoping to learn because i\nthink they'd really enhance\nmy ability to like\nmake graphics\nall that stuff that you don't know\nright i and\ni'm good at learning skills that are\nneeded and i'm good at managing my own\nwork i went to university that was\nactually i wish i had a little bit more\nstructure now here's the cool thing\nyou're also\ngoing to be\ncareful about where you work because\nyou're isolated\nso when when people at the job interview\nthis is where the lack of confidence\ncomes in people the job interview are\nlike\ndo you have any questions for us\nif you lack confidence and you're not\nselective you're going to say you're\ngoing to ask some generic question that\nyou googled what questions should i ask\nin a job interview instead you are going\nto be very careful about the questions\nthat you ask\nso you're going to ask them\nwhat is like the community environment\nhere at your workplace do people work\nsort of siloed or do they work like\ntogether\nokay\nand you're gonna pick the place\nif you're feeling isolated that people\ncollaborate\nyou can even tell them i'm really\ninterested in collaborating with other\ndesigners to learn from other people and\nshare what i have is that something that\ni'll get to do here you want to know\nthat ahead of time okay second thing\nis what are the learning opportunities\nbecause remember the problem you need to\nfix\nis this\nright\nyou don't trust yourself to learn them\nso what you're going to look for in a\nworkplace\nis i'm really interested in structured\nlearning opportunities or opportunities\nto learn these particular things\nlike and how does that come across to\nyour your\nprospective employer\nthe way you come across is not like\ndemanding or ignorant in fact it comes\nacross like the exact opposite way hey\nthis is someone who's actually like\ninterested in like learning more and\nthey're kind of you kind of come across\nas a go-getter it's going to increase\nyour esteem for most employers\nright you'll get that\nand so suddenly like with this situation\nyou're actually a pretty strong\ncandidate if your portfolio sucks it\nsucks but like you have no idea if it\nsucks or not right you have no idea what\nan entry level designer should be\ncapable of\ni i don't know i i can't judge that\nmaybe it does i i just don't know but i\nguess based on the mental stuff that i\nsee here\nyour cognitive bias is actually making\nyour work appear far worse than it is\nokay so\ni know it's kind of weird but this is\nthe last step before you do that\num\nwhat you need to do is offset your\nemotions\nokay so like you need to do some like\ninternal processing here and really\nthink a little bit about answering these\nquestions\nwhere does\nmy lack of confidence come from\nright what does it feel like\nto be\na student at this university\nwhat would have to happen\nor have to be different\nfor me to feel confident\nand now now this is kind of interesting\nso this is like a tricky question that\nyou can get\ntrapped by a lot so what's what your\ncognitive distorted mind may say is\nlearn all that stuff\nif i knew how to do all that stuff if i\nhad a really beautiful portfolio then i\nwould be confident\nbut those aren't real goals i know it\nsounds kind of weird but that's not like\na real thing you can do right it's just\nsort of like this weird vague idea of\ni'll be confident when i'm confident\nlike having a beautiful portfolio what\ndoes that even mean like how do you\nmeasure whether your portfolio is is\nbeautiful so this is tricky where your\nmind will say oh if i had a brilliant\nportfolio then i'd be confident\nbut that's kind of like your mind is\nsetting you up for a task that can only\nfail\nbecause how do you have a beautiful\nportfolio who measures that how can you\nmove one percent towards a beautiful\nportfolio how can you grind 10 15 20\ntowards a beautiful portfolio you can't\nthat's it's an unachievable goal\nnow for those particular skills\nyou can pick one\nand start to learn it\nbut be careful\nso what do y'all think is gonna happen\nif this person picks a skill and starts\nto learn it do you think this will\nincrease their confidence or decrease\ntheir confidence\ntricky\n[Music]\nright\nnow do you think this will actually\nincrease their marketability or decrease\ntheir marketability\nit'll increase their marketability if\nthey learn a skill but it'll decrease\ntheir confidence\nokay\nnow hold on a second hold on a second\nhold on\nhold on\nif this is the situation that they're in\nwhat do you think that says about the\nrelationship between their confidence\nand their marketability\nuh-oh\nit's almost as if the two were\nare\ninversely proportional right so as the\nconfidence goes down the marketability\ngoes up\nso skill acquisition\nis our x-axis\nright\nand then so like the funny thing is they\ncould be right here\nwhich actually means they're quite\nmarketable\nand lacking confidence\nwhich is how we get to this post\nyou'll see that so you have to be really\nreally careful about how your mind works\nbecause sometimes\nyour mind will like sort of have the\nopposite effect that you think it's\ngoing to have\nokay\nso you gotta process those emotions\nand then hopefully over time what i i'd\nsay is that\nlast thing to kind of consider is that\nlike\nlet me just think about this if i did\nthis right so yeah employability offset\nyour emotions yeah and what i'd really\ntry to do is get some feedback so this\nis going to be really important\nso a lot of times people in this\nsituation who lack confidence\navoid feedback\nthey avoid it\nokay\nand why is that it's because you're\nafraid that someone else\nis gonna tell you what you believe could\nbe true about yourself but as long as\nyou don't hear it from them\nlike you could be wrong right so when\nyou ask for feedback what you're\nactually taking away is hope\nunless you get feedback like there's the\nhope\nlike so it's kind of tricky\nbecause when you ask someone else what\nthey think of you\nit's so it's so difficult but this is\nthe problem is that like you're kind of\nstuck now because the confidence is\nactually going to come from positive\nreinforcement from other people\nto a certain degree i know we've sort of\nsaid that it comes from within but\nthat's a little bit more complicated and\nso now you're kind of tricky but like\ni'd say start getting feedback because\nif we're really talking about your\nemployability you should like you need\nto get feedback because that's really\nwhat's going to fix it and be aware that\nyou're going to be afraid of what\nthey're going to say so just be aware of\nthat kind of going in right that's where\nwe have to kind of offset your emotions\nand this is where like offsetting your\nemotions this is where like going to\ntherapy\nyou could work with a coach\nyou could talk to friends\nyou could do introspection\ngo for hikes\nright but just like get the f off the\ninternet and don't just compare yourself\nto random portfolios for people who have\npaid people to have really strong seo\nright because like if you're googling\nportfolios like there's gonna be all\nkinds of factors that go into that\nyou're not getting a fair sample when\nyou google a portfolio google knows\nwhich portfolios are the most attractive\nto look at so it's going to show you\nthis the top\n.0001 of portfolios on the internet\nright like\nthere's all kinds of crap that is going\ninto your cognitively distorted head\nand search engines are not helping\nright\nso got to be careful about that so\noffset your emotions and get some\nfeedback right so ask people hey what\ncan what here's my portfolio would you\nbe willing to take a look\nwhat improvements do you think i can\nmake to make myself more marketable for\nmy first job it's a question you can ask\nyour professors\nmake sense\nso you got to get feedback and the other\nwild thing may happen when you get\nfeedback actually i think it's pretty\ngood\ni think you're well positioned for an\nentry-level graphic design\njob and then boy one of two things will\nhappen\nso if you get good feedback\noh boy what a mess\nif you get good feedback\none of two things will happen one is\nyou'll gain confidence\ni'd give this a 25 chance\nthe other thing that'll happen\nis mental gymnastics\nto convince yourself\nthat\nyou are\nunemployable\n75\nand what does this look like\nhe's just\nsaying that\nbecause they\nare\nmy\nprofessor\nyou'll get that\nor it can manifest in other ways\nwhat it could do is\nhe says oh yeah overall they look really\nfantastic i'd consider adding more color\nthen what your mind is going to do\nis ignore the positive\nand\njump to the negative\nand really pay attention\npay attention\nright because that's what this bad boy\nis going to do\nso just be pay attention pay attention\nto what they actually say\nright so it's tricky\nso get some feedback manage your\nemotions because you want to go in like\nnot feeling\nlike you're the worst person on the\nplanet because if you enter the job\nsearch that way it's going to be tough\nit's hard enough as it is even for\nsomeone who's who's confident\nright there could be all kinds of other\nstuff like imposter syndrome is huge\nhere\num\nand then ultimately i think you know you\nmay be more employable than you give\nyourself credit for\nso just to kind of summarize you know i\nknow it's tricky\nbecause a lot of times we feel like\nespecially as college students like we\nlack the feedback\nwith the pandemic and with more online\nlearning and some of these degrees like\ngraphic design that are a little bit\nmore siloed\nlike as college students it's like\nreally hard to be confident about your\njob prospects\npile on top of that like everything\nyou're seeing about how the world is\nfalling apart and it's just\nfood for your cognitive distortions and\nthen your cognitive distortions get\nreally really really big you lose your\nconfidence and then your lack of\nconfidence plus your ego which sort of\narises in as a result\nthen creates conclusions for you that\nyou're not really qualified to make like\nyou have no idea what an intro level\ngraphic design person is looking for\nright and remember there's that that\nfamous joke or whatever about\nyou know the\nthe\nthere's like a famous piano teacher\nlet's say and they have two students\nthat come to them and one is like hey\ni'd like to learn piano and they'd say\nokay how much experience do you have and\nthey say i've never played a piano in my\nlife they're like great i'll charge you\n100 bucks a week\nthe second person comes along and they\nsay i want to learn piano from you and\nthey say okay how much how much\nexperience do you have and they said\ni've i have five years of experience\ngreat i'm going to charge you\n300 bucks a week and they said well wait\nhold on but i i already know how to do\nhalf of it why are you charging me more\nand they're like yeah well like i have\nto\ni teach you to unlearn a bunch of crap\nso i have to like wipe your slate clean\nwhereas this person's slate is already\nclean there are a lot of jobs that\nreally just prefer\ngood especially for intro level\npositions really are looking for good\nwork ethic\nand good self-direction they'll teach\nyou what you need to know or they want\nyou to do things in a particular style\nanyway\nso you have no idea how employable you\nare but your lack of confidence will\nconvince you\ndespite the fact that you have no\nobjective information you have no\nexperience hiring intro level graphic\ndesigners so you don't really know what\nthey look for but your mind doesn't tell\nyou that it's ignorant right instead\nwhat does the lack of confidence will\nstart coming up with answers for you\nit'll tell you hey you're screwed\nand we see this a lot in online learning\npandemic related stuff\nsiloed fields because you don't get that\nkind of feedback and confidence from\nyour peers from your professors things\nlike that\nso at the end of the day you've got to\nbe careful because if that lack of\nconfidence is what's in the driving seat\nwhen you look for a job first thing is\nyou're going to ignore all the best jobs\nthat you those may have been the right\nplaces for you because\nwith your work ethic\nand the right kind of community maybe\nyou could have really knocked it out of\nthe park but you're not going to apply\nfor those because you don't think you\nyou're going to get them\nreminds me of my first research\nassistant position at harvard medical\nschool which i got because i was the\nonly applicant i applied for 140\npositions\nand the ones that were at the medium\nlevel universities\nhad the most competition\nand some of the most like\nthis is like a glut of mediocrity for\njobs sometimes where the most\ncompetitive jobs don't actually get as\nmany candidates as like the medium\ncompetitiveness jobs\nright bizarre\nbecause everyone was like oh i don't\nthink i can get the job there\noh this feels right to me this is like a\nbetter fit\noh wow these people are paying 75 000. i\ndon't i thought i'm only worth 50. let\nme apply for the 51.\nso you got to be careful about that kind\nof stuff\nso you may end up being more employable\nthan you realize\nand if you're not careful you're going\nto select through a selection bias\nyou're going to pick for worse jobs and\nthen even in the interview process\nyou're going to gravitate towards toxic\nworkplaces that\ntreat you the way that you feel about\nyourself because then it's like then\nthere's no imposter syndrome you'll get\nthat\nif you end up in a toxic workplace that\ntreats you like crap and you feel like\ncrap you're not gonna feel like an\nimposter it's gonna feel at least it's\nfits\nwhereas if they treat you really well\nbecause you're grossly\nmisunderestimating your value you're\ngonna feel like an imposter\nyou're like i don't understand like i'm\nnot i don't know that much why are these\npeople treating me so well they're\nsaying i'm doing a good job and it's\ngoing to take you a little while for\nthat to sink in that maybe you're\nactually work worth something\nso what you got to do in order to\novercome this is first of all recognize\nthat you may be more employable than you\nrealize you have a lot of good stuff\ngoing for you right you're self-directed\nyou're interested in learning\nyou're you want to do a good job\nyou've completed a lot of projects it\nsounds like you can handle high\nworkloads so i would emphasize all that\nkind of stuff\nright that you're a workhorse\nyou're self-directed you're interested\nin learning\nand\nyou've got to offset those emotions and\nfocus on that confidence recognize where\nall these thoughts coming from they're\ncoming from some emotional place and so\nlike dig into that and work on that\nbecause you don't want that to be front\nand center when you go looking for the\njob and the last thing is as terrifying\nas it is get some actual feedback from\npeople who can advise you about like\nwhat how you can strengthen your\nportfolio\nor how to start building one and the\nfact that you're thinking about it it\nsounds like you don't have one yet it's\nactually perfect so what you can even\nask your professors like what makes a\ngood portfolio or ask people who are\nlike if there's like a job placement\ndepartment at your university ask them\nlike how does one build a strong\nportfolio and get some actual answers\nfrom people who may know more and then\nstart moving towards that\nand be aware though because there's one\nreally tricky thing that we don't want\nto uh forget\none tricky tricky a lot of traps here\nbut this is the main trap\nis that even if you get good feedback\nsorry even if you get good feedback\nso recognize this\nthat as you start to improve and as you\nstart to build your portfolio you may\nget this discrepancy between\nconfidence and marketability that the\nbetter you're doing your mind may tell\nyou that you're doing worse\nand even if you get good feedback\nthere's going to be another kind of\nmental trick here where your mind may\ntry to convince you that the feedback is\nnot actually valid even though you're\nthe one that asked for it so be careful\nabout those two little tricks\nokay\nyou"
