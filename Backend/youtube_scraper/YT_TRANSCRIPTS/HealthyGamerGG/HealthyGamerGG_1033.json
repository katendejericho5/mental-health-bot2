    "transcript": "you're starving so bad that you don't\nhave space to share\nright so you're starving and then you\nget a sandwich and you're so starving\nthat all you can think about is eating\nthat sandwich and it feels so good\nto finally get some food\nthat in that process\nof you getting your own needs met\nyou don't have space for another person\nin that relationship\ndr k should address the men desperately\nlooking for partners\nhello and welcome to my controversial\npost i feel i poorly expressed my post\npoint here's my updated post i've seen\nso many posts from my fellow men\nexpressing how they feel about being\nalone i fully admit i myself have done\nit and\neven tired of seeing the same basic\npremise i for one can't imagine how the\nfemale members feel but i imagine they\nfeel objected and annoyed\ni'm aware this is a contentious topic is\na dude who is single and lonely in a new\njob new city and knew everything i get\nit\nhowever\nmostly posts\nthe same stuff\nmost posts say the same stuff i'm horny\nalone no woman will ever be able will\nlove me because i'm ugly i don't talk to\nwomen and none like me i don't go out\nand talk to women and i'm angry about\nthat i just want a girlfriend for sex or\nfor intimacy which isn't really healthy\nthe reasons are inherently bad and\nreally won't get you to your goal many\nof my fellow men wallow in loneliness\nand feel sex and romantic intimacy will\nget them what they want\nand it may for a time\nhowever if you don't love you if you\naren't okay with you if you're not the\nperson you want to love then you'll\nlikely have issues with the relationship\ni'm no expert but\ni i am a guy and i can tell you that\nwhile being horny alone sucks being in a\ntoxic relationship is worse than hell\nwork on yourself bros focus on you but\nmost importantly put yourself out there\nand remember that rejection is rejection\nto the guys who are emotionally abused\nvalid and don't know how to talk to\nwomen i was cheated on valid and i don't\nfeel comfortable with women these guys\nneed help and time don't jump into\ndating take time to focus on you and\nthat's the core of it you need to focus\non you no matter who you are if you come\noff as desperate depressed angry and or\nwomen are just reproductive organs then\nyou'll literal\nyou'll likely keep incurring the same\nproblem\nwhile i sympathize with you guys we need\nto focus on us and not make sex in a\nrelationship the goal\nhere's my original post\ni as a man i'm tired of seeing my fellow\nlonely men cry about being alone i fully\nadmit i myself have done it and even\ntired of it i i for one can't imagine\nhow the female members feel\nwhy am i tired of it because they say\nthe same stuff i'm horny alone no women\nwill be able to love me because i'm ugly\ni know talk to women and unlike me i was\nemotionally abused valid and don't know\nhow to talk to women i was cheated on\nvalid and i don't feel comfortable with\nwomen the first half where the guys in\nessence horny alone is so overdone\ni'm sorry guys but holy moly if you want\nto meet women you need a social life and\nif that's all your goal is then your\ndesperation will precede you\nno one likes desperate\nso many of my fellow men wallow in\nloneliness and feel sex and romantic\nintimacy will get them what they want\nand it may be for a time\nhowever if you don't love you if you\naren't okay with you if you're not the\nperson you want to love then you'll\nlikely have issues with the relationship\ni'm no expert but i i am a guy and i can\ntell you that while being horny and\nalone sucks being in toxic relationship\nis worse than hell\nwork on yourself\nbros focus on you but most importantly\nput yourself out there and remember that\nrejection is rejection\nmods updated for clarity of opinions\nmods feel free to delete this if it's\ntoo toxic okay\nso this is a fantastic post first of all\nbecause i think we're learning as a\ncommunity right so i think this post\ncomes across is more invalidating\nharsher\nthis post i think is a little bit more\nnuanced in depth which is wonderful\nand so i do want to talk to you all\ntoday a little bit about this issue\nand what i'm sort of talking about is\nthat there are a lot of posts out there\nthere are a lot of people out there who\nfeel lonely and desperate\nthey want love\nyou know or they want sex\nor they want all of the above they want\nintimacy\nand they feel incredibly sometimes they\nfeel incredibly frustrated they feel\nlike the world is an unfair place they\nfeel like\nyou know they're they've been dealt a\ncrappy hand of cards which essentially\ndooms them\nto\nloneliness\nthey feel desperate\nand sometimes when we feel desperate and\nwe don't get something that we want we\nreally want to blame the whole world\nfor our situation\nwhich isn't necessarily wrong right so\nlike let's just acknowledge for a moment\nthat\na lot of things about our life are not\ndetermined by us like the fact that i am\nnot the son of a billionaire\nor that you know i had abuse of parents\nor like all these things are karma\nthey're not determined by us so the\ntruth of the matter is that sometimes\nthings like not everything that we do is\nour fault not all of our circumstances\nare our fault in fact most of our\ncircumstances aren't our fault\nthere's also are there all kinds of\nother like karmic things which can make\nrelationships easy for you so for\nexample did you grow up with an intact\nhousehold\ndid you learn from your parents how to\nnavigate conflict did you learn from\nyour parents how to express feelings did\nyou learn from your parents how to\nrespect boundaries did you learn from\nyour parents how to lay boundaries\nso some of us who grew up with with you\nknow good households loving households\nlearn a lot of this stuff intrinsically\nand it kind of gets baked in at a very\nyoung age\nthere's also a lot of stuff about\nself-worth here because if you don't\nfeel good about yourself and you're\ndesperate and hungry and\nand horny and alone and you want\nintimacy\npeople sort of believe that the\ndesperation carries through and since\ni'm ugly and i'm desperate i'm screwed\nno one will ever love me\nand those feelings are like completely\nvalid even some of the points that they\nmake are completely valid\nnow a lot of times what will happen is\nat some point like in this discussion\npeople will start talking about society\nright they'll say like society is this\nsociety is that i've made that mistake\nbefore so let me just start by sort of\nsaying the way we're gonna address this\ntoday is not by talking about society\nit's not about like\nwhat society does for us or doesn't do\nfor us these are all valid and important\ndiscussions i'm not saying they aren't\nso for example you know the role of\nmasculinity is rapidly changing\nmen face particular problems women face\nparticular problems non-binary people\nface particular problems i'm not trying\nto invalidate any of those perspectives\nat the same time when i see\nthese kinds of issues what i hear\nis you're desperate you're lonely\nsure you had a rough life\nand the desperation will precede you\nand you have to focus on yourself you\nhave to learn to love yourself you have\nto be happy with yourself to enter into\na healthy relationship we hear all these\ntruisms\ndoes anyone tell us how\ndoes anyone say here is how you love\nyourself\nhere are the steps\nso here's what i find is the biggest\nproblem\nthat men in the situation run into\nis that i find that there it's very\ndifficult for them\nto think about someone else's needs\nokay\nso there are a lot of lonely and\ndesperate men\nin this situation\nand you can sort of say like work on\nyourself first and then you can sort of\nenter into a relationship\nbut the truth of the matter is that like\nthis is not easy to do so we have this\nconcept right of like bringing yourself\nup by your bootstraps\nand we kind of think about this in the\nfinancial sense that like you can be a\nself-made millionaire\nbut the truth of the matter is that like\nit's very it's way easier to have\ngood financial circumstances at the\nget-go when you launch on your financial\njourney that leads to a lot more success\nthan pulling yourself up by the nature\nof your own you know strength and guts\nand all that kind of stuff\nand the interesting thing is that this\nis true from an emotional and\nrelationship standpoint as well\nlike self-worth\nis oftentimes given to you which is\nweird because it's sort of self-worth\nright but if we think about kids who\ngrow up confident and love like they\nhave a huge advantage\nso if you're someone who's lonely and\ndesperate\npeople say work on yourself first but\nlike working on yourself i know it's\nkind of weird but\nis rarely a solo pursuit so this is the\nfirst thing is we can say work on\nyourself and we will teach you how to\nwork on yourself so don't worry about\nthat but let's just acknowledge how hard\nit is to work on yourself and this\ndoesn't apply to men only by the way\nright so this is like sure there are a\nlot of men who face the situation but\nit's like\nif you're someone who is desperate for\nconnection feeling lonely feeling horny\ncraving intimacy\nand that desperation precedes you you\ncome across as clingy you come across as\npathetic you come across as desperate\nyou tend to drive people away\nthat's a really hard thing to overcome\nbecause like let's just think a little\nbit about how does that person overcome\nthat\nsure you can do this mythical internal\nwork you can go to india and stay at an\nashram for tons and tons of months and\nyears and and study to become a monk but\nthe truth is even in my own life like i\nhad a woman who accepted me and\nyou know far before i accepted myself\nso the truth of the matter is that human\nbeings are community creatures\nwe're community organisms we're not like\nmost human growth\njust\nhistorically does not happen in a cabin\nin the woods\nright human growth and human connection\nand like becoming who you are happens\nwith mentorship happens with like you\nknow hopefully parental love\nyou you know your bros who are there for\nyou siblings who are there for you\nyour girls who are there for you it\ncomes from other people\neven studies of of borderline\npersonality disorder and narcissistic\npersonality disorder\nclearly demonstrate the value of social\nconnection and we know that social\ncapital there have been tons of study\nabout the positive impacts of social\ncapital on mental health\nso being a part of community that cares\nabout you is huge for your own sense of\nidentity\nand so how do we navigate this because\nlike the truth is that like\nunfortunately it's very hard to just\nlearn how to love yourself\njust all on your own so you can it can\nbe done\nbut i think if we really look at the way\nthat the majority of people learn how to\nrespect themselves it actually comes\nwith some interaction from other people\nso how do we tackle this problem\nthe first thing that we have to be super\ncareful about is misdiagnosis\nokay so i don't mean this in a clinical\nsense but i mean that oftentimes when\nhuman beings come up with\nwhen they face a problem their mind\ngenerates an answer\nbut the mind isn't really like critical\nabout it right so if you think about why\nam i alone\nyour mind will say oh because i'm ugly\nor because i'm desperate and i just reek\ndesperation from my pores\nbut if we really think about you know\nlet's say you've had a set of\nrelationships you've gone on dates and\nthings like that\nthe reason that you're\nalone\nisn't just what you think in your head\nactually the the best sources of\ninformation are going to be the people\nthat you date right\nthe tricky thing is that oftentimes we\ndon't really respect boundaries we don't\nhave good ways of collecting feedback we\ndon't know how to interact with those\npeople so we don't really know\nwhy they choose not to date us again and\nthen we formulate our own conclusions\nbut what are those conclusions based on\nthey're based on our own biases\nit must be because i'm ugly it must be\nbecause i'm desperate\nwhereas in my experience the biggest\nthing that\nlonely men tend to miss and it's once\nagain it's not just men\nis that they\nthey feel desperate\nand so they think that that desperation\ncomes through\nbut oftentimes it becomes about your own\nneeds\nso it's not the fact that you're\ndesperate it's that you have such\nyou're starving so bad that you don't\nhave space to share\nright so you're starving and then you\nget a sandwich and you're so starving\nthat all you can think about is eating\nthat sandwich and it feels so good\nto finally get some food\nthat in that process\nof you getting your own needs met\nyou don't have space for another person\nin that relationship\nso when you're starving and you get a\nsandwich\nit's so hard to tear that sandwich in\nhalf or give half of the sandwich to\nyour partner\nso the first thing that that i tend to\nnotice in these kinds of people is that\nthey there's a focus on the self which\nis not sort of it's not their fault i\ndon't blame them for having this\nbecause this is what tends to happen is\nlike you know the starving person thinks\nabout eating themselves like why are\nthey in that situation it's because\nthey're starving so it's like a natural\nconsequence of being alone of being\nstarved for affection for being starved\nfrom intimacy\nand so then what happens is like when\nyou enter into a relationship there just\nisn't space for the other person so it's\nnot that they're avoiding you because\nyou're desperate and ugly it's because\nlike there isn't a relationship for them\nto participate in\nthere's just needs to be met\nand this is how sometimes women feel\nobjectified because in a sense they are\nright because like you're busy getting\nyour needs met and once again it's not\nwe're sort of adopting a male to female\nkind of perspective but can be the other\nway around too\nwhere like when you enter into a\nrelationship with someone who's who's\nstarving\nthere's going to be a period of time\nwhere like they don't have the bandwidth\nto take care of you\nand the tricky thing is that sometimes\neven desperate lonely men will\nbe on the other side of the table in an\nequally toxic way where they enter into\nrelationships where they are the giver\nthe giver the giver the giver the giver\nbecause they know they can empathically\nthey know what it's like to be alone and\nstarve for affection\nthe problem is that that's not\nsustainable\nso you're the giver the giver the giver\nthe giver the giver\nand then as you give and you give and\nyou give and you give and you give they\nstart to your partner potentially starts\nto feel healthier\nand then\nsomething falls apart because this is\nnot a healthy even relationship\nso either they become dependent on you\nor they become independent of you in\nwhich case the only thing that you have\nto give is what you give\nand so this the premise the relationship\nis lopsided and it can't grow into an\nequal relationship\nso it's really tricky\nit's scary one of the most terrifying\nthings i've ever seen for people who are\ninsecure\nwho take care of other people in\nrelationships the most terrifying thing\nis that the person that i am taking care\nof will no longer need my help\nbecause what i bring to them is taking\ncare of them\nand if they no longer need me if they no\nlonger need the care i provide then they\nno longer need me and in the worst\nsituations this actually turns into\nsabotage\nwhere like i'm afraid you're gonna leave\nme if you get better\nand that's where the relationship has to\ngrow right it has to turn into something\nelse otherwise it can't survive\nso first thing that you've got to be\ncareful about\nis misdiagnosis be careful about where\nyour mind generates and what's the\nquality of information have you had a\nseries of long and honest conversations\nbetween people who are like comfortable\nwith sharing this information about what\nchallenges they had with you in the\nrelationship because unless you're\ngetting that information from your\npartner chances are you really have no\nidea this is where like even after a\nbreakup you may have like a single\nconversation or people may be emotional\ni hate you because you did this and you\ndidn't that's not like a real\nconversation that's just people venting\nemotionally\nso first thing is be careful about\nmisdiagnosis\nthe second thing is that if you're in\nthis situation okay how can you work on\nyourself\nhow can you work on other people how can\nyou make space for other people so today\nwhat i'm going to talk to you all about\nis actually really interesting\nit's about met the meditation\nso i think met the meditation or loving\nkindness meditation is a particular\nbranch of meditation that's designed to\ndevelop gratitude and compassion towards\nyourself and other people\nand the really fascinating thing about\nmet the meditation we're going to look\nat a little bit of science\nand we're going to look at the the the\nsubstance of methyl meditation what\nwe'll actually see is that all of the\nproblems that these people suffer from\nare sort of fixed\nin a nuanced way through method\nmeditation\nso the first thing\nis that when i'm lonely and desperate\nthe only person i'm thinking about is\nmyself\nthat's not really i don't really\nconsider it selfishness so i'm not\nsaying that these people are selfish\nbut it's more just that i'm so\npreoccupied with myself even in the\nrelationship i'm so preoccupied with\nmyself oh my god am i coming across as\ndesperate oh my god i'm so ugly\nthis isn't selfishness it is focus on\nthe self you can't stop thinking about\nyourself in these relationships\nit's not necessarily a good way you're\nnot like oh my god i'm so beautiful\nbut literally there is not space in your\ncognition for another human being\ni'm so busy thinking about how ugly i am\ni'm not paying attention to the fact\nthat the person that i'm dating is\nblushing when i give them a compliment\nand clearly feels that i'm out of their\nleague\nright because they may be feeling that\nbut when i when i feel like i'm an ugly\nperson like beauty is in the eye of the\nbeholder and if i think i'm ugly then\nthat's what i think i'm going to be i'm\ngoing to completely ignore the other\nperson's perspective\nso the first thing that met the\nmeditation does is helps us move outside\nof ourself\nand to think about other people\nthe second thing that met the meditation\ndoes which we'll talk about in a second\nis\nhelps us\naccept that we are not in complete\ncontrol of things\nso the other damaging thing about sort\nof lonely desperate men\nis that there's a determinism to it\nright i'm desperate i'm ugly therefore\nthis is fixed and i'm screwed\nand then in the worst cases what happens\nis people start to like hate the\nopposite sex\nright so it's not necessarily just men\nbecause we're sort of seeing this with\nwomen too\nwhere we can start to like assume all\nkinds of things about the opposite sex\nso we need to do is step away from that\ndeterminism we need to step away from\nthe fact that like everything is laid\nout we need to encourage some sense of\nlike a question mark when it comes to\nthe future because when i'm lonely and\ndesperate and the future is hopeless a\nquestion mark is a movement in the right\ndirection so we'll see how met the\nmeditation does that\nthe next thing is that there are all\nkinds of different\naspects\nfrom a from a scientific perspective so\nwe'll take a quick look at a paper\nthat talk a little bit about\nthese um\nlet me find this right i think\nso\nthere are all kinds of things that met\nthe meditation has been shown to do and\nthese are the things that i truly\nbelieve\nneed to be focused on by this population\nso if we look at men who have difficulty\nbeing empathic difficulty loving\nthemselves difficulty loving other\npeople this is where the\nattitude of like you know the partners\nthat they end up with\nfeel used\nright and why is that and it's because\nlike they have sometimes we have\ndifficulty like acknowledging that\nanother person is a person so let's just\ntake a quick look at a\npaper so this is a study from um\nlet me just page this four okay\nso this is can compassion meditation\ncontribute to the development of\npsychotherapists empathy\nso this is looking at meditation like\nmet the meditation it's a really great\nreview highly recommend it\nbut i'm going to highlight this actually\nso\nsince very few studies of\nloving-kindness and self-compassion\nexclusive focus exclusively on health\ncare professionals let us consider the\nimpact of these meditation practices in\nthe general population so interestingly\nenough what i'm sharing with y'all is\nnot about psychotherapists or caregivers\nbut it's about the general population\nso self-compassion has been linked to\nless anxiety and depression do you think\nthis will help the lonely desperate male\ni think so\ngreater wisdom and emotional\nintelligence what are you feeling what\ndrives you emotionally what are your\nemotional needs that get met\ndo you think this is important for the\nlonely desperate male\ni think so as well as feelings of social\nconnectedness and life satisfaction\ndo you think this is important for the\nlonely desperate male\nself compassion also fosters the\nintrinsic motivation to learn and grow\nit promotes health-related behaviors and\nit is beneficial for interpersonal\nrelationships\ndoes this sound important to the lonely\ndesperate male\nso in their study examining the link\nbetween self-compassion and concern for\nthe well-being of others neph and\npommier\nobserved a modest correlation between\nself-compassion and empathic concern but\na more robust negative link\nbetween personal distress and\nself-compassion\nokay\nso\nif we think about the dimensions\nthat for lack of a better term the\nlonely desperate male\nneeds to improve on\ndepression and anxiety hell yeah\nsocial connectedness absolutely\nyou know emotional awareness\nand wisdom\nmotivation to like grow as a human being\nabsolutely\nright improve like health for like\nhealth-promoting behaviors like\nabsolutely\nand most importantly\nremoving that negative distress\ncorrelation with self-compassion so the\nway that you feel about yourself so\nwe're gonna\nflash back to this post for a second\nso the way that you feel about yourself\nright so\nlet's go to the unfiltered one\ni'm horny and alone no women will ever\nlove me because i'm\nugly i don't talk to women none like me\ni was emotionally abused i don't feel\ncomfortable this is all that negative\ndistress\nwhich people sort of assume is the\ndesperation that women can sniff they\ncan smell desperation from a while away\ni don't i in my experience i think\nthat's kind of like a\nit's an unfair characterization of women\nbecause in my experience actually\ndesperation doesn't necessarily cause\npeople to run away it just means that\nyou can't form a healthy relationship\nwith them not because you're desperate\nbut because like a healthy relationship\nrequires two people caring about each\nother\ni know tons of people not just women who\nare compassionate or willing to help\ndesperate people in fact my experience\nhas largely been that when someone is\ndesperate that brings out the best of\npeople\nin terms of how much we try to help\npeople and support people and i've\ntalked to lots of women who have tried\nto date men like this\nand what i usually find is that they try\nreally hard\nright they'll try to be supportive\nthey'll try to be kind they'll date them\nfor a while but there's just such a\nthick shell of self-loathing that like\nyou just can't fix that\nright i'm not saying there aren't bad\nwomen out there i'm not saying there\naren't bad men out there i'm not saying\nthat desperation brings out the\ndalai lama out of every human being on\nthe planet\nbut i think that we have to be a little\nbit careful about the conclusions that\nwe form\nand i know that there are a lot of\npeople especially in our community who\nare fixers\nright who actually like have their best\nfoot forward when it comes to helping\nanother human being they find their\ndharma they try to help someone you know\nimprove their situation\ni feel confident about that in terms of\nour community but what do we see here we\nsee this negative distress\nand when we have this negative distress\nwhat we tend to find is that\nit reduces our sense of compassion it\nreduces our empathy towards other people\nand once self-compassion is gone\ntoxicity comes out once there's a lack\nof empathy for the other person on the\nother side of the table that\nrelationship is kind of severely\nhandicapped\nyou"
