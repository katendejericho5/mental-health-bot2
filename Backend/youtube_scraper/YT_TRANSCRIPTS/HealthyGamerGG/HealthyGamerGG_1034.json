    "transcript": "so we're going to talk for a second\nabout met the meditation\nso method meditation is called loving\nalso known as loving kindness meditation\nand we're going to talk to y'all a\nlittle bit we're going to go through\nwe're going to do it at the end of\nstream today together\nbut before we do that we're going to go\nahead and take a look at some of the\ncomponents of it okay this is where what\nwe want to kind of look at\nis\nfirst of all meta\nmeans kindness\nand i think meta is a polyword so it's\nnot sunscreen\nso what we want to do is cultivate the\ncompa\ncultivate\na capacity\nfor kindness\nand why is this important\nso let's remember that if we're talking\nabout someone who is let's say the\nlonely desperate male\nor person\nthe first thing to understand is that\noftentimes you know you have thoughts\nlike ugly\ni'm desperate\nthese are people who are starved for\naffection\nso how do you think they feel about\nthemselves\nright so they have\na very\num what's the right word harsh\nview of self\nand then this then projects out into a\nharsh view of the world\nright because beauty is in the eye of\nthe beholder\nand when my eyes are so used to seeing a\nharsh view of the self what i end up\nseeing is a harsh view of the world as\nwell\nand if we look at these people they have\ndifficulty with empathy\nthey have difficulty with compassion\nthey have difficulty with\nsocial connectedness as we've sort of\nalready talked about\nthey also have difficulty with things\nlike depression and anxiety\nnegative feelings worries is maybe\nanother way to put it\nright and then they also have difficulty\nwith like\nlife\nforward\nchoices for lack of a better term so\nthis includes things like health\npromotion behaviors\nbut i would say on a on a deeper level\nit's more like when we say work on\nyourself\nthat involves all kinds of like things\nabout moving your life forward and they\nstruggle with motivation in these things\nand let's understand\nhow that works\nokay\nso now how can cultivating a capacity\nfor kindness help with these sorts of\nthings\nso let's kind of think about that\nso the first is so method meditation\ninvolves kindness towards the self\nand this is important for\nthe life forward motivation\nand why is that\nit's because when i don't think i'm\nworth it\ni'm not worth fixing\nso it's like if i have low value like i\nwant you all to think about the oldest\ncomputer you have in your house\nthat doesn't work anymore\nand i want you to think about how worth\nit\nis it to fix that computer which is\nprobably why it's like sitting if you're\nlike me it's like sitting in your garage\nit's like two decades old and it's just\nlike we haven't thrown it out because we\nmay need it one day\nbut it's not really worth fixing\nand so when we think a little bit about\nyou know how we\nhow our brain calculates like what's\nworth fixing it's the things that are\nvaluable\nand if i'm not valuable\ni'm not worth fixing\nand this is what makes it\nhard to\nwork on myself so we can say work on\nyourself but like it's hard because it's\nnot\nyou know\nit's like what's the point\nso this is important to develop kindness\ntowards yourself and i think met the\nmeditation needs to be modified in my\nopinion we'll talk about that in a\nsecond\nso we sort of dealt with this okay\nsecond thing is when we develop empathy\nand compassion\nthere's room for someone else in the\nrelationship\nand this is important because generally\nspeaking i don't think it's the\ndesperation\nthat drives people away i mean it can\nfor sure but i i choose to believe that\npeople are not so selfish as that\nand like it's not the desperation which\nyou can also get cognitively reinforced\nbecause if they try to help you and like\nyou're\nso unwilling to help them or be helped\nby them\nthat eventually they get fed up and they\nhave to leave and then what you conclude\nis that oh i'm too desperate and they\nsmelled it and they ran away whereas\nthat person is going to have an\nexperience\nof that relationship which oftentimes is\nwhere the misdiagnosis comes in we don't\nreally like talk to them about it right\nbecause we're not really able to hear it\nand when i have a cognitive bias that\ni'm a low value person\nand someone says yeah like i tried to\nhelp you and i just like it wasn't\nworking and you're like oh that means i\ncouldn't be helped i'm unhelpable\nso that's what your mind is going to\nconclude with this is exactly what you\nsee in therapies like when you have\npeople have very low self-worth they\nwill take whatever you say and they will\nspin it in the worst possible thing and\nthey will use it as evidence to\nreinforce their existing beliefs\nso when you have emp when you develop\nempathy and compassion for other people\nthere's going to be room for someone\nelse in the relationship\nand then this in turn is going to reduce\nthe feeling\nof being an object\npotentially for you and and the other\nperson in the relationship this is huge\nso then we kind of talk a little bit\nabout social connectedness\nand i think this essentially follows\nfrom this\nright so like as you connect with\nanother human being as you acknowledge\nyourself as a person as you acknowledge\nthe other person as a person\nnow two people can connect and now it's\nnot about desperate desperate getting\nyour needs met in starvation it's about\ntwo human beings forming a relationship\nand as we do all these things we can\nactually set ourselves up to\nlike actually engage in healthy\nrelationships\nso now the question becomes okay so if\ni've convinced you at this point then\nlike now we get to the how so what is\nthis method meditation and how does it\nwork\nso i'm going to talk to you all about\ntraditional met the meditation\nand when i do met the meditation my kind\nof modified\nor\ndigital digitalgen\ngeneration\nmet the meditation because i think some\nthings have changed\nso traditionally when you do met the\nmeditation what you'll do is you'll\nstart with some kind of phrase\nso like may you be happy\nmay you be free\nmay you be a peace\nso you'll repeat this thought\ndirected towards a particular group of\npeople or person\nso like you'll just literally practice\nlike\nwishing for\nthe object of your meta\nthat these things happen to them\nmay this person be happy may this person\nbe free and may this person be at peace\nnow there are a couple of important\nthings here three really important\nelements the first is the word may\nthis moves away from determinism\nand if we look at this\nthis this is all deterministic like if\nwe talk to people who are desperate and\nalone they have a very deterministic\nview of the world\nno women will love me because i'm ugly\ndeterministic statement i don't talk to\nwomen and none like me deterministic\nstatement i'm emotionally abused and\ndon't know how to talk to women\ndeterministic statement\ni don't feel comfortable with women even\ndeterministic\nright doesn't say i sometimes there's no\nit's all flat it may be valid we're not\nsaying it's wrong but it's deterministic\nso\nso like i want you to just think about\nthis for a second if this person said\nyou know it may be hard for some women\nto love me because of the way that i\nlook versus no women will love me\nbecause i'm ugly which of those\nstatements is healthier\ni don't talk to women and none like me\nversus it's hard for me to talk to women\nand some of them don't like me\ndo you all see the difference between\nthose two statements\nso literally met the meditation starts\nby getting away from determinism\nit acknowledges that there are things\noutside of my control and that the\nfuture is not set in stone\nso it practices this faculty\nsecond thing it does\nis\nmoves focus\naway from the self\nthis is the other problem that these\nkinds of people have\nis that if you look at this sort of\ninternal sense of distress\nthis is a very self-focused distress\npersonal distress so we need to move\naway from that personal element\nwe need to start we need to practice and\ntrain our mind to think about the\nthoughts and feelings and experiences of\nothers\nsure i'm lonely and starved for\naffection but what does this person\nneed what is their experience of this\ninteraction\nso we need to move away from the eye and\nmove towards the you\nand the third element which is really\nimportant is just the cultivation of\npositivity\nnow this is sort of a\nthis is a\na tight rope to be sure\nso it's very easy for the cultivation of\npositivity to move into denial of\ntoxicity\nso we don't we want to be accepting\nwe want to be positive but we don't want\nto invalidate or deny the experience of\nnegativity or toxicity but we can\nabsolutely hope for and wish for\npositivity\nso may this person be free may this\nperson be happy may this person be at\npeace\nnow traditionally\nso these actually we're going to keep\nthese are all the same\nand in terms of the modified i think\nwhat what we've really done is\nunderstand the components of met the\nmeditation i don't know that people\nexplain this stuff when they teach meth\nthe meditation they just say you just\nneed to repeat this stuff\nso we try to add in our modified method\nmeditation is an understanding of the\npsychology at play here when you\ncultivate these kinds of thoughts\nnow traditionally\nthese thoughts are directed\ntowards five\nsets of people the first is they're\ndirected towards the self\nso you say you know may i be happy\nor like you kind of externalize yourself\na little bit so we'll kind of talk about\nthat but you don't say i you say like\nyou know like envision yourself\nand direct that happiness towards\nyourself almost as an external person\nlike imac like close your eyes and\nimagine like\na bird's eye view of like you sitting in\na room and like look at that person\nand try to\nsay may\nthis person be happy\nmay this person be free and may this\nperson be at peace you can use i if you\nwant to\nsecond thing is traditionally they would\nthen direct it towards a guru\nor teacher\nokay\nthird thing is they direct it towards a\nfriend\nfourth thing is directed towards a\nneutral party\nfifth thing is they direct it towards an\nenemy\nso if we kind of think a little bit\nabout wishing these thoughts\ntraditionally they met the people\nbelieve that it's easy to wish for\nyourself happiness we all want happiness\nfor ourselves\nnext thing is that this is back in the\nday of gurus so it's like easy to like\nwant happiness and peace and stuff for\nyour guru because they're your teacher\nyou respect them etc\nnext thing it's easy to direct good\nvibes towards friends\nharder to direct good vibes towards\nbecause it's someone who's doing a lot\nfor you\nso you have presumably natural gratitude\ndirected towards this so we all have\nself-love\nwe all have gratitude\nfriends is like maybe less so than\nsomeone who's like teaching you this\nstuff but you know it's you have good\nvibes pretty easily\nharder\nis towards people who are neutral and\nthe hardest is to try to love or wish\ngood things for your enemies\nnow in the modern day i think this\nchanges\nso the first\nis that i think this is just someone you\nrespect\nso i would start with someone that you\nrespect and appreciate\nit doesn't have to be a friend\nso if you've had like you know a teacher\nwho's had a large impact on your life\nlike an uncle or family member who's\nbeen very positive towards you\ni think we want to step away from sort\nof the spiritual traditions in some ways\nso i think definitely here we want to do\nthat\nso you don't have to direct it towards a\nguru\nsecond thing is we're going to do friend\nand can you wish for your friend to be\nhappy can you say to yourself\nauthentically that may this person be\nhappy may this person be free may this\nperson be at peace\ncan you say that for someone that you\nrespect can you say that for a friend of\nyours generally speaking i hope so\nnow this is where things get interesting\ndepending\non how you feel about yourself\nself is either number three or number\nfour\nso when you think about yourself i think\nit's unfortunate but a lot of people\nthat i've worked with\ncan't\nview themselves even lower than neutral\nso\nif they say to them if they start to\nsend good vibes towards themselves and\nby good vibes i mean literally repeating\nthese thoughts with as much authenticity\nas you can muster and compassion as you\ncan muster it feels wrong\nit's like i don't actually deserve that\ncrap i'm a pos et cetera et cetera et\ncetera if that's the case that's okay\nwe're gonna move you down to the higher\ndifficulty\nno problem so can you direct them\ntowards someone you respect and someone\nwho you appreciate\nsomeone your friend of yours\ngood someone neutral then yourself\nand then lastly an enemy\nso this is what i would say is easier\nfor modern day met the meditation maybe\nself is number three maybe self is\nnumber one and you can do it and that's\ntotally fine there's no but the goal\nhere is to try to\nremember that when we're trying to\ncultivate a new faculty in the mind\nwhat we want to do is\ntry to reduce the conflict in our mind\nso we want to start with a thing that's\neasiest\nit's almost like we're going to play the\ntutorial before we get to level one and\nthen we're going to play level one and\nthen we're gonna play level two and\nwe're gonna play level three now the\nquestion is like back in the day\nthis was the tutorial this was level one\nthis was level two we may have to move\nthat around a little bit\nbecause we've changed as people\nand even if you look at like old texts\nfrom the karmic religions they sort of\nsay that meditation techniques need to\nbe sort of reinterpreted which is why we\nhave multiple teachers\nso there were various incarnations of\nvishnu\nand these people got revered as divine\nright so we're probably spiritual\nteachers essentially\njuries out on whether they're truly\ndivine or whatever we're going to stay\nclear of that metaphysics for today\nand then like later their teachings were\nreinterpreted by the buddha\nfor a different group of people\nand then he developed you know buddhism\nand then later those\num\nyou know teachings have been\nreinterpreted by people like the dalai\nlama by people like you know eckhart\ntolle like all these other teachers that\nhave come even your local meditation\nteacher or yoga teacher will offer their\nown perspective and people will\ngravitate to them so these teachings\nwhich may be true continuously get\nreinterpreted\nand so based on like my understanding of\nthe population that we kind of in the\nworld that we live in like this may be\neasier\nand the goal is to authentically\ncultivate compassion towards these\nobjects\nand to formulate that compassion in this\nparticular phrasing which i think the\nphrasing is powerful and specific and\nthere's a reason why it's structured\nthat way\nso now we're gonna practice met the\nmeditation\nand the goal here is that like you know\nwe're gonna cultivate hopefully all of\nthese things and we know\nactually interestingly enough\nscientifically\nthat this works right so we have data\nfrom scientific studies that show that\nthese are the outcomes that we can\nexpect from a rigorous method meditation\npractice\nokay\nso let's go to the practice itself\nso like i mentioned there's going to be\nmay you be happy may you be free and may\nyou be at peace and what we're\nessentially going to do\nis direct we're going to repeat each of\nthese phrases three times\nwhile directing it towards a particular\nperson\nand what i want you to do is just in\nyourself\ntry to muster up as much authentic\ncompassion as you can\nso you know when you like really want\nsomething like man i really hope eldon\nring is not a disappointment man i can't\nwait to play elderly man it's so awesome\nor when someone says oh yeah i just\nstarted playing elden ring you're like\ndude you are in for a treat\nor man that sucks i'm so sorry for you\nyou know\nso this is where\nyou can generate an authentic emotional\nexperience when thinking about someone\nelse i'm so excited for you\noh you've never been to hawaii it's\namazing man you're going to have the\ntime of your life i really hope you have\na fantastic vacation\nso you can generate authentic\ncompassionate statements directed\ntowards other people so we're going to\ntry to do that with these three phase\nphrases and so what i want you to do is\nas best as you can\nhope that this person\nreally kind of put it out into the\nuniverse that like may this person be\nhappy may this person be free of worries\nor free\nand may this person be at peace\ni hope they don't stress i hope they\ndon't suffer\nand so we're going to pick a someone\nthat you respect or you appreciate first\nand we're going to say this three times\ni'm going to do it silently but you can\ndo it out loud if you want to\nand so imagine that person\npicture them in your mind\nand then\nrepeat this each phrase three times so\nand you can do it kind of in order so\nmaybe happy maybe free may you be at\npeace maybe happy may be free may you be\nat peace\nand then what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to move on to a friend\nand then we're going to move on to a\nneutral person\nand then we're going to move on to\nourselves\nand then we're going to move on to\nsomeone we dislike\nokay and i want you to just notice the\nnatural cultivation of the feelings that\nyou get if you wind up feeling really\npositive towards yourself then you can\nabsolutely move yourself to the top of\nthe list\nyou can also you don't have to do the\nwhole practice with all people right\naway but we're going to do that today\nokay so we're going to sit up straight\nwho's first is respected someone that\nyou respect or appreciate\nokay\nso close your eyes\ntake a few moments to breathe in and\nbreathe out\nand now imagine the first person\nsomeone you respect and appreciate\nbreathe in and out\npicture them in your mind\nand repeat your metaphrases\nthree phrases three times each\nbegin\ndo\nand now we're going to move on to a\nfriend\nso imagine a friend\nsomeone who you care about\nand now repeat our met the kindness\nmeditation towards them\nmay you be happy\nmay you be free\nmay you be at peace\nnow we're going to move on to a neutral\nperson\njust imagine someone that you've\ninteracted with in the last few days\npicture them as best as possible\ntake a moment to kind of\nfocus your mind on that person\nand now send them metta kindness\nthrough our three phrases\nand now picture yourself\nalmost as if you were floating above in\nthe room\nsee yourself\nsitting there\nand now direct mehta\ntowards yourself\nmay you be happy\nmay you be free\nmay you be at peace\nand now direct it towards someone who\nyou have negative feelings towards\npicture that person\nnotice that it may be a little bit\nharder to recall or call up\nthose feelings of compassion\nbut try anyway\nfix that person in your mind\nand send met that to them\nmay you be happy\nmay you be free\nmay you be at peace\ntwo more rounds in your mind\nthank\nnow put your hands together\nin namaste position\nas we bring in begin to bring the\npractice to a close\nand notice all of the world swirling\naround you\nthings that you have to\ndo responsibilities that you have goals\nthat you have wants that you have\nunfulfilled desires\npressures\nworries\nand that in this moment\nyou can find some modicum of peace\nas the rest of the world feels outside\nof you\nand give thanks for this moment\nand for the situation that you're in\nfor the person that you are\nfind gratitude for whatever you can in\nthis moment as authentically as you can\nand with one final breath as you exhale\ngive thanks and open your eyes\nyou"
