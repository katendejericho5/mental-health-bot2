    "transcript": "my kid is bipolar my kid is bipolar and\nI'll be like what does that mean bipolar\nso that is woefully incorrect so I mean\nthat could be true right but I don't\nknow if you want to do that I don't\nunderstand quite what that is that was\nactually pretty\ngood that was that was\ngood we're doing Tik Tok reacts chat\nshall we move on people are going to\nwish that at some point they had taken a\nlittle time to care just a little\ngoddamn\n[Music]\nbit okay so this is uh actually somewhat\nI want to talk about this for a second\nso you know sometimes like we think\nabout this and like people will say like\noh this person is bipolar like they're\nso distressed they want to you know be\nwhat did this person say want to\nbe me having a whole breakdown shaking\non the floor and wishing I was I'm\nassuming that's it would have edit out\ndead which is why they're saying that\nbut so this is actually pretty common\nwhere sometimes when we have emotional\nlability is the term so we're going to\ntalk for a second about bipolar and\nemotional lability so a lot of people\nwill come to me especially like parents\nthey'll say like my kid is bipolar my\nkid is bipolar and I'll be like what\ndoes that mean bipolar they'll say like\nwell one minute they're like happy and\nthe next minute they're like raging\nright they're happy when they're playing\ntheir video game and the second I unplug\nthe internet they're like raging at me\nso this is actually relatively common\nwhere sometimes when people have intense\ninternal distress they'll think that\nthey're bipolar but really what it is is\nemotional ability and what we see is\nthat you'll have this intense distress\nand then they'll even use suicidal\nlanguage but it's not really like\nsuicidality this is where you have to\nreally evalu them right so when you're\nwhen I'm doing an evaluation this are\nthe kinds of questions that I'll ask be\nlike when you say you want to be dead\nlike what does that mean does that mean\nthat you want\nto not feel this way anymore and that's\nwhy you're saying that you want to be\ndead or you like don't enjoy life and\nyou Despair and you know like there's\nnothing to look forward to and then\noften times if you start to Tunnel down\ninto those questions what you'll find is\nthat when people are are very\nemotionally distressed the best way we\nknow how to communicate that is with\nlike suicidal kind of language and I\nknow it's kind of weird but it's sort of\nlike I don't feel good on the inside\nlike that doesn't mean anything to\nanyone right if you walk around you say\nI don't feel good on the inside like how\ndo people respond to that no one knows\nokay did you eat something bad like that\nthat's what people are going to say\nright whereas if you say like I don't\nwant to be alive anymore people\nunderstand that that is a that is\nlanguage that's used to communicate\ndistress you're trying to tell people\nhey I feel really\nterrible and then often times when you\nhave people who who have emotional\nability as opposed to bipolar disorder\nyou'll sort of see that people will\nbounce back pretty\nquickly and so that's kind of common now\nsometimes this can be a sign of a\npsychiatric illness I mean if you're\nhaving suicidal thoughts you should\nabsolutely absolutely go see\nsomeone but bipolar disorder is\ngenerally speaking characterized by\nperiods of time like weeks of feeling a\nparticular way it's not like feeling\nthis way one minute and this way the\nnext minute that's really more emotional\nability\n[Music]\nI don't understand quite what that is so\nthis person I guess this means okay\nintrusive thoughts I'm confused so y'all\nhave to explain to me what what this\nperson is trying to\nconvey oh brain is overheating from\nstress yeah so this too I mean hopefully\nwe'll have something for yall soon about\nthis\nbut I think somewhere along the way\nwe've lost control of our minds I I\ndon't know how else to say this but\nso you know like we control our bodies\nright like I can do\nthis I can do this I can do stuff with\nmy body but when it comes to like our\nmind we've like lost control of it and I\nthink honestly technolog is making it\nworse because what's happening with\ntechnology is when I feel bad about\nstuff now what do I do I don't use I\ndon't force my mind to do something I\nuse technology as a crutch to make it do\nsomething so when I'm bored for example\nexample like if I'm trying to\nstudy I can't restrain my attention on\nthe object of study why is that it's\nbecause when my mind gets bored I'll go\nwatch something and then it removes the\nneed for my mind to be forced to do a\nparticular\nthing is this does that make sense it's\nlike we used to need to force our mind\nto do things but now with like\ntechnology it's like it's so easy for\nour mind to be like this like I mean\n[Music]\njust right and so what we end up doing\nis we just end up turning to like when\nwhen we're mentally distressed like that\nwhat do you think this person does they\nend up watching something or being on\nTik Tok or whatever right and then once\nyou like once you create that sense of\ndistraction you play a video game then\nthe mind kind of calms down and then\nwhen you stop doing that sort of thing\nit starts up again and so then you end\nup in a situation where you kind of get\nlike this crutch where you're sort of\ndependent on technology for managing\nlike the\noverheating thoughts and emotions in\nyour head cuz you're using technology\nyou're using something like an engaging\nYouTube video or a dopam energic meme or\na very intense like horror video game to\ncalm your mind down and create certain\nstates of mind for you and the more that\nyou use the technology to create this\nstate of mind within you the more\ndependent you become on it because you\ndon't know how to make it on your own\nand once you get to the point where like\nyou've really lost a lot of that\ncapacity then you end up like this where\nyou just your thoughts are\njust all over the place dangerous mama I\ncaught the ADHD it's not contagious\njimothy but why do you say that cuz this\nguy on Tic Tac is relatable jimothy\ndon't go self diagnosing on Tik Tac why\nnot Mama because everyone on planet\nEarth will experience an ADHD symptom\nonce in a while because we all have\nexecutive functions the distinct\ndifference is whether those symptoms\nhappen once in a while or they intrude\non your daily life and are reoccurring\nmore often I thought everyone's ADHD was\ndifferent mom well this is just based on\nthe current criteria in the dsm5 which\nis controversial within itself how do I\nknow if I truly got it told jth that Tik\ntocker has a link in his bio to a self\nscreening test so you can fill that out\nwe'll talk about it and then we can go\nto your doctor thanks Mama that was\nactually pretty\ngood that was that was\ngood more Nuance than I was expecting\nyeah so okay let's talk about this for a\nsecond so first thing is that this is\nlike a pretty accurate representation so\nremember that ADHD so like is really\ngood actually so\na lot of people are going to have\nsymptoms of ADHD right and so this is\nthe problem with sort of like the Google\nMD which is that like if you look for a\nparticular symptom you know you can sort\nof find it as part of an illness but the\nkey thing about like true diagnosis is\nthat it's not just whether you check\nthat box it's like it's a constellation\nof different things it's the severity\nhow often do you check that box this\nperson's good he talks about you know\nhow it's like it's it's everyone's going\nto experience stuff occasionally it's\nabout the consistency of what you\nexperience which is excellent they also\nmanaged to talk about how the DSM is\ncontroversial which it absolutely is and\nif you all are not aware of what he's\ntalking about so let's just talk about\nthe DSM for a second so a long time\nago um there were a group of researchers\nwho were trying to figure out how are we\ngoing to make the the research that we\ndo uniform so if I'm making an\nanti-depressant medication and you're\nmaking an anti-depressant medication\nhow do we determine whether the people\nthat are coming into our study are\ndepressed or not depressed that's the\nmain question they had what they came up\nwith was something called the diagnostic\nand statistic manual and they said when\nwe're going to study people who have\ndepression these are the criteria we're\ngoing to use this is the line that we're\ngoing to draw people on this side of the\nline have depression or okay for the\nstudy people on that side of the line\nare not don't have depression or not\nokay for the study but it's a research\ntool it's it's a set of inclusion\ncriteria for a scientific study which\nis different right it's just like who\ngets in the study it doesn't necessarily\nmean they're depressed or not depressed\nit's a way of uniform creating\nuniformity between\nstudies so Along Comes the DSM it's\nfantastic I think it's a really good\nInnovation but it's not a clinical tool\nit's a research tool then what happens\nis like insurance companies kind of come\nalong and they're sort of trying to\nfigure out okay how do we tell if this\nperson is like getting treatment or not\ngetting treatment if they're doing a\ngood job or not doing a good job and\nremember that these research studies are\ntracking certain symptoms within this\npopulation so now insurance starts using\nthe DSM to determine whether they're\ngoing to pay you to see this person or\nnot because if the person does not meet\nDSM criteria we're not going to pay you\nand that's what that then suddenly like\nit becomes like part of a clinical\ntreatment and now it's being used\nclinically but the key thing about the\nDSM it was never designed as a clinical\ntool it was not designed for humans it\nwas designed as a research tool for\ninclusion criteria\nso that creates a lot of the controversy\nbecause this is the tricky thing about\nthe DSM is you can meet DSM criteria and\nhave the disease or meet DSM criteria\nand not have the disease because it's\ncheckboxes the other the flip of it is\nalso true where you can not meet DSM\ncriteria so you don't check enough boxes\nand you still have the disease and you\ncannot meet DSM criteria and you can\nhave uh and and you Cann have the\ndisease too so it's kind of interesting\nbecause it's not like a gold standard\nit's like a set of you know five or\nseven or nine or 12 different criteria\nand if you have like five out of the\nnine criteria for major depressive\ndisorder you get\ndiagnosed and so this is kind of like\nreally common and I think it's actually\na good representation of how it's really\neasy to see something relate to it and\nthen want to give yourself a\ndiagnosis but that's not really\nappropriate and I I actually think this\nis good what this person is saying is\nthat you know by all means fill out a\nscreening questionnaire and then go talk\nto an actual doctor because that's what\nclinical diagnosis is all about this is\npretty\ngood so it says nothing no it doesn't\nsay nothing this is important what it\ndoes is it's really a research tool so\nwhat it does is it gives you a\nprobability but it's not a it's not a\ndiagnostic tool right so it sort of says\nif I take a thousand people who who\ncheck five of these nine boxes you know\nthere's an 80% chance that these people\nwill have depression for example so it's\na probabilistic tool that's what makes\nthings really really hard and the other\nthing about DSM criteria is that they\ntend to be like subtle and Nuance\nthere's also a bunch of stuff that's not\nI mean that's a part of DSM criteria\nthat you'll never see on Tik Tok so for\nexample if you're talking about major\ndepressive disorder you have to have\nsymptoms for at least two weeks so the\nsingle most thing that is absent from\nmost of the social media analysis of\nmental health is the duration of\nsymptoms in the frequency of syp it's\nthe time Dimension what everyone talks\nabout is like the actual symptom or what\nis emotionally relatable without talking\nabout duration and frequency and\nintensity and stuff like that and that's\na huge part of the DSM it's like oh I'm\nsad today does that make you dep like\nclinical depression does that mean you\nhave MDD no has to be present for at\nleast two weeks\n[Music]\nyeah so this is the problem so this is\ngood in a sense right so I think this\nperson's trying to educate people and\nstuff like that that's pretty cool um\nbut I think that the challenge here is\nthat each of these symptoms has a\ndifferential right so like this is this\nis what I think is kind of a little bit\nproblematic about this kind of this is\nwhy diagnos I I don't know if this what\nthis was supposed to turn into but it's\nwhat it's turning into\nso what we're going to do is take a look\nat we're going to explain some Basics\nabout diagnosis today\nokay so this is the basic problem with\nlike social media and mental health\nstuff so now let's let's look at this\nhere's the problem with this so this is\ngood in a sense so if we look at ADHD at\nwork and people do people who struggle\nwith time management could they have ADH\nyes that is correct it is accurate do\nthey struggle with deadlines yes that is\naccurate can they get into arguments at\nwork yes that is\naccurate and I don't really blame these\npeople for doing this I think they're\ntrying to spread awareness and stuff but\nthe problem is that in medicine we have\na differential\ndiagnosis so that means is that there's\na bunch of other stuff so let's say I'm\na narcissistic\n[ __ ] am I going to have problems with\ntime management at work very possibly\nbecause I don't really care about\nshowing up to meetings cuz I don't care\nabout other people deadlines if it's not\nimportant to me then like who cares\nabout that do I get into arguments at\nwork\nabsolutely now let's look at other\nsubstance\nuse let's say I am addicted to opiates\ncould I have trouble with time\nmanagement absolutely could I miss\ndeadlines at work absolutely could I get\ninto arguments absolutely\nright and like the list goes on like it\ndoesn't even have to be medical stuff\nit's like what if I'm mentally checked\nout and don't give a\n[ __ ] a problem with time management\nsure do I miss deadlines sure do I get\ninto arguments with people at work\nabsolutely so here's the challenge right\nso I think that like this is the problem\nthe fundamental problem with this kind\nof mental health information is that you\ncan check the boxes and the person's\nright like those are common\nmanifestations it's also really\ninteresting that they included arguments\nso for example let's go into this for a\nsecond because I think this is actually\nreally cool an under underappreciated\nsymptom of\nADHD is attentional\nproblems within\nconversation so a lot of the workplace\nconflict that I see with people with\nADHD is they're like they're having a\nconversation someone is like hey can you\nmake sure you mail that out before the\nend of the day and you're distracted so\nyou say yeah sure and then you don't do\nit and then they get pissed at you the\nnext day CU you're not attending to the\nconversation and this also manifests as\nwhat people think\nforgetfulness but it's not that you're\nforgetful it's that it never sank in in\nthe first place you have no problem with\nrecall it's that you weren't attending\nto that information when it came in so I\nthink this is it's cool because this\nperson is sort of highlighting that it's\nnot just executive function things it's\nnot time management and deadlines and\nstuff like that the other interesting\nthing which we won't go into is there's\neven some contrary research that shows\nthat people with ADHD actually respond\nbetter in situations with deadlines and\ncrises so if you have ADHD for example\nI've seen that a lot of people work\nreally well in real estate with ADHD\nbecause they actually have tons of\ncrises and deadlines and that somehow\nlike keeps them motivated to like and\nstrangely enough they're not like fully\norganized I don't know if you all have\nlike seen like real estate people who\naren't fully organized but they kind of\nlike show up and you know they kind of\nget things done and and stuff like that\nit's kind of\nweird but I I think you know when yall\nare watching stuff on Tik Tok like it's\ncool to sort\nof relate to this and the the problem is\nthat that doesn't mean that you have\nADHD because there could be all kinds of\nother things that could be going on as\nwell part 54 if two people are arguing\nstand between them and eat something\nit'll help alleviate the tension when\nyou want to motivate yourself ask will I\ninstead of saying I will this makes you\nwant to do it more if you want someone\nto be honest ask them questions at night\npeople open up when they're tired wait\nwhat psychology hacks part 54 if two\npeople are arguing stand between them\nand\neat stand between them and eat\nsomething so I mean that could be true\nright but I don't know if you want to do\nthat like I'm confused like if if my\nparents are having a fight is this\nperson suggesting that I stand between\nmy parents and start eating\nfood I I mean I know I know it works so\nthere there's there's like there's\nvalidity to this I'm not saying it's not\nit right so like generally speaking when\npeople are angry with each other there's\na lot of eye contact there's body\nlanguage you can kind of disrupt that by\nstanding between them and disrupting the\neye contact and body language but I'm\nnot sure there's also a lot of stuff\naround eating which I think is actually\npretty good here because eating is kind\nof a general so there's this other thing\nfrom uh just something you learn in\nresidency is it's it's hard for people\nto be pissed at you when you guys are\neating something together so when people\nwere like mad at me often times we'd\nstart with like food like in the\nemergency room it's like hey man do you\nwant to eat something they're like no\nit's like here like have a cracker like\nI'll have a cracker you have a cracker\nyou're eating you're kind of like it\nkind of disrupts the flow of things it's\nactually it's not I just don't know that\nI don't know how practical this is like\nare you walking around with a piece of\nApple to just stand between people when\nthey're\narguing something it'll help alleviate\ndetention when you want to motivate\nyourself ask Will i instead of saying I\nwill I don't know if I agree with that\none when you motivate when you want to\nmotivate yourself ask Will i instead of\nI will but what if the answer is\nno right I'm not I'm not sure about that\nso this could be also touching on\nmotivational interviewing\nand you know like because so in\nmotivational interviewing we know that\ntelling people to do things before\nthey're ready is bad so forcing people\nto commit to things when they're not\nready to commit is tends to be a mistake\nwhat's more effective is asking them\nbecause then you're trying to get a\nsense of what their internal conflict is\nso this is kind of good because it\ntouches on ambivalence which is like you\nknow before I commit to something I'm\nconflicted right so conflict comes\nbefore commitment and that internal\nconflict one of the ways in motivational\ninterviewing that we address that\ninternal conflict is by asking people\nlike open-ended questions about okay are\nyou going to study today why or why not\nand then as people think through why\nthey may or may not study that does\nactually move them towards motivation so\nthere could be some sense of this that\nis correct um but I don't know that just\nasking yourself will I is more\nmotivating than I will because I've seen\nthe opposite too which is later on when\nyou get into you know like later stages\nof like addiction recovery and stuff you\ndon't want to ask yourself will I have a\ndrink today you want to say like I ain't\ngoing to have a drink today come hell or\nhigh water it ain't going to happen so\nat some point you want to commit but\nthere's some value to this it's\ninteresting this makes you want to do it\nmore if you want I don't think that's\ntrue it depends on where you are\ncognitively someone to be honest ask\nthem questions at night people open up\nwhen they're\ntired that could be somewhat true too so\npeople are sometimes disinhibited\nwhen they are tired and when they are\ndisinhibited you may get different\nanswers that may be less covered by\ntheir inhibitions but there are a couple\nof important assumptions there the first\nis that assuming people are tired at\nnight which is like I'm not sure if\nthat's the case like maybe ask him first\nthing in the\nmorning and I I don't the other thing is\nthat you're going to get just because\nthe answer is disinhibited does not mean\nthat it is a better answer so for\nexample like our inhibitions are a very\nvery important part of our social\nfunctioning and so this is where I don't\nknow how to say this but like the world\nthrives on inhibited people being able\nto talk to each other so I don't know\nthat you actually want to do that but I\nmean it's true that people are sometimes\ndisinhibited when they're tired here's a\ndark psychology trick to make anybody\nfall in love with you this is 100%\nmanipulation I do not recommend doing\nthis to anybody because it is super\ntoxic and I'm only making a video on it\nso you can at least be aware of if it's\nhappening to you it's just a three-step\nhot and cold technique where you first\nhave to build up a pattern of pleasure\nand validation just making this person\nfeel amazing around you and then you\nhave to break it emotionally and\nphysically you have to pull away from\nthem because this is going to make them\nfeel insecure like [ __ ] most importantly\nthe need to Chase and get that\nvalidation back from you that they just\ngot addicted to and then you just have\nto turn that on button back on again and\nstart validating them this is going to\nmake them fall in love with you but in a\nvery unhealthy attachment Style\nyou know until they figure out what the\n[ __ ] you're doing good luck so that is\nwoefully incorrect so let's talk about\nthis for a second this may work but\nhere's the biggest is here's a dark\npsychology trick to make is the word\nanybody this isn't going to work on\nanybody this is going to work on a very\nvery small percentage of people that are\ninsecure and can be manipulated by overt\nvalidation which maybe that's a larger\npercentage of the population than I\nexpect especially if this is Tik Tok I\ndon't\nknow but I think so here's the the\ngeneral principle is true if you take\nsomeone who's woefully insecure and you\nare really really nice to them and\nvalidate them a lot they may really\nappreciate that and then if you start\nbeing mean to them they\nmay dislike you and try to get that\nvalidation back which is sort of true\nand I think the person mentioned\ninsecure attachment which is what this\nsort of sounds like but I don't think\nthis is going to work on anyone so so\nlike let's just think through this\ncritically for a second\nokay if someone walks up to you and\nstarts just saying all these wonderful\nnice things about you and then they\nstart calling you names a little while\nafterward like what are you going to do\nare you going to try to get into their\ngood graces again if you're like me\nyou're going to be like first of all\nwhen someone comes into you like oh my\nGod you're such an amazing person oh my\nGod that's so awesome you're so handsome\nand beautiful and intelligent and all\nthat kind of stuff my first thought is\nwhat are you trying to sell\nme you know like\nso I think this works if someone here's\nhere's the biggest problem with I think\na lot of this psychology stuff is that\nthere's an assumption that people are\nmonolithic psychologically like that\nwe're like it's like we're not like\nmotherboards where you can just plug\nsomething in and it has a particular\neffect like yeah if you have someone\nwho's very insecure and you start\nvalidating them they will like that and\nthen if you're mean to them they will\ndislike it and they may try to get into\nyour good graces but that starts with a\nvery particular kind of\nperson so I I I don't know that sure\nit's manipulative and I think people do\nthat right so this is what people will\nlearn these patterns they'll learn like\nespecially if you've grown up in an\nabusive relationship if this was done to\nyou you learn how to do it to other\npeople which is like I'm going to be hot\nwarm and cold and then what happens when\nyou do that because there is value to\nthat it it sort of teaches people that\nit's almost like a random reinforcement\nschedule and so if you create a random\nreinforcement schedule it encourages\nBehavior so if you're like nice to\npeople one day and mean to people\nanother day that can actually encourage\nthem that shapes their behavior more\npowerfully than if you're nice to them\nyou know every single day in a weird way\nthere's a certain arbitrariness that can\nencourage a particular kind of\nbehavior the problem is that this only\nworks on people who like lack some\nfundamental amount of security in\nthemselves because if people are like\nfundamentally secure they're going to be\nlike what the [ __ ] is wrong with you\nlike this person's crazy you know I\ndon't understand what's going\non and it's like a gambling Machine\nWorks excellent so I think it can work\nbut it's just it's not going to work on\nanyone it's just going to work on people\nwho are insecure and you know that it's\njust weird I I don't\nknow yeah so like workaholic parents is\nlike another good example of just people\nthat you know you they'll they'll treat\ntheir kids really nice one day won't\ntreat them well the next day like\nsometimes you get and Daddy's attention\nand sometimes you don't get mommy and\ndaddy's attention which can really\nexacerbate certain kinds of acting out\nbehaviors and I I also don't know I mean\nthis person says fall in love with you I\ndon't think that they're falling in love\nwith you I think they're you're\nemotionally manipulating them sure but I\ndon't know what is going to happen and\nlike they kind of said this is kind of\naccurate that it's like it's an\nunhealthy kind of love because it's not\nlove it's it's some weird I I don't\nthink that you want to be in that\nsituation of of yeah it just doesn't cuz\nif if you want any kind of real\nrelationship with this person like\nwhat's the foundation of your\nrelationship I don't think it's going to\ngrow into anything it's just going to be\ntoxic you know I mean I do think that\nit's it's the general principle of um\nvalidating people who are insecure to\nget them to like you is\nlike\ncorrect I don't know that they're going\nto like you I mean hopefully they'll\nappreciate you as a human being and then\nI don't\nyeah yeah it's it's founded on on their\nown emotional security so there's like\nit's sort of like saying if you want to\nget if you want to get someone who's\nstarving to like you start feeding them\nand then stop feeding them and then\nthey'll do whatever they can to get you\nto feed them again it's like yeah that's\nkind of correct but that assumes that\nthe person is starving to begin with and\nhas no other place to get food right\nit's like if you're the only source of\nemotional validation from someone who's\ninsecure then they can become dependent\non on\nyou it's not wrong it's just I don't\nknow what the utility of it is"
