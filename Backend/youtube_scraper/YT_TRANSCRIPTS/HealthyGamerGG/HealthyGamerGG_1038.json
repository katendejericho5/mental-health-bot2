    "transcript": "the first thing that we're going to talk\nabout today is fat\nand\nmainly\nthe role of fat within the body and in\norder to talk about this we're going to\nhave to embark on a couple of like basic\nphysiologic\nkind of things okay so we're going to\nexplain a couple of\nsystems and basic physiologic concepts\nwith the body so the reason that i\npersonally got interested in this is\nbecause\na lot of times when it comes to helping\npeople like even when i think about my\npatients i've been astonished by how\nmuch exercise or weight loss\ncan help improve people's mood and like\noverall well-being so we know that the\nbody and mind are like very very closely\nconnected right so there's a mind-body\nconnection\nthe interesting thing that i'm excited\nabout more recently is that this\nmind-body connection has been\nhistorically sort of like propagated by\npeople like\npeople who are into yoga or tai chi\nor you know meditation and that's\ntotally fine there's nothing wrong with\nany of those things we're big believers\nin the value of yoga tai chi meditation\nbecause there's been science about that\nand that's that's what actually gets me\npretty excited is that there have been\nlots of clinical trials now on on yoga\nfor example\num to re\nuh reduce the effects of osteoarthritis\nor rheumatoid arthritis um tai chi and\nosteoarthritis there are a lot of\ninflammatory conditions that can get\npositively affected by these sorts of\nthings as well as like mental health\nconditions so we know that for example\nlike doing yoga and meditation and stuff\nlike that can have positive effects on\nmood\nand even clinically reduced symptoms of\nthings like generalized anxiety disorder\nmajor depressive disorder\nso we know that there's a mind-body\nconnection\nso\nnow what i'm super excited about is like\nas science progresses what we're sort of\ndiscovering is like what is specifically\nthe nature of the mind-body connection\nso what is happening in our body and\nwhat are like the chemical compounds\nhormones paracrine autocrine factors so\nthose are different things in the\nhormonal system which we'll explain in a\nsecond\nthat sort of relate to and affect our\nmind and other parts of our physiology\nand one of the biggest discoveries over\nthe last i want to say decade but maybe\neven closer to 15 years because remember\nall science moves slow right so this\nhasn't really even in a sense hit the\nmainstream yet even though there's been\nlike 10 or 15 years of research on it\num\nis that\nfat is not energy storage\nso there's been a perception that we\nhave these things called adipocytes\nand that adipocytes are fat storage\ncells\nand we've sort of believed that\nbasically as you you know eat for\nexample more carbohydrates so\ncarbohydrates really stimulate\nadipocytes\num and as our fat cells is we make more\nfat cells and our as our fat cells grow\nand fill up with fat\nwe've sort of assumed physio\nphysiologically that like that that's\nwhat they are it's just like your fat is\njust kind of sitting there right so your\nyour belly fat other parts of your fat\nare just like they're just storage\nand so as we exercise more as we eat\nhealthier as we start to enter a\nnegative caloric state that like we\nstart to burn more calories than we use\nand so that's then we get rid of the fat\nso it's just storage it's kind of we're\nfilling up our vaults with fat and\nenergy and as we start you know stop\nmaking deposits and start making\nwithdrawals we like burn out that fat\nbut the really interesting thing\nrecently is that\nadipocytes are actually very\nendocrinologically active\nand what does that mean\nso\nin terms of our body we have something\ncalled the endocrine system\nso the endocrine system\nis the system of hormones generally\nspeaking\nand what is a hormone so a hormone is a\nchemical compound\nthat travels through the bloodstream\nand affects distant organs\nright so if we think about our adrenal\nglands which are sort of situated like\nright here like kind of in the back they\nsit above our kidneys our adrenal glands\nwill secrete adrenaline right so if we\nget like\nsome kind of let's say there's a\nuh we're driving down the street and\nsomeone like swerves in front of us\nwe'll get a burst of adrenaline so\nthat's a chemical compound that's\nreleased from here travels through our\nbloodstream and starts to have all kinds\nof different effects so i think of\nhormones is essentially like body wide\nsignals it's almost like stances\nin like gaming so there's like tank\nstance there's dps stance there's going\ninto stealth so it's sort of like a\nkind of a body wide\nlike let's get all of our organ systems\nin line let's get our skeletal muscle\nour heart rate our digestive system our\nbrain all kind of focused in the same\ndirection\nso a good example of this is that\nadrenaline will increase our heart rate\nwill increase our blood pressure will\nreduce blood flow to our digestive\nsystem because when adrenaline is active\nwe don't need to be metabolizing\nnutrients like we're not worried about\nlike digesting things and you know\nstoring things away for later we're\nworried about survival so it'll\nconstrict blood vessels to our stomach\nand our intestines and our colon and\nit'll dilate blood vessels to our\nskeletal muscles to our arms and legs so\nwhat we're basically doing is rerouting\nblood blood flow from our gi system to\nour\nmuscles\nother examples of adrenaline they also\naffect your brain so when adrenaline is\nin the brain we start to make we start\nto see the world as more black and white\nand we start to see like more danger in\nthings\nand we tend to start to make like very\nvery like rapid decisions right because\nwhen we're if we're being attacked by a\ntiger for example like we don't want to\nsit there and like think philosophically\nabout whether you know whether the tiger\nis friendly or hungry or what like we we\nneed to act\nso hormones act body wide so the\ninteresting thing here is that they're\nlike we understand a lot of you know\nhormonal actions and stuff there's\nthyroid hormone adrenaline\ninsulin glucagon all that kind of good\nstuff we understand how these things\nwork but one of the most interesting\nrecent discoveries and once again recent\nis like 10 to 15 years is that\nadipocytes are endocrinologically active\nand so what that means is they secrete\nall kinds of stuff\nthat has different kinds of effects on\ndifferent parts of our body so rather\nthan being like inert what this sort of\nmeans is that a lot of what people may\nexperience if they are overweight or\nthey do have central adiposity so\nthere's even data that shows that\ncentral adiposity\nis worse\nthan peripheral\nadiposity\nand what does this mean\nso basically like when the majority of\nyour fat or if you have more fat that's\naround your belly\nthat tissue seems to act differently not\nall adipocytes are the same then fat\nthat let's let's say is around your\nthighs or your arms or your back or\nwhatever so it's kind of interesting\nbecause not all adipocytes because\nremember that fat is sort of distributed\nthroughout your body like we'll have\nsort of belly fat we'll have visceral\nfat which is the fat that surrounds our\norgans we'll have peripheral fat we'll\nhave some fat like around our thighs and\nthings like that and it seems that\ncentral adiposity is like worse for\nhealth outcomes than peripheral\nadiposity so i'm a little bit rusty on\nthis stuff but for example i think\ncentral adiposity has worse\ncardiovascular outcomes\nso if you have this you know two people\nwith the same grams of fat on their body\nthe person who has all of their fat sort\nof located around their belly region is\nmore likely to have worse cardiovascular\noutcomes which includes things like\nheart attacks\nthan people who have fat that's like\nevenly distributed through their body\nand so that sort of suggests that not\nall adipocytes are the same which in\nturn sort of\nuh and as people started to explore that\nwhat they sort of discovered is that\nadipocytes are endocrinologically active\nso let's take a quick look at some of\nthe measures of what fat actually does\nokay so i'm gonna go to a quick review\narticle\nbut this is um\nwhite fat so if we look uh let me see if\nthere's a better diagram here yeah here\nwe go this is gonna be easier to\nunderstand\nso this is if we look at white fat so\nwhat people have sort of discovered is\nthat there is there are all kinds of\neffects from white fat so we're going to\nkind of zero in on a couple so the first\nthat we're going to talk about is\nappetite regulation and nutritional\nintake\nso what this sort of means is that the\namount of fat you have will actually\naffect things like how hungry you feel\nokay\nthe second thing that we're going to\ntalk a little bit about is insulin\nso glucose and lipid metabolism this is\nreally really important\num so for example like diabetes so one\nof the the things that has been shown to\nclinically improve diabetes and insulin\nresistance and healthier\nblood sugar metabolism is actually\nlosing weight so this is another example\nof something that's kind of like not\nreally a clinical treatment right so\nexercise is not a clinical treatment\nlike it's not a medicine that's\nprescribed but is part of something that\nyou can do to clinically improve a\nillness\nso glucose and lipid metabolism are\naffected body weight homeostasis is\naffected by the amount of fat you have\nbut there's also all kinds of stuff that\nwe didn't sort of realize one is\nvascular tone control this means blood\npressure\num it affects our coagulation cascade\nand uh fibrino lysis\nso what this sort of means is like\nclotting so the the risk factors of\nstroke\nor developing a deep vein thrombosis\num having things like a pulmonary\nembolism like these are all things where\ncoagulation sort of affects our ability\nto for example coagulate if we get a cut\nbut it also does things like if if we're\ntoo pro\ncoagulant what that means is that we can\ndevelop a blockage within our blood\nblood vessels and a stroke is\nessentially like let me just explain\nthis so why is coagulation important\nso if you're in a pro coagulatory state\ni've got a blood vessel that's going to\nmy brain\nand if my coagulation proteins are all\nmessed up what they're going to do is\nthey're going to coagulate\nand they're gonna stop blood flow\nand then once i stop blood flow what\nthis means is that like the brain over\nhere is like not receiving blood and\nthen i end up with something called an\nischemic stroke\nokay so remember that coagulation\nproteins are there to stop blood flow so\nif i get a cut on my arm it starts to\nbleed and then my coagulation proteins\nlike show up and then they'll like block\nthe the cut and then they'll you know\nthen you'll scab over and then you get\nthat little like blood scab right which\nis hard in his blood and it's not really\nskin you can pick it off and it'll start\nbleeding again so that's the coagulation\nprocess the really interesting thing\nhere is that it seems like coagulation\nbalance is actually affected by like the\namount of fat that you have\nother really important things are just\nin general immunity um angiogenesis\nreproduction so what this sort of means\nis that so for example we also know that\nsometimes if people have difficulty\ngetting pregnant\nthat um\naffecting\ntheir body weight can actually like\nincrease their chances of pregnancy and\nthere are even some medications that you\ncan take if you are overweight and\ntrying to get pregnant that will help\nyou sort of get pregnant and some of\nthose medications will do things like\nglu affect glucose and lipid metabolism\nare also used as treatments for diabetes\nso the key thing here is that fat\naffects like all kinds of different\nthings in your body and the reason that\ni think this is important for like our\ncommunity is because\ni've sort of seen this as a mental\nhealth professional where like sometimes\nfixing a clinical issue\nor improving a clinical issue can\ninvolve like non-clinical things so\nthere are you know all kinds of patients\nthat i've worked with who will start\nexercising for example and what we see\nis that like their their experience of\nof a depressive episode gets like\nsubstantially better and so we know some\nof these mechanisms pretty well so for\nexample like we know that sunlight has a\nprotective mechanism against depression\num and part of part of the reason for\nthat is because vitamin d deficiency is\na risk factor for major depressive\ndisorder so when when i see a patient\noftentimes what i'll do is i'll order a\nvitamin d test and if their level is low\nthen what we'll do is supplement vitamin\nd or i'll tell them to get into the sun\nmore and it's really interesting because\nit seems to help\nthere's data that shows that vitamin d\nsupplementation can actually improve\nclinical depression\nso the point about fat is that like this\nis the kind of thing where if you start\nexercising and you reduce your your\nthe amount of white fat that you have\nthat you may have benefits in all kinds\nof different parts of your life that\nyou're not really aware of right it\ncould help you potentially get pregnant\nit could help you with appetite\nregulation it could help you with\nautoimmune diseases so we're not really\nsure there's like different clinical\ntrials depending on what you're talking\nto and that's why you should absolutely\nlike if you're concerned about this and\nyou do have a medical condition bring it\nup with your doctor and sort of get\ntheir guidance\nso let's dive into what some of these\nthings are and why i think they're\nimportant\nokay so the first thing is nutritional\nintake\nthere are two things that we're going to\ntalk about two things that two hormones\nor chemical signals that adipocytes\nproduce the first is leptin\nso this gives us a sense of satiety\nso we tend to have two\nhormones that will\nmake us feel hungry or make us feel full\nthe really interesting thing is that\ngenerally speaking leptin is what makes\nus feel full and ghrelin is what makes\nus feel hungry but it appears that\nsomething happens when you have sort of\ndysregulated adipocyte metabolism\nthat causes leptin to be released and\ncan sometimes have paradoxical effects\nso something about the amount of fat\nthat you have and we'll kind of get into\nother mechanisms seems to affect how\nhungry you feel\nand if the body was simple\nit would be as simple as oh leptin makes\nyou feel full fat produces leptin\ntherefore fat should make you feel full\nbut the body is complicated right we\nhave dozens and dozens or hundreds of\nsignals\nhaving different effects on different\norgans and what we sort of find is that\nleptin metabolism seems to be messed up\nand can actually like affect people's\nsense of satiety and how hungry they\nfeel what precise effect does it have we\nactually don't know because it's\ncomplicated and we haven't entirely\nfigured it out yet\nthe second uh\nhormone i want to talk about is\nangiotensin\nso angiotensin also affects um\n[Music]\nessentially like our salt intake so it's\na hormone that will really really affect\nhow much you crave salt angiotensin is\nalso\nvery important for blood pressure\nbecause our blood pressure is maintained\nheavily by our you know the sodium\nconcentration of our blood and so for\nexample if someone has high blood\npressure we'll give them a medication or\nwe can give them a medication called an\narb which is an angiotensin receptor\nblocker so what happens is when you\nblock the action of angiotensin it\nreduces your blood pressure\nso the other thing here that's important\nis that it affects um\nsalt intake\nright and also like we know that for\nexample reducing weight can have\nbeneficial effects on blood pressure\nblood pressure uh being having high\nblood pressure is one of the\nslowest and most dangerous diseases you\ncan have\npart of the reason it's so dangerous is\nbecause\nyou'll never feel it so our body is very\nvery good at if we have a blood pressure\nof 120 over 80 we'll feel potentially\nexactly the same as if we're 160 over\n100. the problem is if you sit at 160\nover 100 for many many many years it can\ndo a lot of damage to your your\ndifferent organs like kidneys\nbrain\netc\nand since our body is so good at\nadapting to blood pressure you won't\nsort of feel it so one of the trickiest\nthings about being a doctor is getting\nlike patients to take their blood\npressure medication because if they skip\nfive days they don't feel a difference\nbut if they do take it they'll sort of\nexperience potentially side effects so\nsometimes it can be really hard for\npatients to like take blood pressure\nmedication because you don't see a\nbenefit right it's not like taking um\nlike an anti-inflammatory or antipyretic\nmedication like ibuprofen or\nacetaminophen when you have a fever it's\nlike you feel instantly better it's not\nlike taking anti-nausea medication it's\nlike you you know you don't feel it\nkey thing here is that it seems like uh\nfat cells will actually secrete leptin\nand angiotensin so we're sort of\ndiscovering is that like fat cells\nwill are endocrinologically active and\nwill affect like blood pressure in your\nkidneys\nso the next thing that we're going to\ntalk a little bit about is insulin\nsensitivity\nso just to give you all a little bit of\nbackground\nwhen we have blood when we eat a candy\nbar and we have\nglucose in our bloodstream\nthis travels to our pancreas\nour pancreas detects it\nand secretes insulin\nspecifically from the beta cells\nof the pancreas\ninsulin then goes to different cells\nand tells them hey we've got a bunch of\nsugar in our blood\ntake those take that sugar in and stick\nit in your cell\nand so then that ends up reducing the\nconcentration of sugar in our blood so\nthis is basically how our body signals\ninsulin is the signal to our body that\nwe just ate a meal so what happens when\nwe eat a meal we digest it in our\nstomach we absorb it in our intestines\nit gets absorbed into our bloodstream\ninsulin gets triggered and then all of\nthat nutrients all those nutrients will\nget absorbed by our cells so they get\ntaken up by our brain they get taken up\nby\nliver they get taken up by skeletal\nmuscle and they get taken up by\nadipocytes\nso one of the things that we've sort of\ndiscovered is that adipocytes\nlead to insulin resistance\nand what does that mean what does that\ndo so this sort of makes sense\nphysiologically right if you want to\nthink about this from a bird's eye view\nremember everything that we're talking\nabout is somewhat of an\noversimplification\nbut\nthe more fat storage you have the less\nlikely to make fat because this is what\nhappens over here you you need to be so\nour body has something called a a\nweight set point so a set point for how\nmuch we want to weigh and it's kind of\ntightly regulated around that set point\nand so this is the kind of thing where\nlike if we have a bunch of fat like it's\nsort of telling our body hey we don't\nneed to store more fat that's sort of\nlike the general like physiologic logic\nbehind it physiologic logic you guys\nlike that\nso the tricky thing here is that even\nthough adipocytes cause insulin\nresistance like isn't that a good thing\nwell not really because when we have a\nbunch of blood sugar floating around in\nour bloodstream\nand it doesn't get absorbed\nthis is how we end up with\ndiabetes and the reason that diabetes is\nbad is because it turns out that having\nhigh concentrations of blood sugar in\nyour bloodstream is damaging to your\ncells\nso for example\nwhen we have high blood sugar\nfor prolonged periods of time we're\ntalking like years or decades right for\nlike 10 years\nwhat that does is cause peripheral\nnerve damage\nfor example\nworsens\ncardiovascular outcomes\nokay\nso what this sort of means is that our\nbloodstream is not designed to have a\nbunch of blood sugar there\nand so like it's supposed to like blood\nsugar is supposed to be like relatively\ntransient and or it keeps at a certain\nlevel so it's tightly regulated if it's\nway higher than that it starts to cause\nlike damage to our cells you can sort of\nthink of it like a sewer pipe that gets\nclogged with stuff right like this the\nsewer pipe is supposed to be like\nfree-flowing and it's supposed to\ntransport stuff right like we want it to\nbe like moving particular things and\nmove from point a to point b but we\ndon't want to like clog up our sewer\npipe even with the stuff that it's\nsupposed to carry\nand that can lead to bad outcomes so the\nother thing about adipocytes is that\nthey tend to lead to insulin resistance\nworsen our blood sugar and can\ncontribute to things like diabetes these\nfunctions are basically like people sort\nof get right we know that fat has\nsomething to do with nutritional intake\ninsulin sensitivity metabolism etc\nso this is what gets to be really really\ninteresting\ninflammatory markers\nso fat appears to be\na pro in i shouldn't say pro\nhigh levels of fat can lead to a pro\ninflammatory state so two markers we're\ngoing to talk about tnf alpha and\ninterleukin 6. so tnf alpha and\ninterleukin-6 are two cytokines so these\nare like\nuh\nimmunological signals so in our\nbloodstream we have like white blood\ncells\nokay we also have things like\nmacrophages which eat other cells i mean\nthey they eat things like bacteria and\nthey're flowing around in our\nbloodstream when we have\nhigh levels of tnf alpha and\ninterleukin-6 both of these guys go into\nhigh alert so like oh this means that\nthere's like let's let's attack\nsomething it's like go time and what\nhappens when we enter a high\ninflammatory state which can be healthy\nright there's a reason why we create\ninflammation inflammation can be part of\nthe process of healing can also be part\nof the process that we use to fight an\ninfection so when you get like let's say\ni get a cut that gets infected it gets\nwarm and and\ninflamed and hurts and why is that it's\nbecause there's vasodilation so our\ncapillaries are kind of like leaking\nstuff and what they're leaking is is\nlike white blood cells so they're\nleaking like immune system stuff and\nthen all of our white blood cells are\ngoing to the site of battle in\nconducting a war against the bacteria\nthat are that are building there so that\ninflammation can be a healthy part of\nour body\nthe challenge is that when we have a\nbunch of uh adipocytes that are kind of\nlike not regulated properly they can\nincrease the level of tnf alpha in\ninterleukin-6\nand this in turn will lead to\npro-inflammatory states\nand the problem with pro-inflammatory\nstates is that a lot of the the\nproblems that we face medically are like\ndiseases of inflammation so there are\neven inflammatory hypotheses for\nclinical depression those seem to be\nlike\nnot great to be honest so people have\neven done clinical trials where can you\ntr treat a depressive episode with\nanti-inflammatory agents and the answer\nis like it doesn't seem like there's\ngreat evidence for that but we do know\nthat there's low levels of inflammation\nin the brain when people are clinically\ndepressed\nso you know question mark for clinical\ndepression\nbut then there are all kinds of other\ndiseases that people suffer from right\nso like\narthritis\neczema\nibs which is inflammatory bowel syndrome\num all sorts of autoimmune diseases so\nlike things like lupus\nright so if you all watch house like the\nlupus is always on the differential so\nall kinds of conditions like psoriasis\nis another one so like skin conditions\nlike different kinds of inflammation\nlike gastric inflammation gastritis like\nall this stuff gets worse by like\nyou know all these pro-inflammatory\ncytokines\nand remember that like the\npro-inflammatory cytokines aren't by\nthemselves bad right it's just that our\nbody wants them to be active at a\nparticular time and wants them to be\nlike not active at other times\na couple of other things to remember is\nthat i think\nalpha and il-6\nare the\nstrongest\npredictors\nin terms of cytokines that is\nof covid mortality\nright so this is just like a simple\nexample\nof how we've looked at okay if people\nare more likely to die of covid what's\ngoing on in their immune system and it\nseems like they're dumping high levels\nof tnf alpha and il-6\nthe other reason that this is important\nis not just because of\nautoimmune stuff\nbut il-6 has been linked to aging so\nthis is another example of like data\nthat is very preliminary so we don't\nknow necessarily that like aisle 6 makes\nyou older\nbut if we look at the processes of\ncellular aging\nand we look at the effects of il-6\non those processes what we find is that\nthey tend to accelerate those processes\nso there may be some links that having\nand there's also some you know\nepidemiological evidence that for\nexample like having a low inflammatory\nstate leads to longer lifespan so this\nis one of those situations where you\nhave to be really careful about\nconnecting the dots\nthis does not necessarily mean that\nhaving a bunch of adipocytes will mean\nyou age faster right so i don't want you\nall to draw that conclusion this is how\nscience works where like what some like\nyou know we know this piece which is\nthat aisle six\naccelerates\num\nyou know certain cellular processes\nlet's just call this process a\nthe other thing that we know is we'll\nlook at aging and what we find is oh\naging also seems to be mediated by\nprocess a\nso what this sort of what some people\nwill want to do is they'll say oh that\nmeans that aisle six definitively causes\nyou to get older faster which i don't\nthink is fair to say we haven't really\nlinked those but it seems that i mean we\nhaven't sort of made that conclusion but\nit does seem that there's some linkage\nanother good example of this is that you\nknow we look at cancer which essentially\nages our cells very rapidly and il-6 is\nsort of correlated with that rapid aging\nwithin cancer also our immune system is\nall over the place when we have cancer\nso this is where once again like just to\nbe aware that there's all kinds of\neffects that adipocytes could be having\non your body including potentially\naccelerating the aging process which is\nactually like kind of scary right that's\nwhy we're sort of sharing it with you\nokay\nso there are a couple of other things\nthat we've sort of already talked about\nbut i'll just kind of mention so pai-1\nis a plasminogen activating something\nso this is like the\nclotting stuff\nfibrinolysis\nso\nfibrin is essentially something that can\nform like a a clot and so what we want\nto do is break down the clot right so\nover time what we we don't want to we\ndon't have a clot forever so when i get\na cut i want it to clot over\nand then i want to build skin underneath\nand then we want to break down\nessentially like the dam which is what a\nfibrin clot is it's a dam that prevents\nflow\nand then like then we want to break it\ndown because we want flow to go back\nthere right so on my hand eventually i\nwant blood flow to be back there\nso the key thing here is that it's just\nanother example of um you know a\nchemical signal that's released by\nadipocytes\nso we'll kind of review those that sort\nof affects this kind of stuff so if we\nlook at here's an example of all of the\nactual compounds we didn't go into all\nof them\nthat are released by adipocytes and will\nsort of affect different organ systems\nthe last thing is that it does seem to\naffect steroid metabolism so like we\nmentioned already like even things like\nlibido\num\nor\nthe ability to get pregnant may be\nrelated to the level of adipocytes you\nhave in your body so we can see that it\naffects uh sex steroids glucocorticoids\nor things like stress hormones so\nglucocorticoids like cortisol is like\nthe primary glucose glucocortis\ncorticoid so when we are in a high\nstress state it does all kinds of stuff\nright it messes with our mental it\nmesses with our physical it can mess\nwith our stomach um affects like muscle\ndevelopment affects our rest all of\nthose kinds of things so glucocorticoids\nwill sometimes activate the reticular\nactivating formation which is a part of\nour brain that causes us to sleep\nlightly so when we're in a high stress\nstate we don't get as restful sleep\nwhich is originally designed to be an\nadaptive mechanism because if we think\nabout the way that we used to experience\nstress if i see a tiger footprint\nlike when i go to bed that night i want\nto be a light sleeper because there's a\ntiger in the neighborhood our body was\nnot really designed to experience\nlong-term stress so if we think about\nthe way that monkeys get stressed out\nthey don't worry about like paying rent\nat the end of the month right so they\ndon't experience 29 days of constant\nstress about things at the end of the\nmonth\nas our society has changed\nas we worry about things like how am i\ngoing to pay for this or how am i going\nto pay rent or will i be alone forever\nor i didn't get any tinder matches today\nit boosts our stress hormones and then\nthat sort of like wreaks havoc on all\nkinds of different parts of our body\nincluding our ability to sleep\nso we talked we're not going to go into\nall of these but um you know we talked\nabout il-6 and tnf-alpha which are\ninflammatory markers and we talked a\nlittle bit about leptin\nwe talked about angiotensin these are\nthe clotting factors\nso this once again is just kind of like\na i thought it was really interesting\nbecause like it turns out that fat\nactually has a very profound effect on\nall kinds of our different\nsystems\nand sometimes it's really really\nsurprising because when i've worked with\npatients in the past who will have\nsomething like ibs\nyou know it's really interesting what\nkinds of lifestyle changes can have a\nclinical impact\nso this is also where if you all have\nany of these conditions or you're\nconcerned about this stuff you should\nabsolutely go talk to your doctor about\nit right say you know hey i have ibs\nlike are there any recommendations that\nyou have for like reducing my body's\nlike inflammatory state and see what\nyour doctor says i think it's a very\nvery good question to ask your doctor\num\nso let me just see if there's anything\nelse in this yeah so this just kind of\ngoes goes uh into\nmore detail\nso um\njust to kind of summarize we're going to\ntalk a little bit more but the\nyou know it turns out that adipose\ntissue is not just fat storage but is\nactually a complicated endocrine organ\nthe next thing that i want to talk a\nlittle bit about is when people sort of\ndiscover this what they tend to do\nis\ntalk a lot about different kinds of like\nherbs and supplements or food\ningredients\nthat will change white fat into brown\nfat so just this is where\nlet's take a step back so we have two\nkinds of fat we have white fat\nand we have\nbrown fat\nokay\nand the difference is that white fat we\nused to think of as storage\nand brown fat is used for thermogenesis\nso human beings have a very small level\nof brown fat whereas bears who hibernate\nin the winter will have high levels of\nbrown fat\nand so what what happens is like\nthermogenesis essentially maintains body\ntemperature is there a couple of other\ninteresting things people in northern\nclimates\ngenerally speaking have higher levels of\nbrown fat\npeople with high levels of thyroid\nhormone\nalso have high levels of brown fat or\nsorry not tsh\nt3 t4\nvery important distinction\nokay\nand this may be meat like this these two\ncould be related right so as it gets\ncolder maybe our thyroid hormone goes up\nand we stimulate thermogenesis the key\nthing about\nbrown fat is that it actually burns\ncalories so the more brown fat we have\nlike the more calories we burn at like\nbasal metabolic level this is without\nactivity so this is like the amount like\nyou know we maintain a temperature of\n98.6 how do we maintain that temperature\nall the time by burning energy right\nwhat what's the cell that burns energy\nit can be brown fat\nso\nwhat a lot of people will do is as\npeople sort of discover oh fat is an\nendocrine organ like what are all of the\nthings that reduce brown fat and this is\nwhere i think you'll need to be extra\ncareful about like media because\noftentimes what we'll see is like a an\narticle that sort of says oh there's a\nnew study that found that green tea\nreduces\nlike\nincreases fat burning which could be\ntrue\nbut i think as we're going to look at\nthis next paper i'm going to invite you\nall to be a little bit careful about\nthat kind of stuff because oftentimes\nthe media articles won't go into the\ndetail of what kind of study was done\nand like specifically what they found\nthis is also where if you all are\nthinking about starting something like a\nsupplement or whatever like absolutely\ngo talk to your doctor about it it's\ntotally fine to you know talk to them\nbecause there may be more to the issue\nthan you realize the other thing to\nremember there's a lot of detail about\nthis in dr k's guide to mental health\nso we have a video about the safety of\nusing herbal supplements which i highly\nhighly recommend you all check out\ngoes into a lot of detail about how you\ncan get liver toxicity and just how to\napproach supplements and some of the\ncautions around like supplements which\nare tend to be pretty unregulated\ndoesn't mean that they can't help there\nare a lot of clinical trials which we'll\nkind of talk about that have shown that\nherbs and supplements and things like\nthat can have positive impacts for\nhealth but you have to be there are a\nlot of cautionary things to to be\nconcerned about okay\nso what we're gonna do\nis talk take a look at a couple of\ndifferent\nherbs or chemical compounds like food\ncompounds\nthat will sometimes get advertised as\nconverting white fat to brown fat right\nand the reason we're sharing this is\nbecause a lot of people like watching\nthis they're like oh okay so i need to\nreduce my amount of white fat how do i\ndo that well if you if you do a google\nsearch for reducing white fat what you\nmay find is like articles\nright from like health line or webmd\nabout here are five things that you can\ntake that have been shown to reduce\nwhite fat or to convert white fat to\nbrown fat so let's take a look\nokay\nso the first thing that we're going to\ntalk about is capsaicin or capsaid so\nthese are essentially like the spicy\ningredient from peppers\nand capsaicin is a a good example of\nactually like a pretty well studied\nthing and i'm going to tunnel down into\nthis\nso here's one study so snitker\npublished a paper in 2009 where oral\ntreatment with capsinoids\nin overweight or obese subjects was\nassociated with abdominal fat loss and\nincrease in fat oxidation compared with\nthe placebo group so this was a study\nthat had a sample size of 80 people but\nthere are a couple of important things\nabout it so it's double blind\nplacebo controlled has a sample size of\n80 and is in humans okay so this i think\nlike there's decent evidence that\ncapsaicin actually does like\nreduce the amount of white fat you have\nand may stimulate brown fat okay there\nare a lot of other studies that they\nsort of talk about but we're going to\ncompare this with a couple of other\nstudies\nso here's a compound that people loved\ntalking about recently not recently like\nmaybe 20 years ago resveratrol so\nresveratrol is a compound that's it's a\nnatural polyphenol\nthat has been found in red wine and\ngrapes peanuts\nwhy is that moving\ngrapes peanuts etc so the key thing\nabout resveratrol is that like people\nstarted talking about the health\nbenefits of wine with resveratrol and\nwhat they were sort of doing is citing\nstudies and then people were sort of\nsaying like drinking a glass of red wine\nis like good for your heart and so a lot\nof people who really enjoyed red wine\nwho had been told for their entire lives\nthat like hey maybe you're drinking a\nlittle bit too much maybe you should cut\nback wine is expensive alcohol is bad\nfor you they're like c c like\nresveratrol is good\nso here's another example of like you'll\nsee articles about this where people\nwill say like oh resveratrol has\nactually been shown to like reduce white\nfat but let's take a closer look at the\nactual studies okay\nso the administration of resveratrol\nin mice\nfed with a high fat diet\nhas been shown to reduce the visceral\nfat pads and suppress adipogenesis\nokay so like\nthis is very different from the snitker\npaper\nbecause the snicker paper is actually\ngiving human beings like capsaids and\nmeasuring what happens\nwhereas like what what's this is this is\nlike giving mice 400 milligrams per kg\nper day for 10 weeks like i have no idea\nlike look at the i mean this this may\nnot be a one-to-one fair comparison\nbecause maybe resveratrol is like\nless concentrated than capsaicin right\nbecause you need just a little bit of\npepper but generally speaking with my\nstudies sometimes they'll give these\nmice like very very high dosages of\nstuff because they're trying to detect\nan effect right and it's kind of like\nmice so you're not worried about\ncompliance you're not worried about\nlike\nyou know like the mice is having side\neffects and things like that you'll just\ngive them a bunch of stuff\nso um\nthen you'll also have you know like gene\nstudies or like like uh cellular studies\nso these are studies that for example\nwill just take a cell culture\nand they'll measure like how does gene\nexpression change when i when i have a\nbunch of cells sitting in a petri dish\nand i squirt some resveratrol like what\ndo the cells start doing differently so\nthis also is like not even i mean\nthey're living cells but it's not even\nwithin a human organism i mean it's not\neven within a mice a mouse organism\nright\num\nso like the studies for resveratrol\ntend to be in mice\nso c is a feeding of my standard diet\nplus resveratrol induced expression of\ncert one and ucp genes so there could be\nsomething here and this is how science\nprogresses we start by studying things\nin mice and then we may move on to\nstudying things in primates and\neventually we'll move on to studying\nthings in humans\nbut you know this is where we have to be\nsuper super careful because like if\nthere's an article that says oh\nresveratrol did you know resveratrol or\ndrinking a glass of red wine can help\nyou lose weight and like that could be\ntrue but just be a little bit careful\nabout the level of of you know evidence\nthat people are talking about\num so curcumin is another really good\nexample so curcumin has gotten a lot of\nuh you know interest recently\nso um curcumin is the active ingredient\nin turmeric or one of the active\ningredients in turmeric has been used in\nindian and ayurvedic medicine for many\nmany many years\nand so what people will do is like\nthey'll say like oh did you know that\nusing turmeric can help you lose weight\nso\num\nso the turmeric is a good example does\nhave some human studies right so it\nlooks like in this study i think this is\na small population size recent clinical\ntrial assess the safety and efficacy of\n30-day treatment with cumin\ncombined with phosphatidylserine\nin overweight subjects undergoing weight\nloss by diet and lifestyle intervention\nin the study curcumin\nadministration increased weight loss\nenhanced fat mass loss and induced\nreduction in waste to hip circumference\nbut keep in mind this is the other thing\nthat you have to be careful about right\nbecause in this study they also\nadministered phosphatidylserine with it\nso what effect does that have does that\nmean that i can go to a health food\nstore\nbuy curcumin tablets and lose weight if\ni just take it right so the answer is we\ndon't know\nright because in this study like they\nadded this additional compound what is\nthe effect of that additional compound\nwe don't know\nthis is also where some of the study\ninvolves uh\nintra gastric administration of curcumin\num 50 milligrams to 100 milligrams per\nkg daily in mice right so the\nintragastric is really really important\nso that means they're not even feeding\nit they're like\nputting it directly into the gi system\nand this is important especially for\ncurcumin because there are some concerns\nabout\nuh absorption of curcumin through the gi\nsystem of especially humans so it's some\nof the doses that you may need\nto create this kind of\ndecreased fat pad or whatever\nhumans may not like actually absorb that\nlevel\nso the point here is that you know just\nbe careful because they're all kinds of\nlike caveats when it comes to things\nlike herbal medicine\ngreen tea is another thing that has been\ntouted for weight loss for a long time\nso be a little bit careful about that\ntoo\num\nyou know so we know that there are\nbeneficial compounds\nin tea like catechins\num\nso the other thing that we have to be\ncareful about in green tea is like how\nmuch of the benefits of green tea are\ndue to caffeine versus the catechins so\nwe know that caffeine has thermogenic\nproperties\num\nand so once again like we've got some\nrat studies here and we've got some\nhuman studies right so with regard to\nhuman studies demonstrated that green\ntea enhances\ni think ee what is that um enhanced\noxidation\ni think it it improves fatty acid\noxidation oh no fat oxidation let's\nremember blinking what he is\noh enhanced energy expenditure so what\nthis sort of refers to is our baseline\nlike energy expenditure\num\nyeah so like like green tea may have a\nbenefit\nso in terms of uh\nso this is good so the role of green tea\nin tackling obesity seem controversial\nin human trials\nso like you know there are all kinds of\nconfounding factors which sort of i\ndon't know that popular media will like\ngo into\nso the key takeaway here is that\noftentimes you know especially with\nthings on the frontier of medicine\nlike\num\nyou know\nadipose tissue is an endocrine organ it\ncan be like really really exciting and\nvery informational so do i advocate for\nhaving a healthy level like a healthy\nbody weight like absolutely\nis this you know just a disclaimer i'm\nnot commenting hopefully people are not\ninterpreting this as like\nhaving anything to do with body\npositivity i'm not saying this has\nanything to do with health i mean beauty\nstandards or anything like that i'm not\nsaying that we should you know lose\nweight for the sake of being more\nattractive or fulfilling a society body\nstandard societal body standard what\nwe're talking about today is the the\nliteral biochemical effects of adipose\ntissue\nand so whether you're overweight\nunderweight whatever like that that's\nnot sort of what we're talking about\nwe're sort of zeroing in on adipose\ntissue is a potential contributor to all\nkinds of physiologic problems and health\nbenefits the key takeaway here is that\nyou know if you are overweight or you do\nhave\na very central like fat deposition\nand you suffer from any of these issues\nthis is something that you should be\nthinking about and especially if you\nhave like a clinical diagnosis\nabsolutely something you should be\ntalking to your doctor about\nthe last thing to keep in mind is that\noftentimes on the frontier of medicine\nwhat people will do is like they'll\nthey'll make studies right so it's good\nthat people are studying this stuff oh\ngreen tea can help me lose weight green\ntea can promote thermogenesis green tea\ncan do all these kinds of things they'll\nmake all these kinds of claims and those\nclaims are scientifically valid but\nthey're not really like\nvalid at the level of like human trials\nright so this is where you all have to\nbe really careful about health related\ncompounds right i know that a lot of\npeople are very interested in\nneurotropics um so these are things that\nare sort of good for our brain\nbut just be a little bit careful because\noftentimes especially as we sort of you\nknow look at popular dissemination of\nscientific concepts\nthey're not really like digging down\ninto you know what is the dosage that\nwe're administering to mice\nare these human trials or mice trials\nwhat's the sample size for the human\ntrials in this case it's 80 if memory\nserves no i don't think it's listed here\nbut\num and so just be a little bit careful\nabout that stuff so i think you know\nsometimes uh i run across things that i\nthink are really really interesting this\nis something that i personally monitor\nvery very closely because i am really\ncurious about what we're gonna learn\nabout like\nthe endocrine impact\nof um\n[Music]\nfat\nand and potentially using like weight\nloss or reducing our central adiposity\nor even adjusting you know the the\ngenetic activation of particular fat\ncells so there's some studies that kind\nof go into that so if we look at like\nthese compounds right this is\nresveratrol is talking about altering\nthe genetic expression of fat cells\nand that will in turn\nadjust all kinds of things\nso keep this stuff in mind be a little\nbit careful you know be critical of\nstuff that you'll come across\nand if you all have an actual like\nhealth condition please go see a doctor\nabout it okay questions\nlooks like we have time for a couple\nother posts\nwhat did i have for breakfast this\nmorning\ni had half a banana a cup of tea and\nthen a bowl of oatmeal with blueberries\nis stress an inflammatory state\nabsolutely\nso stress\npsychological stress so we can talk\nabout this for a second\nthis is also i think there's a video\nthat goes into a lot of detail about\nthis in dr k's guide\nso when we have a physiologic\nstate of stress this causes the release\nof different compounds so let's talk\nabout glucocorticoids\nlike cortisol\nand cortisol does all kinds of things\nso i think let me just make sure i\nunderstood the\ncaught the question but okay whatever\nso when we go to cortisol\ncortisol will have all kinds of\ndifferent effects so it'll increase\nblood sugar\nit'll cause breakdown\nof fat and muscle\nwhy because we want\na lot of available energy\nright it'll also do things like activate\nour immune system\nand why is that\nwell let's think about it when do we\nwant cortisol active it's like when we\nsee a tiger in the wilderness right so\nwhat's likely to happen if we see a\ntiger in the wilderness maybe we'll get\nscratched maybe we'll get bitten\nall those you know the tigers fangs have\nall that juicy juicy bacteria which\nloves getting past your dermis and into\nyour bloodstream so we want our immune\nsystem on high alert\nright it'll also have uh\neffects on your brain right so it'll\nit'll\nmake you a light sleeper\nand this in turn will lead to less\nrestful sleep\nand so like cortisol will wreak havoc on\nyour body cortisol is a hormone that is\ndesigned\nto sacrifice long-term health for\nshort-term survival that's what our\nadrenaline system is there for\nright like we can break down fat and\nmuscle but we need that we need like as\nmuch sugar as we can get in our\nbloodstream so that our muscles when we\nstart to run and fight have an endless\nsupply of energy\nthe challenge is that when we're in this\nstate for a long period of time\nwe end up um actually like\nyou know because we're there's no\nshort-term\nthreat right we're not actually getting\nattacked by a tiger and so over over\ntime that long-term stress will actually\nnegatively affect us quite profoundly\nthere's another really interesting thing\nabout a cortisol tumor\nwhich is that one of the features of a\ncortisol tumor is something called a\nbuffalo hump\nso we develop fat pads\nwith cortisol tumors and why is that so\ngenerally speaking remember what we're\ntrying to do is we're taking muscle\nand\nfat and we're breaking them down\ninto blood sugar\nand back in the good old evolutionary\ndays\nwe would then use that blood sugar to\nrun\nor\nfight\nso what happens nowadays do we run or\nfight when we're stressed out when we\ndon't make rent when we're worried about\nmaking rent at the end of the month do\nare we running around and being very\nactive sometimes but usually not usually\nwe're just stressed and then the body\ngets confused so when we don't use it to\nrun or fight what happens\nblood sugar\nstarts insulin\nand then insulin forms\ncreates fat\nand so essentially what we're doing in\nhigh stress straight states is we're\nconverting muscle to fat\nso i'll just show you all a quick\npicture\nokay\nthis is where\nso this is where like\nthis is literally what happens you get a\nfat deposition\num\nand then let's look at cushingoid\nhabitus\nso this is what\nhappens\noh this is from facebook but whatever\ngood god\nso this is what a cushion going habitus\nlooks like so for someone who has high\nlevels of\nglucocorticoid hormones this is what\nhappens to them\noh can you all not see any of this\nokay gg let me switch over\nokay let's start from the top\nokay\ni'm going to show you all gg\nokay first thing\nhopefully i'll caught that but let's\nstart from the top so stress\ncauses the the release of\nglucocorticoids\ncortisol is one example cortisol\nincreases blood sugar\noh yeah there was absolutely a diagram\nwe'll go through it right now\nthis causes a\nbreakdown of fat and muscle\nin order to stimulate our blood sugar\nactivates our immune system makes us\nlight sleepers so we get less restful\nsleep\nand this this is why like stress is bad\nfor you physiologically right so over\ntime your blood sugar is going to be\nhigh your immune system is going to be\noverly active but there's no infection\nto fight\nthus we've got all these soldiers our\nwhite blood cells which with itchy\ntrigger fingers that are like in a high\nalert state and there's nothing to fight\nso what they end up doing is causing\nautoimmune problems\nso we know that stress worsens\nautoimmune disease\nalso causes us to be light sleepers\nwhich means we don't get deep restful\nsleep\nlast thing that we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about in terms of the\nmetabolism i think this is super\ninteresting so if you have a cortisol\ntumor or cushing's disease\nyou can get something called buffalo\nhump and what happens here remember that\nwhen we\ncreate cortisol what we're doing is\nwe're breaking down muscle and fat to\nstimulate blood sugar and once we have\nhigh levels of blood sugar\nwe normally want those so that we can\nrun or fight right so we want like as\nmuch energy available to our calves and\nour thighs and our arms as possible\nand generally speaking when we see a\ntiger let's say\n10 million years ago if we saw a tiger\nwhat we would do is like hike eight\nmiles right like we want to just get the\nhell away from the tiger so we need a\nlot of energy for our skeletal muscles\nbut nowadays when we get stressed we're\nnot running or fighting so then then we\nhave a bunch of blood sugar in our\nbloodstream and then like after a while\nthe cortisol starts to wear off\nand because there's a\nantagonistic relationship between\ncortisol and insulin in some ways\nand then we secrete insulin and what\ndoes insulin do\nstores all that blood sugar as fat so\nwhen we're in a stressed state we are\nliterally converting muscle into fat and\nwhat that results in\nis something called a cushingoid habitus\nokay so this is where\nlike this is literally what happens to\npeople's bodies you'll see wasting of\nthe arms and legs like muscles and\nyou'll see fat deposition\nso this is a buffalo hump\nokay\ngood question\nso we should exercise when stressed\nabsolutely\nyou should absolutely exercise when\nyou're stressed so there's something\nreally cool about exercise one key thing\nabout exercise which is why it's so good\nfor all this blood sugar stuff\nwhen you exercise\nyour muscles will absorb\nblood sugar without insulin\ni mean yeah without insulin right so\ngenerally speaking\nwhat that means is that you are getting\nyou're lowering your blood sugar without\ninsulin and so remember insulin is going\nto activate your body's physiology to\nstore\nthat sugar as fat\nand so when you exercise\nit makes so the insulin resistance that\nyou get with high levels of adiposity\nexercise counteracts that like almost\ndirectly because what because remember\nwith insulin resistance you're not going\nto be absorbing blood sugar from the\nfrom the bloodstream right\nand so when you exercise it actually\nbypasses that whole mechanism it\nrecruits a completely different\nphysiologic mechanism where it's like\nbecause you're exercising now right so\nwe don't care about\nlike you're using your muscles so your\nbody's like well if you're if my muscles\nare active like they need energy so\nlet's absorb this stuff let's pull blood\nsugar out of the bloodstream as the\nblood sugar gets pulled out of the\nbloodstream\nand your blood sugar levels drop then\nyour body's like oh like we have low\nblood sugar so let's break down fat\nlet's break down liver glycogen let's\nbreak down different things so that we\ncan add more blood sugar to the\nbloodstream\nso a lot of like you know i don't know\nif you guys have seen this but the\nactual caloric\nchange from exercise is quite small\nright like i think if you run a mile or\nsomething you'll burn like 50 calories\nlike it's it's very small i don't know\nexactly what the\nnumber is\nthe key thing though is that all these\nbenefits from exercise are not about the\ndirect energy expenditure\nthey're about adjustments to your body's\nmetabolism the basic way your body is\noperating and when we have like a\nsedentary life when we're just sort of\nsitting in our chair all day like all\nthose effects get\nlike they're in the wrong direction\nthose numbers are really off let's see\nhow many calories\ndoes running a mile burn\nokay so\nit looks like\nso it looks like it's 100 calories\nso according to a chart from the\namerican council on exercise a 120 pound\nperson burns about 11.4 calories per\nminute while running so if you run a 10\nminute mile you'll burn 114 calories\nright so one mile\nwill burn 100 calories it's not that bad\nmy point is that there's so if we the\nkey thing there is that like when you\nrun that mile it's not just the calories\nthat you burn\nit's the fact that like you're\nactivating your whole body's like\nmetabolism\nand so then over the next 24 hours\nyou will\nlike burn even more calories because\nyour body is like doing stuff right so\nwhen you\nrun for example presumably your your leg\nmuscles will get stronger so when you\nhypertrophy your your leg muscles\nwhat what's going to end up happening is\nlike there that hypertrophy the building\nup of the leg muscle will require energy\nit's not just about protein right it's\nlike the end like the metabolism\ninvolved\nright so remember that like even we're\nsitting around doing absolutely nothing\nwe tend to burn about 2000 calories a\nday that's just the maintenance of your\nbody requires 2000 calories like\nrespiration\nheartbeat all that kind of stuff\nuh yeah so so i mean you may not get too\nmuch hypertrophy\nyeah so anandamide is\nis originally a compound that i'm not\ntoo familiar\nin a bunch of details but my\nunderstanding of anandamide is it's the\ncompound that is in marijuana right like\nso i think the original person who\ncoined anandamide was\ni think they were indian and they were\nstudying marijuana\nuh isn't the brain the most consuming of\nour energy if you look at the weight\nenergy ratio i'm not sure i would so\nit's definitely one of the highest\nconsumers of glucose\nfor sure\nso we'd\nyou know at some point we may have to do\nlike a very in-depth\ndiscussion about marijuana because i\nthink it's like\none of these topics where\npeople will make like so someone's\nasking questions is weed good for stress\nso that implies that like there's a\nbinary effect right so like either i say\nyes or i say no\nbut the truth is like hopefully if you\nall have been paying attention like the\nkey takeaway when it comes to like\nphysiology as well as like psychology is\nthat it's complicated\nright it's not\nit's not like\nabsolutely good and it's not absolutely\nbad the other thing to remember is that\nanytime you're talking about an\nintervention for a problem\nit's a risk benefit analysis whether\nyou're talking about a medication\nor a substance or\neven exercise there's like a risk\nbenefit analysis right\nso running for example is very good for\nyour cardiovascular health but like can\nbe very hard on the knees\nso we can talk about it the answer is in\nmy opinion it's complicated so like\nthat's where you know there's an\nindividual discussion that i'll\noftentimes have with patients\nabout whether like marijuana is like\nappropriate for them or not\ngenerally speaking i don't advocate for\nregular marijuana use for most people i\nthink there's some\nabsolute exceptions to that like in\nterms of like i've seen very very good\neffects for marijuana use in people who\nare undergoing chemotherapy like\num i even saw a study recently that\nmarijuana may have some positive impact\non covid related stuff\nbut like that that also is like these\nstudies are you know they're like very\ninitial so a lot of times people who\nwant to use marijuana and are looking\nfor a justification will jump on these\nstudies\nwhereas and then similarly you'll have\npeople on the other end of the spectrum\nwho are like all drugs are bad and will\nlike be like oh never use marijuana all\nthese studies like they can't be trusted\nbecause the truth is like just like any\nother anything else we put in our body\nlike chances are\nyou know this herbs that is like so\ncompounds that are supposed to be in our\nbody right we're not talking about like\nlike\nclearly toxic stuff but\nyou know when we talk about things that\nhuman beings will ingest or inhale like\nthere's a variety of different effects\nyou"
