all right okay chat so welcome to\nanother healthy gamer GG stream my name\nis allo kenoa just a reminder that\nalthough I'm a psychiatrist nothing we\ndiscussed on stream today is intended to\nbe taken as medical advice everything is\nfor educational or entertainment\npurposes only if yall have a medical\nconcern or question please go see a\nlicensed professional\num so today we're going to be doing some\nfun stuff actually I got to set up a\ncouple other things now I'm frazzled so\nthe first thing that we're going to do\nis celebrate that this is Dr K streaming\nand sometimes when Dr K streams we\nforget to do things okay or like things\njust get scuffed so this is like where\nunfortunately I'm relying on my racial\nbonus of tech support to get through\nthese stream things and we have an\nawesome staff but despite the fact that\nthey are awesome they cannot overcome my\ngeneral incompetence with this stream\nstuff you think that if it worked it\nworked but it that's not how it is in\nlife\nokay um and I'm now sweaty so I'm going\nto go turn on some air conditioning I\nthink and then I'm going light some\nincense and then I'm going to be right\nback and we're going to talk about [ __ ]\nlife syndrome and it's going to be great\nbecause we're going to learn so much\nabout some of the\nfundamentals of how this stuff works\nokay so so hang tight for a second\nchat e\nall\nright now we are good to go okay so yall\nready to get started should we do some\nchatting about these things\num one last thing I got to do real quick\nI got to just see if we have any\nannouncements um\nokay so oh\nyeah so I've been so distracted that I\nforgot to say that today is the day that\nwe are launching our trauma guide so I\nmade a guide to\ntrauma and uh there um we tried to\nsynthesize research from over 400 100\nstudies um it's something that we put a\nlot of love into the the guide to trauma\nis so it's not a clinical treatment or a\nsubstitute for clinical treatment but\nlike we do with our other guides right\nso like the guide to ADHD and doing\nstuff what we did in our trauma guide is\nit's really a guide about how you get\nshaped so when human beings interact in\nthe world my audio is too low\ncan you pull M closer this is about as\nclose as it gets it's jacked up all the\nway yeah this is oh yeah this is extra\nlow I don't know what's going\non um testing one two3 one two3 one\ntwo3 testing two3 is this better better\nworse better worse better worse better\nworse better worse better it's about the\nsame okay that's weird I don't know what\nto do about my audio I see that it is\nquite quiet okay it's kind of going to\nbe the best it's going to get right now\num okay so we'll we'll I'll keep it like\nsuper super close to my face though we\ncan go like this okay anyway so we have\na trauma guide that came out\ntoday um will so this is not it's really\nnot a substitute for clinical treatment\nbut it is something that I built\nbasically like when I had patients who\nhad diagnoses like PTSD or cptsd and I\nwas thinking about how to help them what\nI discovered is that there's a lot of\nstuff that they can do which is a little\nbit more on the psychoeducation side so\nthings like rewiring their nervous\nsystem and stuff like that those are the\nkinds of things that we tried to invest\nin in in sort of teaching y'all in the\ntrauma guide so it's a lot about sort of\nthe theory of trauma how trauma shapes\nUs and how to potentially rewire or\nbetter understand what trauma does to\nyou super proud of it um we really built\nit with a lot of love and we hope it'll\nhelp I guess just turn up your volume\nand hope that there are no ads because\nthat will be rip rip your rip your ears\num but let's dive\nin okay so a couple couple years\nago I oh and by the way we're going to\nbe showing some stuff from the trauma\nguide like a little bit later but let's\nlike since we're running late I want to\njust dive into\nthe the stuff that we're supposed to\ncover today okay is that okay chat\nokay\num oh hold on I'm missing one\nother oh boy okay hold on\nchat\num okay\ncopy link\naddress man losing all your tabs\nchat life is hard sometimes okay let's\ndive\nin\nso [ __ ] life syndrome what do we know\nabout it I remember seeing this\nmentioned in an HG video a while ago but\nI don't remember which one it was I'm\nsure it's not an empirical medical\nphenomenon or anything but whatever it\nresembles I'm curious about the outcomes\nof the people who suffer from it is\nthere such thing in living in living in\na situation that is systemically\nunhealthy to the point that there isn't\nany viable path to good mental health\ncan people overcome [ __ ] life\nsyndrome so some time ago I talked about\nthis term [ __ ] life syndrome and before\nwe kind of go into more detail I'm going\nto just sort of explain where this term\ncomes from so when I was a second-year\nresident at the maybe intern at\nMassachusetts General Hospital\nI was working with a very very talented\nNur nurse\npractitioner and um you know she would\nsee patients and then would kind of\nreport wow that is really quiet I don't\nknow what to do about that\nchat that's so weird\nOkay\nokay so when I was working with this\nthis uh nurse practitioner she was\nreally awesome and um she would go see\npatients and then I would ask her you\nknow what's what's the diagnosis of the\npatient and then sometimes she would say\nthat this patient has [ __ ] life syndrome\nand so I was really intrigued by the\nterm and I would ask her like what does\nthat mean and she would basically say\nlike okay so you have these people who\ncome into the emergency room and if you\nlook at what their diagnosis is they\nhave like 15 they have ADHD PTSD\nOppositional Defiant Disorder these were\noften times like children or adolescence\nmajor depressive disorder bipolar\ndisorder and poly substance use so they\nhave all of these different\ndiagnoses and the thing about these\ndiagnostic constructs is that the idea\nthat someone has six\ndifferent independent brain pathologies\nor mental health pathologies that are\nall concurrent is exceedingly\nrare and so we use this term [ __ ] life\nsyndrome to basically describe this\ngroup of people whose lives are so bad\nthat as they are trying to survive in\nlife they run into mental health\nchallenges they go somewhere they get\ndiagnosed with a particular thing and\nthen just rack up these\ndiagnosis so this is where the term [ __ ]\nlife syndrome comes from So today we're\ngoing to be talking about what it is and\nwhether it can be\novercome okay so now we're going to talk\nwe're going to look at another post so\nhow to tell the difference between\nmental disorders and [ __ ] life syndrome\nI've been trying to answer this question\nfor a while how do I know what's the\ncause and what's the effect when it\ncomes to mental state am I depressed and\nsuicidal because of how my life turned\nout or am I perceiving life to be more\nshitty than it is because of underlying\nmental disorders I've never been to a\npsychiatrist so I've never been\ndiagnosed but I've been dealing with OCD\nsince I was six I experienced a lot of\nMDD anxiety social phobia and ADHD\nsymptoms I've also been suicidal for\nmore than 6 years the thing is most of\nthose things appear so small when put\nnext to seven figures in the bank\naccount most of my issues would\nimmediately disappear only then would I\nbe able to do the things because I can\nuh uh do to do things because I can not\nbecause I have\nto um I experienced what I'd call a\nmoney induced paralysis it's very\nunlikely that I'll ever be financially\nindependent and it's unlikely I'll ever\nfind something interesting enough I deem\nworthy I deem worth pursuing for hours\non end those realizations alone are an\nto make me apathetic procrastinate on\nall matters and basically give up on\nlife and wait for the right opportunity\nto kill myself I'd rather be dead than\nlive a life I don't consider to be worth\nthe effort I've been thinking about\nseeing a psychiatrist for the past few\nmonths but I have my doubts I\nprocrastinate on making an appointment\nbecause it feels like my problems stem\nfrom money and it's not like they'll\nmake me Rich over there that is enough\njustification for me not to go I also\ncan't get myself to schedule other\nappointments blood tests phys dentists\ncuz in my if my life will remain the\nsame despite improving in some areas\nthen why bother oh I don't know what\nthat is I'll kill myself anyway without\nsome magical Epiphany occurring in my\nmind I suspect there could be something\nwrong with my brain because plenty of\nother people have lives objectively\nworse than me yet they see survival as\nsomething of value value in and of\nitself that could be the result of them\nbeing ignorant me being ungrateful or my\nbrain being disabled so how do I know\nwhether my my shitty mental state is\ncaused by my views on life philosophy\nbad attitude being lazy ungrateful\nspoiled Etc or by some condition beyond\nmy reach or perhaps that's how it's\nsupposed to be because my conclusions\nare logical and I just can't ignore them\nso this is a very very very common\nproblem so some of us look at our lives\nand we say that things are objectively\nbad and we look at our lives and we\nthink okay so like modifying my internal\ninstrument is useless if my\ncircumstances are bad right so we can\nsay like okay I'm short I'm\nbald my chances of ending up with\nsomeone seem very very very very low so\nwhat's the point in trying like the my\nlife is objectively\nbad and what what basically and and so\nthen like the question is like okay is\nthis mental illness like is this an\nappropriate\nadaptation to negative circumstance\nances or is this a mental illness that\nis misinterpreting what my chances are\nhow do I know which one it\nis so today we're going to talk about\nhow to address this problem it's a\nfascinating problem we're going to dig\ninto a lot of research the short answer\nis that it is a false dichotomy and that\neven if your circumstances are bad I\nbelieve that you can do drastic things\nto drastically improve your\ncircumstances so I believe [ __ ] life\nsyndrome can largely be\novercome and even though that sounds\nvery very if you're rebelling against\nthat that is part of [ __ ] life syndrome\nwhich we'll kind of get to right so the\nfirst thing that I want you all to\nnotice is that if I say that this is\npossible your mind will automatically\nhave a reaction and so the problem with\n[ __ ] life syndrome is that you have\nobjective\nproblems and you have internal problems\nand the problem is that your objectives\nof problems you may not be able to fix\nbut even when you're subjectively\nhampering yourself it is very difficult\nto to fix your\nsituation so like I'll give you all a\nsimple\nexample so what is the difference\nbetween a setback and a\nfailure so in both cases the objective\nreality can be the same I tried\nsomething and I failed the difference\nbetween a setback and a failure is\nwhether I decide to try again and if I\ntry again and and then I succeed then\nthe failure becomes a setback and if I\ndecide to stop at that point the failure\nbecomes a failure so this is what's\nreally crazy and this is what we're\ngoing to dig into today is that even if\nyour life is bad I'm not saying it's\nobjectively bad that there are certain\nthings that you can do that will change\nthe way that you approach life which\nwill then hopefully lead to positive\noutcomes and I'm going to try to base\nthis in as much like evidence as I can I\nmean that's not Tech even true but I'm\ngoing to site evidence to sort of\nsupport this viewpoint but basically\ndon't give up\nchat now the first thing that I I want\nto do is let's just look at this\nlanguage okay so\num uh hold on a\nsecond so it is very unlikely that I'll\never be financially independent and it's\nunlikely I'll ever find something\ninteresting enough to worth that enough\nI deem worth pursuing those realizations\nalone are enough to make me apathetic\nprocrastinate on all matters and\nbasically give up on life now I want you\nall to stop and think about this for a\nsecond which of these two things do you\nthink is\nresponsible for this person's situation\nis it the fact that they believe that\nthey'll be let's say they're financially\ndependent and they're not passionate at\nanything these are two objective facts\nbut the realizations are alone are\nenough to make me apathetic right so\nthis is where we have to be very very\nvery careful because now what we see is\nthat there is a objective circumstance\non the outside which results in a\nrealization and then that realization\ncreates apathy procrastination and\npeople giving up and then what is\nresponsible for you staying stuck it is\nactually a combination of all of these\nthings it is a false dichotomy so let's\ntalk a little bit about [ __ ] life\nsyndrome so this is a psychodynamic\narticle\nthat someone kind of talks about [ __ ]\nlife syndrome so uh this is like so so\nthis is what's really interesting is\n[ __ ] life syndrome is something that\nclinicians came up with so let's read\nthis case Okay um in the letter from the\ndoctor we learned that she had\nexperienced a number of problems since\nearly childhood she had initially been\nraised in foster care bad thing number\none abused by a neighbor bad thing\nnumber two left home at only 17 Bad\nThing number three subsequently engaged\nin a series of emotionally and sex\nsexually abusive relationships with men\nbad thing number four the father of her\nbaby had recently been jailed for drug\nrated crime bad thing number five and\nnow at 24 she was raising a 2-year-old\nby herself she was currently unemployed\nstruggling to manage government benefits\nand appeared to have no family and few\nnetworks available this is [ __ ] life\nsyndrome this person it appears does not\nhave a chance bad thing after bad thing\nafter bad thing and there is a lot of\ndata that supports that this is what\nhappens right so we have a lot of of\nstudies on something called adverse\nchildhood experiences which is that if\nyou have a bad\nupbringing what tends to happen is that\nthis correlates with worse mental health\noutcomes worse life outcomes this is\nvery common so let's talk a little bit\nabout\num so I've since become very curious\nabout this expression [ __ ] life syndrome\nnot the least because of the implicit\nconsensus by everyone in the meeting\nincluding S as to what it meant everyone\nknows what it means even though it's\nnever been defined the phrase seemed to\ndenote a level of long-standing poverty\nfamily breakdown lack of stability\nunemployment and potential risk factors\ncommon to many of the predominantly\nyoung working class patients refer to\nthe\nservice okay so for [ __ ] of course is\nsomething that we generally prefer not\nto think about something we continually\nreject get rid of or hide at the same\ntime it is something that we cannot\ncompletely repudiate it is part of us\nsomething we need something that is in\nin inly inly I don't even what that\nmeans part of our status as human beings\nis\nsubjects those suffering from [ __ ] life\nsyndrome then would be would seem to be\nthose individuals whose problems are\ndeemed to be so terrible so untouchable\nthat they quite literally cannot be\nthought about and cannot be handled by\nthe service Okay so let's understand\nwhere this term comes from [ __ ] life\nsyndrome is a term that came up that was\ndis that was stumbled upon by mental\nhealth\nprofessionals when they were tasked with\nhelping people that seemed\nunhelpable no amount of you coming to my\noffice one hour a week for therapy is\ngoing to fix your history of abuse your\nproblems with employment your history of\nsexual partners that have been abusive\nto you your foster care back ground your\nhistory of trauma the ADHD the OCD\nthere's no amount of therapy that will\nfix this objectively bad thing and so we\ncall this [ __ ] life syndrome right\nbecause it's like it's it's too much to\nhandle even in the term we don't really\nDefine it we say that this is\nunsolvable this is coming from\nclinicians by the way\nokay so the question is can we do\nsomething about it and my belief is yes\nso I say this as a clinician who has\nboth failed to do something about it in\na lot of the people that I've worked\nwith and as someone who has succeeded in\ndoing something about it with a lot of\nthe people that I worked with so I'm not\nsaying that this answer is is 100% is\ngoing to transform your life or whatever\nbecause there's a lot of data that shows\nthat your mental health is correlated\nwith some of your\ncircumstances so let's understand this\nright so if we're looking at let's just\ngo to another oh I I remember what which\npaper I was missing haha I remember now\nbecause I want to talk about it hold\non here it is okay so let's take a look\nat another\npaper so deaths of Despair adults at\nhigh risk for death by Suicide poisoning\nor chronic liver disease in the United\nStates so there is this this construct\nthat we have discovered in mental health\ncalled deaths of Despair I think this\nwas originally discovered actually in\nthe UK so there were these old fishing\nvillages that used to have very robust\neconomies and then once like the fishing\nindustry left the town became like a\nghost town There's No economy people\nstarted drinking people started\ncommitting suicide and as we tunnel down\ninto why are people commit killing\nthemselves um what we discovered is that\nthere's a lot of systemic factors that\nare causing this right so this is like\nhow do we know it's systemic because if\nit was individual it would be variable\nwithin a population\nbut what we find is everyone in this\ntown is an alcoholic and is suicidal not\neveryone but the rates are way higher\nand then in this neighboring town where\nthings are socioeconomically better like\nthe climate is the same the water is the\nsame but like the economic situation is\ndifferent we see way less suicide and\nalcoholic liver disease among other\nthings so we see substance use\nsuicidality depression there's a big\ndifference so systemic and problems have\nsystemic Solutions I 100% believe this\nthis is part of the reason we started\nhealthy gamer in the first place so I I\nwant yall to really think about this why\ndid we start this because I saw a\nsystemic problem that I realized no\namount of like talking to people in my\noffice is going to\nfix what I saw in my office was an\nincreasing was an\nincreasing number of people who did not\nknow how to live life they didn't know\nhow they work and since you don't know\nhow you work you can't figure out how to\nlive\nlife so today what we're going to talk\nabout is teach y'all the fundamentals of\nlike is this mental illness or is my\nlife bad because the answer is neither\nand\nboth so this is what I want youall to\nunderstand you are a living organism and\nthe whole point of a living organism is\nthat it interacts and is shaped by its\nenvironment we are in a\nhomeostatic relationship with our\nenvironment we adapt to our environment\nwe shape our environment so it goes both\nways okay so give you all a simple\nexample so if it's hot outside I will\nstart to sweat if it is cold outside\nthat's called diaphoresis if it's cold\noutside I will have pyo erection which\nmeans I will have Goosebumps and my hair\nwill stand on end my physical body\nadapts to the circumstances around me in\norder to try to succeed in this scenario\nso when we say that people with with\n[ __ ] life syndrome is this [ __ ] life\nsyndrome is this mental illness the\nanswer is both mental illness is often\ntimes the consequence or the adaptation\nto negative\ncircumstances okay so I'll give you all\na simple\nexample we consider PTSD a mental\nillness and why is it a mental illness\nbecause it does not allow beings to live\ntheir life normally but what we also\nknow about PTSD is that it is an\nadaptation it is a mechanism of survival\nthat the organism goes through so as a\nsimple example of this if I've been\ntraumatized in some way my body is on\nhigh alert my my autonomic nervous\nsystem is wired in a high arousal State\nmy heart rate goes up my blood pressure\ngoes up I start to think more\ncatastrophically which is not a bug it's\na feature it's an adaptation when the\nbrain is faced with danger we need to\nfocus on the worst case scenarios not\nthe middleof the road scenario right\nthat's an that's a survival\nadaptation the problem is that these\nadaptations which allow us to\nsurvive prevent us from thriving because\nthese two goals are fundamentally\ndifferent so the problem in [ __ ] life\nsyndrome is that the way that you wire\nis is not to succeed it is to survive\nnow I want y'all to think about the\nimplications of that really think about\nthat okay so think about for example\nlike I'll give you all just a couple of\nexamples so one thing that we develop is\nsomething like low\nself-esteem or we talk about this in the\ntrauma guide one of the things that we\nsee in [ __ ] life syndrome is the\ninability to consider the future so if\nwe look at this post and you read it\nthis person is not future oriented they\nare not planning for the future they are\nnot doing steps 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nthey are simply existing and responding\nto the environment they are apathetic\nthey procrastinate and they're not like\nthey're not exerting an influence to\nchange their their situation now people\ncan call this laziness but it's not\nlaziness it's an adaptation so let's\nunderstand this I'll give you all just\none example\nso when someone grows up in\na what's the right word a deficient\nenvironment an environment that does not\nhave\nstimulation what happens is our if we\ngrow up in an environment where we are\nnot allowed to plan for the future if we\ngrow up in an environment where our\ncircumstances control our future our\nbrain loses sight of the ability to plan\nfor the future okay so I'll give you all\na simple example let's say I'm a kid and\nI want to have a birthday party because\nall my friends have a birthday party so\nI go to my mom and my dad and I say hey\nMom and Dad can I have a birthday party\nthis weekend with my friends and your\nmom and dad say\nsure then what happens is if you think\nabout being a\nseven-year-old you can't plan your own\nbirthday party you don't know how to\norder cake you don't know how to invite\nfriends you don't know how to do any of\nthat so it is your parents\nresponsibility to do all of those things\nbut if your parents if you have a single\nparent household and your parent is\nworking through jobs if you have parents\nwho struggle with substance use if you\nhave parents who don't know how to\noperationalize their own problems\nbecause they have a history of trauma\nthey don't know how to make your\nbirthday party and so what happens is\nyou have or in the worst case scenario\nyour parents say yeah we can have a\nbirthday party and then the day before\nthe birthday party one of your parents\nis drunk and angry and they arbitrarily\npunish you for nothing that you did\nwrong and they say you don't get a\nbirthday party because you're making too\nmuch noise you don't understand how to\nbe respectful unrespectful kids\ndisrespectful kids don't deserve\nbirthday\nparties now when you grow up in an\nenvironment like this what is the cost\nof thinking about the future just\npain you told all your friends hey I'm\ngoing to have a birthday party and what\nhappens your birthday party gets\ncanceled now you're\nashamed now you feel disappointed now\nyou feel like your expectations have\nbeen let\ndown so what we see on Research from\nfrom complex PTSD especially is that the\ncapacity for your brain to think about\nthe future requires that when you were a\nchild and you think about the future\nthat is\nrewarded but if thinking about the\nfuture leads to a punishment leads to\nexpectations that get dashed lead to\nsuffering then your brain is like this\nis a waste of time thinking about the\nfuture is only results in pain and\nnothing good ever comes of it so we're\ngoing to stop thinking about the future\nthere's a lot of really interesting\nresearch on this on prisoners of War so\nwhen you're a prisoner of war thinking\nabout the future is useless you don't\nknow if you're going to be in this\nprison for a year 5 years 10 years\nthere's no promotion there's no leaving\nit's just about survival so when the\nhuman brain starts focusing on Survival\nit does not focus on thriving these are\ntwo different adaptive strategies I want\nyou all to think about this in terms of\na video\ngame right so like the build that I have\nlike a tank build is different from like\na solo accomplishing build right if\nyou're playing something like bg3 you\ncan do this Lone Wolf Run which is like\nI'm going to do everything myself and\nyou build the character in a very\nspecific way this leads to\nthriving but if all you're doing in life\nis tanging damage you are not going to\nlean into thriving that's not what\nyou've been programmed for you've been\nprogrammed for\nsurvival and if you've been programmed\nfor survival it becomes very hard to\ncreate the life that you want to because\nthat's not how your brain works okay\nso then the problem is that these\nadaptations cause future problems\nbecause you don't know how to craft a\nlife that like is fulfilling right so\nthis person may not even know like they\nsay like pursuing a passion I don't know\nhow to pursue a passion\nso I don't feel passionate about\nanything so just as an example of that\nif you have a history of trauma your\nbrain goes through something called\nhemispheric lateralization which is\nalong the dissociation Spectrum so you\nunplug from your emotions when you\nunplug from your emotions Your Capacity\nto feel passion\ndisappears because you're unplugged why\nare you unplugged in order to survive\nfrom the negative\nemotions so our brain is like okay I can\nget overwhelming shame\nthat's bad so I'm going to unplug from\nemotion we're going to alt f4 emotion.\nexe and when we alt4 emotion. exe we\nlose access to Passion as\nwell so the adaptations that we use to\nsurvive are the very things that prevent\nus from\nthriving now here's the really tricky\nthing is it turns out that these\nadaptations that you\nmake will be deterministically bad for\nfor you in the future okay so remember\nthat the organism is in homeostasis with\nthe environment we're trying to survive\nso we're forming certain kinds of\nadaptations so if we look at some of\nthese adaptations what we find is that\nthese adaptations will become\nproblematic in the future okay so I'll\ngive you all a simple example of this\nokay so the cognitive combined cognitive\nhypothesis and depression so this is a a\npaper that looks at cognitive\nbiases so we know is that when people\nhave a history of trauma and when they\nsuffer from depression which by the way\ncan be an appropriate like almost like\nan adaptation or maladaptation from your\ncircumstances so here's the chain of\nreasoning okay adverse childhood\nexperiences increase the risk of\ndepression so if you've had a [ __ ] life\nyou are more likely to have depression\nonce you add depression into the mix\nthat creates perspective problems this\nis not about the history this is the way\nwe have been wired creates problems for\nthe way that we're going to live the\nlive the play the game of life so there\nare multiple theories behind this but\nthey're basically all agree that there's\nsome kind of bias in our mind so we have\nmemory biases this is wild okay oh did I\nfind yes this is a cool\npaper oh\nno hold on um\nnope let me see if I can find\nit I want to find this\n[Music]\none yes here we\ngo uh\nokay so this is like really weird okay\nso what we know is that there are memory\nbiases in\ndepression so a memory bias for negative\nmaterial found that individuals\ndiagnosed with depression recalled more\ngeneric or overgeneral memories that\nthan did their non-depressed\ncounterparts okay so this is kind of\nweird but what this means is that people\nwith depression do not remember like POS\ndetails like their memory just is like\nvague in terms of positive stuff um\nso importantly the tendency to elaborate\nnegative emotional information memory\nbias for this information and recall of\novergeneral memories may be associated\nwith other cognitive aspects of\ndepression so these are the three biases\nright so what starts to happen once we\nenter this depressed\nstate which is a consequence\nof um our adverse childhood experiences\nis that this is not the negative\nexperience okay let me take a step back\nI'm GNA actually just start the section\nover so I'm realizing I'm jumping around\ntoo much okay so let's take a step back\nokay Dr K is going to\nrewind so is this mental illness or is\nthis [ __ ] life syndrome which one is it\nis it my bad circumstances or is it\nsomething wrong in my brain the answer\nis both so our current understanding of\nmental illness is based on I think this\nis the prevailing Theory it's the one\nthat I prescrib to something called the\nstress diathesis model so the stress di\nstress diathesis model means that in\norder to be ill it is not illness is a\nconsequence of two things a genetic\npredisposition plus an environmental\nexposure so there is something that is\npart of you plus some environmental\nshaping results in something called a\nmental illness and this is really\nconsistent with our studies of things\nlike depression and adverse childhood\nexperiences okay so if I have a crappy\nlife my mind starts to get\ndepressed now the problem is that the\ndepression is a consequence of my past\nbut it very actively and negatively\nshapes my future and this is where\nthings like cognitive bias come in so we\nknow that once you have some negative VI\nview of yourself it changes the way you\nperceive the world you pay attention to\nmore negative stimuli so if we look at\nthis p uh\npaper what we basically find is that if\nyou're looking at a neutral face you\nwill pick up negativity even within\nneutrality so what we know about\ncognitive bias and depression is let's\nsay that I\nhave multiple interactions throughout\nthe day 25% of my interactions are\npositive 25% of my interactions are\nnegative and 50% of my interactions are\nneutral once I have a cognitive bias\nfrom\ndepression this is created by the\ndepression now okay what this means is\nthat I tend\nto\novergeneralize the positive parts of my\nmemory so the positive parts of my\nmemory become vague and fuzzy They Don't\nReally sink\nin the negative parts of my memory get\nturned into negative I mean sorry the\nnegative parts of my memory are negative\nand then the neutral Parts become\nnegative so now in a life that is 25%\ngood 25% bad and 50% in the middle my\nbrain interprets that this is 75% bad\nand 25% neutral I don't really remember\nthe positive stuff now this creates a\nprospective impact on my\nlife so it isn't just that I have [ __ ]\nlife syndrome that's Absolut absolutely\nbad and that results in depression can't\nreally control that but then the\ndepression determines my\nfuture and this is where I know it\nsounds crazy but like the reason that I\nthink [ __ ] life syndrome can get better\nis because there are three steps to this\nthere is circumstances which are outside\nof control create an adaptation this\nadaptation creates your destiny now this\nyou can't control but this you can fix\nand when you fix this\nthis\nchanges so that's what we're going to\ntalk about today so now the question is\nhow so I'm going to give you all just a\ncouple of really simple\nexamples okay of how you can change your\nthinking and what I see in people who\nhave [ __ ] life syndrome and people who\ndon't so first is when people don't grow\nup with adverse childhood experiences or\nin high socioeconomic status the first\nthing that's different is that people in\n[ __ ] life syndrome do not think that can\nshape their future so I want youall to\njust think about this okay so if I have\n[ __ ] life syndrome I grow up in an\nenvironment where my\nintentions do not shape my circumstances\nwhether I want to play or I don't want\nto play or I want to wake up on time\nwhether I want to do well on a school\nproject or don't want to do school well\non a school project I'm so neglected in\nmy household that my desires become\nworthless they have no bearing on the\nenvironment\nso once our brain realizes that our\ndesire has no differential impact on the\nenvironment it decides let's forget\nabout desire compare that to what we see\nin the worst cases as\nentitlement in people who have high\nsocioeconomic status where the world\nsays hey you don't get to jump to the\nfront of the line and their cognitive\nbias is so robust that they say everyone\nelse needs to move out of the way they\nbelieve that they are allowed to shape\nthe\nenvironment right so this is a huge\ndifference and it leads to a huge\ndifference in outcomes and I'm not\nsaying that like the everyone with high\nsces is entitled I think entitlement is\nbad but there's this fundamental idea so\nlike I'd like to say that I had a\nhealthy version of this at some point\nwas unhealthy and I worked through that\nso my parents grew up or my dad grew up\nvery poor so like they couldn't they\nwere like they had to take loans to pay\ntheir bills\nthey like could not afford sugar like\nthey it was like they were super poor\nthere were like eight of them that lived\nin an 8 by10 room half of them not half\nlike three or four of them would sleep\noutside on on like outside the house\nbasically like on the you guys know like\nyou have an apartment complex and\noutside you have like a staircase that\npeople climb up to get to so they used\nto sleep like on on the stairs and The\nLandings on the steps right so this was\nthe environment that they grew up\nin however my dad worked really hard had\nparents who really pushed him got\neducated became doctors came to the\nUnited States so they instilled in\nme a perspective that I can shape my\nfuture and so then when I had setbacks\nin life I had the benefit of growing up\nin a household where I was taught that\nif you try you can succeed you have the\ncapacity you don't have to take things\nlaying down if at first you don't\nsucceed it's a setback it's not a fail\nthat is such a huge Advantage now this\nis not the circumstances that I grew up\nwith this is what is in my mind when I\nam faced with a problem so it's not just\nthe the the physical circumstances it is\nand the physical circumstances were good\ntoo but it is the inst installation of\nhow you see the world and this is what\nis so devastating about [ __ ] life\nsyndrome what [ __ ] life syndrome teaches\nyou is that what you do does not matter\nmatter this is the lesson that you learn\nand once you learn this lesson then your\nfuture is\ndetermined the beautiful thing is that\nyou can unlearn this lesson and when you\nunlearn this lesson and you discover\nthat you can shape your circumstances\nthen a lot of things will go\nwell right this is not your actual\ncircumstances this is the way that you\nrespond to your circumstances so I want\nyou all to just think about two people\nwhen faced with some set of challeng\nches one person believes that if I'm\nchallenged there's nothing I can do\nabout it and the other person believes\nthere is something I can do about it I\ndon't have to take it laying down what\nimpact do you think those two attitudes\nwill have on these people's lives so\nthat's the first adaptation is simply\nbelieving that you can affect your your\nlife or you can't can I shape my\ncircumstances or can I not shape my\ncircumstances and I'm not saying that\npeople are are stupid for believing they\ncan't shape their circumstances\nremember that if they believe this they\nbelieve this for a good reason it is\nbecause they haven't shaped their\ncircumstances so this is the other thing\nabout the human organism the human\norganism learns from the past and it\ncarries that forward into the\nfuture now the problem is that sometimes\nthe learning that we do is maladaptive\nso I'll give you all a great example of\nthis so I don't know if yall played Dark\nSouls\n1 but in Dark Souls 1 there's this like\ncheat kind of thing that you can do\nthere's this dragon and you can shoot\nthe dragon in the tail and if you shoot\nit enough times the tail falls off and\nyou get this thing called The Dragon\nTail sword now the dragon tail sword is\nop you can one-hot a lot of enemies so\nwhen I first played Dark Souls 1 I got\nthe dragon tail sword cuz someone told\nme about it and then I was one-shotting\nall the enemies and then I gave up on\nthe game because it became too hard cuz\nat some point the Dragon taale Sword\nstopped stop scaling and you can't one\nshot anything and then the game became\nso hard I was like this game is [ __ ]\ndumb and I\nquit so later a friend I was talking to\na friend of mine and he said you know\nwhat the dragon tail sword is the\nbiggest scam in the game it is the\nbiggest Noob trap in the game no wonder\nyou gave up and I said what do you mean\nand he said if you get the dragon tail\nsword you never learn how to play the\ngame you don't need to roll you don't\nneed to Parry you don't need to like\nZone people out you don't need to pay\nattention it is such a\ncrutch so the way that I learn to play\nthe game based on my circumstances set\nme up for a failure in the future we\nalso see this in things like Elden ring\nright I'm going to play some [ __ ]\nArcane Katana rivers of blood Noob\ncheese build I'm going to cheese my way\nthrough everything except if I ever run\ninto a boss that has bleed resistance\nthen I'm in\ntrouble this is what [ __ ] life syndrome\nis it is an adaptation to a cheese way\nof living life which is is not thriving\nwhich is\nsurviving now if I ask you okay so if I\nplay with the Dragon taale Sword does\nthis mean that I can't beat Dark Souls\nif I play some Arcane cheese Katana\nbuild does this mean I can't beat Elden\nring of course not but it requires you\nto\nadapt your general approach to the game\nand this is exactly what [ __ ] life\nsyndrome is like and when I work with\npeople with [ __ ] life syndrome what we\nfind is that there are three major\nadaptations that they need to make these\nare the three most important adaptations\nif you can make these adaptations\nthere's a good chance that your life\nwill\nimprove so the first adaptation is\nsomething that we first couple we've\nalready talked about so number one is\ncan you change your environment can you\nshape your life as long as you believe\nyou can't that will result in\nthis these real ations are alone alone\nare enough to make me apathetic\nprocrastinate on all matters and\nbasically give up on life this is the\nproblem right so this is very\ndeterministic thinking about the future\nif you think your future is set in stone\nwhich by the way is reasonable to\nbelieve given the fact that your future\nhas been set in stone when you were\nlearning to play the game of life but\nthis becomes deterministically\nproblematic okay because this means that\nyou stop trying and if you stop trying\nthen there's a very little chance that\nthings will\nsucceed second\nrealization is jumping to conclusions so\nthere is a cognitive thing that I see a\nlot of people who have [ __ ] life\nsyndrome they jump to conclusions they\nlook at circumstances and they think\nthat circumstances means this since I've\nbeen alone for my whole life this means\nI will be alone forever since Dr K is\nsaying [ __ ] life syndrome is real that\nmeans there's nothing I can do about it\nwhat they really do is they there's a\nvery very tight line between like one\nthing and another thing they basically\njump to conclusions there's there there\nisn't Nuance or critical thinking so if\nwe look at this right so it's very\nunlikely that I'll ever be Financial\nindependent and it's unlikely I'll ever\nfind something interesting interesting\nenough I deem worthy worth\npursuing these real realizations make me\njump to a\nconclusion so the way that I would like\nyou know I've had patients like this\nbefore and there there are things that\nyou can do to change this right so what\nI'd say is oh that's so interesting so\nunlikely oliv find something interesting\nenough I deem worth pursuing so then I\nwould talk to this person this like What\nI've Done Right is I'd ask them what is\nthe nature of Interest what determines\nhow interested you are is there anything\nthat you can do to change your level of\ninterest in something is something is\nbeing interested in something a passive\nthing that is preener\nor do you have some kind of control\nfurthermore realizations alone alone are\nenough to make me apathetic okay so\nlet's talk about being\napathetic if you are apathetic does that\nmean that you cannot\nact what is the relationship between\nfeeling like acting and being able to\nact so as you start to dig into a lot of\nthese nuances you start to see a lot of\npositive\nchange because it's this stuff that is\ntruly\ndeterministic we can't control what your\ncircumstances are if you get diagnosed\nwith like stage four metastatic cancer\nthere's not much you can\ndo right there are absolutely things\nthat are deterministic and we'll talk\nabout circumstances for sure we're going\nto get into more detail about that but\nmy point is that the adaptations to\nsurvive will often times keep you from\nthriving and so you need to unlearn\nthose adaptations and one of the most\nimportant things that I want to pay\nattention to is how quickly your mind\njumps to a conclusion I can bet y'all\nmoney because I've seen this before\nanytime I talk about super challenging\nthings what inevitably happens is\nsomeone will\nrespond Dr K was saying this and they\nwill jump to some kind of conclusion are\nthey saying I'm screwed or they're\nsaying that he says it's possible but I\ndon't accept that Dr K doesn't\nunderstand this those are all valid\ncriticisms I'm not saying that those are\ninvalid my point is that yall need to\npay attention to how your mind jumps to\na conclusion so think about even how you\nwere receiving what I am\nsaying are you looking at it critically\nor is some part of your mind jumping up\nand saying this is wrong or this may\nwork for other people but it won't work\nfor me or this may work because these\npeople have Dr K as a psychiatrist and I\ndon't have Dr K as a\npsychiatrist there are thousand\ndifferent things that your mind will\njump to so quickly and look at where all\nof those thoughts go go all of th those\nthoughts result in\ninaction that's the\nproblem look at where your mind goes and\nwhat does it result in does it result in\ninaction does it result in\napathy because this is a construct of\nthe mind right this is what's really\ncrazy I'm not disputing that you guys\nthink that way you think that way for\nreason we have a ton of [ __ ] evidence\nthat shows us that this is really\nconsistent people do this all the time\ninformation processing changes there are\nso many cognitive biases in depression\nand furthermore this is what's really\ncrazy so I don't know if you all\nremember this uh\npaper my good old Randy arbach Sarah\nRichard and Sarah\nCTS and Nicole\nEberhart but this is a paper that is\nshowing how this is kind of wild but\nbasically\nthis is a paper that shows that when you\nhave a low perceived control when you\ndon't believe you are in control of your\nof your life that creates stressful\nsituations so our\nperception and results indicated that\ndependent interpersonal stress mediated\nthe relationship between low perceived\ncontrol and higher levels of social\nanxiety in in girls conversely boys who\nexhibited low perceived control\nexperienced a greater occurrence of\ndependent interpersonal stressors so\nthis is really important to understand\nwhen you believe you are out of control\nthis\ncreates\nstressors so what a lot of us\nthink is that the reason that I feel out\nof control is because there are\ncircumstances in my life that keep on\nhappening to me that I can't create my\nlife is out of control because this is\nis going wrong this is going wrong this\nis going wrong this is going\nwrong what this paper really shows us is\nthat it is the perception of low\nperceived control that creates problems\nin your life and I'll give you all an\nexample if you're skeptical of\nthat so let's say that I have a family\nemergency and I have a big pay Perdue in\none week and I need to email my\nprofessor to let them know there's a\nvoice in my head that says hey hey let\nyour professor know that you have a\nfamily emergency and that you're you may\nnot be able to get the paper in on time\nbut then what happens as I procrastinate\nor I think maybe I can get the paper\ndone or maybe I think I don't want I\ndon't I don't feel good it makes me feel\nashamed to ask for an extension I know\nI've been there hopefully all have been\nthere so this resonates with you there\nis a right action to take in this\nsituation but you procrastinate in doing\nthe right action and then what happens\nis a week goes by you haven't worked on\nthe paper now it's the night before the\npaper is due and now you begin to\nquestion yourself because you're like\nnow if I ask like if I tell them oh\nthere was a family emergency a week ago\nbut now I'm asking for an extension on\nthe paper the professor isn't going to\nbelieve\nme they're going to think I'm making it\nup I really should have done it a week\nago this anxiety creates a negative\nsituation if you had not been anxious in\nthe first place you would have sent the\nemail you'd have said hey I have a\nfamily emergency\nI'm not quite sure if I'm going to be\nable to get to the paper just wanted to\nlet you know we all know that is the\nright answer and if you look at your\nlife you're [ __ ] procrastinating you\nknow what the right answer\nis the problem is you can't do it and it\nis not that your life is randomly out of\ncontrol it's because you [ __ ] neglect\nit you procrastinate that creates your\nsituations we see this so much in our\nlife I'm not saying bad things don't\nhappen happened to\nus absolutely there's bad\nRNG and now we get to really the Crocs\nof [ __ ] life syndrome which is that in\nthis life there are things that are\noutside of your control and things that\nare inside of your control and the\nbeautiful thing about the homeostatic\nnature of life this isn't just humans\nthis is like even amoeba when amoeba\ndetect the wrong chemical gradient they\nwill move in the opposite direction they\nare responding to\nlife and the problem that we have in\n[ __ ] life syndrome is that we can not\nrespond appropriately to life I need to\nsend my professor an email asking for an\nextension that is what the situation\ndemands there is a right answer\nhere what is it that gets in the way of\nme engaging the right answer what do\ny'all\nthink this this is what gets in the way\ninterpretation bias\nattentional bias oh my God my professor\nwill think I'm\npathetic oh my God he'll dislike me oh\nmy God this hasn't worked in the past\nI've asked for help in the past and it\nhasn't worked there is a memory bias\nthere but it doesn't mean that it's all\nfalse there's a bias right there's a\nkernel of Truth or especially if you've\ngot [ __ ] life syndrome a lot of Truth so\nanother big thing that people with [ __ ]\nlife syndrome learn and think about how\ndevastating this is to learn asking for\nhelp does doesn't\nhelp two kinds of people in\nlife those who ask for help and those\nwho don't and why does someone stop\nasking for help because they learn it's\nuseless all of the thoughts and beliefs\nthat you have in your mind if you have\n[ __ ] life syndrome are warranted they\nare Justified that does not make them\nright this is a very important Nuance to\nunderstand understand you can have a lot\nof logic for believing what you believe\nbut that does the construct that you\nhave in your brain does not dictate what\nhappens in the future this is the real\ntragedy this is the the tricky\nthing so the first is even the belief of\nself-determination the second is jumping\nto conclusions the third is not asking\nfor help and even I struggle asking for\nhelp because I feel ashamed and I feel\nstupid\nlike it's so dumb it's like dumb right\nand the fourth thing that we also talked\nabout is the loss of future orientation\nthis one is very\nhard so if you look at some people like\nyou look at some of these people and\nthey're like living a life and part of\nliving their life is like a dimension of\nfuture this is so simple that it's like\nI don't even know if this makes sense\nyou look at some people and they're\ndoing [ __ ] in order you guys know what I\nmean they're like today I'm going to I'm\ntraining for a\nmarathon in August of 2025 and I look at\nthese people I'm like what the [ __ ] man\nI'm trying to get through the\nweek and they're like yeah I have a\nbucket list I'm like bro I'm trying to\nsurvive the\nday I'm just waiting for the next DOTA\npatch to drop how do you have a bucket\nlike I don't have a bucket list someone\nrecently asked me and they were\nlike what have you done on your bucket\nlist and I'm like I don't have a bucket\nlist\nand then I was like kind of like is this\nbecause I'm yogic detached from my life\nand I'm like content with my life or is\nit because like when I was a [ __ ]\ndegenerate gamer and I was just like\n[ __ ] waking up every day and playing\nvideo games for 20 hours a day I stopped\nthinking about the future I think it's a\nlittle bit of\nboth the concept that I can accomplish\ngoals in my life is foreign to\nme this idea and think about the\nhubris of having a bucket list this idea\nthat if you set these random ass goals\nthat are so far away that you will one\nday achieve even a portion of them like\nwhat the [ __ ] do you all get how that's\na their brain is working differently it\nis thinking about the future Dimension\nas something that can be realized and\nliterally half of the people that I work\nwith and I mean half okay I think it's a\npretty good estimate because I work with\nlosers and I work with winners and the\nwinners I work with have all these goals\nand the losers that I work with don't\nhave\nany and it's like their mind operates in\na different\nway this too relates to trauma so we\nknow that once again surviving in a\nprisoner of war camp thinking about the\nfuture is a waste of time so our brain\nunlearns thinking about the\nfuture so when we have [ __ ] life\nsyndrome is it bad absolutely is the\ndeck stacked against you absolutely but\nthere is hope\nbecause what is really holding you back\nis not the circumstances that is what\nhas held you back that I completely\nagree and this is a Nuance that's\nimportant but what holds you back what's\nheld you back for the last five years is\ndifferent from what will hold you back\nfrom the next 5 years and even remember\nthere's no future orientation so even\nthe capacity to realize that is\nimpaired that the future will be\ndifferent from the past when all you are\ntrying to do is survive every day is the\nsame\nand we see this so much it's so sad in\nour community I'm proud of this in a\nweird way because this is a place where\nI want y'all to come and feel this it's\nokay to feel this we don't want to we\ndon't want you to feel ashamed of\nfeeling this way but people come here\nand they're like I'm existing I'm not\nliving so that's what we want to help\nyou with and the really sad thing about\nthis is not fair forget about Fair we\ncan get caught up in Fair as much as you\nwant to I don't know about Fair it makes\nme sad\nbut\nlike I don't think life is\nfair right I can't see I haven't seen\nthat I mean I decided on this my first\nrotation is a thirdy year medical\nstudent I was one week into third year\nand I decided fairness is [ __ ] all you\nhave to do is spend one week in the\nPediatric ICU and you'll realize\nfairness is a waste of I don't even know\nhow this works there's a six-year-old\nkid with gly blastoma multi fori\nactually not a six-year-old patient with\nthe globas multiform me was a couple\nyears later that happens closer between\n25 and 45 years old with the kid it was\nlike a blood cancer leukemia or\nsomething right you look at this and\nyou're like how there's no fairness here\nthis is\ndumb it's\ndumb there's no\nfairness right and I'm thinking about\nthis patient with gleo blast storm well\nthey just great dude had kids was\nhappily married and it's like boom one\nday you got a terminal cancer you've got\n3 months to live like that's how gastor\ngasta multii hits you it's a rapidly\nProgressive very debilitating doesn't\nhappen when you're old happens when\nyou're young when you're in the prime of\nyour life there's no fairness\nhere but there doesn't need to be\nfairness that's the crazy\nthing right there is what you can\ncontrol and when you're looking for the\nworld to fix your\nproblems like I just have lost faith in\nthe world like I hate to say it and now\nthis is where you all have to be careful\nright because your negative bias if\nyou're depressed will be Dr K has lost\nfaith in the world which means I should\ngive up no I'm saying the exact opposite\nI've lost faith in the world but I've\nnot lost faith in\nyou there's a huge difference I don't\ncount on the World to fix anything\nthat's why I'm here because I saw a\ngeneration of people whose lives were\ngetting screwed and I was like I I don't\nknow if anyone's going to fix that in\nfact I went to people so many smart\npeople so many compassionate people so\nmany dedicated people who are doing\nnothing about technology\naddiction who doing nothing to address\nRising suicide rates Rising unemployment\nrates in young men who are doing nothing\nto address toxicity towards women online\nstalking and\ndickpics I have no faith in the world\nbut I have faith in you because this is\nall we can\ncontrol so if you see some problem in\nthe world there's once again two options\nright either I can't do something about\nthis or I can\ntry that's it those are your two\noptions and that's why I think [ __ ] life\nsyndrome can get better because I have\nworked with people to address these\ncognitive biases and we have moved from\nthere is nothing I can do about this to\nI can try\nand the really sad thing is that even\nwhen circumstances improve it doesn't\nalways lead to better\noutcomes so I see this a lot it's really\nsad with my patients who have been so if\nyou look at uh women who have a history\nof abuse growing up imagine this is true\nof men but I'm more familiar with the\nresearch on women so if you look at\nwomen who are abused in the household\nthey're more likely to be abused in\nromantic relationships\nI think something like one in Six Women\nwill be sexually or raped actually so\neven sexual assault could be higher\nintimate partner violence 30.7% of women\nwith ADHD are likely to have intimate\npartner violence this is a staggering\nnumber and if you look at this like this\nis\nbad and the problem why does this happen\nwhy is it that if you were abused once\nyou are likely to be abused again is it\nbecause the world is rigged against you\nno this is the really crazy\nthing it is because of the way that you\nengage in relationships when you have a\nlow\nself-esteem see when you have a high\nself-esteem and someone mistreats you\nyou leave the relationship but when you\nare dependent when your goal is survival\nnot\nthriving then you are willing to\ntolerate\nabuse it's a completely different way of\nlooking at the world what's the goal and\nin [ __ ] life syndrome the goal is\nsurvival not\nthriving thatat all kinds of problems it\nkeeps our life in this weird limbo zone\nof not actually ending right like we're\nstruggling along we're kind of chugging\nalong but we're never getting anywhere\nwe're not quitting the race because once\nagain I had a brilliant patient who who\ntaught me this who tried to commit\nsuicide seven\ntimes and I was like do I need to be\nworried about you and he's like no I was\nlike help me understand brilliant guy\nand he said well the seventh time I\nrealized that that like some part of me\ndoes not want to die I've been trying to\nkill myself and something within me is\nfighting for life so I'm going to stop\nfighting that thing and that's all it\ntook for him no more\nsuicidality right so there's something\nwithin you even if you feel like\neverything is like lost and whatever\nthere's something within you that\nstrives we look at this post and here I\nam [ __ ] bashing this person man woman\nI don't know right I'm saying oh look at\nthis cognitive bias but I want to point\nout pay attention to something this\nperson\nposted this person is trying to change\nthis person is saying my my life is\nunsolvable nothing's ever going to end\nup anywhere and they're not taking it\nlaying down this is a huge prognostic\nsign in the right direction this is a\nwin the post may be full of negativity\nbut the fact that there is a post is a\nwin and this is our bias right so now\nwhat I want yall to do is if you're\nlistening to this if you've been\nlistening to this did you consider that\nand if the answer is no why not this is\nbias so [ __ ] life syndrome is not\ndeterministic I do not believe that is\nthe deck sacked against you absolutely\ncan we count on the World to fix things\nI don't\nknow big question mark the world isn't\nall bad by the way it's a lot of good in\nthe\nworld right but what I have faith in is\ny'all I have faith that if you\nunderstand the way that you function if\nyou understand what your biases are if\nyou understand the way that you view the\nworld determine some of the way that the\nworld\nis then you can change your life can\nchange and I've seen it time and time\nand time and time and time again right\nthis isn't Dr K being\noptimistic my optimism is based off of\nskepticism by the way it's like you know\nit's like I saw bad [ __ ] and I saw bad\n[ __ ] and I saw bad [ __ ] and I saw people\nand this is what's beautiful about being\na psychiatrist you see all these people\npeople were like you know my parents\nwere even like aren't you going to go\ncrazy dealing with crazy people all the\ntime there's so much negativity there's\nso much trauma and it's like no actually\nit's really it's gratifying work it's\nlike you see triumphs of the human\nspirit this isn't like winning first\nplace in your karate competition this is\nlike this person was addicted to heroin\nfor 30 not 30 years like 16\nyears and now they're like happily\nmarried they have a kid they're sober\nthey have a job they're like it can\nhappen like you see this and I remember\nasking my mom the same question I was\nlike she's a pediatrician and I was like\nhow do you not get depressed from like\nseeing all these kids get sick and she's\nlike the nice thing about kids is that\nthey get better they're still growing so\nif they have some devastating injury\nlike their brain is still in a formation\nphase if they have brain damage their\nbrain is still quite plastic and their\nbrain is literally growing something bad\nhappens to an adult like they don't they\ndon't fix the same way\nthere's a lot of Hope there really is\nand I I think this is like quite doable\nlike I don't think [ __ ] life syndrome is\ninsurmountable there are absolutely\nsystemic problems but there are personal\nfactors\ntoo and that's the thing to to remember\nright so as a living organism you are in\na homeostatic relationship with your\nenvironment your environment is sending\nyou certain signals but you can shape\nyour environment I can change my\nfurniture I can change my appearance I\ncan change the way that I talk to people\nI can change the way that I act\nI can exert a lot of change on my\nenvironment and the four things to keep\nin mind are first of all can do you have\nany capacity of self-determination work\non\nthat second thing is ask for help right\nand your mind may tell you this is a\nwaste of time it's okay for it to tell\nyou that then the right response is that\nhas been true in the past but it may not\nbe true in the future if y'all are fans\nof stons you know that there is this\nphrase that past performance is not an\nindicator of future\nreturn the past doesn't determine the\nfuture you have some role to\nplay be super careful about jumping to\nconclusions the harder your conclusions\nare the worse off you will be and the\nlast thing is try to regain your future\norientation okay\nso I think there's a couple things let's\ntalk about this because I kind of\nskipped this early I guess it's a good\ntime actually now that I think about\nit um so we launched our trauma guide\ntoday and if if a lot of y'all are\nwondering okay but how do I do\nthat so the reason we build guides is\nanytime there is a long or detailed\nthing like regain your future\norientation for example like some of\nthese weird abstract things that are\nlike very difficult to you're like how\ndo I do that so we tried to share some\nof that stuff with y'all today but\nespecially when we're talking about\nshift I Sy Drome we're going to give you\nall we're going to talk dig into it more\nbut the challenge is that not everything\ncan be like summed up in like with some\nanswer in a 15minute like end of the\nlecture here's what you do to fix it\nlike I just it doesn't work like that\nlike I'm sorry to say right so I can\nmake like a video or make a stream about\nhow to gain\nMMR hi and then like it's not like\ngaining MMR is like 15 minutes at the\nend of the lecture so what we've done is\nin the trauma guide we actually have\num right so this is really important\nlike overcoming paralysis of initiation\nand causes of paralysis of\ninitiation\num let me see if I\ncan can't click it GG Get Wrecked to no\nwhere is future\norientation so paralysis of initiation\nand overcoming paralysis of initiation\nor about some of these things like\nfuture orientation and like literally\nwhat happens in the in the mind in the\nbrain what the traumatic adaptation is\nand hopefully some exercises to try to\nundo that you want to say\nsomething okay I have to go in order GG\nokay so this is our trauma guide um just\nto give you all a kind of a quick\noverview so we've got so like the way\nthat we understand this is once you\nso the remember we were talking about\nthis\nhomeostatic relationship with your\nenvironment where your environment\nshapes you and in my experience with\nwith trauma like primarily as a\nclinician is that the challenges that\nyou get wired in a particular way that\nstarts with your physiology and then can\neven result in things like there are\ncertain somatic\nillnesses um that correlate with trauma\nthings like chronic fatigue syndrome\nfibromyalgia like all these weird things\nthat don't have like medical cures like\nit's all trauma related so how can you\nunderstand that stuff there's some\namount of physiologic rewiring\nincreasing emotional awareness right so\nwhen we went back to this concept of\npassion like I don't feel\npassion right there's there's nothing\nthat I can get myself passionate about\nso then the question is why so there's\nemotional awareness and emotional\nnumbness understanding your emotions\nunderstanding paralysis of initiation\nunderstanding things like\nprocrastination even understanding\nimpulsivity so a lot of the\nself-sabotage that we do is due to\nimpulsivity um so that's just one track\nof the trauma guide then we have\nrelationship track this is one of my\nfavorites um so there's stuff about like\npersonality what your sense of identity\nis so there's other things here where if\nyou look at this you know people have\nthis idea of I am unsuccessful I am\nscrewed I can't do anything you know\nlike I've been thinking about seeing a\npsychiatrist but I have my doubts a\npsychiatrist won't be able to help me\nthere are a lot of eye statements that\nwe have to be super careful about so how\ndoes trauma shape our identity and how\ncan we reshape it so we know that\nnarrative is an\neffective tool to reshape your identity\neven things like post-traumatic growth\nso we know that trauma can have\nbeneficial effects on people but the\nquestion is how so we dig into that\nwe've done a a stream about\npost-traumatic growth as well by the way\nthen we talk about relationships right\nso and the reason that it's organized\nlike this is that your relationships or\nrelationship is something between you\nand someone else so your relationship\nhas to do with your\nidentity and the reason that we or\norganize the guide like this is because\nif you want successful relationships you\nneed a healthy sense of\nidentity and so like it's kind of built\non itself and then healthy sense of\nidentity for example comes from the\nintegration of emotional experiences so\nas long as you're numb it's hard to form\na healthy identity integration of\nemotional experiences involve some\ndegree of calming down your nervous\nsystem so everything kind of Builds on\nitself and then we even have some fun\nones like you know I do a lot of This\nresearch um and uh sometimes like I find\nthese really interesting papers but I\ndon't know how to turn it into a\nrelation like I don't know how to turn\nit into like a\nlecture so like there's a lot of like\nresearch on sex and attachment style and\nrelationships right and sometimes we'll\nlike talk about like even I see some of\nthis stuff in like the the alpha red\npill Community or if you look at the\nscience of relationships hi hi I'm just\nhi guys I'm just here to help answer any\nquestions if you have technical issues\nso if we have uh so it's interesting\nbecause if you look at sex sex is\nutilized in relationships in different\nways so if you have an anxious\nattachment\nstyle sex is used to pull someone into\nthe relationship to\nintensify the connection in the\nrelationship right so I feel\ndisconnected to you let's have sex so\nthat I can feel\nloved if you have a secure attachment\nstyle sex is an expression of the\nemotional connection it is not a tool to\nenhance the emotional connection I feel\nsuper connected with you so let's have\nsex is an expression of that really\ninteresting thing is if you have an\navoidant attachment style sex is used to\nkeep emotions at\nBay so sex is utilized to prevent the\nconnection of emotion so sex becomes\nsomething purely physical there's no\nemotion there's no love we are actually\ngoing to sex is become the opposite of\nlove so these are like research studies\nthat that you know I run across but like\nthere's no I I don't know like how to\nturn that into a lecture so sometimes\nthe stuff is floating around and what I\nlike about the trauma guide is it gives\nme like an excuse to talk about some of\nthese really interesting Concepts so\nwe'll talk about attachment Theory we've\ndone lectures on it and things like that\nbut what I really like about it is you\ncan't do that lecture without people\nunderstanding identity relationships and\nand attachment Theory so it it's fun to\nmake guides because we get to like go\ninto like more of the detailed\ninteresting\nstuff um and then I'm super hyped about\nthis so we also talk about goo we're\ngoing to talk about that some today this\nvideo by the way I think is like\nabsolutely\nrevolutionary changed the way that I\nview my life more than anything else so\nwe think about Karma as a external thing\nmy actions have consequences I reap what\nI\nsow I'm now convinced that 99% of our\nkarma is in our mind the way that I\nallow my mind to think determines so so\nmuch about my\nfuture and that's kind of what we see\nwith like these papers right that are\nthe way we\nthink heavily influences what happens in\nour life but we don't control our\nthinking in fact what's going on is the\nopposite is happening we are losing\ncontrol of our thinking the more that\nwe're leaning into like apps and other\nkinds of like social media and stuff\nlike that other people are sh are\nshaping our thinking more and more and\nmore and more and more\nright there people who are and you can\nlook at this in like political see this\nin political uh Echo Chambers we see\nthis in gender Dynamics like other\npeople are shaping the way that we see\nthe world we're not in control of our\nthoughts anymore and once we lose\ncontrol of our thoughts we lose control\nof our actions we lose control of our\nmotivations we lose control of our\ndestiny so a lot of karma is\nmental um we also the other cool thing\nabout um\nguides is that we have a bunch of\nresources so you know as part of\nlike understanding like emotions and\nimproving your emotional awareness we've\ngot tools like this\num growing stronger from trauma so like\nthis is what's really interesting but we\nhave like narrative we have a lot of\nstuff a lot of research around identity\nnarrative post-traumatic growth and what\nwe've tried to do is like\ngo through a process to make this easy\nfor yall to access so the cool thing\nabout the guide is that we can do this\nkind of thing this is hard to do like\nwhen we're streaming like it's like okay\nlike let's take I mean I guess we could\ntry this but I imagine most people would\nleave if we're like all right class\nwe're going to work on our worksheets\nfor 15 minutes right I think that\ndoesn't work so this some of this stuff\nis like really self-paced\nlearning um does that make\nsense okay\nyeah and and so here's something to\nunderstand about\nworksheets so the way that so what we\nknow about change is that change\nrequires manipulation of\ninformation and spacing and repetition\nso if you want to learn something if you\nbelieve you are something and you want\nto be something else even identity\nchange is still responds to the basic\nhuman learning circuitry so what we want\nis\nmanipulation of information so you need\nto play around with it if Dr K tells you\nthat you're a good person that doesn't\nthat's not going to make you a good\nperson you need to challenge that you\nneed to play with that information and\nthen you need to repeat it you need time\nfor it to digest and that's what\nworksheets really do so like the whole\npoint is you watch a video and then like\neven that day or the next day like you\nrevisit that information with something\nlike a worksheet that's been shown to\nenhance learning enhance change really\nlet those Concepts solidify which is\nwhat we're trying to do here right is\nlike help y all actually\nchange instead of talking to y'all about\nchanging\num okay so I wanted to congratulate Alo\nand the whole healthy gamer team on the\ntrauma module you've been working on it\nfor like two years so I'm really proud\nof you and I'm really proud of our team\non everything they've built as you can\nsee there's so much more than just all\nlook sitting in front of a camera and\nfilming this um there's so much work\nthat goes on behind the scenes from\nresearch to UI to\ndesigners editors producers script\nwriters so so so so much work so it's\nabout two years in the making I really\nreally really hope it helps all\nhas really kind of poured his heart and\nsoul into this so\ncongrats yeah so speaking of thank you\nyou're\nwelcome right so I I know that's that's\nhypers and poggers but it's weird but I\nfeel a slight amount of discomfort when\nwe talk like\nthat right cuz it's like it feels like\noh like we shouldn't be celebrating all\nthis hard work that we're doing yall\nknow what I mean like it feels like\noh what yeah it's it's that's the thing\nthat's what we talk about right I I re\nI'm just pointing out that that's the it\nshould be celebrated I'm just sharing an\ninstinctive reaction what that you're\nuncomfortable very mildly we don't have\nto talk about it\nthat's okay yeah I I feel good about it\navoidance so so it's I I feel good about\nwhat it is right but even the even the\npraise component is like makes me mildly\nuncomfortable it's I'm not praising you\nI know you should praise your team my\nteam is awesome I I they're great\nthey're the ones that built that yeah\nthey did mod went through all the videos\nI know I saw that I saw that so this is\nwhat's super cool is like when gruy\nsaying that this is like a whole team\neffort this isn't Dr K so you know we\nhad tons of people QA this stuff our\nmods QA everything everyone watched\nthese videos they built these worksheets\nthere's a lot of research that went into\nit um I don't know if you guys can tell\nbut this is\nuh hold on one second\num so this too like this was developed\nby our devs like this is super cool like\nyou can see that this has like three\nmeditation videos you know this is one\nmeditation video it links to other\nthings so I don't know if you guys can\nsee this but now we're getting like\nsuper this is like synergies\nokay this is super cool like there's an\narrow here wait where does this Arrow\ncome from this comes from here\ninteresting emotional awareness\nphysiologic rewiring reconnects to all\nthe way down here physiologic\nanxiety so like I don't know if you'll\nget this but this is becoming orders of\nmagnitude more complicated like the way\nthat all of the this stuff stitches\ntogether is crazy and like it it's a\ndesign it's a work of design Brilliance\nwhich I didn't\nmake but it's a skill yeah so someone's\nsaying skill tree so like literally what\nwe try to do with the guide is make a\nskill tree for\nlife it's like these this is the skill\ntree for\nIRL that's what it\nis right we don't know exactly how\neffective it is but that's what we're\ntrying to do and people may say but\nthat's not\npossible\nremember just because it hasn't been\ndone yet does not mean that it is not\npossible okay where's the Parry skill I\ndon't see it I will find you the Parry\nskill so this is the basics of\nparrying okay um let me see what else is\nwhere is perception\nH let me see if I can find yall see\ngetting overwhelmed\nparrying\nparrying\nparrying also parrying these are all\nparrying and if you guys want to play a\nfun game what we can do is y'all can\nlike give me y'all can ask me questions\nand I will show you where that exists so\nif we think about\nparrying in real life what is the what\ndoes it mean to Parry in real life a\nParry is an avoidance of damage right\nit's someone attacks you and you knock\nit\nback\nso paring in real life is a combination\nof two or three things the first is\nbeing careful about your perception so\nwhen someone calls me stupid does that\nsink into me and become truth in here or\nam I able to reject it just because you\nthink I'm stupid does not mean I'm\nstupid the second thing about pairing is\nonce I let it in I have an emotional\nreaction so being able to identify and\nprocess my emotions is basically the\nequivalent of of parrying so I would say\nthat parrying in the real world is a\ncombination of perception and emotional\nmanagement that's what parrying\nis so when someone's saying I thought\npairing was redirect\nthat\ntoo so here's a cool video from our\ntrauma guide oh interesting oh God\npost-traumatic growth right this is when\nyou so this is like post-traumatic\ngrowth is like not just the Parry but\nthe repost or repost I don't know how to\npronounce it right it's like the\nCounterattack so it's like I'm going to\nParry and then I'm going to counter\nha that's what post-traumatic growth is\nit's like you try tried to damage me but\nactually you're the one who got crit Get\nWrecked shitties like that's what's cool\nlike it's crazy like I'm I'm really\nconvincing myself now that like I I I\nthink it's some like I think video games\nhave everything that we need to know\nabout life I'm really starting to\nbelieve this the analogies are getting\nlike too\nrealistic like as video games are\nbecoming more realistic like I'm\nbeginning to see more and more of like\nthese psychological principles\neverything can be reduced to a video\ngame character builds RNG spawn Dunning\nKrueger and MMR I can't control my\nteammates oh yeah I have shitty\nteammates does that mean I'm going to\nstay at low rank oh I have bad\ncircumstances does that mean that I'm\nscrewed in\nlife careful careful\nnow right it's really weird and like\nwhat I really think is interesting about\nthis is like from a karmic\nperspective so there's when I was okay\nnow story from\nIndia so one time I was talking to one\nof my my teachers about\nKarma and so I was in a class in an\nasham and so I was talking to an a\nfellow\nstudent and I was like hey what do you\nthink about this Karma stuff and he was\nlike I can't get behind any doctrine\nthat says that if someone was sexually\nassaulted it's their fault and I was\nlike damn that is a really good argument\nagainst Karma because I don't think I\ncan get behind that either and\nespecially as a clinician like it's\nweird right so like there's some\narguments that you have something to do\nwith being sexually assaulted but I've\nseen people who really didn't ask for it\nor anything like that right there's it's\nabsurd so I that I was really skeptical\nfor of of karma for a very long time for\nthat\nreason what was I saying I lost my train\nof thought that's o Bleak way to end\nwithout something\npositive oh\nyeah so it was interesting but I was\ntalking to one of my teachers and and he\nsort of said you know like bad stuff\nhappens in life but it's this person's\nbelief right so he's not saying this is\nobjectively correct but he was saying\nthat you know I believe that people are\nit's not that bad stuff doesn't happen\nbut I believe that people are given the\ntools to manage the Badness that's the\nway that I view life and so when I look\nat all this like everything going wrong\nin the world right like our brains are\nbeing programmed by social media there's\nlike climate change there's people who\ndon't believe in climate climate change\nlike fair enough you know think it's\nokay to believe whatever you want you\nknow we have like all these different\nthings going on politically and like\nthere's inflation across the world and\nlike we have record levels of uh young\nmen not entering the workforce we have\nhigh levels of suicidality everything\nseems\n[ __ ] but we've got games and I think\nthat some of our answers to this like\nhorribly terrible world in the world\nthat we live in even things like Co so\nGamers were resilient to the increases\nin depression in anxiety for the first\nyear of Co because we were okay being\nonline we're like okay this is not that\ndifferent I'm resilient to these this is\nthis is like Darwin's finches there's\nsome kind of environmental pressure and\nsome of us are already built to\nsurvive so I really do think we have\nwhat it takes to make this work it's a\nview that I choose to adopt I'm not\nsaying that things are bad aren't bad\nthey're bad they're very bad things are\nvery bad but I think that we have\nunseen advantages we have some trait\nthat is viewed as a debuff which in some\ncircumstances can be incredibly op and\nthat's what like Darwin's theory of\nevolution is right it's like this benign\nthing turns out to be adapted this by\nthe way is how we ended up with CLE cell\ndisease youall know this there's\nsomething called CLE cell disease which\ncan be really terrifying and people\ncan't they their their blood cells can't\nhold oxygen in the same way and they\nsometimes need blood transfusions and\nthings like that and it's like man that\nsucks why would people be like this\nturns out that being being heterozygous\nfor Cle cell the CLE cell trait makes\nyou resistant to malaria right which is\nwhy we see CLE cell disease more often\nin people who come from have genetic\norigins in Africa because that's where\nthere's a lot of malaria so it's like we\nhave a lot of these adaptations which we\ndon't realize what the value of them are\nand I think really a using video games\nis like a almost like the Bible of the\nmodern day like all the lessons we need\nto learn if you can learn it in a video\ngame you can learn it you can live it\nlife my favorite is that MMR is\ndetermined by my teammates or rank is\ndetermined by my teammates it's like\nhold on a second I don't know if your\ncircumstances actually determine your\nlife\nokay um all\nright\nso enough pontificating chat we've got\nother things to talk\nabout\nokay now let's address some even more\nchallenging\ncritiques I've seen a post about [ __ ]\nlife syndrome immediately known I should\nlet it all out because [ __ ] life\nsyndrome as it seems is just the most\nobvious side of the underlying\ncontradictions within the world of\nmental health advice care both\nprofessional and community- based if a\nperson is feeling down because they need\nto care for four children while working\non exhausting shifts just to make ends\nmeet the most bullet bulletproof\nsolution for their problems isn't to\ntake a course of ssris and challenge\ntheir core beliefs with journaling it's\na goddamn living wage and paid leaves\nthat's it obviously neither a therapist\nnot a support group can provide it\nthat's fair what seems unfair even\ncynical at times is that saying is that\ninstead of saying that sucks man let's\ntry to adapt to your objectively shitty\nsituation their answer is often\nsomething about changing a negative\nworld view in some cases it looks\nbasically like gaslighting a\nclient it might seem like an extreme\nexample but take a look at the hottest\ntopic over here a lonely short balding\nautistic man is objectively heavily\ndisadvantaged on the dating scene\nrecognizing this disadvantage and\nfeeling bad about it is the only natural\nand I dare say healthy is is only\nnatural and I dare to say healthy but\nwhat's the widespread answer again it's\nall in your head see that fat man in the\ngrocery store with with a wife just hit\nthe gym and talk to girls and if it\ndoesn't work out be content with your\nyourself is it entirely wrong no many\nmen indeed find love while looking\nnothing like Brad Pit and you indeed can\nbe happy when alone just like some\npeople are happy in trailer parks and\nsome of them can win a lottery one day\nit doesn't imply that living in a\ntrailer park is dope and buying lottery\ntickets is a good Financial\nstrategy I honestly feel the irony while\nsaying this because I'm uh three months\ninto the relation I honestly feel the\nirony while saying this because now I'm\n3 months into the relationship with a\nnice and cute woman after years of being\nskeptical about it if I could ever get\none on paper I should be a poster child\nof you can make it yet I understand\nthat's a rather happy coincidence than\nthan a\nnorm all of it REM reminds me again\nabout depressive realism the phenomenon\nwhen people with diagnosed depressive\ndisorders are statistically better at\nrealistically predicting the outcomes\nthan their healthy counterpart Parts I\ncan't help wondering whether it is\nindeed depression\nspeaking or those people are just\ncrushed by seeing the objective reality\nclearly and the more that I think of it\nthe more I ask myself is yet another\npost about how therapy or working on\nyourself will inevitably open a path to\na Wonder fulfilling future really\nhelpful or is it rather deceiving don't\nget me wrong therapy does help support\ncommunities are a good thing but are\nthere limitations really spoken of and\nit goes even further than just being\nhonest about life being unfair we speak\nabout being true to yourself treating\nyourself with compassion ditching\ninternalized expectations for\nauthenticity and being independent from\ncraving external validation honestly I\nfeel much more compassion from myself\nwhen I'm lying down after eating a pizza\nthan when I'm running on a treadmill\nafter lifting\nweights the main reason I do the latter\nis because I feel I care about feeling\nmasculine which in the end boils down to\na societal expectations saying that I do\nthat just for other people's validation\nwould be an exaggeration but so is\nsaying that I do it entirely for myself\nI know that because during Co isolation\nI felt fine looking at my slightly\nrounded belly and I'm sure for 99% of\npeople it's pretty much the same\nokay um another example is good-hearted\nplatitudes about chasing your dreams\ninstead of giving up cool I could try to\nbecome a rock star in the age of Spotify\nor I could pursue a woman I was madly in\nlove with who would never reciprocate\nfor a dozen reasons oh I see that's\nunrealistic however if I'd say that\ngoals of successfully building a\nthriving business from scratch or\nbecoming a woman magnet while being 56\nare also of negligible probability for\nmost I'm suddenly being negative and\ninterfering with people's dreams so\nwhere's the line between accepting and\ngiving up who's to judge no coherent\nanswers\ngiven life is unfair pain is is\ninevitable definitions of normaly are\noften fluid and arbitrary to an extent\nand people are free to adjust their\ndecisions when they feel like it if we\nagree with that do we really need to\nsugarcoat it could we spare ourselves\nsome frustration if we were honest about\nexpectation management accepting the\nlimitations without falling for Doomer\nmindset being humble and realistic\nwithout forsaking life together striving\nfor contentment without expecting to be\nunbelievably happy is it possible to\nconvey is it possible to convey within\nmental health framework I'm not sure\nthat's necessarily therapeutic but I\ncan't ignore the feeling that's\nultimately the right thing to\ndo so I I love this post\ncuz like this is a great\nanalysis\nokay\nso I love it because they're like I\nrecognized the irony of I was someone\nwho is very skeptical of being in a\nrelationship and now I've been in one\nfor three\nmonths and they kind of say like hey can\nwe accept without giving up can we\nacknowledge that things are hard can we\nsay that like we need to manage our\nexpectations and you can't shoot for the\nstars and I think yeah and then like\nwhat's this deal with depressive realism\nI think it's fantastic so the first\nthing that I want youall to notice this\nis\nNuance it is not one way or the other\nway remember when we were talking\nabout [ __ ] life syndrome and what it\ntakes to move from [ __ ] life\nsyndrome to putting together your life\nwe have to move away from jumping to\nconclusions we have to move away from\nblack and white thinking we have to move\naway from a deterministic\nfuture and that's exactly what we see\nhappening with this\nperson right we don't know how long\nthey've been in the community maybe they\njust showed up but hey I have a crazy\nthought maybe they just showed up and\nthey got lucky but maybe something that\nwe're doing is\nworking maybe and I I by the way\ncompletely agree with this person a\ncouple of things that I disagree with\nbut I think this is\ngreat this is this is what you should do\nright we can acknowledge that life is\nhard we can acknowledge that we have\nsome dreams that may be out of our reach\nand we can still shoot for them we can\nacknowledge that the reason that we go\nto the gym is to live up to a masculine\nideal but it doesn't have to be that way\nforever so now what we're going to talk\nabout is a couple things that this\nperson talks about so we're going to\ntalk about depressive\nrealism and we're going to talk about\nhow do you move from [ __ ] life syndrome\nwhen things are objectively bad to being\nsuccessful and happy there's a\nprocess okay so let's start with\ndepressive\nrealism this person\nsays all of it reminds me again and\nagain about depressive realism the\nphenomenon that when people with\ndiagnosed depressive disorders are\nstatistically better at realistically\npredicting the outcomes rather than\ntheir healthy counterparts so we've\ntalked about some types of cognitive\nbiases in the negative form so people\nwith depression are less likely in some\ncases to judge the world\naccurately but there is this concept of\ndepressive\nrealism okay which is this idea that\npeople who are\ndepressed are better at judging the\naccuracy of events so we also have\nstudies that high\nintelligence this impc Ates that high IQ\nas being a potential risk factor for\naffective disorders ADHD autism spectrum\ndisorder and for increased incidence of\ndis disease related to immune regulation\nthat's\nfascinating right and if we look at\ndepressive\nrealism\num\nso this is a a a study that's looking\nthis is a review it's older there's more\nrecent articles on depressive realism\nbut there's this concept that if you\nlook at human beings who are depressed\nthey are better at judging their real\nworld\nchances okay so this is what's really\nweird so depressive realism so if you\nare more intelligent you are more likely\nto be depressed and there are some\nstudies that show that if you are\ndepressed you are more likely to\naccurately judge what is going on in the\nworld around you so there a couple of\nweird things about this so does that\nmean that if I am a Doomer and I and I\nam depressed and I see the world as\nnegative I I'm objectively correct so\nisn't that good to be objectively\ncorrect so now we have to understand a\ncouple of principles so this is a great\nexample\nof losing the forest for the\ntrees so if we look at human\nbeings do you think that we have\nadapted to be\naccurate judges of reality so the crazy\nthing about the human organism is that\nthe ideally functioning human organism\nis somewhat divorced from reality we are\nnot designed we are not\ncalibrated to be in touch with reality\nwe are actually calibrated to be out of\ntouch with reality we have all kinds of\nintrinsic healthy by biases that allow\nus to succeed in the world because we\nare not connected with reality this is a\ngood thing not a bad thing give you all\nsome\nexamples so first is people buy lottery\ntickets why because we all have this\nbias that we think bad things won't\nhappen to us and we are better than\naverage right there's like this better\nthan average bias this is not reality\nthis is a divorce from reality we also\nknow that human beings don't think\nprobabilistically in terms of bad\noutcomes so if I go to a restaurant and\nI eat there nine times and I don't get\nfood poisoning if I go a tenth\ntime and I get food poisoning I won't go\nback to that restaurant even though the\nlikelihood of food poisoning is only 10%\nI'm divorced from reality and all of my\nreality will be shaped by this one\nnegative event this is a not a bug this\nis a\nfeature so the first thing to understand\nabout depressive realism is that you may\nbe more in tune with reality that's true\nbut we're not we start\nmalfunctioning when we are in tune with\nreality which is crazy to think about so\nwe also know that for example we have\nnarcissistic defense\nmechanisms and why do all human beings\nhave narcissistic defense mechanisms\nbecause narcissistic defense mechanisms\nare an Adaptive\nAdvantage instead of seeing the world as\nit is we need some part of our brain to\nbe able to be narcissistic to see the\nworld in a a favorable\nlight so not seeing the world as it is\nis also really important for\nprocreation being able to ignore red\nflags is how we make\nbabies so this is really wild and this\neven goes to the core of our uh\nneurological functions so what a lot of\npeople don't realize is that our eyes\nactually see I'm pretty sure I'm right\nabout this see an inverted image of what\nwe perceive\nso our eyes are actually flipped upside\ndown and like right to left and things\nlike that our brain\nprocesses the actual input even\nsomething as simple as our\neyes are are actually like they're\nmanufactured we don't perceive reality\nwe we do this weird thing in our brain\nwhere we flip things upside down and you\ncan even give someone inverted glasses\nwhere if they wear glasses that flip the\nworld upside down if they wear those\nglasses for an extended period of time\nour brain will adapt and we flip things\nright side up and if you want to see\nsomething really interesting we\nliterally have blind spots so you can do\nthis so hold your hold your finger out\nin front of you put the second finger\nover\nhere okay oh hold on close one\neye yeah okay so this is what you should\ndo close the right eye have two fingers\nout in front of you and look with your\nleft eye both of the fingers and then\nwhat we're going to do we're going to\nmove our left finger over here keep\nlooking at this keep looking at this\nfinger and move this finger and what\nyou'll see is right about here you can\nif you're looking over here you can no\nlonger see this finger this finger will\ndisappear this one will disappear if\nyou're looking at this one with this\neye you literally have a blind spot in\nyour eyes this is where your retina is\nthere are no photo receptors there\nokay we'll do this again so hold your\nfingers out in front of you right finger\nleft finger close your right eye look at\nyour right finger with your left eye\nthis eye is looking at this finger and\nnow we're going to move this over here\nuntil it disappears there'll be a spot\nright around here this finger will\ndisappear as long as you're looking at\nthis one and it's [ __ ]\nweird so our\nbrain generates like an artificial\nintelligence it generates an image of\nreality that is not real this is not a\nbug this is a\nfeature so the reason that depressive\nrealism is bad is because removing our\ncognitive bias for the positive is\nactually\nmaladaptive so what we try to do is\nrestore with people who are depressed we\nactually try to restore their\ndisconnection from\nreality this is wild but that's true so\nbeing tuned into the real world is not\nhealthy for human\nbeings now there's another really\nimportant thing to\nunderstand so depressive realism in some\nways is real but we also know that there\nare negative cognitive biases so there\nare some things that we distort in the\nwrong direction and basically this is\nreally important to understand about\ndepressive realism\nokay\num so studies examining subject recall\nof self-evaluative information indicate\nthat non-depressed subjects are more\naccurate so what is this\nmean so depressive realism may make you\nbetter at judging the outside world but\nit makes you bad at judging\nyourself your capacity for self\nevaluation is even more\ndistorted so what this means is that\nwhen you look at a depressed\nindividual when they judge their cap\nability in the world it is actually even\nmore distorted so they're not realistic\nthis is what where you have to look at\nthe science right so we can have this\ndepress realism oh people who are\ndepressed perceive reality better than\nnormal people but it's not\nuniform they misjudge some certain\nthings and they judge other things more\naccurately and their biggest misjudgment\nis of themselves this is not accurate so\nnow when we see all these posts about oh\nI'm going to be alone\nforever right this is based on\nself-evaluation\nso evaluation of the self in depression\nis more distorted so if you're depressed\nor you have a very negative perception\nof yourself there's a good chance that\nthis is not an accurate perception good\nchance we don't know deterministically\nthough I mean you could be right right\nthese are studies that look at\npopulations and stuff like that some\ndepressed people may be\naccurate and we know this so a feature\nof of you know one of the diagnostic\nfeatures of a mood disorder that has\ndepressive episodes is something called\nnegative self attitude so the ability to\nevaluate yourself is\nimpaired so when this person is kind of\nsaying like Okay [ __ ] life syndrome is\nthere you know people like there's\npeople who have objective\ndisadvantages what's the point in sugar\ncoating it I don't think we're sugar\ncoating it or at least I'm not I don't\nthink but what we're also not doing is\nlike bitter coding it right because both\nhappen so I think the right way to look\nat your life is that there are some\nthings that you're at a disadvantage of\nand there are some things you can do\nabout it now the reason that we do a lot\nof this self-help advice right focus on\nyourself why do we do that there are two\nthings to understand the first is I kind\nof agree with this person that's why I\nstarted HG instead of doing just\nclinical work all the time so even the\nreason we developed a coaching program\nincluding things like a Creator coaching\nprogram and career coaching program is I\nwas here on the internet for a while\ntrying to help y'all out and what was a\nconclusion that I came to I came to a\nconclusion that fixing your mind or\ngoing to therapy is not sufficient to\nimprove your life or is not the most\nefficient way to improve your life that\npeople need help increasing their\nexternal outcomes they need help\nimproving their\ncircumstances right they do need help\ngetting jobs and things like that and we\nhad our our you know we had data from\nour creator program analyzed by an\norganization called stream Hatchet a\nthird party analysis of our data and\npeople who went through our creator\ncoaching\nprogram had a\n171% increase in follower in sub count\nover I think a three-month period\ncompared to\naverage without increasing the number of\nhours that they\nstreamed so we saw objective\noutcomes without an increase of\neffort via focusing on the self right so\nthey our our coaches work with a creator\nthey help them understand themselves\nbetter but the goal is to actually\nimprove your external life that's why we\nhave coaching it's not just about going\nto a therapy and you know we don't do\nthat and just healing your traumas it's\nabout how can I change this instrument\nto make positive in outcomes in my\nlife that's why we went that road like\nthat's why we did it because I\ncompletely agree that the field of\ntherapy one of my biggest gripes with\nthe field in general this is thankfully\nchanging a lot of good therapists out\nthere aren't like this but therapists\nhave stopped taking responsibility for\nthe outcomes of their patients in some\nDimensions we'll take responsibility for\nclinical\noutcomes but if someone comes in and\nsays can you help me find a boyfriend or\ngirlfriend often times therapists will\nnot attach themselves to that outcome we\nget scared but good ones will they'll\nsay if that's a goal of yours we'll\nabsolutely shoot for it for\nit so I think that this is like a\ncompletely valid take\nand I don't think it's sugarcoating it\nto acknowledge the reality of your\nsituation now here's the really\nimportant thing to understand see if\nyour situation is objectively\nbad this is what's really\nwild the worse your situation is the\nmore internal work you need to do\nbecause a lot of people will say but if\nmy situation is bad like isn't shouldn't\nI just don't I need to fix this ituation\nthat needs to happen but internal work\nbecomes more important so if we if we\nlook at outcomes in\nlife your outcomes in life are a\ncombination of what you put in and what\nthe world gives\nyou and the less that the world gives\nyou the more that you need to put\nin this is why we emphasize personal\ngrowth so in my experience this was like\nvery simple I applied to medical school\nfor the first year got rejected from 40\nschools things were not good objectively\nI had a 2.5 GPA very hard to get into\nmed school with a 2.5 GPA I applied for\na second year in a row 40 more\nrejections 2.5 is still at 2.5 Get\nWrecked\nshitty so the worse that my\ncircumstances are the more I need to\nfocus on personal growth what can I do\nbetter what can I do better what can I\ndo better I'm going to deny these\ncircumstan I'm going to do everything\nthat I can everything that I can\neverything that can and I remember the\nday that I got accepted to med school my\ndad was in tears because he was like\nafraid that I was\n[ __ ] and he was like now that you have\nyour foot in the door nothing is going\nto stop you he's like that's you just\nneeded one break and now that you're on\neven footing that momentum that I had to\neven get my foot in the door would have\ncarried me to the top and he knew that\nat that\nday unfortunately passed away about less\nthan a year later 6 months later it\npassed away but it was good he sent gave\nme that message before he left this\nearth right and I carried it with me so\nthe the worse your life is I think the\nharder you need to work so if you're 5\nfoot6 and you're bald and you're neurod\nDivergent is the deck stacked against\nyou 100% dude that\nsucks but it's not deterministic and the\nmore you need to work because you need\nto compensate for your circumstances\nbecause you have\ndisadvantages and what's really weird is\nthis person talked about looking at the\nlottery so this is this is\ncool so what I did is looked at okay\nokay hold on a second because we do have\nwe actually have a lot of data that\nimproving people's life circumstances\ndoes improve their mental health so\nthere's a beautiful study that was done\nby I think the New York Department of\nPublic Health maybe or something I so\nthey had this program in New York called\nhousing first what used to happen is if\nyou wanted to get public housing or\nsubsidized housing from the state or\ncity you had to be sober so if you're\nsober that's a reward you get a house\nso New York realized that this is silly\nand instead what they did is they they\nstarted this program called housing\nfirst so they just gave everyone housing\nwhether you're an addict or not and what\nthey found is that when you give people\nhousing that reduces the rates of\naddiction so once you have a stable\nplace to live and you're not living on\nthe [ __ ] street it's easier to avoid\ngetting caught up in drugs then you once\nyou have a stable place to live once you\nhave an address you can apply for jobs\nbecause they're like what's your address\nand you can't fill anything out they\ncan't you know it's like you're screwed\nyou can open a bank account you can get\nmail like they really there's a lot of\ndata that shows that improving people's\ncircumstances has exponential benefits\non their mental\nhealth that's what we try to do here\nright we're not at that scale so what we\ntry to do is like teach y'all stuff like\nwe're going to do what we can with\neducation and whatnot we have this guide\nand stuff like that we're going to teach\nyall to meditate\nthis person is is not wrong that\ncircumstances are really\nimportant now the really interesting\nthing though is that circumstances plus\nhi sweetie oh my\nGod hi\nlove okay\nokay great love\nyou yes you can have that back\nokay okay love you\ndarling uh little bit love you\nbye um so where was I yes so\ncircumstances matter a lot so I I was\ncurious and so I was like well hold on a\nsecond what happens to people who win\nthe\nlottery okay like what actually\nhappens and what I found was\nfascinating okay this is like a new area\nof research for me okay so long run\neffects of Lottery wealth on\npsychological well-being\nokay so um relative to match controls\nlarge Prize winners experience sustained\nincreases in overall life satisfaction\nthat persists for over a decade and show\nno evidence of of dissipating over time\nturns out that winning the lottery like\nimproves your life now this is what's\ninteresting the estimated treatment\neffects on happiness and mental health\nare significantly\nsmaller so this is interesting so\noverall life satisfaction will increase\nbut happiness and mental health won't\nnecessarily\nincrease okay\nnow\num so mental health declines immediately\nafter winning a large Lottery prize for\nindividuals with low education and low\nlevels of financial\nliteracy\nokay\num so evidence from commonly used sf12\nmeasures of mental health indicate that\nWinners with low education experience\nincreased role limitations due to\nemotional problems are more anxious and\nhave less energy after they\nwin the impact on various measures of\nmental health is highly robust\nstatistically significant economically\nsignificant and persists for up to 2\nyears after the win unexpected windfalls\nhave no impact on mental health of\nindividuals with high education or high\nfinancial\nliteracy this is interesting now here's\nthe coolest\nstudy peers in in financial distress\nevidence from lottery winners and\nneighboring\nbankruptcies\nokay\nokay we find that dollar the dollar\nmagnitude of a lottery win of one\nneighbor increases subsequent borrowing\nand bankruptcies among other\nneighbors um we show that bankruptcy\nfilers obtain more secured but not\nunsecured debt and lenders provide\nadditional credit to lowrisk but not\nhigh-risk debtors okay so this is crazy\nso we're going to understand\nthis so a lot of people are like all I\nneed in my life is more money and money\nwould fix my problems there is evidence\nof\nthat okay there's absolutely evidence of\nthat so we have these studies like\nhousing first which are\ntransformative okay but then we also\nhave some really interesting\ndata so I want y'all to think about\nthis so if I win the lottery and you are\nmy nextd door\nneighbor you are more likely to go into\nbankruptcy and this once again is you're\na low-risk person who takes on more debt\nthan you can handle this is secured debt\nnot unsecured debt so it's not like\nbanks are making a mistake in loaning it\nto you this is\ncrazy this doesn't even the your your\nneighbor have winning the lottery\ndoesn't affect your finan position at\nall but you are more likely to become\nbankrupt if your neighbor wins the\nlottery now we all understand that\ninstinctively right cuz now your\nneighbor is [ __ ] balling they're\nbuilding a pool they're doing this\nthey're doing this and you're like I\nwant to do that\ntoo so I want youall to really think\nabout this because we're like oh just\nmoney like if I was taller things would\nbe easier right there's some evidence of\nthat\nabsolutely if I was more attractive if I\nwas richer there's some evidence that\nthat's very and there's some powerful\nevidence too but it's not quite that\nsimple throwing money at the problem\ndoes not necessarily make you more\nmentally healthy and does not\nnecessarily make you happier overall\nlife satisfaction in one study seems to\nimprove but in other studies it\ndoesn't it's weird right so now what we\nsee is that winning the lottery is also\nmitigated by your financial\nliteracy like that's crazy it increases\nemotional problems if you're financially\nilliterate and I've seen that well we\nknow that there's some like people who\nwin the lottery and then they like end\nup\nbroke so what is like what's my point\nhere my point here is that it's nuanced\nmy point here is that if we look at your\nneighbor winning the lottery how does\nthat result in you having an increased\nrisk of bankruptcy it's because of what\ngoes on in\nhere what determines whether winning the\nlottery will lead to an in increase in\nemotional distress or a lack of increase\nin emotional distress what goes on in\nhere now we're not saying that this is\n100% responsible because we did see that\none study that showed an increase in\noverall life satisfaction right we have\nthe housing first study which show that\ncircumstances\nmatter but I think we\ngrossly actually that's probably not\ntrue I was going to say we grossly\noverestimate I don't think that's true I\ntake take that statement\nback there is AB here's what I would say\nthere is absolutely an internal\ncomponent because when my neighbor wins\nthe lottery this is the only thing that\nchanges and it increases my risk of\nbankruptcy so why do we take this\napproach of oh my God we should just fix\npeople's problems and we should I don't\nknow how talking about your problems is\nhelpful\nright like why do we like sell all these\nstories of work on yourself and stuff\nlike that because that's that [ __ ]\nmatters\nman because the circumstances so this is\nwhat I want youall to understand\ncircumstances can be the\nsame but the way that you respond to\nthose circumstances can be\ndifferent what is the difference between\na failure in a setback do you get up the\nnext day and try again that's the\ndifference the circumstances are the\nsame it is your choice that\ndetermines what is the difference\nbetween stubbornness and perseverance so\nI remember after two years of applying\nto med school my uncle took me aside\nawesome person love him very much he\nloves me very much brilliant dude super\nsuper awesome dude he was like hey bro\nmaybe you should do something\nelse he like get a PhD or something like\nthis is not working for you I was\nstubborn I didn't listen to him the only\ndiffer difference between stubborn and\nperseverance is when you're still\nfailing they call you stubborn and when\nyou win in the end suddenly that\nstubbornness turns into perseverance oh\nthey're\nperseverant same quality the way we see\nthe quality is\ndifferent so there is no doubt in my\nmind that improving your external\ncircumstances will improve your\nlife the tricky thing is that in order\nto improve your circumstances there is a\npile of evidence that suggest that\nimproving your mindset correlates with\nthat we literally have studies from\npeople like Carol DW who is like if you\nchange the way that you think it will\nchange your\nperformance and the other crazy thing is\nthat in this world you cannot control\nyour circumstances you can control\nwhat's in\nhere that is why we emphasize\nthat the difference between me being\nfailing out of college and me being\nsuccessful today even if you or I would\nI would call it objectively successful I\nfeel the same the difference isn't here\nthis started to\nchange and even in this post that we see\nwhere this person is like so nuanced in\ntheir opinion and they're like I work\nout and I do this and now I'm dating and\nI like that's very nuanced right they're\nchanging you can see the change in their\nmind they're not all one\nway that's why we emphasize changing\ninternally if you're 5'6 and balding you\nyou are at a disadvantage in life that\nmeans you need to make up for\nit is that fair absolutely not but if\nyou want to achieve something in life\nyou need to work on this because you\ncan't change the fact that you're 56\nmaybe you can change the fact that\nyou're balding things you can do for\nthat right and even then I've worked\nwith people who are balding who are no\nlonger bald and for them it's like okay\nif I'm balding then I need this amount\nof money to get this kind of treatment\nand then I need to do this and then I\nneed to do this and they start banging\nthat [ __ ] out whereas some people are\nlike I'm 56 and I'm balding and like\nthere's nothing I can do about that I'm\ngoing to be alone for the rest of my\nlife that's the\ndifference the last thing that I want to\ntalk to you all\nabout so we're going to we're going to\nhit hit on the head can therapy help you\nif you have a shitty life so let's say\nthat your life is objectively pretty\nshitty right now and it's completely\noverwhelming you you don't have a job\nyou have no money you don't have a\nfamily you don't have friends you don't\nhave an intimate relationship the\nquestion for me is how is therapy even\nsupposed to help me in this case I'm\nwondering because to me it feels pretty\nnormal to be depressed anxious as a\nconsequence when your life circumstances\nare this bad so to me it feels almost\nuseless utterly useless to go see a\ntherapist when your anxiety and\ndepression symptoms are mainly caused by\nyour shitty life and unless you decide\nto try to improve it it's not going to\nget any better going to a therapist in\nthis case could kind of feel like I'm\ntrying to treat the consequences anxiety\nand depression of a terrible life no job\nno friends Etc instead of treating the\nroot cause first I don't know if I\nexplained the problem I have with\ntherapy well but what do you guys think\nabout this brilliant brilliant brilliant\nquestion where my\niPad you take it\nokay well GG Get Wrecked\nNoob\nokay so some people look at this and\nthey're like how can therapy help\nme so what we're going to do is I'm\ngoing to give youall an example of we're\ngoing to talk about what therapy does\nand then I'm going to give youall an\nexample\nof how therapy can help you if your life\nis objectively\nbad\nOkay so what do we do in\ntherapy we change the way that you\nperceive the world we change the way\nthat you react to your perceptions and\nwe focus on your thinking and your\nbeliefs we change the way that you think\nwe don't fix your\ncircumstances and so a lot of people\nwill\nsay okay but like my circumstances are\ncausing my depression so how does\nchanging my thinking help me because\nthis is not caused by\nyou know this is an appropriate\nreaction so I'm going to read out a\ncouple sentences to\ny'all okay or a couple of\noptions I got lucky versus my hard work\npaid off there's nothing I can do versus\nmaybe I can give it a\nshot it's all my\nfault or it's all someone else's fault\nversus I have some blame to take here\nI'm partially resp responsible for this\nand someone else is partially\nresponsible for\nthis chances are it won't work therefore\nI don't want to waste my time or even if\nit doesn't work I can give it a\nshot these are not changes in your\ncircumstances these are changes in your\nattitude these are changes in which the\nway that you see the\nworld that's how your circumstances\nchange\nit starts with the way that you see the\nworld so I want youall to think about I\ngot lucky versus my hard work paid off\nthis is what we try to do in therapy we\ntry to change one into the other because\nwhich which thought leads to what kind\nof action I got lucky leads to no\nreinforcement of the\naction versus my hard work paid off that\nthought incentivizes you to work hard\ntomorrow\nthere's nothing I can do incentivizes in\naction maybe I can give it a shot\nincentivizes\naction so a lot of people think that I\ndon't understand how talking about my\nproblems will help my situation whereas\nwhereas it turns out that talking about\nyour problems can help a lot because it\nchanges the way that you perceive and it\nchanges the way that you react to the\nworld and if you can change those two\nthings it will change the way that you\nact so when I work with people in\ntherapy they take chances calculated\nones they don't let their negative\nemotions control them so this is the\nother very simple thing that happens in\ntherapy I don't know if you all have\ntried to solve a problem with a clear\nhead or a cluttered head it's hard to\nsolve a problem with a cluttered\nhead and when we emotionally decompress\nit clears your head you are able to see\nthings clearly and then act\nappropriately great example of that is\nprocrastination what is procrastination\nyou should do something but you're not\nable to do it why because something in\nyour head is stopping you remove that\nthing and then you can\nact the last thing to consider is if we\nlook at this\npaper right\nso going to a therapist in this case\nwould kind of feel like treating uh\ntrying to treat the consequences of a\nterrible life instead of treating the\nroot cause first whereas if we go back\nto Randy hour boox\npaper boys who exhibited low perceived\ncontrol experienced a greater uh\noccurrence of dependent interpersonal\nstressors right so what is this paper\nsaying this paper is saying that if you\nare depressed or anxious it will create\nnegative circumstances in your life\nthere is no such thing as root cause\nroot cause is a cognitive fiction that\nour brain loves our brain loves dividing\nthings into black and white and first\nand second that's not how it works\nremember that human beings are in\nhomeostasis with their environment my\ndepression sends some signals to the\noutside world that the world responds to\nand the the outside world sends signals\nto me that shape my cognitive attitude\nit's in harmony it's a cycle it's a\ncircle this is why what we see in\ntherapy is that all boats rise together\nforget about therapy\nmedicine so when someone's physical\nhealth gets better their job gets better\nand their mental health gets better\neverything Rises\ntogether so it's not first it's not root\ncause even though what what we really\nknow is that both interventions are\nhelpful so supporting your circumstances\nand supporting your your attitude both\nare\nhelpful now the reason that we advocate\nfor more about shaping your internal\nenvironment is because the tools that we\nhave at our disposal are more geared\ntowards your internal\nenvironment I don't have a billion\ndollars to we try to do that actually so\nat the healthy gamer Foundation we've\ngiven out Second Chance\ngrants this is just giving people who\nneed some money some\nmoney I think we've done that I know\nit's been in process for a long time and\nwe had we had to get the right kind of\noversight and stuff so it took a while\nbut like we've done that so we believe\nin that work it's also why we have\nthings like career\ncoaching we're also trying to do things\nby shaping your environment by doing\nthings like advocacy we go to different\nconferences we have the healthy gamer\nInstitute where we're trying and teach\nclinicians stuff about technology\naddiction so we're working on all those\nthings you guys don't ever see that work\nwhich is\nfine but when I talk to you directly\nwhat is the tool that I have I have the\ntool of you changing\nyourself there are a lot of people out\nthere who are trying to do the other\nstuff which is great I think it's\ngreat but what what is the scope of our\nwork it is to change you because I\npersonally think that once you start\ntrying to change circumstances first of\nall I'm not an expert in that and\nsecondly like it gets muddy real quick I\nknow a lot of organizations that have\nreally great intentions that try to make\na positive impact in the world that like\ndoesn't TR it doesn't land in some ways\npulling off programs like housing first\nare exceedingly\ndifficult I actually think it's way\neasier to just change you instead of\nchange your\nlife because all we have to change is\nyou it's way easier to change the way\nthat you perceive and receive love than\nit is to change someone else's love\ntowards you this is my\nbelief now the crazy\nthing is that I also think changing\nyourself is far more\neffective I think that 90% of your\ndestiny is formed by your thoughts and\nyour actions now I know that's a bold\nclaim I know that a lot of people will\nrebel against it I will be the first to\nsay that that is not objective\nif you ask me as a scientist not really\na scientist but from a scientific\nperspective what do you think about that\nstatement I would say that that is\nincorrect I would say that changing\nyourself maybe accounts for\n50% at most but we have a lot of data\nthat shows that your genetics your\ncircumstances we can determine where you\nwere born and we can predict your median\nincome quite well there's a lot of data\nthat shows that the statement that I\njust made is\nfalse and yet I still believe it cuz I\nthink there's shortcomings to studies\nand hopefully with some of the nuances\nthat we've shown you all today you\nunderstand kind of what I'm talking\nabout because just because A study says\nsomething doesn't make it\ntrue if we look at the studies on\ndepressive realism oh they're more\naccurately judge the real world well in\nsome Dimensions yes and in some\nDimensions they're way worse at judging\nit depends on which side of depression\nbias you're looking at and some ways\nthey're less biased and some ways\nthey're more\nbiased and comes down to mental Karma so\nI'm going to share this concept with you\nif yall don't believe me fair enough\nright because I recognize that that is\none of the statements that I make that\nis less supported by evidence completely\nagree and hopefully I I mean I try\nreally hard to separate out the two this\nis just Dr K's opinion versus this is\nsomething that is scientifically\ngrounded in some really solid evidence\nthis is Dr K's\nopinion big\ndifference but I believe it right and so\nmy job is to share with y'all what I\nbelieve\nsometimes why do I believe this because\nI think the Western world has not\nunderstood karma in especially mental\nKarma so the more I've understood this\nconcept and we have a a video about\nit in the trauma guide by the way so we\nhave this video on mental G my here\nso I want you all to think about your\nthoughts and how your thoughts shape\nyour actions and we're going to use the\nvery simple example of playing a video\ngame if I play a video game today what\nwill happen in my thoughts I'll be\noccupied for one hour and then what will\nhappen at the end of that hour when I'm\ndone with playing one match let's say I\nquue up for a\ngame what will happen in my mind I will\nhave thoughts to\ncontinue and so I play a second game and\nthen I thoughts to continue I play a\nthird game finally I start feeling\nhungry so I\nstop and I've taken one action to play a\nvideo game I've created a whole set of\nthoughts now I look at the day and I\nrealize oh my God it's the evening I\ndidn't do any work so now I have\nthoughts of\nregret now I have thoughts of beating\nmyself up and being frustrated with\nmyself now because I have thoughts of\nbeing frustrated with myself what is my\nprimary Mo coping mechanism for negative\nemotions it is to use\ntechnology or have a beer or something\nlike\nthat so now I spend an hour on my phone\nlooking at cat videos to absolve myself\nof the feeling of regret I don't even\nrealize I'm doing it happens so fast\nsubconsciously the thoughts become\nautopilot and then once I've eaten\nsomething and I watch something while\nI'm eating eating now I've kind of\ncooled off and I'm going to play a game\nagain and then I'm going to go to bed\ntoo late and then I'm going to wake up\nthe next morning I'm going to be groggy\nI'm going to drink too much caffeine and\nthen I'm going to crash around 400 p.m.\nnow since I'm fatigued and my frontal\nloes aren't working and the caffeine is\nwearing off I feel tired I feel burnt\nout I've been working all day I've been\ncatching up on some work and because I'm\nsmart and because I'm hardworking like\nthings are kind of okay but now my\nfrontal loes are exhausted so what do I\ndo I can't resist the impulse to play\nanother\ngame so once the caffeine wears off and\nI can no longer work I ceue up and I\nplay for 4 hours hour three rolls around\nI'm feeling super hungry I order some\nfood a pizza shows up later I eat the\npizza I watch some shows until I pass\nout now the food is in my belly it's\nhighly processed it induces inflammation\nmy gut bacteria get worse I don't\nproduce neurotransmitter precursor at\nquite the same rate because I'm eating\ntrash the next day I wake up my I I have\na mild level of in inflammation my\nfriends and I used to call this feeling\nowned this is old terminology now Boomer\nterminology but we just say like man I\njust feel owned today like you just\ndon't feel like doing [ __ ] and so what\ndo you do when you feel owned you have\nthis mild level of inflammation my level\nof inflammation is correlated with an\nincrease in depression and anxiety now I\nfeel a little little bit sadder I don't\nfeel motivated I don't feel passionate\nwhat do I do because my world is\ndull nothing's exciting I don't want to\nread a book I play\ngames let me get that external\nstimulation I've covered a 72-hour\nperiod where is the root of this you\nlook at this and you say I play way too\nmany games I don't go to sleep on time I\neat like [ __ ]\nthe only time I can get work done is\nwhen I'm caffeinated I'm burnt out at\nwork I have no passion I don't feel like\nreading I don't feel like doing any\ncreative work by the way there's no\nfriends in here I'm\nlonely where does this\nstart it starts with your mind I choose\nto play one\ngame we do not\nrealize how we are propagating our our\ncircumstances you look at all of these\nthings and you say this is so hard to\ncontrol we don't recognize that the\nmoment that you start playing a game it\nsuppresses your hunger\nreceptors it makes it hard for you to\nfeel\nhungry and then what happens is when\nyou're done suppressing it suddenly the\nhunger Rises so much that it breaks\nthrough your suppression of awareness of\nhunger and then you feel famished you're\nat a caloric deficit so you order 2,000\ncalories of\nfood where does this start it starts in\nhere this is mental\nKarma and I see the flip side of it\ntoo where once you start controlling\nyour thoughts once you start sewing the\nright kind of mental Karma I want to eat\nthis thing I am not going to eat this\nthing I'm not going to give in in to an\nImpulse in my\nmind this person hasn't texted me back\nmaybe I should message them and see why\nthey haven't texted me\nback and then I'll do it 16 more times\nover 40\nminutes mental\nKarma we let our minds run wild we do\nnot cultivate Gardens we have these\novergrown patches of whatever the [ __ ]\nand then Society loves to colonize our\nmind oh my God let me explain to you how\nif you use this hair gel you would be\nmore\nattractive if you use this Axe Body\nSpray how women wouldn't be able to\nresist you how if you played this video\ngame you would be happy if you ordered\nthis this Ab Core Destroyer roller Core\nPower ab workout\nthing then you would be in the best\nshape of your life if you wore this\nclothing people would like you if you\nhad a thigh gap you would be more\nattractive see what's happening right\nnow is our minds are being\ncolonized they're being shaped to think\nin a particular way political propaganda\nis just the tip of the iceberg beauty\nstandards all this kind of stuff is\nhappening and we are not in control at\nall we're letting them\ncolonize it's like an invasive species\nthat is ripping through our\nmind and then we wonder why we don't\ncontrol Our\nLives it starts with mental Karma what\nis the action you take in the mind and\nthis is very simple to understand\nincredibly difficult but simple to\nunderstand when I take an action in my\nmind what happens in my life when I ceue\nup for one video game what is the\nconsequence\nfirst consequence is I cue up for one I\ndon't play one I play\nsix see our mind does not understand\nthis it doesn't understand the karmic\nconsequences of our\nactions so it lets you queue up for one\nin fact our mental karma is so bad that\nit tries to delude\nyou because a part of your mind knows\nthat one game is going to turn into six\nbut your mind doesn't even let you\nrealize that it hides it from you\nso everyone is saying oh my God this is\nme you know oh my God so true aware this\nis how it is so I want you all to think\nabout this for a moment all of you know\nthis\nbut you let it happen this is mental\nKarma ignorance is not the problem here\nit is action that is the problem it is a\nlack of mental action that is the\nproblem\nso what does it mean what does mental\nkarma mean so you guys can check out the\nvideo on the trauma guide for\nsure but the main thing that I want\nyouall to really pay attention to is\njust notice your mind and which actions\nyou take in your mind and what are the\nconsequences in your mind if I choose to\nhave a beer today what does that mean\nabout my desire for beer tomorrow\nbecause here we are we're saying I can't\ncontrol my desires I can't motivate\nmyself what are the things that lead to\nmore motivation what are the things that\nlead to less\nmotivation\ncomparison great way to destroy your\nmotivation is compare I worked really\nhard at this I'm proud and then I look\nat someone else and theirs is nicer\n[ __ ] comparison is of the\nmind and we wonder why we're not\nmotivated so when I say I think 90% of\nyour life is\nshapable by you this is what I'm\nreferring to I think it's because\nthere's this huge Dimension that we\ndon't cultivate that we don't act\non how do you get your mind to listen\nit's not about getting it to listen it\nis about sewing the right Karma what are\nthe things that you can do so that your\nthe state of your mind is\nmalleable if I drink every day it's hard\nto stop\ndrinking if I stop drinking it's easy to\nnot drink\neasier let's\nsay right so the actions that you take\nset up the difficulties in your\nmind because when we look at this\ncommunity what we see a lot of bad\ncircumstances absolutely but we also see\na lot of bad mental issues and I don't\nmean illness I mean procrastination lack\nof motivation no passion no follow\nthrough no discipline where do these\nthings exist they exist in the mind\nand my biggest problem my mom was like\nyou need to be more disciplined wake up\nat 7 a.m. every day and you'll be more\ndisciplined I was like in order to wake\nup at 7: a.m. I need to be more\ndisciplined that's that's the that's the\neffect not the\ncause so where do you start with mental\nKarma just any action whether it is\nhaving a soda or having water the\ntiniest little thing notice that your\nmind wants to do something and try to\nfigure out which garma you want to sew\ndo I want to queue up right now or can I\nclean for 15 minutes before I queue\nup a revolution in your life is made\nfrom tiny little things no snowflake\nbelieves it is responsible for the\nAvalanche and if you want an avalanche\nof change in your life the snowflakes\nare thoughts such a tiny thing such an\ninsignificant thing\nbut cultivate enough of them\nand and the whole thing is when you see\nan avalanche you don't see\nsnowflakes\nright you see something so big and when\nyou look at someone's life who's\ndisciplined and successful you don't see\ntheir mind that's why it's so hard to\nduplicate we try to duplicate their\nactions not what goes on in their\nhead this person eats this so I should\neat this too this person wears this so I\nshould wear this too this person goes to\nthe gym every day so I should go to the\ngym every day but you can't the question\nis what do they do in their\nmind so understand this concept of\nmental\nKarma understand that every day when you\ntake an action in your mind when you\ngive into a thought or you allow a\nthought or you move away from a thought\nthat will have consequences in your\nmind you have a desire in your mind oh\nlet me see what my ex is doing on social\nmedia let me see if they're dating\nanyone new giving into that thought\n[ __ ] for three\ndays such a tiny little thing such a\nsmall snowflake such a large\nAvalanche we give in all the time\nwithout realizing\nthis is mental Karma so here's what I\nwant youall to\ndo so I say 90% numers way too high I'll\nbe the first to admit that that is\nscientifically not\nrealistic\nbut give it a\nshot give it a\nshot cultivate the right thought\nthoughts in your mind this isn't the\npower of positivity what I mean is be\nvery very direct it's not think good\nthings it is take mental\naction by resisting particular thoughts\nor leaning into particular things let me\nclean for 15 minutes instead of playing\na game let me do 10 push-ups between\ncues let me drink a glass of water every\ntwo games even if I don't feel like it\nforget about drinking a glass of water\nif I don't feel like it let me grab a\nwater glass and set it next next to\nmy\ncomputer you'll be amazed or tell me it\ndoesn't work fair\nenough that's how this works so these\nposts that we responded to to to today\nby the way when we say that HG is more\nthan me this is what we're talking\nabout right there's a whole team here\nthat works really hard yall contribute\nyou\nchat I respond to that chat I say\nsomething you say Dr K this is right and\nthis is wrong this worked for me this\ndidn't work for me and then we keep\ngoing that's how we advance this is how\nwe climb the ranks of IRL there are\nabsolutely tools like the\nguide but a lot of it is like yall are\ngoing to go experiment and report back\nand by the way we we didn't cover this\nbut I guess we should\num so like this is a problem that we\ntend to have but I'm going to share this\nwith yall and then we'll\nmeditate so like this is how this works\nso I'll leave youall with this\nokay discovering Joy after a life of\nabuse quick post because I'm tired but\nI'm finally feeling the payoff of all of\nmy internal\nwork I'm just meditating now and we're\ndone\nokay breaking up made me realize how\nmuch my trauma was affecting my life I\ngot in a very dark place after that\nconstantly watching Dr K Patrick Tian\nand others to avoid doing something\nstupid by the way Patrick Tian is great\nstrongly recommend youall check out his\ncontent um start to work on my inner\nchild and self-hate from being abused as\na child this hate filled me my life like\npoison for a long time it was very hard\nto get out of bed and keep going\ncurrently problems like my ex coming\nback and struggles made me realize I had\nbad\nself-image I use mbti as a guide I know\nit's not scientific and I realized I was\nan extrovert ENFJ not\ninj realized I'm probably not autistic\nand this label was getting in the way of\nmy self-development realized this Loop\nthis is what we're going for unhealthy I\ndon't know what Fe\nmeans um unhealthy feelings maybe mind\nthinks about other people and what they\nmay think of you all the time burnout\nmake you numb to your emotions and\nthoughts first thing that goes when we\nstart to burn out is empathy you become\nemotionally distant people notice this\nbut blame lack of empathy you numb\nyourself more because you are egocentric\nand they are right and\nrepeat this is mental Karma this person\nhas mapped it\nout start to get out of the loop and\nrealize bad coping made me manipulate\npeople by being a doormat start to\ncommunicate better and be around people\nthat really respect me and don't feed on\nmy distorted self-perception mental\nKarma mental Karma mental Karma listen\nmore than I talk wohoo and try to solve\nother people's problems is instead of\nbeing stuck in my head but put a healthy\ndistance between what other people think\nfeel and what I feel I'm tired all the\ntime but I am constantly filled with a\nsense of Joy when I become aware of my\nshadow aspects and start integrating and\ntransmuting instead of denying and\nprojecting my dark side my higher self\nmy karmic relationships the ego old\npatterns and my Spirit\nguides so it can be done\nchat can it be done by you I don't\nknow the question\nis how can we find\nout all right so we're going to leave\nyall with uh a meditation from the\nguide okay\nso oh here we\ngo we're now going to go into a very\nsimple meditation practice that helps us\nrelieve emotional energy so the first\nthing to understand is that emotions are\nnot simply mental we sort of think about\nemotions starting over\nchat we're now going to go into a very\nsimple meditation practice that helps us\nrelieve emotional energy so the first\nthing to understand is that emotions are\nnot simply mental we sort of think about\nabout emotions is something that happens\nin the mind but emotions absolutely have\na physiological component all emotions\naffect our nervous system as well as our\nphysiology so we know that some emotions\nare associated with the sympathetic\nnervous system things like anger or\nanxiety will increase our respiratory\nrate and our heart rate we also know\nthat even when it comes to diagnosing an\nanxiety disorder muscle tension is one\nof the diagnostic criteria so emotions\nexist Within our body so today we're\ngoing to share with you a technique very\nsimple technique to utilize your body to\nrelieve emotional energy anytime you're\nfeeling some kind of emotion there will\nbe some kind of physical correlate so\nfor example with anxiety we frequently\nexperience things like muscle tension\nespecially in the area of the neck and\nthe shoulders and even emotions like\nsadness can feel like a constriction in\nour throat and there are even subtle\nvariations so while we may think of\nsomething like shame\nor feeling worthless is the same there's\na subtle difference in terms of the\nphysical pattern of these two emotions\nso in this practice all we're going to\ndo is notice where there is a physical\nsensation within our body and many times\nespecially if we are alexithymic or\ncolorblind to our internal emotional\nstate we may not even be aware that we\nare feeling an emotion and yet you will\nbe able to detect some kind of physical\nsensation and the cool thing about\nemotions is that if we are mentally\nfeeling some way it will trigger a\nphysical reaction but the converse is\nalso true if we do something to the body\nwe can actually relieve emotional energy\nthis is one of the theories that was\ndeveloped into something called the\nemotional Freedom technique or EFT we\naddress that a little bit more in the\ntreatment section but that's just one\nexample of a therapy that was developed\nwith this principle for the purpose of\ntoday what we're going to do is first of\nall notice what we feel in our body\nsecondly we will breathe into that\nphysical manifestation and as we breathe\ninto it we will notice that that\nphysical manifestation relaxes as the\nphysical manifestation of the emotion\nrelaxes the mental emotion will also\ncalm down I'm going to walk you through\nthe sequence of the practice and then\nwe'll try to do it together so the first\nstep of this practice is very very\nsimple just notice what you feel within\nyour body as you close your eyes and pay\nattention your body will suddenly give\nyou all kinds of\nsignals it'll tell you hey there's a\nlittle bit of tension over here or\nthere's an itch over here and especially\nif we're feeling emotion we'll feel some\nkind of dominant\nsensation so spend a few moments\nfocusing on whatever sensation you\nexperience whatever floats to the\nsurface and then what we're going to do\nis take a deep breath and as you breathe\nin imagine that the breath is traveling\nto that part of your body follow the\nbreath bre into the part of your body\nthat feels tight constricted or\nuncomfortable and what you'll naturally\nnotice is as you breathe into it that\nspace will expand and relax a little bit\nand now what we're going to do is\nbreathe out so as we breathe out there\nwill be an even further relaxation so\ninstead of returning to our original\ntightness that part of your body will\nrelax so all we need to do is f focus on\na particular part of our body where we\nexperience an emotion and breathe in and\nout of that region so we'll breathe into\nthe particular part of our body for\nthree breaths five breaths seven breaths\nmaybe even nine the more powerful the\nemotion the more breaths you may need to\ntake we don't want to breathe\nparticularly rapidly in fact we want it\nto go slow and while we are doing the\nbreathing we want to pay attention to\nour physical sensation so let's say\nlet's assume that I have tightness in\nthe chest so as I breathe in I'm going\nto pay attention to that\ntightness over the course of our breaths\nwe will feel the tightness naturally\nrelax and as the tightness in our body\nrelaxes we will notice a mirroring\nrelaxation within the mind so now let's\ngo through this emotional breathing\ntechnique\ntogether so if you're feeling a\nparticular emotion right now or you're\nfeeling something in your body we'll\npick that is our Focus otherwise we'll\nuse the chest is a simple example just\nfor the sake of explaining the practice\nso I want you to focus on your physical\nbody a prominent sensation and if you\ndon't feel anything in particular you\ncan focus on the center of the\nchest close your eyes sit up as straight\nas possible we want our back to be\nstraight our neck to be straight our\nhead to be straight and now we will\nslowly breathe into the\nchest and as you slowly breathe in\nyou'll feel the chest naturally expand\nand then we will\nexhale and then the chest slowly\nrelaxes and now take a second\nbreath and\nexhale and now at your own pace slowly\nbreathe into and out of the chest\nand as you focus on that particular part\nof your body when you breathe in put all\nof your attention on the physical change\nof\ninhalation and then all of your\nattention on the physical change of\nexhalation with each outgrowing breath\nlet your body\nrelax let your body deflate with each\nexhalation aside from your spine which\nshould remain erect through the whole\npractice everything else is relaxing\nnice slow deep\nbreaths and as you get into breath\nnumber six number seven really try to\nslow down the\nexhalation and let that relaxation\nhappen very very gradually\ncontinue breathing at your own\npace you'll notice a natural slowing of\nyour respiratory rate totally\nfine and now pause for a second and pay\nattention to how you feel now\nyou may notice that the physical\nsensation has resolved or reduced and\nyou'll also notice a natural slowing of\nthe\nmind now when you're ready you can come\nback if we've been practicing for a few\nminutes you may notice even a change in\nyour sensory perception that the space\naround you seems a little bit different\nfrom a color or lighting perspective and\nthat just means that you did the\npractice right the main thing to\nremember about this practice especially\nwhen we're dealing with situations of\noverwhelming emotion or things like a\ntriggered trauma is that these emotions\nwill dominate our thoughts they shape\nwhat we think about they make us feel\nlike we're panicked they make us feel\nout of control and our body doesn't\nreally know what to do with all of this\nenergy so normally in cases of trauma we\nwill turn to other kinds of things to\nmanage these emotions\nwe will experience some sort of\nreflective numbness where our brain is\ntrying to suppress these emotional\nsignals or we'll turn to other kinds of\ncoping mechanisms to push the emotions\naway often times those behaviors that we\nengage in actually create more problems\nfor us down the road if I'm\nprocrastinating on studying for a test\nbecause I need to do really well on it\nthat procrastination causes me even more\nPanic the next day so you can employ\nthis practice anytime you're\nexperiencing some sort of negative\nemotion you don't have to practice for\n10 minutes or 15 minutes you can do five\nbreaths seven breaths nine breaths you\ncan practice for five or seven minutes\nif you want to whatever feels right to\nyou in the case of people who don't\nsubjectively experience emotion you can\neven do this practice if you feel a\nphysical sensation so sometimes if we're\na lexic which means that we don't know\ninternally what emotion we're\nexperiencing we're colorblind to our\ninternal emotional state you can still\nnotice physical Sensations and if you\nnotice some kind of physical discomfort\nyou can use this practice to resolve\nthat discomfort and calm down the\nemotion okay chat all right\nso thank y'all for coming today\num that's a video from the trauma guide\nwhich is out now it's been a couple\nyears in the making ton of research full\nteam\neffort I really hope it helps yall man\nwe like it was so carefully\ncrafted\num there's a lot you know that goes into\nit a lot that gets cut from it uh a lot\nthat we try to figure out okay like so\nif we actually want to help people like\nwhat is the sequence of things that\ny'all can build on\nand um that's really what it is it's\nlike a skill tree I for real life and so\nthe trauma guide is really about the\ndimension of how events shape\nyou the science of\nadaptation and also like how to rewire\nyourself um so it's made with a lot of\nlove thank you all very much for coming\ntoday happy Monday and good luck chat"
