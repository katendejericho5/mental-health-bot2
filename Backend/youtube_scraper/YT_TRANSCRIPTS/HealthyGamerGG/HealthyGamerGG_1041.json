    "transcript": "what to do when your significant other\nis battling clinical depression\nhi this is going to be a rather long\ntext so thank you in advance to anyone\nwho came may come across this\npost and taking the time to reading\nthrough it my significant other has been\nbattling clinical depression going to a\ntherapist as well as psychiatrist\nplus taking meds for a couple of years\nnow so i've known about his overall\ncondition way before we became\nromantically involved about a year and a\nhalf ago\ni have to admit it was going to be a\nchallenge but i did not realize just how\nlimited my knowledge on the subject was\nand how hard it had been is for him to\nlive with this condition especially\nduring covid\nmost of the time i'm able to think\npositively and not lose my patience i\ncare for him very deeply and i always\ntry my best to put himself in his place\nif i ever get\nput myself in his place if i ever get\nfrustrated mainly because he can't get\nout of bed until the evening which\nunfortunately is the case for most of\nthe days\nhe's currently taking a break from his\nstudies due to his declining condition\nfor the past year\ni understand how hard it is sometimes to\nget out of bed especially when there is\nnothing to look forward to and when only\ndespair and hopelessness await\ni understand that very often when he is\nawake he wants nothing more\nbut to distract himself from reality\nwith wow i do understand it i'm aware\nthat fighting depression can be a very\nlong and repetitive process and that\nimprovements can't be felt from one day\nto another\nbut recently the hopelessness has got to\nme and i can't help but feel overwhelmed\nsometimes\ni've noticed that on several occasions i\ncouldn't contain my frustration anymore\ni feel as if nothing has changed since\nthe beginning i've decided that changes\nhave to be made if not from his side at\nthe very least from mine but how\nup until now i've only\ntried to be merely there for him\nemotionally offering him words of\nencouragement when he is at is very low\ni try to encourage him to socialize or\nto take a walk with him to get some\nfresh air or to partake in activities\nbesides playing wow\nbut i never force him to do anything he\nis not feeling like doing i try to get\nhim out of bed every day i try my very\nbest to make sure that at the very least\nhe doesn't have to worry about having no\nclean clothes to wear or warm meals to\neat we've been living together for some\ntime now should i start forcing him to\ndo things i know for a fact will better\nhis condition in the long run like\ngetting out of bed on time having daily\nroutine he can stick to restricting his\nscreen time getting fresh air on a daily\nbasis\nbut i fear by doing so i will be adding\nto his stress and suffocating him\nmetaphorically i fear i will be taking\non the role of his mother instead of his\nromantic partner i fear by taking on a\nwrong approach on supporting him i will\nleave irreversible damage on his mental\nhealth or unnecessarily prolong his\nbattle with depression and on our\nrelationship\nokay\nvery critical post\nfantastic okay\nreally important so let's try to\nunderstand this\nso if you're in a relationship with\nsomeone who has a mental illness\nit's one of the hardest things to do\nright because you know that they're ill\nso if they're depressed they have\ntrouble getting out of bed\nand you want to be supportive right like\nbecause the right thing to do the way to\nbe a good partner in this situation is\nto be like caring and supportive\nthe least i can do is try to encourage\nhim right but you don't want to like\nhurt him right because you know that\nthere's depression so if you push him\ntoo far and he can't do it because he's\ndepressed it's like if i have someone\nwho's handicapped and can't walk and i'm\nyelling at them to like get out of the\nwheelchair and climb the stairs\nlike that's an thing to do\nand so when it comes to depression the\ndisability that people experience is\nlike getting out of bed right\nit's like being able to work being able\nto focus being able to get an erection\nlike so so then you're really stuck in\nthis scenario where\nyou know you want to be supportive you\nwant to help them you don't want to be\nmean\nright you don't want to force them into\nthings you don't want to make things\nworse so you try to be like\nunrelentingly positive right i'm going\nto be patient i'm going to be kind i'm\ngoing gonna be empathic i'm gonna make\nsure they get like warm meals because\nthey're not taking care of themselves\nlike i'm gonna take care of them because\nthey can't take care of themselves\nand this goes on for a while and then\nlike suddenly like you get into this\nweird situation where as a caregiver\nyou're not sure what to do because\ndespite all this the support and all the\nlove and all the patience like they\ndon't seem to be getting better and\nyou're starting to run out of patience\nand so then like this whole wave of\nnegative emotions then starts to come up\nlike\nyou feel like a bad person because you\nare running out of patience with someone\nwho's ill right like they're ill it's\nnot their fault and you should be\npatient because to be patient is to be\ngood and if i'm losing my patience then\nthat means i'm bad and that means i'm\nnot being a supportive girlfriend so\nthen that means that like i need to be\nbetter right and we can see that even in\nthis post like you can look at it right\nhere\nwhere the person is acknowledging that\nlike\nyou know\num\nwhere is it\nso like you know\nshould i hold on i've tried to decide uh\nbe there emotionally but i never force\nhim i feel like\ni'm trying to\nmy very best\nshould i start forcing him\num add to stress i fear that taking on\nthe role i fear by taking the wrong\napproach and support i think i will\nleave irreversible damage\num yeah but recently the hopelessness\nhas got to me this is the sentence i'm\nlooking for right\nso at some point it starts to cost you\nsomething\nand then what happens is you feel guilty\nbecause like like let's say so i know\nthat you know if you post something like\nthis on the internet in the majority of\nplaces\nyou know you'll get very\ndrastic responses so like in certain\nplaces like and you may notice you you\nhad this response like dump this guy\nlike this guy is a complete waste of\nspace like you deserve better you're a\ngood person you deserve better like move\non with your life this person doesn't\ndeserve this from you right like you're\nbabying them like this person needs to\ngrow up so you're going to get that kind\nof response\nyou also get communities where people\nwill say that you know the opposite is\ntrue where like people will be like if\nsomeone is ill like you can't abandon\nthem\nthen you feel guilty because if you\nthink about breaking up you're not\nenjoying this relationship anymore\nbecause they're ill and then you feel\nlike an ass for breaking up with them\nbecause you don't enjoy it because\nthey're ill like that's not their fault\nand then you kind of feel petty so\nthere's there's you know trying to do a\ngood job and being a supportive partner\nand then there's the guilt that comes\nwith the inevitable cost that\nyou pay\nand then the last thing is like the\nuncertainty\nand the frustration of like what do i do\nhere right like am i doing too much am i\nenabling him\nlike how do i know if someone is\ndepressed if i'm enabling them\nbecause if you're enabling them then\nyou're by supporting them you're hurting\nthem right you're hurting them and\nyourself\nbut like\nif you're not enabling them and they\nreally can't do it without your support\nmaybe they'd crumple completely so like\nif you you know push them harder are you\ngonna like damage things irreversibly\nlike this person is afraid of or by\ncontinuing your course or you enabling\nbad behavior\nright and this is like it's so hard to\nfigure out because\neither thing you do whether you're a\ngood person or a bad person it could be\nthe wrong thing and you could be\nscrewing things up it's it's so\ndifficult\nand so when when\nthen what ends up happening is people\nsort of like decide right like okay well\nif i don't really know what to do what\ni'm gonna settle on is the thing that\nlike i can absolutely put my compass\nbehind which is like be better myself\nbe more patient be more supportive like\nwe all know that those things are\nabsolutely good things right so like in\nthe uncertainty of not knowing if i'm\nenabling him or if i'm gonna i'm\nsupposed to push him or like what's\ngoing on like let me at least know to do\nwhat i know to do is good which is like\nbe patient and be a good person and suck\nit up and be there for him and don't\nabandon them because abandonment we're\npretty sure is bad right so let me like\nnot do that right and so this is where\npeople end up so first thing is\ncaregiver burnout is very real\nwe talk a lot about so there's a ton of\nresearch on caregiver burnout when it\ncomes to cancer\ni think one of the things that is is\nwoefully understudied in the field of\nmedicine is caregiver burnout with\nrelation to mental illness and including\nthings like addiction\nso in order to understand you know what\nthe right move is here the first thing\nthat we've got to do is understand your\ninternal environment which we kind of\ndid right you want to be a good\nsupportive partner so you're going to be\npatient you're going to cook meals\nyou're going to do laundry you're going\nto do all this kind of stuff which by\nthe way is kind of mother stuff by the\nway fyi\nright\nand then you feel guilty for like\nwanting to set limits for being\nfrustrated yourself you feel like a bad\nperson then you kind of like feel stuck\nbecause you don't know what to do\nso the next thing to understand here is\nthat in this situation we've got more\nthan depression going on so i'm going to\nshare with you all something and this is\nwhen we're talking about research i feel\npretty good about this because this is\nlike literally my day job right so i did\na lot of learning about this\nso i think this sounds to me like a\nsituation where we've got actually like\na dual diagnosis situation so i'm not\ndiagnosing this person with anything\nbut this is what these kinds of\nsituations look like to me okay so\nthere's a lot of questions you have to\nask to really make sure that this is\nfirst of all clinical depression we\ndon't really know this person's medical\nrecord so we're taking that at face\nvalue and then there's also like this\nproblematic gaming but this absolutely\nsmells to me like a dual diagnosis\nsituation and this is what makes the\nsituation hard\nso if we look at depression\ndepression tends to be\nlasts about a year okay\nso clinical depression tends to be a\norganic and by that i mean a biological\nprocess that tends to last about one\nyear so we see a neurochemistry change\nand if you guys have not watched dr k's\nguide to depression we go into a ton of\ndetail about this so highly highly\nhighly recommend that so we'll go but\ni'm going to talk about about it some\nhere\nbut clinical depression is like a\nneurochemistry imbalance that affects\nthings like your energy level and stuff\nlike that and lasts for about a year\nso the main thing about clinical\ndepression is that\nit tends to last up to\none year\nso\nthe natural course\nof people who have traditional clinical\ndepression which is major depressive\ndisorder the most common form of uh\ncontributor to uh clinical depression\nis we see an uh a\na normal\nlife cycle of like depression and\nfeeling good\nso like this is the baseline so here's\nan episode of depression here's an\nepisode of depression but then they\nshould feel like relatively normal in\nthis window and in this window\nokay\nso what i'm hearing is that this person\nhas been in this relationship for 1.5\nyears and it hasn't really gotten better\nwhich suggests to me that there is more\ngoing on here than clinical depression\nso if we see a scenario that is\nessentially like this\nright\nwhere actually let me yeah let me redo\nthat\nso when we see a scenario that's more\nlike this where you know here's the\nbaseline that we're shooting for and\nthis person is kind of like there okay\nand they never rise above like there's\nnever like a moment where they go above\nokay\nthis tells me this is very common for\nsomething called dual diagnosis\nand what happens in dual diagnosis is we\nhave a suppressing influence\non these parts\nokay\nand usually dual diagnosis refers to\nsubstance use\nokay\nso when we've got someone who is an\nalcoholic and has clinical depression we\nsee this picture of years\nof people being\ndepressed\nall right so like essentially what's\ngoing on i think what's going on here is\nthe gaming right so let's just imagine a\nscenario where\nyou know this is their baseline\nnormally what should happen is they\nshould go like this right\nbut if they have bad video gaming habits\nlike they wake up at night time and they\nplay wow all day all night and then they\ngo to bed early in the morning they're\ngoing to be negatively impacting their\ncircadian rhythm\nthey're not going to be exercising\nright there's like the negative like\ndopaminergic effects\nof gaming so they're going to be feel\nbored or unmotivated so what this\nresults in is like\nmotivational problems\nor boredom\nin other parts of life so when they\nshould be able to like get back on their\nfeet like essentially what's happening\nis\nthe gaming is actually like\ncreating a suppressing influence that\nkind of keeps them there\nand then even when the gaming influence\nkind of wears off then what happens is\nthe depression starts again so this is\nthe white line is the depression\nand then we're into our second\ndepressive episode\nokay\nand so what we end up with is\nessentially like periods of time where\nwe\nare constantly like not doing well\nso like there are good examples of\nthings that are actually the opposite of\nthis right so and it's going to sound\nkind of weird\nso if i'm depressed\nokay\nthere's data that shows that having a\npet\nis protective against depression so even\nif i'm clinically depressed\nhaving a pet does this\nand then if we think about well like\nwhat is the effect of having a pet right\nso there's like emotional support sure\nbut then what else does a pet do a pet\nforces you to leave the house\nright if i've got a dog i've got to go\nfor like two walks a day\nlike it's getting me out it's getting me\nexposure to vitamin d which by the way\nvitamin d deficiency is a risk factor\nfor depression\ngamers are more likely to be vitamin d\ndeficient\nright so we get more vitamin d like\nwe're engaging with other things like we\njust said we're forced to take care of\nthings right so we have to wake up on\ntime\nright like we have to do all kinds of\nthings that adhere to some kind of\nregular schedule because we have a pet\nand then this in turn\nyou know has positive impacts on our\ncircadian rhythm\nand then buffers against the effects of\ndepression\nso what i'm really sniffing here is that\nthis is not just a depression problem\nit's a depression plus gaming problem\nand the other thing that we understand\nabout dual diagnosis is that dual\ndiagnosis treatment of one thing is\nineffective\nokay\nso now we also see a couple of other\nthings so like solo treatment\ntx stands for treatment doesn't work\nso in the case of alcohol and depression\nlet's talk about this right so i can\nstart someone on an ssri but when they\nhave the cns central nervous system\ndepressant\neffects of alcohol\nit\nwow that handwriting is particularly bad\nwhen you have the cns depressant effects\nof alcohol it sort of counters the ssri\nor the antidepressant medication\nright because the alcohol is a cns\ndepressant it's gonna like make you\ndepressed right because people who drink\nor like get mopey and stuff like that\nand then this in turn like if you get\ndrunk and you're hungover and stuff like\nthat it's gonna be hard to hold a job if\nit's hard to hold a job like you're not\ngonna wake up on time and then like your\ndepression has free reign\nso it's almost like the alcohol and\nand like depression work in concert to\nkeep you down and we see the same thing\nwith gaming as well and this is a\npattern that i've seen over and over\nagain so since solo treatment doesn't\nwork we get this picture\nof\ni've been in treatment\nfor years\nand i'm not getting better it doesn't\nwork\nright and we sort of see that in this\ncase too\nwhere this person appears to have been\nlike you know in treatment for a couple\nof years but their situation does not\nappear to be getting better\nso people will conclude that treatment\nis not effective whereas what's really\ngoing on is it's not that treatment\nisn't effective it's that there's a dual\ndiagnosis issue\nthat is preventing treatment from being\neffective\nso the flip side of this is also true\nwell you can say like okay fine so\nalcohol negatively impacts the effects\nof\nantidepressant treatment but does it\nwork both ways and the answer is\nabsolutely yes so if i'm sober\nright and i'm on i've untreated\ndepression i start being sober i've been\nsober for six months\nand i start to get depressed mdd kicks\nin\ni get depressed\nand now i feel bad all the time what am\ni gonna do i'm gonna start drinking\nright because you use alcohol as a\ncoping mechanism so as the mdd kicks in\nyou relapse so we also see this this\nissue with people who are struggling to\nbe sober so people you know remember i\nalways said like treatment doesn't work\nso like have difficulty being sober\nand why is that it's because every time\nyou make progress on the sobriety the\ndepression kicks in and like knocks your\nfeet out from under you\nso then what happened is\nlike clinicians basically figured out\nthat the right way to treat this is like\nyou have to treat both at once you\ncannot just make someone sober\nand then like leave them on their own\nbecause the depression is going to kick\nin and is going to knock their feet out\nfrom under them so you have to make them\nsober and treat the depression at the\nsame time and the flip side is also true\nthat like if you want to manage the\ndepression you're gonna have to deal\nwith the addiction\nand so what i'm sort of seeing in a\nsituation like this is that like there's\nno limits on the gaming and the gaming\nis actually like propagating and\nworsening the depression that would be\nmy guess from this amount of information\nnow to truly make a diagnosis i have to\ndo like a diagnostic interview right so\ni have to ask about frequency duration\nof gaming how long has this been going\non you know do you experience episodes\nof depression do you not experience\nepisodes of depression even in the video\ngaming are there times like over the\nlast year and a half where you've been\nparticularly worse like weren't able\nwere there times where you weren't able\nto weren't even able to play wow so\nthere's a thousand questions that you\nhave to go into before making a\ndiagnosis so when we say we don't make\ndiagnoses on stream\nwe're not just saying that as a\ndisclaimer it's like literally like you\ncannot do that unless you collect this\nkind of information right at the same\ntime based on my clinical experience\ni've seen situations like this and\nsometimes in situations like this this\nis what it ends up being\nso now the question is like what do you\ndo about it as a partner\nright what does the partner do\nand so this is where i think that\nunfortunately like you should probably\nstart setting limits right this is the\nkind of thing where like\nyou know this is the real challenge of\nbeing a partner is that you want to be\nsupportive towards\nsomeone who has a mental illness\nbut you have to walk the very fine line\nof being supportive\nwithout\ntaking\nresponsibility\nand this is where partners trip up\nso you start to become responsible\nfor their lives and this is really\ntricky so as a as a psychiatrist like\ni'll have patients with bipolar disorder\nright\nand so like i expect my patients to show\nup on time\nso like i have appointment\nlike policies right where it's like if\nyou don't cancel within 24 hours you get\nbilled for the appointment or whatever\nlike i need notice of a cancellation\nright and if you just serially don't\nshow up for appointments then i'm like\nnot going to be your doctor anymore\nright because i don't i have no idea\nwhat's going on now that's tricky\nbecause if you're a psychiatrist like\nliterally the disease manifests in your\npatients\nas like not being able to show up to\nappointments\nthe disease manifests as having\ndifficulty sleeping going manic and\ngoing on a gambling binge three states\naway so they don't show up there for\ntheir appointment so how do you navigate\nlike the fact that you have to make\nallowances for this person because they\nhave a mental illness and at the same\ntime still maintain some kind of healthy\nrelationship\nand so this is where you know like i\nexpect my patients to take\nresponsibility so i don't blame them for\ngetting ill but the question is like did\nyou stop taking your medication\ndid you start using again did you like\nwhat what is your hand in this stuff\nbecause this is what i've learned as a\nclinician and this is what i would say\nto all the partners out there who are\nyou know dating someone who has mental\nillness is that you can't fix them you\ncan't take all of the like this\nrelationship is never gonna work if they\nare not\ninvested and responsible and working\ntowards it\nnow it can be hard to get out of bed i'm\nnot unsympathetic to that\nso sometimes i'll have like patients who\nwill you know call me the morning of and\nthey're saying my depression is really\nbad today like i can't make my\nappointment and i'm not gonna bill them\nif it's like three hours before the\nappointment because i recognize that\nthat's\na thing right\nso i have a policy but\nwhether i enforce it or not it sort of\ndepends on the person\nbut i still expect a certain amount of\nlike responsibility so i understand that\nyou're feeling bad today but i have a\nlife too\nright and like you owe something to me\nin this relationship\ni'm not talking like you know\nis your psychiatrist like there's a\ncertain amount of work you have to do as\na patient so i can do so much as your\npsychiatrist i can show up on time\ni can be compassionate towards you i can\nbe patient i can prescribe medication i\ncan review your medical record but you\nhave some role to play like you can't\nshow up in my office and then like leave\nonce and then expect me to fix\neverything in your life that's not how\nit works i mean people have tried that\nit just doesn't work like you cannot fix\nanother human being so i have to do my\npart i have to do my dharma\nin this relationship as a treater\nand the patient has to do that as well\nand so this is where like if you've got\na partner who's doing this like i\nunderstand that you know\nlet me find this\num\nyeah so like this is where\nyou know but i never force him to\ndo anything that he is not feeling like\ndoing\nright\nlike all he wants he doesn't feel like\ndoing something\nand so this is where like i'd say that\nif you have mental illness\nyou have the responsibility of learning\nhow to do things\nthat you don't feel like doing\nin fact you don't need mental illness to\nhave that responsibility i think that's\na human responsibility\nright\nand this is what's so hard is like how\ndo we hold that boundary with compassion\nwe're not saying you know\nbreak up with him unless he does xyz but\nthis is absolutely a situation where i\nthink that\nyou know so your patience towards them\ni'm not sure that that's helping them\nbecause at this point we're at the 1.5\nyear mark this is really important right\nso if you're at the six month mark\ni would say it's reasonable to be like\ngive it six months but if we're outside\nof the window of a clinically depressive\nepisode then there are other factors at\nplay\nif you yourself are starting to burn out\nright\nthat you can't contain your frustration\nanymore like this is starting to impact\nthe relationship you cannot carry the\nrelationship all on your own right\nthat's the key thing a relationship\ncannot be carried by just one person it\nrequires both people's effort\nand what i'm getting the sense of from\nthis post is that\nyour boyfriend absolutely has clinical\ndepression and he deserves compassion\nfor that your boyfriend absolutely has\nyou know a unhealthy relationship with\nworld of warcraft which you should have\ncompassion for\nand\ni'm not entirely sure that they're\ngiving it 100\nand i think that's partially because\nyou've started taking responsibility for\nthem like you know this is the kind of\nthing where like despite depression they\nshould be able to do some things unless\nit's like absolutely crippling that they\ncan't get out of bed but if they have\nthe ability to get out of bed and play\nwow like they have the ability to do\nother things\nand i understand that they don't feel\nlike it and this is the other challenge\nwith depression right is that you don't\nyou don't feel like doing stuff\nso it makes people like feel energonic\nso doing like some things is harder\nwhich i totally get but there's also an\nevidence-based intervention for\ndepression called behavioral activation\nand behavioral activation is getting\ndepressed people to do stuff\nand what we discovered through\nbehavioral activation is when depressed\npeople start to do stuff it actually\nimproves their depression and just like\nit's a vicious cycle on the way down it\ncan be a vicious cycle on the way up\nright like you can start to really buoy\nyourself\nso this is the kind of thing where if\nyou're in this situation you know and\nyou've been at this for a year and\nthings don't seem to be getting better\nthis is what's really hard is if you sit\ndown and you have a conversation with\nyour boyfriend they can when you say\nlike hey this is not working they're\ngonna feel super bad about themselves\nit's going to like activate all their\ndepression and all that kind of crap\nright and and that's legitimate right so\nthey're going to start to maybe feel\nsuicidal or whatever because they\nunderstand that they are letting you\ndown and the depression is going to feed\non that right\nand so that's where like the\nconversation is difficult but like you\nhave to have some kind of like limit\nsetting conversation where you can say\nlook this is what i need from you in a\nrelationship\nwhat are you actually like what can you\ndo like is this like are you telling me\nthat this is the most you can do or is\nthere anything else that you can do you\ndon't have to start big we're not saying\ngive up wow we're not saying wake up at\n6 a.m every day but the key thing is to\nset some kind of limits like i'm happy\nto cook for you but like i want you to\nbe with me in the kitchen when i'm\ncooking\nif you're if you don't have the energy\nto chop anything that's fine if you\ndon't have the energy to work that's\nfine\nbut all i expect is that your ass\ninstead of playing wow your ass\nshouldn't be in your computer chair it\nshould be keeping me company in the\nkitchen\nso those are the kinds of limits which i\nthink it's completely appropriate to set\nright you're not asking for their work\nyou're asking for like their presence\nand their effort and their willingness\nto try\nif you can't wake up every day that's\ntotally fine\nif you can't wake up at eight like wake\nup at noon\nyou know if you have trouble sleeping\ni'm not unsympathetic to that i get that\nit's hard to wake up but when you wake\nup\nwhat i need from you in a relationship\nis like for us to go on one date a week\nlike you decide when it is\nbut like\ni i need something and i recognize that\nsaying this stuff to you may hurt you\nmay feel may make you feel like you're\nworthless the point is i don't think\nyou're worthless\nand at the same time like\nwhat determines whether you're worthless\nis like what you end up doing when i\nshare this with you right i want you to\ncare about me and i want you to like try\nharder at making me happy in this\nrelationship because i want to be in the\nrelationship\nnow their their depressed mind could\nspiral out of control here and you can\nsay like if you're feeling really bad\nabout this i strongly recommend you talk\nto your therapist about it i'm happy to\ncome to your appointment too if you want\nthat you know we can talk about it in\nyour therapist's office but the the\npoint is that i care about this\nrelationship i love you i want to see it\nsucceed and i can't continue doing this\nforever\nright so like i want us to work on this\ntogether that's what this message really\nis it's not saying that you're\ninsufficient\nit's saying that i need your help\nand that's there's there's a big subtle\ndifference between once again supporting\nsomeone and taking responsibility and\nsaying you are not good enough and i\nneed your help\nand that's really the message that i\nthink you need to get across to like\nyour partner\nright which is that you can't carry this\nby yourself\nand even if they feel ashamed like\nthat's okay like there's some stuff that\ni imagine you can do\nand if you can't even do that like you\ntell me what you can do because i'm\ndoing everything that i can\nand the there's also other tricky things\nlike sometimes people just sort of\npassively go to\nyou know like\ntherapy and don't really do the work\nthere\nthere are also more drastic measures\nright like uninstalling wow like\noh my goodness\nand that's the really tricky thing is\nthat if you're if you're you know if\nyou're a partner and you're sort of\ndealing with a dual diagnosis situation\nlike sometimes you have to take drastic\nmeasures\nright and then then like you know if the\nperson says well like wow is the only\nthing that keeps me from being suicidal\nokay so like maybe you're not ready to\nuninstall wow yet but like i need you to\nbe in the kitchen i want to go on one\ndate a week like even if you don't enjoy\nit you know i need this from you\nand this is the last thing that i know\nsounds kind of devastating but\nyou know if the person isn't\nable to do like i would give it a year\nyou know it sounds like you're committed\nto this person so like i would give it a\nyear i would try to be patient but at\nsome point\nyou know i don't think that you have to\ncommit to being in a relationship with\nthis person\ni'm not saying you should break up with\nthem but i'm sort of saying that like if\nyou if this is the relationship that you\nwant then this is the relationship that\nyou're going to get\nand in my experience if you want to have\na healthy successful relationship it\ndemands change on both members of the\nrelationship over the course of the\nrelationship\nright it's not like you just change once\nit's like you have continuous change\nweek to week month to month year to year\nthe demands of the relationship change\nthe demands of the people change the\nneeds of the relationship change right\nthat's what that's what a committed\nrelationship is about it's not like\ngetting married\nbased on the circumstances today it's\nlike getting married and recognizing\nthat no matter what the circumstances\nare good or bad we're gonna work at it\nright and we're gonna find a way to\nfigure it out\nbut in order for a marriage to work it\ncan't just be all bad\nit has to be good and we're not talking\nabout marriage in this situation so i'm\njust sort of using that as a substitute\nfor a committed relationship\nbut if this has been going on for a year\nand a half like i don't know how much\npatience you've got left like your tank\nsounds like you're starting to run on\nempty\nright and then you're stuck in this\nrelationship because you feel guilty for\nabandoning them and then you resent them\nbut you don't allow yourself those\nfeelings of resentment and anger towards\nthem because they're ill\nand then you end up hating yourself\nbecause you're such an because\nyou feel frustrated towards someone\nwho's ill\nand then that eats the relationship on\nthe inside and it's not like it's dead\nanyway\nso people are saying oh my god like one\nyear is so generous like i get that\ny'all feel that way but i think that\nwhat i'm hearing from this person is\nthat they're very committed to trying to\nmake this work\nand i think that this is not something\nyou fix in six weeks\nright this is the kind of thing that\ntakes like a lot of time and a lot of\npatience\nand\nyou know i mean i tend to advocate for\ntrying to make things work as opposed to\njust moving on looking for something\nbetter but\nat the same time there's got to be some\nkind of limit right so like even in my\npractice i'll give people passes\nabsolutely i'll try to make things work\nbut if someone like repeatedly no shows\nafter we have these kinds of\nconversations it's not like a number\nbut like so for example generally\nspeaking i kind of think about like\nthree no shows in a row before i start\nto you know think about terminating with\nsomeone but then i also kind of\nacknowledge that depression can last for\na couple months and someone can have a\nreally bad month and so they're gonna\nmiss like three appointments in a row\nthat usually doesn't happen like that\nbut\nthey miss one appointment if they've\nfallen off the face of the earth they\ndon't make the next one right so it's\nreally only one missed appointment\nbut i think there's like we should be\npatient with people but we should also\nlike respect our own limits and\nboundaries right we're not we're not\ndivine\nwhere like we're an endless source of\npatience and furthermore i don't know\nthat an endless source of patience\nactually is the best thing for people\nso you don't want to be endlessly\npatient with your kids right like if my\nkid walks up to me and starts smacking\nme across the face i don't just want to\nlike\nallow them to do that behavior right i\nwant to teach them that you have to set\nlimits on stuff like there are\nconsequences for your actions\nand so in that same way what i'm sort of\ngetting the sense of is that based on\nyour love based on your guilt based on\nyour appreciation and respect for people\nwith mental health issues you've started\nto really start to take responsibility\nfor his well-being and when you've taken\nthe responsibility for his well-being\nhe's stopped taking responsibility for\nthe well-being and i don't know that\nthat's a great prognostic sign for the\nrelationship\nthe main caveat here really being the\ntimeline because if we're talking about\nthe the debilitation of clinical\ndepression that should end within about\na year right so there are other factors\nat play\nand i think that like ultimately the\nbest thing for the relationship is for\nyou to you know\nset some kind of limit ask for help\nand then like let him help you because\nonce he starts helping you\nyou can say thank you\nfor doing this\nand then he will feel good about himself\nright because right now there isn't even\nan opportunity for him to feel good\nabout himself\nso like\nask for something\nlet him do it and then express gratitude\nand appreciation so there are all kinds\nof things that like you don't have\naccess to in this relationship\nand it starts with with sort of like you\nknow setting some kind of limit\nhaving a conversation\nasking for something and letting him\nkind of step up to the plate\nand hopefully things work out you know i\nthink it sounds like he's lucky to have\nyou and this is where everyone sort of\nassumes that he she's not lucky to have\nhim where\ni think do we even know this is a woman\nwe just assume uh\nyeah we just i just had a\nheteronormative assumption there so\nmaybe it's a dude\num\nso\nyou know so like and\nthis person may be lucky to be dating\nthis per like this you know the person\nwho's suffering from depression we just\ndon't know\nyou"
