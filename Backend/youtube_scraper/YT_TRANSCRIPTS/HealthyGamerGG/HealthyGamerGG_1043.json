    "video_title": "I Used To Be Successful...",
    "transcript": "okay i used to be successful and now i'm\nnot\nso i feel absolutely shattered i'm 28\nyears old and it's like my career peaked\nfive years ago from ages of 23 to 25 i\ngot articles published in the wall\nstreet journal the huffington post in\nlos angeles times signed a book deal and\nhad a job writing a politics newsletter\nfor 30 000 subscribers working three\nblocks from the white house\nnow i struggle to make 20k a year and\ncan't find anyone willing to hire me\nthe company i worked for went under in\n2017 and we were all laid off i took\nsome remote writing jobs but they\nweren't a fit experimented with being a\nprofessional poker player for a while\nand now here i am trying to get back\ninto the job market and can't seem to\nbreak through i submit job applications\nlike it's a full-time job i've gotten a\nfew interviews and really\nclose to certain positions but they\nalways seem to pick a different\ncandidate at the final round\nmy self-esteem is rapidly diminishing\ni used to feel like i was unique and had\na lot to offer my whole life people told\nme i had all these talents and gifts\nsounding familiar chat but i feel i'm\nleft feeling entirely unwanted by the\nprofessional world\ni'm starting to seriously question if it\nwas all a lie if i'm so special why\ncan't i even get an email back\nemails emails emails all i do is send\nmother\nemails\ni'm getting cynical and sad\nstarting to feel like the job market is\na gamified scam like dating apps\npromising connections but mostly\nresulting in poor superficial matches\nand the only ones that work out are dumb\nluck i'm actually married now but all\nthese job rejections remind me of the\nmisery and rejections of dating apps i\nused to experience\none of us has got to be in the wrong\nhere either a the job market can't seem\nto recognize me as a motivated\nintelligent candidate or b i'm not\nnearly as special or accomplished as i\nthought i was in this rejection is\ncompletely deserved professionally\nspeaking i am worthless so i don't know\nif this is option b or this is a\nconclusion\nso this is unfortunately something that\nactually happens a lot to people\nso we've talked about gifted kids right\nso we've talked about people who are\ntold from a young age that they're\ngifted and talented\nand often oftentimes what we find is\nthat gifted kids run into a wall\nand when they run into a wall they\nreally start to struggle because their\nwhole sense of identity is built off of\nbeing gifted\nand how are the how do people tell them\nthat they're gifted why do people tell\nthem that they're gifted well that's\nbecause you know they um\nit's usually due to performance so like\nwhen i\nwrite you know the best essay in the\nclass in the seventh grade someone tells\nme wow you are a really talented writer\nand so i think oh okay so like my value\nas a human being is because i'm gifted\nand i'm gifted because i'm a talented\nwriter and then that kind of perpetuates\nright in ninth grade i write another\nreally good essay as well i'm gifted i'm\ngifted i'm gifted\nand then even sometimes with gifted kids\nthey start to flounder a little bit in\nin let's say high school because they\nhaven't developed study habits\nbecause they are actually like very\ntalented or very intelligent or\nsomething like that so you don't develop\nthe supporting skills which means that\nat some point you like hit a wall\nbecause either you can jump right over\nit\nor\nyou kind of run into it because you\nnever learned how to climb right so it's\neither like a full clear\nor like a full stop\nand so\nthat's where sometimes like we run into\nproblems in high school that's where i\nstarted to have problems i certainly had\nproblems in college and had to like\nlearn how to study and apply myself and\nthen we also see this kind of situation\nwhere people you know do really good and\nthen they may go to college and do well\nin college and then they like in their\nfirst phase of their professional career\nthey get like a lot of really\nprestigious\nthings right so wall street general\nhuffing huffington post l.a times signed\na book deal working three days three\nblocks from the white house\nand so then sometimes what happens is\nthat these people too so now like you\nsort of get that you know you're gifted\nright look at the look at the world look\nat the accolades that i have\nthat's how i know that i have value\nand then if something goes wrong like\nyou know if the company goes under in\n2017\nand then what happens is like since your\nsense of identity is built up through\nbeing gifted talented and your accolades\nthe moment your accolades go away the\nmoment your accomplishments go away your\nself-esteem goes with it\nso this unfortunately is a all too\ncommon experience and it absolutely\nsucks to go through and the good news is\nthat like just because you have been\nsuccessful in the past and are now\nhitting a wall\ndoes not mean that you don't have value\ndoes not mean that you aren't brilliant\nthe reason that we feel this way is\nbecause our determination of our\nbrilliance is based on external factors\nright so like our sense of our value as\na human being is based on the kind of\nrewards that the world gives us\nand so if you're in this kind of\nsituation this is actually a really\nreally good opportunity\nto like grow as a person and really\nstart to figure out like who you are and\nwhat you can be proud of that is\nindependent of what the rest of the\nworld appreciates\nso what i'd like to do is talk a little\nbit about this situation and sort of\nlike go into more detail okay\nso the first thing that we're going to\ndo is talk a little bit about the\npsychology of like what's going on with\nself-esteem right so i sort of explained\nsome of it now\num but\nso we're going to talk a little bit\nabout like how do we build ourselves up\nwhere does self-esteem come from how is\nit reinforced and then sometimes if if\nour karma if our circumstances change\nhow that can pull the rug out from under\nour self-esteem and then if that\nsituation happens where things aren't\nhunky-dory everything isn't fantastic\nnow\nhow can you start to go about the\nprocess of like getting your self-esteem\nback\nand how can you start the process of\nexploring where self-esteem truly comes\nfrom because self-esteem does not come\nfrom the washington post does not come\nfrom the la times does not come from\nworking three blocks from the white\nhouse self-esteem comes from the self\nthe problem is that this person does not\nhave self-esteem they have esteem they\nhave external esteem right so how do we\nstart to work on our self-esteem\nthe last thing that i'd like to talk a\nlittle bit about and this is something\nthat our community has been increasingly\nboth asking for and also appreciating is\nsome practical tips right so if we look\nat this post for a moment\nthere's a lot of like really practical\nstuff here so like emails emails emails\nso either the job market can't seem to\nrecognize me as a motivated intelligent\ncandidate or i'm not as accomplished or\nspecial as i thought\nso like we're going to talk actually a\nlittle bit about practicalities of like\nwhat does the job market actually look\nfor right and if you are someone who is\ntalented and has a real contribution to\nmake\ndoes the job market actually care about\nthat like when you're sending out\nthousands of emails to companies that\nare getting thousands of applications\ndo they really care about whether you're\ntalented gifted brilliant are they even\ngiving you a fair shake on that and what\ndo what do a job but what do employers\nactually look for like what's the\npurpose of a job application\nand so i'd like to end with a couple of\nalmost practical tips right so how can\nyou\nkind of start with psychology and then\nlike apply that to the practical steps\nthat you're gonna take going forward\nokay so let's get started\nso does that sound good\nokay\nso\num we're gonna start with sort of like\nthe psychology of esteem\nokay so let's go here\nso let's talk about the psychology of\nesteem so we kind of went through this a\nlittle bit kind of sort of a spoiler\nalert but\nhere's the first thing to understand so\nour sense of self-worth\ncomes from two places\nit can come from the outside\nor from the inside\nand the interesting thing is if you look\nat things like attachment theory the the\nreally interesting thing is that\noriginally when we're very young\nour internal sense of self-worth\nactually comes from the outside and this\nis like when we're super young like you\nknow because a child doesn't really know\nwhat is an accomplishment and what is\nnot an accomplishment so the way that\nwe're treated the way that we're valued\nwill sort of determine our sense of\nesteem\nso for example some children are are\ngiven conditional love\nso what this sort of means is like\nthe love and support and\nand uh reinforcement that i get\nactually has to do with like my\nperformance\nright so if i perform i'm loved and i'm\nvalued and i'm respected and some kids\nare given unconditional love\nand this is where like we can still\nappreciate performance\nbut the\nvalue that you bring as a human being is\nactually transcendent beyond your\nperformance\nso i'll give y'all just a a\nyou know we have transcendent value\nso i'll give y'all just a simple example\nright so oh you did like you did such a\ngreat job i'm so proud of you that's\nawesome i love it when you get a's\nyou're the smartest kid in the class\nyou're so gifted you're so awesome so\nyour value is based on getting an a\nbeing gifted being talented etc so we\nsee this a lot with gifted kids\nthe next thing like let's kind of use\nthe uh a kind of a different example of\nunconditional love right which is like\nlet's say i get a b so in the case of a\ngifted kid like why didn't you get an a\nyou need to study harder you need to\nwork harder you need to stop playing\nvideo games it's important to get an a\nget an a get an a get an a whereas if we\nhave sort of a\na situation where\nwe have unconditional love it's like\nit's okay to make mistakes\nand we care about you anyway right so\nit's sort of like saying like your value\nas a human being doesn't matter like\nwhether you get an a or a b i love you\neither way i really hope that you can\nstudy a little bit harder i'm gonna try\nto help you right it's not just your\nfault that you gotta be as a parent i\nrecognize that like if there's something\nthat you're not able to do maybe i have\na hand in that\nand so i sort of because because here's\nthe thing when it comes to gifted kids\nin conditional love\nthe success or failure is all theirs\nright they own it all\nit's your responsibility\nthere's a lot of self-reliance on\nimprovement so if it's like if it's a\nsuccess it's your success but if it's a\nfailure it's your failure whereas in the\ncases of unconditional love hopefully\nyou'll have parents who will sort of\nshare responsibility with you right hey\nit's not all your fault it's not like\nyou're an idiot because you gotta be\nmaybe i need to be doing better as a\nparent maybe i need to make sure that\nyou're doing your homework maybe i need\nto teach you something maybe i need to\ntalk to you about why school is hard and\nwhen you say say all of those things to\na child what the child sort of\nrecognizes is that the problem is not\njust here right there are all kinds of\nthese things like study habits\nparental support\nand the more that parents sort of\nacknowledge that this is responsible for\noutcomes\nthe easier it is to be assured of who\nyou are on the inside right this is a\nproblem that can be fixed it's not\nintrinsic value\nbased on like whether you got an a or a\nb\nso this is how things start so we'll\nsort of you know\nsome people will be raised this way some\npeople will be raised predominantly this\nway it's like oftentimes both right but\nthere's like it tends to be a mix of it\nand then when we sort of end up with\nconditional oven by the way there's a\nwhole video about that in dr k's guide\nif you all are interested\nthe problem of conditional love um then\nwhat happens is that we tend to be a\nlittle bit performance oriented\nright so we we can work hard we can be\nmotivated right because my value as a\nhuman being depends on my performance so\nin order to feel good i need to get an a\nright so when we sort of in that so\npeople will be very very motivated\nthey'll actually be very successful in\nthe case of conditional love because\nlike just think about it for a second\nin the case of conditional love whether\nyou get love or not is conditional and\ndo you want love do you need love is it\na basic human need absolutely so i'm\ngoing to try my level best to meet those\nrequirements right\nso these people tend to be very\nperformance oriented and then like this\ncan escalate so it starts with a's\nand then it's wall street journal\nthen it's\nbook deal\nright so each of these things that\nhappen and we can even look at this post\nwhen this person talks about you know\ntheir value as a human being\nthey don't say i wrote some really\nbrilliant articles\nthey don't say i wrote some stuff that\nis like beautiful prose\ni did some awesome investigative\njournalism i did some epic i did some\namazing political analysis\nright so they don't actually talk about\nthe value of their work\ndo you all see that what they talk about\nis the accolades of their work\nso there's no intrinsic value\nit's about how the value was received\nand once you do that\nthen suddenly this is not about what you\nwrote\nright it's how the world received what\nyou wrote\nso then what happens is your esteem\nis based on external factors\nand so what does that mean for us right\nthat means that if the world stops\nloving us\nor we stop getting like positive\nreinforcement from the world our esteem\nis going to go from it because our\nesteem is not internal it's not\nself-esteem it's external esteem\nright so like i'll give you all just a\nquick example so let's say that you know\na lot of people are concerned about\nthe way they look and how comfortable\nthey are in their body\nso you know and a lot of that is\ndetermined it's not actually like how\ncomfortable you are in your body and how\nokay you are with your appearance\npeople may assume for a moment that that\ncomfort depends on\nhow people treat you so if people call\nyou beautiful like surely that person\nwill be more confident the truth of the\nmatter is that that's not actually the\ncase\nright that you can have beautiful people\nwho are comfortable in their body and\nyou can have beautiful people who are\ninsecure about their looks and the\ninsecure people require external\nvalidation\nright so some like models for example\nmale or female or non-binary or whatever\nlike\nthey will require constant validation\nfrom partners friends whatever about how\namazing they look and the reason that\nthey they do that is because their sense\nof like pride in their appearance\nactually comes from the external world\nbecause you'll have some people who are\npretty average looking who are actually\nlike pretty content with the way they\nlook\nright they don't actually need external\nvalidation to make them comfortable in\ntheir own skin\nthey recognize i'm not the most\nbeautiful person on the planet i'm not\nthe ugliest person on the planet uh i do\nwhat i can you know i i get my hair done\nwell i try to exercise i try to you know\nbuy clothing that's flattering like i'm\ngonna like groom myself properly and\nlike i'm never gonna be a supermodel and\nthat's okay\nright so confidence is not actually\nabout\nthe way the world treats you and the\nproblem is that if you're someone who\nhas grown up gifted\nif you're someone who is performed\nand then the world stops giving you\nvalidation then there's a crisis of\nconfidence\nin that crisis of confidence is\ncharacterized by a loss of self-esteem\nbut once again\nit's not self-esteem right it's a loss\nof esteem\nand this is where you know the real\nantidote is to start to develop\nself-esteem\nand we'll get to the how in a second i\nrecognize it's not just just so develop\nself-esteem chat\nso and here's the thing that i want to\npoint out is that this person why\ndoesn't this person have self-esteem\nit's because they've never had they've\nnever needed it right so like our body\ndoesn't\nyou know my biceps aren't just like\nripped because i'm sitting around\nclicking the mouse\nmy biceps grow\nwhen i like exercise with them right so\nwhen i lift against a resistance\nmy body adapts by growing the muscle and\nour esteem is the same way so as long as\nyou've gotten\nlike\na lot of esteem from the external world\nyou will never need to have developed\nself-esteem\nright and so like this isn't an issue of\nlike you're a bad person or you're a\ngood person or you're\nyou know professionally worthless\nlike that's not what it's about it's\njust simply that\nthus far in your life you haven't really\nneeded to develop self-esteem because\nyou've gotten plenty of esteem from the\noutside world so your brain and your\nbody are very very economical so they're\nnot going to like waste time developing\nthings that are unused right so you like\nyou think about a child who's learning a\nlanguage like learning your first\nlanguage is incredibly critical because\nyou need to be able to communicate but\nonce you like learn a language it's not\nlike your brain is struggling to learn a\nsecond language right because now you\nyour needs are met and if your needs are\nmet there's no point in changing\nanything\nso then the question becomes you know\nhow do i start to develop self-esteem\nand so this is where i want to point out\nlike a couple of things that you can\nsort of do the first is to you know\ntrack back to where does your esteem\ntruly come from\nand so what i would ask this person is\nlike when you were riding high\nwhat were you proud of how did you know\nthat you were doing a good job\nand i know it sounds kind of weird but\neven that exploration that\nacknowledgement of like what made you\nproud what made you know that you could\nbring value to the world\nwas it what you wrote or the fact that\nyou were writing for the wall street\njournal\nright and the more that you sort of\nstart to ask you know like where did i\nderive value\nbecause here's the key thing so at the\nage of 23 to 25\nwall street journal\nwhite house\nla times\nright\nand then let's say 26 to 28 i think they\nare now right\nhow old are they\n28 yeah\nokay\nso from 20 26 to 28\nnone of those things\nso here's the thing if you want to build\nself-esteem here\nlet's say that your goal is to build\nself-esteem going forward\nthis is actually not the right place to\nstart because\nthe lack of self-esteem actually started\nhere\nright this is where you determined what\nyour esteem was based on so a lot of\npeople will say like okay in the present\nright so we advocate for doing stuff in\nthe present like we teach meditation and\nstuff so you can do all that stuff by\nall means we've gone into ahmgar and\nidentity and like how to discover who\nyou truly are and stuff like that\nbut i think the other thing so we're\ngoing to add on to that today\nthe other thing is that you have to go\nback to the past and try to figure out\nlike where did i build my self-esteem\nbecause oddly enough what you need to do\nis deconstruct\nyour esteem from here\nright because as long as your esteem is\ndetermined by external things\nlike there's not space for you to\ndevelop self-esteem\nso oftentimes when i work with people\nand i saw this a lot you know at\ndifferent institutions that are like\nvery very high performing right so like\ninvestment banks private equity firms\nlike places like goldman sachs and stuff\nlike that i'd have clients from those\nkinds of places and what i sort of\ndiscover is that the way that and they\nwould be like 30 let's say and they're\ncoming in they have a crisis of\nconfidence because they just got fired\nfor the first time in their life\nand they went to yale and then they went\ngot a mba from from yale and then they\nwent to you know wharton for this some\nother thing and then like so it's just\nlike success through and through\nand then 30 they get fired for the first\ntime or they get a bad performance\nreview or they don't get promoted and\nthen they're like spinning in the wind\nand the solution is to actually go back\nand actually deconstruct where your\nesteem originally came from right and\nthis is where you want to ask yourself\nlike you know where does my value come\nfrom here\nand hopefully what you can discover is\nthat it's not the la times that made you\ngood\nright the la times maybe a seal of\napproval absolutely but that's all it is\nright it's not the real value the real\nvalue is in what you wrote\nso like the reason that the la times is\npublishing your stuff it's not the la\ntimes that makes you good it's because\nyou are good that the la times will\npublish your stuff it's not the\naccolades are not\nthe reason you are good\nthey are a consequence of your good\nso this is where we're going to talk for\na second about karma\nor karma\nright so what comes first\nthe la times\ninto the good writing\nor the good writing\ninto the la times\nand this comes first\nso what part are you responsible for\nyou're responsible for this\nright\nso absolutely like once you start\nwriting for the la times maybe you get\nbetter and you have good editors and\nstuff like that and you improve so\nthere's like some amount of reciprocal\nstuff\nright but like the reason that you made\nit there is because you were writing\nreally well like you you know and sure\nthere's like a stepwise kind of thing\nwhere you did good in english class\nright english honors\nand then journalism at columbia\nand then you wrote your first piece for\nthe huffpo\nand then you wrote your next piece for\nthe new york times and you improved over\ntime like absolutely\nright and and did the new york times\nlook at your writing because you had\nwritten for huffpo sure\nbut here's the thing they may have\nlooked at it but the writing had to be\ngood like the new york times is not\ngoing to publish you just because you\nwrote for huffpo\nthe reason that the new york times is\ngoing to publish you is because like you\nwrote something good\nand so you're the truth is the more that\nyou tunnel down into\nhow the world gives you accolades the\nmore hopefully you come to the\nconclusion this is where i really\nencourage you to think about it\nare you actually a good writer\neven if you come to the answer no what\ni'll often times see with people that\ni've worked with is\nokay let's get better\nright because i know are you a good\nwriter and so sometimes people will come\nto this kind of conclusion they're like\nactually no i'm not a good writer but i\nhave written well in the past and that's\neven healthier\nlike you can't be a good writer or a bad\nwriter like the truth is that i am\ncapable of writing well and the neat\nthing is once you adopt that attitude\nit's like okay how do i get there again\nwhat did i do when i was writing for the\nla times how can i get better at this\nand so this all moves towards an action\norientation a growth mindset we've sort\nof talked a little bit about that on\nwednesday right so you all can watch\nthose vods and stuff if you want to\nand the last thing that i kind of want\nto point out and this is why i'm sort of\nbringing up karma\nis that now this person is in a\nsituation where let's assume for a\nmoment they're\ncapable of writing well\nright\nand so if people are not hiring you does\nthat mean i am bad\nso i want you all to think about this\nfor a second\nlet's say\ni am a\ngardener\nokay\nand i'm really good at garden i'm a\nskilled gardener\nand then what i have over here\nis very fertile soil\nright so a lot of good soil and then\nwhat i ever i have over here\nis a barren desert\num feeling minecraftish today with rocks\nokay\nso let's say that these are the two\noptions\nmy skill at gardening is the same\nwhen i plant seeds over here\nthey turn into plants when i plant seeds\nover here doesn't matter how many i\nplant\ndon't turn into anything\nwhat does that say about my skill as a\ngardener\nright so maybe even i'm really good i\ncan get a little bit of a plant here\nbut\nthis is the key thing that we sometimes\nforget\nright is that\nall we're entitled to as human beings\nare our actions and our outcomes don't\nnecessarily\ndetermine\nour skill\nso if you're like working in an\nenvironment where it sounds like this\nperson was at a you know company until\n2017\neveryone was laid off right so like\nlet's just think about that for a second\nlike\nit sounds like the company was doing\nwell but everyone got laid off so there\nmay be like industry-wide changes that\naffected journalism so i think\njournalism has been on the struggle bus\nfor a while right as an industry\nso like this used to be the thing where\nthe new york times would like have\nsubscriptions to the newspaper so they\nhad like revenue because people needed\nto read the newspaper and along came the\ninternet and like now things are behind\npaywalls and like\nyou know people used to have\nsubscriptions but people don't i don't\nknow how many people have subscriptions\nto the new york times anymore\nand so with things like the internet and\nthe free availability of information and\nthe transition to advertising and stuff\nlike that like the whole industry got\nchanged\nand so this company went under in 2017\num and so\nthen like\nyou know like\nthings changed\nso this is where you need to be careful\nso now we're going to kind of get to the\npractical side of things\nthe first thing is like so do all this\nstuff by all means\nbut then also recognize that just\nbecause you're not getting a job doesn't\nmean that you're bad at what you do\nright this has nothing to do with this\nteam there are karmic industry-wide\nphenomenon that may be happening which\nare essentially moving you in this\ndirection as opposed to this direction\nnow if the gardener works over here for\na while is not careful they will\nconclude that they are a bad gardener\nwhich may not be correct right it may\nnot be fair it doesn't mean that there\naren't things you can work on\nso now what we're going to sort of do so\ni i just want to set that frame because\ni think this is really really important\nthat your value doesn't necessarily have\nto do with the way that the world treats\nyou and this is where the person says\nlike i can't tell if i'm a talented\nwriter or not\nright so let's kind of just look at that\nfor a second\noh\nso let's look over here\num\nso getting cynical and sad either the\njob market can't seem to recognize me as\na motivated intelligent candidate or i'm\nnot nearly as special or accomplished as\ni thought right like either i'm a good\neither the the world can't see what i\nhave to offer or i don't have anything\nto offer which makes perfect sense right\nit's a very good question\nso let's talk a little bit about that\nso like when you're emailing emailing\nemailing\nthis is what you do all day every day\nwhat do people look for\nright so what does do emails\nand like submitting resumes and stuff\nlike does that\nlook for brilliance\nright so like when we do paper\napplications like let's think a little\nbit about it sounds like this person is\nemailing so i'm assuming they're\napplying to online jobs and what do\ny'all think an online\nemployer\nis looking for\nright so this is where as a society as\nwe become more outcome oriented which\nisn't necessarily bad right there are\nadvantages and disadvantages what we've\nstarted to do is use proxies\nfor\ntalent or skill\nbecause we we don't have like so here's\nthe thing i'm going to post a job\ni'm going to get 2 000 applications\ni don't have time to read 2 000 pieces\nof writing so what i'm going to do is\nstart to use substitutes start to use\ncordless which school did you go to\nwhere have you written in the past\nyou know\nso i'm going to use all these correlates\nfor brilliance because when you apply\nfor a job no one ever like if i'm\napplying to be like an engineer\nno one asks how much engineering do you\nknow\nright i mean they may ask in later forms\nof the interview but like generally\nspeaking at the application phase like\nno one is like do you understand\nengineering that's not a part of the job\ninterview it's like where have you\nworked before what was your gpa where\ndid you go to school and we use all of\nthose as proxies for skill\nso in this person's case like let's try\nto think a little bit about why this\nperson may be running into problems\nokay\nnew york times\nl.a times\nhuffpo\nprofessional poker player\nright\nso like imagine you're an employer\nlet's compare you to person number two\nlet's say\nsan antonio\nchronicle\nlet's say\nuh\nwhat's another\nflorida gazette\nand let's say huffpo\nwho are you gonna hire\nright\nit's like what what are you getting here\nso this person made it to final round\ninterviews so i'm also curious a little\nbit about the numbers game because it's\nthe other thing to understand about\nonline employers it's just a numbers\ngame\nright so if we if if i have like\n50 applicants for one position like what\nis the percentage chance\nthat i get a job offer it's like\nraw raw it's like uh two percent right\nbut\ni have 50 applicants but here's the\nthing if we look at a list of candidates\nthat go from 50 to one it's not like\neach of these people gets one\napplication right the the person who's\nat the top of the list is going to get\nlike 80\ninvitations and the person at the bottom\nlist is going to get 0\nand so as this person gets a job\nthen 49 number 49 will have an 80\nand the number 48 will have an 80\nright and so he goes out and then he\ngoes out or she goes out\nand so it's not like actually\nprobabilistically even across the spread\nbecause invitations\nget given to the people at the top of\nthe list\nand so the fact that the person has\ngotten a couple of interviews tells me\nthat this person should keep applying\nbecause like once you get to the\ninterview stage then you know you're\nyou're actually like a good applicant\nwhen people are interviewing you that\nmeans that what you have on your resume\nis sufficient for us to hire you now\nwe're going to try to get a feel for who\nyou are and this is where the psychology\ncomes back in\nbecause\nwhen you are this\nand when you\nare concerned about this\nwhen this is what's in your head when\nthis is what's in your head when this is\nwhat's in your head\nhow strong do you think you interview\nright so what is the purpose of an\ninterview let's we talked about emails\nfor a second\nthis is something that i don't know that\npeople have kind of explained so\noftentimes interviews are sort of about\nyou know they're kind of like skills\nassessments in a sense\nright so it's like oh you know it's a\nskills assessment let's see how\nbrilliant you are\nbut that's not just what interviews are\nabout interviews are incredibly limbic\nthey're incredibly empathic and\nincredibly like subsurface brain stuff\nright it's not like consciously it's\nlike you're going to meet people you're\nlike yeah i liked that guy\nall right yeah she was super cool\nthey were really awesome\nwhat is that what are people picking up\nwould that person be fun to work with so\ni remember when i was training in\nresidency like\nwe would have\nmedical students rotate through so these\nwere audition rotations so people wanted\nto do residency you know at this at this\nhospital so people would like come and\nthey'd like audition for a month and\nthey'd come and work there and some of\nthem were like brilliant on paper\nand then like you work with them and\nit's sort of like i remember asking\nquestions like my colleagues and i would\nask questions to each other and it's\nlike would you want to be supervising\nthis person overnight on call\nand for some people despite the fact\nthat they were absolutely brilliant on\npaper the answer was absolutely not\nthis person would be a nightmare to work\nwith\nright\nso that's where like understand that i\nknow it sounds kind of weird but like\ninterviews\nare not just skills assessments there's\nsome weird emotional limbic kind of\nstuff going on and that's where so\npeople may see like okay then am i\nscrewed and the answer is no absolutely\nnot you're not screwed because all you\nhave to do is like do this stuff right\nyou have to start to think through\nand recognize that actually you bring\nvalue to the table if you like you can't\nfake\nyou know maybe you can fake one article\nfor the huffington post\nbut if you've written for the la times\nnew york times huffington post and had a\npolitical newsletter that had 30 000\nsubscribers\nthere's something absolutely legitimate\nto what you bring to the table and if\nyou cannot access that in an interview\nthen your chances of interviewing are\ngoing to be like lower right\nso you can kind of fake it till you make\nit but i think the really awesome thing\nwould be like if you can really dig down\nand do the psychological work before you\ngo into the interview and recognize that\noh like this is actually my situation\nthat i'm actually a brilliant gardener\nand that you know i had really really\nfertile fields before and now it's like\nkind of barren like\ni struggled for a little bit right and\nthat's okay so this is the kind of thing\nwhere i would say like even in\ninterviews like i don't know what this\nperson says when they ask them like\nyou know um what were you what have you\nbeen doing for the last four years\nthey're like yeah i tried being a\nprofessional poker player\nand so this is where you could sort of\nsay something like you know i'd own it\nand i'd say something like\nyou know so i i wrote for the new york\ntimes washington post etc like i really\nenjoyed that kind of thing and then i\ntried doing some freelance writing but\nwhat i really realized is that like i\nlove writing collaboratively\nlike i can write but in terms of what\nreally gets me excited and what allows\nme to write pieces that are incredibly\ncompelling that move people is when i'm\nworking with a team or in some kind of\nenvironment that's like better structure\nlike the new york times or whatever you\nmake it make that up and what i'm really\nlooking for is that kind of environment\nbecause that's what allows me to write\nat my highest level\nand when you say something like that\nlike someone's across the other side of\nthe table it's like that's pretty good\nright\nyou can't\nit's you have to be able to\nauthentically own it so i don't think\nyou should\ni don't think you should lie everyone's\nsaying just lie no don't lie like this\nis why you do the introspective work\nso that you can say something\nauthentically\nright and when you say something\nauthentically what it's going to access\nis this weird like limbic stuff\nand when you can own it you're like yeah\ni tried some other stuff for a while but\nwhat i really discovered is i truly love\nwriting and i miss writing and this is\nactually what i want to do for the rest\nof my life and when you can own that\nright that that's what you should say so\nit's not just a lie\nwhat you should do is\nsay whatever you can own through the\nintrospective process\nokay\nright\nis there a couple of other things to\njust consider before we kind of wrap up\none is um\nyou know so i would also do a couple of\nthings one is get feedback\nthis is really important so if you're\nlike hitting your head against a wall in\nterms of applying for a job you know are\npeople reviewing your application\nwho's i mean presumably a pretty good\nwriter right but it can still be useful\nto have people like take a look at stuff\nand maybe this person has already done\nthat\nright so you can also get feedback from\nprospective employers\nyou may kind of strike out here but you\ncan even ask people hey so i noticed\nthat y'all went in a different direction\ncan you help me understand what the\nuh you know the person who got the job\nwhat did they have or what did you like\nabout them\nmore that than me\nright so what what were y'all looking\nfor that i was sort of lacking that\nsomeone else had and you may get some\nyou may not get any answer at all you\nmay get some vague answer like a\ncultural fit or things like that\num\nand and sometimes hopefully you'll find\nsomeone nice who will actually like give\nyou some information but you don't know\nuntil you ask\nso you can you can even try to so get\nfeedback from colleagues things like\nthat the other thing is when it comes to\ngetting feedback so if you have written\nfor the la times new york times\nhuffpo\nyou may know people there right so i\nwould ask them and say hey i'm trying to\nget back into writing and like the job\nmarket seems super rough\ndo you have any advice\nthis is where also kind of generic\nthings so networking\nso this is where like i think that if\nyou are someone who is brilliant but\njust has some kind of like yellow flag\non your resume\nright so i think this person fits this\nreally really well\nwhere\nsolid right here this is like\nyou know gold star level\nand this over here is like kind of a\nyellow flag\nso if you're someone like this this is\nwhere you make the the emails and the\nresumes are not going to be your\nstrongest showing potentially right it\ndepends on writing cover letters and\nthings like that\nso this is where like i i'd really try\nhard to network and people may be like\nwhat is networking we may do some some\nvideos about that or something like that\nsoon\nbut this is where like because\nultimately what you want to do is\ndevelop human relationships because\nhuman relationships are still really\nreally important in terms of like\ndecision making and who we hire right so\nthis is where i i'd consider like\njoining a professional organization so\npeople like what are the basics of this\nlike join a professional organization\ni know people sometimes hate this\nthing but linkedin is actually can be\nreally good\nright so you like like how is your\nlinkedin profile like what's going on\nthere\nand this were like just meet people and\nthis is where you don't necessarily want\nto\num and so when people are saying you\nknow that's why i say join a\nprofessional organization because a\nprofessional organization will have\nevents\nthat you go to and you try to like learn\nwhatever you need to learn there and\nyou'll meet people as a result\nbecause i think the problem is that the\nemail situation is where there's like\nit's just a thousand faceless applicants\nso which faceless applicant looks the\nwho's the prettiest who has the\nprettiest face and a pile of people\nwithout faces\nright so that's what's that's the\ncompetition you've gotten if you're kind\nof non-traditional like you want people\nyou want to meet people if you can\nlast thing that i'll sort of say is that\nyou know if you are running into a brick\nwall we kind of this is a little bit\nabout feedback as well but\num\nuh\nyeah we talked a little bit about\ngetting feedback so you can also use\nthese connections in terms of networking\nso if you know anyone at the la times if\nyou had an editor or something like that\neven if it's been a couple of years they\nmay remember you so i reach out to them\nright so pull on your network\nand say hey like you were my editor for\none or two years or even if you've got\nrelationships like if from people at\nschool like you can even email\nprofessors and stuff you kind of can\nkind of ask them like hey this is the\nsituation i'm in what would you\nrecommend\nlast thing that we're going to talk\nabout is is\nyou know running into a wall\nso we talked about feedback but i'm just\ngoing to give you all kind of a simple\nexample so let's say that i'm trying to\ndate\nand despite\nmany dating apps and a couple of first\ndates right so tons of emails few\ninterviews\nthousand emails\nten interviews\nthousand dates\ni mean sorry thousand\nmatches\nten dates\nzero second dates\nso this is why feedback is really\nimportant because like sometimes the\nproblem here is that like you've got\nbody odor\nright so there may be something going on\nthat you're not aware of\nbut which is heavily heavily influencing\nyour outcomes\nright so i'm not trying to be insulting\nhere but like that's just the best\nexample i can kind of think of where\nthere may just be something that you're\nmissing\nso like you just didn't realize that\nmaybe you know you've got some bo\nand similarly here there may be\nsomething in this process either in the\nway that you interview or the way that\nyou do your resume\nlike that you just aren't aware of and\nit's not your fault and this is the kind\nof thing where it's like okay just put\non deodorant the problem's fixed it's\nnot like\nyou know bo is just it's what i thought\nof i recognize it's kind of\ninsulting in a sense but this is the\nkind of thing where like you know having\nworked with people who have had body\nodor having had body odor myself when i\nwas like 13 years old and before i\nunderstood deodorant this is like\nsomething that i struggled with or i was\nlike oh my god i didn't realize like one\nof my friends was kind enough and was\nlike hey man you stink\ni was like what is that because like i\ndidn't know right like i hit puberty and\nlike i started my body started changing\nand i didn't really realize like that i\nsmelled bad\nand so then i\nit's just something you got to learn\nright and i like i thank that dude\nto this day it's like one of the best\npieces of feedback that i've gotten\nso there may be some simple mistake\nyou're making but unless you ask people\nlike you don't really know\nright so just to kind of summarize\nit's unfortunately very common\nthat people used to be successful and\nnow they're not so if we look at these\npeople like the general profile is that\nthey're told from a young age oftentimes\nthat they have all these talents and\ngifts\nand sometimes what they do is they hit a\nwall in terms of like school or college\nwhere where you know they didn't never\ndevelop study habits so they like go\nfrom straight a's to like c's and then\nf's and then don't know what to do but\nwhat's just as common or even more\ncommon is that we end up with this sort\nof situation where they're actually\nsuccessful right so they have\nprestigious accomplishments and things\nlike that\ntotally fine\nand then something happens where\nunfortunately\nthey move from fertile soil\nin lots of progress to barren soil where\neven though their skill\nas a writer or gardener is the same the\nresults that they get start to change\nand when the results start to change\nthey start to lose self-esteem\nbecause when it comes down to\nself-esteem we get our self-esteem from\nthe outside world or inside world and\nit's not even self-esteem their sense of\nesteem comes from external accolades and\nwhen you take the external accolades\naway your esteem goes with it\nso this is where you need the process of\nsort of discovering self-esteem right\nyou never needed to before because the\nrest of the world told you how awesome\nyou are so you never needed self-esteem\nso how do you do that process\nyou start by actually deconstructing\nyour old sense of esteem\nwhere did i do where when i thought i\nwas the hottest [ __ ] in the world where\ndid i derive that sense of value from\nright where does my value come from and\nhopefully through that process what\nyou'll sort of discover is that the la\ntimes\ndoesn't make you a good writer but it's\nthat because you were a good writer that\nthe la times picked up your stuff to\nbegin with so the value is inherent in\nyour work and it's just the external\nworld that sort of gave you the approval\nand once you sort of figure that out\nthen you can approach things with\nconfidence\nand when you go into interviews\nthe limbic response that people limbic\nmeans emotional\nlimbic system is what governs our\nemotions the emotional response people\nare going to give to you in interviews\nif you're confident in yourself since\nyou've done that work since you've\ndeveloped some self-esteem is going to\nbe very different and allow you to sort\nof succeed more\na couple of other practical tips you\nknow if you're running into trouble sort\nof moving forward you can always get\nfeedback\nright ask people to review your\napplications maybe even feedback from\nemployers you can reach out to old\nconnections and sort of share your\nsituation with them and see if they have\nany suggestions see if they know anyone\nwho's looking for a writer because a\npersonal recommendation goes a long way\nyou can join professional organizations\nor do stuff on linkedin related to\nnetworking i know like people are like\nuh networking the truth is sometimes it\nmatters and why is that it's because if\nyou're sort of a non-traditional\napplicant\nor you've got a yellow flag because you\nhaven't been writing for the last four\nyears\nthe email application is not going to be\nthe best way to showcase who you are and\nput your best foot forward so that's why\nin person stuff matters more you need\npeople to look past some of these things\nin your application to recognize that\nthere's someone really valuable\nunderneath and that happens in person\nquestions\nwhat if there's not somebody valuable\nbehind the cv that's exactly my point is\nthat\nyour sense of value is not determined by\nthe cv right so this is where you know i\nbelieve all human beings have value i\nthink each and every one of you has\nsomething to contribute to the world\nand i didn't come to that conclusion\njust because i'm like\ntry to be a good person and see the\npositive i genuinely think that so let\nme like make a case\nfor a second\nso if we think about the contributions\nthat people come up with let's talk\nabout innovation for example\nso innovation\nrequires a certain set of experiences to\nhappen right so if we think about the\nwright brothers\nthere's a certain constellation of\nexperiences they had\nthat\ncreated the opportunity for them to\ninvent the airplane\nyou can't have the wright brothers today\nbecause the airplane's already been\ninvented that boat has sailed\nand if that's sort of true what that\nmeans is that each and every one of you\nhas a completely unique circumstance\nright you have a completely unique set\nof\nexperiences background\nthe times you live in today the age you\nare what you've done what you haven't\ndone\nyou your experiences and the neurons in\nyour brain are capable of creating\nsomething that is statistically\nimpossible for someone else to make\nbecause no one else knows exactly what\nyou know and has lived exactly what\nyou've lived\nand when we think about innovation and\nwhere like understanding and stuff comes\nfrom it's like from what we've learned\nright so if i've read these 10 books i'm\nable to form these 10 conclusions if\ni've read a different 10 books i will\ncome to different 10 conclusions\nand so this is the key thing this is\nwhat i sort of figured out in my life is\nlike\nyou know like my contribution to the\nworld is based on the opportunities that\ni was given\nand the same is true for all y'all as\nwell and you may think like oh but what\ncan i possibly contribute all i do is\nyou know playing games all day and like\ni'm someone who failed out of college\nbecause i was grinding diablo 2 in\nwarcraft 3.\nand like i still found a contribution\nand so can you\nright it's just thinking a little bit\nabout like like i really do believe this\nand this is why i like even when we kind\nof talk a little bit about you know\npeople who come on stream each person\nwho comes on stream has a unique\nperspective\nand what we do is like share that\nperspective\nand we can all benefit from it right\nyou"
