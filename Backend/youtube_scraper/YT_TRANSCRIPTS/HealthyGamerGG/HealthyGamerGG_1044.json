    "transcript": "right so then what do you need you need\nsomeone else to save you because you\ncan't save yourself because you're a\nchild trapped in an adult's body because\nyou should have grown up by now because\nyou should be smarter you should be more\ncapable you should not be so lazy you\nshouldn't be paralyzed to action\ni feel like i am a child in an adult's\nbody\ni would like to begin and start that\ni've had a hard time debating whether or\nnot i should make a post\nreally glad you did if you're\nrich pa is out there listening to this\ni'm very glad you made the post\ni feel that my issues problems are in a\nway inferior compared to other people my\nage have we heard that before\ni'm 19 years old and i'm a little behind\non education which wasn't my fault as\nthe college messed up my application\nwhich leads me to being in a class with\nsome people being three years younger\nthan i\ni haven't had a job yet nor have i had\nreally any adult experiences and this\nmakes me feel embarrassed and ashamed if\nfor example what i'm doing in my life\nright now\nand yes i have an anxiety disorder of\nsome sort realistically gad\nself-diagnosed\nwe'll get to that in a second\nmy point is i fear this adult world i\ndon't see it at\ni don't see almost worth living\ni felt suicidal for some periods and\ndepressed and i'm not satisfied with my\nlife i've used gaming for example to\nescape this reality but as the older i\nget the closer i feel to this impending\ndoom\nhowever i recently learned that i have\nanother way that i escape reality i\ninvest into other people\nbasically i've been dating women from\ntime to time and i suppose not wanting\nto be alone\ni'm someone very passionate and\nunfortunately it's a weird way to word\nthis but i kind of direct my passion\ntowards the other person and invest time\ninto them\nsadly this is unhealthy for me and also\nmost likely for them too\nthe idea of having a job scares me in\ngeneral especially with my lack of\nskills and anything practical\nbut not only that i don't think i would\nbe practically beneficial to the\nworkplace because because i have this\nseparate kind of physical anxiety\nthat\nworks a bit like a panic anxiety but\nalso pretty much subconsciously present\nwhich i don't really want to get into\nokay\ni've always wanted to feel like being\nsaved but that someone would basically\nhelp me get stuff done this is kind of\nembarrassing to talk about i've always\nfelt alone and that i have nobody to\ntalk to about these things i'm not close\nto my parents people i've been close to\nare now busier than because life and\nthey grew up and i haven't i lived\nalmost the same way\nfor a long period of time now and i feel\nlike i need to do something about it but\ni feel paralyzed\nit's like there's always a but\ni'm i'm\ni'll gladly appreciate any advice and\nthank you for reading so thank you for\nposting\nthere's a lot of good stuff in here\nokay\nso sometimes in life\nwe\nfall a little bit behind\nwe start to feel that we're inferior to\npeople around us\nwe start to feel like we kind of screwed\nthings up\nand then something else can happen where\nwe start to lose hope in the world we\nstart to feel like maybe life isn't\nworth living\nsometimes that gets to the level of\nhaving some suicidal thoughts maybe\nfeeling depressed\nand something else can happen as well\nwhich is that we start investing in\nother people\ninstead of working on ourselves\nso what energy we do have\ngoes towards benefiting others instead\nof pulling us up\nbecause when we start to invest in\nourselves what tends to happen is like\nsomething gets in the way\nright we sort of feel like ah but i\ndon't feel like doing this\nand we don't really feel capable of\nhelping ourselves\nand then we even can start to fantasize\nthat given how bad my situation is given\nhow long i've been in this situation the\nonly hope for salvation is to get\nsomeone to help me right because i can't\ndo it myself\nso\nhow should we understand this\nright because this is like a really\nreally important post\nso the first thing that i want to talk a\nlittle bit about\nis this whole business of\nself-diagnosing generalized anxiety\ndisorder panic attack suicidal ideation\netc\nso this is the kind of thing where you\nknow if you if you're trying to do\nsomething in life\nand you feel like some stuff like this\nis getting in the way\nyou should absolutely go get a mental\nhealth evaluation\nso people are trying to figure out like\nso just i'll share some basics about\nthis okay so how do you know whether\nsomeone has an illness or doesn't have\nan illness as a clinician how do you\ndecide okay is this like\njust the emotion of anxiety or does this\nride to the level of rise to the level\nof generalized anxiety disorder and the\nkey thing the key hallmark of all\npsychiatric diagnoses is impairment to\nfunction\nso when it starts to affect your life\nwhen it starts to get in the way of\nthings\nthat's the threshold of a disorder\nbeing sad is not clinical depression\neven being some degree of hopeless is\nnot clinical depression\nthe threshold of clinical depression and\nthat's major depressive disorder bipolar\ndisorder schizoaffective there are all\nthese different diagnostic criteria but\nthe key thing that we look for is like\nis it actually a disorder is it\ndisordering your life is it impairing\nyour function\nand so if you're someone who's kind of\nstuck and you think you may have\nsomething going on\nand you're struggling to move forward\nthe first thing to recognize is like\nget that evaluated and hopefully fixed\nso mental illness is no different from\nphysical illness it's like oh i have\ntrouble riding my bike and i'm afraid\nthat my leg may be broken\nand it's like what's the first piece of\nadvice you would give that for well like\nmaybe you need to like\nnot have a broken leg because that's\ngoing to fundamentally impair anything\nthat you try to do\nright so if you're in this kind of\nsituation in the strongest way possible\nlike please go get a mental health\nevaluation right it's their job it's not\nyour job to self-diagnose gad or\ndepression or anxiety or suicidality\nright so if you're also having suicidal\nthoughts like go see a mental health\nprofessional\nbecause they're there to figure out okay\nyou do have gad you don't have jd oh\nmaybe you have this thing and you never\neven realized\nso i've had like patients that i've\nworked with that\nyou know think they're depressed and\nwhat it turns out is they have like\nhypothyroidism\nwe just start them on thyroid medication\nand like their problem is literally\nfixed\nas long as they take their levothyroxin\ntheir mood is perfectly normal it's\nbecause they actually have a hormonal\ndeficiency which is measurable through a\nlab test\nso this is where the first thing you\nshould do if you're concerned about this\nstuff is go see an actual like licensed\nprofessional\nthat being said there are a couple of\nother things that i'd like to talk about\nthe first is this idea of being behind\nright and feeling like a child\nso let's talk for a moment about\nyou know what does it mean to be an\nadult and what does it mean to be a\nchild\nand then the next thing that we want to\ntalk a little bit about is like as we\nstart to feel inferior and lose faith in\nourselves like how does that affect our\nego how does that affect the way that\nour mind works and why do we invest into\nother people\nand the last thing is like just\ngenerally speaking thinking about how to\nmove forward from here from sort of a\nlife perspective\nso the first thing that i want to talk\nabout\nask you all this question is what's the\ndifference between an adult and a child\nhow do you become an adult\nright\nso oftentimes\nan adult is in essence a legal\ndesignation right so we say for example\nin the united states\nthat when you're 17 years old and you've\nbeen set\non this earth for 17 years and 364 days\nyou are a child you are a minor\nand when you've been on this earth for\n17 years and\n365 days you become an adult\nwhat do y'all think about that\nright so at least in the u.s like even\nbeing an adult is like sort of a weird\nfluid thing\ncan you join the army at 18 yes\ncan you buy a bottle of beer no\nright so we even delay some of the\naspects of adulthood till 21.\neven in the united states for example i\nthink you can be on your parents health\ninsurance so as a child you can be on\nyour parents health insurance until like\nthe age of 26 or something i don't know\nthe exact number\nso when it comes to like the faculties\nof adulthood like 18 years old 18 year\nolds like maybe they need to start\nfiling i don't think you even\nnecessarily need to file taxes maybe i\ndon't i don't know the details on that\nbut if we really think about all the\nfaculties of an adult like they don't\nmagically it's not like if you're 19\nyou're like sure you may be like\nlegally designated as an adult but\nbiologically you know you're not that\ndifferent from a 18 year old or 17 year\nold\nthis is where we talk about i've seen\nsome people sort of mention this so\nfrontal lobe development is a really\ngood example\nso we have this part of our brain called\nthe frontal lobes the par the frontal\nlobes are the part of our brain that\nplan and execute tasks\nso when i think about like oh i need to\nget a job\nthat can be overwhelming for some people\nand as we get older as we get mature so\nthere's also this like aspect of\nmaturity right what's the difference\nbetween an adult and a child it's\nmaturity\nwell it's a is a 18 year old as mature\nas a 28 year old no\nright we all sort of know that\nso what does that mean maturity so like\nwe all understand it instinctively but\npractically what maturity boils down to\nin a neuroscience perspective\nis like frontal lobe development that's\nthe simplest it's an oversimplification\nbecause you can't boil anything down\nwhen it comes to the brain but\nyou know simplification is that if you\nthink about maturity a five-year-old a\n15-year-old a 25 in a 35 year old will\nall be different levels of mature and\nwhat's different between a 25 year old\nand a 35 year old it's the development\nof the frontal lobes\nso what are the frontal lobes there for\nwhat do they do the first is that they\nplan and execute tasks\nso when someone says something like\nyou know\num\ni've lived almost my\nexact\nsame way for a long period of time i\nfeel like i need to do something but i\nfeel paralyzed it's like there's a but\nall you know there's something getting\nin the way like the inability to\ninitiate tasks could have to do with the\nfrontal lobes\nso the frontal lobes are what like break\ndown tasks and like get us to do stuff\nso like when i'm 19 it's harder to do\nthe dishes than it is when i'm 29.\nsimple example right not precisely true\nthere may be some people who it's very\neasy to do at 19 may be harder when\nyou're 29\nright so but generally speaking like\nit's easier to do stuff the older that\nyou get when it comes to like boring\ncrap\nand why is that it's because the frontal\nlobes also govern impulse control\nso our susceptibility to impulses if you\nthink about a 14 year old versus a 24\nyear old what's different the 14 year\nold is more impulsive a four year old to\na 14 year old the four year old is more\nimpulsive\nso the ability to initiate the right\nkind of behavior as well as restrict the\nwrong kind of behavior is all governed\nby the frontal lobe\nnow here's the thing the frontal lobes\nfinish developing around the age of 30.\ni personally believe there's no science\nbehind this i personally believe that\nfrontal lobe development is being\ndelayed in our society\nso what i'm noticing and it just this\ncould be a\nselection bias this may just be the\npeople that i end up seeing and talking\nto\nis that like frontal lobe development is\nlike getting a little bit delayed\nthat the independence that we used to\nsee a hundred years ago from an 18 year\nold is less than the independence that\nwe see from 18 year olds today\nthere's no data to support that there\nmay be data it's not something i've seen\nit's just an observation an anecdotal\nobservation\ni suspect that we may be delaying\nfrontal lobe development we may actually\nbe fully delayed around 32 33 34\nactually\nall right so i know in my experience\nlike i wasn't a real adult until like i\nwas like 30 to be honest\nthat's when i really started becoming an\nadult in a lot of ways\nso the first thing to understand is that\nif you feel like a child in an adult's\nbody like that's sort of true there\nisn't a child an adult is not binary\nit's not like suddenly on your 18th\nbirthday legally sure\nyou become an adult in that moment but\nbiologically like there's no difference\nor i mean there's a tiny amount of\ndifference right there's just your\nneurons are one hour different\nbetween 17 and 18. it's not like some\nmagical transformation that's binary\nfrom child to adult your brain is\nbasically the same when you're 17 years\nand 364 days old in 17 years and 365\ndays old\nright the brain is basically the same\nso\ncut yourself some slack recognize first\nof all that it's like you know being an\nadult is not\nit's not like you're magically becoming\nan adult like biologically\nneuroscientifically at the age of 19.\nthe next thing to understand is that\npeople have their own developmental pace\nright so life actually i mean sometimes\npeople we think of life as a race\nbut people just develop differently\nright so some people start puberty at\nlike 10.\nsome people start puberty at like 14.\npeople just have like biologically like\nour biological clocks are not all the\nsame\nsome people will start to have gray hair\nat the age of 28. some people have gray\nhair at the age of 58.\nour biological clocks are just unique\nbased on our genetics and environmental\nfactors and all kinds of stuff that's\ntrue of our developmental trajectory as\nwell like not everyone is a hundred\npercent focused and has fully developed\nfrontal lobes at the age of 21. like\nsome people have very highly developed\nfrontal lobes at the age of 21. i was\nnot one of those people\nand that's okay\nso now\nso that's sort of a quick segment about\nlike if you're 19 and you feel like\nyou're a child like you may be in some\nways and that's actually perfectly fine\nit doesn't mean that you're doomed for\nthe rest of life\nso where do people get this idea that\nnow i'm screwed\nso this comes from comparison right so\nthis is what happens when we start to\nfeel bad about ourselves\nour mind\nour mind's ego activates so when i start\nto feel inferior\nthat's an emote that's an emotion that i\nexperience or shame let's say and then\nour ego activates and our ego starts to\nmake comparisons this is sort of the\nvedic model of the mind\nthe tricky thing is that the comparisons\nthat we make\nsort of reinforce\nour feelings\nso i'll give you all just an example\nthat i tend to use fairly often which is\nyou know if i've just been dumped by my\ngirlfriend and i'm feeling bad about\nmyself at two in the morning what am i\ngonna do i'm gonna log on to her insta\nand see all the pictures of her having\nfun with other people\ni felt bad about myself before\nand my mind is gonna seek confirmatory\nthings\noutside of that right and then if\nthere's a picture of her with another\nguy my mind is going to make all kinds\nof comparisons\nright what the hell is going on there\nlike why does it torture me\nright why do our minds torture us with\nanxiety with with these kinds of things\nbecause that's sort of the function of\nthe ego the ego is looking to make sense\nof the world\nright so the way that i feel needs to be\nmirrored in the outside world\nso if i'm feeling a little bit insecure\nand i'm like oh i want to believe i'm\ni'm\nattractive i want to be believe i'm\nattractive i want to believe i'm a good\nperson let me turn to the outside world\nto give me that confirmation because i\ndon't believe it for myself\nthe problem is that there are all kinds\nof things that you are good at right\nlike so any 19 year old like sure you\nmay be a couple years behind in terms of\nschooling and stuff sounds like it\nactually wasn't your fault because\nsomeone screwed up an application\nbut your mind doesn't think that way\nright\nlike mind doesn't think that way that's\nnot\nwhat it does\nwhen you're sort of feeling bad about\nyourself your mind doesn't try to come\nup with reasons to convince you you're a\ngood person it actually does the\nopposite it seeks out stimuli and makes\ncomparisons that make that reinforce\nwhat you already believe about yourself\nand then what happens like so now let's\ntalk a little bit about if you're\nsomeone who invests in other people\ninstead of yourself\nso once you feel behind\nonce you feel like you're inferior once\nyou feel like you're a child in an\nadult's body\nright so like you should have grown up\nby now but you haven't\nand you're afraid that you never will\nare you worth investing in\nare you worth effort\nwhat's going to happen to effort that\nyou put into you\nright what's going to be the return on\ninvestment the roi if you work on\nyourself\nif you believe that you're inferior and\nyou're a man child\nand you're behind and you're surrounding\nyourself by 16 years i mean you're\nsurrounded by 16 year olds what happens\nis the mind naturally sort of concludes\nright because you're like kind of not\nyou can't fix yourself like\nyou're it's not going to be it's never\ngoing to be enough\nso what do you end up doing you invest\nin other people\nbecause they're worth saving if i try to\nhelp someone else like they can actually\nachieve something but i can't\nand so then what happens is you start\ndirecting your energy towards other\npeople and sometimes in the worst cases\nyou even start living vicariously\nthrough them\nno you absolutely should apply for that\njob you should do it you should do it\nyou should do it don't don't be a wuss\nright take chances\ni faith in you\nand you push them\nbecause you're trying to solve a problem\nin here\nbut this problem is unfixable because\ni'm a child in an adult's body gg\ngg no re\ngo next but not for you now i'm gonna\nobserve\ni'm gonna watch my friend play and i'm\ngonna tell them what to do\nbecause i'm hopeless\nso that's where we see that kind of\nbehavior come from\nand now we get to\nthis part\nright\nwhich is\num\nyeah\ni've always wanted to feel like being\nsaved and that someone would basically\nhelp me get stuff done\nso where does that come from and that\ncomes from the same place as helping\nother people which is that\ninvesting in myself is going to be\ninsufficient\nthat's why i have to invest in other\npeople because it's like waste of time\nbecause like the roi is way too low\nright so then what do you need you need\nsomeone else to save you because you\ncan't save yourself because you're a\nchild trapped in an adult's body because\nyou should have grown up by now because\nyou should be smarter you should be more\ncapable you should not be so lazy you\nshouldn't be paralyzed to action\nso you need some savior\nand that's what you look for because you\ndon't believe you can save yourself\nand this becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy because where are you investing\nyou're investing in other people\nis someone going to come along and save\nyou maybe if you're lucky maybe maybe\nyes maybe not\nbut as you stop working on yourself and\nyou start investing energy in other\npeople you sort of propagate this idea\nthat the only person that can save you\nis someone else because you're not\ntrying to save yourself at that point\nright you've given up on yourself so the\nonly that that becomes true\nand then like logically like it becomes\nconsistent\nand you start to believe it oh see like\ni\ni no one has showed up yet and i'm still\nin this situation therefore\ni can't fix it\nit's kind of tricky it's very tricky\nand it all comes down to the ego\nright it all comes down to this\nperception that i'm a child in an\nadult's body\nit all comes down to this idea that\nsince i'm in this state i'm screwed\nwhereas the simple truth is that you're\nnot screwed\nthe simple truth is that you are in this\nsituation\nchances are because of some contribution\nof yours or lack of contribution of\nyours that you invest all of your energy\nin helping other people and then you\nwonder why you're still there and of\ncourse you need to be saved by someone\nelse\nright like if i'm\nif my house is on fire and someone\nelse's house is on fire and i spend all\nof my water putting out their fire i\nneed someone else to put out my fire\nbecause i'm not putting out my own fire\nmyself\ndo i have the water yes\nbut i'm using all my energy externally\nand so this kind of becomes a cycle\nso what to do about it the first thing\nand this is why we kind of started with\nthe the brain stuff is to recognize that\nthis perception that you are a child in\nan adult's body is false it's like not a\nreal thing\nso are you behind other people your age\nsure\nbut you're also ahead of other people\nyour age right like statistically\nthey're going to be 19 year old 19 year\nolds who like dropped out of school like\nfive years ago\nthey're gonna be 19 year olds who it\nsounds like you're in relationships from\ntime to time that are going to be 19\nyear olds who have never been in a\nrelationship or never date\nand don't even try to help other people\nbut does your mind compare you to them\nno of course not that's absurd\nright the mind only makes the\ncomparisons that it wants it needs to to\nreassure itself of what it already\nbelieves\nand so this is sort of like a tricky\nsituation but it's like totally okay\nbecause\npeople development\njust biologically people develop at\ndifferent ages it's like not all the\nsame\nand it's not even necessarily that\nthere's evolutionary advantage to\ndeveloping early like i don't know that\nthat's true in any shape way shape or\nform in fact if you kind of look at\npeople having different developmental\nages that probably suggests that there's\na there's a selection within that window\nbut like whether you hit puberty at 10\nor 14 there's really no selection\npressure over one over the other\nright you could sort of assume that but\nthat also i'm not 100 sure you know\ni i you know there may be people who are\nexperts on the evolution of\nadolescent development that disagree\nwith that know more about that than i do\nso what do you do about this the first\nis to recognize that\nall of this stuff is like a conclusion\nthat your mind comes to without\nnecessarily being true\nright that you believe that you are a\nchild in an adult's body which is like\nit's totally fine to be exactly where\nyou are there's nothing wrong with you\ncould you do things better sure could\nyou work a little bit harder maybe\nare you a little bit too paralyzed\npossibly i'm not saying that you're\nperfect right but you are where you are\nyou're not fundamentally busted\nsecond thing is especially in the case\nof\nreal clinical mental health issues\nif you do have generalized anxiety\ndisorder or suicidal ideation or things\nlike that and like your those are active\nclinical illnesses that you're\nexperiencing that can explain a lot of\nthis stuff\nand it's amazing i mean i don't\nprescribe antidepressant medication to\nall of my patients with major depressive\ndisorder but like for some of them it\njust works amazing like it transforms\ntheir life they\nlive like normal people afterwards\nright that we see that sometimes with\nantidepressants generally\nyou know your mileage may vary\nabsolutely you need to talk to your\ndoctor about that that's the whole\npurpose behind having a doctor right is\nthat they can make a tailored\nindividualistic determination about what\nyour needs are\nthe last thing is to recognize this\nwhole thing that as long as you keep\ninvesting in other people like you need\nto really think about why do i not feel\nlike investing in myself\nit's good to help other people don't get\nme wrong\ni'm not saying stop helping other people\nbut why do you think you can't invest in\nyourself\nand really explore that try to figure\nout why do i believe that i'm not worth\ninvesting in which is what i sort of\nread between the lines of this post is\nthat i'm not worth investing it\nand the other magical thing that will\nhappen is once you sort of explore that\nhopefully you will start investing in\nyourself\nand once you start investing in yourself\nand you start to see progress you will\nrealize that you do need to be saved and\nyou are actually right the only\ndifference the only thing you didn't\nrealize\nis the person who needs to save you is\nactually you\nyou're the one who's gonna do the saving\nand once you come to that realization\nthen like life is a wide open field\nthen you're empowered\nthen you can do what you want right\nbecause you're the one who saved you\nyou're the one who actually had the\npower to do it\nyou want to get some help along the way\ntotally all for that right maybe\nsometimes you do need help especially if\nthere's clinical stuff involved that's\nwhere like you know you do need someone\nto potentially save you\nto just think through it a little bit\nright don't be quite as judgmental\nrecognize that people move at their own\npace\nlike life is not a race\npeople development develop at different\npaces the brain continues to develop\nuntil 30 32 maybe\nand so it's okay to be a little bit\nbehind\nbecause the other interesting thing\nabout life is like i think rested xp\nspeaking of mmos is a really good\nanalogy\nso if you've been like afk for a while\nyou actually catch up faster\nthan people who regularly progress\nright and there's a really good general\npiece of evidence about this which is\nimmigrants so like\nwhen immigrants move to a different\ncountry\nyou know\nif i move to a different country if i\nmove to the united states from india\nwhen i'm nine years old i know nothing\nabout american customs\nand so those kids have a nine year head\nstart\nbut by the time i'm 18 we are completely\ncaught up\nexactly the same i understand american\nculture just as well as someone who\nspent 18 years there\nit's kind of like rested xp like the\nhuman brain catches up\nright that's what it's designed to do\nso even if you've fallen behind it\ndoesn't mean that you're going to stay\nbehind\nand so invest a little bit in yourself\nyou know i'm not saying stop helping\nother people go get a clinical\nevaluation if you need to or if you're\neven considering it if you've\nself-diagnosed yourself with something\nyou should absolutely go at a clinical\nevaluation\nand you may be surprised at who ends up\ndoing the saving\nyou have 20 years of arrested xp hey\ntrust me dude i had\nlike 23 years 22 years of rested xp\nabsolutely\nlike now the problem you guys want to\nknow the real tragedy my situation my\nrested xp is gone now\nno more catching up\nright\nnow it's the end game grind\nhours and hours of work\nfor such little yield\n[Music]\nyou"
