    "transcript": "is this the kind of thing where like i\nshould go see a therapist or like is\nthis the kind of thing where can i like\nrely on you for emotional support or is\nthis the kind of thing where like you\njust don't have the bandwidth to give it\nin that moment like help me understand\nlike what are we going to do about this\nbecause this is a problem for me\nso now we're going to talk a little bit\nabout being in relationships with people\nwho seem to have unhealthy video game\nhabits okay\nso my 22f husband 23m takes his video\ngame rage out on me and i don't know\nwhat to do\nsince the pandemic has started pretty\nmuch the only thing we have been able to\ndo in our time off is play video games\nmy husband plays a first person shooter\ngame and i sometimes play with him what\nis really bothering me is that when he\nplays these games and doesn't do well he\ngets angry he yells profanities and\nslams on his desk or our chair arm so\nmuch that he broke it after one of these\nepisodes even if i'm not involved he\nwill refuse to talk to me and go to bed\nwithout looking at or speaking to me\ni feel really hurt by this and have gone\nto bed crying multiple times because of\nit\nevery time it happens i tried talking to\nhim about it and i always express how\nit's making me feel but nothing has\nchanged\ni always ask if there's anything i can\ndo to help but he won't talk to me\ni don't think it's fair that he takes\nhis anger out on me\ni've tried to say that it's just a game\nand that he should try to have fun but\nhe doesn't have fun unless he does well\nin the game i'm sure he feels upset too\nbecause there's not much else we can do\nfor fun besides play video games maybe\nhe needs a new hobby\nwhat do i do when he refuses to\ncommunicate during these episodes i've\ntalked to him about this after he calmed\ndown but it keeps happening advice\nafter seeing everyone's replies i want\nto add a little bit more context my\nhusband is definitely emotionally\nunderdeveloped his parents are the\naren't the most emotionally involved\npeople even with their children now my\nhusband's frustration goes past video\ngames if he has\nif he has had other hobbies he's tr he\ntries really hard to learn everything he\ncan about it but will get frustrated and\nupset when he fails or does something\nwrong he gets angry because he is\nfailing it's the same with video games\nhe's mad at himself but it's pouring\nover into other things into his life\nno i'm not going to leave my husband for\nthis\nwe are in our 20s and he clearly needs\nhelp or he'll never change and i want to\nhelp him get that help thank you to\neveryone that suggested therapy or\ncounseling i'm going to talk to him\nabout all of this after uh today after\nwork\nso\nthis is unfortunately an increasingly\ncommon situation that people find\nthemselves in\nwe have romantic relationships parental\nrelationships sometimes sibling\nrelationships\nwhere one member plays video games\ni guess a lot or it's unclear whether\nthe person plays excessively in terms of\nhours but that the video game seems to\nmake them very very upset and it\nnegatively impacts their relationships\nand that like absolutely sucks and we're\nseeing this kind of happen all over the\nplace right because what's going on is\nthat\nas games become more engrossing as they\nbecome more addictive as we have some of\nthese global experiences like the\npandemic the only option that we have is\nto turn more and more to video games or\nyou know technology or things like that\nbecause our normal\num you know socialization our normal\nways of spending time together as all of\nthose things get restricted we have no\nchoice but to turn more to the video\ngame\nand so these are problems are becoming\nmore and more common so the first thing\nthat i want to say is that if you're in\nthis situation it's not your fault\num you know you're not doing a bad job\nas a as a sibling as a parent um as a as\na significant other\nand also that i i really respect that\nyou know the knee-jerk reaction that a\nlot of people have on the internet is to\ntell this person to leave this man-child\nright like the knee-jerk reaction is is\nsaying things like don't get married or\nit was a mistake to marry him in the\nfirst place or you know like\nit's a mistake to be in the relationship\nand i think those kinds of judgments are\nreally really easy to toss around on the\ninternet right like it's really easy to\nlook at this person say like why are you\nwith this why are you with this idiot\nyou know like you don't deserve this you\ndeserve better\nand i think that's actually a little bit\nit may come across as compassionate but\nit's not really i actually find it to be\nquite judgmental\nbecause what we're not doing here is\nmeeting this person where they're at\nwhat are this person's goals if we truly\nwant to be compassionate and empathetic\nwhat we should do is like acknowledge\nwhat this person wants right and try to\nsupport them in terms of their own goals\nit's not to try to convince them that\ntheir goals are wrong\nright that you're an idiot for staying\nwith this man child like you should\nleave him right away\nand so because it's really easy on the\ninternet to say to look at the situation\nand to say these kinds of things\nbut presumably this person got married\nbecause they were in love because they\ncare deeply about this person and i do\nbelieve that like generally speaking you\nshould work on things that are broken\ninstead of peacing out\nbecause if you just you know kind of\npeace out after giving it like without\ngiving it sort of a fair amount of\neffort and and kind of like you know\nattempting to really fix it i don't\nthink you're doing yourself a favor\nbecause the truth is that it sounds like\nthis person believes that their husband\nis suffering on some level as well it\nalso feels like you know this person\nacknowledges that their husband is not\nthe most like emotionally aware person\nwhich we're kind of seeing more and more\nas well and that this person wants to\nhelp their husband and i i really hope\nthat they're successful right i really\nhope that they can do that\nso today what i'd like to share with\ny'all is my general approach\num in some general advice about how to\ndeal with someone who you love\nwho you don't want to abandon who you\ndon't want to give up on right those are\nsort of the basic ideas because there's\ntons of advice for people who want to\ngive up on their relationship or like\nleave their partners right there's tons\nof people like gtfo there's a thousand\npeople to to say that but in my\noverwhelming experience like giving up\non your loved ones is like emotionally\ndifficult it's easy to say on the\ninternet hey just peace out you deserve\nbetter but then like\nwhat are you signing up for like online\ndating are you signing up for trying to\nmeet people during the pandemic like\nit's not easy right\nso what i'm going to try to do today is\nshare my perspective on if you do want\nto work on a relationship\nhow you should do that and especially\nwith someone who has a problematic\nrelationship with video gaming how to\naddress those\nokay\nso let's talk about that\nso the first thing that i kind of want\nto acknowledge so this is like you know\ngamer age\nand relationships\nso if you're someone who doesn't want to\ngive up\nand i'm not saying that\nyou know you can make the relationship\nwork and that there may not be a time\nthat there may be a time where you know\nyou really should leave the relationship\nwe'll talk about that a little bit at\nthe end so this is kind of the premise\nthat you don't want to give up so what\ni'd like to do for those people today is\ntry to equip you to understand a little\nbit about how to position yourself best\nand communicate with these people in a\nway that hopefully is productive okay\num\nso the first thing is we're gonna talk\nabout things like pitfalls\nso there are common mistakes that i see\npeople make\nwhich this person isn't necessarily\nmaking but i'd like to outline those\nbecause i tend to find that these are\ncommon pitfalls that people fall into\nthe first\nis don't\ndeliver\nfeedback\nin the moment\nof crisis\nokay\nso this is the most common thing that\npeople do so like when someone breaks\nthe arm chair is when people really like\nhave the conversation so i see this a\nlot in our parent program too which is\nlike conversations around video games\nbecome like conversations around\npunishments like the two become one of\nthe same\nand there's like it makes sense that\npeople want to have the conversation at\nthat moment right because that's when\nthings are like at their most severe\nbut if we think about someone who just\nbroke an armchair\nyou may want to say something at that\npoint and you have every right to say\nsomething at that point\nbut\nlet's think a little bit about how\neffective\nwhat you say is so how open to listening\nand how open-minded is that person in\nthat moment so the first thing is i'm\nnot saying you can't have say something\nin that moment it's probably a good idea\nto try it but in general so if we think\na little bit about you know being a\ntherapist for example\nwe tend to talk about things outside of\nthe individual moment right so if\nsomeone like comes to my office and\nthey're talking about a conflict at work\nor a conflict in their relationship like\nthey had an argument with their spouse\nlike two days ago by definition we are\nnot talking about it when emotions are\nhigh right like that's part of the\nadvantage and part of the advantage of\nthe therapeutic model is that we have\nconversations about stuff when people\nare level-headed so the first pitfall\nthat people tend to fall into is that\nthey try to give feedback or the\nmajority of feedback when there's an\nactual crisis going on okay so that's\nproblem number one\nthe second thing\nis don't jump to solutions\nso this is the other thing that tends to\nhappen so is the second that the\narmchair breaks\nsomeone will say hey you have to\nuninstall that [ __ ] right now like this\nneeds to go like this is a huge problem\nyou need to do this you need to do this\nyou need to do this\nand you may be right\nright so like like you may be more\nobjective in that moment you may like\nrecognize see see things in a way that\nyour partner doesn't and so you want\nthem to do particular things i've seen\nthis a ton in terms of so i used to work\nat um you know residential addiction\ntreatment facilities\nand p like 30 percent or\nwas it 30 50 of people were like going\nthrough a separation or divorce i forget\nthe exact statistic\nright and this is the kind of situation\nwhere they've got like a bad drinking\nproblem they had a bad drinking problem\nfor years\nand so it's reached the point where the\nspouse is like you take care of this or\nlike we're getting divorced there's\ntalks about divorce\nand so the spouse will come in and we'll\nlike be like hard charging and i don't\nblame them right because they've been\nhurt a lot by this they feel betrayed\nthey feel let on there's talk about\nchange change change and nothing ever\nhappens so the spouse comes in like has\na list of things that need to happen\nand you can even in in moments where you\nbrowbeat someone because in this moment\nof crisis maybe the person feels guilty\nso you can even get them to promise\nto never do it again\nbut these are not effective behavioral\nchange solutions\nright because they people promise all\nthe time and we even see this in this\npost where the person kind of says\num you know i uh\nuh i'm sure he feels upset too\num i don't think it's fair\num\n[Music]\nbut there's somewhere in here where they\nthey say that like you know we talk\nabout it afterward but it doesn't seem\nto change like nothing's changing or\nnothing's getting fixed okay\nso the second thing is don't jump to\nsolutions like we're not really there\nyet because you can provide them with\nsolutions they may listen they may not\nlisten but generally speaking people are\nnot mentally prepared to engage in\nsolutions\nso the third thing\nis be careful about your positioning\nso this is like really really\ninteresting so one thing one concrete\npiece of advice is that oftentimes when\nyou guys have talks\nin relationships you're sitting across\nfrom each other don't do that\nsit next to each other go for a walk\nhold hands you want to be side by side\nit's really fascinating the one thing\nthat i have found that is just so\nfascinating is when you're sitting\nacross from someone it engages in an\nadversarial dynamic right especially if\nthere's a table between you\nand so i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut like even i've noticed this like\nwith my own relationships is that when i\nhave conversations sitting across from\nsomeone it's very different from when\ni'm sitting next to someone it's like\nbizarre like it's some weird i don't\nknow like if there's data behind this or\nwhat it's something that i was taught in\nresidency right so like my psychotherapy\nsupervisors and stuff like explain this\nstuff to me like\nand it's absolutely true even in terms\nof the way that i set up my office i i\nalmost never sit directly across from a\npatient so like in my office i have my\nfurniture sort of set up like a u and i\nkind of sit at like a 45 degree angle so\nwe're kind of like both like looking in\nthe same direction and we'll kind of\nlike glance over at each other but i\ndon't know why it works it just seems to\nreally work it's something that a lot of\npsychotherapists do and it's something\nthat you can do i mean it's not like a\ntherapy technique right it just helps\nyou kind of get on the same side\nokay so these are the three things don't\nbe adversarial in your positioning\ndon't have conversations during a crisis\nand don't jump to solutions and so then\nthe question is okay like what do you\nactually do\nwhat should i do instead right so we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about this\nbut before we do this let's try to\nunderstand the experience of the other\nperson so oftentimes people who wind up\nin this problem are is this person put\nit emotionally underdeveloped\nright so we see this a lot so\nhere on stream we refer to this as a\nlexithymia\nwhich is the inability to recognize your\nown emotions so you're kind of\ncolorblind to emotions so it's my belief\nthat you know risk factors for\nalexithymia include male gender\ninclude technology usage\ninclude kind of familial conditioning\nright a certain kind of familial\nconditioning so if we look at society\nthis is thankfully changing now but like\nit used to be when i was growing up\nthere was really only one emotion that\nmen were allowed to express which is\nanger\nand any kind of guilt shame or fear was\nlike not discussed not talked about and\nin fact got transmuted into anger\nright so like if i i'm attracted to\nsomeone and i ask them out on a date and\nthey say no\ninstead of acknowledging that i feel\nrejected and i'm afraid that i'll be\nalone forever what i do is get pissed at\nthe person and you can still see this on\nthe internet today where like the\nprimary response to being rejected is\ngetting angry at them right so this is\nlike\nall of these kinds of feelings just get\ntransmuted into anger\nso this is common so the first thing is\nlike and so if this is the case you know\nwe're gonna have to help this person\nmaybe like understand their emotions and\nstuff a little bit better so um the\nperson sort of mentioned counseling or\ntherapy which i think is a fantastic\nidea\nright so like that's absolutely one\nsolution but even then if you go\nstraight to a solution\nand you say you need to see a therapist\notherwise we're done\nthe person may comply but they're not\ncomplying out of like you know they're\ncomplying out of fear right you're like\nkind of forcing them into it and this is\nmy key key experience working with\npeople with addictions\nis that like\nthe best strategy to help someone\novercome some kind of addictive or\nunhealthy behavior is not to use fear\nto like force them into things but is to\ntry to engage them as an ally because\nonce your husband wants to change their\nbehavior once they realize that they\nneed to change their behavior once\nthey're actively trying to change their\nbehavior it'll be so much easier right\nit's so much easier than trying to force\nsomeone to do something\nso how do we do that\nthe first is we're gonna try to\nunderstand\nokay\nso this is where like i would recommend\njust having a non-judgmental\nconversation about this kind of stuff so\nyou can ask questions like\nwhat do you think\nabout your gaming\nright and this is where you have to be\nsuper super careful if you're trying to\nhave this conversation so a lot of times\nwhat people will do is they'll like use\ndr k's words but in their mind they're\njust waiting for an opportunity to like\nshare their own frustration they're not\nactually trying to understand they may\nstart with this and then they'll start\nasking questions like don't you think\nit's a problem\nor if the person says oh yeah it's no\nbig deal\noh\nso breaking a chair\nis no big deal\nthis is going to fail\nif in your mind\nyou are not trying to understand\nbut you're just pretending to ask this\nquestion to understand\nthis will result in very good chat\npassive aggressive it'll torpedo in the\nface so you yourself need to try to\nunderstand as long as the judgment in\nyour mind is made up you're like screwed\nlike it's not gonna work\nokay so like be aware of this so you\nneed to try to understand like what does\nthis person genuinely think about the\nsituation do they think it's good do\nthey think it's not good do they think\nthey're gonna get over it do they think\ni'm okay with it like what do they think\nabout the situation\nso pretend for a moment that\nyou would have to represent this\nperson's view to a third party and any\nkind of question that the third party\nwould ask you\nyou should be able to answer about what\nthey believe and what they think\nthat's the approach you should take\nokay what if they don't know themselves\nwe'll get to that in a second because\nchances are they don't\nso\nas you start to ask questions that are\nopen-ended questions by the way\nright not yes or no questions not\ndirectional questions so not this stuff\nbut what do you think about your gaming\nthey're gonna you all will start to\nengage in discussion because they may\nnot understand this stuff but as long as\nyou don't attack them\nwith these kinds of questions they'll\nstart to open up and then y'all can\nexplore together and then they will\nautomatically it's kind of bizarre but\nit's like some weird verbal jiu-jitsu\nbut as you sort of form non-judgmental\nrelationships with people\nthey will start to like explore their\nfeelings because they feel safe\nright whereas like let's think a little\nbit about what this person's experience\nis like they can tell like so presumably\nthey're married so they hear\ntheir wife\nwho presumably they love\ncrying themselves to sleep\nhow do you think this person feels\nright\nthey they feel\nhurt\nthey feel powerless\nthey feel guilty like oh my god i'm such\nan [ __ ] but i don't know how to fix\nit i don't know what to say i don't know\nhow to say i don't know what i'm feeling\nthey feel paralyzed\nright they can tell that they're being\nan [ __ ] but like how do they manage\nfeelings of being an [ __ ] what were\nthey taught do you talk to your partner\nabout being an [ __ ] do you apologize\nlike what how are they conditioned\nokay and the worse they feel about\nthemselves\nremember what do we do we transmute that\ninto anger and then how do we cope we\nplay video games\nand then break chair\nfeel guilty\nit's happening again\nand then we go back to\nmy wife is crying herself to sleep rinse\nand repeat\ny'all see that\nright\nand at each cycle all this stuff gets\nworse and each cycle this increases in\neach cycle this increases\nbecause they don't know how to manage\ntheir emotions\nright so the first thing is you just\nwant to have a conversation about it or\nmultiple conversations away from the\ncrisis okay\nso the next thing that you want to do\nis\nkind of check in with them about having\nconversations\nso when you have a conversation you can\nask at the end of the conversation hey\nso we talked a little bit about like\ngaming and stuff i'm wondering and this\nis where especially if they're\nlexa-thymic or they're emotionally\nunderdeveloped you may have to put\nspecific phrases for them to deny so you\ncan start by asking what did you think\nof this conversation but then you can\neven ask them like did you feel like i\nwas attacking you\ndid this conversation make you feel\nguilty\ndid this conversation make you feel\nangry\ndid this conversation make you feel like\ni don't understand\ndid this conversation make you feel\nashamed\nright you can start to ask like these\nexplicit questions and they'll be like\noh yeah maybe i did feel angry i did\nfeel ashamed you know\nyou just listen and then like kind of\ncheck in with them and be like then ask\nfor permission\nare you okay if we talk about this again\nlike maybe a week from now\nare you worried that like i'm gonna like\nthis like do you feel like i'm leading\nyou into a trap\ni'm really not i'm just trying to\nunderstand\nlike what you know what's going on here\nand this is where as you do that for a\nlittle while you can sort of\nauthentically like you can absolutely be\nauthentic and you can say you know if\nthis is your partner i would just say it\nin a non-passive aggressive way you can\nsort of lay your boundary\nand then kind of ask an open-ended\nquestion so you can say like it really\nhurts my feelings when like i'm crying\nand you won't like talk to me\nand then you can kind of and this is the\nkey thing now what you want to do is\nrecruit them in prop problem-solving\nright you can state how you feel\nabsolutely\nyou can state your feelings\nrecruit them for problem solving\ninstead of saying you need to do this\nyou need to do this you need to do this\nask them so the next time that i'm\nfeeling this way\nwhat should i do\nand what can you do\nlike what do you think about this\nbecause generally speaking if this kind\nof behavior is going on\ni would bet 95 chance that the person\nthe husband in this scenario like\nrecognizes that there's a problem\nright and so what you want to do is\nrecruit their help not order them to do\nthings or make them feel guilty\nnow some of this stuff may create\nfeelings of guilt which is fine like\nthat's okay\nright like it's okay to like evoke some\namount of guilt but you don't want to\nuse these kinds of passive aggressive\nthings\nlike if you need to cry you need to cry\nlike that's okay like you fee you know\nexpress your emotions the way that you\nneed to\nbut at some point you want to recruit\nthem from problem solving and like come\nto them and say remember this is like so\na week ago i had a really rough day like\ni was i felt really alone i felt like\nyou know i wanted to spend time with you\nbut you wouldn't talk to me i felt super\nhurt\nwhat are we gonna do about that is this\nthe kind of thing where like i should go\nsee a therapist or like is this the kind\nof thing where can i like rely on you\nfor emotional support or is this the\nkind of thing where like you just don't\nhave the bandwidth to give it in that\nmoment like help me understand like what\nare we going to do about this\nbecause this is a problem for me\nand i recognize because now the key\nthing is that if you understand stuff\nabout them\nthen you can include that in there right\nand that's what makes it non-judgmental\nso you can say like i totally get that\nlike you feel alone you feel frustrated\nthis is the way that you connect with\nyour friends\nand that your friendships are important\nto you so i'm not saying don't you know\ndon't play stop playing video games\nentirely what i'm saying is like how do\nwe like fulfill that need that you have\nto play games online or connect with\nyour friends\nand\nat the same time like make it so that\ni'm not crying myself to sleep like how\ndo we fix this\nand generally speaking when you recruit\nthem for problem solving they will make\nsuggestions\nand now the whole ball game has\ncompletely changed\nbecause instead of telling them hey you\nneed to do this you need to do this\nthing you need to do this they are\nbecoming active participants in solving\nthe problem\nright number four says recruit them from\nfor problem solving like now the whole\nball game has changed because they're\nactually gonna like make an effort and\nit's coming from them\nnow this is where you may have to start\nto you know set boundaries and stuff and\nlike hold them to a particular standard\nabsolutely but i would say like these\nfour steps are the foundation\nof how to approach someone who has like\na problem with gaming\nright you want to try to understand\ntheir perspective first you want to talk\nto them about talking to them like what\nis the nature\nof our conversation\nright\nand this is where you can also do\nsomething\nthat's kind of like\na more advanced technique called going\nmeta\nis something we train our coaches in\nwhich is you can talk to your husband a\nlittle bit about like what is the way in\nwhich we solve problems in this\nrelationship so if you have an issue\nwith me like how do we fix that issue\nif i have an issue with you how do we\nfix that issue and you want to be plain\nhe knows what you're talking about you\nknow what you're talking about so you\ncan say like you know i have some\nconcerns about your gaming but before i\nwanted to jump to a judgment i was just\nthinking like let's take a step back and\nfigure out how do we as a husband and\nwife communicate problems in our\nrelationship i'd like to understand and\nestablish that\nright and i also would love it because\nlike we've established that like you may\nhave issues with me and i'd love to hear\nabout them because i i have concerned\nabout your gaming absolutely but it\noccurred to me that it was actually kind\nof unfair and premature for me to just\njudge you with that issue right away and\ninstead like how do we solve problems\nand then once you develop a frame right\nis it go to therapy or is it talk things\nout between us\nis it\nhave gone it you know gone a walk once a\nweek where we like sort of like sit down\nand run through like ups and downs of\nour relationship like what's the nature\nlike how do we solve problems like\nwhat's the right way to approach this\nright it's like if you go to your doctor\nand like you've got a lump you're like\nokay doc like what do we do about the\nlump\nand then like your doctor will say okay\nwe do this this this i mean this is a\nlittle bit different because you all are\nboth you know on the same level here\nbut you're having a meta-level\nconversation and usually meta-level\nconversations are less emotionally\ncharged and will be like engage less\ndefensive behavior because you're not\ntalking about the problem you're talking\nabout how to talk about problems which\nis very healthy in a relationship to\nbegin with\nright and as you kind of have this\nmeta-level conversation okay so like\nonce a week conversation sounds okay\nwith you\nwhy don't we talk next week and you know\nyou can kick things off so if there's\nanything that i'm doing that is really\nconcerning you you can let me know\nand so this is where you know once you\nstart recruiting them from problem\nsolving then you can offer solutions so\nyou can say what do you think about\ntherapy or counseling\nbecause the other kind of ironic thing\nis that when people feel you know guilty\nthey oftentimes do not want to do\ntherapy or counseling it actually like\nthey feel worse\nthey're like oh i should be able to\nhandle this on my own i'm such an idiot\nbecause my wife is crying herself to\nsleep every night and i can't fix it on\nmy own right so this is another thing\nthat men tend to be taught which is like\nself-reliance\nalso true in asian-american culture by\nthe way one of the reasons that it's an\ninteresting study i was looking at\nrecently that\ndespite the fact of\nregular i mean equal amounts of\nsuffering from mental illness people of\nasian american descent are much less\nlikely to seek treatment\nand the main reason is because they\nbelieve in self-reliance so they're more\nlikely to read self-help books and less\nlikely to seek treatment externally\nbecause they think they should be able\nto solve it on their own\nright\nso if you're if you're someone who's\nstruggling\nto have a conversation and work on\nunhealthy technology usage with someone\nclose to you and you number one don't\nwant to give up on them don't want to\nbreak up\nfirst thing to understand is there a\ncouple of common pitfalls\ndon't deliver feedback at the time of\ncrisis let people calm down let people\nbe a little bit more open-minded let\nthem not be emotional\nsecond thing is don't jump straight to\nsolutions because you may not understand\nthe problem and they may have solutions\nof their own once you start forcing\npeople into solutions they'll get\ndefensive or they'll feel bullied\ninto\nengaging in the solution and this will\nresult in things like\npromises that are then broken\nright because it's not that the\nmotivation is not intrinsic it's not\ncoming from them\nthe motivation is coming from a fear of\nof what you're going to do unless they\nsay yes and then they're not really\nworking for you they're just like\nthey're obedient as opposed to motivated\nor inspired\nthird thing is there are some\npositioning tips\nright so like\nwalk go for a walk sit next to them hold\nhands things like that i mean this also\ndepends on the nature of your\nrelationship\nokay\nin terms of what to do start by\nunderstanding this isn't just ask some\nquestion and then be passive-aggressive\ndepending on their answer so some people\nwill sort of ask an open-ended question\nand just wait to attack they'll be\nlaying they'll use an open-ended\nquestion as an ambush\nso the standard that i would recommend\nfor open-ended questions is imagine you\nhad to you would have a conversation\nwith a third party for one hour\nand any question that that third party\nwould ask you about the gaming behavior\nyou should be able to answer why do you\nplay games you should be able to answer\nthat how do you feel when you break a\nchair you should be able to answer that\nwhat makes you want to play games what\nmakes it hard for you to play games do\nyou want to cut back\nall those kinds of things right how long\nhave you been playing games just really\ngenuinely try to understand their\nperspective\ncheck in with them so as you have\nconversations check in with them be like\nhey how was this conversation with you\ndid i step out of line was it okay can\nwe do it again\nlay your boundaries you can be authentic\nright so you don't want to start here\nyou actually want to start with the\nother two but once you understand their\nperspective you want to share yours and\nhopefully they'll start picking up\nand start asking you questions too\nand the next thing is recognize that\ny'all are on the same team\nso it's not necessarily your\nresponsibility to come up with solutions\nin fact it's not exclusively your\nresponsibility\nthis person should be taking\nresponsibility too so ask them hey what\ndo you think we can do about this\nproblem\nright once you've listened to them\nand you've made it clear that you want\nto understand them and you approach them\nnon-judgmentally and you've stated your\nproblems you can ask them hey what do\nyou think we should do about this\nanother key thing\nthis is not one conversation\nthis is like at a minimum three\nconversations\nokay\nspaced out by at least 48 to 72 hours\nso you don't want to get to the problem\nsolving in session one\nyou want to like wait until convo number\nthree\nand then if you need to you can have a\nmeta-level discussion about how we solve\nproblems like in this relationship like\nwhat is our approach like how are we\ngoing to make this work so people in\nthis example are pretty young they're 22\nand 23. so these are very important\nconversations to have instead of\nbreaking up with them just start to\nfigure out okay like we're going to be\ntogether presumably or we want to be\ntogether for like 50 years how are we\ngonna manage conflict between the two of\nus\nand hopefully as you sort of engage in\nthis stuff and we've seen this a lot in\nour parent program i've seen it a lot in\nmy own relationships advice with friends\nthings like that that when you start\nreally working\ntowards a common goal when you try to\nunderstand someone instead of just blame\nthem when you acknowledge their\nexperience as well\nthat's when you start to really recruit\nthem they become motivated and things\nstart to move in the right\ndirection\nyou"
