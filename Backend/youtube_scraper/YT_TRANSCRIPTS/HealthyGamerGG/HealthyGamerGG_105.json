    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about\nsomething super cool how to shape your\nbehavior without involving\nyou so the core problem that we have is\nthat we have ideas of what we should do\nbut we keep on getting in the way so you\nhave certain goals you have certain\ndesires you have certain Ambitions but\nthe problem of choice enters the picture\nright because you would rather do\nsomething else and so the question is\ncan we remove you from the equation\nbecause if we removed you from the\nequation would you act in the right way\nso this may sound kind of weird but if\nwe stop and sort of think about it a lot\nof the problems that we have in life are\nbecause of the choices we make so\nthere's like thing a that I should do\nthis is maybe study or work or work out\nor eat healthy or something like that\nand instead what happens is my mind or I\nmake a choice to do something else and\nso a lot of our problems in life come\nfrom the choices that we make and so if\nwe look at improving Our Lives can we\nactually improve our lives by actually\nremoving ourselves from the\ndecisionmaking process and that may\nsound like a weird goal to have but if\nwe look at some Modern theories of\nNeuroscience basically a lot of\nNeuroscience tells us that we don't have\nfree will that actions are deterministic\nthat the choices we make aren't real\nchoices but they're actually\ncalculations that are performed by our\nneurons and if our neurons decide to do\nsomething then we end up doing it that\nFree Will is essentially an illusion so\nI started thinking about this concept\nquite a bit and started to realize okay\nhold on a second if there is no Free\nWill and everything is just neurons\nmaking calculations can we change the\ncalculations that our neurons make can\nwe essentially program our brains in a\nparticular way to shape our Behavior\nbecause there's no such thing as free\nwill there's no such thing as choice\nwhich means everything is like levers\nbeing pulled if I if I flick the light\nswitch on let's say the lights turn off\nand if I hit another button the lights\nturn back on can we basically do that in\nour brain because that's what a lot of\nneuroscientists claim so I started\nlooking into the research of the absence\nof Free Will and what are the\nneuroscientific mechanisms because\npeople must be making that conclusion\nbased on certain experiments we must\nhave learned certain things about the\nbrain and behavior\nthat allow us to conclude or hypothesize\nthat there's no such thing as free will\nand if we understand the programming\ninside the brain can we then utilize\nthat programming in the same way that we\ncan kind of program a computer to create\nthe correct actions so this is sort of\nwhat I investigated and what I found was\nabsolutely fascinating because as I was\ngoing through the literature and there's\na ton of it we'll share a couple papers\nwith y'all today but as I was going\nthrough the the literature I started to\nstumble upon realization so I work with\na lot of very successful people and I\nalso work with a lot of very\nunsuccessful people and as I was looking\nthrough this literature about\ndeterministic behavior from the brain I\nstarted to realize that holy crap a lot\nof my very successful clients patients\nutilize these mechanisms and they don't\neven realize it a lot of my very\nunsuccessful clients and patients these\nare people who are like degenerate\nGamers Failure to Launch even people who\nare homeless do not utilize these\nmechanisms and it was crazy how clear\nthis was because once I read it in the\nliterature I hadn't even realized that\nmy successful like my high performers\nthat I work with these are people like\nCEOs like heads of billion dooll\ncompanies content creators with millions\nand millions of followers they all do\nthis stuff so today what we're going to\ndo is share those deterministic\nprinciples and the crazy thing is that\nthis is not usually where we focus it's\nnot about motivation it's it's not about\nconvincing yourself it's not about logic\nor anything like that they're actually\ndiscret things that these people do that\naren't really things even we'll get to\nit in a second I know it sounds kind of\nweird that I see very commonly in people\nwho are very successful and we're going\nto outline some of those principles for\nyou today when people hear that we offer\ncoaching at HG their first question is\nlike what on Earth even is that so\nhere's the basic problem when you\nstruggle with something in your life you\ndon't see the problem from the outside\nyou see it from the inside the value of\na coach is that they can look at your\nlife from the outside they can\nunderstand what's going on and they can\nhelp guide you to improve things like\nmotivation accomplish short-term goals\nand even increase a sense of purpose in\nlife and over the long term we also see\nimprovements in feelings of depression\nand anxiety and the best part is we've\nhad over 100,000 coaching sessions and\nwe incorporate that feedback to\ncontinually improve our program so if\nyall are interested in actually making a\nchange in your life check out the link\nin the description below so just a quick\ndisclaimer that this is sort of a\ncombination of very basic science basic\nscience research and then also like\nclinical experience and what I've tried\nto do is tie the the two together so\nlet's start with this concept that there\nis no such thing as free will so this\nmay sound kind of shocking but this is\nactually an old idea so back in\n1983 liet liet and colleagues made the\nassertion that the conscious experience\nof volition cannot trigger the\ninitiation of action it further suggests\nthat conscious volition is an\nafterthought and not any part of the\naction generating process at all so\npeople did a series of an experiments\nand we'll show you what that is in 1983\nand they basically concluded that the\nthe decision to act happens before any\nconscious decision is made or any\nawareness of a decision is made so that\nthe brain decides ahead of time what\nyou're going to do and then later your\nConsciousness is thinks that it\nbasically makes a decision but this is\nessentially an illusion of the mind so\nwhat people were sort of looking at they\nthey were doing a uh this is a schematic\nof liit findings and so this is um the\ncase of like some kind of motor movement\nthey were making and what they basically\nnoticed was that there's this thing\ncalled a Readiness potential so like the\ndecision in your brain gets made between\none and two seconds before you act and\nthen they ask people okay like tell us\nwhen you decide to move and the the the\ndecision to move was about 200\nmilliseconds before you move so\nbasically they ask people like okay\nanytime you're going to like move your\nhand just tell us when you've made the\ndecision tell us when you've decided to\nmove and so what happened is people\nwould decide okay like I'm going to move\nnow and that would happen about 200\nmilliseconds before they actually move\nbut what these this experiment showed is\nthat they could actually detect the\nmovement the decision to move about one\nsecond before the actual movement and so\nthis is how they kind of concluded that\nwe can detect that your brain has made\nthe decision before you're even aware or\nbefore you believe you've made the\ndecision now this isn't the only\nexperiment that has shown this this\nexperiment has been sort of carried out\nin different ways so we'll sort of show\nyou all a more recent experiment I think\nthis is from 2008 or 2018 where soon at\nAl concluded that the outcome of a\ndecision can be encoded in the brain\nactivity of prefrontal and prial cortex\nup to 10 10 seconds before it enters\nawareness so this is kind of crazy but\nmore recent research has shown that you\ncan detect this decision up to 10\nseconds before someone thinks that they\nmade it so the experiment that soon did\nwas very interesting they just basically\nsaid here's a lever and you can press\nthe lever with your right hand or your\nleft hand and then what they did is they\nmeasured blood flow to different parts\nof the brain so we have this thing\ncalled the motor cortex which is like\nhow we move move our fingers and stuff\nand so what they were able to do is\npredict up to 10 seconds in advance they\nwould see blood flow go to a certain\npart of the brain and they would be able\nto predict which hand the person would\nchoose to push the lever with so they\ncould see that okay blood flow is going\nto the right hand so this person is\ngoing to make a choice that they're\ngoing to press the the lever with the\nright hand as opposed to the left hand\nand they couldn't predict with 100%\naccuracy but if you look at like what\nshould be the prediction it's basically\na coin flip right it's random whether\nyou pick right hand or left 10 they were\nable to predict with about 60% accuracy\nwhich hand someone would pick before\nthey even knew which one they were going\nto pick and the key thing still remains\nthat if our brain works like this how\ncan we program ourselves so that our\nneurons move in the right direction and\nwe can essentially remove free will or\nConsciousness or motivation or any of\nthat crap from the equation so the key\ntakeaway here is that there does seem to\nbe some evidence that conscious decision\nmaking is not actually what happens what\na lot of people believe what a lot of\nneuroscientists believe is that your\nbrain makes a decision and the conscious\nthe the idea of Free Will is essentially\nan illusion that happens afterward that\nyour brain sort of concocts some idea of\nchoice but the decision is already made\nso we're going to start with the\noriginal 1983 experiment and this idea\nof something called a Readiness\npotential or in the original German the\nber potential okay so this is super cool\nso the ber potential or Readiness\npotential okay is is this thing that\nbegins 1 second or more before the onset\nof movement and continues to rise up\nuntil just before the onset of muscle\ncontraction so what this basically means\nis that there's this weird thing called\nthe Readiness potential which is sort of\nsubjectively I would kind of describe\nthis as working yourself up to the\naction so if we look at people who are\nvery successful they are able to work\nthemselves up to the action whereas\npeople who are struggling with things\nlike procrastination and delaying things\nand not doing the right things they have\ndifficulty working themselves up to it\nso we have a subjective experience of\nthis and it turns out that there's a\nneuroscientific correlate so the first\nthing that we want to do is harness the\npotential for our benefit and then you\nmay be wondering how the hell do we do\nthat and that's where it's cool because\npeople have figured that out so the more\nthat the the participant thinks about\nthe action the earlier and larger is the\nRP longer interaction intervals were\nwere associated with earlier and larger\nRPS suggesting that the time available\nfor the Preparatory buildup may have a\nmajor influence on RP okay so what does\nthis mean in our brain we have this\nthing called the bches potential or the\nRP the RP determines whether we act or\nnot and so what we want to do is\nincrease the RP because the larger that\nthe RP is the more likely that we are to\nact and this is what I've noticed about\nsuccessful versus unsuccessful people\nthe high performers are the ones who\ngive themselves a lot of time to work up\nto something whereas people who are low\nperformers less successful have very\nsmall transitions I'll give you all just\na very simple example so if you like\nlook at like I'm thinking about my life\nwhen I was a degenerate I would bounce\nfrom one form of procrastination to\nanother I would never sit still during\nthe day I did nothing all day but I\nwasn't actually sitting with myself\nright I'd play a game for 4 hours and\nthen I'd like be like okay this is crazy\nit's been too long I'd hop in the shower\nright it's hop it's not like move\nmindfully and slowly and carefully into\nthe shower it's hop into the shower\norder some food go pick it up jump into\na queue even the language that that we\nuse suggests that our transitions are\nvery small and if you pay attention to\nyour life what you'll find is that there\nis a correlation between rapid\nTransitions and doing the wrong thing\nI'm dating this person and then I just\nbroke up and instead of spending time\nwith myself and learning how to be\nhealthy on my own I'm going to rebound\ninto another relationship so it's so\ncrazy that we sort of see this already\nin our lives and when I work with people\npeople who are very successful what I\nsee is that they give themselves time\nand this is going to be a key theme that\nwe're going to focus on today is that\nsuccessful people focus on the\ntransitions between action and a lot of\npeople who really struggle to do the\nright thing focus on the actions\nthemselves and that's what's really\ncrazy is it seems like our brain really\ndecides the right things in between\nactions so that's the first thing is\ngive yourself time very practically\nspend a few minutes before you go from\none activity to another activity now\nthis may sound kind of weird because you\nmay be thinking what do I do in those\ntwo minutes do I need to think a\nparticular thing we'll get to those\nthings but basically this is the crazy\nthing is if the brain is deterministic\nit's not clear to me that you need to\nthink any particular thing it's not like\nthere is a right way of thinking or a\nwrong way of thinking it is simply\ngiving your brain the space to build its\nRP and then let's see what happens so\nwe're now going to dive into something\nsuper cool so if you look at a lot of\npeople who struggle to be successful or\nbe high performers they struggle with\navoidance right we do things like\nprocrastinate I don't want to do this\ntask this time you know I I I I'll take\ncare of it tomorrow we all know about\navoidance and procrastination and then\nwe had this stupid idea we had this idea\nthat oh my God what I need to do is\novercome avoidance right because then I\ncan be like these disciplined people who\nare not avoiding tasks at all so it\nturns out that this is wrong it turns\nout that the reason that procrastination\nis so uniform is because avoidance is\nbaked into our brain the difference\nbetween High performers and low\nperformers is high performers utilize\ntheir avoidance in One Direction and low\nperformers utilize their avoidance in\nthe wrong direction the big difference\nis what is it that they're choosing to\navoid so someone who is a high performer\nor very successful is much more likely\nto avoid wanting to do something in the\nfuture so the way that they literally\nthink is I have this task to do I don't\nwant this task hanging over my head over\nthe next week I don't want to have to do\ntake care of this tomorrow I want to\navoid waiting so this is key what\nresearch shows us is that a huge part of\nvolition is the avoidance of waiting and\nI want you to think think about things\nthat you've done where you haven't\nprocrastinated if you really stop and\npay attention sometimes it's passion\nsometimes it's inspiration but a lot of\ntimes it's just I don't want to deal\nwith this [ __ ] tomorrow so I might as\nwell take it off today take care of it\ntoday right and this is the same idea\nbehind ripping a Band-Aid right off we\ndon't want to belabor this over a long\nperiod of time that is extensive pain so\nwe just want to take care of it just get\nit done I don't want to deal with with\nit tomorrow and that's literally what\nthe science shows us that some people do\nthis so participants made volitional\nactions as a means of avoiding random\nand potentially long waits for stimulus\nonset in a per perceptual\ndecision-making task so I want youall to\nunderstand this the task isn't really\nthat important okay the key thing here\nis that volitional actions are made as a\nmeans of avoidance this is crazy right\nwe have have to really stop and think\nabout this this is not conquering\navoidance this is utilizing avoidance so\nif we want to be more successful if we\nwant our performance to increase we\ndon't need to conquer avoidance we\nactually need to channel it in the\nopposite direction so spend a little bit\nof time thinking about avoiding this in\nthe future ask yourself hey wouldn't it\nbe fantastic if I didn't have to worry\nabout this crap tomorrow this is a\nquestion that I utilize a lot with my\ncoaching clients especially not the high\nperforming ones but the low performing\nones where I ask themselves what is the\nworld that you want to wake up in\ntomorrow right this is a key key\nquestion to ask yourself how do you want\nto wake up tomorrow do you want to have\nyour your fridge stocked with food this\nis something that I did a lot so when\nwhen I when my wife and I first had kids\nwhat I sort of noticed is that I had to\ngo to the grocery store like at 10:00 at\nnight I was exhausted I didn't want to\ngo I didn't feel like doing anything\nexcept for playing video games or\nfalling asleep or whatever but the main\nthing that got my ass to the grocery\nstore is when I wake up tomorrow morning\ndo I want to have nothing healthy and\nnutritious to eat am I just going to\norder am I going to go pick up breakfast\ntacos which are delicious but are not\nvery good for me and so is even the\navoidance of the problems tomorrow that\nactually got me to get my ass up and go\nto the grocery store at 10 p.m. at night\nthis is something that high performers\ndo they're just as avoidant as you or me\nthe big difference is it is what they\nchoose to avoid so start to choose to\navoid different things and what you'll\nfind is that it is very easy for you to\ndo that because you're not trying to\nconquer the circuit in your brain the\nbrain naturally wants to do it and we\nwant to move in line with that the next\nthing we're going to talk about is\nsuperstition and I love this so much\nthis is what I found so fascinating\nabout looking at these like research\nstudies on volition and action and human\nchoice so Superstition is Dum we all\nknow that superstitions are false we\nhave tons of scientific evidence that\nshow us that if you wear your lucky\nscarve a sports team is not going to win\nor lose right like we know we know this\nthis is something that we know 100% And\nyet superstitions are a fact of human\nexistence and we have to understand why\nright so what is going on why do human\nbeings believe in superstitions even\nthough we know scientifically that\nthey're false and it turns out that we\ncan harness this Superstition circuitry\nwhich is actually a CO cognitive bias in\nour favor so let's take a quick look at\nthe science moreover asking people\ndirectly whether they are responsible\nfor an outcome is notoriously\nproblematic because of self-serving bias\npeople routinely report agency over\npositive events but deny it over\nnegative events regardless of whether\nthey actually cause those events so this\nis basically talking about Superstition\nthis amounts to an enhanced perceptual\nassociation between action and outcome\nwhich presumably highlights the\nexperience that one's actions cause the\noutcomes duh right when I do thing a it\ncauses thing B so we're going to talk\nabout like why is Dr K talking about\nthis so let's understand this so the\ngoal here is to shape your behavior\nright the goal here is to remove Free\nWill from the equation so if I go to\nsomeone who is superstitious about\nwearing a particular scarf when their\nfavorite team is playing let's\nunderstand what's going on there's a\nparticular outcome in the outside world\nwhich then shapes their behavior and\nthen if I tell this person hey like help\nme understand what the science of\nwearing the scarf is the person is like\nthere is no science and then I'll say\nokay fine bro so take it off and they're\nlike no never I will never take it off I\nwill no no no no and I'll tell me why\nwhy I don't know I just won't do it so\nlet's just stop and think about this\nthis is not free will their [ __ ]\nbrain is telling them you cannot take\noff the scarf and so this is the\nbeautiful thing about Superstition we\nactually know the science through which\nsuperstitions form it is a weird thing\nin our brain where we observe a\nparticular outcome and then we kind of\ntrack it back to a particular action and\nthe beautiful thing about this is if we\nmanipulate this Behavior we may be able\nto induce the same not discipline the\nsame\nstubbornness of a Superstition for\npositive behaviors we can be very very\nstubborn about our behaviors and our\nbehaviors feel very very automatic so\nlet's understand how to harness this\nprinciple so that we can shape our\nbehaviors and be stubbornly attached to\nsomething that we actually want to do so\nlet's take a look at that to produce\ngoal directed action the brain needs\nthree essential processes an action\nselection mechanism to select an action\na motor output mechanism to execute the\naction and the monitoring mechanism to\nconfirm that the goal has been achieved\nnow this is the last thing that really\nfocuses on Superstition so if you if you\nlook at how a Superstition is formed\nafter an event happens what people\nusually do is a postmortem so one day\nI'm wearing a scarf and my team wins and\nI don't really think about it the next\ntime my team plays they lose and then I\nspend a lot of time thinking about it\nI'm like oh my God they lost oh my oh I\ndidn't wear my scarf that's why they\nlost it's not about the particular\nconclusion and this is what I've seen\nfrom my high performers is they spend a\nlot of time after an action is completed\ndoing a postmortem what went wrong with\nthis relationship how did I screw up\nthis presentation what do I need to do\nto better do perform better in an\ninterview they spend a lot of time after\nthe action is complete monitoring and\nthinking about the outcome of the action\nand what we know from research on\nSuperstition and volition is that the\nmore more time we spend dwelling on\nsomething the more likely we are to\nre-engage in some kind of action so this\nis where very practically what we want\nto do is spend time doing a postmortem\nand I encourage you all to think about\nthe times in your life when you screw up\nand we may dwell on things in a very\nnegative way but if you're like me we we\ndon't really dwell on it's so hard to\ndescribe but we don't really do a\npostmortem right we don't really think\nabout things in a very logical way or\nwhat we tend to do is actually avoid it\nso anytime that I would take a test for\nexample and the test did not go as well\nas I wanted I was so frustrated that I\nwould jump immediately into something\nelse if you break up with someone and\nthere's a very very bad breakup let's\nget drunk and have a rebound we don't\nspend any time doing a postmortem and\nwhat we literally do when I work with\npeople who are low performers or less\nsuccessful what I force them to do in my\noffice is a postmortem let's\nunemotionally look at the situation\nlet's not jump into a reflexive behavior\nlet's just spend some time monitoring\nthe outcome of our actions and what I\ntend to find is there's two camps of\npeople one person who just jumps right\ninto the next thing once again really\nshort transition and other people spend\ntime doing a postmortem so you should\nabsolutely do that now a lot of people\nmay be wondering but what is the right\nway to do a postmortem and that's the\ncrazy thing there isn't a right way or\nwrong way I mean I guess the right way\nis to really think about it as logic as\nyou can but the research actually shows\nthat it isn't a particular kind of\npostmortem that leads to positive\nreinforcement in Behavior it is just the\nfact that you do a postmortem and this\nis kind of where we tap into this idea\nthat your neurons are making their\ncalculations we just need to give them\nthe space to make the calculations the\nlast thing that we're going to talk\nabout is intentional binding so anytime\nwe take an action there's a particular\noutcome and we think that depending on\nthe outcome the action is reinforced or\nnot reinforced but now we understand\nthrough this concept of intentional\nbinding that there are certain things\nthat you can do to encourage the repeat\nof the action so if I go to workout\ntoday so I know this sounds kind of\nweird but let's say that there are two\npeople one both of them go to the gym\nfor the first time now for one person\nthis is the first and the last time that\nthey go to the gym for this year but for\nthe second person this is the first of\n100 times that they go to the gym this\nyear but at the end of that first day at\nthe gym both of these people are equal\nright but something changes between\nthese two people one person doesn't ever\ngo again and the second person decides\nokay this is great I'm going to go again\nand again but they don't actually decide\nthat's the whole point there's no free\nwill there's no decision something\nhappens in their brain that causes them\nto go again and again and again and this\nis the concept of intentional binding\nthe more that we increase our\nintentional binding the more that we\nwill actually repeat behaviors so now\nwe're going to look at the Neuroscience\nof how to increase intentional binding\nand the crazy thing is that we all have\nthese ideas of pavlovian reinforcement\nwe have all these ideas that the first\nperson who went to the gym has a\nnegative experience therefore this is\nnot rewarded therefore they don't go\nagain and the first the second person\nhas some kind of reward that increases\nthe action this is the crazy thing right\nso when we think that we think okay when\nI act I need the right reward to\nre-engage the behavior dopamine all this\nother crap turns out that isn't the case\nseveral studies confirm that the ability\nto choose among several possible actions\nincreases intentional binding so what\ndoes this mean the first thing that\nincreases intentional and binding is\nhaving lots of choices that's number one\nsecond thing is that interestingly this\neffect of free choice was found both\nwhen all possible actions led to the\nsame outcome and when they led to\ndifferent outcomes so we're going to\nstop for a second and really digest what\nthis means because this is very\ndifferent so what this research suggests\nis that the outcome actually doesn't\nmatter if I give someone all the same\nchoices let's say I give them a choice\nof do you want this piece of cake this\npiece of cake or this piece of cake and\nthe cakes are all the same we tend to\nthink that it is the size of the cake\nthat determines my decision and if there\nare all equal outcomes then\nthere should be no reinforcement but\nwhat the research on intentional binding\nshows us is that making a choice\nreinforces the behavior it's not even\nthe outcome of the choice it is the fact\nthat you stop and make a choice this is\nabsolutely true for high performers\nversus low performers High performers\nstop between actions and consider all of\ntheir choices low performers jump from\none thing to another they don't consider\nall the options they're just I feel like\ndoing this so I'm going to do this they\nactually try to avoid thinking about all\nof the choices and what the research in\nintentional binding shows us is that\nsimply pausing reflecting and selecting\nsomething increases the likelihood of\nthe behavior so let's apply this to\nsomething like exercise rushing to the\ngym is unlikely to result in a repeat of\ngoing to the gym sitting down for 5\nminutes and asking yourself okay I want\nto exercise today what are my options if\nyou go through this cognitive exercise\nthat cognitive exercise is sufficient to\nincrease your intentional binding and\nmake you more likely to go to the gym in\nthe future so let's look at one other\naspect of intentional binding in another\nstudy uh compared conditions in which\nthe same action choices either did or\ndid not predict action outcomes\nintentional binding was stronger in the\nform mer than in the latter case there\nis a element of Behavioral reinforcement\nbased on outcomes when we go to the gym\nif you have a good experience you're\nmore likely to go again that's\nabsolutely true the key thing about\nintentional binding is that that's not\nthe only thing involved right which kind\nof makes sense because if we sort of\nthink about it we'll sometimes do things\nin life where we do have a positive\noutcome I went to the gym and I felt\ngreat and yet we don't go again the next\nday so what's missing why why not if\nthere is that pavlovian reinforcement\nthat is not sufficient to shape your\nbehavior so this is where intentional\nbinding comes into play so making uh\nchoosing between a lot of options is the\nother thing that increases intentional\nbinding and there's a third thing which\nis making a prediction it doesn't matter\nwhat the prediction is but in that\nprocess of making a choice if you stop\nand predict the outcomes that process of\nmaking a prediction whether that\nprediction is right or wrong seems to\nincrease intentional binding so once\nagain what I see between High performers\nand low performers is low performers\ntend to not really think too much about\nthe consequences of their actions in\nfact if you're like me you avoid making\npredictions you try very hard to not\nthink about what the consequences of\nyour actions are because you know\nthey're going to be bad and if you know\nthey're going to be bad why doesn't your\nbrain avoid them it's because we're\nmissing this per this section of\nprediction so anytime we make a\nprediction about the outcome if I do\nthis what will happen tomorrow literally\nthat cognitive\nexercise increases intentional binding\nso let's take a quick look at one last\nbit of research so interestingly doostan\ncolleagues did not find Reliable\ndifferences in intentional bindings\nbetween rewarded and unrewarded actions\nso this is the point that I made earlier\nthis is very interesting right so\nwhether the action turns out good or not\ndoes not affect intentional binding the\nmost important things is considering all\nof your choices and making predictions\nthose are the two things that actually\ncorrelate with an increase in Behavior\nnow I realize I've made a lot of weird\ncontradictory statements so I said on\nthe one hand the reward doesn't matter\nthe outcome doesn't matter on the other\nhand there is pavlovian conditioning so\nlike what's the deal here Dr K how the\n[ __ ] does this work so what I'm pointing\nout to y'all is that if we look at\npeople who are successful or\nunsuccessful what's the difference so\nwhat we tend to find is that successful\npeople it's not the outcome itself which\nthere may be some degree of\nreinforcement and remember that\nsometimes studies can have conflicting\nuh findings right so how can we make\nsense of this so this is what I've\nobserved when people are very successful\nthey utilize these principles of\nintentional binding without even\nrealizing it they pause and they think\nthrough things before they act they make\nintentional predictions they stop and\nthink about what the consequences of\ntheir actions are going to be whereas\nunsuccessful people don't do that right\nwhat they actually try doing is avoiding\npredictions and if we look at this study\nand we say that hold on a second the\nstudy is telling us that the important\nthing to reinforce behavior is not the\noutcome it is the prediction does that\ntrack with your experience does that\ntrack with what I have seen in my office\nabsolutely because sometimes things go\nwell for people who who are lazy but\nthey don't change their behavior and\nsometimes things go poorly for people\nwho are highly successful but they keep\ntrying so if we stop and think about it\nit's not the outcome that is significant\nand alone the only thing that reinforces\nthe behavior there are other factors at\nplay and it turns out that the research\non intentional binding tells us what\nthose are and it tracks perfectly some\npeople make predictions some people make\nintentional choices some people follow\nwhatever the [ __ ] they feel like doing\nand try to avoid thinking about the\nconsequences of their actions and those\nare the things that correlate with\nsuccess or failure so just to summarize\nthere's this idea that our behavior is\ndeterministic there's no choice you\ndon't get to decide what you do your\nbrain makes a decision up to 10 seconds\nbefore you even realize it and I also\nsee this in my patients who have\naddictions when I really tunnel down and\nI talk to them they know they've made\nthe decision to relapse before they\nconsciously make the decision to relapse\ntheir brain is decided for them so does\nthat mean you're [ __ ] does that mean\nyou can't control your life at all well\nlet's see if we can actually program\nourselves in the right way which gets\ninto some weird Paradox of is this\nactually free will or is this\nprogramming is it possible that simply\nwatching this video has planted a seed\nin your mind and that your B potential\nis starting already to move in the right\nway I don't know we don't have a final\nanswer but let's hope so there are a\ncouple of principles which you can\nabsolutely engage in which will\ncorrelate with improved behaviors the\nfirst is take advantage of\ntheti which is give yourself time in\ntransitions the second thing that we\nwant to do is harness avoidance instead\nof conquer it avoid the weight avoid\ndealing with it tomorrow try to save\nyourself the trouble of dealing with\nthis crap and just get it done right\nlike a Band-Aid one movement take it\nright off this is what successful people\ndo the third thing that we really want\nto focus on is a monitoring mechanism\nfor the outcome of our actions the more\ntime we spend doing a postmortem the\nmore these\nillogical and controlling superstitious\ncircuits in our brain will activate the\neasier it will be to act in a stupid way\nin the future so we have to be a little\nbit careful there because if you don't\ndo the postmortem in the right way you\ncan sort of arrive at the wrong\nconclusions but we absolutely do know\nthat spending more time is better than\nspending less time the last thing that\nwe want to consider is this concept of\nintentional binding where if you\nconsider your choices and make a\nprediction the these two things will\nreinforce the behavior it is not the\noutcome itself so a lot of people will\nwonder oh why should I bother doing this\nthis didn't work this didn't work this\ndidn't work how do I keep going how do I\nkeep going how do I motivate myself and\nit turns out that the what you need to\ndo is just have lots of choices and make\npredictions and those will increase your\nintentional binding so I hope this has\nbeen helpful to you'all I know it's kind\nof weird but let's just stop and think\nfor a second if there's no such thing as\nfree will we should be able to program\nour brains and what I really want youall\nto do is try this stuff right maybe it's\nnot even your choice anymore so go ahead\nand implement it do as much of this as\nyou can and report back\n[Music]"
