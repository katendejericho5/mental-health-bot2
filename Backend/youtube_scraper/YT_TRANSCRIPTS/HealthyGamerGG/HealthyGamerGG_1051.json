    "transcript": "i don't want want to be helped\nhello i'm currently lying in bed at 5 00\na.m after a bad night's sleep so this\nwill most likely be a mess but i need to\nvent some deep frustration and\nresentment i don't want to be helped\nit's been a thought i've had during the\nlast few months floating in my head i'm\ncurrently seeing a therapist just had my\nsixth or seventh session yesterday and\ni've told him about this feeling i have\nbut so far nothing has come out of it\nthat i can notice\nthe biggest problems i have currently\nare all all already covered by dr k and\nso asking advice on those particular\nproblems won't help\nsee early 20s male who has never had a\nsignificant other or sexual experiences\nlack of motivation to turn around in my\nlife lacking social and family life etc\nthis has obviously created\nresentment anger and frustration at both\nmyself and the world\nas an example of those feelings are are\nthe following\nwhy was i never able to form friendships\nin romantic relationships\nwhen i was starting to be\na teen like most teens\nafter all they're just teens how the f\ndid they even\nknow how to get into a relationship\neven the face of woeful despair and\nsuffering constantly feeling hurt sad\nand\nunsatisfied i don't want to be helped\nnor do i want to help myself\ni'd rather take the path that will keep\nme in constant pain that'll lead me to\nlive an unfulfilling life for the rest\nof my existence\nthe most advice i've gotten\nfrom my therapist is to try to see the\noptimism in my situation and to try to\nwork on my self-esteem whatever that\nmeans\ni recognize that my life is in a pitiful\nstate yet i lack the will and motivation\nto even try to think of a better\ntomorrow\ni wish i would have been born as a\ndifferent person a normal person with\nnormal developmental experiences\nthank you for reading this i wish you\nall the best\nokay\nall right so this is a really important\npost\nso sometimes in life\nwe\nare not doing well\nright\nand then like something funny happens\nlike there's this idea\nthat when we don't do well like we\nshould dig deep and we should find like\ninspiration\nand the further down we are like we're\ngonna have this epic comeback story of\nlike retribution and justice and like\nthe further behind i am like i want to\nbe that hero right i want to be the\nperson who like\nrises in the face of adversity and like\nyou know overcomes like all of these\nthings\nbut the truth is that for a lot of us\nlike\nwhen we're when our life is crap we\nactually bizarrely and we'll get will\nunderstand this we don't want to be\nhelped\nright we think we deserve this\nand so like not only do we not rise to\nthe challenge\nbut anytime we try to find motivation\nour mind tells us actually the exact\nopposite says like screw you\nyou don't actually deserve help like you\ndon't need to get better like what you\nwant is like\nyou know i don't want to be helped nor\ndo i want help i'd rather take the path\nthat will keep me in constant pain\nthat'll lead me like\nto live an unfulfilling life\nright isn't that kind of weird but\nthat's true right that happens to us our\nmind tells us screw you you deserve this\nand so how do we approach this how do we\nlike get out of this trap like what's\ngoing on here\nand i think the key word here is deserve\nright so like who is responsible for\nthis person's situation so if you guys\nwant to understand this like it comes\ndown to responsibility\nwho's responsible for this\nwhat do you all think\nwho created this situation\nyou did\nright\nyou created this situation\nlike why was i never able to form\nrelationships the normal people form\nrelationships but you weren't able to\nlike they don't even know how to form\nrelationships and they did it anyway but\ni wasn't able to\nright\nso then like\nif you're responsible for being\nunmotivated not having a significant\nother\nlife is going nowhere how do you feel\nabout yourself\nwhat how do you feel towards the person\nmaybe this is a better question how do\nyou feel towards the person who did this\nto your life\nhow do you feel about that person\nbecause they did this to you right\nyou're angry with them\nwhat do they deserve\nthey made your life\ncrap what's justice in this scenario\nright\nscrew that guy\nhe doesn't deserve to be happy he\ndoesn't deserve help\nwhat he deserves\nis constant pain\nbecause he screwed over my life and the\nonly justice\nis for him to suffer because he ruined\nmy life so hard\nright\nand so why don't you want help because\nyou don't deserve it\nwhy don't you deserve help because you\nscrewed up your life you had all the\nopportunities\nall the other incompetent teenagers\nmanaged to make friends and you didn't\nmanage to make friends\nthis is the way that you think about\nyourself this is the way that you feel\nabout yourself right so of course you're\ngonna reject help\nbecause you blame yourself\nfor creating this situation and like\nthat's logically consistent because who\nelse could have done it right like you\nwere in charge you were the one that\nchose not to do this not to do this and\nremember because now the some scar is\nactive now that the ahm car is active\nall you're going to see in yourself is\nlike\nyour self-blame\nright you're gonna look at all the\nthings that you screwed up in life\nand what you're never gonna notice\nis that how we're so if no one knows how\nto make friends why were some teens able\nto make friends and some teens weren't\nthat's actually not your fault there's\nsomething else going on here it's very\npossible that the people who were able\nto make friends\nhad home environments in which they were\nable to engage with other people maybe\nthey had parents who regularly\nintroduced them to strangers so they\nlearned how to make small talk maybe\nthey had large family gatherings where\nthey learned how to tolerate other kinds\nof things maybe they had large family\ngatherings where like they learned how\nto be funny\nmaybe they had you know their parents\nenrolled them in soccer so that they\ncould like play a game and like at the\nage of 15 they scored a goal and so they\nfelt really good about themselves the\nnext day\nthe fact that they felt really good\nabout themselves and felt confident made\nit easier for them to engage with\nanother person\nand maybe that's how they were able to\nmake friends maybe the reason they were\nable to make friends is because they\nwere enrolled in soccer and there were\nsome other kids who were in soccer and\nso i see those kids all the time\nand we hang out together automatically\nwithout any kind of pressure\nbut the problem is that when we start to\nhate ourselves and resent ourselves for\ncreating this life for ourselves right\nand i want you to kind of externalize it\nrecognize\nthat you know who is to blame for this\nthis person is a blame what do they\ndeserve they don't deserve anything good\ni want to punish them for doing this to\nme\nnow the reason we get screwed and it\nmakes sense right like i don't blame\nthis person for feeling this way in fact\nyou know just i want you all to think\nabout imagine this was an actual\nexternal person\nimagine you're in your 20s and someone\ndid something to you\nthat made it so that you you know\nit weren't motivated to do anything\nyou had never been in a relationship you\nlack a family life you lack a social\nlife\nlike imagine they destroyed your life\nlike this how would you feel towards\nthem\nyou would be very angry right and you\nwant to punish them\nnow the reason that this is really\ntricky is because that person is you\nright this person ends up being you and\nso you don't want to help that person\nin fact you want that person to not get\nany help you want to sentence them\nto the just\nlife of constant pain\nand so this is the problem\nright because what you're doing is\nsentencing yourself\nso how do you overcome this\nthe first thing\nis to recognize that like you are\njustifiably angry towards yourself\nright but the key thing here is that\nlike you've got to learn to forgive\nright like this is the key thing it's\nhard i'm not saying it's easy just\nforgive but understand that like\nthis is this is sort of you know what a\nlot of people taught like jesus taught\nthis gandhi taught this mlk taught this\nright turn the other cheek\nit's not an eye for an eye so as long as\nyou have an eye for an eye mentality\nthis is going to be the situation that\nyou get into\nand this is why like people have made\nthis discovery over the course of life\nright like over human existence people\nsort of said like hey forgiveness is\nactually the healthy way to live life\nright so like learn to forgive like why\ncan't you forgive yourself\nright\nlike\nstart to practice like compassion\nso and when i say practice i mean this\nis just practice i'm going to teach you\nhow do you practice compassion\nso think about 15 year old you like\nyou're angry at 15 year old you for not\nlike learning how to socialize right\nfine fair enough let's put ourselves in\nthe shoes of 15 year old you what was it\nlike\nbeing 15 year old you\nman it was terrifying like you didn't\nknow what to do and then like as you\nstart to like empathize with 15 year old\nyou like what do you start to discover\nyou're like well\nlike it's not like that person had all\nthe power in the world and threw it away\nright if we really start to empathize\nwith our 15 year old self it was social\nanxiety and terror every single day\nright and so he had it hard and then\nlike why am i like it's not his fault\nthat it was hard\nhe kind of did the best that he could\nlike could he have done better sure\nabsolutely but it's not like that does\n15 year old you deserve the sentence of\na life of constant pain no that's\nridiculous\nright so this is the process\nof empathy and self-compassion\nthis is how you literally practice\ngratitude it's not just forgive bro no\ndon't just forgive\nright like that's actually stupid don't\nforgive just\nonce again use observation like pay\nattention what was life like for a 15\nyear old you can i cut 15 year old me\nany kind of break\nif i could talk to 15 year old me today\nwhat would i say\nwould i say screw you you're gonna [ __ ]\nup the rest of my life\nno like you're not gonna say that right\nlike there may be a part of you that\nwants to say that\nbut that's not what you would actually\nsay to 15 year old you because you\nremember what it was like to be a 15\nyear old you\nright it's okay to want to say that but\nyou're not going to do that that's like\ncruel and that's not who you\nso you're you're going to try to be a\nlittle bit empathic\nand this is key\nbecause when you say if you agree with\nme when i say that i'm not going to say\nthat because that's not who i am\nboom\nyou've given yourself a little capacity\nfor forgiveness\nright if you agree with me that you\nwould not have been beaten up 15 year\nold you\nthen you've learned a little bit of\ncompassion you've learned a little bit\nof empathy\nright and you've like taken the first\nstep into a tiny amount of forgiveness\nand once you like take that tiny step\nlike you can take it again and again and\nagain and again\nand once you have forgiven yourself\nonce you're able to want 15 year old you\nto get some help and that it's\nacceptable to help them you yourself\nwill be able to accept other people's\nhelp\nyou yourself will be able to want to be\nhelped\nbut it has to come with you first of all\nletting go of the sentence that you're\nputting on yourself it's the judgment\nit's this idea that i deserve this\nright and if you deserve it of course\nyou're not going to find any motivation\nto change it right because it's what's\njust it's like the motivation is not to\nchange it it's to actually make that\nprophecy come true you want to carry out\nthe sentence against yourself so you're\nhighly motivated to not change which is\nexactly what we see\nand then we get confused and we beat\nourselves up because we're like well\nlike why don't why am i not motivated to\nchange i wish i was motivated to change\ni wish i was motivated to change and\nthen you beat yourself up even more and\nthen you've tacked on 15 more years to\nyour life sentence and the cycle repeats\nand there's less forgiveness and less\nforgiveness and more judgment more\njudgment you screw it up you screw it up\nyou screw it up and then like you're\njust like there's no hope for you right\nso take a step back from all of it first\nof all recognize and forgive yourself\nfor being in this situation\nlike you're not\nyou're not a complete idiot right like\nyou're just human just like the rest of\nus\nand sometimes we have a constellation of\nthings that happen to us that and\nwe end up getting stuck\nright like sometimes we just get stuck\nin the mud in life and then like the\nmore that you spin your wheels the more\nyou get stuck in the mud and this is\nexactly what we're seeing here\nthat it is our reaction to things that\npropagate the problems\nis our strategy that we use that\nactually digs the hole we're in\nright\nand so start by sort of taking a step\nback start by recognizing that there is\na part of you that wishes to punish\nyourself\nfor putting you in this situation and\nthat that part is completely valid\nit's not wrong\nright but it's incomplete\nand there's more to the story than that\nthat thinking is not so black and white\nthat you don't deserve a life of\nconstant pain did you screw up here or\nthere absolutely could you have done\nbetter absolutely\nbut what you need from yourself is not\nto carry out a sentence of judgment what\nyou need is like a little bit of pep\ntalk at halftime and get your ass back\nin the game and like do the best that\nyou can you can still win this that's\nwhat you need from yourself\nand so that starts by first of all\nempathizing with your 15 year old you\nand remembering how hard it was to be\nthem\nand recognize as well if you can if you\ncan get this far that five years from\nnow you can even empathize with mid-20s\nyou\nright like\ndo you deserve some compassion here like\nis your life genuinely hard sure it's\nyour fault but now you're here\nand you have no motivation and like\ncould you\nuse a little bit of tlc\nabsolutely\nand if you can if you can sort of admit\nthat to yourself then you're starting to\nwalk the path of forgiveness\nso it's like gratitude and compassion\nhave to be practiced\nright so i'll give you guys one other\nkind of like meditative practice\nthe next time someone pisses you off a\ntiny amount\ntry to practice some kind of gratitude\nor compassion towards them and when you\nsay practice what do you mean dr k it\ncan feel fake that's okay but i want you\nto do it anyway so i want you all to go\nplay a pub game of some competitive\nmultiplayer like moba is ideal right\nyou're gonna have some guy who's gonna\nfeed and cause you to lose the game\nand then like i want you to literally\nsay to them better luck next time dude\nlike you'll do it\nlike\ni recognize that maybe i was frustrated\nwith you but like i didn't play perfect\neither\npractice\npractice some kind of gratitude or\ncompassion towards someone else in your\ngame\nright like do that\npractice it and when you go but you say\noh doctor i don't feel it that's okay i\nwant you to do it right it's a practice\nso do it practice some kind of\ncompassion towards someone else\nlike set aside your own feelings and\nrecognize okay like how does it\nfeel to\nthrow the game\nthat you were playing when you guys were\nwinning\nit feels really bad and so what do you\ndo with those emotions you take it out\non everyone else you flame the rest of\nthe universe\nand what people need in that moment when\nyou screw up your you know your ulta\nlike\nin the last\nteam fight\nlike you're you're so angry at yourself\nyou can't even handle and you start\nbeating up on other people flaming all\nthese other noobs so practice a little\nbit of compassion right so remember what\nit's like to be if if your teammate just\nlost you the game remember what it's\nlike when you lose people game it sucks\nso try to practice a little bit of\ncompassion say hey\nwe'll get them next time dude you played\nreally well like you know we all made\nmistakes\ngood luck on your next game practice\nsome compassion\nthat's how we become compassionate\nthrough practice\nyou"
