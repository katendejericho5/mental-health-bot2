    "transcript": "so let's talk a little bit about adhd\nso adhd when you are passionate about\nwhat you're doing i've been working on\nthis project for 10 hours straight i've\naccomplished in one day what would take\na normal person an entire week nothing\ncan stop me i'm a god\nan adhd when you aren't passionate about\nwhat you're doing washing dish is very\nhard right so this is like a pretty\nfunny meme\ni think that part of the reason that\nthese memes get made and the reason that\nthey propagate right and get a bunch of\nupvotes\nis because people can\nreally uh\num identify with this experience like\nthat so a lot of people with adhd will\nbe aware that their attention can\nsometimes get hyper focused on a\nparticular thing\nand if that thing happens to be\nsomething good for them\nthey like can really do an awesome job\nlike if they can get super caught up in\nparticular things learn a lot about\nstuff\num you know like get super into crypto\nfor example and then like read crypto\nstuff for like 10 hours and like learn a\nton about crypto\nand then the the challenge though is\nthat it's not really your choice what\nyou choose to hyper focus on and so it\nfeels a little bit like a roll of the\ndice where like if it's if it's a good\nthing to get hyper focused on that's\nawesome right and then we're over here\non the left and if it's not a good thing\nto focus on then you kind of wind up on\nthe right\nso we're going to talk a little bit\nabout this phenomenon but before we do i\nwant to share actually a post um which\nwe're not going to go over the whole\nthing because it's it's relatively long\nuh but i think that it's actually like a\nreally good post so someone in our\ncommunity a few days ago mentioned that\nthey had serious concerns about your\nadhd is it actually an advantage video\nand so um\nyou know they go on to sort of talk a\nlot about myths some of which i kind of\ntalk about they also cite\num you know dr russell barkley who's an\nexpert on adhd\nand and so they're sort of sharing some\nof the concerns about the ways that we\nrepresent adhd or we talk about adhd for\nwhat it's worth i i kind of responded to\nthe post and stuff like that and some of\nthe things that i sort of said about\nsome of the other videos and i sort of\nsaid i completely understand your\ncriticism for what it's worth we're\ngoing to be like revisiting or we've\nalready started the process of\nrevisiting how we title our videos\num so that feedback has been really\nreally useful because i think this\nperson had a super super valid point\nand so hopefully as a result of this\nfeedback um you know we'll improve and\ntherefore we'll be able to help more\npeople so we're always open to feedback\nfor people who are sort of telling us\nhey we think you should be doing this\nbetter um and we have concerns about\nthis and this and as long as it sort of\nsupports the mission of what we're\ntrying to accomplish at hg we're more\nthan happy to receive it in fact we\ndepend on it right that's how we've\ngotten to where we are today is based on\nthe feedback of of the people that\nsupport them the work that we do\nso um\nso then part of what this kind of comes\ndown to is there's this idea that\nif we kind of go back to this meme that\nlike if you have adhd and you're\npassionate about something and if you\nget kind of like\ninto something that you can spend 10\nhours straight doing it\nso this is where it's really important\nto remember that adhd is a is a\ndiagnosis of disordered attention right\nso disordered attention what most people\nthink of with adhd is that you can't\nfocus on a particular thing and that\nyour mind is very distractible and\nwanders\nbut when we talk about disordered\nattention and this is really common i\nremember talking especially to parents\nwho have adolescent kids\nwho when i mentioned adhd\nas a potential diagnosis the parents\nwould be super surprised they're like\nwell you know\nwe didn't\nhe can our kid can like sit down and and\nread comic books for like eight hours\nstraight so if he's capable of doing\nthat like doesn't that mean it's not\nadhd\nand so adhd is a disordered attention\nand what we mean by disordered attention\nis not only that you can't force your\nmind to focus on what you want it to and\ninstead it gets distracted but the\nopposite is also true which i think\nwe've mentioned several times on stream\nis that sometimes you get stuck on a\nparticular thing and you can't shake\nthat thought\nwhen it's really a good idea to shake\nthat thought\nand at the same time we also have you\nknow some interesting um\nperspectives on this so like here's a\nhere's an example of so\nthe person thankfully you know mentioned\nrussell barkley and i was somewhat\nfamiliar with his work but as a\nconsequence of of um the posters\nfeedback so i looked at a lot more of\nhis work and i i kind of uh uh i want to\nshare with y'all a quote from russell\nbarkley or i think can we watch youtube\nor does it get banned we can watch\nyoutube right so here here's\nalso another popular phrase in some of\nthe adult adhd trade books adults with\nadhd are good at hyper focusing this too\nis mythology\nhyper focusing is actually perseveration\nyou are unable to interrupt what you're\ndoing\nwhen you should have shifted to doing\nsomething else\nit is like the child who continues to\nplay the video game\nlong after they should have been getting\ndressed for school and out to the bus\nyou want to call that hyper focusing\nthat's fine but that is a classic sign\nof a frontal lobe injury and it is\nperseverative responding\nyou should have stopped what you're\ndoing\nand you didn't there were other more\nimportant goals to have been\naccomplished and you ignored them\nthis is no gift it is in fact a symptom\nof this disorder\nhyper focusing goes with autism\nperseveration goes with adhd\nthere's a little bit of a context there\nwhich is he i think he's answering a\nquestion about the difference between\nperseveration and hyper focusing but i\nthink he brings up a really excellent\npoint\nthe challenge is that you know if you\ntalk to people with adhd and i've\ncertainly been in this camp\num\ndespite the fact that\nhyper focusing is an attribute of a\ndisorder\nyou're going to have people who have\nthis experience right whatever you call\nit this injury gift has been responsible\nfor every single achievement in my life\nand this is also why we have these kinds\nof memes because the experience of\npeople with adhd\nis um\nfor some of those people the hyper\nfocusing seems to be an advantage\nand as we sort of start to look a little\nbit at the research um you know there's\nsome talk about neurodiversity for\nexample so like there's a growing\nmovement within the mental health field\nthat um some of these things may not be\nyou shouldn't it's not appropriate to\ncategorize them as illnesses but this\nthis is a situation of neurodiverse\nversus neurotypical\num i have my reservations about some of\nthese concepts which i'll kind of get to\nin a second but you know there seems to\nbe like some exploration of what we've\ntraditionally thought of is is mental\nillnesses and whether some of these\nmental illnesses can possibly have\ngood effects right so we have some\nexperts like russell barkley that say\nthat this is hands down\nkind of uh the myth of hyper focus is is\nin a sense false um this is a sign of\nlike it's it's correlated with a frontal\nlobe injury which is absolutely correct\num so there's there's a lot of you know\nuseful stuff that he has to say but\nthere are different perspectives\nso this is a paper that was um published\nin neuroscience and behavioral reviews\nthat sort of examined creativity and\nadhd\nand was sort of looking at was a review\nthat looked at 31 studies and sort of\nlike went over you know what is the\nrelationship between adhd and and\ncreativity\nand essentially like there's a lot of\nlike mixed stuff in here i think a lot\nof the conclusions that they come to are\nsomewhat questionable\nbut there are a few interesting findings\nfrom from this study so one is that\nmost studies find evidence for increased\ndivergent thinking for those with high\nadhd scores but not for those with the\ndisorder clinical\nso what does this mean so we're going to\nunpack this statement a little bit so\ndivergent thinking is essentially\ncorrelated with like or that's how they\nsort of describe or try to measure\ncreativity so when i sort of have a\nparticular i'm faced with a particular\nproblem generally speaking we tend to\num\nyou know approach it a particular way\nand people who think divergently will be\nable to like draw on different kinds of\nperspectives or think about it in in a\nnon-standard way so this is sometimes\nused in the literature as a correlation\nfor um\nuh\ncreativity\nand so what one of the main findings of\nthis review\nis that like\nthere are people who score highly in\nterms of adhd symptoms that don't quite\nmeet a clinical threshold so we're going\nto talk a little bit about what that\nmeans\num but when you sort of cross over into\nthe clinical threshold the apparent\nbenefits of adhd aren't really\nmeasurable\nso\nanother sort of major movement in the\nrealm of adhd research is sort of this\ngeneral call for\nmore research opportunities to boost the\nknowledge needed to better understand\nthe potential positive side of adhd and\nthis is something that is not\nyou know this is these are not the only\npeople that are sort of saying this\nso\nthis is another paper that sort of looks\nthis is qualitative research so these\nwere people that were kind of doing\ninstead of like administering\ninstruments and stuff like that um they\nsat down with i think just a handful of\npeople like a really small sample size\nand they sort of asked them questions\nabout you know like what is your\nexperience of adhd and like you know\nwhat are some of the advantages things\nlike that and so what they sort of\ndiscovered is that\nyou know there's some amount of\ndivergent thinking or creativity that\nthere is a hyper focus element\nthat there's a cognitive dynamism which\nis sort of like a positive thing like\nsort of a sense of adventurousness so\nthis is another example of um you know\nsome of the research that's sort of\nstarting to explore potential good sides\nof adhd and we'll talk a little bit\nabout you know what exactly adhd is and\nwhy there are these\ndisparate perspectives\nso there are lots of papers about this\nkind of stuff\nand so\nyou know what i'd like to share with you\nall today is just how i understand adhd\nand why i think there are so many\ndifferent perspectives so let's start by\nsort of summarizing what are the\ndifferent perspectives so on the one\nhand you have people like russell\nbarkley or a lot of clinicians including\nmyself sort of\nthat clearly acknowledge that adhd is a\ndisorder right so like in the field of\npsychiatry we diagnose things that are\ndisorders and by definition they're sort\nof impairments of function\nnow the interesting thing is on the\nother side we've got people who um like\nso we'll have people on the internet\nright so like like the random person\nwhich is not data it's just like one\nperson's experience who says it's my\nability to hyper focus that has allowed\nme to like achieve everything that i\nhave in life and i've certainly worked\nwith patients who\nhave that perspective as well where\nthey've really found that kind of\ngetting control of their adhd and sort\nof playing to the benefit of their\ncapacity to hyper focus there are even\nsome papers but i really didn't think\nthese were very rigorous that sort of\nequate the hyper focus of adhd to the\nflow state which i think is actually\nquite different\nbut there are definitely a lot of people\nmyself included who have um somewhat\nadhd minds like i'm pretty sure that if\ni was a kid and i ever got evaluated for\nadhd like i'm pretty sure that i would\nhave been diagnosed with adhd\nso just thinking through the diagnostic\ncriteria like i think i check a lot of\nthose boxes but i think that i fall\nunder the category of people who are a\nlittle bit more subclinical and so what\ndoes that mean\nso i think a lot of the reason that we\nhave such a diverse perspective on adhd\nis because\nwhen we think about adhd in the western\nmedical sense when you think about\nwestern medical diagnosis\nit's binary right so what we do in in\npsychiatry is like we diagnose you or we\ndon't diagnose you so this is just the\nstructure\nof our\nmedical field it's not necessarily true\nit's just how we've organized medicine\nso if i were to ask you like you know\nlike if we're investigating like let's\nsay someone who's passed away and\nsomeone will say what was the cause of\ndeath\nand like the coroner will say it was a\nmyocardial infarction it was a heart\nattack so this is the kind of thing\nwhere like in medicine we tend to label\nthings in a binary way whether you like\nmeet criteria for the disorder or you\ndon't meet criteria for the disorder\npractically clinically it's not quite as\nbinary right so if you diagnose with\nsomeone with depression everyone knows a\nmajor depressive disorder\neveryone knows both patients and\nclinicians especially that there's\nseverities of major depressive disorder\nright not all major depressive disorder\nare created equally and similarly with\nadhd i think a big part of this problem\nis that adhd is actually a spectrum\nit isn't a homogeneous disease that\naffects people homogenously so as a\nresult like this is sort of an\nartificiality artificial\nbinary like imposement that we're doing\non adhd and so then what happens is we\nget disparate perspectives because we've\nactually got a bell curve of adhd\nsymptoms and people are at different\nplaces in terms of the severity of their\nadhd how beneficial their adhd is and\nwe'll kind of talk about that in a\nsecond\nand so i think the simplest reason that\nwe get some of these these disparate\nperspectives it's not that one person is\nright and one person is wrong i think my\nexperience as a clinician has been that\nyou know people tend to experience\nmental health in a very individual way\nbut that there's actually a perspective\nyou know there's a scale of different\nperspectives and this is part of the\nreason that you know when i first\nstarted talking about adhd i talked a\nlot about ayurveda because i had\npersonally found that the ayurvedic\nconception of adhd\nfit\nbetter\nwas a better fit for people's\nexperiences than actually like the\nwestern binary sort of perspective on\nadhd\npart of the reason that we've sort of\nscaled back on our ayurvedic discussion\nrecently is there was once again another\npost that offered a lot of really good\ncriticisms about some of the scientific\nstudies we were citing and the low\nquality of those studies so i don't know\nif you all have noticed but we've sort\nof taken a step back from ayurveda that\ndoesn't mean that we aren't we're\nactually actively revisiting it so we're\nsort of looking through the research and\nreally trying to to read tons and tons\nof articles to really figure out okay\nwhat is it what can we say let's like\nsort of scientifically valid and like\nyou know what is like more of our\ninterpretation which by the way i'm\ntotally fine doing right so i'm totally\nfine on stream and i i hope you know i\nmake this pretty clear that sometimes\nwhat i'm saying is very supported by\nscience sometimes what i'm saying is\nmore supported by clinical experience\nand sometimes what i'm saying is not\nbased on medicine or science at all but\nis more personal or spiritual in nature\nand i think a lot of the people that\nappreciate our community are ones that\nsort of appreciate the spectrum because\nthere are different ways of looking at\nthings\nand so kind of going back to adhd i\nthink that the challenge is that there\nare you know a spectrum of different\nexperiences\nas a result people are going to have\ndifferent perspectives on how impairing\nadhd is\nand so i think the the important thing\nto kind of remember there are a few\nimportant takeaways the the first is\nthat adhd\nis a spectrum\num and the part of the reason that you\nknow this spectrum exists is because\nthere are some\ncomponents of\nadhd that may be or of the adhd spectrum\nlet's let's not even call it the the\nadhd spectrum so there are components of\nthe attentional spectrum which can be\nbeneficial to human beings\nand this is where even if you look at\nother illnesses there are cases where\nillnesses can form advantages for people\nnow we're not i don't think for example\nthat\nit's necessarily good to have an illness\ni think generally speaking if you get\ndiagnosed with a psychiatric disorder on\nbalance that is going to hurt you\nsignificantly more than it will help you\nthat being said there are some\nadvantages so for example when i was\nworking in the massachusetts general\nhospital emergency room we saw a lot of\nstudents from harvard and mit and what\nwe sort of observed is i don't know if\nthere's published research about this\nbut talking to people at mit health\nservices and harvard health services is\nthat they're the prevalence of type 2\nbipolar disorder\nat ivy league institutions or very\ncompetitive institutions seem to be\nsignificantly higher than the average\npopulation and when i talked to these\nkids who were like you know undergrads\nat mit like\nthey were terrified of of getting their\nbipolar disorder treated why is that\nbecause their bipolar disorder type 2\nbipolar allowed them\nto\nsleep for two to four hours a night and\nbe able to be like focused and very like\naction oriented and study a lot and\nthings like that and a lot of them were\nactually really reluctant to engage in\ntreatment because they had found some\nadvantages to the way that their bipolar\ndisorder worked\nnow once again on balance it was my kind\nof experience and generally speaking you\nknow i would recommend strongly\nrecommend treatment to these people\nbecause\neven though there may be particular\nsituations in which a particular mental\nillness offers an advantage on the whole\nit's like it hurts more than helps so\nlike sure you're sleeping two to four\nhours a night for the two weeks before\nfinals because you're hypomanic and it\nhelps you do well on your finals but\nthen for the next three months six\nmonths\nyou're you crash you go into a deep\ndepression and your grades the next\nsemester are absolute trash because like\nyou know you're depressed so so even\nthough an illness may have particular\nadvantages in particular cases that on\nbalance has been my overwhelming\nexperience as a clinician\nthat you don't really it's not worth it\nessentially\nand so the kind of the next thing that i\nwant to talk about so just to review a\nlittle bit about what we talked about so\nthe first is why is there you know why\ndo people share these different\nperspectives um and that's because i\nthink that you know illnesses are not\nhomogenous right and depending on\nwho you're talking to and what the\nexperience of that person is\num there you're gonna get sort of\ndifferent answers the second point is\nthat i think there is some evidence that\nirrespective of what the mental illness\nis that there are some components of\nthose fundamental functions\nwhich can be beneficial so even if we\nlook at something like depression in the\ndefault mode network so one of my one of\nthe hypotheses that i kind of subscribe\nto\nis that major depressive disorder\ninvolves hyperactivation of this part of\nour brain called the default mode\nnetwork and the default mode network is\nthe part of our brain it's not really a\nplace it's a network\nso it's not localized to like a\nparticular anatomical region\nis responsible for self-reflection so it\ngives us the ability to think about\nourselves and when people get depressed\nthey get stuck thinking about only\nthemselves themselves in a negative way\nso it's sort of a hyperactivation of\nthat but the default mode network is\nactually a really useful part of our\nbrain and if we look at what mental\nillness is it tends to be that our brain\nsort of functions a particular way\nand then if parts of our brain become\nhyperactive or hypoactive or even\nthe\nas a human being we interact in a\nparticular social circumstance or an\nenvironmental circumstance\nthat sort of\nexposes some of the vulnerabilities of\nof however our brain functions then we\ncan get diagnosed with a disorder\na good example of this for example is\nthat you know kids are more likely to be\nuh diagnosed with adhd if the ratio of\nstudents to teachers in a classroom is\nbad so if there's tons of students and\nvery few teachers you're more likely to\ndiagnose kids with adhd than if the\nstudent-teacher ratio is more favorable\nright so that sort of suggests to us\nthat people will present\nfor psychiatric help it's not just\nwhat's going on in your brain it's brain\nplus circumstance and that theory by the\nway i think is relatively well supported\nso when we think a little bit about\npsychiatric illness even things like\nmajor depressive disorder oftentimes\nwhat we'll find is that there's a\ngenetic predisposition or maybe a family\nhistory and then a particular\ncircumstance triggers the depression\nright so like you were totally fine\nuntil the age of 26 when you got fired\nfrom your job and then you know your\npartner broke up with you and then you\nhad to move back home with your parents\nand that sort of triggered the\ndepression\nnow did those sort of cause the\ndepression sure but then then what\nhappens is like there's an independent\nneurochemical process which starts in\nyour brain which may go beyond the\ncircumstances so then let's say you\nstart dating again and you find a new\njob and you move out of your parents\nplace but you still feel\nsuper depressed that's a good example of\nseparating out you know the disease from\nthe general\ntrigger from the disease\nanother thing about the researcher on\nadhd is that i think that\nas people sort of pointed out when they\nwere kind of um if you look at some of\nthese papers on you know creativity and\nstuff one of the things that they point\nout is that research opportunities to\nboost the knowledge needed better better\nunderstand the positive potential\npositive side of adhd there are almost\nalways calls for you know more um\nuh moreover the sizable prevalence of\nhyper focus in adults with high levels\nof adhd symptoms symptomology leads to\nthe need to study it as a potential\nseparable feature from adhd\nright so generally speaking a lot of\npeople are call calling for more\nresearch on the positives of adhd\nand why is that it's because generally\nspeaking\nwhen we look at studying an illness\nthe first kind of selection bias tends\nto be towards the sickest people so\nanother good example of this is like if\nyou look at the research on sociopathy\na lot of the conclusions that we draw on\nsociopathy are based on populations\nwhere you can find and recruit\nsociopathic individuals\nand can anyone guess where is the\nlargest most consistent population of\nsociopathic\nindividuals\nthat you can easily recruit for studies\nprisons\nright\nand so as a result what we've got in our\nresearch is that we're studying like the\nour inclusion criteria and stuff like\nthat right because you've got to think a\nlittle bit about the perspective of a\nresearcher if i want to conduct a study\non adhd\nam i\nmore likely to take\nsomeone who's definitely got adhd or\nsomeone who's kind of on the border\nright so i'm my inclusion criteria are\ngoing to be like relatively strict\nin terms of like i definitely want\npeople who\ni know have adhd because that's how\nwe're going to learn about the illness\nand the truth is that somewhere in that\nmiddle ground those people may actually\nhave adhd but it's just less of a\nclear-cut decision requires like a full\nclinical evaluation which by the way\nwhen people are recruiting for studies\nthey don't do usually do full clinical\nevaluations with neuropsyc testing and\nall that kind of stuff right so usually\nlike we'll use some kinds of\nstandardized instruments you fill a\ncouple forms and if your numbers are\nsuper high you get enrolled in the study\ndrug manufacturers by the way also do\nthis because there's evidence that shows\nthat for example the sicker you are the\nmore antidepressant medication helps\nand so what they'll tend to do is if\nthey want to show a big benefit if they\nsay that this is going to make your\ndepression you know way better the\nlarger largest benefits are going to\ntend to be seen in the sickest number of\npeople so another simple example of this\nis let's say i've got you know a 101\nfever\nand a 103 fever and i take antipyretic\nmedication\nboth of those in both of those cases\nchances are the antipyretic medication\nis going to break my fever and bring me\nback down to 98.6 but if i'm a drug\nmanufacturer\ni can say that the effect size is way\nbetter if i recruit people who are like\n103 right so now i can show a larger\nmagnitude of change\nso i think another big bias that is in\nour research i don't blame it like this\nis where we've got to start somewhere\nright\nis that if you look at like studies on\nadhd they tend to focus on the sicker\npeople they tend not to focus on this\nkind of subclinical population if you\ncall it subclinical that means that they\nmay not even meet the disorder the\ncriteria for the disorder or they may\nmeet the criteria for the disorder so i\npersonally as a psychiatrist have seen a\nton of people who um meet criteria for\nthe disorder but can actually manage and\nand even utilize some of the dynamic\nnature of their mind it's something that\ni myself have sort of learned how to\nmanage\nand by the way um you know there's\nstudies that show that kind of\nbehavioral interventions or\npsychotherapy interventions like\ncognitive behavioral therapy can be just\nas efficacious as medication and\ntreating adhd and i've had a lot of\nexperience with people who you know once\nthey sort of understand how to manage\ntheir adhd can actually like perform\nreally really well and i will hear these\nkinds of things where people will say\nyou know i'm really glad actually my you\nknow the dynamic nature of my mind\nreally manages helps me keep up with a\nlot of stuff so i'll give you guys just\none quick example of a friend of mine\nwho um you know we went to medical\nschool together and then they really\nfound they struggled a lot because they\nhad adhd and so they actually left\nmedicine and moved into the field of\ncommercial real estate and what they\nreally found is that like all of the\nways in which\ntheir difficulties sitting there and\nreading a book\nwas a handicap in the field of medicine\nwhich it absolutely was their brain was\nnot functioning the way that most of\ntheir colleagues were\nactually seemed to them subjectively to\nbe an advantage in the field of like\ncommercial real estate because they\ncould manage like a thousand different\ntasks they were really good at\nmultitasking\ninterestingly enough they could also\nread contracts that were 50 pages long\nso i don't really understand what\nhappened there\nbut\nthe point here is that you know people\nhave diverse experiences i've also had\npatients who are the very opposite of\nthat and that adhd for them is\nabsolutely a disorder absolutely an\nimpairment and absolutely like wrecks\nevery dimension of their life so this is\nnot just like affecting their\nprofessional life or academic life but\nreally impacts their relationships\nbecause when their partner tells them\nhey are you going to go to the grocery\nstore and they're not paying attention\nand they say yeah i'm going to go and\nthey're like can you please pick up\nthese three things and they said yeah\nokay sure\nthey think they're paying attention but\nthey're not paying attention and then\nlike six hours later\nwhen it's dinner time and then the sp\nlike partner asked them hey like where's\nthat stuff and they're like what stuff\nand they're like the stuff that you said\nyou were gonna go get what what are you\ntalking about\nright so this is where it's like it's\nokay for adhd to be sort of a spectrum\nand it's okay for people to have\ndifferent experiences of it\nand if you are someone who is concerned\nthat you have adhd what should you do\nabout it right so like what do i know\nwhat should i believe should i believe\nrussell barkley a random person on the\ninternet this paper that talks about\nadhd is a potential source of increased\ncreativity like what should i believe\nand this is where i'd say at the end of\nthe day like you have to kind of decide\nfor yourself right because it is a\nspectrum not all all illnesses are the\nsame within all people\nso depression is going to manifest in a\ndiscreet and unique way in every single\nperson that's ever lived because the way\nthat that that illness manifests\nis shaped by your personal experiences\nyour history you know your background\nyour coping mechanisms your strengths\nyour support structures and that's why\nwe have clinicians at least so far\ninstead of robots\nwhy do we have clinicians it's because\nit takes a human being to integrate all\nof this research\nand sort of apply it to you\nand sort of figure out okay for your\nindividual situation which are the\nresearch studies that are the most\napplicable\nand so what i'd recommend to anyone out\nthere who is you know concerned that\nthey may have adhd is i wouldn't default\nto believing that this is necessarily\ngoing to be an advantage there's also a\nlot of like psychological stuff about\nyou know like not wanting to believe\nthat you are ill in some way or coming\nto terms with the fact that if you do\nhave an illness like that just sucks and\nit's a straight negative and this is\nwhere like we want to believe you know\nthat the world is an equal place we as a\nsociety should we strive to make it\nequal absolutely but you know as a\nmedical doctor like\ni don't know if i believe that the world\nand the universe is an equal place\ni mean i've seen like kids\neight-year-olds diagnosed with cancer\nand i don't think that like buying the\nchildhood cancer flaw during character\ncreation necessarily gives you like\npoints elsewhere sometimes those kids\nhappen to be poor sometimes those kids\nhappen to have an abusive parent and\nit's not like i really wish it was i\nwish that every human being on the\nplanet had the same pool of points for\ncharacter creation but the sad truth is\nthat that's not how it is\nand so some people really want to\nbelieve that like there's some silver\nlining to their experience and there may\nbe i don't i don't really know\nbut i think at the end of the day what\nyou've really got to do is if you're\nconcerned about it first of all go see a\nlicensed clinician right i talk a lot\nabout the benefits of our coaching\nprogram but this is not really\nappropriate for coaching\ngo see a licensed clinician someone\nwho's actually trained in mental health\nstuff and try to figure out okay like do\ni actually have do i meet the threshold\nfor a clinical diagnosis\nfurthermore\neven if you do meet the clinic of the\nthreshold for a clinical diagnosis that\ndoes not\nyou know that's not that doesn't set\nyour life in stone\nlike there you you may fall into the\ncategory of people who first of all\ndon't need medication or can manage\ntheir symptoms without medication you\nmay be able to you know get control of\nthe hyper focus in a way that i've seen\nmy patients sometimes do for lack of a\nbetter term\nor you may be part of the the group that\nyou know\ncan't get control of your hyper focus\nand your hyper focus is a straight\nnegative or which is more much more\ncommon and i'd say the most common is\nthat at times the hyper focus works in\nyour favor and at times the hyper focus\nreally doesn't work in your favor kind\nof like the example that russell barkley\nwas talking about which is like yeah\nyou're playing video games and you\nreally should have gotten up and and\ngotten onto the bus\nand so at the end of the day adhd is is\nin my opinion a much more diverse and\npoorly understood disease than we\nsometimes give it credit for i\nabsolutely believe that there is you\nknow a threshold beyond which it is a\ndisorder and on balance negatively\nimpacts your life\nbut just because it on balance negative\nand negatively impacts your life doesn't\nmean that you can't learn to live with\nit\nlearn to either reduce the symptoms or\neven develop or extract some kinds of\npositives from your illness experience\nand the last example about that that\ni'll share with y'all is i've worked\nwith a couple of people who are artists\nand sometimes as i talk to them about\nyou know their experience of depression\ni'll sort of\ndescribe them as having what i call the\nartistic temperament that i genuinely do\nbelieve that a lot of the the wonderful\ncreative work that is done by musicians\ni've worked with um budding authors i\nshould say\num you know and and\ni really hope they become successful\nauthors one day but what i really come\nto appreciate about some of their work\nis that their personal experiences of\nmental health allow them to describe\nlike emotionally and limbically like the\nexperience the difficult experience of\nbeing a human being\nand so that translates into their music\nthat translates into their writing that\ntranslates into you know filmmaking\nand so as a result like it's not that\nit's all negative i mean they're they're\ndefinitely it's part of who you are\nright and this is i think ultimately the\nway that i view mental illness\nwhich is that it's not like discrete\nlike sure does it impair your function\nabsolutely but as a human being you are\na constellation of all of your pieces\nand some of your pieces are going to\nscrew you over more than other pieces\nyou're going to have some advantages\nyou're going to have some disadvantages\nand just because something is an illness\ndoesn't mean that it can't be you know a\npart of your life and the only solution\nis to like rip it out root and stem i\nknow a lot of people who have come to\nlive with their mental illness in a very\nhealthy and productive way\nnot saying that it should be untreated\nin fact the majority of those people who\ndo learn how to like you know live\nhealthily with their mental illness do\nso through treatment and just as in a\nquick you know reminder of a source that\nwe've already mentioned\num\ni want to just highlight this sentence\nhere so we found no evidence for\nincreased convergent thinking abilities\nin adhd nor did we find an overall\nnegative effect of psychostimulants on\ncreativity so i think this is a really\nimportant statement to understand and\nthis is what you know for all the people\nthat i worked with who were undergrads\nyou know in boston\nthat were had type 2 bipolar disorder\nthis is the main conclusion is that you\nmay think that treatment of your thing\nwill you will lose the advantages but in\nmy overwhelming experience getting\ntreatment for your mental illness is\ngoing to be like a net positive right\nit's not like you're gonna lose the\nperson that you are it may take a little\nwhile so this is like my experience with\npeople with bipolar disorder who are\nartists\nit takes time and more effort to find\nyour creative process again right like\njust because you're an artist who goes\non manic binges and like paints a bunch\nof like really drastic stuff and then if\nyou start treating your bipolar disorder\nlike the people will come to me and\nthey'll be like i can't paint anymore\nand it's like\nit can feel that way and then sometimes\nthey make the mistake of going off of\ntreatment but in my overwhelming\nexperience it's just about\nre-accessing that that part of yourself\nbecause mental illness is about a loss\nof control of the mind\nright being able to focus for 10 hours\nis not a bad thing it's the inability to\nchoose\nwhat you focus on when you focus on it\nfor 10 hours that's the bad thing that's\nwhen the illness gets the best of you\nright\nso a big part of learning to live with\nmental illness is\nsometimes our mental illness gives us a\nshortcut and can give us advantages we\nsee that with the type 2 of bipolar\ndisorder do where it's like these people\nare relying on the the hypomania to help\nthem study whereas like if you start\ntreating your bipolar disorder the\nhypomania won't let you study but it's\nnot like you can you can't study without\nhypomania right it's just like you're\ngonna have to learn some new skills\nbecause it's almost like you've been\nusing a little bit of this automatic you\nknow type 2 main type 2 bipolar disorder\ncrotch or this adhd crutch or whatever\nso it can definitely be an uphill battle\nit can be difficult but at the end of\nthe day it's almost always or just just\nabout always worth getting treatment\nbecause the truth is you're not going to\nlose the good parts of you if you enter\ninto psychiatric treatment in fact\nwhat's probably going to happen is the\nopposite is that it may be a little bit\nof an uphill climb for a little while\nthere may be a little bit of a learning\ncurve but it's been my overwhelming\nexperience that at the end of that climb\npeople are way happier and really glad\nthey engaged in treatment\nyou"
