    "transcript": "it may seem a little bit weird to do\nthat if you're like in a conversation\nwith someone please don't do that\ndon't do that like as you're walking\nthrough the door don't\nsnuck now\num and then and then kind of just notice\nyeah maybe don't do that\nokay\nso my boyfriend called a twitch streamer\nhis queen\nhold on a second\nuh i moved the overlay\noh no\nthere\nfixed\nthanks ryan\nlet me lock these\ni have to lock them okay\nall right\nso my boyfriend called the twitch\nstreamer his queen um i don't know what\nto\nwhat to do he says he thought it was\nfunny i don't think it's funny at all\nso what should you do when your\nboyfriend calls a twitch streamer his\nqueen i call you my queen all the time\noh well that's delightful\nbut something tells me that said\nboyfriend is not dating that twitch\nstreamer ah\nwhat do you think um\ni mean i think context matters a lot\nif i was\njust hilarious set up a twitch start\nstreaming see how he likes it when girls\nstart simping over you yeah\ni mean\nyeah it really it's the context really\nmatters it would it would really disturb\nme if you started calling\nother streamers your queen\nmainly because you don't talk like that\num are there any particular streamers\nthat it would disturb you more if i\nstarted calling them my queen\nyes\nlike who\num\ni mean i have nothing again like i\nreally enjoy the relationships we have\nin the creator community but if you were\nto\nlike start calling hot tub streamers\nyour queen i don't\nspecifically female hot tub streamers\nfor male 1 streamers okay\ni would actually expect you to call male\nhot tub streamers or queen that sounds\nlike something you would do\ns fan yeah\nyeah but practically i mean what do you\nthink what do you think this person\nshould do i mean so boyfriend is calling\na twitch streamer his queen\ni mean i think if she's worried about\nlike\nparasocial stuff or if she thinks that\num\nyou know he's like overly attached to\none particular\nstreamer i think they should talk about\nit\nbecause i mean if even if it is funny if\nand that's like a culture that she\ndoesn't understand i think it's a good\nway to bridge that\nkind of\ndivide\num and if there's actually a problem\nthere it's probably good to\nfigure it out early\nyeah i mean i i think so this is where\nyou know frankly krooti and i are a\nlittle bit dated when it comes to this\nstuff like i don't know exactly what it\nmeans if someone calls a twitch streamer\ntheir queen like\nyou know so i i think this is the kind\nof thing where it seems like these kinds\nof things are evolving right like\nsocietally\nso this is where i\ni think you all are going to get this\ntheme a lot today hopefully which is i\nthink communication is really important\nyeah so oftentimes you know when one\nperson says something they mean one\nthing and then like the other person\nkind of interprets it a different way\num and that's just because we all you\nknow have our own set of experiences\nbackground context that allows us to\ninterpret things\num and so i was just you know if you're\nconcerned about it like share that\nshare that concern with him\nso because this could be it could be\nlike a meme right like we just don't\nknow like whether it's like a parasocial\nrelationship whether that your your\nboyfriend is meaning like what does it\nactually mean and i think especially as\nlike relationships are evolving is\nterminology is evolving it's really\nimportant to try to get on the same page\nwith your partner about like what does\nthis stuff mean you know what how do you\nperceive this person\num\nyou know do you have some kind of\nfeeling like i don't know just have a\nconversation about it i think that the\nthing that um worries me a little bit\nabout this is like i don't think it's\nfunny at all and i think you have to\nhave a sense of humor about stuff like\nthis i don't think you can come in\nlike a tacky or that there's like only\none right way about it well i mean i'd\nkind of\nattack\nno i mean i i'd kind of disagree there\nbecause i think that it is okay to\nactually\nlike if you don't think something is\nfunny right like it's a that's okay\nlike let's say i'm dating someone and\nyou know they make a comment that is\nyeah but don't you think that's going to\nput him on the defense if you just come\nin hot and say like i don't think that's\nfunny at all\nyeah i mean i think it could put them on\nthe defensive but that's also where like\ni think that\navoiding putting your partner on the\ndefensive is not necessarily the\nstandard of communication ideally you\ndon't want to but like if they do\nsomething or say something that's out of\nline and you want to hold them\naccountable like\nsometimes you know because i think\nsometimes in communication we try overly\nhard to not hurt someone's feelings like\nyou so i'll see posts right people will\nsay like\nhow do i break up with someone without\nhurting their feelings and it's like i\ndon't i don't think that's what this is\nthough\nso i think the key thing here is that if\none person thinks it's funny and the\nother person doesn't think it's funny\nlike y'all should talk about it right\nwhat's what's humorous about it and what\nisn't\num help me understand the joke right so\ni think this is the other thing where if\nyou're in a situation where someone says\nsomething that's that you don't think is\nfunny and they say it's a joke\nyou can ask them to explain it to you\nright and like this is where oftentimes\nif people say things that are out of\nline leaning the joke will definitely\nnot be funny yeah it won't be funny but\nthis is where if there are like\nsubsurface toxic attitudes i think\nasking people to articulate why they\nthink it's funny is is a good way to\nkind of you know point out point that\nout to them but anyway\nso it sounds like i think this person\nshould have a conversation at the end of\nthe day like what does the term mean\nwhat do you think is funny what do you\nthink about that\ni think um\ni agree i would just say\ntry to avoid\nlike try to bridge it don't put him on\nthe defense about it i think you're\ngonna get a more genuine answer and more\ninsight that way\ncool cool next\nokay i'm gonna go\nclose the door real quick why don't you\neat this one love oh nice okay\nmy\nfemale 29 year old boyfriend 35 doesn't\nbelieve in marriage and it's causing me\nto try to lie to myself and convince\nmyself marriage is [ __ ] anyway\nbasically the title always pictured\nmyself getting married and it's always\nsomething i wanted in life i'm not\nreally sure why perhaps feeling like\nsomeone loves me enough to make me their\nwife or maybe the big celebration of a\nwedding anyway my current partner who\ni'm very in love with does not want to\nget married not to me not to anyone i'm\nactually his first girlfriend and we\nstarted dating about two years ago so he\nhas been wary of romantic relationships\nhis whole life it was a major personal\nstep for him to enter a relationship\nwith another person\nunfortunately i wasn't aware how he felt\nabout marriage until a year in the\nrelationship i remember him stating\nmarriage as something he would do\nwhile we were in the talking phase but\nhe claims he doesn't remember saying\nthis and doesn't know why he would say\nit\nwe almost broke up because of these\ndifferences but decided we still want to\nbe with each other i love him and want\nto be with him and it feels silly to\nleave this relationship to find someone\nnew just so i can experience being\nmarried i'm financially independent and\ni don't need marriage and i'm not\nreligious either but i feel like this is\ngoing to be hard to let go of i also\nfeel feel weird changing my beliefs for\nsomeone but then i ask myself why does\nit matter so much that we marry if we\nlove each other i just can't tell if\nmarriage really doesn't matter or mean\nanything or if i'm trying to lie to\nmyself to avoid the pain of a breakup\nside note there's no trust issues at\nplay here on my end at least\ni saw an interesting uh\nsomeone in chat was kind of mentioning\nso it seems like this this person had\nfound their first girlfriend at the age\nof 33.\nyeah 33 right\nand uh so don't give up hope chat\neveryone moves at their own pace right\nyep\nso what do you think about this this\nsituation\num\nyou know if this person was my friend\ni'd be pretty\nconcerned for her because i think\nit does\ni i think there are issues here i think\nthere is stuff that he is afraid of um\nit sounds like\nthey have come to some sort of harmony\naround\nwhat being together means\nbut i don't know what being married\nmeans to him and why being married\nis like mutually exclusive with being\ntogether\num\nsomething about that doesn't sit well\nwith me what doesn't sit well with you\nwell because you know they're not like\n21 23\nwhere like you know\nher boyfriend is 35 i think\nhe probably has friends that have been\nmarried like i don't think this is like\na naive kind of\ndecision i'm never gonna get married i\nthink this is like a real stance yeah so\ni'm i'm kind of hearing that based on\ntheir ages you're sort of thinking like\nso early on like if i'm 23 and i don't\nwant to get married like i still have\nstuff to sort out right like\nyeah and you can kind of change your\nmind about that yeah so yeah people are\nstill like exploring stuff isn't really\nset in stone but by the time you get to\nlike 35 like you should sort of\nhave it figured out\nkind of well this this seems like a\nstrong belief about\nhis life that isn't going to change\nyeah i think this once again is where um\nit seems like marriage means\ndifferent stuff to the two people\nand so i think like any conversation\nabout getting married is\nyou know you have to talk about what it\nmeans to each of you to get married\nwhat does it mean for you\num\nwell\nlet me just think about that\ni don't know\ni don't know that it meant\ni just it just felt right it felt like\nwhat our relationship was like the\ndirection that it was going like you\nknow when you have like a puzzle piece\nyou've got like a puzzle and there's\njust one piece left\nand then like you stick it in and it's\nlike\nit's like complete and it's done and\nit's finished\nand it's like oh yeah like that's like\nthat's what is supposed to happen\nthere's like there's like this sense\nthat that's just what's supposed to\nhappen\nyou know like that's just what we're\nsupposed to do is we're supposed to get\nmarried like and not like supposed to\nand some it just felt right to get\nmarried i mean i think we talked about\nthat right because we were dating for\nyears\nbefore we got married it's like okay\nlike now it's time it feels like it's\ntime\nand i don't know that we ever\nyeah i don't know it just felt right\nyeah i mean we never had that\nconversation around like what marriage\nmeans\nto you\nno but i mean here we are\nwe talked about it right so we talked\nabout so there's so kruthie and i were\nboth raised in the hindu tradition and\nthere's this there's this like ritual\nthat you go through which sort of binds\nyou together for seven lifetimes yep\nand so when you get married you like\nwalk around the fire a certain number of\ntimes and you know pyrotechnics because\nnothing makes a wedding like\npyrotechnics nothing um\nand so\nwe you know so i i sometimes wonder\nabout things like that like so i don't\nknow if you know we're we're being\nshackled together for seven years and i\nalso wonder about the escalation right\nso if you get married in this year in\nthis lifetime and you're supposed to be\nthat binds you together for seven\nlifetimes but then like what happens if\nyou get married on second lifetime right\nnow he's just now it's like seven plus\nseven yeah like are you stacking them up\nwe are\nand and so\nyou know i suppose that's very romantic\nthat we've but you know i don't know how\nwas this the last one have we renewed\nour contract like if we renewed the\nlease for seven more years we have or\nare we just re-renewing and stacking on\ni don't know who knows it's unclear\nbut it just felt right\nyeah i mean i i certainly wasn't gonna\nmarry anyone else\ndamn straight\n[Laughter]\num\nanyway kind of going back to this i mean\ni think that this is where like so\nso kruthy is kind of saying you know if\nthis person was 23 it would be a little\nbit different whereas like i you know\ni'd encourage you to almost think about\nthis person as being early in the phase\nof relationship experience right yeah so\nthis person the the woman in the\nrelationship was saying like\nyou're his first girlfriend so like you\nknow he may not be ready for marriage\neven though the person started dating at\n33 and you should sort of have your life\nfigured out maybe theoretically by 35 i\nthink i'm still figuring it out\num\nthis is the kind of thing where like you\nknow so your boyfriend may have not\nthought about it too much right so i\nthink a conversation about what marriage\nmeans to you what it means to him\nwhy it's important to you why he's so\nagainst it and this is also where like\ncompromise is also important like there\nare things in a relationship that even\nif you don't want something a particular\nway and they wanted us a certain way or\nlike vice versa right sometimes i think\nit's okay to make or it's important to\nmake sacrifices for the sake of your\nrelationship i think nowadays i see an\nincreasing trend on the internet which\nis like you're allowed to want whatever\nyou want which i totally agree with but\nthen also like if people are not willing\nto accept you for who you are\nthen\nyou know like you should so people\nshould just accept you at face value and\nlike not ask you to change at all but i\nthink in terms of you know relationships\nespecially long-term relationships\nchange and compromise is a big part of\nit right because a year later you're not\ngoing to be the same person you're going\nto be a different person\nthat's what i'd say have a conversation\nabout it and figure out what what about\nmarriage\nor is your boyfriend reluctant about\nlike what's his hesitation what does it\nmean to him why doesn't he want to do it\nand similarly share your perspective\nabout why it's important to you even if\nit\nyou know we're sort of hearing that\nfinancial reasons don't really matter\nit's not like really a religious thing\nit's just you're allowed to grow up in\nin a particular\nenvironment and just want to be married\nright like you're allowed to want that\nand and have it be a valuable part of\nyour life and one of your goals it's\ntotally fine\nyeah\nbut\ni feel like the most practical thing\nthey can do is\ndefine what it means to be together\ndefine what it means to be married and\ntry to look for\ndiscrepancies so like you should do it\nyour boyfriend should do it\nand you all should like exchange and\ntalk about it that might be the most\nlike\nor i don't know about the most but i i\nfeel like that would be a good exercise\nto go through\nto like get an\nactual like a non-defensive conversation\ngoing\nokay next up\nshould i wish her a happy valentine's\nday i started seeing this girl recently\nwe're not dating\nbut we went on a date last week and are\ngoing on our second this week we text\njust about every day would it be a\nlittle much to wish her a happy\nvalentine's day i mean it's not like\nchristmas or easter i just don't go\naround wishing everyone a happy\nvalentine's day but i also want to\nreinforce that i'm not looking for a\nfriendship with her not sure any advice\nthis is so cute\nwhat do you think\nso you've been on so the scenario is\nyou've been on one date\nyou know you're not like technically\ndating\nand it sounds like you've got a second\ndate this week\nyou text every day wish or happy\nvalentine's day yay nay\ni think so just i mean yeah\nhelp me understand your reasoning\ni mean he wants to\nit sounds like he wants to if he didn't\nwant to then\nhe wouldn't be writing this post\ni think but if he wants to i i\ni think generally\nwhen it comes to communication letting\nyour guard down a little bit is a good\nthing\nso\ni i don't know if it should be happy\nvalentine's day\nand that's it\ni think maybe some\npersonality around it would be nice but\nlike what\ni don't know let me let me let me think\nfor a second yeah\nwhat do you think he should do so i was\nactually thinking that you should just\ntext happy valentine's day right because\nhere you are\nthinking about like oh my god what does\nit mean if i send it or if i don't send\nit like is it gonna be coming on too\nstrong or coming on to\ni would say just send happy val if you\nfeel like wishing you're a happy\nvalentine's you can say hey happy\nvalentine's day hope you're okay but you\nare\ncolossally bad at texting\nyou are like you\nare well hold on hold on hold on i'm not\ndone yet i think you may discover why\nwhy you're such a bad tester because\nthen here's the thing right so here you\nare in your head anxious about should i\nsend it or not getting my money's worth\nthis stream and and this is where once\nyou send it then the ball's in her court\nright but then she has to figure out\nwhat does it mean is it too much am i\ntoo into it is he too into me like is\nthis too much is this too little how\nshould i respond\nright\nyeah so just get it out of your head and\nif you want to say happy valentine's day\nand if you want to you can even add a\nlittle bit hey i know we've only been on\none date but valentine's day is here and\ni hope you're having a good day happy\nvalentine's day\nyou can also acknowledge that y'all have\nonly been on one date if you really want\nto\nbut or you could be a little bit\nambiguous maybe this is why i'm a bad\ntexter and then let her sort of sort out\nwhat it means right are you coming on\ntoo strong\ny'all with me\nthese are all it's text where are you\nget me chai\nokay\ncan you come here\ndone\nlike\nyou were a bad texter well these are\ntexts that i'm sending you when we're\nlike in the same house\ni'm texting you from a different room\nright so done is like when our kids are\nasleep i'm letting you know that it is\nsafe to come into the bedroom lest you\nwake them up okay\ni think you should\ntext\nhappy valentine's day with like a couple\nof emojis or something i don't know just\ni don't know\nbut i think you should go for it\ni don't think you should not text her\ni'm doing it now\nyou're texting me happy valentine's day\nthe emojis\noh nice love you with emojis i don't\nthink i've ever gotten an emoji done\ntexting leveled up chat\nright now i'm gonna text you back\ndone\nokay\nsee i\nhow is that was that a better text\nlearning communication\nso good\nlearning learning right you got to level\nup\nthere were there were double heart\nemojis actually it's easier i think i\nmay just use the google suggested emojis\nthere you go it's great let autocorrect\nfinish your text\nbut at the end of the day i mean i'm i'm\na big fan of you know being authentic\nwith people like you want to respect\ntheir boundaries right so like once\nyou're authentic\nif they express to you some concern\ndon't like keep hammering them\nyeah right\nso like if you text happy valentine's\nday and they don't respond\ndon't be like aren't you gonna text me\nback like what\nso i think it's okay to acknowledge a\nlittle bit right where you can say hey i\nknow we've been on one date now we're in\nthe awkward position of like do we text\neach other happy valentine's day well i\njust hope you're having a good day happy\nvalentine's day\nyou're frowning is this a mistake\nno i i agree that you should not badger\nher for not responding i'm realizing\nthat i badger you for responding okay\nthen\nwell i think a little bit of badgering\nis okay okay\nokay\nbattering is fun veteran is fun yeah\ni mean i think that's just like you know\nyeah i don't\nneed a whole lot of emotional support\nthrough text and and maybe you do which\nis totally fine\ni don't think that's what's happening\nokay whatever banned\nchat all right\nmaybe we should keep track of dr k's\nperformance here today do you guys think\ni'm in the hole or out of the hole like\nlet's say here's the hole like are we\nin or out no\ncan you please rephrase this\nlike digging yourself away no yeah\nuh-huh okay no i know i know okay so we\njust dug ourselves into the hole a\nlittle bit\nmore y'all let me know okay let's just\nlet's go on don't clip it chat just move\non next question\nnext question go is it normal to develop\na crush on almost every single girl you\ntalk to i legitimately start to develop\na crush on every single girl that i talk\nto because i was home schooled for my\nentire life until college is this normal\noh\nwe were thinking about homeschooling and\nnow i'm swayed\nwhat do you think\ni mean\nnormal is um\ni think you know your your life\nexperience is not typical right most\npeople are not homeschooled so\ni think he should forget about whether\nor not it's normal and more like\nif it's debilitating for him to be able\nto approach a girl or to like\nhave normal relationships um\nyeah because i mean he\ni think you can safely say he's not\nnormal in that kind of sense\nbecause he was homeschooled\nlike his social\nskills are going to be a little atypical\nokay\nthat sounds kind of brutal\ni mean i think i just hate the word\nnormal you want me to take a stab at it\nyeah you can okay i just don't like the\nword normal i guess is what i'm trying\nto say\nso here's okay here's my take on this\nokay so if you're 19 years old you're\nhomeschooled you go to college and you\nhaven't really like interacted with a\nwhole lot of people that you're sexually\nattracted to\nwhether it's men women whatever\ni think oddly enough it is actually\ncompletely normal to have this kind of\nreaction and the good news is that i\nwould guess that it won't continue\nforever so you're not like doomed to\nbeing attracted or crushing on every\nsingle girl that you meet for the rest\nof your life so let's just think about\nlike what's going on here okay so\nnormally\nwe tend to go through puberty around\nlike we start puberty around 12 13. and\nso puberty is like a process right so\nthere's like a large hormonal change\nthere are all kinds of like physiologic\nchanges psychological changes\nneuroscience changes that go on in\npuberty and generally speaking let's\njust talk about hormones right so this\nisn't scientifically going to be\ntechnically correct not medical advice\nby the way um yeah but just like let's\njust think about so like we have\nhormonal fluctuations throughout puberty\nright so we're not\nyou know the process of being a raging\nhormonal teenager doesn't happen\novernight and generally speaking we we\nhave all these kinds of interesting\nparts of our brain that develop like so\nwe become sexually like more\nattracted to things people\num you know we become\nmore lustful right\nuh there's like boosts to testosterone\nand and progesterone estrogen all these\nkinds of hormones\nand so that's a gradual process so if\nyou think a little bit about like what\nhigh school is like for the average\nteenager\nmaybe famous last words here but you're\nnot like constantly horny but there's\nlike your your body's like growing right\nso your body's developing and adapting\nand that development and adaptation is\nhappening with like regular interaction\nwith um\npeople that you're sexually attracted to\nso your body is sort of figuring out\nokay now we're becoming like more\nsexually mature we're becoming more um\nand as a result we're like starting to\ndevelop feelings for people so even if\nyou think about the concept of a crush\nlike what is a crush right it's like a\nstrangely physiologic\nnon-psychological like nuanced thing\nright you meet someone and then you\nstart crushing on them and it's like\nyour body is like thinking about them\nall the time and then like you don't\nreally know what's going on right so i\nthink it's it's kind of in a sense even\nnormal because throughout teenage years\nif we're exposed to people that we're\nattracted to we learn how to like\nmoderate those feelings we learn how to\nkind of calm down our body also kind of\nfigures out oh hey like okay we're doing\nthis thing again and then your crush\nkind of disappears after a little while\nright because it's like it's sort of a\nvery hormonal physiologic sort of thing\nand so if you've missed that window of\nlet's say 13 to 19 of like crushing on\npeople gradually right so you get your\nfirst question when you're 13 you're\nlike what the hell is going on and then\nlike it kind of goes away as your\nhormones are adapting and changing you\nget your next crush when you're 14\nyou're like what the hell is going on\nand by the time you get to like 15 16\nremember your your sexual maturation is\ncontinuing to increase right\nso like the psychological ability to\ndeal with crushes is sort of growing as\nyour sexual maturity is increasing if\nyou've been homeschooled suddenly you're\na fully developed sexually mature 19\nyear old and then you're getting exposed\nto like like\ncrushing stimuli for the first time\nand as you get exposed to that stuff\nlike you your body just hasn't learned\nhow to handle it yet so i think it's\nit's not actually that unusual like i\nwouldn't be surprised that this person\nis in the six\nis in this situation i also would not be\nworried about it so you can always seek\nprofessional help if you want to and\nyou're worried right that's always a\ngood idea\nbut at the end of the day you know i\nthink it sort of makes sense that if you\nthink about the process of sexual\nmaturation and kind of like interaction\nwith people that you're attracted to\nthat creates a lot of like\nslowly building crushes that you kind of\nmanage and stuff and this is what's\ngoing on now is that you've been sort of\nhomeschooled for you know six years\nseven years during that process and now\nyou're sort of getting like\nyour your mind your physiology is\ngetting exposed to these kinds of\nstimuli so it can be really overwhelming\nso i would say don't worry too much\nabout it i'm just mentally trying to\npolice my usage of the word exposed\nduring this entire thing but\num you know i think it's like it can be\nnormal because normally that process is\nstretched out over like six years let's\nsay and so if that process that six year\nprocess is being compressed to one year\nit's gonna feel particularly\noverwhelming\nand over time i think you'll you'll\nlearn because that's what the body does\nlike the body catches up\nright\nyep\ni\ni think this person is going to be just\nfine and it'll kind of pass\nbut the good thing is that it's like\nevery single girl and it's not an\nobsessive thing for like a few girls so\nfriendly little crushes are fine\nokay next up\nyour turn\nshould i ask for my ring back my\ngirlfriend recently dumped me completely\nout of the blue to be with somebody else\nand told me that was the reason why\nwait\ncan recently dump me completely out of\nbloom to be with someone else tell me\nthat was okay because okay so the person\ngot dumped because she has a girlfriend\nshe wore the expensive ring i bought her\nfor christmas that she had been wanting\nto\nbreak the news to me\nshe had been talking to this person\nbehind my back while we dated and set it\nup so she could leave me to go be with\nthem am i an [ __ ] if i ask for the\nring back\num i'm in a financially tight situation\ni don't even know why she want to keep\nit if it\nif\nif i was that meaningless to her what do\nyou think\ni mean it's not an engagement ring\ni\ni think if he wants it back he can ask\nfor it back i wouldn't\ni wouldn't get vicious if she says no\nbut\ni bought her for christmas so\n[Music]\nhe just bought it for her\nlike a couple months ago\nand she's wearing it to break up i don't\nknow i don't i just\ni guess i don't like this girl\nso if he wants his ring back that's fine\nyeah so i i mean i'm inclined to agree\nso i think like if you got a piece of\njewelry especially during a part where\nthe relationship was not like\nemotionally\num\nhonest for lack of a better term right\nright so you sort of there was something\ngoing on with your partner that was you\nwere not aware of where she wasn't\nemotionally invested in the relationship\nand so the gift was given under the\npremise of being in an emotionally\ninvested relationship\nso i think it's completely reasonable to\nask for it back and say like hey you\nknow i'd really appreciate it the\nlanguage i would use is hey um\nyou know in light of like what you've\ntold me about\nlike you've been talking to this person\nfor a while and maybe have been like\nemotionally\nkind of like\nleaving this relationship for some time\ni think it's i'd really like my ring\nback and in light of what you've told me\nrecently like i i don't really think if\ni had known if you had been honest with\nme i would have ever given it to you\num if i knew how you felt which i'm\ntotally you know it's fine that you felt\nthat way i just wish i would have known\nand i kind of feel like the gift was\ngiven under\n[Music]\ninappropriate pretenses\nthe other thing to remember is that i\nthink it's okay to ask for it back by\nall means but also respect her boundary\nright because at the end of the day\nlike it's a gift so it's hers now and\neven if it was\nyou didn't really understand what was\ngoing on like that's the kind of thing\nwhere like you know if she decides to\nkeep it she decides to keep it if you if\nyou get it back please god just return\nit don't dwell on it\nwhy\nlike i don't know i don't\ni feel like sometimes people get their\nthings back from a relationship and then\nthey like have the box of the\nrelationship and then they dwell on the\nrelationship and\ni wouldn't want to be to become an\nobject of dwelling i guess by the way\nandy's in chat andy um milonakis hey\nandy hey hope you're doing well man\nwe'll we'll find out maybe we should ask\nandy what he thinks about yeah what do\nyou think andy ring or no ring\num\nother things i'd be super curious what\nandy thinks about tether and things like\nthat right because he's a he's a crypto\nchad\nbut\nyou know who who here on on twitch talks\nabout crypto are they like crypto\nexperts\nstock guy\nyeah i think a couple of people\num\ntalk about crypto but andy's saying he\ntalks about nfts more than crypto\nandy talks about nhl\nbut andy's saying he's an nft person\nokay\nwow\nyeah\nsomething i understand even less than\ncrypto\ni asked our accounting people what to do\nabout crypto and they're like really\nscared about it\nbecause\nyou can have\nthere was a post on our subreddit for\nsomebody who wanted to donate in\nethereum\nand the problem with that is it can be\nan asset that like\nappreciates wildly and then you're\nliable for taxes on that asset\nand then if it tanks then\nanyway it's a whole complicated thing\nokay yeah i'm his wife\nall right shall we keep going yeah\nso ask for the ring back right chat do\nyou all agree\nask for the ring push\nturn it if you get it\ni don't know about return but it sounds\nit sounds wise i mean he's asking it for\nit back because he's in a financially\ntough situation what's gonna do with the\nring give it to somebody else give it to\nsomeone who [ __ ] deserves it\nlike you\nyou know what i'm saying like if the\nring was bought as a symbol of love and\naffection\ngive you know\nhonor the purpose of the ring but i i'm\nwith you i'm not saying you were to ever\nrecycle jewelry on me i don't i don't\nknow what i would do with that\nif i were to ever\nokay stop\nstop\nwe've been together too long yeah\nyeah\nokay\ncan we do a shorter one\nno no we i'll read this one okay this\none's this sound looks good dude okay\ngirl i was talking to sent me this help\nme decode this message this is great\nyeah it's a sleuthing\nso i've been talking to this girl from\ntinder for about two weeks now we've\nhung out a good portion of the two weeks\nlike gone drinking playing pool movies\ncuddle at her place she even went to\ndisneyland this past weekend and got me\na hat from there out of the blue\nyesterday we were supposed to go\ngo-karting for valentine's and dinner\nright after she sends me this message\nabout six hours before we're supposed to\ngo on our date from her hey sorry i\ni haven't been super talkative this last\nday and today i just took\nmy me day and have been thinking about\nwhat i want and everything and i don't\nthink i'm ready for a committed\nrelationship i still have a lot of stuff\nto work through obviously and don't want\nto drag someone through that all in all\ni just really don't want to hurt you by\nleading you on or you thinking i'm using\nyou etc anyways here's me over\ncommunicating again i just want you to\nknow because i respect you and don't\nwant my intentions to be unclear\nthat being said when i said yes to being\nyour valentine i meant it so if you\nstill want to go out as friends we\ndefinitely can but i'd completely\nunderstand if you weren't comfortable\nwith it i care about your feelings so i\njust want you to be comfortable\ni also want to make it very clear that\nit isn't you i cut off all dating with\neveryone so please don't internalize\ninternalize it and think and\nand think i think lowly of you or\nanything like that end\nso we've been very open about our\nshortcomings and the most we've ever\ndone is just kiss not even make out i'm\njust now recently\ngetting in the dating scene and i just\nwant to know if this text message is\nactually\nuh i screwed up the situation or not\nwhat do you think\ni think she should have just said happy\nvalentine's day\nironically\num\ni'm kidding\ni\ni don't know i\ni feel like this is um\nnot a well-edited text\num but also\nyeah this is not this is not my texts\nare very well added and edited down to\none word so edited\num i think okay so his question is\nreally\nsorry this thing is like in my face i\ncan't see um\ni knew this was going to be a problem\nfrom the beginning use your stuff you\nstepped into that\nin the hole let's just say\nand i just want to know if this text\nmessage is actually a [ __ ] up\nsituation yeah i think i think it's a\nbit of a messy situation\nthat's my short answer yeah i mean\nyou're supposed to help the dude decode\nthe message okay let's decode it um\nshe's not ready for a relationship i\nthink she probably um over thinks she's\nlike an overthinking thing\num\ni think she's trying to be really clear\nthat like you know it's me not you\nwhat is she saying though i don't know\nokay here's what i think she's saying i\nthink she's saying she doesn't want the\nrelationship there you go she doesn't i\nmean she she wants to be friends but she\ndoesn't want to be as valentine so\nshe'll hang out with him no she says she\nis his\nvalentine but i think that's like kind\nof like a\nconsolation prize no no i mean i think\nit's sort of like you know when you're\nin school and you're like\nin the third grade\nand you like pass out valentine's it's\nlike will you be my valentine like i i\nthink this is where there's confusion\nover what it means to be a valentine\nonce again valentine's day you've been\ngoing on dates for what it sounds like\ntwo weeks right\nand so\nup looms valentine's day which suddenly\nadds an artificial amount of pressure of\nof\nseriousness to a relationship yeah\nit's like like the three stages of\nrelationship are\ndating\nvalentine's day valentine will you be my\nvalentine engaged in marriage\nright\nso i i think what i would really\ninterpret from this is that\nthis girl enjoys your company but she\nsees this relationship as platonic\nand that's where like it can be painful\nbut on the on the one hand like i think\nit's really actually mature of her to\nsend this right so she's not she wants\nto make it clear that while y'all are\nkind of like having fun and i'm also\ngetting lots of mixed signals here\nbecause there is cuddles and y'all are\nkissing and she's getting you gifts and\nstuff so i think this is the kind of\nthing where there's mixed signals so\nit's kind of ambiguous\nand so what she's doing is she's now\ndrawing a firm line and she says hey\nthis is like where my line is like i'm\nnot interested in a relationship i'm not\nlooking for i'm not looking to date um\ni said yes to being your valentine i\nthought that that meant something\nromantic but\nit also seems like she's saying\ni don't want my intentions to be unclear\nif you want to go out tonight as friends\nwe definitely can\num i care about your feelings which i\nagree with it does sound like she cares\nabout his feelings right so she's sort\nof saying hey\ni wasn't sure exactly how i felt but\nthat's the other thing to remember right\nis like when you start talking to\nsomeone\nthey may not have everything internally\nfigured out like we're not like you know\n100 mapped about what we want i see a\nlot of questions in chat like well then\nwhy did she kiss him why i feel like she\nis um\nshe's\ntrying to give consolation prizes like\ni'll kiss you i'm not gonna make out\nwith you i'll go\nbe your valentine as a friend but i'm\nnot gonna have a relationship with you\nand she's trying to say that she doesn't\nwant to lead him on\nand i think\nshe is\nshe's not doing a great job of that but\ni i can totally empathize with this like\nnot wanting to hurt his feelings so do\nmaybe a little bit more than she wants\nto out of a sense of preserving his\nfeelings but that's just making it worse\nyeah i mean i think this is the kind of\nthing where like people are asking why\ndid she kiss him well i think like i was\nsaying because people aren't monolithic\nright yeah so if you think about it she\nalso gets to kiss him and then make up\nher mind that oh didn't like that don't\nwant to do that again sure right that's\nwhy we progress it kind of reminds me so\nwhen my i was explaining to my mom many\nyears ago that ruthie and i were dating\noh yeah yeah yeah you've heard of the\nstory don't okay don't be shocked it's\nokay all right\nand so she was like dating like what\ndoes that mean does that mean you're\ngonna get married\nand i was like\nno not necessarily i mean we may she's\nlike i'm confused like what's the point\nof dating if you're not gonna get\nmarried\nand so like you know remember that in a\nrelationship just because you take one\nstep forward doesn't mean that you're\nyou know going the whole marathon\nright and like people are allowed to\nsort of figure things out change their\nmind stuff like that\num i do think also remember that if\nyou're let's say i say oh i want to like\nstart eating healthier and then it's\nlike i'm gonna have a salad for lunch\nand then like pizza for dinner and\npeople like well why did you have the\nsalad\nor why did you have the pizza if you\nwere gonna eat healthier and like you're\nsending like me mixed signals about are\nyou getting healthy you're not getting\nhealthy it's because we're not\nmonolithic\nright so she may have wanted to try it\nshe may have she may have mixed feelings\nand if we kind of think about it like if\nwe actually pay attention to what she\nsaid um\nyou know i cut off all dating with\neveryone so she may still have some\ndegree of romantic feelings\nbut internally has realized that like\nshe needs to work on herself first\nbefore she is ready for a relationship\nwhich i think is actually a pretty\nmature perspective\nnow for people sort of saying you know\nis he is she leading him on like there\nmay have been some degree of that over\nthe course of the last two weeks right\nbecause there are mixed signals but i\nthink actually this this text is\nactually very clearly saying like i'm\nnot trying to lead you on i'm not\ninterested in a relationship here's my\nline and then you can sort of decide\nwhether you want to engage with that or\nnot\nlast thing that i'd say is that you know\nif you're into someone if you have\nromantic feelings for someone um and\nthey send you a message like this i'd be\nreally really careful about\ncontinuing to engage with the person\nbecause it's hard to move from romance\nto like friendship\nnot saying it's impossible i suppose a\nlot of people do it\nbut then like what sort of happens is\nyou kind of like if if you have romantic\nintentions in the relationship and she\nhas platonic intentions in the\nrelationship like i think that's going\nto end up\nprobably bad\nbut there are you know i've heard\nstories of you know people who sort of\ndon't give up and they realize that\nthey're in love and like any rom-com\nyou know where things start out platonic\nand then you realize or episode of south\npark which i was watching recently which\nis hilarious\nthis is an episode of south park okay\ni didn't know you still watched that\npart i recently started again okay\num\nso i'd say you know if you have romantic\nfeelings towards this person i'd hold on\nwe had people over for the super bowl\nand then you went off and watched south\npark no i didn't watch that park\nyesterday okay\ni watched it i was like oh that's where\nyou went\ndude i don't know about y'all so can\nlike i cannot can y'all watch after\nwatching esports i can't watch like real\nsports anymore\nlike the super bowl\nthe super bowl is is literally 60\nminutes of actual competition right it's\nfour quarters at\n15 minutes apiece\nand the thing lasts for four hours\nthere's like so many damn commercials so\nmany damn pauses like\ni just can't do it anymore\nlike i it blows it kind of feels like\nyou know back when we before we had like\non-demand streaming services yeah yeah\nand like now if you go back and you\nwatch like tv it's atrocious\nam i the only one no you're not okay\nbecause i like football i think it's fun\nlike going to a game i think is a little\nbit different because there's a bunch of\nlike social interaction and stuff like\nthat going right but and you can just\nwatch dota at the game\nyeah i haven't gone that far but boy\nthat sounds fantastic\nthat's totally what you would do\nall right okay\ndecoded decoded moving on\n[Music]\npeople are asking if i'm drinking from a\npitcher i am drinking from a pitcher\ni'm out of cups\noh\nyou are it's just water though it's not\nlike i thought you meant like\nmetaphorically\num okay kind of terrified of making a\nmove hey guys so straight to the you\nwant to read this one\nsure\nhey guys so straight to the point i am\nan almost 29 year old man who has never\ndated anyone nor been in a relationship\nreasons include never having had mutual\nattraction with anyone\nalways been one-sided either on my part\nor the other person's part me being\nunattractive\nit's an attractive very short dude which\nessentially means unattractive\noh i don't agree with that and having\nbeen single for so long that i honestly\ncan't even see myself in a relationship\ni don't know what it is like being in a\nrelationship so the thought of being in\none is very foreign and a bit scary tbh\nwe fear the unknown this is how i\nexplain it to myself so now for the\nsituation i met someone at work\nknown her for only a single day who\ncomes across as a genuinely nice person\nwho is also very attractive i would\nnormally not even hesitate to write her\noff because she is too attractive and i\nam inadequate but i've been regretting\nnot possibly having made a move so many\ntimes now that i'm willing to go against\nmy fears and give it a shot\ni have often times read that going for\nco-workers is a very bad idea which i\nabsolutely agree with\nbut the lady seems to be worth the risk\nthat i'm considering it\nso i am asking for advice should i go\nfor it has anyone here been in a similar\nsituation and if yes how did you proceed\nand just overall share your opinion in\ngeneral\noh my goodness\nwhat do you think\ni always say go for it i always say give\nit a shot i think\ni think so much of this is in his head\nfor like how attractive or inadequate or\nwhatever he is\nbut if he finds her attractive and\nsounds like she's engaging with him\ni don't\nit'd be nice to throw up like a little\ntest balloon without being like look i\nfind you attractive i'm\ntoo short or whatever like i don't\ni think just a test balloon would be\nnice\nso like test balloon means flirting\noh like\nget a coffee or something i don't well\nlike i don't know what the work\nsituation is here\ndid it say\nno just at work he's he's he's known her\nlet's\nknown her first single day oh oh\ni met someone at work okay yeah he's\nvery attractive mm-hmm\nyeah foster the relationship a little\nso\nyeah i i so generally speaking i'm for\ngoing for it\nright so i think that just go for it\num after a single day\nwhat does it mean i said generally\nspeaking we're gonna get to this in a\nsecond all right so generally speaking\nlike in terms of of like you know if you\nwant to wish her a happy valentine's day\njust like if that's what you're feeling\nauthentically just do it right and like\ngo go for it and respect the other\nperson's boundaries that's my general\nphilosophy for like how to approach\nthese kinds of situations\nwhat but\nbut what it works for you\nno no i i hear a butt coming\nso that that's you know respect people's\nboundaries but like be authentic right\nso just be like honest and if you feel a\nparticular way let them know\nthat being said especially so here's\nwhat i think is going on the first thing\nis that don't [ __ ] where you eat right\nso like don't\ndon't start relationships in places that\nfreeze so much\nwhat should i say what do you have an\nalternative i just\nno go ahead okay\nso i'd say like it work like it's kind\nof weird right so if you ask this person\nout on a date like and they say no you\nyou're gonna have to continue\ninteracting with them like i think\nthere's like workplace boundaries right\nso we have boundaries around the\nworkplace\nand so respect boundaries be authentic\nbut respect boundaries\nthe other thing is that i get the sense\nthat this person\nis trying to like\nprove\nor grow in a particular way to like\nthey're trying to level up\ntheir fear\ndoes that make sense\nlike they're sort of trying to level it\nlike so they're kind of saying like okay\nso\ni've been afraid to to ask people out so\nin order to level up like i'm gonna find\nan attractive person i'm not going to be\nintimidated by them and i'm going to ask\nthem out\nso that makes sense like i think it's a\ngood way to kind of approach things like\napproach life stuff like that is like if\nyou have an internal sense of inadequacy\nand your internal sense of inadequacy\nhas helped has kept you back from\naccomplishing certain things or taking\ncertain risks you should absolutely try\nto level up that skill but i'd be super\ncareful about doing it first of all at\nwork right where there could be other\nkinds of consequences\nyou could make her feel uncomfortable it\ncould hr stuff like whatever it could\nmake you feel really uncomfortable like\nyou just don't know exactly like what's\ngonna happen there because they're\ncomplicating factors right\nthe other thing is that\nyou know\nlike this sentence really bothers me\nbut the lady seems to be worth the risk\nthat's just like what what i'm sort of\ngetting there is that\nthere's a normal calculus\nbut something about this situation is\ncausing you to like rethink the calculus\nright you don't want to like\nif you have an equation of appropriate\nbehavior it's like let's say i'm not\ngoing to steal but then there's like\nthere's like a million dollars and it's\nlike well if there's a million dollars\nlike maybe it's okay to steal so like\nfigure out what your you know what your\nstandard is in life and then kind of\nlike stick to it and be careful about\nmaking exceptions because i don't know\nwhat part of your body you're thinking\nwith at that point so i'd say be a\nlittle bit careful about you know trying\nto level up in a work situation\nand you know if someone is worth the\nrisk like that just something about that\ndoesn't\nsit right with me\nthe single day\nis kind of what's\ni mean i'm excited for him that he's\nfinally excited and thinks that there\ncould be there after\nyou know not having any mutual\nattraction with anyone\nyeah i mean i i'd say\nyou know if you do if you do want to\npursue things in some way i'd i think\nruthie's like right in terms of like\ntest the waters right so try to have a\nconversation first like\nyou know this is where also i wouldn't\nrecommend that you flirt at work but\nlike being a little bit flirtatious is\nthe way that you test the waters right\nthat's what flirting is\nit's like testing whatever clearing is\nwell what would you call it i don't know\ni don't flirt at work\none day we are gonna have to do\nsome kind of stream or share what it's\nlike to actually be married and work\ntogether yeah maybe\num\nso that that's interesting though\nbecause we you know we were in a\nrelationship before we started working\ntogether which i think is like actually\nbetter\nright than the other way around but i\ndon't know maybe we've done a couple of\nworking relationships too\nlike relationships where we\nare working on something together it's\nlike always intense stuff yeah yeah well\nokay well i mean\ni feel like camp was sort of a\ndating service\nokay\nextracurriculars clubs i don't know\nanyway\nso i would say kind of if you're kind of\nterrified of making a move like i would\nnot recommend making a move\nin this situation don't do some big\ngesture gentle gentle proceed gently\nwith caution\nyeah\nchat wants me to teach them how to flirt\nokay what do you think go ahead\nyou want me to flirt with you right now\nthat's not what i want it's what chat\nwants well what do you want i want you\nto flirt with me right now i can tell\nthat's how you do it easy done\ntoo easy\nsee\nwork real quick i'm busy i'm busy and\nbusy\nyou like me\ntoo\ni do because\ni don't i don't invite flirtatious\nattention because i'm a married lady\nwell i mean i i'm super lucky that you\ndon't invite flirtatious attention\nbecause if you did you'd get like so\nmuch of it yeah that's why puerto rico's\nfun\ni can imagine\nright\nso i think that's that's a good example\nyou get a lot of flirtatious attention\nfriends\nyou've always gotten flirtatious\nattention i don't think so oh my god\nthose nurses\ni mean\nthat's\nso hospitals are just a whole different\nsituation she doesn't count in hospitals\nis that what i'm hearing\nno no i\ni i also am very very careful about you\nknow\nthe kinds of\nyou know i started you know wearing the\nring recently\nbecause i was getting\nyeah you were you were really getting\nquite a lot so we just have to be\ncareful there right so we want to set\nboundaries and the ring is one way that\nyou indicate a boundary to other people\nso but in terms of flirting i i don't\nknow like what did you like because it\nwas pretty easy right because i was like\noh do you want me to flirt with you\nyou're like no i won't rotate it it's\nlike\nlook it's the look it's the set of the\nchin\nyeah and the eyebrow eyebrows yeah\naccent what about the flaring of the\nnose accent is really just not a good\nway to go friend\nyeah so i think you know in terms of\nflirting like try to make her laugh like\ntrue you know make her feel special\nyeah and\nyeah i i don't know i mean you all saw\nwhat happened there right so how would\nyou how would you just yeah just\nso this is the kind of thing where like\nwhatever whatever they\nsend your way like play with it don't\nargue with them right so if she's like\noh chat wants me i don't even remember\nwhat i said it just felt pretty easy it\nwas easy yeah you're easy um\nit's true yeah\nright so that's the kind of thing where\nyou could have responded with oh no\nyou're easy but that's a little bit\naggressive it's like yeah you're right\nyeah\nand then she laughs so you got to be\ncareful because like in there you can\nsay oh you're easy but you don't want to\nsay that like you're like yeah i'm easy\ntake advantage of me please\nyou know that's that's the attitude you\ndon't say that no it's okay it's easy\nit's good it's good you see what i'm\nsaying yeah you see what i'm saying like\nyou just like you don't want to say take\nadvantage of me because that's a little\nbit forward right like it's like\nheavy-handed maybe a little bit creepy\nit's like oh take advantage of me baby\nlike that's you know what i mean that's\ntoo much\nso the attitude it's about facial\nexpressions non-verbal communication\num like you don't you want to sort of\nsay like yeah i am easy like what are\nyou gonna do about it you know what i'm\nsaying yeah yeah\nthe wiggle is good yeah\nright so i got i got a really good tip\num many years ago from someone who was\ndoing\nteaching us how to give speeches\nthis is back when i was in residency and\nso she was saying like you know as\nyou're giving a speech\num like come up with the first paragraph\nand she had us us\nuh throw and catch balls\nwhile we were like delivering the speech\nand what happens when you're like\ntossing a ball back and forth with\nsomeone else who's like giving a speech\nis that there's like movement involved\nand it kind of like loosens you up so\nlike a lot of people are really nervous\nbut like physiologically if you like\nmove physically while you're sort of\npracticing to give a speech it kind of\nlike reduces that tension and makes you\nfeel a lot more natural so i think a lot\nof the movement is is really good and\nyou don't want to be like so the whole\nthing about flirtation is that you don't\nwant to be heavy-handed right so you\ndon't want to say like oh take it the\nwhole point of flirtation is that it's\nlike subsurface communication yeah\nthat's the whole point\nyeah\nand so then that that's the kind of\nthing where it's like with innuendo plus\nlike facial expressions like you can you\nknow a little bit of like loose movement\nconfidence you're not tense you're not\nlike\nhahaha let me flirt with you please\nm'lady\nright so you want to just be chill like\nand also remember that if you're trying\nto flirt\nlow\nexpectations for yourself and the other\nperson right so the goal should be that\nboth y'all should walk away from the\ninteraction having enjoyed the\nexperience it's not about trying to get\nlaid or trying to get a date or anything\nlike that it's just like let's have this\nbrief interaction and if she's laughing\nat the end of it that makes me happy we\nboth sort of enjoyed that you know and\nthen like you can kind of like walk away\nif you need to right so you don't want\nto get overly invested you want to steer\nclear of stuff like worth the risk\num so so just try to have an engaging\nenjoyable interaction with another human\nbeing without attaching too much to it\nyeah\nthey agree with that a lot\ndon't don't try to\nseal a deal or get something out of it\nit's just\nhaving fun in the moment yeah like and\nand so i think that's where\nbeing\nattractive to other people is about you\nknow being\nenjoyable to spend time i have a\nquestion yeah okay\nso i know what alpha is i know what a\nbeta is what's a sigma\nah so chat may be able to answer better\nbut i think sigma is someone who just\nhas their own plan like doesn't play the\ngame and plays like their own\nindependent game\nokay\nright so\nlike\nin in the super bowl for example\nright so you have the winners and the\nlosers and then you have the people over\nhere playing dota\nwho are the sigmas all right got it\nis that is that correct\nhe knows that sounds good i've got my\npicture\ni may go get some tea or something\nthough\nsee sounds nice\nwhat kind\nsomething easy green tea sure\nyou want to handle the next one sure\noh\nthis one's loaded\nchat okay i'm gonna go i need to go pee\nand yeah you go do that i'm just gonna\nhang out with chad i'm not gonna do a\nsubreddit okay okay okay\nyou want munchie\ni don't want to munch on the microphone\nno munching on the microphone\nlove you

time\nokay\num okay let's keep going so\nuh my boyfriend is blaming his cheating\non me oh fun hi reddit i caught my\nboyfriend of three years texting a past\n[ __ ] buddy sexually explicit\nconversations this has been going on for\nover a month i think we've all seen\nthese posts before so i won't go into a\nton of detail the real problem is now\nhe's blaming me for his\nunhappiness in the relationship and\nthat's why he cheated i didn't try hard\nenough i never solve problems i always\nargue i don't believe he feels any real\nremorse and this is probably what hurts\nthe most\npsy anyway any tips or advice on how to\nregain my sanity and try to rebuild\nconfidence\nedit to say\nand this happened all on valentine's day\nouch ouch that's rough\nthat sucks\num\nyeah i don't i don't like that he's\nblaming her cheating is one thing and\nit's obviously not great um\nbut\nblaming somebody else for\nkind of your misdeeds is\ni feel like that's what makes this whole\nthing unsalvageable\nyeah i mean i i think that first of all\nit's not\nthis cheating is also pretty egregious\nit's not like oh it happened once this\nthis feels unfixable\num\nregain my sanity i think that's the big\nquestion right\nyeah so i think the first thing is that\nthis is not that uncommon right so when\nwe make\nbad decisions we oftentimes want to\nprovide rationalizations or\njustifications for them\nso this is something that i've heard a\nlot like professionally\nthat you know people will say like oh\nkind of you pushed me to cheat um\nand so for example like the the\nboyfriend is kind of accusing this\nperson of didn't try hard enough never\nsolve problems always argue\num\nand i know this is gonna sound kind of\nweird but like there there may be some\ntruth to that\nso for example like in a relationship\nlike if you think about someone who's\ngonna cheat chances are there's gonna be\nsomething about the relationship that\nthey're unhappy with right right um not\nnecessarily i mean they could be\nperfectly happy with it and just wanna\ncheat anyway but\nso so\nand that's what can be so hard is like\nwhen you have a combination of something\nlegitimately that's not perfect in the\nrelationship which is going to happen\nwith every relationship and then you\nhave someone using that as a\njustification or rationalization because\nremember when when our mind justifies or\nrationalizes things it doesn't justify\nwith falsehood it justifies with truth\nright but that's the tricky thing about\nthe mind is that like it's going to\njustify in a very selective way\nso this is where like you know the\nsimple response would be like you know\nif you thought i never solved problems\nlike why not like\ntalk about it right like like this is\nwhere even if if person a is doing some\nthings that are not perfect in the\nrelationship like arguing or not trying\nhard enough whatever the hell that means\num\nthen like how does that justify cheating\nright like that doesn't there's a huge\nlogical misstep there that oftentimes\nonce we start rationalizing or\njustifying like we just sort of miss\nand this is where if you've ever been in\nan argument with someone and they like\nyou know criticize you for something\nlike what's your first response is to\ncriticize them back\nright so it's like oh like you didn't\ntake out the trash well like you don't\ntake out the trash like blah blah blah\nright like you don't know\nand that's just naturally what the mind\ndoes that's what the ego does so there's\nan ego component to this\nit's kind of unfortunately common i\nthink the other sort of sad thing and\nthis is how you if you want to regain\nyour sanity is like\nif if your boyfriend says or girlfriend\nsays you didn't try hard enough so i\ncheated on you it's like\ndo you want to be in that relationship\nto begin with in the sense of like you\nknow\nhow hard do you have to try to prevent\nsomeone from cheating\nright i get sort of the sense that the\nboyfriend is not putting\nas much effort into the relationship\nlike\nand so in his mind he may\nbe in a weird way fair that if he's\nexpecting his girlfriend to do 90 of the\nwork\nand never solving pro like if you're\nexpecting your girlfriend to solve\nproblems or your boyfriend to solve\nproblems\nlike that's the kind of expectation that\ni don't think will lead to a healthy\nrelationship because i didn't try hard\nenough i never solve problems i always\nargue\nif in a relationship\nthe\nopera the subject of the sentence is not\nwe or us\nthat's going to be a problem and that's\na fight that i don't think you can win\nright like that's the kind of situation\nwhere\nif you kind of feel like um\nyou know if you get accused of not\nsolving problems or not trying hard\nenough or always arguing like the\nquestion the response to that for your\nown sanity is what is my partner putting\nin\nright because it's like shared\nresponsibility solving problems in a\nrelationship is not something that i\nhave to do or she has to do it's\nsomething that we have to like do\ntogether\nthat's the whole point of the\nrelationship so i think that\na couple of things to remember if you're\ntrying to regain your sanity is first is\nthat people will justify their bad\nbehavior by pointing out things that are\nsomewhat legitimate but are actually\nlike not the whole story right so maybe\nyou could\nwork on your communication a little bit\nbut just because\nyou know you can work on your\ncommunication doesn't justify his\ncheating the next thing to think a\nlittle bit about is that like if you're\nin a relationship where where\nthe person that you're with is not\nwilling to like share responsibility for\nrelationship problems like i never\nsolve problems i didn't try hard enough\nyou know that's the kind of thing where\nit's like that's shared responsibility\nright because it's a relationship\nso that's where\nyou know the fact that he doesn't feel\nany remorse i think should sort of tell\nyou\nin a weird way that like you're probably\nyou know that's kind of weird like he\ncheated on you if you really thought the\nrelationship wasn't working out the\nright move is just to break up with you\nright so say hey this relationship isn't\nworking out for me like i'm gonna it's\nnot to like\ntext people\nsexually explicitly\nwhy\nit's hard for me to hear you say like\nthis relationship isn't working out for\nme\nlike just those words coming out of your\nmouth\num this relationship was working out for\nme this is great yeah i like this love\nyou love you too\num\nbut what about regaining sanity and\nrebuilding confidence because that's\nlike\nyeah so i think oftentimes when we get\ndumped we like\nwe accept the other person's perspective\nbut i think this is where it's important\nto remember that like\njust because someone blames you for\nsomething doesn't mean that it's\naccurate right right and so this breakup\nhas a lot more to do with\nin my opinion i mean maybe we're getting\none side on the internet you only get\none side of the story right\nbut\num\nyou know what what we're sort of hearing\nis that if there were problems in the\nrelationship we're not really hearing\nwhat that looked like in terms of\nsolving problems or trying hard enough\num but it's very possible that there is\nlike we've been saying there's some\nkernel of truth so this is where like if\nyou want to regain your sanity anything\nthat you could have improved on in the\nrelationship you kind of work on for the\nsake of your next relationship but you\nalso don't accept what this person says\nbecause at the end of the day they were\nlike sending sexually explicit texts to\nyou know someone that they were sexually\nhad a relationship with so like that's\nnot on you right like that's on them\nyeah so i think a lot of the lost sanity\ncomes from when we start to accept\nresponsibility for other people's\nactions which is what\nthey\ntry to do like so when someone blames\nyou like they try to make you\nresponsible for their actions thereby\nabsolving themselves of blame\nand if you sort of\ndon't let them do that right so hold\nthem accountable for what they did and\nalso accept accountability for what you\ndid\ni think that's ultimately how you become\nsane\nand then prepare yourself for a healthy\nrelationship next time around\ni think practically\ngetting away from\nhim your mutual friends like that\nenvironment for a little while would be\ngood\ni mean this is\ni don't know if it's like the most\nhealthy coping mechanism or not but\npersonally\ni would just want to be away from it and\nthat also means like social media like\njust disengage from social media for a\nlittle bit um\ni think what you're trying to do is\nget him out of your mental space\nand not um\nspend your mental energy dwelling on\nwhat you did wrong what like replaying\nall these arguments i think it's gonna\nhappen but i think it needs to be\naway from your day-to-day environment\nthat you shared with this person\nnext\nyeah\ndopamine detox i see that in chat did\ndid we want to tell people where they\ncan sign up for dopamine detox stuff\num so i think there's some kind of\ndopamine detox stuff going on on our\ndiscord i hear it's going pretty well\nuh so this is a community driven event\nto help people develop a healthier\nrelationship with technology\nso a lot of times if you're trying to\nlike abstain from technology use it's\nsuper super challenging so we have a\ncommunity driven event that's going on\nright now that\ncan help you kind of plan and figure out\nokay like what are you going to do on\nday one what are you going to do on day\n2 day 2 what are you going to do on day\nthree um and it looks like it's at 11\na.m central time on what day though is\nit every day\nevery friday at 11 a.m central time so\nif y'all are interested in developing a\nhealthier relationship with technology\ndetox from stream if that's what you\ngotta do do it no i mean that's yeah you\nknow that's good i think that as much as\ni love chat and as much as it's nice if\nwe have viewers like\nif you all spent a month not watching\nnot engaging with any screens like i\nwould be happy yeah so what if our\nviewership goes down like that's not\nwhat we're here for terrible cult\nleaders\nyeah so bad\nultimately like it's for your benefit\nand if stream helps you get there then\nby all means watch but if\njoining a dopamine detox and staying\ncompletely free of twitch or whatever\nelse\nlike that's we want you to be healthy\nhappy\nright yeah\ndoes everybody know what dopamine detox\nmeans\num so\ni i don't know if people are super\nfamiliar with it but i think that y'all\ncan show up on fridays at 11 and kind of\ntalk about it\num\ni think i'm gonna do it\ni've been spending way too much time on\nsocial media lately\nall right i'm gonna do it\nokay\num\nokay let's move on\nso how do you converse with really\nattractive people i frequently find\nmyself just drifting away when talking\nto a person that really hits that bar of\nattractiveness it's not even like i'm\nfantasizing about that person but\nthere's a part of me that just wants to\nsit and stare at the work of beauty that\ni'm looking at and not pay attention to\na single word being said and that in the\npast has come off really wrongly to\navoid such a situation from arising i\nnormally avoid contact and or act cold\nbut that is not what i want to do either\ni just want to treat them like i would\nany other person because i think that\nit's unfair of me to treat someone like\nthat for no fault of theirs\nwhat causes this reaction it is probably\nthere was a result of some of there\nbeing some sexual attraction but why\ndoes it result in such a reaction\ndr k talked in a recent video about how\nhe doesn't care that the other person in\nfront of him is attractive or not this\nblows my mind how do you become a child\nand most importantly what what do i what\ndo you think i can consciously do to\nnavigate that situation can you truly\nbeat the ancient reptilian brain inside\nyou should you\nwhat do you think\nthis this is what happens to me every\nsingle time you know people think that\ni'm a chad but every time i see you it\njust\ni lose sight of everything i can't\nconcentrate\nthat makes you not a chat and i was like\nexcuse you\num\nall right\n[Music]\nwhat do you think i get tongue-tied\nsometimes\nwhen you are talking to me\nyeah\ni mean i get it\ni don't i thought that was a critical\nfail chad i don't think that was a\ncritical hit\nright so this is where like\nyou know you're not gonna bat a hundred\npercent\nwhich is fine\nno i mean i think it like\nit's almost sometimes people are so\nattractive they're intimidating\nand i wonder if this is more of like an\nintimidation thing than like uh oh my\ngod they're so attractive i can't\nfunction\ndoes that make sense\nyeah i mean i think that um\nyou know we can take some\nso the the\nmind and brain and sense organs tend to\nacclimatize to stimuli\nso if you think about like you know if\nyou walk into a house where there's food\nbeing cooked the first thing that you\nsmell is the food but as an hour goes by\nyou're you'll acclimatize that stimuli\nand you'll start kind of extinguishing\nit\nso i think the first thing to consider\nis that\nyou know you may have some kind of\nreaction but that over time that\nreaction should diminish\nokay the second thing that i'd say is\nthat you know how do you so if you have\nsome kind of reaction whether it's to an\nattractive person\nor you know fear every time you step out\nyou're outside your door or you know\nbeing afraid to close your eyes when you\ngo to sleep like whatever kind of\nreactions you have\ntry to understand like acknowledge that\nit's happening and try to understand\nlike\nwhat's happening and where it's coming\nfrom so i don't necessarily mean in like\na deep-rooted psychological sense like\nwhat is the physiology of this reaction\nso this is where a lot of times we\nautomatically sort of shoot for the\nmental side right oh my god like what\ndoes this mean like mentally am i\nintimidated right so that's a\npsychological\ninterpretation but oftentimes our our\nmood or mental state in our body will go\nhand in hand so when you feel like\ncrying you're going to feel like a lump\nin your throat you'll feel tightness in\nyour chest when you feel nervous\nthere'll be like butterflies in your\nstomach right\nso our physiology is a big part of\nour experience of\nthings right it's not just mental so the\nother thing that you can always try\ndoing is like breathing into it so we've\ndone several meditations about this that\nare sort of like oriented towards\nemotions but you know if you see someone\nand you kind of notice yourself having\nthis reaction i wouldn't avoid eye\ncontact or act cold i mean i know what\nyou kind of have to it maybe at the\nbeginning but this was just like take a\ndeep breath and kind of sigh\nyou know it may seem a little bit weird\nto do that if you're like in a\nconversation with someone please don't\ndo that\ndo that like as you're walking through\nthe door don't\nsnuck now\num and then and then kind of just notice\nwhere yeah maybe don't do that\nlike i said we're not batting 100 today\nchat\num\nyeah just go\nright and they'll do that and then\nyou'll be then you'll be totally fine\num\nso\nyeah so i'd say\nyou know just notice that reaction allow\nyourself to have the reaction oftentimes\nthrough suppressing our reactions to\nthings that's how we keep it there so\nyou want the reaction to kind of wash\nthrough you if that sort of makes sense\nright so what you want to do is like oh\nlike okay so here here we go again right\nso you don't want to say that you just\nkind of want to notice it and just kind\nof\nall right just kind of take a deep\nbreath and just like engage with the\nperson sort of start to think a little\nbit about okay what were they actually\nsaying like let me try to really focus\nand concentrate on what this person is\nsaying and interact with them as a human\nbeing and as you sort of breathe a\nlittle bit as you acknowledge what's\nhappening is you kind of let that\nreaction wash through you\nhopefully you'll start to just be able\nto talk to them\nand the good news is that\nit's kind of interesting i just realized\nanother thing so if you're avoiding eye\ncontact\nand remaining cold you're not giving\nyour mind oh this is actually really\ninteresting you're not giving your mind\nany kind of distraction so this could in\na weird way make things worse because\nyeah if you engage in a conversation and\nlike that conversation is engaging then\nyour mind will be able to distract\nitself from whatever stimuli you're kind\nof dealing with and you can actually\nlike talk to the person right so be\npresent with them\nand the more that you kind of avoid eye\ncontact and act cold like the more like\nthe only thought in your head that\nyou're sort of experiencing is that\ndrifting away around their\nattractiveness so interestingly enough i\nwonder if that's actually like\nnot is hurting more than helping\nokay i've got a couple of like practical\ntips\nwear sunglasses\nlike give yourself a little bit of grace\non the eye contact and stuff\num the second is smile because when you\nsmile\nand the other person smiles back at you\nthat'll help you relax i think and you\nwon't be like oh my god they're so\nattractive they're so attractive they're\nso attractive oh my god i think\nif you can kind of go into it with a\nsmile and like get some positive\nfeedback from them don't do that fake\nsmile though\nlet's face it allocates a smile\ndo this one that's a better smile you\ncan see the difference\ndon't do a fake smile\nyou want to show them the fake one\nthat's the fake one and this is the real\none i see the difference\ni've had to fake smile a lot these days\nplease\nanyway uh but yeah i think\ngetting some\npositive feedback so it doesn't feel so\nlike you're talking into a blank wall\num\nsunglasses smile i feel like i had a\nthird one but y'all are so attractive i\nforgot\n[Laughter]\nokay\num\nyeah so i think we're\nabout done you want to do like one or\ntwo more what do you think\nkim\nyou wanna just hang out with chat they\nhad a lot of questions\nabout what\nabout everything\ni mean we have\nwe're gonna have to wrap up in a few\nminutes yeah but\nwhy don't we just hang out with them for\na while\ninstead of\nsure another subreddit yeah so what are\ny'all what are y'all playing on lost ark\nlike what's good i'm playing uh\na sorceress\nwizard\ni'm playing a dwarf\nyou're not\ndo you want\nthere are no dwarfs unless okay i was\nlike\nhow long can i get away with it\nwhich class is best chat\ndoors\nis pay to win sorceress his sorcerers\npay to win\nmostly team dwarf\ndude that'd be awesome i'd play dwarf in\nlost ark if there was one is there one\ni may just be mistaken\nclassic psychiatrist you know what's\nepic is deep rock galactic hmm if you\nwant to play dwarf you should play deep\nrock\ni'll play with you yeah let's play deep\nrock okay\nour kids like it too yeah they're\nthey're really intense about it\ni'll look um\nhe put some on his lap and then you\ncould you do like the controlling right\nand then they just dig no no so so they\nknow they know the three buttons so they\nhave they can shoot\nthey can jump and they can use things\nlike the interaction so i will aim and\ni'll move and they'll perform all the\nactions\nif they like freak out he'll be like get\na movie get him get him and i'll hear\nevie like ah\nthey're coming\nyeah it's really great\nthe one one of the kids really loves\nskyrim and like kind of likes it too\nmuch so we had to stop playing it\nbecause it was like\nbut she's totally into like dual\nwielding axes like i was like oh do you\nwant to use a sword and she's like no i\nwant two axes\nand she likes uh\nshe also likes to use different kinds of\nmagic so she's super into it but where i\ni started playing pokemon with them yeah\nthat's they seem to seems to be like\ngood enough for them yeah\nthey're actually able to play that\nand then\nevie tilt or veer tilts pretty hard on\nmario right\nmom get it get it yeah\ni think that's just\nshe's she's\nher her tilting pretty hard on mario is\na consequence of her like actually\nunderstanding the game so i think it's\nactually a good milestone oh okay right\nbecause now she like understands the\nmechanics and she understands like when\nto be frustrated\nand\nyou know\nand i was like trying to explain to her\ni was like you can't bubble because like\ni i could die on this level right like\nso i you know i need you to like be\nalive so that i can respond and she's\nlike no but i'll just bubble with like\nthings\nshe's like no she like does not wait\nshe's like mom we're going she'll just\ngo oh yeah she has no\npresents she has no idea of like where\nother people are and so she'll just\nleave us behind indeed\ndota yeah i don't know if they're ready\nfor that nobody's ready for that\nthat too i was surprised because i\nthought that in dota they would like\nlike crystal maiden right because\nthey're super into frozen\nbut they like avi likes like viper and\nall of the monstrous\ncreatures there's a lot of monster\nempathy\nthat's really interesting\nall right you wanna do one more then\nany questions in chat or are we good\nyeah i think um we're gonna have to wrap\nup so chat who do y'all wanna raid\noh\nthanks for dropping by guppy face\nhassan asman\ndude i was watching asthma\nstream the other day he had 400 000\nviewers and he couldn't even log into\nlost ark yeah it was\nit was uh\nit was\nokay we can\nwho is anyone else doing like um\nvalentine's day related content\nradalinity i haven't heard people asking\nto raidalinity in a while\nhow do you defeat fomo\ni like that question what do you think\nhow do you how do you okay well ray\nd'alene how do you defeat fomo last\nquestion\num\nin my opinion like i i get fomo when i'm\ntrying to see what other people are\ndoing and like i want to do that i wanna\ndo that one do that and the best thing\nfor me is like well what do i wanna do\nand then i i\nhost the event or i like throw the thing\nor i start the company or whatever so i\nthink for me it's initiative that helps\nme with fomo\ninstead of like trying to\nsee what other people are doing and\ncatch in on that um to kind of make my\nown thing to do\nyeah i know this sounds kind of weird\nbut it's part of the way that i\ndeal with fomo is just to recognize that\nmost things in life i'm gonna miss out\non\nright if you really think about it like\nyou're gonna miss out\nlike of all of the experiences that\nhuman beings can have\nyou're gonna miss out on\nyou know the vast vast vast majority\nlike think about\nall of the bread that has been baked\nin the history of humanity and all the\ndelicious fresh loaves that people have\nkind of\neaten and you're not going to get to eat\nmost of those\nthis was really hard for me especially\nwhen i was like when i started to get\nlike serious professionally because i'd\nmiss things like i'd miss like gaming\nlaunches and stuff like that right so\nff14 is something that i really like\nmissed out on because i've heard that\nif i had been playing ff14 over the last\nlike three years it would have been one\nof the most\nawesome\nlike gaming experiences but that's just\nyou know you're gonna miss that that's\nokay\nand this is where i think a big part of\nfomo is the idea of like what's truly\nlimited\ndid i miss out on ff14 sure\nwas it epic certainly sounds like it and\nlike lost ark is out now and it's not\nlike there won't be other epic rpg\nexperiences available\nyou know so\nit's okay to miss out on things like\nlife is not really about trying to do\neverything\nit's about really appreciating like what\nyou have and what your opportunities are\nbecause the vast majority of stuff\nyou're gonna miss\ni know it sounds kind of weird but like\njust really think about that it's okay\nto miss stuff it's not like\nopportunities are really limited right\noh you didn't get to go to dinner this\nweek like there will be more dinners in\nthe future there will be more games in\nthe future there will be more things in\nthe future\noh i really want to play lost ark i\nreally want to play i really want to\nplay like i'm going to stay up till 5\na.m it's like what do you think is gonna\nhappen tomorrow like you're gonna\nyou can play tomorrow it's not like\nservers are going down in a week right\nso what's the rush\nnever know when the servers are going to\ngo down though\nit's true actually\nyou"
