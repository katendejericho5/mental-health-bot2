    "transcript": "everyone is stupid except me\nexactly like the title i struggle\ngetting pissed off by everyone because i\nfeel like they're dumb and a bad\ninfluence on me\ni just graduated high school and\nrecently moved states for a job\nopportunity i was good friends with a\nco-worker at first we got along well but\nthe more i got to know them the less i\ndesired wanting to continue my\nfriendship with them they make impulsive\ndecision\ncheat on their marriage partner and\nrecently disclosed to me how they can't\nget their own apartment because they\nhave a bad credit score from so much\ncredit card debt\ni want to help but fear i will lose\nmyself it's a bad investment of time\neveryone else i meet seems to be a\nfunctioning alcoholic and waste their\nmoney i try to have deep philosophical\ndiscussions with those i meet but either\nno one is interested or they do this\nthing where they pretend to be smart but\nare riddled with logical fallacies\ni ask someone why they believe religion\nis a belief system but not the same for\nconcepts like time or physical science\nand they respond with it just is\ni struggle finding people i want to be\nfriends with because of this and they\nhave\nand have spent the last few months\ncompletely on my own just working on\nmyself my finances the gym and studying\nbut i'm so lonely that i've been really\ndepressed because of it\nlife feels pointless because it feels\nlike there's no one who shares the same\nmindset i do\ni know i'm not crazy smart i often feel\nlike an idiot and still struggle a lot\nwith being impulsive that's why\nthat's why i can't have impulsive\nfriends because that environment of peer\npressure led me to going through an\nalcoholic phase of my own that i got out\nof a few months ago i was throwing money\naway on unfulfilling desires that i\ndidn't care about for the sake of saying\ni have friends\nmy main goal is to get my do and use my\njobs opportunity to expand it into real\nestate investments\ni want to surround myself with people\nwho help push me towards my greatest\npotential but i rarely meet anyone like\nthat\nboth of my parents are divorced and live\nalone with little to no friends i come\nfrom a racist country and a major\nproblem between us was me\ndating outside my race to the point i\nquestioned having to cut them out for\nthe sake of their future grandkids\nmy mom is amazing and cared so much for\nme but would constantly get upset and\nangry at me for spending time with dumb\nkids in high school\nand to this day will tell me to stop\nhanging out with someone when i tell her\nabout their problems\none of the few people i respect is my\ndad he is incredibly smart and very\nsuccessful yet he suffers the same fate\nof having absolutely no friends and\nbeing impossible to live with due to\nanger issues which is partially why i\nmoved out\ni love him and he is really one of the\nsmartest people i know but i only have\nbad memories of him getting upset at me\ngrowing up for not understanding things\ni swore to myself i would never end up\nlike him but find myself following his\nfootsteps\ni mean no disrespect by the title but i\ndon't know how else to better phrase my\nissue i want to stay friends with people\nand help them but i am i just\ncompromising my own life\nit's really hard for me to meet people\nwho i feel are productive and good\ninfluences but i also don't know if i'm\nbeing a cocky who is out of\ntouch with reality\nokay what a good post\nso\nlet's start with this\nso this is someone who says\neveryone else is dumb except for me\nright so we see this all over the\ninternet\nright you see this like people like to\nfind quotes of these people who are very\nsmart\nand put them out of context or maybe in\ncontext on places like\nthe subreddit i am very smart\nand i want to have deeply philosophical\ndiscussions\neveryone around me is impulsive no one\nis working towards their goals\ni feel very lonely\nand how do we respond to this person\ngenerally speaking\nno compassion\nright so\non these places like the internet and in\nlife we say have compassion for all\npeople\naccept people who think they're smarter\nthan everyone else\nthat's the one thing that you can say\nthat allows other people\nto treat you like crap\nright\nif you've been traumatized by someone\nelse you deserve compassion\nif your parents were narcissistic you\ndeserve compassion but if you think\nyou're better than me\nscrew you\nlet's make fun of you\nlet's\nlet's laugh at you\nright\nthat's the one thing it's kind of\ninteresting\nso i really respect this person because\nthis is a hard thing to say\nright it's like hard to say and even\nthey're very like they're\nself-reflective they've done some good\nwork and i think it's like it's amazing\nthat\nalready this person who is an i am very\nsmart person on the rest of the internet\nwould be treated like crap but already\nin our community they've become a little\nbit more self-reflective they've started\nto realize like a little bit about\nwhat's going on\nand so\nbeing very smart or feeling like you're\nreally smart is incredibly isolating\nright and we we hear this a lot it's\nhard for me to like meet people like\neven and we make fun of people who think\nthey're smarter than everyone else\nbecause they're like you know like\neveryone else like can't debate\nphilosophy and like quantum mechanics\nand philosophy and stoicism and whatever\nbuzzword you want nowadays\nrick and morty fans perfect\nso this experience first of all let's\nlike start from the top which is like\nwhat this person is essentially talking\nabout is like isolation an immense\nimmense amount of isolation and\nloneliness\nand we can also see that this person is\nmaking efforts right they're trying to\nmeet people they're trying to be nice\nthey're like worried though that if i\nhang out with someone who's like in\ncredit card debt and cheats on their hus\non their their partner am i going to\nwind up like hanging out with the wrong\npeople because\nyou know that that's not the direction i\nwant to go and they're like there's a\nvalid point there right\nso what's going on here\nlike how do you end up in this space how\ndo you end up in the place where you\nfeel lonely\nand you also feel like you're smarter\nthan everyone else and you tend to\nreject everyone around you for not being\nsmart enough you reject everyone around\nyou because they're not moving you in\nthe direction that you need to go you\nwant to surround yourself with people\nwho challenge you\nand like\nwant you want to push you to growth\nright\nso how did we get here and how do we get\nout of it\nso let's kind of take a look at this\nokay\nso\nthe first thing that i think everyone\nhere noticed so if you think you're\nsmarter than everyone else\nand you're lonely\nhow do you overcome this\nand and this is a good point right so\nlike the first thing that they kind of\nsay is that you should be careful with\nwho you hang out with right so not\neveryone that you encounter is\nnecessarily going to be worth your time\nthat's kind of like logical\nnot everyone around you is going to be\nlike interested in the same things that\nyou are so you may not want to invest in\nrelationships like that's pretty logical\ntoo\nbut i think there's a lot going on for\nthese people that i i think that they\ndon't realize\nand\nessentially what happens is since they\ndon't realize what's going on and they\nput on a particular error they get\njudged very harshly and like receive\nessentially no compassion so the first\nthing going on with this person is\nconditioning\nand this is something that if you've\nbeen a part of this community for a\nwhile like i don't need to point this\nout to you\nso this person judges other people for\nnot being good enough\nwhat were they conditioned to do\nright so if we kind of like talk about\ntheir\nmom um where's the section about their\nmom\nuh\nso my mom isn't amazing and cared for me\nso much so this person you respect her\nright but would constantly get upset and\nangry at me for spending time with gum\ndumb kids so what does this mean\nyour mom\ntaught you\nto be judgmental\nand so you were ingrained right any time\nhe this person tried to make a friend\nwhat did their mom say they're not the\nright race\nthey're gonna hold you back\nmy gifted golden child\nthey're not the right people to hang out\nwith\nthey're not the right influence\nmy golden child\nthey're not as good as you\nthis is conditioning\nwe can see it like this person even says\nlike\nyou know\ni want to help\nright so he wants to help people he\nwants to engage with people i'm assuming\nit's a he for a second i don't know why\nbut\nhe or she wants to help people\nright so this person wants to help\npeople but like what does their mind\ntell them\nlike their mind is just incredibly\nincredibly judgmental so the first thing\nis that\nyou know if we kind of think about like\nkids who grow up racist like why are\nthey racist is because of what they've\nbeen conditioned to be\nthe second thing here is that this\nperson longs for connection\nthe main thing that they're feeling is\nlonely\nand when we we start to feel lonely\nit's\nthat can manifest in all kinds of weird\nways and the loneliness can almost be a\nprotective mechanism so remember that\nthe things that hurt us in life that are\nhard to kick are often doing something\nfor us otherwise we wouldn't do them so\nour brain is really really good at\nfiguring out like\nwhat's a good deal and what's a bad deal\nand if you find yourself stuck in a\nsituation where you're torturing\nyourself or you feel like you're lonely\nand you can't make friends like there's\nsomething else going on underneath the\nsurface\nso the other thing to kind of point out\nis we say like okay\nthe other reason that i kind of\nmentioned connection here is they talk\nabout it as well\nbut you know what this person wants is\num\nyou know i try to have deep\nphilosophical discussions that's what\nthis person really wants so what they\nwant is the discussion\nso they're not saying i want to read a\nbook they're not interested in knowledge\nright what they're interested in is\ndiscussion\nand they're unable to find people who\ncan engage in discussion like for\nwhatever reason it just doesn't seem to\nbe they seem to be kind of\nmissing out on this\nso a couple of things that are like\nreally important here\nthe next is when we have this sort of\nsystem of enforced loneliness\nand we are judgmental\nwhen we are lonely due to judgmentalness\nwhat's going on\na couple of things\nokay the first is that\nfor people who have\nproblems with self-esteem\nand wind up lonely\nthey sometimes will apply employ the\ndefense mechanism of\ni'ma reject you\nbefore you reject me\nokay\nso i'm gonna ask you all a question\nwhat do you think what this person would\ndo\nif they found someone who was able to\nengage in a deep philosophical\ndiscussion let's say that there was\nsomeone who was like a phd student in\nphilosophy who really knew what they\nwere talking about\nwhat do you think would happen\nwould the person engage with them\nright it's interesting right so no one's\nsaying this person would be thrilled and\nbe like this is exactly what i'm looking\nfor\nso there could be a really interesting\ncognitive bias the only people i see are\nlike functional alcoholics like what\nnot everyone out there is a functional\nalcoholic maybe you're hanging out in\nthe wrong places like it could be it\npossible i'm not saying that you're not\nencountering functional alcoholics like\nmaybe you're not hanging out at\nuniversity campuses and stuff like that\nbut i'd be really really careful about\nwhat you do with what you're looking for\nright it's very very terrifying because\nif you're an amateur philosopher\nwho likes to smurf\nin\nwith people who are in credit card debt\nand like you meet someone you're like\nbecause like there's a certain amount of\nattacking going on here right so it's\nlike i ask why they believe religion is\na belief system but not the same for\nconcepts like\nphysical time or space it's like when\nyou're just pulling someone into that\nconversation it's kind of interesting\nright\nit's like by the way do you think\nreligion is a belief system and they're\nlike sure\nthey're like what about science no like\nscience is fact\nwhy\nright someone is saying sir this is\nwendy's exactly\nso like how do you get into these\nconversation like\nyou usually don't just like open up\nthere right so what i'm actually getting\nis that this person has a deep desire to\nbe challenged and to challenge people in\nreturn\nright it's kind of like it's interesting\nhere but i think that what this what\nthis discussion aspect comes to is\nactually what this person is really\nlooking for\nis to challenge other people\nand for that person to\nlive up to the challenge and in turn to\nbe challenged\ndoes that make sense like that's what\nlike i wanna i wanna throw something out\nand i want you to push back and i want\nyou to push back properly\nbut basically like it's like this person\nis going around in real life and like\nthrowing down to 1v1 mid\nit's like they're just showing up places\nthey're like hey let's 1v1 mid it's like\npeople aren't quite ready for that right\nit's like\nthis is like real life 1v1 meeting\nright debate bro yeah\nbut but there's even though we kind of\nmake fun of this person right like let's\nremember that we want to try to be\ncompassion and understand that what this\nperson is really looking for is to\nchallenge and to be challenged which in\nturn i think comes down to respect\nbecause what this person really wants is\nto be respected in a relationship and to\nrespect someone else in a relationship\nand this is where some of this stuff\ncomes in because if you're kind of\nfeeling lonely you got to be careful\nbecause you could be employing this\ndefense mechanism of i'm reject you\nbefore you reject me\nwhat else is going on when you're lonely\nand judgmental\noption number two on the differential\ndiagnosis\nis we hate in others\nthat\nwhich\nwe\ncannot\nfix\nin ourselves\n[Music]\nif you find yourself rejecting a\nparticular class of people\nthere's a decent chance that the reason\nyou reject them\nin the realm in the vein of screw you\nspecifically is because of something\nwithin yourself\nright\nso\nlet's kind of look at it seems like\neveryone i meet is a functioning\nalcoholic and wastes their money\npeer pressure led me to going through an\nalcoholic phase of my own and i was\nthrowing money away\ndoes that sound like anyone we know\nright and this is also like i also say\nit in kind of a meme sense but let's be\nclear\nthis is almost a survival mechanism\nbecause if you are\nif this has happened to you\nwhat is the lesson that your brain is\ngoing to learn\nsteer clear\nof\nfunctional alcoholics who waste their\nmoney\nright\nbecause you got pulled into this once\nbefore it's actually very logical\nbut at the same time you got to be very\ncareful because if you're rejecting a\nclass of people\nwhich is exactly what you yourself\nsuffered from\nthen like you've got to be kind of\ncareful from that right because a lot of\nthat rejection is then so people will\ntalk about things like projection\nor displacement\na reaction formation\nso what do these things mean\nso projection is when you know if i'm\ncheating on my spouse\ni will be paranoid and i will like be\nlike thinking like you're cheating on me\naren't you you're cheating on me aren't\nyou it's like actually coming from me\nbut i project it out onto other people\nthe other thing that could happen is\ndisplacement where i'm truly angry with\nmyself\nfor falling for this crap\nbut i'm taking the anger that i have\ntowards myself and i'm displacing it\nonto other people like those functional\nalcoholics those dumbasses they're so\nsuch terrible people\nand then reaction formation is somewhat\nsimilar so like the best example that i\nhave of reaction formation\nis the homophobic homosexual\nso some people grow up in a particular\nenvironment where they are taught to\nhate something\nor they're taught about homosexuality\nand how homosexuality is bad and they\nthemselves are homosexual and so the\nonly way they can like manage those\nfeelings is to lash out against other\nhomosexuals\nright so we hate in others that which we\ncannot fix in ourselves\nso that could be going on here too\num\nokay\nso the next thing is\nif you're having trouble engaging in\nrelationships\nif you're lonely\nso what we hear in this post is\nwhat this person wants\nright like this is where\ni want to meet people but no one is\ninterested or they want to do things\nwhere they pretend to be smart but are\nriddled with logical fallacies i don't\nthink they pretend to be smart i think\nthey\nyou know you just engage them in\nconversations maybe they pretend to be\nsmart who knows like maybe they're\ninsecure too\nbut if you want to have a relationship\nwith someone and your problem is\nloneliness a relationship is two ways\nright a relationship goes both ways so\nthe question is what do they want\nthis is where if you want to have a\nrelationship you may say like okay i\ndon't want those things\nbut like\nno relationship is going to be exactly\nwhat you want right that's not even a\nrelationship like\nlike\nmaybe you're looking for someone and\nthis maybe you're looking for someone\nwho wants the same things you want which\nis possible\nbut i think there's needs to be some\nkind of acknowledgement if you're if\nyou're lonely about like what's the\nother person's perspective like what do\nthey want from relationship\nand is it impossible for you to engage\nwith someone\nwho\ndoesn't want what you want or can you\nengage with them anyway and maybe give\nthem something that they want because\nmaybe if they do that\nthey'll give you what you want right\nthere's like an exchange in\nrelationships which i'm not really\ngetting much of the interesting thing is\nthat i think that this person does do\nthis\nso\nit's kind of interesting because if you\nreally talk about this example like good\nfriends with a co-worker at first we got\nher along well\nthey make impulsive decisions i want to\nhelp them so we see those elements there\nof like meeting people where they're at\nsupporting them in their own challenges\nall these kinds of things but then i\nthink this conditioning and all this\nother crap gets in the way so the right\nstuff is there\nright but there's this weird kind of\nconditioning where he's been taught to\nbe judgmental or she's been taught to be\njudgmental\nand and then like they're maybe afraid\nof being rejected and they maybe like\nsee negative parts of themselves in that\nother person which causes them to push\npeople away\nright\nand then we kind of get to the last\nthing which is\nwe try to\nfix\nour\ninternal problems\nby surrounding ourselves\nwith the opposite\nso this is kind of related to\num\nyou know this point here\nbut if i am impulsive and\nyou know like\nnot disciplined\nand vulnerable to alcoholism\nthen i think i can fix that by\nsurrounding myself with like phd\nstudents right who are like into\nphilosophy\nand there is some truth to this\nso you want to be careful like for\nexample if you're trying to get sober\nright they're like very powerful social\ncapital and community effects you don't\nwant to hang out with a bunch of people\nwho are actively using if you're trying\nto get sober there's a lot of like good\nreasonableness here\nbut at the same time be a little bit\ncareful because a lot of these problems\nyou're going to take with you right\nsurrounding yourself\nwith people who are like you know the\nopposite of what you are\ncan absolutely have a good influence on\nyou but it is not going to fix the\nproblem\nultimately if you're impulsive\nand like prone to alcohol those are\nthings that need to be internally fixed\nbut internally fixed in a supportive\nenvironment and that's where the\nenvironment kind of comes in right\nthat's why you have sober houses\nbecause it's easier to work do the\ninternal work when you're externally\nsupported so i'd absolutely\nrecommend that this person you know\nfinds a different company like that's\ntotally fine like if you want to go hang\nout with phd students\nat your local university go for it but\nbe careful about you know this business\nover here because what you may find is\nthat oh like\nyour mind may be looking for a way to\ndismiss them\nthat's what you have to be super careful\nabout\nbecause you may be finding some of the\nstuff that you actually want but your\nmind may be dismissing it because deep\ndown it's afraid of like being the\nstupidest kid in the room\nright and this is where i would start to\nask questions like\nyou know when your mom was there anyone\nthat your mom did want you to be friends\nwith and how did you feel\nlike hanging around them\nwhat was it like being around people who\nare smarter than you better than you\nfaster than you\nyou know better looking than you\nbecause there's a lot of stuff here that\ni think is conditioning there's a lot of\nstuff here that i think you could be\nlike\nyou know displacing on to other people\nbut the truth of the matter is that\npeople who are\nyou know feel like they're smarter than\neveryone else are\nincredibly lonely\nand like i know that the internet loves\nto hate on people who think they're\nsmarter than everyone else but the truth\nis like they're just as deserving of our\ncompassion as anyone else right we're\njust being judgmental and there's just\none thing that we find particularly\nannoying\nright it's like the i am very smart\npeople and the karen's\nand so like it's just really hard to\nhave compassion for some of these people\nand at the same time i think that this\nperson has done an awesome job because\nas we get as you know we start here and\neveryone's like screw this person\nand then as we get down to the the\nbottom it's like yeah you know i mean no\ndisrespect by the title\ni don't know how to better phrase my\nissue they're just being authentic right\ni want to say with friends but i'm just\nam i compromising my life it's really\nhard for me to meet people who i feel\nare productive and good influences but i\ndon't know if i'm being a cocky\nlike this is an incredibly like humble\nauthentic representation of this\nperson's problem this person is\nincredibly lonely\nand so what do you do if you're in this\nsituation where you genuinely feel like\nyou cannot meet people\nwho like are giving you what you want\ncannot challenge you you don't have\nmutual respect in a relationship right\nand this by the way so like\nwe'll get to that in a second so if\nyou're in this place i'd start with sort\nof looking at your conditioning\nwhere were you taught\nto think like this\nbecause chances are there's a lot of\njudgment in your past\neither in this case you are like your\nmom literally told you don't hang out\nwith that person that person is stupid\nis going to hold you back\nor you are on the receiving end of the\njudgment right or your mom called you\nstupid and so you like learn to call\nother people stupid we see this from\nthis person's dad too where the dad\ndoesn't know how to form relationships\nso this person literally was not taught\nhow to form relationships\nlike that's a skill that most of us just\nlearn because our parents like have\nrelationships\nand so when we're three years old and we\ndon't understand what's going on but my\ndad has an argument with his best friend\nand they start yelling at each other\nand they just ignore me because they're\ncaught up in it but i'm still watching\nit right it's still getting like laid\ndown in my brain in some way or shape or\nform\nso this person just was conditioned to\nthink this way\nsecondly they're incredibly lonely\nright they're not looking for knowledge\nthey're looking for discussion they want\nto be challenged\nthey want to challenge other people what\nthey're looking for is respect\nbut respect is mutual\nand you can't have mutual respect unless\nyou respect the other person\nand what i'm hearing is that when\nthere's judgment there's not a whole lot\nof respect\nso you're never going to have mutual\nrespect you're never going to have\nrelationship you have to start by\nrespecting the other person\nright like if you want a friend if\nyou're lonely you need mutual respect to\nhave friendships but as long as you're\nnot respecting the other person then\nlike how's it ever gonna happen\nanother thing to be careful about is\nthat sometimes we hate in others that\nwhich we cannot fix in ourselves\nand we understandably want to avoid\nthose kinds of people because they're\nbad influences\nand so we try to surround ourselves\nwith the right people the opposite\nbut we can try to surround ourselves\nwith whoever we want to and those people\ncan absolutely be good influences but\nthe problems i'm going to carry with me\nlike you know\nthey're going to come with you to some\ndegree so you've got to work on that\nand the last thing to kind of think a\nlittle bit about is like what does the\nother person want in the relationship\nwhy don't you ask them why does a\nrelationship all have to have to all be\nabout your needs\nso you start to go through some of these\nthings as you start to realize your\nconditioning as you start to recognize\nwhat some of your internal fears may be\nmaybe you're rejecting them before they\nget a chance to reject you\nright that could be going on\nwhat actually happens\nwhen you meet someone who challenges you\nhow do you actually respond to that\nperson\nbecause you may want a couple things\nmaybe you just steer clear of them\nsubconsciously\nor maybe you do all kinds of mental\ngymnastics to be judgmental toward them\nto knock them down a peg when they're\nbetter at philosophical discussions than\nyou are\nright it's very possible\nand at the end of the day i don't think\nthat you have to be lonely if you're in\nthis situation you really don't\nit's going to take some work and it's\ngoing to be hard work\nbecause this training does not happen\novernight right like you don't get to\nthis situation just randomly you get to\nthis situation when you've got two\nparents\nwho've been really rough\nin terms of teaching you how how to form\nrelationships\nwhen you have when you like make friends\nin this like when you're seven and your\nmom is like that person isn't smart\nenough for you like that sinks in deep\nyou've been programmed\nso it's hard to undo that and how do you\nstart starts with mutual respect\nit starts by thinking a little bit about\nother people's needs exploring yourself\nand then hopefully you can find what\nyou're looking for and by all means like\nexplore outside of your current domain\nbecause maybe you just need to go to\ndifferent places right so there's some\nvery practical stuff too\nright\nquestions\nyeah rip gifted kids with parents like\nthat absolutely\nsomeone's asking how do you deal with\nconditioning in general beyond\nrecognizing it so be recognizing it is\nactually like the lion's share of it so\nif you\ntrust the yogis from like ancient india\nthey will say\nrecognizing it is sufficient\nso the problem with conditioning is that\nit's like an invisible monster right you\nneed detection\nyou need like a century ward or whatever\nthe law equivalent is like you need to\nbe able to detect your enemy to do\nanything\nso the brain is pretty good the mind is\npretty good at like making the right\nchoice the biggest problem is like a\nproblem of misdiagnosis\nso once you figure out what the problem\nis and you like you guys may have seen\nthis on stream we haven't done\ninterviews a whole lot recently but\nyou'll kind of see the cathartic moment\nwhere someone realizes\nand then the behavior follows suit\nright there's even good evidence that\nshows that there's this thing called the\ninsight trial which is super fascinating\nwhich looked at the correlation between\ninsight and behavior so if you want to\nsee behavioral changes insight has to\ncome first and then the behavioral\nchanges seem to almost naturally follow\nso you can definitely do things to\nsupport the behavioral changes you can\noperationalize you can find the right\nkind of community you can do different\nkinds of exercises but actually insight\nis the most important thing\nonce you recognize that that is\nconditioning then you can intervene with\nit\nin the moment\nso if i go to let's say like a\nphilosophy club\nand i'm aware if i i'm on the lookout\nfor these things and someone shows up\nthere\nor even before i go it's like the day\nfor philosophy club is there i'm about\nto get in my car and then suddenly my\nmind is like oh why don't we just play\ngames like we can go next week\nwait i thought you were lonely i thought\nyou wanted deep discussions like why are\nyou suddenly thinking about playing\ngames\nlike where's that thought coming from\nright and as you begin to realize like\noh like and then you ask yourself the\nquestion\nhow do i feel about going like pick up\nyour car keys walk out to your car\nand then like notice that your heart\nrate\nis like\nthrough the roof\nyou're tachycardic and you're sweating\nand you're just like trying to get into\na car like what's wrong here\nand then you realize like something is\nup\nright so awareness of conditioning is\ncritical and then once you become aware\nof it then you can sort of realize like\noh this is me being afraid that like i'm\ngonna be the stupid one in the\nroom and so am i willing to let that\nfear take control of me it's okay if you\nare you can say yes like that fear is\ntoo much right now so be it\nor i'm gonna set that fear aside and i'm\ngonna try to go\nright and then you start to condition\nyourself in other ways\nso neurons that\nfire repeatedly get well grooved right\nso if we want to understand how\nconditioning works\nit's kind of like a game trail in the\nwilderness\nso it starts off with a field of grass\nthat is equally is all the same\nthen a mouse\nruns through the field and tramples a\nlittle bit of grass\nand then what happens is a rabbit is\napproaches the field and sees oh there's\none area where the grass is a little bit\ntrampled so the rabbit runs across the\nfield rabbit's bigger than a mouse so it\ntramples a little bit more grass\nand then there's something like a\nyou know like a small deer\nthat walks across it because it sees an\narea that's trampled\nand then like a bigger deer crosses it\nand then or another rabbit and then\nanother mouse and then suddenly you've\ngot a game trail that's the way your\nneurons work\nso when you're told by your mom over and\nover and over again that these people\nare not good enough for you you will\nstart to internalize that that is a\nwell-grooved set of neurons\nneurons that fire together wire together\nright so when you start to think in a\nparticular way all those neurons will\nget connected and then all you have to\ndo is trigger one neuron and it'll\ntrigger everything down the path\nso how do you start to do that it's the\nsame way you make a new game trail so in\na given moment in your life there's\ngonna be an easy path which you've\nwalked a thousand times before\nor there's a hard path\nyou have to walk through the grass and\nthat's gonna require more energy it's\ngonna be more difficult\nyou recognize that right that's like\nfacing that fear in the moment that\nyou're going to go to the philosophy\nclub meeting\nand so actually going to the meeting is\nwalking\ncreating a new game trailer we're not\neven at a great game trail we're walking\nthrough the tall grass and it requires\nway more effort than going down the game\ntrail\nthe interesting thing though is the\nsecond time you go to the philosophy\nclub meeting it's gonna be easier\nbecause now there's a little bit of\ntrampled grass and then you do that a\nsecond time and a third time and a\nfourth time and then suddenly by the end\nof it and i've seen this a ton in people\nwho are alcoholics for example\ntwo years three years into sobriety they\ndon't even want to drink\nso their neurons have been literally\nrewired they've been reconditioned\nbut it all starts with awareness\nright it all starts with awareness\nyou"
