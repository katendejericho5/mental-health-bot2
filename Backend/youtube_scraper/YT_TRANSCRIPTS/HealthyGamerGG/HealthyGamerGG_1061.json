    "transcript": "and so the first thing to understand is\nthat like as long as that process\ncan be improved then you will be a\nbetter communicator okay\nso to start with\nlet's understand this\nokay\nso why can't i talk like the way i do in\nmy mind this is such a great question\nwhenever i'm in my head rehearsing\nspeeches or conversations i talk so\neloquently and articulated but when it's\ntime to speak to\nwhen it's time to come to speak with my\nmouth i end up stumbling stuttering or\nforgetting what i'm saying and about\nto say\nit happens to me a lot to the point\nwhere i don't want to speak sometimes\nand i wish i can talk like that\nattractive chad inside my head\ni do have anxiety and fear of judgment\nalong with adhd in case that affects it\nwhy does this happen and how can we\ntrain to overcome this does it have a\nterm\nwhat a great question\nso\na lot of times\nwe think thoughts in our head\nand the thoughts in our head are so pure\nso clean they make such perfect sense\nand then our beautiful mind is like hey\nlet us share this brilliance with the\nworld\nand then something happens somewhere\nbetween the brilliance in your mind and\nthe words that come out of your mouth\nsomething gets super garbled and it\ncomes out like a hot mess\nand then people are super confused\nbecause they're like why is this\nhappening i understood it it made so\nmuch sense in my head i understood it so\nwell\nin my head like what happened\nokay\nso\nwe're gonna talk a little bit about\num\nyou know why this happens\nso to start off with\nwe have\nthoughts that are kind of perfect in our\nhead right\nso let's start with this like what part\nof our brain\ndictates speech right so we have like\nour left hemisphere is very speech\noriented we have something that i'm just\ngoing to go ahead and call the\nlinguistic cortex\nso we have a part of our brain that like\nchooses words and formulates like how to\nsay things\nbut the interesting thing is that\nthoughts\nare not restricted to the linguistic\ncortex right so for example we have the\ndefault mode network which is the part\nof our mind that gives us the capacity\nto self-reflect and is hyperactive when\nwe're depressed so when we're beating\nourselves up in depression oh i'm i'm\ni'm stupid i'm dumb i'm this people\ndon't like me people would be better off\nwithout me the everyone would have more\nfun at the party if i wasn't there like\nall these kinds of thoughts those are\nnot coming from the linguistic cortex\nright those are coming from your default\nmode network\nwe have a limbic system we have frontal\nlobes we have all these different\ncortices that will manage things like\nrisk assessment and anxiety and\nmathematics we have all these different\nparts of our brain that think\nwe also have empathic circuits of the\nbrain right which are like help us\nunderstand other people none of those\nthings are the linguistic cortex\nso the first thing to understand\nis that when we have thoughts they exist\nin all these different parts of our\nbrain\nand when we speak\nall that crap has to get channeled\nthrough the linguistic cortex\nand by channeling it through the\nlinguistic cortex we talk\nand so the first thing to understand is\nthat like as long as that process\ncan be improved then you will be a\nbetter communicator okay\nso to start with\nlet's understand this\nso\nwhy can't the thoughts in my head\ntranslate to the words that come out of\nmy mouth\nand the short answer is because\ncommunication\nis a skill\nso you know there are all kinds of other\nthings i can do in my head besides think\nright\nso i was like in the shower this morning\nand i was you know washing my hair and\nwhatnot and washing my face and i\nimagined doing a ninja kick i don't even\nknow what that is right so i'm just\nmaking this up but like i imagine like\njumping over the fence and like doing\nall this parkour and it would be so cool\nif i could like jump and like i'm gonna\nbe like star wars kid and darth maul and\nall this good stuff\nright and i can imagine those things but\nwhy can't my body do those things\ni can imagine it\nand so why do we assume that\ncommunication is different why do we\nassume that just because we can think\none thing i can think in ninja moves or\nmatrix martial arts sequences but that\ndoesn't mean my body can do them why do\nwe assume for a moment that just because\ni can think articulately that speaking\narticulately should come automatically\nright so it comes down to the fact that\ncommunication is a skill\nso what are the components of\ncommunication so the first that we kind\nof talked about is the linguistic cortex\nso if you want to be an effective\nspeaker\nyou have to like\nwork on the neurons that translate\nthoughts\ninto words\nand we know that people do this right so\nlike we know for example like\nif you're an author\nor let's say like you do creative\nwriting\nso i'm just gonna use writing as an\nexample where you can have a scene in\nyour head you can even have the words in\nyour head he walked into the room\nand he was\nyou know\ncovered in\nsweat\nlike you can like think that and then\nyou write it out and it's like that\ndoesn't convey what i want\nright so like getting stuff through the\nlinguistic cortex takes practice\nso then people may wonder a little bit\nabout\num\nyou know so\nwhat are some of the ways in which you\ncan do this so the first thing that you\ncan do is you can write stuff out\ni don't know if you guys just noticed\nbut\nwhat did i just look at\ndid y'all notice what was i looking at\ni did this i was like what was i looking\nat what do y'all think\nright so i've written things out\nand so as i write things out it\nclarifies things in my mind and\nfacilitates the process of getting the\nthoughts in my head out the linguistic\ncortex and like through my mouth\nso it's interesting right so you can\nwrite things out so i've also i sort of\nalso recently discovered or like not\nrecently but somewhat you know maybe a\nyear or two ago the part of the reason\ni'm successful on stream is that i spent\nabout 10 years like trying to write a\nbook and it was crap so like the book\nsucked but what happened during those 10\nyears is i clarified a lot of my ideas\nso when you write stuff out you know you\ncan go through the process of clarifying\nideas\nand so the clarification of ideas can be\ndone through writing stuff out but i\nalso do this in terms of like verbal\ncommunication without writing things out\nso let's say i've got a patient with\nnarcissistic parents and the holidays\nare coming up so when they come into my\noffice and they're saying i'm anxious\nabout the holidays i don't want to see\nmy parents i know they're going to fight\nabout this or they don't have to be\nnarcissistic they can be like\nirregular people but they're just going\nto ask me when am i going to get married\nand like i don't want to have that\nconversation\nand so there's a lot of stuff that they\ncan tell me\nin their office\nright they can say to me like hey like i\ni want to say this and i want to say\nthis and i want to say this but when it\ncomes to actually talking to them it's\nhard so what do we do we role play right\nwe're like okay so like tell me what you\nwould want to say\nand then i'll help them with their\nphrasing and we'll kind of like coach\nthem through like okay why don't you say\nthis or you could say this i've had\nconversations like this with like\npatients of mine who want to talk to\ntheir boss about\nwanting more time off or like you know\nbreaking the news to their boss that\nthey're pregnant because they're\nterrified of you know how it's going to\naffect their promotion and things like\nthat forget the fact that it's illegal\nbut you know no one cares about that\nso there's all kinds of like practice\nyou can literally do with your\nlinguistic cortex so this can be things\nlike role-playing conversations\nand you can like role-play it in your\nhead if you want to but i think um\nif you've got someone that you can talk\nthings through with\nright so we also have these phrases like\nsounding board\nyou can you can just practice\nso that's like the first thing if you\nwant to be an effective communicator you\ncan practice\nthe second reason this is kind of big\nthat\ncommunication everything makes perfect\nsense in your head and doesn't translate\nis because of assumptions\nso\nwhen you are thinking in your head\nyou have a bunch of assumptions\nbut you perfectly understand what your\nassumptions are because they're your\nassumptions so there's no gap between\nlike you know if i'm trying to say\none two three four\nbut i don't realize that my mind is\nautomatically filling in these gaps\nright so then oh this is like perfect\nit's a complete line fantastic\nbut when i start talking it comes out\njarbled\nand what's missing it's the assumptions\nso when you communicate it doesn't come\nout the right way or people don't\nunderstand it the right way so the other\nthing to think a little bit about is if\nwe're saying how do i communicate\neffectively\npart of that effective communication\ninvolves the other person right so how\ndo you deal with assumptions\nso this is where it's kind of\ninteresting but this is where the\nempathic circuits of your brain come in\nso\neven authors do this right because like\nand when an author is writing something\nthey may know more of the story than\nthey want the reader to know but what\nthey literally have to do is put\nthemselves in the shoes of the reader\nand look at things from the reader's\nperspective\nwhat are the things that are missing\nfrom this story what do i need to\nexplain what are the things that i want\nto purposely keep from the story because\nevery author who has sat down to write a\nbest-selling novel that had a plot to us\nat the end they know the plot twist from\nmoment one\nbut it's their ability to empathize with\nthe reader that allows them to put in\nthe plot twist because for them it's not\na plot twist it's all figured out like\nthey know everything right at the\nbeginning right\nso in a similar way if we want to\ncommunicate with someone else what we\nneed to understand is what are our own\nassumptions\nand how can we have our audience\nunderstand those assumptions and\noftentimes what's missing between our\nhead and the perfection of our head and\nwhat is what we give to the rest of the\nworld what's missing is this stuff right\nit's the in between stuff\nso as we learn how to be more empathic\nand we think a little bit about our\naudience\nwe will start to be better at\ncommunicating so i know this sounds kind\nof weird but like i'm a psychiatrist\nright so like what is my job\nwhat have i trained myself to do what\ni've trained myself to do is put myself\ninto someone else's shoes okay what's\ngoing on in this person's head it's not\nabout who's right and who's wrong if i\ntell this person hey your thinking is\nwrong gg\nthis is what you should do just\nget up every day like i wouldn't be\nsuccessful at all right\nso being a successful psychiatrist being\na successful therapist being a good\nfriend\nbeing a good parent\nbeing a good kid\nis about acknowledging your own\nassumptions and meeting people where\nthey're at right so if i want to like if\ni want to be an effective communicator\nand i want to convey\nyou know this line i have to start by\nunderstanding okay like where is my\naudience what do they have and what do\nthey not have oh that's kind of\ninteresting so they already have this\npart so actually what i need to to say\nis this part\nwhich is very different from what i was\nenvisioning because in my original\nvision i only needed this\nthis\nthis and this\nand so if you want to effectively\ncommunicate instead of like operating\nfrom your own mind and this is how we\nget all these kinds of things like why\ncan't you understand i don't know how do\ni get my kids to realize how do i get my\nparents to realize that is you pulling\nthem towards this\ninstead of operating from here because\nwhen you start communicating this way\nyou're like okay so they already get\nthis part so i'm going to provide this\nand i'm going to provide this and then\nwe'll be golden so this is how you be an\neffective communicator\nso if you want your thoughts to\ntranslate in a way that lands well\nwith other people\nit involves your empathic circuits of\nthe brain\nokay\nso in short\nwe've got a couple of things to think\nabout so if your problem is\nwhy can't i talk the way i do in my mind\nthe first thing that you've got to\nunderstand is that\nbeing able to convey the thoughts out of\nyour head is a skill\nso it can be practice like i can imagine\nall i can imagine a drawing\nbut i can't make a drawing i can imagine\ndoing gymnastics but i can't do\ngymnastics there are all kinds of things\ni can imagine in my mind and your\nthoughts like you know communicating is\nno different\nand so this is a skill and what are the\ncomponents of the skill okay just to\nkind of summarize\nnumber one is training the linguistic\ncortex\nright so everything's got to come\nthrough the linguistic cortex whether\nyou write or you speak\nso this can involve things like writing\nthings out\nright this can involve role playing\neven rehearsal\nright so these are examples of\nessentially practice they're practicing\na skill the second thing is it comes\ndown to assumptions\nso the biggest gaps in our thinking\nare assumptions\nso like we just don't realize what other\npeople are missing and if we want to be\neffective communicators we need to\nengage our empathic circuitry\nunderstand what does someone else\nunderstand we need to start there\nbecause our communication is going to\ndepend on their understanding not our\nunderstanding right to bridge the gap\nbetween where they are and where you are\ni'm trying to drag people over here\nwhy don't you understand why don't you\nunderstand why can't you understand why\ncan't you understand my boss doesn't\nunderstand my girlfriend doesn't\nunderstand my boyfriend doesn't\nunderstand my dog doesn't understand\ninstead we need to go where they are\nright and then we're going to go here\nand then we're going to go here and then\nwe're going to go here and then we're\ngoing to go here and then we're going to\ngo here then we're going to go here then\nwe're going to go here\nthis is how coaching works so we train\nour coaches to meet their clients where\nthey're at so a client comes in and says\ni need to\nyou know i need to get a job\nand so the coach is like okay cool so\nthat's your goal for coaching right\nthey're like yeah my goal is to get a\njob\nand then over time like they may realize\nthat like okay so that's what the client\nwants it's the fantasy that the client\nwants but they have so much crap on\ntheir plate they're not ready for a job\nyet\nevery time they try to work on a resume\nthey deal with so much emotional\nresistance and shame\nthey're like oh my god i'm so like they\ntry to put together that i have nothing\nto put on my resume\nand then they quit and they like go\ndistract themselves for a week\nand so it's like the first thing coach\nhas to do is like work on their shame\nbut like if you tell the client hey you\nneed to like process your shame before\nyou get a job they're like no i need a\njob\ni need a job like that's my goal so you\nhave to like lead them there like one\nstep at a time right so you have to\nstart like you got to meet them where\nthey're at\nif that makes sense\nokay\nso the last thing\nthat you can do\nis calm the mind\nokay\nso this is where if we look at clinical\nstuff so for example like let's look at\nmania\nso when someone has bipolar disorder and\nthey become manic\nthere's an alteration to the thought\nprocess\nand there's an increase of rapidity of\nspeech\nas a result\nmanic people\nmake no sense\nif you guys have ever like talked to a\nmanic person you kind of know what i'm\ntalking about but like their thoughts\nare super super rapid\nand they speak very very very rapidly\nand they make no sense\ni know everyone is joking about xqc but\nxqc is not a good example of this xqc is\nactually\nvery very effective at communicating\nxqc can summarize things very very\neasily\nright like he'll drop\nserious like knowledge bombs\nseriously i'm not kidding\nthat's why if he was really nonsensical\nand unable to communicate he would not\nsucceed on twitch\nyou guys get that\nso i know everyone memes about that he's\ndefinitely very vata for sure\nand his thoughts kind of jump around all\nover the place so so do i for that\nmatter\nso in mania what we see is that you know\nspeeding up the thought process and the\nrapidity of speech correlates with\nmaking no sense to the other people so\nwhat we can kind of infer is that\ncalming down yourself will probably lead\nto better communication\nso if i'm planning on giving a speech in\nfront of my class and i do some kind of\nbreathing exercises sometimes even as a\npsychiatrist i'll prescribe something\nlike propranolol which is an adrenergic\nblocker so reduces the effects of the\nsympathetic nervous system and reduces\nthe effects of adrenaline and helps\npeople give a public speech what are we\ndoing propranolol is literally a drug\nthat slows down\nthe speed of your mind the speed of your\nnervous system\nand as a result people are able to\ncommunicate more effectively\nso calm the mind and slow things down is\nthe last thing so you can do breathing\nexercises etc etc\nso if you want to be able to communicate\neffectively and you want the stuff in\nhere\nto come out of your mouth in a way that\nother people can understand do these\nthree things\npractice with your linguistic cortex\nfocus on assumptions and think about\ntheir point of view so that you can\nstructure your communication to be more\neffective and calm down the mind and\nslow down a little bit\nquestions\ncan you only do third sure\nyou don't have to do all three\nbut those are the three different\nmechanisms that in my experience are at\nplay like there are probably many more\ngenerally speaking when i face a problem\ni find that\nrather than going all in on one solution\nthat's sort of recognizing that problems\nare multifactorial right so like the\ninability to speak\ncoherently\nisn't it's not like there's a coherent\nspeech circuit in your brain i mean this\nsort of is the linguistic cortex but\nthere's all kinds of other things going\non right because your brain is inside\nyour body if your body is flooded with\nadrenaline that's going to affect your\nneurochemistry so it's not just as\nsimple as the linguistic cortex\nspeech in the translation of thought is\na complex phenomenon in the brain and\ntherefore\nwe it has a complex solution\ndo you think it's possible for people to\nrationalize their thoughts\nuh\nthey can't say through expression arts\nmusic math problems sports freeform\ngames absolutely there's overwhelming\nevidence that that is the case\nso for example if you look at things\nlike art therapy\nnot only can you like\nrationalize your thoughts you can even\nheal the mind through some of these\nthings so we assume that therapy\ninvolves one human being talking to\nanother human being but there are all\nkinds of other things that you can do\nthrough music through art that will like\nemotionally process stuff so there's\nstrong strong evidence of that\nyeah can you do the same type of\npracticing for casual conversations as\nwell absolutely right so like casual\nconversation is something you can\npractice\nlike just about anything in life can be\npracticed\nyou"
