    "transcript": "if you decide okay so if religion is can\nbe good for my mental health but like\nwhat if i'm not religious does that mean\ni mean i need to become religious i'd\nsay absolutely not you do not need to\nbecome religious\nif you are you know not religiously\ninclined then here are the things that\nyou should do all right\nso parents blame mental health problems\non lack of religious faith so hello hg\ncommunity and thank you for being an\nopen place to discuss things good job\neveryone at hg\nfor as long as i remember i have had\nproblems with my mental health it has\nbeen especially hard during the time\nwhere i have been away from parents to\ncomplete studies whenever i try to have\nthis conversation with my parents on my\ndeclining mental health my parents\nespecially my father makes it a point\nthat this decline has been in large part\ndue to me not taking my religion\nseriously islam\nand i should just pray and be more pious\nnow i understand where he's coming from\nhe was born during a time of war and\nrevolution in my country of origin and\nhe got to where he is despite those\ncircumstances through a strong spiritual\nfaith as a result whenever he says this\nto me instead of feeling better i just\nfeel ashamed and guilty because i'm not\npious or mentally strong\nas he is\ni do admit i have some doubts and\nnegative feelings towards my religion\nand have not been practicing my faith\nmuch because it brings about a pain a\nlot of painful memories because in my\ncountry it was used as a tool of control\nand oppression\ni still don't know where i stand\nregarding religion\nin large part because i feel like i have\nnot had the time to explore what it\nmeans to to me and to separate it from\nthe negative ways it's been used to\ncontrol and make people miserable\nhow should i reignite the threat of\ndiscussion with my parents in a fruitful\nway\nsorry for the long post and thank you\nfor reading if you did\nokay\nso i think this is a really really\nimportant post\num and there are a couple of things that\ni want to start with which are actually\ndisclaimers of sort and just like\nsetting some ground rules so i\nunderstand that religion can be quite a\ndivisive topic right so we touched on\none or two of those back in 2021 and i\nguess we haven't learned our lesson yet\nso here we go\nso we're going to talk a little bit\nabout religion and mental health today\ni want to lay out a couple of\ndisclaimers so the first is that i'm not\nan expert on religion i'm not a\nreligious scholar i don't really know\nyou know\nit's not my field of expertise\nuh that being said i have spent a lot of\ntime exploring religion so i grew up\ngoing to a catholic school i'm pretty\nfamiliar with christianity and\ncatholicism\nyou know and then also like went through\nmy own journey i grew up hindu\nbut was basically agnostic or atheistic\nfor like most of my life\nare not most now because i'm older and\nthen sort of rediscovered a a love for\nkarmic religions for lack of a better\nterm so this sort of includes hinduism\nbuddhism jainism\num eastern religions is another way to\nput out once i understood what they were\nactually saying\nand so there may be a bias there because\ni have you know explored a lot of\ndifferent religions and sort of decided\non a particular spiritual path which\nsuits me so apologies if it comes across\nas biased in that way\nand the last thing is that i think that\nthis is the reason i'm sort of bringing\nit up is because i think that this is an\nimportant thing to talk about because a\nlot of the world is religious and what's\nthe relationship between religion and\nmental health so i'd like to approach\nthis in the way that we do at other\nthings at hg which is like let's just\nkind of like look at it pretty\ncritically and analytically and try to\nunderstand does religion have a positive\nimpact on mental health negative impact\non mental health and if it does have a\npositive or negative impact what are the\nreasons for that what are the mechanisms\nfor it\nand so i think what we'll sort of\ndiscover is actually pretty cool okay\nso the first thing that we're going to\ntalk about\nis i know it sounds kind of weird before\nwe get into religion\nwhat\nimproves\nmental health\nokay so there are all kinds of things\nthat contribute to your mental health\nlike physical health diet et cetera\nbut we're what we're going to start by\nfocusing on\nis actually\nsomething called common factors research\nso\nsome time ago there was one form of\nessentially psychotherapy\num and that form was psychoanalysis was\ndiscovered by like freud and yung and\nthose people and then over time\npsychoanalysis\nbecame\npsychotherapy\nor psychodynamic\npsychotherapy\nand then like over time like we had this\ngroup of behaviorists that developed\ncognitive behavioral therapy oh no\nwe're lagging\nand then someone who was learned cbt and\npsychotherapy learned how to meditate\nand they're like hey this is cool\nand they developed dialectical\nbehavioral therapy and i can see that\nwe're lagging so i'm gonna just\ni guess i'm just going to talk\noh no there it goes\nokay\nand so then what we sort of discovered\nis that there's a bunch of different\ntypes of psychotherapy right so like and\nthey're quite different so uh oh\nso cognitive behavioral therapy is very\ndifferent from dbt because like this has\na mindfulness component psychodynamic\npsychotherapy is similar to\npsychoanalysis so it's like quite\ndifferent\nand so people sat down and they started\nto figure out okay like which one of\nthese is best because they're very\ndifferent in one we're talking about\nyour your your you know your dreams\nwe're anal we're doing dream analysis\nlike this is over here\nlike dream analysis is like quite\ndifferent from meditation\nwhich is like quite different from doing\nlike worksheets\nabout your feelings\nso these are all very different which\none's the best\nso as people started to compare\ndifferent things\nwhat they sort of discovered is they're\nall about the same\nand then that got really confusing\nbecause it's like how is like how does\nmeditation offer the same benefit\nas something like dream analysis like\nhow the hell does that even work like\nhow can these things essentially\ngive you the same benefit like that\ndoesn't make any sense because they're\nso different\nand so what people sort of started\nlooking at is something called common\nfactors research and this ipad thing is\nlacking lagging so we're gonna just\ngo old school lecture style okay\nso they looked at common factors\nresearch and essentially what they\nfigured out is that oh it's not actually\nany one of these particular things but\nthere's a set of common factors that\nwill determine whether something is\nmentally like helps your mental health\nor doesn't help your mental health\nso there are two or three big things\nthat they sort of discovered the first\nis something called the therapeutic\nalliance so you need to have someone\nthat you can trust and talk to\nlike that\nthat can like sort of handle your mental\nthings you need a consistent trusted\nspace to go to with your mental health\nproblems\nthe second thing that they discovered\nwas that you need an organizing\nframework\nso like the good therapists are not\nnecessarily it's not that cbt is like\nmore correct than psychoanalysis\nor that dbt is more correct than cbt\nit's that whoever is like teaching you\nthe stuff or whoever is offering mental\nhealth support needs to have an\norganizing framework that sort of\nencompasses everything that we kind of\nlook at\nand so this these were kind of two of\nthe really big things that they they\nkind of discovered\nso the interesting thing is that you\nknow back in the day\nwe didn't really have like an\nappreciation for mental health so like\nwhere did people go with their mental\nhealth problems right so if i feel sad\nor i lose a child and i'm going through\nthe grief process\nwho do i go to like help me make sense\nof that because we've sort of discovered\nthrough research that that's really\nimportant for people who's like where's\nlike a place that organizes the way that\ni view the world and a lens that that\nthat i can use to understand problems in\nmyself\nand this used to be done through\nreligion right so like\nthat's what religion sort of did like if\nyou lose your kid like who do i turn to\nlike okay i'm gonna turn to like a\npriest right so hopefully there's like a\nstrong therapeutic alliance there\nthere's a trusted person who has an\norganizing framework that they can use\nto like help me\nnavigate my problems and we even see\nthis from this particular poster that\nthis person's dad went through a very\nyou know tumultuous time in their life\nthat was not easy and religion sort of\ngave them answers gave them a narrative\ngave them maybe a trusted space\nand so they used those kinds of things\nto kind of like navigate their life and\nget some kind of mental strength and\nfortitude so that sort of makes sense\nright so like if you kind of look at it\nthat way religion sort of touches on a\ncouple of the parts of common factors\nresearch\nokay\nso\nyou know what do we need we need a\ntherapeutic alliance\nand then we need an organizing framework\nand in the past this is where we you\nknow religion used to do these two\nthings so a couple of other big things\nthat are very very important\nthat religion does for us one is it\ngives us a sense of community or social\ncapital\nthere have been numerous studies that\nshow that social interactions and social\ncapital are good for mental health\nright so like isolation makes mental\nhealth problems worse\ncommunity makes mental health problems\nbetter we have like a shared group of\npeople that we can like survive with or\nprocess things with right so we see this\na lot for example with like the jewish\ndiaspora where there's like a very very\nstrong sense of like community and like\nan almost us versus them kind of\nmentality which has downsides\nbut that strong social connection we see\nthis a lot also amongst like you know\nindian diaspora too so like indians and\nhindus like we all hang out with each\nother right because this is like our\nshared culture it's our religion so we\nhave a strong sense of community at\nleast where i live\nand we kind of all get together and\nthese have positive impacts on mental\nhealth so religion kind of offers you\nknow a safe space theoretically\nwhere people you can trust\nreligion offers definitely offers an\norganizing framework right depending on\nwhich religion you believe in stuff like\nheaven hell\nsin good bad\net cetera like it just gives us lots of\nlike ways to view the world why does a\nbad thing happen to me well because\nreligion will give you an answer\nand i'll say because of this and that it\ndefinitely offers a sense of community\nright and then there are two other\nthings that i think are really really\nimportant that religion offers\none is sublimation of ego\nso if you guys watch our streams a lot\nyou're gonna know that a lot of our\nsuffering comes from our ego ego isn't\nall bad\nbut religion is essentially like\nat least abrahamic religions tend to be\nlike very sublimating the ego oriented\nso a good example of this is alcoholics\nanonymous\nso this is something i know a little bit\nmore about which is why i'm going to use\nthis as an example so alcoholics\nanonymous is a very successful on the on\nthe whole a very successful organization\nthat helps people\ngain sobriety there are some studies\nthat even suggest that alcoholics\nanonymous is the most successful\nintervention that someone can do that\nwill\nhas the greatest chance of becoming\nhaving someone become sober there are\nall kinds of caveats and problems with\nthat research but there's you can\ndefinitely make the argument\nso a big thing\nthat's kind of bizarre about alcoholics\nanonymous is it starts\nwith the idea that i am powerless\nin the face of my addiction\nand that's weird\nright like you'd think that we'd think\nlike logically that\nyou know if you want to overcome a\nproblem like we want to empower people\nright like we want people to be like um\nyeah like you can do it like you can you\ncan kick this habit like you're in\ncontrol like you can do it\nand so alcoholics anonymous which is\nvery heavily uh founded by in christian\nroots by the way so it's like it's very\nreligious so they believe in like higher\npower and like a lot of christianity\nlike focus themes and stuff like that\nwhich rubs people the wrong way if you\nguys are not really into that refuge\nrecovery is a very good alternative so\nthat's like uh\nhas a lot of like fellowship and\ncommunity it was based more on buddhist\nprinciples\nso this is kind of weird right because\nlike alcoholics anonymous and\nchristianity will sort of say\nthis this is where i'm like i could be\nmisspeaking so apologies if i'm\noffending people but like there's sort\nof this idea that in the abrahamic\nreligions that god is all-powerful and\nlike you are not\nright like that's a common in the\nabrahamic religions is that god can like\ndo whatever they want to but like you as\na human being you don't have all the\npower in the universe which is different\nfrom the karmic religions because the\nkarmic religions actually sort of say\nthe opposite or even say that you are\none with god and you are just as\npowerful as\ndivinity is or you are divine so that's\nkind of different there\nbut since the person is kind of coming\nfrom the tradition of islam and we're\nyou know we'll just use that as an\nexample so like if you kind of think\nabout it how is this sort of like ego\nsublimation like how can this help with\nmental health right\nbecause this is a big part of you know\nreligion is sublimating your ego and\nsort of like teaching you that god is\nall-powerful and you are not and all\nthis kind of good stuff and so\nalcoholics anonymous is a good example\nof this because a big part of the\naddict's brain\nis\ni can handle this\nso when people kind of say this\nright like like when your brain says i\ncan handle the i can handle it i'm in\ncontrol\nit's this kind of thought\nwhich is essentially coming from the ego\nright this is coming from the ahamkara\nor ego\nand this is the thought that gets you in\ntrouble\nso when you adopt like a sublimation of\nthe ego kind of attitude it actually\ndoes seem to help in terms of kicking in\naddiction there's good data for that and\ni suspect that it helps too in terms of\nlike dealing with suffering right\nbecause we know that ego is associated\nwith suffering and so we can sort of see\nhow okay so like if we're sublimating\nthe ego\nyou know we're going to decrease our\nsuffering\nand this may in turn improve mental\nhealth\nthere's also good data behind this as\nwell so if we look at the outcomes of\nmeditative practice which will sort of\nyou know sublimate the ego weaken the\nego and that seems to be correlated with\npeople like being happier because we\nknow that meditation improves mental\nhealth\nokay so that's another mechanism that\nreligion uses and the last mechanism\nthat we're going to talk about is that\nreligion does actually teach us\ndiscipline of the mind\nhopefully\nwe're going to talk about caveats in a\nsecond so if we think about things like\nsaying hail mary's right\nwhat we're literally doing is we're like\nit's a darn technique so it's focusing\nthe mind\nwhen we go to church every sunday we're\nlike sort of disciplining ourselves\nbecause we got to go to church so you\ncould like you can't be a degenerate\nlike you got to get to church you got to\nlike get dressed up and you got to clean\nyourself up and this and that right so\nwhen you pray five times a day\nthat sort of improves your awareness\nlike you can't lose track of time\nbecause you've got to pray five times a\nday so a lot of like religion\nhas baked into it techniques like prayer\nwhich involve like focusing the mind and\nprobably have health benefits as a\nresult\nand so this is where things get a little\nbit so so a lot of religion has actually\nlike stuff kind of baked in that results\nin disciplining of the mind\nso can religion help mental health\nthere's some studies that actually\nsuggest that religion and spirituality\nactually religion can have positive\neffects on mental health there are lots\nof downsides to religion and mental\nhealth as well\nso for example this person is talking a\nlittle bit about guilt\nright so like i don't know where i stand\ni feel ashamed and guilty so religion is\nnot necessarily a blanket or it's not\nneces it's in no way\na blanket positive force for mental\nhealth so there's a lot of like abuse of\npower there's a lot of shame there's a\nlot of guilt there's a lot of betrayal\nof trust there's a lot of like bad\nthings that come out of humility of\nreligion so when we sublimate the ego\ncan that improve uh our suffering and\nmental health yes but sublimation of the\nego also makes us right to be taken\nadvantage of\nright because if i am like if i'm\npowerless in the in the face of whatever\nand there's like there's this this\npriest is all-powerful and he says do\nsomething then i should do that\nright so there are definitely downsides\nwhich can happen with religion\nbut there is some research that suggests\nthat religion can have positive impacts\non mental health and as we start to sort\nof unpack what is it that religion does\nlike what are the mechanisms of religion\nwhat we sort of discover is that i\nhaven't seen anything that suggests that\na particular religion is more correct\nand or sorry more beneficial for mental\nhealth than another religion i'm not an\nexpert in the research by the way\nso i think what we can what i would\nconclude sort of scientifically is that\nit's not a particular religion and\nactually this is also influenced by the\nstudies that i've done because patanjali\nsays this too so he says that you can\nmeditate and all this kind of stuff\nthat's fantastic you can attain\nenlightenment that way but you can also\nattain enlightenment through devotion\nand surrender to god\nand the key thing that patanjali doesn't\nreally explain in a whole lot of detail\nbecause that's not what he talks about\nbut if you if you really like look at\nsome of these yogic texts what they say\nis that it's not the god part that leads\nto enlightenment it's the devotion and\nsurrender part so the god that you\nsurrender to doesn't matter it's not\nlike\nthis god will give you more spiritual\ngrowth than that god now i recognize\nthat that is a\ncontentious statement for a lot of\npeople who insist that their god is the\nbetter god and that's the one that you\nshould surrender to but what potentially\nsort of said is that he's like the\nimportant part is like the sublimation\nof the ego and the devotion to an uh an\nobject\nwhether it's a particular god or it's an\nideal or whatever it's the devotion to\nthe thing that results in the spiritual\ngrowth\nand so what we can kind of see if we\nsort of unpack religion is that there\nare like five things that i think will\ncontribute to people's mental health\nthat religion or religious organizations\nand religions tend to offer right and\nthis is where it's kind of like you do\nyou have to be religious to improve your\nmental health absolutely not but i think\nthe advantage of religion is that it's\nkind of like a combo meal right it's\nlike pre-packaged everything's sort of\nset up for you so you kind of get\nhopefully these things if you go to a\ngood religious place without like having\nto structure them yourself because if\nyou don't want to go that route you're\njust totally fine\nthen what i think it's important to do\nis if you want to get these benefits\nthen you have to structure each of these\nthings yourself\nright so you can go and order the combo\nmeal and you're going to get kind of\neverything you need for one meal it's\ngoing to be packaged right there's ups\nand downs to that\nbut if you if you decide okay so if\nreligion is can be good for my mental\nhealth but like what if i'm not\nreligious does that mean i mean i need\nto become religious i'd say absolutely\nnot you do not need to become religious\nif you are you know not religiously\ninclined then here are the things that\nyou should do\nso first\nis find a trusted source\nso this is where like i think mentorship\nis critical here\nright this can also be like a therapist\nnumber two\nfigure out\nhow the world works\nyou need an organizing framework\nso this is like kind of a tall ask like\nthis is the advantage of of religion\nwhich is like they just tell you they're\nlike hey here's how it works we don't\nhave to believe them you don't have to\ntrust it whatever but if you're not\ngoing to do that then you need to do the\nwork to figure out what is the\norganizing principle or like what are\nthe organizing principles that i'm going\nto use to make sense of like why crap\nhappens is it going to be science\nis it going to be philosophy\nis it going to be spirituality of like a\nparticular tradition\nlike meditation\nright is it going to be like some kind\nof like family cultural kind of thing\nso whatever but you need some kind of\norganizing framework right\nnext thing that you're going to need is\ncommunity\nso if you want to meet people going to\nchurch is a really really easy way to do\nit right they're like people they're\ngenerally speaking they tend to be\npretty nice\nright so it's like a great form of like\nsocial capital and community and stuff\nlike that\nso if you don't have that you're going\nto need to like find a community find\nyour tribe\nnumber four\nis sublimate the ego\nso religion once again does it for you i\nthink sometimes they do it to the\ndetriment to people right when they\nreally browbeat you and\ntreat you with a lot of guilt and shame\ni don't think that that's healthy\npersonally\nso you can also get like ptsd and all\nkinds of self-worth problems from the\nwrong kind of religious interaction\nso this too is hard but i think this you\ncan meditate\nfor lack of a better term\nand then number five is\nonce again meditation and yoga\nso you're going to need to learn like\ndiscipline\nand like you know\npractices and stuff like that which is\ntricky\nbut you know this is your substitute to\nreligion and i think what's starting to\nhappen part of the reason that we're\nseeing a decline in religion\nis because the things that religion\nbasically used to be only one that did\nthis stuff right so like a thousand\nyears ago like\nscience wasn't that well developed like\nthey couldn't really give us answers\nabout how the world works\num our our community and our tribe was\nlike tangled up with our religion\nthe way that we learned discipline and\nthe way that we learned to sublimate the\nego were like basically all that existed\nwas the combo meal because we just sort\nof had we just didn't have options\nand now as we're starting to learn more\nabout meditation as we're starting to\nlearn more about community and science\nand things like that you don't need to\ngo to a religion to get the mental\nbenefits of religion anymore\nnow this once again is going to be a\nbias view because i'm sure there are\ngoing to be people out there who will\nsay that my religion by virtue of what\nit is offers a significant benefit so\nspecifically like people will say like\nyou know believing in allah\nlike will help your depression that's\nwhat this person's dad says\nthey're going to say that this is\ndifferent from believing in jesus that\nallah has an effect that jesus does not\nhave\nright so like that that's where some\npeople will say believing in jesus is\ngoing to have an effect\neven hindus will say that but i don't\nreally think that's what the hindu\nreligion says\num to the hindu religion part of what i\nlike about it is that they're sort of\nlike you can be atheistic and you can be\nhindu you can be agnostic and you can be\nhindu\nit's a little bit more in my mind and\nthis could be where my bias is i really\ndon't think so but if you really look at\nit objectively like if you look at the\nreligious texts of hinduism\nthe oldest religious texts are 25 music\ntheory\n25\nmedicine\n25 rituals\nand 25 creation myths\nand so you also have people like\npatanjali are like you can believe in\ngod or like not believe in god\nso\neven the concept of hinduism is a\nreligion is sort of like false\nlike that idea of religion even the word\nreligion is like a judeo-christian\nconcept\nwhen people ask\nare you hindu like the r-u-a religion is\nlike a judeo-christian concept right\nbecause the abrahamic religions were the\nones who sort of said there's like us\nand not us there's like the people of\nisrael and there's like the not people\nof israel they're like the ones who\nbelieve in christ and like the ones who\ndon't believe in christ there's like you\nknow the infidels and the non-infidels\nso that fundamental idea of owning to a\nreligion converting to a religion\nbelieving in a religion that's actually\nsort of like a western concept because\nit's like how do you convert to buddhism\nlike you don't really can i mean sure\nyou can someone somewhere out there will\nconvert you to buddhism if you want to\nthey're going to be sex that will\nconvert people but it's not really like\nbuddha didn't\nyou know start like he wasn't saying\nlike you should believe what i say like\nyou that's he was just teaching stuff so\nthe karmic religions are quite different\nin that way and that they they're sort\nof just a collection of information and\nwhat the karmic religions did they\ndidn't separate out spirituality from\nthe other things it's just like if you\ngo to university you can major in\nreligion and you can major in\nmathematics it's no different it's not\nlike spirituality is like a different\nthing\nfrom science they're actually all\ntangled together they're just different\nsources of knowledge\nand so if you look at for example karma\nlike karma is just the principle of\ncause and fact in effect which is like\nyou know has physics applications and\nhas like non-physics applications\num which is why you know you have music\ntheory and medicine which are part of\nthe holy books because that's like the\nidea of a holy book is also like alien\nto hinduism there's like no such thing\nas a holy book there's no bible in\nhinduism there's like all kinds of texts\nand you can sort of believe which one\nyou want\nso it's a little bit more in my opinion\nscientific but that that's probably\ngoing to piss a lot of people off\nbecause the idea that i say my religion\nis more scientific than your religion is\nlike seeing you know as like a easy way\nto piss people off but i really do think\nthat you know i i i haven't seen any you\nknow prescriptions for\nmalaria in the bible whereas you'll see\nthat in indian or hindu religious texts\nright\nyeah so this is the other thing is so\nhexahorn is saying religious religion\nequal scientific so in in the west we\nview those things as like\ncontrary right we think of like religion\nand science is like being on opposite\nends of the spectrum\nbut especially in the eastern religions\nlike if you read patanjali it's like\nquite scientific like it's critical so\nit also encourages you like\nbrahma sutra for example is like a text\nthat will teach you logic and will teach\nyou how to poke holes in arguments so\nit's like a text on logic which is\ngenerally considered like a religious\ntext by people in the west but in the\neast it's just it's just\nthey just taught everything\nso when you go to when you went to like\nif you became like a monk for example\nyou had to learn medicine\nlike it was all part of the same\neducation so like all religious leaders\nlike were doctors and were trained in\nsurgery for example i mean that may not\nbe fair to say when i'm saying all\nbecause i wasn't there\nbut it's just different\nright so\nso in\nin short you know can religion have\npositive effects on mental health i\nthink absolutely there's even data to\nsupport that and at the same time it's\nnot like religion is the only source of\nthose kinds of things and if we start to\nanalyze a little bit about okay how does\nreligion improve our mental health what\nwe end up with is essentially five\nfactors right so there's a trusted safe\nspace which seems to be very very\nimportant and from uh studies of\npsychotherapy we sort of discover that\nthis is a key part of like\npositive mental health outcomes\nwe also need an organizing framework so\nwhether it's dbt or cbt or psychodynamic\ntherapy or psychoanalysis it doesn't\nreally matter whether it's a hindu\nworldview or the christian worldview or\nwhatever you just need a worldview that\nis internally consistent and can handle\nwhatever life throws at you\nthe other big thing about religion is\nit's a major source of social capital\nand community which has very positive\neffects on mental health\nthe last two things these are a little\nbit more kind of my opinion there's less\nresearch to suggest this but based on\nwhat i've seen you know sublimation of\nthe ego is a big common theme amongst\nreligions which leads to positive mental\nhealth outcomes it's not necessarily\nthat you need to\ngo to religion to do these things but\nthat seems to be a big part of it based\non my study and the last thing is that\nit seems to be a pretty systematic way\nto discipline the mind which is very\nvery good for your your mental health\nand so if you you know can religion be\ngood for your mental health absolutely\ni think the closer that religions stay\nto these five points the more positive\nthey're going to be for your mental\nhealth can they be bad for your mental\nhealth absolutely right so we can\nthere's a dark side to sublimating the\nego which is that people may take\nadvantage of you there's a dark side to\ndisciplining the mind which is that some\nof those practices may border on abusive\nor not even border on abusive\nthere's a dark side to this which is\nthat you know so community and social\ncapital can lead to things like shunning\nright and ostracization if you start to\nlike and so suddenly that the community\ninstead of being a positive impact on\nyour mental health starts to become a\nnegative impact and emotionally damaging\nto you\nand the last thing is that you
