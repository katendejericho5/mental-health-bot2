    "transcript": "right so as you\nlike let go of that stuff and you start\nfocusing on yourself like as you start\nlike just allowing yourself to be this\nhuman that you are\ninstead of failing to be that what you\nwant to be people find that attractive\nthat's the huge paradox\nall right so posted by machine gun\nwizardry\ni believe i'm going to be a virgin for\nlife because i'm ugly\nevery insult says this but i think i'm\nthe exception and it's true\ni know how egoistic and pitiful that\nsentence reads at first glance but i\nthink it's true i have a lazy eye and a\ncrooked nose i was born with it and\nwithout success i have never been able\nto get past a first date\ni'm 26 and every year i lose hope more\nand more i know there's things i could\ndo to improve my chances i'm overweight\n5 11 and 273 pounds but i can't find the\nmotivation to do it because i don't\nthink it would make a difference\ni know dr k talks frequently about how\nin cell mindset is a delusion but most\nof the people he talks to aren't as ugly\nas they believe they are i'm\nconventionally ugly\ni'm deformed and i don't ever feel any\nattraction from women i'm around and\nbeen friends with\nbesides even if i did magically wake up\ntomorrow a new man with a new face i'm\nso broken from years of rejection and so\nromantically stunted from years of no\nsuccess that even if i could i'd be so\nbehind i wouldn't know what to do\nor read body language\ni'm always just going to be the 26 plus\nyear old virgin if i even if i did get\nlaid i'm branded\nbeing so late to the game makes me feel\nlike i'm branded a virgin loser for life\ni usually don't think about it but\nlately it's been rough i've been\nthinking about suicide here and there\nand sometimes i feel close to it but i\ndon't want to live my whole life alone\ni'm not looking for advice i just need\nto vent because i can't talk to any of\nmy friends and i don't want them to see\nhow much of a depressed loser i am\ni rather have been born looking\nliterally like anyone else than this\nthanks for reading and i hope you all\nhad a lovely new year\nokay\nso let's upvote this\nall right\nso\nsometimes when people feel like they're\ngoing to be alone forever they feel like\nthey're ugly\nor they feel like objectively\num\nthey have like no shot\nright and they can even acknowledge that\nif i got into shape\nif i changed my mindset\nlike all that stuff like i understand\nthat technically that improves my\nchances but i'm so far beyond\nhelp\nthat objectively i'm screwed\nand the truth is like\ni know it's going to sound kind of\nbizarre but i'm inclined to agree with\nthat person right so this is where\nwe have to be kind of careful here for a\nsecond so what some people may say\nin response to this is you're entitled\nto your feelings right you're entitled\nto feel that way like it's okay to feel\nlike you're screwed\nand i want you all to think a little bit\nfor a second\nif i were to respond to this person and\nsay you're entitled to your feelings is\nthat validating or invalidating\nwhat does that actually mean\nwhat do you all think\nif i were to tell this person you're\ninvalid you're valid you're entitled to\nyour feelings\nright what are we actually telling this\nperson what's the signal that we send to\nthis person we say you're entitled to\nyour feelings\nso it's kind of tricky because for a lot\nof people if you say you're entitled to\nyour feelings what you're sort of\ntelling them is like it's just all in\nyour head right these are just your\nfeelings it's not real\nit's just like all in your head like oh\nit's like oh you feel hurt oh you're\nlike it's valid that you feel hurt\ndoesn't mean that you are hurt\nbut you're allowed to feel that way\nso there's something really interesting\ngoing on which is that i've noticed that\npeople are starting to use\nthe language of entitlement to feelings\nas a way to invalidate people's\nexperiences\nright it's kind of weird\nso let's just try to so we're going to\ntry i know it's kind of weird but it but\ni'm sort of inclined to kind of agree\nwith this person now i don't think that\nthey're hopeless but i agree with a lot\nof their premises\nand if you if you are someone who\nfeels objectively like you understand\nthat mindset works for under peop other\npeople like you understand that like any\none of these things can improve your\nchances but you still feel hopeless i\ndon't think you're actually wrong\nand at the same time i don't think\nthings are quite as hopeless i think the\nsituation is as you describe it\nand i do not agree with your conclusion\ni'll agree with your premise because in\na lot of these situations what people\nwill do is they'll like dispute the\npremise oh it's like actually not that\nbad and we kind of see this it in this\npost as well where he kind of says\nyou know\num i know dr k talks frequently about\nhow the incel mindset is is a delusion\nso i wouldn't start by saying that this\nperson is delusional right i don't think\nthey're actually delusional i think that\ntheir conclusions are incorrect\nbut like who am i to say that this\nperson is delusional right like i don't\nknow what this person looks like i don't\nknow what this person's experiences have\nbeen\nso let's just try to understand like\nwhat is going on with this person and\nwhat we can do about it\nso the first thing is this person says\nthat i'm 26\nokay\nno sexual experience\nmissed the boat\nright spawned too late\nlate to the party\nthings got patched and i wasn't able to\nget the fat loots from the exploit\nokay\nso they're lack motivation\nokay\nthey have a lazy eye\nthey have a crooked nose\nlike they're pointing out too like\nlegitimate physical what we call\ndeformities their word\nthat most people don't have right these\nare things that are like minus one\npenalty to dating like that's like a\npretty like legitimate concern\noverweight\nright we don't really know much about\nuh you know their professional standing\neducation things like that maybe they're\nrich maybe they're poor we don't know\nanything about that so let's steer clear\nof that stuff\nand then the last thing is that they\nfeel so broken\nright\nthey like they've been rejected so much\nthat even if they could fix all of these\nother things that like this sense of\nbrokenness and the sense of rejection is\ntoo hard to fix\nnow let's try to understand this\nperson's mindset so what they're kind of\nsaying is like i'm screwed so this\nresults in\ni'm screwed\nand now i'm gonna ask y'all like let's\nbe a little bit honest here for a second\nlike\nyou know how screwed is this person like\nit doesn't look\noptimistic right they've got a lot of\nstuff going against them they don't know\nhow to read body language they have no\nexperience they've got a crooked nose\nthey're overweight they have lazy eye\nthey lack the motivation to like help\nthemselves\nso it's like natural like i think it's\nnot stupid to arrive at this conclusion\ni disagree with it i think there's a lot\nthat you can do\nbut let's start by like at least\nacknowledging that this isn't just your\nfeelings like this person objectively\nhas the deck sacked against them like\ncan we kind of\nacknowledge that for a moment\nso now now here's the problem\nis that when you are this screwed\nour brain\nwhen it's trying to determine so like\nlet's talk about motivation so like\npeople are saying okay like this person\nshould be you know should start working\nout start doing this and start doing\nthis then you can get better you can get\nbetter right there's a lot of solutions\nthat people will offer\ngo to the gym\nyou can fix that\nright go to a therapist\nyou can fix that\ngo do coaching if there's no illness\nlike right so you can like do coaching\nand understand about yourself and like\nget motivated and all that kind of crap\nright but all these solutions\ni would even toss a couple of others on\nthere so there's like surgery you can do\nfor lazy eyes\ndepends on what's causing the lazy eye\nyou know\nthere's also surgery you can do for\ncrooked noses\nright it's it's possible i'm not\nnecessarily saying you should do it i'm\nnot recommending it\nbut there's a lot you know there's a lot\nthat you could do\nso why is this person lacking motivation\nif there are so many different things\nthat they can do\nright so that that's a common experience\nsometimes like\nso so let's talk about this for a second\nso the more things you can do to improve\nyour life\nthe more overwhelmed you are the more\nsolutions you have so people think that\nyou're hopeless because you lack\nsolutions\nbut the truth is that the most hopeless\npeople have the most solutions\nthere's like way too much stuff to do\nit's not actually that you're hopeless\nbecause you lack solutions it's because\nyou're hopeless because you're\noverwhelmed and then you're like get\ninto the procrastination mode you guys\nget this the closest thing to this\nperson's psychology is someone who's a\nchronic procrastinator\nbecause there's a lot that they can do\nbut it's just too much to handle\nand so they're almost like i want you\nall to think about this as like a\nprocrastination problem as opposed to\nlike a no solutions problem because\nthere's actually tons of solutions\nyou can like\nyou know read books about dating you can\nwork on your self-confidence you can\nlike you know focus on yourself\nyou can become confident work on your\nconfidence\nright like you can these are all the\nthings that you can do but why don't you\ndo them it's because there's it's too\noverwhelming\nnow let's try to understand what what\ndoes that mean overwhelming like how\ndoes that work in our brain so our brain\nis very good at making calculations and\nit's like really good at figuring out\nwhat is worth doing and what is not\nworth doing\nright so like i'm not going to go\noutside and like hunt for ducks\nbecause my brain knows that my\nlikelihood of finding being able to hunt\nfor a duck is pretty low i don't know\nhow to do that so i'm not going to go\nengage in that behavior\nour brain is very good at figuring out\nwhat we can accomplish and what we can't\naccomplish so let's understand what's\ngoing on in the brain of this person\nso if we say go get surgery\nbut what about all these things\nright like\nthis is left undone this is left undone\nthis is left undone this is left undone\nand this is left undone therefore\nsurgery is not gonna fix my problem\ntherefore i'm not gonna do it\nokay but like what about my getting\ngoing to the gym\nyeah like even if i did that this is not\ngonna get done this is not gonna get\ndone this is not gonna get done and this\nis not gonna get done so it's like this\nis gonna be insufficient to fix my\nproblem\nso i'm not gonna do it\ni feel broken and rejected okay go to\ntherapy\nokay sure like if i go to therapy and i\nfeel less broken and rejected like i'm\nstill gonna have the lazy eye i'm still\ngonna have the crooked nose i'm still\ngonna be fat it's not going to be enough\nso i'm not going to do it\nright\nlike and even if i like\nhave like if i get surgery and i lose\nweight and stuff like that i'm still\ngoing to have no sexual i'm going to be\na 26 year old virgin like nothing is\ngoing to change that\nand so the reason we feel overwhelmed is\nbecause any step we take is not enough\nright and i want you guys to think about\nwhen you're procrastinating for finals\nit's like when you've got so much stuff\nto do i know i'm actually personally\nexperiencing this now where i feel\nparalyzed because i have so much crap to\ndo like i've noticed this in a way that\ni haven't noticed in a very long time\nwhere it's like there's just so much to\ni don't even know where to get started\nand when you don't know where to get\nstarted you can't do anything\nand if you can't do anything you stay\nstuck\nright and then we procrastinate then we\ngo back to our coping mechanism okay so\nlike this is too much so what am i gonna\ndo\nplay games\npornography\nhere we go\ni'm gonna advance the clock\nright\ni'm gonna advance the clock i can get an\nrpg i'm going to wait 24 hours but like\nyour situation is still the same\nso how do you deal with this\nright and i think the answer is is kind\nof interesting and it's it's old stuff\nthat people say that they say things\nlike focus on yourself and and you know\nfocus on your confidence and things like\nthat which i think is the answer\nbut\nit's not i can can't just tell you just\nfocus on like what does that mean\npractically like what's going to go on\nin your brain practically if i tell you\nto focus on yourself\nright\nso i'm going to kind of tell you all a\nstory\nso when i\nstarted residency i got married my first\nyear at like towards the end of my first\nyear of medical school\nso when i was like\nwhen i started residency so i'm a doctor\ni'm working in a hospital\nand i kind of noticed something weird so\nwhen i was growing up like i didn't get\nany female attention\nin college i tried to get some female\nattention and it went horribly\nand then like you know even in my middle\nyears like i i had a girlfriend who was\nawesome and stuff and that was great\num\nbut like kind of the couple years before\nmedical school it wasn't like i was\ngetting you know i wasn't like talking\nto girls or girls didn't seem that\ninterested in me\nand then\nyou know i got married\nand then during med school then like i\ndidn't have to worry about any of that\ncrap anymore and so i got married and i\nlike had this woman that i loved and we\nwere happy and so like i started you\nknow doing things just like for the sake\nof doing them like i wasn't worried\nabout any of that other crap i wasn't\ntrying to look for a girlfriend i wasn't\nflirting so like if i met a girl\nlike in school\nlike i didn't care if she was pretty i\ndidn't care if she was ugly i didn't\ncare if she was single i didn't care\nlike about any of that crap\nlike i don't care like it's just like\ni'm gonna interact with this person\nbased on the circumstances of our\ninteraction\nand then something like magical happened\ni started becoming like a warm and\npleasant human being\nand then i go to the hospital and then\nthere's like a lot of people at the\nhospital right and so i'm like\ninteracting with people and i tend to be\nlike kind of warm and funny and upbeat\nand stuff like that and then like i kind\nof noticed i started getting like female\nattention\nand i was kind of confused by that\nbecause i had never had really female\nattention before\nyou know i i still think to this day\nthat\nyou know the girlfriend thing and the\nwife thing was that was a fluke like it\nwas just like a one-off\nright i don't think i i mean i guess i\ndid some things good but\nand so then i started to realize like oh\nlike why is this happening and it's just\nlike i'm allowing myself to you know be\nmy best self like i'm just being my best\nself\nand i'm not worried about dating anyone\ni'm not worried about getting into\nanyone's pants so i'm just like you know\nif i see someone and i like someone's\nshirt like i can compliment like a nurse\non her shirt i'd be like that shirt\nlooks i mean you don't do that it's a\nstupid example cause they all wear\nscrubs\nbut you know you can just compliment\nsomeone you can say hey like you know\nlooks like you got a haircut looks\nfantastic you can say that\nyou're just like you just be a nice\nhuman being\nand as you start being a nice human\nbeing and you get the [ __ ] out of your\nown head\nbecause that's an important part right\nlike you start attending to other people\nlike you start to come across as\nconfident\nand then i'm also focusing on yourself\nso i'm like trying to you know exercise\nand like you know i'm just like trying\nto be a decent human being all on all on\nmy own\nand the funny thing is that by focusing\non yourself by focusing on being a\ndecent human being\nand not worrying about\ndating anyone\ni was like\nfound a ridiculous amount of like female\nattention which i had never experienced\nbefore and then i was confused and i was\nlike this is because i'm a doctor\nbecause the doctor probably has\nsomething to do with it but it's a\ncommon myth that just because you become\na doctor does not mean that like the\nopposite sex will start drooling all\nover you or the same sex if you're\nthat's your thing\nsure it's kind of attractive but it's\nnot gonna fix all this other crap\nand so then like the problem here is\nthat you're going to be stuck\nas long as you're trying to like\nyou know\nget with someone\nso if your goal is this\nnone of these steps will be sufficient\nand then your brain will tell you\nthere's no point in trying because\ngetting with someone\noh let's see if that\nshows up\nso getting with someone like is too big\nof a problem to solve and since that's\nthe problem you're trying to solve\nyour motivation is gonna completely\ndisappear because nothing you do will be\nenough because i agree with your premise\nand so the paradox here is that like\nthis is what keeps you stuck\nso this is where also like if you're\nprocrastinating like you can't solve you\ncan't fix it all at once\nso the only way forward is to stop\ntrying to fix it\nand this is where things get a little\nbit tricky because\nstop trying to fix it can mean one of\ntwo things it can mean becoming hopeless\nor it can mean changing your goal\nso forget about everything else and just\nfocus on this\nright like are you happy with the way\nthat your body is like forget about\nwomen forget about sexual attraction\nforget about dating forget about\neverything else are you internally happy\nwith this\nis this something you are happy with\nand if the answer is no\nchange it\nright let the outcome be something that\nis like absolutely much more close to\nwhat you can do\nor even like let go of the outcome\ncompletely which i'm not sure that this\nperson can do\nbut like understand that this is not the\ngoal over here like this is the goal\nright if you like if you have a lazy eye\nlike there may be medication that you\ncan get or there may be surgery you can\ndo like you may be able to do that if\nyou have a difficulty with driving i\ndon't know where what part of the world\nyou live in but like generally speaking\nyou know people will do things like you\ncan get those kinds of surgeries and\nthey'll be covered\nif you've got double vision and you\ndrive or like there are all kinds of\ndifferent things\nif you're feeling you know you're\nworried about being broken and rejected\nlike you can go to therapy just because\nyou don't want to feel broken anymore\nlike it has nothing to do with women it\nhas nothing to do with being alone and\nthis is the biggest problem that this is\nhow we shoot ourselves in the foot is we\ntry to set a goal\nor we don't try we end up setting a goal\nfor ourself\nthat involves so many different\nvariables that we create an unsolvable\nproblem\nand when faced with an unsolvable\nproblem we feel overwhelmed we feel we\nprocrastinate we feel no motivation\nand then we end up not solving our\nunsolvable problem which is not a\ndelusion\nlike this person isn't delusional like\nthey're smart they're like not an idiot\nright they've like accurately\nconcluded they've like figured this out\nnow the problem is you can say but okay\ndr k if i start working on myself is\nthat the way that you i end up with\nsomeone who's i say yes that's the way\nyou end up with someone\nbut the problem is if that is your\ntarget in your mind literally the\nequation in your mind will not let you\nengage in it\nit cannot be the outcome that you're\nchasing\nbecause if you chase that outcome\nnothing will be sufficient it'll never\nbe sufficient\nand so when people say focus on yourself\nlike how do you do that i know it's kind\nof weird but what you do is you give up\non it sure give up on finding someone i\nsure as well know that i did\nand that when i met my girlfriend is\nbizarre\nbut giving up on it doesn't mean suicide\ngiving up on it means finding a\ndifferent goal just let go that goal\nright grieve it\nso when you're when you're faced with an\nunsolvable situation you've got two\noptions\nhopelessness and grief\nand what you need to do is grieve it say\nsucks for me i will be alone for the\nrest of my life so be it\nthen the question becomes what can i do\nin this life that will give me some\nshred of happiness what can i take some\npride in\nwhat can i do for myself that'll like do\nsomething for me\nlike i don't know maybe five years from\nnow i'm gonna commit suicide but\npeople are gonna be able to lift the\ncasket\nbecause i ain't gonna be overweight when\nthey put me in the ground\nright like i know it's kind of morbid\nbut i'm serious like there are things\nthat you can take pride in in this life\nright even if you're single like there\nare things that you can do you could try\nto be a better human being for other\npeople\nyou can\nfeel less broken you can like be happy\nwith what you see when you look in the\nmirror\nlike even if you're broken on the inside\nyou can take pride in what you see when\nyou look in the mirror every day and\nthat could be that could mean surgery\nfor your nose it could mean losing\nweight even if you're unhappy with what\nyou see when you look in the mirror you\ncan be happy with what your body is\ncapable of when you jump into the ocean\nthat you can swim for a long amount of\ntime you can feel\namazing for climbing to the top of a\nmountain there's absolutely all kinds of\nstuff you can do\nand the big paradox here\nis that as you start doing those things\nthis becomes more likely\nbut this is the really tricky thing is\nthat we can't we're not going to win\nthis game with our mind like we're\nreally not the mind will win all the\ntime\nso if you keep that as your goal so it's\nkind of weird but i'd say like very\npractically\nwhen there are too many things that you\nhave to do\nto accomplish something\nthe mind has a lot of difficulty with\nmotivation and it's just going to feel\noverwhelmed and procrastinate\nand you're not wrong\nin believing that things feel very very\nfar away and so that's why i would say\nthat like you know i agree with you that\nit's almost reasonable to be hopeless\nand so this what i'd say is like let go\nof it right let go of hope\ndoesn't mean you have to be despair\nbut you can let go of rope you could\njust set that whole thing aside\nand you can try to think about okay like\nis my life defined by this one thing\nbecause if it is then i can understand\nwhy people feel suicidal\nbut the truth is there's more to life\nthan relationships there just is more to\nlife than relationships\nright if if all life was was\nrelationships everyone who is in a\nrelationship would be perfectly happy\nbut people aren't perfectly happy\nwe've seen posts today about you know\npeople being unhappy at work people\nbeing unfulfilled people not\nfollowing their creative pursuits\npeople being unsatisfied with how you\nknow what their mmr is on an online\nvideo game there are all kinds of things\nin life\nand so if if\nrelationships are too hard to solve then\nlet it go\nand start fixing the other stuff\nand when you're ready a relationship\nwill come you'll be surprised like\nliterally it'll come to you\nyou need to stop chasing it\nbecause it's that chasing that sort of\nlike makes you come across as like\ndesperate\nthat is like unattractive to people in\nthe first place\nright so as you\nlike let go of that stuff and you start\nfocusing on yourself like as you start\nlike just allowing yourself to be this\nhuman that you are\ninstead of failing to be that what you\nwant to be people find that attractive\nthat's the huge paradox\nis that if i try to be something else\nby definition i'm gonna be insufficient\nbecause i'm not there yet\nand that gap that i feel about myself is\ngonna be something that other people\npick up on and as i let go of that thing\nand i allow myself to be what i am i\nembrace who i am you can still work\ntowards things by all means but you can\nstart to say to yourself you know what\ntired of being 273 pounds and 5 11.\nso i'm going to go to the gym i'm not\ngoing to try to pick up chicks\ni'm not doing it for them because if\nyou're doing it for them and it doesn't\nwork out the first time that you expend\neffort and it doesn't you've lost 10\npounds there's a cute girl at the gym\nyou ask her out she says no or you don't\neven ask her out because this person\nwouldn't even ask around they'd talk to\nher\nbut then they'd find that oh like now\nshe's talking to some guy who's more fit\nthan i am suddenly your motivation is\nthe girl and you're not gonna work out\nbecause you've lost 10 pounds and like\nscrew it she's talking to this other guy\nso gigi i'm\nleaving your motivation is going to\ndisappear you are letting your\nmotivation be determined by the outcomes\nand whims of another human being\nlike\nthat's\nthat's screwed\nright so like\nwhy do that\nbecause i don't want to be alone\nwell\nwith love too bad you are right now\nand so like learn how to be alone it's\nanother huge thing\npeople don't really understand that like\na big part of being in a healthy\nrelationship is learning how to be alone\nright you have to be like comfortable\nlike if you want to be in a really\nhealthy relationship you need to be like\ncomfortable and\nhappy with yourself\nbecause like a relationship\nmakes things harder not easier like like\nthe more grounded you are\nthe easier things are going to be\nnot the harder things are going to be\nanyway\nso you know if you fall into the\ncategory of feeling that\nany relationship you're just too far\ngone in too many dimensions like i know\nit sounds kind of weird but like\nyou may be\nand yet that doesn't mean that you have\nto be hopeless\nright because at the end of the day like\njust because your logical analysis is\ncorrect doesn't mean that your\nconclusion has to be that conclusion\nthere's another route and if you feel\nlike unmotivated because there are too\nmany dimensions of your life and you\ndon't know where to start like that's\nalso like completely normal i'm not just\nsaying like your feelings are valid like\nas if you know your analysis is\nincorrect and your feelings are all\ncoloring your analysis and you're\nactually an idiot but you're entitled to\nyour feelings so\nyou know like no like i think your\nfeelings are valid and also your like\nlogical analysis is valid but i don't\nthink it's the complete story\nand as you start reframing away from\nthat goal which makes any mo any effort\nuseless so if any effort is useless you\nare not going to be motivated towards\nanything\nso you have to start making your effort\nmean something and how do you ever make\nyour effort mean something you let go of\nthat goal you grieve it you're going to\nbe alone for the rest of your life but\nyou know what this world has more to\noffer than relationships\nthis is where you say but what can i\ntruly be happy without it i don't know\nbut neither do you because you haven't\ntried to be happy without a relationship\nall you've been caught up in is\nrelationship relationship relationships\nso who the [ __ ] knows\nso by all means\ngive up hope on the relationship but\ndon't give up hope on life\nand start working on what you can work\non\nlet your goals be small let your goals\nbe insufficient to accomplish that that\ngreat great\nmonumental task that is too far out of\nyour reach just let go of it\ndon't try to climb a mountain\ntry to climb one step up\nright because if you're looking to the\ntop of a mountain i take one step\nforward it's like\nliterally it looks exactly the same\neven though technically i'm one step\ncloser it is looks the view is exactly\nthe same you guys could try this\ngo look at a mountain and then take one\nstep towards it and then one step back\ndoes the view of the mountain change no\nit doesn't change at all\nand this is the the big scam of the mind\nis that the mind is like so focused on\nthe outcome because that's what you're\nfocused on it's going to destroy your\nmotivation and keep you stuck where you\nare\nso let go of the goal\nand start focusing on yourself like\nliterally like that's the advice right\nthat's what people say people don't know\nhow to do that but this is why you have\nto focus on yourself you can't can't if\nyou focus on that you're never going to\nachieve it\nbut there's something you can do for\nyourself there's something you can take\npride in\nfind out what that thing is and move\ntowards it\nand you'll be surprised where you end up\nbut no guarantees\nyou"
