    "transcript": "can you guys believe that this account\nis a throwaway that was made in the\n1700s\nwow so i forgot how to socialize titled\npretty much says it all the most\ni usually do in a friendly conversation\nis an occasional quip and most of the\ntime i sit on the sidelines watching\neveryone else do what they do\nmy brain simply goes blank when i have\nto consider how to express myself\ni don't even know what chatting with\npeople means i'm on the spectrum so it's\nprobably some innate some parts innate\ndisadvantage in some parts in experience\nfrom what i could gather i have some\nsort of fear of getting in other\npeople's way or not having anything to\ncontribute or otherwise cannot tell how\nthey will react\nthere's also this sense of feeling like\nthey will have to accommodate me in my\nstrangeness as well as that of having\nrest some resting [ __ ] face and a\ntendency to glare\ni do find as long as all parties have\nsome well-defined role in the\ninteraction eg cashier or customer and\nin fact have some semblance of willpower\nwhen troubling other people is not a\nsignificant risk\nhonestly speaking i don't know where to\nbegin from here aside from tackling it\nhead-on by forcing myself into random\nconversations wherever i feel like it\nthere should be some way to at least\nmake that process less jarring\nso porn throwaway i certainly hope we\ncan make this process less jarring from\nyou for you\nso what we're going to do\nin order to make it instead of just\nsaying forcing yourself into random\nconversations\nwe're going to start by understanding\nwhy it's difficult for you to socialize\nunderstand what's going on in your brain\nthat makes it come up with a blank\nbecause here's the problem right like\nwhen you try to socialize\nyour brain draws a blink\nand so it becomes really really hard to\nsocialize if your brain is drawing a\nblank so let's start by understanding\nhow does your brain draw blank where\ndoes that blank come from why is it\ncoming up link and if we can understand\nhow it draws a blank and then we can\nunderstand how to change that so it no\nlonger comes up blank then the process\nshould be a lot easier for you and you\nwon't have to force yourself into stuff\nokay\nso let's start by understanding a little\nbit about how brains draw blinks\nso\nwhen i set a task\nmy brain tends to come up with how to\naccomplish it right so if i say\nman i'm really thirsty i don't need to\nsay that i think i'm really thirsty and\nthen my brain is like oh there's a water\ncup here\nproblem solved right so our brain when\nwe set a task\nour brain will operationalize that task\nso the term opera opera\noperate\noperationalizing\nis the process of breaking apart\none large task into its individual\ncomponents it's the execution component\nokay\nso\ni'll give you all an example so if i you\nknow i have a six-year-old and a\nfour-year-old and their brain's ability\nto operationalize tasks is like\ndifferent so i can tell my six-year-old\ngo pack a bag for the weekend and she\ncan like take that complex task\nand if i tell her what like if i give\nher the goal her brain will tell her\nwhat to do so the brain is like okay i\nhave to go get clothing i have to go\ngrab my toothbrush i need to go get\nsomething to read i need to go get this\ni need to get toys so the brain will\nlike execute and won't come up blank\nif i tell my four-year-old go pack a bag\nfor the weekend her brain is gonna be\nlike\ni don't know what that is like\nif i break it down for her she can\nunderstand it\nbut she can't operationalize the task\nshe can't like break it apart okay\nso if you're drawing a blank in\nin social situations the problem is that\nthe goal that you have your brain\ndoesn't know how to get there\nwhich in turn leaves two solutions one\nis we can try to operationalize towards\nthe goal or or\nwhat i think is going to be simpler\nis we can change the goal in our mind so\nthat the brain can follow suit with like\nwhat it's supposed to do\nokay\nso for example\nhumanity in general is becoming less\nable to operationalize so if we look at\nsociety and especially how our brain\nfunctions\nmore stuff is being done for us so this\nis absolutely true for gamers so if you\nlook at video games they're very good at\nlike close-ended problem solving\nso the game will give you the goal and\nwill give you the pieces for the goal\nand will allow you to assemble them to\nget there so a good example of this is a\npuzzle in a video game a puzzle in a\nvideo game has a set solution and all\nthe pieces are given to you you just\nhave to like put them together in the\nright way\nthe problem is that like so games will\nalso give you like you know like markers\nright so they'll be like okay go here\nand talk to this person first then go\nthere and talk to their it like lays\neverything out for you you never have to\nfigure out what to do\nwhereas like if you look at life it's\nlike\nhow many jobs should i apply for like\nhow many applications should i figure\nout i don't know\nlike in an mmo it's like fill out 10\napplications like go deliver these 10\napplications these 10 people like go do\nthis fetch quest it breaks everything\napart for you and it's not just games\nright it's also things like technology\nso\nyou know when i log into netflix or i\nload up youtube like i don't even have\nto figure out what to watch\nlike youtube will tell me what to watch\nit'll be like hey what do you feel like\nright now here's this list of choices\nwhat do you want to learn about today\ni don't have to like decide for myself\nwhat i want to learn about i'm just\ngoing to log into reddit or i'm going to\nlog into youtube and it's going to do\nall that work for me\nso the process of like\nbreaking apart a problem and doing\nopen-ended problem solving like if i'm\ntrying to figure out what to major in\neven that is like narrow right because\nthe college provides me with majors\non a broader level it's like what do i\ndo with my life like no one knows how to\nanswer that question because as a\nsociety we are having things broken down\ninto choices for us it's all multiple\nchoice there's no like free answer\nanymore right it's like what are you\ngoing to major in are you going to go\ninto college or you can go to trade\nschool you're going to do this you\nbecome a crypto bro like what are you\ndoing\nso as our brain\nhas had to do less abstract open-ended\nproblem solving because literally most\nof the time it is like\nbeing prompted to react to stuff\nlike these kinds of things happen where\nour brain doesn't know like what am i\nsupposed to do in a social interaction\nit's like what what are what are the\ngoals of the social interaction like i'm\nconfused like where's the quest marker\nwhat am i supposed to do like i need\nsomeone to explain this to me and we can\neven see that this person clearly is\nthis way because look look at this\ni do find as\nas long as all parties have some\nwell-defined role in the interaction the\nquest has been given to me\nyour quest is to go and purchase a bell\npepper very good i can do that i know\nwhat the goal is i know exactly how to\ninteract i'm going to go and present\nthem to the hand the cashier the bell\npepper\nthey will ring up the bell pepper i\nshall pull out the wallet\ni shall give them the money i shall take\nthe bell pepper i shall say thank you i\nshall smile and i shall move on with my\nday success quest completed gain 300 xp\nso we can see that this person does fine\nas long as there are bounds to the\nconversation\nright but i don't even know what\nchatting\nwhat chatting with people means\nit's like so this is a situation where\nwe have forgotten how to socialize\nbecause chatting is a sandbox game it's\nlike what's the point there's no quest\nmarker like i don't understand\nchatting is a sandbox game\nlike what's the point there isn't a\npoint and now your brain gets super\nconfused it's like how do i how do i\noperationalize how do i get from point a\nto point z and there there is no point z\nthere's just like i don't understand\nwhere i'm supposed to go and then the\nbrain draws up blank\ndoesn't mean you're dumb or anything on\nthe contrary it's it's a it's a huge\nproblem where people are like forgetting\nhow to socially interact because we're\nso many everything is a multiple choice\nso even like tinder right like i forget\nhow to talk to people if i use tinder\nand we see it on tinder by the way\nright where it's like now the app is\njust gonna give me people and i have to\nswipe right or swipe left\ni never have to approach anyone and then\nthey will send me a text and i will\nrespond and it's like everything is\nbeing done for us so social we're\nforgetting how to socialize\nso\nthis is where if you're in this\nsituation the main thing that you really\nneed to do\nis understand what the goal of the\ninteraction is right so we're going to\ntalk a little bit about this\nso when you're chatting with someone\nthis is the goal\nit's a brief opportunity to get to know\nthe other person\nokay this is the way that i want you to\nthink about it this is just a chance for\nyou to figure out is this someone that i\nwant to interact with in the future or\nnot that should be goal number one and\nso then your brain will be like okay\nwell how do i figure that out well it's\nlike maybe ask them some questions about\nthemselves\nso you know you introduce yourself and\nthen you're like hey can you tell me a\nlittle bit about yours i mean that's a\nhard question to answer\nbut you can say like you know what are\nyou excited for in 2022 that's a great\nlike\nopener what are you worried about in\n2022\nright you can even go like you don't\neven have to ask a question\nyou can even say like some neutral\nresponse like man i can't believe it's\n20 22. it's crazy the other person could\nbe like yeah it's crazy\nit's like so what what are you you know\nwhat's 2022 looking like for you\nso you can just like\njust start to ask a couple of questions\nand remember the goal is just to figure\nout like do i want to hang out with this\nperson ever again\nsecond thing is to think a little bit\nabout your goal\nyourself in the interaction so this is\nwhere it's an opportunity to share a\nlittle bit about yourself that's the\npurpose of chatting it's not like you're\nnot trying to get this person to like\nyou it's to just share a little bit\nabout yourself right so man i can't\nbelieve it's like 20 22 it's nuts\nthey're like yeah man it's nuts i'm like\nyeah i've got like\nyou won't believe like towards the end\nof 2021 i made this post about gender\ndynamics and like a ton of people that i\nyou know like hanging out with\nwent nuts and so now i'm trying to\nfigure out like what to do with that\nso you kind of you kind of just share\nsomething about yourself right so like\nyou're it's an opportunity for for you\nto share a piece of yourself\njust don't share d's nuts\nokay and then if you share something\nlike that you'll see what the other\nperson does so this is like the\nsocialization is about hitting the ball\nacross the net and then you'll see what\nthey hit back\nokay so it's an opportunity to get to\nknow someone and it's an opportunity to\nshare a piece of yourself\nand the main thing to understand about\nthese brief social interactions is that\nthey're brief that nothing has to come\nout of them if you understand how to\nchat like nothing has to come out of\nthis understand that this person is\ngoing to be alive for the next 50 or 60\nyears\njust assume that for a moment that\nyou're going to be alive for the next 50\nor 60 years\nin the grand scheme of things you have\none moment in time where the two of you\nare together and you have an opportunity\nto exchange something which could turn\ninto a second conversation or friends or\nwhatever\nbut at the end of the day like if you\nsay something wrong like that's not that\nbig of a deal it's not like you've\nruined this person's life they're going\nto go on and live their life you're\ngoing to go on and live your life and at\nthe end of the day this is just a brief\nchance meeting\nright\nit's like\nif i walk outside and i look at a tree\nthis is a brief interaction between me\nand the tree the tree doesn't really\ncare that i appreciate it or don't\nappreciate it i don't really care that\nthe tree appreciates me or doesn't\nappreciate me we're just in each other's\npresence we're just going to kind of\nchill for a little bit together and then\nwe're going to go our separate ways\nso when it comes to chatting it's just\nan opportunity to\nhave your life\nvery very gently intersect with someone\nelse's life and something could come out\nof that meeting or nothing the high\nlikelihood is nothing is going to come\nout of the meeting which is totally fine\nand that's what life is it's a string of\nexperiences that have no real\nconsequences\nright that's what the majority of life\nis every time i take a breath\nit's not going to transform the world\nevery time i take a walk around my house\nit's not going to transform the world\nevery time i meet another human being\ni'm not going to transform their life\nthey're not going to transform mine\nit's just a tiny little opportunity for\nyou to get to know someone else and for\nyou to share a little bit about yourself\nthat's all it is\nand once you begin to realize that it\nactually doesn't matter what happens\ntoday like it doesn't i'm not going to\nruin this person's life i'm not going to\nsave their life they're not going to\nruin my life they're not going to save\nmy life you can sort of be a little bit\nrelaxed right so what's the purpose of a\nsandbox game\nis to build something cool it's like a\nmultiplayer sandbox game where it's like\ni'm going to put some stuff together and\nlike i'll see if you want to put some\nsimilar stuff together\nand if you want to build a hot and i\nwant to build a car like you're building\nyour hut and i'm going to build my car\nand i'm like that's okay\neventually what will happen if you\nenter into sandbox games with enough\npeople is i will build a car and then\nyou will build a car too and then i'll\nwalk over it'll be like wow that's a\nreally cool car i never thought about\nmaking the wheels purple i always\nassumed i would make the wheels black\nand the other person is like no no man\npurple wheels are so much better than\nblack wheels i'll be like\ncool\ni never thought about that oh maybe i'll\nmake a red wheel i was like yeah that's\ndope make a red wheel\nand then suddenly like you have a friend\nright\nand so this is this is how social\ninteraction works\nso if you're struggling to understand\nsocial interaction\nfirst thing to understand is that our\nbrain has been\nsort of shaped\nby\ntoo much choice so instead of figuring\nthings out for ourselves whether it be\nquest markers and video games or going\non to youtube or twitch and like it\ntells you what to enjoy right even today\nlike you guys are showing up to this\nlecture you're watching this video and\nit's like you didn't decide hey this is\nwhat i want to seek out you just like\nshowed up on youtube or on twitch or\nwhatever and dr k chose what they're\ngoing to talk about so you're just given\nthe choice\nand so social interaction can become\nvery very difficult because there's not\na clear choice to make there's not a\nclear goal and so like your mind draws a\nblank because the way that your mind\npopulates with thoughts is that it has a\nparticular target and then it figures\nout how to get there so if i'm thirsty\ni'm gonna drink some water\nit has a goal and then it sets up the\nsteps so if your mind is drawing a blank\nthat means that you don't know what goal\nto set\nand so if you want a very simple goal to\nset if you want to understand what's the\npurpose of chatting\nthe purpose of chatting is to have an\nopportunity to get a window into someone\nelse's life\nget a window into their thought process\nto learn a little bit about them and to\nshare a little bit about yourself\nand out of the thousand people that\nyou're going to meet in the next three\nyears\na handful of those that'll turn into\nsomething else but you don't need to\nseek that out you don't need to look for\nit you don't need to be tied to it it's\njust an opportunity for you to you know\ninteract with another human being and if\nnothing comes of it so be it\nright\nquestions\nah so this is a great question\nso high cardio is asking what if it's a\ngrill and by that i assume you mean girl\nso i know this is going to be kind of\nmind-blowing\nvery difficult to understand\nbut the genitalia of the person that\nyou're talking to makes no difference\nwith how you should interact with them\ni know it's shocking\nthat just because they have genitals\nthat are different from yours or maybe\nthey're the same and and you're in\nyou're lesbian who knows\nassuming a heteronormative perspective\nthere but i don't know many lesbians\nthat refer to other women as grills\nso maybe that's a safe assumption on my\npart\nmakes no difference\nshocking\nthat humans are humans\nand the genitals don't matter\ndon't treat them differently\ntreat them like humans\nthey can like cars too just like get\ninto the sandbox game and build what you\nwant to build let them build what they\nwant to build\nand interact with them as people\nthe genitalia does not need to define\nthe interaction\nshocking i know\nconfusing i know\nhumans first i understand that some\npeople struggle with that that that's\nthat makes sense\nbut then the question is like where does\nthat struggle come from right so if you\nhave difficulty talking to\nthe opposite sex or girls or the sex\nthat you're attracted to however\nwhere does that difficulty come from\nthat difficulty comes from\nsetting a goal that you don't know how\nto execute right so now like i'm playing\na sandbox game or i'm playing let's say\nskyrim\nand\ni'm given a quest of\nyou know mine a thousand minerals and a\nthousand gas\nand then i get super confused because\nlike i don't know how to accomplish that\nin this game like it gets confusing for\nme i don't know how to do this then i\nget anxious\nright because it's like so stop playing\nthat game like don't worry about and\ndon't have an expectation to the\ninteraction don't try to do something\nbecause they're a girl like that's where\nthe problem is coming from the problem\nis coming from the goal that you set for\nyourself\nthe expectation that you set for\nyourself\nthe demand that you put on yourself that\nthis expectation should go a certain way\nit's like no this is just a brief\ninteraction with another random human\nbeing and the more that you can reframe\ntowards that the easier it will be to\ntalk to like women\nright does that make sense it's all like\nup in here\nwho randomly meets 300 people a year so\nlike\ni don't know if you guys are\nparticipating in chat but there seemed\nto be 5 315 people right now each of\nwhom is interacting with you\nand people are adding each other right\nso like oh like i'm an indoor like\nyou're interacting with like 5 000\npeople right now\nright like you're interacting with\npeople all the time\nsure no no no no hold on a second hold\non a second before you guys discount\nthis kind of interaction this is real\nyou can hop on discord afterward you're\ngoing to talk to other people like you\nmeet 300 people a year on discord\nthrough games and through twitch don't\ntell me otherwise\nright and people will respond to each\nother on chat people will answer each\nother's questions like those\ninteractions and that's easy why because\nthere's no expectation\nright you all get that\nwe meet more people now than we used to\nwe have more opportunities for\ninteraction than we used to\nthis is the big paradox of like being\nonline is that there's like way more\npeople to meet and it's like somehow\nit's way harder to meet them it's kind\nof weird but you can't you i can\nabsolutely do it right you can have a\nmeaningful conversation with someone i\nactually think that the discord is\nreally good at this where it's like\nbecause people can sort of offer support\nthey can like meet for a moment in time\nand there's no expectation that's why\nit's so easy to hang out with people on\ndiscord because you're not expecting\nanything from them\nyou"
