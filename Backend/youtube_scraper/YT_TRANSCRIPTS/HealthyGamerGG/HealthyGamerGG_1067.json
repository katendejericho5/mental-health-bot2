    "transcript": "and then like once you start doing those\nthings you're gonna wake up one day and\nyou're gonna realize you know what i am\nactually an athlete i am a scholar\nbecause i am doing those things holy\n[ __ ]\nlike i can do this like this is me like\nthis is actually who i am this is who\ni've always been i just haven't\nrealized it\nso let's talk about new year's\nresolutions\nso when the new year rolls around a lot\nof people make a resolution right they\ndecide that in this year i am going to\ndo x y and z\nand the challenge with new year's\nresolutions is that most people don't\nstick to them\nand so what i'd like to do today is talk\nto you all a little bit about a few\ndifferent perspectives that we can\nunderstand about how to stick to your\nnew year's resolution\nand the interesting thing about this is\ngoing to be like you know sticking to it\ninvolves first of all understanding\nwhy you don't stick to it so it's my\nhypothesis that i'm going to lay out\ntoday that\nyou can start a new year's resolution\nand then at some point it's gonna fall\napart and the question is why does it\nfall apart because if you can prevent\nthat falling apart from happening if you\ncan understand why the falling apart\nhappens\nthen you can make take steps to sort of\nprevent it from happening and then you\ncan kind of stick with your new year's\nresolution\nso to begin with\nif we want to start on a very simple\nlevel\nwith new year's resolutions we have to\nstart\nby understanding\nwhere does the new year's resolution\ncome from\nso what do you all think motivates\npeople\nwhat motivates\npeople\nto do\na\nnew year's resolution\nright where does this motivation come\nfrom\nso the first thing that i want to share\nwith you all if you guys have seen the\ngoal setting and motivation set of of\nlectures\num this will be pretty familiar to you\nif you haven't seen this i highly highly\nrecommend you you check it out\nthe first thing to understand is that\nhuman beings when they decide to do\nsomething they tend to have\na couple of different\nreasons why they do stuff and if you\nkind of think about a new year's\nresolution it's sort of weird right\nbecause you say i want to give up sugar\nlet's say for 2022 no more sugar and so\nthere's like one part of your mind right\nno sugar\nand then there's a second part of your\nmind that like a week later or a month\nlater is like ah\ni want sugar\nso the first thing to understand is that\nif you want to stick to a new year's\nresolution you have to understand that\nyour mind is not homogenous\nso your mind has multiple pieces\nand if we want to create a behavior we\nhave to understand\nwhat are the pieces of my mind and which\none is operating and which one takes\nover and like how does that kind of\nstuff work i'm going to actually just\nmove this real quick\nnope\nalert box\nmove the alert box like\ndown here i\nthink okay\nall right\nso\ndoes that make sense so our mind is\nconflicted so let's start by\nunderstanding like what are the\ndifferent parts of the mind what are the\ndifferent sources of motivation\nso the first thing that we're going to\ntalk about is desires\nokay so these are things that like you\nwant\nso we'll use the word want\nlike i want a coke or i want a yacht or\ni want\ni want to be on a beach i want to quit\nmy job\nnext thing that motivates us is shoulds\nright so these are things that like you\nshould do like i should study for my\ntest but i want to play a video game so\nwe can already see that like these two\nthings can conflict right\nthe next thing that we have are duties\nthese are kind of like obligations\nand this is what gets super confusing is\nthat a lot of times we think that our\nduties are duties but they're actually\nshoulds like we say like oh it's my duty\nto be healthy no it's not it's not your\nduty\nthese are things that you're like kind\nof obligated or you have an external\nthing that is like kind of forcing you\nto do stuff\nand then the next thing that we have the\nlast thing that we have are values\nor things that we care about\nso i know it sounds kind of weird but a\nlot of people will when they think about\na new year's resolution what they'll do\nis they'll think of it as a goal\nright i'm going to exercise every day\ni'm going to lose 10 pounds i'm going to\ncut out sugar i'm it's basically\nsomething that's hard\nand basically the what a new year's\nresolution is is stuff that i should do\nmost new year's resolutions come from\nthe should category\nbut if we look at like basically science\ni mean gross over generalization here\nbut if you look at what people are\nactually motivated towards\nthey tend to be happy and productive\nwhen they're more on this side of the\nquadrant than on this side of the\nquadrant when you're way over here you\nhave a hedonistic\nempty life\nwhen you're over here you can have a\nsuccessful\nempty life\nright so like if i listen to my parents\nand i was a good indian boy and i went i\nbecame a doctor even though i wanted to\nbecome a video game programmer\ni can become successful by doing all the\nstuff that i should do but it's going to\nbe empty i'm going to be like not happy\non the inside\nso over here\nwhen we live like on this side we're\ngoing to tend to have a fuller life like\nwe'll be happy\nright and hopefully we'll be successful\ntoo but we'll kind of get to that in a\nsecond\nso the first thing to understand is that\nwhere do the first question you should\nask yourself so this is step up number\none is\nwhere\ndoes\nmy\nnew year's resolution\ncome from\nokay i know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike a lot of times we don't introspect\nso step number one is to actually\nintrospect\nabout your new year's resolution like\nthink it think about it\nlike ask yourself like is this something\ni'm just coming up with arbitrarily\nbecause it's something i should do is\nthis something that i really want is\nthis something that i care about because\nthe good news is that these two things\ntend to\nmotiv like drive behavior\nway stronger\nthan these two things\nand the main reason that they drive\nbehavior is that they tend to be\nresistant\nto costs\nso when i care about something i'm\nwilling to pay something for it when i\nhave a desire it's like harder to pay\nsomething for it when i have a should\nit's like harder to like expend\nsomething for the sake of like something\ni should do but if i feel obliged to do\nsomething if i feel duty bound to do\nsomething if i feel honor bound to do\nsomething i'm going to make a sacrifice\nfor that sort of thing i'm going to make\nsacrifices for stuff that i care about\nbut not things that i want\nso this side is way more\nsacrifice oriented\nnow here's the main problem when we make\nnew year's resolutions\nwe focus on should and we tend to not\nthink\nabout costs\nso when i think about like okay i want\nto give up sugar in 2022 like what is\nthat gonna cost me\nam i willing to pay that cost like am i\nreally willing to\nno longer eat like for the rest of the\nyear like am i honestly willing and this\nis a question to ask yourself\nam i willing to pay this cost because a\nlot of times when people sign up for\nresolutions they don't really think\nabout what it's going to cost them\nso like think about if you give up sugar\nfor example that means like you know no\nmore frappuccinos or whatever you like\nto drink like if i go to a birthday\nparty like i'm not gonna get to eat cake\nif i have my own birthday party i'm not\nallowed to eat cake like am i willing to\ngive all that up if my friends go out\nfor dessert i'm just gonna tag along and\nlike not have a single bite when it's 2\na.m in the morning sure you can do all\nthose things and we'll talk about why\nit's easier to go for dessert with your\nfriends and not eat a single bite\nbut you crack when\nit's 2 a.m in the morning you're feeling\na little bit hungry and there's like you\nknow your your roommate bought some\nbrownies and they're just sitting there\nand like no one is watching and that's\nwhen you're going to crack\nright so the first thing that you've got\nto do if you want to be successful in a\nnew year's resolution is introspect\nand ask yourself where is this coming\nfrom is it something that i should do\nand this is where if it's if it's coming\nfrom one of these two quadrants the cost\nreally needs to be low otherwise it's\nnot going to work so you need to try to\nminimize the cost as much as possible\nso instead of like you know setting your\nnew year's resolution that is at no\nsugar it may be something like you know\nlike no sugar no sugar and beverages\nso like no beverage with any sugar so i\ncan like eat a cupcake but no sugar in a\nbeverage so no sodas\nno sugar in my coffee\nno like you know\nsweet tea or like whatever\nso you need to adjust the cost\nespecially if it comes from the should\nwant quadrant okay and i know it sounds\nkind of weird but if you really want to\nbe successful you have to like\nintrospect and then prep your brain\nfor the cost\nthis is going to increase your chance of\nsuccess so when you think out the thing\nthrough the costs i would actually write\nit out so i would like take a piece of\npaper and write out like why is this\nlike why am i picking this which\nquadrant is this coming from and the\nsecond thing you should write out is\nlike what is this going to cost me and\neven writing it out is going to be like\nprepping your brain for the cost because\nwhat tends to happen with new year's\nresolutions\nis that we're unprepared for the cost\nand then the cost hits us and then we're\nlike it's too much and then our mind\nstarts to conflict right we have this\nside and then we have this side and then\nwe weren't ready for it so side number\ntwo wins\nso start by introspecting and like doing\nthat awareness oriented work and prepare\nyourself for how bad this is gonna suck\nif you can if it's really coming from a\nshutter want i'd highly highly recommend\nreducing how difficult you make it\nbut at least prep for the cost okay so\nthis is number one is to introspect\nnow the second problem that we tend to\nrun into is that we're going to talk for\na second about the addict's brain\nso i don't know exactly this isn't like\na real term or anything it's just\nsomething i come up with so when i work\nwith people with addictions\nwhat i find is that their mind has a\ncertain gravity to it\nand what do i mean by gravity i mean\nthat it's endlessly attracted to the\nsource of addiction\nso you'll see this a lot like when\npeople ask like if we talk about\nmarijuana for example if i mention\nmarijuana we're gonna get all these\ndifferent questions\nright and it's gonna be dr k do you\nthink that marijuana is ever\nuseful is it ever okay to use and that's\na question that has a gravity towards it\nyou guys see what that question like\nwhat that person is looking for\nis an answer that i say yes of course\nit's ever useful ah-ha i have my\njustification so now i can move towards\nthe marijuana\nexcellent\nand so there's there's something that\nwill people will say but i have insomnia\nand they'll come up with really good\nreasons right they'll use a lot of\nlogic\noh i'll quit next year\nthey'll have all kinds of reasons\nbut you drink\nalcohol\nright when talking to your partner\neasy\nthey'll come up with all kinds of\nreasons it helps with my anxiety\ni do it for the fun\nand no matter how you frame things\nno matter how you discuss things no\nmatter what direction you you\ngo in\nthe gravity the mind has a gravity\ntowards\nthe\nthe addiction\nso this is the key thing to understand\nabout the mind\nthe mind is always going to want to move\nin the direction that it wants to move\nin\nand if you want to succeed in a new\nyear's resolution you need to understand\nthat the thing oftentimes is like the\ngoal that you have or you're giving\nsomething up that your mind is going to\nwant to move there and so what i'd like\nto do is share with you all some of the\ntools\nthat your mind uses and that you can use\nto sort of deflect this sort of very\nnatural gravity of the addict's brain\nand so you may say like okay but we just\nhave to acknowledge that like your mind\nis not going to want to do the thing\nthis is essentially the point of like\nbringing up the addict's brain that no\nmatter how you twist and turn at its\ncore your mind may not be working for\nyou towards the goal\nthis is why\nwe want to operate from here because\nthis is the quad these are the two\nquadrants that will help us make\nsacrifices so either the mind wants it\nwe're going to be able to give something\nup we're okay with the sacrifice if it's\non the you know on the right two\nquadrants okay\nso just be aware so look out for the\naddict's brain look out for your mind\nand how it's going to try to convince\nyou\nto give up the resolution because it's\nnot going to be working for you it's\ngoing to be working against you it's\ngoing to be like ah you did it good for\na month you can have a cheat day like\ndon't worry about it like it's okay\nall right so beware the addict's brain\nokay\nso\nhere's the first tip that i'd give you\nkeep\nyour\nnew year's resolution\nsecret\ncritical critical critical critical\ncritical critical\ncritical\nso there is a psychological aspect of\nthis\nand\na spiritual aspect of this so the\npsychological aspect\nso when i'm giving up sugar\nand i go out to dessert with my friends\nokay\nit's so easy to not eat it right because\nit's like look at me like look at me i'm\na stick to my new year's resolution\n[ __ ]\ny'all all plebs are gonna eat that crap\nbut i'm gonna show you how awesome i am\nby being so resistant and so willful\nright so the key thing about advertising\nyour new year's resolution\nis that it leads to a positive\nemotion with no cost\nright so if you tell someone you're like\nyeah i'm giving up alcohol for 2022.\nwhat are they gonna do they're gonna be\nlike screw you noob no they're gonna say\nwow that must be so hard that's awesome\ni'm so happy for you\nso you're like you just said some words\nand suddenly people are like oh wow look\nat this chad\nisn't this person great and so if you\nadvertise\nlike\nyour new year's resolution people are\ngonna be like oh look at how amazing you\nare for giving this thing up you haven't\nactually get like they're not there in\nthe quiet moments\nwhen you're struggling like you've got\nthe cookie in your hand and you're like\ndon't eat the cookie don't eat the\ncookie throw the cookie away no cookie\nno cookie for you dr k\nright\nso like this also recruits ego this is a\nlittle bit more spiritual but\nadvertising your new year's resolution\ngives you a benefit without any kind of\ncost and then what happens is your brain\nis like oh cool like if i can get a\nbenefit without a cost why the hell am i\npaying a cost if i can just get the\nbenefit by talking the talk\nand now we know right so there's two\nkinds of people in life there are people\nwho talk the talk\nthey're people who walk the walk\nright there's like there are two kinds\nof people that\nhave to do like with startups they're\npeople who talk about starting startups\nand they're people who actually start\nstartups the people who are talking\nabout it are the ones that like oh i've\ngot this great idea for a company i'm\ngonna do this i'm gonna do this i'm\ngonna do this i'm gonna do this they're\ntalking talking talking talking talking\ngratifies the ego gives them some kind\nof oh my god that's such a great idea oh\nmy god you're so revolutionary you're\ngonna be the next like elon musk oh my\ngod that's so amazing just imagine it's\ngonna be fantastic you're so brilliant i\nwish i was like you and i wish i could\nstart a startup numbers like yeah\ni'm so great\ni'll tell you about my next idea next\nweek and get another ego boost it's\ngonna be so awesome\nand then there are people who are like\nactually like you know run startups and\nyou don't you know they don't hang\naround on discord they're just like i\nmean maybe they do\nnot not to bash discord but like there\nare people out there who are actually\ndoing it and there are people who are\nlike talking about it right so if you\nlike think about people who are in shape\nlike they just go to the gym and they\ndon't maybe they advertise maybe they're\negotistical but generally speaking they\njust like go to the gym like most of the\npeople who are in shape are not like\nadvertising it all the time and talking\nabout how they're gonna get in shape\nthey're like they're actually in shape\nthey're people who talk about getting in\nshape and they're people who are in\nshape you guys get that\nnow there's another aspect of this which\nis a little bit spiritual which may be\npsychological too but this is sort of\nthe tradition that i learned this from\nis that\nanything\nkept internal\ncompounds\nokay so this is why mantra is kept\nsecret\nso when you do your month or practice\nyou never share your mantra i've never\ntold a single soul what my mantra is my\npersonal mantra is known by two people\nme and the guru who gave it to me\nokay so you don't tell anyone about your\nmantra\nand what people realized like the yogi\nsort of figured this out is if you never\ntell anyone it will increase in power\nand if you vent it out to the world if\nyou vent that energy by sharing it with\nthe world it will decrease in power\nso another good example of this is\nactually trauma\nso in trauma what we want to do is vent\nit out right so if someone has\nexperienced trauma\nthey keep it inside\nand it eats them alive\nthis is bad so what is the solution how\ndo we get that energy out of them and\nstop compounding we vent it\nthrough therapy\nso\nwhen we want to when we want to do\ntherapy or something we're trying to\nvent the negative energy that depressive\nenergy you have in your mind the anxious\nenergy that you have in your mind\nbecause you all know this if you have\nlike anxiety like it just loops in that\nin there right it just loops and loops\nand loops and loops and loops it loose\nit never like gets worse and worse and\nyou work yourself up into a frenzy and\nthen you've got a panic attack and what\nyou really want to do is just need to\nget it out you want to vent it out if\nyou talk to a friend they can help\ndecompress you you feel so much better\nso energy that is kept within the mind\nwill compound an energy that is vented\nwill diminish and this is how you get\ntalkers and walkers because these are\nthe people who aren't talking about it\njust stays in there and actually\nproduces behavior and then you have the\ntalkers who are just talking about all\nthe time and they never like do anything\nokay\nso keep your new year's resolution\nsecret\nfor those of you saying oh my god dr k i\nalready failed beautiful\nyou've activated my trap card\ndon't\nlet\nfailure\nstop you\nthis is the biggest thing for a new\nyear's resolution\ndon't let failure stop you\nokay you're going to give up alcohol\nyou've gone 22 days without a single sip\nof alcohol then you screwed up your new\nyear's resolution like where did we get\nthe idea that new year's resolutions\nhave to be perfect from day one like\nwhat the\nthink about that for a second\nlike if you fail so be it like on day 24\nyou can be sober again\nright so this is where it's like\neveryone's like someone's like just\ndon't fail no no this is the whole thing\ndon't let failure stop you if you\nscrewed up like if you resolve to\nexercise every single day and you go a\nweekend without exercise like ah\ni guess that's gg\nit's now february 8th and i've failed at\nmy new year's resolution so i guess i'll\ntry again in 2023.\nthere's the addict's brain\nyou guys see that\neasy you don't have to worry about it\ntry again in 2023\ni'ma go get high\nstop the exercise\ndon't let failure stop you\nnew year's resolution where does it\nwhere do we get the idea that it has to\nbe perfect the addict's brain gave it to\nus\nthat's where it comes from\nbecause then it's got the excuse it's\nlike this is easy this noob he's going\nto screw up a single time all i have to\ndo this is what the addict's brain is\nsaying like let's talk about sugar this\nis what your brain is saying this noob i\njust have to trip him up once we're\ngonna so he has to win a hundred percent\nof the time and i just have to win once\nbecause if i can get him to win once\nthis dumbass has this idea that if he\nslips up once his resolution is broken\nthen sugar sugar sugar all day long\nso then your mind is like all right\nlet's let's throw down and then you win\non day one\nmind is like let's throw down on day two\nday three day four day five day six day\nseven day eight day nine day ten\nit stops you once and then it's like\neasy\nand then you're sitting there and you're\nlike oh i failed my new year's\nresolution and then your brain is like\nyeah that's okay try again next year bro\nyou'll get it next year it's okay\ntry to try it next year girl\nyou got this next year but this year\njust let it go you screwed up it's all\nright\nvery important don't let failure stop\nyou if you really want to have a\nresolution\nit doesn't stop no matter what\nright like don't let failure stop you\nthis is what screws people up the most\nit's like everyone's going to make\nmistakes you're not perfect you're not\nenlightened you're not a yogi you're\nyogini right you're not any of those\nthings which is okay you don't need to\nbe so if you screw up just pick it up\ntomorrow\nor pick it up today\noh my god i'm supposed to exercise every\nsingle day and it's now 8 p.m and i\nhaven't exercised i skipped my morning\nworkout do something\ndon't let failure stop you\nwe see this a lot in actual addictions\ntoo right so someone's like oh my god i\nwas sober for 362 days\nand i screwed up\nand it's like\nokay so you s you had a drink which is\nokay so you can still be sober tomorrow\nit's like\nyou know like\nit's not a big deal you can go another\n362 days\nand then you'll have gone like you know\n724 days and you'll have had one drink\nin 724 days like that sounds pretty\nlegit it sounds pretty good\nbut the brain is like no no no i've\nscrewed up now i can drink all i want to\nbecause i screwed up the resolution is\nbroken\nso step number two don't let failure\nstop you\nokay\nand then\nthe last thought so we talk a lot about\nego\nand so this is something that you know\npeople will ask me the question\nis ego bad because when we talk about\nego we tend to think a little bit about\nwe talk about the negatives of ego\nbut one thing that can be really really\nhelpful\nfor new year's resolutions is to\nactually like think about your identity\nso who am i\nand to try to develop an identity that's\npositive so i'll give you guys just an\nexample\nso a lot of times when we struggle to\nyou know adopt a new year's resolution\nwe have an identity of ourselves i'm\ngonna just be harsh here for a second so\ni am\nand\nout\nof shape\nnerd\nokay\ndoesn't mean that nerds are out of shape\nbut this will identify with some of\nthese things right\ni'm not\na very\nhealthy person\nso we'll have all kinds of like negative\nlike conceptions i'm a loser\nright so we'll believe these things\nabout ourselves\nand then if you kind of think about it\nwhat you'll start to do\nis like as you start like the new year's\nresolution\nthese people are trying to be something\nelse right you're trying to be something\nelse\nbut you sort of fundamentally like don't\nbelieve that you are this this like\nbetter person like you think you're a\nloser who's trying to lose weight\nso at the core\nyou have an identity that's sort of\nsabotaging you in the quiet moments\nbecause on some level you don't believe\nthat you can do this kind of thing\nand so i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut what i would love it if you guys try\nto do\nis start to like change who you are and\ni don't make it sound so simple but i'll\nexplain so like i want you guys to like\ntell yourselves i am an athlete\nor i am\na scholar\nso pick something that you actually want\nto be like and like just start telling\nyourself like\ni know it sounds weird i'm saying just\nchange but i want you guys to really try\nthis it's gonna be easier than you think\nit is so then as you go about your day\nlike ask yourself\nwhat would\nan athlete do\nor what would a scholar do\njust ask yourself like like in this\nmoment like when you're thinking about\nwhat to eat\nyou know if you're an athlete like just\nwhat would an athlete eat in this\nsituation\nwhat would a scholar do in this\nsituation like would a scholar like play\nworld warcraft or would they actually\nlike sit down and read a book\nand i'm gonna be that thing like you can\nbe that thing because what's the\ndifference\nbetween a scholar and a loser it's like\nthe choice that they make right like if\nwe look at someone who's an athlete it's\nlike the food that they put into their\nbody the way that they like treat their\nbody like do they take care of their\nbody on a daily basis and if you start\ndoing those things you will be that\nthing it's i know it's kind of weird but\nit's actually really simple and it's\nactually like bizarrely easy\nthe problem is that deep down if you\nbelieve you're a loser you're gonna go\nup against all of this like negative\nenergy any time you try to make a change\nand what i want you all to realize is\nthat if you tell yourself i am an\nathlete and then you go to lunch and you\nask yourself like what would an athlete\norder and you order that thing there's\nno difference between you and an athlete\nbecause what is an athlete an athlete\nwho is someone who eats particular\nthings exercises in a particular way a\nscholar is someone who chooses to read\ninstead of play video games and so you\ncan do all of those things and you can\nactually become all that person\nit's actually so close to you it's super\nsuper bizarre\nokay\nso i know this is like i see that chat\nis meaning and stuff but for those of\nyou if you i want you to really try this\nand this is one way that you can harness\nego is to actually like\nconsider for a moment if your mind so\nfor those of you that are rebelling\nagainst this\nthat is the biggest sign of the addict's\nbrain\nright because your brain is like\nit's so easy\nthis is ridiculous i could never do this\nthis is idiotic this guy's just saying\noh just call yourself an athlete and\nthen stop eating sugar no no no that's\nstupid\nthat's so ridiculous i don't have to do\nthat it's dumb it's not going to work\nand because i don't have to do that i\ndon't have to give up sugar [ __ ] you\nthat's so idiotic just change this is\nnew realize how hard it is to change oh\nyeah you see what's happening there your\nmind is telling you it's hard to change\ndon't bother bro just sit there don't\neven try it\noh my god\nyou guys see that\nfor all of y'all that are being smart\nasses\nwhere is that thought coming from\nwhere is that thought coming from why do\nyou resist calling yourself an athlete\nlike why do you think you're not an\nathlete why do you think you're not a\nscholar\nlike where do you get that idea\nit's not true it's because of a\nconception i'm a loser like that's not i\ncan't biopsy you and find loserness i\ncannot even if you're the biggest loser\non the internet it's impossible\ni'm not a very healthy person i'm not\nlike the other healthy people\nand if you're trying to create a new\nyear's resolution and stick to it and\nyou're holding on to this crap on the\ninside it's never going to work\nto realize that you are actually an\nathlete that what is an athlete an\nathlete is someone who makes different\nchoices\nfrom the choices you've made in the past\ntherefore you can become an athlete like\nthis\nget up off your ass right now and\nexercise a little because that's what an\nathlete if we stuck an athlete in your\nbody and in your circumstance\na real athlete and we stuck them in your\ncircumstance what would they do\nthey'd start getting their [ __ ] in order\nright\nthey'd start exercising they'd start\neating healthy they can start from\nwherever you are don't be held back by\nthis identity\nand if your mind is rebelling against\nthat it's because it loves this identity\nit loves it because if you conceptualize\nyourself as i'm a loser\nwhat do you get to do\nif your brain calls you a loser and you\naccept that what do you get licensed to\ndo what do you get freedom to do\nattendees\nwe all love attendees gamers eat tendes\nah you see that you don't have to resist\nplay games\nsure\nright\nnot bother\nlearning\nhow to socialize\noh this is a big one\nabsolve myself\nof responsibility\nbecause\ni'm lazy\nand i'm not like the other people\ni'm not like the other people those\nother people that were born with the\ndiscipline gene i got the short end of\nthe stick so i'm a loser\ngg no point in trying i guess my mind\ngets to smoke pot and eat tendees all\nday\neasy\nwhatever your vice is\nwhen you start to believe that you're a\nloser\nit's not actually true this is the\ncraziest thing you're not a loser\nthere's like no such thing\nno such thing as a loser it's not an\nidentity you can lose in a game sure\nlike in that moment you can lose a game\nbut you are not a loser\nit's like\nyou know like\nit it's a it's a state it's not a trait\nit's not a being\nbut you call yourself this and then it\nopens the door to all kinds of behaviors\nso if you really want to change your\nlife and you want to like resolve to be\nsomething else\nadopt a different identity\nand you say like but how do i how do i\nadopt the identity and i guarantee you\nthis is going to happen\nyou behave like that thing and you say\nwhat would an athlete do in this\nsituation because how do you define how\ndo you tell who's an athlete and who's a\nscholar how do you determine that like\nhow do we judge that it's based on their\nactions\nand then like once you start doing those\nthings you're going to wake up one day\nand you're going to realize you know\nwhat i am actually an athlete i am a\nscholar\nbecause i am doing those things holy\n[ __ ]\nlike i can do this like this is me like\nthis is actually who i am this is who\ni've always been i just haven't\nrealized it\nso this is a positive way to like use\nego\nright\nokay\nso to summarize\nnew year's resolutions are tough\nwhy are they tough the first thing is\nbecause they come from a stupid place\nright we just come from like they just\nlike we just come up with this idea\nwe're like oh i'ma do this in 2022. and\nthe mind loves that kind of thing\nbecause it's like you're not going to do\nthat so it has no problem with that so\nit's going to get super excited we get a\nburst of emotional energy\nthat drives us to make a new year's\nresolution\nand the interesting thing is that if the\nbehavior is driven by that burst of\nemotional energy as soon as the emotion\nwanes the behavior will disappear this\nis why most people screw up with their\nnew year's resolutions\nso instead we're going to start by\nactually introspecting and trying to\nfigure out okay where does this new\nyear's resolution come from\nlike where does it come from like why do\ni want this thing what part of me wants\nthis thing because there are going to be\nparts of you that don't want to think\nand that's where the addict's brain\ncomes in your mind is not going to want\nthe new year's resolution there's a part\nof you that's like yeah it'd be so cool\nif i was like oh yeah i gave up this or\ni did this every day and some partying\nthat ah bro i don't want to do that\nso to think a little bit about where the\nnew year's resolution is coming from and\nwhat it will cost you i want you to know\nwhat you're signing up for read the fine\nprint of the new year's resolution\nlist out the costs\nwrite them down and understand what\nyou're signing up for and then if you're\nlike yeah that's too tough that's okay\nso tone down the goal\nright decrease the loan amount\nyou know so like like adjust adjust\nuntil there's something that you can\ncomfortably handle\nall right second thing\ndon't tell anyone about it\ndon't tell anyone\nkeep your new year's resolution a secret\nif people ask you questions like do you\nhave a new year's resolution this year\nif you don't want to lie you can say\nyeah i'm kind of working on some stuff\nkeep it secret because if you start\ntelling people they're going to start\nsupporting you emotionally and then\nyou're going to\nyour brain is gonna be like we just talk\nabout doing it and people will love us\nanyway so like why bother bro\nso keep it secret keep it to yourself\nnext thing don't let failure stop you\nyou're gonna screw up at some point it's\npart of life you're not perfect\nbut the addict's brain loves\nto let us screw up\nresult in complete\nabsolution of responsibility\nright oh well now that i'm not i've i\ndrank yesterday so i might as well drink\ntoday because like my year of sobriety\nis broken anyway now that it's broken i\nmight as well enjoy myself\nokay\nkeep it secret\nabsolutely\nwell said is it secret is it safe so\ngandalf the grey understood this right\nhe understood that\nto be safe it must be secret and then if\nyou don't make it secret it won't stay\nsafe\nso if you want your new year's\nresolution to be intact and safe\ndon't tell a soul\nall right don't let failure stop you\nand the last thing is to use identity in\nyour favor so that a lot of times when\nwe come up with a resolution we are\ntrying to be someone else\nbut all of that internal stuff is going\nto resist the goal that other people can\naccomplish and that's why you fail\nbecause you don't think it's actually\nyou when you need to actually realize\nthat this is you\nthat you are not a loser that you are an\nathlete you are a scholar you are an\nentrepreneur\nyou don't have to be grandiose about it\nit's not like something to be proud of\nit's just what you are it is simple you\ndon't need to tell a damn soul you don't\nneed to walk around saying i'm an\nathlete a scholar entrepreneur polymath\noh yeah i'm all of those things no no no\nyou're not going to tell damn soul it's\nwhat you keep on the inside\njust imagine\nhow your life is shaped by the way that\nyou view yourself on the inside\nand everything that it shapes about your\ninteractions so start to realize it's\nnot believe it's realize that you are\nthose things the only thing that is\nstopping you is your choice\nand then when it comes down to making a\nchoice\nask yourself what would this person do\nand then if i do that thing i am that\nperson because that's all an athlete is\nan athlete is just someone who exercises\nand eats healthy\nright like that's what it is\na scholar is someone who has learned it\nin studies like who's curious about the\nworld and like tries to learn things so\nyou can do all of that you just have to\ndo it\nand then if you try this for a little\nwhile you may be shocked\nto believe that holy crap you can\nactually be this thing that you are this\nthing\nthat this entire time you just not\nrealized that you were that thing and it\nis your own mental conception which has\nheld you back\nso this is what i would recommend if you\nwant to do a new year's resolution go\nfor it but just make sure you take care\nof your identity make sure you\nunderstand where it comes from make sure\nyou understand what it's going to cost\nyou\ndon't tell a damn soul and don't let\nfailure stop you\nyou"
