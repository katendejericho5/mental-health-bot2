    "transcript": "the positive feedback the reassurance is\ngoing to come from the outside world but\nunless you attend to the outside world\nif your attention is focused on the\ninside then all you're going to\nexperience is the cringe over and over\nand over and over and over again\ni find everything cringy\nso i'm finding everything in life cringy\nmy attempts at conversations just make\nme feel cringy seeing others\nconversate is cringy seeing everything\nin social media is cringy people around\nme make me cringe and i try to avoid\nbeing around when i want to make friends\nit makes me feel like everyone is trying\ntoo hard and are just corny especially\nwhen the conversations are just random\nnonsense\ni feel like this is holding me back from\nengaging and making me feel like a bad\nguy even when i play multiplayer games i\ncringe at anyone using meta weapons just\ntrying too hard\nin my head right now i understand why\nanyone would do what they do and of\ncourse they need to use meta to secure\nthe dub but when i'm in the moment i\njust find myself cringing at everything\nnecessary in life any tips or\nexplanations on this i would severely\nappreciate\nfantastic post\nokay\nso\nlet's try to understand this is going to\nbe like kind of like an internal answer\nto this so if\nyou're concerned that things are too\ncringy and you think you yourself are\ncringy and that other people are cringy\nwe're gonna approach this in two angles\none is we're gonna talk like internally\nwhere cringe comes from and we're gonna\ntalk about externally like what it means\nto actually be cringy okay\nso the first thing to understand is that\ncringe is essentially a judgment\nright so if you if you label something\nas cringy that is a judgment you are\nmaking on something else\nso if you want to be less like if you\nthink the world is way too cringy this\nis actually a problem of your mind\njudging too harshly\nnow i'm not quite sure exactly why this\nperson thinks everything is cringe where\nthat judgment comes from but if we think\nabout what\ncapacity of the mind what part of the\nmind labels things that's cringe it's\nessentially a judgment\nso in terms of social interaction\nsometimes we have difficulty interacting\nwith other people because we feel we are\ncringy\nright this part the person didn't\nexplicitly say that but i sort of maybe\nthey did\nbut i'm sort of getting the sense that\nthey have difficulty interacting with\nother people because they feel that they\nare cringe because in turn they think\neveryone else is cringe and everything\nis cringe\nso\nthis is the the challenge is that i i\nthink if you're\nhow can i say this the first thing to\nunderstand is that\nif your mind is like wait thinking about\ncringe too much you're not actually\nattuning to the outside world\nso the process of labeling something is\ncringe the process of believing that you\nyourself are cringe\nis actually a judgment that you're\ncarrying on in here right so you're like\nyou're playing this whole script in here\nlike judging that you're like oh my god\nthat's so cringe like you're not 100\npaying attention to the conversation\nyou're not absorbed in the conversation\nyou're busy criticizing the conversation\nthinking about the conversation you're\nthinking about the conversation right\nyou're on almost on a meta level instead\nof participating in the thing you're\ncommenting about the thing\nso for example if i eat a piece of food\nand i enjoy the food\nor i can be critical of the food and the\nmore critical i am of the food the less\ni'm able to enjoy it because my mind is\nnot attending to the outside world my\nmind's attention is on the internal\nworld and a judgment that i'm making\nso this is kind of the interesting thing\nis that like the negative energy in your\nmind will continue to cycle this is why\nthis person finds everything cringe\nbecause their mind is in such a\njudgmental mode\nthat all it knows how to do is like\njudge so it's like judging mcjuggerson\nso everything that happens i'm going to\njudge it i'm going to judge it i'm going\nto judge it i'm going to judge it so the\nfirst question is how do you stop doing\nthat right so like\nif my mind is in a highly judgmental\nmode\nthere are a couple of things that could\nbe going on\nthe first is that you learned this from\nsomewhere\nokay\nso if you learned it from somewhere that\nmean like maybe you were judged a lot\ngrowing up or like you're very very\nsensitive to judgment or you grew up\nwith a parent who was constantly judging\nyou therefore your mind started to learn\nhow to be very judgmental towards other\npeople\nso you need to connect those dots and\nthen you start to realize oh actually\nthis isn't like me actually thinking\nthis is cringe this is my mind's\nconditioning labeling everything around\nme is like insufficient in some way\nright so that's the first question is\nlike where did you learn to become so\njudgmental\nsecond thing you can do is start to\nexternalize\nso if you find yourself being like super\njudgmental instead of like thinking\nthose thoughts and being trapped up here\ntry to absorb yourself in the experience\nof whatever you're doing so if you're\ntalking to someone actually like stop\nand listen to them right instead of\njudging what they say like try to\nunderstand what they say\ntry to understand where does this person\ncome from even if i think it's cringe\nwhere's it coming from\nfor yourself too if you're if you're\njudging yourself and you think you are\ncringe\nnotice that that too is internally\nfocused right your attention is not\npointed towards the outside when you\nspeak words\nyou are not attending to that person's\nresponse you are just caught up with how\nyour words could be perceived so instead\nof actually paying attention to how your\nwords are perceived\nyou're filled up in your mind with how\nthey could be perceived and how cringe\nit could be\nso i want you to just notice that like\nif you think you are cringy and you have\na lot of crippling social anxiety notice\nthat you're not actually paying\nattention to the outside world you're\njust in your own head\nand this is why it can be so crippling\nbecause the positive feedback the\nreassurance is never going to come from\nyour head\nthe positive feedback the reassurance is\ngoing to come from the outside world but\nunless you attend to the outside world\nif your attention is focused on the\ninside then all you're going to\nexperience is the cringe over and over\nand over and over and over again\ndoes that make sense and these people\nfeel stuck because the very solution\nthey need the medicine that they need is\nnot inside it's on the outside but their\nmind keeps on focusing on their internal\nthought process\nokay does that make sense\nso\ncringe is born of judgment the judging\npart of the mind the monus\nso you can try to think a little bit\nabout where you learned how to be so\njudgmental why you are so judgmental and\nthe solution is going to be actually\nattending to external stimuli so really\nlisten to what someone else is saying\neven if you think what you're saying is\ncringe\nyou're thinking that in your head\nwhereas you need to pay attention to the\nfacial expressions of other people\nwhat do they think\nokay are they enjoying the conversation\ntry to like pay attention to the actual\nconversation y'all are talking about\nsomething who cares how it's received or\nnot received just have the conversation\nso switch your your attention externally\nnow this conversation would not be\ncomplete without actually talking about\ncringe\nso here's the thing\nhow do you know if you're actually being\ncringy\nso cringe\nin my opinion if i were to define it\nwhat is cringe and what is not cringe\ncringe is forcing someone into an\ninteraction\nso it is like super super cringe is like\nforcing something okay so i'll give you\nall an example like hitting on your\nwaitress is cringe hitting on your\nwaiter is cringe\nwhy because like they don't have a\nchoice\nright like who's the cringiest person\nlike your grabby uncle at the holidays\ngrabby uncle comes over to you and is\nlike starts grabbing you and it's like\nyou can't what's cringe is like you\ncan't really say no\nlike it's not like a clear problem like\nit's not like a violation it's not like\nan assault\nit's not like something that you can go\nto jail for but it's something that's\nforced and people aren't given a choice\nto like interact with you or not that's\nwhat's cringe\nright so like if you're\na gamer and then someone on voice chat\nis female and their genitals are\ndifferent\nlike forcing an interaction with them is\ncringe if you're in an anime convention\nand there is a woman there\nand she is wearing a shirt of an anime\nthat you like\ngoing over and talking to her not cringe\nat all\nnot paying attention to her signals and\npersisting in a conversation with her is\ncringe\nso forcing an interaction is cringe\nright\nlike that's the definition of cringe so\nif you all want to learn like how do i\nactually be so the first part was like\nyou think you're cringy in your head but\nyou may not be cringy at all\nactually being cringy is one very very\nvery very simple thing\nwhich is do i force interactions on\nother people and if the answer to that\nis yes you are being cringy\nso this is like chain texting someone\nwho's not responding back to you that is\ncringe you're forcing them in into an\ninteraction\nso if someone has an escape route\nif someone does not have to interact\nwith you and they choose to interact\nwith you then you are not being cringed\nokay so if you guys are trying to figure\nout what cringe is am i forcing people\nin their interactions\nam i letting people go if they want to\ngo then i'm not being cringed because\nthat's totally cool it's like volitional\nlike don't worry about it don't sweat it\nso just ask yourself this question am i\nforcing someone into an interaction\nbecause this is what's going to happen a\nlot of y'all that are concerned about\nbeing cringe\nare going to discover actually i'm not\nbeing cringed because i came over we're\nat a party i sat down they sat down\nwe're talking for a little bit they've\nhad ample opportunity to leave and they\nhaven't left yet so i'm not being\ncringed totally cool totally fine not a\nbig deal\non the flip side\nthis is gonna be scary because a lot of\ny'all are cringe\nand you don't realize your cringe\nbecause you haven't really thought a\nlittle bit about the way you're forcing\npeople in into interactions\nyou're not really thinking about the\npassive aggressive crap that you do\nto get people to interact with you\nright\nlike like when someone else is\ncompassionate\nand then they don't respond to your text\nmessage and then you like threaten\nself-harm because they're not responding\nthat is cringe\nyou're forcing them into an interaction\nright you're emotionally manipulative\nso unfortunately this happens all the\ntime\nhappens with random people on the\ninternet happens in families\nhappens when parents do it right when\nthey guilt trip you into coming for the\nholidays like that's cringe they're\nforcing an interaction on you\nso you really need to think long and\nhard are you forcing interactions on\npeople are you letting people leave\ngracefully or do they have to like push\nyou away because that's what happens\nwhen someone is cringe right like the\nperson who's on the receiving end of the\ncringe has one of two options they can\nescalate to the point of being somewhat\ninappropriate and they [ __ ] hate\ndoing doing that because then they seem\ncrazy\nright it's like if someone comes over to\nyou and is like sexually suggested but\nnever says anything wrong and then\nyou're like dude just get away from me\nit's like the other person's like what\nyou're overreacting i didn't say\nanything\nand then you feel like an idiot because\nyou're like yeah like you didn't\nactually say anything\nbut you implied like way too much crap\nfor me to be comfortable with so you\nlike force people this is what cringe\npeople do they like figure this out they\nfigure out like what's the what's that\nsweet gray zone where like they don't\nclearly\nwarrant a rejection\nbut they're like like i'm in the\nuncomfortable face this phase right like\ni'm in i'm like kind of right in the mid\non the border to that boundary\nso you got to be super careful if you\nwere cringe\nask yourself this question do i let\npeople leave the interaction gracefully\nor do they punish them for\nleaving then you could be cringe\nquestions\nabout cringe\nuh so the line between cringe and toxic\nso toxic tends to be like damaging i\ndon't know that cringe is necessarily\ntalk toxic\nso you can have people who are not\ncringe and toxic and people who are\ncringe and not toxic there's like\nsomewhat relatively harmless people now\nit gets blurry because oftentimes when\nyou set a boundary with someone who is\ncringe they will become toxic\nso once like they're like kind of like\nyou know\nuncle billy is like touching you a\nlittle bit too much\nand then you're like uncle billy please\nstop touching me and then uncle billy's\nlike what the hell is wrong with you i'm\nyour uncle\nlike what do you think pervert that's\ntoxicity so sometimes when you reject\nsomeone who's being cringe\nthey will manifest toxicity towards you\nright\nquestions\nno it doesn't even have to be like\nmolesting by the way it's just like\nsome people are just touchy and you're\njust not comfortable with that you know\nit doesn't have to be like sexual it's\njust\ni had an uncle would like to hold my\nelbow\nwhen talking to them they'd like shake\nmy hand and hold my elbow and they'd\nlike just hold the elbow it's like weird\nokay\nso one person is asking so the more\nyou're attached to people or things the\nmore cringe you are sort of so the whole\npoint of cringe is that there's a\ndiscrepancy between how into their face\nyou are and how much license you have to\nbe in their face\nso for example like\nwhen you when you're married right like\nthere's some some interactions which are\nnot cringe because they're like\nacceptable given the level of your\nrelationship\nso there are things that\nyou know\nlike\nthat would be cringe in a different\nrelationship but in a marriage like\nthings are you're allowed to have like\nmore interactions right so it's like i'm\ngonna be around every day for example\nlike like my wife is gonna be around\nevery day like we live in the same house\nwhereas if someone else was like showing\nup that i wasn't married to and was\naround every day like that would be kind\nof cringe and like forcing interactions\ndoes that make sense\nso the more you're in a relationship the\nmore\ncringe behaviors in a sense i mean they\nshouldn't be cringe but the the\nthe forced\nmoves a little bit\nright because there's going to be like\nmore stuff that's like acceptable to do\ngood question\nmarriage sleek less cringe\nyeah so dr k\nyou can take\nyou can take it too far the other way\nand appear cold how do you stop that\nabsolutely\nso\nforcing interactions is cringe and then\nlike being cold is like not having\nenough interaction so how do you stop\nthat the answer is actually the same\nso when you're cold\nchances are you're still thinking a lot\nabout how the interaction is going to go\nand you're just airing on the side of\nbeing like enclosed so we see this a lot\nwith people who are socially anxious\nwhere they'll like kind of come across\nas like cold because they're afraid of\noverstepping\nright so they don't want to be like\nso they end up like just kind of being\nin their own head and the more you're in\nyour own head the colder you're gonna be\nthe more removed you're gonna appear to\nother people because you're not like\nempathically interacting with them\nyou're not attending to their facial\nexpressions their words things like that\nso the more stuck you are in your own\nhead paradoxically you can appear both\ncringe and\nyou can appear cold\nokay\ncan you grow to find cringy things\nthat's not cringe absolutely\nso if we're talking about the internal\nside remember that cringe is essentially\na judgment of the mind right\nso as we become\nless judgmental we can start to\nappreciate things that like other people\nwill regard as cringe so like i'll give\nyou just a simple example so let's say\nthat\ni really\nthere's someone who's dancing\nat a wedding who really doesn't know how\nto dance in watching them a lot of\npeople like oh my god that's so cringe\nwhereas like if you're non-judgmental\nyou're like hey like that person doesn't\nknow how to dance but man they're they\nseem to be having a fantastic time that\nis awesome i'm so happy for them\neven though they're like really don't\nknow how to dance everyone else is like\nright you can be like cool\nperson is is just enjoying themselves\nfantastic\nright it's okay\nthey don't have to be perfect answers\nis there a meditation for cringe we're\ngonna try to make one up right now let\nme think about this\nyeah so i think what we're gonna have to\ndo\nyeah okay i've got a meditation for\ny'all\ny'all are so screwed\nokay\nso this meditation is going to be a\nlittle bit different\nall right\nthis is what we're going to do\nyou guys want a meditation for cringe so\nremember understanding\ncringe\nlet's just so like our solution is going\nto be understanding stuff right so what\ni'm gonna do\ni'm gonna put on headphones and i'm\ngonna start listening to some music\nand while i listen to the music i'm\ngoing to\njust vibe with it\non the internet i have no sense of\nrhythm so dr k is super bad at this kind\nof thing i'm just going to listen to my\nmusic and i'm going to vibe with it\ny'all aren't going to be able to hear it\nbecause what i want you to do is vibe\nwith your own music right so turn on\nsome music and just vibe and people are\nsaying oh my god no no no no no can you\nfeel the cringe coming up and then we're\ngonna sit with that sensation\nokay\nand everyone's like oh my god no no no\nno no no no don't do it don't do it\nright so you feel that cringe arising\nso this is how we're gonna master the\nsensation of cringe we're gonna evoke it\nlearn how to tolerate it right like\nwe're gonna like let it be there we're\ngonna let it wash through us and then\nwe're gonna be like okay at the end\nokay\nall right so i'm gonna put this on i'm\ngonna start vibing\nokay\nthat's great\ni feel so embarrassed\nit's so hard oh my god what have i got\nmyself into okay let's go\ni can feel that cringe coming up\nfeel that cringe\nfeel it\nfeel how idiotic you feel\nand now listen to the music take a deep\nbreath\nfeel the racing of your heart\nso now i'm feeling like i need to move\nmy body more\nand that makes me feel more cringe but\nwe're gonna move move\n[Music]\nenjoy the

great\nso people are wondering\nmeditation for cringe\nso you feel so damn cringe when you're\ndoing like all these people are walked\nwatching you like i don't know how to\ndance like what are they gonna think but\njust like focus on the sensation right\nlike don't focus on the cringe you're\ngonna feel it\nyou're gonna feel it oh my god it feels\nso bad\nand then as you externalize to the sound\nof the music as you let yourself getting\ncaught up in the music and out of your\nmind you'll start to feel better you can\nuse the breath as a tool so big deep\nbreath let it\nand move you know feel that movement\nfeel that music take a big big deep\nbreath in and then breathe out\nnow everyone's wondering what did i\nlisten to\nso i'm debating about whether that's an\nimportant part\nof this or not right so like if you guys\nare thinking about what i listen to\nwhy is that important\nthe question is what are you going to\nlisten to\nright\ni can i have i think my\nplaylists are public\nokay\nso that's phase one of the practice all\nright that's just phase one now\nyou're gonna notice those feelings of\ncringe the more that you get into the\nmusic\nthe more\nyou're going to\nbe okay with the cringe this is still\nplaying okay\nso that's phase number one\nso breathe into it get used to it you\ncan do it on your own if you want to\nnext thing that you're we're gonna do is\nwe're actually gonna do it in front of\nother people so you're gonna go to a\npublic place phase two of the practice\nput on your headphones go to a park\nstart\njamming out other people are gonna see\nyou you're gonna feel super cringe\noh my god\nbut what's i don't know you guys think\ni'm done no no no whoa whoa we're just\ngetting started dude\nright so you're going to go into a\npublic place\nand you're going to jam out to your\nmusic because here's the cool thing\nyou're going to discover something\nawesome is that you can enjoy that song\njust as much if there are other people\naround\nright no no no no no no no you guys want\nto learn real meditation right don't you\nwant to learn like real meditation so\nnow that we've practiced at home we're\ngoing to do this three times at home\nwe're going to go out to public we're\ngoing to walk down the street we're\ngoing to jam to our music\nwe're gonna jam\nyou know people are gonna be looking at\nus you're gonna look at you're gonna\nphase three you ready for you ready for\nthis phase three\nyou like you're gonna be jamming out\nyou're gonna make eye contact with\nsomeone you'll be like yeah what's up\nyou're gonna be like\nand just walk right past\neye contact\npump the shoulders and move right past\nthat's it that's it y'all got me\nright that's what we're gonna do so\nphase three you're like you're gonna\nacknowledge to other people like i know\nyou see me i see you i'm vibing having\nthe time of my life that's how it is\nhi hi dancing juice\nnot right now\nthank you you're open\nall right\nthat's phase three so if you guys really\nwant to overcome cringe if people are\nsaying like okay how do i overcome\ncringe this is meditation to do it so\nyou're gonna use your tools of\nmeditation grounding yourself in the\nbreath do practices at home right so you\nshould do naughty shodana and like ohm\nchanting and all that crap\nand then let yourself get lost in the\nmusic focus all of your attention on the\nmusic feel the music let it come out\nthrough your body\ndo it at home first you're going to feel\na little bit cringe you're going to\nbreathe your way through it next you're\ngoing to do it in public you're going to\nfeel even more cringe but now you've\npracticed you've lifted those light\nweights so now this is a heavier weight\nbut you're going to be ready for it your\nmind is going to be ready for it you're\ngoing to feel terrible and then\nsomething magical is gonna happen as you\nwork through that cringe you're gonna\nfeel amazing\nbecause now the other the opinions of\nother people are no longer holding you\nback you're not dictating your life\nbased on what other people think because\ndictating your life based on what other\npeople think is a terrible way to live\nlife\nyou're gonna be you\nand that's totally fine you're\ncompletely comfortable with it\nside effect building confidence\nthree\ncan you can sit on a park bench you can\nclose your eyes for phase two you just\nvibe a little bit people can walk by\nthey can judge you a little bit let them\njudge you\nphase three\neyes open baby walking down the street\nmake eye contact\nright that's what that's what we're\ngoing to do you're going to smile at\npeople and you're going to move on\nright you're not going to force any kind\nof interaction you're not going to talk\nto him because here's the thing\nthere's some crazy dumb ass who's\nlistening to music jamming out looks at\nyou smiles and nods their head who do\nyou think is more embarrassed\nwho do you think is like\nlike other people can't handle that but\nthey're gonna i guarantee you will make\nsomeone's day they won't even understand\nwhat the hell is going on and you will\nmake their day because for a moment\nthey're going to feel embarrassed\nthey're going to feel accepted they're\ngoing to feel like this guy's such an\nidiot but they're so like it's just like\npure positive energy\nit's amazing\nyou guys get that\nlike\nthis is this\nis\nback when while dr k walked the streets\nof boston sometimes a while dr k would\ndo this to people\nright you're just going to live your\nlife you're going to look at other\npeople you're going to make contact\nyou're going to smile you're going to do\nyour thing you're going to move on and\nfor that moment in time i can guarantee\nyou\ni can guarantee you that in that moment\nin time it there will be like a moment\nof happiness for another human being\nlike this person's so crazy but in that\nmoment they will forget about their\nstudent loans they will forget about\ntheir breakup they will forget about you\nknow\nhow they need to study for their tests\nfor one moment in time you will give\nthem such a gift\nand then you're just gonna move on with\nyour life they're gonna be like what the\nhell was that i don't even know you're\ngonna leave like what the\nand that's it that's phase number three\nokay this is a meditation for cringe\nwho are we rating chat\nthis has been such a painful idea to\nthink about what the hell that's the\nwhole point\nit's a meditation on cringe like what do\nyou think we're going to be\nacademic about it and be like hey my god\nthis is cringe\nthis is the natures of cringe this is\nhow we classify the cringe there are\nthree attributes of cringe there's this\nfunds this one's then your mind is like\noh yeah okay cool i understand cringe\nnow great\ni'm more knowledgeable\ngood job me\nno we have to like\nlive it right so meditation is about\nexperience that is what the real self is\nto feel that cringe within you and work\nthrough it as opposed to like armchair\nquarterbacking i'ma watch a youtube\nvideo about cringe and then i'm gonna\nwatch 10 more but i'm never gonna\nactually face the emotions inside me and\nnever gonna adjust my behavior instead i\nwill watch youtube videos instead of\nmaking alterations to my life\nno\nfeel the cringe on your skin absolutely\nlive it embrace it work your way through\nit and then be free of it\nyou"
