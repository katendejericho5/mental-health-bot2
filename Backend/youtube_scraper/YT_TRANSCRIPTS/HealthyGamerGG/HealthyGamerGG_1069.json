    "transcript": "so this person is describing a situation\nin which they are continuously\nlosing battles\nand i am basically making the suggestion\nor hypothesis that you may be losing\nbattles but over time you will win the\nwar\nso our first post today is more\nempathetic and selfless people always\nget screwed rant\nhow do you deal with the fact that\nselfish narcissistic people always end\nup on top how do you deal with conflicts\nwith people like this i know this is a\nfact of life but it frustrates me that\nthe people who are empathetic who\ngenuinely try to understand others and\nresolve conflicts and consider others\nwell-being in perspective get screwed\nover every single time\nbecause whoever is more selfless will\nfold first in every argument will make\nsacrifices in exchange for nothing\nwhile whoever is more self-centered and\nless considerate will take and take\neverything they can get with no remorse\nbecause they care less about you than\ntheir capacity to hold a grudge and be a\ndick in general is so much higher\nwhen they feel attacked even by the\npolite suggestion not even an accusation\nthey go into fight mode and will do\neverything to defend themselves and\nattack you with no chance of empathy\nuntil they win the argument they will\nnever admit they're wrong or apologize\nif you get into an argument with them\nbased on my experience your two choices\nare to try to get them to have a\nrational conversation from a place of\ncompassion pretty much a laughable idea\nhas never worked or to out attack them\nin an argument also never works because\ni'm unable to and they're probably\nunconsciously used to\ngetting their way no matter how long you\nkeep pushing forward they will never\nlisten and just hate you even more\nthey can make you feel like absolute\ncrap even when you're in the right but\nnothing you say will ever make them feel\nbad for hurting you because it doesn't\neven register to them\neven when you finally stop letting them\nwalk all over you and set boundaries\nthey will see you as the villain so\nyou're literally [ __ ] no matter what\nyou do you're guaranteed to feel awful\nwhile they get off scot-free i believe\nthat more empathetic people who try to\nhave logical and rational conversations\nare objectively better people but boy do\ni wish sometimes i could be on the other\nside of things and be able to just\nattack someone remorselessly in in\narguments my ability to hold a grudge or\nto be angry at someone even who did\nsomething truly awful to me is so low\nthat i just get exhausted after like one\nday max and try to apologize because i\ncan't handle the arguing\ni want nothing more than to get these\npeople to try to see my perspective for\na couple of seconds and have a rational\nconversation from a place of compassion\nbut it's just never going to happen with\nthis type of person to be honest i don't\nthink i've ever won an argument with\nanyone\nedit yes i know this post is somewhat\nirrational and written in an angry\nspiteful tone i did not expect this many\npeople to read it but i also i also know\ni'm partly to blame in that that just\ndon't\ninteract as the best advice\ni'd do that if i could but the situation\ni was thinking of while writing\nthis is one\nis one this person forced me into and i\ncannot leave or avoid them i was\nfrustrated because i feel powerless they\nescalated things more than just a petty\nwork dispute and i have no choice but to\nengage and lose\ndamn\nokay\nso\nfirst thing to point out yeah so this\nperson is like you know did a good job\nof recognizing this is a little bit of a\nrant they did a good job of recognizing\nthat it's like written in the spiteful\nand angry tone like that's actually\ntotally fine right so i think it's\ntotally fine to be spiteful and angry\num and as long as you kind of recognize\nit right you're allowed to rant on our\nsubreddit about whatever you want to and\nand thankfully i think people here were\nreally really nice and and offered a lot\nof good suggestions\num so let's kind of start with this\nperson's basic premise which is how do\nyou deal with the fact that selfish\nnarcissistic people always end up on top\nso let's start with actually the\nquestion do selfish narcissistic people\nalways end up on top there's actually\nbeen research about this i wasn't able\nto find a really good reference in a in\na short time span but\nthere is actually a lot of research that\ngoes into whether empathy is actually\nlike a vulnerability and there's there\nhave been studies that show that\nempathic people are like more likely to\nbe taken advantage of and that it\nactually can like screw you over like\nbeing empathic is not a straight up\nadvantage it can actually be a\nvulnerability that can lead to a greater\namount of suffering and essentially like\nlosing more often\nso if you look at society we have a\nspectrum of you know at one end of the\nspectrum we have people who are\nsociopaths so completely incapable of\nempathy\nand on the other end of the spectrum we\nhave people who are very very empathic\nand oftentimes get taken advantage of\nand so is this person's premise that the\nempathic people always lose\nis that premise correct\nwell i wouldn't say that they always\nlose and we'll kind of get to that in a\nsecond but i do think there's actually\ndecent evidence that\nempathy can be seen as a vulnerability\nand people who are more empathic than\nothers\nsometimes get the short end of the stick\nand\nwill get taken advantage of\nso like i think there's actually like a\nsolid kernel of truth in this person's\nbasic grief\nwhich is that it sucks to be empathic\nand the narcissists always win\nso that being said\num i don't really know that\nit's been my experience that generally\nspeaking being empathic is a net\npositive so the truth is that you\nprobably want to be somewhere in the\nmiddle or be able to turn on or off\nempathy\num\nyou know kind of you should be in\ncontrol of your empathy and like like\nwhen to be empathic and when not to be\nempathic\nso i think that one of the the trickiest\nthings that empaths deal with or people\nwho are high on the empathy scale deal\nwith is how to effectively set\nboundaries so there's a tension between\ncompassion and setting a boundary\nand so this is also where like you know\nthere's a there's an increasing interest\nin the domain of eq which is emotional\nquotient which we'll also be talking\nabout in a couple of the other posts so\nthere's a there's evidence that shows\nthat like being more emotionally\nintelligent which generally speaking\nnarcissists are not very good at\ncan actually lead to a lot of like\npositive things so the ability to\nunderstand people the ability to you\nknow understand your own emotions\nrecognize what you're feeling so even\nthis person sort of indicates the fact\nthat like they kind of say in the title\ni know this is a rant i know i'm being\nirrational\neven that degree of understanding of\nyour own perspective actually over time\nwill correlate with like better outcomes\nin life because you know what you're\nfeeling\nright so let's let's take this on the\nflip side of your your call work\ncolleague apparently who's very\nnarcissistic does not take feedback well\nand basically proves you wrong anytime\nyou try to make a suggestion\nso if this person is not willing to\naccept suggestions to improve then\nchances are they will be far far less\neffective over time than you will right\nso like if the person is not willing to\nlearn from their mistakes because they\nhave a narcissistic defense mechanism\nthey're just not going to get better at\nthe rate that people who are willing to\naccept feedback from other people are\ngoing to get better so they're going to\nstay stagnant they may have a couple of\ndifferent moves on their pokemon which\nare really strong but their pokemon will\nnever evolve\non the on the flip side you know you may\nnot have the best moves for an\nindividual engagement but as you\ncontinue to\nlike take feedback from people become\nself-aware over time you will actually\nwin that game\num so this is kind of the other thing to\nkind of point out which is that you're\ntalking about winning and losing which i\nthink there's a hefty amount of your own\nego in there so we'll get to that in a\nsecond\nbut what is this person like what is the\ncost of victory like what are the spoils\nof victory and what is the cost of\nvictory you may feel like this person is\nwinning all the time because they're not\nwilling to accept your feedback they\nattack you there may be a work situation\nin which they're making you look bad all\nthat stuff could be true but i think\nthat over time this situation that\nyou're describing is gonna benefit you\nmore than that it may not be the\nsituation the the person is gonna you\nknow i would rather take your\nstats than their stats\nand so you know i know it sounds kind of\nweird but like if you just look at over\ntime you know the way that you evolve in\nthis situation the way that they evolve\nlike your ability to accept feedback\nyour ability to over time make the right\nmoves will probably end up with you in a\nbetter place than than they are\nso the next thing that we're going to\ntalk a little bit about is\num\nyou know like this sort of idea that\nlet me just think about how to say this\nso this person is describing the\nsituation in which they are continuously\nlosing battles\nand i am basically making the suggestion\nor hypothesis that you may be losing\nbattles but over time you will win the\nwar and why is that it's because in my\nexperience working with narcissistic\npeople and i have a lot of experience\nworking with narcissistic people\neven though they may win a particular\nencounter they're not happy about it\nthey're certainly not carefree because\nremember that like they're perceiving\nany kind of polite suggestion as a\npersonal attack so your desires to help\nthem are actually like incredibly\nhurtful to them and they're going\nthrough life with a lot of internal pain\nuh so i i don't really i know that you\nhave this perception that like\nnarcissists are like carefree but like\nif they were carefree they would be able\nto receive like feedback without going\ninto attack mode\nright the fact that they're so\nvulnerable to your attacks which are\npolite suggestions that get turned into\nattacks and then they go into defensive\nmode and attack you actually speaks to a\nvery very deep insecurity which they're\ntrying to struggle with all the time\nand instead of actually accepting the\nsuggestions that you're making to help\nthem you know do better and then be\nsecure because they're actually doing a\nbetter job because they're taking your\nsuggestions to heart\nwhat they end up doing is like defending\nagainst your attack not taking it\ncontinuing to underperform below like\nwhat they could be able to\nat the level at which they should be\nable to perform if they accepted\nfeedback and that then reinforces their\ninsecurity and makes them like more like\nprickly when it comes to suggestions so\nit's absolutely a self-defeating cycle\nfrom their perspective as well\ni don't know how much consolation that\nis to you because it seems like you know\nyour life kind of sucks in this\nsituation which i totally get\nso the other thing that i i kind of want\nto point out is like there may be plays\nfor you to make here\nso the first is that a lot of people\nwill say that you know if you're dealing\nwith a narcissist the best solution is\nto just leave and i think that actually\nis a very good solution and there are\nways that you can even do that in a\nworkplace environment that can be like\nreally really\nhealthy and positive for you so i'm\ngonna make a couple of assumptions here\nthe first is that i'm going to assume\nthat you can't escape this person\nthe second assumption i'm going to make\nis that this person actually\nattacks you or does not accept criticism\nin a public way that is visible to other\npeople that you work with\ntherefore you have the perception that\nthis person appears more competent than\nyou are okay so let's just assume that\nthey're fighting public battles that\nmake you look bad and make them look\ncompetent because you can't outmaneuver\nthem in an argument\nso there's actually some interesting uh\nthere's some interesting suggestions\nhere as well so this is the kind of\nsituation where\nif this person is doing this with you\nthere's a really really really good\nchance they're doing it with other\npeople so if this person is narcissistic\nit's kind of like you know they're not\njust going to be narcissistic with you\nthey're going to be narcissistic with\neveryone they're going to be competitive\nwith everyone and this is where we're\ngoing to be a little bit sneaky and use\nthat against them so this is where you\nbe sneaky don't argue with them just\nstart having private conversations with\nyour fellow co-workers or even your boss\nand sort of point out this person's\nbehavior to other people you're going to\nkind of shit-talk them\nyou're going to go to your boss and\nyou're going to say hey i don't know if\nyou noticed what happened in the meeting\ni'm a little bit curious what was your\nperception of\nwhat happened in today's meeting\nand and the boss may say oh you lost an\nargument\num and\nabsolutely talk [ __ ] behind their back\nso but that's not what the boss is going\nto say they're going to notice that oh\nlike this person like you know\nyou you'd be surprised at how\nsensitive other people are to\nnarcissistic attacks like people are not\ngoing to think that you're just losing\narguments right and left they're\nprobably going to realize that this\nperson is kind of like not the easiest\nto work with then you're going to go to\nyour boss and you're going to say yeah\nso you know i noticed that this person i\nmade this suggestion because and this is\nwhere you need to frame things for the\nbenefit of the company or your job so i\nnoticed that this person for example\nlike doesn't ever shred medical\ninformation\nand i know that at this hospital we are\ncommitted to protecting patient privacy\nwhich is why i sort of suggested and\neven tried to like point out to them\nthat i can get them a shredder if that's\na problem i'm happy to try to make\nthings convenient and easy for them but\nthey seem to like shut down the\nsuggestion and felt like very personally\nattacked\ni'm not sure how to protect patient\nprivacy when i'm working with someone\nwho is like so against this kind of goal\nand is taking things personally\ngo to your boss say this to them and say\ncan you please help me understand like\nhow i should work with this person like\nbecause i'm really struggling go to your\nco-workers and you can also mention to\nthem\nhey i'm really having difficulty working\nwith this person\num i'm curious have you had difficulty\ndo you have any suggestions and this is\nreally great because like over time\nwhat's going to happen is one of two\nthings is going to happen it's kind of a\nwin-win here okay\none is that they say yeah i really have\ndifficulty dealing with this person too\nthey're a complete [ __ ] and then you\nguys laugh about that commiserate about\nthat the next time that they attack you\nin a meeting you're gonna make eye\ncontact with your colleague that you had\nthe conversation with and you're going\nto roll your eyes which is going to piss\noff the narcissistic person because\nthey're going to recognize that that's\nsomething that is disrespectful and then\nthey will attack you further and then\nyou're just going to be calm and say\ni'm a little bit confused is is\nsomething wrong\nand the more that you remain neutral the\nmore that you don't engage with them the\nmore you're just they're going to\nimplode and you're just going to be\nsitting there and like when you get the\nopportunity you're just going to make\neye contact with people around the room\nand if you really want to go for the\nyou know the sucker punch you can even\nin the middle of the meeting turn to\nyour boss and say this is exactly what\ni'm talking about\ni'm trying to be respectful and i\nhaven't even said anything in this\nperson like in a public meeting in front\nof your boss say this is exactly what\ni'm talking about i'm having difficulty\nlearning how to like communicate with\nthis person in a professional manner ask\nyour boss then and there do you have any\nsuggestions because i'd love to try to\nimprove this situation\npublicly\nin the room\ncall attention to it if you really want\nto do that and you will completely knock\nthem flat on their feet\nright because what does anyone say at\nthat point like\nwhat does your boss say does your boss\nsay oh yeah this is your fault because\nyour narcissistic colleague is going\nconstantly on the attack\nor your narcissistic colleague is like\nyeah you should do this and you should\ndo this and you should do this and you\nshould do this\nand then you kind of turn to them you\nsay okay thank you for the feedback um\nyou know i i do those things i've spoken\nwith you in a respectful tone i haven't\ndone anything to attack you\nyou know i don't know where this is\ncoming from\nand like just\nthe narcissistic person will implode and\njust let them implode it's okay like\nthis is the key thing you've got to\nunderstand if you've got high eq and\nsomeone is narcissistic and can't\ncontrol their reactions\nyou can bait them if you really want to\nso you can do that right so like i'm not\nsaying that you actually do all of those\nthings but you should absolutely have a\nconversation with your boss where you\nthink a little bit about you know what\nyour goals at this job are how this\nperson is making it difficult and if you\nare not only is your colleague not\naccepting feedback you are openly asking\nfor feedback you are openly going to\nyour boss and other people and saying\nhey i'm trying to make this situation\nwork please help me\nand the more that you kind of do that\nlike how can you be blamed for that\nright like you can't really be blamed\nfor that\num and so like this is the kind of thing\nwhere you know people think that\nnarcissists win in these sorts of\nsituations and that's simply because\nwe're never taught like how to play the\ngame against narcissists so they like\npull you into a particular dynamic that\nis beneficial for them and as long as\nyou adopt a defeatist attitude and we're\ngonna kind of go here real quick right\nbecause i think this is a problem\ni have no choice but to engage and lose\nyeah so like take a page from sun tzu's\nart of war like don't fight the battle\nthat you're gonna lose fight the battle\nthat you're gonna win\nand so that can be\ncultivating support from other\ncolleagues it can be talking to your\nboss you're not trying to actually like\ndestroy this person right it's not\nmalice that i'm suggesting it's just\ngenuinely like how do you work with this\nperson you find the other people in the\noffice that you can positively work with\nthe people that find this person\nannoying you talk to your boss so that\nyou're kind of signal to your boss hey\ni'm trying to make this happen\nit's totally fine and then the other\nthing that you can start doing is is\ngetting into a position of leaving\num and then once you you may not be able\nto leave right away but chances are\nover time you will have some degree of\nfreedom right and this is where you may\nthink you're not able to leave but\nreally what's stopping you so i'd polish\nup your resume start applying to other\nplaces and you can also circle back with\nyour boss after a couple months and say\nhey this like situation is really not\nworking well for me um i'm trying to\nmake things work with this person and\ni'm not so sure that i want to stick\naround and i know a lot of people will\nsay like don't let your boss know like\nwhat you're thinking\nthere's a big a lot of this in the\nanti-work kind of subreddit movement but\ni think there are good bosses out there\nand you have to figure out is your boss\na good boss or not a good boss then\ncircle back with your boss and just say\nlike hey i don't really you know i'm\ntrying to do a good job here but i find\nit very difficult to work with this\nperson and so you know i'm not saying\nthat\nyou know they need to go but i just\nwanted to let you know that i'm like\nseriously considering moving on\nand you know say just ask your boss what\ndo you think about that right so like\nlet them know and just like ask for\ntheir opinion\nand they say yeah you know if you're\nreally thinking about moving on like you\nshould move on and then cool so now you\nunderstand right then what you do is you\nlet's like you tell your co-workers that\nyou formed somewhat of an alliance with\nand you can say hey i just wanted to let\ny'all know i was thinking about leaving\nbecause i have difficulty working with\nthis person i talked to boss about it\nthey thought it may be a good idea if i\nleave\nif you know if you all are also\ninterested in leaving or have thought\nabout it i'd love to have a conversation\nwith you\nand then you start looking for other\njobs because the truth of the matter is\nthat narcissists drive people away\nand so here's the long-term victory plan\nfor empaths versus narcissists\nin this world there are givers and\ntakers and this sort of situation\nsort of you're screwed if you're a giver\nwith a taker but if two givers meet\ntogether and they're able to form some\nkind of relationship their relationship\nwill be superior to two takers so give\nher versus take her take her wins give\nher loses take her versus taker it's\nkind of like even\nand giver plus giver is also even but it\ntends to be superior to take a plus\ntaker so over time what you want to do\nis cultivate the right kinds of people\nin your life and set boundaries and this\nis where like you may think oh my god\nthe narcissist won because i left\nand like that's all ego like your ego is\nabs absolutely like active here too and\nif you guys want to see this\nlet's pretend for a moment that this\nperson is narcissist\nhow do you deal with the fact that\nselfish narcissistic people always end\nup on top this is an incredibly\nnarcissistic question\nright oh like the world is rigged\nagainst me and even though i am a good\nperson the rest of the world is crap\nit frustrates me that the good people\nare the ones that get screwed\nwho genuinely try to understand and\nresolve other conflicts and consider\nother people's well-being get screwed\nover every single time such a\nnarcissistic statement you guys get this\nright like this is exactly what a\nnarcissist would post\nso like this is the kind of i'm not\ncalling this person narcissist i don't\nthink they are i think this is uh i\nthink they're demonstrating a lot of\ngood insight which you would not see\nfrom a narcissist so like this stuff\nover here\nthey're kind of acknowledging that like\ni i recognize what i'm saying is\nrational narcissists don't believe that\nright they believe they are rational and\nit's written in an angry uh spiteful\ntone\ni i was frustrated because i feel\npowerless this is not something a\nnarcissist would say\nmy point is that remember that\nnarcissism is a defense mechanism it is\na function of the ego and the ego arises\nany time we get attacked right so this\nis all i'm not going to go into all the\ndetail here but if you guys check out\nthe vedic psychology lecture in dr k's\nguide you will see like this all of this\nwill be laid out if you guys have a\nproblem with your ego if this happens to\nyou\nwhere when you feel hurt you start to\nbecome narcissistic if you want to\nunderstand this it's laid out really\nwell there so definitely check that out\nbut we can definitely see the\nnarcissistic defense even here right\nso just to kind of summarize this is a\nsituation where over time if you are an\nempathic person\nyou will actually uh\nbe\nyou there is truth that if you are an\nempathic person you will be taken\nadvantage of by people who are\nnarcissistic\nthis is absolutely true\nand so over time what you want to do is\njust cultivate the right kinds of\nrelationships learn to set healthy\nboundaries right and this is the kind of\nthing where like i'm not suggesting you\nengage with this person you don't even\ntry to make them understand because\nthey've demonstrated to you time and\ntime and time again that they are not\nwilling to listen so you should just\nstop just go to everyone else\nand then like over time as they as you\nactivate their narcissistic defense\nmechanism you are just going to double\ndown in terms of maneuvering around them\nand like the more upset they get they\nmay even come at you like hard they may\ntry to sabotage you or something like\nthat so be careful\nbut i think it's totally fine to you\nknow not do anything with them publicly\njust go to your different colleagues and\nyou can decide how sadistic you want to\nbe and how much you want to punish them\nand if you want to give in to that\nhungry beast inside you that feels\nwronged you can roll your eyes make\ncontact in a public meeting call them\nout and be nothing but professional and\nwork towards you know the company's\ngoals and then they're gonna they're\ngonna go insane they're gonna explode\nit's totally fine you can do that if you\nwant to i wouldn't recommend it\num you know\ni wouldn't recommend it i don't think\nthat that's that's accumulating some\namount of negative karma even if it's\nvery very satisfying so i think that\nit's always better to not attack other\npeople even if you can demolish them\nright so like that's just not\nwhat i think you should do\nso over time\nyou know what you want to be really\ncareful about is cultivating the right\nkind of\nuh\nrelationships and so this particular job\nmay not have a boss that is sympathetic\nto you may not have co-workers that are\nsympathetic to you this particular job\nmay have a boss who says oh they're\nsuper productive so we're going to\ntolerate their bad behavior which is why\nyou need to move firms right because\nthere are going to be places where that\nkind of stuff isn't tolerated there are\ngoing to be places where\nbosses will fire the bad apple no matter\nhow productive they are\nand so we see this a lot like i think\nfor example\nin investment banking there's like a\nheavy heavy bias\ntowards like it doesn't matter how you\nact it just matters how well you work\nand so you can be kind of an [ __ ]\nthere's a perception that's what all\ninvestment banks are like the good news\nis that's actually changing quite\nrapidly and now there are a lot of\npeople who are starting to value\num\nyou know like work-life balance and like\nyou know positive environments and\nthey're attracting people and have\nactually far lower turnover this is the\nbig thing that i was working with\nsomeone very high up in an investment\nbank and i was trying to like advocate\nfor them to like create a better\ncorporate culture and the reason why is\nbecause their turnover is ridiculously\nhigh like you guys can be signing deals\nright and left but you're losing out on\nso many more deals because your turnover\nis through the roof\nand the reason your turnover is through\nthe roof is because you have a\nprestigious name people come here\nand\nthe the nice ones leave like the team\nplayers leave and then you're left with\na bunch of sharks and that's why you get\nlike problems at the lowest levels the\nmiddle levels and hard level it's a\nshark culture\nso over time you know i'm not saying you\nhave to leave your job now\nbut i think you can definitely maneuver\nto dismantle this person if you really\nwant to\nand also if the dismantling doesn't work\nyou move to a place where there are\nother people who are more like empathic\nand supportive\nmake sense\nyou"
