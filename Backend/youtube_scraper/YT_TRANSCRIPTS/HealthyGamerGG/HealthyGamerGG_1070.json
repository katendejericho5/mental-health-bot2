    "transcript": "remember we reviewed the comorbidity\ndata which suggested that people who\nmaladaptive Daydream have a very lot\nHigh likelihood of other psychiatric\nillnesses so does that mean that it is a\nnew illness\nwhich is completely independent from\nthese other illnesses no\nso I want to talk to you all today about\nsomething called maladaptive daydreaming\nwhich we've seen a lot of so someone\nposted this five months ago addicted to\ndaydreaming I've never experienced\nboredom in my life\nmy addiction to daydreaming is ruining\nmy life I'm struggling with maladaptive\ndaydreaming every waking day I I have I\nspend three or more hours obsessively\ndaydreaming about\nthis perfect me achieving the stupidly\nimpossible goal that will never actually\nhappen this escapism of mine is is out\nof control being addicted to daydreaming\naddicted to self-improvement while not\nimproving it's a little bit different\nhi Dr K what are your thoughts about\nmaladaptive daydreaming\nso this is something that's huge within\nour community you guys can kind of say\nthat this is like you know there's a\npost on this every couple weeks to\nmonths\num and and the truth is that maladaptive\ndaydreaming is is something of a new\nphenomenon\num\nand let me see if I can find a good uh\nso that like people are not exactly sure\nso maladaptive daydreaming is a newly\nproposed\nmental disorder characterized by\nexcessive Vivid fantasy activity\nimpairing functioning\num we'll get to the the rest in a second\nso today I'd like to talk to you all\nabout maladaptive daydreaming so this is\ngoing to be a little bit more of an\nacademic talk okay so what I mean by\nthat is we're going to go into a lot of\ndifferent papers we're going to talk\nabout a lot of Neuroscience we're going\nto talk about some fundamental\nprinciples of psychology and psychiatry\nin clinical medicine and diagnosis and\nthen we'll also talk a little bit about\nyou know how to weave this together so\nwhat is the Neuroscience of maladaptive\ndaydreaming how does it manifest why\ndoes it manifest what are the issues at\nPlay Why is it happening why is it\nhappening now more than ever why does it\nhappen potentially in our population in\nour community more than potentially\nother populations in other communities\nand then finally potentially what to do\nabout it\nso the first thing that I want to start\nout is by talking to you all a little\nbit about the way that a psychiatric\ndiagnosis works okay\nso in Psychiatry when I say that you\nknow someone has depression do you\nunderstand what we mean by that like\nwhat is depression do you all know\nokay so someone's saying checks all the\nboxes okay\nso this is the first thing to understand\nabout psychiatric illness so people are\nhypothesizing that maladaptive\ndaydreaming is a new diagnosis\nso before we kind of get into it a\nlittle bit further\num\nwe have to understand what the nature of\na psychiatric diagnosis is so if I say\nthat someone has an anxiety disorder\nor has a depressive disorder\nor has OCD\nthe first thing that I want you all to\nunderstand are ADHD let's do that\nactually that's a good one the first\nthing that I want you all to understand\nis that none of these are like real\nthings they're not objects or\nConsequences they're not objects they're\nwhat we call in medicine we call them\nsyndromes\nso syndromes are collections\nof observable criteria\nand what that means is that is someone\nin chat put it they check the boxes so\nin order to have an anxiety disorder or\na depressive disorder you have to check\ntwo out of these three boxes and so any\ngiven person may check slightly\ndifferent boxes so depression is not it\ndoesn't exist the same in every single\nperson it's a constellation of symptoms\nthat we kind of lump together\nand then we say you have this thing\nbut we're not really it's not like a\nphysical illness like let's say I have\nheart failure so in heart failure for\nexample there's a discrete problem where\nthe heart is not pumping enough right so\nif I have something called congestive\nheart failure that means that my heart\nhas become overly congested and is not\nable to pump effectively because of this\nthing called starling's law\nso in in Physical Medicine we have like\ndiscrete you know diagnoses that like\nactually exist and you can biopsy them\nyou can x-ray them you can MRI them Etc\nbut in mental health for example\nwe don't really have those we have\nsyndromes and so it's not like I can\nactually biopsy someone or x-ray someone\nor do a blood test with someone and\ndiscover that they have depression it's\ndo they check enough boxes and sometimes\nin Psychiatry things get really really\nconfusing because you can also have\nsomething called an anxious depression\nso you can actually have an illness that\npulls a couple of boxes from anxiety\nand pulls a couple of boxes from\ndepression\nand so does this person have anxiety\nplus depression or do they have an\nanxious depression do they have two\ndiscrete neurological processes or\npsychiatric processes going on or do\nthey have one process going on in their\nbrain that looks like these two sets of\nconstellations right so if I have like\ndots\nand you know is this is this something\nthat looks\n[ __ ] I'm screwed up\nright is this something that looks like\nan A or is it a square or what like what\nis this are these five dots a square or\nan a well well certain both and neither\nthere are just five dots and so if I'm\nlooking for a square I can find a square\nbut if I'm looking for an a I can find\nan A too but the dots is what's real\nthe A and the square or the\nconstellations or syndromes that we kind\nof apply on top of them are you guys\ngetting this\ndoes this make sense\nso now we're going to get to this\nconcept of maladaptive daydreaming as a\nnew diagnosis so what maladaptive\ndaydreaming is\nis essentially this like syndrome where\npeople will Daydream for hours at a time\nto the point where it starts to impair\ntheir function they can't concentrate\nthey can't focus on school work they're\nnot able to work they're not even able\nsometimes to have fun and play video\ngames or engage in relationships so they\nDaydream so much and so often that\nimpairs them from doing other things in\nlife\nso let's try to understand what's going\non in the neuroscience\nof maladaptive daydreaming\nokay\nand so this is where I'm going to start\nby saying the short answer is we don't\nknow but there are some really\ninteresting things that some Studies\nhave taught us so let's take a look at\nsome\num\nlet's take a look at some studies okay\nso this is a study that's looking at the\ncomorbidity of daydreaming Disorder so\nwhat this means is that if I have\nsomeone who has maladaptive daydreaming\nwhat other illnesses are they likely to\nhave\nand so when you do structured interviews\nso\num so what this means is that 74 of\npeople met criteria for three additional\ndisorders that is insane\n41 of uh people met criteria for four\nso 76.9 percent of people met criteria\nfor ADHD\nthis is nuts right so if I take someone\nwhat is that 76.9 percent\nthis means that if I take someone with\nmaladaptive Daydream if I take a hundred\npeople with maladaptive daydreaming and\nI test them for ADHD\n76.9 percent will have ADHD okay so for\nanxiety\nthe number is 71.8 percent\nokay\nand um\nyeah so we're going to just focus on\nthose two right now okay so what this\nsort of means is that if you look at\nmaladaptive daydreaming there is a very\nhigh comorbidity with ADHD and we know\nthat the brains of people with ADHD are\nsomewhat different and I've go into that\nin a lot of detail if you look at the\nADHD and addiction and ADHD and\ndepression video okay so there's a high\ncomorbidity which tells me that when you\nwere talking about maladaptive and\ndaydreaming it's not an A or a square\nthis is a sort of situation where\nthere's a lot of shared points does that\nmake sense and we when we look at\nanxiety there's a lot of shared points\nso this is sort of a situation where if\nI String these together in this way I\nend up with anxiety if I String them\ntogether this way I end up with\nmaladaptive daydreaming so I can make\nall kinds of shapes or I can make a\nhouse\nso we as we as we'll see that there are\nother things kind of going on as well so\nmaladaptive daydreaming dissociation and\ndissociative disorders\nso when it comes to dissociation and\nTrauma\nthere's a very tight comorbidity here as\nwell where\num you know people who have a lot of\ndissociation also tend to have uh\nmaladaptive daydreaming and there's also\nsimilarities with OCD\nokay so now this is kind of weird\nbecause we have you know very high\ncomorbidity with this let's say like I\nforget what the number is I think OCD\nwas like 50 right\nand dissociation and Trauma I'm not sure\nexactly what the number is there but it\ntends to be high\nso now the question is like let's just\nthink about this for a second okay does\nthat mean that people are running around\nwith ADHD and maladaptive daydreaming\nand maladaptive daydreaming and anxiety\nso these two separate discrete processes\nis this an a brand new diagnosis which\nis completely different from the things\nthat we've seen before\nand this is where my take is that not\nreally so I think what we're we're\nstarting to see and here's how I'd put\nit so let's like think about what\ndaydreaming is\nso daydreaming\nis kind of getting lost in fantasy right\nit's not being able to focus\nwhich in turn means you're kind of\nlosing track\nof where you are\nokay does this make sense to people\nuh people are saying sounds like ADHD\nand this is where\nokay so if this is how we Define\ndaydreaming\nwhat my hypothesis is is that ADHD and\nlet's say dissociation\ncan both get here\nright so there's some circuits in the\nbrain\nso there's like dissociation circuitry\nand there's a tensional circuitry\nand both of these circuits if you have a\nproblem in either of these circuits you\ncan have this emergent phenomenon of\nmaladaptive daydreaming does that make\nsense\nso you could have problems with your\nattention so the reason that I get lost\nin daydreaming is because I have\ndifficulty focusing on particular things\nso if my mind is unable to focus\nwhat that means is that I can get\ndistracted and lost into daydreaming\nvery easily but on the flip side that's\none way to get to daydreaming but you\ndon't have to get to daydreaming through\nthe unable to focus route the other way\nyou can get through to daydreaming is\nthrough dissociation so my brain is\nprone to dissociate and separate from\nwhat I'm doing in this particular time\nit's not necessarily that I can't focus\nit's just that the dissociation circuits\nof my brain are highly active so I wind\nup daydreaming because I dissociate from\nwhere I am in time and space\nand then maybe there's something with\nanxiety or OCD\nwhich also is like a third track which\ncan kind of lead to daydreaming okay so\ndaydreaming in in my kind of limited\nexperience and especially after looking\nthrough the the neuroscience and stuff\nlike that I think is an emergent\nphenomenon that can come from many\ndifferent kinds of brains okay and so\nlike\nI think that you can sort of have this\nis why we see so much maladaptive\ndaydreaming and sort of why it's been\nlost as a diagnosis thus far is because\npeople end up getting diagnosed with\nADHD they end up getting diagnosed with\nthis uh anxiety or trauma or OCD and so\nthe daydreaming sort of gets lost within\nthese other diagnoses\nI don't know that it is a purely its own\nkind of unique process going on in the\nbrain I would rather you know sort of\nsuggest that it is an emergent\nphenomenon that is coming out of the\nneural circuitry of these other kinds of\nprocesses which are well described okay\nnow\nlet's move on to something else so then\nthe question is if it is an emergent\nprocess that comes from multiple\ndifferent neuroscientific mechanisms\nwhy does it emerge in all three of these\nsituations right so if we look at like\nhow the brain responds so let's say\ndaydreaming is an outcome of eight and\nADHD brain daydreaming is an outcome of\ndissociation circuitry why does it\nalways happen like why isn't it that\nADHD circuitry ends up with you know\nmanifestation a and dissociation\nmanifests as B and anxiety manifests to\nsee like instead of three if we have\nthree different brains or three\ndifferent neurological processes why\ndon't they look different why do they\nall manifest as daydreaming that's the\nnext question\nokay are y'all with me here by the way\nis this like too much are you guys\nfollowing this\ndo you all need\nokay\nso this is very good okay\nso now someone is saying very good so\nthey're saying coping mechanism right so\nvery good so now there's a really\nfascinating paper\nokay\nso personality traits and maladaptive\ndaydreaming fantasy functions and themes\nin a multi-country sample so what\nbasically what people did is they\nanalyzed 539 adults who met criteria for\nmaladaptive daydreaming and then they\nlooked at their personality and what\nthey discovered is that there are three\ncommon things that these people tend to\nhave so they tend to have\ngrandiosity\nthey tend to have\nseparation anxiety\nand they tend to have anhedonia\nokay so like oh that's interesting so\nforget about the comorbidity forget\nabout the brain this is now a different\nkind of research this is sitting down\nwith a human being and asking them or\nanalyzing okay if you have maladaptive\ndaydreaming what is your personality\nlike and what they also found and this\nis what's really fascinating\nis that each of these different groups\nof people actually daydreamed about\ndifferent things okay so people who are\nin the grandiosity camp had Daydreams of\npower dominance\nand wish fulfillment\npeople with separation anxiety had\nDaydreams of relationships\nthis is really important\num of extra attention\nand in particular extra attention given\nto them by illness or some kind of\nvulnerability\nand what does that mean that means that\nwhen I daydream I think about man it\nwould be so awesome I have it literally\nhave a Daydream I don't actually think\nit's awesome but I have a daydream about\nman if I got cancer I would be in bed\nall day and everyone would be coming to\nsee me and everyone would be bringing me\ncake and food and like I just have this\nlike I build this complex fantasy in my\nmind about this scenario in which I'm\nIll or vulnerable in some way and all\nthese different kinds of people are\ngiving me attention\nand with Anne harder this is really\ninteresting for people who have\nanhedonia\nthey have Daydreams of Escape or\nphysical violence\nright so the people who are in hedonic\nhave Daydreams where like something big\nis happening I'm feeling something in\nthe Daydream the rest of my life I don't\nfeel pleasure I feel numb all the time\nbut in my Daydream like I'm fighting\nsomeone someone's fighting for me I'm\nfighting for my life I'm wrestling with\na shark you know I'm I'm wrestling with\nlike some kind of like I get attacked by\na Jaguar like there's there's or I'm\nbeing hunted by something and I have to\nrun away\nso we start to see when we look at the\npersonality element\nright so this isn't really Neuroscience\nthis is not talking about attention or\nthe brain's capacity to dissociate when\nI sit down and talk to people with\nmaladaptive daydreaming what I tend to\nfind is that there are three categories\nof sort of Personality temperaments that\nsome people are grandiose some people\nhave separation anxiety and are afraid\nof abandonment\nand some people are anhedonic which\nmeans that they don't feel pleasure and\nthat if I ask them what kind of\nDaydreams do you have they tend to\ncorrelate with these three buckets okay\nand so\nwhat we tried and this is what's really\nimportant about maladaptive daydreaming\nis that\npeople will say oh I daydream all the\ntime but it becomes important what you\ndaydream about and so what people\nhypothesize is that when I have this\nkind of brain that tees me up to\ndaydream and I have some kind of unmet\nemotional need\nin my life\nI end up with maladaptive daydreaming so\nthis is sort of like a you know it's\nit's like an alchemical process where I\ncombine two ingredients and I end up\nwith a third so for example if I have\nADHD brain\nPlus\nI've been abandoned\nI'm adopted or whatever my dad left you\nknow some kind of like thing equals\nmaladaptive daydreaming if I have a\nhistory of trauma so I have a\ndissociation brain\nand I'm Ann hedonic I can't feel\nanything\nI'm numb\nends up with maladaptive daydreaming if\nI have OCD\nand I'm a low-wage worker and my boss is\nmean to me and I have unmet needs of\npower\nand Glory\nI end up with maladaptive daydreaming\nand this is why it's such a tricky\ndiagnosis to find it's because what\nwe've got is like discrete potentially\ndiscrete neurological processes or maybe\nit's one neurological process over here\nwhich manifests or looks like any of\nthese three things and then I have an\nunmet emotional need and then my brain\ndecides to maladaptive Daydream so this\nis the way that it fixes the problem so\nthe reason that maladaptive daydreaming\nis so hard to get rid of is because it's\nactually a fix to a problem right so I\nhave a brain that's easily distractible\nplus I feel abandoned all the time so\nwhat does that result in it's like I'm\ngoing about my day I'm trying to study\nand I have this deep unmet emotional\nneed of like feeling secure about myself\nand since my brain is so easily\ndistracted it always goes back to that\ndeep emotional need it's like an itch\nthat I have to scratch over and over and\nover and over again and my lack of\nattentional control plus my unmet\nemotional need so in Neuroscience\nvulnerability plus an emotional\nvulnerability leads to this maladaptive\ndaydreaming\nokay and so the interesting thing is so\nDr K this is a very fascinating Theory\nand it sounds really cool that you're\nsaying neuroscience\nvulnerability\nplus unmet emotional need\nequals maladaptive trade dreaming but is\nthat just like do you just make it sound\ngood or is there any like data to\nsupport that and this is the coolest\npaper that I found\nokay so this is super cool okay but it's\ngonna be hard so stay with me Chad\nso the first thing is that people looked\nat this is something called uh\nNetwork theory for understanding\nmaladaptive daydreaming okay so Network\nTheory sort of is kind of like what I'm\nsaying it's sort of this emergent\nproperty\nbut what they sort of figured out is\nthey looked at maladaptive daydreaming\nand they said that there are three\nfactors there are three kind of like\nbuckets of stuff going on with these\npeople one is what they call kinesthesia\nand music so this is where like music\ntriggers their daydreaming or they use\nmusic to maintain their daydreaming they\nsomehow get lost in the music another\naspect of maladaptive daydreaming is\nyearning so they want to return to the\ndaytream they're not distressed at all\nwhen they're daydreaming they get\nannoyed if they get interrupted they\nprefer to the Daydream they have a\nstrong urge it's kind of an enjoyable\nexperience they call this thing yearning\nthis has to do with factor analysis if\nyou guys know what that is we're not\ngoing to go into too much detail\nand then the third thing is impairment\nso they have it interferes with their\ndaily chores the amount of time that\nthey Daydream causes distress it's\ndifficulty to stay focused they they\nfeel hindered in their life goals they\nhave difficulty controlling the Daydream\nit interferes with their work sound\nfamiliar by the way chat\nso these are the three factors that are\nassociated with maladaptive daydreaming\nand then what these researchers did is\nthey looked at emotional regulation and\nwhat they asked themselves is if I look\nat emotional regulation does this\ncorrelate with any of these three\nfactors so if someone has for example a\nlack of emotional awareness are they\nmore likely to experience factor three\nimpairment and what they absolutely\ndiscovered is that maladaptive\ndaydreaming can essentially be\ncorrelated with emotional regulation\nfactors\nand the other really interesting uh\nfinding that they had is that\nthere's one positive quarter or there's\none important inverse correlation which\nis the lack of emotional Clarity which\nis kind of interesting so what they\nfound is that people who Daydream a lot\ncan actually improve emotional Clarity\nover time so it's almost as if a\nmaladaptive daydreamers are using\ndaydreaming as a method of processing\ntheir own emotions and understanding\nwhat they feel as they go through all of\nthese like scenarios about feeling loved\nand and being ill and people caring from\nthem they can actually gain insight into\noh this is me feeling like lonely they\ncan actually have some kind of emotional\nregulation benefit or increase Clarity\nwhich is really really fascinating\nso what they essentially found let me\nfind uh the key sentence here\num is\num so\nuh associations were mostly positive\nsuggesting that in general\npoor emotional regulation was linked\nwith a higher degree of uh maladaptive\ndaydreaming symptoms right so this is\nthe key thing\nso the two nodes in the expanded network\nwith the highest strength centrality\nwere limited emotional regulation\nstrategies and difficulty controlling\nthe Daydream okay so what this\nessentially means\nis that when I have a maladaptive\nDaydreamer\nwho has limited\nemotional\nregulation strategies\nwhat are they more likely to do\nwhen I take this person these are the\nstrongest correlations\nthis leads to maladaptive daydreaming\nright\nand so this is the kind of situation\nwhere essentially we can tie things\ntogether now where we can see that this\npaper is a really good example of our\nhypothesis that when I have Neuroscience\nvulnerabilities and I have unmet\nemotional needs and there's a key thing\nhere\nplus no other\nway to deal with it\nthis equals maladaptive daydreaming\ndo you guys get that\nso essentially\nwhat we see is that the more limited you\nare in your emotional ability to\nregulate your emotions the more limited\nyou are in your\nforeign\nfactors\nso the more likely you are to not accept\nyour emotional responses right what does\nthat mean that means I have to escape\nthe more difficulty you have with Goal\ndirected behaviors what does that mean\nit means I get lost in in the Daydream\nthe more impulse control difficulties\nand by the way is starting to look like\nADHD oh yeah that's right remember if\nyou guys remember the Neuroscience of\nADHD lecture you remember that impulse\ncontrol difficulties and emotional\ndysregulation are a key part of the\nbrain of ADHD\nthe more lack of emotional awareness\nthat you have the more limited emotional\nregulation strategies you have and the\nlack of emotional Clarity you have the\nmore likely you are to retreat into the\ndaydream\nright so we can sort of include those\nsix factors right here\nand so there's one more thing that I'm\ngoing to add\nwhich is really unfortunate\nso this is sort of this\nambitious cycle of maladaptive\ndaydreaming\nso when you have maladaptive daydreaming\nyou leads to poor performance\nright there's no awareness of this stuff\nor this stuff so if you talk to people\nwith maladaptive Daydream maybe what we\ncan do is like look at a post so we'll\nwe'll test our hypothesis in a second\nwe'll pick a random Reddit post from our\nsubreddit and we'll see if this person\nhas any sense or talks at all in their\npost about unmet emotional needs or\ntheir comorbidities because I would\nsuspect maybe this is different because\nit's our community and our community\ntends to be super self-aware but\nwhat we tend to have is maladaptive\ndaydreaming leads to poor performance\nthis in turn leads to emotional\nfrustration\nI don't understand what's wrong with me\nwhy can't I just focus why do why am I\ncursed with maladaptive daydreaming\nright this leads to self-blame\ncan you guys see where this is going and\nthis leads to maladaptive daydreaming\nright and so as the emotional need\nincreases\nthrough\nmaladaptive daydreaming\nand by the way you shouldn't smoke pot\nbecause marijuana seems to make this\nworse\nthat's the one thing about drugs sorry\nChad\nright because remember marijuana is also\na uh coping mechanism\nI'll pull up that paper if you guys want\nto see it and so as the unmet emotional\nunmet needs increase and if you don't\nhave abilities to cope with it if you're\nnot in therapy you don't have good\nfriends Etc things like that meditation\nwe'll talk about this in a second\nthen this is going to increase your\nmaladaptive daydreaming and then once we\nincrease it then we go the second round\nright we do it again\nwe do it again and then this goes on for\na while and then you're 30 years old\nand then it's like meh\nmy life is empty\nand this is when you start thinking\nabout gging out right I'm not trying to\nbe countless here but\nthis this is what can happen so\nmaladaptive daydreaming can be a really\ndevastating diagnosis\nso just to summarize maladaptive\ndaydreaming is something that is\nincreasingly common right and so let's\nlook at why is that so this is the last\nthing so why is why are so many people\nposting about maladaptive daydreaming\nnow\nwhat's going on has it been that for 50\nyears maladaptive daydreaming has sort\nof existed and people have just ignored\nit or like is it a new thing is there\nsome maladapted daydreaming virus going\naround what's going on the first\nis that it seems to correlate with a lot\nof the vulnerabilities that lead to\ngaming disorder\nso there's some correlation between\nusing gaming as an escape\nand uh\nfilling unmet emotional needs\nso there's something going on here we're\nlike gaming and maladaptive daydreaming\nessentially serve the same adaptive\nmechanism right\nsecond reason is can anyone guess it\nHigh heightened levels of maladaptive\ndaydreaming are associated with covid-19\nlockdown pre-existing psychiatric\ndiagnosis and intensified psychological\ndysfunction you can always blame covid\nchat you can always blame coven so it\nseems like there are reasons why\nmaladaptive daydreaming is worse so\nremember\nwhat is maladaptive daydreaming it is a\nunhealthy coping mechanism which the\nMind relies on\ndue to some way that it's wired so if I\nhave attentional problems or I\ndissociate right or I'm obsessive my\nmind has an obsessive thinking quality\nto it like I'm on the OCD Spectrum so my\nbrain is wired in one of those three\nways and then maladaptive daydreaming\nemerges is a way to manage your\nemotional needs given those that sort of\nNeuroscience back backdrop\nthen once we add covet into the mix it\nalso escalates our emotional needs and\nwe end up being with more maladaptive\ndaydreaming\nokay\nnow people are probably wondering\nwhat do I do about it so I'm going to\nEcho once again this is not a place\nwhere we can give medical advice but\nhere is how I would approach\nactually let's stop for a second\nanyone have questions\nhow do you fix dissociation okay summary\nplease okay\nso let's start with a summary can you\nrepeat all that okay it's a lot okay so\nI'm gonna just talk to y'all okay we're\ngonna move away from this\nall right so here's how to understand\nmaladaptive daydreaming in a nutshell\nso the first thing is remember we\nreviewed the comorbidity data which\nsuggested that people who maladaptive\nDaydream have a very lot High likelihood\nof other psychiatric illnesses so does\nthat mean that it is a new illness\nwhich is completely independent from\nthese other illnesses no it actually\nsuggests that there's some kind of\ncommon process going on the second thing\nthat we discovered is that it appears\nthat the type of Daydreams that people\nhave correlate with certain unmet\nemotional needs and personality\ncharacteristics okay so and and what\nthat sort of\nthe third thing that we kind of talked\nabout is that we found a very tight\ncorrelation between inability to\nunderstand or regulate your own emotions\nand maladaptive daydreaming\nso what does this mean why do so many\npeople have maladaptive daydreaming and\nwhy has it been so damn hard to diagnose\nwhy are people just learning about it\nnow so my take on it is that there are\nmultiple different brains that can get\nto maladaptive daydreaming so one is the\nADHD brain in which case you can't\nreally control your attention so since\nyou can't control your attention your\nmind wanders into the Daydream very very\neasily another kind of brain is the\nobsessional brain so 50 of people with\nmaladaptive daydreaming will also have\nOCD or meet criteria for OCD so this is\na brain that obsesses over some thoughts\nthis is not attentional wandering this\nis actually the opposite where it holds\non to a particular thought extra extra\ntype which happens to be the Daydream\nthe third kind of thing that we tend to\nsee is an association with trauma okay\nor dissociation and so this is a brain\nthat is able to pull myself out of my\ncurrent circumstances so if I'm sitting\nat a cafe and you know someone has left\nme the bill my mind will dissociate and\nI'll go off into La La Land and I'll\nenter the maladaptive daydreaming for\nlike three hours and I'll just be\nsitting at the cafe so the dissociative\nbrain the inattentive brain or the\nobsessional brain can all result in\nmaladaptive daydreaming\nthe reason that each of those brains\nDaydreams is because they're on unmet\nemotional needs they're the grandiose\nemotional needs I'm I want to be rich I\nwant to be powerful I want to be\nrespected there are the essentially\nloneliness needs separation anxiety so I\ndon't want to be abandoned and I'm going\nto fantasize about being cared for and\nloved the third thing is the anhedonic\npersonality which is my life is nam my\nlife is empty my I don't feel anything\nso the Daydreams that I have are about\nsurvival Escape physical violence things\nlike that it's not necessarily violence\nagainst other people it's just very\nemotionally charged fighting for your\nlife feeling something kind of dreams so\nwhat we tend to have is when when you\nhave one of those people\nwho has one of those emotional unmet\nemotional needs and then you stick that\nemotional need in the brain of someone\nwith ADHD dissociation or Obsession\nplus an inability to process that crap\nthrough healthy coping mechanisms or a\nlack of emotional awareness you end up\nwith maladaptive daydreaming and that's\nkind of like where it comes from right\nso it's sort of a combination of a brain\nthat is predisposed to particular things\nplus unmet emotional needs so now people\nare going to say okay what do I do about\nit Dr K and that's where I'd say that\ndepends but here's what I kind of here's\nhow I'd write it out okay so I don't\nhave a whole lot of clinical experience\nwith maladaptive daydreaming so take\nthis with a grain of salt but I do feel\npretty confident when I'm about to say\nso if you're talking about what to do\nabout it first thing you've got to do is\nfigure out what kind of Neuroscience\nvulnerability do you have do you have\nattentional problems\ndissociation\nor identity problems\nor obsessional\nkind of thoughts right maybe anxiety is\nin here too\nI'm sort of skipping that past that one\nfor\nreasons but\nand then what you have to figure out is\nwhat's my unmet emotional need\nright do you fall into the grandiose\ncamp\ndo you fall into the separation anxiety\ncamp\nor do you fall into the anhedonic camp\nand then what you have to do is figure\nout coping strategies\nand EQ stuff\nand so here what you got to do is\ngain emotional clarity\ndevelop\nemotional regulation strategies\nokay\nnext thing you got to do drugs\nstop weed\nquestion start\nSSRI\nsome evidence of this okay\nso if we kind of think about it a\ntackling maladaptive daydreaming what I\nwould do is address each of these\nbuckets this is just how I practice\nPsychiatry so what I would do is with\nthe attentional person you know I'd\nteach a particular meditation that\ntrains their attention which we'll do\ntoday\nfor your unmet emotional need you could\ndo Psychotherapy for something like this\nright so if you have separation anxiety\nyou could do psychotherapy\nright so here you could even do you know\nmeds for ADHD or meditation\nand then for to gain emotional Clarity\nyou can also do meditation or\npsychotherapy but I think actually this\nis like where some of those like\nwellness retreats like out in the woods\ngo find yourself\nthis stuff is really great here\ndevelop emotional regulation uh\nstrategies so this is also where\nmeditation works great\nbut maybe you can do things like ice\ndiving\nor Wim Hof breathing\nEtc okay so this is sort of like where\nyou've got to like figure out okay which\none of these is it and you have to\nattack it from all angles\nso you have to address this from okay\nwhat's going on in my brain do I have a\nproblem with attention then if you\nincrease your mind's ability to focus\nthen you won't get lost in the Daydream\nas easily you'll remove the Neuroscience\nvulnerability if you can meet the unmet\nemotional need either through\nPsychotherapy or even like get into a\ngood relationship\nright\nget promoted\ngo do something fun like go hiking\nactually hiking's not right here go\nwhite water rafting\nright\nand then gain some emotional Clarity\nlike go find yourself go meditate go\ntalk to someone you know\ndevelop emotional regulation strategies\nis there a couple of interesting things\nso by the way one of the things that\nwe've sort of figured out recently is\nthat\nso our the outcomes from our coaching\nprograms seem to be really good and\nwe've had a lot of data points now\nand we were really confused so our the\ncoaching program appears to be about as\nefficacious uh maybe about 70 to 100 as\neffective as antidepressant medication\nor anti-anxiety medication or maybe even\nas good as Psychotherapy it's not a\ntreatment for those things so we're not\num you know we're it's not designed to\ntreat depression or anxiety but we were\njust really confused why\nour coaching intervention appears to be\neffective for treating illnesses which\nit's not don't sign up for coaching if\nyou have a mental illness that you're\nlooking for treatment for you should go\nsee a medical professional but we were\nconfused why it seems to be helpful\nhopefully that doesn't sound like a\ncontradiction to people do people\nunderstand the Nuance there\num and the reason is that we think that\nour coaching program essentially boosts\nEQ so we're actually studying that right\nnow and that's simply by giving people\nemotional Clarity by giving people\nemotional regulation strategies by\nbringing awareness and\nself-understanding that it somehow seems\nto like negate this stuff over here\nwhich we're not quite sure how that\nworks we're just as confused as y'all\nare\nright EQ is emotional quotient so it's\nlike IQ but for emotions\nthe other thing is that there is um if\nyou guys if this is ringing true to you\nthere is a video in Dr K's guide called\nthe fantasy trap\nwhich targets sort of talks about these\nunmet emotional needs and uh sort of\nlike goes into detail about why we get\nstuck in fantasy and what goes on in the\nmind when we're having a fantasy\nbut in short if we're talking about\ntargeting maladaptive daydreaming you\nknow what I would do as a psychiatrist\nif if I were your doctor is to try to\napproach each of these figure out what\nis the neuroscientific vulnerability\nwhat is the unmet emotional need and\nwhat are the ways in which you process\nyour emotions and if you can work on all\nfreeze all free I would have a\nhypothesis that your maladaptive\ndaydreaming would get better\nah in what order there isn't an order\nright these are all discrete processes\nthis is like sort of saying like if if\nwe have a soup this is an emergent\nproperty remember this is an emergent\nproperty\nso it's like if I have you know water\nplus tomatoes\nPlus Salt\nto make a crappy soup\nand I end up with soup over here right\nthe order isn't important what's\nimportant is that all three end up in\nthere I mean I guess technically order\nis important because culinary stuff is\ndifferent so maybe you want to like\nroast the tomatoes first and then add\nthe salt and later add the water so\nthat's a bad analogy but and maybe maybe\nthat could be true for for the the this\nstuff too maybe there's a particular\norder we just don't have any data on on\ntreatment\nright\nso I I don't think it's about order this\nis where people like what order do I do\nit in so generally speaking when I work\nas a psychiatrist I don't like sometimes\nyou have to do order but when someone\ncomes into my office I'll give them a\nprescription I'll teach him to meditate\nand I'll give him a diet plan like all\non day one like do it all\nright they're all independent things you\ncan do it in whatever order you want but\nideally you'd actually deal do all three\nokay\nso now\njust do it all you're damn right\nso here's the thing\nso it's possible if we want to look at\nit technically that doing any one of\nthese\nis sufficient to end to deal with the\ndaydreaming it's possible that you don't\nneed to do all three\nbut this is the kind of thing where if\nmaladaptive daydreaming is ruining your\nlife I'd work I'd fire all cylinders\nright\nso it's possible that if you just get\nrid of the emotional need that the\nmaladaptive daydreaming will fall apart\nit's very possible we just don't know\nthat there's no data to support you know\nwhat's effective for maladaptive\ndaydreaming okay"
