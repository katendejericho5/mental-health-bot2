    "transcript": "why are so many americans quitting their\njobs i don't know if this is an america\nthing by the way if it is sorry\neuropeans and other east asians\nsoutheast asians other people south\namericans\num\ni don't know that we have a huge\nyou know\nfollowing in africa but people outside\nof america let's say\nso there are a bunch of people who are\nquitting their jobs and the anti-work\nsubreddit is one of the fastest growing\nsubreddits uh\nright here\non reddit and so i wanted to talk a\nlittle bit about why so many people seem\nto be quitting their jobs\nand kind of what's going on there\nso to try to understand from a science\nwhen i say scientific perspective i mean\nsort of like a theoretical scientific\nperspective what can we understand from\nthings like the theory of evolution what\ncan we understand about\num\nlarge-scale psychological trends and\nwhat can we understand about\npsychology that propagates this kind of\nthing\nuh that makes it actually worse and so\nwe're just gonna sort of comment on it\nit's gonna be kind of like\njust dr k's thoughts about this thing\nokay\nso the first thing that i want to say is\nthat like i mentioned earlier this is\nnot something that i'm an expert in it's\nnot something that i'm going to be\nciting sources or things like that\nciting literature it's just sort of like\nmy take on\nwhy people are quitting so much okay\nso the first thing is that there seems\nto be an unprecedented amount of people\nquitting their jobs and doing so in a\nspectacular and social media\nkarma farming sort of way right so\npeople will post\nonto anti-work about oh like my my boss\ntold me to like work come in on saturday\nand cancelled my vacation and cancelled\nchristmas so i said screw you and i quit\nand so they post it on on the internet\nit gets a bunch of karma and then people\npost about it again and again and again\nand again\nand so what i i thought i'd talk a\nlittle bit about like why this is\nhappening now like what forces led up to\nthis\nand sort of understanding the psychology\nbehind it\nso the first is that i think that the\ninternet has become one of the great\nequalizers so generally speaking what\ncauses things to change\nare when there are major humanity\nhuman creations that will tend to level\nthe playing field\nbetween like unequal\ngroups of people\nand generally speaking i think the\ninternet is like the third biggest thing\nthat has been discovered so the two that\ni'd say come before this for the first\nis the printing press right so when when\nreading and information became more\nwidely available we started to see a\ndrastic change within society\nthe second big thing that seemed to\nequalize a lot of stuff was the\ninvention of gunpowder so if you look at\nthings like the american revolution in\nlike feudal societies\nyou know in the past what it used to be\nthat if you were stronger and had a\nsword like you would you could kill\nother people and so there was like a big\ndisparity in terms of power and like\nphysical strength\nover time what seemed to happen is with\nthe invention of like gunpowder in the\npistol\nyou have people that are able to exert a\nlot more power against like people who\nare traditionally more powerful so you\nhave things like the american revolution\nand and stuff like that but i think guns\nhave been another huge equalizer\nand i think the third great equalizer\nand there may be many more before this\ni'm not a historian\nbut i'd say that the internet is a huge\nequalizer and people have\num\ni think not really understood the impact\nof what the dissemination of information\nhas truly had on our society so 50 years\nago if you lived in a small town and you\nhad some crappy job like that was it\nright like you're you looked around at\nyour options and you were not aware of\nlike what your other options were you\nwere vaguely aware that other jobs\nexisted elsewhere\nbut your ability to compare yourself to\nother people and to understand what else\nwas out there was like quite quite\nnarrow\nand we talk about some of the evils of\nsocial media and information\ndissemination fomo and things like that\non on this channel\nyou know we talk about\noverly comparing and the the weaknesses\nof overly comparing we talk about social\nmedia and the dangers of social media in\nterms of making people feel like they're\nleft out and things like that but i\nthink one of the things that it's\nimportant to remember is that social\nmedia just like video games are tools\nand that tools can be used for good or\nfor ill\nand so one of the things that started to\nhappen with the advent of the internet\nis people have started to realize that\nthere's like better things out there\nright so there's like a greater\nawareness in general\nthat the world doesn't have to be as\ncrappy as your situation is\nand i think this acknowledgment that\nthere are better options out there has\nbeen absolutely devastating for certain\nemployers\nso this is also where i'm gonna kind of\njump ahead here for a second but if we\nlook at why things have gotten so bad i\nwould say in short\nemployers have had no negative selection\npressure against poor practices\nso if i'm you know if i own let's say a\nmajor serial manufacturing company and\npeople are unhappy i haven't really had\nany need to make my employees happy\nright i've been able to say because\nthere hasn't been a selection pressure\nor consequence you guys can go screw\nyourselves right so i've been able to\nsay that thus far and so we've had\nthings like the creation of unions which\nhave been designed to balance corporate\npower and all that stuff is fantastic\ni'm not going to go down that road but i\nthink there's another huge balancing\nissue here which is like the internet\nbecause now we're beginning to see\nhuge movements towards equality so you\nsee these things like the arab spring\nyou see these things where people are\nnow aware\nthat other options exist right\nso the first thing that's happened is\nthat that the internet has sort of\nstarted to equalize the playing field in\nterms of removing ignorance\num and so this is another thing that\ncorporations have benefited a lot from\nit which is like you know praying\nessentially on ignorance so like if my\nworkers don't know what else is out\nthere\ni can give them crappy things so in\ngeneral like i think for example the\nquality of food is thankfully in\nrestaurants like generally speaking\nimproved over the course of my life and\nwhy is that it's because now i have so\nmuch access to information about where i\ncan get food and where there is good\nfood and where there is bad food as a\nresult there were a lot of crappy\nrestaurants that you know existed when i\ngrew up that like i didn't realize that\ni could drive 10 minutes away or further\nand like find a really good restaurant\nthat was amazing it was all like word of\nmouth but with the advent of internet\nsharing information i've been able to\nfind good restaurants\nas restaurants\nas we sort of discover there are better\nrestaurants and worse restaurants like\nbetter companies and worse companies\npeople have started gravitating towards\nthe better companies and moving away\nfrom the worst companies so i think a\nlot of corporations have continued to\nexist very profitably\nbasically preying on the ignorance of\ntheir employees and their employees not\nrealizing what else is out there\nso there are a couple of other things\nthat have happened recently and i think\nthe biggest one is covid so i think\ncovet has been a great example of the\nblindfold coming off\nso for a long time companies have sort\nof assumed or believed or taught their\nemployees to believe\nthat particular things were true the\nfirst is that you have to be at the\noffice to work right and so what\ncompanies would do is like there was\nthere's so much crap\nthat people had to put up with like\ncommuting is the top of the list right\nwhere like you had to commute like a\ncommute was a given so when looking at a\njob i even remember when when i got my\nfirst place in boston or not just first\nplace every single place i had in boston\none of the main considerations i had\nwhen i was like renting an apartment was\nwhat does my commute look like what does\nthe commute look like what does the\ncommute look like what does the commute\nlook like because people were spending\nhalf an hour or up to an hour i mean\ndepending on where you live and what\nyour situation is or five minutes if\nyou're super lucky\nyou know people would spend at anywhere\nfrom five minutes to two hours of their\nlife per day\ncommuting to and from work\nand so the the what's happened with\ncovet is we sort of started to realize\noh you actually don't need to commute to\nwork like you don't actually have to be\nin the office and this was a huge like\nrevelation for a lot of people right so\nthe other thing that corporations tended\nto take advantage of was almost like\ngeographical\npredation\nwhere like you know in the past\nyour job\num options were restricted by your\ngeography so if i live in like beaumont\ntexas or if i live in like some small\ntown in alabama or you know if i live in\nsome small town in india my only options\nfor work were like what was like\navailable around me and so with the\nadvent of the internet and especially\nwith covid and work from home you're no\nlonger geographically restricted so\nthere used to be some companies that\nlike i don't know if you guys have ever\nheard of a company town where there's\nlike one major employer and most of the\npeople work for that employer and people\ndon't have a lot of\nchoice they don't have the a lot of\nability to like laterally move or or go\nto other companies\nand with the advent of covid and\neverything moving online suddenly now\ncorporations are no longer able to\nengage in like essentially geographical\npredation right so like now if i don't\nlike the job that i have in in you know\nmobile alabama i can go and apply for a\njob in canada right so i can actually\nlike work in a different country i can\nwork in a different part of the state\nthis is something that corporations have\nloved doing for a long time until it\nstarts to hurt them which is like when\nthere was all this concern about you\nknow shipping jobs overseas or\noutsourcing to places like india and\nchina and companies have been thrilled\nto do that thus far we've like moved\nmanufacturing over to china we've moved\nmanufacturing over to india and people\nhave lost their jobs here and like like\ncorporations have been like great like i\ncan move elsewhere i don't actually have\nto employ the people here and now what's\nhappening is the reverse right so where\nemployees are starting to realize i\nactually don't have to work for this\ncrap job with you i can actually work\nremotely at this place that's somewhere\nelse and so like this has been a huge\nthing that that covet has sort of\nunveiled and i think companies are now\nreeling from it\nnext thing that that kovit has revealed\nto people is what they need to survive\nso there used to be a huge like idea\nabout what it was what was required for\nlike survival success and happiness in\nlife right this is the idea of the grind\npeople are like grinding left and right\nand it's like i'm gonna grind i'm gonna\nwork hard i'm gonna become successful\ni'm gonna make more money and then i can\nretire at the age of 65. i'm gonna\ncommute two day two hours of my life\nevery day to work nine hours a day so\nit's going to be an 11 hour commitment\nper day i'm gonna sleep for eight hours\nwhich gives me like two hours a day of\nof recreation or whatever i'm going to\ndo this for about 40 years and i'm going\nto retire and i'm going to buy a\ncondo somewhere where it's warm and\nwhere there's a beach and i'm going to\nenjoy the rest of my life and this was\naccepted this was just sort of like what\nyou know people used to be okay with\nand and there's sort of this like idea\nthat you know the harder you work the\nmore successful you're gonna be\nand then essentially what the\ncorporations did is took all the\nhard-working people and like predated\nthem to extinction\nand so they they essentially like you\nknow there's this idea that you have to\ngrind really hard and then you'll be\nhappy at the end\nand what tends to happen instead like\nduring covet is people started to\nrealize like what is the value of money\nwhat is the value of my time what do i\nactually need to survive and what i\nthink what people really discovered is\nthat they don't need money nearly as\nmuch as they thought they did and that\nan extra five thousand dollars a year or\nten thousand dollars a year is not worth\nan extra 15 hours a week\nand so as as blindfol as covet has taken\nthe blindfold off a lot of people have\nstarted to re-question their priorities\nand what they're willing to sacrifice\nso just kind of stepping into\nevolutionary theory for a second\nso i think that basically like covet has\nput a selection pressure on jobs\nright so this is where like before\nthese behaviors and practices by\ncompanies went on unchecked because\nthere was no consequence in the\nenvironment\nso you know the theory of evolution says\nsurvival of the fittest and since\ncompanies were able to get away with\nthat sort of thing they did get away\nwith it because there was no consequence\nfor them and now what i think\ncorporations are really discovering is\nthat there is actually a selection\npressure which is what's happening right\nso workers on mass are deciding to\nselect for\na particular kind of job and select\nagainst another kind of job\nand this is where a lot of people are\nstarting to get really upset and they're\nsaying there's a labor shortage there is\nnot a labor shortage there is a wage\nshortage right the labor is there it's\njust it doesn't want to work your crappy\njob which you've been able to propagate\nfor a long time and haven't had to keep\nup to snuff\nbecause like there's been no selection\npressure against it right\nso these companies have become like\nbloated profit driven and i'm not like a\nleftist by the way just you know i'm\njust saying that if there's no like\nselection pressure against something\nit's gonna become bloated and like\noverblown and like you know the wealth\ninequality is increasing and people are\njust not going to put up with it anymore\nand so what we're sort of seeing there's\nsome really sort of simple evidence i'm\ngoing to draw a very big correlation\nhere\nbut that basically if you want to like\nplay a game with someone you have to win\nlet them win at least 30 of the time so\nif you look at like play behavior\namongst animals and even if you think\nabout like your kids for example like\nyou've got to let them win some of the\ntime right it's like a 30-70 swing if\nthey lose more than 70 percent of the\ntime they're going to stop playing if\nthey win 70 of the time they're gonna\nmore significantly more than 70 percent\nof the time they're going to stop\nplaying so you even think about the way\nthat video games are designed video\ngames are not designed to be like 100\nvictory all the time right they sort of\nare but they give you like false starts\nyou have to wipe on a boss multiple\ntimes before you down it\nand so what's been happening for far too\nlong is that like companies have been\nracking up w's without taking l's and\nnow like their karmic seed is coming to\nfruition where people just aren't\nwilling to put up for with it anymore\nand so like now what's happening is\nthey've created these systems that have\nbecome essentially bloated and\nvulnerable to this kind of of you know\nlike like essentially like workers\nhitting back right and i know this is\nstarting to sound like the communist\nmanifesto but i mean it's really more\nabout psychology and evolutionary theory\ni'm not propagating i'm not suggesting\none is good or one is bad it's just this\nis what's happened there have been too\nmany unchecked corporate excesses and\nlike people are just tired of it now\nso there's another huge um thing that's\nstarting to change a little bit which i\ni think i've worked with a lot of uh you\nknow startups i've worked with a lot of\nceos i've worked with a lot of\ninvestment banks and i've started to see\nsome interesting changes in those places\nso the first example that i'll give\ny'all\nis that investment working at an\ninvestment bank like goldman sachs or\nlike jp morgan or whatever used to be a\nvery coveted job\nand now what's what tends to happen is\npeople want to do their two years at a\nplace like goldman and they want a gtfo\nas quickly as possible so this is kind\nof interesting because even this is not\njust something that's happening at the\nbottom tier of like wage right this is\neven happening very high up you see this\na lot in medicine you see it a lot in\nresidency where people are starting to\nlike you know decide like i'm not going\nto become a doctor if i can become a\nnurse practitioner because i can make\nway more i can make sure i'll make less\nmoney but the amount of time that i have\nto sacrifice to become a doctor is no\nlonger worth it so i'm gonna go the np\nroute so we're seeing this at so many\ndifferent levels of work i absolutely\nsee it in investment banking\nwhere i had a very prominent client who\nwas struggling with turnover\nand so you know what they sort of had\nthis attitude that it's like you know\nyou work hard and like you invest you\nyou pay your dues\nand then once you rise to the top that's\nwhen you get to relax\nand they sort of didn't understand that\nlike people are just not having that\nanymore right like they're not willing\nto\nyou know work their asses off for 20\nyears so that they can start flying\nfirst class at the age of 46. people are\njust not willing to make that trade so\nin investment banking which you're\nseeing is a massive exodus\nfrom banking to easier fields so people\nwill go be cfo they'll go join vc\nthey'll go join private equity\nthings aren't really that much better in\nin those fields as well but they tend to\nbe better\nso what we're seeing even at higher\nlevels of education is like\num\nyou know much more turnover and like\nselection pressures away from money so\nanother good example of this is like\ni've worked with a lot of people who are\nengineers at google and they actually\nreally love google so google's a good\nexample of someone who seems to be doing\nthis right so google in some ways\nactually may pay less than\nwhat someone is able to make somewhere\nelse but basically every person i've\never worked with at google\nloves working there and why do they love\nworking there even though they may get\npaid five thousand dollars less it's\nbecause google like sort of takes care\nof them so they have a cafeteria that's\nopen for like 18 hours a day you can\ncome in and work when you want to where\nyou want to you don't have to come into\nthe office if you don't want to you can\nwork from like 10 p.m to like 6 a.m so\ni've had people who work at google who\nlike will basically try to show up there\nfor dinner before the cafeteria closes\nbecause the food is good\nthey work all night google keeps them\nsupplied with like energy drinks or\nwhatever other unhealthy crap they want\nand then they have breakfast in the\nmorning they go home they game for a few\nhours and they pass out\nright so like some employers are\nrecognizing what people actually want\nand some employers aren't\nand the employers that are starting to\nrecognize that oh like turnover you know\nthis is turnover is happening because\npeople don't like working here and\nthrowing money at the problem which many\nof them are not even doing\nthrowing money at the problem is not\nactually a perfect solution\nso what we're starting to see i'm seeing\nthis a lot more in terms of like\nstartups and and like young people that\ni advise and people that i work with is\nthat even people who are in finance like\nthey don't want to just like\nbe doing gigantic murders mergers and\nacquisitions for gigantic piles of money\nthat their the partner at their firm\nsees which they see a tiny little slice\nof they want to start doing work that is\nmeaningful and impactful and like they\ncan actually be proud of what they do\nand so the the pressures on businesses\nare changing and businesses aren't\nkeeping up\nso this is the third thing that i'm\ngoing to talk about and here's the real\npsychological mistake that most\nemployers are making\nso i'm going to ask you all a question\nso when there's a kid who acts out and\nhas behavioral problems in school\nand you punish the kid and you tell them\nhey you're a bad kid bad kid what\nhappens to that kid does the kid act out\nworse or do they get better when you\npunish them and you say you're a dumb\nkid you're a stupid kid you're a bad\nbehaved kid\nit gets worse so what do you think is\nhappening when corporations are saying\noh these workers like kids nowadays are\nso lazy\nthey're so lazy there's a labor shortage\npeople just don't want to work they just\nwant to get their federal hand out they\nwant to sit at home because they're lazy\nthey're lazy they're so lazy oh my\ngoodness\nand this is this is their karmic seed\ncoming to fruition right this is their\nchicken coming to hatch or rooster\ncoming to hatch or whatever\nright so this is where the biggest\nmistake that corporations have made is\nthat they have grossly invalidated the\nexperience of their workers\nso i'll give you guys a prime example of\nthis and that is the field of pr so when\na company has a problem\nright so let's say like there's let's\njust say hypothetically that you're a\ngame developer who has you know\nsome kind of doj or department of labor\ninvestigation against you for systemic\nsexual discrimination\nwhat do you do\nyou hire a pr firm right so somewhere\nalong the way\ncompanies started resorting to pr to fix\ntheir problems which is like a\nfundamental mistake\nright because it's like you're not\nactually fixing the problem you're just\nfixing the perception of the problem\nand this is a huge problem because at\nsome point companies stopped actually\nlike listening to their employees and\nwhat they want and what is hard for them\nand instead what they started doing is\njust like\nfocusing on pr\nthere's like a lack of transparency\nthere's a lack of understanding of what\npeople want and essentially it's\nincredibly invalidating so the there are\na lot of companies out there that are\npsychologically so invalidating to the\nexperiences of their employees\nthat the employees are just done with it\nlike they're going to act out worse and\nso like a good example of this is i\nheard recently that you know\nsomeone was replacing strike workers and\nthen us trolls on the internet when i\nsay awesome i don't know if i'm really\nincluded in this but trolls on the\ninternet decided to spam their their\njob application website with like fake\napplications\nright like i don't think that people\nrealize that like\nthat invalidation of workers experiences\nis going to lead to catastrophic\nproblems\nand the reason that they have been able\nto do this for so long is simply because\nthere hasn't been any selection pressure\nfor it right so you've been able to\ninvalidate the experience of your\nemployees and tell them to go screw\nthemselves for a long time which is\nexactly why it's continued right there\nhas been no selection pressure against\nit and now there is a selection pressure\nagainst it and so the companies are\ngoing to have two choices they can\ncontinue to invalidate the experience of\ntheir workers and call them lazy and et\ncetera et cetera et cetera in which case\npeople are going to quit on mass and\nthen your company will close like you'll\nshut your doors right and then you're\ngoing to go thinking oh man like\nmy company shut down because people are\nlazy now and they didn't used to be lazy\nit's not my fault it's the world's fault\nit has nothing to do with me there's\nnothing i could have done differently\nit's because workers are lazy now in\ngovernment handouts\ni'm going to absolve myself of all\nresponsibility by blaming everyone\nexcept for myself it's the government's\nproblem kids are lazy it's video games\nit's drugs it's have you seen this\njustin bieber like all of this stuff\nit's it's no one's fault but my own\nheaven forbid what are you saying are\nyou saying that i should have actually\nasked my employees\nwhat can i do to get you to stay\nwhat\nthat's an absurd question why on earth\nwould i ever ask that\nare you suggesting that i should ask my\nemployees like what what\nwhat would make you happy here what are\nyou looking for how can we help you how\ncan we how can we do a better job as\nemployers\nthat's absurd\nthere's no way i can do better i'm\nperfect like i thought you guys\nunderstood that didn't we understand the\nboss i make more money than you isn't\nisn't the amount of money that i make\ncorrelated with the amount of perfection\nthat i have and since i make more money\nthan you do i'm more perfect than you\nare in my opinion matters more than\nyours i'm the boss\ni'm the boss i know what's right and i\nknow what's wrong i know what's better\nfor you i know it's good for you and\nit's nine bucks an hour so i don't know\nwhy you're complaining\nright and then when problems happen so\nhere's like an example right so when\nproblems happen and i get into trouble\nbecause heaven forbid like i change\nanything that's ridiculous like why\nwould i change anything then what\nhappens is like when when\nproblems start to arise and there are\nmedia stories and stuff like that\ninstead of i know it's kind of weird but\ninstead of fixing the problem and saying\nhey maybe i screwed up here\nwhat i do is i hire a pr firm and i'm\nlike fix my public image like i'm fat\nand i'm bloated and i'm i'm a\ncorporation\nand what i want you to do is is tailor\nme a nice suit so it makes it look good\nand then what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to rebrand\nright so we have like rebrand i like i\nhave nothing against pr like i think\nthat there's important things you know\nfor\nwhy perception matters because sometimes\nyou have the flip side of the coin too\nwhere you are doing a really good job\nand because of some kind of slander\ncampaign or some kind of disgruntled\npeople like you know you have to\nthe battle of perception is important\ni'm just saying that perception the\nbattle of perception should not be a\nsubstitute for actually like making\nimprovement right and this is like\npsychology 101 or maybe clinical\nmedicine 101 which is like if you know\nif you have a problem in a relationship\nyou should try to understand the other\nperson's perspective instead of trying\nto gaslight them through you the use of\npr and convincing the world that there\nisn't actually a problem\nand somewhere along the way corporations\njust started doing that and it started\nworking really well which is why they\nkept doing it because we didn't hold\nthem accountable for it right\nwhen when we find out that for example\nlike you know\nthere's human rights stuff in china and\napple and all these kinds of stories\ncome out and nike is like using\nsweatshops and stuff like that did we\nstop purchasing nike equipment did we\nstop buying apple products did we do any\nof that stuff no\nright and so like if\nyou know corporations are doing it\nbecause they've been able to get away\nwith it because they haven't been held\naccountable\nand now things are are so\nthey're reaching a point due to the\naccess of information and due to you\nknow people like realizing that they\ndon't have to commute two hours to go to\nwork every day that the grass is\nactually greener on the other side what\nwe're starting to see is like a lot of\ncompanies are starting to suffer from\nthat right\nand it's kind of interesting because\nlike there's just a lot of stuff that\ncompanies are getting bit in the ass\nwhere they were super happy when it\nhappened the first time around\noutsourcing is one example another\nexample is like automation right so it's\nkind of interesting because\nyou know when grocery stores move from\nhuman people checking you out to\nmachines checking you out they didn't\ndrop prices at all it's not like\nanything in the grocery store got\ncheaper it's just the company made more\nmoney and now when they're getting\nautomated bots that are clogging their\ntheir applications i mean their their\njob\napplication website with fake\napplications like they seem to be crying\nfoul when it's like companies have had\nno problem you know automating things\nwhen it screws over workers but heaven\nforbid workers start automating things\nthat screw over companies like that's\njust unfair\nthe best example of this i actually had\na client who\nwrote a script to do his job\nand then like\nsomeone found out about it and they sort\nof fired him\nand and then they got like super upset\nand he's like okay you can fire me if\nyou want to but you're gonna have to pay\nhuman to do this amount instead of\nrewarding ingenuity in a company\nactually like automating a worker\nautomating the job instead of giving\nthat person a gigantic raise and saying\nhey is there anything else that you can\nautomate for us bro they just fired him\nand got super upset\nand it's like it goes both ways right so\ni think what we're starting to see is\nessentially like a karmic seed coming to\nfruition\nand this anti-worker movement is coming\nit is now starting to really propagate\nbecause people are aware that they don't\nhave to put up with this crap anymore\nthere's actually a selection pressure\nthat companies have become bloated\nbecause they there have not been\nselection pressures against them right\nand now that there are selection\npressures against them they're starting\nto feel the hurt and this is getting\nfurther propagated by the fact that when\nyou have a problem\nwhat instead of actually like addressing\nthe problem and trying to fix it and\nlistening to people's concerns you call\nthem lazy and blame the government and\nas long as like you're doing that and\nthen you hire a pr firm those are the\nthree and if you keep on doing those\nthree things like do you all get that on\na very fundamental level like you're not\nfixing the problem\nyou can whine about the government as\nmuch as you want to but like until you\nfix the problem until you make your\nplace\na place where people actually want to\nwork where they feel hopefully fairly\ncompensated which there is a flip side\nto that coin too because human beings\nnever feel feel fairly compensated right\nlike you could always you always feel\nlike\nyou could be making more money for doing\nthe work that you do that's just part of\nhuman psychology it's sort of like this\nthis too is a good example you look at\ndishes that get done in a house right so\nlet's say you live with four roommates\neveryone always feels like they're doing\nthe most dishes that's just how it is so\nthere are there are good reasons why you\nknow for example you can't just give in\nto what workers want because workers may\nalways feel like they're unjustly\ncompensated which is human psychology\nbut at some point there's like there's\nsome some middle ground right where like\nyou don't screw them over and call them\nlazy and hire a pr firm you actually\nlisten to what they say you do your best\nto fairly compensate them and then you\nalso recognize that maybe if people are\nleaving that you're a boss\nmaybe people are leaving you don't pay\nhim enough maybe people are leaving like\nyou should reconsider your work\nenvironment and that you try to do what\nyou can to make your employees happy but\nuntil people start doing that they're\ngoing to keep seeing this i'm not saying\nworkers are right about 100 of things\nbut like it's just been way too much\nlike there have been too many problems\nthat get propagated\nand not addressed and not fixed and it's\nbeen going on for too long\nso like the workers have been winning\nonly five percent of the time and so i\nthink they're tired of playing the game\nwhich is why they're quitting\nright and thankfully i've worked with\ncompanies who and i like it's good so i\nlike working with companies and then\nwe'll talk about things like this right\nso when i go to an investment bank and\nand you know\nwe'll talk a little bit about because\nyou got to speak their language so i\ni'll ask them questions like how much\ndoes your turnover hurt you\nwhat if you could\nhave it a place where there wasn't where\nyour turnover number was 50 they're like\noh my god that would be amazing\nright and then you have to you can even\ntalk the language of dollars and cents\nso you can tell them like how much would\nthat affect your bottom line and they're\nlike oh would affect our bottom line\nlike this much how many more deals could\nyou do a year oh we could do like so\nmany more deals a year\nokay so then like you what's the value\nof those deals okay so like why not give\npeople more money like\nthey're like but but they don't they\nhaven't earned it\nright and there's some weird concept of\nlike haven't earned it it's like bro you\nmake 16 million dollars a year what have\nyou done to earn it\nright this is something that i realized\nin medicine so\ni was talking to a doctor and it was\ntalking about you know how much money\nthey make\nand they were like well i've worked my\nass off for like the last 16 years i\ndeserve to make x amount of money\ni work 70 hours a week and it's like bro\nthe lady that just was in your office\nthat got diagnosed with breast cancer at\nthe age of 45 also works 70 hours a week\nshe just\nworks worse jobs than you do\nshe's been working 70 hours a week for\nlonger than you have\nearned it is is tricky\nright\nand and this is where from a corporate\nperspective you got to be kind of\ncareful right so like if you think about\noh but what about the justification of\nthat salary like there could be a good\nreason for that so let's let's put you\nin charge for a second chat let's say\nyou run a a company with 100 million\ndollars that makes 100 million dollars\nin revenue\nand you have a choice you can hire one\ndude for five million dollars a year\nor you can hire another dude for 20\nmillion dollars a year\nthe upside one guy increases your\nprofits by five percent the other guy\nincreases your offense profits by 50\nand since that person is able to\nincrease your profits by 50 percent\npeople are willing to pay them 20\nmillion dollars which one are you going\nto hire\nright it's tricky\nthere's a flip side of that coin\nright\nand so then you're willing to pay 20\nmillion dollars and it's a justified\ncost from your perspective that's how\nthat person is able to command the price\nthat they're able to command so i'm not\nsaying that you know high compensation\nby definition is like an evil thing i\nthink there's an economic side to that\nequation too which i've come to\nunderstand working with like ceos and\nentrepreneurs\nbut this is the kind of thing where you\nknow when you work with an investment\nbank you got to help them understand\nthat hey if you keep like i think is\nthis my experience\nis also what i do for like a lot of our\nconsulting is that i believe that the\nhappiest healthiest employees like are\nthe most productive and so do what you\ncan to make your happy healthy employees\nlike you know do what you can\nand the more that you get their back\nthey'll have yours and what people are\nhave been expecting for far too long is\ntheir employees to have their back and\nthey don't see any benefit from it\nyou got to be a team player you got to\ncome in and work christmas\nwhat do you get for that nothing you get\nto since you're the\nsince you're the person who's the\nbiggest doormat you're also going to\nwork thanksgiving because other people\nare going to and moan but since\nyou're actually a team player and you're\nwilling to sacrifice i'm going to have\nyou work thanksgiving and july 4th and\nnew year's\nright and this is the way that you work\nyour hardest employees to extinction\nright\nit's not unfair\nlet's be clear it's evolutionary\nyou can call evolution unfair if you\nwant to\nbut until you start selecting against\nthat kind of thing it'll continue to\nhappen\nso what people have sort of discovered\nif you're in the workplace is that\nbeing grumpy and asked to do extra work\nis can be a very good\nquality right it can protect you in some\nways hurt you in other ways\nwho's likely to get promoted to manager\nthe person who comes in on\nthe four holidays of the year or the\nperson who puts on a grumpy face what do\ny'all think chat\nwho's more likely to get promoted\nall right so it's it's interesting\npeople are saying the grump\nright so this is where so this is where\nlike it depends on the kind of boss that\nyou have does the boss\nselect for oh if i promote the doormat\nthen the grump is going to be grumpier\nabout it and i don't want him to be\ngrumpy about it\nor do i\nin promote\nthe doormat because he's a team player\nand the grumpy's gonna be grumpy\nit depends on what you've selected for\nright so as a boss\nif you've tolerated grumpy behavior then\nyou're gonna be selecting for that kind\nof behavior\nso it's tricky\nit's very tricky\nso i i think that you know just to\nsummarize i think the the great\nresignation has been a long time in\ncoming\ni think that there's been a lot of like\ncorporate invalidation of workers\nexperiences and so employees are just\nnot willing to put up with that anymore\nthey've started to re realize that they\ndon't have to because i don't i'm not\ngeographically restricted i can work\nfrom home i and the other thing is that\ni don't i'm like the exploitation is\njust not worth it anymore right so the\nbeing being forced to work all my\nholidays\nfor some amount of money when the\ncompany doesn't have my back in other\nsituations\nit's just not worth it for me and i\nthink what we're seeing and just for the\nrecord i think there are a lot of good\nemployers companies corporations out\nthere like i've heard great things about\ncostco for example like i haven't seen a\nsingle post on the anti-work subreddit\nabout costco\nright so it is possible to do a good job\nyou know i haven't seen a single post\nabout you know the cor the toxic culture\nat like super giant games for example so\nmaybe there is one maybe there is i i\ndon't know\nbut you know there are some situations\nwhere you see toxic people post about\ntoxic work cultures but there are a lot\nof companies that are absent from that\nso\nyou know\nand then there's another evolutionary\nthing which is that\ninstead of actually improving your your\ngame design\nor optics which you do is just acquire\nthe studios that make good games and\nthen you drive them into the ground\nthat's another model which has been\nevolutionarily supported\nbecause we as gamers don't\ncontinue buying the games once they've\nbeen acquired and they start making crap\nright so until until there's any kind of\nselection pressure against it the the\nbehavior will propagate\nyou"
