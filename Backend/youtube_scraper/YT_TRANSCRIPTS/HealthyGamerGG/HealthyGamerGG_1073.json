    "transcript": "so dr k how do you become more decisive\nin getting get over the fear of making\nthe wrong decision in life\ni'm struggling with indecision lately\nsometimes it is difficult for me to make\ndecisions on what to do on a daily\nmoment-to-moment basis it is also\ndifficult for me to decide what to do\nnext in my life\ni get overwhelmed with all the options\nand choices can't figure out what i\ntruly want anymore and i'm paralyzed by\na fear of making the wrong life choices\ni feel as if i don't have freedom and\nspontaneity i deliberate on things too\nmuch and end up not making any decision\nbecause i fear that i might start\nsomething and end up not liking it and\nthen there'll be no way to get out of it\nthis happens more with big life\ndecisions like what direction to go in\nnext\ni realize my indecision protects me from\nnot having to make a choice\nbut i feel that i've always been like\nthis as a kid i was easily overwhelmed\nand would often have this feeling of\ntime running out and then i would throw\na tantrum because i felt because i felt\ntrapped as if the walls were closing in\non me today this feeling persists in my\ndecision making though not always as\nstrong\nhow do you become more decisive is there\nsome kind of exercise or practice that\nwould help with this indecision and fear\nof making the wrong choice\nso\nthe short answer is yes\nso we're going to approach this from a\ncouple of different angles first we're\ngoing to take\na yoga angle so nyani yoga is the path\nof knowledge so we're going to examine\nthis\nusing like the ability of contemplation\nthe second thing that we're going to\nreference is\nsort of specifically what is going on\nwith this person\nand where\nthis kind of indecision comes from\nthe third thing that we're going to\ntouch on is strategies to deal with in\nindecision and the last thing we're\ngoing to touch on is a meditation of\nsorts\nthat will theoretically help with this\nbut it's a little bit more advanced\nokay\nso the first thing is so this person is\nconcerned about making the right\ndecision or the wrong decision so\nwhat is a right decision or wrong\ndecision so that this is kind of the\npath of nyan yog so anytime you're faced\nwith a difficulty in life what nyonyog\nsays is understand the nature of the\nthing so we're not going to like fix it\nwe're just going to understand how it\nworks we're going to try to figure out\nwhat are the laws of physics here like\nwhat are the equations that govern\ngravity and electromagnetism and\nnewtonian mechanics right we're just\ngoing to try to figure out\nwhat the laws\nthat govern this are\nso\nwhat is what is the right decision what\nis the wrong decision\nwhat do y'all think chat how do you know\nif you're making the right decision or\nthe wrong decision\nokay so i'm going to tell you all a\nstory\nso i had a patient about\nlet me make sure i get this right about\nseven\nsix years ago\nthat was in a\num\nwas\nin a competitive work environment\nand um they were\nthey were scheduled for a meeting so\nthere was a promotion opening up\nand they were in a very competitive and\nwork environment they had a colleague\nthat they disliked\nand they\nwere scheduled for a meeting to lobby\nfor the promotion okay\nso the morning the meeting was at like\n10 30 or something so they they get to\ntheir office\nand um\nat about 9 15 they get a call that their\nfather has fainted and so they really\ndon't have a choice but they're they're\nyou know so they have to leave they have\nto cancel the meeting they're really\nkind of frustrated with themselves\nin a sense they don't really blame their\nfather but they're kind of blaming their\nfather because\num\nyou know they're missing this meeting\nthey're also have like playing doomsday\nscenarios in their mind that oh like now\nthat like i i miss this meeting like you\nknow\nmy colleague who i dislike will get the\npromotion i'm gonna have to report into\nthem like there's a lot of doomsday in\ntheir head\nand so they go home they they take care\nof their dad they take their dad to the\nemergency room they spend the bulk of\nthe day there they miss their meeting\nyou know their colleague has the meeting\nso the the person is kind of screwed\num they're sitting in the emergency room\nuh\nroom with their dad watching the\ntelevision\nwhen they see that something has\nhappened\nand that it turns out that\na plane has flown into the building\nwhere they work\nand it happened to be september 11th\n2001.\nand so this person\nwas so upset about the promotion real\nstory by the way so at mclean hospital\nthey have a program a trauma program for\nfirst responders\nand i was running groups with this\nprogram\num when i ended up meeting this person\nand they sort of shared this story with\nme\nand\nturns out that if they had been in the\noffice that day\nthey wouldn't be alive\nand so like you know it really struck me\nlike so we had a long conversation about\nkarma real story 100\num so we had a conversation about\nkarma\nand\nyou know\nwhat's good for you and what's not good\nfor you and this person was really\nfantastic they were sharing a lot of\ntheir perspective about what they\nlearned from this experience\nand so it really makes me wonder like\nwhat is the right decision and what is\nthe wrong decision right so how do you\nmeasure it\nlike\nhow do you measure it right how do you\nknow if you're making the right decision\nor the wrong decision so i'll give you\nguys like another example so this is\nlike a personal one that i'm sure y'all\nhave heard before so there's no\nsituation in which a 4.0 is inferior to\na 2.5 right like you always want a 2.5\ngpa you never want a 4.0 gpa\nand when i was in school i was sure that\ni was making all the wrong decisions\nlike i was sleeping through spanish\nclass\ngot an f in spanish chat first semester\nof freshman year first f\ngg\nand so you you can't think in that\nmoment you're thinking oh this is the\nwrong decision like i should have gotten\nan a right because an a is better but it\nturns out that if people who are\nstruggling to find motivation\non the internet\nif they listen to someone who's gotten a\n4.0 their entire life\nthey're going to have trouble relating\nto that person or the person who's\ngotten a 4.0 their entire life will have\ntrouble relating to them\nand so it's kind of bizarre but like we\njust don't know what the right decisions\nare or the wrong decisions you can even\nlogically like even if you step away\nfrom my two visceral examples and you\nsay dr k you're you're not\nforming a good enough argument\nso then i'm curious like genuinely\nforget about what i say\nwhat are the metrics that you measure a\ndecision by right is it what happens in\nthe future so then the question is kind\nof interesting because it's like\nyou know like even if circumstances like\nif i\nyou know if i drive drunk for example\nand i don't get into an accident\nis that the right decision or the wrong\ndecision to drive drunk because there\nwas no consequence\nright so do you measure a right decision\nor wrong decision by the consequence\nwell that's kind of interesting because\nit doesn't feel to me that like i think\ndriving drunk is always bad like\nirrespective of whether you dodge a\nbullet or not\nand so how do you measure what is this\nidea of right decision or wrong decision\nreally think about that if you're\nparalyzed because you're trying to make\nthe right decision how the f would you\neven know\nwhat does that mean for you what does it\nmean to you to make the right decision\nand what nyani yog that's what nyan yogg\nsort of teaches is ask yourself where do\nyou get this concept\nof a right decision or wrong decision\nand now it turns out that the concept\ncomes from a couple of different places\nso the truth of the matter is that\nthere are two things going on here if\nyou're stuck in making the right\ndecision versus wrong decision two two\nissues at play\none is like a cognitive challenge or\nproblem\ncalled the planning fallacy\nand the second is the way that we're\nconditioned so the first thing to\nunderstand is the planning fallacy and\nthis is why you can't make the right\ndecision\nso\npeople want to make plans why do you\nwant to make a plan you want to make a\nplan so that you end up\nthings end up going well right that's\nwhy you want to make the right decisions\nso you plan out\nwhat decisions you're going to make so\nyou end up in the place that you want to\ngo that's what a right decision is\nthe problem is that when do you make a\nplan you make a plan at the beginning\nand\nhow much information do you have at the\nbeginning you have the least information\nhow much information do you have at the\nend you have the most information\ntherefore when can you make the best\nplan the best plan can be made at the\nend and the worst plan can be made at\nthe beginning\ntherefore in a weird way\nany plan that you make kind of\nprojecting into the future it's not\ntechnically true this way but it's the\nplanning fallacy\nit's just this idea that when you try to\nmake a plan like if you're trying to\nfigure out what you want to measure at\nthe age of 18 and you feel locked into\nthat\nyou don't understand anything about the\ncareers that you're committing to right\nlike you don't understand like if you\nmajor in pre-med you have no idea what\nit's like to be a doctor and this is a\nprime example of the planning fallacy\nthat when you make plans you have the\nleast amount of information therefore\nthey end up being the worst plans that\nyou could by definition make because you\ndon't have enough information\nthe best decision the best way to figure\nout what you should major in college is\nto go to college 40 years figure out\nwhat the right major is go back in time\nand tell your 18 year old self hey this\nis what you'll major in because it'll\nwork for you\nbut we can't do that that's the planning\nfallacy this is the first thing that\nyou're paralyzing yourself with\nthe second thing is that we're\nconditioned so why is it so hard okay so\nthen like the answer to the planning\nfallacy is to iterate right so the right\nmove is like you can't figure everything\nout from day zero so you collect\ninformation over time and you course\ncorrect so like you have to iterate like\ni'm gonna try majoring in this and i'm\ngonna recognize\nthat this may not be the right choice\nand then i will adjust and adapt\nbut we can't do that right so then the\nquestion is like why can't we just like\nif i were to tell you hey man just adapt\niterate you know it's not going to be\nperfect first time around you'll get\nthere eventually\nwhy is that so hard for people to\nimplement because it is right i can say\nthat but it's not like people are just\ngonna do it\nand that's because of our conditioning\nso this is unfortunate but society\nconditions us to be\nperfect and fast so we're conditioned\ninto thinking that society and life is a\nrace\nokay so the interesting thing is that\nsociety doesn't actually reward\ncompetence they reward speed to\ncompetence\nlet me give you an example\nso\nif i\nlet's say i'm in a class like let's say\ni have a math class okay and the math\nclass has three tests and a final\nand let's say that the final as a proper\nfinal exam covers all of the material\nthroughout the whole year so it has\nevery single thing that i've learned in\nthe math class that gets tested in a\nfinal that's why it's called a final\nexam\nso the grading for the class is that the\nfirst test is worth 20 the second test\nis worth twenty percent the third test\nis worth twenty percent that's sixty\npercent final is worth forty percent\nsuper normal situation\nso let's say that i didn't understand\nanything in the first test didn't\nunderstand anything in the second test\ndidn't understand anything in the third\ntest\nsomething happened in my mind i crammed\ni learned all of the math that i'm\nsupposed to and i get 100 on the final\nand i got zeros on the first three tests\ndo i pass the class or do i fail the\nclass\neven though i may know the most math out\nof everyone in the class and i've\nmastered all the concepts of mathematics\neven though i get 100 on the final i\nstill fail the class\nand it's the kid who got 80\nthe whole way through that passes the\nclass\nright so even though technically i know\nmore mathematics than they do\ni fail when they pass\nso our system\nis designed for rapid\nprogression to perfection it's not about\nlearning everything it's about\nbeing impervious to making mistakes\nour society conditions us\nto not make mistakes and not iterate it\ndemands perfection from the get-go how\ndo you become valedictorian of your high\nschool why do we care about\nvaledictorians do valedictorians know\nthe most maybe not we have no idea\nthat's not what valedictorian measures\nwhat valedictorian measures is who has\nbeen perfect from day one who has been\nthe most perfect the fastest and most\nconsistently that's actually what life\nrewards\nor that's what society rewards i should\nsay not life so this is why\nvaledictorians are more competitive to\nget into college right so once again if\nyou're at the top of your class in high\nschool then you get into a better\ncollege if you get into a better college\nthen you're going to get a better job if\nyou get a better job you're going to\nmake more money if you make more money\nyou're going to be more attractive to\npeople to mate with\nand then you'll end up having your\nchoice and a better choice of who you\nend up marrying and if you marry the\nright person then you're going to have\nbetter kids and now we see that since\nsociety has conditioned us this way\nthere's no room for mistakes why it's so\ndamn paralyzing to not to to make a\nchoice\nbecause if you don't board that train\nbecause that's what life is right it's a\ntrain you board the fast train you're on\nthe fast track in life it's a race right\nso oh yeah like i want my kid so my\nparents wanted me to skip a grade so i\nskipped a grade and i was like okay fine\nand then like i started school when i\nwas young\nand then like\nsucked at sports\nand then they want you to race through\nlife as quickly as possible\neveryone wants to take ap classes in\nhigh school so they can graduate from\ncollege in three years and now there's\neven abbreviated med schools that are\nthree years instead of four inside in\nthe u.s\nso now at the age of 24 i can graduate\nfrom medical school i can finish my\ntraining at the age of 28\nright\nbeing a psychiatrist\neveryone thinks it's a little and what\nhappens after 28 like what then then\ni've won i've won the game of life\nand i won at 28\nwhich is better than winning at 40\nobviously\nbecause then you start living at 20.\nit's like wait a minute hold on what\nso our society conditions us\nto be terrified of making the wrong\nchoice\nabsolutely terrified because it punishes\nus\nfrom before making the wrong choice and\nthat punishment sits with us for the\nrest of our life right it's like once\nyou get one f in a class your gpa is\nforever ruined there's no way to escape\nyour mistake\nand now we wonder why are so many young\npeople\nterrified of making the wrong choice\nit's because they've grown up in a\nsociety that does not\nlet them make mistakes\nit doesn't matter what you actually end\nup understanding so thankfully medicine\nis a little bit different\nsomewhere along the way medicine realize\nlike in residency you don't have grades\njust think about this residence is when\nyou actually learn medicine you no\nlonger have grades there's no grade\nresidency is when you're taking care of\nheart attacks you're learning how to\ntake care of heart attacks you're\nlearning how to deal with narcissists\nyou're learning how to deal with addicts\nyou're learning how to deal with\npeople who are you know having asthma\nlearning how to talk to pre-diabetics\nthis is when you're actually learning\nhow to save lives\nand there's no grades why because grades\ndon't matter at that point it's not\nabout the grade\ngrades are a way to measure against\nyour colleagues\nit's a way to differentiate human beings\nit's an approximation of differentiation\nit's a way for people who are reviewing\napplications to say this person is\nbetter than this person that is the\npurpose of a grade\nonce it actually comes to saving lives\nno one cares\ndo you guys know like think about your\ndoctor if you all have a good doctor do\nyou know what their grades were do you\ncare what their grades are does anyone\ncare what their grades are\ndoes anyone care that they were\nvaledictory of their high school no one\ncares because at that point there's a\nreal world consequence\nso we get paralyzed because we have been\nconditioned\non a system that does not relate to\nreality\nit doesn't really matter\nand so now this is like we see like why\nyou're so paralyzed because you just\nlike because the consequences will live\nwith you for the rest of your life\nso let's look at this\nparalyzed by making fear of the wrong\nlife choices\nright\nand then like you don't even truly know\nwhat you want anymore because you're so\nparalyzed by making the wrong choice\neven if you you you knew what you wanted\nat some point\nbut then you were afraid it was the long\nwrong choice so then you started the\nprocess of convincing yourself that you\ndidn't even want it\nand then you're confused by what you\nwant because you knew what you want then\nyou killed it inside you\nbecause it was the wrong choice\nand now you're confused you're\ndirectionless like what do i do i don't\neven know what i want yeah that's\nbecause\nyou took it out back\nand asked it\nbecause i fear that i might start\nsomething and end up not liking it and\nthere'll be no way to get out of it\nwhere do you think this attitude comes\nfrom it comes from gpas because if you\nmake an f\nthat'll live with you for the rest of\nyour life if you fall behind in the race\nof life if you're 23 and graduating from\ncollege there's no way you will ever\ncatch up to the 22 year olds who\ngraduated from college time is limited\nthe sand in the hourglass has run out\nand you are screwed\nparalyzed with indecision\nso what does neon yog say non-yogg says\nfirst understand this\nfirst and foremost\nand then understand is this actually\ntrue\nso evaluate it for yourself is there a\nright decision or a wrong decision\ncan i end up screwed in life and the\nshort answer is yes you can so then nyan\nyogg says what are you going to do about\nit let us assume that it is possible\nthat you can make the wrong choice which\ni'm not even sure is correct but\nyan yoga will still say so be it this is\na fact of life\nthat you could be screwed you could make\nthe wrong choice any building that you\nwalk into\ncould collapse on your head\nit's possible what are you going to do\nabout it yan yoga will then ask you how\nare we going to live in this world of\nuncertainty\nand this is where like all the yogis\nthey get back to living in the present\nright so make the best choice you can\ntoday\niterate recognize that's where iteration\ncomes from iteration is making the best\nchoice you can today\nrecognizing that it may be the wrong\nchoice it may be a stupid choice but\nyou'll figure that out tomorrow and then\nyou're going to make the best choice you\ncan tomorrow\nand then over time you will learn how to\nmake the right choices\nwhich i recognize is sort of a paradox\nbecause we're saying there isn't the\nright choice\nbut it's almost like a game of texas\nhold'em\nright where like\nyou're like\nyou get your first two cards\nand you don't know what the flop is\ngonna be\nyou know\nyou don't know what the turn is going to\nbe you don't know what the river is\ngoing to be so you make a bet based on\nthe knowledge that you have\nthe flop shows up some cards show up oh\nmy god\nboy did i screw up you adjust\naccordingly\nthen the turn then the river and then\nyou may win and you may lose but the\ncool thing is that even though the poker\nplayers don't can't they can never see\nthe future they can never see the flop\nthey never do and yet some people are\ngood at poker and some people are bad at\npoker how do poker players get good\nthey start to learn okay this is how\nmuch i should do here this is how much i\nshould do here they learn how to live\nwith uncertainty they learn how to make\nprobabilistic bets\nand that's all you can do in life that's\nwhat it means to make\nto live in the present moment you're\nmaking a probabilistic bet\nand this is why it's hard for people who\nare trying to make the right choice\npeople who make their trying to make the\nright choice are basically doing one of\nthese video game runs with one\nhp it's like one hp and you wipe\ntheir strategy is to be perfect from day\none right it's 4.0 in high school 4.0 in\ncollege 4.0 in med school\nthat's their strategy\nis the no hit run\nright that's what they want to do\nbut that's not a very reliable strategy\nwhat's far more reliable is to tank up\nand find some healing pots\nand then just take the damage and heal\nup and keep going it's far more reliable\nthat is the iterative strategy that is\nliving in the present moment so make the\nbest decision that you can today\nrecognize that there's no such thing as\nthe right decision or the wrong decision\nthere's only the best decision you can\nmake today and then you may be paralyzed\nyou're like oh my god what is the best\ndecision i make today oh my god how do i\nknow which one's best\nnext thing nyan yog tells you is there's\nno such thing as a best decision just\nmake a decision make the one that feels\nthe best to you right now\nright that's what neon yog says\nand then you're like okay but what if it\ngoes wrong and then yan yog says then it\ngoes wrong\nand then you adjust tomorrow but what if\ni'm screwed then you're screwed you\ncan't prevent being screwed you can just\ntry to not be screwed that's the most\nthat you can do\nnow one other thing\nto point out\nokay before we jump into the meditation\num as a kid i was easily overwhelmed and\nwould often have this feeling of time\nrunning out and then i would throw this\ntantrum because i felt trapped as if the\nwalls were closing in on me\ntoday this is this feeling persists in\nmy decision making though not as\nstrongly\nso\nis there something that will help with\nthis so this is that's\nnow we're gonna go in a different\ndirection okay\nthis chat is what we call a sum scar\nso some scar is a ball of undigested\nemotion that lives within us\nand activates at particular times and\ninterferes with the function of our mind\nso this person\nhas this fear from a young age that\nprevents them from making decisions over\ntime\nwhat they've learned how to do is\nsuppress that feel fear they've kept it\nfrom so their brain is developed enough\nto where they no longer throw a tantrum\nbut the core of the feeling is still\nthere so this is something if you guys\nhave watched dr k's guide and you've\nlooked at the vedic psychology thing and\nyou've you guys have watched falling\nbehind fantasy trap or any of those\nother like depression uh videos right so\nthese are the videos that explore the\ncommon like\ncomplexes that people will experience\nthat lead to depression\nso if you all have watched that you'll\nrecognize this as a samskar\nand this is the wild thing is that as\nlong as you that some scar exists within\nyour mind you will continue to have this\nfeeling and if you truly want to be free\nof this you have to digest that some\nscar you have to go to the root of the\nfear why do you feel trapped\nyour mind has learned that if you don't\nmake the right decision you're going to\nget trapped it is learn that lesson and\nso any time you try to make a a decision\nthere's a voice in your head that says\ndon't make that decision we're not sure\nit's right we don't want to be trapped\nso even if you try to live in the\npresent there's something within your\nmind that says no no no living the\npresent is an idiotic idea\nthis whole living in the present thing\nwhat if you screw up then we're gonna\nhave to live with it for the rest of our\nlives and we'll be trapped\nthere's a sensation of making a decision\nand becoming trapped by that decision\nthat comes from somewhere you weren't\nwell\nthat comes from a some scar there's\nabsolutely a process to discover and\ndigest that some scar it's much more\ncomplicated we offer you an introduction\nin dr k's guide\nthe thing to understand is that some\nscar comes from an experience and this\nis where depending on either you can\nfind the experience\nor the yogis have hypothesized that it\ncould come from a past life\nso if you were born this way\nthere's still a some scar right because\nthere's a clear set of programming that\nactivates in your mind almost like\nmalware in a particular situation\njust because you cannot psychologically\nfind the root of it in this life doesn't\nmean that it doesn't exist and this is\nwhere i don't even know how to explain\nthis but i just know it's true\nthat as a psychotherapist i have\nprocessed i've done trauma processing\nwork\nwith people\nfor things that have never happened to\nthem\nthat is the best way i can describe it\nso i've processed non-existing traumas\nfor my patients and it works wonderfully\nclinically they improve drastically so\none interpretation of this is that there\nis something that is from a past life\nand in my\ni i don't know that that's i don't think\nit's evidence for that by the way so i\nthink what's just as equally likely is\nthat they had some kind of experience\nlike some kind of imaginary experience\nvery young like maybe they were two\nyears old and they watched a movie and\nthat movie was so emotionally engaging\nit essentially traumatized them\nmaybe they just forgot the experience\nand can't recall it because memory isn't\nperfect there are all kinds of things a\nlot of people will jump to past lives\nand reincarnation as a scientist i don't\nthink i can do that\ni think what i would rather conclude is\nwhat i did which is that\nprocessing traumas that did not ever\nhappen to a person that they can recall\nseems to be clinically beneficial\nthat is the statement i'm happy to stand\nbehind\nso\ncould be a some scar from a past life\nwho knows right that depends on your own\nworld view what you choose to believe\nwhat you choose to explore\nand so at the end of the day you have to\ndeal with that root of if i make the\nwrong decision i will feel trapped where\ndid you learn that what does that mean\nfor you\nbe a nyani yogi and explore that\nthe last thing that i'll leave y'all\nwith\nis a meditation of sorts so one is you\ncan do the path of nyanyog that's\nmeditation number one which is to ask\nyourself what is the right decision and\nwhat is a wrong decision try to get as\nprecise of an answer as you can\ndon't give up\ngive me the definition of a right\ndecision or wrong decision and how can i\nmake the right decision or wrong\ndecision\ni want you all to like\nanyone who comes up with a good answer\npost it on the subreddit if you think\nyou have found the correct answer post\nit\nlet's see what the community can come up\nwith how do you know how can you make\nthe right decision and how can you make\nthe wrong decision that is the question\nso that's an exercise of nyan yoga the\nsecond thing\nkind of out of left field\nso i want you to close your eyes for a\nmoment and say to yourself i am that\nsay it to yourself three times\ni am that\ni am that\ni am that\nso now what i want you all to do is go\nahead and open your eyes\nand then anytime you are struggling with\nsomething\nsay to yourself that is you\nthat thing that you are struggling with\ni am that\nso i know it sounds kind of weird\nso if you're struggling with another\nperson say to yourself that i am that\nthat is a part of me that human being is\na part of who i am i am that person if\nyou're struggling with making a decision\nwhat major to use or to pick\ni am that\ni am\nchoosing a major\nnot like i am\nnot like the verb\ni am the thing of choosing a major that\ncomplex that decision making process\nthat is what i am\nit's kind of weird i want you all to\npractice it for a while it's a more\nadvanced technique of meditation but\nrepeat to yourself i am that see the\npart of yourself in that external thing\nas best as you can\nstart to realize that there is no\ndifference between you and another\nperson there's no difference between you\nand a cop\nand that comes from i am that\nyou"
