    "transcript": "so i suspect that a lot of this person's\nproblems are not due to\nthe low iq this is not what's dooming\nthem\nthey are doomed but\nwhat\nwhat they're doomed by is their belief\nof their own success or their inability\nto become successful\nmy iq is below average\nwhat are some of the ways i can live a\nsuccessful and meaningful life\nhello dr k i'm a young adult male and\ni'm currently going through an\nexistential crisis where i believe that\ni am not going to make it in life\ni don't have any skills or talents that\nmakes me unique in\nin the direction of my life is going to\na complete disaster the direction of my\nlife is going to a complete disaster and\nnothing can be done\ni'm in college studying business that\ncan't get me anywhere\nuh i'm still living with my parents\nbecause i don't have stable income to\nsurvive on i can't do basic tasks\nsuch as using the cash register at work\nfolding clothes sweeping and cleaning my\nhouse\nthere's so many tasks that i can't do\nright\ni can't pay attention in my college\nclasses i take longer to understand\nthings more than others and i struggle\nto think fast\nit's horrible because my parents\nconstantly put me down and compare me to\nmy peers who are doctors lawyers and\nsoftware engineers making far more than\ni do\nthe huge issue that's affecting me is my\nlow iq i took an iq test when i was in\nschool by the psychologist and i scored\naround 80 which is exactly below average\nafter this the psychologist even felt\npity for me and told me to my face that\ni won't amount to anything in life\ni swear to god that i am probably the\ndumbest to walk this earth\ni am extremely unsure of how i will\nsurvive in this world\nas\nthat if your iq is below 87 you can't\nwork any type of job to survive\nthis seems embarrassing because it's\ndifficult when i want to move out\nwhen i want to move out my parents house\ni'm not financially stable to do it i\nget depressed every day knowing that i\ncan't prove myself to others my dreams\nof being a physicist or an investment\nbanker please don't laugh are not going\nto happen because because of this curse\ni was thinking about jumping off a\nbuilding one day because i can't take\nthis [ __ ] anymore\nso\nthe first point\nright is if you're really considering if\nyou're having thoughts of hurting\nyourself or jumping off of a building\nyou may want to actually seek\nprofessional help right so like this is\nsomething and we'll talk about why that\nmay be particularly important for this\nperson\num so what we're gonna actually do is\ntake a step back and and look at\nlet's talk about a couple things okay so\nwe're gonna talk about iq we're going to\ntalk about this person's situation and\nwe're going to talk a little bit about\nif your iq is below average can you have\na successful and meaningful life\nspoiler alert my answer is going to be\nyes\nbut it is my job to convince you of that\nright i'm not necessarily correct\nit may not be possible so let's just try\nto be\nas objective as we can and kind of think\nthrough it\nokay\nso let's start with this\nwhat is a successful and meaningful life\nhow do we define that\nright so\nthat's the first question is like what\nis a successful and meaningful life\ncan anyone give me an answer\nwhat do you all think\nhow do you determine what a success\ni i don't know\nright so okay so like people are sort of\nsaying like let's just think through\nthis right\nso\nif your goal is to have a successful and\nmeaningful life which i have i have no\nyou know i think that's wonderful that\nyou want that\nlet's first start by like understanding\nwhat it is that you're shooting towards\nokay so\nlet's think about it okay what\nis right so like i don't know so people\nare saying income\nokay being productive\nbeing happy\nand so this is kind of interesting but\nlike having your needs met\nexcellent\nright so this all like is good\nfulfillment\nbut what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna say\ni'm gonna go ahead and\ncall an audible here and i'm going to\nmove this one up here because then like\nthe next question is like what is\nfulfillment right\nchat it's like what does that even mean\nso now the next question is so if if you\nwant to determine whether you can have a\nsuccessful or meaningful life the next\nthing that we need to do is sort of try\nto figure out\nwhat are the things that correlate with\nuh\nwith this right so then the next\nquestion is does iq\nsomehow correlate with these things\nokay\nso like i i think we can clearly say\nthat probably like iq and income is\ngoing to be like correlated\nbut i don't know that iq and\nproductivity happy or getting your needs\nmet is necessarily correlated maybe\nbecause of this we can also say that\nneeds met in terms of financial\nso maybe your financial needs can be met\nthis way\nbut once again i say this as a\npsychiatrist who's worked with many many\npeople who are like very narcissistic\nand very successful ie investment\nbankers\ni can pretty much tell you that like you\nknow\nsure they have the income and they may\nbe sort of productive but they certainly\ndon't feel that way oftentimes they work\na lot but they don't really feel\nproductive because all they're doing is\nediting powerpoints i kid you not like\ntheir job is like okay they get a\npowerpoint at midnight and their you\nknow their\npartner says hey i need this by 6 a.m\nmake these changes\nso they spend 6 hours running models\nmaking these changes to a 35\nslide deck\nand they make the changes and they send\nit out to the whole team the other\npartner on the team is says hey\nthese changes are bad i need you to make\nthese changes i needed you to revert\nback to what we had before\nand so like it's just like constantly\nadding editing slide decks to meet the\npreferences and whims of a particular\nperson\nso i i certainly will attest to the fact\nthat many of them are not happy they\ndon't feel fulfilled they don't have\nmeaning they certainly have income\nbut they they pay the price of\nfulfillment success meaning and\nhappiness\nthat's what they pay for money right so\nthat's what they like they get money and\nthen they have\nthey don't have those other things so\ni'm not really sure that you know aside\nfrom income\niq is necessarily correlated with like\nother things\nso that's the first thing so you may not\nbe screwed in life just because you have\na low iq now let's let's kind of also\nkind of look at things a little bit more\nobjectively and sort of try to\nunderstand okay like what's up with iq\nso here's what what we need to\nunderstand about iq\nso the the mean no sorry\nmean median iq is about a hundred and\none standard deviation which is about 70\nof people\nare between 85 and 115 so one standard\ndeviation is about 15. so this is where\nmost people live below 85 we start to\nget to you know there's about 15 percent\nthat are less than this\nand 15 over here\nthat are greater than this right\nand so 80 is like\nright over here and so even if you're\nbelow average on iq\nit doesn't mean that you're like\ndevastatingly screwed\nso that you know the number at which we\nreally kind of think about intellectual\ndisability is actually like below 70. so\nonce you cross 70 because remember one\nstandard deviation is 15\nright so a second standard deviation is\n70. so this is where you start to get it\ninto the mild intellectual disability\nrange\nand this is where you may not really be\nable to\nuh\nfor example be a physicist i don't know\nif someone with a iq of less than 70 can\nbe a physicist i just don't know i'm not\nsaying that they can't\nbut in this 70 to 85 range i personally\ndon't think that this person is quite as\nscrewed as they think they are\num so you can still like hold a normal\njob it may take you longer to learn\nparticular things there are lots of\ndifferent jobs where you don't\nnecessarily need to have a high iq to be\nsuccessful\nand so let's kind of flip back to the\npost for a second and take a look at\nyou know what's going on here so i\nsuspect that a lot of this person's\nproblems are not due to\nthe low iq this is not what's dooming\nthem\nthey are doomed but\nwhat what they're doomed by is their\nbelief of their own success or their\ninability to become successful\nokay so now we're going to talk a little\nbit about this so like this person has a\nproblem of\nif you read this post\nit can be summarized with this statement\ni will fail\nokay so let's just kind of look through\nthis for a second\num\nso i'm currently going through an\nexistential crisis where i believe i am\nnot going to make it in life\nokay\nthat's the first thing they say not\ngonna make it\nokay and then\num\nuh\ni don't have any skills\nor talents no skills or talents\nso they believe this right the direction\nof my life is complete disaster\nand um\ni'm in college studying business that\ncan't get me anywhere not going anywhere\nright and then i want to fast forward so\nthey're you know they talk about all the\nthings that they have difficulty doing\nokay so can't perform basic tasks can't\ndo basics\num\nparents constantly put me down\nokay\nand then uh\ncan't prove myself so we're gonna jump\nthere's the iq paragraph and then can't\nprove myself\nso we're gonna analyze\nwhat this person is saying okay and then\nwe're gonna talk about dreams so these\nare the things that i want you all to\ntake away okay so they're not gonna make\nit they have no skills or talents their\nlife is a complete disaster they're not\ngoing anywhere they can't do basic tasks\ntheir parents constantly put them down\nthey can't you can't prove yourself and\nyou have particular dreams\nso you may say like wow that sounds kind\nof rough\nso here here are the points right so\nthis is what is in the post\nand now we're going to kind of examine\nit so our examination is going to be\nhere\nso it starts with this idea that i will\nfail\nokay now this is really important\nbecause the i will fail idea affects us\nin two ways\nso one is it creates something called a\nnocebo effect so we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about psychology and\nso science\nis something called the placebo effect\nwhich is that if someone believes that a\nmedication will work it is more likely\nto work so you can even give someone\nwho's got like diabetes let's say a\nsugar pill the irony and the irony is\nthat if they believe that the medication\nwill lower their blood sugar even though\nit's a sugar pill if they believe it'll\nlower their blood sugar it actually\nlowers their blood sugar some that's\ncalled the placebo effect now the\nopposite end of the placebo effect is\ncalled the nocebo effect and i see this\na lot in psychiatry\nso sometimes i'll get people who come\ninto my office and they'll say\nmedication has never worked for me\nmedication does not work\nso they they're coming into my office\nwith a nocebo effect and even the\nthought that medication never works for\nme is going to actually affect\nthe efficacy of medication\nso if you go through your life thinking\nyou will fail there's actually\nscientific data to back this up\nit's not just like a psychological thing\nit's like it's even like a\nneuroscientific thing right so this is\nimportant to understand that this works\nfor physical medicines so forget about\npsychology for a second we're talking\nabout diabetes levels cholesterol levels\nresponse to chemotherapy and cancer\ntreatment that the nocebo effect is\nactually active in all divisions of\nmedicine so it's not just psychological\nit's physiological\nso what this sort of means is that you\nactually if you believe you're going to\nfail you are actually more likely to\nfail and i don't just mean\npsychologically it's not like oh i\nbelieve i'm going to fail therefore i'm\nnot going to try as hard etc etc i'm not\ntalking about psychological stuff i mean\nlike physiologically your body is\nprepped to try to create failure\nso second thing this is going to be a\nlittle bit more psychological or\nneuroscientific has to do with our\nsuccess calculation\nso\nour brain\nhas this circuit that that performs\nsuccess calculations so it basically\nperforms this calculation that sort of\ndetermines motivation and behavior\nokay so let me give you guys an example\nso this morning i did not wake up go out\nto my garage grab a shovel and start\ndigging for buried treasure\nwhy did i not do that because my brain\nperformed a calculation that was like\nhey by the way if you dig for buried\ntreasure you're probably not going to\nfind it so there's no point in trying\nokay now we also see this kind of\nmotivational stuff happen with people\nwho have difficulty with dating\nso people who believe that they're going\nto be alone forever will be not\nmotivated to date or it'll be very\ndifficult for them to date because their\nbrain is literally making a calculation\nthat is like likelihood of success is\nlike a big part of the calculation\nand so if your likelihood of success is\nvery very low because you you believe\nyou will fail then your motivation is\ngoing to like be very very low okay\nso now\nwhat we sort of get is is like\na sort of a vicious cycle okay where i\nwill fail we've got the nocibo effect\nsuccess calculation is low decreased\nmotivation therefore\nthese two things are going to kind of\ncombine\nand result in a higher percent\nit's a\nit's a percent sign just poorly drawn\nlet me try to draw it again\nan increased percentage of failure\nright\nand so the more the more we fail the\nmore we get\nevidence\nthat\ni will\nfail\nand the stronger this gets this forms a\nfeedback loop\ngoes over here\nthis becomes stronger this becomes\nstronger this becomes stronger\nmotivation\nmotivation actually goes down so let's\nactually\ndo this\nright motivation decreases and then\nthese things in turn are going to\nincrease our chance of failure which\nwill in turn increase the evidence that\ni will fail which will then go back\naround and feed into this\nokay and this is how we see now i want\nyou guys to look at all these statements\nhow do where do you think these\nstatements came from\nwell actually let's stop here for a\nsecond\nokay\nwhere did these statements come from\nthese statements come from going through\nthe cycle over and over and over again\nhas nothing to do with iq\nso like iq may actually result in a\ngreater chance a lot having lower iq may\nhave something to do with a greater\nchance of failure but this degree of\ncertainty about failure right so if you\nhad a confident person with loc iq and\ni've met with those people i i mean i i\nknow people like that like i have\nfriends like that\nyou know they just sort of like\nunderstand the limits of their ability\nbut they are actually like sort of\nchilling in life right they're kind of\nchilling they're like they have their\njob they're not going to be\nthey're not actually super ambitious or\nsometimes they actually are super\nambitious and can be very very good at\nstuff\num so for example i have a friend who's\na chef who probably has like a below\naverage iq they've been tested as well\nwe're going to talk about testing in a\nsecond\num but\nyou know so they they're they tested\nbelow average and they just went to\nculinary school and they're like they're\ndoing fine in life they're actually like\npretty ambitious they're pretty\nproductive they're\nnot happy but for reasons that i think\nare unrelated to their iq or their\nprofessional success so a lot of\nprofessions out there that don't require\na high iq that you can also still be\nlike very reliable very successful um i\nthink that there are a lot of positions\nthat people with higher iq may find\nboring\nthat people with lower iq may be better\nsuited for so there may be a certain\namount of like you know day in and day\nout kind of stuff that like organizing\nstuff like those kinds of things jobs\nlike being a personal assistant there's\na lot of stuff out there where people\nwith low iq may be better suited towards\nnow let's remember that this person\nwants to be a physicist or an investment\nbanker so we don't want to alter their\ndreams based on hey you can't be a\nphysicist or an investment banker\nyou need to be a personal assistant or a\nchef like we don't want to say that to\nthis person that's not what i'm saying\nalthough i suspect that based on their\nattitude\nthey are interpreting things that way so\nlike let's look at this\nafter this the psychologist even felt\npity for me and told me to my face that\ni won't amount to anything in life\ni highly highly highly doubt this\nstatement\nthe psychologist would have to be the\nworst psychologist on the planet to tell\nyou to your face that i won't amount to\nanything hey you're not going to amount\nto anything in life\nthey may have said hey it may be hard\nfor you to become an investment banker\nor physicist\nthey may have said something like that\nbut\ngiven this\nwhat the psychologist said may be\ninterpreted in this way\ngiven your attitude you may be even\ninterpreted what i said as hey you can\nnever become a physicist or an\ninvestment banker which i didn't say\nthat\nright we may be a great physicist or\ninvestment picker i don't know\nlet's finish kind of analyzing this okay\nso that's where all so these statements\ncome from this cycle\nand the question is okay so like if this\nis a cycle where does it\nstart here's where it starts\nright so if your parents because this is\nthe thing i don't think they just\nstarted comparing you to people who are\ndoctors and lawyers like just over the\nlast year\nchances are as you were growing up your\nparents started by putting you down a\nlot they made lots of comparisons they\nsort of didn't accept you for who you\nare and wanted you to be something else\nso as parents\nparental comparison\nis where the cycle starts\nhate to blame the parents so this is\njust a hypothesis maybe maybe your\nparents were wonderful who knows i'm not\nsaying they aren't wonderful but if they\ncompare you a lot this is where the kind\nof cycle starts right because what\nthey're always doing no matter how hard\nyou succeed with parental comparison\nlet's look at it this way okay\nso they say\nwhy can't you okay so they'll say\nhere's you\nhere's someone else\nso\nwhy did you get a c\nsomeone else got a b\nright\nwhy can't you be like this person this\nperson gets b's\nif you get a b\nwhat\nwhy don't you get an a\nright\nwhy are you studying business\nthis person is pretty med\nyou're a doctor\nwhy don't you go to harvard\nright\nif you go to harvard\nwhy the [ __ ] are you becoming a\npsychiatrist\nright it's such a waste of your talents\nyou're too smart to be a psychiatrist\nyou should do something that's more\ncompetitive like cardiology\nmy point is that iq\ndoesn't really determine this\nit's the parental comparison\nright so the parental comparison is\nwhere this starts and no matter\nwhat you accomplish\nthey're always comparing you to someone\nbetter\nit doesn't really matter\nhow good you are\nright\nlike it doesn't matter if parents are\ngoing to compare if they're not going to\naccept you for who you are like they're\ngoing to compare you and then the the\nconclusion from all of this\nis you're\nnot\ngood enough\nand then it's a it's a very short hop\nskip and a jump\nto\nyou\nwill\nfail\nand thus the cycle begins\nokay\nso this is the kind of thing where i\nthink that what's holding this person\nback is not actually their iq although\ni'm not disputing that you know i don't\nknow that like\nsomeone within 80 iq i don't know\ntheir ability to become a physicist i i\njust don't know\nbut what i do think may be very very\npossible is for example if you love\nphysics and like you understand physics\nlike let's say that\nhow can i say this\nsometimes the worst students make the\nbest teachers\nso like i\nif it's hard for you to understand\nthings and you can get to that place of\nunderstanding\nyou may actually be a far better teacher\nthan someone with a very high iq and the\nreason for that is because people with\nthe high iq can just they can skip all\nthe middle steps but if you've got a low\niq you may learn things slower but you\nlearn things you learn all the middle\nsteps and you may actually be a better\nteacher\nso i know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike the reason that i'm really good at\nteaching motivation\nand understanding motivation is because\ni suck at it\nlike my internal motivational drive is\nvery very low and oddly enough that's\nactually like an advantage in a bizarre\nsituation\nright because like now i understand like\ni couldn't take motivation for granted\nit wasn't easy for me it was so hard all\nthe time\nand so that's what actually makes me\nlike an effective teacher on motivation\nbecause i can't take any of it for\ngranted i'm just assuming for a moment\nthat i'm an effective teacher on\nmeditation motivation which i may not be\nso the last thing that i want to point\nout is the statement of can't prove\nmyself so if you want to understand\nwhat leads you to being fulfilled\nand meaning\nif you're trying to prove yourself\nto other people\nthis is never going to happen\nso if you want to understand like okay\nhow do you become successful\nhere's what it is you start by\nunderstanding okay like here's my iq\ntotally fine\nyou understand what are the things\noutside of my iq that are holding me\nback because it's not just iq right it's\nthis belief that you're going to fail to\nunderstand okay this belief came from\nsomewhere so this is something that you\nmay want to work with a therapist right\nnot only for the suicidality but also\nlike for this kind of stuff like i'm not\nsaying go to a therapist just so you\ndon't kill yourself i'm saying go to a\ntherapist because first of all suicide\nis scary and you shouldn't kill yourself\nand the reason you shouldn't kill\nyourself is because i don't agree with\nthis premise and a therapist can help\nyou\nchange this\nthey can help you\ndo this\nand then suddenly all of this changes\nright then you're\nharnessing\nplacebo\ninstead of nocebo\nand then suddenly like things that even\nhave no biological effect\nare starting to work for you\nso you can absolutely do that\nthe other thing that i just want to\npoint out is iq tests i don't know\nexactly what the reliability of the iq\ntest is but if you're at 80 and you got\ntested once you know you need to be a\nlittle bit careful because i do believe\nthat iq tests are affected or confounded\nby different things like mood\nor you know stuff like depression\nso depending on when you took it there\nmay be like things that negatively\nimpact the reliability of the iq test\nso i also don't know like what the\nreliability between two tests is\nso for example like you know tests just\nhave different light reliability so if i\nif you get tested twice\nyou may\ndiscover that you're actually like\n90 the second time right there's\nprobably some amount of like\nmovement in terms of reliability now\ngenerally speaking iq tests should\ncontrol for things like age\nor um\nor like\nlevel of education i think they try to\ncontrol for those things but there may\nbe confounding variables so i don't you\nknow i don't know how to say this but\nlike an iq test is not like a biopsy\nright it's a test that tries to\napproximate your intelligence\nthe last thing is that iq tests don't\nreally look at eq\nso there are some people that i know for\nexample that are like average or even\nbelow average iq but are actually super\nhigh in the eq\ndomain and this could be you you never\nknow and if you're high in the eq domain\nyou can actually be very very successful\nand offer a lot of value to\nplaces so a good example of this is kind\nof interesting but if you look at\ninvestment banking\nthe people who are actually at the top i\nthink have an eq greater than iq\nsituation so the people who are have the\nhighest iq or the ones that are best\nat running models creating models doing\na lot of like the technical work\nbut actually if you want to really\nsucceed at the highest levels of\ninvestment banking it's about\nrelationships and relationship building\nit's about bringing the business in the\ndoor so iq is necessary for executing\nthe business eq is necessary for\nbringing the business in the door\nokay so you may not be screwed\nlast thing is that you know i'd say that\nif you're thinking about\nthe dreams right so this person dreams\nof being a physicist or an investment\nbanker which is totally fine you're\nallowed to have your dreams but i would\nbe really\ncurious\nlike i'm asking i'm telling you to be\ncurious\nabout where that dream comes from what\nis it like because like what do you know\nabout investment banking or being a\nphysicist why does that appeal to you\nwhy is that your dream and chances are\nyou have a particular vision of what\nthat looks like which may not actually\nbe a physicist or investment banker but\nonce you understand what appeals to you\nabout the investment banker or being a\nphysicist\nyou may be able to duplicate or satisfy\nthose needs in an alternate profession\nso a lot of people will have fantasies\nof like oh i want to be this because if\ni am this then i will be happy but what\nthey're really chasing is what they\nthink that thing is\nso we see this a lot in terms of like\nrelationships too where sometimes you'll\nhave like a vision of a person and\nyou'll be like oh i really want to love\nthat i want to be dating that person but\nyou don't really know who that person is\nand reality is very different from what\nfantasy you create in your mind so it's\nokay to have dreams i'm not saying\nabandon your dreams because you tested\nlow on your iq by all means go for it\nlike if you want to study business like\nstudy business and then apply for a job\nin an investment bank by all means go\nfor it but i'd also like encourage you\nto be curious about what does it mean to\nyou to be in investment banking what is\nit what is the kind of how would that\nfulfill you and once you understand what\nthat need is you may be able to fulfill\nit outside of investment banking which\nis how you get meaning and fulfillment\nyou"
