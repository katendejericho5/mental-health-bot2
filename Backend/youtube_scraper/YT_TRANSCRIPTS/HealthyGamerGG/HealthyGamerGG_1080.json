    "transcript": "so was this person mentally ill we have\nno idea\neven if the answer is yes i don't think\nthat that's an excuse\nand i think that we as a society need to\nstart calling out evil where we see it\nso let's just talk about the school\nshooting\nso the first thing is that i i don't\nknow what we can do about this so this\nhappens periodically i think one year\nago\num\nwe had there was a school shooting about\na year ago and like a bunch of media\noutlets and stuff reached out to me on\nmonday i'm actually going to be\nspeaking on a panel at the united\nnations counter-terrorism\nuh division about\nviolent extremism and like online\ncommunities\num so it's just bizarre that like\nliterally on monday like there's gonna\nbe a u.n thing\nwhere we're gonna be talking about this\nstuff but i i think that\nfirst of all like my heart goes out to\nthe community member who had to live\nthrough this\num\nmy heart goes out to like everyone else\nwho had to\nlive through this\num especially those that didn't get to\nlive through it\nand the parents and family members of\nthose that didn't get to live through it\num\ni'm gonna need a second\ni think i'm out of tissues gg chat\nso\nyou know i don't know what we do about\nthis\num\nbecause i think there are sometimes\nthere are problems in the world that we\ndon't know what to do with right so like\nthere are a lot of problems out there\nwhere\npeople say like i don't know what we can\ndo\nand um that's just not good enough\nright so like there are a lot of\nproblems out there where you can't say\nanymore like i don't know what we can do\nbecause there's like literally people\ndying\nlike that's not an exaggeration and this\nhappens again and again and it keeps\nhappening and i think that there's a lot\nthat we don't really know how to\napproach this problem\num\nso what we tend to do at healthy gamer\nis\ntry to like look at things authentically\nright so we try to like be\nnon-judgmental towards people we try to\num treat them like you know give them\nspace to like think and understand\nand try to figure out what's going on\nand do i think that we need to\nunderstand the psychology of school\nshooters absolutely\nbut i think that there's like a flip\nside to this coin which is\nthe more that we propagate this kind of\ndialogue and like the more that like for\nexample there are studies i believe that\nshow that\nincreased media coverage of particular\nthings like suicide or mass shooting\nactually propagates like some of those\nideas and beliefs and like leads to more\nevents so there are studies on suicide\nclusters for example where when you like\npropagate\nlike media coverage of a thing that it\nincreases the behavior of the thing so\npersonally at healthy gamer i feel a\nlittle bit\nhamstrung in terms of approaching this\nin the way that we usually do\ni don't know\nhow to deal with this\num because i think that you know really\nexploring it could actually have the\nopposite effect\nand so we want to understand the\npsychology of these people hopefully for\nthe goal of like altering their course\nand\nmy hope is that\nif you support people who are struggling\nthen they won't do bad things\nbut unfortunately i don't think that\nthat's true\ni think what tends to happen in school\nshootings is we talk about mental\nillness right so we say like oh this\nperson was depressed\nand so there's like\npathology of evil like that's what we do\nas a society now like as awareness and\nmental illness has grown\nwe've actually started to pathologize\nlike evil\nand as a psychiatrist that sort of\npisses me off because i think every time\nyou label a school shooter is mentally\nill\nyou're\ngiving a bad name to people who struggle\nwith mental illness\nand to a certain degree you're providing\nan excuse for the shooter\nso i i think this is an issue of dharma\nand adharma dharma beating being duty\nand adharma being not being your duty\nand i don't know that this is a problem\nof mental illness i think it simply\ncould be a problem of evil\nand one of the downsides of our society\nis that as we've stepped away from\nreligion we've stopped talking about sin\npeople don't talk about sin anymore\nright because it's so tied up with\nreligious concepts and beliefs and gets\ntangled up with other things that\ndiscussions of good and evil have been\nreduced to like you know discussions of\npsychiatry and psychology and like\nyou know which in a sense is helpful but\ni think that there's a certain point\nwhere you have to take responsibility\nfor your actions irrespective of like\nwhether you're mentally ill or not\ni also think as a society the more that\nwe sort of think about oh like maybe\nwhat the world needs is more therapy\nlike that may be true and it almost\ncertainly is\nand that's the way that i would approach\nthe problem like i would try to help the\npeople that are\nin their infancy of of becoming a school\nshooter and try to alter their course\nand at the same time there's a part of\nme that says like this is an act of evil\nand there should be\nno excuses given\ni do believe firmly as a psychiatrist\nthat it is not your fault if you were\nmentally ill but it is absolutely your\nresponsibility\nso i have\nsympathy for\nsomeone who struggles with alcohol\naddiction but i do not provide for them\na single excuse if they drive drunk and\nget into an accident and kill someone\nthis is where if you are struggling with\nan addiction or a mental health problem\nit is your responsibility and is up to\nyou to take care of it\nand i think failing in your duty to do\nthat absolutely lays the blame at your\nfeet\nso was this person mentally ill we have\nno idea\neven if the answer is yes i don't think\nthat that's an excuse\nand i think that we as a society need to\nstart calling out evil where we see it\nthe second thing is\nyou know like\ni know what i'm about to say is gonna be\nperceived as political and i guess it is\ni don't get to determine what is\npolitical and what isn't political\nbut\ni'm about to talk about gun control and\nmost of what i base this on is like in\nmy opinion not political beliefs but you\ncould argue that they are political\nbeliefs it's like research out of hsph\nor harvard school of public health where\nlike there's a lot of research that's\nbeen done there's some contrary research\nto this as well so for example like\naustralia demographically is very\nsimilar to the united states and the\nnumber of school shootings they have is\nlike a fraction of what we have because\nthey have strong gun control laws\nthere's counter evidence to that as well\nso for example massachusetts has\nstronger gun control laws and there's\nsome data that suggests that it doesn't\nactually\nreduce violent crime\nbut in my mind like\nin growing up in texas i can like\nabsolutely understand the love that\npeople have for guns and like i have\nneighbors and family members that really\nlike guns\nand that like that's totally fine like i\nget that the second amendment is\nimportant to people like i have nothing\nagainst all that\nand i understand that there are people\nout there\nthat\nlike to hunt it's a part of their family\nit's a part of their tradition that's\npart of their rights like that's totally\nfine like i understand that you guys\nlike to hunt\nbut the truth of the matter is is that\nevery year there are people out there\nwho literally hunt children\nlike that's what's going on that's not\nan exaggeration\nsomeone shows up with a school with a\nweapon and then they start hunting and\nthey hunt other human beings\nand so my question to the people who are\nlike\nit i'm not trying to make it political\nbut like if you are not in favor of gun\ncontrol then what i'm curious about is\nlike what's your plan\nlike that really that's what i want to\nunderstand and this is where i i'm not\nsaying it like is a political belief i\ndon't say it as an indictment i say it\nis like a medical doctor and a public\nhealth professional\nlike what's your plan to protect those\npeople\nso it's fine like i have nothing against\nthe second amendment i have nothing\nagainst like you owning a gun and i have\nnothing against you going hunting\nprovided it's not kids\nand so what i want to understand is like\nfor people who are\nanti-gun control laws\nlike literally what's your plan and you\ndon't get to say i don't know or it\nshouldn't be this way because this is\nscience this is fact this happened\nyesterday someone showed up at a school\nin with michigan and started opening\nfire\nso like what are you gonna do about that\nso it's fine if you want guns like\ntotally fine but like there needs to be\na plan in place\nto literally protect children from dying\nand i don't think that that's too much\nto ask\ni think that we've gotten to the point\nwhere like literally their plan is to\ni heard about this recently where they\nwere building a new school\nand the architect designed the school\nwith\ncarving hallways\nand why did they design the school with\ncurving hallways\nto reduce the line of sight for\npotential school shooters\nlike this is the plan like we're gonna\nget you're telling me that schools are\nnow being designed by\nfps developers\nlike are we gonna have random spawns for\nlike armor and double damage and\nteleporters like\nthat's literally what this has come to\nlike your solution is to design a school\nand costco by the way started selling\nbulletproof backpacks\nit's like are you serious that this is\nwhat your solution is that we're gonna\ngive\nkids bulletproof backpacks\nand design schools so that they don't\nhave line of sight to prevent school\nshooters\ni mean if that's really your answer i\nguess it's a answer but it feels like a\nterrible answer to me\nand on the one hand like\nyou know like fps designers should be\ndesigning video games not schools\nlike that's not their job their job is\nto design\nyou know\nhallways\nfor video games not for real life where\nthere are like 12 year olds and 15 year\nolds who are like walking down the\nhallway this is absurd\num\nyeah so\nyou know i i recognize once again that\nwhat i said was like political in nature\nbecause gun control is a political issue\nand that too by the way like boggles my\nmind that\nissues like kovid and\nyou know literally children dying in\nschools have become political issues as\nopposed to issues of public health or\nscience or medicine it's like in my mind\nthose things are quite divorce but that\ncould be like my ignorance\num\nand so i i just want to understand like\nfor people who are in favor of gun\ncontrol like what's the plan yo\nlike because this keeps happening\ni'm sorry people who are anti-gun\ncontrol\nyou know like\nlike it's to it's cool like you can have\nwhatever beliefs you want to but then\nlike what are we gonna do about that\nlike what's the practical like what does\nit look like\num and i encourage everyone you know i\nrecognize that people may want to bucket\nme into a political party or set a\npolitical beliefs\nbased on my statements\nbut chances are you'll be surprised at\nhow incorrect you are based on my\nbucketing\num and you may try to reverse bucket me\nbased on that statement you'll be wrong\nthere too\num\nso i think the next thing that i want to\ntalk about is like you know what we can\ndo about it\nso\ni want to share with you guys i think a\nmajor problem a major public health\nnightmare that is already happening\nand i don't think many people are aware\nof what it is\nand that is online drift so there is an\ninteresting thing happening\nto our minds and on the internet that i\ndon't think many people are aware of\nall of the major\ncontent platforms are responsible for\nthis oddly enough i don't blame them\nbecause i think that they set out\nwith what i think was the best of\nintentions and it's just\na consequence that no one it's an\nemergent property that no one expected\nwhen they put together the pieces\nand that's online drift so basically any\ncontent creation platform that you look\nat\nor content amalgamation platform will\nserve you things that you like\nand so what tends to happen is that\nthere have been scientific studies\nwritten about this\nwhere like you start off with some mild\npiece of content and then over time the\ncontent the platform will serve you\nmore and more extreme pieces of content\nso there's literally this this concept\ncalled online drift where you kind of\nstart in the middle and then you start\nlike moving towards extremes so i think\nlike good examples of this are you know\nthere are like many subreddits around\nloneliness right so there's like forever\nalone and then there's also like\nrelationship advice which is like more\nin the middle and then you get to\nforever alone and then you maybe get to\nlike\nfds or in cell communities or red pill\nor like whatever you get to these like\ncommunities that hold very strong\nbeliefs\num i'm not necessarily\nsuggesting that any of those beliefs are\nbad but this concept is happening where\nthe internet by virtue of the way that\nonline drift happens it's fracturing us\nas a society\nthe second thing about online drift\nthat's really important is it is that it\nis emotionally engaging content that\npeople select the most\nso what happens is like if you look at\ntwitter like why is twitter such a\npopular platform it's because 160\ncharacters is a great way to emotionally\nengage people if you look at the people\nwho are very popular on twitter they're\nnot necessarily right\nthey're the ones who emotionally engage\ntheir audience like time and time again\nand the people who agree with them think\nthat they're very very right and the\npeople who disagree with them think\nthey're so so idiotic but that person\nsucceeds because\nthey've actually emotionally engaged\nboth sides of the argument so in a weird\nway content creation is drifting towards\nemotionally engaging content instead of\nlike accurate content or helpful content\nright it's all about like what you're\ngonna click on and so what people tend\nto click on is that which is emotionally\nengaging and so you end up with this\nlike combined process of like emotional\nengagement plus like content being\npresented to you which is more and more\nemotionally charged\nless nuanced less logical less less like\nyou know dyadic right it becomes like\nvery monotheistic in nature\nand so over time what would happen\nwhat's happening is like we're sort of\nlike creating these echo chambers right\nand that's what the internet is doing\nthe internet is funneling us\ninto echo chambers\nand one of the things that we've seen is\nif you read like manifestos of school\nshooters and things like that you'll see\nlike a lot of echo chamber mentality in\nthose kinds of things\nand so i don't know exactly what to do\nabout this but i absolutely see this as\na problem\nso what i'm going to say now is that you\nhave to be really really careful about\nthe safe space that you gravitate to\nand this is another thing that started\nto happen which is that safe spaces have\nstarted to become breeding grounds of\ntoxicity\nso what happened is like people didn't\nwant contrary opinions right so like\nlet's say you've got like\nyou know a gender oriented sub so you\ncan look at two x chromosomes or like\nmen's rights or like whatever so i'm\ngoing to talk about subreddits because\nthat's what i'm familiar with but you're\ngoing to have a gender oriented\ncommunity which understandably the\ngender has had bad experiences with\npeople of the opposite genders so we're\ngonna create a safe space just for us\nand i think that has a lot of utility to\nit has a lot of value to it i'm not\nsaying it's a bad thing\nover time though what tends to happen is\nas we knock out contrary opinions as we\nknock out discussion because let's be\nfair a lot of the people who come in\npretending to discuss are not actually\ntrying to discuss they're trying to\nattack so i understand why it happens\nover time what tends to happen is we\ncreate this echo chamber that then like\npropagates like more and more extreme\nviews\nand then you end up with communities\nlike fds or red pill right which is kind\nof ironic because they're sort of the\nsame community it's just\nfascinating but\nand so this is something that's a\nserious problem that i think as a\nsociety we need to be super careful\nabout like we need to be aware that\ncontent creation platforms as they chase\nemotional engagement and dopaminergic\nclicks\nwhat they're going to be doing is\nradicalizing us in the process and this\nis where you can say like oh my god the\ncontent creation platforms are bad\nfacebook is evil google is evil twitch\nis evil\ni don't think that that's fair i mean\nyou can criticize them and they may be\nevil i'm not saying it's not my place to\nsay\nwhat i'm saying is that like my focus\ntends to be on individuals and so you\nare just as complicit as the content out\nlike content platform\nright because you're the one who's\nclicking it so i i don't think it's fair\nto just blame and that's another thing\nthat tends to happen in situations like\nthis\nis everyone loves to blame\nthe things that don't involve them\nso we saw this a lot during the pandemic\nwhere everyone was like doctors are the\nheroes nurses are the heroes\nlike oh my god these people are so great\nlike they're amazing human beings\nand then doctors and nurses started\nsaying hey you need to get vaccinated\nand then suddenly people were like screw\nyou guys it's the medical establishment\nand so it's very easy to applaud\nsomething that doesn't cost you anything\nand even easier\nto criticize some something and tell\nsomeone else across the street to change\nit's really easy to say like oh facebook\nis evil twitch is evil youtube is evil\nreddit is evil tiktok is evil\nyou know i'm trying to be like\negalitarian and toss the evilness all\nover the place\nbut the truth of the matter is that it's\neasy to say that because it you don't\nhave to change\nright oh it's their fault\ni don't have to do anything differently\nand this is exactly how we end up with\nschool shooters because for far too long\npeople have refused to take\nresponsibility\nso the nra doesn't take responsibility\nyou know youtube doesn't take\nresponsibility reddit doesn't take\nresponsibility the government doesn't\ntake responsibility legislators don't\ntake responsibility\nindividuals don't take responsibility\nparents don't take responsibility\nfriends don't take responsibility\nbullies don't take responsibility\noh yeah like it's always like someone\nelse needs to fix this problem because\nthey're the problem\nand it is because every human mind\nthinks that that way that we end up with\nthe situation that we have\nso people in our community ask\nhow do i do my dharma what is my dharma\nand they think it's some grand thing\nright they think it's like oh i like how\ndo i save the world how do i like\nyou know like become a person who\nimpacts other people how do i like live\nmy life with purpose\nso this is what i'd say why don't you\nstart by being a decent human being on a\nvery small scale\nwhy don't you start by not bullying\nsomeone else\nwhy don't you start by like not dog\npiling the kid who's like been\nyou know\nbullied right why don't you start by\nbeing like decent in chat to people who\ncome on\nwhy don't you start by being decent to\nthe parent that we had recently\nbe decent to the women that come on\nbe decent to the people that you\ndisagree with\nlike start by being a decent human being\nthat's your dharma that's the beginning\nof it and that's the end of it\nstart by accepting responsibility for\nwhat you can change instead of blaming\nthe world for not fixing things\nwe see this with our generation too and\ni'm complicit with it\nwhere i say oh the boomers screwed us\nand it's like i i've been able to vote\nfor 21 years\nand so\nfor like the first like eight years of\nmy life like i didn't vote\nthe boomers didn't screw us\ni screwed us\nyou screwed us\nif any of y'all are not participating in\nthe process if any of y'all are sitting\nat home and like not doing anything\nabout this problem then you are\ncomplicit\nit's the only way it works man\nis if everyone starts taking\nresponsibility for whatever they can do\nright and and this is the kind of thing\nwhere like we even see like oil\ncompanies do this so i saw this\nhilarious thing i think that bp or some\nother oil company was like\nwhat are you gonna do like to to commit\nto changing like you know to fixing the\nclimate what is your climate change\npledge hashtag climate change pledge and\nsomeone well what else was like i pledge\nnot to dump five billion uh barrels of\noil into the ocean\nright that's my pledge\nand so everyone's talking about like\nrecycling and like using not\nnon-reusable straws which is fine like\ni'm glad people are doing that\nso that is like people who are like you\nknow not buying plastic straws or like a\nstep in the right direction but\nindividual car like corporations need to\naccept responsibility as well\nso this is where like as a human if you\nare gravitating towards communities\nparticipating in communities that are\ntoxic if you are not exposing yourself\nto contrary views with a genuine eye for\ndiscussion\nthen you are part of the problem\nand reddit is part of the problem google\nis probably part of the problem twitch\nis part of the problem everyone's a part\nof the problem that's the whole thing\nlike it's a worldwide problem so it's\nlike everyone has a uh some some role to\nplay\neven if it is not this is the other\nthing so\neven if you are not part of the problem\nyou can absolutely be part of the\nsolution and that is part of your dharma\nso the only way this works is if like we\nall do what we can do even if it isn't\nour fault\nand so if you want to know what doing\nyour dharma is it's like be a decent\nhuman being which is harder than it\nsounds i make it sound simple but it's\nvery hard it's be careful what you\nconsume on the internet\ntry to be compassionate towards people\nthat you dislike\nand who may disagree with you and we'll\nget to that later\nand that's your dharma\nthe next thing that i want to talk about\nis like the science of trauma and sort\nof\nalmost responding to the person who\nposted who i i don't want to show the\npost\num just for the preservation of privacy\nand whatnot\nso this is there's some things that you\nknow i don't know if people like educate\nlike i'm really curious like what that\nschool in michigan is gonna do for their\nstudents afterward\nright so i i haven't seen and maybe this\nis just me but like i haven't seen any\nclear messaging\non the science of trauma or how you\nshould respond after a school shooting\nlike what should you do\nso once again this is not like very well\nresearch i mean it's sort of well\nresearched in the sense that i look i've\nlearned a lot about it so like i've got\na lot of research like in my brain but\nit's not exhaustively studied or cited\nor up-to-date\nso here's what y'all need to understand\nabout trauma\nso the first thing is that psychologists\ndiscovered that processing trauma is\nuseful okay so this is like discovery\nnumber one\nso then what people decided\npsychologists were like oh there's like\ngenocide going on in africa let's go and\ntherapise them\nso a bunch of like mental health\nprofessionals showed up and they like\nprocess trauma with people immediately\nafter genocide so you'll have these like\nsurvivor camps right so refugee camps\nasylum seekers things like that and\nwe're going to make the world a better\nplace we're going to go in and process\nthat trauma for them we're going to fix\nthem that's what we're going to do\nand so what they actually discovered is\nthat forcing people to process their\ntrauma makes things worse\nso what tends to happen after a\ntraumatic event is that we feel numb\nwe dissociate right we feel detached\nfrom all sorts of things you don't\nreally like you just kind of feel numb\nfood doesn't taste great food doesn't\ntaste bad\nthings don't seem to be fun you're kind\nof like in this fog in your head\nyou're sort of like numb is the best way\nto describe it it's sort of like the\nvolume on life is turned down the\nbrightness on life is turned down you\nkind of unplug you don't feel connected\nwith yourself you don't feel connected\nwith your life there's a dissociative\nprocess that goes on\nthis dissociative process\nis protects you from the negative\nemotions right because you just went\nthrough something that was traumatic\nso there's like a very like clear\nphysiologic process that goes on when we\nfeel strong emotions\nour hormones go through the roof our\nbrain starts to activate in all these\nweird ways we enter periods of strong\nstrong neuroplasticity which means that\nour brain rewires\nso if you look at the limbic circuit of\nthe brain the limbic circuit is the\nemotional circuit it is right next to\nthe hippocampus which is the learning\ncircuit our emotions and our learning\ncircuitry\nis very closely tied together which is\nwhy the greatest teacher for human\nbeings is negative emotion\nthis is why you can be married to\nsomeone for 40 years\nsee them cheating once\nand divorce them\nbecause 40 years of good behavior can be\nwiped away with one bad lesson\nright like that's just how learning\nworks you can use a stove every day\nfor 40 years and like one day something\nhappens a spark lights your house burns\ndown\nand you're like i ain't never touching a\nstove again your brain will have like\nptsd from having stoves in the house\nthat is absolutely the way that we are\nare wired so forcing re-experiencing of\ntrauma essentially reactivates\nall of those negative emotions\nreactivates the hormonal surges the\nphysiologic changes that come with the\nfirst round of trauma that wreck your\nbody by the way\nbecause remember that when you're\nundergoing a traumatic experience it's a\nsurvival situation so your body\nactivates all of these circuits to\nsurvive the next 10 minutes no matter\nwhat happens tomorrow so in that moment\nwhat your body and brain do is they go\nall in on survival and they will wreck\nthe house as a result\nthe way that i kind of think about it is\nlet's say you're about to leave for the\nairport and you can't find your passport\nand your uber is three minutes away you\ndon't care about organizing things\nyou're dumping things off the shelves\nyou're like looking in here you're\nemptying out drawers it's a frenzy of a\nmess to find your passport within the\nnext three minutes\nand in those three minutes of shooting\nfor looking for that one goal you will\nwreck your entire house as a result this\nis what happens physiologically when you\ngo through trauma\nyour cortisol level\nshoots through the roof your insulin\ngoes through the roof your\ndecreases actually\nyour your blood sugar shoots through the\nroof\nall of these systems in your body go\nhaywire for the sake of temporary\nsurvival and we'll clean up the mess\ntomorrow\nso when you force people\nto re-experience trauma before they are\nready\nand this is important as well for\ncertain techniques of meditation that's\nwhy i do not do open awareness\ntechniques and meditation with traumatic\nindividuals their mind is working really\nreally hard to pack away those those\nmemories\nthey've worked really really hard to\nlike bury them in the basement and put\nlocks and chains and and weights on top\nso the trapdoor can never open\nand so when you get clinicians that\nforce people to process their trauma or\nyou get meditation techniques that let\nthe trauma come up then\nyou actually re-traumatize the person\ntrigger all of those physiologic\ndisruptions which result in neuroscience\nchanges those neuroscience changes will\nin turn affect your behaviors your\npatterns of thought etc\nso don't do that\ndon't force people to talk about things\nso then the question is what should you\ndo\nplay video games so this is one of the\nreally fascinating things there was a\nstudy that was done where they had\ntrauma survivors play tetris i think\nand what they found is that tetris is\nactually like really really beneficial\nfor trauma survivors\nokay so i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut like this is where like what do\nvideo games do\nthey cause us to dissociate right that's\nlike that's the problem is they cause us\nto forget life and push away all of our\ncares and worries and problems and as\nlong as i'm playing dota or league of\nlegends or valorent or whatever like i'm\nnot worrying about any of my stuff so\nlike no big deal\nso this is one of the situations in\nwhich video games can truly be\ntherapeutic\nbecause they assist in the dissociative\nprocess right and this is where people\nask are video games healthy or not\nhealthy no such thing\nevery tool has a place\nis a hammer a good tool or a bad tool\nit's a hammer if you drop it on your\nfoot it's bad\nif you use it improperly you're gonna\nbreak a finger\nbut used in the right way it can be very\nhelpful\nvideo games are exactly the same\nso oddly enough\ni would encourage people to like\nfollow you what your mind tells you to\ndo if you want to veg out and play a\nvideo game you just want to play\nterraria for like eight hours after a\ntraumatic event i'd say go for it\nlet your mind do what it needs to it's\ngoing to be subconsciously processing\nstuff and that's actually okay so what\nshould you do after a traumatic event\nplay a video game there's actually data\nto support that"
