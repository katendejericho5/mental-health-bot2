    "transcript": "so if your goal is to be a top performer\nthat means that\nwhat you do\nis determined\nby the crappiness of the other\nperformers\nall right so\nwhy am i unable to be content with\nanything\nas the title suggests i recently come to\nthe realization that i have a habit of\nruining good things in my life because i\nbecome discontent with them\nfor years i've worked\nin commission sales\nenvironments and have actually left the\nsame job multiple times for no real\nreason\ni have a job where i can easily be a top\nperformer and make over 100k a year with\nminimal effort however i always fall\ninto the same mindset of beginning to\nhate the job for no real reason\nand i do things in the job that get me\nin trouble on purpose debate them into\nfiring me what is wrong with me i do not\nwork excessive hours at the job and it\nis beyond easy for my skill set and i'm\nstill unhappy with it\nthis has been this has happened at\nmultiple other jobs i've had as well i\nwill become very good at whatever job it\nmay be lose interest and then\nself-sabotage my way out of it\nthis sort of behavior follows outside of\nwork too hobbies for example result in\nthe same way whether it is guitar a\nspecific video game video editing every\ninterest i've ever had results in me\nbecoming good at something quickly then\nsabotaging my way out of it\ni once got into power lifting\nobsessively it was all i ate slept and\nbreathed for multiple years i became the\nstrongest guy in the gym without even\nbeing the biggest then one day just\nsnapped and i stopped going and carrying\nall together ruining my health in the\nprocess\neven in video games i follow the same\ntrend i'm league of legends in in league\nof legends for example\ni will one trick a single champion until\ni get to diamond and then i will\ncompletely lose interest and start\nhinting games down to gold or platt\nbecause i lost the passion to get better\ni am now 26 years old and i feel as\nthough i've come to a point where i have\nnothing to show for myself in life\nbecause i cannot keep a passion for\nanything\ni'm in addition i have no desire to work\nplay video games or exist anymore i'm\nnot suicidal and do not have suicidal\nthoughts but i also do not particularly\nenjoy life apologies if this is\nlong-winded but tldr i've never been\nable to be content with anything and i\nhave pretty much nothing for me to look\nforward to in life anymore which makes\nme feel like i'm just treading water for\nthe sake of drinking water\nso\nthis is a case\nthat is very important is a very\nimportant post and here's the reason why\nthis post is very important so what i\nwant to talk to you all about today\nis\nwhat i would call\nthe\ni don't know if this is the right word\nbut almost like the in-between people\nokay\nso this is a case of someone who\nis able to grind really hard right so\nlike\nand get\nbecome successful in something and then\nends up like abandoning it or sabotaging\nit so the first thing to understand is\nthat in our community we tend to have\ntwo groups of people or we tend to talk\nabout two groups of people one is the\ni'm going nowhere in life this is your\nyou know your neat person your\nhikikomori nene person like i'm 24 i\nplay video games all day like uh like\nhow do i get a job how do i find love\nlike how do i socialize like so we have\nthis perception in our community that\nlike there's a lot of people who are\nlike this\nat the opposite end of the spectrum we\nhave like someone else in our community\nwho's sort of the high performer right\nso this is someone that we saw in our\nhigh performance group high potential\ngroup these are like engineers like\nsoftware programmers like other\nsuccessful people like sometimes\ninvestment bankers and other randos in\nour community professional poker players\nlike crypto\nsavants like all kinds of other people\nin our community who are like successful\nbut the truth is that\nhalfway between those two things is what\ni'd call like the halfway successful\nperson\nand this person is is like not able to\ni'd say like build a dynasty so they're\nnot able to let me kind of put it this\nway okay so it one side we have the neat\nright not in\nno\nemployment\neducation\ntraining\nand then over here we have the what i\nwould call the dynasty builder\nand what do i mean by dynasty so this is\na case of someone who has a success has\na success has a success and they build\non top of it\nso over time like they're able to like\nbuild a life right like i have a\nsuccessful career check i have a\nsuccessful relationship check i'm gonna\nyou know i i do i enjoy i have like good\nfamily relationships check now i need to\nfigure out entertainment yes and then up\nhere is like dharma i need meaning\nso these are our successful people over\nhere\nthe truth is that the majority of our\ncommunity is actually somewhere around\nhere and these are what i'd call the\nhalf performers\nso they're not like incapable of getting\njobs they're not incapable of forming\nrelationships but they're not able to\nbuild on their successes and why is that\nright what's going on with these people\nso let's kind of go back to this\nand\ntake a look so what do you guys think\nmotivates this per person\nright so what do you all see so it's not\nself sabotage\nso self self-sabotage\nthey're motivated towards self-sabotage\nbut what motivates this person what do\nyou guys think\nokay this is really interesting right so\nnow people are saying\nprogress they're saying improvement\nthey're saying the grind\nthey're saying validation very good\nright so let let's take a look at this\npost\nwhat do we see here top performer\nright\num\nlet's look at this\ni've become very good\nokay\nuh and then let's like\nevery interest i've had becomes becoming\ngood at something quickly\nquickly skill up\nso now what we're going to do is i'm\ngoing to move this thing over here so\ni've been taking some notes\nso we can see that what motivates this\nperson is a sense of progress\nimprovement grind validation wanting to\nbe at the top diamond so the other thing\nthat i want you guys to notice is that\nmany of this person's like their\nlanguage all involves comparison\nso they use words like diamond\nthey use words like top they'll use\nwords like become the best become better\nso fundamentally there's a lot of\ncomparison going on this will be like\nthis will become important in a second\nbut if we kind of think about it so this\nperson's saying like i don't understand\nlike i'm not motivated i sabotage things\nincorrect\nyou have to understand that you're not\nnot motivated you're motivated by a\nparticular thing and what is this person\nmotivated by progress and improvement\nso\nthis is kind of interesting because\npeople will say like people will assume\nfor example like the neets for example\nwill be like i can't get motivated to do\nanything so i i i wish i was progress\noriented i wish i was growth oriented i\nwish i could grind\nright people\nvalue or envy these qualities they wish\nthey could wanted to become very skilled\nlike think about how awesome this is\nlike for the neat they're like oh my god\nthis person can quickly skill up we had\na question earlier about someone being\nstuck at 1k mmr and here's this person\nwho's like\nable to get to the top and then they\nself sabotage and whatever so it's kind\nof interesting because actually what\nthis person is motivated by is what the\nneets crave\nokay\nso then the question is like what's\ngoing on here why do they abandon things\nif they're motivated towards growth\nso let's\ni'm gonna draw you guys a curve\nokay\nso if this axis is effort\nand this axis\nis progress\nwhat does this curve look like can you\nall tell\nwhat do you guys think\nbeginning is the easiest very good\nexponential\nyes\nand there's an asymptote here\nright\nso this is the problem so what do you\nguys think this person does so you may\nlook at this person you may say like oh\nthey're interested in games\nthey learn instruments\nthey find jobs\nand they look at all these different\nthings and they're like i can do\nanything for like one year bodybuilding\nso what's going on here what's going on\nis they're on\nthis curve right so like let's this is\nthe bodybuilding so they start here\ni get to the strongest person in the gym\nand then\nthere's a gap right so they hit the\nexponential phase of the curve\nand so now what happens is the more\neffort they put in the less gain they\nget\nbecause this is what's rewarding\neveryone wants progress right so now\nwhat they end up doing is they're like\noh at this point their brain is making a\ncalculation\nthat at this point now i'm in the red\nzone which means that i have to put in a\nbunch of effort to get a very little\nyield\nso then what their brain does is oh\nlet's like switch let's start playing\nwall\noh here we go oh that's some good [ __ ]\noh ooh look at all like look at because\ni'm kind of a chad and i can like focus\nand i can be motivated and look at how\nmuch\neffort i have to expend i have to expend\nvery little effort to make a lot of\nprogress and as soon as they get good at\nsomething\nthey decide to abandon it so this is the\nproblem of like a lack of a of a\ndynasty builder\nright because at some point what their\nbrain just tells them is hey instead of\ninvesting like because notice they just\nget to diamond right they're not getting\nthe challenger\nright they say they're the top performer\nthey're making 100k a year they're not\nmaking a million\nso they're never actually becoming the\nbest at something\nthey're just getting like decently good\nthey work until they hit somewhere along\nthis point in the curve\nand then their mind is like oh it'll be\neasier if we just switch gears to\nsomething else because then we can get\nthat sweet sweet progressium\naddicted to the grind absolutely and so\nthey get stuck in this place\nright you guys see that and so this is\nwhy this person hops and so if you want\nto understand the self-sabotage it's\nlike self-sabotage is an easy way to\nquit you guys get that because if they\nquit what ends up happening is they'll\nfeel bad they'll be like oh i'm a\nquitter but hey chat\nthis is progressium i'm not a quitter so\nwhat i'm gonna do is gonna get fired and\nthen i have a reason i have an excuse to\nokay like i just got fired from my job\nlet me be positive let me be growth\noriented okay i'm gonna start\nbodybuilding and you see i'm not like\nthose other losers that just like sits\naround and like\nlike oh my god no i'm gonna like do\nsomething with my life\nand so then they they pick the next\nthing and then then what happens is like\nthey get kind of they don't get bored\nwith it what happens is they get to this\nphase of the the curve\nwhere effort does not\nyield a lot of gain\nand so they switch to something else\nso now the question is okay what do we\ndo about this and this is the key thing\nit's about comparison okay so if you\nwant to understand how to break out of\nthis the first thing you've got to do is\nfirst of all have an awareness of this\ncurve and start to ask yourself\nquestions like\nyou know why am i self-sabotaging is\nthis the point at which i feel like\neffort\ndoes not equal\nreward right\nis this the phase that i'm getting at is\nthis what determines what triggers the\nself-sabotage\nbecause what i'm noticing in this person\nis that like you guys get that what's\nmotivating this person is not a love for\nany of these things\nthey're not actually getting motivated\nby like wanting to play league they're\nnot getting motivated about wanting to\nbe healthy they're not getting motivated\nfor the love of the thing at all\nall they're getting motivated for is\nthis\nlet's see\nbecoming good at something\nokay i became the strongest guy\nso it's about comparison it's about\nrising above people and then i stopped\ncaring and going at all\nyou know i'll single trick champion i\nget to diamond it's so it's all about\nachievement comparison and like ranking\nagainst other people\nso this is a problem of ego okay so\nthere are a couple of things you can do\nhere so the first\nis you know ask yourself what motivates\nyou\nso really as you are doing any one of\nthese activities\nstart to ask yourself\nyou know like what is it that in what do\ni enjoy about this why is this no longer\nfun for me\nand\nit's not just looking here because what\nthe person is looking at is they're\nfocusing on this phase right\nthis is another problem in terms of how\nto learn\nwhat we always look at in humans is the\narea that we make mistakes\nbecause this is broken\nbut if we really want to understand\nourselves we have to look at this part\ntoo so you know when are things going\ngood\nright so you need to examine that like\nwhat motivates me right now like why do\ni want to be the best power lifter in\nthe gym\nlike what appeals to me about this it's\nnot just about the quitting\nit's about\nthe positive motivation as well so you\ncan ask questions like what feels good\nabout it\nokay\nand so you can start to do internal\nexploration you can do this with a coach\nwith a therapist as well\nall right so i'd say the atman if this\nis a problem that y'all struggle with\ncheck out the atman pada so the atman\npada is the path of self in\ndr k's guide to meditation\nalso for people for the last one if you\nfeel like you've fallen behind there's\nuh there's a video there's some stuff in\nthe depression guide about like this\nconcept of falling behind and how to get\npast that\nso you can do these kinds of things and\nthen the other thing that i'm going to\nteach you is\na meditation so the other thing is that\ncomparison is about ego right so the\nother thing is that this person wants to\nbe better than other people\nso as long as like you being better than\nother people is your primary driver\nwhat you do is going to be fundamentally\ncontrolled by other people do you all\nunderstand this\nso we're going to switch gears for a\nsecond and kind of like talk about ego\nfor a second\nso if your goal is to be a top performer\nthat means that\nwhat you do\nis determined\nby the crappiness of the other\nperformers\nit has nothing to do with like\nobjective skill in a thing it's just\nwanting to be the best\nso if i if i'm motivated by being the\nbest and i'm in a math class with six\nyear olds i'm not going to learn much\nmath right\nif i want to be\nthe strongest in a class and i'm in a\nclass with six-year-olds it's not gonna\nmotivate me at all to like work\nright like i'm not gonna work out i\ndon't need to work out i'm fighting\nagainst six-year-olds i'm racing against\nsix-year-olds i'm playing basketball\nagainst six-year-olds like so this\nconcept of like ego and wanting to be\nthe best fundamentally causes you to\nlose control over your life\nit's a huge problem\nbecause then your perception\nof like you being the best is ultimately\nwhat motivates you that means it's not\ninternal motivation it's external\nmotivation\nokay so then the question is like how do\nwe get rid of this ego so the ego is\nalso comparative things like that\nthere's stuff in the in the meditation\nguide about a hum god in vedic\npsychology you guys should definitely\nwatch that if this is interesting to you\nso what do you do about this so this is\nwhere i'm going to teach you guys about\nshunya\nso shunya is\nnull void or zero and this is kind of\nweird so shunya was discovered in in\nindia so people will historians will\nsort of credit india with the discovery\nof zero\nbut the interesting thing is that zero\nwas not discovered\nby like mathematicians in india it was\ndiscovered by yogis\nso what happened is like yogis like\nwill meditate for a while and they\ndiscovered like the concept\nof nullness void or zero like the\nabsence of things and what they the way\nthat they essentially discovered the\nconcept of absence of things is through\nexplorations of their identity what\nyogis essentially did is they like sat\ndown and they tried to figure out who am\ni so they noticed okay there's this\nthing called the ego which likes to\ncompare so like some of my identity is\nbased on comparison to other people i'm\ntall i'm short\nso when people identify with qualities\nlike tall and short do you guys get that\nlike\nyou can't be tall or short unless other\npeople existed\nthe whole word tall or the whole word\nshort\nhas within its concept a comparison to\nsomething else you guys get that\nso in that way\nall of the qualities that we\nuse to describe ourselves are\nfundamentally comparative so even\nconcepts like gender so male or female\nlike male doesn't mean anything if there\nis not a female female doesn't mean\nanything if there isn't a male finger\ndoesn't mean anything unless there's a\ntoe toe doesn't mean anything unless\nthere's a finger\nso all of these concepts are comparative\nby nature\nso what the yogis essentially discovered\nthrough meditation is that there is a\nsense of nullness or void and that this\nis like a primary quality of existence\nand this is where like the meditation\nstuff gets kind of weird so people want\nto understand like\nwhat is om\npeople will say like people will say\nit's it's the fundamental sound of the\nuniverse\nor the fundamental vibration of the\nuniverse like what on earth does that\nmean and this is where things get like\nkind of really off the rails is when you\ndo shunya meditation you will see shunya\nin things it's kind of hard to describe\nbut like i would say you know there are\nthese big level concepts which are like\nso let me give just give you guys an\nexample so one is like energy so energy\nis like a high level concept like you\ncan see energy in different places you\nthere's like gravitational potential\nenergy there is electrical energy there\nis like magnetic energy like energy is\nlike a big thing right it's like a high\nlevel concept and so in that way shunya\nis another like high level concept\nenergy and null are like two very\ndifferent things they're not like in the\nsame ballpark at all so what the yogi's\nessentially figured out is that there's\nlike a set of like basic qualities in\nthe universe so one is like the energy\nprinciple one is this concept of null or\nshunya\none is um what's another example of like\noh another one is duality so duality is\nlike another example of like a broad\nlevel thing that can't be compared to\nenergy but it's just the fact that like\ntwo things exist\nand that duality is essentially false so\ntall and short is another good example\nright so like you as human beings we can\ngroup the world into like division like\nwe can divide things so we can say that\nsomething is tall something is short\nsomething is red something's green this\nperson has black hair this person is old\nyoung so our mind divides the world into\nduality so duality is like sort of a\nfundamental quality not really of the\nworld but that's a little bit\ncomplicated but do you guys get how like\nshunya\num\nenergy and duality are like three\ndifferent buckets that don't really\nrelate to each other\nso what the yogis essentially did is\ndiscovered these like fundamental\ndifferent buckets and there's a limited\nnumber of them so what are all the\nbuckets these all of these buckets\nbecame the mantras that they said so\nthere's like one mantra for energy\nthere's one mantra for duality there's\none mantra for shunya these are like\nfundamental qualities of existence and\nthen under the common element that binds\nall of these things together is om and\nhow do you understand that it's like you\ndo the shunya meditation you do the\nenergy meditation you do the duality\nmeditation and then you actually\ndiscover oh there's like\nexistence\nthreads between all three of these\nthings\nright so like there is some amount of\nexistence in all three of these things\nso even if it's duality even it's shunya\neven if it's like\nenergy there's like something exists\nand so that's when people said oh that\nquality of existence is something that\nwe're going to call ohm\nso that's when people say like om is the\nfundamental like vibration of existence\nwhat that literally means is like it's\nthe quality of that which exists\nso if someone's saying\ni'm so confused i apologize i told he\nwould go off the rails so these are\nthings that if you really want to\nunderstand it's not like a logical\nunderstanding it's a like subjective\nexperience that you'll understand so i'm\ngoing to teach you guys a shunya\nmeditation so if you really want to\nunderstand this stuff you have to do\nthis meditation and then you will start\nto\nexperience the void for lack of a better\nterm okay\nand then like once you like experience\nit like then you'll get it\nright it's it's kind of yeah\nokay\nso we're gonna do shunya meditation all\nright\nso i want you guys to sit up straight\nthis is not in the guide\nso there's some stuff but shunya is not\nin the guide i don't think anyway maybe\na little bit\nokay you can take headphones off it's\nfine\nall right so what i want y'all to do is\nsit up straight\nokay\nclose your eyes\nand the first thing that i want you to\ndo is just notice\nwhatever your senses are picking up\noutside of you\nso even if you want to you can open your\neyes briefly\nbut i want you to notice that for\nexample you're able to hear sounds right\nso like listen to the sound of my voice\nor even with your eyes closed like reach\nout in front of you and like maybe touch\nthe desk\nyou know touch something\nand just notice that like this object\nexists without outside of you right so\njust feel it and kind of notice that\nthis thing is out here\nbut\ni am the one that is experiencing\nwhatever the sensory input is so i'm the\none who's doing the touching and the\nobject is the thing that gets touched\nright i am the listener and there are\nsounds outside so there's the outside\nworld which is sending sensory input\ninto you\nso take a moment to touch an object\naround you\nlisten to the sound of my voice\nmaybe notice the smell\nand that fundamentally there are things\noutside you and your sensory organs are\nthe entry point of things outside you to\nwithin you\ni know it sounds kind of basic but like\nrecognize that that which you touch is\nnot part of you right you just\nyou just have contact with it\nthe words that you hear are not part of\nyou they you simply have contact with\nthem\nand now what we're going to do is focus\non\nthe sensory apparatus\nso notice that you have ears that are\ncapable of hearing\nright so we're not going to focus on the\nsound itself or my words\nbut just the fact that you're able to\nhear\nso where do you do the hearing\nwhat is your experience of hearing\nif you're using the sense of touch\nas you touch notice that the sensations\nthat you feel are not the table\nyou don't actually feel the table what\nyou feel is you touching the table\nthat there are tactile sensors within\nyour fingers\nthat will fear feel pressure\nand warmth or cold or temperature\nand that's not actually the object it is\nyour perception of the object\nand so what i want you to do is push\nlightly against an object near you\nand feel the sensation across your\nfingers\nrob an object around you and once again\nfeel the sensation across your fingers\nand now what i want you to do\nis go even one layer deeper\nand notice that even without touching\nsomething so relax your hands maybe fold\nthem in your lap\nadopt a mudra if you prefer\nand notice that your fingers and hands\ngenerate signals\nwithout any external contact\nso now we've left the external world\ncompletely behind\nand notice that your hands have a\nproprioceptive sense\nwhich means you can tell where they are\nin space\nyou can feel where your hands are\nwhether they're above your head in your\nlap\nyou know where your body is\nand even without any kind of external\ncontact\nyour body generates signals\nthat tell you\nwhere you are\nyou can know where your hands are you\ncan know where your fingers are because\nthey're sending you signals they're\nletting you know hey i'm here hey i'm\nhere hey i'm here\nand now i want you to travel up\nyour arms\nso start with your hands\nthen focus on your forearms and notice\nthat your forearms\nexist and then move up to your elbows\nand now notice all the signals that your\nbody is sending you\nand then up to your arms\nand you may even feel uncomfortable like\nmoving if you want to you can go ahead\nand move\nand now up to your shoulders\nand now into the chest\nor upper abdomen\nthis is where the practice becomes\ndifficult\nso if you are a veteran meditator this\nmay be accessible to you\nif not you can just practice for this\nnext part\nand so notice that the sensations in\nyour body\nthat there's a black box\nkind of in the middle of your body\nthat you may feel hunger\nor fullness in your stomach\nand you may experience like some\nsensation in the upper chest\naround your lungs\nbut actually in the core of your being\nnotice that there's like a complete\nabsence of sensation\nthat there is something that sends you\nno signals whatsoever it's just\nthe only way you can notice it's there\nis because if you follow the sensations\nof the body\nthey stop at some point\nand in the core of your being there is a\nhollowness\nand now focus on that point\nfocus on that sensation\nnow ask yourself what is that\nnotice that your body and your mind\nsignal to you that they exist\neither through the presence of thoughts\nor physical sensations\nbut how is it that you can feel nothing\nat the core of your being\nand meditate upon that thing\npractice for another minute or so\nand now externalize your attention again\nstart to come out of that place\nreturn to your body\ngo up the chest to the shoulders arms\nelbows forearms fingers\nlisten to the sound of my voice\nand notice that the world begins to\nexist again\ngo ahead and come on back\nall right so i'm going to ask y'all a\ncouple of questions if you really want\nto understand shunya\nso\nfirst question is who was able to feel\nshunya\nokay so it's okay for not everyone to\nfeel it so now let me ask y'all a\nquestion for those of you that were able\nto feel shunya\nthe roshunya within\nright\nso tell me what is outside of you\nwhere else can shunya be\nright so if you understand what shunya\nfeels like\nyou will notice that\nit is everywhere\nso like\nnow you're starting to get it\nbecause what the yogis essentially\ndiscovered so when they say that reality\nis false\nand they call reality maya or illusion\nthat is fundamentally that can be\ndiscovered if you want to understand why\nreality is an illusion or this concept\nof maya\ndo this shunya practice\nbecause then you'll begin to see oh [ __ ]\nnone of this crap is real\nright because it's shunya it's void it's\nnull\nand then what happens\nonce you have that realization\neverything that bothers you in the world\nceases to bother you\nit's transformative\nand then suddenly like these things that\nused to restrict you like oh like\ni want to be the best like the best is\nnot a real thing\nit's\nsilly\nright\nand so this is how you become free of a\nhum god\nright it's like it's freeing so this is\nwhy people call samadhi\nor moksha freedom\nenlightenment it's understanding and\nwith with the understanding comes the\nfreedom and the bliss\nso this is the other weird thing is that\nwe think about in logic\nhappiness\nknowledge\nand freedom are like three dimensions\nright those are not the same thing\nlike freedom and happiness are not part\nof the same scale\nlike they're like three qualitatively\ndifferent things\nbut moksha is the place where all three\nof these things meet\nand if you want to understand that you\ndo this junior practice for those of you\ni understand it's hard it's like an\nadvanced practice\nbut if you like understood that shunya\nis on the outside you'll begin\nbegin to see like oh crap if it's scary\nthen you're doing it right\nbecause what that means is like true\nfreedom and like happiness are like\nthere\nyou just have to pick them up\nbut you're not ready to and so then the\nquestion becomes why aren't you ready to\npick it up what is it that holds you\nback if you are scared of embracing\nshunya\nwhat is it that is frightened\nvery good right so some people get it\nthe ego\nright so what wants to control the ego\nwants to control shunya doesn't need to\ncontrol\nthe ego so for those of you that are\nable to follow along\nnow you understand how the shunya\npractice will dissolve your ego\nbecause in order to embrace it you have\nto let go of that which holds on\nand then you get to detachment\nyou guys get that like that's like\npeople ask how do you detach this is how\nyou detach\nbut unless you understood the meditation\nyou're not going to understand i could\ntell you guys time and time again here's\nhow you detach here's how you detach you\nwon't understand it like you're not\ngoing to get it for those of you that\nget it now you understand what that the\nnature of attachment is if you want to\nunderstand what attachment is it is that\nwhich is terrified of shunya\ndoes that make sense\nno we're gonna do maybe one more\nquestion\nis it possible to be too detached\nyes and no\nthe only thing that is concerned about\nbeing too detached is the ego\nso it's worried about being too detached\nbut so what\ntoo detached means that you're measuring\nit against something do you guys get\nthat\nlike what does it mean to be too\ndetached that means that there's an\nappropriate level of attachment who\ndetermines the appropriate level of\nattachment the ego does because it's\nlike i want to be this detached you guys\nget that because here's what's happening\nin the ego the ego's like i want to be\ndetached enough to where i can be\nsuccessful in life and get the things\nthat i want to but i don't suffer\nso there's a beautiful there's a perfect\nlevel of detachment that's how spiritual\ni want to be i want to be spiritual so i\ncan have all of my desires satisfied and\nbe like materialistic i want to use\nspiritual growth\nas a means to a materialistic end that's\nwhat the ego does\nright i want to meditate so i can get\npromoted at work\ni want to meditate so i experience less\nanxiety i want to meditate so i don't\nhave social anxiety so i can meet\nsomeone and get laid\nit's all hijacking spirituality for its\nown materialistic ends this is why the\nworld is filled with false spirituality\nnow\nand the more that people have recognized\nthe value of meditation the worst this\nproblem has become\nthe ego isn't cancer\nit's just that which shackles us\nright and so like here's the big thing\nare you okay being shackled\nso\nso how do we hold the shoe okay so\nthere's different questions here all\nright\nso one is like some of these are\nquestions from people who i think like\nhave understood it and some is like from\npeople who haven't quite understood\nwhich is okay i'm not trying to say that\none is better than the other it just may\nnot be the meditation technique for you\nright it's like not everyone is a mage\nit's like here's a mage staff and if\npeople are into be like being a mage\nthey're like oh this is great for\nfighters they're like trying to melee\npeople with their mage staff and they're\nlike\ni don't understand this which is totally\nfine no judgment right\nso one is how do we hold the shunya\nthat's a good question you practice\nholding the shunya is absolutely the\ngoal so this person has understood it\nbut why is spiritual growth even worth\nit you haven't even addressed that yet\nyeah\nworth it means what worth it to whom\nworth it for what end\nworth implies like worth it for what\nand so the answer is spiritual growth is\nnot worth it\nbecause spiritual growth is not\ninterested in the it the the whole goal\nof spiritual growth is to abandon the it\nright to exist without a goal\nso that that's like i haven't addressed\nthat because i can't it's not worth it\nby definition it is what spirituality is\nis letting go of things being worth it\nokay so now this person is asking\ndoesn't the ego stop us from getting\ninto situations that will kill us\nabsolutely\nso now we're going to take a page from\nscience okay\nso ego is a universal experience of all\nhuman beings\nright\nso why is that it's because the ego has\nbeen selected for by evolution\nego is what helps us survive\nso it's absolutely evolutionary like so\nif we think about you know becoming\nsuccessful in life you want your ego\nlike the truly enlightened baby will\nnever become\nwell they'll still become successful\nthat's another paradox we'll get to in\nanother another day but\nit is the chase for success that the ego\nwants right and so like there's a reason\nwhy it evolved it evolved because it\nhelps us survive\nit has survival utility\nbut it doesn't have happiness utility\nso ego helps us survive but doesn't make\nus happy because we've evolved to not be\nhappy we've evolved to survive and this\nis the core this is the core problem\nwith being a human being in the world\ntoday is that this body in this brain\nand this mind are not designed for\nhappiness they're designed for survival\nand everyone is looking for happiness\nusing an instrument that was designed\nfor something else that's why it's hard\nthat's why spirituality is something\nthat you have to work towards\nright because it's not like\nit's like you know we're we're living\nout of the back of our car it's not what\nit was designed for the car was designed\nfor movement and here we are trying to\nuse it for something else\nso this is the fundamental problem of\nbeing human is that everything within\nyou is designed for survival it's not\ndesigned for contentment or happiness\nso now you have to decide like and\neveryone's gonna have to make their own\njourney in their own decision like what\ndo you want to chase do you want to\nchase the ego or do you want to go ahead\nand let it go\ndo you want to embrace shunya or do you\nwant to be successful\nand it's a decision that every person\nhas to make\nso this is the problem that buddha had\nas he chased so this is buddha's\nconclusion is that you can chase success\nas much as you want to but it's never\ngoing to get you anywhere because he\nrose to the top\nright he was like a king and powerful\nand respected and lucky and wealthy\nand he was like i'm still unhappy and so\nhe decided to choose happiness not\neveryone has to choose happiness some\npeople choose power\ntotally fine it's your choice you decide\nwhat is the purpose of the ego the ego\nego is a huge survival benefit\nright it's like very very helpful that\nway\nwhy not both\nuh yeah you can do you could try to do\nboth\ncan you choose both sure there's not the\nthe real answer is that it's not really\na choice it's like even that is like\nit's hard to describe but like\nit's shunya right it's all nothing so\nthere's no both there's neither\nright so these are all constructions all\nof these questions are coming from the\nconstruction of an egotistical mind\nright so like i'm totally fine like so\nhere's the problem we're going to get\nback to regular stuff so i told you all\nwe're going to go off the rails today\nso\nthis is the thing so like this is a\nchallenge we have it at healthy gamer\nand hg is like do we go down this road\nfor the people who have been here for a\nwhile right or do we do the same old\ncrap so we gotta like throw a bone to\nthe people who have been here for a\nwhile and meditate on a regular basis\nand stuff like that even if we lose\nsomebody all along the way which i\napologize like it you know\ni can't if i'm teaching to 3 000 people\ni can't have one thing that's effective\nfor everyone\nright so this is some some cult level\nstuff so what i would love to do is like\nthese are the kinds of things that\nideally are not taught on stream but\nlike if we ever do like a retreat\nright some real cult stuff like we'll\nhave like ideally we'd have a retreat\nfor people who are long-term community\nmembers and meditate on a regular basis\nso we can do advanced topics\nso the key point here is that the you\nknow if you've done the shunya\nmeditation you understood it then\ncontinue doing it and then you will find\nthe answers to all these questions\nand then if you didn't get it you're\nlike\nwhat the hell is going on that's totally\nfine please accept my apologies and\nwe'll get on to other things it's not\nlike some people so be careful about the\nego now so some of you may be thinking\noh i'm one of the ones who got it oh i'm\ngoing to go to dr k's special retreat\nand we inducted into the cult wonderful\nthat's ego too\nright there's no better or worse it's\njust different levels let's say just\nlike different people\nright it's\nalready failed absolutely that's why i'm\npointing it out you guys get that it's\nlike you see how sneaky the ego is now\nthat we're active and you're not\nmeditating the ego will find its way in\nsome of y'all are going to be feeling\nbad and some of y'all are going to be\nfeeling chad\nright\nbut it's all ego\nit's just what you are\nyou moved away from shunya if you're\nfeeling chad and you moved away from\nshunya if you're feeling bad\nhave i managed to balance the ego at\nspirituality\noh\nthat's such a good question\nlet me think about how i would describe\nmy experience\nhere is the way that i experience ego\nso i have a garden and i try to grow\nthings in it and periodically like some\nanimals and stuff like rabbits and stuff\nwill come and eat all of my effort\nthat rabbit is my ego\noccasionally i'll try to get things done\nand then the ego shows up and like\ntorpedoes everything that i'm trying to\ndo but then like much like the rabbit\nit you know it's just trying to live too\nso\ni can sigh and i can be like well that\nsucks but at least the at least the\nrabbit got to\neats these awesome\ncarrots and sweet potatoes\nright\nit's okay i have an ego\nit gets the better of me many times\nwhich it's gonna do\nbecause i've decided that i'm not gonna\nyou know be a monk\nso it's like that's the price that i pay\nso it's okay it belongs it it deserves\nto be there\nall right\ni see this chat amanzour\ni see you the orc eye of sauron\nso how do you know if it's the voice of\nego or it's the voice the good voice in\nyour head\nwith practice\nyou begin to see what the rabbit looks\nlike and then you can understand oh did\ni do this or is this the rabbit\nso remember that the the\nso the the real goal is not to get rid\nof your ego it's to be in control of\nyour ego\nso your your ego should be like listen\nto you instead of the other way around\nyou"
