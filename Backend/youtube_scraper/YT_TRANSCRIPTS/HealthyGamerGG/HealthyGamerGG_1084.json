    "transcript": "all right so here's the problem with\nweed you know so as a psychiatrist i\nrecognize that there are medical uses\nfor marijuana\num\ni think the most convincing\nmedical reason i've seen for using\nmarijuana is to help people with opioid\naddiction that's kind of\ncounterintuitive\nbut it does seem to work well\nbecause there are a lot of physiologic\nproblems that happen with happen with\nheavy opiate use that sort of get better\nand i think on balance it's a good thing\nto do you know has to be prescribed and\nstuff like that\nthe basic issue with marijuana you have\nto understand how marijuana works in the\nbrain so the first thing is that\nmarijuana works on these things called\nanandamide receptors so the anandamide\nreceptor\nwas coined by an indian guy i assume i\nthink he was indian because he named it\nafter the sanskrit word for bliss\nso he was like what there are these\nbliss receptors in our brain and that's\nwhat like marijuana acts on\nso a lot of people think that marijuana\nacts like makes people stupider right so\npeople say like oh i've been smoking pot\nmy entire life like my accused fine so\nmarijuana doesn't work like that what\nmarijuana does i think is far more\ninsidious\nso if you look at the cannabinoid system\nin the brain it involves habit formation\nand motivation\nso like once a how can i say this early\non in the brain\nwhen you are reinforcing a behavior it\nis the dopamine system that reinforces a\nbehavior\nonce you have a habit formed the primary\nneurotransmitter is no longer dopamine\nit's\ncannabinoids\nso for example like the first time i\nbrush my teeth i may really enjoy it or\nlet's talk about video game addiction\nfor example\nso the first time i play video game it's\na lot of fun i have it's dopaminergic i\nenjoy it then i want to play again and i\nwant to play again and each time i get\nless dopamine less dopamine less\ndopamine and if you guys have been\naddicted to video games you understand\nat some point you cross this critical\nthreshold\nwhere you keep playing the game\nbut you stop having fun\nand it's like what the hell is going on\nat that point why are you even doing it\nif you're no it's no longer even\nrewarding\nso the interesting thing is if you\nunderstand neuroscience there's like\nactually a good reason for that and\nthat's that like the shift of the\nbehavior\nmoves from a reward circuit to a\nhabituated circuit\nso habits in the brain are governed by a\ndifferent circuit than like the dopamine\nsystem so the nucleus accumbens\nmesolimbic system those are both\ndopaminergic systems that involve\npleasure followed by behavioral\nreinforcement\nat some point you move into the\nautopilot circuits which are different\ncircuits of the brain and once you enter\nan autopilot it's not like there's any\nreward right so if you think about\nbrushing your teeth there's like no\nreward there anymore right even if you\nthink about dogs for example when you're\ntraining a dog at the very beginning in\norder to get them to fetch you have to\ngive them a reward because there's no\ninherent dopaminergic reward for\nfetching a ball or a stick so you throw\nthe ball when the dog brings it you give\nthem a treat boom they get a hit of\ndopamine you do it again boom they get a\nhit of dopamine boom they get get a hit\nof dopamine you do that 10 times 20\ntimes 30 times their brain becomes\nhabituated to it it enters kind of the\ncannabinoid system and you no longer\nneed to provide a dopamine dopaminergic\nreward to engage in the behavior you all\nget that\ngaming is the same once you move over to\nthe cannabinoid system then it becomes a\nhabit then it becomes hard to break\ndespite the fact that it's not even fun\nso why is marijuana a problem\ni don't know exactly how but marijuana\nscrews up that circuit\nmarijuana makes it hard my observation\nclinical observation okay so now like we\nknow that basic neuroscience but we\ndon't know that that neuroscience\nactually translates to human behavior\ni haven't seen those studies yet i don't\nthink our stuff is sophisticated enough\nbut clinically what i've seen is when\npeople use pot they fall into this this\nweird habitual non-enjoyment way easier\nthey like fall into bad habits and it's\nreally really hard to get them out of\nthose habits\nand what i've discovered is that if i\ncan get them sober from marijuana their\nability to change their habits becomes\nway easier\nokay so someone's saying\nokay so sorry for me throwing out a lot\nof words\nand you're confused\ndo you all get that or not\nso here's a quick summary\nour brain has two circuits\none is a reward circuit\nthat we release dopamine which allows us\nto feel pleasure and reinforces a\nbehavior so for example i'm drinking\nthis iced coffee right now and it tastes\ngood\n[Music]\nso when i drink it i get a hit of\ndopamine and it's like oh i want more\nover time if you look at people who\ndevelop addictive behaviors\nthey still engage in the behavior but\nthey don't actually feel any pleasure\nfrom it\nthe reason for that is because we have a\nseparate circuit of the brain that\nstarts to take over which is the habit\ncircuit\nso once something becomes a habit it no\nlonger gives us a reward\nbut it's still we're still driven to do\nit even though we don't enjoy it anymore\nso when we get addicted to a video game\nand we just start like playing video\ngames and like we don't even enjoy them\nanymore that's a problem of our habit\ncircuit getting messed up and the habit\ncircuit's primary neurotransmitter is an\nendocannabinoid\nor a cannabinoid it's an endo means\nit's basically internal thc right it's a\ncannabis compound like neurotransmitter\nthat is built within us so when people\nuse marijuana the biggest problem that i\nsee is it becomes hard for them to break\nhabits i'm not quite sure how it works\nbut i suspect that it has something to\ndo with the fact that the cannabinoid\nreceptors in the brain the marijuana\nreceptors in the brain have something to\ndo with habit formation and habit\nexecution\nand when people smoke pot it's just hard\nfor them to make changes in their life\nis that better\nyeah so people are asking um do you have\nany advice for medical cannabis users\nthat's where like i think you should\ntalk to your doctor because the risks\nand benefits\nare like individualized right so like\nwhen i think about using medical\ncannabis i look at an individual person\ni think about okay what are the risks\nwhat are the benefits what do we gain\nwhat do we lose and for each individual\nperson or situation it's going to be\nslightly different\ni quit we three weeks ago and i still\nget cold sweats and very vivid dreams is\nthat normal i'm not sure\nto be honest\nso that too is something that you should\ntalk to your doctor about because\ncold sweats and vivid dreams\nhow can i say this\nso you guys understand that like a\nsubstance causes particular changes\nbut the substance acts within an in\nwithin an individual body\nwhich means that like\nyou know so the reason how does that\nmake sense like there's an individual so\nif you talk about the effects of\nmarijuana\nthere is no such thing technically as\nthe effects of marijuana because the\nmarijuana has to act within a human\nbeing so the effects of marijuana are\ngoing to be filtered through an\nindividual human being\nso when we talk about the effects of\nmarijuana basically what we're doing is\naveraging the effects within a thousand\nindividuals and sort of saying this is\nthe effect of the drug which is\nscientifically valid but in terms of any\nindividual case there's going to be a\nslightly different presentation because\nyour receptors your metabolism your\nbrain is going to be different which\nmeans i can take one compound\nand put it in a thousand people and\nit'll act slightly differently that's\nwhy if you look at like you know\nprotocols for medication\nit's not like there's one antidepressant\nthat works equally for all people\nwe have 30 antidepressants that each\nhave different efficacy within different\npeople\nand so that's what's tricky about\nmedicine it's also what makes it fun\nbecause it's not like there's a\none-size-fits-all solution\nso in terms of your particular\nrelationship to a substance there's\ngoing to be a lot of individuation there\nyou"
