    "transcript": "i feel like i'm manipulating a girl that\ni'm dating and dr k is the one to\nbelieve that's\nthat's so hi everyone i23m started\ndating this awesome girl 20f recently\nand we connected really really well\nwe talked for hours about our emotions\nin a way that i never thought i could\nhave with anyone and even more when\nsober lol she is very emotionally\nintelligent and an excellent\ncommunicator because of that it's very\neasy to understand her feelings\nstruggles and experiences meaning that i\ndon't need to make any effort to\nunderstand and feel empathy towards her\nwhen i'm sharing my struggles feelings\nand experiences it's just wonderful i\ncan see that she really cares about me\nthat she is paying attention to every\nword i say and expression that i make\nand she asks really good questions etc i\ndon't feel judged in any way so it's\nit's safe to say that i can trust her\nwhen i'm sharing my flaws and\ninsecurities so i'm waiting or is anyone\nelse like waiting for the next shoe to\ndrop or\nwhat's happening here my problem is in\nthose conversations i'm often self-aware\nthat basically everything that i know\nand talk about i learned from healthy\ngamer gg\nor other internet sources\nif i'm not self-aware while this\nconversation is still happening surely\nsoon will\nsurely soon will be af\nwill be after the conversation is over\ni'm self-aware that basically everything\nthat i know okay\nalthough we talk in a totally different\nlanguage it's like every word that comes\nout of my mouth is not mine the\nconfusing part is i'm confident enough\nto say that i truly understand what i'm\ntalking about a portion of it is because\nsome of it also comes from my own\nexperiences at the same time i feel like\nthe knowledge to understand those things\nis not mine in the first place\ni'm starting to feel like i'm tricking\nher into believing that i know about\nmental health more than i actually do\nmeaning that she likes me for something\nthat is not me or mine\nfor example interesting\ninteresting\nso for example when she was sharing that\nshe's anxious all the time and how was\ngrowing up in her household i said\nsomething like since you were a child\nyou had to anticipate the worst outcomes\nto every action you take to protect\nyourself you didn't have any other\noption besides developing anxiety to\nsurvive that's\nwhy now it is so hard for you to not be\nanxious all the time it's something that\nhelped you when you needed help the most\ni can't point exactly where i heard\nsomething extremely similar like that\nbut i'm sure it was from doctor a doctor\nk streamer video my question is am i\ntricking her into\nin any way into believing i'm something\nthat i'm not or do i have the right to\nshare my perception about mental health\neven though i'm not the one who came up\nwith all of it\nthanks to everyone who took time for to\nread my post it means a lot\num\ni point out whenever i can to her that\ni'm not an authority on the subject let\nalone capable of providing professional\nsupport okay\nthis is interesting\nall right so\nthe so here's a here's someone who\nhas spent a lot of time learning things\nin his discovering\nto his great surprise that the things\nthat he somehow learns because he didn't\ndiscover himself\nare not really he's not entitled to\nshare it\nright so he kind of feels like\neverything he's learned he's learned\nfrom somewhere else it's not really his\ndiscovery you don't really own the\ninformation\num and so you kind of feel like you're\nkind of cheating on the test right\nyou're giving someone the right answers\nbut you cheated on the test\nand so\nyou know my question is am i tricking\nher into believing something\nbelieving i'm something that i'm not or\ndo i have the right to share my\nperception about mental health\neven though i'm not the one who came up\nwith all of it\nokay so that's a good question it's\ninteresting the first thing that i want\nto do\nis point out that like\neven the post has a lot of\nself-awareness\nso in a sense like this is the thing\nchat so here's someone who's a 23 year\nold dude who's like vibing with a 20\nyear old chick right so that's cool\nand\nand then like they're very like\ncommunicative and emotionally supportive\nand they're getting along which is like\nwhy we're on the internet\nthat's an example of why we do this\nright so good job i'm really proud of\nyou and it makes me feel good about the\nwork that we do because the whole point\nof this\nis that like you can learn these things\napply them in your own life and like\nactually connect with other human beings\nand that you can actually be like a\nhelpful and useful source of goodness\nand positivity\nnow what you need to do\nis induct her fully into the cult\ngood job\nright\nno but seriously um\nthat's why we're here so and at the same\ntime i kind of\nright so now now bring her in as well\nand then just start tithing 10 of your\nincome no you don't need to tithe any of\nyour income we're good thank you very\nmuch for everyone who does donate we\nappreciate it\num but you don't you don't need to\ndonate right it's not donating to us\ndoes not send your soul to heaven\nso here's here's uh\nso let's like think about this so we can\ngo two directions with this chat\none is like sort of a standard direction\nand the second that we can kind of go on\nmaybe because i'm on this bend is to\nunderstand who owns knowledge and where\ndoes knowledge come from this is like\nmore of a meditative thing okay so the\nfirst thing that i'd say is like when\nthis person says like\nyou know\ndo i have the right to share my\nperception about mental health\nbro that's like a struggle that i had\nfor like 10 years right so when i was\nlike training and i don't know if you\nguys get this but\nyou know most of what i teach on the\ninternet is not like my discovery you\nall get that\nlike it's repackaged but like i spent\nseven years studying to become a monk in\nlike\n10 years doing neuroscience research and\nlike studying to become a psychiatrist\nso like what i am passing along to you\nit's repost well said\nhealthy gamer is one massive repost\nfor\nall of the books on the bookshelf\ni can't right so we have all these books\nback there and like what i did\nis read all those books\nand then learn all those things\nand then\nshare them with you all so this is not\nmy knowledge knowledge is not owned by\nan individual person\nand so i think it sort of makes sense\nthat you've got to be a little bit\ncareful because i think you are getting\na little bit diagnostic there\nin terms of this is why you're like\nformulating another human being which\nyou got to be careful about you really\nhave to understand what you're talking\nabout in order to do that but it sounds\nlike you do understand so the first\nthing to understand is knowledge is not\nreally owned by a particular person now\nwe do have you know patents and things\nlike that which i think makes sense\nbecause i think a lot of work can go\ninto the packaging of knowledge\nbut generally speaking it's not like the\nideas of like karma or dharma or\nmotivation are owned by a particular\nperson\nso everyone has a right to the knowledge\nlike that's why we sort of teach it we\ndo our best to teach it freely sometimes\nwe charge for particular services and\nstuff like that but that's because they\ncost like a hell of a lot of money to\nmake\nright and sometimes we're also like you\nknow we charge for coaching because we\nwant to pay\nso coaches\nare some things that but generally\nspeaking like knowledge is not something\nthat's owned by a particular person\nthe other thing that's kind of\ninteresting so now we're gonna i'm gonna\nask you all a question so if you really\nwant to understand this so this is where\nlike i could respond to the post and i\ncould say no you're doing great\neverything's fantastic go for it\nbut i want y'all to understand that if\nyou really want to overcome this\nsentiment you have to understand where\nknowledge comes from\nso let me ask you guys\nwhere does knowledge come from\nah okay so so there's there's there's\nlike\nyou know\nsome twit chatter who's saying the butt\nwhich\nthat's a whole other\ncult right so some people are saying\nlike i can't tell what's a real answer\nand what isn't so some people are saying\nexperience and some people are saying\nfrom like books\nso let's try to understand\nyou know like let's think about that for\na second let's say i sit down\nand i have a book here right so i have a\nbook called meditation from the tantras\nokay\nso when i read when i open this book and\ni read it\nall right\nlike\nwhat is the process of\nlike where does this knowledge come from\nright so like i know it sounds kind of\nweird but like when i read the words on\nthe page do i gain knowledge\nyes and no so like this is where man i\nwish we were like i could talk to a\nhuman because this is slow\nso when people say repetition so\nsomeone's saying repetition so let's\nthink about that for a second\nif i read a book three times do i gain\nthe knowledge in it\nand some people are saying maybe\nso the yogis in ancient india came to an\ninteresting conclusion\nand their conclusion is that all\nknowledge comes from within\nthat there may be triggers\nfor your internal understanding\nbut that essentially no knowledge can\ncome from the outside\nthat essentially you can make\nobservations but the act or the essence\nof knowledge does not come from watching\nbecause like before isaac newton i know\nthis is apocryphal but before isaac\nnewton saw an apple fall and was like oh\nmy god there's gravity like human beings\nhad seen apples fall a lot right like\nthat information was already in the\nworld it had been there for a long time\neven information about physics and like\nscience and there's all kinds of\ninformation that has existed within the\nworld for a long period of time even\nwithin one book\ni can read it and get nothing from it or\ni can read it and get a lot from it and\nso essentially repetition is like\nrolling making a knowledge check dc 15.\nand so on the first check sometimes i\ncan do really good otherwise i fail if\nlike i'm trying to study and there's a\nlot of noise right it's like then it's\nlike i get a minus five penalty to my dc\n15 check\nand if i'm super in the zone and i\nmeditated this morning then for example\nlike you know i get a plus five and it's\nlike dc 15 but at the end of the day i\ncan read this book ten times and learn\nnothing or read it once and learn a lot\nof things and so if the knowledge were\ntruly in the page\nthen\ni should read it once and i should get\nit right\nthe other thing is if knowledge were\ntruly external no one would be able to\nwrite a book\nbecause if you think about just the\nprocess of writing a book like the\nperson who wrote this\nit didn't exist before it had to come\nwith it from within\nso the yogis actually concluded\nthat all knowledge comes from within\nand so they also like got a little bit\nthey went a little crazier and they sort\nof realized that there's this thing\ncalled cosmic consciousness\nand as we connect with cosmic cosmic\nconsciousness we gain more realizations\nand so there's a lot of information out\nthere in the outside world but the\nprocess of understanding happens\ninternally and there's like basically\nthis gigantic\nsuper computer that has all of the\nunderstanding of the universe and it is\nour ability to connect with that super\ncomputer and download that understanding\nfrom the super computer that results in\nunderstanding\nand so that's that's kind of like a\nbizarre way of thinking about it right\nlike it's not really how we think about\nit\nbut this is where let's understand where\nhow they came up with this conclusion so\nthey came up with this conclusion\nthrough observation of themselves and so\nthis is sort of like another guyana yoga\npractice that we're going to share with\nyou so i want y'all to think about\nwhere understanding comes from right so\nsit down and look at a book read a book\nthat you haven't read before and try to\nfigure out like where is the actual\nunderstanding coming from is it coming\nfrom the book or is it coming from me\nwhat is the function of the book\nand the best i can kind of say is that\nif for me what it feels like is a\ntrigger it feels like books\nare\nkeys to locks within myself there's like\na box of understanding within me and if\ni find the right key i can open it up\nbut like that the understanding is\nwithin me\nand someone is sort of saying it\nstimulates your thoughts like that's\nbeen my experience that the thoughts\nactually happen up here\nand all i need is the right kind of\nstimulation to bring out the right kind\nof understanding right and so this is\neven the word someone else in chat is\nsaying eureka so like even the idea the\noriginal word genius is not a person\nit's like a temporary effect that hits\nyou right genius is a state of mind it's\nnot a human being that's changed as our\nlanguage has changed but even like the\nancient greeks sort of conceived of it\nthat way that eureka understanding the\nlight bulb going off in your head it's\nnot like the like even in our you know\niconography it's not like the light bulb\nis shown up here the light bulb is above\nmy head\nso understanding happens entirely\ninternally\nand so this is it's kind of a drastic\nway of thinking about it but then if you\nsort of think about it then like no\nperson\nlike the ownership of the knowledge is\nwithin that cosmic consciousness is not\nowned by any particular person anyone\ncan access it and this is also why if\nyou sort of think about it like multiple\nhuman beings can make the same discovery\nright how is that even possible it's\nkind of bizarre\nbecause it implies that even the word\ndiscovery implies that the knowledge\nalready exists it's just about our our\nability to access it and this is where\nwe sort of think in the west that that\ndiscovery happens externally but it\ndoesn't happen externally it happens\ninternally\nand you can even look at things like\nnobel prize winning experiments in\nmedicine and you can sort of see that\nyou can there's\nvery interesting interviews like if you\ntalk if you read interviews from nobel\nlaureates in physiology and medicine\nabout what kind of discovery they made\nit's like really interesting because\nmost of it is internal\nso what happened is like the data's\nalways been there\nit's the interpretation of the data\nwhich is revolutionary and in fact what\nthey do is they so this is going to get\nkind of tangential but i think it's like\nreally proves a point\nso the world conceives of physiology in\na particular way this is how physiology\nworks\nso the external world's representation\nof physiology is a particular way\nthe way you become a noble laureate in\nphysiology is that you look at the\nexternal world and you have a revelation\nin here which you communicate to the\nrest of the world and then the rest of\nthe world's sense of physiology changes\ndo you guys get that scientific\ndiscovery does not happen externally in\nfact it is an internal revelation that\nchanges the external landscape of\nscience\nthat's what a scientific discovery truly\nis\nwhich is kind of bizarre because it's\nthe very opposite of what we think about\nright we think about science as an\nexternal discovery\ndoes that make sense\nokay hold on does that work\nno blurry\ni feel like i'm\nthere we go\nso it's a very bizarre way of thinking\nabout it so if you guys really want to\nunderstand this like\nyou should just\nexplore it yourself see for yourself\nbecause if you kind of think about it\nyou know how can someone conceive of a\nbook\nlike how does that happen\nright like\nit just comes from somewhere but you\ndon't know where it comes from like you\ncan come up with an idea so this is like\nwe sort of take it for granted that we\nhave creativity within us like wait a\nsecond hold on\nhow does that work where does creativity\ncome from\nit's bizarre\nyeah so\nand so this is where like you know\nphilosophically i encourage you all to\nthink a little bit about you know what\nhappens in science like you have an\nexperiment and then the external world\nshows you something\nand the process of science is revealing\nright it's a process of revelation and\ndiscovery not creation\nso everything is already there\nso even if you look at like old sanskrit\ntexts\nthey actually describe physics with this\nword mahat which means cosmic\nintelligence\nso they actually like talk about the law\nyou know the laws of the universe and\nphysics they refer to it as a cosmic\nintelligence\nand understanding of those things is\nlike\nyou know\nit's kind of weird so like it's just\nstrange\nit's a different perception that once\nyou start to meditate and once you\nreally look at yourself so like the next\ntime you're studying i strongly\nencourage you to think about where does\nthe understanding come from does it\ntruly come from the book\nand what's the best way to understand so\nhere's a studying tip\nso like\nif the knowledge truly comes from the\nbook\nwhich we know scientifically we'll get\nto this in a second but\nyou know then the best thing to do is to\nread the book over and over and over\nagain but what we know from like the\nscience of studying is that the most\neffective way to study is not repeating\nthe intake of information the most\neffective way of studying is to practice\nbringing stuff out\nright that's why like\ndoing\nyou know if i have a choice between\nreading a book a book chapter five times\nor reading a book chapter twice\nand doing three practice tests the\nstudent who does reads the book chapter\ntwice and does three practice tests will\nscore higher than the person who reads\nthe book chapter five times\nit is the act of recall that correlates\nwith better performance on on tests and\nif we think about what is recall like\nthat also is kind of a bizarre\nprocess if you really stop and look at\nit\nlike you're just like floating around\nlike like i'm talking to twitch and then\nsuddenly like someone asked me a\nquestion and out of the ether of my mind\nan answer shoots forward\nright it's like really bizarre so by the\nway i mean we just talked about it now\nbut if you guys are more interested in\nthis stuff there's there's the path of\nknowledge or the nyanapada in dr k's\nguide to meditation so then\nexplains like some of these concepts and\nhow to study and like how to learn and\nlike different types of knowledge and\nstuff like that\nso check that out\nif you are interested uh uh okay\nanother quick thing to remember for\nthose of you that feel like your recall\nis messed up\nso here's what i've discovered as a\npsychiatrist if you feel like your\nrecall sucks and your memory sucks\n75 of the time your memory is fine it is\nyour attention that's the problem so\nremember that in order to recall\nsomething\nit has to be implanted first and most\nyoung people who have trouble recalling\nthings don't actually have any trouble\nwith recall\nthey actually have trouble with\nimplantation\nso if you don't attend to a particular\nstimulus\nit will never get planted in your brain\nwhich means that you will forget\nbecause what we call forgetting is\nattempting to recall something but if\nnothing is there or we knew it once and\nwe forgot it we both interpret both of\nthose things as is forget so if you\nthink about losing your keys for example\nthe problem with losing your keys is\nthat you never knew where they were in\nthe first place right you were not\npaying attention when you set them down\nsomewhere how do you lose things around\nthe house it's not that you knew where\nit was and then you forgot it's that you\nnever attended to it in the first place\nso if you all have trouble with recall\nwhat you need to do is practice and\ntrain your attention\ndoes that make sense\nso training attention by the way is like\none of the most underdeveloped skills in\nsociety like training your attention is\nlike op chat\nhow do you train your attention with\nadhd the simplest way is actually to\nmeditate so any kind of meditation will\nstrengthen your attention for the most\npart\nthis is why i like so i think breath\nmeditations are good the rotating sound\nawareness meditation is good\num so remember that with adhd what you\nwant is a meditation that has a variable\nstimulus\nso what i mean by that is like\nsomething that your mind can\nstay in the same zone but move around\nwithin that zone so you can rotate from\none sound to another you can look at\nlots of different leaves on a tree so\nlike for example what you can do is like\ngo outside your\nstep outside or look outside your window\nand try to see as many objects as you\ncan as rapidly as you can so that's a\nrotating sight meditation there's like\nyou know grass there ant mound there\ntree there leaves over here acorns here\ndog poop there dog over there person\nover there car over there and rotate\nthrough them just sit calmly with your\nback straight look out onto the world\nand just see as many things as you can\nand so even though your mind has a\ntendency to want to move so you want to\nlet it move if you've got adhd\nbut you're still\nencompassing it within the space of\nwe're just going to look at random\nthings\nand i'm telling y'all to do it outside\nfor a reason\nokay so you've got to be careful because\nyou don't want to interpret what you see\nso when you look at six consoles in your\nroom for example you're gonna start\nthinking about games and then you'll no\nlonger be doing the practice\nit's far more\nit's far easier to slip up with\ninterpretation in your room\nthan it is to slip up with\ninterpretation outside\nhow often do you have to do it until\nimprovement so most of the studies on\nmeditation require about 30 min 20\nminutes of practice at least three days\na week for eight weeks that's when you\nwill see a statistically significant\nchange\nin some kind of symptom like attention\nso that's about eight weeks is about how\nlong it takes to start to see like\nneuronal change\nand now that also is like a broad scale\nconclusion okay it's like i've read like\nprobably 300 studies on meditation and\nif you average them all together they\nusually do they're like eight week\nstudies and people see like change\nis the effect size reasonable absolutely\nso you know for meditation for example\nlike i'll expect a 20 improvement in\nsome on average in symptoms from\nmeditation that's what i would expect as\na clinician\nyou"
