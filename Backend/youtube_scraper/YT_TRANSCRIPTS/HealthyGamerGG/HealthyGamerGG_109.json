    "transcript": "ignore the energetic layer of people so\nwhen we look at someone right so if you\nlook at a lot of your negative\nrelationships your mind is almost\nrationalizing why you should stay in the\nrelationship you just don't like someone\nvery much but your mind is like oh they\nwe've been friends for so long this is a\nreally classic one right so if you look\nat people who are used to be best\nfriends the real sad thing about people\nwho used to be best friends is the\nnumber of years it took them to realize\nthey are no longer best friends so you\nyou all stopped being best friends five\nor six years ago but you really only\nstarted stopped acting like best friends\ntwo or three years ago this other person\nstarted to drift away you all grew into\ndifferent people you became toxic they\nbecame toxic but because you have this\nshared history you maintain the\nrelationship and I'm not saying that you\nhave to cut everyone out of your life\nbut if the energy of a particular\ninteraction doesn't feel right to you\nacknowledge that right if you want to\ntry fixing it you can fix it but I think\nthe biggest problem that we sort of make\nis that we don't acknowledge the\nenergetic layer of interactions"
