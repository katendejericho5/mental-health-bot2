    "transcript": "let's start with disclaimers so very\nimportant today so just a reminder that\neverything we discussed today on stream\nis intended to be for educational\npurposes only and nothing is intended to\nbe taken as medical advice if you all\nhave a medical concern please go see a\nlicensed professional and seek their\nindividual advice and this is doubly\nimportant today because what what I'm\ngoing to do today is give you guys\nessentially like my sex ed talk this is\na like it's something that I talk about\nwith patients a lot\nso I essentially have like a Spiel that\nwhen someone comes to my office and has\nconcerns or is curious about\nuh sexual education like these are the\nthings that I'll explain to them\num for those of y'all so like it'll be\nlike these tend to be patients that are\nlike teenagers or young adults who may\nnot have like ever had someone sit down\nand talk to them about sex and like\nwhat's normal what's not normal\num you know what's healthy what's\nunhealthy like things to watch out for\nthings to be careful about so it's not\ngoing to be I know we're doing this on\nTwitch and I know that\noftentimes people will meme about stuff\nthat are going to be a couple of jokes\nright because that's just how I teach\nbut like I just want to emphasize that\nreally the the goal of of today's\nlecture is to just educate people and I\nstrongly strongly encourage you all to\ngo actually see a licensed professional\nif anything that we discussed today\nseems to resonate with you\num and it's it's not going to be like\nyou know like this is how you have sex\nit's not like a how-to guide for sexual\nintercourse what it's really what we're\ngoing to be talking about today is is\nreally more Medical in nature it's like\nhelping people understand like what's\nnormal what's not normal what should\ny'all be watching watching out for\num it's kind of like this is what I'd\nsay you know so like sometimes parents\nwill ask their kids this question\nI'll give you guys an example of why I\ngive this talk okay\nso parents will ask kids their question\nyou know are you having sex and the kid\nwill like if they have a good\nrelationship the kid will say yes\nand then the parent will be like are you\nbeing safe\nand then the kid will be like yes\nand then that's the end of the\ndiscussion right it's like there's never\nlike the parent doesn't want to talk\nabout it the kid doesn't want to talk\nabout it it's super awkward and it's\nlike what is the parent what is the kid\ngoing to say in that situation no like\neven if they know they're not being safe\nthey're probably not going to say that\nto begin with and secondly like they may\nnot have the same idea of like what safe\nis\nright so we're going to talk about like\nwhat safe is like what are the\ncomponents of safe\num so another reason that we're going to\nbe talking about this today is because\nyou know as we've\nnot recently discovered but as we've\nknown for a while you know our content\npeople watch this stream from 65\ncountries or 70 countries\num and a lot of these places don't have\nuh you know very robust systems of\nsexual education so we're going to try\nto you know teach the basics of like\nsexual health today\num and so I you know by all means have a\ngood time because I think that like\neducation shouldn't necessarily be like\nno laughing aloud you know but at the\nsame time like let's remember that the\nreason we're here is not to look penis\nlike that's not what we're here for\nright we're here to actually or at least\nthat's not why I'm here what the reason\nI'm here is because it's been my\nobservation that like a lot of times\nthese\nthese conversations are actually really\nimportant and we don't have them enough\num you guys can clip that that's fine\nit's gonna be the first of many like\ndon't don't sweat it dude\nokay so like let's just try to be\nrespectful of the topic at hand do we\nwant to laugh like absolutely am I going\nto make jokes like hopefully right\nthat's just how I teach and like I think\nthat's important and at the same time\nlet's let's try to like make sure that\nthings first of all don't get too far\nand let's remember that the goal that\nwe're really here is to like try to\nlearn something so that we can live like\nhappier healthier lives okay\nso a couple of quick announcements we're\nlaunching parent coaching in one day so\nwe still have some spots available\num so we only have a uh you know a\nhundred spots in parent coaching total\nand so if you guys are interested you\ncan sign up there so let's launch into\nour lecture so today chat I want to talk\nto you all about\nuh sex ed basically so sexual health so\nthe way that we're going to talk about\nthis is it's going to be first of all\nlike this is going to be primarily like\na medical education lecture so it's like\nsomething that I talk to my patients\nabout\num it isn't actually like medical advice\nso you guys should go talk to your\ndoctor about things here that seem\nimportant to you\num so we're going to talk a little bit\nabout like sexual anxiety and what I\nmean by that is like a lot of people are\nworried about something related to sex\nand so I think one of the biggest uh\nantidotes to sexual anxiety is actually\neducation it's one of the few instances\nin Psychiatry where I think education\nactually deals like a lot of good so\nlike you can get a lot of benefit just\nby like educating people\nso in other areas of mental illness\ntelling depressed people or anxious\npeople to be less depressed or less\nanxious or just let me explain to you\nthat there are other fish in the sea you\nwon't be alone for the rest of your life\nhere are the statistics doesn't seem to\nmake a dent thankfully when it comes to\nissues of sexuality the amount of\nknowledge or understanding is so low in\ngeneral that education seems to help\npeople in immense amount so what I'd\nlike to do today is is to share with you\nguys some basic information about like\nnormal sexuality so like you know basics\nof like puberty and things like that\nbasics of like menstruation and and like\nuh hormonal Cycles so I think this is\nsomething that not just women but like\nmen should understand too like we should\nunderstand you know for those of us that\nare in relationships with women like you\nknow what's going on with them like we\ndon't have to like it's not like some\nforeign mystical thing right like as a\nman you can understand what's going on\nwith a menstrual like with a menstrual\ncycle like it's just biology it's\nphysiology\nand so I think like equipping people\nwith like that really basic information\nseems to help a lot so some of this is\ngoing to start a little bit with normal\nsexuality\nthen um we're going to move on a little\nbit to safe sex so like what are the\ndifferent dimensions of safe sex\num and then we're going to touch on some\nother like you know problems that people\nmay have and we'll review different\nkinds of like birth control\num you know different kinds of STIs and\nlike why we use certain things when we\nhave sex uh it's not going to be like a\nhow-to guide in terms of like sexual\nperformance or things like that we're\nnot going to go into a whole lot of\nStatistics or details about you know\nlike erogenous zones or what percentage\nof women are able to have like organism\nthrough vaginal intercourse and like all\nthis kind of stuff there's a lot more\nthat we could teach but this is going to\nbe the basics by the way did you guys\nknow that uh about 70 of women can have\nan orgasm through vaginal intercourse\npenetrative intercourse\num so there's a lot of stuff there that\nlike you know we haven't there's more\ndetail but like this is basically like\nwhen I get an 18 year old kid in my\noffice or 17 year old kid and like this\nis the sort of the the essence of what I\ntry to teach them about birth control\nsafe sex and things like that\nso basically when you know when parents\nask their kids are you having safe sex\nand the kid says yes and they don't talk\nabout like what that actually means\nwe're gonna try to address that\nso the first thing that I kind of\nmentioned is that you know this is um\nuh\nyou know the goal of this is to be\neducational because I found that\neducation actually does help a lot\nso\num I'm going to tell you all the stories\nso I one time had a kid uh and they've\ngiven me permission to share this story\nbecause they shall remain anonymous but\nI had a kid come into my office and um\nyou know we were talking they came in\nfor other reasons and so as you get to\nknow people you know they start to open\nup to you about other things and then\nthey had some anxiety about you know\ntheir their sex like stuff related to\nsex and in particular masturbation\nso they were like you know I'm afraid\nthat I'm not gonna like be effective at\nhaving sex\nand then I asked them well what are you\nafraid of and they're like well whenever\nI like masturbate I only reach the first\nstage of orgasm\nand then I was kind of confused and I\nwas like what exactly do you like what\nis the first stage of orgasm like help I\nwas confused by the phrase\nand so then you know they're like well I\ncan only get to like the first part and\nI'm like what what do you mean the first\npart and he's like well like so I was\nlike tell me what happens and then he's\nlike well I reached like the first stage\nand then you know like my erection goes\naway and like even if I try it starts to\nbecome painful and I can never get to\nthe stage stage two of orgasm and so I\nkind of talked to him and it seems like\nso first of all he's able to get an\nerection he's able to masturbate he's\nable to\num reach as he calls it the first stage\nof orgasm that after the first stage of\norgasm\num you know his his penis becomes\nflaccid and he like it becomes\nuncomfortable for him to continue to\nmasturbate\nso he was kind of thinking that he had\nmaybe screwed something up or he's been\nmasturbating this way for a while and\nlike he can't ever reach the second\nstage four guys and I was like well what\nwhat is that what is like the second\nstage of orgasm this is like\nprofessionally I'm like what the [ __ ]\nyou know like I you know I I wasn't\nactually laughing then but I was just\nreally like confused in retrospect we\nactually both laugh about it now\nbut so then he was kind of explaining to\nme that like you know when he watches\npornography and like people have an\norgasm there's like gallons of ejaculate\ngoing everywhere but when he reaches the\nfirst stage of orgasm he has like a\nsmall volume of ejaculate and he can't\never get to the you know like the fire\nhydrant stage of of that he sees in in\npornography\nand so like you know it took a little\nwhile for me to realize that like you\nknow his expectations of what's normal\nare shaped by pornography and that's not\nreally normal right and so I I tried to\nI mean I'm still not entirely sure to\nthis day I mean maybe he's a different\nkind of kid and there are stages of\norgasm but what I understood from that\nis that he's actually like achieving\norgasm it's just that's just a regular\norgasm and it doesn't last for like\neight minutes right because like that's\nthe the perception that they have for\nfrom pornography\num and also like you know they use a lot\nof like Viagra and other kinds of things\nwhen when they film pornography and\nstuff so you just had very very\num unrealistic expectations of what like\na regular sexual experience was like\nand you can't really blame the kid\num because I think a lot of us uh will\nhave unrealistic expectations because we\ndo learn from things like pornography\nit's not like we're you know most\nschools don't really have super robust\nsexual education classes\num some countries actually actively you\nknow try to not teach that stuff parents\nhave difficulty sort of having those\nconversations and so like where else is\nthe kid supposed to learn like is it\nkind of funny sure\nI mean I get it I thought it would I\nmean retrospect I think it's hilarious\nbut it's also like it's not really like\nthe kid's fault right it's a consequence\nof the society that we we grow up in in\nthe way that we're educated so today\nwhat I'd like to do is share with you\nall you know some basic stuff about like\nsex and sexuality\nso the first thing is let's just talk\nvery briefly about like normal sexual\ndevelopment\num so you know sometime between\ngenerally speaking like around 12 or 13\nyears old most human beings will enter\ninto a stage called puberty which is\nlike the stage of sexual maturation\nuh so we'll see like different kinds of\nprimary and secondary characteristics\nfor men we'll see things like\num you know you'll get you'll start to\nget erections uh you may have some\ngrowth of your scrotum you'll get the\ndevelopment of body hair\num in different places like your pubic\nregions arm armpits face things like\nthat you'll get a deepening of the voice\nthere's oftentimes a period where like\nyou know kids will uh boys will have\nlike a voice that cracks\num you'll see a lot of acne as well and\nthat's also that's primarily driven by\nlike hormonal changes during the puberty\ntime so a lot of people who have trouble\nwith acne sometimes the acne will\nresolve once they're done with the the\nhormonal changes in women you'll also\nsee primary and sexual uh secondary\nsexual characteristics develop so you'll\nalso see the development of things like\npubic hair and things like that breast\ndevelopment the most important thing\nthat uh you know most women experiences\nthe onset of Menses or menstruation so\nthey have an ovulatory cycle\nwhich we're going to talk about right\nnow because this will be important later\nso there's like a cycle of ovulation\nwhich results in menstruation and so\nmenstruation is when essentially the\nuterine lining\nsheds and then women will start to\nessentially bleed right so let's go so\nlet's kind of talk about this for a\nsecond\nso this is where we're going to get into\nthe science okay chat\nyou all doing okay so far by the way\nlike are we okay with this\nis this too much\nOkay we okay with that okay\nokay you're confused so that's hopefully\nwe'll fix that in a little bit the\naverage female menstrual cycle is 28\ndays\nthat is because it is lined with lunar\nrhythms no it's not aligned with moon\nrhythms it's because of biology\nso we start out with\num so let's actually start in the Middle\nwith ovulation\nso there's this thing called a follicle\nand a follicle kind of develops and then\nwe get like a big follicle which has an\negg inside and then at ovulation the egg\ncomes out\nafter that the follicle kind of gets\nsmaller again it degrades and then over\nhere we have menses\nat day 28 or actually over here is\nMenses at Day Zero okay and so this is\nlike where we have menstruation so\nbasically like once we have an egg that\nleaves the follicle this is the Zone\nwe've got basically one week where you\ncan get pregnant\nbecause now we've ovulated we've got an\negg we're ready for the sperm if the\nsperm meets the egg then we will get a\npregnancy right so we'll form like an\nembryo or a zygote and then that\nfollicle will go and implant in the\nuterine lining so this is like let's say\nthis is the uterus here's the uterine\nlining here and so this egg will go over\nhere and implant over here here are the\nfallopian tubes\nokay\novaries so that's kind of what what\nhappens so over here like if if by the\nend of one week if we don't have a\nuterine lining that has an egg implanted\ninto it essentially what happens is we\nget all of this uterine lining that\nsheds so this all goes away\nand then kind of comes out as blood so\nthis is the the process of menstruation\nand then you kind of\num prepare the whole cycle again\nnow the next thing to understand about\nthis whole cycle is that it's hormonally\ndriven and this is going to become\nimportant when we talk a little bit\nabout\num\ndifferent kinds of birth control okay\nso essentially what happens during this\nthis time is that we've got\num\nso we've got this hormone here called\nFSH which is going to slowly increase\nand then we've got another hormone\ncalled LH which is going to be like\nrelatively low\num\nand then surges over here which triggers\novulation and then it kind of stays low\nagain and so FSH is is follicle\nstimulating hormone so this is going to\ncause FSH is what causes these follicles\nto grow and so FSH over time is going to\nactually kind of go down like once we\nhave our follicle that's ready to go\nthen FSH decreases and then this LH\nsurge that that's in blue is what\ntriggers ovulation so essentially FSH is\ngoing to prepare\nus for ovulation the LH surge is what\ntriggers this egg egg leaving and then\nboth hormones tend to go down\nas we enter the luteal phase and\num we end up with Menses after that okay\nthis is going to become important in the\nsecond when we talk a little bit about\nbirth control okay so let me grab my\nnotes\nso\nthis is the process of menstruation any\nquestions\nwe'll talk about PCOS and stuff like\nthat okay\nso Menses is the process of shedding the\nuterine lining\nso like when when an egg does not\nimplant\nso when this process does not happen\nokay\nso if this egg gets fertilized by a\nsperm it'll go and it'll hang out it'll\nimplant into the wall of the uterus\nwhere it will start to grow into a child\nand if that process doesn't happen the\nbody sort of realizes okay it looks like\nwe don't have\na\nviable embryo that we can't carry to\ncreate a child so all of this uterine\nlining that we built up we're actually\ngoing to get rid of and then we'll start\nthe cycle all over again\nokay so that's what Menses is it's\nessentially shedding the uterine lining\ninteresting tidbit\nunfortunately mences is one of the only\nnecrotic processes in the body so when a\ncell dies normally it goes through this\nthis cycle called apoptosis\nwhich is programmed cell death\ninteresting aside okay\nso\ndid you all know that between your\nfingers you used to have webbing so our\nfingers used to be connected by skin but\nwhat happens when we when our body is\ndeveloping is like there's skin that\nconnects our fingers and then the body\nsort of realizes the skin in the middle\nrealizes hey we don't need to be here\nanymore so it actually goes through a\nprocess of program sell that and it dies\nso sometimes when cells get old\nsometimes if cells get cancerous they'll\nactually like auto destruct and the cool\nthing about apoptosis is that generally\nspeaking when it happens it's not\npainful it's like a normal thing it's\nlike basically we're shutting down the\ncell\nnecrosis is different necrosis is what\nhappens like when I get you know crushed\nI like you know a brick or when I get\ndamaged in some way that's like cell\ndeath that was not planned and so\nnecrosis releases a bunch of\ninflammatory things\nreleases substance p\nwhich causes pain\nwhich is why I like men sees is so\nfreaking painful and discom\nuncomfortable because it's one of the\nonly necrotic processes in the body it's\nessentially like getting down like let's\nget taking internal damage as opposed to\nlike winding things down which is what\napoptosis is so that's part of the\nreason why men sees is like tends to be\nlike quite uncomfortable and quite\npainful for women there are other things\nthat kind of complement complicate that\nbut I think it's one thing to kind of\nunderstand is like a dude like it helped\nme kind of recognize that\nyou know I don't think we sort of\nrealize is man we're not taught that\nlike there's actually like a part of\nyour partner's body that is like dying\nand it's painful and uncomfortable and\ninflammatory in causes like that's why\nyou get like you know belly pain\nabdominal pain discomfort bloating all\nthat stuff is happening because you have\nthis necrotic process going on which is\nnot like as peaceful and organized as\nthe apoptosis\noh the egg cell is the egg cell necrosis\nas well but the egg cell is Tiny it's\njust one one cell you have a whole\nuterine lining that is gonna like\nessentially die I mean it gets sloughed\noff right and that's what men see says\nokay\nanyway enough about balances let's move\non\nlet's have\nyeah every month it ain't easy so I\ndon't think most men you know really\never experience something along the\nlines of like it's like kind of getting\nthe flu like on a monthly basis right\nit's just like this period of time for\none week where you're just like kind of\nfeeling crappy and in in some relative\namount of pain it's just and it happens\nevery day a month\nright until menopause which is a whole\nother mess\nand uncomfortable but okay so basics of\nmenstruation that's going to become\nimportant in a second because we're\ngoing to talk about birth control\nso next thing that we're going to talk\nabout is like so now that we have a\nbasic understanding okay so puberty\nhappens right so people start to develop\nwomen have this hormonal cycle that\nresults in Menses if you have sex during\nthe week I mean during that one week or\nyou can even have it a little bit before\nbut you know there's basically a one\nweek window I'm oversimplifying where a\nwoman can get pregnant every month okay\nand so when we talk about so let's move\non a little bit to safe sex\nso like I said earlier a lot of times\nparents will ask their kids hey are you\nbeing safe and the kid is like yes and\nnowhere do we ever discuss like okay\nwhat are the dimensions of safety so\nwhen I talk to my patients about you\nknow safe sex I will talk about three or\nfour different things so one is I will\ntalk about birth control the second I\nwill think I will talk about is STIs\nbecause oftentimes those two things get\nconfused I know it's kind of weird the\nthird thing is sometimes we can talk\nabout pain uh which is like there are\nsome conditions that are relatively\ncommon which result in people having\nuncomfortable sexual experiences the\nchallenge with those conditions is that\nthe person feels like fundamentally\nmessed up so there's a lot of Shame\nassociated with these conditions\nso sometimes\num you know people think that they're\nlike not able to have sex or like that\neveryone else is enjoying sex and they\ndon't enjoy sex it's actually painful\nfor them so they think that there's\nsomething wrong with them and in a sense\nthere kind of is because there can be\nlike a medical problem but it's not like\nan issue of like you as a person it's\nlike your body may be responding to\nsexual activity and like uh you know in\na pathologic way so they're actually\nconditions that lead to pain during sex\nand so sometimes it's about educating\npeople about that kind of thing so just\nto give you guys an example you know I\nhad a a female patient who\num had a lot of difficulty having sex\nand it turned out she had a medical\ncondition but like she didn't realize\nthat for years she would just you know\ntry to engage in sexual relationships\nwith men and found it incredibly\nincredibly painful\num and so it was like like she just\nthought\nlike she was busted as like a human she\nwas like I can't ever you know I can\nsexually gratify my partners but it's\nlike painful every single time I do it I\ncare about them so much I even love them\nand and like but like something's wrong\nwith me like I can't like I don't know\nyou know like I can't I don't enjoy it I\nfeel like vomiting every time I have sex\nand it's like you know she comes into my\noffice and it's like whoa right it's so\nhard because she she understands that in\nthis Society like sexual pleasure and\nsexual gratification is a part of\nrelationships she feels really guilty\nfor like the way that her body responds\nand it turns out that there could be a\nmedical reason for it so that's why we\nhave conversations like this okay\nand then the Dude too is like like he's\nkind of at a loss as well this was a\nsituation where I I talked to her\npartner her fiance as well and and so\nlike he was kind of like you know I want\nto respect her boundaries so I'm totally\nfine\num you know not having sex and then like\nhe's willing to\ngive it up and then she feels super bad\nand he feels super bad and like no one\nfeels good about anything right it's\ndespite all of the love and all of the\ncaring everyone's just like stressed and\nnothing's going well and they don't know\nif they're ever gonna have kids and all\nthis kind of stuff so this is why I like\na little bit of Education actually goes\na long way okay\nso let's talk about\nthe different dimensions of safe sex\nokay so I don't know if we're going to\nget to things like consent\nbut let's talk about\nsafe sex\nso the first thing that we're going to\ntalk about so when you have safe sex the\nfirst thing that you need to watch out\nfor is STIs or sexually transmitted\ninfections okay so when we talk about\nSTIs so for those of you that don't know\nthere are bacterial infections\nand there are viral infections\nokay so oftentimes bacterial infections\nare things like gonorrhea\nchlamydia\nstuff like CIS uh syphilis\nokay so so like oftentimes these\nbacterial infections will cause things\nlike pain\ndischarge which is exactly what it\nsounds like it's like there's like posts\nor goop coming out of your sexual organs\nthe good news about bacterial infections\nis that like we can basically treat it\nwith antibiotics okay\nso this is what's super sad is that if\nyou get a bacterial infection like you\ncan just take a course of antibiotics\njust like get yourself some bactrim or\nsomething like that and then in like six\nor seven days the infection will be\ncleared you'll be totally fine okay and\nit's like not that big of a deal\num generally speaking there isn't any\nlong-term damage this is why it's also\nincredibly sad that people are not\neducated to this kind of stuff so if you\ndo have a bacterial infection\nwhat will happen a lot of times is like\nyou're let's assume a male patient for a\nsecond your penis will start to hurt\nit'll become red or swollen you'll start\nto get goop coming out of it right\ndischarge\nwe're not going to show pictures\nbut\nyou know and then what happens is you\nget embarrassed\nand like you're like oh God like what is\nwrong with me like what will people\nthink like will anyone find out and so\nyour embarrassment causes you to not\nseek medical care and you're like I hope\nit'll go away it's the tried and true\nit's the first you know medical\nintervention that most human beings make\nthe first medical choice that most human\nbeings make is I hope it goes away\nbecause it's cool because our body like\ntakes care of most things right you get\na mosquito bite it's not like you need\nto do anything your body will take care\nof it you sprain your ankle it's not\nlike your body you need to do anything\nbut other body will take care of it if\nyou have diarrhea you start vomiting you\nget fever like I'm just gonna like\nyou're hungover you get drunk you know\nyou're like oh I'll just if our body\nwill take care of it so a lot of people\nwill just let their body take care of it\nthat's a terrible idea when it comes to\nSTIs especially bacterial ones because\nyou can take a seven course seven day\ncourse of antibiotics and you could be\nfixed but instead what will happen and\nI've seen this and it's super sad\nsyphilis is a good example of like\npenicillin treats syphilis okay\nbut like when people don't treat\nsyphilis and syphilis is also kind of\ninteresting because it actually presents\nwith something called a Shanker which is\nlike a sore on let's say the penis that\nis non-painful so like you wake up one\nday and you're like there's like a\nlittle like dot on your dick and then\nlike over time like the dot grows and\nthen you're like well that's kind of\nweird it doesn't hurt or anything it's\njust just a weird like it's like an\nulcer on the penis and then you know it\ncan even go away and then people like\nokay fine or like it'll come come and go\nbut it doesn't really hurt people won't\ntake care of it and so then syphilis can\nspread to places like your spinal cord\nand like cause nerve damage and like all\nthis other kind of terrible stuff and\nthe the sad thing is that it's like\nsuper treatable so generally speaking\nyou know if you have sex with someone\nand then something weird happens to your\ngenitals they start to hurt or you start\nto see weird marks on them or things\nlike that go see a doctor okay\nnow what's a little bit more troubling\nwe'll get to what what else to do about\nthis in a second so what's more\ntroubling is viral infection so herpes\nis a good example of this HIV is\nsomething that people are uh you know\nunderstandably concerned about\nso these are kind of interesting because\nthese are lifelong so once you get a\nviral infection of herpes it's never\ngonna I mean the infection will stay\nthere forever\nsomething like HIV two is a lifelong\nillness so once you catch it you know\nyou got it so there are a couple of\ninteresting things though when it comes\nto herpes and we're going to go off on\nan interesting tangent here as well and\nthis has to do with a viral evolution\nso if we kind of think about let's say\nI'm a virus\nokay\nthese are Spike proteins it's not a sun\nif I'm a virus like an eye in fact a\nhuman being\nI've got a couple of different\nstrategies right like I can be very very\ninfectious\nand then kill the human being like let's\nsay I'm Ebola\nright I can like kill a human being and\nthen like in the process I'm bleeding\nand stuff and I infect other human\nbeings\nbut generally speaking these are not the\nmost successful viruses what's super\nsuccessful\nis herpes and so what herpes does is\nlike kind of bothers you but doesn't\nreally affect your survival and so\nessentially what happens is some viruses\nthat we get will actually like become\nrelatively dormant and not too much of a\npain in the ass so I think somewhere\nbetween 25 and 40 percent of like the\nhuman population has herpes\nand then you'll so you'll get these like\nsores that will come and go so you'll\nget like flares of herpes and then you\ncan start medication during those time\nthat will reduce the sores and stuff\nlike that but for many people like I\nthink maybe even 20 of people will never\nbe symptomatic or maybe 40 of people\nwill never be symptomatic with herpes so\nthey'll never have a sore or anything\nlike that the virus is just hanging out\nin your body and you can even\npotentially have a period of what's\ncalled asymptomatic shedding so this is\nsomething else to know about Herpes\num is that even if you don't have any\nactive virus you can still transmit it\nto other people\nHIV is sort of the same way so remember\nthat HIV leads to something called AIDS\nright which is acquired immune\nautoimmune acquired immunodeficiency\nsyndrome\nand so for many many years before people\ndevelop AIDS they will have active viral\nreplication and can spread it to other\npeople\nso AIDS is a so HIV is a virus that\nattacks your immune cells and so AIDS is\nnot actually direct damage from the\nvirus what happens is HIV destroys your\nimmune system and then you get all of\nthese infections that like normally\nhuman beings don't have to deal with\nbecause your immune system just takes\ncare of them it's kind of like you know\nif you're playing a video game and and\nyou can normally like you know you're\nplaying at a high MMR and then someone\ngoes and unplugs your mouse and your\nkeyboard and then suddenly you start\nlosing the noobs like the reason you're\nlosing to noobs is because you can no\nlonger play the game that's why HIV is\nsuch a devastating disease because it it\ncripples your body's ability to actually\nFight It The key thing to remember for\nthis scope of of this talk is first of\nall\neven if you've never had symptoms of\nthese things you can still have them\nright so this is like safety Point\nnumber one\nWith viral\nSTIs\nyou can be asymptomatic\nand still have it\nyou can be asymptomatic\nand still spread it\nright your partner can even be\nasymptomatic and you can still have it\nso this is why like if you've had we'll\ntalk about this in a second if you've\never had you know sex with a with\nanother human being without a condom or\na female condom or something like that\nthen you are at risk of having an STI\nthe only really case that I can think of\nwhere that's unlikely is that both of\nyou have never had sex with anyone else\nand even then in rare situations you can\nget viral transmission of things like\nHIV during birth and stuff like that if\nyour mom had it or whatever but usually\nlike doctors know about that because we\ntest about we test that kind of thing\nbefore mothers give birth\nbut generally speaking if your partner\nhas ever had sex without a condom with\nanyone and you have had sex without a\ncondom with anyone you are at risk of\nhaving a viral STI so this is where like\neveryone\nshould get tested\nright because you never know like if\nyour partner is lying to you or honest\nor whatever so generally speaking for\nyoung sexually active patients I\nrecommend they get tested at a minimum\nof once per year\ndepending on how high risk you are you\ncan get tested even more\nokay\nso next thing to kind of think about is\nall right so like how do we prevent\nthese things so this is where the the\ncondom comes in\nso the condom is the best uh protective\nbarrier against you know transmission of\nboth bacterial and viral infections so\nwearing a condom has two goals so con is\nto protect against STIs\nand actually it's it's interesting how\nmany people don't realize this\nI personally find it mind-boggling but\nyou know it just speaks to how our\nsystems of Education are and the second\nis to prevent pregnancy\nand these\nare two distinct\ngoals okay so this is where like you\nknow I've had patience that\nyou know will be like oh yeah so like I\nhooked up with a girl and I was like\nokay were you safe and they were like\nyeah\nand I I then I asked the question like\nwhat do you you know what do you mean\nit's like oh like I asked her she's on\nthe pill it's like not a big deal right\nso like safe sometimes people mean like\ngetting pregnant\nand sometimes they mean like protecting\nagainst an STI and it's like so then\nI'll ask my patient I was like did you\nactually use a condom and he's like no I\ndidn't need to because she's on birth\ncontrol it's like not a big deal\nright and even for people who are like\nnot even in the hookup stage I'll talk\nto people who are in like monogamous\nrelationships yeah I've been dating a\ngirl for a year we use condoms for the\nfirst six months and then like you know\nthen we stopped using condoms because\nshe was on the pill and like you know I\ntrust her and it's like okay fine even\nif you trust her has she ever had sex\nwithout a condom with anyone else have\nyou ever had sex without a condom with\nanyone else\nand has has she ever been tested and\nhave you you've ever been tested the\nfact that you're asymptomatic does not\nmean that you know she could have\nasymptomatic HIV you could have\nasymptomatic HIV\nso condoms are the best way to protect\nagainst STIs\num outside of you know abstinence and\nstuff like that\nand so that's really our goal so like\njust thinking about you know Dr K's like\ntwo things that you should talk to a\ndoctor about one is that if you've had\nuh sex with another human being without\na condom and both of y'all are not\nvirgins and even if they say they're a\nvirgin\nuh because you you never really know\nright it's it's a good thing to just go\nahead and get tested it's a cheap test\nmost doctors will order it just you'll\nhave the peace of mind\num and then when you you know if you do\nhave sex with someone use a condom\nbecause even if they're on birth control\nlike you just don't know what they've\ngot so like gonorrhea and chlamydia too\ncan be asymptomatic for a while and\nthat's like how they spread right\nbecause it's not like they\nyou know like they're they're actively\nreplicating and like there's not\ndischarge and pain coming out of your\npenis or your vagina\nand then like then you have sex with\nsomeone and then like they transmit it\nthere you transmit it and then you get\nit and that's how it works okay\nquestions about STIs\nokay next thing we're going to talk\nabout is birth control\nOkay so\nthe first thing to understand is that\nthere are many kinds of birth control\nnow Dr K's Rusty on my statistics but\nI'm just I think this is right but I\nhaven't really checked these statistics\nin like 15 years\nso methods of birth control\nnumber one the pull out method so if you\nguys remember there is a menstrual cycle\nright so what some people will do is\nlike they'll you know try to time it so\nthis is the timing method where we're\nonly going to have sex when you know\nduring the three weeks that we're not\novulating so that's number one pull out\nis number two which is like you know if\nthe dude doesn't ejaculate in the vagina\nthen you know that's a method of birth\ncontrol so I want to say that the pull\nout method is like 60 to 70 percent\neffective\nso what does this mean so last time I\nchecked which was some time ago the\nstatistics that I'm going to cite are\ngoing to be if a couple is having sex\nover the course of the year what is the\nlikelihood they will wind up pregnant or\nnot yeah so let's let's look at it this\nway\nso this is efficacy\nand what efficacy means is preventing\npregnancy\nokay and so this is like you know\n100 minus this number is the percent\nchance that you'll get pregnant\nover one year\nokay so what this means is like 30 to 40\npercent of people who use the pull out\nmethod will get pregnant I think the\ntiming method too is like pretty bad\nit's like maybe a little bit higher I\ndon't really remember the exact\nstatistic so 20 to 30 percent of people\nwho like you know use this method will\nstill wind up pregnant if you have sex\nover the course of a year and what some\npeople may be saying is about like the\npull out method doesn't that you know\nwhat's up with that like so what are the\nfactors so the first is that\nsometimes before you actually like have\nan orgasm and ejaculate you'll actually\nrelease some degree of semen so there's\nlike\num you know there's the pre-ejaculate\nwhich can sometimes have semen so that's\none thing the other thing the other\nreason why it is so effective because\nstill at the end of the day like two out\nof three people that use the pull out\nmethod at the end of the year won't be\npregnant and that's because remember\nthat you know 75 of the time a woman\nisn't actually like 75 of days of the\nyear the average woman is not able to\nget pregnant right so what we're kind of\ntalking about is like a series of like\nyou know\nConfluence of events so first of all she\nhas to be in the ovulatory window and\nthen like you have to have maybe\npre-ejaculate or sometimes you screw up\nor like don't screw up like even if you\nscrew up there's a 75 chance that their\nyour partner's not going to get pregnant\nright so that also depends on things\nlike frequency of sex and things like\nthat so these pull out method timing\nmethod I don't recommend them\nnext thing to think about is condoms\nso condoms are actually 90 effective\nat preventing pregnancy and what is that\nhow does that work well so it turns out\nthat a big part of like condom\nEffectiveness is like user error\nso what this sort of means is that if I\nhave a partner and I'm going to oh okay\nwe're lagging if I have sex for the over\nthe course of a year\num and\nlike nine out of ten people who use\ncondoms and have sex over the course of\nthe Year won't wind up with a pregnancy\nten percent of them will\nokay so like some of this is like it's a\nlittle bit unclear exactly what's\nhappening I don't think that generally\nspeaking you know condoms are are faulty\nthere you know some people will store\nthem in places like their wallet or\nthings like that where it may degrade\nlike the the latex barrier or things\nlike that\num I think that these are if if memory\nserves these are like pretty\nnaturalistic studies so essentially what\nthey do is they'll ask like\nyou know a hundred people do you have\nsex and they'll say yes and they'll say\nlike you know did you did you get\npregnant or do you use a condom they'll\nsay yes and they'll say like did you get\npregnant and then 10 of people will say\nyes so we kind of rate the efficacy of\ncondoms at 90 okay\num which is actually terrifying to me\npersonally\nso next thing to kind of think a little\nbit about is the birth control pill\nso with the birth control pill basically\nis is\nestrogen\nand progesterone but there are\nprogesterone only versions\nand the birth control pill I think is\nsomething like you know 95 to 97\neffective\nso we're talking about three to five\npercent pregnancy rate\nand the key thing about the pill is you\nbasically are taking hormones for three\nweeks out of the month and then I if\nmemory serves properly there's like one\nweek where you know it's it's not quite\nPlacebo but there's a they're different\nhormonal formulations that will allow\nyou to menstruate and basically the way\nthat birth control pills work is we're\nadding estrogen and progesterone which\nby the way this follicle produces\nprogesterone\nand you know these hormonal things are\ncreating estrogen\nso essentially what happens is like\nwhen you have progesterone and estrogen\nfloating around\nthese are going to block\nproduction of GnRH which in turn will\nblock\nproduction of FSH in LH\nright so for those of you all that are\nkind of familiar with this basically the\nway that our our body works is through\nhormonal feedback loops and so if\nestrogen and progesterone are low GnRH\nfrom our hypothalamus gonadotropin\nreleasing hormone will increase which\nwill cause these to increase and as\nthese increase will go towards ovulation\nand as we go to ovulation we're going to\nproduce more progesterone so then this\nthen goes up and then once this goes up\nthis goes down you guys see it's like a\nfeedback loop\nokay so we can draw it out over here\nreal quick\nso we've got GnRH\nincreases FSH and LH this is a little\nbit of a simplification causes ovulation\nwhich in turn creates progesterone\nright and these are actually going to\ncreate estrogen over here too let's go\nthis way\nand then these in turn go and block\nthis right so so it's it's like a\nfeedback loop where the greater this is\neventually it'll produce Downstream\nhormones that will reduce this growth\nand as we reduce this growth the\ninhibition decreases and it increases\nGnRH that's how our body like balances\nthings so if we think about things like\nour blood pressure right so how does our\nbody maintain a blood pressure of 120\nover 80. it has a system of feedback\nloops you have things like baroreceptors\nso what a barrel receptor does is\nmeasures the stretch\nbut within your blood vessels and so if\nthere if the pressure is greater it's\ngoing to stretch more activate the\nbarrel receptor and cause you to\ndecrease the strength at which your\nheart pumps which will reduce the amount\nof stretch in your blood vessels which\nwill then tone down the signal on the\nbarrel receptor you guys with me or is\nthat like too complicated\nyou guys get that\nno\nokay okay the the general principle is\nthere's a feedback loop\nright like everything like so our body\nmaintains a blood pressure of 120 over\n80 because it's got like signals that\nmake sure that if we if we go below 120\nor 80 oh over 80 we'll increase our\nblood pressure and we have ways of\ndetecting that and if we go above 120\nover 80 we have ways of detecting that\nwe'll drop our blood pressure\nokay\nwe'll talk about mood and stuff in a\nsecond all right so let's go back so why\nis birth control only 95 to 97 percent\neffective once again it's user error\nso generally speaking if you're taking\nyour birth control properly and you're\ntaking it on time and stuff like that it\nis theoretically close to 100 effective\nbut it turns out that human beings\nsometimes don't take their pills on time\nthey miss a day whatever\nand so if you don't take your pills\nproperly\nyou have a three to five percent chance\nof getting uh pregnant\nso then\num after that what we've got is the\npatch or the implant\nso then what people decided is we're\ngoing to develop essentially a birth\ncontrol Patcher implant\nso what this is is it's like something\nthat you can get like like on your arm\nusually like under the skin like an\nimplant that will release progesterone\nestrogen and progesterone and I think\nthese are essentially 99 effective so\nonce you remove user error from the\nequation\n99 times out of 100 like people won't be\nable to get pregnant\nokay\num so this is where like you know the\nhormones themselves are gonna are damn\nnear perfect it's just the you know once\nyou force people to take pills it\nbecomes problematic so for example this\nis why you should you should actually\nconsult with a doctor like if I have a\npatient with ADHD\nI'm going to you know talk to them about\ngetting a patch or an implant over the\npills because if you've got ADHD your\nlikelihood of user error and forgetting\nto take pills is greater now this is a\nconversation with the person I've had a\nlot of patients with ADHD that like\nthey may forget everything else in the\nuniverse but the one thing that they\nalways take like clockwork is going to\nbe their birth control medication so\nit's not like necessarily like ADHD\npeople can't take birth control meds\nit's just you have to have a\nconversation and this is where the\nindividualization of your condition like\nis important okay\nthen the last thing that we're going to\ntalk about is an IUD or not last thing\nbut the last birth control for women\noutside of surgery is an IUD so this is\nan intrauterine device so remember\nover here what an intrauterine device is\nis they take like a\na piece of like they stick a device into\nthe uterus now remember that the uterus\nis like beyond the vagina right so\nhere's the cervix\nwhich is like the Gatehouse to the\nuterus and then here's the vagina\nso it's something that's implanted\nwithin the uterus so oftentimes these\ndevices are made of copper\nand since they're copper they actually\ncause inflammation\nin the uterine wall and this\ninflammation in the uterine wall\nprevents the egg from being able to\nimplant so you can actually create a\nfertilized egg but it just can't ever\nimplant into the uterine wall so it's\nnever going to grow you're never going\nto get pregnant\nso iuds come in just the copper variety\nor\ncopper plus hormone usually progesterone\nand these are also like 99.9 percent\neffective maybe it's I know it's greater\nthan let's I don't know that it's 99.9\nactually\nbut\nthey're also removable so the the copper\none lasts for about five years or maybe\nlonger actually I think the copper one\nmay last longer the hormonal one so it\nalso releases progesterone which if we\ngo back up here we remember that it's\nthis progesterone that essentially acts\nas your body's internal birth control so\nwhen we take birth control pills we're\nactually like trying to simulate this\nthing that prevents you from getting\npregnant\nokay so for example\num and the the term progesterone means\nprogestation so even the placenta will\nrelease progesterone to prevent like you\nfrom ovulating while you're pregnant if\nthat kind of makes sense okay\nso these are 99 effective you know\nthey're in your body for I'm a little\nbit Rusty on this I think the the\nhormonal one is five years\nthe copper one may be more it may be\nlike 10 years I'm not entirely sure\num but this is basically you know so you\nhave a one percent chance or less\nof getting pregnant\nso if you were a young sexually active\nwoman who doesn't want to worry about\nanything and is not planning on getting\npregnant for about five years this is\nwhat I would recommend so for most of my\npatients when they ask me Dr K what kind\nof birth control should I take\nunless they've got other factors which\nwe'll talk about in a second like\nbasically like iuds are great because\nyou kind of fire and forget\nand then when you're ready to get\npregnant you can take it out right or\nyou have to change it out every five\nyears so it tends to be like very very\nlike you know there's no hormones being\nput in even with implants and patches\nyou have to kind of get them changed\nit's like you go once you get an\nappointment you get an IUD like they're\nreally fantastic\nso outside of this we also have um\nprocedures right so we have tubal\nligation\nwhich is getting your tubes tied\nwhich is damn near 100 effective and\nthen we also have vasectomy\nwhich is\nclose to 100 effectiveness\nand what this is when you have a tubal\nligation remember that\nthe follicle starts here in your ovaries\nand it travels down the tube\nand then we'll like ovulate and so a\ntubal ligation is basically closing this\noff\nand so then your ovaries can never the\nthe follicles and eggs from your ovaries\ncan never get to your uterus which\nbasically makes it impossible for you to\nget pregnant now there are some risks uh\nwith tubal ligation like sometimes you\ncan have like\num you know an ectopic pregnancy and\nstuff like that but that's kind of\nbeyond the scope of this an ectopic\npregnancy is a pregnancy that implants\nsomewhere outside of the uterus so\nsometimes you can even get implantation\nof an egg over here in the fallopian\ntube and that can be really dangerous\nbut it's quite rare\nso and then vasectomy is when\num you know men will essentially have so\nwe've got\nyou know our scrotum and then we've got\ntubes that connect to our penis and so a\nvasectomy is when we kind of slip the\nsnip these so that the sperm can never\nget into the penis and yes this is a bad\npenis on purpose\nI'm sure I could draw a slightly better\nanatomical penis but I'm choosing not to\nokay chat because [ __ ] y'all\nokay\nokay so so vasectomy and tubal ligation\nso some of these can also be\num\nthey can be like reversible to a certain\ndegree but generally speaking when\nyou're done having kids and you never\nwant kids again this is like the the\nbirth control of choice\nokay\nso questions about\nbirth control\nforeign\nokay\nand then if you want to troll if you\nguys want to get into it then there's\nalso there's another\num\n100 percent\neffectiveness of birth control which is\nbeing Challenger rank at League of\nLegends right this is something that is\nmale birth control that results in 100\nefficacy of pregnancy prevention\nwe good\n[Laughter]\nokay\nso uh okay so that's that's birth\ncontrol so you guys get that so like\nokay big picture for a second\nall right so when we talk about safe sex\ntwo major dimensions of safety one is\nSTIs\nkey thing to remember about STIs\nthey can be asymptomatic for a while and\nyou can still transmit and get them so\nif you've been sexually active without a\ncondom you should probably get tested at\na minimum of like once a year for\npatients that I have that are more high\nrisk I'll recommend more frequent\ntesting\num so best way to protect against STIs\nare to get a to use condoms the other\nthing that I recommend in terms of like\nsafe sex is like if you don't want to\nuse a condom you get tested your partner\ngets tested you guys are in a trusting I\nideally monogamous relationship if\nyou're in a poly relationship I guess\nit's fine as long as everyone gets\ntested so everyone within your sexual\ngroup\ngets tested and is going to be exclusive\nwith each other so you can't get\ncontamination from the outside\nand then once you have birth control\nlike you can start to you know have sex\nwithout a condom no big deal\nsecond reason we use condoms are to\num\nprevent\npregnancy right but that's when we open\nthings up to birth control so the\ncondoms tend to be the number one male\nform of birth control vasectomy is quite\nextreme\num and then you know like there are lots\nof other forms that primarily have to be\non the woman's side and uh those tend to\nbe you know like a lot of people will\nstart the pill the birth control pill\nwhich you know you have to take every\nday there can be implants you guys can\ndo things like iuds so you just have to\nfigure out you know what's the right\nmove for you and what you're comfortable\nwith\nokay so having safe sex in summary I\nthink involves like two things one is\nlike protecting against STIs and the\nsecond is protecting against pregnancy\nyeah you can also do shots so there's\nlike other forms of birth control and\nstuff like this isn't complete by any\nmeans so for example we didn't talk\nabout fungal infections this can be kind\nof annoying because like a woman can\nhave a fungal infection you can pass it\nto a man the woman's will self-resolve\nand then the man gets it and then passes\nit back to the woman you can like pass\nit back and forth\num\nso yeah\nokay\nnow what we're going to do is talk a\nlittle bit I see that there's some\nquestions we'll get to those in a second\nso now we're going to get to a couple of\ncommon conditions\num that I think like\npeople tend to deal with\nso a lot of these conditions so this is\nlike the normal sexual stuff and then\nthere are a lot of things that people\nwill deal with that are that result in\npain and discomfort that they're kind of\nnot aware of and educating about them\neducating about these conditions can be\nreally helpful at having like your\nHealthy sexual relationship okay so the\nfirst is we're going to talk about\nfamosis\nand vaginismus\nso phimosis so for those of you that\ndon't know here's a bad penis drawing\nagain\nthere is this thing called the foreskin\nwhich is like a piece of skin that kind\nof covers the penis and when when the\nwhen the penis becomes erect\nthe force like you know the penis kind\nof okay this is gonna the penis\nelongates\nright and then the foreskin kind of\nhangs back over here\nso there's actually a condition called\nfemosis\nwhere the the foreskin is basically like\nvery tight and you can't really pull it\nback so when you get an erection like\nyou can't open up the foreskin and you\ncan like the penis has difficulty like\nexpanding out as it fills with blood so\nwhat this basically results in is like\npainful erections\nso fimosas thankfully is like quite rare\num usually involves like some kind of\nscarring or accident with the foreskin\nwhere it develops Scar Tissue so it's\nnot as flexible as it used to be but\nlike can result in a lot of you know\nshame and like oh my God like I can't\nget an erector my penis is small or like\nit hurts so much every time I get erect\nso I you know I have to stay away from\nwomen and like or men or you know\num so that's you know famosis is just an\nexample of like a rare condition the\nreason I bring it up is simply because\nthere are like biological reasons like\nif something involving your sexual\norgans feels very very uncomfortable to\nyou or painful like go see a doctor\nright because you could be one of the\nfew unlucky people that has femosis\nwhat's a little bit more common is\nvaginismus and this is a spasm\nof essentially like the outer muscles\nof the vagina\nso what that means is like when you have\na muscle spasm so remember that you know\nthe outside of the vagina has lots of\nmuscles and so when they spasm and\ncontract\nit like they they contract and like\nnothing can enter so a lot of times what\nwill happen is you'll get you know a lot\nof contraction and spasm\nwhich means that anything that if you\ntry to have penetrative sex you're gonna\nget a ton of pain and then like the\nproblem with vaginismus is that there\nappear to be you know there are\ndifferent kinds of treatments for it so\nyou can you can do things like uh\nvaginal dilators\num also things like Psychotherapy can be\neffective\nso we know that like vaginismus does\nhave a mental component sometimes you'll\nhave uh people with a history of trauma\nwho develop vaginismus\num and so vaginal dilators are like you\nknow using these particular devices that\nwill slowly allow\nthe the spasm to kind of relax\nso it takes a lot of time and effort but\nthis too leads to a lot of you know\nshame\nself-worth issues\nlike leads to a lot of relationship\nproblems because the woman doesn't know\nwhat's wrong with her like it just hurts\na lot every time she has sex and she\nloves this person and she wants to have\na relationship with them the dude is\nkind of like doesn't know what to do\nabout it they're kind of confused people\nwill try Lube because they're like okay\nmaybe it's an issue of lube so the point\nhere is that if you're having pain or\ndiscomfort during sexual intercourse you\nshould go see a medical professional\nbecause it's not that you're\nfundamentally busted or broken or\nwhatever it's it's just that you know\nlike there may be actually something\nmedical going on\num\nand so other conditions that you know\ncause pain this isn't really related to\nto sex directly but endometriosis I'm\njust kind of including so some women\nwill have endometriosis which is the\npresence of this uterine tissue\nso remember this uterine tissue over\nhere\nin places outside of the uterus so\nsometimes you'll get a spot of uh\nuterine tissue here sometimes you can\neven get it in the abdomen so you can\nget it like outside of the uterus\nand then what happens is when you go\nthrough the necrotic phase of\nmenstruation this stuff because remember\nthis is all mediated by hormones right\nand hormones travel all over your body\nso you get all these spots of uterine\ntissue that start dying like all over\nyour abdomen it's incredibly incredibly\npainful\nand so like some women are just really\nreally surprised by like how bad\nmenstruation is like they're in tons of\npain it feels like the pain is even like\noutside of the uterine area and so\nendometriosis is a very very unfortunate\ncondition that causes like a lot of pain\nso people are also asking about\nyou know menstrual cycles and mental\nhealth there are lots of good\ncorrelations there are patients that\nI've had that starting them on birth\ncontrol is like helps their depression\nso I'll use birth control as an\nadjunctive medication to treat their\ndepression because there are mood\nfluctuations with all these hormonal\nfluctuations other things that I'll do\nwith people who have really really bad\npmdd which is premenstrual dysphoric\ndisorder\num they're not not necessarily pmdd but\nyou know who have like menstrual like\nreally really bad periods and really\nreally bad moods sometimes I'll actually\nsend them for an endometriosis\nevaluation because sometimes the reason\nthat your mood is so damn bad is because\nlike there are parts of your body that\nare dying like scattered throughout your\nabdomen and it just hurts like hell and\nso like you're cranky and you don't feel\nlike doing anything and you kind of get\nsad and depressed and even get a little\nbit of the PTSD so that next month rolls\naround you're like oh my God it's gonna\nhappen again and it happens again and\nagain and again and again and again and\nagain and again\nand so like endometriosis I kind of\ninclude it for the sake of completeness\nit's not really like a sexual problem\nit's not really related to sex I just\ninclude it as like something that\nhappens to people that's relatively\ncommon that can affect your mood can\naffect a lot of stuff around\nmenstruation and you're you know you\nfeel like having sex or don't feel like\nhaving sex\nkind of a PSA\num other conditions that you know people\nwill kind of mention this is sort of a\nrandom smattering so it's not like I've\npicked the most common so\nhypoestrogenism\num is a good example of something that\nleads to like vaginal dryness\nme\nso this is like another thing that's\nfilled with lots of Shame and self-worth\nissues is that some women have either a\nlow level of estrogen or low response to\nestrogen in the vaginal tissue which\nresults in dryness if there's dryness\nthere can be pain during intercourse so\nyou know treatment for this is just\nthings like using lubricants\num sometimes even starting birth control\ncan help\nright and so there's just a lot of\nthings out there that can make sex\npainful or uncomfortable and as long as\nwe know because what tends to happen\nlike psychologically let's just talk\nabout this for a second if you don't\nknow about any of this stuff\nand you just hear that sex is amazing\nand everyone's getting laid on Tinder\nand whatnot and like people romanticize\nit in movies and and TV shows and if\nyou're a Netflix producer you sprinkle\nin random sexual scenes in places that\nthey don't belong for I don't understand\nwhy but whatever\num and and then like what happens is\nlike there's there's a societal\nperception of what you know what sex is\nsupposed to be like\nand and so like if you don't live up to\nthat societal perception it results in\nlike lots of shame because you're like\nI'm kind of screwed up right so other\ngood examples of that are like you know\nthings like penis size where\nyou know a lot of people are concerned\nabout the size of their penis\num even I've unfortunately made fun of\npeople with micropenis in the past it's\nsomething that I regret and the truth is\nlike I don't know if you guys know this\nbut there are these people called\nlesbians and they're able to have\nhealthy sexual lives and they actually\ndon't even have penises at all they have\nlike the tiniest penises on the planet\nand they actually do fine\nand so it turns out that like you know\npenis size is actually like not that\nimportant\num so even if people you know there's a\nlot of stuff involving shame and\nself-worth and people like feeling like\ntheir body isn't good enough and it\nturns out that having a healthy sexual\nrelationship is you know is just about\nreally understanding like yourself\nunderstanding your body understanding\nyour partner it doesn't come down to you\nknow the size of your penis or any other\nlike arbitrary characteristic so just\nkeep that in mind\nokay the last thing that we're going to\ncover today\num is just like a couple of\nsurprisingly common sexual problems so\nwe're going to talk about premature\nejaculation\nand death grip syndrome\nthis one\nis an actual medical thing\nthis one is something that Dr K made up\nbut I see way too much\nokay so let's talk about this so\npremature ejaculation is when people\nejaculate very quickly\nat the end of the day there are a lot of\ndifferent things that you can do there's\na lot of you know shame associated with\npremature ejaculation as well\nthere are treatments for it so oddly\nenough you can start people on ssris for\nuh premature ejaculation so one of the\nside effects of ssris which are\nantidepressant or anti-anxiety\nmedication is that like they make it\nharder for you to climax so sometimes\nyou can even use this with people who\nprematurely ejaculate if they start an\nSSRI like they can essentially last\nlonger other things that you can do is\nyou can you know wear a condom so that\nreduces the amount of feeling you have\nand things like that there are just\nother just like General things that you\ncan do for premature ejaculation you can\nuse Mental distraction I know it's kind\nof weird\nbut you can think about video games\nwhile having sex and that'll actually\nlike help you last longer because your\nmind won't be so into the sex\num it's difficult to do but it does work\nand then there are other things that you\ncan do just as you start to have sex on\na more regular basis as you get to know\nyour partner oftentimes premature\nejaculation well actually I I swear guys\nI'm not trolling you I'm serious so\nthere's actually like you can use Mental\ndistraction and think about non-sexual\nthings right because if we think about\nthe process of arousal and ejaculation\nand climax like arousal is a huge part\nof it right you don't just walk around\nejaculating\nI mean right like I realized that some\nof y'all are gonna punish me for saying\nthat but it's true\nso the the truth is\nsuch a bad\nso the truth is that arousal has a lot\nto do with reaching climax and so you\ncan use Mental distraction\nto reduce your internal state of arousal\nand will allow you to ejaculate later\num interestingly enough there are also\nlike techniques of tantric meditation\nwhich we can talk about in a second that\nalso can help people with premature\nevacuation\nother things that you can do for\npremature ejaculation I know it's kind\nof weird but I've seen a lot of\nself-resolution\nin committed relationships\nso just like slowing things down and\nalmost like training yourself so like\ntraining yourself with your partner as\nyou get close kind of slowing down\ntaking a step back like restarting like\nyou can just sort of like retrain kind\nof behaviorally like your body's\nresponse like almost in a biofeedback\nway\nif with kind of time and effort and\ndedication death grip syndrome is\nsomething else entirely and this is\nwhere\num when people masturbate for a long\nperiod I'm talking about men so when\nthey masturbate for long periods of time\nespecially without Lube\nand you know using\nhand and like for years and years and\nyears what happens is you can also like\ntrain your nerves to respond to a\nparticular kind of\num\nstimulation to reach Climax and so when\nit's kind of bizarre but some people who\nlike let's say you like you've never had\nsex and you've been masturbating for 10\nto 15 years and then you have\nintercourse for the first time in the\nsensations provided by intercourse are\nactually quite different from what your\nbody has gotten used to so you know the\nthe the lubrication and the pressure and\nthings like that it tends to be a little\nbit less than what you can do with your\nthe lubrication is greater and the\npressure can be less which results in a\ndifferent physical uh sensation which\nresults in a difficulty to attain climax\nthrough sexual intercourse\nthis too can be sort of fixed through\ntraining\num so the first thing is that you know\nusing lube and a lighter grip\nit's going to feel kind of weird because\na lot of people that you know who go\nthrough this experience will like it\nkind of feels unsatisfying to masturbate\nin that way but like you kind of got to\ndo that or you can start to have more\nsex and then your body will\nreacclimatize\naren't these solution to one another\nsort of right so they're kind of like\nopposites\num\nall right so though that's kind of like\njust a couple of random other things so\nthis this lecture is by no means\ncomplete but when it comes to you know\npeople that come into my office and we\ntry to talk about safe sex we haven't\nreally talked about consent really at\nall which I I think maybe is just a\nwhole lot of lecture because we've been\nat this for over an hour and 15 minutes\nnow\num but the the goal is is really to just\nshare with you all some like basic\ninformation about like sexual education\nit's not to be mimish which I know we\ndid but it's really just to empower\nyourselves to understand a couple of\nbasic things one is like what does safe\nsex mean\num from an STI perspective from a\npregnancy perspective second is uh you\nknow what are some common problems that\npeople will run across and the main\nmessage there is not for you guys to\nself-diagnose you know is not to\ndiagnose yourself with these things but\nto recognize that if you have any kind\nof pain any kind of discomfort if\nsomething about your understanding your\nperception of what sex should be like is\nyou have a perception of sex and you\nhave like an actual experience of sex\nand those don't line up one of the first\nthings you should do is go see a medical\nprofessional because it turns out that\nthere's all kinds of stuff from vaginal\nspasm\nto you know premature ejaculation to\nhypoestrogenism\num to famosis there's like all kinds of\nstuff like this is by no means a\ncomplete list right so there are like\nthey're actual doctors who will train\nfor four years to become you know OB\nguys so Obstetrics and Gynecology and\nthis is what they specialize in so they\nlike you know they understand everything\nabout Gynecology getting pregnant the\ncomplications of pregnancy birth control\nall that kind of stuff so I'm a\npsychiatrist it's not like actually my\narea of expertise\nand so you know determining what the\nright move is for you like involves\nfirst of all getting a good diagnostic\nevaluation if you're running into any of\nthese problems\nsecond thing is to you know make the\nright choice for you in terms of birth\ncontrol and like safe sexual habits and\nstuff like that which is also highly\nindividualized I sort of mentioned ADHD\nthere are other things that are really\nimportant to know so for example birth\ncontrol pills have a high increase your\nrisk of having stroke and ischemic\nproblems like ischemic strokes and\nthings like that and clots so basically\nlike they make your blood more likely to\nclot and so if you have a clot and a\nblood vessel in your brain you're going\nto have a stroke so a stroke stroke is\nwhen a portion of your brain doesn't\nreceive enough blood and then actually\ndies\nso you know uh birth control pills\nincrease your risk of stroke so they're\nnot really recommended in people over\n35.\num they are also compound with cigarette\nsmoking so if you smoke cigarettes and\nyou're on birth control pills they will\nlike drastically increase your risk of\nstroke\nthere are also other like details which\nwe kind of didn't go into here for\nexample like birth control pills tend to\nbe dosed based in a particular weight\nrange so if you're outside of that\nweight range the birth control may not\nbe as effective which means that your\nyour likelihood of getting pregnant\ncould actually increase depending on\nyour weight so there are all these\ndifferent medical complications or not\nnot complications in terms of bad things\nbut the the medical decision making is\nquite complicated which is why you all\nshould go see a doctor about it okay"
