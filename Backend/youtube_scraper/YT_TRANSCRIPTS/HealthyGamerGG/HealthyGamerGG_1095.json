    "transcript": "almost as you get fatigued by like\ntowards 4 p.m 6 p.m 7 p.m it becomes\nlike easier for you to start studying\nand then you stay up all night you pound\ncaffeine and then you kind of get into\nwhat i would call like the fatigue\ngroove for lack of a better term okay so\nwe're gonna talk a little bit about why\nis it that\nyou get a ton of motivation when you're\ngoing to bed at night\num\nand\nwhy when you wake up in the morning like\nyou don't actually do anything okay\nso a couple of different dimensions that\nwe're going to talk about\none is like so our question is why do we\nget motivated at night but like not\nduring the day so we're going to start\nby understanding some stuff about\nneuroscience we're going to talk about\none aspect of psychology and then we're\njust going to talk about a couple of\ngeneral principles this is almost more\nspiritual\nabout clarity of mind and like where\nmotivation comes from and we're going to\ntalk about behavioral calculations as\nwell okay\nso the first thing to understand i'm\ngoing to tell you guys about an\nexperiment okay\nso they took a bunch of mice\nand\nwhat they were doing is trying to assess\nthere's a part of our brain called the\nnucleus accumbens\nand the nucleus accumbens is the part of\nour brain that actually manages\nreward and behavior okay so it's a very\ndopamine it's like a very like it's one\nof the dopamine circuits in the brain so\na lot of times people are talking about\ndopamine dopamine dopamine like dopamine\nis the reason that like i get addicted\nto video games i need to detox off of\ndopamine i'm in dopamine exhaustion we\ntalk about dopamine everyone talks about\ndopamine dopamine\nso in the nucleus accumbens there's\ndopamine\nbut the interesting thing is that\nall of this stuff has been\noversimplified so i'm going to add some\ncomplexity to it but even i'm going to\nbe oversimplifying\nso they took a group of mice and they\nbasically did a really interesting\nexperiment where they injected different\nstuff into the nucleus accumbens of mice\nso generally speaking they took mice and\nthey gave them two options of food\none is like a high carbohydrate super\ntasty like twinkie pellet it's basically\nlike a pellet that's like a twinkie and\nthe other is like a regular food and\nthey normally have to work a little bit\nharder they have to like press a lever\nto get like the twinkie versus like the\nkale salad okay\nso generally speaking when you give mice\nthis choice what'll happen is they'll\nlike they'll go for the twinkie they'll\ngo for the high carbohydrate nutrient\ndense food and they'll eat it and\nthey'll be happy little mice fat little\nmice too\nso what some researchers did is they\nuh\ninjected\na certain amount of dopamine blocker\ninto the brains of these mice okay so\nwe're gonna kind of go back to this for\na second\nand let's see what happened\nso\ni'm gonna have to figure out how to draw\nthis so let's say you've got a mouse\nand then the default\nis high energy pellet\nand then the other option is low energy\npellet\nso normally\nin the situation\nthat\nour normal situation let's call it blue\nso normally a mice goes a mouse goes\nthis way they they choose the high\ndopamine pellet okay\nso then what what researchers did is\nthey they blocked dopamine in the\nnucleus accumbens\nso in the nucleus accumbens of mice\nthey took a\ndopamine blocker\nand they blocked dopamine and what they\nactually found when you block the action\nof dopamine in the nucleus accumbens is\nthat mice will actually go this way\nokay so if we blocked opening that's\nbecause these are a little bit harder to\nget the other way you can kind of think\nabout it is that they have no preference\nfor the high energy pellet over the low\nenergy pellet\nand then they did something really\ninteresting\nthey took a third chemical\nadenosine\nand they actually blocked\nthe action of adenosine\nin the nucleus accumbens and what they\nfound is that the mouse went back to the\nhigh energy palette\nokay\nso now we're going to talk a little bit\nbecause like you know neuroscience is\ncomplicated but you know most people\ntalk about dopamine don't talk about in\na complicated sense so there's three\nstates that we can kind of think of\nin terms of dopamine and adenosine\nokay\nso let's just talk actually for a second\nabout what adenosine is adenosine is\nessentially a waste product in the brain\nso we have a um\nwe have this like the the fuel of our\nbrain is something called atp\nand the waste product after we burn a\nmolecule of atp is to wind up with\nadenosine and we know we don't really i\nmean adenosine does all kinds of stuff\nso i'm oversimplifying things but the\nother thing that we know is as you as\nthe day goes on so like if we think\nabout um you know\ntime of the day\nin adenosine\nokay\nwhat happens over time\nas we go throughout our day is adenosine\nslowly climbs\nand then we go to sleep\nand then what our brain does is clear\nadenosine from the brain\nand then this is waking up\nso as the day goes on\nwe increase in our adenosine so what i\nwould kind of say and if we kind of\nthink about dopamine for a second okay\nso when you wake up first thing in the\nmorning and you feel really excited to\nplay a game\nso let's say this is dopamine\nand let's say this is time i'm super\nexcited to play a game i really want to\nplay dota there's a new patch the first\ngame of dota i play gives me a lot of\ndopamine right this is an\noversimplification but dopamine signal\nis a better way to put it and then the\nmore games of dota i play essentially my\ndopamine starts to go down\nso this is why when you kind of look at\nlike behavioral reinforcement\nright so this is why people will say\nlike at the beginning of the day like\nthat's when you like if you're\nproductive at the beginning you're going\nto have a good day whereas if you start\nplaying video games like it's a lot\neasier to do work for two hours and then\nstart gaming than it is to play for two\nhours stop and then start doing work\nso our dopamine generally speaking like\nwe get more bored of crap by the end of\nthe day we're excited to do things but\nby like 7 p.m 8 p.m you're like eh if\nyou've been playing games all day you\ndon't really feel like doing much right\nand then we go to sleep over here\nand then we kind of wind up\nback here when we wake up if we're lucky\nso if we kind of look at it there are\nkind of three states of dopamine and\nadenosine throughout the day and\nremember this is a waste product right\nso we can have high dopamine and low\nadenosine so this is in the am\nwe can have\nlow dopamine and low adenosine we'll get\nto this state in a second or what we can\nhave is low dopamine and high adenosine\nokay\nand so if we kind of think about it\nwhen we block\nso this is a state where when we block\ndopamine\nand we still have adenosine remember we\nend up going for the low energy pellet\nright so when we block\nadenosine as well\nthen we end up either going for both are\nwe going for end up going for the high\nenergy pellet so you can almost think\nabout adenosine and dopamine as having\nantagonistic properties\nso adenosine will blunt the effect of\ndopamine okay so what is the dopamine\ncounter it is adenosine\nokay\nis the dopamine counter\nso you guys may wonder a little bit\nabout this\nand why this actually works\nso like let me give you guys kind of\nlike an example\nso if you guys ever like\nstudied like let's say you've got a\nfinal the next day right what time do\nyou usually start studying\nif you're like me you don't start\nstudying first thing in the morning for\nthe final the next day you procrastinate\nuntil 2 pm 4 pm you're like\naround you're like i should study i\nshould study i shouldn't study and then\nonce oh gg\nonce uh 6 pm rolls around you're kind of\nlike\nonce 6 pm rolls around you're kind of um\nyou kind of like oh man like\nlike it's somehow like easy like as as\ntime goes on you get like a little bit\nless distracted\nand like then suddenly it's like easy\nfor you to study right in the morning\nit's actually like super hard for you to\nstudy but almost as you get fatigued by\nlike towards 4 p.m 6 p.m 7 p.m it\nbecomes like easier for you to start\nstudying and then you stay up all night\nyou pound caffeine and then you kind of\nget into what i would call like the\nfatigue groove for lack of a better term\nokay\nso like the fatigue groove is like when\nyou're actually like really functional\nbut you're kind of tired and in a weird\nway you can get into this fatigue group\neasier than you can like at the start of\nthe day when it's so easy to get\ndistracted does that sort of make sense\nit's almost like games are more tempting\nat like\nnoon than they are at like 6 p.m or 7\np.m and then like you kind of get tired\nand then it's sort of like you get into\nthis weird fatigue groove and what i'd\ncall that fatigue groove is essentially\nthis this adenosine buildup throughout\nthe day so as like our day goes goes on\nand we kind of think about it this way\nso like\nlet's call dopamine green okay\nso dopamine kind of starts out high easy\nto get distracted video games and then\nlet's call adenosine yellow\nand then like you kind of start\nadenosine over here and then like this\nis sort of like\n6 p.m and this is when you start\nstudying and then you pull you study all\nnight you're kind of fatigued and then\nlike with 7 a.m rolls around your exam\nis in an hour and then you kick yourself\nright you're like man if i had started\nlike four hours earlier six hours\nearlier if i only started studying a\nlittle bit earlier i could have gotten\nso much more but it was so hard to study\nso much earlier and i think part of that\nis adenosine\nso it's interesting because what you\nknow our ability to get distracted by\nstuff\noh sh i'm sorry i couldn't see this this\nso this is dopamine this is adenosine\nand then you know so you start out with\ndopamine over here high and then over\ntime it it goes down and then with\nadenosine let's call it yellow\nand then it increases and then this is\nkind of your 6 p.m switch where you\nstart studying okay and this is also\nwhere like we can kind of think a little\nbit about night owls right so there's\nactually like there are a lot of\nsituations where we can see\npeople are actually more productive like\nlater in the day and that may have\nsomething to do with like adenosine\nproduction in the brain\nand so then the question becomes like\nwhat's the relationship between these\ntwo things\nand it's that when we're vulnerable to\nour dopaminergic activities\nearly in the day like when you feel\nexcited to play games you kind of want\nto watch stuff like it's really hard to\nwork and then once you kind of get into\nthis like fatigue groove in the middle\nof the day the dopaminergic pull\ndecreases on its own and then like\nadenosine because remember adenosine has\na blunting effect on dopamine right\nthat's what the key thing about this rat\nstudy\nis that it demonstrated how dope\nadenosine is the dopamine counter so\nadenosine is a waste product in the\nbrain and that sort of makes sense too\nbecause the more that our brain does\nthings\nthe more energy it uses up and the more\nenergy it uses up the more tired it\nfeels and the less it feels like doing\nthings\nso since adenosine is the dopamine\ncounter as the day goes on it blunts our\nability to like respond to dopamine or\nbe controlled by dopamine and then we\ncan start studying it like 6 pm after\nprocrastinating all day okay so that's\nthe first thing\nso\nthe first reason why i think you can\nsometimes get motivated is because your\nmotivation gets distracted by\ndopaminergic activities early in the day\nand then as you start to get fatigued\nlike you don't feel like you know the\ndopaminergic pull isn't there you're not\nthinking about playing games anymore\nyou're not like oh i really want to do\nthis so this would be kind of fun and so\nas you're as all of the the desires and\nthe dopaminergic controls starts to fade\ninto the background because of elevated\nlevels of adenosine then like the deeper\nmotivation can start to shine forth\nbecause it's not just this dopaminergic\ncrap anymore does that make sense\nso that's one thing that has to do with\nneuroscience so let now let's talk a\nlittle bit about future discounting\nso\nif we talk about you know what the real\nproblem is\nmotivation is a feeling and it increases\nat night right so motivation\nincreases at night\nbut now here's the question\ndoes behavior increase at night\nright so when you feel super motivated\nat night do you\nengage\nin the behavior\ninteresting right\nso when we when we kind of\nwhen we go to bed at night there's a\nreally interesting thing about\nmotivation which is that there's no\ncost motivation\nso our motivation can like increase\nunchecked it can spiral out of control\nyou're sitting there like late at night\nand you're thinking like oh tomorrow i'm\ngonna do this i'm gonna do this it's\ngonna be great it's gonna be awesome\nlike i have all of this motivation and\nin our brain there's no cost because\nyou're not giving anything up\nyou're not actually doing anything so\nit's like your motivation can like rise\nto epic proportions because there's no\ncost to the motivation there's no\nbalance to the motivation\nnow when you wake up the next morning\nwhat's the situation\nthe next am\nnow you have a choice\nmotivation\nversus video game\nso let's say that at night i think about\noh man i'm gonna write a novel\nright so this is the other thing\ncreative stuff right happens a lot at\nnight i'm gonna write a novel so now i\nhave a choice i can write a novel\nor i can play a video game\nand now suddenly there's a cost to the\nmotivation\nright so if i if i if i write a novel\nfor one hour have i written a novel no\nhave i written one percent of a novel no\nthere's no like cost benefit like\nthere's no like what have i done in an\nhour so my brain is sitting there and\nit's doing this kind of goes back to\nthis other calculation like the\nbehavioral calculation and my brain is\nsitting there in the morning and it's\nthinking like okay if i like can i write\na novel now no like can i write a novel\nin an hour no can i write a novel in two\nhours no can i write a novel in four\nhours no\nso can i actually write the novel in the\nmorning\nno\nnow can i play a game in an hour\nyup\ncan i get a little bit of that can i get\nthat dopamine can i get me a little bit\nthat dopamine please\nma'am sir thank you yes please and thank\nyou yeah absolutely easy\neasy so now when in the light of day\nwhen you actually have the opportunity\nto engage in the behavior\nthere's an opportunity cost now because\nat night there's no opportunity cost\nso your your your you know your\nmotivation can just fly through the roof\nbecause it doesn't cost you anything\nit's like free\nlike i can and then you get more\ninspired you think about how great it's\ngonna be i'm gonna have this idea i'm\ngonna have that idea like this\ncharacter's gonna do this we're gonna do\nplot twists here it's gonna be like no\none's gonna realize what's gonna happen\nit's gonna get picked up there's gonna\nbe a bidding war between netflix and hbo\nfor my awesome new novel it's gonna be\ngreat it's like twilight meets game of\nthrones it's gonna be like the most epic\nthing since harry potter it's gonna be\nso awesome there's no cost to any of it\nright and then come the light of day now\nsuddenly there's a cost like\ntwilight meets game of thrones holy crap\nthat's gonna take a lot of work like how\ndo i even do that they're gonna be\ndifferent vampire houses like what's up\nwith that how's that gonna work ah\nit's overwhelming\ni don't know how to start\nso let me just play a video game at\nleast that's easy\neasy easy let me just do this so in your\nbrain you have this behavioral\ncalculation we've talked about the doubt\nmarch endowed paper a lot right so if\nyou guys remember that paper it's also\non our discord and things like that\nthere's a behavioral calculation that in\nin the night doesn't it's like it's like\na\nan equation that only has one side of\nthe equal sign so it can the motivation\ngoes out of control because there's no\ncost but come the light of day now\nsuddenly there's a cost it's like you're\ngoing to sleep at night and you're like\nman i'm going to wake up tomorrow i'm\ngoing to work out first thing\nand then you wake up tomorrow and it's\nlike am i going to work out right now\nbecause do you work out in the middle of\nthe night like when you feel so\nmotivated to write that novel do you\nactually get up and write do you\nactually work out no you don't do any of\nthose things when the cost actually\nbecomes part of the scale so we've got\nyou know a set of scales right\nand then like the motivation is just you\nknow there's a ton of motivation over\nhere so it's easy because it's empty\nso motivation easy but now we start\nadding a cost during the day and then\nsuddenly this is gone and then our\nmotivation goes up or whatever you know\nthis wins\nand then it's gg\nokay\nso next thing to consider so there's\nlike a future discounting problem\nthere's an opportunity cost problem uh\nit's not really the future discounting\nis another one of these principles where\nlike\num our brain chooses the reason i call\nit future discounting is because our\nbrain chooses an immediate gain over an\nuncertain long-term gain\nso like i can get some immediate\nsatisfaction right now but come the\nlight of morning like i don't actually\nknow if anyone's ever going to bid war\nover this because i've been writing for\nan hour and it sucks there's no plot\ntwist like i can't\nyou know there's no\nit's not successful\nafter one hour but if i play a game it's\nlike easy done\nso now what i want to talk a little bit\nabout is almost\nwhat i would call spiritual it's not\nreally spiritual but\nit's not scientific and i think like the\nyogic folks like understood this stuff\nlike a little bit better\nand so what i'm going to talk about now\nabout why you know this is the third\nreason\nwhy motivation is higher at night is\nshower thoughts\nokay\nso if you think about shower thoughts\nlike what's so interesting about the\nshower like when you're in the shower\nyou're in this kind of like con state of\nconsciousness where you're not really\ndistracted you can't be on your phone\nyou can't really like do a whole lot\nwith your mind there's like no mental\ndistraction\nand there's some amount of physical\nroteness\nright you're just like hopefully like\nshampooing yourself cleaning your hair\nthings like that\nand and then what happens is like this\ncombination of factors leads to profound\nthinking\nand now we all let now let's look at the\nsituation we go to bed so like you know\ni i mean if you're on your bed you're\nnot gonna have i mean if you're on your\nphone in bed you're not going to have\nmotivation you guys see that if you're\nsitting there watching something or\nbrowsing something you're not going to\nfeel an ounce of motivation it's when\nyou go to bed\nit's when you put down your phone\nthere's nothing left to mentally\ndistract you so you're just sitting with\nyourself\nthere isn't necessarily like a physical\nroteness but there is sort of like a\nphysical\npull\nor grounding let's say maybe that's a\nbetter\nfeeling right and so we see a very\nanalogous situation to actually\nshowering\nand then we result in like motivation\nand thinking\nright this is the situation in bed and\nso the reason i call this kind of like\nspiritual in nature is because i think\nyoga like the yogis and stuff were the\nones that really looked at these\ndifferent states of mind and figured out\nhow do we cultivate this kind of state\nof mind\nand so what we can see is that a lot of\nthat motivation\nnaturally bubbles forth when we are free\nfrom distraction\nwhen we have no dopaminergic options at\nhand and we are being with ourself\nright so this is like a phrase that we\nuse where when you go for a walk\nin nature\nwhen you shower\nwhen you lay in bed at night\nand the interesting thing is that even\nlike technically someone else can be\nthere like you can lay in bed with your\npartner or whatever but as long as you\nguys aren't interacting the state will\ncome\nso the reason i call it spiritual is\nbecause it's about like this is the\nangle where i think about cultivating a\nparticular state of consciousness\nso if you want that kind of motivation\nto hit you in other parts of the day we\nalready figured out showering\nright so this one is like there's even\nlike shower thoughts is a thing\nwe see it when we go to bed at night but\nyou can actually cultivate these states\nby walking in nature by\ndoing away with the dopaminergic\ndistractions right because at the end of\nthe day this is going to\nincrease dopamine\nor like when you're on your phone it's\ngoing to increase open when you play\nvideo games it's going to increase\ndopamine\nand so this kind of goes back to like\nthis state over here\nwhere these meditative practices\nthis is actually the ideal state so this\nis why if you really look at people like\ni for example do my most productive work\nin the morning\nwhere if i if i spend 15 minutes on my\nphone at the beginning of my day if i\nsit down at my computer my product\nproductivity is going to be like\nat 80 percent of what it was sometimes\neven less\nthe longer i spend at my computer first\nthing in the morning the more screwed i\nam for the day\nwhereas most of my like thinking\nmy high quality thinking happens before\ni hop on the dopamine train\nso avoid the dopamine train\nokay takeaways number one avoid the\ndopamine train number two\nadenosine\ngets you off\nthe dopamine train\nso this is the fatigue groove\nbut\nthe problem with the fatigue groove is\nthat you're fatigued right it's not like\nadenosine like adenosine is a waste\nproduct so at this point like you're\nfatigued so even though you can work\nyou're not as distracted the quality of\nyour work is going to be like 60 to 80\nright and so number three\nis like what you really want to\ncultivate and this is like where kind of\nmeditation comes in is this state of\nmind so this is the fatigue groove\nthis is when we get distracted\nand then this state of mind with low\ndopamine and low adenosine when your\nmind is fresh where it's super capable\nand at the same time it's not distracted\nit's not being dopaminergic we're\ncreating space to be with ourselves\nwhere we're not on our phones we don't\nhave mental distractions and often times\nit can really help to have a physical\nroteness or a grounding activity this is\nwhy walking is really really healthy for\nyou or hiking right you can think a lot\nor awesome really deep thoughts when\nyou're going for a hike if it's not\nphysically intensive to the point where\nit's occupying your mind so if i'm rock\nclimbing for example like i'm not going\nto be thinking deep philosophical\nthoughts or creative thoughts because\nall of my mental focus is going to be on\nthe actual physical activity but that's\nthe thing is that there are some\nactivities like showering or being in\nbed or going for a walk that have a\ncertain physical grounding aspect\nthat don't demand your mental attention\nso your mind can be free\nand then you'll start to have motivation\nquestions\nso what was number three oh yeah\nseek out\nyou know\nlow dopamine\nlow adenosine states\nand these states have these components\nthat we talked about over here right\nwhich is\nno dopamine\ndistractions\nphysical grounding\nand what was this oh yeah\nlike mental space let's call it\nand the other thing that you can do is\nlike this is what we call\nbeing\nwith\nyourself\nand meditation helps a lot so like don't\nstart the first hour of the day like\ndon't use technology that's the biggest\nthing you can do\nquestions\ni personally prefer showering in the\nmorning but to each their own\noh my god so many questions hold on hold\non hold on\nokay here's here's the\nokay so big mouth fringe says what\nshould we do tldr\nso here's the thing i can tell you what\nto do but\nyou have to understand\nright so here's something to unders\nhere's something to understand\nbehavioral change does not come with\ninformation transmission\nbehavioral change comes from\nunderstanding so we see this a lot in\naddictions where like people say one day\nthey'll wake up and they'll say\nenough is enough and if you ask them how\ndid you quit alcohol they just say i\nwoke up one day and i realized enough is\nenough\nnow i could tell them every day before\nthat enough is enough you've got to stop\ndrinking and they're not going to do it\nso the first thing you should do is\nunderstand this the first thing that you\nshould do is study yourself\nthe first thing you should do is see if\nwhat i'm saying is correct\ndo you find the fatigue groove what\nhappens first thing when you wake up in\nthe morning experiment first don't worry\nabout doing because who the hell knows\nlike this may not apply to you\nexperiment first understand first\nexplore first\nsee if you can find these three things\nto cultivate this kind of like\nmotivational you know triad\nof physical grounding but not physically\ndemanding stuff free of mental\ndistraction or mental space and to be\nfree of mental distractions\nsee what happens in your day when for\nthe first hour of the day you do not\ntouch a piece of technology\nwhat happens in your mind what happens\nto your motivation\nright because at the end of the day if\nyou want to optimize performance\nyou don't need you don't want to use the\ncrutch of adenosine and the fatigue\ngroove to get stuff done that's what has\nyou operating at 70 percent\nwhat are some good books to learn all\nthis stuff and also more heavily focused\non disorders there aren't unfortunately\nthere aren't really books\nso that's why we built dr k's guide\nbecause like what i'm offering you guys\nis a synthesis of knowledge\ni will link to you however two papers\nwhich i think um for those of you who\nare interested in adenosine so there are\na couple of references there\nbut this stuff i mean this is an\namalgamation of books right this is not\njust books is the other thing is a lot\nof what i teach is not books it's like\nscientific papers\nso you can you what you have to do is\nlike read a lot of scientific papers and\nlike stitch things together\nand the part of the what we teach is\nlike you know you can get a phd in\nneuroscience you'll learn a third of\nthis lecture you can get a phd in\npsychology you'll learn a third of this\nlecture you can spend five years\nstudying in india and you'll get a third\nof this lecture\ni don't mean i just genuinely don't have\nlike it's not like this is in one book\nlike the whole point is like this is an\namalgamation of knowledge\num what if my work is on technology then\ndon't work for the first week first hour\nof the day i'm serious\njust don't work for the first hour don't\ndo your job\nright you can do your job later so spend\nthe first hour of the day cooking\ncleaning\nexercising straightening up your place\nrunning an errand\nyou know\ngood questions\nhow do twitch streamers that are\naddicted to video games become\nsuccessful then excellent question\nbecause their success\nis tied to the dopaminergic process\nso this is a fantastic question right\nso if your material success is tied to\nthe dopaminergic circuit in the nucleus\naccumbens then you can be successful and\ndo this\neasy\nthe challenge is that for most of us\nthe dopaminergic hit\ndoes not lead to material success\nso this is also where i mean they have\ntheir fair amount of suffering too okay\nso\nbut this is where if we look at like you\nknow part of the job of being a\nsuccessful twitch streamer is to spend\ntime on twitter\nspend time on youtube spend time playing\ngames these are all dopaminergic\nactivities that's why there are\nsuccessful twitch streamers because the\nworld has evolved to a point where\ndopaminergic activities can be\nfinancially rewarded video games aren't\na distraction anymore they're now a job\nand so what people have managed to do is\ngive in to their dopamine dopaminergic\ncircuits\nthey've become successful on twitch and\nthey're a mess\nthey suffer on the inside unless they\ncan learn how to set limits\nright they like they like internally\nlike they're burnt out\nbecause like they're just they're stuck\nin the dopamine loops they don't feel\nlike they're in control of their life\nall this kind of stuff\nnot even music in the morning i guess\nyou can listen to music\nhow do i reset the cycle from working\nall night what i would say is that you\nshould try to stay up\nand then like go to bed like at like 6\np.m or 7 p.m\nso in my experience if you want to\nreset your sleep schedule we've got a\nvideo about this by the way\nso if you look at the\nhuman brain insomnia and circadian\nrhythm\nas a human being is it is easier to stay\nup when you are tired than it is to go\nto sleep when you are not\nthis is the key thing to understand\nabout resetting your sleep schedule\nthere's one thing to understand it's\nthat staying up is easier than going to\nbed\nso if my circadian rhythm is all off and\ni lay down at 9 00 pm i may stay awake\nfor like four hours and then there's\nlike gg\nnothing i can do about it\nwhereas it's way easier to stay up all\nnight right like it's it's easier to go\nto stay awake 12 hours longer than when\nyou should go to bed than it is to go to\nsleep 12 hours earlier than\nyou know you should go to sleep\nso like it's really hard to wake up at 8\na.m and like go to sleep at 10 a.m\nway easier to wake up at 8 a.m and stay\nup\nuntil 10 a.m the next day\ni know i'm four pixels\ntrying to figure out why okay there\nthere we go\nokay\nso i would say try to stay up\nuntil like you know 6 p.m or 7 p.m and\nthen you're gonna be so exhausted that\nyou should have no trouble falling\nasleep or hopefully it'll be easier\nand then what will happen is you'll\nsleep for a long time and it'll be\neasier to wake up in the morning so i'd\nsay like go to sleep at like 6 p.m 7 p.m\nstay up for like 36 hours you have to be\ncareful about you know driving and stuff\ni wouldn't drive or anything like that\nso don't do anything that's dangerous\nbecause you're gonna be heavily impaired\nand then what you want to do is like set\nan alarm for like 12 hours from you know\nwhen you go to bed so like set an alarm\nfor like 6 a.m or 7 a.m you may feel\nkind of groggy and weird when you wake\nup\num\nbut then that'll be like the first step\nin the right direction and then you have\nto power through that day and then it'll\nbe easier to go to sleep at like 10 p.m\nso that's how you fix it\nsomeone's asking\nhow do i avoid the dopamine training in\nthe morning it's so hard yeah you're\nabsolutely right it is very hard\nso i think the biggest problem with the\ndopamine train is your phone\nso really think about what is your phone\nfor right what is the function of your\nphone why do we keep it with us we keep\nit with us because of emergencies what\nif there's an emergency but like the\nlikelihood of emergency is very very low\nso what i'd recommend for people who are\ntrying to avoid the dopamine train in\nthe morning is just\nkeep the devices away from you\nlike make the burden of reaching your\ndevice very hard don't sleep with your\nphone in the same room\nand it's like what if something happens\nin the middle of the night and someone\ncalls me well then like\nor if you want to i guess you can put it\nat the other end of the room\nand like keep it away from you so it's\nnot with you when you're going to bed at\nnight\nand it's not like within arms reach when\nyou wake up in the morning\nand the second thing is like just be\naware like as you wake up understand\nwhat's happening like you want to go and\nyou sit down at your computer like\nthat's what you want to do with every\nfiber of your being\nyou know it's like and be like what the\nhell is that\nlet me see how long i can sit here\nwithout going to the computer and watch\nthat struggle within yourself\nit's going to be like this serpent like\nuncoiling and like threatening you and\nit's going gonna like pressure you so\nmuch the pressure is crazy and then your\nmind is gonna find this like internal\nlike weird you're gonna trick yourself\ninto thinking it's okay to do\nyou guys see what i'm saying like you're\ngonna be like it's not that big of a\ndeal\nyour mind is gonna slippery like\ntwist this way and that to get you to\nthe computer\nif you just say to yourself like i'm not\ngonna use the computer for an hour your\nmind will go into absolute rebellion\nand it'll it'll push you it'll say\nthat's stupid\ndon't do it and when that doesn't work\nit'll be like it's not that big of a\ndeal just do it it's like like you can\nstart tomorrow like whatever you watch\nwhat your mind does it'll turn against\nyou\nin every fiber of its being and that's\nthe dopamine craving it's like the\naddict that's looking for something and\njust be like what the\nis this\nit's crazy\nthen the other thing that you can do so\nyou can struggle there but you're gonna\nfail if you struggle for too long i'd\nsay like you know brush your teeth take\na shower if you can whatever get dressed\nthen just leave the house without your\nphone go for a walk in your neighborhood\nget dressed and just walk around the\nblock 15 minutes 20 minutes\nas you're walking around the block think\nabout okay i gotta make breakfast i'll\nmake coffee like whatever go back and\nthen like lay out a very simple plan\ndon't overshoot it right don't think\nabout all the things you have to do\ntoday your goal is to make it to one\nhour\nyou're gonna make your food you're gonna\nhave your coffee then you're going to\nsit down and then then you pull out a\nto-do list okay what am i going to do\nover the next two hours don't make your\nto-do list for the day you're screwed if\nyou make a to-do list for the day you're\nscrewed do you know why\nbecause if it's too loose for the day\nyou don't have to start now\nyou can play games for a couple of hours\nyou can start like 2 p.m 4 p.m 6 pm\ndo this for the day\ndon't make it two deals for the day\njust what am i gonna do this next hour\nwhat is the next right step\nthis is a meditation practice that i do\nmyself so here's my meditation for the\nday\nit's gonna be kind of weird it's to ask\nyourself what is the next best step\nwhat is the next\nbest\nstep that's it\nask yourself this question again and\nagain and again\nwhat is the next best step\nand the reason i include next and best\nis because\nsometime i don't know if this kind of\nmakes sense\nmaybe actually what i say to myself what\nis the next best thing i can do that's\nthe that's the practice i realized i\nleft a piece out what is the next best\nthing i can do and the important thing\nabout that is it's not about what is\nobjectively best\nit is about what is the next best thing\nthat i can do\nso it acknowledges for a moment that you\ndon't have to be perfect it acknowledges\nfor a moment that you don't have to\nstart studying for your test right now\nbut if i can't start studying for my\ntests can i toss in a load of laundry\ncan i do some laundry if i can't do\nlaundry can i go for a walk okay then\nit's a second walk chat i cannot tell\nyou guys i will go for three walks\nduring the day and the reason i go for\nthree walks for during the day is\nbecause unless i go for a walk i'm gonna\nfall into gaming\nbut i can like physically i can force\nmyself\nto walk 10 feet put on my shoes and walk\nout the door and once i walk out the\ndoor the desire to game disappears\nyou guys get that like\nthe key to\nbuilding a successful like\naction throughout the day or habit is\nnot doing the whole action it's just\nboarding the train to the easy part\nbecause once it's i have never in my\nlife\ntaken two steps outside the door with my\nshoes on being dressed turned around and\nwalked back in\nin fact at that point it feels really\nawkward and difficult to do that i don't\nthink i could do it\nso sometimes what happens in our mind is\nwe think about\nwhat goal we need to meet it's not about\nthe goal all you have to do is get far\nenough to like let the train take you\nthe rest of the way you just have to\nboard the train\nit's all about which train am i boarding\nam i boarding the dota train or i'm\nboarding the walk train\nand then as you walk okay fine you\nresisted for 15 minutes\n20 minutes come back okay let's eat\nsomething so you sit down it's just like\nyou know when you walk inside once again\nit's like a battle of wills for like\nfive seconds do i go into like my my\nroom where the computer is or do i walk\ninto the kitchen that's all it takes if\ni walk into the kitchen then it's easy i\nboarded the kitchen train\nright\nand then in that way you will build up\nlike the life that you want like one\npainstaking struggle at a time\nsome days you'll win some days you'll\nlose and so it comes back to what is the\nnext best thing i can do i've played two\ni've wasted two hours playing video\ngames\ncan i resist and can i actually get up\nand go for a walk if you can't do it no\nbig deal\nso this is your meditation what is the\nnext best thing i can do\nwhat's next what do i need to do\nanything any tiny thing that is the best\nthing that i am capable of let me do\nthat thing\ngot it\ndo music or books help or hurt the\ndopamine dopaminergic system generally\nspeaking i think they're like positive\nbecause what they do is they get us away\nfrom the things that are like super\ntoxic\nright so like they get us away from\ngames and stuff\nlike so i think music can be very\ninspiring like you can use your music\nvery judiciously so i tend to use music\nvery judiciously i don't have it on all\nthe time\ni listen to music and i listen to it\nintentionally because music can put you\nin a particular mood\nso before i stream like i oftentimes\nlisten to music to get in the right mood\ni'll listen to some like pageants and\nstuff too so like like devotional music\nbecause that creates a certain move\nsometimes i'll listen to kanye because\nthat creates a certain mood you can use\nmusic to cultivate a particular mood\nso go for a walk for 15 minutes and like\nhave like a you know a nice inspiring\nplaylist\nand then like you'll get back and you'll\nkind of do it\nright\nso for people who are saying\nmy work involves a computer so here's a\nwild thing you can do this is tough\nyou can have a different computer for\nyour work in a different computer for\nyour gaming\nokay\nnow even if you have one computer so\nthis is literally what i did so for\npeople who are struggling so if you're\nlike a programmer\nand you find that like it's really hard\nokay so let me let me think about how to\nsay this\nso\na lot of taking control of your life and\ndoing the right things in the day is\navoiding getting on the dopamine\ndopamine training right the second you\npick up your phone and you open up\ntwitter or something else you've lost 15\nminutes you've lost an hour even you\nbrowse and you browse and you browse and\nthen like the sun goes down it's a gg\nthe second you sit down on your computer\nit's so easy to just open up a damn tab\nand like all these browsers are getting\nsmart they know what you like to read so\nthe second you open up a tab one click\nis all it takes and then like it shows\nyou stuff like your homepage even have\nsuggested readings for you right like\neven phones nowadays have like this this\nthing that you can't disable where if\nyou swipe in one direction it gives you\na feed and then it's gg\nso if you if you're a programmer or\nsomething your job is on your computer\nhow do you avoid\nlike falling into the trap of like the\ndopamine or your crap how do you avoid\nlogging into steam or like you know\nbooting up this video game or like\npulling up youtube or whatever\nand so the thing that i actually did so\nlike i would say you can have two\ncomputers if you can financially like\nafford that even when i was in medical\nschool i had one computer\nbut what i would what i did have is like\ntwo desks or two spaces in my desks\nso i had like two da it wasn't even like\na folding table\nand like a crappy desk so you can\nactually get that\nand what i would literally do is pick up\nmy laptop and i had like my gaming\nstation and i had my like working\nstation so my working station was a\nlarge desk where i had like books and\nstuff like that i'd stick my laptop in\nthe back\nand when i was ready to play games i\nwould literally pick up my laptop move\nto the gaming station plug in a proper\nmouse plug in my like head uh like\nheadphones or or speakers or whatever\nand then i like game at that station and\nit was it was like i'd slide my chair\nover and even that can make a big\ndifference\nso i think if your job involves your\ncomputer as best as you can try to\nseparate the two so you can separate the\nphysical spaces so that is like an\nimportant part of like habit and\nenvironment you can also create\ndifferent logins\nright you can have a professional login\nand a work login because that also\ncenters your mind and sort of anchors\nyour mind in a particular mode you have\nprofessional login and gaming login and\nyou don't log into your gaming login\nuntil you're done with your work for the\nday you like time things from like nine\nto five there are these kinds of\nbehavioral anchors that you can actually\nuse that are the opposite of exactly\nwhat these developers use to get you\nhooked\nright so like disable your feeds\nlike this is also where like you think\nabout your phone like do you use your\nphone for work maybe get a second phone\nhave one phone for work or one phone for\nyou know personal stuff if you use your\nphone for work like this is the problem\nwith having devices that do everything\nbecause the more our devices do\neverything the easier it is to slip from\none thing into another\nthis is a problem for content creators\ntoo because since they do twitter for\nprofessional reasons and they do twitter\nfor personal reasons it blends one into\nthe other\nand so you're on twitter for like six\nhours a day like having fun and\nabsorbing toxicity from like people on\nthe internet and you're screwed\nso separate things out as much as you\ncan\nthere's a set of really interesting\nexperiments that was done by um\ni forget who it is there's a set of\nthese like experiments that was done on\nrats to explore like dystopia and\novercrowding i forget who it is\ni think some sir someone so i think he's\nlike some kind of like noble in england\nor something so he did this experiment\nwhere he tried to create a rat utopia\nokay and so what he did is he created a\nspace where he gave the rats as much\nfood as they wanted as much water as\nthey wanted\nand then he just saw what happened and\nbasically like the rats like over bred\nand then like they started like\ndegenerating as a society they started\nfalling apart so they would like eat as\nmuch as they wanted to they started like\nbreeding like they were like all these\nlike terrible things happening like uh\nrat mothers would have babies and they\nwould just like abandon them in like the\nmess of rats\nokay\nand so like all kinds of like bad things\nwere happening\nthe one set of rats yeah it's calhoun\nthank you\nthe one set of rats that retained their\nsanity were the ones that could block\noff their space from the mass of rats so\nmost of the rats would like congregate\nin this like courtyard where there was\nunlimited food and it was just like a\ncesspool it's basically like the\ninternet\nand then there were like some rats that\nsort of maintained like healthy family\nstructures they engaged in good grooming\nbehaviors they also like took care of\ntheir kids and stuff and those were the\nones that essentially like found corners\nof the world and walled themselves off\nand like would go out to eat and then\nwould come back\nso even within rats there's this kind of\nidea that the ones that could maintain\nsome kind of boundary were the ones that\nwere healthy\nnow big criticism of calhoun's\nexperiments which i you know i'm falling\ninto is that people over interpreted the\nrat utopia to like human dynamics which\nis a little bit unfair\nbut i think we know from also like\ntheories of psychology and stuff that\nlike setting good boundaries like having\ngood social media hygiene having good\ntechnology hygiene having good\nrelationship hygiene\nsetting limits with your technology\nusage setting limits with your\nnarcissistic parents\nall of those things can actually be\nreally really healthy\nso learn to set limits learn to set\nboundaries use whatever tools you can to\nkind of set those boundaries\nand that's what you should do if you're\na programmer\nwhat about some some reading in the\nfirst hour is that also a no-go i would\nactually steer clear of it if you can\nso i would use the first hour of the day\nto like cook\neat shower exercise do yoga\nplan laundry some kind of should be some\nkind of cleaning activity some kind of\nexercise just try not to stimulate your\nmind at all\ndon't give it anything to distract it\ntake care of all the rote stuff you'll\nbe amazed at how much of a difference it\nmakes\nwhat if it makes me anxious i don't know\nwhat you're referring to jonathan's but\nthat's okay\nright so life cannot be the avoidance of\nanything that makes you know you can't\navoid all the things that make you\nanxious\njust not gonna work\nyou"
