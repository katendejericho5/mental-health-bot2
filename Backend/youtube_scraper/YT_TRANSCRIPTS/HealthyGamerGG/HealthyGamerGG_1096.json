    "transcript": "today\nwe are going to try to do something very\nchallenging\nso\ni'm going to teach y'all a little bit\nabout the relationship between adhd and\ndepression and i have to say this is one\nof the most\ndifficult lectures that i've had to\nprepare\nuh so that i'm going to need y'all to\nlike cut me some slack first of all so i\ndon't know if this is going to be too\nmuch or too little\nwe're going to span a lot of different\nstuff so we're going to talk about\ngenetics we're going to talk about\nneuroscience we're going to talk about\ndevelopmental psychology we're going to\ntalk about sort of the manifestation in\nthe present\nof\ndepression and adhd and like how that\nlooks so basically what i want to do\ntoday is share with you guys\nthe narrative of adhd and depression so\nwhat are the genetics what happens in\nyour brain what changes in your brain\nresult in\ncognitive changes or behavioral changes\nwithin a person\nhow do those changes within the person\naffect their development through life\nand then what does that look like in the\npresent like where do we end up once you\nhave a genetic change a neuroscientific\nchange a developmental consequence and\nthen you're kind of in the present\nand then the question is going to be\nlike sort of the next question is like\nnow that we understand how we got here\nand what our current situation is what\nwe can do about it so this is\nchallenging as an educator because like\nit's going to involve\nso many different disciplines of science\nand even like a little not so much on\nthe spirituality but like psychology and\ntherapy and things like that\nso i don't know if it's going to be too\nmuch information i don't know if y'all\nare going to be able to follow along so\nthe one thing that i need is the ability\nto redo this lecture in the future if it\nkind of implodes\num one thing that i that i've started to\nuh\nyou know really appreciate is that the\ninternet is full of like really really\nsmart and engaged people\nand so one thing that we're trying to do\nat healthy gamer which we're sort of\ncommitted to is like not dumbing things\ndown so it's my firm belief that you\nknow the better you understand the\nsituation even if it's like hard to\nunderstand the more equipped you're\ngoing to be to actually make a neg\npositive impact in your life okay\nso uh and then if we have time we'll\nwe'll touch on a couple of reddit posts\nso i'm estimating this lecture to take\nsomewhere between 30 and 45 minutes just\nso you all know um you know where it's\ngonna be quite dense and so it's\npossible it'll like end up with an hour\nespecially if we get to questions and\nthings like that\nso let's start by talking about adhd and\ndepression\nso the first thing to understand about\nadhd and depress let me do an outline so\nwe're going to talk about\nwhat we understand about genetics\nokay and this is the other thing that i\nhave to tell you guys at many points\nthroughout this lecture because this is\nscience and i'm presenting it as such\ny'all may feel like oh my god does this\nmean i'm screwed i have adhd i have\ndepression does that mean like because\nof my genetics and the genetics are so\nbad that we're screwed no you're not\nscrewed just because of anything that we\ntalk about here even though it sounds\nlike the evidence i'm going to present\nis going to be quite compelling the\nstatistics are going to be quite\nshocking and at the same time you're not\nscrewed so don't worry about it okay\nwe'll we'll i'll kind of explain why so\nwe're going to start off by looking at\ngenetics then what we're going to do\nis sort of look at how our genetics\nmanifest as particular changes in our\nbrain what are the different circuits in\nour brain that deal with adhd and\ndepression\nhow and specifically what are the\ncircuits in our brain that result in an\ninteraction between these two diseases\nokay\nonce we sort of understand the\nneuroscience of the brain of someone\nwith adhd and depression what we're\ngoing to end up with is understanding a\nset of cognitive deficits\nright so what is like the practical\nconsequence sure i'm going to be talking\nabout things like brain volume and\ndifferent circuits in the brain and\nstuff like that but practically how does\nthat translate into particular deficits\nonce we understand the deficits then\nwhat we're going to do is take a look at\ndevelopment\nso if we take someone who has these\nparticular manifested deficits\nhow does their life evolve and what kind\nof circumstances and experiences do they\nhave as a result of those deficits\nand once we understand development then\nwhat we can do is look at the present\nso now that we understand the\ndevelopmental arc what does that result\nin today like what are you dealing with\ntoday and what are the consequences of\nthe development\nokay so like in the present what are\nyour symptoms\nwhat does your life look like\nright so this is like what we're when\nwe're gonna cite research at every step\nof the way\nso if we do a cross-sectional analysis\nif you guys know what that means on\npeople with adhd and depression what do\nwe find so cross-sectional for those\nthat that don't know is like\nresearch that basically is about one\npoint in time in the present okay\nand so if we like take a snapshot of\npeople with adhd and depression what do\nwe discover about their lives in their\nsituations\nand then the next thing is that once we\nunderstand like all of these different\nthings and we understand okay what are\nthe deficits what's going on in the\nbrain what's the developmental impact\nwhat are what do you face on like in the\nhere and now\ntrying to put together a road map\nto address our problems\nso like once we understand the\ncomplexity that is like adhd and\ndepression\ncan\nall of this information essentially give\nus some kind of road map forward you all\nready for this\nis this good\nokay we'll get to we'll get to a lot of\nwhat you guys are talking about okay so\nlet's start with genetics\nwhat do we know\nabout the genetics of adhd and\ndepression\nso the first thing is that twin studies\nso there's a great paper by in 2019 by\nfarron and larson\nshow essentially a 70 concordance\nwith adhd and\ndepression so what that sort of suggests\nis that there's a very tight link\nbetween there's a genetic root that\nmanifests is both adhd and depression so\nlike twin studies are actually quite\ncompelling here that like there's\nsomething going on in the genes so if\nyou look at genes that there's a 70\nconcordance between these these two\nthings and so we'll get to how this is\nrelated and and you know how you\nmanifest as both but it does appear that\nthere's essentially like a very very\ntight genetic link\nin terms of adhd and depression now for\nthose of you that are kind of so this is\nthe first point of hopelessness okay\nthey're gonna be several points of\nhopelessness and i'm gonna try to\naddress each of them in turn\nso if i were to say that there's a high\ngenetic correlation between adhd and\ndepression what a lot of people will\nconclude is that if i've got the bad\ngenes if i you know if i got unlucky in\nthe genetic lottery basically i'm\nscrewed for life but the truth of the\nmatter is as a clinician that's\nabsolutely not the case so this is what\ni want y'all to understand about like\nthe relationship between genetics and\nhow it manifests in an individual\nso i think about genetics as a\nvulnerability or a potential and\ngenerally speaking what we understand\nfrom psychiatrists and this is clinical\nmedicine okay so this isn't like genetic\nstudies this is like looking at real\nhuman beings\nis that genetics\nplus environment\nequals illness\nso essentially what's going on is\ngenetics is sort of like your\nvulnerability\nor the probability of something going on\nand then when you combine that with\nparticular experiences\nif that formula isn't doesn't go well\nyou end up with illness okay so for\nexample some people may be genetically\npredisposed to trauma so they have like\na 50\nyou know risk of\ntrauma\nand then depending on what kind of\nexperience they have let's say they grow\nup you know in in central africa where\nthere's like a lot of you know genocide\nand other bad things\nthen that'll result in something like\nptsd\nand so there may be people with like 25\nrisk or 75 risk and so depending on like\nyou know what the other traumatic\nexperience is let's say this is like\nyou're in the holocaust\nso then you end up with ptsd\nand let's say even this person is like\nyou know\nhad a mom who never gave them like like\nno bedtime stories\nand this can result in ptsd\nso you guys see like basically genetic\ngenetics doesn't determine\nis not like it's not a destiny\nit's a vulnerability\nthat combined with a particular\nexperience can result in the\nmanifestation of an illness okay\nso like the other way that i kind of\nthink about this just to use a quick\nanalogy is i kind of think about like\nthe the genetic vulnerability as like a\nseed okay so like genetics is like a\nseed\nand then depending on what kind of soil\nyou plant the seed in and this is where\nthe experience is like the soil\ndepending on what kind of\nsoil you plant the seed and it can\nresult in a plant or not a plant right\nso if like if my soil is like concrete\nand i take this seed and i try to plant\nit in concrete it's never gonna grow so\nlike a concrete soil is sort of like\nwhat i think of as like let's say a monk\nright because they're so control of\ntheir mind they're in so such strong\ncontrol of their mind that like even\ngenetic vulnerabilities can be kind of\nlike overcome\ncompared to if i take you know even a\nseed that's not very robust and not very\nhealthy and i plant it in super fertile\nsoil like growing up in an environment\nwhere you have parents that are like\nabusive and emotionally neglectful even\nthe you know the the weakest seed when\ngrown in the most fertile soil will\nmanifest in a plant and so then people\nare saying well okay like i know what\nthe next you know point of hopelessness\nis oh i have a genetic vulnerability i\nhave a family history of like whatever\nand i grew up in an unhealthy\nenvironment does that mean that i'm\nbasically screwed and the answer is\nstill no because remember that through\nexperiences you can actually change the\nsoil right so this continues to be\nmalleable\nso even if you have genetic\nvulnerabilities to particular things by\nchanging your environment by changing\nyour relationships you can still escape\nthe destiny that negative genetics will\noffer you does that make sense chat we\nunderstand that\nso going back to adhd so there does seem\nto be in depression there does seem to\nbe a strong genetic concordance between\nadhd and depression if you drew the\nshort end of this\nthe stick or if you drew the short straw\nsorry doesn't mean you're screwed okay a\ncouple of other things to note about the\ngenetics and sort of correlation between\nbetween adhd and depression so this is\nquite alarming\nso adhd\nincreases your risk of depression by\nfive-fold\nokay so it's like an increased risk it's\ncrazy\nby fivefold so you're five if you take\na group of uh you should take a hundred\nkids\nand 50 of them have adhd and 50 of them\nhave no adhd the likelihood of\ndepression is five times higher in the\nadhd crowd compared to the non-adhd\ncrowd even more alarming is there's a\nfive times\nfive hundred percent basically\nincrease in suicidal ideation for people\nwho have adhd there's also a\n3x risk of completed suicide\nthis is staggering\nokay\nso people who have adhd are three\nthree times the increased risk of of\nactually committing suicide\nokay so there's like a lot of stuff\ngoing on here which may relate back to\ngenetics we'll talk about this stuff a\nlittle bit more later right so for\nexample we know that suicidality usually\ncompleted suicide is not like a long and\nplanned thing\nso if you there have been studies done\nwhere basically people take we examine\npeople who attempted suicide\nand for some reason or another we were\nable to save their life and then we\nasked them when did you make the\ndecision to complete to try to kill\nyourself and movies and media will\nportray suicide as like a long and\nthought out kind of thing right we'll\nsort of think like i'm going to put my\naffairs in order i'm gonna write a bunch\nof notes and i'm gonna do all this stuff\nand i'm gonna order the favorite thing\nfor like i'm gonna order\npresents for the next five christmases\nfor my kids because i won't be around to\norder them right so people like there's\nthis idea that we put our affairs in\norder but somewhere between 60 and 80 of\npeople\nthe decision to try to kill yourself\nhappens within five minutes of the\nattempt so it's a very impulsive\ndecision and so if we look at adhd adhd\nwe know increases your impulsivity we'll\nget to that in a second and so we can\nsee how if you have a brain that is more\nlikely to be vulnerable to impulsive\ndecisions you will actually increase\nyour risk of suicide\ndoes that make sense so we'll kind of go\ninto this more\nso this is kind of a quick result of um\nyou know looking at sort of genetics and\nthe\nwhat are what are sort of the\nepidemiologic factors what are the risk\nfactors and what can we sort of expect\nabout the connection between adhd and\ndepression from a statistical level the\nother interesting thing about this is\nthat\ntreatment\nof adhd\nreduces depression symptoms\nby 20\nso it appears that treating adhd\nactually has a therapeutic impact on\ndepression so once again what we're\nseeing here through the twin studies\nthrough this stuff and through this\nstuff\nis that these are not two separate\ndiseases\nthat both some people are afflicted\nright this is the main point that i'm\ntrying to make this is what you need to\nunderstand is that we may classify adhd\nand depression as completely separate\nillnesses but when i work with people as\na clinician and when we look at sort of\nthe science and the statistics around it\nwhat it seems is that there's a common\nprocess that manifests as both adhd and\ndepression so it's not like really two\nseparate diseases it's like there's some\nsort of common root that manifests in it\nwith these two constructs that are sort\nof societally made okay\nso now let's look at okay so let's say\nthat i have you know these genetic\nchanges\nokay so i've got a set of particular\nalleles that make me\npredisposed to\ndepression and adhd so let's try to\nunderstand what's going on in the brain\nof people who are who have this genetic\nvulnerability so we're going to talk\nabout a couple of different circuits of\nthe brain okay so this is like my\nterrible drawing of a brain so here's a\nbrain okay\nso over here we have\nthe amygdala\nokay\nso this is kind of interesting\nso the amygdala\nis responsible for the experience of\nnegative emotions\nit's also our survival center of the\nbrain\nso this is where we experience things\nlike fear and and sort of anxiety and\nthings like that okay\nwe also have uh like the insula which is\nkind of around here\nwhich is also relates to negative\nemotions\nso a lot of our emotional circuitry is\nkind of in this central part of the\nbrain okay\nthere are a couple other other\nsort of things that i want to talk about\nthis is\nthe nucleus accumbens so this is a major\npart of reward circuitry\nso the nucleus accumbens is a\ndopaminergic\narea of the brain\nuh brain which means that it's like\ninfla like it sort of governs behavior\nand reward it's probably actually a\nlittle bit close more to the right which\ni guess i can fix later\nand then there are going to be a couple\nof other parts of the brain that we're\ngoing to talk about one is the\norbitofrontal cortex or ofc\nso this involves the regulation of\nemotion\nokay so like what i mean by this is i\ndon't know if you guys have had this\nexperience but like sometimes we get\nemotional and we can logically try to\ntalk ourselves out of it right we can\nsort of like use logic or control\ncircuits of the brain these are our\nemotional impulses\nover here\nokay\nso these over here are emotional\nimpulses\nand this is where our control comes from\nif that sort of makes sense okay and\nthis is where if we look at this if we\nlook at this thing over here this is\nwhere we sort of get the nucleus\naccumbens will govern a lot of our\nbehavior so we'll kind of get to that in\na second okay\nthe other thing um\nthe other part of the brain that we're\ngoing to kind of talk about is the\ndorsolateral\npfc\nokay and this also has to do the motion\nregulation\nor emotional control i would say as\nopposed to regulation we'll talk a\nlittle bit about how those are different\nokay\nand then the other thing that's kind of\nimportant is that like there are\nconnections between these these parts of\nthe brain and those are important too so\nlike we're going to talk about the\nanterior cingulate cortex\nokay so this mediates\ntalk\nbetween\nour\nemotions\nand\nlet me uh our\ni don't know control functions\nokay you guys with the neuroscience so\nlike basically there's this thing called\nthe acc which is here\nwhich basically is the circuit that\nallows these two guys\nto talk to these folks over here\nso this is sort of a basic we'll kind of\ntalk about you know what what the\nchanges are in a second\nso this is what we see in people who\nhave adhd the first thing is that\nthe volume we have the volume\nof amygdala\nand insula\nis smaller than controls\nokay so what this means is like these\nparts of our brain are actually smaller\nthere's like a decreased volume so they\nhave small\nemotional circuits\nokay now this is kind of interesting\nbecause some people may hypothesize they\nmay say well if our like emotional parts\nof our brain are like smaller doesn't\nthat mean we experience less emotion and\nit turns out that the opposite is true\nthat if you look at\num that how can i say this\nthat uh volume\nof amygdala\nis inversely correlated\nwith depression\nso the smaller your amygdala is the more\nlikely you are to experience depression\nfor people who have large emotional\ncircuits just based on raw brain volume\nthey are actually less likely to\nexperience depression\nokay\nnow the next thing that's important to\nunderstand is so this is so you guys get\nthis you all got that\nso what that basically means is that\nlike small amygdala and insula which is\nwhat we see in adhd\nresults in a greater vulnerability to\nthe experience of depression the second\nthing that's really really interesting\nis that the nucleus accumbens of people\nwith adhd is different and the main\nthing that's different about the nucleus\naccumbens is that our emotional\ncircuitry\nhas a large positive effect\non our nucleus accumbens so what does\nthat mean so this means that people with\nadhd\nthe influence of their emotions on their\nbehavior\nis\nstronger\nthan the influence of emotions on\nbehavior in a normal brain\nokay so what that means is that people\nwith adhd\ntheir behaviors\nare vulnerable\nto motion\nokay do y'all does that make sense\nso so generally speaking our nucleus\naccumbens like gets all kinds of\ndifferent like projections right so what\nwill happen is like there will be an\ninfluence from our emotions there will\nbe an influence from our frontal lobes\nthere may be even like influences from\nlike you know let's say our linguistic\ncortex not sorry not linguistic lingual\ngustatory that's the word i'm looking\nfor\nso this is our ability to taste for\nexample like that can have influences on\nlike reward and behavior right so we get\nall kinds of like stuff that goes into\nthe nucleus accumbens and basically like\nour brain has this constant calculation\nof like should i do this behavior is\nthis rewarding or not rewarding and so\nlike you can have things like taste\nright like your cortices are like oh i\nshouldn't eat that because i'm trying to\nlose weight and then like your amygdala\nis like i've had a bad day you know i\njust went through a breakup screw it\nwe're just gonna eat a tub of ice cream\nso that's like literally like the\nexperience of a human being can be\nmapped onto the nucleus accumbens in the\nway that these different parts of the\nbrain sort of interact with them\nso when we look at the brain of someone\nwith adhd the amygdala and insula are\ngoing to have stronger impacts on the\nnucleus accumbens which may also so if\nwe kind of look at like what is the you\nknow what is the result of that what\nthis means if we take like amygdala\nand then plus nucleus accumbens in the\nbrain of adhd what we get is impulsive\nbehavior\nand emotional behavior\nyou guys see that like how the more i'm\ni'm controlled by actually let me put it\nthis way the more i'm controlled by my\nmy emotions\nthe more impulsive i'm gonna seem\nmy behaviors will be more impulsive do\nyou all get that so we can kind of see\nthat the that the phenotype or the\nmanifestation of adhd\nof impulsivity\njesus\nmay come from this neuroscientific\ninteraction so now we're going to get to\nthis in a second but we can see how the\nsymptoms of adhd are the experience of\nsomeone with adhd their impulsivity\nwhich is not like a neuroscientific\nthing there's no like impulsivity\ncircuit of the brain i mean there may be\na circuit but impulsivity can't be\nmapped to a neuroscientific structure\nwhat we can map to a neuroscientific\nstructure is the integration of all\nthese different things to the nucleus\naccumbens and based on the way that\nthose circuits integrate into the\nnucleus accumbens we can have impulsive\nbehavior or we can have non-impulsive\nbehavior\nanother example of that is that when we\nhave a very strong frontal\ncontrol of our nucleus accumbens we will\nresult in less impulsive behavior okay\nso now we can see that like you know we\ncan sort of start to see where\nimpulsivity and especially emotional\ndecision making\nkind of with people with adhd come from\nokay\nthe next thing that we're going to talk\nabout is in adhd unfortunately there\nappears to be\na weak connection\nover here\nokay\nthere's a weak connection over here and\nso like this the anterior cingulate\ncortex and people with adhd is weak\nand so what that means is that the\nability for our cortical brain which is\nlike emotional control regulation of\nemotion and most importantly this\ncircuit that allows the connection\nbetween our control circuits and our\nemotional circuits seems to be weak and\nso since it's weak our ability to kind\nof regulate our emotions or put the\nbrakes on emotions seems to be negative\nand negatively impacted so these are the\nfunctions that we call top down control\nso this is deficient\nin people who have adhd\nwhat top down control means is like you\nknow like you can have impulses within\nyou so i have like an impulse right\nwhich i don't really control it's just\nan impulse and then there's like my\nbrain over here which is kind of\nsuppressing it it's like oh man i really\nwant to eat french fries and then my\nbrain is like no no we're not going to\neat french fries we're going to eat a\nsalad so that top down control comes\nfrom the frontal lobes\nand this part appears to be deficient in\nadhd so this is this can also result in\nimpulsivity you guys see that so now\nso this is kind of like a quick summary\nokay so let's let's go over it from the\ntop\nand then we'll we're sort of setting\nourselves up to understand the\nneuroscience and how this will manifest\nis symptoms of adhd so the first thing\nto understand\nis that\num let's pick\npurple\nokay\nso the first thing is that the brain\nvolume of the amygdala and the insulin\npeople with adhd is small\nwhat this sort of results in is\nessentially like\nour ability to\nhow can i say this so we know that that\nthese regions of the brain being small\ncorrelate\nwith\nworse depression\nokay so let's just accept that let's not\ntry to understand how that works for a\nsecond\nthe second thing is that we have our\ncontrol circuits of the brain which seem\nto be less connected\nto emotions\nso what that means is our ability to put\nthe brakes on our emotions has gone down\nso this is also mediated through the acc\nand lastly we have the nucleus accumbens\nwhich essentially determines\nwhat we do\nand what we see in the nucleus accumbens\nof people with adhd is that it's very\nsensitive to emotions\nand less sensitive\nto\ntop\ndown\ncontrol\ny'all with me\nright so the experience of emotions\ninfluences your behavior your ability to\nput\nthe brakes on that is harder and then\nthis is the key thing about reward\ncircuitry what that means is that like\nin your brain\ni know it sounds kind of weird but it's\nnot conscious but you are\nthere is greater reinforcement\nfrom emotional decisions i know it\nsounds kind of bizarre but like what\nthat means if we kind of think about\nlike being like in the the behavioral\nreinforcement the dopaminergic circuit\nthat actually drives your behavior and\ncreates your motivation\nall of your motivational hard wiring in\nyour brain all of your motivation in\nyour brain that gets hardwired is going\nto be more shaped by like emotional\ndecisions\nso it's kind of really challenging okay\nso now what we're going to do\nis get to the deficits\nso this is what happened\nso researchers\nlooked\ndid a bunch of studies and essentially\nwhat they did is they looked at okay\nwhat are the factors\nin um\nadhd so if we take a group of people\nwith adhd and depression\nwhat are the factors that we can sort of\nconclude correlate with these two things\nright so what this essentially do is\nthey take a group of people with adhd\nand depression they take a group of\nnormal people and they explore okay what\nis the impact of having adhd and\ndepression so this is essentially what\nthey discovered\nso the first thing is that there is\nemotional\nregulation deficits\nand i know this may seem common sense at\nthis point or like duh right didn't we\njust explain that but i want you all to\nunderstand these are different kinds of\nstudies right so this is like these are\nbrain scans where they're just scanning\npeople's brain and they don't know\nanything about the people's symptoms or\ntheir experiences of life\nand these are like looking like asking\npeople questions about okay are you\ndepressed why are you depressed and then\nthey track that down to their individual\nexperience so this is like individual\nexperiences\nand this is like brain scans\nright so these are different kinds of\ndata so we're trying to weave them\ntogether now hopefully at this point you\nguys are saying well doug this is\nobvious and that's the whole point of\nthe lecture is to try to integrate these\ndifferent kinds of research so we can\nget a better understanding the second\nthing is\npeople with adhd and depression are more\nirritable and irritability is its own\nbiological and neuroscientific\nthing okay\nwe'll talk about what emotional\ndysregulation means let me actually see\nso so actually let's let's define\nemotional regulation right now so it is\nthe ability\nto\n[Music]\nidentify\nand modify\nget ready to get wrecked chat\num\nemotional\nstates\nthat\npromote\nadaptive\nand goal\ndirected\nbehavior\nokay\nright so this is kind of damning for a\nlot of us\nso this is a quick side note so in our\ncoaching program we've had somewhere\nbetween five and six thousand people\nmaybe seven thousand now and so we're\ndoing a massive study on our coaching\nprogram and what we find in our coaching\nprogram is that we see a 20 to 40\npercent reduction in depression or\nanxiety despite the fact that our\ncoaching program is not treatment for\ndepression or anxiety so how is it that\ncoaching can actually improve symptoms\nthat we're not trying to improve at all\nwe're not qualified we're not trained\nwe're not mental health professionals\nso it turns out that our running\nhypothesis which we're actually studying\nright now is that we believe that\ncoaching actually improves eq or\nemotional quotient\nit improves our emotional regulation it\nimproves our ability to identify and\nmodify emotional states that promote\nadaptive and goal-directed behavior\nthat's what coaching is about it's about\ngoal-directed behavior and sort of\ntaking what you are on the inside and\nsort of like\nadapting it shaping it so that it it\nresults in like motivation and goal\ndirected behavior\nso anyway that's what emotional\nregulation is\nso the other things that they found was\nthat um\npeople with adhd and depression have\ndiscordant\nrelationships\nso there's discord\nwithin the relationships\nthey found peer victimization\nit's a fancy way of saying bullying\nand then they found\nacademic hardship\nokay so when we look at like people with\nadhd and depression what we essentially\nfind is like people are trying to figure\nout okay like what are the common\nelements\nwhat is the tie between adhd and\ndepression and these are the five things\nthat they found they found that people\nwith adhd and depression have poor\nemotional regulation they're highly\nirritable and what we can actually see\nis that there are a couple of other\nthings\nand that we find discordant\nrelationships peer victimization like\nbullying and like academic hardship\nso let's try to understand this a little\nbit better okay\nso how can adhd and depression result in\nin these things\nright so let's try to link our\nneuroscience to these things\nand then how can these in turn lead to\ndepression down the road so now there's\na really interesting point of of\nresearch here okay\nso this point of research is that adhd\ni forget exactly leads to like 50 to 70\npercent\ndepression\nbut\ndepression leads to 2.7\nof adhd\nso what does this mean\nthis means when you take a young child\nwith adhd\nwhen they grow up to be an adult\nthere's like a 50 chance they're gonna\nhave depression\nbut if you take a young child with\ndepression there's a 2.7 percent chance\nthat they're going to have adhd\nokay so what it actually means is that\nadhd\nappears to be a causal factor for adult\ndepression\nbut depression does not appear to be a\ncausal factor for adhd so this is a\nreally really important\nuh point to understand what this means\nis that this\nif everything was purely genetic\nokay and if everything was just like in\nthe brain\nthen these numbers should be the same\nbut what this suggests is that there's a\ncogniti i mean sorry a developmental\ncomponent here that growing up with adhd\nleads to depression and this is really\nimportant for us because this is a point\nof hope\nif this was just pure genetics and these\nnumbers were exactly the same\nforget about the fact that they're like\nso far apart right like 50 versus three\npercent that's a huge difference what\nthis means is that there's something\nhere that we can actually intervene on\nyou guys get\nthis okay so now let's try to understand\nhow does adhd early in life result in\ndepression later in life so remember\nthat what we've if we kind of look at\nadhd we have impulsivity\ninattention\nokay\num\nirritability\ndopamine reward sensitive sensitivity\nand\nyeah poor emotional regulation\nthe other thing that we sort of know is\nthat people with adhd their frontal\nlobes\nmature more slowly\nso what that means is like their\nmaturity is going to be less than people\nof their age\nso let's kind of just think about this\nconstellation of symptoms and what\ngrowing up as this person\nlooks like or feels like okay\nso the first thing is like let's talk\nabout you know so now what i'm gonna\nactually do is i didn't do a great job\nof this so let me actually\nthink about doing it this way okay what\nwe're gonna do\nwe're gonna take these things\nokay i'm gonna move them over here\num\nno\nscrewed gg\nokay let's just let's take a look at\nthese three\nnow what we're gonna do\nis take\nthese\nokay\nand we're gonna see we're gonna play a\nlittle game chat\nso these are the things that we know\nfrom\nyou know studies\ncontribute to the depression that people\nwith adhd have so now let's play a\nsimple game chat\nlet's see if these match up right so\nlet's say i'm impulsive do you think\nthat will\nimpact\nhow do you think that'll affect my\nrelationships am i more likely to have a\ndiscordant relationship if i'm impulsive\nright absolutely\ndo you think i will mor if my\nirritability do you think that will\nnegatively impact my relationships\nabsolutely do you think my inability to\nattend the situations\nwill negatively impact my relationships\nabsolutely\nso now we begin to see that okay if if\ndepression\nand adhd is connected through discordant\nrelationships\nwe can see how these three factors\nwill result in\ndiscordant relationships right so like i\nwant you guys to put yourselves in the\nshoes of like a 13 year old with adhd so\nlet's say i'm like hanging out with my\nfriends\nand then like they're all talking about\nsomething and then like my attention\nwanders i don't participate in the\nconversation so then like you know i'm\njust kind of sitting there and then i'm\nimpulsive so i randomly start talking\nabout like zebras\nand if zebras if there was a cheese\nnamed zebra cheese what kind of stripes\nwould it have would it be two kinds of\ncheeses blended together\nand then all my friends like look at me\nlike i'm a weirdo because like i'm not\nable to attend to the conversation plus\nimpulsivity and then what ends up\nhappening so there are studies that show\nthat basically people with adhd\nget\num don't participate in\nconversations\nin sort of a healthy way\nthey don't get invited\nto social things\namongst all kinds of other stuff right\nso we can see that like\nand let's not let's not forget about\nirritability like the fact that my brain\nis more sensitive to being irritable and\nhaving a low frustration tolerance makes\nit hard for me to participate in\nrelationships\nokay\nnow let's think about\nbullying\nso let's see\nwhat do you guys think do you think that\nimpulsivity makes me more likely to be\nbullied like absolutely right and why is\nthat it's because of this\nso if my social standing in the school\nis low because of these kinds of things\nthat's going to result in me being\nbullied so if you talk to people who\nhave adhd\nwhat you discover is they got bullied\nunless you guys know this chat unless\nthey were a class clown\nso like what people with adhd\nessentially learn how to do is like the\nonly way i can gain social standing is\nwith my inattentiveness and my\nimpulsivity if i can make other kids\nlaugh i'm not going to be like bullied\nbut otherwise their low social standing\ntheir inability to pay attention makes\nthem like get made fun of even more\nright the fact that they're irritable\nmeans like you can get a rise out of a\nan adhd kid and since i don't have adhd\nand i've got friends i've got three or\nfour of my friends and i'm gonna like\nsurround the the kid with adhd and i'm\ngonna bully him he's gonna get pissed\nand he's gonna throw a punch but the\nodds are stacked in my favor so he's\nscrewed\nright because he's not gonna control\nhimself and that's why i'm gonna pick on\nhim\nif i'm a bully because i know i can get\na rise out of\nhim okay\nnow let's think about academic hardship\nso\nimpulsivity does that lead to academic\nhardship yes\ninattention does that lead to academic\npartnership yes yes yes\nokay once again the problem here is that\noftentimes adhd is under diagnosed in\nchildren\nit is bizarre because because it is the\ndisease that is the most under diagnosed\ndisease and the\nthe most under diagnosed and the most\nover diagnosed disease in my experience\nwhat that means is that a high number of\npeople without adhd get diagnosed with\nadhd because they want adderall and\nthey're bored at school so they like\nhave trouble with attention and someone\ngives them pills and it is the most\nunderdiagnosed because a lot of times\npeople will miss diagnoses of adhd and\nbecause kids are smart so the smarter\nyou are the more you can set up\ncompensatory mechanisms and no one ever\nrealizes you have adhd\nand does irritability lead to academic\nhardship\nprobably but i think this is a slightly\nless of a thing\nokay so now let's think about so you\nguys with me so like we can sort of see\nit's kind of interesting because we can\nsee that\nthe the factors that studies show us\nshow are correlated and serve as the\nlink between adhd and depression\ncan absolutely be attributed to a\ndevelopmental process because the child\nis here\nand then as the child grows without\nthese being addressed we end up with an\nadult\nwho grew up with these experiences and\nso now we can see how adhd in childhood\nresults in adult depression\nyou all see that so this perfectly\nmirrors what the research tells us\nwhich is that if you're going this way\nthere's a 50 chance\nand if you're going this way if you\nstart with depression you've got a 2.7\nchance\nyou all get that\nokay\nso it does appear that there's a causal\nlink so the cool thing is that if we can\nfix these in childhood\nnot just in childhood\nbut even in adulthood\nwhat that means is that these things\nshould get better\nso as we become professionally more\nsuccessful as we engage in healthier\nrelationships because these problems are\nnot just developmental right because if\nyou're still inattentive and impulsive\nlike it's going to be harder to engage\nin relationships\nyou may still be a social outcast in\nthis day and age the cool thing is that\nthis is not set in stone so if we fix\nthis even in adulthood our relationships\nwill improve and and we'll see\ndownstream effects\nso now we get to\nthe present\nso this is sort of our development\nright and so now we're up to bullet\npoint\nfive\nokay\nand we're going to talk a little bit\nabout\nwhat this stuff results in so there are\nfurther studies that sort of look at\nthings like emotional regulation and the\nemotions of people with adhd these are\nthe cross-sectional studies\nso these studies or this conclusion that\ni'm drawing is developmental so this is\nlooking at the lifespan of children as\nthey become adults now if we take a\ngroup of adults and we just kind of like\nlook at them in this point in time and\nwe try to figure out what is your\nexperience of life in this moment with\nadhd and depression this is what we\ndiscover\num that the link between emotion adhd\nand depression is primarily due to\nloneliness\nprimarily due to emotional regula\nrelation deficits\nand shame so this is i'm tacking this on\nthere's not i didn't find a single paper\nabout that i'm sure it's out there but\nthis is just what i've seen\nso when we're talking about you know\nwhat it's like to sit with someone who\nhas adhd and depression these are the\nthree primary experiences which lead to\ndepression in the present\nokay now let's try to understand where\ndo these come from so loneliness is kind\nof a no-brainer right we know that\ndiscordant relationships and bullying\nlike that's going to lead to loneliness\nand by the way if we also look at\ncorrelations between suicidality you\nguys remember our 3x risk\nof suicide\nvery very highly correlated with\nloneliness if we look at people who\nactually attempt suicide and commit\nsuicide they're very lonely so now we\ncan even see where the big scale\nepidemiologic data comes from because\nthese are psychiatric studies so this is\nlooking at the treatment of illness in\nactual patients\nlike humans okay\nwe can see that loneliness comes from a\ncombination of like discordant\nrelationships bullying and academic\nhardship because you're not good at\nschool so you don't feel like you're\ndoing a good job\nsimilarly\nbullying and academic hardship will also\ncontribute to shame right so like this\nis the experience of someone with adhd\nso we're going to talk about this for a\nsecond so if i've got adhd\ni grow up and what do people tell me oh\noh look you're so smart\nyou just need to try harder i don't know\nwhy you just can't be more disciplined\nlike i don't know\nwhy you are failing so miserably because\nyou are so smart because iq and adhd are\nnot correlated\nright and so when a child gets told that\nand like a child understands so the\nthing that's even more shameful is not\neven how what the child is told because\ni've had lots of patients with adhd that\nhave very supportive parents and they're\ntrying to be supportive right when they\nsay oh you have so much potential\nthey're trying to be supportive\nbut what the actual experience is the\nkid\nknows\nthey look around and they see everyone\nelse in their class and they can sort of\ntell they're like i can do math just as\nwell as the kids around me like i\nunderstand mathematics i'm a smart kid\nthey look around at all these other\npeople who are just able to sit down and\nstudy\nand like i know that if i get engaged\nand i pay attention i can learn history\ni can learn mathematics i should be able\nto understand this stuff just as quickly\nas everyone else or in fact that's what\nthey discover is that when they're\npresented with new information that's\ninteresting they actually potentially\neven learn faster than their classmates\nbut despite all of these observations\nthat they're just as capable as their\nclassmates they just can't sit down and\nread a book and so then they feel like\nidiots they're like there's something\nfundamentally busted in me and oddly\nenough the higher their iq is the more\nshame they're likely to feel that's sort\nof a clinical observation there's some\nevidence of that as well there's this\nthing called the insight trial\nwhich sort of showed that the greater\ninsight you have into a particular\nproblem in this case it was a\ndegenerative neurological disease\nthe greater your suicidality is\nso like it's kind of bizarre and this is\nwhat's super sad about working with a\nlot of my patients with adhd is the\nsmarter they are the more aware that\nthey are that they are of like how\nscrewed they are if that sort of makes\nsense\nand if you're like stupid and you kind\nof don't realize there's a problem it's\nsort of like ignorance is bliss\nbut bizarrely the most shame is felt\nby the the students who are actually the\nsmartest and the most aware\nso when we have loneliness and shame\nthat's going to kind of result in\ndepression\nand then we're also going to have\nemotional regulation deficits right and\nthis kind of goes back to our\nneuroscience our amygdala insula our\nanterior cingulate cortex and all that\nkind of stuff\nso there's some interesting stuff that\nwe can further explore here so you know\nif we're kind of thinking about you know\nwhat our process is\nfor fixing this\nwe're gonna tunnel down just a little\nbit\nfurther and i'm going to kind of dive\ninto\nemotional regulation\nbecause\nwe talk a lot on on stream about\nloneliness and shame but a lot of people\nhave questions about okay so like if\nthere's an emotional regulation deficit\nlike what does that mean what do i do\nabout it right if if i'm unable to\nidentify and modify my internal\nemotional states\nto\nbe become adapt uh to adapt and to\ndirect uh and to engage in goal-directed\nbehavior like what what do i do about\nthat that sounds like devastating right\nthat sounds like my problem in a\nnutshell is that i can't modify my\ninternal emotional state to like do what\ni need to do\ni know what i need to do i just can't\nbring myself to do it that's another way\nto put it\nso further the researchers went tunnel\ndown even further and started to look at\nemotional regulation and realize that\nthere are three strategies\nthat\num people with just in general human\nbeings but especially the people with\nadhd will employ to regulate their\nemotions\nso the first is avoidance\nso what this means is that that we're\ngoing to\nalter our exposure\nto\ninternally\nchallenging\nexperiences\nokay so altering our exposure can be\nexternal\nin a sense or internal\ni don't like this nomenclature great but\nit's the best example i have so an\nexample of an you know an avoidance\nthat's external is like i'm afraid that\ni'm gonna look stupid at the party so\ni'm not gonna go to the party\nbecause i'm afraid i'm gonna look stupid\nso what they essentially do is they just\navoid the situation entirely okay\nthere are also cognitive behavioral\navoidance strategies as well\nokay so you may ask like what does that\nmean a cognitive behavioral avoidance\nstrategy\nso this is like where they actually\nreduce\nor downplay\nthe internal\nseverity\nso this is kind of interesting but it's\nsort of like mentally checking out is\nwhat i call it\nright so this is like when you you like\nmentally like you kind of avoid\nsomething in your mind it's like if i go\nto a party and i tell myself\num you know i don't i i don't even like\nthese people\nso it's like it's okay if i'm awkward i\ndon't care about these people anyway\nyou mentally sort of avoid in your mind\nlike you use a cognitive avoidance\nstrategy to insulate yourself from some\nkind of internally challenging\nexperience it's protective in nature\nright because if i if i devalue the\nother person in my mind\ni don't actually have to feel rejected\nat all\ndo you guys get that so i can avoid\ngoing to the party or in my head i can\nmentally check out from the party when\ni'm there\nnow this gets a little bit subtle\nbecause there are other emotional\nregulation strategies so the next is\nsuppression\nso suppression's a little bit different\nbecause the emotion is there\nbut i'm gonna squash it down\nso you may say\nisn't that avoidance and i'd say no this\nis sort of fake it till you make it\nand if we kind of look at like what's\nthe difference between someone who\nsuppresses emotion and someone who's\navoidant is like the person who\nsuppresses the emotion is still gonna go\nto the party\nright they're just gonna take all their\nanxiety and they're gonna shove it way\ndown and they're gonna smile they're\ngonna put on a face and they're gonna\npretend to have a good time they're not\nmentally checked out they're not like\nafk in their head and being like screw\nall these guys right what they're\nactually doing is like there's like an\ninternal struggle\nbut there is also an internal\ngenuineness\nor authenticity which they're fighting\nagainst does this make sense\nit's very different actually on the\ninside it is very very different\nbecause the the thing the emotion is\nthere we're not avoiding the emotion\nwe're just trying to conquer it and\nfight it\nand then the third strategy is\nreappraisal\nso this is where like we have cognitive\nreframes\nright so this is like where we do some\nlike heavy cognitive work this is like\nwhat things like therapy will hopefully\nhelp you do\nwhere you start to like work on things\nand you take that negative emotion and\nthen like you do like once you sort of\nhave develop some kind of understanding\nof for example if i go to the party and\ni'm anxious\ni can sort of cognitive reframe and sort\nof realize oh like everyone else is just\nas anxious about what they're wearing as\ni am about what i'm wearing no one is\nreally paying attention to what i'm\nwearing so i might as well just try to\nhave a good time if some people end up\nnot liking what i'm wearing maybe\nthey'll make fun of me but i'm pretty\nwitty so i can just make fun of them\nit's like not that big of a deal that's\nan example of a cognitive reframe it's\nkind of like processing stuff\nright working through it\netc and what we find in people with adhd\nis that they so let's say normal human\nbeings\nlet's call normal people blue okay\nso if we have normal people\nthey'll do like a third\na third\na third\npeople with adhd will do like nine\ntenths\nmaybe one tenth\nzero tenths maybe it's a bit brutal\nokay and then you have people who are\nlike monks\nright so monks like in the there's this\nthere's a scale so like\nafter you've got guns gotten someone\nwho's like you know done a lot of\ninternal work or as a monk\nthey'll do like 1 out of 10 avoidance\nmaybe 4 out of 10 suppression and 5 out\nof 10 reappraisal\nand at some point you've got you know\nthe\ni don't know like whatever i mean so so\nover time like i think\nyou can kind of move in this direction\nas you do like more emotional work\nokay and like super high eq will be like\nnine tens of reappraisal\nif that makes sense\nso we can kind of see that all humans\nwill use all of these strategies but\nthere's evidence\nthat people with adhd employ avoidance\nthe most and that avoidance is probably\nthe most damaging\nright so mentally checking out is a big\nproblem in our community\nwhat's less of a problem but is still a\nproblem is like internal struggle or\ninternal conflict and this is sort of\nlike mental piece\nso these are three different strategies\nthat we can sort of employ for emotional\nregulation\nokay\nso i know it sounds kind of weird but if\nyou're someone who's got adhd\nwhat you probably want to do is move\nfrom avoidance to suppression first and\nthen eventually move towards reappraisal\nbut it's okay to like feel bad and kind\nof force yourself through it and that's\nwhy people will say like fake it till\nyou make it right it's not mentally\nchecking out it's like acknowledging\nthat you feel bad and then forcing\nyourself to do something\nso\nnow we move on to the last step\nokay so just to kind of cover what we've\ncovered we started with genetics we\nstarted with epidemiology what are the\nstatistics around adhd and depression\nthen we talked a little bit about\ndifferent structures of the brain and\nhow if we look at like i do mri scans or\nbrain scans of people with like adhd and\ndepression what do we discover about\ntheir brain and how is it different\nonce we understand understood the\nneuroscientific deficits we went on to\nlook at you know what does that manifest\nas what does that look like in someone's\nlife so what are the the vulnerabilities\nor what are the psychological\ndisadvantages that they have\nthen we sort of looked at how being born\nor growing up with those disadvantages\naffects your development\nand how that sort of results in\ndepression later in life\nthen we looked at in the present\nyou know what what does it look like if\nyou're someone who's had adhd and\ndepression\nwhat does it look like in the present to\nbe in your situation and then the last\nthing that we're going to look at now is\na road map\nokay\nso now everyone's wondering\nwhat do i do about this how do i fix\nthis\nand the short answer is like there's a\nlot to do and you know you're not going\nto get an answer in the next five\nminutes of how to transform your life\nbut this is what i will say so the first\nthing that i want you all to appreciate\nnow i'm going to talk purely from a\nclinical perspective\nso now i'm going to talk about like as a\nhuman being who is a psychiatrist who\nworks with people with adhd and\ndepression here is what i've learned\nabout what works for them\nthe first is that\nthere is a diagnostic\num\non there's a diagnostic lack\nof sophistication\nso what i mean by that is if we kind of\nlook at all of these scales of problems\nright like we can we can take a look at\nall of the things we've discussed so is\nyour problem one of like\nreward circuitry\nis your problem one of you know orbital\nfrontal\ncontrol\nis your problem one where your amygdala\nis too hyperactive\nor is your problem more downstream right\nis your problem something more like\num you know emotional regulation\nsorry\nand then furthermore we can like tunnel\ndown right is it suppression\navoidance\nor reappraisal which strategy do you use\nis your problem irritability\nor is is your problem developmental in\nnature is the problem that you have a\nbunch of shame is the problem that\nyou're lonely\nright is the problem the way that you\ninteract with people\nso discordant relationships\nis your problem that you are still\nbullied\neither by people at work or things like\nthat is your problem that you lack\nprofessional\nor\nacademic success\nand this is what i mean by there's a\nlack of diagnostic sophistication so i\ncan diagnose someone with adhd and\ndepression and i can give them treatment\nright i can give them medications or do\ncbt or whatever\nbut in my experience of working with\nactual human beings if you really want\nto conquer this it actually starts with\nthis degree of diagnostic sophistication\nso for you to look at yourself and say\nlike okay which one of these things\nreally fits me because each of these is\ngoing to have a different kind of like\nsolution right so let's kind of go\nthrough those\nso like if your problem is\nreward circuitry like maybe what you\nneed to do is a dopamine detox\nif your problem is orbital frontal\ncontrol maybe what you need to do is\nmeditate\nif your problem is amygdala hyper\nreactivity maybe what you need to do is\nalter your diet for a certain\nneurotransmitter production or\nbe careful about toxic influences\nor do a grounding meditation\nbecause there's meditation specificity\nall throughout here as well\nokay maybe your problem is emotional\nregulation so then this is where like\nyou can do things like you know cbt or\nother kinds of exercises to like move\nbetween these\nthese different areas right so cbt can\nteach you how to which is cognitive\nbehavioral therapy can teach you how to\ndo reappraisal\nyou know increasing awareness\nof avoidance\nso i know it sounds kind of interesting\nbut if you just become aware of your\navoidance\nthat can actually move you into engaging\nin suppression so just awareness is\nactually sufficient at starting the\nprocess of going from avoidance to\nsuppression\nirritability once again there are\ndietary changes here so there's evidence\nthat for example altering the diet of\npeople with severe autism\nto have high iron diets and address\nnutritional deficiencies\num\nactually reduces the amount of like\nmeltdowns that they have i know it's\ncrazy but people have actually done\nstudies on severe autism and what\nthey've realized is that like so because\nsome of these poor kids like they're\njust medicated through the roof to keep\nthem like docile and it turns out that\nthere are dietary changes that you can\nmake that will actually alter your\nirritability there's a bunch of stuff\nabout this in dr k's guide about sort of\ntheories around how altering your diet\naffects neurotransmitter production\nright so produces serotonin like gives\nyou precursors that will be produced\nturned into dopamine serotonin etc\nthings like that\nif your problem is shame or loneliness\nso for shame like maybe you need to go\nto therapy and this kind of therapy may\nbe different it's more processing\ntherapy right if you're lonely this is\nwhere like potentially coaching could\ncome in like sure you could go to the\ntherapy route and talk about how you're\nlonely but maybe by working with a coach\nyou can actually focus on solutions\nto make friends right like how can i\nunderstand like okay where can i go how\ndo i meet people where how do i go\noutside we had that post recently so a\nlot of different solutions with\nloneliness that may not necessarily be\nsitting in your your therapist's office\nand like talking about how lonely you\nare like i know it's crazy as a\ntherapist sometimes i do not think that\nis the cure to loneliness\nand now discordant relationships this\none is huge because once you are aware\nright so here's my experience with the\nmajority of people i work with adhd\nwhen it comes to this\nthey have no idea what they're doing\nlike they have no idea that the reason\ntheir relationships are discordant is\nbecause they are inattentive\nis because they are impulsive that other\npeople have difficulty keeping up with\nthem all they conclude is people don't\nlike me\nit's hard for me to keep friends i don't\nget invited to stuff and then that just\nturns into shame\nright so like then they start to develop\nan identity of themselves\nthat i am unlikable people don't want to\nbe my friend it's not anything in their\ncontrol it's it's just like i am this\nway and i'm screwed and so it leads to\nshame and the more ashamed you are and\nthe more you come to realize that people\ndon't want to be your friend you're not\neven going to engage in relationships\nand then you don't try to engage in\nrelationships then you end up being\nlonely\nso by understanding the nature of your\ndiscordant relationships you can even\nprep people so sometimes i'll even like\nprep my patients about how to talk to\npeople and say things like hey by the\nway i've got adhd\nso like there are all kinds of things\nthat my patients oftentimes do so for\nexample they'll be late to social\nengagements\nthey'll be\num you know they'll sometimes even\nforget like like they won't keep track\nof like the fact that we're supposed to\nmeet someone for lunch and so obviously\nlike that person is pissed\nand so interestingly enough just raising\nawareness of your you know\ninattentiveness\nraising awareness of your\ndisorganization\nand raising awareness of\nyour impulsivity\ncan actually\ncan actually start to mend your\nrelationships like you can just form\nhealthier relationships once you\nunderstand all these things\nthe bullying you know you can teach\npeople how to set good boundaries\nand the professional academic success\nthere's a lot of stuff here but you know\nthere's dealing with the shame to begin\nwith because that's that's like a burden\non you that prevents you from succeeding\nyou know you have a sense of identity\nas a failure so you can work on that\nright maybe therapy maybe coaching\nsomething like that and then you can\nalso do like actual treatment\ninterventions like maybe you do need\nlike adhd meds\nmaybe you do need cognitive behavioral\ntherapy for adhd\nright and the point here is that the\nroad map\nfor your\nprogress and for you to put together\nyour life is absolutely there\nbut it starts by sort of having a\nsophistication of diagnosis\nwhat is my actual problem here which of\nthese boxes do i check so you can kind\nof go down this list\nright and you can kind of say like okay\noh this feels right this feels not right\nactually like i'm not getting bullied\nit's not a big deal like oh yeah like my\nbig problems are professional or\nacademic success feeling of shame and\nthen like i'm very very avoided\nright it's not so much that i'm\nirritable like i don't get pissed easily\ni actually do have good friends i've got\na good social support structure so i'm\nnot lonely or this and so it's it's very\nspecific in terms of how to navigate it\nand once again despite the fact that\nlike you know the last thing that i kind\nof want to share with you all is despite\nthe fact a lot of this stuff is genetic\nand neuroscientific in nature\nthere's still a lot you can do about it\nlike this is not you know there's a lot\nof stuff on the intervention side that\ncan be done\nand generally speaking my my approach is\na clinician and this is what you know\nit's not just as a clinician this is\nwhat we also do in coaching\nis to like help people understand where\nis your actual problem\nand awareness of the problem can in my\nopinion not even doing anything about it\njust recognizing what the problem is\ncan account for a 50 improvement in\nwhatever you're talking about so just to\ngive you guys like a simple\nepidemiological example of this so if\nyou look at like obesity in central\namerica\nso obesity in central america is really\nreally bad and it's probably due to\nthe propagation of like sugary beverages\nlike and people down there like i think\nthat's changing now but you know 20 or\n30 years ago like people like some in\nsome parts of central america there was\njust a lack of education that like\ndrinking you know like sugary juices and\nsugary sodas like three meals a day is\ngoing to contribute to obesity and once\npeople just realize oh hey what i'm\nputting into my body may affect you know\nlike my health\nonce that awareness is there it actually\nresults in like a positive change in\nbehavior\nand so if you look at things like\nsocioeconomic status and obesity what\nyou tend to find is that there are parts\nof the you know\nparts of the world where they're like\nthere's a very low understanding of like\nthe impact of like what you put into\nyour body and how it affects your health\nand you can go to places like whole\nfoods and stuff like that where there\nare all these wellness magazines there's\na lot of food that's unhealthy by the\nway\nbut you can see that even awareness can\naccount for some amount of change and\neven from video games we kind of know\nlike if you don't know why you're losing\na game you can't even begin to improve\nit if you're just aware of particular\nmechanics right like being aware of\nthose mechanics will automatically\nchange the way that you play the game\nand so i think awareness in my opinion\nis actually worth 50\nof the progress and then once you have a\nspecific problem or once you figure out\nwhat your specific problem is where your\nspecific vulnerability is you can start\nto make changes in that particular\ndirection to sort of overcome this issue\na couple of things which i i should sort\nof say if it hasn't become clear i think\nif this stuff resonates with y'all the\nfirst thing you should do if you haven't\ndone it already is seek an actual mental\nhealth professional's help\nso if you're concerned you may have adhd\nif you're concerned you may have\ndepression go and talk to an actual\ndoctor or like therapist or something so\ni know a lot of times we'll talk about\nthings like dr k's guide and coaching\nand all that kind of stuff i really do\nthink the single most important\nintervention you can do is to actually\ngo see a mental health professional\nbeyond that there are other things that\nyou can do like by all means go watch dr\nk's guide there's a lot of stuff in\nthere about meditation and these\ndifferent grounding meditations versus\nlike the meditations that will teach you\ncontrol by all means check out our\nyoutube video on dopamine detox if you\nwant to talk about this kind of stuff\nand focus on solutions to make friends\nand things like that that's something\nthat coaches may be better trained at um\nyou know helping you with professional\nand academic success that may be\nsomething that coaches are can help you\nwith\nuh you know helping with discordant\nrelationships that can be therapy or\ncoaching\nbut really at the top of the list is if\nyou guys have not seen a mental health\nprofessional you should absolutely go do\nthat\nquestions\nor i guess let me just kind of summarize\nso just to kind of cap recap\ntoday we talked a little bit about adhd\nand depression and the goal of what i\nwas trying to do today is to stitch\ntogether\na lot of different\ndisciplines of science to give us a very\nclear understanding\nof\nwhat adhd and depression like how they\ninteract and what they are so it starts\nwith genetics where we sort of\ndiscovered that 70 of\nadhd and depression appears to be\nhas a 70 concordance in genetics that\nthere are a lot of scary statistics that\nshow that adhd and depression may start\nat the genetic level so once we\nunderstood the genetics we kind of went\ninto certain neuroscience and tried to\nfigure out okay what's happening in the\nbrain of people with adhd and depression\nhow do these two things kind of interact\nthen what we did is looked at deficits\nright so once we understand what's\nhappening in the brain what does that\nmanifest as within an individual what\nare the actual deficits that someone\nwith adhd and depression has\nonce we understood what the deficits are\nwe sort of were able to take a\ndevelopmental perspective so if you take\na kid who has these kinds of develop\ndeficits\nand sort of has adhd as a child\nhow does growing up with those deficits\nmanifest as depression\nwhen you're an adult and we kind of\nexplored those things and what what\nwhether the statistics tell us what does\nthe research tell us are they\ncontributing or what are the smoking\nguns of depression in adulthood for\npeople who have adhd and we discovered\nthat it's discordant relationships\nbullying academic hardship emotional\ndysregulation and irritability\nand then we even looked at sort of a\nmore present focused or clinical focused\nperspective where we kind of said okay\nso like once you're here and you're in\nthe here and now you grew up with adhd\nnow you have depression what does that\nlook like in the here and now what are\nthe different strategies that people use\nin the present to deal with their\nemotions\nand then finally once we understood that\nwhat is our roadmap for improvement if\nyou fall into this bucket what do you\nactually end up like what can you do\nabout it and the answer is you can do a\nlot so you're not doomed by your\ngenetics you're not doomed by your brain\nthere's a ton of stuff that you can do\nand i've worked very successfully with\nlike tons of patients that have been\nable to essentially overcome adhd and\ndepression so there's hope out there\ndon't give up and i really hope that\ntoday's lecture has empowered you all to\nbetter understand this really\nfascinating aspect of like human\nneuroscience human psychology and like\nsort of\nthe experiences of these people in the\npresent\nquestions\nall right questions\nokay i'm gonna focus on questions\nrelating to adhd and depression for now\nuh just\nhow does strengthening the frontal lobe\naffect stuff\nokay good question\nso let's kind of go back\nso how does strengthening the frontal\nlobe affect stuff\nso remember that our motivation\nbehavioral drives and essentially what\nwe do our reward circuitry\nis the nucleus accumbens\nnow in the nucleus accumbens\nlet's kind of go down here okay\nso let's look at point number seven\nhow does\nfrontal lobe\naffect things\nso in our nucleus accumbens\nthere's like a pro and a con for a\nbehavior okay\nand essentially what happens is like our\nemotions may be telling us break up with\nthis person\nand our frontal lobes may be telling us\noh no no don't do that don't give in to\nthe emotion there's like there's a\ntension\nbetween emotions\nand frontal lobes\nin the nucleus accumbens and depending\non which one wins if the frontal lobe\nwins then like you'll engage in one\nbehavior and if the emotions win you'll\nengage in another behavior it even goes\na little bit deeper because the reward\nstructure can be related to emotions or\nfrontal lobe and so what that even means\nis that\nhow can i say this\nlet's say i'm bullying someone the\namount of satisfaction i get from\nbullying someone\nrelates to the emotional impact on our\nnucleus accumbens versus our frontal\nlobes which is why we'll see like if you\nlook at people who are lifelong\nmeditators\nthey don't engage in like toxic behavior\nbecause it feels less rewarding to them\nthis is how like people who meditate on\na regular basis like become better human\nbeings\ni know it's kind of bizarre because it's\nnot just the influence of like you know\nwhat you end up doing it's also the\nreward that you get from like giving in\nto your emotions so like giving in to\nhatred is going to reward it's going to\nreinforce your behavior in a particular\nway and it's going to feel really really\ngood if your brain is like framed a\nparticular way when you strengthen\nstrengthen your frontal lobes literally\nthe satisfaction that you get from being\na toxic on the internet goes\ndown and so then we see a reduction in\nthat behavior because your reward\ncircuitry has been altered\ndoes that make sense\num so you mentioned genetics but are you\nfamiliar with the science behind\nepigenetics in regards to this\nspecifically the studies about things\nlike ptsd being passed down to children\nthrough epigenetics yeah i'm pretty\nfamiliar with that research so let's\ntake the question from the top so\nthere's some evidence okay let's just\nreally go from the top\nso the first thing is that\nthere's a field called epigenetics which\nis not the actual genes\nbut the act how genes are turned on or\nturned off so our genome look we've got\na bunch of stuff in there and it's not\nnecessarily the allele or like the the\ngene like the dna sequence at a\nparticular point but like you can turn\ngenes on and you can turn genes off\nthat's called epigenetics\nso\nwhether genes are turned on or off\nactually relates to our experiences so\ncertain kinds of genes\nwill be turned on by certain kinds of\nexperiences so an example of this\nis when our body gets an infection we\nwill activate transcription we will turn\non genes of things like heat shock\nproteins and other kinds of like genes\nin our cells that will help us fight\ninfection right so it's like there's a\nbunch of stuff that like once we get\ninfected our bodies like time to go to\nwar let's start producing like let's\nturn on our armories and start producing\nsoldiers and like you know cytokines\nthat will help us fight infection so\nexperiences can affect our genetic\nuh\nactivation\nand so if we go back to what i was\nsaying earlier about what is the model\nof genes right so that's where i sort of\nshared that genetics plus vulnerability\nis what results in illness and all that\nkind of stuff is epigenetic\nso this is also where when we kind of\nlook at that that developmental aspect\nwhen we were talking about okay if you\nhave a kid with adhd who grows up with\nan adhd brain\nand experiences life as a kid with adhd\nwith bullying and not having friends and\nlike poor academic success that's going\nto have an epigenetic impact and make\nyou vulnerable to depression so i\nbelieve a lot of that stuff is mediated\nthrough epigenetics i personally have\nnot looked into the epigenetics\nof development with adhd as it relates\nto depression but i sort of feel like i\ndon't need to because there's like i\nmean hopefully i made a convincing\nargument of this i think we have enough\npieces of the puzzle where we're like\npretty sure that that's happening\ngreat question though\num\nyeah so can can you explain more how to\nwork on discordant relationships sure\nso the term discordant relationship\nmeans like a relationship that has\ndiscord right it's something that's not\nworking properly\nso if you want to work on discordant\nrelationships as someone with adhd\ni think the main thing to understand is\nwhat are your adhd deficits that could\nimpact the relationship that's the first\nthing you've got to do\nso is this relationship not going well\nbecause i am disorganized and i like\ndon't show up when i'm supposed to show\nup is this relationship not going well\nbecause i was supposed to pick up pick\nsomeone up at the airport and i showed\nup an hour late because i'm disorganized\nlike that's a very practical example of\nhow disorganization and adhd negatively\naffects the relationship\nis this relationship being negatively\naffected because i'm inattentive so when\ni do hang out with someone i'm literally\nnot able to attend to like what they're\nsaying so we're going to dinner together\nand like i'm going to dinner with let's\nsay my partner right so my romantic\npartner and they've had a bad day and my\nmind is like wandering all over the\nplace so then that that partner will\nfeel unheard they'll feel like someone's\nnot listening to them they won't feel\nemotionally supported and it'll create\ndiscord in the relationship\nso the first thing to under to do or\nmaybe it's like irritability or\nemotional regulation right so maybe the\nway the reason that my\nrelationship is in discord is because\ni'm too irritable i've had a bad day and\nthen i like go and meet my friends and\nsince i'm in a foul mood because i'm\noverly irritable like i snap at them and\nthey feel hurt and then like i feel like\nkind of i feel like i screwed up right\nand then the avoidance kicks in because\nwe know that people with adhd engage in\navoidance behaviors and so once i create\na problem in a relationship\nsince i rely on avoidance i never really\nfix it right i never talk to them about\nit i never apologize to them or i overly\napologize and never engage in discussion\ni never asked them hey what was it like\nto have me being like irritable that day\nright i never want to hear from them\nhow i'm like actually sometimes not a\ngreat friend so i avoid\nso like that's an example of like\nlooking at\nnot only the the predispositions you\nhave\nto damage relationships but then also\nyour coping mechanisms can sort of\nreinforce that damage or interfere with\nyour repair mechanisms because you're so\navoidant and that leads to discordant\nrelationships\nso how do you work on it right so now\nthis is where we kind of look at for\nexample like if you know that what your\nproblems are you can actually have\nconversations with people about them\nright you can say hey by the way so like\nlet's say you go to dinner with your\npartner and and they're like they're\ntalking about things and you can even\nlike while you're tuned in you can say\nhey\ni can see that this is something that's\nreally upsetting you and i'm having a\nlot of trouble focusing on what you're\nsaying and what i really want to do more\nthan anything else is focus on what\nyou're saying\num so i'm going to do my best but i\napologize if it seems like i'm kind of\nchecked out\ni'm really trying to pay attention\nthe second thing that you can do is even\nsuggest an alternative and you can say\nhey like it's really hard for me to like\npay attention to you like being in this\ncrowded restaurant\nis it okay if we table this conversation\nlet's go for a walk after we're done\nwith dinner and like i'd love to hear\nabout it maybe we can go for a walk\nbecause oftentimes what people with adhd\ndiscover is that having some kind of\nphysical activity helps them pay\nattention\nso i've even had i've written notes for\nstudents of mine for them to be able to\nknit during class\nokay so this is a really interesting\nthing that if if people with adhd are\nable to knit they can actually pay\nbetter attention mentally so you i'll\neven have patients who will be like hey\nlet's like i'm going to stop eating this\nis the extreme i don't think this has\never happened i'm going to stop eating\nand because this conversation is so\nimportant to me i'm going to pull out my\nknitting because that helps me pay\nattention it's bizarre\nright so then you can start to address\nthings you can also signal to other\npeople because remember that if they\ndon't know what's going on internally\nthey're going to interpret your\ninattentiveness as a lack of caring\nso you can have a conversation with them\nwhere you can help people understand hey\nit's not that i don't care it's that i\nreally do care and my brain is really\nnot complying right now\nright\nso you can sort of address things and\nthen the third thing which i think is\nreally really important to improve\ndiscordant relationships is to move away\nfrom avoidance\nif there is some kind of conflict if\nthere is some kind of problem and you\nfeel really ashamed or whatever like you\ncan't\nbury it right or i guess you can\nsuppress that's that's what i mean by\nbear i mean so that kind of\nsuppression is actually healthy so\nburying it and attending to them but\navoiding the situation never having a\nconversation with them never\nacknowledging things pretending that\neverything is okay or devaluing things\nin my mind oh my partner will be fine\nit's like not that big of a deal like\nthey understand i've got adhd i don't\nneed to talk to him about it all of\nthose kinds of avoidance strategies will\ncause discord in your relationship so\nmove from those strategies to more\nsuppression where you're like even\nthough it's really going to hurt me to\nhave this conversation because my\npartner may say may confirm my my\ndeepest fears that i'm actually not a\ngood partner at times i still have to\nhave the conversation i'm gonna squash\nthat feeling down and sit down and\nactually have the conversation and\nideally you can even get to the point of\nreappraisal\nwhere you can work through things on\nyour own and you can say like you know i\nreally care about this relationship and\neven though it may be hurtful\nto get confirmation that i didn't do a\ngreat job in the long term\nmoving past that is the right move and\nreally what this relationship needs so i\nhave to do it because caring about the\nrelationship and my value for the\nrelationship is greater than my feelings\nbeing hurt temporarily\nthat's sort of the ultimate fix\nso i hope that helps\num\nokay so one person is saying i've tried\nto get diagnosed for adhd and have been\ntold because i'm depressed and my age it\nwould be inconclusive and am unable to\nget treatment for what i what what what\ncan i do so i'd say go see a different\nclinician so let's understand a couple\nof things\nso adhd oftentimes people will get\ntested for adhd so there are\nneuropsychological tests so you go to a\npsychologist and they will administer\nlike a test of your attention\nbased on the results of that test they\ncan diagnose you with adhd or not\ndiagnose you with adhd but the truth is\nthat a test cannot diagnose you with\nadhd\nall a test can do is give you a\nprobability of what your diagnosis of\nadhd is if that sort of makes sense\nbecause that's how psychological tests\nare designed\na true diagnosis of adhd comes from is\noften done clinically and a test is used\nto supplement a clinical diagnosis and\nso what does that mean a clinical\ndiagnosis that means that you sit down\nwith a trained professional who\nevaluates you and essentially\nsubjectively decides i know it's kind of\nobjective but it's really one person's\nopinion because that's how we do\npsychiatric diagnoses there are no\nobjective tests for psychiatric\ndiagnoses\nso a trained clinician has to sit down\nevaluate your symptoms and say yes\naccording to my expertise you have adhd\nor according to my expertise you do not\nhave adhd\nso there may be so that's ultimately\nwhere the diagnosis of adhd comes from\nit doesn't technically come from a test\nyou know even the test report\nwill not give you a hundred percent\nlikelihood that you have adhd if you\nactually read the report it'll probably\nsay and i could be wrong there may be a\ntest out there that because i'm not a\nneuropsychologist\num\nso you know i could be mistaken there\nbut based on as a psychiatrist when i\nrefer people to neuropsychological\ntesting they'll give me a report back\nand that report will say like you know\nwe believe that this person has you know\nhas a high likelihood or extremely high\nlikelihood of having adhd here are the\nneuroscientific deficits that\nwe believe that this person has which\nwhich is why we think they have adhd so\nthey go into a lot of detail but they're\nnever going to give you 100\nso just talk to a clinician now the main\nconfounding factor is that if you have\nactive depression\nso if your cognition is being affected\nby your depression\nthen it it makes it very hard to\ndetermine whether your inattention is a\nis coming from the depression or coming\nfrom the adhd if that sort of makes\nsense\nbecause we know that people who are\nactively depressed have trouble paying\nattention to things but that has nothing\nto do with adhd that's because attention\nis you know a complicated\ncircuit in the brain that can be\naffected by mood that can be affected by\ndepression so the real way you should\nmake a diagnosis of adhd with someone\nwho's got a diagnosis of depression is\nideally to treat the depression have the\ndepression in remission right so then\nthey're not actively depressed anymore\nand then evaluate their attentive when\ntheir depression is theoretically out of\nthe picture and if they still have\nattentional problems then there's a good\nlikelihood that they've got adhd now as\na clinician\ni've diagnosed people with adhd despite\nthe fact that they're actively depressed\nand that simply comes from\nasking questions about what their\nattention was like before they were\ndepressed right so you can still do that\nyou can still try to do an assessment of\nlike before depression ever manifested\nwhat was school like for you did you\never need special testing did you have\ndifficulty with this do you have\ndifficulty with that sometimes i'll talk\nto their parents and you can still sort\nof like make a preliminary diagnosis of\nadhd even in the case of active\ndepression\nand that's very important clinically so\ni'd say find a good clinician because a\ngood clinician should be able to suss\nthat out for you and walk you through\nyou know maybe treating your depression\nso that you can get a good diagnosis but\ni'm not surprised that one person would\nsay hey we can't give you\nneuropsychological testing while you're\nactively depressed because that'll\ninterfere with the test results that\nsort of makes sense\nokay just so you all know i know i'm\ngetting a lot of like questions and\nresponses and stuff like i'm still like\non the first round of questions okay so\nlike i think i can scroll down quite a\nbit\num\nsomeone's saying\ndr k listening to your voice empowers me\ngood i'm happy to hear that\ni'd also hope that listening to my words\nempowers you\noh boy\nadventurer 467 says i'm late oh dude\nmy poor friend\nif you came in late to this lecture\nit's gonna be tough dude\ngo back and watch from the beginning\num\nokay why do people have adhd what a good\nquestion\nthis is actually really interesting why\ndo people have adhd\nso it is my belief that adh the reason\nwe so okay why do people have adhd if we\nwant to understand why human beings have\nthings\ni think the best\nway uh sorry the best answer for the\nquestion why\nis\nevolution\nso i just\nas a psychiatrist medical professional\nscientist call me whatever you want to\ni think if you really want to understand\nwhy like you could turn to things like\nreligion or yoga or whatever right and\ni've studied all that stuff i believe in\nsome of that stuff but in terms of what\ni'm confident you know sharing with\ny'all it's basically evolution\nso if you look at like human beings\neverything we have things that you know\ndon't exist probably had selection\npressures against them and things that\ndo exist have selection pressures for\nthem so for example people may ask the\nquestion why do we get depressed and\nthere's a good video about this in dr\nk's guide\ndepression\nis the evil is the price we pay for the\nevolutionary advantage of self-awareness\nso if we think about human beings at\nsome point we became self-aware and it\nturns out that from an evolutionary\nstandpoint the capacity for\nself-reflection\ngave us such a dominating advantage over\nevery other species in the planet the\nproblem is that when we gain\nself-awareness we open ourselves up to\ndepression and that has to do with this\ncircuit called the default mode network\nthere's a you know a big thing about\nthat in in dr k's guide i go into all\nthat detail\nso let's talk about adhd like why would\nwe have adhd if it's a disease right\nwhereas i think you have to and there's\na good theory about this which is sort\nof the hunter versus farmer uh theory\nwhich is that when human beings were\nlike you know ten thousand years ago or\nfive thousand years ago human beings had\ndifferent temperaments\nso some human beings were very like\nroutine oriented like to wake up at the\nsame time every day like to go to the\nsame place every day and do the same\nstuff every day so these people became\nthe farmers and there were other human\nbeings that hated being a farmer they\nwanted variety and they wanted to like\ngo out and explore and they needed to\nattend to a lot of stimuli so when i'm\nwalking through the jungle my brain\nneeds to be like bouncing all over the\nplace it needs to kind of be adhd it\ncan't just focus on one tree it has to\nlook at this tree and has to look at the\nground is there a snake over there is\nthere oh is that like a footprint over\nthere is that is that a broken branch\nover there and so what there's almost\nlike this adaptive benefit to having a\nmind that's attention is more loose and\nnot focused and not repetitive\nand so early on in in human like in\nsocieties like we had hunter gatherer\nsocieties we had early farming societies\nand things like that and there was\nprobably a selection pressure for both\nso the most successful tribe was one\nthat had some farmers some people who\nwere in the routine and some people who\nwere like very dynamic and had attention\nall over the place\nso essentially what happened is like\nthat's why we see in society we have\nboth camps right we have the people\nwhose attention is all over the place\nthese are the vatas for lack of a better\nterm and then we also have the kaphas\nthese are the farmers the people who are\nvery routine oriented the reason that\nadhd is now a disorder\nis because of a couple of things but the\nfirst and biggest reason is because our\nsociety has a very very farmer bent\nso like hunters like don't do well in\nour society anymore if we think about\nschool for example school is like eight\nhours a day the same crap all day every\nday it's not being out in the woods it's\nnot learning with your hands it's not\nusing your hands right it's not being a\ntradesman anymore or trades woman it's\nit's all about like schools and books\nand learning and nine to five and the\ngrind and stuff like that so that\nbenefits the farmers it's a farmer-like\nsociety\nas a result\nnow this thing which used to be an\nevolutionary advantage when we were\nhunter-gatherers has now become a\ndisorder because we don't we're not able\nto function in this society with brains\nlike this\nso that's my big answer to why is there\nadhd it's because these brains no longer\nfit with the society that we have there\nare also other influences like we know\nthat for example early exposure to\ntechnology and especially like short\nform technology\nreduces our attention span and makes\nlike it hard for us to like\nretain attention on one area so it's not\njust societal influence there can also\nbe like technological influences where\nthere are even studies that have been\ndone on long-form television versus\nshort form television so if you take a\nkid and you give them long-form tv like\nyou have them watch a movie that's not\ngoing to negatively affect their\nattention span whereas if you have a kid\nwho's watching 30 second clips on\nyoutube for like six hours a day their\nattention span is going to be like\nreally really short right so they'll\nstill be very dynamic they can juggle a\nlot of things but their ability to sit\nthrough school is not going to be like\nit's going to be hard it's hard for them\nto sit down and focus their attention\nso there do appear to be societal\ninfluences that are like more\ndevelopmental and related to technology\ntoo which is why adhd i think is getting\nworse actually so that's why we have\nadhd\nokay\noh man what are the comorbidities of\nother conditions that also match adhd\nsymptoms dude that's a whole lecture in\nand of itself\num\nbut the short answer is that's why we\nhave the process of differential\ndiagnosis\nso remember that you know\nadhd is a collection of symptoms like\nimpulsivity for example inattention\nirritability if we look at the\ndifferential diagnosis for those\nsymptoms there's like a ton of stuff\nright so ptsd is the great chameleon of\nmental illnesses and can masquerade as\npretty much anything bipolar disorder\ndepression can sometimes there's a\nsubtype of depression called depression\nwith anger attacks which is like a bit\nthat depression which we also talk about\nin dr k's guide so that's where like\npeople who are depressed aren't sad they\njust get super irritable so even\ndepression can manifest as like\nirritability and inattention\nbipolar disorder for sure if you're\nmanic rights or hypomanic you're more\nirritable you're less attentive you have\nflight of ideas so bipolar disorder can\nmanifest as substance use is very high\non the list of like on the differential\nright because if i'm like high on\nadderall or i've had too much coffee i'm\ngoing to be speaking very fast my mind\nis all over the place and i'm going to\nbe irritable\nso the differential diagnosis is huge if\nyou want to you know a great i mean i\nguess we could theoretically do whole\nlectures about differential diagnosis\nbut that's when we're really like\ntalking medical school kind of stuff\nlike that's what i teach clinically like\nwhen i've\nyou know a resident who's like a\npsychiatrist or a medical student who\nwants to learn about psychiatry like\nthat's the kind of detail that we go\ninto there good question though\num\nseems like defective executive function\nwould be a disadvantage in tribes i\nwould think so\nso i i think like executive function is\nlike the most op thing in the brain in\nmy opinion so i don't know why we would\nhave a deficit for executive function if\nwe look at it evolutionarily probably\nthe reason that we have deficits in\nexecutive function\nis because of opportunity cost\nso if you kind of think about it i know\nthis sounds kind of weird\nbut what do you think is like\nevolutionary evolutionarily advantageous\nbeing very like stable and monogamous\nmonogamous and staying in one\nrelationship for your entire life that\nis like harmonious where you raise two\nkids and you you know you make sure that\nyou can like support them with resources\nor being somewhat of an emotional train\nwreck and having like lots of different\nchildren with like lots of different\npeople\nwhat's actually like evolutionary\nadvantageous\nright like falling in love and then\nhaving a train wreck of a relationship\nif that happens like six times over the\ncourse of 15 years\nit's interesting right so like\nevolutionary advantages are about\nsurvival and reproduction by the way i'm\nnot sure that that's the case so i\nliterally do not know\nbecause it may be that you know that\nperson's\noffspring or like less likely to have\nsuccessful offspring of their own like\nyou never know\nso so it's interesting but\nyeah we don't really know why people\nseem to have executive function deficits\nbut it may be because like if your\nexecutive function is too high like\nyou're less likely to have children\nwho knows\nokay\nuh\num\nso would you have any recommendation\nfor adhd dears\nwith depression who are currently unable\nto access medication due to waiting\nlists any supplementation or specific\nmeditation techniques you'd recommend\nso i'd go back to the roadmap right so i\ngave you all like lots of different\nthings to work on\nas far as supplementation goes i'm not\ngoing to recommend any supplements\ngenerally speaking we try to steer clear\nof that here at hg i mean we do do it in\ndr k's guide because\ni think there's a lot of backstory\nbefore like you understand like you\nthink about taking a supplement so in dr\nk's guide we go into a lot of detail\nabout the dangers of herbal supplements\nwe also want to do a very thorough like\nreview of the literature and the science\nbefore we recommend anything so there\nare particular things that we'll talk\nabout for depression and anxiety but it\nneeds to have like you know a lot of\nsafety discussions\na lot of like exploration of the real\nefficacy of supplementation\nso while there are things that i do for\nmy patients and that's basically about\nthat balancing diet is what i would\nrecommend\nthere's a lot of back story to that and\na lot of complicated stuff that you need\nto do before i just say hey do this so i\nthink one of the unfortunately\nirresponsible things that tends to\nhappen is people will talk a lot about\nsupplements but they won't have in my\nopinion the\nboring\nsafe conversations that you really need\nto before you get into supplementation\nas far as specific meditation techniques\ni think i addressed that in the roadmap\nas well so we we've taught some\ntechniques for restraining attention\nlike the rotating sound awareness\nmeditation um\nand by the way the the guide now has a\nmeditation index where you can now\nsearch based on like if you're looking\nfor grounding techniques and things like\nthat it'll like point them out to you\nbut i think that depending on going back\nto the roadmap\nonce you figure out what your problem is\nthere are specific meditations for like\neach of those problems so if your\nproblem is shame for example you may\nwant to do like some kind of anahat\nchakra or mehta meditation these are\nheart chakra meditations that are all\nabout cultivating compassion and\nforgiveness that's going to be different\nfrom\nthe meditation that helps you restrain\nyour attention and focus on one point\nthat in turn is going to be different\nfrom the kind of meditation that you use\nto ground yourself when you're\nemotionally activated and like very\nirritable\nright so there are all these different\nmeditation techniques there really isn't\ngreat science yet that\nspecific meditation techniques\ntarget things at the resolution that i\nteach\nbecause you just have to do a ton of\nclinical trials we're i think we'll get\nthere we're getting there\nbut clinically i found it to be very\neffective to teach people specific\ntargeted meditation techniques but those\ntechniques depend on you know the\nroadmap\num so so one person is saying great so\nadhd is good for nothing now i disagree\nso i'm pretty sure that if you look at\nsuccessful streamers and content\ncreators\nthe prevalence of adhd within content\ncreators is higher than the average\npopulation\ni think as our society is becoming more\nadhd with shorter form content and\nthings like that\nright so like it's like the adhd brain\nwho did we have um\nthat guy uh who has so he so first of\nall if you go back through our\ninterviews like we have a bunch of like\nstreamers and content creators who have\nlike we'll say yeah i have adhd\num daily dose of the internet so i think\ni think that's a guy i think if i\nremember correctly he sort of said like\ni have really\nbad adhd and if you kind of think about\nit what is he doing like he\ninstinctively knows because of his adhd\nwhat he finds entertaining so he uses\nhis adhd is almost like a compass\nto determine like what's getting\nincluded in daily dose of the internet\nand what isn't and it's very successful\nright so we've also got people are\nmentioning miss kiff and and xqc and\nstuff like that so like yeah i mean\ncheck out the mischief interview if you\nall are curious that's an excellent\ninterview about adhd\nbut i do think that it's you know adhd\nhas advantages like\nonce it crosses the threshold of\ndisorder it's\nthe reason we define it as a disorder is\nlike because it's negatively impacts\nyour function so if you've got super bad\nyou know adhd chances are it's just like\nit's a it's a negative right\num but that's why i also prefer to sort\nof use the ayurvedic system because i am\nquite adhd but i'm like subclinical so i\nthink avata is a better example of like\nhow to understand the spectrum the bell\ncurve of like attention across human\nbeings\nis becoming apathetic to your successes\nwhilst obsessing over your failures\ncommon with adhd i'm gonna say yes\nso let's go back to the neuroscience\nso remember that\noh man this is so complicated let me\njust think about this\nokay\nso the question is is becoming apathetic\nto your successes whilst obsessing over\nyour failures common with adhd and i'm\ngonna say yes\nso let's\nlet's lean a little bit on what we've\nlearned today okay and maybe y'all can\nwalk\nwalk through this with me\nso first thing is obsessing over your\nfailures common with adhd let's unpack\nthat phrase so the first thing is\nobsessing so one of the hallmarks of\nadhd\nis\ndysregulated attention so a lot of times\npeople assume that adhd means a very\nsmall attention span but the truth is if\nyou talk to people with adhd what you\nfind is dysregulated attention and what\nthat means is that\nsometimes their attention is very very\nsmall but the flip is also true where\nsometimes they get so deeply absorbed in\nsomething\nwhere like\nlike everything around them ceases to\nexist so this is a disorder of attention\ninstead of your attention staying kind\nof in the middle where you can get\ndistracted when you need to get\ndistracted but you can focus when you\nneed to focus what you'll see oftentimes\nin adhd is a hyper focus\nto the impairment of their life\nso i get so caught up in a video game\nthat i lose all track of time i get so\nobsessive about something that i stop\npaying attention to everything around me\nso there is obsession is actually like a\nvery interesting hallmark of adhd and\nsomething that leads to the a\nmisdiagnosis\nbecause what you'll find is sometimes\npeople will be like you know parents\nwill think about their kids and they're\nlike well my kid sometimes has paying\nattention but then once he starts\nplaying legos it's clear that legos can\nhold his attention for three hours at a\nstretch without any interruption so that\nmust not be adhd because he's sitting\nthere he's playing with the legos at\nthree hours of stretch that can actually\nbe a feature of adhd so it's disordered\nattention okay\nthe second thing is so that's the\nobsession so the second thing is\nobsessing over failures so remember we\ntalked a little bit about how the volume\nof the amygdala and the insula and\npeople with adhd is smaller\nthe interesting thing is that volume\nloss correlates with worsening symptoms\nof depression so it appears that the\nbrains of people with adhd are actually\nmore vulnerable to negative emotions\nright which is why they're prone to\ndepression\nso obsessing over your failures is\ncompletely consistent with with our\nunderstanding of adhd\nnow being apathetic to your successes\nhas two elements one that i've sort of\nalready talked a little bit about and\nthe second one that's kind of new\nso the first is being apathetic to your\nsuccesses is likely an avoidance\nstrategy to help emotionally regulate\nyourself so remember that people with\nadhd have difficulties with emotional\nregulation and so their inability to\nregulate their emotional emotions\nresults in three coping strategies\navoidance suppression or reappraisal\navoidance is when we kind of mentally\ncheck out from the thing we either avoid\nthe situation entirely we literally\ndon't go so we can physically check out\nof the situation or what we'll do is\nmentally check out of the situation so\nwe'll even go to the place but we'll\ndevalue something in in my mind so that\nit doesn't i don't have to be hurt by it\nright so i kind of go afk in a situation\nthat's absolutely a tactic\nused to overcome my disordered emotions\nto begin with it's a coping mechanism so\nhealthier than that is suppression where\nat least i feel the emotion but i push\nit down so there's internal conflict\nversus mentally checking out and then\nthe third and healthiest thing is\nreappraisal which is when i kind of work\nthrough the emotion and i end up like\nlooking at the silver lining or\nrealizing that okay even though i got\nyou know even though my partner dumped\nme like in the grand scheme of things\nlike there are other people out there i\nlearned a lot from the relationship i'm\ngonna know better what mistakes not to\nmake next time that's an example of\nreappraisal so we can see how apathy to\nsuccess absolutely falls into that\navoidance category\nas a coping strategy against your\ndifficult emotional regulation which we\nonce again know that people with adhd\nhave\nso that's consistent apathetic with\nsuccess the last thing that i'll mention\nwhich is a little bit different which is\na little bit more from the yogic\nperspective or the eastern perspective\nis when you're a child with adhd\nand it's hard for you to succeed because\nyou have certain\nneuro\nneurological disadvantages in terms of\nlike attention and things like that\none of the things that you have to learn\nhow to do\nis\ndivorce yourself from success\nand this is a protective mechanism so i\nwant you to put yourself in the shoes of\nlike a 12 year old who has difficulty\nstudying\nand so if i have difficulty studying and\ni'm afraid i'm going to do bad on the\ntest\nwhat i have to learn how to do is numb\nmyself right because if i've been if i'm\ninvested in success and i have adhd and\nthen i go and fail the test i get\npunished right because i wanted to\nsucceed i wanted to succeed i wanted to\nsucceed and so i i try really hard and\nthen i end up failing anyway because i\nhave adhd it's not my fault i spent\neight hours in front of a book but my\nbrain wouldn't focus and so that hurts\nso much so what do i learn how to do i\nbecome psychologically calloused\ni learn how to numb myself i learn how\nto be apathetic to my success because\nthe cool thing is that if i become\napathetic to my success\ni also in a sense become apathetic to my\nfailure right because if i divorce\nmyself it's like ah i don't care about\nthe test whatever whether i succeed or\nfail whatever\nand so it sort of becomes a short-term\ncoping strategy which doesn't really\nwork because as you kind of mentioned\nyou do still obsess over your failures\nright but that's because your brain is\nvulnerable to the negative emotion so\ndespite the fact that you're numbing\nyourself to the success and the failure\nif you've got a brain that's more\nvulnerable to the negative emotion what\nyou kind of end up with is i'm numbing\nboth equally but i'm hypersensitive due\nto my small volume of insulin amygdala\nto the failure so even though i'm\nnumbing both equally\ni have an amplification of the negative\nemotion due to the way that my my limbic\nsystem is wired right and so that's sort\nof like it's it's like actually a\nperfect example of everything that we\nunderstand from neuroscience everything\nthat we understand from development why\npeople with adhd are apathetic to their\nsuccesses\nand obsess over their failures\nand hopefully if you watch that whole\nlecture you'll be able to follow that\nyou'll be able to arrive at that\nconclusion as well\nthere are so people are asking about\ngender differences between male and\nfemale adhd\nso the biggest difference is that men\nseem to be more vulnerable to adhd than\nwomen i don't have the exact statistics\nbut i think some of that also has to do\nwith maturation of the frontal lobe so\nuh girls tend to have slightly more\nmature frontal lobes than boys do so at\nthe end when everyone's fully grown it\nall evens out but generally speaking\nlike sometimes girls will have you know\nwe'll have like be like developmentally\none to two years\nor boys will be like one to two years\nbehind or girls will be like one to two\nyears ahead so that's pretty common a\nlot of that has to do with frontal lobes\nand adhd does appear to be more common\nin men than women\num\nwould you argue oh man it's so hard\nbecause everything i say you guys that's\nso i'm like responding to questions from\nlike 10 minutes ago or comments which is\nhard i have to figure out how to handle\nthat\nwould you argue that adults teenagers\nthese days have a harder time to cope\nwith adhd due to technology\nbecause the human brain wasn't prepared\nfor the advancement compared to older\ngenerations absolutely\nso\nyou know if we look at older generations\noftentimes like\ni don't mean to speak poorly of them but\nlike the boomer generation right which\nit's not all boomers but some of them\ntend to be very\nnot sympathetic\ntowards the mental health plights of\nlike the digital generation right so the\npre-digital generation is like i don't\nunderstand why y'all are all so messed\nup back in my day i had to walk 10 miles\nthrough the snow\nto get\nto get a\nglass of milk or whatever right they'll\nlike they'll look at their world and\nthen compare their world to our world\nand when they look at the when they\ncompare their world to our world what\nthey'll do is they'll look at a lot of\nthe advantages that we have now which\nthey didn't have back then which are\nfair right so for example like\nfood security i'm pretty sure is better\nnow than it was a hundred years ago you\nknow infant mortality is better now than\nit was a hundred years ago um you know\nthe likelihood of like dying from\ncholera is like way better now than it\nwas a hundred years ago\num you know\nwe have society has advanced society has\nbecome more convenient you used to have\nto go to a restaurant if you wanted to\neat food at a restaurant like from a\nrestaurant right now we have a bunch of\npeople that deliver you can get\ngroceries delivered you can get food\ndelivered you can get all kinds of stuff\ndelivered you can go to school online\nour life has a bunch of convenience\nright so there used to be a certain kind\nof hardship\n100 years ago that we don't experience\nthere are objective you know\nlife has gotten by a lot of objective\nmeasures like mortality and life\nexpectancy and things like that better\nthan it was a hundred years ago\nso you know the pre-digital generation\nlooks at us and they say things are so\nmuch better and they point to all these\nthings and they say like why are you so\nmentally unhealthy like why do you have\nadhd why can't you just study why are\nyou depressed why do you have anxiety\ni think things that i think the things\nthat they don't look at they take some\nthings for granted because they really\ndon't have any awareness of like what\nit's like to grow up in these conditions\nright so they see the change they see\nsome changes which are very external\nbut what the pre-digital generation\ndoesn't understand is like the internal\nstresses that growing up\nin this digital world sends us\nso adhd is a good example of like if we\nlook at content right like first there\nwas youtube and sorry if i'm like\nhistorically inaccurate\nthen there was twitch and if we kind of\nlook at the dynamic-ness of content like\nyoutube used to be like you know still\nlike it's a storehouse of content you\nkind of pick what you watch you're not\nmissing anything because it's to be up\nthere forever and then we that sort of\nevolves into twitch right\nand like twitch is like more interactive\nit's more temporary so you got to kind\nof be there it's a little bit more adhd\nand then like that evolves into tick\ntock which is like the whole point of\ntick tock is that it's super short right\nwe also have evolutions from text\nmessaging to things like snapchat and\ni'm still not 100 sure about this but my\nunderstanding about about snapchat is\nthat it's it's like you know the whole\nidea is that the messages are temporary\nso if you don't check it frequently like\nit disappears into the ether so if we\nlook at the way that technology is\nadvancing it's selecting for and\nentraining conditioning a shorter\nattention span\nand so that's why it's one of the\nreasons why i think that adhd is getting\nworse\nbut technology is also having effects on\nthings like depression and anxiety so\nwhen we get bombarded with the worst\nnews from all over the world every\nsingle day\nwe begin to see the world as falling\napart as we see the world as falling\napart we start to feel depressed and\nhopeless because how can i fix climate\nchange i can't\nmight as well sit at home and do nothing\nright how can i fix\nall of this like you know\nracial hatred i can't might as well sit\ndown and do nothing\nyou know how can i fix all of these like\nincome inequality like i can't fix it\ni'm powerless so when you like when you\nget bombarded with this sensory\ninformation and you feel powerless and\nthen like the internet gives you this\nsweet sweet tick tock right it's like\ndon't don't worry man it's okay like\ndon't worry about climate change here\nwatch this tick talk about climate\nchange which will like engage your\nemotions and make you feel\nself-righteous and will help you feel\nbetter and after you watch that tick\ntock about climate change why don't you\ncheck this one about check out this one\nabout cats because cats are hilarious\ndon't you love cats\nand so that's what happens right we have\nlike this this world that bombards us\nwith all this depressing information and\nthen it gives us like it creates this\nproblem and then it gives us this\nsolution\nand we take the solution our brain loves\nthe solution and then we end up trapped\nin this cycle\nof like you know being emotionally like\npulled around like a like a puppet on on\nstrings and we get like emotionally like\nexistentially depressed and then we get\nlike coping strategies but that's not\neven a coping strategy it's an addiction\nreally\nit's like we'll fix that for you oh like\nyou're in withdrawal from heroin like\nhere have some more heroin that's\nessentially what like is happening in\nthe in on the internet right now is that\nit's like addicting us to heroin by\ngiving us all this negative emotion and\nthen it's like here i've got the\nsolution for you right here\nright it's and so like yeah i think that\nthis is a societal thing it's a\ntechnological thing in the pre-digital\ngeneration i don't think understands\nthat\nright and so this is even funny we even\nhave a word for it right so like the\ninternet has collectively realized\nthat this is going on so we developed\nour own language of copium that's like\nliterally like we put we created a word\nto describe this phenomenon\nbecause it's happening and it's so\nprevalent it's crazy\nright\nlike even look at the icon like look at\nthis picture\nof this pepe with his eyes closed who's\ngot he can't even\nyou guys understand he's got a mask on\nbecause he can't even bring himself to\nhold it to his face he is so afk from\nthe world that it needs to be strapped\nonto him in order for him to get that\ncopium\nhe can't even be bothered to get get up\nout of his chair and like walk over to\nthe copium machine and like take a hit\nof copia\nhe just sticks it on he can't even keep\nhis eyes just gotta afk completely\nyou guys get that it's like actually\nlike in the image\ni mean it's it's a beautiful image like\nart is like a fantastic way to capture\nwhat is happening in society\nright so you guys think that like i'm\ngood at analyzing society in psychology\nbut like i'm a fraction of what a\nbrilliant artist is capable of\nbecause here i am i've been lecturing\nnow for the better part of it's two\nhours holy\nand an artist will capture it like this\nwhoever made this\ncaptured it in like 300 pixels\nit's brilliant\nright they've taken pepe\nand they've just given pepe different\nfacial expressions\nand they've encapsulated so much it's\nalso interesting because you know\ni remember learning in history class\nthat hieroglyphics were a primitive\nlanguage and that the alphabet is a\nsuperior language right because the\nalphabet allows us to you know construct\nwords and things like that you only need\nto learn 26 characters\nand now it's like we've like swung\nthrough alphabet and into emojis and so\nwe've come full circle back to\nhieroglyphics\nwhere now like people don't even\ncommunicate and once again it was like\nwriting letters\nused to be inferior to having a phone\ncall and now we've come full circle and\nwe're like back to texting is our\nprimary form of communication\nand it's like we're coming full circle\nand they've understood this in in like\neast asia for a long time right so they\nhave like chinese characters and kanji\nwhich are essentially like hieroglyphics\nand so it's just interesting that a lot\nof you know a lot of our understanding\nof like language was like actually kind\nof eurocentric\nin terms of its you know a value system\nthat i don't think was actually accurate\nyou"
