    "transcript": "so here's uh so here's what we're gonna\ndo i'm gonna teach you guys manipura\nmantra meditation\nso i think a lot of the themes today\nhave been around emotional processing\nand digestion\nso i've been doing a little bit of\nresearch about how to process emotions\nthrough meditation\nso what i'm going to share with you all\ntoday is not really um\nit's not really like scientific\nso i haven't seen really any studies\nthat suggest\nthat\nyou know what i'm about to teach all is\nlike actually effective\nand at the same time i think i've had a\nlot of good personal experiences with\nchakra meditation\ni've taught it to patients and things\nlike that that feel like it helps\nso what we're going to do today is\nmanipura chakra mantra meditation so let\nme explain a couple of things\nso the manipura chakra is your navel\nchakra and this is the\nchakra chakra whatever\nof your energetic system your spiritual\nenergetic system that governs digestion\nso when i think about emotional problems\ni think about digestive blocks\nfor emotions so if you think about a\nprocess of like psychotherapy what tends\nto happen is people will have some kind\nof blockage of emotion and when you do\ntherapy with someone they'll have like a\nbreakthrough in therapy that tends to\ncome with an up rushing of emotion\nand then you kind of like process it\nwhatever that means and then like people\nfeel better afterwards so even though\nthe process of psychotherapy involves\nexperiencing oftentimes a lot of\nnegative emotions people will describe\nthe process as feeling lighter freer\nyou know they feel healthier afterward\neven though that it's like a lot of\nnegative emotion\nand somehow it's therapeutic\nanother good example of this is funerals\nso like if you look at the process of a\nfuneral what happens is we basically all\nget together and we experience a lot of\nsense of like loss and sadness and grief\nand then after the funeral people start\nto like feel better right some people\nkind of stay stuck but generally\nspeaking funerals are like part of the\nreason we have them is because they help\nus process those negative emotions\nso our digestion capability it comes\nfrom the manipura chakra so this\ninvolves physical digestion as well as\nemotional digestion so when i'm trying\nto help people digest their emotions and\nso i think a big part of this if we're\nthinking about if you're being held\nemotionally hostage\ndigesting that emotion\nshould in theory help you be freer from\nlike whatever it's chaining you to right\ndoes that make sense so like that\nemotional energy is what's holding you\nback\nso i think a lot of things that we\ntalked about today in terms of being\nable to go outside you know being held\nback by like being an emotional hostage\num you know being stuck addicted to\nvideo games or technology like there's\nall kinds of emotions that we don't know\nhow to get rid of\nso hopefully this technique will help\nokay\nso we're going to start by sitting up\nstraight so i want your spine to be\nstraight and what we're going to start\nwith is navel breathing okay or belly\nbreathing or abdominal breathing so sit\nup straight\nand then what i want you all to do is\nclose your eyes\ntake a moment to notice your breath\njust slow deep breaths\nso what we're going to do today\nis as we breathe we're going to expand\nour abdomen and contract our abdomen\nand after we do that we're going to add\na second layer\nof observing the breath\ntravel from our nose\nall the way through our chest and\nalmost into our abdomen\nwe exhale we're going to feel that\npressure and that heat\nsort of coming out of the abdomen\nand then for the third phase of the\npractice\nafter each\nas we're on a full breath we will use\nthe the mantra\nso just repeat in your mind or say it\nout out yeah repeat in your mind\nor as you exhale you can say ram\nso we'll use that mantra\nokay so for the first phase what i want\nyou to do is we're going to do about\nfive breaths so as you breathe in expand\nyour abdomen\npush your belly out\nas you exhale\ncontract the abdomen\nbreathe in\nand as you exhale\ncontract the abdomen\nbreathe in\nand exhale\nbreath number four breathe in\nand exhale and contract\nand breath number five breathe in\nexhale and contract\nand now for the next phase you can go\nahead and continue breathing at a rate\nthat's comfortable\nfor the next phase as you breathe in i\nwant you to imagine the cool air\nentering your nose\nand follow that sensation of coolness\nall the way through your chest into your\nabdomen and even to the point of your\nnavel\nso breathe in\nfeel that air coming in and and going\nall the way from your nose to your navel\nand then exhale\nand feel that heat leaving\nso breathe in again\nand follow almost a channel of energy\nfrom your nose all the way to your navel\nand exhale\nand the reverse flow of warmth\nbreathe in\nfollow the breath down to the navel\nand exhale\nlet the heat rise up and out of you\nit may help to breathe in very slowly to\nreally follow that channel of air\nso very slow breath\nnext and out very slow\nanother slow breath in\nand out\nnow we'll begin the third phase of the\npractice\nthere are two options for this phase\nwe'll kind of do either one or we'll do\nboth\nso now we're going to continue with the\nbreath\nbut as you exhale\ni want you to listen to the sound of the\nexhalation\nand hear the ram\nas your breath leaves your body\nso breathe in\nand then as you exhale hear the\nthe sound of ram in your exhalation\ninhale again\nand exhale\ndo two more rounds at your own pace\nbreathing in slowly\nand exhaling slowly\nfollowing the breath to your navel and\nlistening for the sound of ram\nthis\nand now the second option if that was\ndifficult for you\nis to breathe in\nand as you exhale repeat in your mind\nram\nram\nbreathe in\nand repeat in your mind\n[Music]\nand now try it out loud with me\ntake a deep breath in feel the navel\nexpand\nand instead of exhaling just chant\ntwo more rounds\ndeep breath in\n[Music]\nfeel that vibration in your abdomen\nlast round\nslow deep breath\nraw\n[Music]\nand now in this space\nnotice the freeing from emotion\nnotice how distant your anxieties\nyour fears\neven your joy\nyour pride\nthey're all distant now far away\nthat for most of our life we are filled\nwith emotions\nthey swirl through us\nwreaking havoc on our mind\non our behaviors on our relationships\nthat we try really hard to block out the\ntorrent of what we feel\nwe numb ourselves\nwith videos\nshows\ngames\ndrugs\nall to deal with these little things we\ncall emotions\nyou don't need to do any of those things\ndo this practice\nfocus on the navel\nbreathe into it and chant\nor listen to ram\nor repeat it silently in your head\nduring the practice all three are okay\neach one is suited to a different\ncognitive temperament\ndo you like to chant\nor do you like to listen\nand now give thanks\ngive thanks to yourself for\nparticipating in the\npractice for the universe for giving you\nthis opportunity\nand recognize that it's time to return\nto your regular life\ngo ahead and open your eyes\nso i've missed meditation i've missed\nmeditating with you guys\nnow i don't want to return well then\nyou're doing it right\nso let me explain to y'all for those of\nyou that don't want to return to life\nafter meditation\nnow you understand the point\nso when you don't want to return you\nshould continue to practice go ahead and\nreturn\nand then practice tomorrow and practice\nthe next day and each time you'll return\neach time it'll be a trauma\nand practice and practice and practice\nand then one day something magical will\nhappen\nwhen you return to life you'll bring the\nmeditation with you\nand then even though you're living life\nyou will be in that space of meditation\nand that is the foundation of\nenlightenment\nto be in that space as you live life\nyou'll begin to realize that that's\nactually the most natural way to live\nlife\nyou've forgotten how to do it\nso return\nand one day when you return you're going\nto bring back a souvenir\nand that's the day your life will change"
