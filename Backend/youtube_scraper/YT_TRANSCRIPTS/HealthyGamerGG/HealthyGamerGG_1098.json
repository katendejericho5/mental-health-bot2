    "transcript": "when someone comes in with this like\nlow-grade depression like they're not\nsuicidal or anything but they just like\ndon't feel like doing anything all day\nand are kind of bummed out and like\naren't really happy and like not really\nmotivated and they're just kind of like\nmeh\nlike a large percentage of those people\ni'd say in my practice like 10 of those\npeople are like hypothyroid i'm getting\nconfused okay so here's what we're gonna\ndo i'm gonna give you guys a list a\nconstellation of symptoms\nand then you guys let me know like\nwhether this applies to you okay\nproblems with motivation\nproblems with memory\nproblems with\nexecutive function\nso this is the ability to plan and\nimplement long-term tasks as well as\ndelay gratification\nproblems with attention\nproblems with verbal fluency\ndifficulty learning\ndick uh problems with psychomotor\nefficiency\nso this kind of means like you could say\nfeeling sluggish okay\nso this is part of what we're gonna do\nso\nnext up we have fatigue\num weight gain\ncold intolerance\nconstipation\ndry skin\nmuscle aches\nand menstrual irregularities\nokay and then over here we've also got\nanxiety\ndiarrhea\nweak muscles\nover here we have fatigue\nand then over here we have low energy\ninsomnia\nlow mood\nlow motivation\nlow enjoyment\nand then lastly we've got\nlet's say fatigue\nquick to anger\nfeeling\nsleepy during the day\npoor quality sleep\nas well as problems with\nmotivation\nexecutive function\nthings like that okay so first question\nchat\nis do these things apply to y'all\nokay\nso like these this is a collection of\ndifferent medical conditions\nand what we're gonna do is some\nstatistical so the first thing is like\nwhen i said i wasn't gonna hold back\nthis is me not holding back so if you\nguys are like hey this is a really long\nlist of like lots of complicated things\nwelcome to medical school chat this is\nhow you become a doctor you memorize\nlists and lists and lists of clinical\npresentations\nand then there's also like lab testing\nand figuring out what treatments are and\nstuff like that but these are the things\nthat\nthese are the constellations of symptoms\nokay\nso the first thing is like who wants to\nguess like what is category one\nanyone know\nwhat's your guess for category one okay\ngood so if someone's guessing adhd\ndepression what else we got\nlack of sleep insomnia\nanorexia\nwhat a vitamin deficiency which vitamin\nchat we're in med school now this is\ntwitch school of medicine welcome\neveryone dyslexia\nlupus\nvitamin d deficiency vitamin b12\ndeficiency\nright okay so cool cool chat these are\nthis is so good like look at all of\nthese things that could be\nhere thiamin deficiency good someone's\noh someone's like actually in medical\nschool\nvitamin c deficiency\nautism\nokay guess what chat\nall of these are wrong this is\ntype\n2\ndiabetes\nso what percentage of y'all are\noverweight\nthis is the consequence of insulin\nresistance\nand high blood sugar\nthis is exact so this is exactly what\ni'm saying so all gamers should get\ntheir blood sugar checked\nokay so next question chat\nwhat percentage of people\nhave type 2 diabetes\ndo you guys know\nah see now now\nanswers are all over the place so this\nis ten percent\nwhich means that nine out of ten people\nare going to be healthy and this is\ngoing to be important this is going to\ncome up next okay so just because you're\noverweight you may have some degree of\nof insulin resistance\nyou may have some degree of like high\nblood sugar\nyou may have some of these symptoms\nbut what we're really talking about is\n10 percent of people\nhave type 2 diabetes okay\nnext up\nlet's try again\nso fatigue weight gain cold intolerance\nconstipation dry skin muscle aches and\nmenstrual irregularities what do you all\nthink this is\ni think it's\nglobally\nokay someone's talking about anemia\nhypothyroidism\npots oh my god\nanxiety chat\ndepression ibs crohn's\nokay so like look chat listen to me\nlisten to me\nso a lot of these are really good\nanswers\npregnant\nit's good\nthat's good i'm glad someone mentioned\npregnancy\nso pregnancy so one of the key things i\nlearned in medical school is pregnancy\nis the one diagnosis you should you can\nnever afford to forget about it's\nsomething that you always have to\nassuming you've got a female patient\nright but like it's the one thing you\nall like you can never forget about\npregnancy you always have to think to\nyourself is this person pregnant because\nit changes everything it changes like\nyou know because like medicines can be\ntratagenic it can be weird borreliosis\nno it's not poreless\nbut i like it\num food intolerance no\nso the other thing chat is like do you\nguys get that these are these are all\nlike good things that you should maybe\nget evaluated for right\npuberty no that's not a good one oh my\ngod these are great this is so much\nbetter gout\nno\nso it's right so you guys figured this\none out this is hypothyroidism okay so\nnow this is pretty interesting so what\ndo y'all think\nthe right answer is hypothyroid\nso now the question is what uh\nwhat it was like the second answer to\num what what percentage of the\npopulation do you think is hypothyroid\nwhat do y'all think\nokay so good i think you guys are like\ndoing better about this so there's\nconflicting data so this is where this\nis an important point that i have to\nshare so in my experience there's like\ntrue hypothyroidism and then there's\nsubclinical hypothyroidism\nso the statistics around true\nhypothyroidism some of them are like one\nout of 300 right so really small but\nothers other studies will suggest that\nhypothyroidism is closer to 3.7\nand this could be kind of in the\nsubclinical range\nso\nthe reason that i test tsh for all of my\npatients who have like fatigue and like\nbasically depressive symptoms and like\nthings like weight gain and menstrual\nirregularities is they may not have\nfull-blown hypothyroidism\nbut around let's say four percent so\nlet's say 96 out of 100 people\nare gonna be totally fine and 3.7 or\nfour percent of people will have may\nbenefit some clinically from some kind\nof thyroid supplementation\nokay\nso uh can i explain what the thyroid is\nyeah so the thyroid gland is like\nsituated here in your neck and releases\nsomething called thyroid hormone and\nthyroid hormone does all kinds of things\nin your body so the thing to remember\nabout hormones is a hormone is a\nchemical signal\nthat travels everywhere through your\nbody so the key thing about hormones is\nthat they affect all of your organ\nsystems because they go everywhere and\nthey try to they try to help your body\nwork in concert so another good example\nis adrenaline adrenaline is a hormone so\nwhat is adrenaline on the effect what\neffect does adrenaline have on the gi\nsystem and so this is where i'd ask you\nwhat does the body want to do what does\nthe gi system want to do\nwhen\nyou're in a situation where adrenaline\nis released\nthe answer is that your body your gi\nsystem wants to absolutely shut off\nwhich is exactly what adrenaline does\nbecause if you like you don't want to be\ndigesting food if you're like fighting\nagainst a lion right like you don't want\nto worry about like forming stool and\ndigesting things you want to worry about\nsurvival so if we look at adrenaline it\ndoes things like increase your heart\nrate it does things like increase your\nblood pressure in uh does things like\nmakes your brain think in black and\nwhite and makes it think faster and more\ncatastrophically\nit also does things like uh shut off\nyour gi system essentially\nyou know like all of like the slow stuff\nlike the rest and digest functions of\nyour brain like it doesn't want to mess\nwith any of that stuff it does things\nlike vaso uh vasodilate you know the the\nblood vessels that go to your lungs\nincreases your respiratory rate so\nhormones are chemical compounds that\ntravel throughout your body and\nessentially they coordinate all of the\nbody's response they coordinate all of\nthe different organ systems to sort of\nsucceed at doing one thing\nso thyroid hormone is kind of tricky\nbecause it does like a lot of different\nstuff but essentially like i kind of\nthink about the balance of thyroid\nhormone is like internally like your yin\nand your yang so for example people in\nnorthern climates\nhave higher levels of thyroid hormone\nbecause thyroid hormone is one of the\nthings that increases brown fat\nproduction\nbrown fat is the is how you generate\nheat within your body so if you look at\npeople who are like you know in northern\nclimates they tend to have slightly\nhigher levels of thyroid hormone they\ntend to have more brown fat they tend to\nburn more fat to maintain body\ntemperature which is also why it's kind\nof super interesting because if you look\nat obesity as it relates to different\nclimates\nthe more equatorial climates are more\nprone to obesity and weight gain and as\nyou move north into colder climates you\ntend to have people who overall tend to\nbe a little bit thinner\nand so if you look at hypothyroidism it\ncauses weight gain causes cold\nintolerance whereas if you look at this\none is hyperthyroidism\nbut this is considerably rare\nand so you know hypothyroidism causes\nconstipation hyperthyroidism causes\ndiarrhea hyperthyroidism causes anxiety\nand then like you know hypothyroidism\nbasically causes like depression\nsymptoms of depression and if you think\nabout depression and anxiety one is like\na slow mind one is an overactive mind\nso thyroid hormone is really interesting\nbecause it affects all the different\nlike organs in like really different\nways\nyeah so we'll get to the actual blood\ntests in a second okay\nso next up i know it's kind of weird but\nwe've just got fatigue\nwhat do you all think this is\nare there medications for these yes\nwe're going to get let's finish let's\nfinish diagnosing all these then we'll\ngo on we'll talk about\ntired ibs\nyeah so you so chronic fatigue syndrome\nthat's a new one so we talked about b12\nanemia\nokay\nuh vitamin d\nsure\nhiv sure that's on there\nit's actually a good guess\ninsomnia\nmyocarditis yes\nit can absolutely present his fatigue\nburnout sure\nthere's a lot of stuff so this this one\ntoo so this is b12 deficiency\nso i like this is the other thing about\nmedicine so this is it isn't like\ni mean i'm sort of trying to simplify\nthings but also give you guys some some\nstuff a little bit complicated\nso the key thing about b12 deficiency is\nthat it tends to not present\nas like a bunch of different random\nstuff like you're not going to see\nweight gain with b12 deficiency you're\nnot gonna see like uh you know dry skin\nor muscle atrophy or things like that\nyou may not see quite as much um you\nknow like\nlike the the specificity of these\ndeficits probably have to do with\nthe high level of sugar in your like uh\nyour vascular system and things like\nthat so you get like brain wide effects\nin uh type 2 diabetes which you may get\nfatigue and b12 deficiency but you're\nnot going to get quite like you're not\ngoing to get like a verbal learning\nlike negative impact in b12 deficiency\nso b12 deficiency let me just see what\nhow common it is did i forget to look\nthat oh yeah i didn't even look this up\nso i don't even know it's rare though so\nthe the thing is b12 deficiency can\nsometimes happen in people who are like\nvegans\nbut generally speaking b12 deficiency is\nquite rare\ni don't remember the exact statistics\nbut it's something else to consider\nsuper easy lab test\nokay next up we have um low energy\ninsomnia low mood low motivation\nit's one out of ten thousand\nthat makes sense\nbecause a lot of b12 comes from animal\nproducts\num\nyeah so let's say well let's just say\none out of a hundred so 99 out of 100\npeople will be correct oh we'll be fine\nokay\nso low energy insomnia low mood low\nmotivation low enjoyment\nwhat do y'all think\ndepression okay\ninsomnia okay\nparkinson's\nsometimes actually it's not alzheimer's\nsure so dementia\nlow iron\nanemia\ngenetic disorders nice chat\ndude some real pog poggers out there\ntrauma fibromyalgia\nyeah so this is the cool thing chat no\nno\nthis\nis vitamin d deficiency\nnow vitamin d deficiency numbers are\nreally interesting okay\nbecause five percent of the population\nis vitamin d deficient but 18 percent of\nthe population has sub clinical or less\nthan normal\nso there's like with vitamin d\ndeficiency there's like ranges right so\nit's kind of like a bell curve and so\nlike you know this is actually like 18\npercent of the population and this is\nlike five percent of the population\nand so there's kind of like a sub\nclinical level and then there's like a\nclinically deficient level and so the\npeople who are like super clinically\ndeficient which is still five percent of\nthe population will have severe amounts\nof this and about 20 of the population\nby the way\ni think maybe that the 18\nnumber has something to do with using\nthe internet's\nand playing video games and not going\noutside\nyou think maybe it has something to do\nwith what you're watching the twitch\nwhat do you think\nright\nso what this means is let's say that\n80 out of 100 people don't have to worry\nabout this okay\nso this is so what i really like about\nthis is that you guys are picking up on\na lot of different stuff right like and\nlike you all could have any one of these\nthings\nright like chat you could be pregnant\nlike you may have gout\nit's not something i was expecting right\nso anemia is another big one i actually\ndidn't even include indeed on this i\nkind of it was on my other list but i\nthought that that would be covering too\nmany things\nright so you could have all these things\ni mean or any of these things that\npeople are tossing out i didn't even\ntalk about so the other thing there's a\nspoiler alert by the way i don't know if\nyou guys got this but none of these are\nmental illnesses like you guys get this\nlike these are not psychiatric diagnoses\nthat's the whole point of this lecture\nis that all of these mental effects that\nwe attribute to adhd anxiety depression\ni have trouble sleeping the truth is\nthat a lot of this stuff can be caused\nby physiologic things and this is why\nyou should go get a lab test this is why\nyou should go see your doctor that's the\nwhole point of this lecture\nokay next up\noh yeah okay\nso\nwhat do y'all think about this one\nhmm\nwhat is that what do you guys think\nfatigue quick to anger feeling sleepy\nduring the\npoor quality sleep mode problems with\nmotivation and problems with executive\ndysfunction malnutrition\napnea\nbipolar\nokay chlamydia is i'm not even gonna put\nthat gaming addiction\nadhd\nalcoholism\nwe already have apnea here so we can say\ninsomnia sure\nprotein deficiency\nmarijuana use\nyeah so like this is the thing right so\ni want you guys to really pay attention\nto all of the things that you guys are\ntalking about that are mental so this\none is sleep apnea\nsomeone got it\ngood job okay so i even i don't think i\neven remembered\ndid i even i don't have the prevalence\nof sleep apnea what's the prevalence of\nsleep apnea epidemiology here we go\nokay so this is interesting so 15 to 30\npercent this is staggering in north\namerica in men\nand about 10 to 15 percent in women\nso this means that 80 let's just call it\n80 out of 100 people will be totally\nfine we didn't even get to anemia\nso anemia also causes\nfatigue\nprimarily weakness\nyou know you'll see like pale skin\ncan sometimes cause like gi problems\nright and anemia is pretty common too so\nlet's see what the\nprevalence of anemia is\nuh okay what's the prevalence of anemia\ncan someone find out for me\nlet me look real quick\noh anemia affects 1.62 billion people\n24.8 percent of the population that's\nstaggering\nso we're saying that about 75 out of 100\npeople are fine with this okay\nso\nuh that's globally though i suspect i\nsuspect that in developed countries the\nprevalence is somewhat lower\nanemia also is more likely to affect\nwomen primarily due to menstruation\nokay so let's say this is globally let's\nsee let's see if we can find out in um\nlet's\nin the see\num so\nthe overall prevalence of anemia in the\nu.s is about 5.6\nbut i don't know if you guys know this\nbut not everyone\nin chat is from the united states\nstaggering\nor a developed country\nokay\nso\nhere's the big takeaway\ni want you guys to pay attention to like\neveryone who thought like oh this is\nadhd this is anxiety\nthis is insomnia oh dr k how do i find\nmotivation how do i find this how do i\nfind that\nyou know like these are like everyone's\nlike oh i'm depressed i'm anxious the\ntruth is that there's a physiologic\nlikelihood of all of these things\nactually happening okay\nso\nnow what we're gonna do if somebody\nwants to help me do some math\nis we're going to look at so how like\nwhat's the the\nrough statistical analysis that we want\nto do to see how likely is any one of\ny'all\nto have none of these problems\ndoes that make sense because now like\nokay sure we can say you have a 5 chance\nof this 18 chance of this\nand how do we kind of do this\ncalculation right so what we have to do\nis we have to multiply\n9 10 for our first condition\nby\n96 times\n96 over 100\nfor our next condition\ntimes\n99 over 100\ntimes\nlet's use the subclinical number because\nthat's what i think is actually really\nimportant this population 80 over 100\ntimes\nwas that 80 over 100 again yeah\n80 over 100\ntimes and then you guys can decide\nwhether we want to do 95 over 100\nso who can do this for me\nright so\n9 times 9.6 times 9.9\ntimes\n8 or 0.8\nsorry hold on 0.9 0.9 0.9\nwhat is this it's 52\nokay so i want you guys to think about\nthis\n52\nof people have none of this\nwhich means that any given person out\nthere has a 48 chance\nof having one of these problems do you\nguys get that\nso it doesn't matter right now there are\n4\n335 people watching the stream\nwe may upload it to youtube at that\npoint so if you're watching on youtube i\nwant you to look at the total number of\nviews that the video has\ncut that number in half and that is the\nnumber of people who watch this video\nwho has one of these conditions\naccording to a rough statistical\nanalysis do you guys get that like this\nis huge\nthis is\ngigantic\nand so if y'all have these problems if\nyou have difficulty with motivation if\nyou have difficulty with anhedonia the\ninability to experience pleasure if you\nfeel tired during the day\nif you feel weak if you feel like you\nhave difficulty with your memory if you\nhave difficulty planning and executing\nactions\nfollowing through is what executive\nfunction basically means\nif you're constipated if you have\ninsomnia\nif you're quick to anger if you feel\nweak during the day\nif you're a noob when you play dota you\nmay have one of these conditions right\nso we're talking about\ntype 2 diabetes which can absolutely\nimpair your your negative function type\n2 diabetes is really fascinating so when\nyou have a high level of insulin\nresistance\nas you have a high level of insulin\nresistance insulin is the hormone that\ncauses your your cells to take up blood\nsugar right so you remove blood sugar\nfrom the bloodstream it goes into the\ncell gets either used by the stellar\ncell or stored as fat\nso when you're resistant to insulin it\nincreases the amount of blood sugar\ntraveling through your body\nthe unfortunate thing is that high\nlevels of blood sugar traveling in your\nbloodstream is very very bad for you it\ncauses all kinds of vascular damage\nbecause your blood your blood vessels\nare not designed to have high levels of\nsugar like floating through them for a\nlong time\nso there are studies on type 2 diabetes\nwhich show that after 18 years of being\na type 2 diabetic you'll have all kinds\nof these like pro-dementia like you'll\nlose limbs and things like that like i'm\nnot kidding it's not an exaggeration\nbut then people started to wonder okay\nwhat about is it is it a long-term\neffect or or let's look at a shorter\ntime span so another study looked at\nfour years so if i'm if i'm type 2\ndiabetic for four years what kind of\ncognitive impact do i get turns out it's\nactually quite bad\nnow you won't get dementia but there\nwill be a lot of like temporary\ncognitive effects\nthat will happen while like your blood\nsugar is high and then people even did\nstudies that were cross-sectional and\nfor those of you don't know what that\nmeans it just looks at a single point in\ntime\nso we take a thousand people and we\nmeasure their blood sugar and then we\nmeasure their cognitive capabilities and\nthey still found impairment no long-term\neffects just one like a cross-section of\nyoung people actually maybe some\nlong-term damage in there because we\ndon't know how long those people had\nhigh blood sugar levels but i think the\npopulation was like you know young\nadults\nso it's not even long-term effects but\neven temporary effects of blood sugar\nare quite bad\nokay so type 2 diabetes is like super\nprevalent 10 of the population\nthen we move on to uh you know other\nthings like hypothyroidism i think is a\nreally good example of like a super\nsilent problem that gets missed a lot\nespecially like the subclinical\nhypothyroidism where they're not\nblatantly hypothyroid they're not like\nyou know their hair isn't falling out\nand things like that that's what happens\nwhen your thyroid levels super low\nbut as it gets like you know as you get\nto subclinical levels like not like a\nyou know a complete deficiency but like\nlow levels that's when we see this like\nlow-grade depression stuff is the best\nway i can describe it as a psychiatrist\nwhen someone comes in with this like\nlow-grade depression like they're not\nsuicidal or anything but they just like\ndon't feel like doing anything all day\nand are kind of bummed out and like\naren't really happy and like not really\nmotivated and they're just kind of like\nmeh\nlike a large percentage of those people\ni'd say in my practice like 10 of those\npeople are like hypothyroid and i just\nstart them on thyroid medication and\nthey're like\nnormal they feel amazing they're like oh\nmy god\ni never realized that people like woke\nup every day and had energy\nthis is completely op\nokay\nnext up hyperthyroidism so that's quite\nrare but that can be one of the causes\nof anxiety so b12 deficiency is\nsomething that is also quite rare so\nlike maybe one out of 100 people or even\nless than that i would imagine but we\nare seeing increases in b12 deficiency\nespecially due to\num you know changes in diet so like a\nlot of our b12 comes from animal\nproducts there are some autoimmune\nconditions which can also cause b12\ndeficiency which i want to say i've seen\nmore recently i don't know if it's\nactually like on the rise\nit's still something that's super easy\nto get checked so just get it checked\nand by the way what you guys want to\ncheck in thyroid level is tsh\num\nand then we get to\napnea so this is another really common\nthing\nuh that oh sorry let's go to vitamin d\nlevels like so the next thing to check\nis vitamin d so vitamin d levels are\nalso associated with poor outcomes\nrelated to covid messes up your immune\nsystem has a lot to do with calcium\nmetabolism and like building bones and\nabsorbing calcium from the gut and like\nall kinds of like random stuff vitamin d\nis made by sunlight so when we get\nexposed to sunlight our body takes that\nsunlight and constructs vitamin d out of\nit\npeople who have darker skin color tend\nto have a less efficient vitamin d\nproduction\nso if you're like living in scandinavia\nand you're like pale as snow\nthen you don't actually need that much\nsun exposure to make a lot of vitamin d\nif you're from india or you know south\namerica or something like that at least\nthe you know\nequatorial parts of the world or you're\nfrom africa\nyou may need a higher amount of vitamin\nd uh sun exposure to create vitamin d\nand that's just because in those\nclimates there's a lot of sun so like\nour machinery doesn't need to be as\nefficient\nnext up we've got sleep apnea this is\nthe silent silent\nreal problem okay so there isn't a lab\nand there's not like a blood test for\nsleep apnea what you have to do is a\nsleep study\nbut the good news is that most sleep\napnea is like you know you can kind of\nget through a good to a good diagnostic\nthreshold through an interview\nso like if you snore if you have like a\nthick neck i know it sounds kind of\nweird but people who are overweight\npeople who snore a lot people who have a\nthick neck\num they can actually have sleep apnea\nand in men it's like 15 to 30 percent of\nmen have this that like it's nuts and\nsleep apnea is basically like\nyou know imagine playing a video game\nwhere you never get to like\nrest right play dark souls without ever\nusing\na bonfire\nand if you play dark souls without ever\nusing a bonfire\nthat is what living life with sleep nap\napnea is like\nyou never get to like you never get back\nto 100\nand so sleep apnea is one of the most\nthe problem is that people can function\nlike people are awesome right like\nyou're a chad at dark souls and you're\nso awesome and you're so skilled but boy\nis the game like super hard like life is\njust hard when you have sleep apnea you\ncan hold a job you can kind of study but\nlike it just doesn't like your brain is\nlike a colander and knowledge just leaks\nout of it right it just doesn't store\nthings\nyou feel tired all the time you get\nsleepy you're like kind of yawning all\nday and like pounding like coffee and\nstuff like that and then you fall asleep\nat night and then like you wake up and\nyou don't feel rested so you can\ndiscover a lot of this stuff in a\nclinical interview that's why you guys\nshould go see a doctor you can do a\nsleep study then if you get on a cpap\nwhich is a continuous positive airway\npressure machine it'll prevent you from\nbeing apnic and you'll wake up and\nyou'll feel rested in the morning which\nis also like super op the ability to\nfeel rested if you all don't feel rested\nin the morning you're living life on\nhard mode\nanemia is the next one so anemia is a\ngood example like you know so sometimes\nwe'll\nwomen are sometimes more prone to it\nbecause they menstruate\num you know but anyone can be anemic\ngenerally speaking in developed\ncountries it tends to be like lower\nbecause we have high consumption of like\nmeat intake and other sources of like\nhealthy iron so anemia is an iron\ndeficiency or a lack of red blood cells\nin your body so blood cells are like\nliterally carry oxygen to all of your\ndifferent parts of your body so it's\nbasically like your fuel delivery system\nand so what that means when you're\nanemic is that like your body is not\ngetting enough fuel to function properly\nso people feel super tired\nthey feel like weak and things like that\nso everyone you know nowadays is like oh\ni feel owned right like i'm just like\ni'm just owned today like i don't feel\nlike doing anything there's a lot of\nphysiologic things that can contribute\nto this\nand this is something i've learned the\nhard ways like a lot of these people in\nesports like they have these problems\ntoo so i want you guys to think about\nthis unless all of you think about your\nfavorite team and like ask yourself do\nthese people have a team doctor when was\nthe last time they saw a doctor when was\nlast time they had a blood test\nbecause if the answer was like it was\nfive years ago there's like a 48 chance\nthat they have one of these problems\nthat is a staggering it's not a perfect\nway to look at statistics because you\nknow you can have more than one and\nthings like that and some people are you\nknow\num\nand so like\nit's staggering like 48 of people will\nhave one of these problems so 48 of like\npeople in chat will potentially have one\nof these problems 48 of people who watch\nthis video so take the number of views\ncut it in half and that's how many\npeople have these problems\nit's crazy\nso there's a lot of low-hanging fruit\nin terms of improving your life has\nnothing to do with 99 of what dr k talks\nabout has nothing to do with finding\nyour inner whatever has nothing to do\nwith like stages of change has nothing\nto do with insomnia has nothing to do\nwith depression nothing to do with\nanxiety nothing to do with like some\nscars nothing to do with meditation\nmeditation ain't gonna fix this by the\nway\nit has nothing to do with any of this\nstuff it's physiologic\nand what i want you all to appreciate is\nwhen i show you the list of these\nsymptoms everyone's tossing out\npsychiatric diagnoses everyone is\ntossing out psychiatric diagnoses oh\nit's adhd it's depression it's anxiety\nthis is part of the problem with i think\nmental health in this country why is\nmental health getting worse despite the\nfact that medical science is advancing\nit's because a lot of our mental health\nproviders have no training in physical\nmedicine\nthink about that for a second right so\nthe average psychologist or social\nworker gets trained in all kinds of\nstuff that we actually get less training\nin they're actually really good at that\nkind of stuff they actually get more\ntraining in psychotherapy than an md\ndoes\nbut 48 of people that walk into their\noffice will have one of these conditions\nand generally speaking when i think\nabout the average therapist i don't\nthink they're writing lab slips\nright so it's like kind of problematic\nanyway it's not really their\nresponsibility because you're i you know\nyour primary care physician should be\ntaking care of this stuff for you right\nso your gp or general practitioner like\nyou're you're just running the build\ndoctor should be evaluating for the\nstuff\nbut as a psychiatrist i want to say that\nthere's a staggering number of people\nwho walk into my office\nthinking they have a mental health\nproblem and it turns out to be a\nphysiologic problem\nand then you just start them on the\nright medication and it's like they're\nfine and sometimes it's not even\nmedication right in the case of cpap it\ncan be\nit's like a machine in the case of type\n2 diabetes it can be like dietary change\nand exercise\nin the case of anemia it can be dietary\nchange so you don't even need medication\nfor this stuff in the case of thyroid\nhormone usually need you know medication\nfor that\nbut\nquestions\nis it okay to go to a psychiatrist yeah\nso a psychiatrist is really the one that\nyou should hold responsible if they miss\nsomething like this\nto be honest because they're the ones\nwho actually get trained in it right\nso social workers and like psychologists\ndon't do it aren't trained in physical\ndifferential diagnosis they're trained\nin like psychiatric differential\ndiagnosis they're really good at that\ndo you need medication for subclinical\nhypothyroidism you can that's why you\nshould talk to your doctor about it\nright\nso it really depends if you're having\nsymptoms what i would sort of recommend\nlike i'll treat people with subclinical\nhypothyroidism with medication usually\ni'll give it a shot if they're having\nthe cl the clinical symptoms and it's\nlike they're like yeah i feel like owned\nall the time it's like okay let's start\nyou on a super low dose and see if it\nhelps\nand some of them come in and they say\nlike yeah it's not really helping we can\nadd a little bit more we like recheck\ntheir levels and that's like the\npractice of medicine so you guys should\nreally go it's not just like a legal\ndisclaimer i'm telling y'all that if you\nguys are suffering from this stuff go\nand actually see a doctor because they\ncan help you with these things you all\ndon't have to play dark souls on\nhardcore mode like you just don't have\nto you shouldn't play life on hardcore\nmode because you just have one it's a\nhardcore anyway you only get one shot at\nit so like you got to play it as best as\nyou can and optimize everything\ndoes weight loss help with snoring and\nsleep apnea absolutely\nyeah but i'm a gamer so so that's a\ngreat point trig etheridge\nthat's literally why we're doing this\nlecture\nbeing a gamer is no longer an excuse you\nguys deserve better\nthis idea of the degenerate gamer is\nlike the lowest common denominator that\ni also fall into assuming like\nthe gamers like they're not gonna go\nlike do anything\nthey're gamers there's just energy\ndrinks and being no like go outside like\ngo see a doctor\nlike you deserve better dude\nyou can be a gamer like that's why we're\nhealthy gamer we're not like abstinence\nfrom gaming\nwe're like just like go and see a doctor\nlike one day out of the year\ngo and do a one hour appointment with a\ndoctor out of 365 days in the year\ngo get this you spend a second hour like\n15 20 minutes getting a blood test 15 20\nminutes talking to your doctor\ngetting a prescription for maybe like\nhyperthyroidism\nor hypothyroidism go pick it up take\nyour pill every day and then play lol\nfor eight hours a day\nthat's fine like i'm not saying i'm just\nsaying like use two or three hours over\nthe entire year\nand then continue being your degenerate\ngamer self like that's all it takes\nand then the cool thing is you'll be\nmore motivated so then like it'll be\neasier to stop playing whatever you're\nplaying\nyeah so someone's saying i'm in the\npre-contemplative stage of seeing a\ndoctor absolutely dude\nthat's why this is awareness raising\nright\nso well said someone's paying attention\nchad\nyeah encouraging everyday drug use while\nalso maintaining other drugs like\ncannabis is bad every day absolutely man\nbecause i know this is kind of weird so\npeople like oh like he's encouraging\ndrug use and like but this is drugs so i\nknow it's kind of weird but what i'm\nbasing it on is this thing called\nscience\nright where we can do studies\nand we can take people who have sleep\napnea who are literally for those of you\nwho don't know\nwhat i mean i guess there isn't a\nmedication for sleep apnea so maybe it's\na bad\nrecommendation a bad choice\nbut like the other thing about a lot of\nis that you don't need medication for\nthem right but like that's why we use\nscience like we use science to evaluate\nobjectively\nwhat is the crap that you're gonna put\nin your mouth like what is the pill\nyou're gonna take and like what are the\nbenefits and what are the hindrances\nand so you should absolutely be\nscientific about it i'm not just\nadvocating it i'm not saying all drugs\nare created equally i'm not taking\ntelling people to take like chemotherapy\nout here\nright because chemotherapy is way more\ndamaging than cannabis\nand yet it is still sometimes an\nappropriate recommendation\nso it's about like understanding science\nand understanding who you are and\ninstead of like some kind of resistance\nto like\nit's a statement of resistance\nthat i can advocate for some drugs and\nnot advocate for others yes that is like\nliterally my job is people come to me\nand i will advocate for some drugs\ndepending on their situation and say\nlike yeah maybe you shouldn't take that\nright it's like hmm\nif someone comes into my office and is\nhypothyroid i'm not going to recommend\nthat they take birth control\nright because it's like especially if\nit's a dude it's like it's not going to\nhelp you\ndrugs have their time in their place and\ncannabis is included we talked about\nthat there's a time and place for\ncannabis but generally speaking it tends\nto be used recreationally\nso\ndo i have to quit smoking cannabis see\nthere is a precontemplative statement do\ni have to no you don't have to\nyou don't have to\nlike no one's i mean like i don't know\nwhat the legal situation is where you\nlive and where you are and what the\navailability is\nit's just\nyou don't have to\nthe question is like what's it doing for\nyou\nand how is it hurting you\nthat's the real way like even when it\ncomes to gaming right it's like\nwe're not saying you should be abstinent\nfrom all gaming like we even like i play\ngames on stream\nbut i don't you know\ntoday instead of playing dota which i\nwould love to do because by the way\nthere's a new hero new patch so it's\nvery exciting\nbut it's like doing what's important\nright so like what's more important like\nteaching chat that 48 of y'all\nmay have one of these problems or like\nplaying one game of dota because the\ncost is the same it's one hour of my\ntime\nso no i mean no one has to give up\nmarijuana like i've had patients who are\ndying of like alcoholic liver disease\nand they don't want to give up alcohol\nlike that it's your choice right i'm not\ngonna make you do it i don't think it's\nthe right one\nyou know your kids will miss you but\nit's ultimately it's like your choice\nyou're the one who has to decide what to\nput into your body and i've seen this\nchoice on the other end of the spectrum\ntoo where like sometimes i'll have\npatience with schizophrenia\nand i like prescribed clozapine and boy\nis that a tough choice it's a tough\nchoice in the opposite direction this is\na medication that will cause you to gain\n80 pounds\nyou will literally start drooling\nand it will be hard for you to write\npoetry\nthe upside\nis that\nyour delusions will stop your\nhallucinations will stop you'll be able\nto like wake up at a decent hour on a\ndaily basis and be able to interact with\nother human beings\nand i've had some patients who are like\nyeah like i'd rather i'd rather take the\npoetry and get hospitalized four times a\nyear and i've had other patients who are\nlike it's really sucks i'm really sad\ni'm it sucks that i have to take this\nmedication\nbut i think i want to stay out of the\nhospital and like\nbe able to have a dog because when i go\nto the hospital there's no one to take\ncare of my dog\nit's tough\nit's really tough\nso i think it's\nbut that's i mean that's medicine and\nthat's life like i don't know that\nthere's ever you know\nan always good choice the closest thing\ni can think of\nin terms of an intervention that works\nfor just about every human being is\nmeditation which is precisely why i\nteach it at the end of like most streams\nokay"
