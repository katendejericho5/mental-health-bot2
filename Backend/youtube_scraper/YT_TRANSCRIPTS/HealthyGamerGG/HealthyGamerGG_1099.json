    "transcript": "teenage son\n16m addicted to video game screams now\nhas headaches and does nothing\nso backstory my son 16 always loved\ngaming his older sister bought him a ps4\nseveral years ago as a gift and he had\nan iphone for several years too wasn't\nreally a problem until last year before\nthe pandemic started then he started\nmissing school because he wasn't feeling\nwell was hard to wake up seemed moody we\nfinally figured out that it was because\nhe wasn't going to bed at a good time\nstaying\nup late playing games or watching stuff\non his phone\ngrade started to suffer as a result too\nthe pandemic hit and he pretty much gave\nup on school for the rest of the\nsemester\nonly doing the bare minimum summer came\nand we didn't change things up too much\nhis mother and i are divorced and he\nspends part of the week with me he\nspends part of the week with me and part\nof the week with her in the fall we\ndecided to keep him home and do\nhomeschooling because of the pandemic\nthat only lasted a month or so before he\nfell\nback on his old habits i grounded him\nfor from his ps4 and switch his iphone\nhad broken by this point so he didn't\nhave a cell phone any longer we had been\nworking with a therapist for my grandson\nso we talked to her about my son\nshe suggested that he start earning back\nhis privileges but he had to admit to he\nhad to admit to what caused the loss of\nprivileges and came\nand come up with ways to earn the back\nhe refused\ni've shared custody of my ex with my\nex-wife she thought i was too strict and\nonly went along with the grounding from\nvideo games while he is with her she was\nstill letting him watch tv\nand he was the one that was manipulating\nher into letting him stay home from\nschool for the most part\nhe missed the most school when he was\nwith her and barely missed when he was\nwith me\nafter that start of the new year he\nclaimed he had a headache that never\nwent away that made it to where he\ncouldn't do any school work at all so he\nclaims\ntook him to doctors and a headache\nspecialist and didn't find anything\nmedically wrong\nstarted prescribing some some meds to\ntry to get rid of the headaches but\nnothing has really worked or so he\nclaims\nmostly still on a messed up sleep\nschedule despite us telling him he\nneeded to try to go to bed\nat a decent time etc i just found out\nthat he's been sneaking video games by\nplaying on a game boy he had that i\nforgot about because he's been getting\naway with that that's why i figured he\ndidn't come\ncare to earn back his screen time\nnow i'm also\nnow i also suspect about his headaches\nwhether he actually has them or if\nthey're just as or if they're as bad as\nhe says they are he refuses to go to\ntherapy i mean right now he pretty much\nhas gotten his way he does zero school\nwork watches tv at his mom's and\napparently now has been playing game boy\nwhen he's over here and just sleeping\nweird hours\nbecause of the lying and hiding his\nhabit or just trying to find another fix\ni'm afraid that he'll just find\nsomething else to do once i take his\ngame boy away and forcing him to keep\nhis door open only allowing him to sleep\nin his room etc is that really gonna\nsolve anything just looking for ideas on\nhow to deal with this his mom thinks i'm\ntoo strict and also suffers from chronic\npain herself so she tends to go easier\non him and as a result he would just\nrather stay with her than come over to\nmy place when i'm supposed to have him\ni don't know if he's too prideful or\nashamed to admit when he's messed up and\nthat's why he refuses to talk to someone\nelse or even to try to earn his screen\nprivileges back he also feels he's\ntreated unfairly because his older\nbrother had more way more freedom in\nthat we didn't regulate his screen use\nas much but he was getting good grades\nworking a job and having\nextracurriculars\ni've told my son that he would have the\nsame freedom but he would have to show\nme he could be responsible to and\nclearly his addictions to screens was\naffecting the rest of his life\nis it time\nfor even more hard love and more\npunishment slash monitoring i can\nmonitor him when i'm awake but all bets\nare off when i'm in bed or when he's\nover at his mom's\nwe've tried to get him to do other\nthings with us but he refuses for the\nmost part\nokay\nwhat do you all think about that\num\nso let's start by analyzing the post a\nlittle bit and i'm going to point out\nsome language to y'all okay\nand i think this post is a prime example\nof like how we try to work at\nhealthygamer\nso the first thing is that sun has\nalways loved gaming okay\num\nwasn't a problem until the pandemic\nthis is going to be important right\num\nwasn't feeling well we finally figured\nit out\nokay\nso dad thinks he has an answer\nand then grades started to suffer the\npandemic hit he pretty much gave up on\nschool only doing the bare minimum\nokay there's divorced parents that's an\nimportant piece\num\ni grounded him so dad once again so dad\nis like i'm going to ground you because\ni figured it out and gaming is the\nproblem so you're going to punish him\nright\nso\nwe've been working with a therapist for\nmy grandson she suggested that he start\nearning back his privileges but he had\nto admit what caused the the\nloss of his privileges he refused so\ndoesn't want to do therapy\nbut\nthere may be a good reason for that why\nare people resistant so shared custody\nwith ex-wife this is going to be\nimportant\nshe thought\ni was too strict while he's with her she\nwas letting him watch tv and he was the\none manipulating her oh this is\ninteresting\nso sun is manipulative\nright\nat the start of the new now son has a\nheadache\nokay\nso they couldn't find anything medically\nwrong\nand then the dad uses the word claims\nor so he claims or so he claims\nright\nmostly still on a messed up sleep\nschedule i just found out that he's been\nsneaking video games\ni'm also suspect about the headaches\ni mean right now he's pretty much gotten\nhis way\nso here's the gotten his way what does\nthat imply to y'all\nso\nhe's gonna find another fix\nright i'm afraid he'll just do something\nelse\nforcing him to keep his door open\nright\nhis mom thinks i'm too strict\nso she tends to go easier on him\nand now he doesn't even want to come\nover to dad's what's dad's what's dad's\nunderstanding of why he doesn't want to\ncome over\noh it's because my son can't manipulate\nme i'm not going to get manipulated\nheaven forbid that mom actually like\ntries to understand her son\nlike that couldn't be it maybe son\nactually really likes mom's place not\nbecause she she lets him manipulate her\nbecause she has empathy\nand tries to support him\ni don't know if he's too prideful or\nashamed when he's\nto admit when he's messed up\ni think that there's a third option here\nas well maybe\nmaybe he's not maybe he hasn't messed up\nright because when did these problems\nstart\nthey started during the pandemic\nand that's why he refuses to talk\nsomeone\ni don't know if he's too\nprideful or shamed so this is the crux\nof our program\nso if you don't know what's going on\nwith your kids why don't you ask them\nhere's a crazy idea\nmaybe you should ask\nand that's why he refuses to talk to\nsomeone else or even try to earn his\nscreen privileges back maybe he refuses\nto earn his screen privileges back or\ntry to play your game because it's a\ngame that he's not going to win\nright\nhe also feels he's being treated\nunfairly\nso\nhere's here's what i'd say\nthis is a problem where the sun is\nbasically doing what the dad taught them\nto do that's what's going on here so dad\ndiagnoses a problem and doesn't really\ncare what anyone else thinks\nright we're not at least we don't see it\nin the post we're not hearing a whole\nlot of like dialogue or trying to\nunderstand dad diagnoses the problem\nyou're staying up too late therefore\nthis is going to change\nbased on what i want to do i'm just\ngoing to implement what i want to happen\nso if the grades aren't good i'm going\nto ground you i'm going to take the ps4\nand switch away\nand so the the dad is just going to find\nsome way to like\ndo what he thinks and it's a power\nstruggle so this isn't a 12 year old\nanymore this is a 16 year old 16 year\nolds have opinions they have thoughts\nthey also have struggles\ni'm not hearing so what i'm hearing is\nthat generally speaking the pandemic has\nbeen terrible for most people's mental\nhealth addictions across the board have\ngone up depression has gone up anxiety\nhas gone up\nand so people it's tough\nand yet what's being\nhappening is dad is now distrusting\ndoesn't believe what a son is doing and\nthey're like in war they're antagonistic\nthey're fighting against each other\nand so they're in a competition where\ndad is like i'm gonna take your game\naway and kid is like i'm gonna sneak a\ngame\nso the kid is now learning how to\nso you guys get that like the basic\nproblem is there's no dialogue there's\nno attempted understanding there's just\ni have my goal and i'm gonna move\ntowards it no matter what you do or how\nyou feel so no matter what happens like\nif you don't do what i say you're gonna\ndo i'm gonna take away your video game\ni'm gonna increase the monitoring more\ni'm gonna restrict you more and so the\nkid is playing the same game because\nthat's what the kid has been taught when\nyou have a problem with someone you\ndon't actually ask them hey what's going\non here you don't engage in dialogue\nthat's why the kid is resistant to\ntherapy\nright because it's like\ndialogue is not valuable in this\nrelationship and so the kid is gonna do\nthe same thing\nso dad is like i'm gonna find a way to\nget to where i think this relationship\nneeds to go that's the overarching\napproach that dad has\nit's not about understanding what's\ngoing on with the kid it's all about\nthis is what you need the problem is the\nsleep schedule the problem is the video\ngame so let me take that away let me\ntake that away let me take that away let\nme fix it dad is a fixer\nand as dad has fixed\nmore and more things what's happened\nstarted out with like doing the bare\nminimum now the kid has headaches and\ncan't do any schoolwork good job dad\ndid a good job\nright because the more you're fixing the\nproblem\nthe worse things are getting like what\ndo you think about that\nit's interesting\nfix it more\nright so dad is demonstrating a lot of\ngood stuff he's posting he's asking for\nhelp he's like i don't know if if this\nis actually like gonna work should i do\nmore tough love\nthat's good dad's making an effort\nright\nand so when dad teaches you hey when you\nhave a problem you just need to use\nwhatever tools at your disposal to fix\nit\nthat's what the kid is doing as well\nmaybe the kid is depressed maybe the kid\nis struggling in school maybe the\nproblems aren't the video games\nthemselves but that it's really hard to\nstay motivated maybe kid has adhd\nand he's like potentially failing out of\nschool and it's really hard for him so\nhe uses the video games to cope\nand if you take away the ps4 and you\ntake away the switch like let me explain\nsomething to you\nif you've taken away your son's ps4 and\nswitch and they're playing freaking game\nboy\nin the middle of the night video game\naddiction is not the problem\nright if you're resorting to like it's\nhard to get addicted to a game boy\nlike it's really hard to get addicted to\ngame boy am i wrong there chat like do\nyou guys get that\nthat's using gaming as coping\nit's not like he's playing some gotcha\ngame right which is like\ndesigned to addict people\nit's not that's not what he's playing\nit's not like some endless mmo it's\nfreaking game boy\nso if your kid is addicted to video game\ngame boy like\nvideo game addiction is not i would\nguess 99 of the time gaming addiction is\nnot the problem and so what the kid is\ngoing to do is he's going to find he's\ngoing to play the same game that dad is\nteaching him to play which is when you\nbelieve something you don't engage with\nsomeone there's no compromise there's my\nway or the highway that's dad's approach\nand so the kid is like okay if the game\nthat we're playing this is what you're\nsubconsciously teaching your child my\nway or the highway and the kid is gonna\nhe's gonna do the same thing so i'm\ngonna steal the game boy i'm going to\nsneak it i'm not going to engage with\nyou i'm not going to talk with you i'm\nnot going to engage with the therapist\nbecause what is the background of\ntherapy\njust think about this the therapist is\nlike he needs to understand why he's\nlost his privileges what the [ __ ]\nthe therapist isn't even bothering to\nask why are you playing games in the\nfirst place\nthe why why do you think the kid isn't\ngoing into therapy it's because the kid\ndoesn't have a voice it's like therapy\nis being used as a tool of manipulation\nand control by the dad\nhe needs to articulate why he's been a\nbad boy and we took the games away then\nhe'll get them back\nmaybe the purpose of therapy is to ask\nthe kid\nwhat's going on man\nwhy are you playing the games\nare you struggling what's it been like\nbeing at home\nlike maybe start there maybe start by\nactually engaging with your child and\nasking them what's going on with you it\nseems like you're struggling can i help\nmaybe ask your kid can i help instead of\nhere let me fix it for you and punish\nyou\nwith a side of punishment\nhere's here's a here's a main course\nthere's a fix-it burger with a side of\npunishment\nmaybe ask can i help what's going on try\nto understand\nbecause now the kid has figured out the\ntrump card okay\npsychosomatic illness so i've seen this\nso much so like\nyou know i i arguably i specialize in a\nlot of things but i'd say like at some\npoint 30 or 40 percent of like the\nreferrals that i got were people with\npsychosomatic illness\nso psychosomatic illness is like one of\nthese things where there's some kind of\nsymptom and we'll talk about this in a\nsecond there's like some kind of symptom\nor like illness that like can't be\nmedically explained so headaches are a\ngood example of this brain fog is\nanother good example of this ibs or\nirritable bowel syndrome uh pots\npostural orthostatic\ntachycardic syndrome\nis another good example of this\nvarious autoimmune conditions\nfibromyalgia cprs\nsorry crps complex regional pain\nsyndrome\nlike eczema\nheadaches\nlike these are all things that are\npsychosomatic in nature\nand so what happens is when like when\nthe mind suffers\nand has no coping mechanism or outlet\nfor that suffering it manifests in the\nbody right there's even like physiologic\nevidence for this we'll go if you guys\nwant to hear about that we'll talk about\nthat in a second the mechanism through\nwhich these things happen and so as the\nparent takes away the coping mechanism\ncoping back you're taking away the\ncopium\nand punishing them more\nright then there's a conflict between\nlike mom and dad\nand then the kid starts getting sick\ni've seen this like a thousand times\nand now the kids got the trump card the\nkid doesn't want it's not about video\ngames the kid doesn't want to go to\nschool\nthe kid is afraid that he can't go to\nschool the kid is maybe in love with\nsomeone that doesn't like them back\nmaybe has adhd and is struggling in\nschool maybe he's afraid that they're\ngoing to be doomed maybe he's afraid\nthat they won't get get into good\ncollege and they they'll be like judged\nby everyone around them\nmaybe his kid is intimidated because he\nknows that older brother is a gamer and\ndoes extracurriculars in his has big\nshoes to fill and younger brother knows\nthere's no way i can ever live up to the\nshadow that my older brother has left\nand so like he's like oh i need an\nexcuse for my poor performance so now\ni'm medically unable i can't do homework\nanymore\nheadache\nthe kid is going to win this game this\nis something that parents need to\nunderstand the kids are going to win\nthey're going to win because the next\nthing that parents do is they send them\noff to like wilderness camps\nright it's a combination of fixing and\npunishment\nthat's what parents in this situation do\nand so like it's all about power\ndynamics it's not about collaboration or\ncooperation\nit's about i'm going to force you to do\nwhat is best for you because i think\nit's best for you\nand this is where a toxic relationship\ncomes from now kid doesn't even want to\ngo to dad's place dad assumes it's\nbecause i don't let him watch tv well\nlike what the hell do you expect him to\ndo all day\nmaybe it's because mom expresses some\ndegree of empathy maybe mom knows what\nit's like to have chronic pain\nmaybe there's a reason why he doesn't\nwant to go to dad's place\nlike\never consider that maybe maybe the\nreason he\ngoes to mom's place and his dad's words\nright he manipulates her she lets\nherself be manipulated maybe she's\nempathic\nmaybe it's not manipulation maybe your\nkid isn't like a sociopath who's like\nclaiming all this stuff\nit's possible he's actually suffering so\nthat's the other thing i want you all to\nthink about\nkid is having headaches\nand dad\ndoesn't believe him you guys get that\nfrom the post dad doesn't believe him\nso how do you think that translates into\ndad's words how do you think that\ntranslates into dad's tone how do you\nthink that translates into\nhow the child feels\nabout their dad\nwhat's the relationship there when you\ngo to you know specialist after\nspecialist and you do everything that a\ngood dad is supposed to do but in your\nheart of hearts you think your kid is\nfaking it\nlike what does that do to the kid\nright whereas mom is like yeah i\nunderstand like i have chronic pain so\nlike i know what it's like to go to\ndoctors\nand get tests after test after test and\nthen tell you nothing is wrong because i\nfeel it it's wrong\nnow i'm not trying to crucify dad here\nbut this is a prime example of what we\nsee\nin our parenting program his parents\ncome in thinking like this\nthe good news is that parents are\nwilling to change and it's just about\ntaking a step back and working with your\nkid\nright it's about sitting down and asking\nyour kid what can i do to help instead\nof fixing it maybe ask them what can i\ndo to help how can i understand what\nyou're going through what's tough about\nyour life\nwhy are you playing the video game\nwhy is it so addictive to you\nand you can even share your concerns\nthis is what we advocate for parents\nwe start by alliance building so you\nhave to learn how to talk to your kid\nand understand what's going on in their\nlife\nbecause you can't conquer video game\naddiction on your own if your kid is\nfighting against you it's never going to\nwork\nright all that's going to happen you may\nsquash the video game addiction and it's\ngonna pop up it's gonna be like a game\nof whack-a-mole where they're gonna have\nother problems\nso we see this where like kids will\nstart doing things like lighting fires\nand they'll like do things like start\nstealing and other kinds of acting out\nbehaviors they'll get into drugs there\nare things like that that happen\nyou know if you just squash the video\ngame without addressing the underlying\ncauses of the video game you're in big\ntrouble because they'll just manifest or\nthey'll manifest in a psychosomatic way\nall of that negative energy will\nmanifest in some other way\nso it starts by understanding your kid\nand like building an alliance with them\nand then by all means set healthy limits\nright so the conversation with your kid\nis hey i understand like you know the\npandemic has been rough for you i\nunderstand that it's hard\ndo you want to go to college like you\nhave to sit down with your kid and ask\nlike do you want to go to college\nokay\nwhat is it like how do you think you're\ndoing the kid is like i'm terrified\nbecause i know i'm not going to get into\ncollege\nand then the right move for dad is like\nyou have to ask the kid okay i would\nlike to help you if you want to go to\ncollege to help you get into college\ndo you want my help\nare you afraid that even with my help\nyou won't be able to make it i can\nunderstand that\nbecause i don't know if you're gonna\nmake it but i'm willing to try if you\nwant my help\nbecause the kid is taking the power you\nguys got that dad is like trying to\nexert power in the relationship and kid\nis stealing it right back\nit sneak like kid is gonna win your kid\nis gonna win\nany conflict between parent and child\nkid is gonna win\nthat's what i've learned having two\ndaughters ages six and four\nright even if the parent wins the parent\nloses\nso you have to support your kid\ncollaborate with your kid build an\nalliance with your kid and then because\nthe thing is like i don't know if you\nguys have had interactions with your\nparents but like you all have goals\nright so why do you come here why do you\ncome to me it's because i support you\nand your goals\ni don't tell you you're dumb for feeling\na certain way or sometimes i do\nright so i call called this one guy a\nreal life smurf like that wasn't the\nnicest thing to say but like you say\nwith compassion you say with the goal of\nhelp and the person's asking for help\nso as a parent you have to like you\nsupport people in what they want to do\nand like this is the cool thing about\nour program is like when parents do this\nit's amazing it's like transformative so\nwe've had like like we had one kid who\nyou know so\nkid had confidence problems so he played\na bunch of video games so we like sat\ndad learned how to talk to his kid\ndad was like hey what do you think about\nlike learning jujitsu kid is like yeah\nthat's dope\nyou know when my when my friends were\nplaying video games i was studying the\nblade right\nand so then then like here's a pro level\nquestion if you guys want pro level\nquestion that you that i t we teach our\nparents to ask\nso you say you want to learn jiu jitsu\nso next week when we sign you off for\njujitsu class and it's time to go\nand you tell me that you don't want to\ngo and you change your mind do you want\nme to listen to you\nso when you tell me you don't want to go\nnext week because i have a feeling that\ncould happen i just want to know what do\nyou want me to do do you want me to hold\nyou accountable to what you want now and\ndo you want me to try to force you to go\nor do you want me to just let it slide\nif you change your mind\nyou ask that question one week ahead of\ntime\nthat question is awesome it's like\nthe most op question\nbecause you're asking the child\ndo i get to control you next week or not\nand the child is like yeah i want you i\nwant you to force me to go\nright and then like when when it comes\nlike then the parent has it and he's\nlike look i wouldn't normally force you\nbut you asked me to do this so like\ni'm choosing to listen to you from a\nweek ago as opposed to like the you from\nnow\nand i'm gonna force you to go\nas best as i can i'm gonna force you i\ncan't really like i'm not gonna like\npick you up and manhandle you and stick\nyou in the car but i'm gonna force you\nto go and then tomorrow morning i'm\ngoing to ask you whether this was the\nright move or not\nso i'm going to ask you tomorrow morning\nwhen next week rolls around do you want\nme to force you or do you not want me to\nforce you\nand then the kid is like okay fine and\nthe next morning rolls around\nand then parent asks the kid hey\ndid i do the right thing enforcing you\nor do you want me to like not do that\nanymore and then kid is like i'd say\nhonestly like 90 of the time they're\nlike force me you did the right thing\nthank you\nthank you for making me go to jiu jitsu\nand then parent and child high five\nthey're on the same team they they did\nit\nparent is like awesome\nright let's celebrate and then suddenly\nthis antagonistic interaction becomes\nlike a celebration\nand then like this is happening in all\nof their dimensions for a lot of the\nkids half the kids anyway right like i'm\ntelling you guys this is not fictional\nthis actually happens this is what we\ntry to do\nright it's about understanding your kid\nand supporting your kid your kid doesn't\nneed you to fix their problems for them\nthat's not raising an adult it's\ninfantilizing a teenager\nthey don't need you to control them they\nneed you to support them\nbecause video game addiction so people\nwill ask me so like i'm an expert\nwhatever the hell that means in video\ngame addiction so parents will ask me\nwhat do you do with your kids\ndo you let them play video games and i\nsay yes\ni do\ndo you let them watch tv yes i do\nthey're like what\nthen i say it's my philosophy that it's\nbetter to teach a child restraint rather\nthan restriction\nso i've seen this a lot like in the\nindian community where like parents will\nbe super strict\nno boyfriends no girlfriends no drinking\nno smoking no video games it's math club\nmathletes\nyou know math competition those are all\nthree separate things i'm not talking\nabout one thing they enroll their kid in\nall three\npiano or violin\neither acceptable\nno drama no theater\nnone of that stuff\nyou can do space camp space camp is\nacceptable\nand no parties\nno short no no dresses above the knee no\ntattoos no coloring of the hair\nyou're gonna be a good you're gonna be a\ngood indian kid you know and then they\ngo to college\n30 percent of them maybe 50 of them wind\nup great they're like totally fine with\nthat they get 4.00 they do fantastic the\nother 50\nfall apart\ndrinking drugs tattoos\nrebellion\nrebellion oh my goodness he's been\ncorrupted by american culture\nindia is so much better he's corrupted\nhurry up\ncorrupted it's bad influence he has that\nfriend\nhis friend\nis mexican or a bapre he's hanging out\nwith these boys\nthat is the problem\nit is not because i taught him let's do\nlittle bit of racism too because we are\nindian it's what we do\nit is not my fault\nthis this boy is\nhe's hanging out with the wrong crowd\nhe's doing the drinking and the drugs\nharebapre\ni do not understand why he's not going\nto the math clubs\nit's\ncorrupted hario\nwhat are we going to do\nthis should not happen it is problem\nwith american values\namerican culture is bad\nnow even my younger son i'm not going to\neven let him leave the house he's going\nto do homeschool\nand no friends that are not indian\nno mexicans no even americans\nchinese is okay\nthat's okay\nit's okay\nbecause they must do studies\nright\nthat's the attitude\nso teach restraint over restriction\nteach your kids how to regulate\nthemselves\nright give them the option and teach\nthem how to like restrain themselves\nyes\nproblem\nso anyway going back to this case\nso i think this is a case that we see\ntime and time and time again\nand what i think it comes down to is\nlike parent is trying to control child\nand child is gonna win they're gonna\nmanifest things to get out of school\nuntil they've succeeded and i don't know\nif you guys remember like this is the\npeople in our community are this way too\ny'all have been the kid\nright\nwho is like\nwho has done the physical illness stuff\nwe see posts about that too where people\nlike manifest weird like illnesses\nand it's all psychosomatic because the\nmind and the body are connected\nand we know this\nwe know that for example like stress\nworsens heart disease right if you guys\nwant to hear about that we can talk\nabout that in a second\nso overall when it comes to like\ninteracting with your parents and if\nyou're a parent who's watching this it's\nit's all about understanding your kid\nit's not you i get that you love your\nkid but it's just like your kid isn't 14\nthey're not 12. they're 16. they have\nthoughts they have feelings i don't know\nwhat's going on with my kids so then ask\ninstead of assuming oh the problem is\nthat they're like sleeping too late well\nlike maybe the reason they're sleeping\ntoo late is something else\nright things are not so simple\nfixing their sleep schedule is going to\nbe a major part of it i don't doubt that\nlike sleep schedule is huge\nbut it's not going to like fix all the\npsychological problems that cause them\nto like go into gaming it's just not\ngoing to be sufficient there's a lot\nmore that needs to happen to it so our\napproach at least working with parents\nis to start by building an alliance and\nthen helping them set healthy boundaries\nand sort of the way that i explained he\nall would like the jiu jitsu example\nright it's about letting the kid know\nand there's another thing that we try to\nteach that oh this is tough another\nthing that we try to teach parents is to\nlet their kids fail\nright so i don't know i'll give you guys\nthis it's very important for parents to\nlearn you got to learn how to teacher\nyou have to learn how to let your child\nfail so i'll give you guys an example so\nsometimes with parents who try to set\nlimits around video games okay so here's\none of my favorite ones so it's like\nif you i we're going to do accent again\nokay so if you are going to want to play\nthe video game you must get\n3.5 gpa\nyou have to study every day and if you\ndon't get 3.5 gpa i'm going to take the\ngame away and the kids like okay dad\ncool whatever\nand so then what happens like what\nhappens the next day right so let's say\nyou have this conversation on sunday\nmonday kid comes home doesn't study\nwhat does the parent do are you studying\nwhy aren't you studying\nyou should study if you don't get 3.5\ni'm taking the game away i told you\ni've told you before\nyou should study\nand then the kid's like yeah dad i'll do\nit i'll do it whatever i was like\nand then like two hours go by dad's back\nwhat are you doing you're still not\nstudying i've told you 3.5 i've told you\nbefore\nso parents start nagging right so like\nsuddenly you set this limit on the child\nwhere they're responsible for getting a\n3.5 gpa\nbut who's actually taking the\nresponsibility\nyou're laying the theoretical\nresponsibility on the kid\nbut\nyou are taking the responsibility as a\nparent you're nagging them hey i want\nyou to succeed i want don't don't fail\ndon't fail don't fail i can't let you\nfail like even though i said that you\ncan handle it and you said you can\nhandle it now i'm not gonna let you\nhandle it i'm gonna intercede on your\nbehalf and i've heard this from kids\nwhere like you know parents will set\nlimits and like the parent will be like\ndid you want me do you want me to remind\nyou to do your homework and the kids\nlike no i can handle my homework myself\ni don't need you to stop nagging me mom\nstop nagging me it's like stop doing it\ni can i'm i'm i'm 16 years old i'm\nbasically an adult i can take care of\nmyself\nand then the parent takes a step back\nand then kid\ngets a d\nwhat does kid do get pissed at the\nparent\nwhy didn't you remind me mom\noh my god i forgot it's your fault that\ni forgot it's your fault you didn't\nremind me you were supposed to remind me\nno i wasn't\nright so this is the problem if you're\ngoing to give your kids the\nresponsibility give them the\nresponsibility you got to let them fail\nor don't give them the responsibility\nyou can't have it halfway\nso letting the parents\nlet their kids fail teaching the parents\nhow to let their kids fail is one of the\nmost important things that we offer\nand it's hard believe me it's hard\nbecause if he does gets to see\noh my goodness he's not going to get to\nharvard or yale\noh my goodness his future is destroyed\nwe will not be able to find a good girl\ni want to have ivy league\ndaughter-in-law\neducated but not too educated\nson must be more educated right\nright so you can't let your kid fail\nbecause then that has consequences\nso then you protect your kid from the\nconsequences you don't let them you\ndon't let them damage their own life and\nin doing so you infantilize them\nand then you accept responsibility for\ntheir situation even though you don't\nhave the power to control their\nsituation suddenly their grades are your\nfault\nbut you can't do the studying\nboy i have no doubt in my mind that\nthere's a handful of indian parents out\nthere that would take the test for their\nkids if they could\nright\nand then you have a man-child\nwhich is what a lot of indian men grow\nup to be because their parents will\ninfantilize them\nno no beta you don't need to learn how\nto wipe your own ass let mommy do it for\nyou\nyes\nmommy needs to get it properly so you\ndon't have dingleberry\nalright papre my boy\nhi papra\nright\nall right\nso if if parents are watching that\nthey can google what anyway\nlet mommy do it for you\nall right\nall right\nso you got to let your you got to let\nyour kids fail right so like in doing\ngetting to that process and this is the\ncool thing is you don't oftentimes once\nthey know that you're not there\nor what's going to happen is they'll ask\nyou for their help and that's it's just\nlike what i was saying earlier about\nlike\nlet them ask you for your help so it's\nlike the jiu jitsu thing where you ask\nthem hey do you want me to do this for\nyou you have to have them ask you for it\nright they have to understand you can't\nforce your help on them because they're\ngonna reject it anyway like the dad is\ndoing everything right in a sense right\nhe's like trying to get his kid into\ntherapy he's like taking away the game\nhe's like sort of setting a regular\nsleep schedule\nhe's doing everything right but the kid\nis fighting him every sense\nevery step of the way so this is what\nwe've learned at hg is like if your kid\nis fighting you every step of the way\nit's not gonna work\nit just doesn't work and the first step\nis that you and your kid like i don't\nknow if you guys get this but if someone\nin your life has an addiction\nthey have to be trying to kick it in\norder to kick it\nyou guys get that like you can't make an\nalcoholic sober from the outside like\nthey have to want to be sober\nand even then it's an uphill battle with\nall of the support and all of the\nresources because you're dealing with an\naddiction\nand parents are out there trying to fix\nthese problems for their kids instead of\nworking with their kids because it's\njust not going to work\nright\nand so we try to do this kind of stuff i\ndon't know if this stuff was relatable\nto y'all or not\nbut i mean this is the big thing and\nspeaking of which\nyou know we're talking about evolution\nearlier i think parents have a higher\nuh how can i say this our society has\nevolved where old styles of parenting\nare insufficient so my parents never\ntalk to me like the way that we teach\nyou know\nkids the way that we teach parents to\ntalk to kids this level of communication\nhas not been necessary in the past for\nwhatever reason i'm not quite sure maybe\nit was i don't know\nbut it's been my experience that the\nchallenges that kids face now like for\nexample the pandemic with depression\ngetting worse you know suicide remaining\nbasically stable anxiety getting worse\nvideo game addiction rates are climbing\nthrough the roof i think they're close\nto like 11 percent of the population now\nwhich is no sorry not 11 percent of the\npopulation 11 of people under the age of\n18.\nso that's twice as bad as alcoholism\nit's like staggering so stuff is getting\nworse and i think parents unfortunately\nlike just being a good parent is no\nlonger sufficient the world that kids\nare growing up in case in point with our\ncase with the person who doesn't know\nhow to go outside\nthere are so many basic things about the\nworld that has changed and we have to\nchange with it parents have to change\nwith it we as kids have to change with\nit\nright\nand so it's challenging i don't blame\nthem that's what we try to help them\nbecause it's like it's not their fault\nlike parenting maybe used to be easier i\ndon't even know if it's fair to say that\nbut the problems that parents used to\nface were different now it's like you\nknow you gotta\nit is i do think things are more\nchallenging because back in my day video\ngames were not designed by like\npsychologists and behavioral economists\nright they were designed by like\ni guess people in japan who thought that\nplumber italian plumbers make good\nheroes and then instead of like dragons\nas enemies we're gonna have a turtle\nand\nand that's what that's who used to\ndesign games and now we have these like\nbillion-dollar corporations\nthat are like you know hiring\npsychologists and behavioral economists\nand things like that\nthat are like\ndesigning games so that you're okay like\nif you look at these ipad things right\nlike kids used to spend like hundreds of\ndollars on the ipad without their\nparents even knowing that's that's how\nthings are designed\nso i do think it's an uphill battle and\ni don't blame parents like i mean i i\nwas kind of harsh on this dad which is a\nlittle bit unfair it's sort of not the\ndude's fault but i think he's kind of\nscrewing up you know so\nhave some compassion but also hold\npeople accountable\nyou"
