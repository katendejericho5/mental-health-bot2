    "transcript": "how do i stay motivated for a new job\nafter years of failure and not caring\nit feels like my floundering in\ndesperation has led me to a point where\ni cannot afford to fail again i'm dirt\npoor i have some addictions i should\nkick and my loved ones worry about me\nthe last three years of my life has\nincluded\nrepeated collegiate flunkage various\nfirings from crappy jobs and a whole\nplethora of bullshittery on my end\nmonths of unemployment forced me to\nbegrudgingly apply myself i scored a job\nwith a company that will pay me more\nthan i've ever made in the past with an\nopportunity for promotion and epic cash\nflow\na part of me is excited and relieved for\nthis new opportunity opportunity however\nanother side of me is saying oh crap oh\ngod what if i screw up again\nit feels like this job is a precious\nbaby otter and i'm just a goblin with a\nwith credit card debt but my biggest\nfear is that my inner goblin will decide\nto stop caring about this otter and i\nwill once again exterminate my chance\nfor success\nso my question today is how do i channel\nexcitement for potential success into a\nlong-term hard-working attitude\ni know that this problem\ni have won't be cured by an easy\nsolution but honestly just writing it\nout feels good\nhas anyone out there experienced this\nfeeling if so what did you do about it\nany\nand all advice and comments would be\ngreatly appreciated i know someone's\nsaying what colorful prose my thoughts\nexactly\nsomeone's a a gifted author okay\nso this is a job post about someone who\nyou know has\nnot been doing great in life\nflunked out of college maybe got\naddicted people are worried about them\num you know\nnot doing great and then sort of applied\nthemselves and ended up getting a job\nwith the option of epic cash flow\nright so now they're excited and they're\nafraid that they're going to screw it up\nand their question is how do i keep how\ndo i channel my excitement into like\nlong-term motivation and drive\nand the short answer is you don't\nso long-term motivation and drive does\nnot come from excitement so this is\nsomething that's very important to\nunderstand\nlong-term motivation and drive doesn't\ncome from excitement it comes from doing\naway with all of the negative stuff\nso i want you guys to think about it\nthis way so imagine that you're starting\na fire and so you have some lighter\nfluid on there right which is like the\nyou know that's the excitement so\nexcitement is by definition gonna wane\nover time because it's emotions we can't\nstay perpetually excited this is the\nmajor trap that a lot of people fall\ninto is when they get a spark of\nexcitement they work really hard they\nfeel excited and then like something\nhappens and their old patterns set in\nand then their excitement wanes over\ntime and then they end up things end up\nfalling apart right so we see the cycle\nover and over again a burst of\nmotivation and excitement followed by\nsome progress followed by back to square\none\nso how does that happen people think\nthat what i need to do is continue the\nexcitement and it sort of makes sense\nbecause excitement is what got you out\nof the rut so you think okay like how do\ni increase my excitement how do i\nmaintain it how do i advance\nwhereas what i'd say is that you know\nexcitement is like lighter fluid so\nimagine you're starting you know you're\ntrying to start a fire and you place\nsome logs or you put some lighter fluid\nand you kind of light it\nbut then the issues what the reason that\nyour fire goes out is not because of an\nabsence of lighter fluid it's because\nthere's like rain and there's like wind\nand then you've got this tiny little\nfire and you don't know how to keep it\ngoing or you can keep it going for a few\nseconds or a few minutes\nbut it's really the negative aspects of\nyour life weighing down on you that\nultimately destroy your long-term\nmotivation so if we look at this\nperson's post we can even see it in\ntheir language right\nso let's just kind of take a look\nit feels like my floundering in\ndesperation i cannot afford to fail dirt\npoor some addictions\nvarious firings\nplethora of bullshittery\nbegrudgingly apply myself yuck\nright\nand\ni feel like i'm just gonna screw it up\nagain like failure is inevitable i'm\nafraid i'm afraid i'm gonna screw it up\nbecause i've screwed it up so many times\nin the past\nso if you want real motivation\nwhat you really have to do is nurture\nthat that fire right like you have to\nprotect it from the negative stuff\nso motivation each and every human being\nis actually naturally motivated\nif you look at it like you know i know\nit sounds kind of weird but\nit's not that we have to find motivation\nit's that like what's learned is\nactually a lack of motivation being\nunmotivated is the modification the\ndefault is actually to be motivated and\nif you don't believe that all you have\nto do is look at a child\nevery child is motivated to walk every\nchild is motivated to learn how to pick\nup a ball every child is motivated to\nlike interact with other children\nright as children we see the most\nnatural state of the human which is to\nlike strive to like grow and learn and\ndo things like you can't get kids to sit\nstill they get bored easily they want\nexcitement they want to explore they\nwant to go do things so the most natural\nelement of a human being is actually to\nbe motivated towards something so what\ngets in the way it's all the negative\ncrap that kills the motivation\nso long-term sustained motivation does\nnot come from increasing your excitement\nbecause excitement can absolutely get us\nout of the rut\nlong-term motivation actually comes with\nprocessing the negative things that hold\nus back\nbecause what this person needs is not\nfuel for the fire what they need is\nfreedom from like the negative emotions\nthey need freedom from the doubt and\nfreedom from the fear and freedom from\nthe idea that inevitably i will screw\nthis up as i have before because what's\ngonna happen in this person's mind is\nvery similar to our last case which is\nwhen some natural thing happens that\ncauses a negative impact in their\nperformance all of these negative\nthoughts will be like oh see you're\nscrewing it up again you're screwing it\nup again you're screwing it up again\nthere it goes you knew you couldn't do\nit you got uppity and you tried and see\nwhat happened you're doomed to failure\nwhen the truth is that you know there's\ngoing to be fluctuations in your job no\nmatter what so let's say they've got an\nopportunity for promotion and someone\nthere happens to be like better at the\njob than they are\nand then that person gets promoted and\nso like even though next round that this\nperson you may still get promoted like\nyou just lost this one you can apply\nnext year or next six months or whatever\nyou'll get it promoted that time\nbut in those natural fluctuations\nas your negative emotions start to\nleverage themselves in that's in that\nspace\nthen your motivation is going to become\nyou know go to crap\nso the truth is that if people are\nasking you know how do i maintain my\nexcitement for the sake of like\nlong-term motivation\nlong-term motivation does not come from\nmaintaining excitement\nexcitement can help you out of the rut\nbut what you really need to work on is\nwhy do you assume that the default\nposition is going to be failure\nright and there's good reasons to assume\nand i'm not saying you shouldn't assume\nthat that's the case because you know\nyou're a smart person and you've learned\nthat i tend to screw things up\nbut by taking that that possibility\nseriously by looking at it seriously by\nunderstanding hey like i've screwed\nthings up in the past\nand these are my vulnerabilities by\nrespecting those vulnerabilities by\ntaking them seriously by taking the fact\nthat you do screw things up pretty\nseriously and working on it very\nauthentically you can actually overcome\nthem\nbecause even though you have screwed\nthings up does not mean that you will\ncontinue to screw things up\nperformance is not\na guarantor of future gains right this\nis a very important thing from like\npeople who trade stocks just because the\nstock has done well for the last 100\ndays doesn't mean it will continue to do\nwell for the future 100 days\njust because your life has led to\ncertain conclusions which may be fair\ndoes not mean that those conclusions\nneed to form your destiny\nso the destiny is still in your hands\nyou need to just take your problems very\nseriously you need to recognize that you\nhave an awesome opportunity for epic\ncash flow\nis there a likelihood that you'll screw\nit up absolutely\nand it's by respecting the possibility\nthat you will screw it up\nthat you actually give yourself the best\nchance of success\nso i'm going to share with you guys a\nquick learning from ti\nso i've worked with several esports\nteams\nand there are some teams that\nyou know if you really want the best\nchance to win a game you have to the\nbest way to best chance to win a game is\nto accurately assess what your chances\nof winning the game are\nso there are some teams that will be\nbetter than their opponents and they'll\nthink things like oh these people are\ncrap\nwe got that we got this right these\npeople are trash they play trash dota\nand we're gonna we're gonna stomp them\nand when you enter the game with that\nattitude there's a decent chance you\nhave a greater chance of losing the\nright attitude to have is that hey we\nare better than these people but this is\nthe international and like you know\nanyone they're gonna be playing their\nbest and they're going to try to take\ngames off of us\nright any even though if you're favored\nin a match you still have to respect\nyour opponent don't over respect them\nbut respect them enough\ni've seen the flip side of this too\nwhere sometimes teams are intimidated by\ntheir opponent\nand like they're not favored right so\nlet's say you've got a 20 chance of\nwinning this game and so what these\nteams will do is we'll psych themselves\nup they'll be like oh these guys aren't\nthat great like even the back of your\nmind you know that they're probably\nbetter than you are\nbut people don't want to they don't want\nto say that right because they're afraid\ni don't know what's going on with this\ncolor by the way\nbut they don't want to say that's what\nthey do is they psych themselves up and\nthey're like oh these people aren't that\ngood like we're better than they are\nlike you know we can beat these noobs\nlike they're not that great they're like\nnot that great oh we can do this\nand then what happens is when you enter\nthe game and like you have an 80 chance\nof losing like you start to lose and\nthen that false confidence comes\ncrumbling down\nso one of the key things i learned from\nti is having authentic doubt is better\nthan having false confidence\nso if you really want to win that game\nagainst an opponent who's better than\nyou are you have to go in understanding\nthat you're not favored to win\nthe attitude that you want is that you\nknow i may not win but i have a chance\nso like even though i'm not favored like\nthere is a way that i can win this game\nand i just need to look for it these\npeople are not perfect are they better\nthan i am sure\nbut they're not going to their chances\nof winning are not 100 i can win this\ngame\neven if they're better than than i am i\njust need to look for them to screw up\nthey're going to be playing with\noverconfidence and i'm going to punish\nthem for it\nso to be very authentic about your\nsituation have you failed in the past\nyes should you be careful about failing\nin the future absolutely respect your\nopponent take it seriously and by doing\nso you'll actually have the best chance\nof doing really well and actually coming\nout on top so if you want to hit that\nepic cash flow you can't underestimate\nyour chances and you can't overestimate\nyour chances\ntake your problems seriously respect\nthem and understand that if you respect\nyour problems they can actually be\nworked on and they're not invincible\nyou can overcome the things that have\nheld you back\nright your past does not dictate your\nfuture you are in control of this you\njust need to take it seriously"
