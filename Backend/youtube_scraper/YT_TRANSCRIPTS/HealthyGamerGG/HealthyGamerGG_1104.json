    "transcript": "burnout is caused by workplace stuff so\nit's something it's these symptoms\nthat's or look like depression but have\na fundamental root in workplace related\nthings and like workplace interactions\nso the first thing i want to talk about\ntoday is um we someone cross-posted this\nfrom the anti-work uh\nsubreddit and what they kind of posted\nis this tweet which is a truly dystopian\npart of all of this are the chipper\nemail reminders from schools and\nworkplaces reminding people to tend to\ntheir mental health while doing\nabsolutely nothing to make that possible\nso i think this tweet is actually like\nreally important\nbecause it speaks to a fundamental\nproblem and i think one of the biggest\nscams\nthat's currently being perpetrated\nagainst people\nabout kind of burnout and mental\nwellness\nso what i mean by that is like there's\nsomething going on right now which is\nlike very subtle and is actually like\nsociety-wide oh\nwhich i think is a real problem okay\num\nand the the biggest problem right now\nthat i think is happening with burnout\nis that people are are placing the\nresponsibility of burnout\non the individual so this is something\nthat's like very subtle but like for\nexample the world health organization\nhas uh recently you know they like\ncoined like this kind of diagnosis\nthat's burnout\nso a lot of people are sort of talking\nabout burnout and if you really think\nabout it there's like there's a huge\nproblem because burnout affects the\nindividual\nright so the way that we talk about this\nproblem is very individual oriented so\nwe say that you know all of these like\nissues of workplace mental health like\nthe mental health is like within the\nperson burnout happens to a person\nand so there's a subtle problem that's\ngoing on there's a very subtle scam\ngoing on which is that\nonce you kind of label it as an\nindividual problem you say oh you're\nburnt out like go get a diagnosis from a\npsychiatrist and then you work on it as\na person as an individual\nwhat's happening is there's a very\nsubtle\ndrastic and catastrophic\nshift of responsibility from the\nworkplace\nto the individual and i think this is\nincredibly damaging so this has happened\nbefore\nso if you look at addiction this is\nanother big area where like this kind of\nthing happened\nso 40 years ago if you were addicted to\ncigarettes like what was the solution to\nyou being addicted to cigarettes it was\na personal solution right it was like go\nto a doctor and then like doctors will\nprescribe medications to help you get\noff of cigarettes like stuff like\nchantix and things like that it's like\nhere use this nicorette replacement gum\nlike use this gum like basically the\nproblem of you being addicted to\nsomething is an individual problem we\nalso see this with opiate usage right\nwhere like there's a diagnosis of opiate\nuse disorder so people get addicted to\nopiates and then the burden of fixing\nthat problem falls to the individual\ni think the the big catastrophic mistake\nthat happened in all of these situations\nis that there was a very real\nignorance or avoidance of a systemic\nresponsibility so we now knew know\nthrough like various investigations and\nlike even lawsuits and stuff that like\nthe opioid crisis in the united states\nis is not\nthere because of a failing of like\nmillions of individuals to get off of\nopiates right the opioid crisis in this\ncountry was created by a systemic change\nwhere like doctors were over prescribing\nopiates\nby an industry that was sort of like\nsaying hey this isn't a problem this is\nreally great everyone should use this\nokay\nand so i think that what the same exact\nthing is actually happening with like\nworkplace mental health and burnout\nwhere what's happening is we're saying\nlike oh people are burnt out so like\ncompanies are going to their hr\ndepartments and they're saying like hey\nemployees are worrying about\nburnout like people are really concerned\nabout it like what should we do and then\nthe hr folks like in a sense they don't\nreally know better right\nso they're doing is like okay so like\nlet's give people access to a meditation\napp let's send them\ndaily email reminders to tell them to\ntake care of their mental health\nbut if you look at all of those\nsolutions the burden of responsibility\nis being placed on the individual and\nwhat's kind of interesting is by placing\nthe burden of responsibility on the\nindividual\nthe industry is sort of getting a pass\nand this is a huge problem because the\ntruth of burnout and if you go back to\nthe original like research on burnout\nwas done by someone named mozlok and\nwhat mazlak basically determined so like\nquick history lesson on burnout\nis mozilla said hey there's this thing\ncalled burnout and it like causes people\nto be not empathic it causes people to\nlose motivation it causes people to like\nyou know have difficulty like doing\nthings and so what the psychological and\npsychiatric community said when mozlok\nbasically coined the term burnout and\nsaid hey there's this burnout syndrome\nthey said well how is this different\nfrom depression right because in\npsychiatry what we tend to do when\nsomeone says hey i've discovered a new\nthing what the automatic response is is\nlike\nhow is this thing new like because we\nknow about depression it sounds like\nwhat you're describing is depression and\nwhat mazlak defined burnout as is he\nsaid yeah it's very similar but there's\na key difference\nburnout is caused by workplace stuff so\nit's something it's these symptoms\nthat's or look like depression but have\na fundamental root in workplace related\nthings and like workplace interactions\nso even if you look at the world health\norganization definition of burnout it\nrelates to workplace related stuff\nand this is really really important\nbecause there's a very subtle thing that\nhappens here which is that when we start\ndiagnosing individuals with burnout even\nif it's workplace related stuff we are\nstill shifting the blame and the\nresponsibility of burnout to the\nindividual as opposed to the workplace\nand this is something that like i've\nseen time and time and time again where\nwhen when i deal with burnout i've done\na lot of work on burnout um\nwhat we tend to find is that like\nburnout is not caused generally speaking\nby individual factors it's caused by\nworkplace related factors so i'm going\nto give you guys an example from\nmedicine\nso doctors tend to work really really\nhard right so we tend to work hard we\nlike study hard like we study for you\nknow 60 70 80 hours a week in residency\nwe work 60 70 80 hours a week and and\nthe interesting thing is that most\ndoctors are actually like okay with that\nthey're okay with doing that kind of\nwork\nif you ask doctors why they're burnt out\nit's not actually working a lot it's not\nthe number of hours it's the kind of\nwork that they're forced to do so i'll\ngive you guys just an example this is\nsomething that i find incredibly\nfrustrating so i can work with patients\nfor 60 hours a day but what i absolutely\nhate is arguing with insurance companies\nfor 10 hours a day so this is where like\nif i think my patient needs a particular\nmedication\nwhat i have to do is like i may\nprescribe it but then like the insurance\ncompany says we're sorry we're not going\nto pay for that medication we don't\nthink your patient needs it instead\nwe're going to give them this other\nmedication and this is what we're\nwilling to pay for and so then what i\nhave to do is spend like an hour calling\nthe insurance company and they do this\non purpose by the way they don't make\nthe process of getting expensive\nmedication for their patients easy they\nmake it hard because they understand\nthat for every hour\nthe harder they make it for me to get\nthe medication for my patient the less\nlikely i am to actually like advocate\nfor more expensive medication so they\nplace artificial barriers that are quite\nhigh requiring me to fill out forms\nspend time on the phone talk to someone\nelse and justify my decision\nand keep in mind this is it's not like\ni'm justifying the decision to a medical\ndoctor right it's like someone who's got\nlike a you know a business degree who's\nsaying this is our protocol and this is\nwhat we're going to pay for\nand so that that's the kind of stuff\nthat burns me out so what we understand\nis that like burnout is not caused by an\nindividual problem it's not like the\nperson is lazy or they're you know like\nthey're just not taking care of\nthemselves\nburnout tends to be caused by people who\nwant to do a good job who are placed in\nsituations where doing a good job is\nvery very difficult\nand so what's happening right now is\nwhen people like when workplaces will do\nstuff like okay like hey here's an email\nto kind of take care of yourself here's\na subscription to a meditation app and\nthis is our solution right and so what\nthe the company then does is they like\ncheck the box they're like okay we've\ndone this is our employee wellness\ninitiative and we've checked the box and\nthe cool thing about our employee\nwellness initiative is that we value\nwellness and we care about our employees\nbut don't ask us to actually change\nanything at work because that's\nridiculous like it's silly right\nthe solution to employee wellness is on\non the burden is on the employees like\nwe're going to help you we're going to\nbe such good employers and we're going\nto give you the subscription to this\nmeditation app so that you can meditate\nin your free time and that way you'll be\nless burnt out\ngood job right strong work\nand the thing is like this is the huge\nproblem right because like now what\nwe're having is a society that is\nassuming that wellness is a combination\nof like meditation apps like chia seed\nseed pudding and like\nhome delivery food services that allow\nyou to like cook stuff the burden of\nwellness is being placed on the\nindividual and if in the message that we\nget is it's like the workplace doesn't\nneed to change anything what needs to\nhappen is like you need to eat more chia\nseed pudding you need to like do yoga\nevery day and you need to meditate and\nlike that's the solution like it's your\nfault that you're burnt out because\nyou're not taking care of your mental\nwellness well enough it's not our fault\nit's an industry we're not contributing\nto this it's like if you do these things\nlike this is the solution and this is\nthe biggest scam that's being\nperpetrated against us right is like\nthis idea that like\nburnout which moslak defined as a\nworkplace related thing that the\nsolution is on the side of the\nindividual\nand this sort of makes sense in terms of\nwhat's happening in the world because i\ndon't know if you guys get this but like\nmeditation apps are on the rise chia\nseed pudding is on the rise yoga is on\nthe rise all of these things are far\nmore accessible than they've ever been\nand you would think that if these things\nwere actually effective we would see a\ndecrease in the level of burnout but\nwhat we actually see is the opposite\nthat burnout is getting worse despite\nthe wellness industry booming so like\nwhat's the problem here the problem is\nthat all of the solutions that we have\nto burn out are not actually targeting\nthe root of the problem which is a\nworkplace related thing\nand so like this is where i know it\nsounds crazy but like this is a big part\nof how you successfully deal with\nburnout is you have to target the\nworkplace related stuff\nso a couple years ago i was running this\nprogram called the smart program which\nout of\nso the smart program is the stress\nmanagement and resilience training\nprogram it was it's for physicians and\nit's out of this place called the benson\nhenry institute at harvard medical\nschool so i was running this program for\na couple of years it was created by a\npredecessor of mine who was awesome and\nbrilliant and very forward thinking\nand so what we did is we took 600\ndoctors a year and we put them through\nthis resilience training program\nand here's what we even did it for free\nso here's what we found is that when we\nwent to a hospital and we're like hey we\nhave this program for you that will like\nhelp your you know your staff your\ndoctors be like less burnt out and the\nthe people would be like oh that's great\nlike can you do the program we're like\nyeah we'll do the program and then\nthey're like okay what does it cost and\nwe're like it doesn't cost anything well\nwe're happy to do it because we're just\nhere to try to support like you know\nresident physicians\nand so they were all for it and when did\nwe get pushback\nwe got pushback when we said hey if you\nguys want to do this program you have to\nmake it a part of your your your\nresident physician's regular workday so\nwe're happy to do the program but for\ntwo hours once a week\nthe people in the program need to be\nexcused from work because what everyone\nwhat everyone wanted to do is like tack\nit on to the end right they're like okay\nwe're gonna you're gonna work from 7 a.m\nto 7 p.m because those are your regular\nwork hours and then we've got this\ntwo-hour awesome wellness course at the\nend of the day\nthat you guys can do it's free it's\ngoing to be from 7 p.m to 9 p.m where\nyou can learn how to take better care of\nyour mental health isn't that fantastic\nlook at how much we're supporting\nresident wellness\nand so we said that here's what we found\nthe core finding from the program is you\nhave to make it a part of their job you\ncan't add it on it can't be optional it\nhas to be replacing\nactual work\nand so i this was something that we got\na lot of pushback on but what we\nultimately found is that like it's kind\nof bizarre but like when people replaced\nactual patient care or other kinds of\ndocumentation or things like that with\nthis wellness program it actually\nsucceeded quite a bit and i know it\nsounds kind of weird but the basic thing\nthat we discovered is that wellness is\nnot something that\nhas to be done by an employee outside of\nwork hours in order for like employee\nwellness to actually be effective it's\nsomething that must be taken care of as\npart of their job it's not something\nextra it's not something additional it's\nsomething that has to be systemically\nimplemented into the job\nand the smart program isn't the only\nexample of this so like the bizarre\nthing is i've done this work with a lot\nof different companies now so i've done\nit like in investment banks private\nequity firms tech companies you know we\ndo this kind of work with streamers and\nstuff like that and what we've\nessentially discovered is that\nthe industry accepting responsibility\nfor improving the employee work\nconditions is the best solution to\nburnout and a lot of people in the\nindustry are very concerned about this\nright because they're like oh like if my\ndoctors are not seeing people for two\nhours a day that means that we're gonna\nlet make less money and so like\nindustries tend to be very resistant to\nit and the thing is they're dumb because\nthe truth is that when you implement\nlike wellness initiatives which may not\nlook like meditation by the way i'll\ngive you guys a great example of this it\nactually like tends to improve like\nemployee happiness and it actually makes\nyou money so i'm gonna give you guys a\ngreat example of this\nonce again from medicine okay\nso\none of the things that's the most\nannoying about being a doctor is that\nyou have to write notes and so like\nwriting notes used to be good like it\nused to be like a useful thing that as a\ndoctor i want to remember things for\nmyself or i have colleagues who are\ngoing to like you know be looking at my\nnotes because they're taking care of a\npatient overnight so the purpose of a\nnote used to be to like transmit useful\ninformation from like one person to\nanother person or even from one like to\nwrite it down so you can remind yourself\nthe next day okay so this person had a\nfever this day i gave him this\nmedication it seemed to get better okay\ngood to know\nso over time though what's happened is\nnotes have become like a tool for\nbilling so now like we all get oriented\nor we go through these seminars where\nthere's like some hospital administrator\nthat says if you add these six sentences\nto your note we can bill at a higher\nlevel and the hospital will make more\nmoney\nso now notes are becoming like a useless\npile of garbage that's used for the sake\nof like billing insurance and this is\nalso it's mind-numbingly boring as a\nphysician because i have to write all\nthis useless crap that has nothing to do\nwith patient care so that i can bill at\na higher rate and i can get bonus and\nthe hospital can make more money\nso when you talk to doctors about you\nknow what do they dislike about their\njob what what burns them out and they'll\nsay things like it's like insurance and\nlike note writing\nso then some hospitals were actually\nreally forward thinking and they're like\nyou know what we're gonna do we're gonna\nhire a scribe so they actually asked the\ndoctors they said like what would be\nuseful for you and like the doctors are\nlike it would be great if i didn't have\nto write notes so instead of what the\nhospital actually did is that like like\nsome hospitals have done this and now\nit's becoming more commonplace they\nactually hire a separate person who\naccompanies the doctor and they have\nlike a laptop they have like a little\nlaptop that they carry around they carry\na stool like some of them will literally\ncarry a stool so the doctor walks in and\nthen there's like the patient saying\nyour doctor sits there there's some\nrando there with a laptop and a stool\nthey unfold their stool they sit down\nand they start typing as the doctor is\ntalking\nand what people have discovered is that\nlike having this scribe which may cost\n20 bucks an hour it's a whole different\nperson that you have to hire and train\nand stuff like that so there's an\nupfront cost it actually works wonders\nbecause what happens is that the doctor\ndoesn't have to spend time writing notes\nanymore right so now this this like you\nhave this peon who's like doing all the\nthis like crappy note writing that\nallows you to bill at a higher rate you\npay 20 bucks an hour more and the cool\nwild thing is that not only is the\ndoctor happier because they don't have\nto spend as much time writing stupid\ncrap they also can see more patients so\nwhat you're actually allowing a doctor\nto do is operate at what's called the\ntop of their license which is like\ninstead of seeing 10 patients and\nwriting notes for one hour i can see 11\npatients and write notes for like 10\nminutes and it's actually a win-win like\nall around\nand this is what i've seen time and time\nand time again is that employers and\nindustries that sort of take the burnout\nof their employees seriously and are\nwilling to actually implement systemic\nchange from a workplace environment\nperspective are the ones that actually\nwin which is why it's so like\nbizarre to me that like people are so\nresistant to this that\nit's kind of crazy that like\nin industries right now like success\naround burnout is possible you can\nactually support the health and\nwell-being of your employees in the\nworkplace and like even if it negatively\nimpacts your bottom line like you can\nabsolutely do it and i would bet money\nthat even if you did that even if you're\nseeing like some kind of upfront cost\nover time you'll see like more\nproductivity\nbut it's bizarre to me that is\nessentially what's going on in the world\nright now is that you have like\nindustries and corporations that are\noutsourcing their mental like the mental\nhealth of their employees they're not\nlike taking any responsibility for it\nand they're sort of like going to hr and\nthey're like hey our employees are\ncomplaining about burnout like what\nshould we do\nlike and then the hr person is like the\nhr person can't say like oh we have to\nlike you know let them work from home\nlike there's another good example where\nyou know covet has shown us that work\nfrom home basically works like you don't\nsee a huge negative impact in\nproductivity and people really like it\nand now what's happening is corporations\nare forcing their employees to come back\nin for like corporate culture it's like\nwhat what corporate culture are you\ntrying to reinforce like toxicity and\nlike\nhaving your employees spend two hours in\ntraffic every day because you want them\nto sit in a cubicle and do the same work\nthat they can do from home like are you\ntrying to get 40 hours of labor out of\nsomeone when the truth is that they\ncould do the same job in 30 hours and\nhave 10 hours off and like it won't\naffect your bottom line at all\nit's just stupid\nlike there's just so much idiocy and\nit's it's a whole it's like a systemic\nproblem that people are thinking that\nyou know workplace mental health is on\nthe responsibility of the worker like\nit's dumb\nlike in the original definition of\nburnout like i'm serious if you go and\nyou look at the original definition of\nburnout what separated it from\ndepression is that it's caused from\nfactors related to work\nand if we want to fix this problem it's\nnot like increasing your meditation apps\nand like giving everyone organic produce\nit's actually making changes within the\nworkplace\nand the other mind-numbing thing that\nlike is just crazy is that making\nchanges in the workplace is actually\nlike good for the workplace like it's\ndumb that that like every organization\nthat i've gone to let me think about\nthat\nyeah i think i can say every\norganization every organization that\ni've gone to and we've implemented like\na burnout like mental wellness kind of\nplan that involves like those things\nbeing structured into part of their job\nis like it has been successful\nand generally speaking i've never heard\nfrom a company and we have like good\nrelations with these people right and\nthey usually call us back and want us to\ndo more and things like that we've never\nheard from a company that like hey this\nis actually negatively hurting our\nbottom line and like we don't think that\nthis is a good intervention\nlike i've never heard that before and\nit's all kinds of things from like you\nknow even like there was one hospital i\nwas working at where like we decided\nthat we were gonna like meditate\ntogether every morning during rounds or\nthat the first 10 minutes of the day was\nlike everyone on the unit getting\ntogether with all the patients and\noffering like a group meditation that\npatient and staff can do together and\nthen you start rounds 10 minutes late\nbut the good news is that since\neveryone's like on the same like\nwavelength and everyone's kind of like\ncalmed down and like chilled out like\neven the patients are chill like the the\nthe staff is chill like rounds moves\nfaster it's not like this two and a half\nhour slog where everyone's like more\nefficient because they all meditated at\nthe beginning of rounds it's crazy\nso you know i i know that like there's a\nlot of stuff like the anti-work\nsubreddit is growing really rapidly and\nlike i can see why because\nthe simple truth of the matter is that\nthere's a gigantic scam that's being\nperpetrated\nright now\nand there are all kinds of people that\nare part of it including like the\nmedical industry because what we've\nmanaged to do is define burnout is an\nindividual problem\npeople will say i am burnt out what\nshould i do about it and the truth is\nthat there are some things that you can\ndo more recent research like for example\nover the last decade research shows that\nburnout's actually 50 50 that half of it\nseems to be workplace related stuff and\nthe other half is like maybe not\nworkplace related stuff so you know\nresearch is still evolving\nbut at the end of the day i think like\nthe biggest issue is that we're\noutsourcing we're placing the\nresponsibility of burnout on the\nindividual as opposed to the company\ntaking some degree of responsibility and\nas long as this is going on we can have\nas many meditation apps as you want we\ncan discover other kinds of superfoods\nand super grains and super probiotic\nkimchi related sodas and whatever like\nyou can have as much health food related\nstuff as you want to but at the end of\nthe day until employers start accepting\nresponsibility that there may be part of\nthe reason that my employees are burnt\nout has something to do with the way\nthat their job is structured\nthis problem is going to continue to get\nworse\nand like the employers are going to be\nthe ones that suffer too because like\nthe other stupid thing is that it's it's\nreally like a win-win situation it's\njust like having happier\nuh employees means like more productive\nemployees and more productive employees\nmeans that it's like good for for\norganizations\nso like for those of you all that are in\nsituations where you know your your\nworkplace isn't ideal like my\ncondolences and be really really careful\nabout you know drawing the line between\nwhat you can do and what you're\nresponsible for and honestly like what\nneeds to change at your job\nand because like the truth is the truth\nof the matter is that like you know you\nthere's no amount of like personal stuff\nthat you can do\nto\nreally fix\na bad work situation\nquestions\nyeah so people are saying like some\npeople gotta go right like just quit and\ni think that's what we're seeing like so\nin the united states there's all this\ntalk of a labor shortage there isn't a\nlabor shortage\nthere's like\nthere's like a wage shortage right\nthere's like a there's an abundant over\nabundance of crappy jobs that people are\nno longer willing to put up with\nand so like this is not it's not a\nproblem of labor it's not like they're\nlike i mean i'm sure that some of it is\nlabor related like people you know a lot\nof people died from covid a lot of\npeople have like you know medical\ncomplications from kobe and stuff like\nthat but at the end of the day like it's\nnot a labor shortage it's just like\npeople are not willing once you figured\nout like okay i can stay at home and\nmake 1200 bucks or i can work in a super\ntoxic environment and make 1600 bucks\nlike i'm just gonna pass on the toxic\nenvironment because the extra 400 the\nopportunity cost of that is like not\nworth it\nright it's like this stupid stuff that\npeople have at work like yeah we're not\ngoing to give you a chair because we\ndon't want to make you lazy and we don't\nwant other people to feel like you're\nlazy like what is that even based on\nis there any research that shows that if\nsomeone if you provide an employee a\nchair that people purchase less stuff\nlike where is the stuff coming from\nthere's so many ideas in like corporate\nindustry that are not based in science\nat all like it's just\nyou"
