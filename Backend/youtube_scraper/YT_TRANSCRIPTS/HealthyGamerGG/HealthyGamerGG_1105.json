    "transcript": "only fans has created a situation where\nthere's essentially like it's not just a\npassive consumer anymore right you're\nactually like forming some kind of\nrelationship with the content creator\nso\ni'm addicted to finn dom and only fans\ni'm a 27 year old virgin male i've been\naddicted to porn since i was 13. i just\nrecently found out about nofap a few\nweeks ago and have been trying to turn\nmy life around but i'd say four months\nago one of the girls i subscribed to on\nonly fans said i should try findom to\nsee if i liked it\nand long story short i somehow got\naddicted to find dom and i can't stop\ni've probably wasted over 3 500 on finn\ndom and only fans since then\ni sometimes feel like i can't get out of\nthis addiction because it's so easy for\nme to get triggered and lose control\ni'm not sure if many of you are familiar\nwith findon but it's basically\nhumiliating men for money\ni'm not sure how i got into it the few\ngirls i have interacted with in the past\nover text and in real life of laughed\nand made fun of me because i'm short and\nstill a virgin\ni've had a bad experience with women all\nmy in my life and sometimes i feel like\nno woman would ever want me\ni'm thinking these reasons could be the\nroot of this addiction what do you all\nthink i know this might sound weird but\ni really wanted i just wanted to inform\npeople to do not try finn dom it's way\nworse than just porn addiction and it's\ndepressing\ni really need someone to encourage me to\nabstain from this\nand i'd appreciate it if someone could\nokay\nso the first thing is that this is a\npost from the nofap subreddit which i\nthink can be a good subreddit for people\nto kind of get support so we also want\nto you know it's not from our subreddit\nbut there are a couple of things i i\nreally like this post because i think it\nhighlights a couple of really important\nissues that we're facing right now\nso the first is that pornography is\nevolving\ni know it's kind of scary but like\nso what used to be simple pornography is\nnow evolving to\ntake advantage of so many other\npsychological vulnerabilities and like\nneuroscientific niches\nso we had pornography back in the day\nright and we know that there's like\ndifferent kinds of pornography that\npeople would get into\nbut what we started to create now in\nsort of the realm of pornography are\nsome of these other like\nevolutions and the reason that these\nthings are evolving is because it's\nalmost like a darwinian\nsituation where someone kind of comes up\nwith a particular idea and then like the\nmarket basically determines selects for\nthe things that are the most successful\nand why are these different things\nsuccessful it's because they're taking\nadvantage of certain psychological needs\nthat people have\nso one example of this is only fan so\nwhy is like only fans so incredibly\nsuccessful\ni think a big part of it is is simply\nthat if you thought about pornography\nall you could be in pornography was a\npassive participant you could be a\nconsumer right like you couldn't\nactually participate you could just\nconsume the pornography so you can watch\nit but there's no interaction there's no\nkind of relationship that develops or if\na relationship does develop it's wholly\nwithin your head\nand along comes only fans which takes\npornography and then adds an element of\na real relationship to it right it adds\nan element of like parasocial\nrelationships so now it's not just\nlike a random person that is like you\nknow triggering some kind of like\nneuroscientific response to like erotic\npictures\nnow it's like i can interact with this\nperson and even in this person's case\nthe person on only fans is making\nrecommendations to me so i'm able to\nform a relationship so when you take all\nof the things that are addictive and\nreinforcing about pornography and what i\nmean by that is just like visual imagery\nand sounds of like you know sexual\nthings which activate our brain and like\nrelease dopamine and all that good stuff\nallow us to do things like uh you know\ncalm down our amygdala and and numb out\nour negative emotions and like internal\npain so that like old school porn could\ndo all that\nnow when you have only fans you have the\ncapacity to form some kind of real\nrelationship with this person you can\ninteract with them they'll respond to\nyou you can request things sure there's\na price tag for all that stuff but it's\nonly fans has created a situation where\nthere's essentially like it's not just a\npassive consumer anymore right you're\nactually like forming some kind of\nrelationship with the content creator we\nsee that parasocial relationship on\ntwitch as well right so like this is the\nway that the internet is is evolving\nwhere people are starting to form\nrelationships with people online\nnow do i think that that's wholesale and\nnegative thing not really because i do\nthink that like like this is a good\nexample of we can use this tool at least\nin my opinion you're welcome to disagree\nfor good or for evil the fact that you\ncan connect to other streamers like so i\nstill remember you know a lot of people\nwhen we do interviews or when people\nwatch streamers they'll connect with the\nstreamer in some way even be inspired by\nthe streamer in some way um you know\ninteract with the streamer in some way\nand sometimes that can actually lead to\nlike positive impacts right so what one\nthing that i really appreciate the whole\npurpose of this stream today is that\npeople are posting questions that give\nme the opportunity to weigh in on things\nthat are important to you guys so i\ndon't think that this phenomenon is by\ndefinition bad i think most things in\nhumanity and most scientific\nadvancements are tools that can either\nbe used for good or evil\nso let's talk a little bit about finn\ndom in this person's particular\nsituation\nso this person kind of says you know\nfor all of you out there don't try finn\ndom because it's way more addictive than\nregular pornography or even only fans\nand so then the question becomes what\ndetermines whether a particular kind of\npornography or like pornographic\nthing is more addictive or less\naddictive than some something else\nand what i've sort of\nfound after you know working with a\nbunch of people is that there's a set of\npsychological vulnerabilities that any\ngiven human being may have and now what\nwe're sort of discovering is that\nthere's a an array of different like\nsexual or pornographic like\nproducts\nthat can tap into each of those\nvulnerabilities the same is actually\ntrue for like video games because not\neveryone plays the same kind of video\ngame right and so there's a lot of\ninteresting research that's coming out\nof the university of toronto\nso they developed this model called\nbrain hex which basically looks at a\npersonality analysis\nand how certain personalities of people\nwill actually prefer certain kinds of\nvideo games and so this kind of thing is\nalso true for like other things on the\ninternet so some people get addicted to\nyoutube some people get addicted to\nreddit some people get addicted to tick\ntock some people get addicted to\nfacebook right so there's something\ngoing on where there are a lot of\ndifferent products and services out\nthere\nand depending on your individual\nvulnerabilities or not even\nvulnerabilities it could be personality\nthat's you know\nyour individual individual\ncharacteristics let's call it that\nyou're going to get addicted to a\nparticular thing so what's going on in\nthis situation and why is it that people\nget addicted to finndom so i'm not sure\nabout this person because i haven't\nreally interacted with them but in my\nexperience you know there are a couple\nof really really important things at\nplay here\nand the first thing to understand is\nthat\na fundamental tenet of human psychology\nis that validation matters more than\nreassurance so let me explain what that\nmeans so when i'm a psychiatrist and i'm\nworking with someone who's suicidal\nwhat the default human idea is is that\nif someone is suicidal you should say if\nsomeone says i have no reason to live\nthe default response is to say that's\nnot true you have so many reasons to\nlive look at how awesome you are you've\ngot this this this and this\nand what we know from a scientific\nperspective is that that is not very\neffective at reducing that person's\nsuicidality what is more effective than\nthat is actually validation so i know it\nsounds kind of weird but as a\npsychiatrist what i've personally found\nto be more effective is to you know when\ni sit with a person who's suicidal is to\nunderstand okay like like really listen\nto them and say\ni can see why you're suicidal because\nthe truth is that there's there is a lot\nof stuff in your life that isn't going\nwell and i have to actually validate\nthat i have to start by meeting them\nwhere they're at i don't start by\nassuming that they're wrong and\nincorrect\ni start by assuming or trying to\nunderstand what is in their mind that\nhelps them come to that conclusion\nand the cool thing about offering a\nvalidating perspective is then that\nactually makes it more effective when i\nsay hey i understand that you don't feel\nlike you have a whole lot of reasons to\nlive right now but i still i'm gonna\nrespectfully disagree and i do think\nthat you have a lot of reasons to live\nis it okay if i make my case to you and\nso that's actually far more effective\nbecause human beings on a very\nfundamental level are looking for\nvalidation and this isn't just about\nsuicidality like we actually know that\nthis is a very fundamental part of like\nhuman emotion and like the way that our\nhuman brain is wired so as an example\nif you look at studies on kids okay and\nif you want to freak out a child\nthe easiest way to freak out a child is\nto have a completely neutral expression\nand neutral expressions like\nreally really freak people out i know it\nsounds kind of weird what does a neutral\nexpression have to do with validation\nbecause a neutral expression validates\nnothing so i know it sounds kind of\nweird but we know that you know when a\nkid stumbles and falls down\nif they start crying and they're sad\nabout it and as a parent what do we do\nwe pick up the child we say oh no no no\ndid baby get hurt oh my god poor little\nbaby it's okay it's okay baby i'm so\nsorry you got hurt oh show me where the\nboo-boo is let me kiss the boo-boo and\nmake it better so if you look at that\nkind of response it's a very validating\nresponse and it works really really well\nwhen\nkids grow up with non-validating\nresponses they tend to end up with\nattachment issues so we have a couple of\nvideos about that there's some stuff\nabout that in dr k's guide if y'all are\nmore interested so these kids grow up to\nbe anxious and if you look at like so\nthere's a video on the anxious\npersonality and some people just have\nanxious personalities and those\npersonalities come from a lack of\nvalidation when growing up\nthere's also another really interesting\nthing about um\nyou know so there's just kind of a side\nnote from medicine\nso one of my mentors was once telling me\nthat you know you can have psychosis\nwhich is like hallucinating and things\nlike that but psychosis is not a\ndiagnosis it's a symptom so sometimes\npsychosis can be caused by schizophrenia\nsometimes it can be caused by depression\nso how can you tell whether psychosis is\ncaused by schizophrenia or how whether\nit's caused by depression there's a\ncomplex diagnostic process\nbut there was a really interesting thing\nthat one of my mentors told me they're\nlike there's a simple like limbic test\nso like it's kind of a way to test your\ngut\nto determine whether the psychosis\nyou're seeing is due to depression or\nschizophrenia and so what the my mentor\ntold me is ask yourself this question if\nyou're sitting across from a patient\nif they were on the subway and there was\na seat open next to them would you sit\ndown next to them\nand i know it sounds kind of weird but\nit's actually a very very good limbic\ntest because people with schizophrenia i\nknow it sounds kind of weird but like\neven when you see them on the street\nlike you kind of like you can sort of\ntell and so how is it that your brain\ncan tell the difference between like\nsomeone who has schizophrenia and\nsomeone who doesn't it actually comes\ndown to flattened affect so affect is\nthe facial expression of emotion\nand so when people have schizophrenia\ntheir affect gets blunted so their like\nface becomes really really neutral and\nit sets us on edge because what happens\nin our brain is like we don't really\nknow\nwhat to expect from this person so when\nsomeone like you know when you can read\nsomeone's emotions it actually makes you\nlike reassured in some way\nand so blunted affect flattened affect\nand like there's something about them\nthat just sort of like triggers alarm\nbells and makes people uncomfortable it\nhappens with kids too so if you look at\na kid with a neutral expression\nit's going to be very like invalidating\nfor what they're feeling right because\nif they're happy you're not validating\nthat if they're sad you're not\nvalidating that and it's going to freak\nthem out\nso this is the key thing to remember is\nthat validation is a very very core\nthing that human beings are looking for\nso now circling back to the fin dom why\nis it that this stuff is potentially\nmore addictive than only fans of regular\npornography\nand if we look at that person's post we\nsee that this person already has a\nconfidence issue right i'm five foot\nfour women will make fun of me i'm a\nvirgin they even identify in the first\nsentence of their post\ni'm 27 year old virgin\nright it's like\nthe second attribute even before mail\nso like this person identifies with the\nidea of being a virgin so this person\nidentifies with sort of being someone\nthat is like\ngoing to be rejected by women and along\ncomes findom which are paying women to\nhumiliate him right so why would someone\ndo that why would someone spend more\nmoney than maybe they have or they feel\ncomfortable with\nto have someone treat them like crap\nlike what kind of reinforcement are you\ngetting there because it's like it's\ncreating a negative emotion in them but\nit's also highly highly addictive or\nreinforcing behavior right so what's\ngoing on there and i think essentially\nwhat's going on is that it's incredibly\nvalidating right because if we have a\nparticular view of ourself\nand someone else like takes that view to\nthe extreme and they're offering an\nextreme form of validation because if\nyou're a five foot four virgin and you\ndon't feel like you're a good person and\nyou don't feel like anyone will ever\ntreat you well you will actually pay\nmoney to someone to reinforce that idea\nwith you it's the same reason why we\nhave cognitive biases for people who are\nnarcissistic right so people like who\nare narcissistic will seek validation\nfrom wherever they can because finding\nconcordance with the outside world is\nreally what our brain craves\nand so if you have a self-esteem problem\nbe really really careful because if you\nfind something that will reinforce\nyour idea of low self-esteem you will\nactually gravitate towards it we also\nsee this in people who have had abusive\nrelationships because a lot of people\nwonder like why on earth does this\nperson keep on getting into\nrelationships with abusive people\nand the short answer i mean i'm\noversimplifying stuff it's obviously\nmore complicated than that but the short\nanswer is that when people ha when\npeople have been abused especially when\nyou have childhood abuse you develop an\nidentity of being not worthy right and\nthen something really bizarre happens if\nyou have that identity of not being\nworthy and that like you're not a good\nperson and you enter into a relationship\nwith someone who treats you with respect\nthe bizarre thing is that people don't\nfeel good about that it actually creates\na ton of anxiety\nthey don't actually like it what what\nhappens in the mind of someone who's\nbeen abused who enters into a healthy\nrelationship is like they get really\nconfused and they become paranoid\nthey're like why is this person treating\nme this way like what is going on like\nwhen is it going to change like why why\nare they saying this to me what's their\ngame\nwhat are they trying to get i don't\nunderstand this doesn't make sense\nbecause our brain has has developed this\nidea of what to expect from other human\nbeings and when things don't line up it\nmakes us deeply uncomfortable\nthe flip side of that coin is validation\nright so like if you think about i don't\nknow if you guys have been in this\nsituation but you know i remember when i\nwas in school like and i got bullied\nlike there were times where i would\nengage in being the recipient of\nbullying because it like made sense to\nme right like because that's my job is\nto be bullied like those are the people\nwho are like the the jocks and the\ncaptain of the football team and i'm the\nloser so i'll even engage in situations\nthat replay that kind of idea there's\nalso research on this from the psycho\nlike psychotherapy so there's this idea\ncalled the repetition compulsion which\nis like there's some really interesting\npapers written about that if you guys\nwant further reading\nbut i think that it's kind of\ninteresting because essentially what's\nhappening with like these evolutions of\npornography is that there are these\nkinds of vulnerabilities and if you have\nthe vulnerability where you feel like\nyou are unworthy of a woman's attention\nand then you start paying a woman to\ngive you the kind of attention\nthat you feel you deserve\nit's going to be incredibly validating\nand incredibly addictive\nso then the question becomes like you\nknow what do i do about this i don't\nthink abstinence from the thing is\nsufficient so is it a step in the right\ndirection absolutely\nbut trying to abstain from an addictive\nbehavior without understanding the roots\nof the behavior\ntends to be the recipe for relapse and\nwe've seen this time and time and time\nagain like i mean i've seen this as an\naddiction psychiatrist where people will\nlike you know say like okay this is the\nlast time like i gotta quit i gotta quit\ni gotta quit but they don't actually do\nthe work to figure out it's not about\nit's not the fact that you need to quit\nwhat you really need to understand if\nyou want to overcome an addiction\nis not the fact that you need to quit\nit's to understand what the addiction\ndoes for you in the first place\nwhat is the addiction doing for you what\nis the purpose it serves what is the\nadvantage that you gain from engaging in\nthis addiction and once you start to\nexplore that once you get to the roots\nof where the addiction is born from\nwhere it comes from and as you start to\naddress those things\nthe actual addictive behaviors will\nstart to like wither\nthey're like leaves on a tree where once\nyou take out the roots the leaves\nthemselves that's what you see that's\nwhat you experience\nthey're all they will all start to\nautomatically wither once you take the\nroot of the problem out\nso if y'all are struggling with some\nkind of you know new addiction and i've\nseen so many of them\nyou got to understand that like\nthis is happening for a reason right\nthat like the internet is a place where\nit allows for a lot of darwinian\nselection we see this for video games we\nsee it for content distribution\nplatforms and we even see it for\npornography and the kind of pornography\nthat you get addicted to it's not just\npornography addiction right it's not one\nthing there's actually a different kind\nof psychological process whether you're\naddicted to pornography or you're\naddicted to only fans or you're addicted\nto finndom or you're addicted to another\nthing\nall of those things are going to be\nworking on your brain in slightly\ndifferent ways and so if you want to\novercome those specific addictions it\ninvolves understanding what is this\nparticular manifestation of pornography\ndoing for me what is the psychological\nvulnerability that it's kind of\nexploiting and take advantage of what is\nit what is it doing for me that other\nkinds of pornography don't do for me\nand once you understand what those\nfundamental psychological needs are then\nyou can start working on them and as you\nwork through those fundamental\npsychological needs the need for\npornography or whatever you're into will\nactually start to reduce\nquestions\nso how do you figure out what your needs\nare so that's a really good question\nso i'd say that you know so the first\nthing is you can definitely work with a\ntherapist i saw a couple of posts that\npeople were saying like you know my\ntherapist was like just masturbate less\ni'm sorry you got a therapist like that\nsucks\nyou can absolutely work with a therapist\nfor pornography addiction there are\npeople that sort of specialize in it and\nthings like that\nbut i'd say that you can even do a lot\nof this work on your own right so like\nyou can just ask yourself like you know\non a given day like let's say you've got\nfin dom versus only fans versus like\npornography and you'll notice that\nyou're gravitating towards one versus\nthe other\nso when you gravitate towards it i know\nit's kind of weird but just ask yourself\nthe question like how does this make me\nfeel\ncompared to something else\nso if let's say your problem is like\nonly fans versus like let's say pornhub\nokay\nand so then ask yourself like what is it\nabout only fans what do i feel when i\nwatch only fans that like\nwhat do i feel how is this different\nand this is where like meditation can\nactually be really helpful i'm not\nsaying meditation for the purpose of\njust meditating then it'll get better\nthe purpose of meditation is to learn a\nsystematic way of introspection right so\nyou like kind of close your eyes and\nlike you kind of think about pornhub for\na second and then like you kind of like\nthink okay what is this going to do for\nme what feels unsatisfying about it and\nthen if you look at something like only\nfans then like you can kind of ask\nyourself the question there too what\nfeels so satisfying about this what is\nit about this that that really draws me\nin\nand what you'll find is probably\nsomething along the lines of like i feel\nnoticed here i feel like i have a\nrelationship i feel a connection to this\nperson\nand then what you kind of tunnel down\ninto is that okay so like it's not just\npornography it's like pornography plus\nconnection so what i really want is like\nsome kind of sexual relationship in\nwhich like i feel connected to the other\nperson\nand once you become aware of your own\nneeds\nthat's the first step to actually\novercoming them i do think that this is\nwhere like you know a systematic\napproach and also working with an\nindividual like a therapist i don't know\nif this is really\ni want to say that this is probably\noutside of the realm of coaching so\ncoaches do have a lot of experience\nwith people who are you know addicted to\npornography it's like a big part of our\ncommunity and at the same time i think\nreally at that level you may be better\nbenefited by a therapist as opposed to a\ncoach but you can always give coaching a\ntry\num but i think it's just doing good\nintrospective work right it's like\nreally looking at yourself and asking\nyourself what is it about this that\nreally attracts me\nare all addictions bad yes i'd say so\nbecause i'd say the definition of an\naddiction is something that impairs\nfunction so a lot of people in the early\ndays of healthy gamer would ask me back\nwhen we talked primarily about video\ngame addiction how do i know if i'm\naddicted\nand the short answer is if it causes a\nproblem it is a problem so how do you\ndraw the line between like a healthy\namount of pornography use or an\nunhealthy amount of pornography use if\nit starts to cause problems in your life\nlike it prevents you from engaging in\nrelationships if it prevents you from\ndoing other things if you become\ndependent on it for emotional like\nsuppression or emotional coping then\nit's a problem so if it causes a problem\nit is a problem\num does the addiction go deeper than i'm\nlonely and want a girlfriend maybe right\nthat's not something that i can answer\nso this is like what we try to do at\nhealthygamer is like there isn't a\nanswer to this question so this is why\nlike our approach at healthy gamer is\nnot like and this is what the internet\ndoes right so like the internet will\nhave like a blog and in the blogger the\nperson is like here is how you fix this\nproblem or you'll have someone who's\nlike you know one of these success gurus\nwho's like here's the formula to success\nit's it's a video course that you can\npurchase that's going to be same the\nsame for every single person out there\nbecause it's a guaranteed formula for\nsuccess if you don't like it your money\nback guaranteed here's how i make 18\nfigures a month\nyou know\nit's it's the formula for success so\neveryone out there is asking for like\nwhat's the right answer so our approach\nat healthy gamer and this is a big\nreason why dr k's guide was created the\nway that it was dr k's guide is not\nlinear right\nit's like because the idea behind dr k's\nguide is that one answer is not going to\nwork for every person so if you're\nstruggling with depression\nthere's going to be clinical aspects of\nit and non-clinical aspects of it what\ndoes your depression manifest as is this\na sense like are you depressed because\nyou've fallen behind are you depressed\nbecause you have protective hopelessness\nare you depressed because you grew up in\nan environment with conditional love\nwhere your sense of worth is tied to\nyour accomplishments so you can't learn\nhow to be happy unless you're successful\nso what is the origin of your depression\nbecause for different people it's going\nto be different\nand this is why what we try to advocate\nthis is why we answer questions like\nthis this isn't just like here are the\nfeatures of pornography addiction we'll\nsometimes do that as well but we try to\nanswer these specific questions because\nthe truth is is that pornography\naddiction is not monolithic it's not one\ndisease it's actually a plethora of\ndifferent diseases that affect people in\nunique ways it's the same reason why\naddiction is not one disease people have\na drug of choice right some people get\naddicted to alcohol some people get\naddicted to cocaine some people get\naddicted to marijuana\nand each of these substances interacts\nwith us in a different way the\nsubstances are also a little bit\ndifferent because it does appear that\nthere's a genetic vulnerability to\nparticular kinds of addiction\nunclear whether that's true in\npornography or not but what i really\nhave seen is that if you want to like\novercome your pornography addiction you\nhave to take an individual approach you\ncan use these general principles but\nthat's why like in dr k's guide like a\nlot of his exercises right that's why we\nhave a coaching program and we started\nwith the coaching program and then did\ndr k's guide second because what we\nreally found is that to create\nsubstantive change in your life\nyou need a personal approach there isn't\na formula to success there's just your\nformula to success your challenges your\ngenetic makeup your circumstances your\nliving conditions your traumatic\nexperiences your strengths the things\nthat you're good at the things that\nyou're passionate about the things that\nyou're inspired\nby\nall of those are highly individual so if\nyou want to put your life together it\ninvolves understanding all of those\nfactors\nyou know a walkthrough only works if\neveryone has the same is if everyone is\nplaying the same game and starts from\nthe same location you guys get that the\nonly reason we can have a stock\nwalkthrough on the internet\nis because everyone spawns in the same\nplace in a video game you can't create a\nwalkthrough when there are a thousand\ndifferent spawn points it's impossible\nso this is the big problem is that like\neveryone out there is giving stock\nsolutions\nto shared problems but it's been my\nexperience and i may be heavily\ninfluenced because i'm a clinician right\nso i tend to work with individuals is\nthat if you want to put together your\nlife you can't use a stock solution you\nhave to use an individual solution\nso going back to am i does it does the\naddiction go deeper than em i am lonely\nand want a girlfriend it could\nright but for some people getting a\ngirlfriend will be enough for some\npeople engaging in a relationship that\noffers authentic connection and has a\nsexual component will\ndefinitely help reduce the porno the\npornography use or whatever\nand for some people it may be\ninsufficient right because for some\npeople who get a girlfriend we've heard\nthis a lot by the way\nthat once you get a girlfriend like the\npornography becomes really weird and you\nget filled with guilt because you're\nwatching pornography because your brain\nis habituated to it right so it's not\njust like it's not a psychological\nvulnerability at some point it gets\nbecomes a habit so now if i'm habitually\naddicted to pornography and i start\nhaving a relationship with a woman\ni will feel guilty because like i have\nthese habits this habit circuitry that\ncauses me to still watch pornography\nbecause you can't drop it like a you\nknow can't drop it like that\nand then once i feel guilty then what\nthat guilt does is pushes me more\ntowards pornography because there's good\nevidence that pornography is used as an\nemotional coping mechanism so the more\nguilty you feel the more pornography you\nwatch the more pornography you watch the\nmore guilty you feel because you've got\na girlfriend and then you don't want to\ntell her and then at some point she\nfinds out and then you're embarrassed\nand she feels upset she feels like she's\nnot enough for you she gets concerned\nthat you're she's not enough for you and\nthen she starts crying and then you feel\neven guilty and it's back to the porno\nit's like it's a whole vicious cycle\nright and it comes down to understanding\nwhat is the pornography doing for you\nis it a source of emotional coping and\nonce you understand that then you can\nhopefully have a conversation with her\nand you can have a conversation with\nyour girlfriend and it's like\nyou know hey like i've been doing this\nfor a long time like i really
