    "transcript": "this is a post essentially about someone\nwho like starts to form a healthy\nrelationship gets overly clingy overly\ninvested and then ends up driving the\nother person away\nso why does this happen and how do we\nget out of this right so\ni got ghosted now i'm wondering if i\nknow how to be in a healthy relationship\nso i'm a 30 year old guy who feels like\nhe drives people away\ni can be while not wanting to be very\nguarded and secretive i think this stems\nfrom a childhood of being bullied by my\nfamily for no apparent reason it was a\ncommon occurrence to be told by family\nmember by family that i was an\nembarrassment had the wrong personality\nwas an or a piece of\ni remember things like being told as a\nkid to list out loud the people that\nwould come to my hypothetical funeral is\na way of proving to me that no one will\nmourn my death and be accused of\nlying when i go to spend time with my\nfriends because it was unbelievable that\nanyone would like me\nit was hurtful and confusing it felt\nlike relationships were guessing games\nwhere i was always the loser i became a\nloner\nnow i work hard to connect with new\npeople i've noticed that when new\nrelationships don't go well or the way i\nwould like them to i blame myself\ni think a good example of this is a girl\ni like that i've been talking to since\nmarch when we first started talking it\nwas amazing how quickly we clicked it\nsurprised me we eventually had less time\nfor me as she got busier in her personal\nlife\nwhen she started to get busy i got\nnervous a lot of people have ghosted me\nso i fearfully and baselessly suspected\nshe was trying to break contact i never\naddressed these feelings with her though\nmy response was to text her a lot almost\nas if to remind her i still existed i\nwas stuck in a pattern of wanting to\ntalk to her but then worrying about\ngiving her space or doing something\nwrong until i would convince myself to\ntext anyway\nsoon my texts grew longer hers shorter\nthis would continue until she suddenly\nblocked me a couple of days ago\nfriends have been telling me not to\nblame myself and that i did nothing\nwrong but shouldn't i blame myself i\nfeel like i drove her away i genuinely\nreally liked her even loved her but i\nfeel like i was stuck in my head never\nincluding her i also feel like this\nrelationship was burdened by my slowly\nobsessing over her without paying enough\nattention to her as an actual person i\nfeel like i ruined things\ndr k how can i have healthy\nrelationships with myself and others\ngoing forward why do i become guarded\nand respond obsessive in relationships\nhow do i deal with my surprise when\nwomen like me back let's upload this all\nright so this is a great post\nso i like this post for a number of\nreasons\nthe first reason i like this post is\nbecause the person who posted is an\nabsolute boss\nokay\nso\nlet me compose my thoughts\nso this is a post about someone who\nenters into relationships with people\nis guarded generally speaking had a very\ntraumatic upbringing\nand then something happens in the\nrelationship where they click right away\nthey get along really well\nand then as circumstances in life cause\nthe person that they're talking to to\nkind of pull back\nthey become very very clingy and then\nlike end up driving the other person to\nblock them okay\nso like if you're if this is a post\nessentially about someone who like\nstarts to form a healthy relationship\ngets overly clingy overly invested and\nthen ends up driving the other person\naway\nso why does this happen and how do we\nget out of this right so how do we stop\nbeing creepy people that women have to\nblock\nso the first thing to understand\nis that this is all about understanding\nthe evolution of your needs throughout a\nrelationship\nokay\nso to begin with we have a history of a\ntraumatic upbringing and so like this is\none thing one question i would ask for\nthis person is when this person\nwas treated traumatically or abusively\nwhat did you how did it make you feel\nand what did you do\nokay so this is really important because\nsometimes when we're treated like\nabusively like emotionally abusively\nlike my parents and other people\nwe feel responsible for making them feel\nbetter and liking us\nright so like if this person is being\nmean to me that's not on them that's on\nme and we see the current of self-blame\nthroughout this kind of thing\nthen something else is interesting is\nhappening is that this person's when\nthey go to their friends right they're\nsaying like hey this situation happened\ni started texting this person more and\nmore stuff and they weren't responding\nto me and they blocked me\nis it my fault and then your friends do\nwhat they reassure you and they say no\nman of course it's not your fault she's\na total b word like it's totally like i\ncan't believe she was so cruel to you\nlike you're not doing anything wrong\nyou're doing everything great\nand this is where i gotta say if people\nif you find yourself in a in a pattern\nof like people blocking you\nmaybe you need to take some\nresponsibility and this is why i think\nthis person is an absolute boss because\nlike they're asking this question in a\nvery authentic way right they don't want\nto continue doing this they're\nrecognizing that there are things going\non and that maybe they need to change\nthem\nso i would actually say that does this\nblame lie with you at least 50\nis what i would say because remember\nthat in any relationship you have a\ncontribution the good news is that the\nblame does lie with you you also have\nthe power to change things right so you\ncan't have agency without responsibility\nresponsibility doesn't come without\nagency if it's my respect if i have the\npower to\nwin then i also have the power to lose\nand so if i get credit for the win i\nalso have to take credit for the loss\nso now let's try to understand what's\ngoing on here\nand i think the key thing to understand\nhere is the evolution of internal needs\nas you get clean gear and cling gear\nso in the first phase of the\nrelationship you meet someone you all\nclick right away so like you have some\nemotional needs they're not very\npowerful at that point because it's\nearly stage in the relationship and on\nthe other end of the relationship\nthey're not really powerful as well like\nyou know you guys are kind of like\nyou're kind of chilling you guys like\neach other you hang out a little bit\nit's a low investment relationship that\nfeels really natural\nand then what starts to happen so like\nthings were fine until this person got\nbusy in their personal life right so the\ngirl that this person is talking to\nstarts to get busy so due to a\ncircumstance in this person's life they\nstart becoming less available now how\ndoes the poster respond to this\nthis is where things get really\ninteresting because they start to get\nanxious and they start to get clingy\nright they start to like even though in\ntheir head\nthey understand that like this person is\nbusier now so they can't text as much as\nthey used to that's not the way that you\nrespond emotionally right you start to\nget really really anxious you start\ntexting more\nokay so now you are adding another need\ninto this relationship and i don't know\nif this is going to make sense but now\nyour anxiety you are actually looking to\nthe other person to fix\nso when you send a text like a long text\nwhat you're looking for is for them to\nsend an equally long text because now\nyou're worried you're like oh what if\nthis person doesn't like me what if\nthey're drifting away let me like do\nsomething big in the relationship let me\nsend a big text and if they send a big\ntext back then i will be sued i'll be\nlike oh thank god\nthey really do care about me or if they\napologize or they say oh like i've been\nreally busy lately i'm sorry i haven't\nhad time for you like that's going to\nmake you feel good so now you're adding\na new\nneed an emotional need into the\nrelationship where you need this person\nto tell you hey i still want to be your\nfriend hey don't worry about it you're\nlooking for reassurance from that\nanxiety as this person is starting to\npull away and where does that anxiety\ncome from it comes from the fact that\npeople pulled away from you in the past\nright it comes from the idea that like\nyou haven't you've been taught that\nyou're like not a worthy person that you\npeople don't want to be your friend and\nso now what happens is when you like\ngrow up in a situation where like\nliterally your parents traumatize you by\nsaying who's going to be at your funeral\nain't no one going to be at your funeral\nbecause no one wants to be your friend\nso that some scar that psychological\ntrauma is is carried in your mind so\nthen when this person starts to pull\naway because of like work-related stuff\nor other things going on in her life\nthat fear in your mind activates and\nit's like oh my god\ni know in my head logically that this\nperson is just busier but what if what\nmy parents told me all along is true\nthat this person that they're i'm not\nthey really don't want to be my friend\nso to alleviate that anxiety you send a\nbig text right you send a frequent text\nand and this person i mean this is why i\nthink this person's done a lot of\nintrospection so i want you to look at\nthis\nwhen she started to get busy i got\nnervous so what is the nature of that\nnervousness\na lot of people have ghosted me\nso i fearfully and baselessly suspected\nshe was trying to break contact this is\nimportant it wasn't baseless\nthis isn't baseless right because it's\nhappened to you before you need to often\nlike you need to validate that feeling\num and so here's the thing\nuh\nso\nyeah so my response was to text her a\nlot almost as if to remind her i still\nexisted and this is the key thing that\nyou need to work on\nbecause at this point you feel\ninternally\nthat\nyou don't exist in the relationship so\nyou were trying to get her to tell you\nlike hey you exist in this relationship\nyou exist in this relationship right so\nnow your emotional needs are creating a\nsituation where you are asking something\nof her without her realizing what you're\nasking because you've never told her\nso you're looking for a sign from her\nthat you still exist in the relationship\nbut she doesn't know that right so like\nshe now what's happening is you're\nfeeling all these emotional needs like\nyou're feeling like clingy and you're\nfeeling like don't pull away like hey\nplease remember i exist please remember\ni'm your friend like say something to me\nand as you put all of those needs into\nyour text messages\nlike empathically between the lines like\nreading between the lines like there's\nsomething like desperate in those text\nmessages she gets confused because she's\nlike what is going on here right and it\nmakes sense because you haven't actually\nexplained to her how you feel you're\njust like sending these really long text\nmessages that she's not reciprocating\nand so like then she starts to pull away\nbecause she doesn't understand what's\ngoing on here because now you've added a\nlayer of needs into the relationship\nthat she's unaware of\nas she starts to pull away\nit reinforces everything right so as she\npulls away more the anxiety increases\nyou need to remind her even more that\nyou exist because as her responses get\nshorter you start to disappear in her\nmind\nand as you disappear in her mind the\nanxiety gets worse\nthe need for some kind of response gets\nworse the reassurance gets worse so then\nyou send even longer text messages and\nyou inject a even more powerful need\ninto the relationship\nand she gets even more confused because\nshe's like what's going on here like\nthese guys sending me like 14 texts and\nlike\nwhat's up with this\nand so then what she does is send a\nshorter response and as she sends a\nshorter response you shrink\nright\nyou become i you stop to start to fade\naway out of existence even more\nand as you feel that fading away the\ndesperation increases hey remember i'm\nhere remember i'm here i'm a person i'm\na person i have feelings don't forget\nabout me please please please don't\nforget about me that's what your texts\nstart to say\ndon't forget about me i exist and she\ndoesn't know what to do with that\nbecause that's not actually what you're\nsaying right she's just getting these\nreally long text messages and then she\nhas no choice but to block you\nso then what happens when she blocks you\nyou get reinforced right oh what my\nparents said all along is true\nis that people don't want to be my\nfriend\nthat it's like it's not\nthat i don't deserve friends\nnow another person\ni've ceased to exist in another person's\nmind and then your mind will say this is\nhow it's been all along this is the\ntruth of the world you will never exist\nin anyone's mind right that's what it\ntells you in those dark moments it's\nsomething it's the the voice in your\nhead that you carry with you\nthat now has been reinforced and then\nyou go to your friends and you say hey\nwhat's going on here and your friends\nsay oh don't worry about it it's no big\ndeal it's on her it has nothing to do\nwith you you're great\nyou're an awesome person we like you\nand so that can be very reassuring in\nsome way but you have to remember that\nif this pattern is repeating in your\nlife there's a reason it's repeating\nright like there's a reason there's\nsomething going on that you're injecting\ninto these relationships where people\nare ghosting you\nand i suspect the main thing that you're\ninjecting is this\nanxiety this fear that people are are\nlike going away and this person even\nkind of says it where they kind of say\nyou know\num\ni i get stuck in my own head and this is\nwhere the relationship falls apart\nbecause a relationship is between two\npeople\nand if you get stuck in your own head\nyou're like playing your own tune\nright it's like imagine you're like\ntrying to dance with someone and there's\nlike music playing but then you've got\nheadphones that's playing a different\nsong\nand so you guys are trying to dance in\nrhythm and they're playing to like the\nmusic that's playing and like they're\nlistening to some waltz okay because\nyou're at a wedding\nand then you've got like headphones on\nand you're listening to tupac and like\nthe the kind of dancing that you're\ngoing to be doing to the music in your\nown head is something that they can't\ndance to because they don't hear it so\nthe more you get stuck in your own head\nlike you're no longer in a relationship\nright because you're you're engaging in\nthis relationship\nwith like\noperating from your own thinking\nand if you don't communicate with her\nthen the other person doesn't understand\nwhat you're listening to they just see\nyou like convulsing on the dance floor\nand they're like i don't know how to\ndance with this person and so then they\nstep off the dance floor\nso are there things that you can do\nabout it absolutely\nthe first thing is like understand when\nthe music starts playing in your head\nbecause if you look at this relationship\nthey're saying at the beginning\neverything's fine right so at the\nbeginning we're both dancing the same\nmusic and then she starts to get busy at\nwork and then you're like ah your brain\nis like i remember this she's busy at\nwork let me put the headphones on and\nlet me start listening to something else\nokay\nand then you get stuck in your own head\nand then you're operating from that\nspace you're doing all this work and\nthen you separate from her right so\nshe's over here you guys are together\nand then you start getting in your own\nhead but like she doesn't understand\nwhat's going on here so like you start\nto deviate off this way and then she's\nkind of going this way and then it's\nlike then the relationship falls apart\nso if you want to be successful in a\nsituation like this the first thing to\nunderstand is what are the emotions that\narise\nas this stuff happens and more\nimportantly as these emotions arise how\ndo they influence your behavior\nbecause if you're being driven\nby emotions to do particular things and\nthey are not on the same wavelength\nthey're going to be taken aback by what\nyou're doing and they're not going to\nknow how to interact with you because\nnow you're dancing to your own tune and\nthey're like trying to dance with you\nand it's like hey we used to be dancing\nand now you're kind of like dancing on\nyour own i'm confused how do i\nparticipate in this relationship\nand then since people don't know how to\nhave healthy conversations right so like\nyou know the right thing for her to do\nin that situation is hey like\nyou're sending me all these text\nmessages like what's going on\nlike help me understand what's going on\nlike\nyou know like what like you seem\nanxious to me\nso ideally she would be able to prompt\nthe conversation\nbut instead what we do is we just ghost\npeople because that's like what happens\nnowadays right\nso are you somewhat responsible if\nyou're in this situation i'd say yes i\nthink it's time to take responsibility\nare you to blame no so i don't blame you\nfor it i don't think you're a bad person\ni don't think it's like in a sense or\ni'd say it's is it your fault sort of\nbut i think it's absolutely excusable\nbecause your brain has been programmed\nin a particular way you have these\nfundamental needs that have never been\nmet that allows you to be secure in a\nrelationship because this person can't\ntolerate someone else pulling away from\nthe relationship even for things that\nhave nothing to do with the relationship\nlike real life getting in the way work\ngetting busy\nso when someone else pulls away you\ncan't tolerate that anxiety you can't\ntolerate that distance and when you\ncan't tolerate the anxiety it causes you\nto change your behavior and when you\nchange your behavior now you're you're\ndancing to your own tune so all the\nmessages are operating from like a place\ninside your head which the other person\nisn't aware of so they're like they get\nfreaked\nf out and then they start to pull away\nand then they end up ghosting\nso i'd say first understand\nas these feelings arise what are you\nafraid of what's going on why do you\nfeel like you have to text her why do\nyou why does she need to know that you\nexist because that's the key thing\nwhat is it like to feel like you don't\nexist anymore in this person's life and\nprocess those feelings\nbecause as you process those feelings\nand you reduce the fuel in that fire\nthen the behaviors will naturally go\naway\nright you have to remove the emotional\nenergy that that leads to the clingy\nbehaviors\nit's not sufficient to just not text\nbecause then what'll happen is if you\nforce yourself to not not text you'll\nforce yourself to not text and then\nit'll be a tension in you it'll start to\nbuild up don't text don't text don't\ntext don't text don't text and then\nit'll reach a cresting point and then\nyou won't be able to control it then\nit's going to be like it's like a\nrelease where you're like you have to\ntext you can't control it oh i have to\ntext\nand then you feel like oh thank god okay\nlike notice me now notice me i can't\ncontrol myself notice me\nand then she's like what's what's\nhappening here you're doing all this\nyou're dancing this whole opera in your\nhead and she doesn't know how to keep up\nand so then she withdraws\nso understand the emotions that arise\nfirst and foremost and work on those\nemotions\nwork on those needs understand what your\nemotional needs are in the relationship\nand how they evolve and the only way\nthat a successful relationship is going\nto work is when\nyour emotional needs can be at least\nunderstood by the other person and then\nhopefully if you're lucky that person is\nwilling to meet you halfway and try to\ndo what they can for your emotional\nneeds\ngreat post\nso then someone else is saying how do\nyou handle when she is really leaving\nyou let her go\nright\nso this is hard but someone's asking how\ndo you handle when she's really leaving\nthe answer is simple you let her go\nand this is the key thing\nwhat makes it hard to let her go because\nwe assume that the reason she's leaving\nis because of us\nwhereas the truth is is that most people\nin life when they part ways they do so\nbecause of a thousand reasons that have\nnothing to do with you\nright\nif you think about like you know the\nfriends that i had in high school why am\ni not friends with most of them anymore\nit's because of circumstance\ni went to high school then i went to\ncollege in a different city and then i\nwent to medical school in a different\nstate\nand then i did residency in the in the\nsame state but people went their\nseparate ways\nand so i entered people's lives and then\ni left people's lives and that has it\nhas nothing to do with them\nbecause that's that's what life is\nright life is like a meeting of like\ndifferent it's moments in time where you\nconnect with another human being and for\nsome people those moments are short and\nfor some people those moments are long\nand you have to understand that like not\neverything in the world people leaving\nyour life\nmay not have anything to do with you\nand even in the sense if it does have to\nsomething to do with you that's okay too\nbecause even if someone says hey i don't\nthink we're compatible like that's okay\nright you're not going to be compatible\nwith every person on the planet\nyou're not going to be compatible with\nevery person that you date that's the\nreason that you date\nand you let people go their way and you\ngo your way because at the end of the\nday if someone wants to leave you let\nthem\nwhat are you going to do like pin them\ndown and like force them into a\nrelationship with you you deserve a\nbetter relationship with that\nthe relationship that you want is one\nwhere someone wants to be with you and\nfeels comfortable being with you that's\nwhat you really deserve is a real\nrelationship\nso it's tough\nyeah i like you on netflix i think it's\ngreat i'm on season two right now\nokay\nso do we need shorter text messages\nabsolutely right so like don't i don't\nknow how like you can't expect someone\nto keep up with all of the stuff that\nyou're doing in your head\nno relationship is gonna work like that\nright when you're like working through\nbunches of anxiety there's tons of\nanxieties floating out there you try to\ncommunicate with someone over text like\nthey're not gonna like they're operating\nwith like 10 of the information where\nyour text is coming from so that's not\ngoing to work\nso you have to let people know like you\neither have to process the crap in your\nhead so that you're kind of back on the\nsame page with them or you need to let\nthem know where you are so that you give\nthem the opportunity to like catch up to\nyou and the more you progress up here\nlike the more you build castles in the\nsky or read into relationships or like\nthink that the relationship is more than\nit is\ncheck out only fans for example\nthe more blind side of the other person\nis going to be\nlike how is someone supposed to\nparticipate in a relationship where\nyou've advanced at 10 000 years in your\nhead\nyeah so someone saying someone is saying\ni can't avoid being so attached because\ni can't make friends absolutely right so\nthat's the same as this post that's why\ni shared and i thought it was a great\npost because because it is the inability\nto make friends that makes every\npotential friend\nso much more attached\nyou get so attached to everyone\nand it's the fact that you get so\nattached to them\nthat you kind of drive them away\nand so you're kind of stuck in this loop\nof like i have no friends and therefore\nanytime i have the possibility of a\nfriend i put too much on them because\nyou take all that luggage from the past\nand you dump it into this relationship\nand when you dump it on then it's too\nmuch for them to handle so then they\nleave and then they when they leave they\nleave you a piece of luggage too so now\nyou've got one more piece of luggage and\nthen the next person comes along and you\ndump 10 pieces of luggage on them and\nit's like too much for them to handle\nthey're like i can't carry all this\nstuff and then they leave and then you\nhave 11 pieces of luggage\nso it's really hard don't get me wrong\nit's very hard\nand so that's where i think the solution\nis to like on like let go of the luggage\nright like you have to work through that\nstuff you have to work through what's it\nlike being alone\nyear after year after year what's it\nlike engaging in relationship after\nrelationship after a relationship\nso it's an infinite loop only if that's\nthe loop that you keep\ndoing remember there are other things\nthat you can do you can offload the\nluggage right you can see a therapist\nyou can work with a coach i think group\ncoaching is a really good avenue for\nthis kind of thing because it's like an\nopportunity for people to form\nrelationships with each other that have\nvery good strict boundaries so it's like\na way to practice\ntalking to each other communicating your\nfeelings like it's like\nhow to make friends one-on-one because\nin group we don't let you be friends\nso we're gonna teach you all of these\nskills and as you start to\nas you bring luggage into the\nrelationship and you want to play games\nwith someone we're going to say no no\nyou're not allowed to do that\ninstead of playing games with them\nbecause you feel connected talk about\nhow you want to play games with them\nvocalize your feelings understand what's\ngoing on on the inside\nright bring all your luggage by all\nmeans toss it our way we're ready to\ntake it but we're not going to give in\nto it we're not going to give you the\nrelationship that you want to what we're\ngoing to do is help you unburden\nyourself of the luggage\nso i think group coaching is very good\nfor this\nso if you guys have this problem of\nbeing lonely and like driving people\naway and like having difficulty\ninteracting with other human beings\ngroup coaching is literally it's like 12\nweeks of training about like how to\ninteract with other human beings how to\nlisten how to be heard how to vocalize\nyour feelings how to connect with other\npeople how to understand yourself\nhow to understand other people\nhow to step aside from your own biases\nand really listen to someone else\nyou"
