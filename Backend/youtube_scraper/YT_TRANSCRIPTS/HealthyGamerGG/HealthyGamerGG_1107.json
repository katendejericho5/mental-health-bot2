    "transcript": "and so what i respect so much about the\nplayers is to like step into this arena\nwhich is like not designed for victory\nit's an arena that's designed for\nfailure\nso welcome\nhow's everybody doing today\nwelcome to another um healthy gamer gg\nstream my name is olo kanojo i'm a\npsychiatrist practicing in boston this\nchat box is big i'm going to move this\nover a little bit\njust a reminder that everything we\ndiscuss on stream today is intended to\nbe for educational purposes only and\nnothing is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice\nso if you guys have a question please go\nsee a licensed professional\nuh\nokay\nso just a couple of announcements so for\nthose of you who don't know\num\ndr k has been out for a couple of weeks\nuh i had the privilege of\naccompanying evil geniuses to the\ninternational\num which was quite the experience and\ntoday i'm gonna share with you guys what\nthat was like\nyeah so today we're gonna be talking a\nlittle bit about just the experience of\nbeing a ti\nand a couple of like important lessons\nthat i learned and um we may be talking\nmore about this\nin depth uh over the next few weeks like\nwe i'm gonna be sharing some of the the\nkey things and like more applicable\nstuff\nabout um kind of performance and and how\nto manage confidence and doubt and all\nthat kind of stuff\nso um\nyeah so we'll hopefully we'll like put\nthat together a little bit today i just\nwanted to kind of check in with y'all\nand uh hang out with chat some\nso yeah\na couple of other uh\na couple of other\nnotes um so next week we're not gonna be\non a regular stream schedule\nwe've got um\nwe've got another project super secret\nproject that we're working on at hg\nwhich uh hopefully we may stream so i\nthink we're gonna be around on monday\nfor austin show and then after that\nwe're gonna be\nout probably for the rest of the week\nand then we'll resume a regular sleep a\nstreaming schedule starting in november\na couple of other things that people are\nkind of curious about\nso um here at healthy gamer we do a lot\nof stuff for gamers but then we also do\na lot of stuff for parents of gamers so\nuh you know we'll sometimes get requests\nfrom parents who are like hey my son is\nlike oh like they're having problems and\nyou know they're not doing things and\num\nyou know like they play too many video\ngames and then they'll be like they'll\nask us like hey can you like can i\nenroll my son in your coaching program\nand we'll be like well if he wants to\ncome he's more than welcome to\nbut you can't enroll him what you can do\nis enroll yourself in our parent\ncoaching program\nand then they say well no i'm not the\none with the problem my kid is the one\nwith the problem and that's where we're\nlike well we're not so sure we agree\nwith that\nso we are actually going to be um\nlaunching more parent coaching spots on\nnovember 11th so some of that we may\nactually try to do like some content uh\naround parents\nand so be prepared for that so like we\nmay have some parent and family related\nquestions people who are in\nrelationships with gamers and things\nlike that\nso um you know we're i i think it's\nactually something that we don't really\ndo a whole lot on stream which is\nactually a lot of fun i really enjoy\nworking with parents i really enjoy\nhelping parents sort of better\ncommunicate and understand their kids\nand also helping like parents work on\nthemselves because a lot of times the\nthe problems that children have will be\nlike related to like parents\num so you know hopefully we'll we'll\ndo a little bit more of that and kind of\nsupport\num you know parent-child relationships\nin terms of like communicating but\nunderstanding each other and things like\nthat\ni need to enroll yeah so good luck with\nmy mom i need to enroll my wife exactly\nso that's what we try to do so i know\nit's kind of unorthodox i know it's a\nlittle bit uh weird right because like\nwe're healthy gamer but i do think that\num\na big part of\nwhat you all struggle with as gay or\nwhat we struggle with as gamers like\nit's not just us right there's a lot of\nthings in our lives there are a lot of\nrelationships that we have\nsometimes we have toxic influences and\nlike working on that side is like really\nimportant too\nyou can enroll joe mama that's the one\nexception\num\ndr k's guide to secret projects okay so\nlet's start talking about ti\nall right so for those of you that don't\nknow there is an esport called dota 2\nand every year they have or most years\nanyway\nthey have a major tournament called the\ninternational and the international is\nthe largest esports prize pool like\nbasically every year so this year it was\nlike a 45 million dollar prize pool and\nyou've got 16 to 18 teams i think that\nare competing\num every year\nand so i had uh the honor of\naccompanying evil geniuses\num\nto the international and we had been\nworking together for actually the whole\nyear so we'll talk about that in a\nsecond\nbut here's like the first thing so i've\ndone a lot of work in esports but i have\nnever accompanied an actual team and\nlike you know\nbeen with them\nintensively for\nsuch a large tournament i mean i guess\ntheoretically it's you know ti's the\nbiggest tournament of the year in\nesports in general\nand boy like the experience is like\nabsolutely wild so the first thing that\nlike i was very surprised about is i've\nhad i've been in a lot of like stressful\nsituations so like there's this slight\ntrigger warning around physical stuff\ni'm like like people being sick but so i\nremember when i was an intern in\nresidency we had one code and if you\nguys don't know what a code is a code is\nlike what you guys see on tv when people\npull out the paddles and stuff it's like\nbasically when someone's like\nyou know like in kind of some kind of\nlike uh ventricular fibrillation or\nsomething like that so like their heart\nisn't working\nand or their heart stops beating and\nthen you have to like do chest\ncompressions and stuff\nso these are like really stressful\nthings like you get you know like the\nthe pa over in the hospital is like code\nblue code blue room whatever and then\nthere's like a swarm of people that run\ninto the room and i remember there was\nthis one particular code where there was\nsomeone who had a problem with their\nheart and i was doing like chest\ncompressions and like you know the the\nmovies don't show you this but like a\nvery common thing that happens when\npeople like or you know you're doing\nchest compressions on people is you'll\ndo like in like\nyou have to\ncause the heart to beat right or not\nbeat but you're like squeezing blood out\nof the heart that's literally what\nyou're doing so sometimes like you know\nwhat they would tell us in residency is\nit's okay to crack a rib to like save a\nlife so you have to like push down\nreally hard\nthe other thing that they don't really\ntell you is that oftentimes when you're\ndoing chest compressions people will\nstart to vomit\ni'm not sure why but so i remember like\nvery distinctly probably the most\nintensive code that i ever had ever been\na part of\num was like one where i was doing chest\ncompressions like the person was like\nvomiting on me and it was like just\nawful and disgusting very very high\nstress i've been in other stressful\nsituations like\nyou know\nacute suicidality um my wife giving\nbirth to kids like just really high\nstress stuff\nand\nnothing compare like that doesn't even\ncompare at all to the experience of like\nbeing a ti the amount of stress and\npressure i'm not even playing\nand like the amount of stress and\npressure that these people deal with\nlike on a daily and hourly basis is\nabsurd\nlike it's hard to describe but you can\nfeel like the pressure in the air and\ni've been in tense situations like i've\nbeen in you know board rooms where\npeople are like arguing and like ceos\nare about to get fired and like super\nawkward stuff right like very\nchallenging things like being yelled at\nin the emergency room when someone who's\nlike rich and powerful is going to sue\nyou because\nyou know their son relapsed again or\nwhatever like there have been a lot of\nstressful situations i've been in but\nlike ti is just a whole different\nexperience it is hands down the most\nstressful experience of my life\nand i wasn't even playing\nso and the first thing that i kind of\nwant to like say is like it's absurd so\nwhat i would describe the feeling as is\nany time that your team is playing right\nso i'm in in like a separate room with\num you know eg's coach and and we're\nwatching the game\nand like when you're watching them play\nthe other thing that i was kind of\nsurprised about is like ti wasn't fun i\nwas expecting to have fun like i went\nand and watched ti live in in at ti-8 so\nthis was like three years ago and it was\nlike a blast it was like one of the most\nenjoyable experiences of my life but\nbeing a part of the tournament is just\nso incredibly nerve-wracking it's like\nit's it's terrible like it the pressure\nis so bad so what i would describe it\nthe closest feeling that i've ever had\nis i remember a couple of weeks ago one\nof my kids was um playing on a\ntrampoline and they fell off the\ntrampoline and so as a parent like i'm\n15 feet away and i see her like falling\nand i see her like you know because the\ntrampoline's elevated right so she falls\noff\nand then there's this moment where like\nas a parent you're not sure if they're\nokay or not you see the fall happen time\nkind of slows down you run over to the\nkid\nand then like you know when they get up\nand they're they're like you know\nthey're not hurt and nothing's bleeding\nand or whatever like you feel this\nimmense amount of relief it's like this\nvery intense tension where you don't\nknow like oh my god did my kid really\njust hurt themselves or are they okay\nthen you run over and then you see them\nlike and they're fine and then you get\nlike this relief that washes through you\nthat whole experience lasts like two\nseconds like literally it lasts like two\nseconds right they fall you can cross 15\nfeet like pretty damn quick and you can\nsee like they they get up and they're\nnot crying or whatever right it's like\ntwo to three seconds\nbeing a ti is like that two to three\nseconds for like hours at a time because\nwhen you're actually watching a game\nlike you never know right like someone\ncould throw someone could like\nthese people like because you can see\nthe whole map and like you know that\nyour players can't and so you know what\nthe other team is doing you know they're\nlike smoke ganking or you know that like\nlike someone's farming under a ward or\nyou you realize like oh my god like the\nenemy's sneaking roche is the team gonna\nrealize it are they gonna are they gonna\nfigure it out are they not gonna figure\nit out like you know someone screwed up\nand they they spent one of their\ncooldowns like how are they gonna take\nthe fight like now is the time that they\nneed to take the fight because the stuff\nis on cooldown for the enemy team like\nit's just this constant feeling of like\nyou don't know what's gonna happen\nit's like watching like it's you just\ndon't know\nand when you win like you're not happy\nlike that was the other thing that was\nreally really surprising like sometimes\npeople are happy when they win\nbut\nmost of the time it's not like happy\nit's just relief it's like there's no\nthere's no positive emotion it's just\ntons and tons of pressure and negative\nemotion followed by like oh thank god we\ndidn't screw it up\nright and and so it's like it's just\nmind-numbingly stressful\nso i i think that was like really\neducational for me in terms of you know\njust not wrecking like the pressure is\njust overwhelming\nso the other thing that i want to say is\nlike the players are absolutely amazing\nso these are some of the most resilient\nindividuals i have ever met and i i\nthink especially about some of these\nfolks like um because they do this right\ngame after game tournament after\ntournament like year after year they\nsign themselves up for you know you\npractice for like\nhours weeks months right you're playing\npubs you're scrimming you're you're you\nknow even like doing stuff with dr k\nlike you're doing everything you can\nyou're talking about the game you're\nthinking about the game\nand then in a moment like it could all\nlike it could be for nothing because you\njust lose right and like then the game\nis over\nand so what these people do is they like\nsign up for this experience like game\nafter game\ntournament after tournament like year\nafter year i i think uh isis ice has\nbeen to nine tis and like just the\namount of resilience\nyou have to have to go to wake up every\nday and like do this over and over and\nover again\nwhen success is\nnot only not guaranteed it is\nstatistically unlikely\nright because at the end of the day\n90 players go to ti and five of them win\nand 85 of them lose\nit's the way that the game is designed\nto be ti is designed not to make winners\nbut to make losers\nand this is something that i think\npeople like especially fans like when\nyou you know you criticize and stuff\nwhich we'll get to that in a second\ni don't think people really appreciate\nthat this is a game that year after year\nthese players are signing up for and\nlike\nloss is almost certain\nright it's crazy you have you have like\na 90 chance of losing like that's just\nwhat it is\nand and it it's it's the amount of\nstrength and internal fortitude that it\ntakes to\nshow up and play this game like over and\nover and over again is like it's it's\namazing like these are some of the most\nresilient people i've ever played with\nor i've not played with but like work\nwith\num\nso like what i mean by resilience is if\nyou kind of think about it like you know\nevery time you go to a tournament like\nyou just don't know what's gonna happen\nand the amount of like faith that you\nhave to develop in yourself the amount\nof uncertainty that you have to deal\nwith\nyou know it's just it's so crushing\nand like you just have to develop such a\ncore of internal strength\nto like tolerate that you know it's kind\nof hard but\nin real life like chances are you're\ngonna end up okay if you keep trying\nright if you think about like\nrelationships for example so sure like\nany individual relationship may have a\nsmall amount of chance of like like\nworking out but at the end of the day\nlike most human beings end up in\nsomewhat of healthy happy relationships\nmost human beings end up with some\namount of like you know success within\ntheir career in their job most human\nbeings end up like you know if you play\na video game like if you purchase a\nvideo game you're gonna like have some\nfun playing it right like most of normal\nlife\nis like\nis like leans towards success i know we\nkind of talk a lot about how people\nstruggle with failure and things like\nthat but at the end of the day like most\nhuman beings are like doing okay\nwhen you get up and you go to work\nthere's not like a 90 chance that you're\ngonna be fired at the end of the day\nright when you go out on a date or let's\nsay you're dating someone like 90 of\nmarriages don't end up in divorce right\nso i think it's just really it's\nit was very eye-opening to see how\nincredibly resilient these people are\nand how much the deck is actually\nstacked against them because it\nabsolutely is\nso\nthe next thing that i kind of want to\ntalk about is that so i'm going to talk\nfor a second about eg's performance over\nthe year\nand i think there's like a lot of\nlessons to be learned i learned a lot so\nit was a very educational experience to\nme and i think it was interesting to see\nyou know what principles do i personally\ntry to live by do i advocate that sort\nof apply to ti what amount of you know\npsychology or like principles of like\nhow to live your life like apply to ti\nand so i think um the next thing that i\nwant to talk about is just the season as\na whole so i worked with eg over the\ncourse of the year which you know a lot\nof people don't know\nand i think overall like i'm i'm really\nproud of the team so i think that\nthe team is super\nis understandably like disappointed in\ntheir ti performance and i think people\nare disappointed in eg and things like\nthat and i also felt some degree of\ndisappointment\nbut i think this is like really\nimportant in life is that like you know\nif you really look at their season like\nthey had a good season right so they\nthey made it to uh you know they\nmade it to the grand finals of two\nmajors\nyou can also say oh they didn't win a\nsingle major but i think they were\nnumber one in the dpc league which means\nthat if you look at their performance\nacross the year it was like very very\nstrong\nand this is kind of the problem with ti\nis that ti is an esport where the only\nthing that matters is or dota is an\nesport where the only thing that matters\nis ti so i'm going to give you guys just\nhow an analogy to illustrate like how\nbizarre of a situation this actually is\nso let's say i'm a surgeon and i'm\noperating on like the president of the\nunited states or like the prime minister\nof you know my country or whatever\nand if like if that patient dies on the\nsurgery table like is that bad\nabsolutely\nbut it doesn't invalidate the thousand\nlives that i saved before that one\nexperience right\nit's certainly bad and it's certainly\nimportant you can even argue that like\nthat person who's on the table in that\nmoment is more important than people who\nhave come before it\nbut esports and especially dota is the\none place where it doesn't matter how\ngood of a job you do prior to ti\nit just doesn't matter\nit's it's an\neggs in one like all of your eggs in one\nbasket like\nin it to an absurd level so i think one\nof the key things that i kind of took\naway from this experience and what i\ntried to you know help the players\nunderstand which they may not they may\nnot understand and it may not be an\nissue of understanding right because\nthis is their life\num but i think it's important to be like\nokay at being disappointed in yourself\nand also like to be able to feel pride\nat the same time\nso you know the way that i feel about my\nti experience is overwhelmingly i'm\nproud of eg i'm proud of what they've\naccomplished and i understand that\nthey're disappointed i felt some\ndisappointment too\nbut it's like it's really important in\nlife to recognize that even when you\ndon't do something that you really\nwanted to do or the results that you\nwere shooting for are disappointed that\nyou be able to take pride in like other\nstuff as well because the truth is is\nthat eg has a lot to be proud of right i\nmean they they had generally speaking a\nstellar season if you look at it by any\nobjective measure\nany sort of like truly rational measure\nthey did fantastic\nso they made it to ti which you know\nlet's remember that like a lot of good\nteams actually didn't make it to ti this\nyear\num you know they had a disappointing\nperformance at ti sure\nbut at the end of the day like they\nplayed some really really awesome dota\nand so i think it's important that like\nyou know in life like it's okay to be\ndisappointed in what you do it's okay to\nbe like not happy with your performance\nbut be careful and remember that just\nbecause you're not happy or it's okay to\nbe disappointed in like the most recent\nthing doesn't mean that you don't\ndeserve to feel some amount of pride in\nlike what you've done prior to that day\nand and like i said i respect these\nplayers so much because you know a lot\nof people\nsay that eg sort of has disappointing\nperformances\nthat they kind of i think if you look at\nit statistically maybe lgd or eg\nis the most\nis the winningest team in in maybe the\nhistory of dota so if you look at like\nthe average placement that eg has had\nover the last like three or four years i\nthink they could be number one or number\ntwo so they have very very consistent\nresults they play really really solid\ndota year after year tournament after\ntournament\nand game after game\nand at the end of the day\nthat's not enough right because the dota\nis an esport where the only thing that\nmatters is one tournament so it's kind\nof interesting because people will also\ncomplain about the prize pool and\nthey'll say like you know the prize pool\nfor the majors is like tiny it's like\nfive hundred thousand dollars and the\nlike the the prize pool for ti is 45\nmillion dollars and you can you can\ncomplain about that if you want to but\nlet's remember that\nyou know it's it's kind of interesting\nbecause it's like it's just an esport\nthat is designed to create tons and tons\nof losers and like one huge winner\nso in when you're faced with those kinds\nof circumstances it can be really really\nhard to have faith in yourself it can be\nreally really hard to persevere\nyou know giving up is very easy to do\nwhen there's basically one tournament\nthat matters\nit also makes it really really hard to\npractice throughout the year right\nbecause at the end of the day like who\nthe hell cares if you made it to the\ngrand finals of like two\nmajors in a row and like if you guys\nlook at ig's performance for example so\nthey won the first major and then i\nthink they got like knocked out pretty\nearly in the second major and then lgd\nwon the second major and they made it to\nthe grand finals\nof the ti\nand then like you know the amount of\nflames and hate that lgd is getting is\nlike astronomical\nand so that's just the nature of the\nbeast and so what i respect so much\nabout the players is to like step into\nthis arena which is like not designed\nfor victory it's an arena that's\ndesigned for failure\nand so that's tough\num and it can be very very hard to be\nproud and feel some degree of like pride\nin your accomplishments because you\ngenuinely do have a lot to be\nproud of i think eg has a lot to be\nproud of i'm very proud of it\nbut it's hard\nand\ni think you know for those of you at\nhome like i encourage you to think a\nlittle bit about that as well like it's\nokay to be disappointed in yourself\nbut there are things that you can\nprobably still be proud of and it's very\nhard to feel that pride right it's not\neasy it's like because you're so\noverwhelmed by the disappointment of the\nmoment that it becomes hard to be\nobjective\nso that's kind of\nyou know because i i think the other\nthing that i'd kind of say is that like\nin this way dota is like real life\nbecause if you look at it like you know\nthere are a handful of billionaires\nright those are like the ti winners\nand for every billionaire out there\nthere's like you know millions or tens\nof millions of people who\n[Music]\nyou know\ndon't have a whole lot of money\nand so in life you can also say that\nlike for every one winner there's like\n10 000 losers\ni think for every you know one winner\nfor every\none team that wins ti like 18 teams lose\nti and not to mention the 60 somewhat\nteams that are like tier two and like\ncompeting in tournaments and like didn't\nmake it to ti and all that kind of stuff\nright so there are tons of teams out\nthere that are sort of destined to lose\nbecause that's just the nature of the\nbeast\nso\nyou know it's it's tough but that's what\nit is and i think what what the real\ntestament to strength is and what i\nreally respect eg for is like picking\nthemselves off the mat and like trying\nagain and trying again and trying again\nuh that doesn't even mention you know\nnot even to think a little bit about the\ntoxicity that a lot of the players face\nright so i know that especially like you\nknow reddit and stuff like that we're\ngoing to talk about this in a second\neveryone likes to analyze like what\nhappens at ti so let's talk about that\nso\noh man there's so much to say okay\nso i want you guys to think about this\nfor a second okay\nwhat determines whether\na team wins or loses a particular game\nof dota\nright like what goes into it like what\ndo you think actually like goes into it\nand the really shocking thing is that if\nyou look at these actual games and like\ni'll ask y'all i'm gonna assume that you\nguys know about you know what happened\nat ti and stuff\nbut if you guys think like if lgd and\nlet's say that lgdm team spirit there's\nlike a thousand alternate universes\nwhat percentage of the time do you think\nin those thousand alternate universes\nwhat what number like what's the\npercentage that you guys think team\nspirit would have won and what's the\npercentage that you think lgd would have\nwon\nright so people are saying like 75 lgd\n90 lgd 50 50 20 lgd so here's the the\nfirst thing to understand about like\ndota 2 tournaments dota 2 tournaments\nare not designed to have the best team\nwin\nand you can definitely argue i mean\nthere's a lot of good arguments against\nthat right like you could say well\nclearly like the team that has the\nmindset and whatever they're the ones\nthat that win the best and i'm not\nsaying that the teams that\none don't deserve to win what i'm saying\nis that the the tournament is designed\nfor entertainment not to actually like\nscientifically assess which team is the\nmost superior\ndo you guys get that like that's why\nthey have best of ones\nso i'm not saying eg is the best team by\nthe way and it's not copio i'm just\nsaying it like you know in science when\nwe're trying to find a particular answer\nwhat we'll do is like we'll do a\nrandomized controlled trial with like 10\n000 subjects so that we can really\nfigure out what is responsible and what\nisn't\nso dota is a is a game that's designed\nor at least tournaments are designed to\nbe spectator sports and if you think\nabout all of the alternate universes\nthat it exists\nwhat percentage of the time would you\nguys say that team spirit would win and\nwhat percentage of the time would you\nsay that lgd would win\nand we're seeing a variety of answers my\npoint is you know my point first and\nforemost is that it's complicated\nso one thing i came to understand about\ndota 2 is it is way way way more\ncomplicated than i ever understood\nand so like i think the biggest thing\nabout dota is that it\nit seems very easy to understand when\nyou're watching a game like\nwhy you lose a game and if you guys want\nto understand this like you know have a\n2k mmr player like myself analyze a\nreplay and then like you know we can say\noh like you know this we lost because\nthis person fed we lost because mid\ndidn't rotate we lost because of this\nand then if you take like a 6k mmr\nplayer and then you have them analyze\nthe replay the answers that they're\ngoing to come up with are going to be\ndifferent from the 2k mmr players and\nthen if you have a 10k mmr player like\nwhen they\nanalyze a 6k mmr player like they're\ngonna come up with different answers and\nthen you have 12 kmr players who are\ngoing to come up with even more\ndifferent answers and so i think if you\nlook at like you know what goes into\nwinning or losing a game of dota this is\nthe super fascinating thing about it\ndota is one of these things where\nhindsight is anything but 2020.\nso we have this saying right we toss\naround the same lot which i'm gonna\ndispute in a second that hindsight is 20\n20.\ni don't think hindsight is 20 20 in dota\nso if you look at like if you really\ntalked to and this is one of the\nprivileges i had right so i i had the\noption to talk to some of the best\ndota players in the world\nand like ask them why did you win this\ngame or why did you lose this game\nand the truth is that like it's very\nhard to tell\nright it's like it's it's so hard to\ntell and and i know for example like i\nyou know being able to watch ti with top\ntier players was also like very very\neducational because there are a bunch of\npeople who have you know been knocked\nout who are still really good at the\ngame and so being able to like you know\nwatch games with them and talk to them\nabout who do you think is gonna win and\nalso like you'll get two two players\nthat are like both very very good and i\ncan ask them the same question based on\nthe draft and like you know the skills\nof the team and things like that and\nlike who do you think is gonna win is\nlike it's still like up in the air\nso there are so many factors that go\ninto you know a game of dota that it's\nreally really hard to tell because\nneither team is going to play perfectly\nright so like they're not open ai\nso you know why did you win there are\nsome games that you should win which you\nend up losing in some games that you\nshould lose that you end up winning\nand so there's so many things that go\ninto it the draft the timings you know\nrotations\nthe the macro strategy\npart of what i really love about dota is\nthat there isn't a right answer when it\ncomes to dota it's it's truly like a\nclash of ideas and philosophies so it's\nreally interesting to see you know how\ndifferent teams will play like their\nmacro strategy and what they believe in\nthey're going to be like meta heroes and\nnon-meta heroes and things like that but\nlike it was really interesting i mean i\nreally loved it because one of the\nthings that i came to understand which i\ndon't see anyone really talking about\nlike when i read dota 2\nthreads about you know why people are\nwinning or losing is like the high level\nstrategic thinking that goes into\nthe draft so i think like 99 of posts\nthat i've i've looked at like don't have\na clue how people actually draft and\nwhat they draft around um and and so you\nknow a lot of people can kind of say\nlike just ban magnus against ts so let\nme just give you guys an example so i'm\nin that camp by the way for the record\nbut\nlet me give you guys so let me ask you a\nquestion okay\nso\nwhat do you think gives you a greater\nchance of beating ts\nis it banning magnus\nor having a a strategy that successfully\ncounters magnus\nwhat do y'all think\nsee this is the really interesting thing\nright because if a team\nhas a bedrock like a foundation\nand you have figured out a way to\ncounter that foundation letting them\npick it\nand then countering it could give you a\nbetter option at actually winning the\ngame\nright so so and this is where like if\nyou look at everyone kind of saying this\nis exactly my point so some people are\nsaying ban it some people are saying\ncounter it some people are saying you\ncan't counter it\nand so this is like this question\nis impossible to answer\nso you can have lots of opinions about\nit and so like like this is just the one\nexample of you know you'll see like\ndifferent philosophies so i think like\nsecret is a good team that\nhas faith in itself to be able to\ncounter strategies and if you kind of\nthink about it like what they'll do is\nthey'll say like uh\nyeah so lg did did counter at game three\nand four exactly right so so this is\nwhat happens like if you're lgd like in\ngame three you know what you decide to\ndo is you're like okay go ahead and pick\nmagnus and then like you know what\nthey're gonna do you know what their\nplay is gonna be and if you're\nsuccessful in countering it you're\nactually at it\nat an advantage compared to if you just\nban it and don't let them play it right\nyou kind of draw them into their\nstrategy that they're comfortable with\nand then you smash them because you have\nthe appropriate counter that's just one\nexample\nokay of like you know one hero\nwhere it's like arguably speaking like a\npretty simple sort of thing like because\ncollapse is really good at magnus\nbut the thing is when you're really\nlooking at dota that's just one example\nthere's\nhundreds there's like over 100 heroes\nthere are tons of different players do\nyou play your dota or do you try to\ncounter their dota and in that sense\nthat too from a drafting perspective\nit's like how do you want to draft do\nyou want a draft for your game or do you\nwant a draft to counter pick their game\ndo you go first pick or do you go second\npick you know so many of these different\nfactors come in and then once again\nlike it's not just about the draft right\nbecause like you'll see\num\nyou know once you actually get into the\ngame\nand then like let's say you drafted what\nyou thought was a good theoretical\ncounter and it doesn't end up succeeding\nso then the question is like did you not\nexecute it properly because you know the\nplayer who's let's say playing rubik was\nrusty and hadn't played rubik in a while\nlike was your strategy the problem was\nwas were you is or is your\nexecution the problem and that's another\nexample of like an impossible question\nto answer\nso dota is one of these things where the\nmore i learned about the game i realized\nthat there's like a massive amount of\nlike dunning krueger going on where\neveryone can look at the last five\nminutes of the game and say like oh they\nshould have you know like the carrie\njust got too farmed it's gg but how did\nthe carry get farmed when did the carry\nget farmed why weren't they ganked were\nthey ganked or was it that like you know\nthe the team did a good job of\nprotecting them or like what are all of\nthe reasons that go into it\nyou know and so hindsight is anything\nbut 2020. and i would sit there for you\nknow hours and hours and hours and talk\nto\ndota players about specifically eg right\nlike you know when you guys lose a game\nor win a game like what are the reasons\nfor your win and what are the reasons\nfor your loss\nand at the end of the day people can\ncome up with opinions and you have to\nhave faith in those opinions\nbut i think that like it's staggering\nbecause there's no gold standard in dota\nand that's what's really bizarre is that\nin in the rest of the world like we tend\nto have objective answers right when you\ntake a test there's an answer key so you\ncan know objectively whether you're\nright or wrong\nlike even in medicine if i suspect\nsomeone has covid i can do a test and\ndetermine objectively whether i'm right\nor wrong\nin dota there's just so much uncertainty\nyou never know what the right answer is\nyou just all you have is your judgment\nbut there's no such thing as an answer\nkey there's no such thing as a biopsy\nsure you can watch the replay and you\ncan come up with conclusions but at the\nend of the day hindsight is anything but\n2020.\nand this is also where i think like for\nthose of you all at home i think it's\nreally important to understand this\nprinciple because i think most human\nbeings will go around believing that\nhindsight is 20 20 when in truth it's\nanything but\nso i'll give you guys just one example\nso i was working with someone who was\ninterested in getting married\nand so they were dating this one person\nfor a while and that you know the\nrelationship fell apart dating a second\nperson for a while and the relationship\nfell apart third person fourth person so\nthey had four sort of serious\nrelationships over the course of let's\nsay three or four years\nand every everyone every time something\nfalls apart and i would ask the person\nokay why did your relationship fall\napart and they said okay well you know\nthe person just prioritized their career\nlike they weren't willing to you know\ntheir career was more important than the\nrelationship so we decided to break up\nokay totally fine\num what happened with the second person\nwell the second person had daddy issues\nso you know they just like\nyou know had daddy issues and it was\nlike a problem and and so like you know\nthey had to work on themselves before\nthey were ready for a relationship\ncompletely reasonable\nthird relationship why did the\nrelationship fall apart well this person\nhad a problem like they were they they\nwere an alcoholic and like the drinking\nwas just super out of control\nand so like you know\nthat's the reason the relationship fell\napart and what's the fourth reason the\nrelationship fell apart well i don't\nknow like we just kind of drifted apart\num you know they got kind of busy with\nwork i kind of got busy with work and\nthings just kind of drifted apart\nand so you can look at a situation and\nyou can like really say that you know\nyou can answer with confidence but at\nsome point like you don't actually know\nif any of those things are correct\nand so at some point you know what i\nwhat i do with that person is to you\nknow ask them like well okay like what\ndo you think your contribution is right\nbecause there's a common denominator\nhere there's like a common denominator\nof like well maybe like you're actually\nthe problem and it's not any one of\nthose things\nand so this absolutely applies in dota\nand in real life where like a lot of\ntimes you know people will believe they\nunderstand why things happen why you\ncan't get a job why you're you know\nyou're lazy why you self-sabotage why\nyou're forever alone why you get passed\nover for promotions\num\nwhy you wind up with like you know\nfriends who don't respect your\nboundaries there are all kinds of things\nand you can say like oh this person\ndoesn't respect my boundaries my in-laws\nare a pain in the ass you can attribute\nreasons to all kinds of things in life\nbecause that's what our brain is\ndesigned to do our brain is designed to\nformulate patterns from uncertainty like\nthat's like the biggest goal of the\nbrain\nright it's it's how we're able to tell\nthat clouds lead to rain because our\nbrain is really good at associating\ncoral taking correlation and attributing\ncausation from correlations\nso for example in this how people will\neven come up with little rituals right\nlike i have my lucky underwear well like\nwhat's up with that it's just i don't\nknow like\nmy lucky underwear like i the reason i\nfailed the test is because i didn't have\nthe lucky underwear right so there's all\nkinds of things that's what our brain\ndoes is it tries to take\nit tries to make sense of chaos\nthe problem is that oftentimes it\ndoesn't do it correctly oftentimes it\ndoes do it correctly right because we\nare pretty good we as human beings\nfigure things out we've sent people into\nspace\nyou know we figured out how to\ndevelop a vaccine against covid\num i figured out how to adjust camera\nand things like that and and you know i\nfigured things out\nrelating to stream\nand and so it's really tricky but like\nin dota hindsight is not 2020 and for\nthose of you like who really think\nyou've figured everything out in your\nlife\ni'd strongly encourage you to question\nyour hindsight as well because chances\nare your hindsight really isn't 20 20.\nif you really think about it objectively\nthere's no\nright answer to why you you and someone\nelse managed to break up right there's\nno like there's no like actual objective\nanswer there's just opinion but that's\nnot what our brain tries to tell us\nbecause the truth is that you know in a\ngame of dota there are so many factors\nthat go into it and you never really\nknow\nwhich is the other reason that i respect\nthese guys a lot because like\nin the face of never really knowing you\nhave to develop confidence and like\ntransmit that confidence to your team\nand try to play this game that you will\nnever know if you are adequately\nprepared for\nright so you you prep the draft and you\nkind of think about what you're going to\nplay and you practice and you scrim and\nall this kind of stuff and at the end of\nthe day you never know whether you're\nactually going to like succeed or not\nand this is really different from most\nother dimensions of life because like\nyou know for example for a test like if\nyou study enough\nright and assuming that you have some\nyou know basic level of iq and you can\nhandle the course work and things like\nthat\nyou can basically work your way to\ngetting an a like the a is there if you\nwork hard enough right maybe you've got\nadhd and that needs to be treated and\nthings like that but generally speaking\nyou can work your way to an a generally\nspeaking in life like you can work your\nway to a particular goal like if you try\nhard enough i think most people will end\nup in a relationship if that's what they\nwant right like you can try really hard\nand you can work on a bunch of things\nand you can get there in dota like i\ndon't know that you can ever get there\nbecause at the end of the day like\nthere's someone on the other side of the\ntable who could be working just as hard\nas you are\nand so even though you put in all this\nwork like it could be luck it could be\nrng it could be that they had a better\nidea than you did it could be that\ntheir ideas happen to align with the\ncurrent meta\nso even though your ideas are superior\nthat like the meta favors their ideas\nover your ideas\num\nyou can certainly also argue that you\nknow the good teams are the ones that\nadapt their ideas to the meta and things\nlike that so like the point is that you\ncan make a point and counterpoint for\nany given thing and like you can\nand you'll never know what the right\nanswer is\nso it's just incredibly complex\nand the the really shocking thing is\nthat you don't ever have like a a real\nanswer to\nbase things on\nright so like even in in the rest of\nlife like we'll have like if you're at\nyour job you have a performance review\nwhere people will sit down and will tell\nyou hey we think you need to like work\non a b and c and they may not be a\nhundred percent correct but like there's\nnothing like that in dota right it's not\nlike\nyou know lgd a team spirit is gonna sit\ndown with lgd after the tournament\nthey're gonna be like hey here's the\nreason we think you lost we think you\nneed to work on like a b and c\nlike professional teams are not gonna\ngive each other like feedback\nto help them improve so it's like how\nthe hell do you improve how the hell do\nyou know what works and what doesn't\nwork it's just it's just a mind-numbing\namount of like uncertainty and poor\nquality information it blows my mind\nand so then also like if we talk about\nyou know now there's the ti shuffle\nseason right so everyone's like rumoring\nabout what's gonna happen what's not\ngonna happen by the way i know a lot\nabout what's gonna happen but i can't\nsay\num\nso you know do you kick a particular\nplayer that's another great example of\nlike uh\nyou never know\nright\nyou never know like so like let's say\nyou have a poor performance at ti do you\nreplace someone or do you not replace\nsomeone\nis that person the reason that you lost\nokay\nuh is that person the reason that you\nlost you you never know right like so\nyou can kick someone you can replace i\nhave theories about why people get\nkicked and why teams are successful\nthere's so much i've learned chat\num\nbut it's it's like challenging right so\nlike just think about that question like\nhow do you know that kicking someone is\ngoing to lead to success you don't\nhow do you know that that person was\nreally the problem you actually don't\nlike you can assess and you can make a\njudgment right but you never really know\ni actually don't know what eg is gonna\ndo i know about other teams\num\nyeah\nso\nyeah so let me just share with you guys\nlike something that i did sort of notice\nso here's an example of like what's hard\nabout dota\nso i'm going to talk for a second about\ndoubt and confidence and regression\nso if we kind of think about\num so i kind of have a hypothesis as to\nwhy\nteams\nconsistently\nunderperform\nokay so like what tends to happen is\nlike you know at some point in the\ntournament you're gonna start to doubt\nyour strategies unless you just dominate\neveryone which is generally speaking not\ngonna happen\nand even if you if you do you know win\ngames like sometimes there are games\nthat you win where you're filled with\ndoubt and other games that you win that\nyou're you know other games that you\nlose where you're actually not doubting\nat all so that's the other really\ninteresting thing is that like you know\nyou can win a game and you can be like\nwe really had no idea what we were doing\nand they just threw so does that mean\nthat your strategy is good or like\nor what you know\num\nbut i think that one of the things\nthat's important to remember is that\nwhen people doubt\nuh so i'll just share with you guys like\none example of something that i kind of\nnotice from like understanding\npsychology in the human mind\nso generally speaking what will happen\nis people will um\nyou know people will develop a game plan\nas a team right and so we're going to\nsay like okay this is what our game plan\nis we're going to do this we're going to\ndo this we're going to do this\nand then as the game starts to fall\napart or as people begin to doubt and\nyou because you have to sometimes you\nhave to adapt too right so if your game\nplan isn't working\nthat's also tricky like there's times\nwhere doubting your game plan is like\nreally important because\ndoubt and adaptation kind of go hand in\nhand so the person who never doubts will\nnever adapt because if i'm i'm sure i'm\nright then like there's no reason to\nchange what i'm doing and so then you're\ndooming yourself to a life without\nadaptation\nso that that's kind of interesting\nbecause people sort of think a little\nbit about like you know confidence is\nlike really good but it's been my\nexperience that actually doubting is\nactually super healthy as well\nand then what happens when we sort of\nget into a period of doubt is i notice\nthat a lot of teams will actually\nregress and what i mean by regress is\nthat you have to remember that these\nplayers have played dota for like ten\nthousand twenty thousand thirty thousand\nforty thousand hours and they've\ndeveloped their own particular style and\nas a team you can put together you know\na game plan but as the game plan starts\nto fall apart\nand you can't stick to that game plan\nwhat tends to happen is that players\nwill sort of regress back to what they\nknow so they'll sort of go to like\ndefaulting to like their particular play\nstyle and they won't necessarily play as\na team anymore\nand so this is also something that we\nkind of see in relationships for example\nso generally speaking when relationships\nare under a period of stress what will\nhappen is like the people in the\nrelationship will regress to their own\nstyle of like how they manage conflict\nright so we may be able to communicate\nhealthily while everything is going well\nbut when there's stress under the\nrelationship i'm gonna regress and what\ni'm gonna do is like i'm gonna shut down\nwhereas my partner may turn to\nyou know talking to their mom\nall the time about like complaining\nabout the relationship so whereas i may\nsort of withdraw into myself like my\napartment partner may do something else\nand so then we sort of start to get on\ndifferent pages\nonce the initial game plan or once like\nthings start to fall apart and there's a\nperiod of stress\nand so i think one of the things that i\nsee a lot in teams is that you know\nsometimes they'll play coordinated but i\nthink what what sort of happens is as\nthings don't go their way\nthe way if you have to adapt on the fly\nthe way in which you adapt is based on\nyour own experience and what you've\ntrained and so what can happen in an\nindividual game of dota is you can have\nfive people adapting in their own way\nand so when they start to adapt in their\nown way because they're not all thinking\nexactly the same because once again\nthey're not open ai\nthey start to become uncoordinated so\nworking on these kinds of things is a\nlot of like what i was kind of doing um\nright so helping people like coordinate\ncommunicate helping people recognize\nsome of these kinds of things i think\nit's just an interesting like example of\num\nyou know how complex esports actually is\nanyway\ni'm kind of all over the place today\njust sharing thoughts\ni don't know do people not have forty\nthousand hours in dota\ndo pros not have that\nwell so some people are saying dr k\nequals best coach so that that's\nso there's\ntwo ways to look at that right one way\nto look at that is that eg had a good\nseason the other way to look at that is\neg placed 9th to 12th at ti\nso what do y'all think\nis it dr k or dr kw\ncould be either one right it depends on\nyour standard of judgment\nwhat is this uh what is this man\nthe keck w that's the that's the spanish\ndude right\nthat's this guy right\nyeah that guy's great\nokay\nso next thing that i want to do is i'm\ngoing to share with you all just a\ncouple of takeaways\nso here's what i'd say is like some of\nthe most important stuff that i learned\nfrom\nuh\nbeing at ti\nso the first kind of takeaway is that\nreally like the only choice you truly\nhave in life is to move forward or not\nmove forward so as i just kind of said\nyou know you never really know\nwhy you may have won or why you may have\nlost right you get disappointed\nyou don't really know like maybe the job\nmarket is bad maybe you know she's just\nnot that into you maybe he's still\ngetting out of a relationship\nyou never really know why things don't\ngo in your favor\nyou can hypothesize and by all means you\nshould hypothesize it's healthy to\nhypothesize so that you can adapt\nyou know work on yourself etc\nbut at the end of the day you never\nreally know what you did wrong or what\nyou did right there's no perfect source\nof information so if you guys have\nsetbacks in life i think the first thing\nto understand is it's not about\nnecessarily figuring out the right\nanswer it's about deciding to\ndeciding am i going to try again or not\ntry again\nand it's it's certainly my you know it's\nbeen my experience and i thought about\nthis a lot too where people were sort of\nasking me like you know i remember\nruthie was sort of asking me do you\nthink it was like worth your time to go\nand i think it was absolutely worth my\ntime i mean would have been night would\nit have been nice if eg won ti like\nabsolutely would that have made me happy\nbut i don't think that the experience\nwas a failure\njust because eg didn't win ti\ni think there's a lot to learn from you\nknow i mean i learned so much like like\nit's just i'm i haven't been\nthis clueless about something and\nlearned so much in many many years so it\nwas one of the most educational\nexperiences of my life\nand i think the first and only real\nquestion is like do you move forward\nlike jeremy\num the second thing to understand is\nthat in life despite all of your best\nefforts\nwinning is not guaranteed\nand i know it's it's kind of interesting\nbut like we don't really view it that\nway right like i think at the end of the\nday you can try your best you can try to\nget in shape you can clean up your\nwardrobe you can get a nice haircut you\ncan have a makeover and you can ask out\nyour crush and they may still\nsay no\nso you can and you don't have to be\nparticipating in ti to understand this\nright any game of dota you can show up\nin any game of dota a pub game\num you know a ti tournament game\nand like\nyou can be you can give it everything\nyou've got it doesn't matter like you\ncan give it everything you've got and\nyou may not win so the one one of the\nhardest things about life is that\nno matter how much effort you put in\nyou are never guaranteed to be\nsuccessful\n[Music]\nso the next thing is that\nspeaking about you know how to be\nsuccessful\nis i want you all to understand that\nlike even though you can never guarantee\nsuccess there are very very concrete\nthings you can do to improve your\nchances of success and this is sort of\nthe attitude that i advocate in life is\nthat you may not be able to get someone\nto fall in love with you but you can\nabsolutely do a lot of things to\nincrease your chances\nand so i think a lot of times what\nhappens is we get emotionally caught up\nin a particular result right so like for\nexample\nnot winning ti\nand that result can be so devastating\nthat it actually like shatters us and we\nfeel like not moving forward we feel\nlike practicing is a waste of time we\nfeel like you know we never really know\nlike i'm saying hindsight isn't 20 20.\nso what's the point in trying despair\ncan set in all kinds of like bad stuff\ncan happen\nbut at the end of the day i think the\nsuccess the formula for success is about\nworking on what you can work it work on\nand increasing the probability of\nsuccess as much as you can\neven though you may not ever be able to\nhit 100 chance of success there are very\nconcrete things that you can do to\nimprove\nright so if we look at something like\ndota let's forget about professional\nplayers but like myself like i'm a 2k\nplayer there are things that i can\nimprove\nand so i can look at a particular game\nof dota and i can say there's no way i\ncould have won that game and that could\nhave been absolutely true\nbut you have to be able to hold the\ndialectic which means hold kind of\ncontrary things at the same time which\nis that\nit was impossible for me to win this\ngame\nand at the same time there are a lot of\nthings i could do to get better\nand so if you guys are feeling stuck in\nlife and you don't really like you know\neven though you may never be able to get\nto 100 chance of success it doesn't mean\nthat you are powerless in the face of\nyour circumstances there are absolutely\nthings that you can improve right so if\nyou're stuck\nyou know\nlike i'll just share like you know i\napplied to medical school 120 times\nand\neven though i got rejected 120 times\nlike each time i got rejected it was\nthree application cycles so really three\ntimes like i applied for to 40 medical\nschools and you know each time i i\napplied for the application cycle the\nnext year\nlike\ni can work on that application i can\nimprove it and i can try to apply again\nso i think if you want to be successful\nin life\nyou know even though it's kind of\nbizarre but don't shoot for a guaranteed\nsuccess just try to increase your odds\nof success as much as possible\nand this is kind of the last thing that\ni sort of learned is that it's really\nimportant to stay detached\nand i i know that this is a big\nphilosophy that we have at healthy gamer\nright so we we kind of advocate for\ndevoting yourself to your actions and\nbeing detached from the outcomes of your\nactions\nand what i mean by that is that like you\nknow you can the most you can never win\na game of dota\nall you can do is play a game of dota to\nthe best of your ability and if you lose\nthat game of dota all you can do is try\nto learn from that from the best of your\nability so you can watch replays you can\npractice last hitting you can think\nabout item builds you can talk to other\npeople about it you can try to improve\nyour odds of success and then the second\ngame that you go into you're still not\nguaranteed success right there's there's\nnothing you can do to guarantee that you\nwill win a particular game of dota\nand so this is something that's really\nreally hard to do in dota and in life\nbut i think that this is where like you\nknow i'll share this but like i know\nit's kind of weird but\nyou know dota is the same game\nwhether you're playing it in a pub\nwhether i'm playing it or artesi's\nplaying it or you know ame is playing it\nor collapses playing it\nit's the same game the heroes are the\nsame the items are the same the timings\nare the same runes spawn every two\nminutes bounty runes spawn every three\nminutes the game is exactly the same\nwhether you're playing a pub or you're\nplaying in the grand finals of ti\nit's exactly the same\nso what is it that makes your ability to\nplay it so different\nright what is the difference between a\npub and being in the grand finals at ti\nit's all up here\nand so this is the big thing that i\nthink a lot of people miss is that most\nof life\nis just what it is\nbut your ability to succeed at life or\ncrack under the pressure all comes from\nhere\nright because what is the pressure the\ngame is exactly the same\nright like last hitting mechanics are\nexactly the same like the patches you\nknow for the duration of this ti is\nexactly the same the items are the same\neverything's the same\nand in life like what we do on a daily\nbasis is sort of exactly the same\nyou have to wake up you have to decide\nokay am i gonna am i gonna study today\nor not study today or you know\nit's all the same\nwhere the pressure comes from where the\nconfusion comes from where the doubt\ncomes from and where the confidence\ncomes from is all up here and too often\nin life when something doesn't go our\nway what we try to do is find some\nexternal thing to blame\nright like oh like\nyou know the reason i don't get it i\ndidn't get promoted is because of like\npolitics at the workplace\nand you can sort of say something like\nthat you can say okay like so gg i'm\ndone\nbut then like you know there's first of\nall that may not even be true you may be\nattributing a lack of poor performance\nto politics in the workplace maybe you\njust are not as good at your job\nin someone else's\nmaybe you call that politics or the\nother way the other thing to think about\nis if it's politics at the workplace why\ncan't you learn politics at the\nworkplace why can't you learn how to be\na political animal at the workplace\nso the key thing is that you know\nthe game of life tends to be pretty\nconsistent\nthe game of dota tends to be pretty\nconsistent\nthe big difference in terms of whether\nyou succeed or fail has to do with the\nplayer\nright it has to do them with the mindset\nof the player it has to do with the\nperson who you're the player of your\nlife so the question is what's going on\nup here\nbecause this is what you need to work on\nbecause generally speaking like the\nrules of life are like\nlike kind of the same right you can work\non your resume you can apply for a job\nyou can get in shape you can do all\nthose things\nit's just how you play the game\nso it's all it all kind of comes down to\nyou\nso overall it's been fantastic\nyou know it was an amazing opportunity\nto\nbe able to go to ti i'm honestly like\nhonored\nand um\nyou know i said as much to all the\nplayers like you know the day after they\ngot knocked out of the tournament like i\nwas kind of telling them kind of tearing\nup a little bit that it's been amazing\nto like work with them over the last\nyear i'm really grateful for the\nopportunity like i'm proud of them\ni'm proud of what they've accomplished\nlike i understand that it's okay to be\ndisappointed\nbut just personally like it's been an\namazing opportunity and i'm so grateful\nbecause as someone who has been playing\ndota since it was a warcraft 3 mod\nthe ability to go to actual like go to\nti was amazing in and of itself this\nyear\nuh because of covet and all that right\nso i was like super lucky there and to\nactually be able to sit down and like\ntalk to players right so like i've been\nwatching arteezy stream for years\nand to be able to sit down and like have\nlunch with him it's like it's amazing\num i'm so lucky i'm so lucky that i was\nable to be a part of their journey even\nif it is a little bit disappointing you\nknow it doesn't i don't i don't view the\nvalue of my life or my time based on the\nresults of what happens\nso sometimes people would even ask me\nthey'd ask like you know are you like\ndisappointed\nright like are you disappointed in like\nhow the tournament went and stuff like\nthat\nand and no i'm i'm not right because i\nthink or i mean like i'm somewhat i'm\nnot disappointed in in the team\nthe result is disappointing but that's\njust life right like you can't tie\nyourself to your results\nyou have to focus on like the people\ninvolved and the effort that you put in\nand what comes next that's the real test\nand so you know\ni i feel like this is what i'm about to\nsay is a little bit idiotic i was going\nto say that you know the real test comes\nafter you lose ti\nbecause i think that's really what what\nmakes us who we are in life it's not\nabout how we win it's about how we lose\nright so if you if you think about you\nknow people who i respect\nthey're not the ones who had it really\neasy had a 90 chance of success and then\nlike ended up getting the promotion it's\nthe person who failed once and then\npicks themselves up off the mat and\ntries to do better and decides to apply\nagain\nand so i think this is something that\nthat i encourage all you all to take to\nheart to and i learned i saw this lesson\nbeing lived out and hopefully it'll\ncontinue to be lived out\nwhich is you know in life you can't\ncontrol what's gonna happen so the the\nonly thing that you really have within\nyour power to control as a human being\nis what you do with the loss\nand like i said earlier you know ti is a\ntournament where there are five winners\nand 85 losers it's like literally how\nit's designed it's designed for the vast\nmajority of people to be losers\nand unfortunately in life i think this\nis also true that most people are the\nlosers\nthe winners are few and far between\nthere there are very few of us i mean\nand i\nyou know who really have the opportunity\nfor success are lucky enough\nto succeed\num sure is there hard work but like you\nknow if i think about myself it's like\ndid i work hard yeah some people will\nsay like oh you know you deserve your\nsuccess i don't know that any i don't\nknow that i do deserve my success\nbecause it's not like i work any harder\nthan\nlet's say a single mother of two who's\nlike working two and a half jobs\nright i remember having patients like\nthat who work actually way harder than i\ndo\num you know they they try so hard\nthey're like in a single parent\nhousehold do so much for their kids\nwork super hard sacrifice all of their\nlike personal time for the benefit of\ntheir children\nand why do i deserve more than that\nperson i don't\nso i i don't know i mean i think in life\nyou know you don't necessarily get what\nyou deserve and i don't know what\ndetermines what you deserve\nbut i all i know is that\nyou know\nwhat you're worth and what i respect\npeople for is how you\nmanage what you're given whether that's\na win or a loss whether you're gracious\nas a winner\nand you try to support other people if\nyou're one of the lucky ones or as a\nloser whether you pick yourself up off\nthe mat and decide to try again\nso at the end of the day i'd say focus\non your actions and focus on yourselves\nand it's okay to be a loser the truth is\nthat the vast majority of people on the\nplanet are like losers\nright the number of people who are in\npoverty\nfar outweighs the number of people who\nhave ultra high net worth wealth\ninequality is getting worse\nthat's just life\nso that's the that's the the life that\nwe you know that's the hand that we've\nbeen dealt in life and the goal is to\ntry to do what you can with it\nquestions\nwill you be attending the next year bro\ni attended this ti the team that i\nworked with got 9th to 12th\nwill i be attending the next ti let's\nstart by asking the team\nwhether they want me there\nyou guys are making it sound like i've\ngot an invitation\nuh\ni'm kind of trolling so my relationship\nwith eg is fantastic\nas far as i can tell anyway so i i think\nwe got to be really close and it was\nreally awesome i really loved going\nreally loved getting i think\nirrespective of whether i go to ti or\ndon't go to ti or you know whatever\nhappens i i think hopefully we'll be\nfriends\nfor you know a long time\ni i i love the players like just as\npeople they're just such amazing\nindividuals each and every one of them\nyou know they each have their own\nparticular style and and like manner\nbut they're all fantastic\nso someone's asking do you think rtz\nwill ever win a ti and then i see the\nnext question the question right after\nit is how do you focus on the process\nso you focus on the process by not\nasking that question\nright so i have no idea if rtz will ever\nwin a ti statistically most professional\ndota players will never win a ti\nbut here's what i'd say\nyour chances of winning ti are a lot\ngreater the more that you accept that\nit's just a game of dota\nand so one thing that i really loved was\nuh ts's if you guys like listen to their\ncoach i think the attitude that they had\nfor game five was perfect\nsomeone asked them what's your strategy\nand he's like my strategy is luck\nour strategy is luck\nand that's honestly like when i heard\nthat i i was watching the game with some\npeople and i was like i think these guys\nare gonna win\nlike it's it's an acknowledgement that\nthere's only so much you can do\nright there's no strategy that's gonna\nguarantee you success\nit's just you show up and you play the\nbest god damn dota of your life and you\nhope that gaben is on your side\nthat's the ultimate strategy to nti\ni'm not kidding\nlike\nthat's why what i was you know what i\nexplained to people is like\nyou know i know it sounds bizarre but\nthe game of dota is exactly the same\nwhether you're playing a pub or game\nfive of the grand finals it's the same\ndamn game\nit's just getting psyched out in your\nhead because it's game five of ti grand\nfinals that's what that's what screws\nyou over\nso people are asking specifics about eg\ni'm not gonna comment specifically on\nplayers and like what's going on so i\nthink that like all of my other clients\nso the relationship is public obviously\nbut um i think they're all they're all\nentitled to privacy so i'm not gonna\nanswer any specific questions about\nthe players\ni apologize\ni'm happy to share my experience well\nworking with bulb is great dude working\nwith all the players was a lot of fun\num\nyeah i've talked to a lot of other teams\ni've worked with more teams than eg\nin a manner of speaking\num\nuh so just a little bit about romania so\ni know that like\ni mean we probably jumped on this this\nbandwagon a little bit too so like we\nsent out some pictures of like you know\nthe quarantine food and stuff like that\nso here's what i'd say i think valve\ngets a lot of crap\nright they said like valve should do\nthis and valve should do that and i\nthink pgl also like got some crap i\nthink you all have to understand so i i\nmean i think this is once against the\ninternet being judgmental like\norganizing a tournament during kovid is\nnot easy\nthere are so many things that go into\nlike organizing a major esports event\num i mean it's hard like there's like\nvisas and flights and like daily covet\ntests they did a lot of stuff that i\nthink that was actually really cool so\nthey gave us these little bluetooth\ntrackers\nthat sort of track\nwhich people you're around so that if\none person tests positive they know who\nthat person has been exposed to\nuh because they know based on your\nbluetooth data so it does it's not like\na gps tracker that like tracks your\nlocation it just knows like okay which\ntracker has had contact with like which\nother trackers\nand so it's i think that it's like\nyou know like it's very very hard to\norganize a tournament of this magnitude\nin these kinds of circumstances\nso even though there were some things\nthat you know i i certainly think the\ntournament could have done better or\nvalve could have done better i mean\nobviously there's room for improvement\nall the time\ni i think it's important to remember\nthat like\npulling it off is not easy to do like\nsure there are problems but just the\nfact that the tournament even happened\nthat we had a ti this year\nright because like sweden basically was\nlike yeah that's not gonna happen and\nthen valve is like what do you do with\nyour valve\nyou know it's tough\nit's really tough\nhow do you organize something on such\nshort notice like all the con like the\ncountry governments are like concerned\nabout kovid players are coming from all\nover the world\nyou know different countries have\ndifferent levels of like coveted\nrestrictions\nso you know can you hold ti in a country\nand like what if that country decides\nlike oh by the way we're not going to\nallow anyone from you know\nmalaysia\nthen what\nlike how do you manage all that it's so\nhard\num\nstudent florida\nyeah\ni'm just reading questions\nuh so\ni if you guys i thought the seb and no\ntail casts were excellent if you guys\ndidn't see those\nlike i think really listening to their\nview\ni think they shared a lot of information\nso i'm not sure i think sam said he was\nretiring right\nyou see i don't know\nbut yeah the draft panel was brilliant\ni also think um\nuh so did i get some dope ti merch i did\nget some ti merch it was really nice and\ni was also a little bit disappointed\nbecause of all the covered restrictions\nso the people who are gonna bring all\nthe merch like couldn't\nso the other neat thing technically chat\ntechnically\nokay there's one story i can tell you\nguys okay\nso when we first got to ti\nwe got to romania\nit turned out that ig and astor had\nplayers who had gotten kovid\nso\nyou know like\ni was kind of asking people i was\ntalking to fly\nand so i was like you know fly wow so\nlike that's crazy that you know these\npeople you know people got covered and\nstuff what you know uh what happens if\none of y'all gets coveted like do you\nguys play with a stand-in or what and\nhe's like no no no like there aren't\nstand-ins like you the the tournament\nrules are such that\num you can't play like you can't like\npull another player from a different\nteam or something like that so i i kind\nof asked him you know if a team gets\neliminated and you guys like it someone\ngets coveted like mid tournament can you\nlike pull someone from a different team\nand he's like no\nand he's like the the stand-ins have to\nbe from your pod of eight so each team\ngets eight people\nand so he's like\nand so he was like you know if we get if\none person gets kovin then bulba's gonna\nhave to play if another person gets\ncovid then wilson's gonna be second\nstanding\nand then if three people on the team get\nto go big it looks like it's gonna be dr\nk playing\nand i gotta say that is the scariest\nmoment in my life like i've been with a\nlot of scary boats and i was like tal\nyou're joking right and he's like no i'm\nnot joking he's like if we three people\nget sick like you're gonna have to play\nat ti i was like oh my god\nand so i was so terrified\ni was like oh my god that's good that's\nso scary dude\nbut technically\ntechnically i was on a team at ti i was\nthe third stand-in for evil geniuses\n2k\n2k mmr boys\ni just got to say i'm glad i was like\nman i'm glad i streamed dota like a few\nweeks ago because i actually played a\nlittle bit of dota\nprobably lowest lowest mmr to ever\nparticipate at ti\ni mean i imagine there may have been\npeople there from other teams who had\nlower mmr than i did but maybe not\nmaybe the pod was all because like some\npeople had like videographers and stuff\nand it's possible they've never even\nplayed a game\nsomeone's asking me which champion would\ni play are we talking about law\nyeah i hear uh train is like close like\nhe's like homies with a lot of these\npeople\nyeah so a lot of people are asking am i\ngoing to do it again so i was meaning\nearlier but you know the short answer is\ni don't know um so i think one of the\nthings that does concern me a little bit\nis that\nyou know i was there so\nyou know the yearly commitment wasn't\nthat bad in terms of\ntime but i do think it\ni i sometimes think a little bit about\nlike what i'm here for\nyou know like what what is my purpose on\nthe earth\nand as personally gratifying and as hype\nas it is for me to\ncoach a team at ti for like mental stuff\nand performance\ni do wonder a little bit about what the\ncost is to y'all\nuh you know we started healthy gamer\nultimately to help y'all\nand even though it's great for me\num and a lot of fun and very educational\nyou know we miss three weeks of streams\num i wonder you know sometimes we'll get\nposts on on the subreddit\nabout you know people saying like oh\nlike healthy gamers helped me a lot one\nof my favorite ones is dr k has ruined\nmy life\ni don't know if you guys saw this post a\nwhile back but some dude was like dr k\nhas ruined my life i used to wake up\nevery day and like play games all day\nand then like go to bed angry and sad at\nmyself\nand then now i wake up and i exercise\nand i do yoga and i go for a run and i\nlike try to eat healthy and not every\neverything isn't perfect yet but i'm\nit's ruined my old life\nand so i i think a little bit about you\nknow what\nwhat did peop\nwhat could i have done with that time\ninstead so i i did have an amazing\nopportunity to try to help\nsix people in an organization\num\nyou know do the best that they possibly\ncould at an\nevent that's very important for their\nlives\ni don't i'm glad for the opportunity i'm\ngrateful\nbut i do sometimes wonder you know if i\nbecause one of the pieces of feedback\nthat i got is that so i joined at the\nend of the boot camp and some people\nfelt like\nyou know i should have come at the\nbeginning to really be very effective\nand so where you know if the boot camp\nso could i take five weeks off like i\ndon't know\nright\ni don't know\nso that i i just worry a little bit\nabout that kind of stuff and really\nwhat's my so i think what it comes down\nto is dharma\nwhat's my dharma in this case\nis it to help eg\nto try to win ti next year or is it to\nhelp y'all\ncan i do both can you guys get help\nelsewhere\nwhich is part of the reason by the way\nthat we started the coaching program\nbecause like you know\nthat way at least\nhg stuff was ongoing people continued to\nbe so i i wouldn't have done i wouldn't\neven have even done this\nif we didn't have a coaching program\nbecause i i sort of because at the end\nof the day people are so the coaches are\nstill helping people right\nuh but dr k doesn't your mental health\nmatter don't you get to need to live\nyour life we get help the other 49 weeks\nof the year yeah so i do i mean i do\nlive my life right i'm not like\nstreaming and working\n100 hours a week so i do take care of\nmyself the sentiment is really nice i\nappreciate it but the other thing that i\ni frankly have to say is that\nin a sense not really so i do live my\nlife but i think that like i had my 20s\nto dick around and play video games that\nwas in my mind my time to\nyou know for myself\nand um\nthen i had the opportunity to like\ntrain at a couple of amazing\ninstitutions\nand so i don't know i mean i think also\ngetting covert earlier this year\nyou know life is short you never know\nhow long you're going to be around\nso\ni kind of feel like now is my time to to\ngive back to the world because i've\ngotten a lot from it\nso i do sort of feel somewhat of a\ncrunch in terms of trying to do as much\nas i can as quickly as i can because i\nreally don't know i mean who knows what\nwhat's going to happen right there's so\nmuch uncertainty in the world\nand the other thing to think a little\nbit about the other thing that kind of\nbothers me is\nthe understanding that\nyou could say that okay like i have many\nyears to help people\nbut one of the things part of the reason\nwe started healthy gamers so i'll tell\nyou guys just a quick story so\nwhen i was finishing up training i got a\ncouple of very good job offers\nand awesome awesome people awesome\nplaces to work\num and people who are very supportive\nand they said you know like hey like if\nyou want to\nbe like the expert in video game\naddiction like we'll help you we'll help\nyou start a rehab so like create like a\nrehab center for video game addiction\nwhere people can come and like you know\nyou can help people like your way like\nwe think the work that you're doing is\nawesome we want to support you in doing\nit and we'll make it happen\nand but the the path to that was long so\nit was sort of like a 10-year plan of\nlike doing research and really\nunderstanding what was effective and\nwhat isn't effective and then\nyou know scoping out a site and things\nlike that\nand so part of the reason that i turned\nthat down is like what worried me is\nthat in the 10 years that it takes to\nopen the door to the rehab\nwhat happens to like all of the people\nlike sure like once let's say it's\nprobably probably would have been 10\nyears let's say like five years or three\nyears or whatever so like let's say four\nyears from the start of that job offer\nlike we open the doors and we help like\n30 people a month\nwhat happens to all the people who need\nhelp in the four years prior to opening\nthe doors\nand so i think the tricky thing there is\nthat what concerns me about taking kind\nof time off from a healthy gamer's work\nis i i mean i imagine you all understand\nthis but like there are real\nconsequences\nif i take a year off and pick this up\nagain like i see we see this a lot in\nour coaching program\nwhere you know people are like on\nacademic probation like they're the way\nthat\nyou know i remember hearing a case a\ncouple weeks ago where someone was like\num is on a visa from before like it's on\na student visa\nand so if they fail like one more\nsemester like they're like their future\nis closed off\nlike they get kicked out of school since\nthey're no longer in school\nthey don't get to stay in the country\nthat they're in and they have to like\nmove back home and they have like no job\nprospects\ntheir family has taken out a lot of\nloans so that they can come to the us i\nthink it was the u.s\nto study\nand so what happens to those people so\nthey're real consequences to not doing\nthings quickly enough\num\nyou know it's tough\nit's tough i mean people's lives are\nbeing made or ruined\nevery week and so i think our first\ncommitment is to y'all\n[Music]\nit's tough\nand so once again i don't know that we\ncan necessarily help that person i don't\nknow that we can guarantee that that\nperson is not gonna\nyou know do poorly on their tests and\nstuff like who knows but we're here to\ntry to help\nand our i think our first responsibility\nour primary dharma is to y'all the\nesports stuff is great i think there's\nto be a lot of good stuff that comes out\nof it for sure\ni think like i said i learned a lot i\nlike pages and pages and pages of notes\nand things like that\nwe'll probably uh put together some more\nconcrete lectures for y'all\nin terms of like key takeaways from what\ni learned you know you can say whatever\nyou want to about the ti performance but\nat the end of the day eg is a top tier\nesports organization\nand just their just how they work is\nlike quite remarkable like they are just\namazing workers\nyou know they think a lot they plan a\nlot they communicate a lot they practice\na lot\num\nand so i think that there's a lot to be\nlearned and a lot that you can kind of\nlike apply from the way that they\napproach dota to your own life"
