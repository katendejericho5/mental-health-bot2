    "transcript": "do you have any sense how to translate\nbeing able to grind in a game into\ngrinding in real life immediate\nemotional feedback or immediate feedback\nfrom the game the game tells you\ninstantly when you get rewarding or when\nyou accomplish a goal or don't\naccomplish a goal that the best way they\ncan look at this is homework if you give\na student a online test or an\ninteractive test where they are\nimmediately getting feedback from the\nanswers I find that to be much more\ncompelling a lot of the times for many\npeople than giving them homework where\nthey have to write it all down and they\nfind out the answers the next day\nthey're less engaged with that because\nit doesn't give them immediate\nInteractive feedback I see that more\noften with people that have ADHD I don't\nknow if there's a correlation there but\nthat seems Seems correct to me see see\nwhat more often if they have ADHD I find\nthem to be less engaged if they're not\ngetting immediate feedback on the things\nthat are going on that the actions\nthey're performing absolutely a\ncorrelation in ADHD their ability to\ndelay gratification is impaired because\nthe time window between action and\nreward is very very tight so I think\nthat's what games give you"
