    "transcript": "uh so we're going to try something a\nlittle bit different today um on stream\nwhat we're going to try to do is\nactually like do sort of like a\npsychoanalysis of squid game and then if\nwe have time we'll do we'll review some\nreddit posts hopefully we'll do that\nso here's what um\nso here's what we're gonna do and so\nwe're gonna do something like a\npsychoanalysis of squid game there are a\nlot of disclaimers that i have to toss\nout\nso the first is that um you know i think\nit's kind of\ni think this i'm doing it for fun and\nit's sort of like more for entertainment\nand entertainment than education\nso what we're going to kind of do is\nlike i'm going to give you guys a list\nof like diagnoses and see if you all can\npair up like which character in the game\nhas what diagnosis\nand so this is like very irresponsible\nin some ways so like let me just explain\na couple of things the first is that to\nactually obtain a diagnosis is an\nin-depth and like careful process so\nwhen i do a real diagnostic interview\nwith like a human being it takes like 90\nminutes to two hours i'll ask somewhere\nbetween 40 and 100 questions and so\nthere's like a lot of like specificity\nand carefulness that goes into it so\ntoday what we're going to do is just\nkind of slap diagnosis on people to sort\nof illustrate certain points because i\ndo think that\npart of the reason that i wanted to do\nthis in terms of like even though it's\nyou know a little bit irresponsible like\npeople will um\nbut i i do think that there's a value to\nit because i think there's a big stigma\naround mental illness and i think that\num when po when popular media like\nportrays mental illness i think it can\nactually be useful because it\nillustrates like certain points and\nhelps people like understand or maybe\neven identify\nwith some of the characters and if you\nidentify with some of the characters or\nsome of the traits sound like they kind\nof feel like you i would strongly\nencourage you to go see a licensed\nmental health professional and like\nactually get help\nso the other thing to understand about\nsquid game is that it's like fiction\nright so not only are we not asking them\nquestions but we're also like\nit's all like everything is like blown\nup by like 10 times so things are more\nextreme it's a very like unrealistic\nscenario and i think a lot of the\nportrayals of like mental health and\ndiagnoses are sort of like exacerbated\nor exaggerated so let's just keep that\nin mind as well the third thing is that\nwhen i use the phrase psychoanalysis\nwe're not talking about um\nactual psychoanalysis so that's like a\ndeep process that has a lot of different\ntheories basically what we're going to\nbe doing is like kind of hypothesizing\nabout different diagnoses but\ncolloquially when people talk about that\nthey use the term psychoanalysis so\nwe're not actually doing psychoanalysis\nhere it's just\nthat's not what we're doing\nbut overall uh and then the last\ndisclaimer is that you know there's\ngonna be like huge and massive spoilers\nfor this so if you guys have not seen\nsquid game like don't\ndon't watch this like\ngo do something else and come back and\nwatch it so we're not going to hold back\non the spoilers at all i'm going to\nassume that everyone here has seen it\npart of the reason i wanted to do it now\nis because if you guys have seen it\nyou'll like it'll be fresh in your mind\nso i'm going to talk about particular\nscenes okay so we we good\num yeah if you want to go watch it right\nnow like now is the time\nso uh\nso let's get started okay so this is\nwhat we're gonna do all right i'm gonna\ngo ahead and start by giving you guys\nkind of a list of diagnoses\nor like situ like it's not necessarily\ndiagnoses so what we're going to try to\ndo is pair up some of these like\nconditions or psychological phenomenon\nwith different\nfictional characters okay\nso our our categories are going to be\nlike depression bipolar anxiety\naddiction and attachment disorder ptsd\nreaction formation or suppression\nactually\num so these are like defense mechanisms\nsociopathy and borderline personality\ndisorder okay so if you guys are not\nfamiliar with what these are that's\nactually like perfectly fine it's not\nthat big of a deal\nfor those of you that are a little bit\nfamiliar with this uh you know i\nencourage you to kind of think a little\nbit about\nwhat you know who you think has what\nokay\nso let's go ahead and get started\nso we're gonna start\nwith\num so what i'm gonna do is like we're\ngoing to start actually at the top so\nwe're going to start with the main\ncharacter and once again i'm going to\nbutcher these pronunciations so i\napologize so this is like the main\ncharacter of the the show his name is\ngihon right\nso let's just talk a little bit about\ngihon or the you know the english\nuh\nyou know what whatever that's sort of\nhow they spell his name so this is a guy\nwho's like first of all he's broke right\nso he doesn't have a whole lot of money\nand then like the first thing that he\nlike in the first episode what he does\nis he steals his mom's credit card\nwithdraws cash\ntakes his money to like a horse racing\nplace loses some money\nbets again and then wins right so then\nhe's thrilled he's got a bunch of cash\num he\nis divorced and like makes big promises\nto his daughter and like his daughter\nsort of isn't disappointed when he fails\nto deliver on his promises right she\nkind of knows what her dad is like she\nknows her dad is unreliable she knows\nthat he's gonna like make big promises\nand not live up to them\nand so then what happens is gohun like\njoins the squid game out of like\ndesperation right and then he goes\nthrough the squid game and once again\nhuge spoiler alert he wins and so then\nhe gets this huge pile of money in\ntheory all of his problems should be\nsolved and despite the fact that all of\nhis problems are solved he like\nis a bum for a year drinks booze\nand then kind of randomly like goes and\ncolors his hair\nand then doesn't kind of know what to do\nwith himself and he's going to go see\nhis kid he's going to go like live a\nnormal life and on the verge of actually\nboarding the airplane and like you know\ngoing to see his kid and maybe living a\nregular life\nhe turns around and decides to walk away\nfrom the airplane\n[Music]\nand the presumption is that he's\nactually going to join like squid game\nround two\nso like the diagnosis here is absolutely\nlike gambling addiction okay so this is\na guy that um you know just can't stop\nso like despite the fact that he you\nknow it seems like he has a regular\num\nkind of like body that he goes and\ngambles with\nhe's broke probably part of the reason\nthat he's broke is it appears that he's\nhad like several jobs but he can't like\nstore money away it seems like he's you\nknow failed to show up for his daughter\nlike several times and yet we like him\nright so he's like the protagonist we're\nkind of rooting for him like we feel\nsorry for him despite the fact that he's\ngot this like crippling gambling\naddiction that despite the fact that\nhe's got a bunch of money and can\nbasically like afk for the rest of his\nlife he actually decides that he's gonna\ngo and like play again\nso a couple of important features of of\nuh gambling pathologic gambling or\nbehavioral addictions so one of them is\nimpulsivity and the second one we're\ngoing to talk about is like future\ndiscounting so the brains of people with\nbehavioral addictions tend to be like\nmore impulsive so they have difficulty\nrestraining their impulses and they also\nhave difficulty\num sort of planning for the future and\nthey tend to choose\nshort-term gain over like long-term gain\nso there are experiments that have been\ndone in people who have behavioral\naddictions\nand what we've discovered is that if you\ntake someone with a behavioral addiction\nyou're like i'm gonna give you one\ndollar now or ten dollars tomorrow the\nperson with a behavioral addiction is\nmore likely to choose one dollar now\nthan someone who doesn't have a\nbehavioral addiction who will go for\nlike the long-term gain and we kind of\nsee this in his life right like no\nmatter like what he what his situation\nis he's going to go for that you know\nhigh-yield short-term play like\nirrespective of the situation\ni think there are a couple of other\nthings that are really cool that they\ndemonstrate uh in this show and i i\nreally like the way that they portray\naddiction because a lot of times people\nwith addiction get\num they actually get like\nblamed for their addiction so for many\nyears addiction was kind of viewed as\nlike\nuh you know a moral deficiency or like\nit's their fault and people can just get\nup and like just stop drinking or just\nstop gambling bro\nand so it can be it's sort of viewed as\na moral disease and i think that if you\nlook at episode six in particular right\nso like the reason that episode six is\nso powerful is because we know that\ngiuhun is a good guy like his daughter\ndespite the fact that he's like chain\nfailing his daughter\nhis daughter like still loves him and\ncares about him and she sort of\nunderstands that in a sense it's not his\nfault and he's like a decent human being\nhe just can't control the gambling and\nso that's actually what makes uh episode\nsix so powerful is because\nthat's the first time that we see him\nactually being like morally deficient\nand that's what makes it so devastating\nis that this is a good dude who's got\nlike you know a problem that he's got an\naddiction which sort of like isn't his\nfault\nand there are things that he can do kind\nof better for sure but like in episode\nsix we kind of see like the moral decay\nthat he has and we kind of know that\nmorally he's like a good person and so i\nthink it's sort of a really good\nportrayal of addiction because people\nwith addictions aren't bad people\nthey're just\nthey're normal people who have these\nkinds of addictions\nuh i think the show also does a good job\nof like demonstrating what it's like to\ngrow up with a parent who has an\naddiction so we kind of see this in his\ndaughter because like\num you know she kind of she kind of\nknows what to expect and so you we see a\nlot of like you know impulsive decisions\nthat he makes he gets super frustrated\nwhen he loses but he can't kind of stay\naway and one of the saddest things that\ni've i've worked with i'm going to use\nthat phrase a lot today but one of the\nmost challenging things or saddest\nthings that i've worked with is like\nkids of parents who have addictions\nbecause the kid kind of knows like that\nthe parent just can't be relied on until\nthe addiction gets under control\nand so when i work with with parents who\nhave addictions you know fixing the\naddiction is step one\nbut unfortunately like that's just step\none and what we also have to do is\nrepair the relationship with the child\nso i think kind of in conclusion you\nknow giuhun is someone who's like low on\nmoney like has this impulsivity has this\nlike future discounting problem where he\ncan't make like good long-term decisions\nfor himself he'll just randomly like you\nknow dye his hair red\nand it can be pretty devastating on on\nthe children of people with addictions\nwhich is like just a sad truth\nif you're someone you know who falls\ninto this kind of category where like\nyou can't help but make you know bad\ndecisions that are like short-term gain\ni strongly strongly encourage you this\nis something you all are going to hear a\nlot like if you relate to gihon and you\nhave these kinds of problems i would\nrecommend that you like go and get\nevaluated or supported by a mental\nhealth professional another important\nthing to remember here is that\num just another kind of disclaimer is\nthat\nyou know remember that psychiatric\nillness is not binary so like people\nwill get a diagnosis and we sort of\ntreat it as binary right either you\nget diagnosed with an addiction or you\ndon't get diagnosed with an addiction\nwhereas the truth is that like addiction\nis like a continuous spectrum\nand when we sort of establish a\ndiagnosis is when it sort of crosses a\nparticular threshold but even if you're\nsomeone who doesn't have like as\nimpaired of a life like if an addiction\nthat you have or an addictive behavior\nyou have hasn't screwed over your life\nas much as giuhun's screwed over his\nlife you can still go get professional\nhelp for it right if you're someone\nwho's like highly impulsive and like you\ncan't stay away from a particular thing\nthat's bad for you\neven if you're able to maintain like\nthis is kind of the idea of a\nfunctioning alcoholic\num even if you're able to maintain like\na decent life and like decent family\nstuff decent career stuff you should\nstill consider getting help around it\nso that's\nand his is is an addiction okay\nnext up we have\nsay bjork\n[Music]\ni i don't know how to pronounce this\nright so she's someone who um as best as\ni could tell and i'm still not entirely\n100 sure about this\nescaped from north korea right tried to\nlike uh reassure her brother so we see\nlike early on that her brother's in an\norphanage and she's trying to like\nfigure out a way to get her mom smuggled\ninto north korea i mean out of north\nkorea\num so she sort of drops her brother off\nat the orphanage or her brother is\nstaying at an orphanage and she's trying\nto make things happen if you kind of\nlike look at her she like doesn't smile\nmuch right she doesn't like relate to\nother people she's kind of a loner she\ndistrusts people\num she kind of keeps to herself\nand uh then what what we'll see like a\ncouple of scenes where like she's kind\nof quiet and reserved except for a few\nsituations so one really illustrative\nscene is when she goes to like the i\ndon't know what they're called but like\nthe people who will\nsmuggle people out of north korea and\nhe's kind of like yeah sorry like i\nwasn't able to help and then she's like\nlike gets very very like there's she\nbecomes kind of unstable and like you\nknow burns him with hot tea and we kind\nof see that pattern again and again like\nthroughout the show where she's sort of\nlike calm and reserved and she seems\nlike in control of her emotions except\nwhen there's like an explosion of\nemotion and some degree of like\nemotional instability\nand that she has a lot of\ntrouble like trusting people\nso i think she if we kind of go back to\nour list of you know what our what our\ndiagnoses are i think she bears features\nof an attachment disorder so this is\ngoing to be kind of tricky to understand\num but what we're we're going to kind of\ntry our best\nso\nwhat tends to happen when people are\ntraumatized early in life is that the\ntrauma can manifest in different ways\nso we've done research for example on\nlike cases of like genocide in a\nparticular country right where not\neveryone who experiences some kind of\nshared traumatic event necessarily has\nthe diagnosis of ptsd\nso traumatic experiences or emotional\nabuse or things like that can manifest\nlater in life in a variety of different\nways so for some people it manifests as\nptsd but i think say bjork is like a\ngood example of what seems to me like\nattachment issues\nso then the question kind of becomes\nlike what what is it what is attached\nwhat are attachment issues\nso\nuh there have been a group of\nresearchers that\nyou know really looked at something\ncalled attachment theory and attachment\ntheory is kind of\nan exploration of how human beings form\nconnections\nand so in situations where\nchildren grow up with parents who are\nlike emotionally supportive and most\nimportantly like emotionally mirroring\nthey tend to develop healthy attachment\nstyles and so what that sort of means\njust to give you guys kind of an example\nis like when i'm growing up and i'm a\none-year-old child\ni don't really understand what i feel\nright like one-year-olds can't they\ndon't even understand what they feel and\nthey certainly can't articulate their\nfeelings they can barely talk\nso how does a child understand like make\nsense of the world and understand like\nhow they feel they do it through\nmirroring so when a child you know trips\nand falls down if the parents express\nconcern and support the child learns a\ncouple of important things one is that\nlike the facial expression of the parent\ntells the child whether they should be\nworried or not and you guys may have\nseen this where if a child trips and\nfalls and everyone around them laughs\nthe kid will like get up and laugh too\nand they'll feel totally fine\nif the child trips and falls and\neveryone panics then the child will\nstart crying right so what the child\nfeels is actually determined by\num\nsort of the facial expressions of people\naround them\nand so what happens in healthy\nattachment is that a child grows up and\nlike you know when they get hurt\nthe parents around them will express\nconcern they'll be emotionally\nsupportive so not only does the child\nunderstand what they feel they also come\nto understand that the world is like a\nsafe and secure place because when i\ntrip and fall down and people like treat\nme with like love and respect and care i\nbegin to see the world is like a place\nthat is going to be supportive of me\nright and if the place is if the world\nis going to be supportive of me then i\ncan learn to trust the world and trust\npeople in the world\nthe flip side of that is people who grow\nup in households where parents are not\ngood at emotional mirroring are not good\nat support or like traumatic kind of\nsituations\nin which case the world is not a a safe\nplace\nyou know you're growing up in a pvp zone\nversus a pve zone and so like the pvp\nworld is like very dangerous because\npeople can attack you right people\nparents like when kids trip and fall and\nyou've got a parent who yells at the\nchild for being an idiot and being\nclumsy suddenly like when the child\nneeds emotional support and tlc instead\nwhat they're getting is like blame and\nlike anger and frustration\nfrom the parent\nand so that's the kind of stuff that\nsort of results in attachment disorders\nand so disorders of attachment kind of\nhave a couple of like key and common\nfeatures there's a lot of specificity to\nwhat i'm saying\num but the the key features are like a\ndifficulty like trusting people right a\ndifficulty with like social problems and\nlike a difficulty with like emotional\nability so people with attachment uh\nproblems have difficulty forming\nrelationships with other people and like\nlearning how to trust other people so i\nsee this a lot for example in people who\nhave difficulty forming like romantic\nrelationships\nso some people may be able to like date\ninitially but then they just can't like\nlet their guard down and be vulnerable\nwith another human being they can't\ntrust another human being to like\ntake care of them so instead they have\nto always have their walls up and can't\nform real authentic connections and what\nwe see with say bjork is that she's not\nlike a bad person or anything or maybe\nare you can argue argue that she is but\num you know she seems like a decent\nhuman being who just grows up or\nbelieves that the world is like a\ndistrustful place and where did she kind\nof learn that she learned that probably\nlike presumably growing up in north\nkorea and like you know people not\ncaring for her and like you know she's\nlike just inherently distrustful and we\nkind of see this in people who have a\nproblems of disordered attachment\nand so as a result they have a lot of\ndifficulty like forming relationships\nwith other people so if you're someone\nwho kind of grew up you know in a\nsituation where\nyour parents maybe weren't consistently\nsupportive\nor you grew up kind of like in in today\nyou sort of think that\nthe world is like an unsafe place like\noperating in the world gives you a lot\nof anxiety like you can't trust people\nyou can't count on people\nyou can't\nform connections with people because you\nhave your guard up that sort of makes me\nthink about attachment related issues\nthere isn't a discrete diagnosis here by\nthe way but i still think that it's\nworthwhile to kind of go see a licensed\nmental health professional\nokay\nso that's say bjork\nattachment issues\nso next what we're going to do\nis actually\ntalk about\na less\nkind of more of a side character\nbecause i think it forms a nice contrast\nnext person that we're going to take a\nlook at\nis jion\nso this is a character that once again\nis like kind of quiet right so she kind\nof keeps to herself she's not sort of\nquite as volatile as um say bjork is\nbut she's sort of a loner she doesn't\nreally care about performing connections\nshe's kind of afk\num she just sort of joins up when she\nhas to\nand she's just kind of like afk and kind\nof chilling right so she doesn't like\nsay a whole lot she doesn't do a whole\nlot she's not like particularly playful\nshe's not particularly like\nshe's not even like paranoid in the way\nthat sabjak is she's just sort of like\nafk\nthe one interesting thing is that she\nkind of um gets super pissed off when\nshe like talks to the religious dude or\nwhen the religious dude like talks about\nreligious stuff\nso if we're kind of looking at what her\ndiagnosis is i think this is a really\ngood example of like ptsd or even\ncomplex ptsd\nso this is a good example of i think the\nshow does a good example does a good job\nof demonstrating how trauma can manifest\nin different ways\nso people with ptsd or complex ptsd tend\nto feel empty they kind of feel\nworthless they feel different from other\npeople they feel like nobody understands\nthem and as a result they avoid\nrelationships\nthere's also features of kind of like\ndissociation when it comes to ptsd\nand people when they sort of feel empty\non the inside and they have trouble like\nrelating to other people and if we kind\nof look at her story she kind of talks\nabout how her dad was sort of very\nabusive um it's not really clear in what\nway her dad is abusive but i kind of got\nthe vibe that he was sexually abusive to\nher and was like super religious about\nit\num and so she also like lost her mom and\nthings like that and so people who have\nbeen traumatized like consistently\nso this is where complex ptsd the\ndifference between ptsd and complex ptsd\nis that you can get sort of sexually\nassaulted once or get you know in a car\naccident or something like that and you\ncan develop ptsd from a single event\nwhat some people have started to\ndiscover is that when people get\nrepeatedly traumatized like over and\nover and over again it manifests\nslightly differently from like regular\nptsd and that's when we sort of explore\nthings like complex ptsd\nso based on her history it really sounds\nlike she grew up in a repeatedly\ntraumatic environment and i think they\nactually do a very good job of like\nshowcasing some of the features of\ncomplex ptsd\nand so she kind of feels like you know\nshe can't connect to people she's sort\nof like dissociative which is sort of\nwhat that\ngoing afk is right she doesn't feel a\nwhole lot of things and one of the\nthings that she really they do a good\njob of portraying is like she's kind of\nafk except when it comes to religious\npeople and so if we kind of look at it\nyou know i think that's a really good\nexample of like a trigger right so she\nwas abused by someone who was hyper\nreligious and so as a result like any\ntime someone is religious around her she\nlike gets really really pissed off and\nit triggers like a lot of negative\nfeelings\nanother thing to remember about uh\ntrauma is that in my work as a\npsychiatrist i think about trauma as the\ngreat chameleon\nof psychiatry so it can look like\ndepression it can look like bipolar\ndisorder it can look like just feeling\nafk or being empty\num\nyou know it can feel like people are\njust like damaged and don't have\nself-worth so they have and this is kind\nof important so like when someone gets\ntraumatized at a young age their sense\nof like their internal sense of self\ngets like damaged they don't really feel\nlike a person on the inside and that's\nkind of hard to describe if you feel\nlike a person on the inside that'll be\nlike confusing for you and if you've\nbeen traumatized and don't feel like a\nperson on the inside like that may make\nsense and you may be very confused by\npeople who have this like sense of\npositive identity\nand so if you if your sense of\nself-worth on the inside is damaged and\nyou don't know who you are basically\nit's hard to have a goal right it's hard\nto have a purpose because in order to\nlike have a purpose you have to be a\nmain character you have to know what you\nare on the inside it's also hard to have\nrelationships because a relationship\ninvolves like a connection between two\npeople and if you're kind of empty on\nthe inside and you don't know who you\nare in the inside it's really hard to\nhave a relationship with someone because\nlike you don't really understand who you\nare\num so i think trauma is kind of\ninteresting because it's it really can\nmasquerade as all kinds of different\nthings right they can masquerade as\npeople being checked out or some people\nmay look at gee on and say like oh she's\ndepressed\nbut i really think it's a good kind of\nmedia portrayal like a simplistic kind\nof hyperbolic portrayal of uh\ncptsd or complex trauma\nso the last thing that i'll kind of\npoint out is that like so people with\ncomplex trauma tend to feel like they're\nworth less than other people and so she\nkind of you we even sort of see this\nwhere sometimes people with trauma will\nalso have suicidality and she has no\nproblem um\nyou know sacrificing herself\nfor someone else and so this in a show\nis kind of like very positive right like\nwe feel like oh my god she's like so\nlike she's such a good person unless she\nlike sacrifices herself for her friend\nand we'll get to that relationship in a\nsecond\nbut i think there's unfortunately a\nsinister undercurrent to this which is\nand she even sort of says this right\nshe's like your life is like worth more\nthan mine is and the really sad thing is\nshe may say she kind of says like oh i\ndon't have parents anymore and i don't\nhave anyone in life and so you may even\nobjectively like get on the same page\nwith her and say like okay leah she\ndoesn't have someone right like um say\nbjork has to stay alive for her brother\nand has to stay alive for her sister but\nthe really kind of there's a really sad\nundercurrent to this which is like why\ndoesn't she have anyone right\nand so she's like presumably in her like\nearly 20s i would guess or whatever but\nbecause of her trauma because of the way\nthat she was raised she's actually like\nnot able to form connections so she's a\nloner and it sort of becomes a\nself-fulfilling prophecy the other\ninteresting thing about trauma is even\nif she did have people and so this is\nwhere you know\nif we if she was a real person\nwe may actually discover that she does\nhave people in her life maybe she has a\nboyfriend maybe she has people who care\nabout her maybe she has siblings but\npeople with trauma feel so worthless on\nthe inside that it feels like they don't\nhave anyone because they can't actually\nconnect to anyone because no one really\nunderstands them and they don't\nunderstand other people\nso that's jion the next thing that we're\ngoing to kind of talk about for a second\nis broken relationships that form\nbetween traumatic people or traumatized\npeople so this is something that i've\nseen a lot\nas a psychiatrist so if you look at like\ntwo of the people who have trauma\nthey basically band together right so\nlike there's ceb yakuza loner and g on\nwho's a loner and so like they end up\nkind of pairing up and this is something\nthat is at the same time beautiful and\nsad i've seen this is so much especially\nin like residential trauma treatment\nwhere people who feel broken like i feel\nlike half of a person\nand what happens is i tend to gravitate\ntowards other people who are also like\nbroken so i've seen this in in a way\nit's kind of beautiful that like two\npeople with trauma both feel broken they\nfeel like half of a person so they can\nsometimes feel whole when they get\ntogether\nand so i've seen a lot of like there's\nalmost like a sense of kindred spirits\nwhere when you've been traumatized and\nyou don't really know who you are and\nyou feel like fundamentally broken on\nthe inside\nthe they're like all the normal people\nthat you can't relate to but there are\nall there are people who are just as\nbroken as you are and like there's a\nsense of like kindred spirits and\nthere's this idea that two halves make a\nwhole\nand these these are two people that you\nknow are both confused by like the other\npeople around them right they can't\nconnect with them but there's actually\nlike a connection that can form between\ntwo people who've been traumatized\nunfortunately while these people are\ndrawn to connections with each other i\nwould say that like these relationships\ntend to be very very difficult because\nthe truth is that two people who have\ndifficulty forming connections\neven though they're drawn to each other\nand they can understand each other\nit's been my experience that a lot of\nthese relationships don't end up working\nout well\nand that's just because like both people\nare like not\num\nyou know a lot of times they just like\ncan't connect with each other or there\nare other kinds of problems that arise\nwhere it doesn't seem to work out so you\ncan look at uh you know one study for\nexample that looked at borderline\npersonality disorder which also um\noftentimes has a root in trauma and that\nlike one of the treatments for\nborderline personality disorder is to\nactually form a stable relationship with\nlike someone else who's healthy and over\na period of two years that seems to\nreally help the people with bpd\nso unfortunately you know the the kind\nof fact remains or i don't know if it's\nreally a fact i don't really have good\nstatistics around this but\num you know what i've kind of seen is\nthat people who get together when\npsychiatrically hospitalized and that\nmay have nothing to do with the trauma\nit may have to do more with sort of the\nfact that they're at their low point and\ntheir mental illness is like very very\nactive and bad at that point\nthat's probably a bigger factor\nwhen when two feet people feel broken\nand they kind of connect sometimes it\ndoesn't turn out to be the best\nrelationship\ni've also seen the flip side of it so\nthis is like a good example in terms of\naddictions so a lot of people will like\nfall in love and rehab and that can be\nreally fantastic\nand i think i've seen a lot of people\nwho are in recovery and can really\nsupport each other two people who are in\nrecovery and like working on sobriety\ntogether and they start a romantic\nrelationship and they actually end up\nlike getting married and like staying\nsober and together for like three\ndecades i've seen those kinds of\nrelationships and they can truly be\namazing\nunfortunately most of the relationships\nthat i've seen i'm just talking about\nanecdotally here as an addiction\npsychiatrist who does like inpatient and\nalso residential treatment a lot of\ntimes those relationships kind of don't\nwork out so if you're someone who's been\ntraumatized\nyou know it sort of makes sense that\nyou'll sometimes be drawn to other\npeople with trauma but just be careful\nabout that relationship you know\nrecognize that that's going to be\nsomething that could be hard for you and\ncould be hard for the other person and\nthat it's going to take a lot of like\nperseverance and compassion for that\nrelationship to really work\nokay\nto be fair most relationships in general\ndon't last that's very true right so i\nthink there are a lot of caveats to what\ni'm saying i just wanted to kind of\ncomment on this phenomenon that i've\nobserved\nthat sometimes people who are broken are\nattracted to other people who are broken\nand they can feel like a real and\ngenuine connection in that way whether\nthat's a good thing or a bad thing\nhonestly like i don't know the data i've\nseen both scenarios when it works out\nit's actually like really amazing and\nunfortunately most of the times it seems\nlike it doesn't work out great\ntrauma bond is serious absolutely right\nso that's where i think it's important\nto remember that like you can bond with\nsomeone who's\nhad a trauma\nwithout muddying that relationship with\nsome kind of romance or sexuality right\nlike you can absolutely form a healthy\ntrauma bond and that's what we see in in\ntreatment right people will like get\nreally close to each other in recovery\nis a good example of like very very\npowerful bonds that are formed because\npeople are like walking a journey\ntogether that's difficult\nand sometimes they'll screw up that bond\nby like\ncontaminating it with other\nrelationships like going into business\ntogether or romance\num\nokay\nso let's move on\nso next up\nwe have\num\nhold on\ndid i yeah\nso next up we have migno\ni don't know exactly how to pronounce\nher name juan migno\nso she's actually one of my favorite\ncharacters in the game\nin squid game so she's like super\nfriendly right smiles a lot she like\nfigures out what the power dynamic is\nand goes for the gangster she um her\nher relationships tend to like turn on a\ndime so she'll be like super into\nsomeone one second and she'll be like\nnot into them the next second she's also\nlike quite manipulative and she's also\nhypersexual so she's like willing to\nhave sex at the drop of a hat\nand so i don't know if you guys have a\nhave a guess for this\nbut i think she is unfortunately um the\nclassic media portrayal of a a woman\nwith borderline personality disorder\nso this is something that i think is\nactually like really unfortunate in\nmedia portrayals but when people like\ntry to demonstrate borderline\npersonality disorder they always make it\na woman and there is evidence that women\nare more likely to be diagnosed with\nborderline personality disorder than men\nbut i do think basically it's like it's\npart of it's propagating something that\nmay be statistically true but sometimes\ni find it to be sort of like a harmful\nstereotype\nso a lot of shows will or movies will\nhave like kind of this idea of the crazy\nex-girlfriend\nand that person will have features of\nborderline personality disorder so bpd\nis characterized by a pattern of\nunstable relationships mood fluctuations\nlike somewhat manipulative behavior in\nthe psychological defense mechanism\ncalled splitting\nso we're going to talk about splitting\nfor a second so people with bpd the core\nproblem here is that they their sense of\nself like other traumatic illnesses so\nsome people who\nexperience trauma early in life will\ndevelop something like bpd so you can\nhave kind of attachment issues you can\nhave ptsd you can have complex ptsd you\ncan have bpd you can also have like\nlight versions of all of these things so\nsometimes as psychiatrists we won't\ndiagnose someone with a disorder but\nthey sort of have\nwhat we'll call a borderline personality\nstructure or organization so it's not\nthat this person really has an impaired\nfunction like they can function normally\nin life but they kind of have the\npsychology psychological vulnerabilities\nthat someone with bpd has\nso these people\nto other people they feel very\nmanipulative and what's going on here\nthe core issue with bpd is that\nthese people\nsomeone with bpd's identity and i'm\noversimplifying here okay so you guys\nhave to take this with a grain of salt\nwho they are is determined by how\nthey're treated so if i'm treated with\nlove and respect i have a lot of self or\nesteem but if i'm treated like crap i\nwill feel very very worthless and so\nthis may be true to a certain degree of\nall people right like if i get bullied\nby my entire school like i'm gonna feel\nlike crap and if i get treated like the\nbest thing since sliced bread by my\nentire school i will feel really amazing\nright i'll feel like egotistical and\ni'll feel great about myself so this is\na common element of like human\npsychology but with bpd people they're\nvery very sensitive to it so you know\nthey will feel amazing one day and and\nlike the next day if people like are\nslightly like if they don't if someone\ndoesn't answer their texts texts or you\nknow people don't like respond to them\nthe way that they kind of want to be\nresponded to their mood can really\nreally crash so this sort of results in\nmood fluctuations they're not bipolar\nlike a lot of times people with bpd will\nlike be diagnosed or think that they're\nbipolar because their mood fluctuates\nvery very rapidly but their mood is\nheavily influenced by the way that\nthey're treated\nthey also end up being manipulative but\ni don't think that a lot of this is like\nconscious manipulation what these people\nhave sort of learned from like the way\nthey've evolved and adapted is that if i\nfeel loved like i'll you know if i can\nget someone to express\nlove towards me\ni will feel loved and i will be someone\nwho is worth loving so their identity is\ndetermined by the way that people treat\nthem and so what that sort of results in\nis like a lot of like manipulative\nbehavior so if i'm feeling unloved on a\ngiven day\ni may express thoughts of suicide or i\nmay like express thoughts of like you\nknow i'll do things that will will make\npeople care about me right so i'll kind\nof like you know i'll do things that\nkind of evoke in other people like a\ndesire to like take care of me and love\nme and like treat me with like you know\nlike kid gloves and hug me and protect\nme and all that kind of stuff so what\nthese people will do is that that\num i think a lot of people who are in\nrelationships not necessarily romantic\nrelationships but with people uh with\nwith bpd\nis they'll feel like\nstuck and emotionally manipulated into\nkind of loving someone so we'll also see\nthis with like parent-child\nrelationships where parents who have bpd\nwill like\nsort of emotionally hold their children\nhostage so if you're in a relationship\nwith someone with like a borderline\norganization what that person feels like\nis what i would call an emotional\nhostage because if you try to pull away\nfrom them if you try to like set\nboundaries with them if you start to be\nunavailable to them they'll escalate\nvery rapidly and like force you into\ncaring about them and not leaving and\nnot taking a break we also see this in\nsome unfortunate cases with with\ntreaters\nwho when they go on vacation like the\nperson kind of falls apart or the the\npsychiatrist or therapist will feel like\nif i go on vacation this person is going\nto like get hospitalized or may try to\ncommit suicide so unfortunately people\nwith bpd will sometimes hold people\nemotionally hostage and that's where\nthat kind of manipulation comes from\num there's also a lot of like splitting\ngoing on so what this means is that\nif they're interacting with some people\nthey will love some people and hate some\npeople so we'll see that you know for\nexample the person with borderline\npersonality disorder who's hospitalized\nso these are people who are at the\nlowest of their lows so we don't we try\nnot to judge them for this because it's\nsort of not their fault they're under a\nlot of stress what they'll do is they'll\nlike either love the doctor and hate the\nnurse or they'll hate the doctor and\nlove the nurse and so what they tend to\ndo is like create kind of social strife\nby\nkind of idealizing some people and\nreally like viewing other people very\nnegatively so we'll also see this in in\nother social situations where like\nthey'll think that one person is is like\nyou know amazing and perfect and awesome\nand everyone else is like terrible and\ncrappy or things like that\nso that's splitting so they basically\nthink very black and white about their\nrelationships\nand what this kind of results in when\nyou have these high mood fluctuations\nwhen you're very like sensitive\nto\nother people's opinions of you when you\nkind of hold people emotionally hostage\nwhen you try to manipulate people into\ntreating you a particular way or not\nabandoning you right so a lot of times\npeople with bpd will have a fear of\nabandonment and we kind of see that in\nmino in the way that she works with like\nthe gangster where she's like promise me\nthat you'll never leave me promise me\nthat you'll go through this so people\nwith bpd will oftentimes like try to\nextract promises of fidelity from other\npeople\nand they'll kind of like you know try to\nguilt-trip you because you promised you\npromised you promised i gave you\neverything that you wanted please love\nme please don't ever leave me there's\nkind of this fear of abandonment and\nwhat it does is it it kind of drives\npeople like a little bit crazy so it can\nbe really hard to be on the other end of\nthat relationship\nand so what that results in is very\nunstable relationships so people with\nbpd in unfortunate cases will kind of\nuse sexuality to feel loved um they'll\nlike love and hate very quickly and\nthey'll sort of result in like unstable\nrelationships so she's kind of a good\nexample of sort of the worst\ncharacteristics of people with bpd\none thing i think it's another important\ndisclaimer to toss out here that she's\nkind of like\num\nkind of a textbook or a fictional case\nof like the worst aspects of bpd the\ngood news is that\ni've also worked with a lot of\nborderline personality disorder folks\ni actually really really enjoy working\nwith them it's some of the most\ngratifying work that i've ever done\nand i think they respond really really\nwell to some like eastern principles of\nlike discovering who you truly are\num the best evidence-based treatment of\nbpd in my opinion is dialectical\nbehavioral therapy which has a large\ncomponent of like mindfulness and like\ndiscovering who you are\num so the good news is that you know if\nyou have bpd in real life you're not\nyou're not like her this is what i think\nis really unfortunate about media\nportrayals of bpd is they like make them\nseem so imp unsympathetic and then if\nyou're like oh my god i'm this kind of\nperson like you're not this kind of\nperson she's like an absolute fictional\nversion of bpd and the real truth is\nthat like people who have a borderline\norganization or people who have bpd are\nactually like wonderful awesome people\nthey can be like wonderful people who\njust have these kinds of vulnerabilities\nand tendencies\nbut with help and support and patience\nthey can like you know they don't have\nto give in to those tendencies they can\nactually conquer it and there are\nstudies that have been done that have\nshown that essentially like bpd can be\nlike\nuh you know with good treatment and\nstable relationships someone who acts\nthis way in a year or two can actually\nno longer meet criteria for bpd the\nbehaviors kind of go away um you know\nnot necessarily completely but they're\nlike no longer pathologic\nso that's her\nnext up\nwe have uh\ndoksu\n[Laughter]\nwho's like our gangster right so he like\nbackstabs people\nhe's a criminal he's dominating like he\ndoesn't really mind killing people\num you know he's kind of like the first\nvillain in the show and so if we kind of\ngo to our you know what's his diagnosis\nhopefully you guys can get this one but\nit's sociopathy\nso oh so he's a great example\nof um\nwhat i would call a low functioning\nsociopath\nso this is where we got to talk a little\nbit about sociopathy so sociopathy is\nsort of characterized by like a lack of\nempathy\nfor other human beings\nso what this kind of means is that they\ndon't like you know we have most human\nbeings have sort of this internal moral\ncompass\nthat helps us understand like what is\nright and what is wrong and people who\nare on the anti-social personality\ndisorder spectrum um which is also like\nsociopathy the terms i'm going to use\nthem interchangeably\nbasically like don't have that internal\nsense or the internal sense is not as\nstrong as as it is in other people so\nsociopathy is also a spectrum so much\nlike uh bpd you know there are some\npeople who are like very far on the\nbottom end of the spectrum and are\nhighly sociopathic and then on the other\nend of the spectrum are people who are\nvery empathic and not sociopathic at all\nand so people who are kind of like at\nthe bottom end of the spectrum or maybe\nthe high end of the spectrum if you're\ntalking about sociopathy as a positive\nvariable\num you know people who are very\nsociopathic let's put it that way are\npeople who like don't lack empathy and\nthen like will do like cruel things to\nother people so\nuh sociopathy in childhood is caught\ncalled conduct disorder and like some of\nthe you know more diagnostic features of\nconduct disorder are things like\ntorturing animals and like setting fire\nto things so people who are high on the\nsociopathy spectrum or kids with conduct\ndisorder you know will will sort of not\nrespect property they won't respect\nother people they'll sometimes inflict\nharm on other people conduct disorder\nisn't necessarily sociopathy though a\nlot of times that also has to do with a\ntraumatic upbringing\num but sociopathy is sort of\ncharacterized by a lack of empathy and\nis like generally speaking the\ntraditional villain so most villains in\ntv shows and movies and things like that\ntend to be sociopaths there's an\nimportant um point to understand about\nsociopathy research which is that a lot\nof the sociopathy research comes from\nprisons so like people who have what i\nwould call low functioning sociopathy\ntend to wind up being criminals\nand so i think honestly sociopathy in a\nweird way kind of gets a bad name\nbecause most of the research is not done\non normal people who have sociopathic\ncharacteristics it's actually done on\ncriminals so when we think about\nsociopathy we're sort of studying like\nthe worst sociopaths and generalizing\nthings about sociopathy\nso\nthis is where\nif you really look at it like there are\na lot of\nprofessions that\nwhere people are like highly functional\nand can live normal lives\nand some of these professions will\ncorrelate with higher amounts of\nsociopathy we're not talking like at the\nsuper high levels\nwhere it really kind of becomes a\ndisorder\nbut if you look at things like\nexecutives even if you look at things\nlike uh professions like sometimes\nsurgeons or psychiatrists sometimes they\ncan actually test highly on the\nsociopathy scale compared to the normal\npopulation and the reason for that is\nthat these professions require\nsome amount of like emotional numbness\nright like if you\num are a psychiatrist and like you have\npatients that are committing suicide\nbecause like that's the population you\nwork with right like that sort of what i\nmean that's just what's going to happen\nif you're a psychiatrist and you work\nwith like the sickest populations that\nhave the highest chance of suicide then\nyou are going to be dealing emotionally\nwith a lot of suicide as a result you\nhave to learn how to numb your emotions\nto kind of survive in those sorts of\nsituations\nceos kind of also have to do this sort\nof thing right like if you have to lay\noff a thousand workers\nit's protective or adaptive to be like a\nlittle bit callous at heart\nthe other thing to remember is that\nsociopathy is like a part of\nhuman evolution right so these people\nexist and if they exist there must be\nsome kind of adaptive advantage to it\nand we kind of see that in in in uh\nsquid game because like this person\nreally excels in this competitive\ncutthroat environment so this is also\nwhere you'll see um people with like\nhigh sociopathy sort of excel in\nparticular environments so he also you\nknow is isn't worried about killing\npeople he doesn't really demonstrate\nremorse he forms alliances not out of\ncare or support or anything like that\nall of his alliances form out of\nself-gain\nand so he's also kind of like this\nclassic demonstration of like a male\nsociopath so this is also where we have\nto toss in another disclaimer which is\nlike if you get diagnosed with\nsociopathy it does not mean you are this\nperson right this is a caricature he's a\nfictional representation he's like socio\nthe worst characteristics of sociopathy\nlike embodied within a fictional\ncharacter\nthis is also where generally speaking\nin media portrayals you'll have women\nwho get\nwomen's tend to exemplify the worst\ncharacteristics of bpd\nand men tend to exemplify the worst\ncharacteristics of sociopathy\nso next up\nwe've got\ngeon\n[Music]\nso this is a dude who's kind of quiet\num doesn't really form a whole lot of\nvery close connections he's kind of like\nhe's not quite afk but he's like kind of\nlike neutral he's going to try to win um\nyou know you can kind of see i think\nthey do a really good job of showing and\nnot telling here where like you know the\nmain character gihon is so happy to see\num\nuh\nsorry this is uh\nso uh\nseng wu is is smart he's successful um\nhe's uh\nyou know he's in finance\nhe got into some kind of problem with\nlike fraud and embezzlement he's sort of\ndesperate he's kind of image conscious\nhe winds up being you know i guess the\nsecond villain\nand i think they do a really good job of\num\ncatching a lot with his facial\nexpressions whereas like gihon is like\nvery genuine and wants to be friends and\nlike wants to work together and sengwoo\nis kind of like holding back a little\nbit right he he works together out of\nuh he forms alliances also out of self\ngain\nand there's the episode where\nhe kind of has the the idea of like the\nsugar game and like you know what we're\ngonna have to do\num and he's sort of he remembers that in\nthe sugar game like okay like you should\nhave an easy shape right so but instead\nof like sharing this information with\nhis team he actually goes ahead and like\nsays hey we should split up so he\nactually subtly tries to sandbag and\nkind of actually get gehun killed right\nso he\nhis diagnosis is actually sociopathy as\nwell\nso he's a good example of what i would\ncall a high functioning sociopath\nso this is where\nlike i kind of said that if you look in\nsome industries people test highly on\nthe sociopathy scale\nand so he feels some degree of of\nempathy right he's not completely like\ncold hearted and and numb he does some\namount of caring but he actually shares\na lot of features with the the gangster\nright he's gonna like kind of throw\npeople under the bus he's gonna go for\nhimself first\nhe's going to try to form alliances for\nself gain he's very competitive he's\nsort of immoral and has this ends\njustifies the means kind of attitude i'm\ngoing to do whatever it takes to win um\nhe'll sort of throw people under the bus\nand frankly i've seen a lot of this in\nfinance so when you work in investment\nbanking and private equity unfortunately\nthere's a lot of like cut throatness to\nit right some people are kind of\ncutthroat they're gunners we actually i\nalso see this in medicine and doctors\ncan sometimes test higher on the\nsociopathy scale than the average person\nso in medical school you'll have some\nstudents who are like gunners like\nthey're going to be number one and if\nthey have to leave a trail of like you\nknow failing medical students behind\nthem they're willing to do that they're\nthe kind of people that will ask for\nnotes but if you ask them they'll be\nlike sorry i don't have them and they'll\nactually lie to your face they'll also\ndo things like throw people under the\nbus so we'll see this kind of in in you\nknow different kinds of work\nenvironments you may know people\nat work who will be the first to claim\ncredit but they're like hyper\ncompetitive and they'll kind of throw\nyou under the bus if you do something\nwrong\nso i think this is a better example of\nwhat i call kind of high functioning\nsociopathy so these are people who are\nless empathic or kind of highly\ncompetitive and we can see how\nsociopathic characteristics can result\nin like you know people\nsucceeding in the world\nright and we can also remember that\nsaying woo despite being the top of his\nclass and the pride of his his like\nneighborhood\nwent to uh you know nationals\nuh seoul university or whatever nsu is\nand then\nrose in finance was super successful and\nthen got into selling fraud and\nembezzlement kind of stuff right and so\nif we look at the industry of finance\nlike no one's that surprised that people\nin finance are doing like shady stuff\nright you can look at like the gamestop\nstuff the gme stuff uh citadel\nsecurities and robin hood and like\npeople are just doing shady stuff in\nfinance people did shady stuff in\nfinance and enron they did shady stuff\nin 2007 2008 and so like a lot of people\nlike there are some industries where\nthese high functioning people who are\nsort of higher on the sociopathic scale\nbut are actually really smart and don't\nwind up in jail where you find these\npeople\nso he's kind of an example of a high\nfunctioning sociopath the good news is\nthat they do feel empathy right and\nsengwu isn't all evil he's not like the\ngangster and i've also worked with a lot\nof sociopaths who do feel empathy want\nto try to be good people and they can\nactually be like very good people i\nthink he is also a negative portrayal of\nit where when you kind of when you put\nhim into the pressure\nof a life and death situation he's going\nto choose himself first and they do a\ngood job if you watch his like facial\nexpressions of like between the first\nepisode and the last episode his\ninternal struggle and sometimes he helps\npeople and sometimes he doesn't right\nand so they kind of do a good job of\nthat and if you're even if you're a\nhigh-functioning sociopath i've worked\nwith a lot of a lot of them i mean they\ndon't really meet criteria for the\nillness they're not really don't have\nthe disorder but they kind of have a low\nempathy sort of enz justifies the means\nkind of makeup right they're kind of\nmachiavellian\nthe good news is that they can actually\nbe very good people and can like care\nfor other people as well\nso next up\nwe've got o ilnam\nso this is the other guy who sort of\nturns out to be the villain right so\nhe's like he's kind of got this weird\nsituation where\nhe apparently is very financially\nsuccessful\num\nand he's got a brain tumor and his time\nis running out\nand he's a very likable and genuine guy\nuh\nyou know like we all love him we're\nrooting for him we feel compassion\ntowards him once again ganbu episode six\nis like the episode where like\nyou know he gets taken advantage of and\nit's like the highest amount of feels in\nthe show i think it's clearly like the\nbest episode in the show\nand so he kind of comments that people\nwithout money and tons of money are the\nones that like kind of feel empty inside\nand he's decided to orchestrate the\nsquid game to try to feel alive right\nwhich sounds super super screwed up\nso what's his diagnosis so he certainly\nhas features of sociopathy but this is\nwhere i'm gonna actually go ahead oh\ni'm gonna go ahead and\ndebate y'all a little bit and then i'm\ngonna add something else\nso i'm gonna add what i call buddha\nsyndrome\nand this is what i'd say this guy really\nexemplifies\nso buddhist syndrome\nis something that the reason i call it\nthat is because it was actually\ncharacterized like by buddha\nso buddha was a guy who had everything\nand ended up feeling empty and unhappy\nright so he was loved he was respected\nhe was powerful he was wealthy and then\nhe kind of\nwakes up one day and sort of like feels\nempty inside and he's like this does not\nbring me happiness\nso he sacrifices everything he gives\neverything up um you know so it takes a\nslightly different approach from o'il\nnam who oil nom is like in order to feel\nalive i'm gonna create the squid game\nand like you know fight for my life and\nif you guys even look at like red light\ngreen light you can see oil nom really\nenjoys the games right he longs to feel\nuh\nalive in some way and so he like goes\nback to his childhood and stuff like\nthat to try to recapture some sense of\nhappiness before he became rich and\nbefore he became successful and before\nhe started to feel empty\nand so buddha sort of described this and\nwhat would the sort of discovered is\nthat like no amount of money will\nnecessarily buy happiness and i think\nthere are some issues with that but what\nbuddha basically discovered is that like\nsuffering and contentment doesn't have\nto do with material things now there's\nsome scientific research that kind of\nopposes this right so if you look at\nresearch on happiness for example that\nlike\nhappiness does correlate with material\nsecurity for sure up to a particular\npoint\nso my personal take trying to reconcile\nbuddha's approach which i think there's\na lot of wisdom to\nand science is that money is necessary\nbut not sufficient for happiness\nso money will protect you\nfrom um\nyou know feeling despair on some level\nand feeling insecurity and can protect\nyou from stress\nbut it is not sufficient to be happy\nand success and being like you know rich\nin life can actually result in feeling\nempty and this is something that we see\na lot within celebrities right so like\nwe'll see this in twitch streamers we'll\nsee it in celebrities we'll even see it\nin trust fund babies which is like these\npeople seem to have everything and yet\nthey're not happy\nand this is where personally i feel like\na little bit frustrated because it's\nbeen my experience i've had you know\nrich and privileged patients who commit\nsuicide um and i've had you know poor\nand and like\nuh you know persecuted patients commit\nsuicide and the sad truth is that i\nthink somewhere along the way as a\nsociety we've stopped being\ncompassionate towards people who have\nprivilege and i think that there are\nsome good reasons for this right like\nlike it's not like we should devote all\nof our compassion towards people who are\nlucky or rich or beautiful\ni do think that we should try to devote\nyou know a lot of our resources in our\ncare and our compassion in a lopsided\nmanner towards people who have it worse\noff than people who are lucky or rich or\nsuccessful\nbut i i do think it's like fundamentally\nwrong that we don't demonstrate\ncompassion towards like people who are\nsuffering in any way shape or form\nand this is where you know as the\ninternet or as society we tend to have\nlike a very like um\nlove-hate relationship towards people\nwho are celebrities right so like a good\nexample of this is when robin williams\ncommits suicide like the whole world is\nthere for him but when a lot of uh\ncelebrities complain about being\ndepressed\nlike\nlike the internet will jump down their\nthroat they'll be like why are you\ndepressed what do you have to complain\nof for you're so privileged you're so\nattractive you're so rich you have\nnothing to complain about right\num\nyou know it's kind of interesting but\nand i i just personally like i don't\nagree with that i think that as human\nbeings like we all deserve compassion\nand is privilege a part of the equation\nabsolutely like i'm not saying that we\nshould you know prioritize everyone the\nsame amount\nbut i do think that it's kind of unfair\nthat like just because someone has\nprivilege that we sort of\nallow ourselves as a society to actually\nlike attack them it's not just a lack of\ncompassion we don't treat them\nyou know neutrally right like what we\nactually do is attack them and then it\nputs them in a very interesting\nsituation unfortunate situation and you\nguys will have seen this when we talk to\nstreamers is they're not allowed to\ncomplain\nand like i think one of the most\ndevastating things one of the most\nisolating and lonely things that you can\ndo to someone\nis not allow them to complain and not\nallow them to like open themselves up\nfor support from other people and it's\nsuper kind of sad and i think this is\nwhere actually our community and twitch\nhas been really fantastic where you know\nthere are super privileged people who\nhave come on our stream and have shared\nwith the world that like their life is\nnot perfect and i i really love this\ncommunity because this community rises\nabove the judgmentalness of the internet\nand we treat people like the way they\ndeserve to be treated right we look past\nhatred we look past political\ndifferences we look past wealth and\npower and beauty and we can treat people\nwith compassion and i think if we\ngenuinely want to make the world a\nbetter place crapping on people who are\nlucky is like not the right way to move\nto move uh do it\nso he at the end of the day has what i\nwould call buddha syndrome which is that\nwhen you're privileged you start to feel\nempty in life and i much prefer buddha's\nmethod of kind of resolving that which\nis to um you know seek like the true\nmeaning of happiness through like\nintrospection and meditation and\nexploration as opposed to create a game\nwhere people have to kill each other to\nsurvive\num you know i think there's also a theme\nthat is kind of lived out in saw as well\nif you guys have seen the saw movies\nwhere he's like trying to help people\ndiscover life through like\nyou know\ntrying to kill them which i don't think\nis a good thing to do\nso we're gonna go ahead and pause for a\nsecond um\nand uh\nyou know so this has been sort of like\nmy exploration of squid game i think\nit's a wonderful tv show it's super hype\num\nand i think it actually does a really\ngood job of portraying\nuh\nyou know\ncaricatures of mental illness so i do\nthink that you know if you watch these\nthings like i don't want y'all if you\nguys don't understand these diagnoses\nand haven't met people like this i don't\nwant you to walk away from this thinking\noh like\nthis is what sociopathy looks like this\nis what ppd looks like this is what\naddiction looks like they do a good job\nof portraying it but remember that real\nhumans who suffer from these problems\nare very very complex and have like a\nlot more to them than what the show\nportrays\nat the same time i think the show does a\ngood job of showing like how good people\nand bad people can struggle with like\nmental health issues i think the show is\na beautiful exploration of trauma\nbecause it shows like how trauma can\nmanifest in so many different ways and i\nlike it because i think they're doing a\ngood job of like de-stigma hopefully\ndestigmatizing mental illness now you\ncan absolutely make the argument that\nwhat they're also doing is stigmatizing\nmental illness which i think is probably\nsomewhat true especially when it comes\nto things like bpd and sociopathy\nso you know i i hope to part of the\nreason that i'm sort of sharing this\nwith you all is because i thought it was\nreally interesting i think it's cool\nthat\num media is starting to really\nincorporate like aspects of mental\nillness into into their portrayals of\nthese stories i think that mental\nillness is on the rise and like 30 to 50\npercent of people suffer from something\nor other\nand um you know i think it's really neat\nthat like they do this\none of the things that i'm super curious\nabout is like how they do this like is\nthis something that they consulted like\na psychiatrist or a psychologist for or\nis it just within the consciousness of\nthe people and of society that like\npeople know that this kind of stuff\nexists and trauma can affect people in\nthese ways which i think would be super\ncool\ni did have one teacher um i didn't have\nlike a really close relationship with\nthem but there was one teacher at\nharvard medical school a psychiatrist\nwho like consulted for tv shows and\nstuff like that\nand um so i i do know that that happens\nso i think it's kind of neat that you\nknow shows are kind of exemplifying this\num\nso\nquestions that y'all have there are a\ncouple of characters that i didn't get\nto but frankly i'm kind of tired\nif you guys want to we can do one or two\nmore but\nyeah so in its defense i think the show\nis based on a large number of people who\nhave done bad things absolutely so\nthat's a great point so remember that\nthis is a show that's like demonstrating\npeople under huge amounts of stress and\nthe way that i think about you know\nmental illness and especially\npersonality disorders is that these\npeople can be completely normal\nbut when you put them under periods of\nhigh amounts of stress some of these\ndeeper vulnerabilities get exposed\nright like the internal weaknesses when\nyou're put under pressure is like when\nyou crack and based on your\npersonality organization structure it\ndetermines the way in which you crack\nah so ali so i wasn't i can talk about\nali quickly so this ali is kind of\ninteresting um so the two people that i\ndidn't talk to\nis the hyper religious guy\n[Laughter]\nso i think ali is a good example of what\ni would call like cultural conditioning\nso if you look at ali he um\nhas you know he like values himself less\nthan other people so he keeps on\naddressing other people as sir he\ndoesn't like need respect from other\npeople he kind of like gets bullied by\nother people right like he kind of like\nis a doormat\nand this is kind of interesting but i\nthink this is absolutely like cultural\nconditioning\nso the unfortunate truth is that in\nindia and\nnot just india but in india i understand\nit really well\nyou know there used to be a caste system\nwhere there still is a caste system it\nused to be worse it's gotten better but\nit's still very present\nand so like people are taught like the\nidea that all human beings are equal is\nnot something that\nthe average indian\nat least 30 years ago grew up with\nthere's like a tier of quality of human\nright so there's like a\na caste system and like some castes are\nbetter than others\nand you'll see this in india where\nthere's like the servant class and then\nthere's like the\nthe wealthy class now those are the\nbiggest things\nand so you know you'll have one\nhousehold that has like five people\nliving there and then they'll have like\neight to nine servants and the servants\nget paid you know very very little\namounts of money like they don't aspire\ntoo much and everyone just sort of\naccepts that\nthat you know like the servants will eat\nin a different way i think downton abbey\nis like another good example of like a\nclass\nbased representation of society right\nand some people in downton abbey are\nlike uppity and they want to be better\nthan what they're what they are and some\npeople like think that that's really bad\nso um i think it's it's basically\ncultural conditioning and he's probably\nlike a low-caste person which is what\nyou tend to see so a lot of these like\nlow-caste people are forced to like\nleave the country to look for work\nelsewhere because they don't have good\nprospects in their home country he's\nactually not indian i think ali is\npakistani so i think in the in the\nindian subcontinent you'll see in south\nasia you'll see this i assume in\npakistan i just don't have a whole lot\nof experience which is why i'm talking\nabout india you'll see it in bangladesh\ntoo so there's a lot of for example\nyou know\nworkers that will leave the indian\nsubcontinent and will go to the uae\nwe'll go to the mena region we'll\nemigrate to i guess korea and stuff like\nthat they're basically looking for a\nbetter life um it's something that you\nknow my family did so my parents\nemigrated from india and came to the\nunited states looking for a better life\ni they were uh generally speaking higher\ncaste people so their ambition and their\nself-respect like they understood as\nhuman beings that they were like sort of\nentitled to some amount of like success\nand fair play and i think that was like\na big part of like why they emigrated\nand why they became doctors and stuff\nlike that\nand it's also where sometimes i think\nit's a little bit unfortunate that\num you know when we try to look at\nequality we tend to look at race which i\ndon't think necessarily is a bad thing\nbut i think there are shortcomings and i\nremember uh just sharing one example i'm\nnot saying that we shouldn't try to have\nracial equality so hopefully this won't\ntaken out get taken out of context but i\njust want to share one example with\ny'all\nso um when you are south asian and you\ntake the medical college admissions test\nin the united states\nin order to to be\num\ncompetitive you basically have to score\ntwo points higher or what used to be two\npoints or maybe like 10 to 20 percent\nhigher\nthan the average applicant to have a\nchance to get in so like you know the\ndeck is actually stacked against you if\nyou're south asian\nso that i think sort of makes sense\nbecause in the united states you know\nyou have like tons of like indian\ndoctors right and like you because the\npeople who emigrated most of the people\nwho came to the united states were\nsuccessful and prioritize academics so\nfor example like i had certain\nadvantages like my parents could pay for\nlike uh medical college admissions test\nprep course right so i've got like some\nsystemic advantages which sort of\nexplain why on average like we do better\nand also like the medical colleges are\ntrying to like not have you know 50\nclasses who are south asian so they sort\nof like will treat south asians slightly\ndifferently\ni think the downside is that\nunfortunately medical schools sort of\ndon't\nrecognize or don't have the\nsophistication to account for like poor\nindian people\nso if you think about the indian sub\ncontinent most of them are not didn't\ngrow up with the privilege that i grew\nup with so i was uh basically a mentor\nto a low caste indian kid a dalit\nwas the cast that they were in\nfrom like south india and like\nhe was screwed like he had none of the\nadvantages that i had his parents were\npoor um his mom and dad were both like\ncleaning people at a hotel where they\nworked\nillegally for less than minimum wage and\nthey were actually like\nvictims of i think a predatory hiring\npractice of like higher caste indian\npeople so they came to the u.s to give\nopportunities for their son and they got\npaid like three dollars a day plus like\nroom and food and and so they were\nactually victims and like the dulleth\nkid that i was advising like had none of\nthe advantages that i had but when it\ncomes to medical college admissions like\nhe checks a particular box and when he\nshows up for an interview he's actually\nplaying with the same disadvantage that\ni am so i don't actually begrudge the\ndisadvantage that i dealt with because\nat the end of the day i still got into\nmedical school even though the deck is\nstacked against me and that's because i\nthink it sort of balances out i think\nunfortunately the dollar kid i mean that\nkid was kind of screwed right so he gets\njudged based on the color of his skin\nand gets like plays at a disadvantage so\ni hope that\nas we really start to move towards like\nmore sophisticated\navenues of equality like i would love it\nif society could give that kid a break\nthat he deserves\nbut going back to ali i think that ali\nis just a good example of this kind of\ncultural conditioning of like different\ncastes and different\num\nyou know different like a class oriented\nconditioning\nso\nwhat's wrong with the caste system so\ni'm not necessarily saying that the\nwhole ca uh\ni don't know enough about the cast\nsystem to say that it's blanketly wrong\num but i do believe that it is unfair\nso i think it's like unfair when some\npeople grow up and are in a situation\nwhere they like\nbasically are trapped\nright they don't have resources they\ndon't have education their parents\naren't educated their parents don't\nemphasize education their parents can't\nearn money\num\ni think that that's unfair\nlike i think it's unfair that some\npeople\nare born with so many advantages and\nlike\ni don't think that it's good for a\ncultural system\nto propagate inequality\nand my understanding of the caste system\nis that it does propagate inequality now\nif you say that the cul the caste system\ndoes not propagate inequality then i'll\naccept that because i'm not an expert in\nthe cast system i'm a psychiatrist i'm\nnot a sociologist i didn't grow up in\nindia\nright so i understand some stuff about\ncaste\nbut that's as a second generation\nimmigrant who grew up in east texas\nso if people are going to make arguments\nthat the caste system is good like by\nall means make those arguments and i'm\nhappy to listen i'm not saying i'm right\nit's just my opinion and it's not\nsomething i'm an expert in\nbut i do think it's like\ni think like how can i say this when i\nlook at the dull and that's why i\nmentored him right so like i tried to do\nwhat i could to like fix it\nwhich is gonna be like hey bro like\nlet me help you because\ni understand this stuff and i was given\nopportunities to learn\nso what i think that what i think is\nunfair is that i mean like we're not you\nknow we're not even playing in the same\ngame like it's like\nhe's playing on ping like a ping of 400\nand i'm playing on like a ping of 20 and\nwe're competing\nand you know medical schools are going\nto look at us\nnot the same because i think medical\nschools are you know people try they try\nto not they on the one hand they sort of\njudge people by the color of the skin\nbut on the other hand they also try to\nrecognize that like their socioeconomic\nstatus so i personally think that\nsocioeconomic status is is a better\nway to try to like balance things i\nthink it's just harder right\num but i i do think that i would like a\nworld where\nthe discrepancy between the advantages\nthat i was given and my dull at the\nmentee were given\nwere less i think i think it's unfair to\nhim and it's my understanding and this\ncould be wrong that a lot of that is\npropagated by cast\nand if you say otherwise then by all\nmeans\nyou know\ntell me i'm wrong and explain it to me\nif someone i would love if someone could\npost a little bit if you guys think that\nthe cast system is good\nand is helpful i'd love to see a\nsubreddit post about it\num so you said money is necessary but\nnot sufficient for happiness what is\nsufficient for happiness i think\ndetachment\nso\num devoting yourself to detachment is\nthe key to happiness\ni think that's what buddha basically\ndiscovered is that when people develop\ndetachment from expectations\nand focus on the present like so it's a\npresent focus\ndevoting yourself to the action in terms\nas opposed to the outcomes of your\nactions and detachment i think that's\nthe formula for happiness\nand i feel really confident about this\nbecause i've taken people who are\nmiserable and i've taught them this and\nthey become happier\nright so i'll get like ceos who are very\nrich and they'll come to me and they'll\nsay hey\ni'm unhappy can you help me and i'll say\nsure\nthey'll say i'm depressed then i'll talk\nto them i'll do a thorough diagnostic\ninterview where i ask them 60 questions\nthen i'll say you're not depressed\nyou're unhappy\nthey're like wait what what do i do\nabout that i'll be like let me show you\nindians are in tech and doctors because\ndecades of diligence standing on the\nshoulders of their parents sacrifices i\nagree completely\nright so i stand on the shoulders of my\nparents everything that i am is due to\ntheir sacrifice\nso i want you guys to understand like\npeople look at me like i'm something\namazing i want you all to understand\nthat i grew up in a household with two\nloving parents and i had the luxury of\nspending seven years training to become\na monk without having to really worry\nabout paying my bills\ndo you guys realize how op of a start\nthat is\nlike it's one of the most op starts you\ncan have\nand so it's my belief that if you're\nsomeone who's born with privilege\ni can still suffer by the way so i'd\nappreciate some compassion when time\nlife is rough for me\nbut i believe it is my responsibility to\nlike take my spawn and then like build\nalliances with other people who had less\nadvantageous spawns\nright because we're in this game\ntogether it's co-op so if i have a\nreally good spawn it's my job to help\npeople who like didn't have as good of a\nspawn to even things out because that's\nthe only way it's going to work\nactually that's not necessarily true\nit's my solution so i tend to focus on\nhelping people directly there are lots\nof people out there who will propose\npolitical solutions passing laws\nadvocacy all of those things are great\ntoo it's just not what i specialize in\nso i don't know how to get a law passed\nand it's my experience that you know\nsome of those systems like need\nimprovement and like the way the sausage\nis made is just too complicated so i\nprefer to just help i'm just going to\nmentor the bella kid instead of like\nlobby my congressman\nnot saying it's the right way it's just\nwhat i know how to do and it's how it's\nwhat i it's my advantage i didn't go to\nlaw school i went to med school\nso simple solution seems to be look at\nincome rather than ethnicity\nso\nhere's the thing if there was a simple\nsolution i think someone would have\nfigured it out so my experience of\nsolving inequality\nis that\na simple solution is not going to work\nright like if you really look at for\nexample like becoming healthy\nis not easy it's a multi-factorial\nsolution it involves exercise it\ninvolves diet it involves meditation it\nmay involve coaching it may involve\ntherapy it may involve watching youtube\nstreams it may involve having um\nyou know a yard where you can garden it\nmay involve having a pet\nright so having a pet correlates with\nlike increased life expectancy and\nbetter mental health\nso to say that\nthe solution to mental health problems\nis just to send everyone to therapy\nit may seem like a simple solution\nbecause that's the treatment for mental\nillness so like let's just send everyone\nto therapy i disagree\ni think the solution to mental illness\nmay involve therapy but it may also\ninvolve like\ngetting people pets if they want one\nimproving social connections helping\npeople get off of social media\num helping people exercise helping\npeople like support each other\nuh doing things like group coaching\nwhere like people can learn their value\ntheir internal sense of self-worth i\nthink that there's a lot of answers to\nit\nwhy is it not clearly wrong i assume\nyou're talking about the caste system\nthe short answer is i don't know\nlike i'm ignorant of the caste system\ni'm not an expert in the caste system so\ni know this sounds kind of weird\nbut i think a lot of people on the\ninternet will judge things that they\ndon't understand\nlike most people will judge things that\nthey don't understand so i've seen this\na lot like people will\nyou know this is done in kruger\n101. that the more ignorant you are of\nsomething the more simple it seems and\nthe quicker you are to like have an\nanswer\ni think honestly if you look at a\nwebsite like reddit or twitter what most\npeople should say is i don't know like\nif people were if you were actually if\nthe correlation between opinions and\nlike understanding things\nwas one in one 90 of twitter would be\npeople saying i don't know i don't know\ni don't know i don't know because most\npeople don't know things\nwe're happy to have opinions about\nthings\nit's the way our brain is wired our\nbrain is wired to construct the illusion\nof certainty out of ignorance that's\nwhat it does\nso the reason that i don't think it's\nclearly wrong is just because i don't\nunderstand it like i like i said i think\nit's wrong\nbut\ni haven't done a thorough study of the\ncaste system and its advantages we may\ndiscover that it has advantages\ni do think that there's a lot of stuff\nbetween eastern and western stuff where\nwestern people think that they are right\nwhereas i disagree with that so like a\ngood example of that is that\nin the west the individual is considered\nmore important than the community\nso for example like you'll have\npeople advising each other that if you\nhave\nit's like okay to cut off your parents\nand never allow them to see your kids\nbecause there's no such thing as\ngrandparents rights\nright and i understand that perspective\nlike i get it\nbut in the east they value the community\nover the individual and they do think\nthat there are things such as\ngrandparents rights\nand all of society or at least western\nsociety will think that like that is\nobjectively wrong that the parents\nrights supersede the grandparents rights\ni think it's just a difference of values\ni don't think it's objectively wrong\nit's also the side that i fall on right\nso i kind of agree with that but i think\nthat's a good example of like\nyou know i don't think that there's an\nobjective right or wrong there i think\ndifferent societies have different value\nsystems and i try my best to not assume\nthat the value systems that i hold are\nobjectively correct because overwhelming\nresearch demonstrates that for example\nmost of the real most of the humans in\nthe history of humanity do not believe\ntheir religion after a thorough and\ncritical analysis of all of the\nreligions and then picking one\nmost human beings believe their religion\nbecause that's what they were exposed to\nso human beings also confuse\nobjective correctness with the value\nsystem that they grew up in\nyou"
