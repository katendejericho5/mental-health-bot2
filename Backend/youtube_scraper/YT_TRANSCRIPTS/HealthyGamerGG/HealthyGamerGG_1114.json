    "transcript": "it's gonna be like i'd encourage you to\nlike sucker punch your client just a\nlittle bit more\neveryone this is coach isaac\nisaac this is everyone\num\nso you're feeling nervous\na little bit yeah yeah\ni you know\nyeah i think that's probably\nnormal\nyeah\nthank you so much for agreeing to do\nthis um i hope we'll have some fun i i\nthink you're gonna do great you know\nbecause i i've seen what your clients\nsay about you and what they say about\nyou is that you're great so i'm sure\nyou'll do fine\num and also you know i'm not going to go\neasy on you\nso um\nyou know i think let's let's kind of put\nyou through your paces\ni'm ready okay\nso i'm coming to my first\ncoaching session\nokay so we don't have to do the whole um\nyou know boundary spiel and things like\nthat but we can you know so you can skip\nthe\nyou know dm's\nlike all that kind of stuff\nyeah yeah\nbut so take it away man\nall right\nwelcome nice to meet you what do you\nwhat do you go by\num uh you can call me olok\noh look okay you can call me isaac so\nwhat how about we start off by talking a\nbit about what it is that brings you to\ncoaching\num so i saw uh\nlike dr k's\nlike i've seen his streams\nand um i think that like he's able to\nhelp people\nin\nlike a way that i'm kind of looking for\nand so\num\nyou know i was kind of hoping to talk to\nhim\nbut uh you know i guess that that's not\npossible\nyeah yeah so i i don't think dr k is\ntaking on any new clients as of late\nso yeah but i'm here\nyeah\num\nyeah\nso what were you looking to get help\nwith\num you know like so i have problems with\nlike confidence and self-esteem and\nthere are a lot of things that like i\nknow i should do\nbut\nyou know it's like hard like you know i\nkind of feel stuck\nokay\nyeah can you tell me what you mean by\nfeeling stuck\nwell like you know i i know that i\nshould be doing like particular things\nlike i know i should go to the gym and\nstuff\nlike i know that i need to like get in\nshape\num\nyou know i'm about\n10 to 20 pounds\nheavier than where i want to be\nokay um and so you know i need to like\nwork on that kind of stuff\ngotcha um\nand can you can you elaborate a bit on\nuh what you mean by confidence\nwell\nso i know that like confidence is\nimportant right so if you like approach\npeople and you're confident\nthen things go better for you\nbut\nand so i know like i should be confident\nbut it's just really hard for me to like\nbe confident so i'm i'm hoping like\nyou know like can you teach me how to be\nmore confident\nlike\ni can't teach you per se but we can like\ntalk through it and certainly try to\nunderstand it so like i don't i don't i\ndon't know you yet you know um so what\ncan you can you actually share with me\nlike what happens now when you approach\npeople because you said if you're\nconfident goes better for you how does\nit go now\nwell that's kind of the problem is that\ni don't really like approach people\nyou know so like i'm i'm a student i'm a\njunior\num you know at the beginning i thought\nthat like\nyou know if at the beginning i thought\nlike i'm just a freshman and like you\nknow i'll figure it out like everyone\nhas problems approaching people but like\ni'm a junior now um you know i don't\nreally like go to parties and stuff\num i don't really like hang out with\nother people\nand\nyou know\nyeah so so what i'm hearing is\na lot of the trouble you're having is\ncoming from a lack of self-esteem and\nconfidence and there's a lot of things\nyou should be doing know you should be\ndoing but aren't and so\nwhat i'm hearing now is you have trouble\nlike approaching people and and doing\nall these things that you sounds like\nfeel like you should be doing right\nyeah\nso so what\nwhat do you end up doing instead of all\nthese things that you should be doing\num i mean most of the time so like i i\ndo like okay in terms of my classes and\nstuff like not great like that too i\nshould be working you know i should be\nspending more time at the library and\nstuff\num\nbut\nreally i just you know i do i do get\nmost of my work done most of the time\nbut it's basically that and then like i\nspend time you know in my dorm room\num\nwhen i'm not doing that like i spend\nsome time gaming and stuff like that you\nknow spend a lot of time on youtube i\nlisten to a lot of podcasts\num\nyou know\nyeah so\nit might sound like a silly question and\nyou don't have to know the answer but\nwhat gets in the way of you going out\nand like meeting people or working out\ntrying to lose weight and all this stuff\nwell i mean i think it's that's what i\nwas kind of saying about like the\nconfidence thing like i just don't\nit's really hard for me to like\ndo that you know i don't i don't know\nlike where to start\nsure yeah\nso and when you say\nconfidence right i think you i asked\nearlier um\nyou're talking about how you like view\nyourself right\ni guess so\ncan you what do you mean by that\nwell actually i should just ask you\nbecause i'm forgetting now but what do\nyou mean when you say confidence\nwell just like you know confident people\ncan do things right and like if i'm\nconfident i'll be able to like go up to\nsomeone and like introduce myself um you\nknow if there's like like there's uh\nlike for example like a girl in my in\none of my classes\nand you know i'd love to get to know her\na little bit better but it's it's just\nreally hard like i'm pretty sure she's\ngot a boyfriend you know she's gotta\nhave a boyfriend\num and and she's like awesome and she's\nfunny and we're like into a lot of the\nsame things and she's like super cute\num but it's just like i just can't you\nknow like i really\nlike there's a part of me that wants to\nbut i also know like there's no point\nright because she's she's got a\nboyfriend so\nbut like\nyou know there's a part of me that\nsometimes wonders like what if she\ndoesn't you know\nokay so yeah so it sounds like\nconfidence is like a prerequisite to\ndoing all these things that you want to\ndo like it takes there's a threshold and\nyou're just you're not there yet right\num and it sounds like you're actually\npretty torn on\nwanting to\nto go up to this girl like on the one\nhand it's pointless because she probably\nhas a boyfriend but there's a tiny part\nof you that's like well what if right\nyeah i mean i like i'm pretty sure but\nyou know i also don't like\ntechnically know you know like i've\nnever asked her\nright so it seems like low odds\nyeah\nand so that's another big thing is you\nknow if if if something has like\na low likelihood of success like\nlogically i just know it's not a good\nuse of my time\nsure yeah\num\nand can you\naround when would you say how long have\nyou been struggling with this\ni mean honestly it feels like in a sense\nmy whole life like i'm never really and\ni think that's kind of part of the\nproblem is that\nyou know what i realized is that like\nwhen i was a freshman so i've been\nwatching a lot of like dr k streams and\nstuff and i realized that\nyou know by the time freshman year\nrolled around\nlike the people who made friends were\nthe ones who like knew how to talk to\npeople\nbut i kind of missed that boat\nin high school right so i didn't really\nknow how to talk to people in high\nschool and so\nlike every year that goes by it's like\nit's becoming like later and later\nand you know i'm just not sure how to\nfind that confidence now\nright so it seems like everyone else\nlike hits\nhad some\ninternal idea as to how to like do these\nsocial things and like hit these\nmilestones and then you didn't hit it\nwhen everyone else did and\nsince then it's kind of like you've been\ntrying to catch up but feeling stuck\nright\nyeah because like you know logically\nthere's no way that i can you know go\nback and do it over if i if i could i\nwould\nsure yeah\nso do you remember how you felt at that\ntime when everyone else seemed to be\nmaking friends and you\nweren't\ni mean i've always been like pretty good\nat controlling my emotions\nso i i kind of knew that you know\nlike i was okay i was okay with it like\ni sort of see now that it was sort of a\nproblem but back then it wasn't really\nlike\nyou know\ni wasn't gonna be like some edge lord\nyou know\nsure yeah what do you mean when you say\ncontrolling your emotions how do you\ncontrol them well so i've noticed that a\nlot of people are\nyou know they're not really in control\nof their emotions so they'll do things\nlike\nyou know they can't control it so\nthey'll they'll they'll like break down\nand stuff like that\nwhereas i've always been like really\ngood like i have a um\nlike i took an iq test and i'm like high\nup on the iq scale i also took a eq test\nfrom harvard business review and i'm\nsupe i'm high on that as well\nso i've got like\nyou know a really good\nunderstanding i know dr k emphasizes it\na lot too\nso\ni'm keeping him\nyeah so it sounds like you're really\non top of yourself right\nyeah\nemotionally so\nwhat emotions are you controlling\nexactly once\nwow that was a really good question\num\ni'd say mostly like\nthe lack of confidence\nis\nwhat i'm controlling i guess\nno i'm not quite sure\nthat sort of doesn't logically make\nsense\nhow so\nwell because like if i could control my\nlack of confidence like emotionally then\ni could do the things that\nyou know\ni should say i'm i can do\nbut that's what it sort of feels like i\nmean i feel like i you know i'm in\ncontrol\nbut\nthe main thing is like the lack of\nconfidence\nright so when\nwhen you say\ncontrol so you were comparing to like um\npeople that have like breakdowns and\nstuff right so it sounds like you don't\nlet the emotion get the best of you\nyeah\nexactly\nright so\ndoes that mean the emotion still comes\nup\nand then you control it\nwell yeah that's sort of what i mean is\nlike you know i don't let it get the\nbest of me so like you know i can\ncontrol it so\nyou know my frontal lobe\nis in control\nof my emotional circuitry\nso it doesn't just like you said like it\ndoesn't get the best of me\nokay\nyeah and and\nlike what you said was interesting is\nthat\nit seems like if you if you were\ncontrolling it then\nyou know\nit wouldn't be stopping you from doing\nall these things you want to do\nyeah i i get that i'm not quite sure\nyou know because i i do definitely feel\nin control of my emotions but i sort of\nlike acknowledge that\nyou know if i were in your shoes\ni would be thinking like oh this guy\nlike\nlike if he if he was better at\ncontrolling his emotions he like\nprobably wouldn't have all these\nproblems\nyou know\nsure yeah\num\nhow are you feeling as we're talking\nabout it\nwell i kind of feel like\nyou know\ni imagine like on some levels i'm like\nactually way better than your average\nclient but i imagine you're maybe\nthinking that\ni'm maybe not\nas\nyou know with it as some of your other\nclients are\nlike how would you say i rank compared\nto like some of the other people you\nwork with\num\nwhat what makes you curious about the\nother people i work with\ni don't know i'm just curious about it\nyou know\nlike i'm i want i want to you know like\nwhere do i fit in compared to like the\naverage person who comes here\nyeah what what would it mean if you were\nlike\nbelow average or above average the\nfor the people that come in and see me\nwell i guess what i'm trying to figure\nout is like whether this is a good fit\nyou know so like i'm a big fan of like\ndr k and the streams and stuff but like\nyou know i'm just trying to figure out\nif this is like if this is if this kind\nof stuff is like stuff that you can help\nme with or\nyou know\nor not kind of thing you know so i'm\nkind of curious about you know how other\npeople are\nyeah makes sense\nbefore i attempt to answer that though\nwhat what is it about the streams that\nyou like\nwell so i i like that you know people\nseem to have like roadblocks\nand and so like\nthey kind of overcome those roadblocks\nand then the other thing is there are a\ncouple of streams where like i can see\nat the end that people are like feeling\nmore confident\nand so i'm hoping that like by talking\nto you like at the end of this like i'll\nfeel more confident right go through\nthat process\nof building that confidence\nright yeah and then and then with that\nyou would be able to go and like start\nlosing weight and start talking to\npeople and all this stuff right yeah\nyeah\nexactly\nmakes sense\num\ni think i'm still a little\nstuck on\nlike\nthis piece about controlling\nthe emotions\nright like that seems like there's still\nsomething to figure out there\nyeah i mean i i can see that\nyou know so how do we figure it out\nit's a good question\num\nlet me think for a second\ncan you share is there anything from\nstreams in particular that's resonated\nwith you like particular interviews or\ninsights\nyeah i mean i think that there are i'm\nkind of curious though like i mean do\nyou think that this is something that\nyou could help me with or are you kind\nof thinking\nyou know like that maybe\nlike\nyou know this is not gonna work out\ni don't know\ni mean i think we've been talking for a\ntotal of\nlike 15 20 minutes\ni think i don't know enough about you\nyet to see\nlike\nwhere this is gonna go\nwhat do you think about that though\ni don't know i i sometimes feel like\ni'm not able to give you like the best\nanswers so i'm i'm a little bit worried\nthat\nyou know like you were kind of saying\nabout the control stuff like i see where\nyou're coming from like i should be able\nto give you a better answer about that\nand so one of the things that i'm kind\nof concerned about is that\nyou know on stream it's like\npeople like seem to understand their\nproblems really well\nbut i'm not so sure that\nyou know i'm gonna\nyou you seem actually like super smart\nand stuff like that too\num\nbut i'm just a little bit worried that\nlike i may not be able to give you kind\nof the answers that you need to help me\nand so what if i told you that\neverything you've told me so far\nhas been immensely helpful\nwell\ni mean like it's kind of your job to say\nthat right\nit's like what are you gonna do like\ntell me like everything you've told me\nis idiotic and a waste of our time\nfair right like you can't be entirely\nsure if i'm gonna be honest with you\nabout the quality of your answers makes\nsense um\nand i can see where you're coming from\nin regards of like yeah when you go on\nwhen you watch the streams it's like dr\nk is like talking to these people and\nthey're like answers it seems like\nthey're like getting somewhere and right\nnow we're like\nstuck on this one\npiece and can't seem to get past that\nright\nyeah yeah kind of yeah\nwell i like\ni'm curious\nwhat's happened in the past when you've\ntried to\nconfront this confidence issue\nwell like i mean something rather\nhe you know like kind of doesn't work\nout and and usually like i tend to screw\nthings up\nlike i i start out really strong and i i\nknow i'm capable of doing it\num it's just when it comes to like the\nimplementation phase so like\num\nyou know i\none of the one like so i'm i listen to a\nlot of podcasts and stuff and there's\nthis one guy who was talking about\nreading one book every day so i started\ndoing that\nbecause i can handle that\nand\nand you know so i read like one book a\nday\nand so i've learned a lot about\nconfidence and psychology and things\nlike that but when it comes to the\nactual like implementation phase\ni think it's just something falls apart\nlike i just kind of like basically\ndropped the ball\nyou know so it's like i've got all the\npieces\nto fix my problem but like something\njust\ni'm not sure what happens exactly\nyeah what's the implement implementation\nphase\nso like i was um you know i'll listen to\nlike\ntrp podcasts and stuff like that i've\ntaken a couple of classes on like pickup\nand that sort of thing\nand then you know i understand the\ntheory really well but when it actually\ncomes to like\napproaching women like either i kind of\nscrew it up or it doesn't really work or\nlike\nyou know it it just doesn't happen the\nway that you know people describe in the\nbooks\nright i see what you're saying now so so\nyou've got a ton of information at your\ndisposal you read a lot like you\nunderstand these things intellectually\nand then you go to try to act and then\nit's like something something screws up\nsomething doesn't happen\nbasically me right because like if the\ninformation's right and the theory's\nright\nand you know it doesn't work out like\nyou know what's the common variable\nsure yeah\nso\nwhat do you mean that it's\nit's basically you\nlike\nwhat what is you here\nwell like me like you know\nit sort of doesn't matter like you know\ni can try\nyou know\ngoing to a party and like\nyou know having a couple of drinks and\nthen there's also like you know\neveryone's been drinking so it's like\neverything should be easier socially but\nlike that doesn't really work out for me\nlike you know there may be girls in my\nclass and stuff and like i've got like a\nreason to talk to them right so like one\nof the things that i read is like any\ntime you're approaching a girl like you\nshould have some reason\nto talk to them\num\nand and so i've got that right so i've\ngot like like i'm gonna ask this girl\nlike hey do you want to study for this\ntest together or whatever\num and then there was one one girl that\nfor example was wearing like a t-shirt\num for an anime that i really liked\nand so i thought that would be like kind\nof an in but it just didn't and so like\nwhat's the common element like it's it's\nme right so i'm i'm not able to do\nyou know what i'm supposed to be able to\ndo\nyes it sounds like there's some\ncore thing here that's outside of the\nthe\npractical knowledge the the intellect\nthat's\nthat is like what you're describing as\nyou and like fundamentally there's\nsomething that you like that\ncan't be done here\nright now i mean that's why i'm coming\nhere because like you know this is\nbasically like you know i'm 21 years old\nlike this is my like last chance you\nknow\nwhat makes you say it's your last chance\nwell like you know most people you know\nthey like like date and stuff like in\ncollege and like once college ends like\nyou know\nit's gonna be hard\nand then like\nyou know if i if i have no experience or\nanything like that like\nyou know\nyeah so like\nlike when a girl asks me like how many\npeople i've been with and i say zero\nlike that doesn't\nyou know\nit's not gonna go well bro\nright yeah so\nsounds like there's another boat here\nthat you're worried about missing\nyeah yeah\nright that's\nand can you clarify for me\nlike so so there's\nyou and like the information are like\ntwo different things right so like you\nhaving all that information doesn't\ntranslate into things like the things\nyou want to do being done right yeah\nso what makes you keep like reading\ni don't know i mean i i guess because\nlike reading's like a good thing right\nlike\nlike i'm interested in growth\nand stuff\nso does does reading help you grow\ni mean i\nyeah i guess so right and isn't that\nwhat\nis that why people read\nso\nbenefit from like other people's\nknowledge and like\ngrow\ndo you feel like you've grown from\nreading\ni mean i feel like i understand a lot\nmore stuff\nand how is\nunderstanding stuff impacted you\nwell i mean that's kind of the problem\nright is it's like not translating\nright so i guess i get i mean i guess\nyou could make the argument that that's\nnot actually growth\nwhich is interesting i never really\nthought about it that way\nyeah so so what do you think about that\nthat it seems like you\nkeep on\nreading and trying to understand things\non an intellectual level and\nlike about all these things that you\nwant to with your life but\nthat doesn't change seem to change\nanything\nlike\nit seems like you know more and you\nunderstand like the theory behind a lot\nof things\nbut the things you want to do or get\ndone don't seem to be happening\nyeah i mean i i think that's actually a\nreally good\nlike that you know that's that's kind of\nlike why i'm stuck because i'm doing\neverything i'm supposed to be doing you\nknow\nlike what else could i do\nother than read and continue to\nunderstand\nyeah i mean\nyou know that that's that's sort of\nyou know i've tried it all\nlike\nyou know so it's sort of\ni've been working at this for a while\nand i'm a pretty smart guy so like i\nknow i've read a lot of stuff\num\nyou know so i it's not\nyeah is i mean so it like on the one\nhand\nit sounds like you feel like you've\ntried a lot of stuff and everything out\nthere\nbut there's\nthings that haven't been done\nright\nyeah like like what do you mean well\nearlier remember when i asked um\nlike what happens when you\ntry to approach people to talk to them\nright\nyour response i believe was that doesn't\nreally happen\nyeah yeah i mean that's yeah\nright so\nthe\nactually let's let's back up a little\nbit because i'm still\num\ncaught up in on the the piece about like\nthe learning the reading and stuff\nso\nhow does it feel when you\nread stuff about like talking to people\nor like like building relationships like\nlosing weight exercising all that stuff\ni feel like you know this is\nlike this is really going to help me\nright like this is what i like because\nyou gotta i got to do something about it\nyou know yeah\nand so\ni'm very growth oriented\nso\nwhen i see a problem i try to take like\ndefinitive action\nand so i'll take definitive action\nyou know i'll do research\ni'll you know\nlike look at like different reviews and\nstuff for different books and see like\nwhat's worked for other people and then\nlike i'll take definitive action\nand what kind of defensive action here\nlike finding the right high quality\nresearch\nand then so i'll read like the books and\nstuff like i've spent probably about two\nor three thousand dollars on different\nkinds of like\nsocial and behavioral and like dating\ncourses and things like that\nyou know so i can equip myself to be\nlike ready to\nyou know\nyes so sounds like it's a pretty good\nfeeling right because it feels like\nyou're growing like you're moving\ntowards the things you want\nyeah\nyou know\ni\ni mean there's also like\ni'm starting to lose a little bit of\nconfidence there too because like\nyou know because\nthere's a part of me that logically says\nlike it hasn't worked so i'm not quite\nsure and that's sort of what makes me\nfeel stuck and that's actually why i\nsigned up for this\nwhich part are you losing a little bit\nof confidence on\njust that you know you could like kind\nof like what you're saying is like\nyou're kind of saying that like reading\nis a waste of my time right\ndid i\ni mean that's what you're saying right\nlike you're not saying it playing out\nbut you're kind of saying like reading's\nlike a waste of my time and i'm like not\napproaching the problem correctly\nand that what i just need to do is like\njust like talk to girls\nyeah i mean so so what i've been hearing\nfrom you is that and what i'm you know\ntrying to\nunpack and understand is that the\nlike you can like\nyou're this really smart dude right like\nyou understand a lot like you read a lot\nall this stuff you have all this\ninformation at your disposal\nyet there's some\nintermediate step between\nlike the information all that stuff and\nlike the things you want in your life\nright so it yeah\nthe way i'm kind of hearing it is that\nthere's more to the like puzzle here\nthan just the into\nthe\ninformation\nyeah i mean i think so\nyeah so\nit seems like we want to try to figure\nout what that is\nyeah aren't you saying that that's me\nyou said that was you\nwell like don't you think i mean like\nthat's that's logical right like i'm the\ncomet like i'm at the end of the day i'm\nreading a thousand books and i'm not\nactually like talking to any girls\nyeah i can see where you're coming from\ni don't know if i necessarily agree that\nit's like you\nwhat else could it be\nlike\nthe phases\npart of it part of the the issue here\nright is you know if we if we want to\nlike take a step back and\nlook at the whole picture here is that\nlike ice like when when\nwhen we say it's like the problem is\nlike you\nthat doesn't have like a clear i don't\nget i don't have a clear idea of what\nthat actually means or is\nright\nlike it sounds like the way we're\ntalking about makes it feel like some\nlike core components like your essence\nor something\nthat is unlike changeable\nyou know i mean\nyeah i mean i think i think you like\nthat was pretty good i think you kind of\nfigured it out right like there's\nsomething\nit's like a\nit's good\ni can i can\nyeah\nwhat do you mean it's good like that's\nthat's my problem like that's what i\nneed to change is like because\nsomething's like busted\nlike fundamentally\nsomething's busted or you're busted\nwell like that i mean it's gotta be me\nright because i'm telling you like i've\ngot a high iq i've got a high eq i read\na lot i'm growth oriented\nand so like i've got all of these\nadvantages and i really should not be\nhaving these problems\nare all those things not part of you as\nwell\nwell yeah but i mean those things are\nlike\nthat's kind of what i'm saying is i like\ni want to fix that thing that's like\nkind of screwed up right\nyeah\nso\nlet me think for a sec\nsorry just lagged\nyeah where you're fine\num\nwhen did you start\nbelieving that like you were the\nfundamental problem here\ni mean i always knew that things were\nkind of off like\never since i was a kid\nyou know like\nlike\ni got made fun of a lot\ngrowing up\nyou know\nlike\nand i remember like\ncomplaining to my parents about it and\nmy dad was like that's just life\nyou know\nand\nsort of like\nif the kids treat you a particular way\nit's because of like so he was like big\ninto\ntaking control of your life\nhe was a motivational speaker actually\nand a pastor\nand\nso he was like\nyou know he explained to me that if if\nsome you know\nyou can whine about what your situation\nis or you can do something about it\nand so he kind of explained to me that\nlike\nyou know if the kids are making fun of\nyou like that's something that you can\nyou know\nit's in your control to change that so\nhow you respond to that\nwhat they say\nyou know it's kind of like you gotta\nsort of man up and deal with that right\nlike what are you gonna do like cry\nabout it\nyeah so so it sounds\nlike your dad\nyour dad kind of taught you that it's\nlike your responsibility and it's your\njob to\nfix the things that\nlike other kids are like bullying you\nfor right yeah i mean\nso he was also like when my parents got\ndivorced he was kind of explaining to me\nthat you know when i was at my mom's\nplace like i would have to be the man of\nthe house\nyou know that like i had to like take\ncare of things\nyou know that's like\nyeah\nwhat was it like hearing all that as a\nkid\ni mean i think it was it really helped\nme like understand that\nyou know it was like really empowering\nbecause like i started to like really\nrealize that like i'm in control of my\ndestiny\nyou know\nand that you can't really\nyou can't control other people's actions\nso you have to like behave in a\nparticular way so that like they don't\ntreat you a particular way\nlike no one's going to give you a free\npass in life\nyeah and so\ncan you tell me more about the bullying\nlike what happened when you\nand your dad taught you all that\nwell i mean so that you know this is\nkind of what i was saying is like\nyou know that's true right so he was\nlike\nlike like thousands of people looked up\nto him\nyou know when he taught\nthe room was absolutely packed\nand\nhe you know his\nhis support and his teach\nhelped so many people\nand there was something that where you\nknow like\ni would try to do what he told me to do\nbut like it never worked out the same\nway\nright so i i you know i stood up to the\nbullies and they just like bullied me\nworse and like i couldn't\nyou know i couldn't get them to change\nso\nso you\nthat was the time you were able to take\naction right\num\nyeah yeah\nand\nwhat ended up happening\ni mean i didn't do it well enough right\nso like i was supposed to really like be\nconfident and stuff like that and stand\nup to them and like\ni guess they like knew on some level\nthat\nit was sort of like a game of chicken i\nguess\nwhere you know like\ni'm kind of getting up in their face and\nthey're getting up in my face but like\nthey knew they were really confident and\ni wasn't so i kind of backed down first\nand they just like\nyou know and then they knew i was a\n so then it was like game over\nokay um\nyeah so so it sounds like you stopped um\nlike trying to like face them right\nyeah\nand then what was it like for you after\nyou\nstopped\ni mean it wasn't pretty\nyou know\nlike\nlike because that's the thing right so\nwhen you look at\nresearch on like alpha wolves and beta\nwolves and things like that like once\nthere's\na dominant\nonce there's a dominant\nonce there's a dominant dominance\nhierarchy that's been exerted like\nyou just stay at the\nbottom um\nsorry ask you're doing great\nuh yeah so so\nyou've been stuck at the bottom ever\nsince yeah\nnice\num\nthat's what it feels like yeah\nthat's the thing right so i just don't\nknow how to get back to the top\nsure\nso does your does your dad's like\nteaching no longer apply or how does\nthat fit in now\nwell\ni mean i i think it it still applies\nright because like\nyou know the world is what you make of\nit\num\nbut to be honest it's been a while since\ni've seen my dad i'm not you know so i\nhaven't like really talked to him much\nabout this stuff\ncan you can you tell me a bit more about\nthat your relationship with your dad\nwell so what happened i mean so\nbasically what happened is like they got\ndivorced\num i think i was like nine at the time\nand then like i was saying like he's\nlike a really successful like\nmotivational speaker and so um\nyou know there were like tons of people\ncoming to him and things like that and\nso he like his like career really like\nyou know\nlike really resonated with a lot of\npeople\nand really picked up\nand then sort of like he started\ntraveling and giving talks and stuff\nlike that and then\nover time like actually\nmy mom just took full custody\num\nand then at some point i think he\ngot remarried\num and he's got two other kids now\nand so we're not really in touch as much\nokay\nhow do you feel about that\ni mean\nyou know on the one hand it's not great\non the other hand like i don't blame him\nright because\nyou know\nlife is what you make of it and he\nyou know he had a good opportunity and\nhe seized it\nand he like built a really good life for\nhimself\nso that's that's sort of like what i\nneed to do with my life\nsure yeah\nso\ni'm gonna ask the question again\nhow do you feel about\nyour dad kind of\ngoing and pursuing this other life and\nno longer interacting with you very much\ni mean that's just the way the world\nright it's like\nyou know\nthere's a dominance hierarchy and he's\nlike he's at the top so he's gonna\nyou know\nlike he's a dominant figure\nokay so\nremember earlier when we were talking\nabout how you're pretty in control of\nyour emotions yeah\nright so are there\nemotions here that you're\nlike in control of\nyeah i mean sort of\nhow's it\nwell i mean i just feel kind of weird\nlike right now like i don't know why\nwe're talking about this\ni don't know how you know it just feels\nlike\nwe're wasting time\nokay wait\nit just feels weird\nwhat what do you mean by weird\nwhat's weird mean\ni don't know it just feels like\ni don't know why you're asking me like\nall these questions\nlike\ni feel like you're trying to\nget something out of me\nyou know\nlike\nyeah what does it feel like i'm trying\nto get out of you\ni don't know that like you're gonna say\nlike my dad has like abandoned me and so\nlike i'm not confident or something like\nthat\nwell what makes you think i was gonna i\nwas thinking that or was trying to well\ni mean that's sort of like what the\nstory sort of implies right like\nlike here he is and he's got like shiny\nnew wife and shiny new kids and there's\nlike me and mom and\ni've read a lot of textbooks on\npsychology like i know how it works\nright\nand does that have any\ndo you think any of that applies to you\ni mean\ntheoretically yes like actually like\ni don't know\nand so\nin theory\nwhat what effect would all that have on\nyou\ni mean\nyou know i'd probably have like problems\nwith like mentor figures or like male\nfigures or things like that right i\ncould project a lot\num\nyou know\ni would probably have some kind of like\nabandonment insecurity\nor something like that\nand so and you're not sure if any of\nthat applies to you\nwell i mean i don't know if how i'm\nsupposed to\nbe afraid of abandoning if i can't get\ninto a relationship to begin with\ndo you think that can have any impact on\ngetting into a relationship\ni mean i guess\nlike\ni guess it could you know\nlike i guess if i was afraid of being\nabandoned like it would make it\nyou know hard for me to like trust\npeople and things like that\ndo you have problem do you have problems\ntrusting people\ni mean that's what i'm sort of saying is\nthat\nyou know like i can't get to that point\nwith people to begin with\nright\num\nyeah so it it sounds like like what's\nhappening is\nor at least you know as we're talking\nlike we're talking a lot about a lot of\nstuff that could\ntheoretically apply to you but it\ndoesn't seem like things are quite\nlanding with you like a lot of things\nare\ni guess it could be right but\nit doesn't seem like you really feel\nlike they apply to you\ncorrect me from honda\nyeah i mean you know i gotta be honest\nnow that i'm really thinking about it\nlike i do wonder if some of this stuff\napplies to me\num\nyou know i i i think it's worth thinking\nabout\nlike\nyou know i think a lot of what you're\nsaying could make\nsense um\ni mean i think it sort of makes sense\nthat\nyou know if my dad like abandoned me or\nwhatever like\ni could have confidence issues or things\nlike that\num\ni guess i had never really thought about\ni'd always thought like the abandonment\nissue like wasn't a thing because\nyou know\nonce i like i thought it would like that\nwould like manifest if i was like in a\nrelationship so but i never really get\nthere to begin with\num i also wonder a little bit about\nyou know what you're kind of saying\nabout controlling emotions and sort of\nlike this black box of like what is me\nyou know it feels like like like there's\nlike a black box right we don't know\nlike what's in that black box\num\nbut i think that that's like the problem\nthat we don't know what's in the black\nbox yeah or or that the black box is\nlike why stuff doesn't work out the way\nit's supposed to\nah okay\nyeah and and then\nto to add on to that do you remember\nearlier when we were talking about\nlike\nthis\ncore sort of fundamental thing\nyeah\nright\nit sounds like um\nit sounds like\nsome of these things that you've sort of\ntalked about in theory like the the like\nthe black box that you mentioned and\nlike this\nfundamental like you like problem with\nyou that's\nfactoring into the equation here and not\nallowing for the stuff that you want to\nget done in your life has some\nconnection to this like like i've heard\nlike trust issues\num abandonment things like that right\nyeah maybe yeah\nso yeah does it feel like that stuff is\nlike the missing link here\ni mean sort of like i can see how it's\nsort of related but like i'm kind of\nsaying like what i need to work on is\nlike the approach\nyou know\nlike i think all that stuff probably\ncomes afterward\nwhat makes you think it comes afterward\nand not well because it like applies to\nrelationships like logically right\nsure\nlike you can't you can't get abandoned\nif you're single\nyeah exactly right\nwhat what do you mean by that\nyou can't so so\nwell let me back up a bit\nnope back\njust go\nyeah so you're saying they're\nlike abandonment issues that could\naffect your ability to like trust people\nin a relationship right yeah\nbut you feel like that's only that can\nonly happen once you're already in a\nrelationship right\nyeah obviously is it\nwell what what makes you say obviously\nwell like because you can't get\nabandoned if you're single\nright so\nis it possible though that\nthe\nthose like issues with abandonment and\nnot trusting people\nare what keeps you single\nwhat do you mean by that\nright because\nyou have trouble\nand we haven't really broken down like\nthe like play-by-play of like what\nhappens in your head and emotionally\nwhen you like think about going and\ntalking people um\nbut\nlike that's part of the the equation\nright\nyeah like it seems like\nthat's one of the things that could\nprevent you from going and talking to\npeople\nwait are you are you saying that like\nit's hard for me to like approach people\nbecause if i'm single i never have to\nworry about abandonment\ni yeah i'm asking like what you think\nabout that idea if you feel like it\ncould be\ni mean i've never thought about it that\nway but it's kind of interesting\nwhat's interesting\njust that\nyou know i'd always thought that it like\nso you know dr k talks about like\nprotective mechanisms\nand i never sort of thought about\nlike the anxiety that i feel like\nand what makes it like hard for me to\ntalk to girls is being like\nyou know because i'm sort of like not\nplaying the game right so if i'm not\nplaying the game like i can't lose\nyeah\ncan you elaborate on the anxiety that\nyou feel\nwell just that like you know\nbecause like what if she says no right\nthen i'm going to look like a dumb ass\nand she's probably gonna say no because\ni don't know how to talk to her\nso it's sort of like\nyou know there's no point in trying\nand so so what do you\nwhat are you\nreferring to when you say anxiety what\nmakes you call that anxiety so isaac\nlet's pause here right because we're at\n50 minutes so like why don't you try to\nformulate\nthe client so like to wrap up right so\nlike think about this as\nyou don't know if he's gonna come next\nweek or not right\nso what are you gonna say to him in the\nlast five minutes so try try to\nformulate a little bit\nmore just because people are watching\nso i'd say like for the last you know\nfive minutes like try to explain to this\nperson like what you think could be\ngoing on\nokay\nwhat's your understanding of them and\nmaybe even how to move forward\nyeah so\nlike the the\npresentation of like the issues i've\nheard are that you have trouble um\ndoing all these things that you want to\ndo\nright and you understand them all very\nlike intellectually on a um\num\non an abstract like idea level but then\nthere's trouble like acting right and\njust towards the end there we're getting\ninto like the emotions that into things\nright and so\nit sounded like there was some stuff\nfrom\nchildhood like with his dad and stuff\nthat taught him like\nto not act like with the bullies like he\ntried to go and act you tried to\nwhatever tried to go and act\num and then that didn't work out and it\nsounds like some like kind of like\nlearned hopelessness type stuff right\nso like there was\nwhat i'm\nhow i'm understanding it is that there's\nlike hopelessness baked in early on and\nthat's like a core emotional component\nthat's preventing\num\naction in the present right\ngreat\ni thought you did a fantastic so for\nwhat it's worth i didn't have that in my\nmind when we started off\nokay i didn't think so\nand i think you just kind of uncovered\nit and i kind of made up random answers\nas we were going along but i thought you\ndid a fantastic job um especially like\nyou know i was not easy\nso\ni imagine that i was being purposely\nlike more difficult to deal with than\nmost of our actual clients\nyeah you knew exactly what makes someone\ndifficult\nand you did a fantastic man you did\nreally good\num so i was i you know usually people\nare like we get to stuff way easier than\nthat but\nyeah i'm curious where do you think were\nareas to like harp on or that i should\nhave harped on more or like backed off\nearlier\nif any um so i think you did a\ngood job in general because i was trying\nto be difficult right like i was trying\nlike i was fighting you for like each\n useful answer\num i was going into litany's that was\njust a waste of your time\nright\nand so\num so you did a really good job i also\nlike challenged you like tried\nto trap you right ask you challenging\nquestions how do i compare to your like\nall discussions that are like\na waste of everyone's time\nand and you really you were a nice\nslippery fish and got to where you\nneeded to go so i thought she did really\ngood and i was like actively trying to\nsabotage this\ncoaching session\nyeah\nso i think you did really good there i\nthink a couple of things that i would\nencourage you to do\nis uh this is just in general especially\nfor like the more veteran coaches like\nyourself i would encourage you all to\nlike share more thoughts\nokay\num so i think you were asking a lot of\ngood open-ended questions and stuff like\nthat um but i would you know especially\nif there's someone who's alexa thymic\nwhich i'm pretty sure you figured out\nright so like once you know that they're\nlexa-thymic like asking open-ended\nquestions about emotions is gonna be\nsort of you may just like it'll make the\nsession feel unproductive\nso i think when you kind of got to the\ndad's story and things like that like if\nyou kept asking you know there would\nhave been like other situations\nwhere\ni tried to fix my life and like it\ndidn't work out for me you could ask me\nabout my mom and there would have been\nstuff there right so there's like like\nyou kind of said learned hopelessness\nearly on this whole thing of like it's\nnot worth trying\nbecause i'm gonna fail\nso\ni would also ask you know i would i\nwould\nso i would say you know share more of\nwhat you think\nyou did a good job of sort of saying i'm\nhearing but i felt like there was like\nyou could just formulate a little bit or\nlike give me something you were just\nencapsulating what i was saying but like\nyou could say\nyou know\ni you know if you're detecting that\nlearned hopelessness\nyou know i would say something like\ndo you know so i'm hearing that\nsometimes it's not even worth trying\nbecause the chances of likelihood or low\nright\nyeah and then then i would kind of laugh\nand say well no wonder you're stuck\nbecause it's not it's not worth trying\nyou know like that's like it's just a\ntiny little\nyou know like you can connect those dots\na little bit because i think i think you\nknow\nso i just share that right and and you\ngot to be careful you have to look at\nhow they respond to that they may take\nit off you know they may be offended and\nthings so i think you were really gentle\nwhich you needed to be\nbut i think the big feedback for all\ny'all veteran coaches is y'all\nunderstand way more\nthan\nyou let on with the clients\nso yeah i guess\none concern i had was like playing into\nlike the over into intellectualizing and\nlike presenting like ideas and stuff\nthat he's like like i think someone like\nthis would really latch on to and like\ntry to run with um\nwhich may or may not be counter or\ncounter productive no so that's that's\nright so that so if you had done that i\nwould have taken you for an intellectual\nright so there's a big difference\nbetween explaining in a complicated way\nthe theory of how this person's mind\nworks because then you're because\nhe's gonna like debate with you and all\nthat kind of stuff so but there's a\ndifference between that kind of long\nexplanation and an affectively charged\nemotionally charged little statement\nthat you tack on\nright okay right so there's like a\ndifference between saying hey like oh\nyou have like a learned hopelessness and\nlearned hopelessness makes it hard for\nyou blah blah blah like don't worry\nabout that it's like oh so like it's not\nworth trying because chances are you're\ngonna fail well no wonder you don't have\never ask anyone out\nright there's you can't intellectually\nengage with that but you're gonna it's\ngonna be like i'd encourage you to like\nsucker punch your client just a little\nbit more\nand that's kind of weird but just let\nyou know let them have it like be\nauthentic with them if you really see a\nproblem it's like yeah i can see that\nyou know you're kind of paralyzed\nbecause\nit seems like\ntrying is a waste of your time and\nyou're going to fail anyway so why\nbother\nno wonder it's hard for you\nright so you can formulate a little bit\nand just\nlet them have it a little bit more\nespecially with people who are like\nhyper intellectualized like a good\nemotionally charged\nlike statement that's kind of like a\npunch to the gut you've got to be\ncareful so i i'm glad you were gentle\nbut then you'll see affectively how they\nrespond right you do tiny little one you\nalways apologize\nif they're offended\nokay yeah\nmakes sense\nyeah trust yourselves more you guys are\ngood\nyeah i was i was really excited towards\nthe end when you finally used an emotion\nlike settings\nyeah so so that's where you know if\ni i would you know from a time\nmanagement standpoint\ni would open that up next time because\nyou are really doing really good on sort\nof like the learned hopelessness and the\nstuckness and pointing out to him that\nthere's like you could also explore\nwhat it feels like to be like\nfundamentally busted\nyou know because that that will get\nemotions that'll get affect\nlike if you ask him like do you feel\nlike no matter what you do you're gonna\njust be screwed no matter what\nand that despite because it's kind of if\nyou think about you know how broken this\nperson must feel\nthe more books he reads\nand the more money he spends on all\nthese solutions that work for other\npeople\nand if it doesn't work what does that\nmean about how broken he is\nyeah yeah\ncan you articulate for the stream i know\ni'm putting you on the spot\nrepeat the question so so\nif if i do a lot of i know i'm kind of\nputting you on the spot but so if if i\ndo if i read a lot of books and it still\ndoesn't work what does that mean about\nhow busted i am\neven more busted exactly right so what's\nhappening with this guy is the more that\nhe tries\nthe more broken he feels\nand the more he invests in fixing his\nlife\nand the less his life because you\nfigured it out early on that you even\npointed out so that's something that i\ndidn't give it to you but over time you\nyou actually won a lot of points there\nwhen you were like it sounds like you're\nreading a lot but it doesn't\nhelp\nright so that's actually a huge win in\nthe session\nwhich over time so when we see\nbehavioral change in our clients\nthose kinds of things they don't the\nlight bulb doesn't go off then but like\nyou've teed him up to act more\nexperiment more and read less with that\nthing even though i'm not going to say\nit to you because they're not going to\nrealize it in the moment but we like\nmove their you know this is why like six\nweeks in seven weeks eight weeks in\nclients just start changing right they\nstart like behaving differently they\nbreak out of their old patterns and it's\nnot like they have this moment of like\nlight bulb and then they wake up the\nnext day it's like a slow chipping away\nat their like conceptions about the\nworld that allows them to act in a new\nway so that was really good\nyeah okay gotcha gotcha yeah\ngood job man\nreally good job that was brutal\nyeah i i know i wasn't i wasn't easy on\nyou but i thought you did really really\ngood\num and and i think you also showcased\ndespite the fact that it was like\nartificial and hard and you know i\ncouldn't help but break character a\ncouple of times i think that\nfor anyone that was watching isaac is\nactually far smoother and even better\nthan what y'all saw here today\nso good job man any questions for me and\nanything you want to share about this\nexperience\nyeah actually um\ndo you\nmaybe you could talk a little bit about\nhow people should like interpret like\nwhat they saw here and like how this\nlike this session um this role-playing\nshould fact like ought to factor into\ntheir decision to get coaching or not to\nget coaching because i imagine a lot of\npeople are using it like that you know\nyeah\nso the first thing is that\num\nso the first thing that i think we\nwanted to kind of showcase is just how\ngood y'all are\nso like a lot of people think that\num\nyou know the the understanding of the\nmind that we showcase on stream or that\ni share with people\nis like only my own\nbut and and y'all aren't i also trapped\nyou you know tossed you a landmine early\non in terms of like oh you know like\nwhen do i get to talk to dr k or\nwhatever so i i think the cool thing is\nthat\nthat what we do on stream can be taught\nand i think isaac you've understood it\nreally well because you figured this\nclient out like relatively quickly and\nfor those of you that are you know\ncurious like we get these kinds of\nclients a lot clients who hyper\nintellectualize clients who don't aren't\nin touch with their emotions clients who\ndespite their their best efforts remain\nstuck\num\nso i tried to tap into a lot of\ndifferent\nthings that we see\nso i think the other thing to to\nrecognize uh from this role play is that\nfirst of all it's not as awkward or\ndifficult\nit's actually like a lot smoother when\nyou're actually talking to a person\num whereas i was actively trying to make\nisaac's life harder and and you know i\nthink\nisaac gets you know works really well\nwith a lot of our clients and that's\nbecause their clients aren't trying to\nmake his life difficult\nthe next thing to kind of take away is\nthat i think it's a good example of like\nthere isn't necessarily emotional\ncatharsis\num which i\nyou know but that doesn't mean that\nthere isn't change\nand that change sort of happens\nlike i don't know if you guys could kind\nof tell but there were some statements\nthat i made where like isaac pointed out\nto me like how my thinking was flawed\nlike reading doesn't actually help you\nknow that there's something fundamental\nbroken in me and that tease us up\nfor exploring okay how do you feel\nfundamentally broken are you actually\nfundamentally broken because no amount\nof books that i read will ever give me\nan opportunity to understand how i\nmyself was shattered by like whatever\nexperiences i grew up with\nright so and as i actually the problem\nis that this person is looking for\nanswers from like external sources\ninstead of understanding themselves and\nas i start to understand myself like the\nanxiety will get better i'll be able to\nact more whatever like you'll figure\nyourself out you know i'll stop reading\nbooks and spend maybe more time like\nmeditating or whatever so i i think that\nlike the key thing is that you know this\nis in a sense a good example of like\nshowing you know how a coach can even\nwith a really difficult client like\nunpack things relatively easily and\nstart the process of changing the way\nthat they view the world and understand\nthemselves which is really all\neverything that coaching is about\nso that's what i'd say people should\ntake away\nyou"
