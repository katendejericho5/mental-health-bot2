    "transcript": "so today we're it's going to be a\nwhirlwind\nall right so\nfirst thing that we're going to do is\ntalk a little bit about what we've\ncovered so far so on day one we\nwent through an introduction right what\nis coaching what is therapy and how do\nwe understand uh\nwhat gets in the way of our clients\nachieving their goals on the screen\nshare with y'all\nthere we go\nand so what we kind of came to is this\nyou know diagram of this is their intent\nthis is the resistance they have to\novercome\nand then once they overcome their\nresistance they're prone to take action\nand so on day one we sort of went over\nan overview of this model\nand the key takeaways from the overview\nof this model are that the reason that\npeople can't find motivation is because\nthey kind of you they use one term oh\ni'm unmotivated right\nbut the truth is that motivation\ninvolves a number of different\nphysiologic psychologic\nneuroscientific spiritual behavioral\neconomics there are lots of different\ndisciplines that look that go into what\nmotivation is and the reason people stay\nstuck is because they don't have the\nprecision to figure out where is my\nproblem is it a problem of intent am i\nnot like do i not really want it or am i\nconflicted am i ambivalent is there a\npart of me that should get up at 8 am\nevery day but there's a part of me that\nwants to stay up till 4 a.m every day so\nthat internal conflict makes their\nintent kind of scrambled so they can't\nreally act\nis the problem resistance so even if i\nreally want to do something and my best\nexample of this is people who are like\nvery very lonely so people who are very\nvery lonely will want to make friends\nwill want to find a romantic partner\nwill want all of these things and their\nintent is a hundred percent they want it\nmore than anything else in the world and\nyet they still can't do it so if we kind\nof diagnose that person's motivational\nproblem what we'll probably uncover is\nthat there's resistance there's some\namount of shame that they experience\nsome amount of identity problems that\nthey have so if we kind of talk about\nresistance you know there's two\ncomponents to it there's like emotions\nand identity there are other things as\nwell but that's kind of how we break it\nup\nand so how can you as a coach even if\ntheir intent is fully clarified how can\nyou help them overcome their resistance\nand so today we're going to kind of talk\nabout i think the nuts and bolts of what\nmost people expect from like goal\nsetting and motivation which is the\naction and the key point here is that a\nlot of people come in and they like want\nto jump right towards their goals but\nit's been my experience and hopefully\nyou all have seen this too i'm pretty\nsure y'all have\nthat people who focus on the action\nright away without focusing on the\nobstacle and the energy going into their\ntheir goals\nare the ones that\ntend to get blindsided and feel stuck\nbecause they're like oh i know what i\nneed to do but i can't bring myself to\ndo it and then they go and keep on\nlooking for magical solutions to their\nproblems\nbut they don't need a magical solution\nwhat they need to do is fix the problem\nto begin with right they need to remove\nthe resistance they need to remove the\nobstacles\nso now what we're going to focus on is\nactually how to set an appropriate\naction and how to help your clients like\nsucceed in the goals that they set\nand today we're going to cover four\nthings we're going to talk about setting\na goal we're going to talk about science\na little bit and evidence-based or\nscientifically valid validated\num points or like understandings that\nwill help your clients achieve their\ngoals\nso there are lots of different\npsychological principles and other\nthings at play that we can kind of\nleverage to optimize a client actually\nachieving their goal then we're going to\ntalk about troubleshooting goals and\nthen the last thing that we're going to\ntalk about is give you all a good solid\ncognitive framework to think about the\ndimensions\nof a goal so that you can try to figure\nout where a problem within a goal exists\nquestions\nokay so let's jump in\nso\nsetting a goal\nhow do most clients set goals\nthey look at what other people are doing\nvery good right so monkey see monkey do\nwhat else\nthey have a desire to sort of achieve\nsomething\nokay\nso let's say that that my\nso uh\ngoal is based on achievement right\nis that fair to say kent\nyep\nso i know this sounds kind of weird but\nlike when we use the word goal\nlike what we're kind of focusing on is\nlike the end of the road the achievement\nright so like if i have a goal like\nwhat's like a goal is like i want to\nbecome an olympic gold medalist\nthat's the achievement right most of the\ntime when our clients think about like\ngoals they set it based on the target so\nit's like a target focus fair\nend of the road\nwhere else where do you think goals go\nwhat else like where else do your\nclients goals come from any other ideas\nsometimes there are consequences of\ntheir current behavior and they want to\nchange it\nbut what do you mean by that eli\num like i guess sometimes like i have a\nfew clients who maybe want to lose\nweight because of you know what it's\nlike to be physically active and so they\nlike set a goal\nto\nbe more fit\ncan you help me understand how they\ndecided to set the goal to be more fit\ni guess the adult to you last point\nwould it be like\nreaching like a certain like emotional\nfeeling like happiness\nokay so sometimes they're chasing\na feeling\nor there's like a correlation with their\ngoal like\nthat's that's kind of a good point so\nlike\ni think that if i get promoted i will be\nhappy\nis that a good way to put it\nif i'm\nyou know all of my life would be better\nif i got\njaw surgery and made my jaw extend\nfurther from my face and then i could be\na strong john male\nright\nso like they're sort of their goal\ncorrelates with\nsome what's actually their goal\ncorrelates with their values but it's\nnot directly chasing the value it's like\nchasing some approximation of the value\nit's an excellent point\nokay\nso the the i think the key thing here is\nthat a lot of clients will set goals\nbased on what they see other people do\num you know what that target is and they\nmay even attribute some inappropriate\nthings to that target so this is like\ngrass is greener on the other side\nright so the first thing that i kind of\nwant to point out is that like\ngoal setting is not a systematic or\nthought out process it's not methodical\nat all it's just sort of like they wake\nup one day and they're like oh this is\nwhat i should do\nright and all of the the societal\nconditioning and stuff kind of comes in\nso first thing that we can help people\ndo in terms of coaching is to set an\nappropriate goal we can actually\nset like use a systematic process to set\nthe right kinds of goals for the for our\nclients and help them achieve it\nand our first kind of\napproach to setting a goal\nis the 25 rule\nand so what we kind of say is here's\nwhere our clients are\nhere's where they want to go so here's\nthe goal\nand so what clients try to do is they\ntry to think okay how do i get from here\nto here which makes perfect sense that's\nthe nature of a goal right if this is\nlike olympic gold medal\nlike of course\nthey're gonna think about how do i get\nto an olympic gold medal\nbut the problem is that this actually\nthis approach\ndoes not scientifically kind of set us\nup for success so the first thing that\nwe're gonna do is we're gonna ask them\nokay between where you are and where you\nwant to go\nwhat's the halfway point between that\nand then what's the halfway point\nbetween that and this is usually the\nfirst general target that we want to set\nand there are a lot of things that we're\nengaging by doing this process\nthe first is that our brain has this\ncircuit that sort of you know measures\nprogress towards something\nand it's it's able to tell that like\nokay if i if i work out today\nhow close am i to achieving my goal not\nvery close at all and so when the gap\nbetween what i'm capable of\nand what i want to achieve\nis wide\nit decreases motivation\nright so i'm curious\ndo any of y'all like want to be\npresident of the united states\nlike who thinks it would be cool to be\npresident\ni think it would be pretty cool\nright so like why don't you strive for\nit every day brian\nthat's really hard and very abstract\nabsolutely right so what we see is that\nthe gap between what you're what you\nbelieve you're capable of or what you\nthe actions you can take and what you\nwant to achieve actually decreases\nmotivation so the first thing that we're\ngoing to do is like shrink the goal like\nto the first target so there's also like\npositive psychology and things like that\nthat are involved here so when we shrink\nthe first target you know we increase\nthe likelihood of positive reinforcement\nright we kind of open our ourselves up\nto like being successful\nand like all kinds of other stuff so i'm\ni'm gonna ask you all so maybe you guys\nknow so if i if i were to tell one of my\nclients hey i know you have this goal\nover here but why don't we start over\nhere what is your client going to say\nwhat's their resistance to it\nit's not enough or it's not important\nbeautiful not enough so we're going to\nget that okay we just want to table that\neli\nwe'll talk about how to deal with that\nin a second okay\nso the first thing that we want to do is\nset a reasonable goal okay\num and\nthe 25 rule is kind of\nhow to sort of frame it i think this is\na goal that we also really discovered\nworked very well in our parent coaching\nprogram so there are a bunch of parents\nwho feel like their kids are addicted to\nvideo games and so they came to us and\nthey said oh my god can you fix our\nchildren can i sign them up for coaching\nand we said no your kid isn't the\nproblem you need to sign up for coaching\nand some parents get really really upset\nwith that they're like they're the one\nwho's playing video games all day and\ni'm like you're their parent if they're\ndoing something all day it's your fault\ni don't say that say it in that way but\nour parent coaching program we don't\nwork with the kids we work with the\nparents and the first thing that we do\nis help the parents understand that\nthe goals that you want to achieve you\nwant your your kid to start running\ntrack and never play video games and and\ndo all their chores\nand be home for like show up at the\ntable and set the table and eat dinner\nlike they're not gonna do that right\nthat's a completely inappropriate goal\nfor you to set let's meet the kid where\nthey're at what does the kid want what\ndo they care about you know what are\nthey capable of\nand so in terms of setting this goal\nlike there's a couple of good techniques\nthat you can use that can get people to\nto buy in a little bit\nso\num you know you can ask questions like\nuh\nyou know where can you start\nso this is kind of emphasizing\nthis point instead of this point okay\nso like asking the client so if they say\noh it wouldn't be enough\nfocusing on the start sort of\ndismantles then not enough somewhat does\nthat make sense\nbecause then it's not like there's no\nthere's no enough if you're just talking\nabout where to start is enough has to do\nwith hitting your target it doesn't have\nto do with like where you are it has to\ndo with where you want to go does that\nmake sense\nso you can kind of ask clients where you\ncan start and then you can also ask them\nlike you know\nwhat did you do over the last week\nso you want to sort of emphasize where\nthey are\nbut right so if someone wants to like\ndiet for example or lose weight or\nwhatever you know if someone wants to\nfind a new job you can kind of ask them\nokay what effort like what did you do\nover the last week in terms of like\nmoving towards this goal and chances are\nthey'll say nothing\nbecause they haven't started on the goal\nyet right which is kind of fine so you\nkind of\napproach them with a little bit of like\ncompassion and then you can say okay\nthat's totally fine so if you didn't\nwork on it last week so where's your\nthis is your baseline kind of telling\nthem this is your baseline\nokay and kind of cognitively i know it's\nkind of weird but people don't do this\nright\nthey don't sort of think about where\nthey are is their baseline they think\nabout where they are is a negative does\nthat make sense like cognitively\nso\nand so that cognitive shift is\nincredibly important right so like\ninstead of the gap of like in the\nnegative numbers\nyou know this is kind of where they are\nso all they see is a deficit whereas\nlike this line actually belongs here\nbecause that's where you're starting\nso you can sort of\nset this out as your baseline and then\nkind of ask the question you know what's\nthe like and then you can kind of get\nback to where where can you start\num but you can sort of ask the question\nlike\nyou know what what's one step you can\ntake\nabove the baseline\nright so this is where like once you\nframeshift to the baseline of where they\nare it adjusts their expectations so\nusing these techniques like does a lot\nof things like adjust expect\nadjust expectations\nwhich correlates with increased success\nit also has a present focus\nwhich correlates with in increased\nsuccess it meets people where they're at\nwhich correlates with increased success\nit models\nacceptance\nfor them about where they are and this\nalso\nleads to increased success\nso what we're going to use is like use\nthis kind of frame shift and use some of\nthese techniques to recruit several\nprinciples that are correlated with\nbetter outcomes\nquestions about that\nokay so just to give you all kind of a\nquick example so you know let's say okay\ni want to i want to get healthy all\nright what did you do last week\ni didn't exercise at all and i ate you\nknow i ordered like uber eats every day\nokay\nso like let's take that as your baseline\nsounds like you've got a long way to go\nyou want to kind of acknowledge right\nyou want to acknowledge their goal you\nwant to acknowledge the gap you want to\nacknowledge the feeling of not enough\nthen you can say okay where do you think\nis the so for someone who doesn't\nexercise and kind of is eating out every\nday what do you think would be a\nreasonable goal for like that person to\nstart\nlike what do you think is the first step\nthey need to do\nand then this is where your client will\nsay well i guess they need to start\nworking out every day and it's like no\nno i don't think that's reasonable\nthat's like that's do you think that\nsomeone who didn't work out zero days in\nthe last week can start working out\nevery single day\nand then you kind of like they're like\nno well i don't think that that's really\npossible so like okay so like what do\nyou think is possible\nyou know do you think working out a\nsingle day is like possible for this\nperson all right let's try let's see\nwhat happens i understand that it feels\nlike it's not going to be enough to you\nand frankly it's not going to be enough\nlet's just acknowledge that\nbut what's enough and what you're\ncapable of are two different things\nwhere you want to go and what your\nbaseline is or two different things okay\nyou all get that\nso what we're going to do is set our\ngoal at 25\nof where they want to go\nand then or maybe even smaller and then\nsort of have this kind of discussion of\nwhere their baseline is defining their\nbaseline and moving upward from the\nbaseline\nand that sort of recruits positive\nreinforcement and being successful\ninstead of this gap between what they're\ncapable of and what they want to achieve\nand will positively enhance our\nmotivation\nit also has the added benefits of\nadjusting expectations\nhelping people retain a present focus so\npeople will ask the question how do i\nstay focused in the present it's not\nsomething you can do right you don't\njust stay focused in the present as a\ncoach what you're going to do is model a\ncertain kind of behavior that forces\nthem to be in the present and then their\nbrain will learn oh this is how i stay\nin the present they're not even going to\nrealize that it's happening to them but\nover time they will start to be more\npresent focused as you direct them to be\nlike to force them into the present by\nsort of focusing on baseline instead of\ngoals\nit meets people where they at where\nthey're at which i think you guys all\nunderstand the value of and it also does\nthings like models acceptance right\nyou're not judging them for their\nbaseline you're kind of saying oh so you\ndon't work out at all and you eat out\nevery day like okay that's where we're\ngonna start you're not spending the next\n15 minutes beating them up about how\nthey could do better or how they're\npathetic or whatever so you're gonna\nstart to adjust their self-talk by\nmodeling acceptance okay so that's how\nwe set a goal\nquestions before we move on\nokay\nevidence-based goal setting\nsection number two\nso there\nthere are uh\na number\nof different kind of scientific\nprinciples that we can we can kind of\nleverage\nto optimize how to set a goal okay\nso number one\nis advice giving\nand why not to do it\nnumber two is going to be\noperationalizing\nand understanding the frontal lobe\nnumber three is going to be done in\nkrueger\nyeah so these are going to be the three\nthings that we're going to focus on so\nthe first is when you give people advice\nhow effective is it\nit's not very\neffective absolutely right so why is\nthat you all know\ni think because like the advice we give\nthem doesn't take any like context of\ntheir situation\nokay very good\nright so oftentimes it's invalidating\nyep so advice can be invalidating it\ndoesn't um\nkind of\nit doesn't seem to\nland right like so presenting people\nwith information we've talked about\nexplicit memory and implicit memory and\nall that good stuff\nso the other problem with advice giving\nis that it tends to be like a gut\nreaction so the other thing about goal\nsetting that most people tend to do is\nthat it's like a gut reaction they like\nwake up one day and they're like i need\nto get in shape\nright they just sort of set this\narbitrary goal\nso there's evidence that shows that\ninstead of giving people a solution if\nyou want to engage them in behavior give\nthem a choice\nso choice is greater than advice\nor solutions\nso i know it sounds kind of weird but\nthis is just a very simple technique\nwhich there have been there's been a ton\nof research on\nwhich is like if someone wants to lose\nweight if you tell them okay let's\ndevelop an exercise plan that is not as\nlikely to succeed as if you ask them hey\nso if you want to lose weight do you\nthink a dietary approach would be better\nor like an exercise approach would be\nbetter and then if they say exercise\napproach\nand then you kind of run down that like\nthat will actually be more likely to\nsucceed even if you give them the answer\nat the beginning giving them the answer\nat the beginning and letting them choose\nthe answer is actually like leads to\ndifferent outcomes even though you both\nsettle on on the same answer which is\nkind of weird right because generally\nspeaking when we think about\nthe success of an endeavor we think the\nendeavor is what results in success so\nif i exercise\ni will lose weight if i don't but the\nthe really interesting thing about human\npsychology is how you get to the\nconclusion of exercise actually\ndrastically affects your outcome in\nterms of whether you're successful or\nnot\nand so this is also where we're going to\ndraw on nobel prize winning economist\ndaniel kahneman\nand so remember that where do goals come\nfrom monkey see monkey do\nright\nwhere goals come from is our gut\nso human beings do not engage in a\nmethodical process\nof designing goals\nthey just rely on their gut it's driven\nby emotion or their goals or what they\nsee by other people and so this is\ncalled type one reasoning which is the\nbig discovery that daniel kahneman made\nand the interesting thing about choice\nis that choice starts to recruit type\ntwo reasoning\nand what kahneman kind of realized is\nthat human beings have two ways that\nthey make decisions\none is type one which is like gut so\nthis is like easy\nto do\nand it feels very logical\nso a good example of this is is if you\nlook at like uh you know research on\nadvertising\nif i put a display of oreos\nlike front and center\nin like a grocery store and then someone\npurchases oreos\nand then i asked that person why did you\nbuy the oreos what are they going to say\nit was in front of me that's actually\nincorrect they will never say that\nthey'll say it's because\nthey wanted them absolutely\nthe reason so kent your map hacking bro\nthe reason they bought it is because it\nwas in front of them\nbut\nthe reason they think they bought it is\nbecause of something that feels very\nlogical this is a big discovery that\nthat matt packing can\nthis is a big discovery that um daniel\nkahneman made is that people make gut\nreactions but they think that their gut\nreactions are well thought out\nso an example of type 2 reasoning is\ndifferential diagnosis\nso generally speaking type 2\nreasoning is cognitive\nit's intense\nand it feels bad\npeople don't enjoy doing it they\nactually don't enjoy being like logical\nor methodical\nso literally what we have to do with\ndoctors is we have to spend years like\nliterally years of cognitive training\nfor them to go from this to this\nso generally speaking a doctor usually\nhas a hypothesis about what's wrong with\na patient within five minutes of like\nseeing the patient sometimes even less\nlike you kind of got an idea of like\nwhat's going on\nbut what we spend years actually\ntraining is to not trust our gut and\nstart to be systematic in the way that\nwe approach patients and that's how we\ndon't miss things okay so there's a lot\nof really interesting research as well\nabout you know why uh family members\nshouldn't be physicians because it's\nhard for family members to do type 2\nreasoning with like with your family or\nsorry it's hard for physicians to do\ntype 2 reasoning with their family so\nthe interesting thing about type 2\nreasoning is that this leads to better\nresults but it feels really hard it's\nlike cognitively very intense you know\nwhen um you know if you're studying and\nyou find studying boring that's like an\nexample of like type 2 reasoning it's\nnot it's a bit of a stretch there but\nall of the activities that human beings\nfind like cognitively cumbersome or\nboring tend to be closer to type 2\nreasoning and the real tricky thing that\nalso kahneman discovered is that\neveryone thinks they operate from here i\nmean sorry everyone thinks they operate\nfrom here but most people actually\noperate from here most of our decisions\nlike when you think about what you want\nto eat today you don't sit down with a\nchart of all possible foods and do\ncalculations about caloric inputs and\nvitamin needs and like all this kind of\nstuff it's sort of like i kind of feel\nlike eating this\nright if you think about your grocery\nshopping like you may have a list but\nwhere did that list come from it wasn't\na list of all possible things that you\ncould eat it was sort of like okay we\nneed more of this well where did that\nidea come from well\nthe fruit bowl is empty so we need more\nbananas like it's all just random ass\ngut-oriented non-methodical thinking\nthis is also where advice comes from\nright so like if you think about it and\nsomeone gives you advice\nyou know if you talk to someone about\ntheir pro your problems\nhow much time do they spend thinking\nabout what's the best advice they could\nget it's a fluid conversation they spend\nall of like two seconds if even that\nright they listen to you for a while\nlike hey i think you should do this even\ni do that\nso what i present on stream most of the\ntime when i'm doing q a is type one\nreasoning it's just like my gut so you\ncan refine your gut over time and we'll\nkind of get get to that but this lecture\nis type two reasoning\nit took a long time for me to like write\nout right so i have like a whole script\ni sat down i can answer questions about\nmotivation but if i actually want to\noffer like a complete educational\nexperience i have to do type 2 reasoning\nand it takes me like six or eight hours\nwhereas like i can just show up and talk\nabout motivation that's easy peasy lemon\nsqueezy done\ny'all with me\nso\nhere's how we're going to help our\nclients we're going to engage in type 2\nreasoning by giving them a choice so you\nas a coach are going to ask open-ended\nquestions okay so if our if our target\nis is wait okay let's\nsomeone give me a target that i can run\nthrough for the whole lecture\nwhat's a target\nwhat's something that people want to do\nwhat do you mean by target just like\nwhat's a goal that someone will come in\non\nlike\nokay i'm gonna take one from chat it's\nwork out\nokay\nthis is our target\nso\none of the the questions that we could\nask people is you know we could ask\npeople okay like um\nwhat are the ways\nin which you could work out\nokay so we're gonna start with like an\nopen-ended question and then they're\ngonna give you a couple of answers like\nuh like it's like most of the time when\npeople say work out like they're gonna\njump straight to like i need to go to\nthe gym every day y'all see that it's\nlike automatic there's not even like uh\nwhat are my options and then they they\nsay like like even asking that question\nis gonna lead to like i suspect a small\nuh like improvement in outcomes okay so\nthey can say i can go to the gym i can\nwork out at home\ni can go for a run so you want to\ngenerate as many options as you can okay\ni could work out with friends\ni could do push-ups\nwhile i'm waiting in queue for a game\nright and so like you want to generate\nas many options as you can and then i\nknow it sounds kind of weird and then\nyou just repeat the options back and\nyou're like which one do you think\nwhich which one do you want to do do you\nwant to try\nso already in this process like maybe\nthe gym sucks like like sure that's what\nother people do right like other people\ngo to the gym but i have a ton of social\nanxiety and feel ashamed of myself so\nthat may be a terrible idea\nbut like that person\nwithout your help they're gonna have\nthis goal they're gonna come up with a\nsolution based on type one reasoning and\nthey're gonna stay stuck forever and\nnever work out that's why people wanna\nwork out and don't work out because they\ndon't go through this process so just by\ngenerating this process we begin to see\nokay this is what your individual\npreferences are what do you want to try\nand they can say okay i want to try\nworking out at home\nokay so you've already won there like\nthat's already better than like what\nmost people do\nso the next thing that we want to do is\njust like kind of refine that choice\nover time right so like what could you\ndo at home\nright they're like oh i guess i could do\nlike push-ups\ni could do yoga\ni could do\nparkour\nyou know like whatever like they can\ncome up with whatever like stuff they\nwant and we'll kind of get to the\ndifferent dimensions of goal setting at\nthe end but the key point here is that\nyou want to give them a choice\nbecause when people make a choice and\nyou all remember from the stages of\nchange change model this is why planning\nand action are actually like\nscientifically or psychologically\ndiscreet steps\nthey're not the same planning it\nplanning an action is the one that most\nclients like don't realize are actually\ncognitively discreet steps so this is\nall planning phase\nokay from stages of change model\nand so this is how you work with someone\nin the planning phase you give them a\nmenu of options and then what happens\nwhen you give them a menu is they're\ngoing to gravitate towards the most\nlikely scenarios and sort of set\nthemselves up for the most success okay\nquestions about\ngiving people choices instead of advice\noh one question so\ndoes this evidently lead to like a\nsolution for that for the client\nyep yes right okay so like this is gonna\nend up with a plan\nlike instead of jumping straight from i\nwant to work out to the gym this is\ngoing to be like okay you're going to do\nyoga every morning\nand then you're going to do push-ups\nwhile cueing\nfor a league of legends game\nwhile you're waiting for fortnite cue\nokay like that that's how you develop a\nplan this is going to be like more\nattainable for them\nand we'll get to you know why this for\nexample probably won't work but anyway\nso the second thing that we're gonna do\nso this will lead to a plan but it's one\nof the steps of planning brian so the\nsecond step of planning is\noperationalizing do you guys know what\noperationalizing a problem is you all\nheard that term before\nlike breaking it down\nyep breaking it down\nwhat does that do for us\nmakes things concrete\nyep how does that help\nwell now they're not abstract and you\ncan actually do them because something\nabstract is essentially like\ninsurmountable\nokay very good right so you can't take\nabstract action\ni can't get into shape it isn't possible\nwelcome forrest by the way bro how you\nbeen\nsurviving and thriving\nawesome dude\ngood to see you\num\nwhat else how else would y'all describe\noperationalizing\nit kind of increases the amount of\nachievable steps there are in absolutely\nachievable steps\nokay\nso we have this part of our brain called\nthe frontal lobe all right and the\nfrontal lobe is good at operationalizing\nso i don't know if you guys kind of know\nthis but you know like when some kids\nuh apply to college their parents help\nthem manage the application process\ny'all familiar with that\nso let me ask you something why does the\nkid\nneed the parent\nto help them with the application\nprocess\nand how is it that the parent is able to\nhelp them with the application process\nto begin with\nright why can't the kid just do it on\ntheir own\njust apply to college easy\nwell isn't it because like two things\nlike one and never applied to college in\ntwo i guess they don't understand like\nthe actual process of like falling\nthrough that decision\nyeah right so so it's really interesting\nbecause like maybe the parents have\napplied but not always\nand then the second thing is that like\nthe parents may have some ability to\nlike understand the process so we have\nthis part of our brain called the\nfrontal lobe and the frontal lobe is\nresponsible for executive function\nand what executive function means is the\nability to plan and execute tasks\nso it's like a literally this ability to\noperationalize so if i look at you know\nso this is kind of my favorite example\nbut it applies to college and stuff too\nso if i tell by a two-year-old to clean\nher room she can't do that\ni can tell her i can ask her to put her\nbooks away so she can do that\nbut she can't clean her room because\ncleaning her room is an abstract\nprocess\nand based on what her frontal lobe is\ncapable of\ni have to break as an adult i have to\nbreak it down into books\ntoys\nand pencils\nright and even if you look at the\nthe brain of a one-year-old they can't\neven put away the pencils but i can tell\nthem hey here's a pencil can you go put\nit in the box\nso like putting things in boxes\nright so if we look at what's the\ndifference between an adult and a kid\nmaybe it's experience but it may not\neven be experience it's just that an\nadult has a fully developed frontal lobe\nso they can take this abstract process\nof applying to college and like divide\nit into chunks\nand give their kid like a chunk that\nthey can manage\nand so if we talk about you know like a\nsix-year-old or a ten-year-old a\nten-year-old can clean their room right\nand even like\ntheoretically because i imagine we have\na lot of people myself included who\ndon't have clean rooms\num\nso even sometimes adults can't clean\nrooms but\nso this is the process of executive\nfunction so one of the ways that you can\nhelp people succeed is like if i tell a\ntwo-year-old to clean their room they're\ngonna fail like they're destined to\nfailure so as a coach you can help\nsomeone\nby operationalizing for them\noperationalizing is a very cognitively\nintensive task that once again is like\nyou know difficult for people to do they\nmay think they can do it they may beat\nthemselves up for you know because they\nshould be able to do it but they may\nactually be hard it may be hard to do\nand this is something that's also a\nlittle bit theoretical i don't know\nthere's actually good science behind\nthis but in my experience gamers\nespecially are very bad at\noperationalizing\nproblems\nso if you look at video games\nall of the operationalizing has been\ndone for you right there's part one of\nthe main quest part two of the main\nquests part three the main quest part\nfor the main quest part five of the main\nquest and then there's the final boss\nso gamers excel a lot they actually do\nreally well with something that i call\nclose-ended problem solving\nwhich is when they're given a discrete\ntask and all of the tools necessary\nokay so if i like tell a gamer hey i\nwant you to\nbuild a car\nout of tape\nthey'll actually be able to do that\nlike you give them a task with the goal\nvery clear and all of the pieces laid\nout it's basically like they're good at\nassembling legos\nright they're awesome at legos\nbecause you could tell them hey i want\nyou to build you know a tree with legos\nthey can do that\num maybe even superior to the the\naverage population by the way what\nthey're bad at is open-ended\nproblem-solving\nwhich is\nthings like\ngetting into college\nright because what like what are the\npieces of that like i don't really know\nlike who where do i apply to i don't\nreally know do i apply nationally\ninternationally like\nyou know\nyou know like i i don't know i don't\nknow like where to start with that so as\na coach one of the key things that you\ncan help them do is convert an\nopen-ended problems uh problem into a\nclosed-ended problem you want to act as\ntheir frontal lobe and break an abstract\ntask\ninto achievable steps\nright and so this is we kind of did this\nright here\ndo you all see that this is actually\noperationalizing for them okay so you're\ngonna do yoga every morning notice how i\ndefined am over here so how did i get\nthat it's because i'm gonna ask another\nquestion when\ncould you do yoga\nright so this is how we're going to\noperationalize and break the task apart\nso this week what you're going to do\nyou're not going to find a job\nthis week what you're going to do is\nwe may even say something like\nmake your resume but that's even too\nabstract this week what you're going to\ndo is google three different resume\ntemplates take a look at them and decide\nwhich one you want to use\nthen what you're going gonna do is\nyou're gonna replace the demographic\ninformation at the top so you're gonna\nreplace the john smith at the top with\nlike your actual name and your address\nand then what you're gonna do is grab a\npiece of paper and write down all of the\nthings that you think could belong on\nthe resume\nthat's your task for the week right it's\nlike two or three tasks but they're like\nsuper simple if you really think about\nit takes like less than half an hour and\nthen next week they've already started\nadding they're editing their resume at\nleast the top part is done the next week\nit's going to be translating what they\nput on their piece of paper onto the\nresume\nand once you do that then we're going to\nlook at your resume together and we're\ngoing to try to figure out okay how can\nwe make this sound good so you're going\nto take one task on your resume and\nyou're gonna try to like sell it in some\nway\nso for example if you were\npresident of your esports\ngaming association in college\nright like how can we buff that up some\nso you can state that and then you can\nsay i increased membership over 300\npercent like over the course of one year\nyou know organized a 50 000 charity\ntournament and organized 200 students\ninto like organized an event\nthat involved sponsors 200 students and\nall that kind of stuff so you're\ndemonstrating on your resume like\npresident of esports or what does that\nmean like is that a thing but when you\nstart like\nlisting things out that like an employer\nwill be like oh wow so this person can\nlike get stuff done this is actually\npretty cool they organized an event\nokay so you may have to help them a\nlittle bit with their and and that may\nbe a little bit tricky in terms of\nresume building but do you all see how\nthe key thing is breaking apart the\npieces of like making a resume\nis that clear\nso you want to operationalize out their\ntask as best as possible\nwhen you do that the chances of them\nbeing able to succeed will be a lot\nbetter\nkey other things you know so when we\ntalk about achievable steps that also\nyou know helps us uh where is it\nwhere's positive reinforcement there it\nis\nright so we get a plus there and we get\na plus there as you kind of do these\nthings okay\nso we're going to help them with their\nfrontal lobes the cool thing is as you\nengage in this process with them over\ntime\nyou're engaging in type 2 reasoning\nwhich will\nover time actually become type one\nreasoning\nokay so then they'll actually get\nautomatic at doing this kind of stuff\nthey'll be able to break apart tasks for\nthemselves so the first time i teach my\nkid how to clean up their room\ni have to like direct them right but as\nthey practice their brain is able to\noperationalize that task and i could\neven take them to a house they've never\nbeen to and i could say clean up this\nroom and they could do it\nmake sense\nso that's the second thing that we're\ngoing to kind of focus on\nour second principle that we can\nleverage so now we're going to move on\nto number three which is dunning-kruger\nso\ndunning-kruger graph\nhas\num you know so this is\nunconscious\nthis is competence\nright so i i may be miss attributing\nthis\nso\ngenerally speaking we start up here\nwhere we're unconsciously incompetent\nand at the end we end up this may not be\ndone in kruger actually\ni think it relates to don and kruger but\nand up here we sort of end up with\nunconscious competence i'm a natural\nright and if we think about playing a\nvideo game like you know there are times\nwhere\nyou suck\nand you intentionally try to get better\nand your brain is like doing the\ncognitive work\nso\nand then over time you know so this is\nconscious incompetence and then we move\nover here\nto\nconscious competence\nright that's what what this is over here\nand then eventually we move up to\nunconscious\ncompetence and then it becomes easy so\nwe're natural over here\nover here we're oblivious\nso one of the key things this is\na little bit more anecdotal or based on\nmy own experience\nbut i think our goal so a lot of people\nwhen they think about achieving their\ngoals what they want to do is they want\nto go from here to here\nright this is where you start i suck i\ndon't know how to work out this is me\nworking out every day\ni think our job as a coach is not\nactually to move along this axis\nour job as a coach is to push people\ndown here\nwhat we want them to do is to start\nthinking about it right so what we\nreally want to emphasize is like\nconscious thought process we want to\nemphasize type 2 reasoning we want to\nemphasize being methodical we want to\nemphasize being critical of your process\nwe want to emphasize problem solving in\na very organized and conscious way this\nis being thoughtful being mindful being\npresent all that crap\nso one of the key things that that this\nprocess does\nright is we ask people these like\ndifferent kinds of questions and things\nlike that is we're making the process of\ngoal setting become competent conscious\nso you don't know how to set a good goal\nthat's fine even after asking you a few\nquestions you're going to be down here\nyou're still not going to know how to\nset a good goal right you may come up\nwith push-ups between while cueing but\nwho the [ __ ] does push-ups while queuing\nno one come on that's ridiculous\nright\nthe point though is not that these are\ngonna succeed we'll get there in a\nsecond when it comes troubleshooting\ngoals and iteration and all that kind of\nstuff the point of doing this exercise\nis that people are going to be thinking\nabout it in a critical and calculating\nway\nthat's ultimately what leads to success\nin goal setting\nis bringing things from the unconscious\nto the conscious and now that we're\naware of the problem right because\nremember that most of our problems are\nlying dormant they're invisible we can't\ndetect them and then we can't deal with\nthem you all know this through coaching\nright this is what the emotional\ncatharsis is you all have done this with\nall of your clients where you've helped\nthem understand something in a way that\nthey didn't understand anymore\nand that understanding proceeds change\nso we know this you guys already know\nhow to do this process i suspect just\nkeep doing what you're doing\nand once it's conscious then we can\nstart acting on it right you don't go\nfrom here to here you don't go from here\nto here you go from here to here then\nyou start doing being successful but\nbeing successful involves being\nconscious first\nthen you become successful and then it\nbecomes easy then you get to the person\nwho's in shape and you ask them how hard\nis it for you to work out and they say\nit's not that hard\nit's natural for me and this is where\neveryone wants to go but since all of\nour clients want to go from here to here\nthey want to actually ignore where the\nmoney happens this is where change\nhappens change happens down here not up\nhere and as long as they keep on doing\nthis they're doomed to failure\nso your job as a coach is to help them\nbecome conscious\neven if they fail be conscious\nbe conscious of your failure because\nthat's what's going to help you succeed\nquestions about that\nokay\nnow we're going to move on to\nnumber three on our big topics which is\ntroubleshooting goal setting\nokay\nso what are the problems with the goals\nthis open-ended question kind of read my\nmind question what are the problems with\nthe goals that our clients set\nwhat are the different kinds of\nchallenges they have with goal setting\nlet's even don't even think about what\nthey set what are the what are the\nproblems that what when you when clients\ncome in\nwhat are their what are their challenges\naround like setting goals or\nyou know just\nokay\nchats helping expectations oh what does\nthat mean expectations\noh they have like\nlike a higher like expected outcome\nbased on their actions okay so\nvery good so they're gonna have overly\nambitious goals\nwhat else\nmaybe goals that don't really align with\ntheir values\nvery good misdirected goals\nwhat else\nthe last one\nis remarkably\ncommon\nand\nalso really easy to miss\nbecause i may be set is setting it up to\nfail\nthey lack goals\nright we see this too where someone\ncomes in and they're like i don't even\nknow where to start\nthere's no point anymore\nright so we still have to think about\nthat person in terms of goal setting\nlike we owe it to that person to help\nthem find an appropriate goal okay so\nhere's the problem that we run into with\ngoals is that some people lack goals to\nbegin with\nand they don't know where to start how\nshould we deal with the person who lacks\ngoals\nwhat do you all think\nmaybe kind of trying to understand them\na little bit more try and get a feel for\nlike\nwhat they want to do absolutely right so\nlike this is where the first like we\njust need to understand them\nso before we figure out where we want to\ngo let's like triangulate our gps and\nfigure out where we are\nright so where are we\nwhat's going on in your life\nright so and this is you all know how to\ndo this i'm pretty confident right so\nthey don't they feel overwhelmed they\nfeel directionless they feel hopeless so\nit's like all these questions about okay\nlike why do you feel hopeless like where\ndoes the hopelessness come from you know\nwhy don't you have like you know you\ndon't ask why questions but um you know\nwhat makes it hard for you to pick a\ndirection to go and you're gonna uncover\nall kinds of crap like oh there's no\npoint in trying okay like when did you\ngive up hope like when did you learn how\nto give up hope you guys know all this\nstuff right pretty familiar we good okay\nso if they lack goals it's going to be\nlike\nexploratory work\nit's not about directing them anywhere\nit's about exploration\nso for clients who have overly ambitious\ngoals\nwhat are we going to do for them\nstart with the 25 rule\nsure so 25 rule is good\nwhat else\nwhy are their goals overly ambitious\num i think we would\ntry to make them\nlike let them figure out that their goal\nis actually ambitious\nyep good so increase in sight\ninto\noverly ambitious goals\ngood\ni'm pretty confident that you guys are\nable to do that as well but why are\ntheir goals ambitious\neli\nyou figured this out some time ago\nbecause yeah they're comparing\nthemselves to others and it's not\nit's not enough all that crap right so\nthis is where\nenter all of the things that you guys\nare already experts in shoulds\nnot enough\ncomparison\nahamkar\nall this crap comes in\nso the key thing here is you've got to\ndeconstruct the idea of should\nright and i think you guys know how to\ndo this\nbecause what does that mean like\nor enough\nbecause like that's not a thing\nenough is not a thing\nright and you can make the argument that\nit is a thing you can say okay i did not\nget a score high enough to pass the\nclass\ndr k clearly that's the thing i didn't\npass the class okay fair enough\nso like enough can absolutely be a thing\nthere's a reason why there's a word for\nit but i would say that most of the\ntimes\nwhether\nsome\noutcome is enough or not enough because\nenough is an outcome orientation\nwhether you do something that is enough\nor not enough is completely or whether\nit's enough or not enough is completely\nindependent of what you do\ndoes that make sense\nso i can study every day\nor i can study as much as i can and\nmaybe that'll be not enough\nbut\ndo i want this to determine what how i\ntake action in the present\nor do i want to focus on this and then\njust hope that this happens so the\nproblem with the idea of not enough is\nthat as people are like thinking about\nnot enough it actually paralyzes them\nfrom taking action and destroys their\nmotivation so you really have to\ndeconstruct the idea of like enough and\nshould and all this kind of crap through\nall of these things which i know you all\ncan do so you kind of do that if they\nhave overly ambitious goals right and\nthen on a more practical level so this\nis like on a philosophical level\nwhat you need to do as a coach\noh no i missed an oh\nand on a practical level you can help\nthem set more ambitious goals and be\nprepared for that resistance right and\nso you like as soon as you try to use\nthe 25 rule on them they're gonna say\nit's not enough but you're gonna be\nready for them because you know all this\nstuff and then you're gonna be like\nlet's talk about that right you're gonna\nwork through all this crap then they're\ngonna set an appropriate goal and then\nthey're more likely to achieve it we\ngood\nanother key point here is that sometimes\npeople confuse goals with wish lists\ni don't know if you all have ever done\nthis yourselves or you've heard someone\nelse or where like you start to set a\ngoal for yourself and then you start\ntacking more on\nit's like i should work out every day\nand i should eat healthy and i should\nhave a smoothie every morning and then\nlike goals like quickly like spiral into\nwishlists and then it's like\neverything when a goal turns into a wish\nlist you're destroying your frontal\nlobe's ability to do any of it it\nbecomes overwhelming it's too many goals\nso you're going to help them kind of\nscale back okay\nso number three\nthe misdirected goal\nso this is\nthe hardest thing about coaching\nis that sometimes clients come in and\nthey have the wrong goals and you may\nsay dr k that's ridiculous how can a\nclient have a wrong goal isn't it for\nthem to determine aren't they the ones\nto decide incorrect sometimes our\nclients are stupid let me give you an\nexample so i had a client that came in\none day and said dr k my boat is sinking\ni need a bigger bucket i need a bigger\nbucket this bucket is not big enough to\nget all the water out of my boat\ncan you give me a bigger bucket\nand what they need to do is plug the\nholes\nso like this is where type one reasoning\ncomes in again right because it's clear\nbecause the person's logical if they've\ngot a bigger bucket they can bail water\nfaster and they'll you know like that's\nwhat that'll fix it right\nbut their goal is coming from like an\nincorrect understanding of the problem\nand this is where you can roll in a\nbunch of stuff that we've talked about\nlike jung's shadow\nright we can talk about things like\nalexithymia\nyou know like psychological defense\nmechanisms like suppression\nwe can talk about ahamkar\nblind spots\nright because the ahamkar won't let them\nsee where the real problem is\noh yeah like if i'm a narcissist the\nproblem is that everyone else is like\nvery insensitive to me people need to be\nmore insensitive to me\nyou know it's like everyone around me is\nan [ __ ] everyone around me needs to\nbe nicer it's just like i need a bigger\nbucket no the problem is something else\nlike so your job as a coach is to help\npeople access all this crap\ncognitive biases\nand i know you've done it i know all of\ny'all have done it\nwhere a client will come in and will be\nlike you know we'll say one thing and\nthen you're like hey wait a second what\nyou're saying actually doesn't make any\nsense you point out the discrepancy you\npoint out the cognitive bias you point\nout the ambivalence\nright so oh i just need to start\ndrinking after 5 p.m i just need to not\ndrink early\nwell\nwhat how do you get to that conclusion\nwell because when i drink after 5 pm\neverything is fine when i start early\nit's a problem whereas like the real\nproblem is like maybe you've got a\nproblem with alcohol you should be\ndrinking at all\nso there are all kinds of things that\ncan result in a misdirected goal\nso this is once again where y'all you\nknow i'm pretty sure you guys know how\nto deal with this\nright do you all feel comfortable with\nlike people who have misdirected goals\nright so and this is where building a\ntherapeutic alliance is really good this\nis also where like remember as a coach\nyou're not like you're not there to just\nagree with whatever they say you're\nthere to challenge them so with clients\nwho have misdirected goals like it's a\ngood place to challenge them once you\nhave an alliance and you can say hey i'm\nwondering you know if maybe there's a\ndifferent way to think about how to fix\nthis problem once again recruit type 2\nreasoning\nto help them think about you know how\nthey could deal with this problem\notherwise like what's a creative\nsolution to your problem\nbecause their solutions are not\nindividualized they're not based on\ntheir own creativity they're based on\nwhat someone on the internet what worked\nfor someone on the internet\ni watched this\nperson who did this on the internet this\nis what worked for them so that's what\ni'm gonna do\nmaybe you have a different problem\nokay\nquestions about troubleshooting goals\nor troubleshooting goal setting i should\nsay\nokay\nso um\nnow we're going to talk about one other\nthing in terms of uh\nkind of how to iterate so we're going to\ntalk about iteration for a second\nso our approach for goal setting and\nmotivation at healthy gamer is to not\nachieve your goals it's to iterate\nsuccess is not our target learning is\nour target\nso i don't know that we can succeed but\nwe can certainly try to learn\nso what we're going to do is we're we're\ngoing to give you guys a robust\nframework for this but you know expect\nyour clients to succeed some\nand fail some\nand then what we're gonna do is like do\nkind of like a post-mortem analysis of\nlike okay why did you fail what got in\nthe way things like that the key thing\nthat i want to share with you all is a\nreally fascinating\nuh other i guess scientific principle\nfor lack of a better term actually comes\nfrom public health is something called\npositive deviance so often times when\nour clients have goals and they fall\nshort of their goals their emphasis is\non the failure and what they could do\nbetter\nbut the interesting thing is that\nthe recipe to success is not necessarily\nand what they could do better it's\nactually in the times that they already\nsucceeded\nso this is a quick story that i'll share\nwith y'all so these were the people who\nsort of discovered positive deviance\nthere were a group of uh doctors from\nfrance in the us\nthat were tasked by the world health\norganization or someone like that to fix\nmalnutrition in rural vietnam\nreally fascinating story you guys can\ncheck out the book positive deviants\num so what they did is they went to\nvietnam and they sort of made all these\narrangements and the vietnamese\ngovernment said like okay our people are\nmalnourished and so these folks were\nlike okay do you all have food that we\ncan give them and the vietnamese\ngovernment was like yes because the\nproblem to malnourishment is food aid\nright like if you're in a developing\ncountry and people don't have food to\neat gg like you just need food just get\nfood easy bro\nso then they show up and it turns out\nthat there's been some kind of\ncommunication problem or maybe\ncorruption and the food aid is no longer\nthere and they've like set they've taken\nsabbaticals and they're like traveling\nto vietnam they're going to be there for\nlike six months but now they don't have\nany of the resources that they were\nsupposed to have to fix this food aid\nproblem\nand so the vietnamese government was\nlike or whatever the health\ndepartment or whatever was like we can\ngive you a van lodging and a translator\ncan you please help us with this problem\ncan you please help our population\nbecome less malnourished without any\nfood\nand so these people are like sure why\nnot and so the malnour like the rate of\nmalnutrition amongst like pediatric or\namongst kids because it was focused on\nchildren was something like 50\nand so the researchers had this really\ninteresting idea which is like you know\nthere are a thousand people in in let's\nsay this part of rural vietnam\nand half of them are malnourished that's\nterrible\nbut why aren't the other half\nmalnourished\nlike it's kind of interesting because\nthere's actually a success\nthere's like some people are not\nmalnourishing like what's up with that\nand so what they sort of discovered was\nlike this principle of positive deviance\nwhich is that if you're trying to figure\nout how to fix a problem\ndon't focus on the people who are\nunsuccessful or don't focus on your\nattempts that are failures focus on your\nattempts that are successes and by\nemphasis by exploring why you were\nsuccessful then and duplicating that you\nwill actually fix the problem of failure\nin and of itself as it turns out for\nthose of you who are curious what they\ndiscovered is that most of the people\nare malnourished because they're rice\nfarmers and so their primary staple of\ntheir diet is rice so they get enough\ncalories but they just don't get enough\nlike protein and micronutrients and\nstuff like that\nand so what they discovered is that some\nfamilies\nwhen they're out in the rice fields\nthere are different kinds of like things\nthat are growing in the rice fields so\nyou'll get like small like clams and\nshrimps and things like that and that\nsome people would literally like have an\napron and any time they saw like some\ntiny bit of fish like like a small fish\nor a clam or like a shrimp or like some\nkind of you know\nwater organism crustacean they would\nscoop it up and stick it in their apron\nthey also found that that this same\ngroup of people that there were certain\nweeds that would grow in the rice fields\nthat are actually very nutritious but\nare considered like poor people's food\nso in the in the southern united states\nfor example like if you look at it\nhistorically like collard greens were\nfoods that like slaves would would eat\nbecause they were considered less\ndesirable so like you know the the slave\nthe plantation owners would eat like the\ndesirable vegetables and then the slaves\nwould eat the collard greens collard\ngreens are delicious by the way\nand so if you look at recipes for\ncollard greens they all involve like you\nknow like off cuts of pork and things\nlike that so you add like a little bit\nof bacon and like other like types of\nmeat that you can't it's hard to eat but\nif you add it to collard greens makes it\ndelicious\nso um what they sort of discovered is\nthat there's kind of this social stigma\nagainst eating this like nutritious\nvegetable\nand so that's the way in which like half\nof the population was not malnourished\nwhile the other half of the population\nwas and so by sort of discovering that\nsuccess and applying it to the other\npeople by teaching the people oh hey you\nshould scoop up shrimp too they also did\na couple of other interventions like um\nthey had like they set up like a meal\nplan where like one family would cook\nevery day for like five or six different\npeople so they kind of got together and\nshared their cooking duties said like\none pot of stew that would serve five\nfamilies and that worked really well too\nso discovered a couple of other things\nbut essentially the the the idea behind\npositive deviance is when you're working\nwith a client our tendency you know if\nthey let's say they you know did yoga\nfor three days\nand then like failed for four days\nand their target was\nyoga\nevery day qd means daily medical\nabbreviation okay\nso then what you what we want to do is\nwe can say oh why did you feel like what\nhappened what got in the way but i\nequally important is asking them you\nknow\nwhy did you succeed\nwhat were the circumstances\nfor the first three days that allowed\nyou to succeed and what changed on day\nfour so oftentimes i've noticed this\nbias in how people solve problems is\nthat everyone focuses on the negative in\nproblem solving right if you kind of\nthink about it i do this kind of stuff\nin all dimensions whether it's\ninvestment banking working with traders\nworking with physicians around like like\nyou know\nuh bad outcomes with patient care even\nin esports because what everyone focuses\non on esports is the games that they\nlost not the games that they win do you\never watch replays of the games that you\ncrush the opponent not usually right\nusually if you want to learn we focus on\nyour mistakes\num\nso\nrecruit positive devious deviants and uh\nfocus on\nhow your clients are able to succeed and\nduplicate that process to troubleshoot\ngoals questions\nokay\nlast one i recognize i'm out of time\ndimensions of goals so this we're gonna\nrun through very quickly there'll be a\nlot more um information in the manual\nokay\nso when we think about a goal\nmuch like our original\num\ndiagram there's a lot of value to be\ngained out of something like motivation\nand actually breaking apart motivation\ninto multiple things\nbecause there isn't like one motivation\nlever but when we break it apart into\ndifferent things we can like adjust the\nlevers in different ways\nso if we think about even something like\nlanguage so the more letters we have the\nmore we're able to like\ncompose different words right so\nincreasing the resolution on which we\ncan act increasing the precision at\nwhich we can make changes will lead to\nbetter outcomes so there's also like a\nbalancing influence and that you know at\nsome point we decided that a collection\nof letters should make a word instead of\nyou know having one unique word i mean\none unique symbol for each word which is\nwhat hieroglyphics is which is also like\nif you look at um you know chinese\ncharacters or kanji if you look at\nemojis right so there's like an\ninteresting balance between like what's\nthe resolution of like letters versus\nsymbols\nand what we can see is if you look at\nsomething like emojis you can\ncommunicate things very effectively by\nlike increasing the precision as we\nexpand the number of emojis at our\ndisposal we become more efficient\ncommunicators\nso what we're going to do is expand the\nprecision with which we look at a goal\nand so here are the dimensions that i\nwould encourage all to think about with\na client and work on okay so the first\nis the target\nso this is what we kind of think of\ntraditionally is the goal like\nbecome an olympic gold medalist right so\nwhat are the ways in which we can adjust\nthe target so the goal here is that\neach of these dimensions can be explored\nand adjusted to help us attain success\nokay\nso should we change our target so this\nis where the 25 rule\ncomes in okay\nsecond thing is what are the actions\nso this is also where like\noperationalizing comes in because\noftentimes we set goals that are not\nactually actions so to explicitly take a\ngoal a target and reduce it to actions\nwe'll we'll operationalize will make\nthings easier abstract to concrete all\nthat good stuff so this is all uh this\nis all stuff that hopefully all will\nunderstand\nit's just an organized framework that\ny'all can use with a client okay so what\nare the actions that we can take\nthird\ndimension is exploring examples\nof\nsuccess\nand failure\nright so very practically\nwhat you can do with a client is you can\nask them you know once they if they set\na goal for themselves and they come in\nnext week and they say i succeeded i did\nit for the first three days and then i\nforgot and then i didn't do it again so\nwe can explore that okay how do you feel\nabout that you know what what do you\nwhat do you understand about what got in\nthe way what made it hard for you to to\ndo it the last four days\nuh it's also kind of bizarre because it\nseems like you were crushing it for 72\nhours how do you understand that right\nso that's positive humans we just talked\nabout that but still a part of our\nframework you can you can explore\nexamples of success and failure and the\nkey things is what are the key\nwhat are the key takeaways\nfrom these successes and failures that\nonce you make these key takeaways\nconscious\nyou have increased your clients ability\nto like engage in them again right so\nwe're going to dunny krueger we're going\nto move along to dunn the dunning-kruger\nuh\ncurve by asking this question\nso um this is also an opportunity to\nexplore resistance\nright so like when you fail like there\nmay be like resistance there\ncould be and then once again emotions\nego etc\na good question here is what gets in the\nway\nso you don't want to ask the question\nwhy did you fail you want to ask the\nquestion you know it seems like you were\nable to do yoga the first three days\nwhat got in the way the fourth day and\nso what even if you think about that\nquestion what you're instead of them\nsaying oh i'm a failure right like\ninstead of letting them retreat to their\nidentity and it was doomed to fail and\nall this kind of stuff i am dot dot dot\nyou're raising awareness about an\nexternal factor that could be\ninfluencing them which then they can\ncontrol\nso for example what you may discover is\ni wanted to do yoga but i actually like\noverslept because i stayed up way too\nlate and that's really interesting right\nbecause then you've sort of discovered\noh the problem isn't boosting your\nwillpower the problem is if you want to\ndo yoga consistently you need to fix\nyour sleep schedule so it could be an\nissue of a misdirected goal\ndimension number four\num\nokay so i had actually split these uh in\nmy\nin the framework i'd actually split\nthese into two different things so\nexamples of success in exploring failure\nand then going down the route\nof resistance okay so that's number four\nokay so there are some things here that\nwe're going to include for the sake of\ncompleteness which is not really within\nthe scope of coaching so then if we also\nthink about it there are physiologic\nfactors\nright so people could have circadian\nrhythm disorders they could have vitamin\nd deficiency they could have um they\ncould be hypothyroid they could have\ntestosterone deficiency they may be\nvitamin b deficient there are all kinds\nof physiologic factors they may be in a\nhigh\na high inflammatory state which makes\npeople like feel kind of sluggish and\nmakes it hard to work there's a lot of\nphysiology that goes into motivation a\nlittle bit outside of the scope of\ncoaching\nbut i just include it here for\ncompleteness this is also where we can\nthink about things like sleep and diet\nand exercise as being physiologic\nfactors psychological stressors\nso when you have a goal i know it's this\nis going to sound really simple but i\ndon't think that people really\nappreciate this it's everyone sort of\nintellectually understands it\nbut they don't really understand it on\nan implicit level\nand they're not consciously aware of it\nthat you know if you're overwhelmed\nor stressed\nor had a bad interaction at work\nthat's going to impact your ram\nright so like we all have a limited\namount of ram working memory\nwe all have like limited amounts of like\nenergy in our frontal lobe we have\nlimited amounts of willpower\nand what you'll see time and time again\nis like you know when people get sober\nfor example\noftentimes there's a psychological\nstressor\nlike their ex started texting them again\nwhich sort of precipitates the relapse\nso there are all kinds of psychological\nstresses that can contribute to\ndifficulty in achieving your goals\nokay so you can ask them you know what's\nbeen stressful for you over the last\nweek\num\nwhen when things get stressful how do\nyou think that will affect your ability\nto meet your goals because generally\nspeaking what people the conclusion they\ntend to come to is oh i suck at this if\ni was better if i could manage stress\nbetter\nthen i would succeed so the failure is\nmine but by sort of pointing out\nexplicitly that their psychological\nstressors which will make their life\nhard you allow them to do things like\nforgive themselves demonstrate\nself-compassion you also give them axes\nso if i think the problem is that i'm a\nfailure and that i can't handle stress\nwell\nthat's not actionable whereas if you\nreframe the problem you take that\nmisdirected goal and you help people\nrecognize that you're human\nand that if you get stressed it's hard\nto work out you're going to stress eat\nmore maybe the solution is not to be\nincrease your willpower because i don't\nknow how to do that\nbut maybe the solution is to set better\nboundaries with people who create stress\nin your life\nand that if you really want to work out\nevery day the first step is to actually\nset boundaries with people who are very\nstressful\nso psychological stresses\nnext thing is social influences i kind\nof bled into this with the last one but\ni think it's actually very important to\nexplicitly acknowledge what the social\ninfluences towards your goal setting are\nwho are the people that you hang out\nwith so there's a there's an entire\nvideo about this in dr k's guide on\nsangha which is in the meditation path\nand the path of accomplishment\nso you know like\nif you\nyou know what do your roommates\ninspire you to do\nyou know how do your parents\num\naffect your motivation\nand there's some interesting\nlike revelations here which not a lot of\npeople realize because like parents\nthink they're being supportive right\nthey'll go to their kin they'll say oh\nmy god you have so much potential\nlike you can do anything you're so smart\noh my god you're so smart you're so\nbrilliant\nyou have so much potential how do you\nthink that affects a kid's motivation\nmakes it worse\nabsolutely right the parent thinks that\nthey're\nhelping they're actually making things\nworse\noh my god you're such a wonderful boy i\ndon't know why you can't find a\ngirlfriend you're so handsome\nand you're so wonderful and you're so\nsweet you're such a catch\ni don't know what why the girls just\ndon't like you like i don't understand\nwhat's going on well first of all mom\ni'm gay\nyou know\nso that's part of it\num anyway so like it's kind of\ninteresting but i think once again the\ngoal is to consciously make people aware\nso like you know you have your friends\nright\nand so like but what are your friends\nactually motivate you to do like when\nyou spend more time with your friends\nwhat how do your behaviors evolve when\nyou hang out with your friends\ndo you\nplay more video games\neat healthy food like what happens\nwhat's the influence explicitly\nunderstand what's the influence of\ndifferent people in your life\nand even in cases of like romantic\npartners right like so i this is a\nreally\nsurprisingly common example\nso sometimes you'll have a married\ncouple\nand one member of the married couple is\nmotivated to change their diet\nand then they start eating healthy and\nwhat does the other member of the\nmarried couple do\nthey start eating healthy too\nyou would hope so if only that were the\ncase\ncan anyone imagine the opposite\nif you're resentful\nabsolutely\nright so sometimes steve sometimes\nyou're correct\ni tend to be kind of pessimistic\nso i see the dark side of things and\nwhat tends to happen is the other\npartner feels ashamed\nright because it's like i still want to\neat my doughnut\nand there you are eating oatmeal it's\nlike i just want a doughnut and then i\nfeel bad about myself because you're\nsitting there eating oatmeal and i'm\nsitting here eating a doughnut i feel\nlike an idiot\nand then i resent you and then i start\nto sabotage you and then i start to get\nin the way\nhappens all the time\nright and you may see this kind of thing\nlike even within your like online\nfriends right i love them but sometimes\nthey're like oh no man like play one\nmore don't quit\nplay one more like we're gonna crush\nthem like let's do it bro\ndon't don't quit don't go to sleep yet\ni'm not going to sleep yet what's wrong\nwith you putting together your life\nscrew that\nlet's play\nso social influences\nright thinking about so a couple of\nexplicit questions here who holds you\nback\nwho pulls you forward\nand there are a couple of other\nrevelations to be had here as well\nso the first is that\nsometimes the people that make you feel\nbad are actually the ones that pull you\nforward i certainly had this experience\nat harvard\nwhere i felt like holy crap these people\nare amazing and every time i talk to\nthem i'm like you did what\nyou have how many publications that's\ninsane\nyou have a picture with barack obama\nbecause you served in the health\ndepartment and helped him\npass the affordable care act like that's\ncrazy bro\nright\nlike that's what you wind up with and\nyou may feel some amount of like\nresistance\nto hanging out with those people but\nhelping your clients understand who are\nthe people in their lives that pull them\nforward and what's the resistance to\nhanging out with them\ncan actually be very helpful\nnext thing is environmental influences\nokay\nand by environmental influences this\none's pretty straightforward\nbut it's it's things like access to cell\nphone\nso like where is your cell phone\nwhen you're trying to work\nis it in your pocket is it easily\naccessible is it locked you know what's\nthe status of your notifications\nwhen do you get distracted how do you\nget distracted where do you study\nis it the library is it at home\nwhat are the environmental influences\nthat are going to lead to success once\nagain going back to the working out\nexample right so we kind of asked people\nlike\ngym or home that's key it's crucial\nso a lot of these dimensions are baked\ninto everything that you guys are\nalready doing which is by the way part\nof the reason that you all have the\noutcomes that you do despite never\nhaving had this training because it's\nall baked in you're already doing it but\nby giving you this framework hopefully\nit'll help you be a little bit more\nfocused and\nincrease the value that you bring to\nyour clients so right now after spending\neight weeks with one of y'all lovely\npeople our clients feel 25 more in\ncontrol of their lives that's awesome\n25 control in eight weeks is like really\namazing no one ever feels 100\nright it's just not going to happen\nthere's some issues with the data so 25\nis actually objectively very good\nand so as we sort of teach you the these\nkinds of things my hope is that we'll be\nable to bump you all from like 25 to 30\npercent\num\nand then the last thing this is kind of\nweird\nthis isn't really so much for the\naverage client but matters more in terms\nof like performance coaching and things\nlike that is i like to think about\nstakeholders\nso like what are the different\nstakeholders for the goal that you're\ntrying to achieve\num and this is kind of important because\nthis is kind of goes back to the married\ncouple example but sometimes for the\ngoals that you have\nthey're actually like other people who\ndon't want those goals right so if\nyou're trying to get promoted for\nexample that's a great example of like\ndoing this like we're doing a\nstakeholder analysis is very helpful\nto help your clients recognize that\nthere are things outside of them that\nare going to be influencing them and\nactually consciously thinking about\nthose things can help you adapt your\ngoal and adapt your actions to\naccommodate for those stakeholders this\nis definitely something that we'll talk\nmore about so as we sort of um we're\nprobably going to do like a relaunch of\nperformance coaching at some point we'll\ntalk a lot more about this\nbut it's just i'm kind of including it\nhere for the sake of completeness\nokay so i've run\nway over time i apologize i wanted to go\nfast"
