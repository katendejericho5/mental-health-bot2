    "transcript": "seriously it's a very hard line to walk\nas a as a mental health professional in\nterms of like what do you hold people\naccountable for and what do you like\ngive people a pass on welcome to day\nthree\nof the goal setting and motivation\ncurriculum for healthy gamer coaches so\nlet's start by\nkind of recapping what we covered so far\nso day one was an introduction and we\nsort of talked a little bit about our\nmodel of um how we approach goal setting\nand motivation and the crux of it is\nthat so the key points of like goal\nsetting and motivation is that generally\nspeaking\nthere's an abundance of information\nabout like how to become motivated\navailable to people but that access to\nthat information does not actually like\ncatalyze behavioral change right there\nare so many youtube videos about\nmotivation and yet everyone is not out\nthere you know crushing it day after day\nafter day after day and so why is that\nthere are many reasons for that we\nexplored a couple of different things\nbut you know the biggest reason that\ni've sort of discovered is that\nmotivation is not like a monolithic\nthing it's not like a binary thing where\nyou have motivation or you don't have\nmotivation that that if you look at\nhuman beings engaging in behavior there\nare three discrete\nparts of that the first is the intent\nand so like why they want to do the\nthing the second is the resistance so\nwhen i try to do something like\nsomething is going to get in the way\nright so if i need to study and i don't\nfeel like it like i don't feel like it\nis actually like a sign of something\ngoing on in my mind\nso there's intent there's resistance and\nthere's the actual action\nand so we sort of shared this model with\nyou because\nit's our belief at healthygamer that\ngood diagnosis precedes good treatment\nwe're not really diagnosing anything\nmedical here but i think that's just a\nway of sort of sharing this principle\nthat you have to understand a problem\nbefore you can fix it and so a big\nproblem that i notice when you look at\nthings like the internet is everyone\ntalks about how to fix motivation right\nthey everyone offers solutions but what\nthey don't do is like tailor those\nsolutions to your specific problems\nso as a coach the real value add in your\nmission your dharma\nis to help clients figure out like why\naren't they motivated like where's the\nactual problem so that you can leverage\nsome degree of like understanding and\nfixing\nit second day we talked about intent\nright so intent\nis a really really important piece that\npeople will set goals for themselves and\nthe reason that they don't meet those\ngoals is because internally like who\nthey are doesn't really align with the\ngoal that they set so we sort of\ndiscovered that when i you know when i\nsay to myself i want to do something or\nthis is a goal that i have to set for\nmyself that that goal can come from any\nnumber of or four different places\nwithin myself\nit can be a desire and desires are born\nof the indriyas or the sense organs so\nwhat i mean by this is like if i want to\nplay a video game like you know i don't\nknow that people in 1200\nce like 800 years ago really cared about\nthe launch of wow classic\ni don't think that they had any desire\nto play wow classic and i know it sounds\nkind of silly like duh so then if you\nthink about it where does the desire to\nplay wow classic comes from it comes\nfrom a sensory experience that gives you\nthe idea oh look there's wow classic so\na desire comes from a sensory experience\nor the memory of a sensory experience\nanother good example of this is when i'm\nwalking down the street and i smell like\nyou know someone cooking something it\ncan be like oh wow that smells amazing\nnow i want to eat it\nso that's a desire\nso a lot of times what will happen is\nour our clients will have goals based on\nseeing what other people are doing\nthey're like oh look at that person on\ninstagram they are so happy i wish i had\nthat as well they'll read about things\non the internet oh like look at this\nperson is like so happy i wish i had\nthat as well so those are desires the\nnext thing that tends to drive a lot of\npeople is the idea of should so they\nhave this like preconceived notion based\non once again observation of the\nexternal world or different kinds of\npressures or societal constraints\num that will sort of tell them what they\nshould be and they they strive to be\nthat thing it's not what they want to be\nand i'm not talking about desire\num it's not actually something that they\ncare about or value it's something that\nsociety or their environment is telling\nthem that they should do and that can\nactually work for driving behavior\nsometimes right so\nas the desperation of\nnot failing out of college i shouldn't\nfail out of college and as that kind of\nemotional energy builds up and i hit\nthat last minute panic i can actually\nstudy because i should be studying right\nnow and so there are ways that shoulds\ncan drive behaviors but what we really\ndiscover is that sustained progress\ntowards your goals\ntends to happen when people align their\ngoals with like internally what feels\ngood to them\nand those are their values and their\nduties\nso these are the things that you owe\npeople that you feel obliged to do like\nin service of your duty and the cool\nthing about duty is that generally\nspeaking\nnegative things\nwill prevent us from engaging in a\nbehavior unless it's aligned with duty\nso when something is hard and i want it\ni won't actually do it but when\nsomething is hard and it's my duty to do\nit i will do it so this is a really\nfundamental thing about human behavior\nthat generally speaking negative things\nwill will prevent us from engaging in a\nbehavior unless it's aligned with a duty\nand then somehow something weird and\nmagical happens and this is sort of the\nparadoxical uh raising awareness of the\nnegative this is how this kind of plays\nin that when you kind of acknowledge the\nnegative if it's kind of aligned with\nyour duty it can actually drive people\nto do it and you'll kind of recognize\nthis we see like negative manifestations\nof this in the world\nwhen we sort of like think about people\nwho have martyr complexes right so these\nare people who like because of the\nmartyr complex like they're willing to\nthey view themselves as a martyr and\nthat really drives their behavior right\ni'm willing to take one for the team i'm\nwilling to be a martyr and and even the\nidea of martyr is someone who like dies\nfor a cause right so something really\nreally powerful there that has existed\nwithin like humanity for thousands of\nyears that something about like i was\nreading about a monk for example who\nlike apparently like did some kind of\nself-immolation is political activism\nand if you kind of think about that like\nthat's absolutely insane right what\nwould drive someone to put themselves\nthrough so much public\nsuffering and like so much intense\nsuffering\nand and it's like it's because they did\nit for a reason\nso you know we would definitely don't\nself-immolate yourself you know like\nthat's a terrible idea but as coaches\nwhat we can actually help people do\nis align their goals with their duties\nand their values and the cool thing\nabout that is once you help people move\nfrom like one of those quadrants to the\nthe next quadrant\nwhat you'll see is like an increase in\nmotivation and people actually being\nable to not be held back by negative\nthings\nso we talked about the four you know the\nthe model of four different intents we\ntalked about conflict between these\ndifferent boxes and this is what\nambivalence is right so ambivalence is\nlike yeah i don't want to play this\nvideo game today but i do\nso anytime people are stuck in clients\nare stuck they're not stuck\nfor no reason they're stuck because they\nhave a goal that has a positive you know\nthing it's like yeah like i absolutely\nwant a yacht that would be awesome if i\nhad a yacht like that would be great\nit's all upside the reason i don't go\nout and get a yacht is because there's\nactually a downside and generally\nspeaking for our clients this downside\nis a little bit of a blind spot so as a\ncoach what our goal is going to be is to\nlike elevate this conflict to their\nconscious mind help them work through it\nuse evidence-based techniques like\nmotivational interviewing to help them\nget past some of their hurdles and then\nideally like help them move in the right\nbe\nright direction by clarifying their\nintent\nany questions about that\nokay\nso now what we're gonna do is talk about\nresistance so remember that um\nwhen we kind of think a little bit about\nour equation of motivation and how to\nmotivate people it starts\nmake sure that this is fixed\nthis over here and i got a\nscreen share with y'all\nokay\nthen i gotta switch to this we good can\neverybody see now\nokay\nso this is intent\nthis is resistance\nand then this is action\nso this is the first thing the first\nreason why resistance is important\nso clients will come to us and we'll say\ni know what i need to do i just can't do\nit like i'm i'm too lazy like they'll\nlook at the action over here and then\nthey'll use terms like lazy\nor undisciplined\nor unmotivated\nbut these are all umbrella terms they're\nnot like precise things that are\nhappening within us right so like even\nif i'm lazy i may study for a test on\none day and i won't study for a test\non a different day\nso it's kind of interesting because\nbehavior isn't consistent and so what\nhappens is like people come up with\nthese terms because they\nlook at their insides and they struggle\nto do something and they look at someone\nelse's outsides they observe someone\nelse's external behavior without\nunderstanding their internal conflict\nand then they compare their insights to\nother people's outsides and they they\nend up with these terms lazy\nundisciplined unmotivated\nsince these are umbrella terms and not\nreal things\nwhat what that sort of means is that\nthey're they're defining their problem\nin a way that is unactionable right\nbecause like what do you do if you're\nborn with the lazy trait you just suck\nso there are you know there is evidence\nfor example that based on the five\nfactor personality model that some\npeople are more conscientious than other\npeople so we're not saying that this is\num that there is\nthere's no such thing as lazy but i\nwould say that for ninety percent of the\nclients that i've worked with who\ndescribe themselves as lazy maybe even\nmore than that\nit's not that they're lazy or\nunmotivated it's that their motivation\nis in a different direction from where\nthey want it to be and there's a process\nthat like you know you can use to sort\nof uncover someone's motivation uncover\nsomeone's discipline and like help them\nbe less lazy\nso what really gets in the way is\nresistance okay so what's y'all's\nexperience of like resistance with a\nclient do you guys like know what that\nmeans\nlike how would you know if a client is\nresistant what kind of stuff would you\nhear them say\nvery good so let's start with the signs\nof resistance how do we detect\nresistance i want to\ncomma but dot dot dot\nwhat else\nhow do you detect resistance in a client\nit's hard\nexcellent what else\ni can't\nvery good\ni can't\nwhat else\nvery good i'm not that\nwhat else\noh it's not possible\nvery good\nwhat else\ni don't know how very good\nwhat else\ni don't know if this like it's but\nsometimes you can see it on my face it's\nlike\ni don't know\ngreat great\nokay\nyeah so let's that's excellent so\nlet's think about so then you kind of\nask like what's that a right so what do\nyou think what else y'all are doing\nfantastic by the way\nhello\nhello\num\noh no sorry streamlabs was muted\nokay\nit's unmuted now\nlet me uh coaches can you have a call oh\ni understand what's going on now\nno they're fine it's because\nthey're picking up stream labs is\npicking up my speakers\noh like they're just like not\nokay\ni i think i figured it out should be\nfine now\ncan i say something test okay one two\nthree it's not possible\ngreat we good\nokay\nokay so i'll give you all a couple\nothers okay there's no point\nand then we get to some subtle ones\nit won't be enough\nokay\nit'll be a waste of time\nif it doesn't work\nhow do i know\nit'll work\nyou all see this\nuh another one so you said i\ni can't but i think another kind of\nmanifestation of this is like\ni'm different\nfrom other people\nwith this problem\nyou all heard that one\nlike other people may be able to fix\nthis but i can't\nbecause i'm different\nso let's kind of think about\nso let's actually start by kind of\noutlining today so here's you know our\nfirst thing is to remind us of our\ngeneral model the second thing we're\ngoing to talk about is signs of\nresistance which we've just done\nso like you know there's something\nthat's driving this statement the third\nthing that we're going to do is try to\nfigure out where does this resistance\ncome from so what's the origin of\nresistance\num and then as we sort of highlight the\ndifferent origins of resistance so it's\ngoing to be manas\nahamkar\nokay\nthen we're gonna sort of teach y'all a\nlittle bit about how to manage\nthese different things so how do we fix\nthese problems in people\nokay so coach interventions\nand remember that the the key goal of\nthis this kind of curriculum and this\nteaching is not necessarily to give you\nall techniques you'll always certainly\nsee those in the manuals and stuff i\nthink this kind of explicit knowledge\ncan certainly be useful right so once\nyou all know what resistance looks like\nexplicitly it'll help you pick it up\nmore easily\nbut to help you develop a good\ntheoretical framework so that when\nsomeone comes in with a unique problem\nthat we haven't prepped you for you\nunderstand the principles of the game\nokay\nand so the other key thing to remember\nhere is that i would say that\nresistance is the most important\ncontribution that you can make\nlike clients are pretty good i think\nclients can be good at figuring out\ntheir own intents you can use uh\nprocesses like journaling and stuff like\nthat to figure out your own intent\nyou can even use like tips like action\nplanning and like tips for you know how\nto set appropriate goals i think those\nare pretty um you know accessible for\nself work\npart of the reason that we emphasize\nresistance so much for coaches is\nbecause this is the thing that it's the\nhardest for clients to do on their own\nand the reason for that is this is what\ntheir thought process manifests as\nbut this is not the problem right this\nis the manifestation of the resistance\nwhich is actually coming from these\nthree things\nso i'd say resistance is the biggest\nblind spot for our clients and therefore\nyou are the best at sort of fixing it\nso let me ask you all something have you\nall ever tried to play chess against\nyourself\nyes\nyeah how does that work super difficult\nwhat's hard about playing chess against\nyourself\nbecause you know the other players moves\nexactly right so like how much can you\nlearn how much can you discover new\nthings about playing chess through\nplaying chess against yourself versus\nplaying against a different person\nyou're limited by your own perspective\nso it's really hard to discover anything\nnew\nand this is why\ncoaching like so this is why the main\nvalue ad you have is in resistance\nbecause you can sort of figure out\nintent on your own you can figure out\nactions and goal setting on your own\nbut\ndiscovering your own resistance is like\nplaying a game of chess against yourself\nbecause it's the same mind that's in\nconflict you guys get that there's like\nif we look at the resistance i want this\nright that's me being white in terms of\nthe chess pieces right so that's me\nplaying on the white side of the board\nand then there's the black side of the\nboard but the second i spin that that\nchess board around and start playing\nfrom the opposing viewpoint it's\nactually one mind that's like generating\nboth of the move sets so discovery\nbecomes very very hard and like tricking\nyourself\nin chess is like really hard because you\nknow exactly what the other person's\nthinking all of the thoughts are coming\nfrom the same place so it's very hard to\nmake a discovery\nso if y'all take nothing else away from\nthe training really try to focus on\ntoday\nin the importance of today because as\ncoaches the whole point is that you are\nable to recognize your clients blind\nspots you're able to decipher these\nthings which they're not going to be\nable to decipher within themselves and\npart of this is you know there's good\nscience behind this as well so these\nalso include things like cognitive\nbiases\nright so this also includes things like\nschemas from cognitive behavioral\ntherapy\num so like i'm different from other\npeople is a cognitive bias\ni can't is a cognitive bias there's no\npoint is a cognitive bias and it's\nreally hard for human beings to see\ntheir own cognitive biases they may be\nable to see them after a fashion but\nit's not really like\nit's not a true sight i don't know how\nelse to put this like you know when\nyou're when you're playing chess against\nyourself and you do something sneaky\nyou can even tell yourself in your mind\ni'm gonna pretend like i don't know what\nthe other half of me is doing have you\nall ever done that when you play chess\nagainst yourselves like you're gonna\npretend\nright you're gonna be like okay like i'm\nnot gonna detect that right away because\nif i was playing white in this situation\ni wouldn't see what black was trying to\ndo\nso i'm going to like let black i'm going\nto kind of bait myself into it i'm going\nto let myself fall into the trap so\npeople can kind of recognize their\ncognitive biases in the same way on some\nintellectual level they can recognize it\nthey can recognize it from an explicit\nmemory standpoint\nright\nthey can sort of understand it\ninformationally but they can't\nunderstand it implicitly they can't get\nneon of it\nbecause it's all coming from the same\nmind\nokay\nso now\nare there any questions about that\nokay so y'all are pretty familiar you\nall feel pretty good about like\nrecognizing signs of resistance or do\nyou think we need to talk more about\nthat\ni'm pretty comfortable okay great so now\nlet's try to think a little bit about\nwhere does this resistance come from\num there's a question in chat so\nself-coaching is impossible even with\nawareness you all see like this is a\nclassic example so i'm not saying it's\nimpossible\ni'm just saying it's\nway harder\nand the second thing is just the fact\nthat this person so this is what happens\nright so\npeople will amplify\ncertain things and like ask the question\nabout whether it's impossible like do\nyou guys see that there's like there's\nlike even in that question there's like\na drive i don't know how else to put\nthat do you all see what i'm saying\nlike do you guys get those kinds of\nquestions so who can explain what's\ngoing on behind that question\nthere's like a hopelessness like it\nwon't work for me\nlike do you mean that like this won't\nwork for me\nyeah so it can be that way but what i'd\nsort of guess from that that person's\nperspective is that they're resistant to\nengage in coaching and they're like\nasking for a yes or no question that\nwill give them license to not try\ncoaching you all see that\nright because like i'm not going to say\nit's impossible they're like okay great\nso i can do it like i don't need\ncoaching easy i can do it on my own\nright so it's so interesting how\npeople's\nquestions like can even be a sign of\nresistance\num anyway so let's i'm gonna try to\nignore chat so let's kind of move on so\nwhere do you guys think this\nresistance comes from let's move on to\nstep three\norigins of resistance\nand i know i've sort of given you all\nthe answer but let's kind of walk\nthrough it\nso where do you all think these\nstatements come from\nsome scars\nokay what's the sum scar\nundigested emotion\nokay so like\nyeah\nokay maybe from like a past experience\nokay past experience\nso help me understand how past\nexperience leads to one of these\nstatements\nwell if it happens before then your mind\nwill predict that it'll happen again um\nand then you feel less likely to succeed\nmaybe\nokay so which one of these statements\neli what do you think would come from a\npast experience or some stock\num i think maybe like it'll be a waste\nof time or how do i know if it'll work\nperfect right it'll be a waste of time\nbecause they've had a past experience\nwhere they tried something\nand it didn't work and therefore their\nbrain logically concludes\nright because like our brain is pretty\nsmart if i try to reset my sleep\nschedule\nthree times and i fail after 24 hours\nall three times what is my brain gonna\ntell me i can't reset my sleep schedule\ni'm different from other people other\npeople can reset their sleep schedule\nbut it'll be a waste of time for me\nand therefore they stop trying that's\nthe resistance and they never act\nexcellent\nso and remember that undigested emotions\nso i think some scars and past\nexperiences go hand in hand right so\nwhat tends to happen with the some scar\nhow does it what's the relationship\nbetween a past experience and a some\nscar who can explain it\nit builds an identity\nokay so we'll get to identity in a\nsecond\nso what's the relationship between past\nexperience and some scar\nso some scar would be the emotion\nassociated with the experience compared\nto the past experience like it could\nalso just be a pattern that the brain\nhas picked up on\nexcellent right so this is what happens\nwe have past experience\ni got dumped\nand that comes with emotion\nand then what happens is after i get\ndumped i distract myself\ni'ma play a game i'm getting hammered\nand then that emotion goes dormant\nand then what happens\nis our brain our buddhi\nscans the\npresent and the next time i get into a\nrelationship it's like hey we've done\nthis before you remember what happened\nlast time and then i engage in the\nrelationship\nsome scar activates\nand then the emotion returns\nand then even though i'm dating someone\nnew\ni feel\nlike i'm gonna get dumped\nand then since i feel like i'm gonna get\ndumped\ni'm gonna say\num let's think about how that would\nmanifest\ni don't know if this relationship is\ngoing to work even though i want it to\nwork and i like the person i'm dating\nright\nand what's driving that is this emotion\nthat returns we good there\nand so then what happens is each\nexperience so we can have experience\nnumber one experience number two and\nexperience number three and each of\nthose will elevate the negative emotion\nand over time the sum scar will become\nvery strong and then i'll never date\nagain\nokay and so that emotion kind of returns\nvery good\nso let's talk um so y'all can kind of\nsee that like\nyou know what do you think are the\nemotions that relate what do you think\nare like let's list out the emotions\nthat relate to these statements so what\ndo you think that our clients feel\nthat cause them to be resistant to\ntaking action\nhere\nexcellent what else\nhurt\nyep\nshame\nexcellent\nwhat else\npressure embarrassment\npressure yeah embarrassment what else or\ndoing great\nthere's more come on\nguilt yep\nalienated\nyep\ngood appreciation\nyeah now we're getting there\nthere's a valence of emotion that y'all\njust scratching the surface of\nwhat else\nwhat's in the frustration bucket\npowerless yeah\nwhat else\nhopelessness good\nwhat else\ndefeated\nsure\nresentment\nwhat would you say\nlonely\nlonely absolutely\nresentment\nanger\nright there's a lot of that stuff in\nthere\nand so here's the thing\nespecially for our population that's\nrelatively lexa-thymic they're not going\nto be aware of this\nlike when they think about let's say i\nwant to become financially independent\nmove out of my parents house\nthis is not what they associate that\ngoal with\nbut if i want to move out of my parents\nhouse\nthat means that i'm living where\nand if i'm living with my parents at my\nage what emotions come with that\nshame\nabsolutely right all of the above\nand so the challenge is that you know\nthey look at the goal right and they're\nlike oh yeah like i want to move out\ni'ma be independent like it's going to\nbe so great\nbut\nthere's no point\ni've tried it\nbefore okay other signs of resistance\ni just need to figure out\nthis is a big one\nright i just need to figure out i'll be\nready when\nwhen oh i'll ask this person out after i\nlose 20 pounds\ni'll apply for a job when i've had\nsomething\nreasonable to put on my resume\nyou know i want to take this course\nbefore i do this\nright these are all signs\nsorry where would we put the idea of\nlike\nnot willing to start until there's a\nguarantee of success\nbeautiful we'll get there\nokay right so did we not get there at\nall\nokay\nyeah i'll i'll be ready i'll stick it\nwith i'll be righty when\nokay so and let's just talk about that\nfor now so i you know i'll i'll i'll\napply when i'm sure that my application\nis perfect\nso what are we trying what is that\nperson like\nwhere what's the emotional valence like\nhow does that work why does someone say\nthat to themselves and what's going on\nemotionally in that person\ni would imagine that they predict like a\nthere'd be a really strong negative\nexperience if it didn't work out so they\nwant to make sure that it does work out\nto avoid that\nexactly\nwell said right in a nutshell\nso i cannot afford to feel the negative\nconsequence of the rejection\ntherefore i'm gonna stack the deck in my\nfavor to make sure that i don't get hurt\nit is avoidance of emotion\nmotivates\nour clients\nto\nstay\nstuck\nokay this is a key concept which i think\nyou'll all already understand y'all get\nthat\nso like it's kind of interesting so now\nwe understand like the origin of\nresistance is absolutely this negative\nemotion\nbut like\nthey're highly motivated to do nothing\nright so we have to understand that as\ncoaches\nthat this is not someone who's lazy\nthey're actually quite dedicated\nyou know like you have to you have to\nwork really hard and you have to you\nhave to emotionally suppress\na lot of shame to keep playing video\ngames all day long when you're like 26\nand going nowhere in life\ni had an interesting so i run a group\nfor esports professionals\nand one day we had this kind of random\ntangent\nbut like we were talking about like\ntoxicity in pub games\nand like i don't know if you guys are\nkind of familiar with this but like you\nknow if you watch like streaming and\nstuff and you watch like pro gamers who\nstream\nthey're like you know let's say like the\ntop tier pros or like maybe the 100 best\nplayers in the world\nbut then there are people who will play\nwho will be like rank like 200 to 600\nand just imagine what it feels like to\nbe like a rank 200 person\nright you've dedicated 10 years of your\nlife you're one of the best 200 people\nin the world\nand you never go to even a tier 2\ntournament\nand like what does it feel like to be\nthat person\nand so it's kind of interesting because\nyou know when when we're trying to\nunderstand like the toxicity of those\nplayers like understanding what their\ninternal emotional state is like makes\nso much more sense\nbecause like you know what what's their\nprospects for the future like they don't\nreally have much right if i've spent if\ni'm i've had i'm i've if i've been\nplaying dota for about 10 years\nand i'm trying to go pro and i haven't\nmade it yet like what is gonna happen\nyou know so i think that a lot of times\nif you think about people like our\nclients who feel really stuck and by the\nway stock doesn't necessarily have to\nmean living in your mom's basement right\nso stock can mean like\nbeing in a relationship that you don't\nthink is the right one for you but\nyou're afraid to leave because you're\nafraid that this is the best it's gonna\nget\nso you try really really really hard to\nmake this relationship work even though\nall the signals are saying you should\ngtfo\nbut you're not sure if you can find\nsomeone else that can be resistance\nresistance can be like successfully\nhaving like a good job where you make\nsix figures a year\nbut\nyou're not really happy on a day-to-day\nbasis and you feel burnt out and you're\nnot really sure like how to make a\nchange in your life\nyou know and you kind of spend your days\nlooking at instagrams of people who have\nquit their job and traveling the world\nbut you don't have the balls to do it\nyou know because that would be stupid it\nwould be throwing away everything that i\nbuilt\nsometimes in our content creator program\nwe'll get streamers who need to take a\nbreak and can't take a break\nhave you all anyone here from content\ncreator program\nyeah so steve have you encountered that\nyeah i've had a couple creators who\nvery much fall into that basket of like\ni'm not allowed to have\nbad feelings because i'm a successful\nstreamer right i'm not allowed to take a\nbreak because\ni made it and if i leave i'll never be\nheard from again\nright so if they're not allowed to have\nbad feelings where do those feelings go\nsteve\nwhen they have bad feelings\nuh\nthey they get turned into some scars\nabsolutely and then some scars do what\nin terms of their life how does it\naffect their life\nuh it recurs and grows over time and\nmakes everything harder so what\nabsolutely so that's that's the key\nthing so like this crap is there you've\npurchased this crap by your actions and\nyour circumstances\nand then the more that we suppress it it\ngoes dormant and then manifests as\nresistance\nshows up looking like this\nand the interesting thing is that if you\nlook at these statements there's no\nemotion in these statements\nright\ni want to but uh it's hard i can't\nit's logical here are all of the reasons\nwhy i can't let me use logic\ni'm a different kind of person that\napplies to other people but not to me\nonce again logic it's not possible logic\nlogic logic logic logic logic\nbut buried beneath it is emotion and\nthese people stay stuck because these\nbeliefs the the energy that drives these\nbeliefs is purely emotional\nokay\nso it could be some scars emotions\nyou know so this is one of the key\norigins of resistance now let's talk\nabout a hum god\nso what is a hamkar\nthe sense of i right\noh [ __ ]\nso\nwhat happens over time\nis as we develop negative experiences\nand among us\nwe develop an ego that actually protects\nus from our negative emotions so\nremember that the ego is the bouncer of\nthe mind so when we feel an insecurity\nwhat does the ego do\nwhat are the signs that the ego is\nactive\ncomparison put other people up\nvery good\ncomparison\nwhat else\nmaybe like logic or over explaining\nyep\nuh so i'm gonna call it bullying buddhi\nso we'll explain that in a second\num\ngets bullied\nwhat else\nor let's just i guess let's talk about\nthat now so remember that when someone\nis egotistical\nthey will take their intellect or their\nlogic and they'll bully it into crafting\na logical story that supports their\nviewpoint\nso we see this all the time in politics\nwe see this all the time in terms of\nlike psychological defense mechanisms\nright like people will jud like\njustifications and rationalizations are\ngood examples of this in like western\npsychology so oh yeah it's not my fault\nthat i cheated on my partner my partner\nwasn't emotionally available to me so\nwhat choice did i have\nright it's a rationalization i didn't do\nanything wrong they drove me to do it i\nhad no choice\nand if you try to logically argue with\nthat person you won't get anywhere so\nthe tricky thing about the home guard\nyou can also see this all over the\ninternet like you look at any argument\non the internet my favorite is like\nlooking at when you have these like\npeople arguing about like strategies and\ngames and like they'll say like oh this\nis a dumb idea\nand they'll just like argue against each\nother for until the end of time\nand usually like one of them's an idiot\nthey'll never recognize it and then you\ncould tell by the down votes because\nlike one person has like a bunch of\nupvotes and one person has a bunch of\ndown votes\nright so you could see this this\nattitude all the time where everyone\nbelieves they're logical but it's\nactually their ahamkada that's bullying\ntheir intellect\ninto\nyou know presenting something that they\nbelieve is logical\nwhat else does the\nuh hum guard do\nthere's one more thing\nwhat do noobs on the internet do when\ntheir logic is refuted\nput themselves up put others down\nabsolutely right\nso pump\nthemselves up\nwhen i say something stupid on the\ninternet\nand someone and i don't have a logical\nleg to stand on\ni'll be like 1v1 mid let's go noob\nwhat are you one kmmr i'm 2k mmr i'm 1.1\nkmr who the hell are you like shut the\nhell up\ni'm so much better\nright put other people down\nso we also see this in esports in a very\ninteresting way so sometimes we'll have\na team who's an underdog\nand the underdog knows that they're an\nunderdog so what do they do\nthey start ramping themselves up in\ntheir mind and like\ncrapping mentally on the team that\nthey're about to play against\nit's kind of interesting so they'll be\nlike oh like they're not that great he's\nnot all that we're better they're worse\nand instead actually what leads to the\nbest outcomes is not doing that\nself-psychological like psyching up\nprocess but acknowledging hey this team\nis better than we are\nwe're not favored in this matchup but if\nwe play our best game we can actually\nwin\nit's going to be an uphill battle\nand generally speaking we see the best\nperformance when teams adopt that\nattitude and remove a hum card from the\nequation\nokay\nso\nwe can also see this\num\nso which of these statements comes from\nahamkar\ni've tried\nokay i've tried this before\ni'm not that\nyeah this is the big one right what else\nnot possible\nuh okay\nsure\nso here's what i'd say if you just look\nat the subject\nright so like some of these\nlike some of these include i\ni'm different from other people i'm not\nthat\nand some of these are like externally\npointed\nright there's no point now this may be a\nhum car too because if i view myself as\na failure\nthen there's no point\nyou'll see that so this is good i mean\nthe truth is that any of these\nstatements can be coming from manus or\nahmgar and remember that the two\nintertwine right it's not like manus or\nhamkar time you have negative emotion in\nthe monastery is going to activate so\nthe two play hand in hand\nbut in short sometimes what's going to\nhappen is our clients will have a sense\nof identity that prevents them from\nacting\nand what do i mean by that um\nor do you all understand what i mean by\nthat what do you all think\nlike they've maybe built a construct of\nthemselves that doesn't align with them\nsucceeding\nabsolutely that's beautifully put right\nso this is the kind of thing where like\noh disciplined people could do this\nbut i can't do it because i'm not\ndisciplined and as long as they have\nthat belief there\ntheir likelihood of success is going to\nbe very very low right so this is why\nlike you'll have these like you know\nfeel good success blogs that's like have\nfaith in yourself\nyou know develop confidence in yourself\nlike if you look at like you know pick\nup or or red pill kind of stuff right\nthey're like you got to present\nconfidence because like women are\nattracted to confidence just be\nconfident bro here's how you become\nconfident\nyou know so it's sort of this idea that\nlike the who we are factors into our\nperception of success and so we have a\npart of our brain that basically does\nthis calculation which is like you know\ngain\nminus loss\ntimes\npercent\nof success\nso this is a an equation that our brain\nis running all the time\nand so like what happens is if i have an\nidentity that views me as a failure and\nthis number goes down\nmy motivation is going to be very very\nlow\nright\nso\nthese are the two major sources or three\nmajor sources of resistance so now the\nquestion becomes how do we help clients\nwith manas and a hum god\nor some scott and ahm god\nwhat's our plan just a quick question\nfor the gain minus loss equation does\nthat equal motivation or resistance\num\nthat's a good question let me think\nabout that\ni would say like this is this\ncalculation results in action or\ninaction\nis what's on the right side of the equal\nsign\nuh i'd say it's like percent likelihood\nof action\ni may need to\num redeem myself tomorrow once i think\nabout it\nbut i think that's what we're talking\nabout\ni think it should be fair\ndoes that make sense to y'all\nwas that a mistake\nthe likelihood of action i think is what\nwe're talking about here\nokay\nso\nwhat do we do\nwith mana samskara\nhow do we\nhow do we manage these as coaches\ni'm thinking maybe with the modest you\ncan change their\nperceptions of like each of those\nvariables\nokay very good right so the first thing\nthat we can do is when you say change\ntheir perception i'm going to divide\nthat into two pieces one is we can\nuncover emotion\nright so their perception\nis like this statement\nso in order to change their perception\nwhat we have to do is uncover the\nemotion and once you've uncovered the\nemotion then you can start to metabolize\nit\nright so this is what we call emotional\ncatharsis\nit's what we call the aha moment\nas well that's maybe more neon but the\ntwo go hand in hand\nso like and this is also where things\nbecome implicit memory\nfrom a scientific perspective\nand when they become nyan from a\nspiritual perspective\nokay\nso uncovering emotion is the first step\nthe second thing that we can do is\nredirect their neuronal pathway\nso what i mean by that\nis our neurons tend to\nform grooves almost like game trails so\nthere's a there's a saying in in\nneuroscience that neurons that fire\ntogether wire together\nso generally speaking human beings will\nhave like scripts running in their mind\nright so when i like play a game of dota\nfor example\ni will like automatically do particular\nthings and that's because my brain is\nlike it's run this script before\nand even when it comes to motivation and\ngoal setting and taking action our brain\nis running these scripts\noh i'll do it when i'm ready\nhow do i know it'll work\nit'll like run into this auto script\nand as we uncover awareness of the\nemotion and start to metabolize it\nwe can red redirect their thinking in a\nmore positive way so instead of like\nevery day they wake up and they think oh\ni should study today i should study a\nday and those neurons become like well\ngrooved and will start to like become\neasier and easier to access those\nthoughts and so the analogy that i like\nto use is a game trail so imagine that i\nhave a field of like wheat like\nhigh grass okay\nso once a deer walks down that high\ngrass and then it starts to like form\nlike a very small pathway the next day a\ndifferent deer walks by and it looks at\nall the tall grass and it says oh there\nseems to be one spot that's a little bit\ntrampled so it walks down that way as\nwell\nthird day a third deer comes by tramples\nthe grass a little bit more and now\nsuddenly the grass has been trampled so\nmuch that a rabbit can even walk down it\nyou don't have to be a deer and then a\nfield mouse and then lots of animals\nstart to use the game trail and so over\ntime\nthe way that we start thinking becomes\nmore and more solidified\nso by using questions and reflections\nwe can take a stuck client and get them\nto think about things in a new way oh\nmaybe the reason that you're not able to\ndo it isn't because you're incompetent\nit actually has to do with like you have\nan immense amount of shame that is\nholding you back it's almost like your\nbrain is trying to protect you from\nbeing hurt because every time you've\ndone this before you've gotten\nabsolutely destroyed\nso i could totally see why you wouldn't\nwant to do it again\nand oddly enough that interpretation and\nsort of helping people like reinterpret\ntheir understanding\nwill actually redirect their neuronal\npathways and start to catalyze change\nand y'all may have seen that in terms of\nclients you've worked with where like\nyou know they come in with a certain\nconception and this is the real\nchallenge with goal setting because like\nthey come in with a particular goal but\ntheir goal is based off of this\nstatement\nright it's based on this understanding\nit's not based on this\nand so oftentimes the goals that they'll\ncome in with this is tricky\nneed to be reworked to things that are\nactually more appropriate and address\nthe obstacles that they face instead of\nwhere they want to go and that's the\nbiggest problem with goals is that our\nclients are here\nthey want to go here so they say\nlet's get here but what they ignore is\nlike what's the wall in the way because\nthe real goal is removing this\nthis is what's keeping you from getting\nto you to where you want to go\nso in terms of decompressing them on us\nit starts by raising awareness\nand uncovering the emotion metabolizing\nthe emotion so that that emotional\nenergy is not as strong and therefore\nwill decrease that resistance hump right\nif this is the resistance hump once you\nmetabolize emotion\nit goes from here to here and then it's\neasier for them to do and when you fully\nmetabolize the some scar this is what it\nlooks like and then action is actually\nvery easy to obtain\nand once people get to this state\nthis is why if you ask someone who's\nhighly motivated\nthey're not actually like super fired up\nthey just do it easily it's easy for\nthem\nit becomes easy and this is what we see\nwith our clients when we metabolize\nemotions as they come in one week and\nthey're like yeah i did it and it's like\nwhat\nhow did you do it it was so hard for you\na month ago how did it become easy and\nthey're like i don't know\ni just did it\ni just realized so we see this in in\naddiction recovery as well where you\nknow reasons to quit and there's a lot\nof resistance\nand then once we get the emotions down\nhere\nwhat people will say is i just realized\ni have to quit\none day i woke up and i knew enough was\nenough\nand so that process actually has like a\nvery real\nneuroscientific psychological\nspirit not really spiritual but really\nneuroscientific and psychological\nunderpinning to it and this is\nbasically how it works questions about\nthat\nyeah i have a question about the\nredirecting neural pathways is that\nsomething that kind of just happens\nnaturally over like reflective listening\nand like do they just kind of like\nnaturally start to question their own\nlike belief system or like\nyeah so it doesn't happen naturally\nso if you just randomly like\nreflectively listen\nit's not going to be sufficient so this\nis where asking\nopen-ended questions is important\nso i want you all to understand this for\na second so here's our client\nhere's what they know\nand kind of hears what they\nand based on what they know\nthey're not able to achieve their goals\nin order to achieve their goal this is\nwhat they need to know\nso our work as coaches is on this\nbarrier right here\nso you ask like they're like oh yeah\nlike they come in you say okay why are\nyou stuck and they're going to give you\na bunch of answers\nand then you're going to ask them an\nopen-ended question right you're going\nto notice something you're going to\nnotice some kind of discrepancy we'll\nget to that into that in a second then\nyou're going to ask them a question and\nyou're going to like extend them over\nhere and then this is going to be the\nnew barrier of their knowledge\nand then you're going to ask another\nimportant question and it's going to get\nover here\nright and you're going to ask another\nimportant question and it's going to get\nover here\nand remember that reflective listening\ncan move you in this direction too\nright so what's the like what's the goal\nof reflective listening why do we\nreflect if we listen\nwhat does a client do after you do\neffective reflective listening\nmaybe like whatever emotion they had\nkind of gets amplified a little bit\nabsolutely right it uncovers stuff\nright so\nthis barrier gets advanced through\nopen-ended questions and reflective\nlistening\nand this is also why we sometimes ask\nyou you know like what will like\nthis kind of read my mind question but\nwhen you have a client who's on the\nbrink of leaving and quitting coaching\nwhat should you do\nvalidate work like\nsort of\nthat's not actually what i advocate most\nof the time when you all feel that way\nbecause you all have been doing that\ndon't isn't it don't we um throw what we\ncall like a hail mary absolutely so help\nme understand why that's important brian\num well it's\nkind of important because it's\nwe kind of like step out what we would\nnormally do as a coach and we kind of\nlike put everything like on the table\nlike and more or less we kind of like\nstep\nnot like review what we say but like hey\nthis is what i'm seeing and like here's\nthe situation and like we just like lay\nit on them\nabsolutely right so what what what a\nhail mary is\nis they're right here and they're stuck\nand coaching is not working for them and\nwhat we're gonna do is like point this\nout to them and it's almost like a\ntraumatic shift\nand it's like hey so in the past i\nunderstand that coaching is not working\nfor you\nand that you want to quit\nso in the past\nwhen things aren't working for you\nis your usual response to quit\nthis is precisely why you can't quit\nbecause every time when things don't\nwork out you don't persevere and you're\njust doing it again\nright their interpersonal pathology\nthey'll bring into coaching\nand so that's your opportunity to say\nthat like look i know this hasn't been\nworking i'd like to work on it i'd like\nto figure this out and if you're with me\ni'm confident that we can do it\nand i can see why you're concerned like\ni can see why you're complaining because\ni haven't done the best job maybe i\nshould have been doing this maybe i\nshould have been doing this and at the\nsame time like you're asking me for\nsuggestions and i'm giving them to you\nand then you don't actually try them and\nthen you conclude that it isn't working\nso like what do you want to do at this\npoint if you want to quit you're more\nthan welcome to like i'm seriously like\nmaybe it's not a good fit\nbut i really like here's what i'm seeing\nin terms of your patterns and what you\ntend to do and so you kind of like lay\nit all out there you kind of toss out a\nhail mary and usually so then it sort of\nhappens it's like the testing moment\neither either you catch the pass and you\nscore a touchdown or it fumbles and\nthey're gg'ed out\nbut remember that our job as coaches is\nto help them\nnot keep them there and so sometimes\ndesperate times call for desperate\nmeasures and if you need to throw a hail\nmary you need to throw a hail mary\nokay but generally speaking our goal is\nto you know use these techniques to help\nthem understand\nyou know how emotions are actually\ncontrolling them\nand then once they understand how\nemotions are controlling them they then\nthey can start to work on it and then\ntheir chance of like engaging in action\ngoes up\ndoes that make sense jake\nokay\nso um i recognize that we started late\ntoday it's 12 15. so if you all need to\nstep out you're all welcome to otherwise\ni'll try to wrap up in 15 minutes is\nthat cool\nokay\nso now let's talk about a hump car so\ni'll kind of speed run this a little bit\nso as you all have already said as\npeople pile up with emotions what they\nend up doing is forming identities of\nthemselves\nand oftentimes this identity destroys\ntheir motivation\nright so like in cells are a good\nexample of this\nwhere if you think about the in-cell\nidentity there are all kinds of things\nabout the identity that like\nprotects people like do we form this\nidentity for a reason\nokay so like other examples are like\npeople with a victim complex\nright so this is another protective\nidentity\nbecause if i'm always the victim and the\nworld is a mean place and i'm dealing\nwith tons of you know like everyone's\nbeing unfair to me\nwhat does that protect me from\nthe emotions which ones let's be more\nspecific okay\nthe shame of i'm wrong\nabsolutely not even the shame\nit protects you from i'm wrong\nbecause if you're a victim who's at\nfault\nabsolutely anyone but me\nright so we can see like why people form\nvictim complexes\nbecause they're incredibly protective\nthey're protect like you never have to\ntake responsibility as long as you're\nthe victim\nyou know i'm not saying that victim\nvictims don't exist like absolutely\npeople are victims\nand this is the real challenge is that\neven as a psychiatrist right like when\nyou're dealing with someone with trauma\nit's really trickier if you're dealing\nwith someone with mental illness for\nexample so let's say like someone with\nbipolar disorder\nthere's a very fine line\nyou have an illness do you deserve\ncompassion absolutely\ndo you deserve support absolutely do you\nsometimes get a free pass from time to\ntime absolutely\nbut\ndo you get to blame\neverything on being bipolar\nno\nand this can be very hard for people to\nunderstand\ndo you get a free pass from time to time\nabsolutely oh it wasn't my fault i was\nmanic\nand so i did a bunch of stuff like sure\nlike i can get that right people\nliterally can't control their actions\nwith their manic question is how did you\nbecome manic in the first place\ndid you stop taking your medication did\nyou start using drugs did you stop\ncoming to therapy\nso anytime there's kind of a victim\ncomplex\nyou know we have to be kind of careful\nbecause\nif the victim is sort of saying i'm\nwrong and it's uh i've been wronged and\nit's not my fault what it also means is\nthat they're giving up their agency\nthey're giving up their control\nso as a coach like for a lot of people\nwith a hum car you know we have to be\nreally really careful about\nwhat they're giving up by adopting their\nidentity\nand by pointing out to them that if you\nare are doomed to be single you're\ngiving up any kind of power that you\nhave to like enter into a relationship\nright so like in it's it's a seriously\nit's a very hard line to walk as a\nmental health professional in terms of\nlike what do you hold people accountable\nfor and what do you like give people a\npass on\nyou know a good another good example of\nthis is like people who lose their adhd\nstimulant medication\nit's like they're more likely to lose\ntheir medication because they have adhd\nand they're like impulsive and forgetful\nand at the same time like sometimes\npeople are selling it because one bottle\ncan sell for like a thousand dollars\nand so how do you know it's tough\nthe point is that they're going to form\nsome kind of identity based on their\nexperiences and as long as that identity\nis where they're operating from it's\ngonna color everything that they can try\nit's gonna color their like calculations\nabout what's gonna happen\nokay\nso how do we\ndeal with a hum car any ideas\nlike what are some techniques that you\nall have used to help people understand\nlike and overcome their omkar\nmeeting them where they are with\ncompassion okay good so meeting them\nwhere they're at\nright\nwhat else\nnoticing when it's active or not very\ngood\nnoticing the activity what else\num understanding where it came from\nexcellent\nunderstanding the origin\nokay\nso\nreflecting it back\nyep\nexcellent\nokay so now we get to like\nyou know kind of practical questions so\nlike\nwho does this make you\nso if you're trying to get\nto the aham god in a very explicit\nsense and show them this a hum god\nhow did you get to be like this\nright so this is a really important\nquestion that gets to understanding the\norigin\npoint out the double standard\nso\nonce again from our content creator\nprogram\nyou all have content creators that never\nwant to take a break and can't afford to\ntake a break\nand then you ask them hey so-and-so is\ntaking a break right now what do you\nthink about that i think it's awesome\nthey should do it\nit's really important for their mental\nhealth what do you think about you\ntaking a break oh no i can't afford that\nright so you want to point out to them\nlike oh like there's a discrepancy going\non here\nand so this is the key this is a key\ntechnique in terms of like goal setting\nis point out the discrepancy\nright so you'll get that these are\nopen-ended questions which you all\nalready know how to ask\nbut as a coach when you're targeting a\nparticular thing and you understand what\nyou're targeting it should shape your\nopen-ended question it's not a random\nreflective listening or a random\nopen-ended question you don't want to\nask an open-ended question over here and\nthen one over here you want to ask this\none then this one and then this one\nand get them in the direction that you\nneed to go so in terms of meeting them\nwhere they're at you don't ask this one\nfirst you meet them here\nyou find the barrier of their\nunderstanding\nand you extend the barrier of their\nunderstanding through like key questions\nand like statements\nand then you kind of focus on the\ndiscrepancy right like\nthis could be important for goal setting\nas well as like emotions in a humgar and\nthings like that you can ask questions\nlike how would your life be different if\nwhat would be the advantage of dot dot\ndot\nwhat would it make you feel like if you\ncould\nright the second thing that we're going\nto do\nis point out their reluctance\nso i use the word reluctance here\nslightly different from resistance so i\nthink resistance is something that we\nunderstand\nbut reluctance is a better way to frame\nthings for your clients\nbecause reluctance implies who's in\ncontrol\nwe are the coach\ni was hoping the opposite so if you kind\nof like think about\n50 50. well done jake so i when i think\nabout reluctance right so like when i\nask the question what makes you\nreluctant to go to the gym\nin my mind maybe i'm wrong here right\nbecause i screwed up ohm's law so it's\nnot like i'm right\nso this could be some weird frame that\ni've developed that doesn't actually\ntranslate makes sense for other human\nbeings happens from time to time\nbut when i think about what makes you\nreluctant to go to the gym it sort of\nimplies that the control is within the\nclient's hand\ndoes that make sense\nif not jake i'd love to hear your\nperspective because chances are you're\nright\ni felt like\nyou're reluctant because like it's like\na dog that's like reluctant to move and\nyou're like pulling it like i'm leading\nthat's right\ni see i see so i think that makes sense\nso i think once again i think it's my\nfault for not setting the stage properly\num\nyeah that's why i'm sort of using a\ndifferent word because i think what\nyou're describing is resistance\nso like if you're trying to take the\nclient somewhere and they don't want to\ngo there that's resistance\nhence the whole point so i totally get\nwhere you're coming from i think it's\nbasically you know the model that we use\nis what you sort of said so what that's\nwhy i'm sort of suggesting that y'all\nchange the word when you're talking to\nthe client\nand you kind of use like what makes you\nreluctant to go to the gym\nbecause what you're sort of saying is\nthat ultimately it's within their\ncontrol\num it's the whole reason i'm introducing\na new term because i think it's slightly\ndifferent\nso um\nand so this is where you know as you\nstart to explore their resistance like\nwhat makes you reluctant what would it\nbe like if you went to the gym\nwhat would it feel like if you could go\nto the gym how would you feel about\nyourself\nand then what does it feel like to not\nbe able to go to the gym\nyou know or do you really think\ngenuinely that you can't go to the gym\nor you think that you could go to the\ngym but something's getting in the way\nso start to ask some of these questions\nand then you know eventually you can get\nto specific questions like you try to\nfigure out is this an issue of a hum god\nor is this issue of some scott like i\nwant to go to the gym but the second i\nstep in the doors i get an overwhelming\nsense of anxiety and i want to turn\naround and run away that sounds more\nlike some scar\nwhereas because remember that the some\nscar is the activity of an emotion that\narises in your mind like suddenly and\nwith a hum guard it's sort of a sense of\nidentity and then you can try to figure\nout because each of those is going to\nhave a different approach if that sort\nof makes sense one is going to be\ncombating the subscribe in the present\nthe second is sort of like if i believe\ni'm someone who can never get healthy\nyou have to sort of\naddress that from an a hum car\nstandpoint\nokay\num the other important thing here when\ndealing with resistance\nis\nyou need to be really focused on like\nactions versus outcomes\nokay so our clients will sometimes have\nperfectionistic mindsets\nand the perfectionistic mindset comes\nfrom resistance\nso what's going to happen if they like\nhave this perfectionistic mindset and\nthey try to do something\nis that they're going to fail\nand then it's going to destroy their\nmotivation\nright decreases motivation\nso what you want to try to frame things\nas is like what i'd call the price of\ntuition\nright like emphasize that what we're\ndoing here working towards your goal is\nlike a long-term thing it's not a\nsuccess or a failure it's not even\nbinary\nwe'll we'll talk about this a little bit\nmore tomorrow but in terms of how to\nframe goals\nbut that it's a long-term engagement\nbecause it takes time to figure these\nthings out and this is where your\nattitude as a coach is going to be\nreally important because this is one of\nthe things that we do as coaches that\nyou will not recognize that you are\ndoing and your client will not recognize\nthat you are doing but you are\nabsolutely doing which is modeling\nbehavior\nso remember that just like we learned\nslang your client is going to be picking\nup things from you\nso when your client sets a goal for\nthemselves and they fail and they come\nin\nand they feel like a failure and you\ndon't treat them like a failure\nthat's gonna start to rewire their\nneurons\nright so sometimes clients will get this\nquestion how do i change my self-talk\nand the answer is by listening to\nsomeone else who like talks to you in a\ndifferent way so if we look at why why\ndo some people have negative self-talk\nit's not like random\nthey have negative self-talk because\nthey were conditioned to have negative\nself-talk they had emotionally abusive\nparents who always blame them for\neverything and so then they learned how\nto talk to themselves like in a blaming\nkind of way and so as a coach as you\nmodel\na certain approach to failure they will\nstart to like pick up on that\nand eventually what will happen remember\nthe goal of coaching is to have your\nclient no longer need to come and why is\nthat how does that work it's because the\nprocess that you do with them they're\nable to like do on their own\nright so when you kind of when they come\nin and they fail and you're like wow man\nthat sucks you're expressing empathy\nyou're expressing compassion hey by the\nway you don't have to beat yourself up\ni'm noticing that you beat yourself up\nwhat's up with that where does that come\nfrom\ni'm noticing that i'm kind of wondering\nbecause i've heard you kind of say\ncertain things you know do you sometimes\nlike are you surprised at all that you\nfailed\nbecause i've heard you say some things\nthat would make me think that like you\nwere actually expecting to fail\nthat on some deep level like you thought\nthat you were gonna fail because you are\na failure what do you think about that\nthey're like oh [ __ ] i never quite like\nyeah it's absolutely true but i never\nrealized that then you asked the next\nquestion\nif you actually believe you're a failure\nand you expect to fail what do you think\nthat does to your chances of success\nthey're like oh my god\nand then you've done something really\nmagical there\nbecause what you've managed to do is you\nmanaged to say that it's not you that's\nbeing a failure it's your belief\nthat you're a failure that causes you to\nfail\nso i want y'all to answer this question\nokay please get it right i am a failure\ni believe\ni\nam a failure\nwhich causes\nme\nto fail\nwhat's the difference between these two\nstatements\none is a fact\nabsolutely what's the other one\nthere's like distance feeling like a\nbelief yeah\ndistance\nemotion\nright\nthis is it\nwhen when your clients get distance\nwhen the facts that control their life\nbecome emotions\ntheir life can change\nhuge huge impact\nhappens subtly happens slowly happens\nbecause you model it\nokay\nso the next thing to kind of emphasize\nis that when you're dealing with\nfailures\nwhen you're dealing with clients who set\ngoals we want to focus as coaches on\npatterns\nnot outcomes\nokay so this is going to be one of the\nways that we kind of become action\noriented\nbut like asking your clients like what's\nthe pattern here\nso i'll give you guys like a good\nexample of this right so someone says\nokay i want to start eating healthy i'm\ngoing to adopt a diet i did it for four\ndays and then i screwed up i couldn't\neven last a week i failed gg i suck i\ncan't diet i'm undisciplined i'm lazy\nright so what we want to notice is like\nwhat's the pattern like what why were\nyou able to succeed for four days and\nthen what happened on day five what\nhappened on day four\nso i am a failure\nas you look at the pattern\noh like\num you know my mom called me and like\nyelled at me because\nyou know she thought i was a terrible\nperson and on day five i ate whatever i\nbroke my diet or i stayed up late too\nlate playing video games\nand i was like three in the morning and\ni got the munchies\nor my friends came over and we all got\nhigh\nand then i got the munchies\nright so like as you point out the\npatterns and things\nthis is important because the\nresponsibility of the success or the\nfailure no longer is in the person\nit has to do with the actions or the\nenvironment\nand then what happens is as you guys\nlike point out these patterns instead of\noh you're just you're lazy and you suck\nat life oh like that's interesting so it\nseems like\nyou're able to diet fine unless you're\nsmoking pot\nwhat do you think about that\nand then what we kind of get to is like\nthen we're going to kind of enter the\nrealm of motivational interviewing\nwhat's more important\ndieting\nor getting high\nand then what you'll uncover is actually\ngetting highs more important because i\nhave anxiety\nand so then what they're actually\nchoosing they don't realize this right\nthey're like oh i just suck\nbut what they're actually choosing is\ndieting versus anxiety\nor dieting versus\nsocial interaction\nand it's like well no wonder you don't\ndiet\nand once you say that to them it's like\na light bulb goes off oh it's not just\nbecause i'm an idiot it's like oh\nthere's an actual cost\nand then you can work on clarifying the\nintent and you can overcome the\nresistance and then they'll actually die\nright you can start to set appropriate\ngoals the goal is not to diet because as\nlong as your friends are coming over and\nyou're getting high there's no point in\ndieting but this is what they do right\nthey focus on the goal they're like i\nneed to lose weight i need a diet and\nthen they beat themselves up when they\nfail whereas they don't realize that the\nreason they're failing is because\nthey're getting high and getting the\nmunchies\nso if you really want to succeed what\nyou have to focus on is setting limits\naround marijuana use and like seeing\nthose friends or you need to focus on\ngetting sober first\nor what you want to do is conclude hey\ni'm not willing to do that i\nlike my friends and i like getting high\nso it's cool so then like let's forget\nabout dieting and then pick something\nelse that you want to work on\nright and then if you say okay then\nlet's forget about dieting what are they\ngonna do\nthey're gonna resist that absolutely\nright what are they going to say\nwhoa whoa whoa no i want to do that\nand then so when they say whoa whoa what\ncomes next\ni don't want to give it up\nwhoa whoa whoa i don't\nwant\nto\ngive\nup\ndieting\nwhat the [ __ ] that's where motivation\ncomes from you have done your job as a\ncoach because they came in saying i want\nto diet but i don't want to die\nand now through this verbal jiu-jitsu\nwhich is what most of like these mi\ntechniques are\nthey're telling you i don't want to give\nup dieting hold on a second i'm not\nready to give up on that goal well\nand and you know don't show them don't\nshow them that you've tricked them into\nbeing motivated\ngotta be sneaky\nand then you're like wait\nwhy don't you want to give it up\nhelp me understand that oh clarification\nof intent reinforcing stuff as they\nstart to voice and they start to tell\nyou well it's important to me because of\nthis this this all those statements are\ngoing to build motivation\nright what about dieting is important to\nyou because and this is where like it\nall ties together desires\nvalues\nthe pot is up here\nwhat do you care about right and as you\nhave that conversation you're gonna move\nthem from here to here y'all see that\nbeautiful\nokay\nall right so the last thing that we're\ngonna kind of end up with is remember\nthat this is a high-level kind of\nprinciple\nthat your job as a coach is to be the\nbuddhi for your clients\nright when they're in session with you\nbuddhi is going to be stronger than\nmanas and ahamkar\nand generally speaking when we see\npositive behavioral change it's when the\nbuddhi rises to the surface\nand so this is where like we also go\nback to like vidya versus neon\nand then also like explicit versus\nimplicit memory\nbecause as you're asking these kinds of\nquestions and pointing these things out\nto them they're gonna be having like\nrevelations\nand they're gonna they're gonna start\nlike you're gonna argue with them like\nhey man i think you should stop dieting\nbecause it seems like social interaction\nand like hanging out with your friends\nis really important to you they're like\nno no i don't want to do that\nand i'm like all right explain to me why\nlike is it social interaction important\nto you yeah but dieting and blah blah\nblah blah well if i diet like then i'll\nbe more confident dating\nand so that then it kind of comes down\nto and then you kind of like you know\nlay out a specific goal which is you\nknow the next time your your friends\nwant to come over i think what you\nreally have to ask yourself is what's\nmore important to you\nseeing my friends now are like\nrecognizing that i'm taking one step\ntowards\nlike\nbeing confident myself so i can find a\nromantic partner what's more important\nto you as a person\nand once you kind of\nget down that track and you put the\nchoice to them you put the cost to them\nthey'll start to make the right choice\nquestions\ngoing back to\num\none of the things in a hom car when we\nwere talking about reluctance\nit sounded a lot like that was\nreluctance is\nwhere the barrier between what they know\nand need to know is\nyeah\nuh i would say\nso when i think about know and need to\nknow\ni don't really think about reluctance i\nthink about that's your job as a coach\nright so that's tha that's woody that's\nthe buddhi gap so when you talk to\nsomeone like y'all may know this even\npeople who are like watching stream will\nunderstand this that like\npeople can be stuck in from the outside\nyou can see exactly what they need to do\nthe problem is that if you go from like\nwhere you are\nwhere they are to where they need to go\nthey can't make that jump\nright you just need to stop drinking\nevery day easy\nthen all your problems will be fixed so\nthat that knowledge gap is kind of where\nyou use reflective listening like there\nmay be resistance right there but as you\nuse these kinds of questions you'll\nstart to move them along the gap\nthe issue about reluctance is a way to\naccess\nwhat their resistance is\nand it's like a question that kind of\nempowers them so the reason you want to\nsay like okay what's your reluctance\nit's\nasking that question is exploring that\nbarrier does that make sense\nbecause they haven't really thought\nabout it\nor what they've thought about is in one\ndirection but they missed something else\nbecause generally speaking if they found\nthe right answer they probably would\nhave changed\nright all of our clients have made\nprogress on their own in a thousand\ndifferent dimensions\nand so if you think about\nyou know why do they get stuck in some\nplaces and don't get stuck in other\nplaces those are the places that they\nneed you as a coach to help them sort of\nsort through\ndoes that help\nokay other questions\ni was wondering when a client's kind of\ngoing back and forth between like oh i\nwant to do something oh i don't want to\ndo something i want to give it up i\ndon't um is there any value in kind of\npointing that out to them that like\nthey're kind of flip-flopping between it\nabsolutely right so that's the whole\npoint of working with ambivalence\nis so the value of that is first of all\nthere's like a lot of like shame right\nso if i set a goal for myself and i\ndon't understand why i can't accomplish\nit i end up beating myself up\nit affects my ahamkar right if it\nsolidifies enough then i start to think\nof myself as someone who's like an idiot\ncan't do anything\nand then that in turn is going to affect\nall my neuroscientific calculations of\nsuccess\nand make me prone to not do it\nso as you start to point out to them oh\nthere's like actually a good reason to\nnot diet right because like smoking pot\nis like really important for your\nanxiety as you kind of point that out to\nthem\nthere's a lot of subtle advantages the\nfirst is that it'll break apart the\ncycle of oh i'm i suck and therefore i'm\na failure and stuff like that so it'll\nstart to chip away at it because you're\nnot stupid it's just a choice between a\nand b and we'll get to this in goal\nsetting in a second so human beings\nrespond a lot better to choices than\ndirection\nso if you want a human to like choose\nlike to actually\ndo something it's good to make a choice\nright if you want and we'll kind of get\nto this where like if someone wants to\nget in shape and you say\nokay you need to go to the gym three\ndays a week that is actually science has\nshown us research has shown us that that\nis not as effective as asking someone\nhey if you want to get into shape like\nwhat do you think would be the most\neffective working on your diet or\nexercising and they'll say okay i think\nsome kind of exercise would be like the\nbest place to start okay\nso if it's some kind of exercise do you\nthink it would be useful like do\nsomething at home\nor like would you want to like go\nsomewhere\nand kind of just focus on exercise and\nthen you'll it'll be really interesting\nbecause someone may say well i'll never\ndo it at home\nso i should probably go somewhere\nand if you have that same damn\nconversation with that person and you\nsay hey i think you should go to the gym\nthey won't go\nbut if they come to it\nthrough their own reasoning\nbecause then if they say like oh i i\nshould go to the gym because i won't\nexercise at home\nand then you talk about going to the gym\nand their social anxiety when they go to\nthe gym they've already set themselves\nup for the advantage of going to the gym\nso you're one leg up on the barrier\nalready because it's coming from them\ndoes that make sense\nif i went a little bit off track there\nbut i think absolutely playing with that\nambivalence is crucial\npointing out that negative pointing out\nthe cost\nis very important\nthere's even an element of like positive\na hum god there\nso when you sort of frame a question to\nsomeone and you say\nyou know there's advantage for there's\noption a or option b\nand then on a given day if they choose\nthe right option\nthey start to build like a positive\nsense of identity i'm someone that can\nmove towards my goals i'm someone that's\nable to actually make a change in my\nlife because i made the right choice\ni'm doing this because i care about it\ni'm doing it because it's my duty i'm\ndoing it because it's my dharma and then\nthat actually builds their confidence\nand then adjusts the the behavioral\naction equation in the right way\nokay\nother questions\nokay\nso let me summarize all right so today\nwe talked about resistance\nso yesterday we covered intent which is\nclarifying like the energy inputs or why\nthey want to do something and anytime we\ntry to do something there's going to be\nlike something that keeps us from\nengaging in that action that's what we\ncall resistance we went over signs of\nresistance like statements clients will\nmake which sound logical\nbut will be like self-defeating\nstatements that sort of signal to you\nthat they're not actually motivated to\nact this is stuff like i want to but so\nbutts by the way are like a prime\nexample this is a great idea but you\nknow dot dot dot so i'm not that i can't\ndo that other people can do that i'm not\nable to it'll be a waste of time what if\nit doesn't work\nyou know\nlike i don't think i'm ready i'll do it\nonce\nyou know all of those are signs of\nresistance so as you kind of hear those\nstatements start to dig into them\nand as you dig into them you'll discover\nthat there's stuff going on in terms of\nmana samskar or hamkar either it's an\nidentity that they've built up either\nsome kind of emotional block or some\nkind of pattern that like they've\nlearned right where it's like triggering\nin them and then they like have\ndifficulty engaging in the action\nas you\nuncover that stuff you're going to\nextend the barrier of their\nunderstanding you're going to point out\ndiscrepancies you're going to point out\nconflicts and in that process\nyou'll start to move them towards like\nmotivation they'll start to make\ndiscoveries about themselves as they\ndiscover some of these things what we\nkind of went to you guys remember the\nfact of i am a failure versus i believe\ni'm a failure which actually causes me\nto fail you'll start to move in that\ndirection so there's like neuronal\nrewiring that goes on\nas you start to do that kind of stuff as\nyou start to ask questions as you start\nto extend the barrier of their\nunderstanding as you start to model the\nright kind of behavior\nas you start to model inquiry instead of\njudgment\nthen they'll start to actually naturally\nmove in the right direction and you'll\nkind of get them primed to like set up a\nright the right kind of goal in the\nright kind of action\nokay\nquestions\nawesome so y'all are welcome to step out\nwe're gonna hang around for about 15\nminutes\num i'm going to answer questions on\nstream do you guys want to stick around\nand answer questions\nyou'll want to step out i'm indifferent\nby the way okay so questions from chat\nokay\nso oh what would a coach do if they ask\nwhat's your reluctance and the client\nsays i don't know\nfirst thought is what does i don't know\nmean\nbut then that might also lead to an idol\nnow\nso how would you how would you approach\nthat with a client jake when we say when\nyou say what does i don't know mean\nhelp us understand what the different\nthings that i don't know could mean\nsure so there's like confliction so like\ni want to go to the gym or this and it's\nlike i don't know i don't know what to\ndo\num\nthe second is like i feel stupid if i\ngive an answer so i can't say anything\nso\ni don't know\num and the other is like they generally\njust have no idea\nyeah so that's a really important point\nso like i don't know is a catch-all\nphrase that actually means different\nthings the first is i don't know can\nmean conflict so for example like let's\njust use the example of like what do you\nwant to eat for dinner tonight do you\nwant thai or do you want pizza i don't\nknow it doesn't mean that i i don't know\nlike i don't it means that there's a\npart of me that wants thai there's a\npart of me that wants pizza\nright the second thing the second reason\nwe say i don't know is because we're\njudging our response\nso like we're not happy with what we're\ngonna say so we say i don't know\nand then third thing that jake pointed\nout is sometimes people just don't know\nso i think it's exploring the i don't\nknow that then helps people know and\nthat's a prime example of the barrier of\nunderstanding y'all get that\nand then like once you clarify that like\noh they're like oh i'm actually\nconflicted it's not that i don't know\nit's that i have good reasons to want\nboth things\ngreat um so how do i trust myself when i\nkeep failing my goals\ni think this goes back to the idea of\nlike judging yourself based on the\noutcomes\ni mean\nin the exact same situation we can argue\nyou're still trying\nright if you have repetitive goals that\nyou keep attempting\nthen that's positive progress because\nyou're still attempting\nright so there's a reframe there any\nother perspectives how would you all\nhelp a client who comes in and says how\ndo i trust myself when i keep failing my\ngoals so one option is like\nyou may keep failing but at least you\nkeep trying and if we really think about\nwho's more likely to succeed in the one\nin the end the person who fails once or\nthe person who keeps failing\nit's interesting right\ni think oh i think i would explore like\nhow they're coming up with their goals\nand like what makes them keep failing at\nthese goals and like\nwhat makes them not trust themselves and\nmaybe try and reiterate what what goals\nthey have\nright well said so it's exploring this\nis it's all about extending the barrier\nof understanding so here's the last one\nthat i i\nend up with how do i trust myself when i\nkeep failing my goals\njake what are you thinking thinking what\ni'm thinking yeah i'm i'm like why is\nhow much you trust yourself based on\nlike your whether or not you succeed in\nthe goal\ngreat right so what's the relationship\nbetween trust and failing and i'd even\ngo as far as to say that\nwhat's the cause and what's the effect\ndo you keep fa do you fail to trust\nyourself because you keep failing\nor is it the lack and trust\nthe lack of trust you have in yourself\nthat causes you to fail\nright so this we see a lot with clients\nit's a self-fulfilling prophecy\nand they confuse one with the other\ndo i do i believe i'm a failure because\ni keep failing or do i keep failing\nbecause i believe i'm a failure\nand so that revelation can be incredibly\nempowering for people oh crap\nlike\ni'm setting myself up to fail\ngreat answers by the way\num\nokay\nuh\ni'm trying to find a good question\num\noh here's a good one should i get\ncoaching even though i should be getting\nmore professional help what do y'all\nthink\nwhy not both\nyeah other responses\ni think steve has captured it but i'm\njust curious if other people would like\nto add to that\ni i don't know exactly how i'd approach\nthis but i feel like they already know\nwhat that is that they want to do i\npoint that out in some way\nabsolutely so what do you think this\nperson should do eli\nwhat do you think they want to do\nit's i'd say it seems like you want to\nget professional help\nso do you think they should get\nprofessional help\nyeah i guess if they think so\nright yeah\nso it's it's should i get coaching\nthere's a should\neven though i should be getting more\nprofessional help like there it is\nthere's the intent conflict\ntwo shoulds in one sentence\nright so it's like\nthe other question there is why don't\nyou get professional help\neven though i should be getting more\nprofessional help than like what's\nstopping you from getting professional\nhelp like what's up with that\nyou know\ni love these questions because they're\nthey're really good examples of exactly\nwhat we deal with in coaching so here's\nanother one how do i make my first\ncoaching session smoother\nexcept that it's going to be awkward and\nyou kind of have to build a rapport\nother responses great\ni'm curious why they expect it not to go\nsmoothly\nright\nor why they expect it to go smoothly or\nwhy it has to go smooth in the first\nplace\nlike think about this the first time you\ndo something like what's your\nexpectation about it going smoothly just\nlet it be rocky you'll figure it out\nyour coach will figure it out\nwhy is it why is the responsibility on\nyou\nto make your first coaching session\nsmoother you're the client you're just\nsupposed to show up if it's not smooth\nthat's the coach's problem\nit's not on you you don't have to do\nanything you just have to show up\nright there they're the professionals\nit's great\nif i know my coach is doing verbal\njiu-jitsu on me will that change how i\nrespond to emotional interviewing\nif someone knows that you're doing\nmotivational interviewing on you does it\nchange the way that you respond\nno\nwe talked about that with the placebo\nthing yesterday\nyeah assuming there's belief there i\nguess jake what do you think\num\nyeah so i don't know how right this is\nbut i'm hearing like a bit of resistance\nto the verbal jiu-jitsu so if you're\nlike realizing what's happening you're\nlike i'm not falling for this\nyes\nyeah oh go for it eli\ni was gonna say like\nkind of along what jake's saying that\nlike\nnoticing pointing out to them like oh\nwhat is it that makes you want to resist\nthis you know like i'm trying to help\nyou or like this is the goal of this and\nlike what makes you want to resist it\nsometimes you can get them to kind of\nlike throw themselves into it a little\nbit too and say like oh here i am\nresisting you i mean that can be really\nhelpful\nso oddly enough like knowing the\ntechniques that your coach is doing is\nnot gonna negatively impact your\ncoaching experience in fact i don't know\nif you all have had this observation but\nlike as clients learn to do what you do\nhow does that affect your coaching\nrelationship\nit gets a lot smoother\nis awesome\nit's fantastic\nright because now instead of the coach\ndoing it both of y'all are doing it and\nyou all are both working towards a\ncommon goal so what i tend to find is\nthat\nso i'll have clients when i work with\nclients like a long time they'll select\nstart to say things like i knew you were\ngoing to ask that question and then what\ni find is that they're doing half of the\nwork that i was doing so we just moved\ntwice as fast it's actually great now\nsometimes as eli pointed out there's a\nresistance to it they're like ah\ni'm not gonna let you trick me and it's\nlike\nokay\nso if you don't wanna work towards your\ngoals we don't have to\nright it's not about trickery it's\nreally not and that's why we we explain\nit in fact even if you look at group\ncoaching like what do we do the first\nfour weeks of group\nwe teach them how to do mental jujitsu\nabsolutely\nright and what does that do once you\nteach the group how to do verbal\njiu-jitsu\nthey practice on each other\nyep and all of them know they're\npracticing and i don't know if you all\nremember but when we role play\nright and you know that someone is doing\nlike reflective listening or open-ended\nquestions or whatever with you like you\nstill the real emotions still come out\nright like i don't know if you'll\nremember that but\nso it still works it's kind of\ninteresting\num\nall right so we've got time for one more\nanything that y'all want to just share\nor say\num\nyou don't have to well i'm digging for\nanother question but i just wanted to\ngive you all a chance to\nshare thoughts if you want to\nyeah i mean i appreciate the additional\ntraining like\njust helping me so thanks\nyou're very welcome\num you know one thing i guess i would\nsay real quick is it seems like a lot of\nthe questions kind of have a lot of\nit's like there's a lot of negative\nanticipation of like what could happen\nin coaching and i would say that in my\nexperience a lot of times that gets\ndispelled pretty quickly over the course\nof a few sessions\num\nwell said so i'm noticing that too\nthere's a lot of like\nwhat if this happens and what if this\nhappens and like what if i i does it\nlike i need to make it smooth and like\nyou'll see that you guys see what eli is\nsaying it's it's a really good\nobservation that all these questions and\ni don't think i'm maybe i'm selecting\nfor them\num but\nyou know i think there's a lot of them\num\nokay last one\nwhat do you do if you don't feel like\nyou're in control of your elec\nreluctance\nthat sounds like something that coach\nshould help you work on\nlike that sounds like a person's taking\ntoo much pressure\ncontrol is also a weird word to use\nthere\nbecause we don't really control our\nemotions\nthey just happen to us and then we\nchoose to engage with them or not\nsee that's that's the aha moment so like\nyou'll see in that question\nit's a question that's setting you up to\nfail because if you're like\nno one's in control of their reluctance\nif we were getting control of our\nreluctance\nwe wouldn't be reluctant\nright and so it's like teaching this\nperson that core concept that it starts\nlike there's nothing special like\nif you're not in control of your\nreluctance that's where everyone begins\nright it's like that's perfectly\nacceptable\nand why are you trying to control it\nit's how you react to it how you respond\nto it\nthat ultimately is going to determine\nyour success or failure but if you're\ngetting caught up with beat not being in\ncontrol of it then you're like oh my god\ni'm doing this wrong no you're doing it\njust like every other human being who's\never done it on the planet\nbut you get so caught up in the fact\nthat i'm not in control of my reluctance\nthat you don't actually learn how to\ndeal with it\nso this is another thing that we kind of\ndo is more implicit at this point but we\nsort of made it explicit early on in\nterms of our coach curriculum\nis that we're not trying to control\nright we're trying to make choices we're\nnot trying to like\nit's not like a win or lose or like\nabsolute control versus like that's not\nhow it works it's it's muddy it's messy\nand once you kind of acknowledge that\nonce you actually surrender the idea of\ncontrol once you acknowledge that hey\ni'm not in control of this and sometimes\nthe reluctance is going to win but\nsometimes i'm going to win too\nthat's when you start to make positive\nprogress\nokay last question how common is\nresistance\nuh universal\nyep\nyeah\ni don't think i've encountered a client\nwithout resistance\ni don't know that i've encountered a\nhuman without resistance\nright so these are fundamental aspects\nright so this is what\nyeah i mean it's common so everything\nthat i think people are concerned about\ni think eli pointed out well that you\nknow people are concerned about this\nstuff it's totally fine these are all\nvalid concerns that i have and i think\nwe're\ni i'm confident that y'all can handle it\nall right so thank you all very much so\nwe're going to do\num goal setting\nand how to take action tomorrow and\nthat'll kind of wrap up our goal setting\nand motivation curriculum\num you know we'll probably have office\nhours and case review times and things\nlike that so if you all have particular\nquestions uh you know you're welcome to\nkind of bring them up there we'll try to\ncompile this stuff into a manual for\ny'all as well that has a lot more like\ndetails in terms of like exercises and\nspecific guidance\nin terms of like you know almost like\nline by line like\nhow to understand different kinds of\nclients like different um some scars\nthat may be related to failure and not\ntrying and things like that as well as\num\nparticular dialogue trees that y'all may\nfind useful to help people achieve some\nof these goals\nall right so thank you all very much for\ncoming\nand we'll see y'all tomorrow\nyou"
