    "transcript": "all right we got to do this one\nhow do i poop in public because of kovid\nin the prolonged comfort of being able\nto poop in my own home 24 7. not on my\nback working in person i'm having\ntrouble pooping at work if someone else\nis already in the restroom i just leave\nif someone walks in while doing while\ni'm doing my business i often can't\nfinish and end up pinching it off and\nleaving\neven if i have the restroom to myself\ni'll have anxiety about the potential of\nsomeone walking in does anyone else\nstruggle with this got any tips tricks\nmeditations this is one where when i was\nreading this i got to scroll down\nbecause it was brilliant\nif you lay toilet paper down in the bowl\nthere's no\nsplash or noise so you can poop silently\nnext level plays chat\nnext level plays let me tell you what\ndude this is why i love the subreddit so\nhere's the thing\ndr k has a lot of answers\nbut i don't have all the answers and\nthey're not the best ones okay\nthere are some real five heads in our\ncommunity and what i love about the\nsubreddit is like the five heads have\nyour back\nso not i i had this answer kind of like\noh like look at yourself and think about\nlike what do i mean i think what i say\nstill is valid\nin the sense that like you know\nplay the tape through to the end is what\ni would say when you guys have an\nanxiety about something\ni give you all a technique which is play\nthe tape through to the end so let's say\nthat you do you know drop a deuce\nand\nthere's a splish splash or a plunk in\nthe pool\nand then like\nwhat is it that you're worried about\nright like so what happens after that\nlike\njust play the tape through like because\nthis is the thing a lot of fears are\nnebulous\nso fears can be a lot like mirages where\nthe closer you get to them in your mind\nthe more they disappear\nso like when i talk to people who have\nlike anxieties like this and we kind of\nlike explore their anxieties\nwhat we'll find over time is that like\nthere's like a primal fear but it's not\nactually like logical in nature because\nit's emotion right and so the closer you\nlook at it like the weaker it kind of\ngets\nso i would say play the tape through the\nend and then think like okay so like oh\nbut then they'd hear and then what\nyou know like are they ever going to\ntalk to you about it no they're never\ngoing to talk to you about it but\nthey're going to know and they're going\nto think and they're going to know it\nwas me and like how are they gonna know\nit's you i don't know they're gonna like\nyou know look at my shoes\nlike\nthere's someone at your place of work\nthat's looking underneath the stalls to\nsee who's in the stall like\nwhat\nall right so as you kind of play the\ntape through to the end of your anxiety\nyou'll start to see that they're like\nweird things that don't really line up\nand so eventually when you play the tape\nthrough like essentially what happens is\nin my experience a lot of times the\nstrength of the fear will like diminish\nthe more that you play the tape through\nthe end\nbut in some cases it doesn't work to be\ntbh\nand in that case i'd say like use this\nfive head move and just lay some toilet\npaper in so it doesn't plunk plunk\nyou know\nit's great\nyou"
