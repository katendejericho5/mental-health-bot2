    "transcript": "could a personal coach help me get back\non track at school\ni'm not sure what scope of ish issues\npersonal coaches cover but would they be\nable to help me get back on track at\nschool i desperately want to drop out of\nmy university program however this isn't\nreally an option\navailable to me at the moment\ni keep missing deadlines for assignments\nstruggle to keep up with studying and\ngenerally lack any motivation to make an\neffort towards school\nsince i can't drop out i figure the next\nbest thing would be to try to get myself\norganized and out of this funk\ni have adhd and frequently feel\nlike i need someone to come and babysit\nme to make sure i don't lie in bed all\nday\nokay i need someone\nto care about the happenings in my life\nfor me because it feels like i sure as\nfork don't i also\nfeel unbelievably childish in regards to\nthis matter i feel like i should be able\nto just suck it up and get it done it is\nalso possible that i am burnt out\nat this point in time i don't feel like\nliving a living person that is to say\nthat i don't feel like i play an active\nrole in my life just along for the ride\nmy expectation or assumption would be\nthat a coach would give me the tools\nthat help to help me stay organized and\nimprove my work school life balance\nregardless of motivation help me help\nmyself in becoming a functioning human\nbeing instead of a sad sack who lays in\nbed all day feeling sorry for themselves\nas much as i would love to hire a coach\nto pester me every week make sure i'm\nhanding in my assignments on time and\nmake sure that i'm focused on my\nschoolwork every minute of the day\ninstead of faffing about it i assume\ngetting a coach to teach me how to\nachieve these goals independent of their\npestering would be much more beneficial\nfor me does this sound like something\na coach could help me work through so\nthe answer is absolutely yes this is\nsomething that a coach can help you work\nthrough\nbut this statement is absolutely wrong\nmy expectation assumption would be that\na coach would give me tools to help me\nstay organized let's say i'm this\nperson's coach so this is like really\nimportant understand about coaching so a\nlot of people will come in to coaching\nand say i have this goal\nhere is my problem here's what i need\nfrom you okay my problem is that i am\nunmotivated\nand i feel like i'm just existing in\nlife okay so like if you guys have this\nproblem we're like you're in a funk\nand you think that like you just need to\nget out of the funk and you have no\nmotivation and you think that you need\nsome kind of like organizational help to\nfix the problem to overcome your\nmotivation and act regardless of\nmotivation\nthat's like that's a very dangerous way\nof thinking right so like let's think\nabout what kind of tools could a coach\ngive you they could give you like a\ncalendar ooh cool like let's let's open\nup a calendar like let's like let's make\na timetable like let's figure out what\nare you going to do 8 am every day\nyou're going to wake up you're like meal\nprep on sundays like you're going to do\nthis you're going to do this you're\ngoing to do this we're going to organize\nyour life you're going to check in with\nme once a week and when i check in with\nyou i'm going to like hold you\naccountable because if you didn't do any\nof those things like we'll talk about\nhow you didn't do any of those things\nbro cause a week has gone by and you\ndidn't wake up at all you didn't study\nat all\nthat's what people want from coaching\nright they want to go to a coach and\nthey say like oh if i go go to a coach\nlike i'm basically outsourcing the\neffort they're going to give me some\nkind of like organizational tip or some\nkind of tool some kind of magic tool\nthat with this tool you don't even have\nto overcome your motivational problems\nright\nit's almost like a late night like you\nknow advertisement for like some special\nthing with this special magic bullet you\ndon't even need motivation you're gonna\nbe successful without motivation all you\nneed is this five-star planner right you\nneed this we have a very revolutionary\npatented planning organizational system\nthat has been proven clinically to work\nfour out of five dentists agree this is\nthe right way to plan your life right it\nworked for the dentist so it'll work for\nyou\nso people come in and they say like oh\ncoaching will help me this right i need\nsomeone to keep me accountable\nbut here's the problem\nyou're like you're not living life\nyou're existing right you're just\nexisting you have no motivation you're\nin a funk\nyou also like here's the cycle like have\nadhd i don't know if that's treated or\nnot but\nmotivational problems by the way are\nlike a big symptom of adhd okay so\nyou've got adhd you go to college you\nstart to fall into a funk as you fall\ninto a funk\nyou start to like feel bad about\nyourself you start to lose motivation\nas you lose motivation something\ninteresting happens in your brain like\nwhen you're not motivated to do\nsomething\nit kind of like calculates like the\nsuccess likelihood of being as being low\nand it like further dampens your\nmotivation you fall into this cycle like\ni'm not motivated i fell behind\ntherefore i'm an idiot the more that\nyour brain thinks that you're an idiot\nthe more its calculation about\nmotivation is going to go downhill\nbecause your brain is smart right so it\nlike thinks about things this way it\nsays okay like what's the likelihood\nthat i will succeed if the likelihood\nthat i will succeed is low i'm not going\nto bother right because your brain is\npretty smart it's not it's it's evolved\nto be efficient with its resources\nthat's like it's how we work right we\nlearn how to be efficient with our\nresources and if you think\nthat you are not capable of succeeding\nthen\nthe amount of effort you would need to\nsucceed is going to feel too high and\nyou won't even bother to like\ncrap out your motivation you'll feel\nburnt out\nso can a coach help you with this\nabsolutely but the first thing that you\nneed to understand is that people will\ncome to coaching and they'll be like\ngive me a solution\nand give me a tip give me a trick give\nme a life hack because this is what our\nbrain has been conditioned to do right\nbecause you have like all these youtube\nads and blogs and things like that that\nare sort of like oh like just do this\none thing and like you will make a\nhundred thousand dollars a day like i\ndid it look at my car look at like this\nplace that i'm filming in that i rented\nusing like i mortgaged my house to rent\nout this penthouse apartment so it has a\nreally cool view and like i'm gonna look\nslick and it's gonna be great and i'm\ngonna brag about how much money i made\nand all you need to do is give me your\nmoney and then you will have the secrets\nyou'll be able to do it too you can do\nit too i know i have faith in you and\nall you have to do is give me the money\nlike it's you don't have to change\nanything about yourself heaven forbid\nyou have to change yourself\ni'm like all you need is this thing like\nyou just need this thing and\neverything's gonna be great\nso people come into coaching wanting a\nmagic bullet\nbut like what the coaches can they help\nyou absolutely\nbut what they're going to help you with\nit has nothing to do with like giving\nyou an organizational plan you'll get\nthere by the way but not at the\nbeginning\nbecause here's the thing like what do\ny'all think this person is going to do\nif someone gives them an organizational\nplan like\nso i i can't figure out in the\nhow to uh you know i think the next best\nthing would be to get myself organized\nand out of this funk like this is the\nproblem you got to get out of the funk\nright\ni feel like i should be able to just\nsuck it up and get it done\nso this is like a sign that you're not\nbeing compassionate towards yourself\nright you're blaming yourself for your\nstruggles as long as like so now i want\nyou to think about what you're doing\nhere okay so like you're trying to do\nsomething and what is the voice in your\nhead telling you it's telling you that\nyou're an idiot like you should be able\nto suck it up what's wrong with you\ndumbass\nright oh like you're such a child you're\nsupposed to be an adult you're in\ncollege but you're acting like a\nteenager or a seven-year-old you should\nbe able to do it\nso as long as your mind is like mentally\nbeating you up like it's gonna tank your\nmotivation do you guys see that\nand then what happens is you kind of\nbecome a zombie you're just like you're\nnot able to play an active role because\nyour your mind is telling you don't\nbother don't bother\nand then you need to help stay organized\nregardless of motivation no man like\nwhat you need is motivation to get\norganized\ni can organize i can show up at your\nhouse\nand i can like organize all of your\nstuff and i can give you five different\ncolored folders for all of your classes\ni can set up your google calendar for\nyou and that'll help a little bit\nbut the key thing is that you have to\nunlock your motivation\nright so help me help myself becoming a\nfunctioning human being instead of a sad\nsack who lays in bed all day feeling\nsorry for themselves how do you think\nthat you are ever going to be successful\nif this is your problem if you're a sad\nsack who lays in bed all day feeling\nsorry for yourself that's the first\nthing that needs to change so if you\nlook at people who are motivated versus\npeople who are not motivated like what's\nthe big difference it's not organization\nit's not whatever the dude on the\ninternet is selling you the big\ndifference is like like i i don't know\nlike this sounds really simple to me but\nyou know i'm gonna say it so you think\nabout like 10 people like look at 10\npeople who are highly highly motivated\nand are crushing it at life and you go\nask them how do you feel about\nthemselves\ni can almost guarantee you that not a\nsingle one is going to be like i feel\nlike i'm a waste of space and i'm\nexisting and i'm a sad sack\nright that's not what they're gonna say\nthat's what needs to change and coaching\ncan help you with that right so here's\nwhat a coach is gonna do they're gonna\nmodel positive self-talk\nright so like the tricky thing is once\nyou learn how to talk to yourself that\nway\nit's like gg\nand then people are wondering like how\ndo i learn self-talk so like you've\nconditioned your brain has been\nconditioned to say negative things about\nyou and so that's going to be kind of\nweird because like the coach is going to\nbe empathic therapists do this too okay\nwe do it i think at least we train to do\nit far very intentionally but so like\nyou know as they start to like express\nempathy towards you like\nyour brain is gonna be like oh that's\nkind of interesting and then over time\nwhen i coach people\nwhat tends to happen is like they'll say\nlike i knew you were gonna say that i\nknew you were gonna say that right so\nthey learn like you as the client will\nlearn what your coach is doing you'll\nlike learn how to predict it you learn\nhow to say what they're gonna say and\nthen you're gonna start changing the way\nthat you talk to yourself because here's\nthe thing if you just think about this\nfor a second where does self-respect\ncome from people will sometimes ask the\nquestion how do i learn self-respect so\nlet's just think about this where does a\nlack of self-respect come from are we\nborn with a lack of self-respect like no\nof course not\nright so we learn to respect ourselves\nthrough the way that we're treated and\nwe also learn to disrespect ourselves\nthrough the way that we're treated if\nwe're emotionally abused that person is\ngoing to beat themselves up too if we're\nemotionally like loved then we're going\nto like learn how to love ourself so how\ndo you learn self-respect i know this is\nkind of bizarre you learn it from other\npeople literally\nright so how do you learn self-respect\nyou get respected by other people and\nyou're like oh wow like that's pretty\ncool like i deserve respect that's neat\nand once you learn that from other\npeople then you can kind of like you\nknow change your own thinking\nthere's even research that supports this\nthere's some evidence that for example\nfifty percent of people with borderline\npersonality disorder\nwill be in remission or no longer meet\ncriteria for a diagnosis if they are in\na stable relationship for two years\njust think about that for a second with\nno treatment okay research is not huge\nsample sizes\nbut there does appear to be evidence\nthat like a lot of people with\nborderline personality disorder can\nactually like get better in life if they\nengage in stable relationships\nfor an extended period of time it's not\none year it's not 18 months so for two\nyears they need a source of someone\nwho's stable and remember that the\nnumber is also 50 so like that only\nworks for half of people\nbut i think it illustrates or reinforces\nthis point that even you can have like a\npersonality disorder and being treated\nin a particular way consistently over\ntime can change the way that your brain\nworks so how do you learn self-respect\nfrom other people and if you're\nstruggling with motivation it's not\nabout getting organized because your\nmind is like oh like\ni don't want to change anything in here\nlike i just need to find some external\nsolution out there and if i can find\nthat external solution then like it's\neasy like i've done i don't have to like\nstop being motivated\ni i yeah i can just do this thing and\nit'll fix everything\nno it's going to require hard work and\nmost of that work is going to be\ninternal\nright self growth and putting your life\ntogether is not like an external thing\nit's an internal thing at least in my\nopinion it starts internally\nso by all means you know work with a\ncoach if that appeals to you the other\nthing is like\num\nyou know i think group coaching is\nreally good for this because\nin group coaching\nwhen you're co when you have low\nself-esteem and your coach is nice to\nyou\nthere's going to be a thought in the\nback of your mind that's going to say to\nyours that's going to say to you like\nit's their job to be nice to you you\nguys get that\nso it's completely different when you're\nin group coaching because when you earn\nthe respect and they will treat you with\ncompassion and empathy right so we'll\ntrain them out to do that\nthey'll like learn how to be active\nlisteners and like empathic as well as\nauthentic so we don't want them to be\npolite we want to we want to train all\neveryone in group to be authentic and\ncompassionate not polite\nso they're going to be like honest with\nyou but they're going to temper that\nhonesty with compassion because honesty\nwithout compassion just turns you into\nan i don't know if you guys like\nknow anyone he's like oh yeah like i'ma\nspeak my truth and like they can't\nhandle it like because their feelings\nlike screw their feelings like i'm gonna\nbe the truth is the greatest ideal\nso in in the indian system in the yogic\nsystem of like moral virtues\nnon-violence is above truthfulness so\nall truthfulness\nshould be subject to non-violence so you\nshould not be it's better to be\nnon-violent and lie\nas opposed to be truthful and hurt\nsomeone\nokay\nso\nkind of going back to group but like the\nreason that group is cool is like when\nyou earn the respect of those people\nlike that voice isn't there that oh it's\nthe coach's job to like treat me with\nrespect\nthey're getting paid to treat me with\nrespect they're getting paid to like me\nthat sinister thought is there in the\nback of\nyou know your mind\nand not all coaches like their clients\nright they're good they may even be\nauthentic with you you may just be like\ndude i don't like you but i'm gonna try\nto make this work anyway\nit's good i think it's healthy to be\nhonest with with clients even if you\ndislike them so we want our coaches to\nbe like authentic and compassionate too\nand so coaching i think can absolutely\nhelp you but if you all are kind of\nstuck in this situation\ni think the key thing to remember\nis that it's about fixing that internal\nmotivation or fixing that internal sense\nof shame or that you're a failure or\nthat like and stop chasing external\nsolutions\nbecause as long as you i mean\nlike i don't think a day planner is\ngonna fix this it may help right there\nmay be like things there's just\ncertainly value to those kinds of things\ndon't get me wrong but i think that if\nyou're you know if you're like a living\nzombie\nand you're not motivated like that's\nwhat you need to fix like why are you\nburnt out what where did your zest for\nlife go\nright maybe you need to mourn a little\nbit that like it's boring maybe you need\nto change your major there are all kinds\nof things that you can do to affect your\nmotivation\num i don't know if this has been\nuploaded to youtube but you know a\ncouple weeks ago we did a goal setting\nand motivation seminar and like remember\nthat intent is one third of the equation\nright so working on that intent can be\nreally helpful\nyou"
