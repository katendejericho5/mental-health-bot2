    "transcript": "part of the reason why battle royales\nare so addictive and people play them so\nmuch is because of the denial of reward\nthe fact that you don't always win\nactually makes it like far more\naddicting\nall right i don't feel enjoyment from\nvideo games anymore and what can i do\nabout it i never have much of a social\nlife so i usually spend most of my time\nplaying video games but it's been about\na decade of that being the thing that i\ndo in my free time and what i'm noticing\nnow is i have a mental block when it\ncomes to starting new games and playing\none in general i only manage to play\ngames i get addicted to not enjoy for\nexample cs go\nit's a time sink that i'm only ever able\nto play and at this point i can only\nplay games for the sake of playing them\nso i was just wondering if there was a\nway for me to not only be able to start\ngames i want to play but enjoy the them\ntoo so this is a situation where\nsomeone's been playing games for 10\nyears\nthey also have noticed that the only\ngames that they can play are the ones\nthat they don't enjoy\nand they can't even start to play new\ngames because they like don't enjoy it\nanymore and they actually like want to\nlearn how to enjoy games again so we're\ngoing to start by sharing two or maybe\nthree principles of neuroscience and\nthen we're going to go to some practical\nadvice\nso the first principle of neuroscience\nto understand or maybe psychology is\nthat people have done numerous studies\non why video games are addictive okay\nand so when i say addictive what that\nmeans is remember an addiction is\nsomething that reinforces a behavior and\nthis will get to principle neuroscience\ntoo in a second\nbut why games are addictive is actually\nthe denial of reward\nso what makes a game addictive is not\nwinning but the fact that you don't\nalways win\nso part of the reason that battle\nroyales became so addictive and in some\nparameters fortnite for example is the\nmost\nsuccessful game ever in like some\ndimensions so if you look at like\nthe rate at which fortnight dominated\nthe market and how much money they made\nhow quickly\nfortnite like is number one in some\nparameters\nand so why is that like what's the whole\nthing like like wouldn't you think like\ndon't people like playing video games\nbut then you have a game like fortnite\nwhere i think you have like 100 players\nthat are competing for one victory spot\nand so i think part of what they sort of\nwhat i don't know that they sort of did\nthis intentionally but part of the\nreason why battle royales are so\naddictive and people play them so much\nis because of the denial of reward so\nthe fact that you don't always win\nactually makes it like far more\naddicting so that has nothing to do with\nfun and we'll get to that in a second\nokay\nso the first thing to understand is that\nthe addiction aspect playing a video\ngame despite not enjoying it and like\nnot being able to quit despite not\nhaving fun\nhas to do with an addiction and that has\nto do with like dopamine and our\nreinforcement kind of circuitry so\nthere's the mesolimbic circuit in the\nbrain which sort of governs this and the\nmain neurotransmitter is dopamine\nand so that's like behavioral\nreinforcement and the denial of reward\nstrongly stimulates that system it's\nalso why gambling is so addictive\nbecause you don't always win right so\nthe random reinforcement schedule is\nmore addicting than the consistent\nreinforcement schedule\nthe second thing to understand if if\nit's addictive why don't i have fun\nso the circuits in your brain that\ninvolve dopamine reward circuits and\nbehavioral reinforcement are actually\nseparate from the hedonic circuits of\nthe brain so the reward circuits and the\nhedonic separates are technically\nseparate and this is kind of how we\nunderstand this okay so the the hedonic\ncircuits of the of the brain actually\ninvolve like different receptors and\neven use things like endocannabinoids\nand like different compounds so a lot of\nlike pleasure seeking and like pleasure\nand enjoyment isn't necessarily the\ndopamine circuit they're actually\ndiscrete circuits dopamine's also\ninvolved in pleasure because the brain\nisn't you know it's not simple like that\nlike there's just circuit one and\ncircuit two but we do know that the\nexperience of pleasure and the\nexperience of like motivation and reward\nand behavioral\nuh reinforcement actually somewhat\nseparate and we know this actually by\nstudying the brains of people with\nschizophrenia so we know in in the\nbrains of people with schizophrenia is\nthat like reinforcing behavior is very\ndifficult for them but their pleasure\nactually doesn't decrease\nso for example like if someone has bad\nschizophrenia it's going to be really\nhard for them to like cook themselves a\nmeal\nbut whether they cook it or not they\nstill enjoy or derive just as much\npleasure from it and so people got\npretty confused and they were trying to\nfigure out like if people with\nschizophrenia are still like getting\npleasure out of it why don't they do it\nand this is when they stumbled upon this\ndiscovery that hedonics\nand\nlike motivational drive are actually\nseparate circuits\nso i suspect what's going on is that\nyou've got some kind of like problem\nhere in terms of you've got some circuit\nin your brain that has developed a habit\nand has almost like an addictive kind of\nnature to it and this also goes back to\num we we had a lecture recently about uh\nadhd and substance use and remember that\nlike when you start using a substance\nthey're like different phases of\naddiction so in the first phase it's\nlike stimulates a particular part of\nbrain and you have fun with it and then\nas an addiction sets into your brain it\nactually travels from more of your like\nprefrontal cortex and mesolimbic system\ninto your striatum and it moves to a\ndifferent part of your brain and then it\nbecomes a habit and once it becomes a\nhabit the reward like the pleasure from\nit starts to decrease\nso we kind of see this a lot in\nlong-term gamers where they're addicted\nto the game but they don't even have fun\nplaying it like even think about like\nmobas or like csgo is a really good\nexample of this where like it's really\neasy to tilt like if you actually you\nknow take someone who plays eight hours\nof games a day\nthe amount of positive feeling that they\ngenerate from playing the game is\nactually outweighed by the negative\nfeeling right and so there's another\nkind of principle here where remember\nthat the video game doesn't just give\nyou pleasure it also takes away pain\nfrom other parts of your life so playing\nvideo game this is something that's\npretty consistent is it kind of numbs\nout your mind and like protects you\nagainst the negative stuff\nso those are a couple of interesting\nneuroscientific principles about you\nknow why you can get stuck playing a\ngame and not even enjoy it and not be\nable to quit the next thing is kind of\nnaturally becomes okay so then what do\nyou do about it so the simplest way\nto stop playing games or even start and\nbecause this person's question wasn't\nhow do i stop playing games it's how do\ni start enjoying them again\nis to actually do a dopamine detox\nso we have a youtube video about this\nbut i think that resetting all of those\nneurotransmitters and neurochemicals and\nlike the ratio of like receptors to like\nwhat's being secreted\ni've seen good progress happen in about\ntwo weeks for most people so like don't\nplay any video games and ideally steal\nsteer clear of technology for about two\nweeks no reddit no youtube or anything\nlike that\nyou know grab a book like it helps if\nyou kind of do this over like a vacation\nor something like that we've got a whole\nvideo about it but if you engage in in a\ndopamine detox and reset your dopamine\ncircuitry like if you kind of like\nabstain from video games or other like\nshort hanging technology for a period of\ntwo weeks you will find that you're able\nto engage in more pleasurable activity\nand even games will start being fun\nagain\nso i've i noticed that back when i was\nlike addicted to video games they\nweren't even fun and now when i play\nvideo games they're lots of fun\nlike i love playing video games they're\nso much fun and i wish i could do it\nmore but this is the kind of thing where\nit's sort of like the more you do it the\nless pleasurable it becomes right\nso i'd say the fastest way is to\ndopamine detox now remember that\ndopamine detox is people don't\nunderstand this they don't expect they\ndon't know what to expect the main thing\nabout dopamine detox is to remember that\nlike the main enemy and dopamine detox\nis going to be boredom\nso you will be bored for two weeks\nand you're like what you have to survive\nis like a period of boredom which sounds\nterrifying it's why everyone takes their\ncell phones to use the bathroom right\nbecause like the idea of being bored\neven for a brief amount of time and\nhaving nothing to do\nis like oddly terrifying toss\nso if you guys want like an easy\npractice to prep you for a dopamine\ndetox it's very simple but it's also\nkind of hard but you can do it\nis every time you go to the bathroom\ndon't take your cell phone don't take\nanything to do when you use your\nbathroom just go to the bathroom and\njust do the bathroom\nand if you really think about it it's\nlike oh my god i need the cell phone so\nbad but no you don't like it's gonna be\nyou'll be in there like two minutes five\nminutes like if you're unlucky like 10\nminutes\nright you'll survive it'll be okay\nright and and so like you'll be fine\nlike just go like every time when you do\na number two like don't take your cell\nphone\njust go without it easy\nthat's a good way to prep for a dopamine\ndetox there's a whole video about how\ndopamine detox well\nuh so we kind of go into a lot of\ndetails about it so check that video out\non our youtube channel okay"
