    "transcript": "all right chat so now what i'm gonna try\nto do\nis teach y'all how to convince anyone of\nanything\nso a couple weeks ago we had a wonderful\nguest on stream a guy named jimmy from\nphilly\nand people were very surprised because\nyou know jimmy from philly was sort of\nintroduced\nas like a die-hard trump supporter so\npeople thought that he was going to be\nlike very irrational and like all that\nkind of stuff\nand so what i've found is that when\npeople try to like convince people of\nthings they're do they do a bad job\nand so today what we're going to talk\nabout is like a basic guide to like\nconvincing people of things and\ncommunicating with people okay\nand what i'm going to share with you all\nis a methodology that i use that will\nenhance your own communication a lot of\npeople were surprised and were like oh\nlike i can't believe that dr k was able\nto talk to jimmy from philly and like\nthat didn't go where i expected it i\ndidn't go where i expected it either but\nit turns out that there's a lot of stuff\nthat you can learn about communication\nthat can really help you convince people\nof things that you know they may be\nresistant to understand\nso we're going to take a a case from our\nreddit okay\nmy mother refuses to get vaccinated and\nit's causing obvious and it's causing\nobvious strain in our relationships\num so\ni want to preface this by saying uh i'm\na 27 year old married and have my own\napartment with my wife so it's not like\ni'm trapped living with my parents\nanyway on to the actual topic i came\nhere to post my mom has slowly become\nfurther right over the years which is\ncompletely fine i don't agree with all\nof her political opinions but everyone\nis entitled to their own politics i just\ntry not to talk about it\nonce covet happened she radicalized\nquickly buying into q and on and other\nconspiracy-esque theories i thought i\nthink that the she needed to cope with\neverything blah blah blah\nshe retweeted too much disinformation\nwith the point she was banned from\ntwitter\num\nso she's been showing me bombshell\nvideos saying things like if the vaccine\nworks\nso well why are people with the vaccine\nworried about me not having it what\nhappened to my body my choice\ni still love my mom\nwhat set her off recently was one of my\nrelatives sending an email that she was\ngoing to have a housewarming party but\neveryone is in attendance needed to be\nfully vaccinated my mom took this as a\npersonal attack on her because everyone\nknows she isn't vaccinated and she is to\nmy knowledge the only one in my extended\nfamily on the side who is not\ni was on the phone with her last night\nfor almost an hour while she vented\nabout being treated like a leper and\neveryone hating her\ni tried to get her to understand that if\nshe just swallowed her pride and got the\nvaccine everything could go back to\nnormal to some extent but she\nunsurprisingly didn't want to hear it\nshe believed all along that she is\nhealthy and does not need the vaccine\nand now there is evidence that the\nvaccine is dangerous\nso she has dug in her heels even more\ni'm sure that there's no convincing her\nto get vaccinated but it's also causing\nme a great deal of personal stress she\nis burning bridges with people close to\nher\njust so she can stubbornly say i told\nyou so on the minuscule chance that\nthere is some global conspiracy going on\nit's painful to see how unhappy she is\nand i don't have a solution i guess i'm\nnot really sure what i'm asking here but\nmaybe someone has advice for how i can\nmentally deal with the situation if\nyou've actually read through this i\nappreciate you taking the time\nso this is a great\npost and is unfortunately a really\ncommon problem so we're going to take a\nstep back\nand i'm going to share with you all my\nperspective on like how to convince\npeople of things okay\nso the first thing to understand is as a\npsychiatrist it is my job to convince\npeople of things that they don't want to\ndo that's like literally my job so i'll\ngive you all an example\nthe best evidence-based treatment for\npsychotic disorders is a medication\ncalled clozapine\nso clozapine has been shown through\nnumerous clinical trials\nto outperform any other antipsychotic\nagent so it like reduces the severity of\nhallucinations and delusions and all\nthat good stuff also improves mood the\nmost\nmay improve some degree of cognitive\nfunctions\nthe problem is that cause clozapine has\nsome really terrible side effects like\nthe worst side effects of any well i\ndon't know about any medication i've\never prescribed but like it's like\ndefinitely up there so clozapine will\ncause you to gain 50 to 100 pounds\nwill cause you to feel like cognitively\ndulled and slowed so you can't do\ncreative work will make you sleepy\nand the most bizarre um\nside effect of clozapine which makes\npeople absolutely hate it is it\nsuppresses your swallowing reflex\nthis is something that's really\ninteresting because it's something that\nwe really take for granted so our body\nhas and our brain and mouth has a has a\nreflex that causes us to swallow our\nsaliva at periodic intervals\nso once you suppress that\ncan you guess what happens\npeople start to drool like literally\nlike there will be saliva like leaking\nout of their mouth\nso sometimes i'll have someone who's got\nsevere mental illness and they've tried\nother medications and despite on those\nother medications it doesn't seem to\nwork they get kicked out of their house\nbecause they're delusional they like you\nknow get into fights with other people\nit's really sad\nand so sometimes what i really have to\ndo is convince them to try clozapine and\nit's tough because like it involves\nconvincing someone to literally like\nyou're going to be cognitively dulled\nyou're going to gain 100 pounds and\nyou're going to drool\nlike it's going to be terrible it's an\nawful medication also is a very good\nmedication it's part of why you know\nwestern medicine is hard\nso like and so i practiced that\nconvincing people how to do this and i\nwas pretty successful and a lot of\npeople get on clozapine and they tend to\ndo a good job i also do this as an\naddiction psychiatrist in terms of like\nconvincing people to stop using\nsubstances\nso here's kind of what i've learned\nabout how to convince someone and and\ni'm pretty sure and i've convinced\nanti-vaxxers to take vaccines\num you know i've convinced a lot of\npeople to do things that they're very\nresistant to do so here's basically like\nmy solution or like my playbook to how\nto convince someone and i've done like a\nlot of this successfully it doesn't\nalways work\nbut i think it's pretty effective so the\nfirst thing to understand is that\nproving someone else wrong is a terrible\nway to convince them that you're right\nso somewhere along the way we as a\nsociety thought that debate is like a\ngood way to convince people right so\nlike we have this assumption in our mind\nthat if i debate someone and i win the\ndebate\nthen like the other party should be\nconvinced like showing them why they're\nwrong and why i'm correct\nshould logically result in them changing\ntheir behavior but this is absolutely\nincorrect it's just not how it works\nokay so i want you guys to think for a\nsecond about what happens in a debate so\nif you like go on youtube and you watch\ndebates between like people's like let's\nsay like um you know richard dawkins or\nlike um you know christopher hitchens or\nlike ben shapiro or jordan peterson or\nyou know whoever\nbasically you've got two people that are\ndebating each other\nand like how often do they convince each\nother that they're wrong like it's like\ndamn close to zero so if we really look\nat debate the purpose of debate is for\ntwo people to disagree with each other\nor like let's look at political debate\nso how often does uh let's say a liberal\ncandidate convince a conservative\ncandidate that the conservative\ncandidate is wrong like never how often\ndoes a conservative candidate convince a\nliberal candidate that they're wrong\nthe answer is never\nso if you think about debate for a\nsecond so take a step back and think\nabout what's the purpose of debate it's\nnot to convince the other person it's to\nconvince the audience it's to convince\nhopefully the neutral parties that are\nlistening so the first thing that i want\nyou all to dispense with is\nany kind of debate or argument if you\nactually want to convince someone of\nsomething okay it is the worst way to\nconvince someone so if you prove them\nwrong you're not going to convince them\nyou're right in fact you're going to do\nthe absolute opposite and oftentimes\nwhat happens in situations like this is\nthe more evidence you have on your side\nthe more the other person feels bullied\nand persecuted because they can't defend\nthemselves but just because they can't\ndefend themselves doesn't mean that\nthey're going to change their mind\nthey're just going to feel attacked and\nthey're you're going to make them feel\nlike an idiot which is going to cause\nthem to dig their heels in more and push\nback against what you're trying to\nconvince them of\nso just let go of like trying to\nconvince them through argument because\nit's not going to work\nsecond thing is let go of judgment okay\nso most people like assume that they're\nright\nbut what we so like i think i'm right\nthe other person thinks that they're\nright and if you go into a conversation\nlike convinced that the other person is\nan idiot and is wrong\nyour chances of convincing them are like\nvery very low\ninstead what you need to do is go in\nassuming that they are right and do your\nlevel best to understand their\nperspective now how does this help it\ndoes a couple of things the first and i\nthink most important one is something\ncalled emotional mirroring\nso back when i was like working in the\nemergency room like an emergency\npsychiatry which is something i really\nenjoyed doing so i even did extra you\nknow i would work like weekends and\nstuff in hospitals\nso in the emergency room like sometimes\nyou'll get people who are like high on\ncocaine okay so i'm going to ask you all\na question so if i get so if i get a\npatient who's high on cocaine and i step\ninto the room and they start yelling at\nme they're like who the f are you like\nwhat are you doing here i want to get\nout of here right away like screw you\nscrew the establishment screw all\npsychiatrists what's the right thing for\nme to do what should i do\nwhat do y'all think\nso everyone's saying\ncalm them down defuse leave\nincorrect\nwhat you should do is yell back i know\nit sounds absolutely crazy but it works\nmagic okay so this is what happens i\nstart yelling back i'm like bro what the\nhell is wrong with you i just walked in\nthe door you don't even know my name and\nyou're yelling at me\ni'm a doctor i'm here to help you i'm i\nshowed up here to try to figure out what\ni can do for you\ni'm not your enemy like i literally\nwalked in the room to try to figure out\nwhy the hell you're here whether you\nneed to be here and i'm the guy who\nyou're supposed to talk to so you can\nget the hell out of here why are you\nyelling at me\nand then what happens so then i match\nhis emotional level and then i reduce\nmine and then i take a step back and\nthen i apologize to him and i say to him\nbro i'm sorry like i just walked in the\ndoor you yelled at me like it's not fair\nlike i can't imagine what you've been\nthrough seems like you don't want to be\nhere seems like maybe you don't need to\nbe here and i'm coming in you're yelling\nat me honestly i've been working for 14\nhours on this shift it was unfair for me\nto yell at you\nand so the first thing is like you know\nhe's escalating like when i'm escalating\nand then when i tone down he's like\nwhat\nhe gets confused and then like like he\ngets down to his level and then most of\nthe time what happens is he apologizes\ntoo so i know it sounds kind of bizarre\nbut you can even do this like in a video\ngame so if someone flames me sometimes\nwhat i'll do is flame them back a little\nbit\nand then i'll apologize and it\ncompletely takes like the air out of\nthem they're like screw you and i'm like\nscrew you like you they're like you fed\nlike like support's not warding and i'm\nlike screw you you fed mid two times and\nthen i'll say i'm sorry bro it's like\nnot your fault i should award it\nlike you know\ni'm having a rough day i've lost two\ngames in a row my bad\nand then\nit's like kind of hard like they don't\nreally know what to do kind of confuses\nthem\nwhen you say it never happens in my game\nso i'd encourage you all to try it out\nso\nonline games are also tough because\nyou're like handicapped in terms of\ncommunication because half the time\nthey're not even paying attention you're\nsaying so i'm not saying it's like 100\nbut emotionally mirroring and like lots\nlike you know harvard business review\nand places like that will write all\nthese articles about you know emotional\nmirroring and interviews and like if\nsomeone else crosses their legs like you\nshould cross cross your legs to someone\nelse like if you're in an interview or\nyou're asking for promotion and your\nboss like picks his nose and eats it\nlike you should pick your nose and eat\nit too because you're emotional\nmirroring i think some of that stuff is\nlike a little bit silly\nbut\nit turns out that our brain does have\nthis circuit\nthat like mirrors like what other human\nbeings are are doing it's also why like\nif you think about it you know like if\neveryone's at the funeral crying like\nit's easier for you to cry like you can\nwalk into a room where everyone's\nlaughing and like you'll start smiling\nyou don't even understand why okay\nso this is why you should let go of\njudgment and treat them with respect\nright so like understand for a moment\nthat most human beings are like within\nthe bell curve of like normal iq people\naren't stupid right if they believe\nsomething there's a damn good reason\nthey believe it now their reasons may\nnot be factually correct but inside\ntheir mind there's absolutely a coherent\nlogical structure in their mind no one\nthinks oh i don't want to get vaccinated\nbecause i'm not logical and i'm an idiot\nno one thinks that right like\neveryone thinks they're smart everyone\nthinks they're logical and in their mind\nthere is a logical system so approach\nthe conversation free of judgment and\nrespecting the other person from the\nget-go understand that this human being\nis chances are is like\nbasically just as smart as i am\nand they have come to this conclusion\nand they hold this conclusion very very\nstrongly so i need to understand like\nhow they got to this conclusion okay\nso the next thing is so as you talk to\nthem like don't try to convince them\nthat they're wrong\ntry to understand that process of how\nthey got to their conclusion and\ngenuinely try to understand it and as if\nthey are wrong\nlike so with anti-vaxxers for example\nyou're gonna sense weaknesses in their\nargument and so that's when the debater\nand with you is gonna be like hey that's\ndumb hey what about this and you're\ngonna wanna pounce on the weakness of\ntheir argument and show them in that\nmoment how they are wrong and you were\nright that is a hundred percent a\nmistake so anytime you see a weakness in\nyour argument don't attack express\nconfusion okay so if something doesn't\nline up to you they're the expert and\nyou're the idiot and express confusion\nand be like hey i'm confused for a\nsecond like you're saying that science\ncan't be trusted\nbut generally speaking like i thought\nthat you're taking you know like\nmedications and stuff like you're taking\nyour asthma medication can you help me\nunderstand like why you trust asthma\nmedication but you don't trust the like\nthe covet information i'm a little bit\nconfused about that\nand so they may say oh well like people\nhave been taking asthma medication for\nyears or like my doctor actually\nrecommended this to me and i trust my\ndoctor and my doctor knows me really\nwell\nand so like\nno they they won't they won't get pissed\nas long as you genuinely ask and assume\nthat they're correct\nright so you you just like when when you\nnotice some problem don't attack because\nour the reason they get defensive and\nthey get pissed is because we attack we\nsay hey it's dumb for you to think that\nway don't you see this contradiction\nit's not a contradiction it's just\nsomething it's a gap in your\nunderstanding so ask them to educate you\nabout the gap in your understanding hey\ni don't understand that\nbecause on the one hand i know you take\nasthma medication on the other hand you\ndon't trust this so like help me\nunderstand why one of these is\ntrustworthy and the other one isn't it's\nnot haha\nyou should trust it you see you're\ntrusting it over here and not trusting\nit over there haha gotcha don't do that\nbe like genuinely like this could be a\nreason right some people may take asthma\nmedication but won't take clozapine that\nhas nothing to do with a general\ndistrust of science it's because there\ncould be all kinds of reasons right it's\nlike one causes me to gain 100 pounds\nand drool\nand the other one\nyou know helps me breathe easier that's\nwhy i take one and not the other\nso don't point out that contradiction is\nan attack which is what most people do\nthat comes from the debating mentality\nwhich is used to convince a third party\nnot the person you're debating\nso once you've understood them kind of\nrepeat back their argument and say okay\nhere i understand so like i understand\nthat like you know the mr8 mrna\ntechnology is new and you don't really\ntrust it because we don't have any\nlong-term data on how it works which is\nlike true\nright we don't really have long term\nlife you're willing to take some\nvaccines because like the polio vaccine\nfor example people have been given for\n50 years and so you understand it say oh\nit makes a lot of sense to me\nthen ask them for permission to share\nyour point of view okay so you can say\nlike is it okay if i share with you like\nwhy i decided to get a vaccine and how\ni'm looking at it\nand then address in when you share their\npoint of view what you kind of want to\ndo is like address some points of their\ntheir perspective which you kind of\ndisagree with but do so in kind of a\nnon-judgmental way\nand you can say like you know on the one\nhand i totally get that like you know\nthis vaccine is a new technology and may\ncause\nsome problems and we don't really know\nat the same time like i think that based\non the science that i've looked at like\nit seems like you know that the side\neffects of the vaccine are quite small\nand concede their points wherever you\ncan but still like hold your own right\nso you can say that\nyou know i understand why you're saying\na b and c but like based on the way that\ni'm looking at it i think of like d e\nand f you're not trying to convince them\nyou're just asking them if they're\nwilling to try to understand your point\nof view and here's where the emotional\nmirroring comes in because if you've\nmade a concerted effort to understand\ntheir point of view and treat them with\nrespect it'll be like magic they will do\nthe same for you\nand you'll walk away from that\nconversation with them thinking you are\nlike reasonable for your beliefs like\ni'm i'm i'm not saying it's like 100\nyou get a die hard anti-vaxxer like you\nhave to do some work to get there\nbut generally speaking like if you treat\ntheir views with respect\nthey will treat your views with respect\nand then you get to a very special place\nwhere you can treat each other with\nrespect and still disagree\nand then ask for their opinion about\nwhat you believe and you can say what do\nyou think about what i believe like by\nall means like help me understand do you\nthink what i believe is like fair to\nbelieve do you think it's idiotic like\nwhat do you think about what i believe\nso let them be the final judge\nand once they sort of make that final\njudgment this is the kind of tricky\nthing is then in the last step\nespecially for like anti-vaxxers that's\nwhere i would say like you lay your\nboundary now that we both understand\nlike both sides of the equation and you\nunderstand their point of view they\nunderstand your point of view that's\nwhere you can say like i'm going to lay\nthe boundary you can say i understand\nwhere you're coming from based on the\ndata i've seen that you know people who\nare vaccinated like that more people\nwith vaccinated are getting sick like 96\nof people hospitalized in the icu are\nunvaccinated and that also vaccines\ndon't offer complete protection which is\nexactly what you said so i completely\nagree with that which is precisely why\ni don't want anyone in my house that\nhasn't been vaccinated because even\nthough we've been vaccinated the\nprotection isn't complete\nand so i totally understand and respect\nwhere you're coming from like it makes\nsense to me i'm so happy you explained\nit\ni still won't have you over because\nyou know i i personally\nhere's my point of view which i'm\ngrateful that you've understood\nthen you can lay your boundary with them\nand then it's kind of bizarre but like\nif you as you have these conversations\nlike over and over again with\nanti-vaxxers it oftentimes takes time\nlike you can't do it all in one one\nsession\num but with people like you know\nconvincing people to do things like it\ncan sometimes take time but that's kind\nof how you do it right even when we're\ntalking about like alcohol addiction\nthey'll say yeah like drinking isn't a\nproblem or like smoking pot like smoking\nproduct isn't a problem this is the\nproblem oh help me understand why i like\nsmoking a pot isn't a problem and then\nyou kind of listen to oh i see what\nyou're saying like that makes sense\nhere's what my experience is as a\npsychiatrist can i share that with you\nthen you kind of share your point of\nview you kind of ask them does that make\nsense like what do you think about that\nis like is it incorrect in some ways am\ni logically incorrect like by all means\nlet me know oh i see what you're saying\nthat makes sense\num and then sort of like ask that and\nthen just sort of like leave it up to\nthem let them be the final judge and you\nwill be amazed at like how not trying to\nconvince someone is actually the best\nway of con convincing people\nso just to kind of summarize\nyou know if you want to convince someone\nof something the first thing you've got\nto do is like forget about debating them\nbecause convincing them them that\nthey're wrong is the worst way\nto showing them that they're wrong is\nthe worst way to convince them that\nyou're right it's just not a good\neffective method\nlet go of your judgment and treat them\nwith respect and like the cool thing is\nbecause of emotional mirroring like if\nyou respect their views they will\nrespect your views\nthen understand their viewpoint and if\nthere's something that's logically\ninconsistent don't attack\ntry to actually get them to understand\nand the cool thing is if their view\nreally isn't logical and you ask for\nexplanations in an open minded way\nthey'll begin to see the own pro their\nown problems in in their arguments like\nbecause they can't explain it right\nso but you don't want to attack because\nif you say haha then they'll get\ndefensive and they'll push you away\nthen what you can do is ask for\npermission to share your your point of\nview ask them for feedback about your\npoint of view and then sort of like lay\nout your kind of final boundary hey\nhere's what i think i understand why you\nthink what you think here's why i think\nwhat i think i think your view sort of\nmakes sense um i can see how you've come\nto believe that at the same time like i\nthink that there's a lot of things that\ni've have influenced my point of view\nthat you seem to be discounting so i\nunderstand why we disagree because i\ntrust the cdc and the fda and and you\nknow it seems like you've read a lot of\nstuff on facebook that says that they're\nnot to be trusted so i can understand\nhow we're coming to different\nconclusions at the end of the day what\nwe're going to be doing in this\nhousehold or in my household is to\nfollow like cdc and fda guidelines\nand i could i understand that you're you\ndon't have to believe them but we're\ngoing to choose to\nand so i'm sorry but you're not going to\nbe able to come over\nand if you feel persecuted i i can\nunderstand why you feel that way but i\ngenuinely don't think it's something\npersonal it's just what we're doing what\nwe consider to be safe you're doing what\nwe what you consider to be safe and\nthose two things just don't line up in\nthis situation so it's like nothing\npersonal you can do whatever you want to\nit's just we're not going to hang out\nwith unvaccinated people\nand then you'll you'll be surprised\nright\nwhat works does that help\ndo people get that\nso don't attack them because they ain't\nstupid like the first thing like you\ngotta let go of the idea that other\npeople are stupid\nyou"
